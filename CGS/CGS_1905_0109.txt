THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

The most notable feature of the work of the year is the completion of the line of precise levels connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico with the Pacific Ocean. The three principal connections with sea le\·el are at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, at Biloxi, Miss., and at Seattle, Wash. The distance between Sandy Hook and Seattle along the shortest line of leveling of the highest degree of accuracy is 7 400 kilometers, and the similar distance between Biloxi and Seattle is 5 700 kilometers. This leveling is a portion of the precise leveling operations which will eventually furnish standard elevations in the United States, upon which the extensive operations of the Reclamation Service can be based and for the use of geographers, civil engineers, and surveyors, and for physical investigations relating to the planet on which we live. The leveling operations have been thoroughly checked by closed circuits as far west as Norfolk, Nebr., and the closure of the line westward on mean sea level at Seattle, a distance of 3 300 kilometers, with a small discrepancy which is within the allowable limits of error in levels extending over this distance, is most satisfactory. Work on the opening and re-monumenting of the International Boundary between the United States and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains is making satisfactory progress under my direction and that of the Director of the United States Geological Survey, as Commissioners on the part of the United States, with officers of these Surveys detailed to the immediate charge of operations in the field. The condition of this work on December r, 1904, may be stated as follows, and represents the joint work of the parties representing the United States and Canada since the inauguration of the work in r903 viz: The line was located and the vista cut through the woods from the Rocky Mountains to Skagit River; the triangulation was completed between the same points, except for a distance of 30 miles east of Laurier; the topography was completed between these points, except for a distance of 20 miles west of Okinakine River; about I 7 per cent of the whole distance from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast was monumented with the new aluminum-bronze monuments. An examination of the international boundary between the State of Vermont and the Dominion of Canada with a view of establishing additional boundary marks to supplement the original monuments still in existence, is in progress as the result of a request from the State Department, made in order to satisfy the requirements of the Treasury Department in the enforcement of the revenue laws.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

Under my direction, as Commissioner on the part of the United States, the demarcation of the Alaska-Canada Boundary made such progess as the unfavorable weather conditions permitted and the work of locating the line, opening the vista along the line and of erecting monuments, was in active operation at the date of closing this report. The demands of the Navy for assurance that no undiscovered dangers to navigation existed in certain waters was met by the construction of a wire drag 1 ooo feet long and a method was devised by which this drag, set to any desired depth, can be pulled through the water over all portions of any bay or harbor with resulting knowledge that no danger to navigation exists above the prescribed depth or the certain discovery of any such danger. This drag was successfully used in Frenchmans Bay on the Coast of Maine. In response to a request from the Isthmian Canal Commission, a survey was made of the Bay of Limon and approaches to Colon, in the Canal Zone. A survey of the Government Reservation at Fort Stanton, N. Mex., used as a sanitarium by the Public Health and -Marine-Hospital Service, is in progress as the result of a request from the Treasury Department. Work at the Latitude Observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and at Ukiah, Cal., maintained by the International Geodetic Association under my direction, made the usual progress during the year. The Convention under which the International Geodetic Association exists expires on January 1, 1907. I am a member of the Permanent Commission of the Association and have been informed that steps were taken during the year to insure the renewal of the Convention for another period of ten years. At the request of the Navy Department the Speed Trial Course off Santa Barbara, Cal., and in Puget Sound were put iu order for use. 1'he Coast and Geodetic Survey maintained an exhibit, with an officer in charge, at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, St. Louis, Mo., as a part of the Department Exhibit from July r to November 30, 1904 and has a similar exhibit at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, Portland, Oreg. An officer of the Survey continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, as required by law, devoting as much of his time as necessary to the work of the Commission and aiding in the regular work of the Survey, whenever his duties as a member of· the Commission permitted. The geographic positions of Aids to Navigation were determined along the coasts of Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Georgia, and Florida. Hydrographic examinations were made off the entrance to Frenchmans Bay, Maine; in the vicinity of Gloucester, in New Bedford Harbor, and in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts; off the entrance to New London Harbor, Connecticut; in the vicinity of a shoal off Dyers Island, Rhode Island; in the vicinity of Execution Rocks, western end of Long Island, and in the entrance to Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. Coast Pilot work was done in the Delaware River and along the Atlantic Coast from Chesapeake Bay entrance to Florida. Steady progress was made in the resurvey of the Potomac River from Washington to the mouth, and the work was almost completed at the close of the year. Hydrographic work was done in the vicinity of Atlantic City, N. J.; at Key West, Fla.; and from Cubits Gap to Pass a Loutre, Louisiana.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

The triangulation was extended from Mount Shasta in California to Eugene, Oreg.; iii Minnesota, from the North Dakota Line to Aitkin; in Texas, from Floresville to Alice; and was in progress in Minnesota and in Washington, north of the Columbia River, at the close of the year. The progress along the ninety-eighth meridian was more rapid and at less cost than during any previous year. The leveling work was extended from St. Cloud, Minn,, to Watertow'n, S. Dak., via Fairmont, N. Dak.; from Durkee, Oreg., to Clealum, Wash., and was in progress in Iowa and South Dakota at the close of the year. A continuous record of-the variations in Terrestrial Magnetism was obtained during the year by photographic means at the Magnetic Observatories at Cheltenham, Md., at Baldwin, Kans., at Vieques, P. R., at Sitka, Alaska, and at Honolulu, Hawaii. Incidentally meteorological and seismological observations were made at these observatories. The year was made notable by the large number of magnetic storms, which sensibly affected the compass direction, this being the period of maximum sun-spot activity. On the average there have occurred two such storms monthly, which deflected the compass by one-quarter of a degree and more. A comparatively large number pf earthquake records were also obtained during the year, the most notable one being the Indian earthquake of last April. . The magnetic survey of the country was extended by making observations at numerous stations (286) with portable instruments in 41 States and Territories. Some magnetic observations were also obtained in the West Indies during the voyages of the Coast and Geodetic steamers Bache and Explorer to the Canal Zone and Porto Rico. Valuable results for the improvement and correction of the magnetic charts of the Atlantic Ocean were obtained on the cruises of the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamers Blake and Bache from Baltimore to the Maine coast last summer, also by the Explorer 011 her cruise to Porto Rico and back, and by the Baclze 011 her trip to the Canal Zone. Similar results for the Pacific Ocean were obtained by the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamers Patterson and GedneJ' on their respective cruises. In all, magnetic dala were obtained at about 50 different points in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In this connection mention should also be made of the effective cooperation entered into between the Survey and the Carnegie Institution at Washington, and it is expected that most valuable data will be obtained in the Pacific Ocean. This Institution has taken up the systematic magnetic survey of the Pacific Ocean. It has chartered a vessel for this purpose and placed it under the command of one of the most experienced officers of the Survey.
AI,ASKA.

In Alaska the survey of Iphegenia Bay, Davidson Inlet, and Sea Otter Sound was continued. The work on the international boundary and at the Magnetic Observatory at Sitka is mentioned under appropriate headings in this report. A survey was made of Kiska Harbor at the request of the Navy Department. Surveys were also made in Resurrection Bay and in Prince William Sound. A hydrographic examination was made of the waters between Prince \Villiam Sound and Resurrection Bay at the request of the War Department, to facilitate fhe laying of a cable by the Signal Corps. The longitude of Sitka was determined from Seattle by the telegraphic method, and the work of determining the longitude of other points by the same method was in progress at the close of the year.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.
HAWAII.

In Hawaii a survey was made of Kahoolawe Island and vicinity, including hydrography, topography, ai1d triangulation.
PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

In the Philippine Islands the following field work was done: West coast of Luzon.'--The triangulation and topography was extended south from Bontolan Point to Capones Light-house and the topography in the vicinity of Point Bolinao was completed, connecting with the previous work in Lingayen Gulf. Vigan to San Fernando.-The hydrographic survey of this coast between the points named was completed, including large scale surveys of Vigan Anchorage, Solbec Cove, Port San Esteban, and Port Santiago. Ship work was carried offshore for about 10 miles and the coast line and reefs developed by boat work. The shore line of Port Santiago and Port San Esteban was resurveyed on a scale of I: 5 to provide for detailed hydrography. Vicinity of lba.-A hydrographic survey was made from Palauig Reefs to Iba and a large scale survey of Palauig Bay. This survey has cleared previous doubts concerning one of the most important menaces to navigation on the west coast of Luzon. Central Valley of Luzon-Ma1zila to Dagupan.-The- triangulation in this valley is in progress and is the most important work of this character undertaken in the Philippines. It will connect the triangulation of Manila Bay with that of Lingayen Gulf, and materially strengthen the smaller coast triangulation. It will also furnish dat'a for the extensive improvements projected for the Pappanga and Tarlac rivers, besides improving the topography of one of the most important commercial regions of the islands. The main scheme consists of a series of quadrilateral!:; with sides averaging about 15 miles in length. The reconnaissance and signal building have been completed, and the observations of horizontal and vertical angles finished up to the borders of Pangasinan Province. The field work was almost completed on June 30. Manila Bay.-An inshore hydrographic survey was made of the eastern shore of Manila Bay, extending from the mouth of the Vitas River northward to a point abreast of the Binuangan River. This survey extended from 1 to 4 miles offshore and included both entrances to Malabon. Another inshore hydrographic survey was made of the area around San Nicolas Banks and extending to the 8outh shore of Manila Bay from Salinas to N aig. Vicinity of Nasugbu.-A plane table survey of the coast between Talin Point and Limbones Cove was executed, together with hydrography for the same region, including Port Jamelo and offshore ship work extending 15 miles to the west of Fortun Island to examine the Simo Bank. A few soundings were also taken ·near Caballo Island and off Vigia Point for the examination of shoals. Verde Island Passage.-Complete surveys, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, were made in Balayan and Batangas bays and the vicinity of Maricaban Island. These surveys proved the nonexistence of two shoals previously indicated as obstructions in the track of shipping. North coast of Panay.-The survey of the north coast of Panay was continued by the addition of the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of Sapian Bay, thus

ooo

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENJ.

filling the gap between Capiz and Port Batan which was left unfinished during the previous year. The survey was also extended from Port Batan westward to include the mouth of the Adan River. East coast of Luzon.-A complete survey, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography, is now in progress, extending the survey of the east coast of Luzon from Lagonoy Gulf northward through the Maqueda Channel, including th~ topography of the west .coast of Catanduanes. This party also has instructions to examine the shoals off the south coast of Catanduanes and also to make a reconnaissance of the east coast of the same island. Guimaras Strait.-A complete survey is now in progress in Guimaras Strait, extending the former work from Inampulugan Island northward. The hydrography was completed to Nalunga Island, and a few lines have been run across the strait farther north. The triangulation is being carried 'on in advance. lligan Ba;1, Mindanao.-A complete survey was executed in the southern portion of Iligan Bay in the vicinity of Iligan military post at Camp Overton. Triangulation and topography were carried from Quinalang Cove to Point Binuni. The inshore hydrography for the same stretch of coast was closely developed and additional lines run offshore into the bay, which deepens rapidly. · East coast of Samar.-Two parties completely equipped for all classes of surveying are operating on the north and east coasts of Samar. One is established with headquarters at Laguan, surveying the channels and islands in this vicinity. The triangu1.ation and secondary astronomic observations for positions have been completed, and the topography and hydrography are now under way. The second party is now in the vicinity of Oras. and Hilaban Island, endeavoring to carry on the survey in the face of a hostile population and active military operations. A ·base line has been measured, signals. erected, and the triangulation and topography are in progress.
PORTO RICO.

In Porto Rico the hydrographic survey off the south coast was continued, and information necessary for the preparation of a Coast Pilot of the islands was collected by an officer sent to the field for that purpose.
TIDE OBSERVATIONS.

Self-registering tide gauges have been successfully maintained during the year at the following stations: Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Philadelphia, Pa.; Baltimore, Md.; Fernandina, Fla.; Weeks, La. (March 1 to June 30, 1905); Galveston, Tex.; :Presidio, Cal.; Seattle, Wash.; Honolulu, Hawaii; M~nila and Iloilo, P. I. The tide indicators at ·F9rt Hamilton, N. Y., Reedy Island, Delaware, and Alcatraz Island, San Francisco Bay, California, have continued in successful operation. The electric tide indicators in the rooms of the Maritime Association of New York and in the Bourse building, Philadelphia, Pa., have given satisfaction.
CHANGES IN SURVEYING FI.ItET.

Two new ships were added to the surveying fleet, one, the Explorer, being built by the Government, and the other, the Fathomer, by the Philippine government for the use of the Survey in charting the waters of the Philippine Archipelago.

14

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

One vessel, the historic steamer Blake, with an international reputation in the work of deep-sea sounding and Gulf Stream investigations, having become so old that the amount required for repairs was excessive, was sold at auction.
OFFICE WORK.

In the Office, the current work was kept up to date and satisfactory progress was made in various branches of its work, including computation, reduction, plotting and discussion of results of field work, and the preparation of the data for publication by chart or otherwise. The demand for data from the archives of the Survey increases year by year as a result of the extension of its operations and the growth of the country. The geographic positions of the triangulation stations and the descriptions of these stations are published as rapidly as they can be prepared, in order to avoid the necessity of having copies made as often as requests for them are received. The computation of the transcontinental line of levels was completed and the reduction of the triangulation in California, north of Monterey Bay to the United States Standard Datum, made excellent progress. The computation of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian follows closely the completion of the work in the field, and good progress has been made. The results of the magnetic observations made on land and sea during the year have been revised and prepared for publication in my Annual Report. A preliminary chart of the lines of equal magnetic declination for the Philippines has been prepared. The necessary material is now being collected for the preparation of a new set of magnetic charts for the United States and Alaska for the year 1905. The discussion of the secular variation affecting the direction of the magnetic needle has progressed sufficiently. far to indicate that the reversal of the secular motion during the past decade has apparently extended over all but the extreme eastern part of the country. Progress has been made with the reduction of the magnetic observatory work, and a compilation of the magnetic storllls and earthquakes recorded at the various observatories has been undertaken and nearly completed. The Tide Tables containing the predictions for the year 1906 were prepared for publication and sent to the printer. Copies of the predicted tides for Astoria, Oreg., and Sitka, Alaska, have been furnished to the Canadian government in response to a request from the authorities, and similar data for Wellington and Auckland, New Zealand, have been furnished to the New Zealand authorities upon their request. The drawings for 'the series of charts on the Mercator projection, on an approximate scale of l: 400 ooo, covering the Philippine Islands, hav'e been completed. During the year a large number of new charts of localities in tile Philippine Islands were completed. The charts covering Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River were thoroughly revised. The series of large scale charts for San Francisco Bay was completed. The work of engraving has been principally confined to making necessary corrections on existing plates to bring them up to date, though several new plates were completed. The work of printing shows a material increase during the year. The lithographing establishment of the Survey printed two-thirds of the charts published by this process,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

leaving only one-third to be printed by contract. The work is good and a chart can be is.sued on a very limited notice. The is.sue of charts during the year has been greater by more than 10 per cent than during· the previous year. The Annual Report for 1904 was prepared for printing and sent to the printer on September 1, 1904, and it was available for issue on January 3, 1905, earlier than ever before. Several valuable papers accompanied the Report as Appendices. One gives the results of the determination of longitude across the Pacific Ocean, completing the circuit of the earth. In another the Cotidal Lines for the world are shown on numerous charts. Numerous tests of a transit micrometer are described in one appendix, and another contains complete data, in convenient form for the use of engineers, in regard to more than 1 300 points, fixed in position by triangulation in California, south· of Monterey Bay. The amount appropriated for the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year 1905 was $863 s69.79,* of which $210 24s was for manning and equipping the vessels of the Survey, $43 S44· 79 for repairs and maintenance of vessels, and $so soo for Office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was about equally divided between expenses of parties in the field and salaries of the field and Office force. In addition to the above tmms, the appropriations of $so ooo for marking the boundary between the United States and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains and of $6s ooo for locating and marking the Alaska boundary, made to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of State, are disbursed, under my direction as Commissioner, by the disbursing agent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as special disbursing officer for the State Department.

H. G.
OGDEN,

Inspector.

The work of· the parties in the field was inspected whenever necessary, and numerous short trips were made in connection with the repair and maintenance of the surveying vessels. A new vessel, the Explorer, begun during the previous fiscal year, was completed under contract and turned over to the Survey on November 30, 1904.
THE VESSELS AND THEIR HYDROGRAPHIC WORK.
THE STEAMER BACHE.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at Baltimore undergoing repairs and fitting out for a cruise on the coast of Maine. She sailed from Baltimore August 6, arriving at Frenchmans Bay August 15. Magnetic observations were made en route. The work of the season included an examination of the region northeast from Mount Desert Rock, where a 9Y:i-fathom spot had been reported. The work of sweeping Frenchmans Bay was then taken up, in conjunction with the stt:amer Blake, and completed on October 28. Two uncharted rocks were located in the vicinity of Gloucester, Mass., on which the U. S. S. Prairie had struck, and one off Ten Pound Island, near the light-house of the same name. The Bache reached New York on December 12, having been storm bound en route and having stopped at Boston to prepare estimates for repairs. On February 10 the Bache sailed for Colon, Isthmus of Panama, stopping at Norfolk to make magnetic observations. She arrived at Colon on March l 3, and made a hydrographic survey of the Bay of Limon and the approaches to Colon. Magnetic observations were made in the harbor of Kingston, Jamaica, en route to Colon, and at sea between Jamaica and Key West. On May l l the Bache arrived at Key West,, where _an examination was made of Southwest and Southeast channels. Magnetic observations were also made at Key West. On June 15 the Bache arrived at Baltimore and remained there until June 30.
THE STEAMER BI.AKE.

At the beginning of the year this ship was at Baltimore undergoing repairs. On July 22 the Blake sailed for Frenchmans Bay, arriving there on the 29th. Magnetic observations were made en route. The work of sweeping the bay with a long wire drag was commenced and continued until the close of the season. Magnetic observations were made at Frenchmans Bay. The Blake arrived at Baltimore on November 6. On December 22 she was laid up, ·and on January 25, 1905, ~as placed out of commission. Competitive bids were advertised for and received, and the vessel was sold.
THE STEAME!l ENDEAVOR.

At the beginning of the year the Endeavor was at Norfolk, Va., undergoing repairs and fitting out for work off the coast of Massachusetts. She arrived at New Bedford, Mass., on August 15, and an examination was made of several shoal spots in New Bedford Harbor. She also located, by the use of the harbor sweep, the rock on which the

r7

U. S. S. Prairie had struck. On September 9 she arrived at Edgartown and examined 1 l old wrecks inithat vicinity to determine their condition as dangers to navigation. The work in this vicinity was completed and the vessel sailed for Norfolk, Va., and reached there on October 16. On November 21 she went to St. Marys City, Md., for hydrographic work in that vicinity, having stopped at Baltimore en route for repairs. On December 15 she returned to Norfolk, Va., for repairs, remaining there until May 15, when she commenced a hydrographic survey of the area at the mouth of the Potomac River between Smith Creek-Coan River to Point Lookout-Smith Point. On June 7 and 8 experiments were made with a quick sounding machine. On Jtine 20 an examination of the new channel through the Kettle Bottom Shoals was begun, and at the close of the year the vessel was still engaged upon this work.
THE STEAMER llXPLORER.

The Explorer was built under contract by the Pusey & Jones Company, Wilmington, Del., and delivered to the Survey on November 30, 1904. She was placed in commission on December 29, 1904, and from that date until March 9, 1905, remained at Wilmington weather-bound most of the time. She sailed for Porto Rico on March 9, and made magnetic observations at Norfolk, Va., and at sea on the trip between Norfolk and Porto Rico. The work of the season included Coast Pilot work in Porto Rico and hydrography off the south coast of the island. On her return voyage magnetic observations were made on two days, and she arrived in Baltimore on June 2 x. At the close of the year she was undergoing repairs at Baltimore.
THE STEAMER GEDNEY.

At the begining of the year the Gedney was engaged in the survey of the approaches to Davidson Inlet, including triangulation, topography, and hydrography. She continued upon this work until October 5, when, after storing the Cosmos and launch No. I I7 at Sitka, she sailed for Seattle, Wash., arriving there on October 25. On November 8 she was put out of commission at Seattle and laid up for the winter. On the 6th of May, 1905, she was put in commission, and after being repaired and outfitted she sailed for Davidson Inlet to continue the work of the previous season, and was engaged on this work at the close of the year. The Cosmos and launch No. I I7 were used by the party.
THll STEAMER HYDROGRAPHER.

At the close of the year the Hydrograp/zer was. en route from Key West, Fla., to Charleston, S. C., arriving at the latter place on July 2. A hydrographic examination of the northern portion of the entrance to Charleston Harbor was made, and on July 8 she sailed for Baltimore, Md., arriving there on the 13th. The command of the vessel was transferred to Nautical Expert Ross, and, after making necessary repairs, the vessel sailed on August 10 to make hydrographic examinations along t)1e coasts of Virginia, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. This work was completed and the vessel returned to, Washington, D. C., on September 30, and Assistant Parker was again placed in command. After obtaining supplies the hydrography of the Potomac River in the vicinity of Colonial Beach was taken up on October 8, and was continued until December 18, when the vessel sailed for Norfolk, Va., for repairs

At .the beginning of the year the Matclzless was engaged in hydrographic work in the Potomac River. This work was continued throughout the year, with exception of the period from December 16 to April 21, during which time work was interrupted by, ice and necessary repairs.
THE STEAMER M'ARTHUR.

At the beginning of the year the McArtlzu.r wa:s at Kiska Harbor, Alaska, engaged in a survey of that harbor in cooperation with the party on the steamer Patterson. She continued upon this work until September 8 1 when she sailed for Seattle, Wash., arriving there on October 9. On October 24 she was placed out of commission and laid up at Seattle, Wash. On May 4, 1905, she was placed in commission, with Assistant H. C. Denson in command, and on May 13 sailed for Seward, Alaska. She arrived ·here on May 29, and from that date until the dose of the year was engaged in hydrographic work in that vicinity.
THE STEAMER PATTERSON.

At the beginning of the year the Patterson was en route to Kiska Harbor, Alaska, arriving there on July. 6. The survey of Kiska Harbor, including topography, hydrography, triangulation, astronomic, and magnetic observations was taken up. The work was completed and the Patterson sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, via Dutch Harbor, on September 24, and arrived there on October l 3. A survey of Kahoolawe Island, and vicinity was made, and 011 March 15 the vessel sailed for Seattle, Wash., and arrived on the 27th. She remained at Seattle u11til May 19, during which time she was repaired and outfitted for the coming season. From May 19 to June 3 she was engaged in making the passage from Seattle to Seward, Alaska, magnetic observations being made en route and at Seward. From June 9 until the close of the year she was engaged in reconnaissance, triangulation, topography, and hydrography in Prince William Sound.
THE STEAMER TAKU.

The steamer Taku was laid up at Orea during most of the year. On May 6 the vessel was placed in commission and began hydrographic work in Resurrection Bay. This work was in progress at the close of the yt:ar.
THE SCHOONER TRANSIT.

At the beginning of the year the Transit was laid up at Madisonville, La., minor repairs were made, and she arrived at Cubits Gap, La., on December 7, where she was engaged in hydrographic and topographic work until April l, when she was laid up at Madisonville, La.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT,

The schooners Spy and Quick were laid up during the entire year at Madisonville, La., in charge of a ship keeper. The steamer Yukon and the launches,Alpha and Delta were laid up during the year at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The launch Cosmos and No. J I7 were assigned as tenders to the GedneJ' and during the interval between seasons were laid up at Japonski Island, Alaska. The launch Inspector was assigned to the parties of Assistants J. B. Boutelle and D. B. Wainwright at Atlantic City, N. J., and afterwards to the party of Assistant Wainwright on the Potomac River. At the close of the year she was laid up at Washington, D.-C. The steamers Pathfinder, Fatlzomer, and Research were engaged during- the year in making surveys in the Philippine Islands.
COAST l'ILOT PARTY.

The work in the Office included the following, viz: the correction of Coast Pilots to date of issue; the reading of the proof of Coast Pilot, Part IV; the compilation of data to assist in the establishment of lines within which the inland rules of the road should apply on the Pacific coast of the United States; the preparation of material for a revised edition of Coast Pilot, Part VII, and the compilation of Supplements to Coast Pilot volumes. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.
J. F.
HAYFORD,

brspec<or.

The duties of the Inspector of, Geodetic Work were performed at the Office in Washington except for the periods September 26 to October 2 and April 26 to 28. He went to New York on September 26 and inspected the triangulation work in progress by the city authorities under the direction of an officer of the Survey detailed for the purpose. Three evenings were spent upon the Ocean Parkway base line observing the work of the base party. On these evenings the four New York tapes were standardized by comparing with three base tapes belonging to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and 6 600 feet, or slightly more than one-half, of the base was measured. The four tapes owned by New York City are similar in cross section to the Survey base tapes, namely, about one-fourth inch wide and about one-fiftieth inch thick. They are each 150 feet long. The city also owns the necessary tape stretchers and thermometers for use in connection with these tapes. It is expected that these tapes, which will have been thoroughly standardized in connection with the base measurements in New York City, will be given to the separate boroughs at the close of the triangulation, to be retained as their standards of length. The observations of angles in the New York triangulation were commenced in August, 1903, and have, therefore, been in progress slightly more than one year. There will be from 35 to 40 primary stations in the triangulation covering Greater New York; of these, 19 have been occupied to date. There will probably be from 150 to 200 other stations, secondary stations, and some deter~1ined by intersections, in the triangulation. Of these only 8 have been

20

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl!RVEY REPORT, 1905.

completely determined to date. There are many others upon which some of the observations have been taken. According to the charter of Greater New York the triangulation must be completed in 1907. The present indications are that it will be finished within the limit. The computations made to date indicate that to ~cure the desired degree of accuracy in the length a second base will be necessary, and must be located somewhere in the Borough of the Bronx. On April 26, 27, and 28 the Inspector was again in New York inspecting this work and the triangulation along the Hudson River. During the remainder of the year the necessary supervision was exercised by a careful examination of the correspondence with the field parties and of the records of observations sent to the Office and by an inspection of the computations and results. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF MAGNETIC WORK.
', L. A.
BAUHR,

Inspector.

The duties of this Office comprise the preparation of the necessary instructions and information required by the various parties engaged in magnetic work, the inspection of the field parties and observatories, the examination of the records of observations, the controlling of the constants of the various instruments employed, and the testing and standardization of new instruments. The Inspector inspected the work of the field parties operating in New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island in August, and the party working in Ohio in September. He also inspected the Baldwin and Cheltenham magnetic observatories, and visited the new steamer .Explorer to select the proper location of the ship dip-circle stand. The activity of the Survey in magnetic work may be summarized as follows:

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1905.

In consequence of the reversal in the secular change of declination which was indicated by the observations of 1903-4, a large proportion of "repeat" stations were selected in laying out the field work for 1904-5. From the observations made at repeat stations during the past two years, it appears that on the North Atlantic coast west declination is increasing somewhat more rapidly than had been predicted. The annual change becomes less as the agonic line is approached, and on the other side of that line east declination is increasing about 2' a year on the Gulf coast and more than 3' a year on the Pacific "coast. In the course of the field work extensive tests were made of the accuracy of Lloyd's Method of determining the total intensity with dip circle, and of the declinations obtained with the compass attachment of a dip circle, from which it appears that with a good instrument the results are not much inferior to those obtained ~ith a magnetometer.

Results were obtained by the Bache on the trips to Maine in the summer and to Colon in the winter; by the Blake on the trip to Maine; by the Explorer on the trip to Porto Rico; by the Patterson on the trip from Kiska to Honolulu and thence to Seattle. Each of these vessels is fitted with a stand for a Lloyd-Creak dip circle, so that determinations of the three elements were secured. The experience of the Patterson on her trip to Honolulu and of the Bache on her trip to Colon has shown that Lloyd's Method can not be employed for determining the total intensity on shipboard within a considerable distance of the magnetic equator, at least with the deflecting needle and mounting usually provided. The earth's magnetic force is entirely overcome by the force of the deflecting needle, and the suspended needle· will not take a position of equilibrium at right angles to the deflector. To overcome this difficulty, an arrangement has been devised by the Inspector of Magnetic Work which contemplates the determination of relative horizontal intensity by means of deflections of a standard liquid compass, the deflections being produced by a dip needle or small magnet mounted at a fixed distance above the compass.

vations on land indicated that the angle of deflection could be read with a sufficient degree of accuracy, and the device is now being tried on board the brig Galilee on the preliminary trip of the Magnetic Survey of the North Pacific Ocean, which has been undertaken by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of'the Carnegie Institution. OFFICE OF DISBURSING AGENT.
Scott NESBIT, Disbu1·st"11g Agent.

The disbursement of the funds of the. Coast and Geodetic Survey is made t1ot only by payments directly from the Disbursing Agent, but also largely through the medium of the Assistants and other officers when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive .advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order, dated March 26, 1886. In conformity to this order there are now 74 officers of this Service bonded in ·the sum of $2 ooo to $5 ooo each. \\-'hen acting as chiefs of parties, these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the Auditor for the State and other Departments for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this Service, and results in the main in economy and good order in its expenditures. In addition to the regular appropriations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Disbursing Agent also disburses the appropriations for the survey and marking of the boundary between the United, States and Canada and the boundary between Alaska and Canada. During the year additional appropriations were made under these items of f,50 ooo and $65 ooo, respectively. An itemized statement of receipts and expenditures is submitted to Congress each year, in accordance with law, and is printed as a Congressional document. OFFICE OF THE EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS. The Annual Report (pp. 1-774), covering the progress of the work of the Survey during the fiscal year 1904, was completed, made ready for printing, and sent to the Public Printer through the Secretary of Commerce and Labor on September I, 1904. The first proof of this Report was received on September 20, and the last proof was read and returned to the printer on December I 3. Copies of the Report were received for distribution on January 3, and it was ready to transmit to Congress in print in December for the first time in the history of the Survey. An abstrac;t ·covering ~he work of the year was prepared for the Annual Report of the Secretary, and as much progress as possible was made in the preparation of the Annual Report for 1905. · '

The determination of the geographic positions of certain aids to navigation was assigned to Assistant Baylor. He proceeded to Vineyard Haven, Mass., on July 5 and organized a party. Field work began on the next day and continued until November 8, when the work closed for the season. Thirty-three old triangulation stations were recovered, and these were re-marked in cases where the existing marks were insufficient. Gasoline launches were hired from time to time and used with great ad\·antage 'to the work. They can be hired in all the principal towns along the coast. The geographic positions of numerous aids to navigation were determined in the dcinity of Rockport and Camden, Me., in West Penobscot Bay; of C<;ix's Head and Perkins Island, Maine, in Kennebec River; of Portland, Me., in Casco Bay; of Boston, Mass., in Boston Harbor; of New Bedford, Mass., in Buzzards Bay and Vineyard

Assistant Baylor calls attention to the extensive changes along the coast due to the construction of hotels and cottages, with the resulting destruction of old triangulation stations, and states that many others have been rendered useless by the buildii1g operations. The accurate determination of the position of all lighthouses and other permanent structures makes them doubly useful as aids to navigation and as triangulation stations upon which all work required in future can be based.

VERMONT-CANADA BOUNDARY.

A request for an examination and better definition of the international boundary between the United States and Canada north of the State of Vermont was made by the Treasury Department through the State Department, and the work was assigned to Assistant Baylor. He left Washington on June ro and proceeded to Albany Springs, Vt., where he met a representative of the Canadian government. After consultation, these officers began a joint examination of the boundary in question and were actively engagetl in the work at the close of the fiscal year.

Sounding began on August 15 and was continued until the 30th, when the work was turned over to Assistant Wainwright. The statistics of work accomplished and other details in regard to ie are stated in the abstract of Assistant Wainwright's report. Hydrographic work in the resurvey of the Potomac River was then assigned to Assistant Boutelle, and his party reached Chicomuxen Creek on September 14. The necessary signals were erected and their positions determined. The' work of sounding was begun on September 23 and continued, whenever the weather conditions and the necessity of building signals permitted, until December 17, when the ice on the river stopped the work for the season. The work covered the river from Cockpit Point to Aquia Creek and .a portion of the work was done between Aquia Creek and Maryland Point. During the latter part of the season the work was much delayed by freezing weather. On April 1 Mr. Boutelle began work on the triangulation of Hudson River from a point in the vicinity of Anthonys Nose to Milton. Below Cold Spring 12 old triangulation stations were recovered and 6 new ones were established. Above Cold Spring new triangulation stations were established all the way to Milton, where 1 old station was recovered. No old stations were found between these two places.

The resurvey of the coast of Louisiana in the vicinity of Cubits Gap from Pass The necessary preparations were made at Madisonville and New Orleans, and he left West End on the Transit on December 3. Field work began on the 7th and continued until April r, 1905. Numerous signal poles were erected along the shores of the various passes, and their positions were determined from the old triangulation stations by using the plane table. The shores of the passes were then defined by sketching between the positions thus determined. These shores are all covered with a growth of willows or cane, ranging from ro to 18 feet in height, growing in the mud, and a survey with the plane table was impracticable. All the bayous leading from the different passes were surveyed by carrying a ladder, sufficiently high to overlook the growth along the streams, from place to place in a boat, so that an observer mounted upon it could determine the position of any point selected on shore by using a sextant and the signals already fixed in position. The shore line of the bayous was .fixed in this way.

a I,outre to Bird Island Sound was assigned to Assistant Denson.

The hydrographic survey was made by sounding between the points established as stated above. Six signals were erected on the water 2 to 3 miles offshore for use in the hydrographic work offshore. A gasoline launch was used and the sounding lines were ext!"!nded out to sea as far as it was practicable to see the signals. A plane of reference for reducing the soundings was obtained by establishing a tide staff which was referred to a bench mark of the Mississippi River Commission. Extensive changes in the hydrography and shore line were noted. At one point the shore line is 476 miles to the eastward of its former position.

Topographic work along the Potomac River was in progress under the direction of Assistant Forney on July I. The work continued until December 20, when it was suspended until March 20. It was resumed on this date and continued without interruption until the close of the year. The topographic survey was extended along the south bank of the river from Smiths Point to Gunston Cove, and on the north bank from Chickomuxen Creek to Indian Head. The party was then transferred to Rock Point, Md., and the topographic survey of the north bank was extended from that place to Lower Cedar Point. The work was in progress on June 30.

Work under the above headings was a;;signed to Assistant Gilbert. In response to a request from the commanding officer at Fort Hunt, Va., Assistant Gilbert was instructed to determine the relative positions of certain objects in that vicinity. He visited Fort Hunt on April 26, May 19, 20, 22, and 23, and measured all the angles required for the work. The work was based on the distance between the old triangulation stations, Fort Washington and Bryant Point. It was impracticable to use the latter station and the line was prolonged a certain distance to a point called Bryant Point 2, from which the desired observations could be made. On June 3 Assistant Gilbert proceeded to Woods Hole, Mass., and made a hydrographic examination of a portion of the Middle Ground in Vineyard Sound where shoal water had been reported, and returned to the Office on June 8. On June 12 Assistant Gilbert proceeded to Virginia Beach, Va., to determine the position of a number of prominent objects which could be used in making a hydrographic examination off Cape Henry. He measured the distance from Cape Henry Light-house to Life-Saving Station No. 4, which is located south of Virginia Beach. From this measured line the position of all prominent objects along the shore were determined by using a plane table. A check was obtained on the work by using the old triangulation line from Cape Henry Lighthouse to Cape Charles Light to determine the position of the Princess Anne Hotel at Virginia Beach, one of the objects determined with the plane table from the measured line. The work was completed June 21.

An area of 5 square miles extending from the north side of the north jetty to the shore and to a point 1 mile east of the end of the jetty was examined by sounding. Tidal data and a tracing of the record on the self-registering title gauge covering the time occupied by the work was kindly furnished to the party by Capt. G. P. Howell, Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army. Hydrogfaphic work in Potomac River was assigned to Assistant Parker in October and he reached Colonial Beach, Va., on the 8th. Forty square miles of area in the river between Lower Cedar Point and Blakistone Island were covered with soundings. In the Kettle Bottoms '' 146 shoal spots were examined and developed. Most of the work about the shoals was done with the ship, while a party in the whaleboat made soundings close inshore extending the work to the shore line. The shoal off Lower Cedar Point and the channel between the point of land and the shoal was covered by sounding and the work was extended« to the northeast as far as necessary to define the limits of the shoal. In Rosier and Mattox creeks the channels were sounded to the limit of steamboat navigation. A detailed survey was made in Monroe Creek. In the entrance to Wicomico River the hydrography was extended from the limit of the recent survey as far on the flats at Cob Point and St. Catharine Island as the draft of the ship would permit. Nearly all the old signals were found standing and only a few additional ones were erected. Tide staffs at Colonial Beach and at Cob Point Bar Light-house were used at different times during the season and referred to each other by simultaneous observations. Simultaneous observations were also made in cooperation with the other parties engaged in work in this vicinity ..

The field work required for the re\'rision of the United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VII, Chesapeake Bay entrance to Key West was assigned to Nautical Expert Ross, commanding the steamer Hydrographer. The Hydrographer sailed from Norfolk, Va., on March 23 and returned to that port on )une 24. During this period work was done as stated below. The principal places visited during the season were: Elizabeth City, Edenton, Belhaven, Newbern, Portsmouth, Ocracoke, Morehead City, Lookout Bight, Southport, and Wilmington, N. C.; Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort, and Port Royal, S. C.; Savannah, Darien, and Brunswick, Ga.; and Fernandina, Mayport, Jacksonville, Miami, and Key West, Fla. Sailing lines were checked along the coast from Ocracoke Inlet to Fowey Rocks, through Albemarle and Pamlico sounds, the sounds and harbors to Key \Vest, the inland passage between Charleston and Fernandina, and through the Hawk Channel. In the course of the work a spar (danger to navigation), a buoy in Frederica Creek, a cluster of rocks in the Hawk Channel, and a shoal off \Vinyah Bay were located and reported to the Office. Great courtesy was shown by the United States engineers in charge of improvements, the local authorities, and the pilots and steamboat and towboat captains, who invariably put themselves to some inconvenience to furnish .information for the Coast Pilot. In the collection of data, special attention was given to the sailing lines with reference to 'the aids (buoys, etc.), also any landmarks which can be used when making a landfall or in approaching the entrances to the sounds. Time would not permit of making systematic current observations, but the best local steamboat men, fishermen, and pilots were coilsulted, and their information corroborates the general information obtained on the subject. The navigation on this section of the coast calls for more local information than is generally required on other parts of our co'.lst. The frequent changes in the depths over the bars and the nature of the improvements under the supervision of the United States engineers require that vessels of deep draft (over 21 feet) inquire beforehand

what depth they can take in and out of the port to which they are bound; this is the general practice at present. The presence, however, of Government dredges oi1 the bars of the principal harbors will in the near future insure more permanent depths than has been the case in previous years. ; In connection with the .inland waterways, the need is felt for a greater depth over the swashes to Ocracoke Inlet. At present the best draft taken through Wallace Channel is 6Yz feet, and through Teaches Hole Channel, 7 feet; these drafts require the top high water and what is known locally as a good tide. The only vessels which. can now use Ocracoke Inlet to '.!void Cape Hatteras are of 7 feet or less draft, _and as vessels of 8 to 9 feet draft navigate Albemarle and Pamlico sound'> and the canals, it would seem that a depth of 9 feet over one of the swashes would benefit i11any vessels.

On August 26 the continuation of the resurvey in the vicinity of Atlantic City was taken up by Assistant Wainwright. The work was in progress under the direction of Assistant Boutelle, and he proceeded to other duty as soon as reli~ved. The resurvey of Absecon Inlet was completed 011 September 25 and of Great Egg Harbor Inlet on October 15. The work included the survey of the shore line at the entrance to· Brigantine, Absecon, and Great Egg Harbor inlets, and a sufficient number of soundings to show the characteristic features of the approaches, bars, and mouths of the inlets. The party then proceeded to Chesapeake Bay on the launch Inspector and took up the resurvey of the shore line from Halls Creek to Cockrells Creek. Excellent weather made it possible to complete this work before the end of October, and the party reached Riverside, Md., on the 29th. The resurvey.of Nanjemoy Reach (from Maryland Point to Upp1.:r Cedar Point on the Potomac River) began on October 31, and was completed on December 11. A close survey was made of the deep water in the reach, but the launch in use drew 4~ feet, and consequently no work was done in water less than 6 feet deep. On December 12 the party went to. Clifton Beach to aid in finishing the work in that locality, but little was accomplished. The weather had become quite cold, and the river soon filled with ice floes, which made it necessary to close work on the 18th. Between April 26 and May 4 Assistant Wainwright went to Jamestown Island, Virginia, and revised the old topographic work on the western portion of the island, in order to show its present condition, so that the chart of the island can be brought up to date. On June 17 Assistant Wainwright went to Rockland, Me., to verify the length of a speed-trial course which had been established off that' place. 1'his work was done at the request of the Navy Department. Unfavorable weather delayed the work, and it was in progress on June 30.

The steamer Bac!te left Baltimore on August 6 for Frenchmans Bay, Maine, under command of Assistant P. A. 'Welker, to take part in the hydrographic examination of that bay with the long wire drag recently constructed. Magnetic observations were made at sea on the voyage to Maine and the. vessel reached Frenchmans Bay 01i August 15. Assistant Welker reported immediately to Assistant Waimvright, commanding the steamer Blake, and was engaged in work under his direction until August 25. On August 26 Assistant Welker assumed direction of the work of his own vessel and that of the steamer Blake, under command of Assistant Faris. The Blake and three launches were used to operate the long wire d~ag while the Bac!te made an examination of the region northeast from Mount Dest!rt Rock, where a 9 ,%-fathom spot had been reported. A description of the .long wire drag, constructed for use in the work, is published as an appendix to this report. The work of sweeping Frenchmans Bay was completed on October 28. The drag was carried over a distance of 331 miles, and the area covered was 43 square miles. An area of 66 square miles, covering the vicinity of the reported 9Yz-fathom bank, was carefully examined with the submarine sentry set to depths from 15 to 20 fathoms. On October 1 the Baclze went to the assistance of the sloop Island Belle, reported ashore on Long Porcupine Island. The sloop had been abandoned. A crew in charge of Mr. Sanger was placed on board, and the sloop was towed into Bar Harbor. The master and two men were afterwards taken off the island and placed on board the sloop. The work in this vicinity closed October 31. Between November 11 and 15 two uncharted rocks were located, one in the vicinity of Gloucester, Mass., on which the U. S. S. Prairie had struck, and one off Tenpound Island, near the light-house of the same name. The Baclle reached Key \Vest, Fla., on May 1 1, and preparations were made immediately to examine South \Vest and South East channels. The necessary signals were erected and their positions were determined. Drags set at various depths, as required, were used on the ship and on one of the launches. Lines were run, with the drags in position, approximately parallel to the axes of the channel, at distances of 10 to 70 meters apart. Whenever an obstruction was struck the locality was thoroughly developed by sounding, and the shoalest water was obtained by setting the drag at various depths until one was found which would just clear the obstrnction. Magnetic observations were made in the harbor of Kingston, Jamaica, en route from Colon to Key West, and at sea between Jamaica and Key West. Observations were made on land at Key \Vest and at sea en route to Cht!sapeake Bay, also off Fort Monroe after entering the bay.

old stations recovered. new stations establisherl. stations occupied. geographic positions determined.

The recovery of old triangulation stations along the coast south of Brunswick, Ga., and the determination bf certain aids to navigation was assigned to Assistant Winston. He reached Brunswick on January 17 and began work immediately. Five stations were recovered in the vicinity of Brunswick and one new one was established, and from t11e bases furnished by these stations the positions of five beacons and two other objects were determined. The location of all old stations between Brunswick and Fernandina were visited and a search was made for the station marks. The frequent burning of the woods, the growth of the trees and the extension of wooded areas, the erosion of banks by floods and high tides, and the destructive action of curious persons during the many years which had elapsed since the stations were established and used, all contributed to make the work of recovery difficult. Three stations were recovered south of St. Andrews Sound, and the triangulation was extended to cover the entrance to the sound by establishing 5 new stations. Four wharves on Cumberland Island and one on the Mainland were fixed in position by angles measured from the wharves. In the vicinity of Fernandina 3 old stations were recovered and 3 new ones were established. From the bases thus furnished the positions of fourteen aids to navigation and other objects were determined. In the vicinity of Nassau Sound 5 old stations were recovered. In the vicinity of the mouth of St. Johns River 4 old stations were recovered and 6 new ones were established. From these bases 12 aids to navigation and other objects were determined. Three of the new stations were stations used by the Corps of Engineers in their triangulation of the river and t~ey were used to connect the two systems of triangulation. In the vicinity of St. Augustine 3 old stations were recovered and the positions of 7 prominent objects in the town were determined. The marks at the old stations recovered were renewed or supplemented in a manner to make them more permanent. All new stations were marked in a substantial manner. The buildings in Brunswick, Fernandina, and St. Augustine were located on the plans of the town, so that the charts can be corrected to show the existing conditions. The self-registering tide gauge at Fernandina was inspected and certain necessary repairs were made. Fieldwork closed May 4.

The determination of certain dangers to navigation off the coast of Massachusetts was assigned to Assistant Young, commanding the steamer Endeavor. The vessel reached New Bedford, Mass. , on August 1 5 and an examination was made of several shoal spots in New Bedford_ Harbor. A rock on which the U. S. S. Dixie struck was located by using the harbor sweep after the lead line had failed to show its presence, which indicates that it is small and has a rounded top. On September 9 the vessel went to Edgartown and the regions in the vicinity of eleven old wrecks were examined by dragging a long wire over the location of the wrecks, as formerly determined. Some of them have disappeared and no trace of them could be found. The present condition of the others as dangers to navigation was determined. This work was completed and the vessel sailed from New Bedford to Norfolk, Va., on October r 4. On June 20 Assistant Young, on the Endeavor, reached Colonial Beach, Va., and made an examination of the new channel through the Kettle Bottom Shoals on the north side of the Potomac River by using a channel sweep. Lines were run through this channel with the sweep in position and the greatest depth possible to be carried through at low water was determined. Hydrographic work was in progress on the lower Potomac River at the close of the fiscal year.

The elevation of Back-Base had been determined by precise leveling and it was also connected with the triangulation by vertical angles. During the latter part of the season fog, mist, and rain caused considerable delay in the progress of the work. Signalman J. S. Bilby extended the reconnaissance from Aitkin to Duluth, Minn., by September r and took charge of the signal building personally on that date. Foremen W. C. Nohl and Floyd Bilby had been in charge of the building party previous to that date under the supervision of Signalman Bilby, who directed their movements by letter. The building party closed work in Minnesota 011 September r 2 and went to Texas to continue the work in that State. Signalman Bilby completed the reconnaissance between Floresville and Alice 011 November 4, when he again took personal charge of the signal building party which had been at work under his direction in charge of Foreman Floyd Bilby. On December 22 the work of bu~lding signals was completed for the season, and the party was disbanded. The observing party began work in Texas at Serita station on November ro and continued work until January 29, when the observations were completed for the season. Observations were made at the following stations, viz: Serita, Stockdale, Ruckman, Karnes, Bryde, Choate, Pettus, Borroum, Wiess, Beeville, Fleming, Miller, O'Neill, Welder, Skelly, Mathis, Nolan, Elliff, Reynolds, Alice, Wood, Alice East Base, and Alice West Base. Observations to determine azimuths were made at stations Karnes, Miller, and Alice. The reconnaissance was extended from the vicinity of Barquette to the Gulf of Mexico off Corpus Christi. The work in connection with the closing operations for the season was completed on February r 1. Advantage was taken of Assistant Burger's presence in Texas and he was directed to inspect the tide gauge at Galveston. He proceeded to that place on the 12th and performed the duty assigned him. He also verified the position of the tide staff by leveling to the bench marks. · Assistant Burger resumed work on the triangulation in Minnesota on April 24, when Signalman Bilby reached Aitkin with the party outfit, which was brought from Texas under Assistant Burger's direction. He organized a signal building party and began the erection of signals on May 4. At the close of the fiscal year signals had been erected at 13 stations and the work was in progress. Assistants Burger and King reached Aitkin on May 31 and immediately organized an observing party. Observations began on June 8 and the following stations were occupied before June 30, viz: Gull, Jones, Rabbit, Brook, and Bethlehem. While at Aitkin a short base lin~ was selected and angles were measured to determine the ele_vation of certain prominent objects in the town above a bench mark established on the court-house by the Mississippi River Commission. These objects were connected with the triangulation as a check on the elevations. The chief of the party did all in his power to aid ,Assistant King in becoming familiar with the details of the work in anticipation of transferring the charge of the work to him in July. Observations were in progress at Bethlehem station on June 30.

The magnetic work at the Baldwin Magnetic Observatory and the extension of the magnetic survey in certain localities was assigned to Magnetic Observer Smith. The variations in the force of terrestrial magnetism at Baldwin, Kans., were automatically recorded at the observatory during the year on self-registering instruments. Observations were made at this station on Monday of each week to determine the absolute value of the magnetic forces, and special records were made with the magnetograph on the ist and 15th of each month. During the month of December the old magnetograph was removed and a set of new Schulze' instruments were installed. During the year magnetic observers were assigned to duty under the direction of Mr. Smith, and they made observations to determine the value of the elements of terrestrial magnetism at the places named above.

The extension of the standard levels was in progress on July 1 by a party under the direction of Aid Baldwin, and he was at work in the vicinity of Clealum, Wash. The levels were extended over the main line of the Northern Pacific Railway to Pasco, and thence over a branch line to Hunts Junction, Wash. From this place the levels were carried along the Washington and Columbia River Railway to a point 5 miles distant, when a connection was made with the levels from the eastward, completing the line from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. The officials of the railways were unwilling to grant the privilege of using velocipede cars on their tracks, but they generously placed a freight car at the disposal of the party, to be used as quarters, and hauled this car from place to place, as requested. No charge was made for this service which greatly facilitated the progress of the work in the sparsely settled region over which the route passed: In his report Mr. Baldwin expresses his appreciation of the favors shown the party by the officials of the two railways, and the thanks of the Survey are due the companies for the above and other courtesies extended to the party. On the portion of the line between Pasco and a point 4 miles south of Hunts Junction the country is desolate and sandy, and the drifting sand in windy weather made it impossible to use the wind break and stopped the work when the wind was very strong. The work was completed on October r and the party was immediately disbanded.

The triangulation along the coast of California, north. of San Francisco, was in progress on July· 1 under the direction of Assistant French, with Assistant Hill as a member of his party, and observations were being made at Spur station. On July 9 the obser\'ing party proceeded to Boliver station in charge of Mr. J. S. Hill, and l\fr. French went to Washington to extend the reconnaissance from the Columbia River to Puget Sound. After considerable delay on account of the smoky condition of the atmosphere several stations were approximately located and a base line was selected. Mr. French returned to the observing party on August 10. The following stations in the main scheme were occupied in the order named: Spur, Boliver, Central Point, Sterling, Soda, Rust, Black, Onion, \Vhite, Scott, Yellow, and Fairview. In October the astronomic station at Roseburg, Oreg., was occupied. In order to connect with a Geological Survey bench mark at this place, a short base line was measured and two points were occupied for the measurement of the necessary angles. Later in the month 2 stations, Rose and Burg, in this vicinity, were occupied. Observations were made to determine an azimuth at the astronomic station on Skinners Butte and horizontal angles were measured at that station and at Seavies to connect the astronomic station with the main scheme. On November I 2 Mr. French returned to Tacoma and spent a week on reconnaissance, but the weather was unfavorable and very little was accomplish.eel. Work for the season closed on November 20. Mr. French resumed work on the reconnaissance on April 14 and selected several stations before starting a signal building party to work. He then completed the reconnais.<;ance to Tacoma and returned to Eugene, Oreg., May 31. Mr. Hill had reached Eugene a few days before and had the outfit nearly ready for use. Observations began at Ridge station on June 6, and the work at North Base, Twin, and Peterson was completed. On June rs the outfit was shipped to Tacoma and the observing party proceeded to that place. Some time was spent in completing the work of the signal building in the vicinity, as that party was sent at once to the mountains. Stations Wash, Smelt, Tacoma, Astronori1ic, Robinson II, Dash, and Piner were occupied before June 30.

He reached Fort Stantotl- on September 17 and found Mr. Fitzgerald at work, and various preparations had been made. The reconnaissance was extended over the reservation, and numerous triangulation stati~ns were selected. A base line was measured with a steel tape, and the latitude and longitude of a point and the azimuth of a line were determined from observations of the sun. The triangulation stations h1 the main scheme were occupied, and their geographic positions were determined. The elevations of these stations were also determined trigonometrically. The reservation covers 38 square miles and has a general rectangular shape, but the boundary is irregular and is composed of 62 separate lines, which involves an equal ntunber of corners to be recovered and marked.

On July 9 he proceeded to Santa Barbara and put the speed trial course in that vicinity in order, as the result of a request from the Navy Department. The range marks were repaired and two detached line fences were constructed to strengthen the definition of the western range. Two of the old triangulation stations were recovered, and, from the line between them as a base, the position of a windmill in the rear of Santa Barbara Light-house was determined to strengthen the eastern range. The field work was completed on July 20. On September 8 Mr. Rodgers proceeded to Seattle, Wash., to prepare the Alki speed trial course for use. Two of the targets had been destroyed and had to be replaced. This work was done at the request of the Navy Department. It was completed on September 18. In June Aid P. C. Whitney reported to Assistant Rodgers for the purpose of establishing a self-registering tide gauge in Santa Monica Bay, California, under his direction. Mr. Whitney reached Santa Monica on June 13, and, after examining the available localities, selected Redondo as the most suitable place for the erection of the gauge. The work of installing the gauge began immediately and was in progress at the close of the year. Tide observations were continued during the year at the Presidio Station, San Francisco, Cal., under Mr. Rodgers's direction.

The work was continued in this locality until July 27, when the ship was moved to Holbrook, at the head of the inlet, and work was done in the vicinity until August · 24, when the ship went to Cyrus Cove and remained there until the close of the season. During the sen.son a hydrographic survey was made of Iphegenia Bay, of a portion of Warren Channel, of Davidson Inlet, and of Sea Otter Sound. A survey was made of the shore line on Warren Island in Iphegenia Bay an<l Warren Channel, along the shore of Davidson Inlet and Sea Otter Sound, and a portion of Tuxekan Passage, and of several islands in these waters. The shore line at Shakan was surveyed. A reconnaissance was made through El Capitan Passage, and the shore line of the main islands and of numerous small islands was sketched. Interior topography was surveyed along the shores of Davidson Inlet, of Sea Otter Sound, and of Tuxekan Passage, and a survey was made of numerous small islands in these waters. Triangulation was done in Iphegenia Bay and Sea Otter Sound. Field work closed on October 5 and the vessel proceeded to Sitka via Wrangell for coal. At Sitka the Cosmos and launch I 17, which had been nsed during the season, were hauled out and housed. On October 15 the vessel left Sitka and reached Seattle on October 23. On May 17 Assistant Dickins left Seattle on the GedneJ 1 to resume work on the coast of Alaska. On May 23 the survey of the north arm of Moira Sound began and was completed on the 27th. A hydrographic survey, based on a plane table triangulation, was made of Dolomi Bay and Port Johnson. \Vork in. Cordova Bay was begun on June 5 and signals were erected around the bay and in Retta Inlet. A tide staff was established at Coppermount and at Sulzer. A base line was measured by means of a stadia on Jumbo Island and a plane table triangulation was extended as far as Lime Point at the head of Cordova Bay. The hydrographic work began near Jumbo Island and was extended to the head of the inlet. The shore line was determined by plane table intersections and sextant angles and was sketched between these stations.. An examination was made of the portage between the head of Retta Inlet and Cholmondeley Sound. On June 17 the vessel went to Coppermount and co)1tinued the work to the southward until June 20, when the anchorage was changed to Hassiah Inlet, where another tide staff was established. 'fhe work was continued to the southward until the 29th, when the vessel moved to Kassa Inlet, where a tide staff was erected, and the work was in progress in this inlet on June 30.

longitude station occupied.

The determination of the longitude, by the telegraphic method, of certain places in Alaska was assigned to Assistants Edwin Smith, J. E. McGrath, in charge of cooperating parties. Mr. Smith reached Seattle on April 3 and Mr. Baird reported to him for instruction on the following day. · Excavations were in progress in the university grounds, where the astronomic station was located, and it was not possible to occupy the station. A new station was selected and referred to the old· station. This new station was prepared for the work, and two sets of instruments were mounted on piers-one for the regular work and the other for the use of Mr. Baird in making himself familiar with all the operations connected with the work. Mr. Smith was ready for work.on April 15 and Mr. McGrath, at Sitka, on April 23, but bad weather prevented observations until May 24, when exchanges of signals were made, and also on the four succeeding nights. After completing the observa.tions the observers immediately exchanged stations, but both ends of the line were not ready for work until June 8. After that date the bad weather again prevented work, except on the 13th and 18th, until June 22, when it was necessary for Mr. Smith to leave Sitka and proceed to Fort Egbert in order to complete that station before the winter season. He had not reached his destination ~n June 30, being compelled to wait at Dawson for a steamer.

The survey of Limon Bay, Canal Zone, was assigned to Assistant Welker, commanding the steamer Backe. Magnetic observations were made off Norfolk and in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and on February 28 the vessel sailed for Colon, Panama, via Kingston, Jamaica. Magnetic observations at sea were made on the voyage north of Cape Hatteras, but the sea was too rough for obsel"Wtions during the remainder of the voyage, except in Kmgston Harbor and off Colon. · The vessel reached Colon on March 11 and Assistant Welker called upon Mr. Charles List, the resident engineer' of the Panama Canal, and later visited Chief Engineer John F. Wallace, at Panama, for consultation. A base line was measured on Mangrove Beach, at the entrance to the canal, to serve the purpose of the survey of Limon Bay and to be used in extending a triangulation along the canal. The ends of this base line were marked in a permanent manner, so that it will be available after the canal is completed.

A triangulation was extended from this base line to cover the bay and furnish lines upon which the topographic and hydrographic work could be based. The weather was generally favoraqle, but in certain portions of the bay there was a strong swell and heavy breakers almost constantly. Extra precautions were taken to prevent sickness and the health of the crew was good throughout the season. The survey was completed OD April 28 and on May 2 the vessel sailed for Key w ~st. From February 12 to May 15 Mr. J. P. Ault, magnetic observer of the Carnegie lnstitutiont was attached to the vessel for the purpose Of obtaining magnetic observations. He rendered valuable assistance in the duty assigned to him and also in other work of the Survey, in which he took an active part.

The survey of certain portions of Hawaii was assigned to Assistant Pratt. He sailed from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on October 1 and reached Honolulu, Hawaii, on the 13th. On November 4 the vessel reached her working ground off Kahoolawe Island. A triangulation was extended over the island and over a portion of Maui. A topographic surv.ey was made of Kahoolawe and of Molokini islands and of the southwesterly portion of Maui. Some supplementary topography was done in Hilo Bay. Hydrographic surveys were made around the coast of Kahoolawe, along the southwest coast of Maui, and in Alalakeiki and Kealaikahiki channels. The vessel sailed from Honolulu on March 15 and reached Seattle March 27.

COMBINED OPERATIONS.

PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

G. R. Putnam.

The important work of surveying the coast of the Philippine Islands was continued under the direction of Assistant Putnam, who represented the Superintendent in all matters requiring immediate decision. In performing this duty he adopted plans for field operations, issued instructions for field work, compiled all data secured, and prepared charts of the waters surveyed. :Notices to Mariners and Sailing Directions were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary. During the year the work was prosecuted under the same general plan of division of expense as previously. The United States paid the salaries and subsistence of its technical corps detailed for this duty, including several exper~s in the office; furnished nearly all the instrumental equipment, paid all the expense of operation of one large surveying ves5el, of chart publication, traveling expenses to and from the United States, and a part of the expense of coal and launch hire. The Philippine government paid the other office and field expenses in the islands, including the salaries of the employees in the office in Manila, expense of operating two survey vessels, the building of a new survey vessel, and furnished office accommodations and printing. Money and property accounts were rendered to each government for the resources furnished, respectively, and complete duplicate reports of all work accomplished were rendered to the secretary of the department of commerce and police of the Philippine government, and to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Washington. Mr. Putnam went to the United States in March and returned to Manila in August, 1904. While in Washington many matters affecting the Philippine work were considered and useful information was obtained, particularly in regard to the construction of charts in Manila and their prompt publication in Washington. Under authority from the Secretary of Commerce and Labor he returned to Manila by way of London and Madrid for the purpose of making inquiries regarding British and Spanish surveys in the Philippine Islands. In London he was courteously permitted to examine the original sheets of the surveys made in former years by British vessels within the limits of the islands. In Madrid he was furnished information at the various Government offices regarding the work done by the Spanish in the Philippine Islands, and learned that in general the results of the Government surveys .have all been published. He

was fortunate in meeting, in· Madrid, Mr. Enrique. d' Almonte, the leading Spanish geographer of the Philippines, and secured from him the remainder of his collection of Philippine maps, partly in manuscript. From his inquiries in Madrid he concluded that there is no further unpublished information of geographic value available, except perhaps of an historical nature.
FIELD WORK.

The following is a brief ·summary of the field work done during the fiscal year: l¥estcoast of Luzon.-Triangulation and topography, shore party, July, 1904, W. B. Fairfield, chief of party; January and February, 1905, R. B. :qerickson, chief of party. Mr. Fairfield's work along the coast of Zambales Province was terminated in July, 1904, near Botolan Point, south of Iba, on account of the rainy season. This work was extended to the southward in January and February, 1905, by Mr. Derickson, the topography being carried to Cabingan and the triangulation to Capones Light-house; there remains only a small stretch to complete the topography of the coast of Zambales· Province. Guimaras Strait and coast of Guimaras Island.-General survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, steamer Research, July, 1904, R. B. Derickson, commanding; December, 1904, to June, 1905, W. C. Dibrell, commanding. The surveys of the previous season south of Iloilo were extended, and at the end of the fiscal year the coast of Guimaras Island and of Negros Island, between Bacolod and Binalbagan, and the intervening water area had been practically completed. The former charts of Guimaras Strait were dangerously misleading, channels having been shown where shoals exist and shoals where there are good channels. Because of the many islands much intricate work "\\'.as required around the southern coast of Guimaras. Batangas and Balayan baJ'S and Verde Island Passage, southwest coast of Luzon.General survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, shore party, with. chartered launch Amelia, August, 1904, to February, 1905, William Bowie, chief of party. This survey includes Batangas Bay, Balayan Bay, Port Maricaban, the anchorages off the towns of Batangas, Balayan, and Taal, and the waters surrounding Maricaban Island, including the northern side of Verde Island Passage from Cape Santiago to Matocot Point; Minerva rock, a danger marked as doubtful on the charts, in the· entrance to Balayan Bay, does not exist. Southeasteni part of Ilzgan Bay, north coast of Mfndanao.-General survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, shore party, September, 1904, to January, 1905, 0. W. Ferguson, chief of party. This survey includes the anchorages at Camp Overton, Iligan town, and at Quinalang Cove, the offlying hydrography, and the coast topography from Binuni Point on the westward to the point north of Quinalang Cove. The work was done because of the importance of this vicinity as the entrance to the Lake Lanao country, and the incompleteness and the inaccuracy of existing charts. The military authorities courteously granted the use of the station steam launch for the offshore hydrography, the balance of the work being done with small boats. Northwest coast of Luzon, Poi1it Dile to San Fernando.-Hydrography steamer Pathfinder, November, 1904, to February, 1905, Ferdinand Westdahl, commanding. This survey consisted of filling in the hydrography along the coast and for a few miles offshore, from Vigan to San Fernando, thus completing the survey of the northwest coast of Luzon from Lingayen Gulf to Laoag. Special development was made of Vigan

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

Anchorage, Solbec Cove, Port San Esteban, and Santiago Cove. Also, when leaving this field of' work, a line of deep-s~a soundings was made by the Path.finder from off San Fernando to Iba. North coast 'of .Panay, Sapian Bay, and Aclan River mouth.-General survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, steamer Research, August to November, 1904, R. B. Derickson, commanding. This survey was for the purpose of filling in the unfinished portions of the important stretch of coast between Gapiz and Calivo, the other portions, including 'Port Batan and Capiz Bay, having been finished the previous season. Manila Bay to Lingayen Gulf, triangulati'on through the central valley of Luzon.November, 1904, to June, 1905, W. B. Fairfield, chief of party. This triangulation is for the purpose of connecting in position the coast surveys on the northwest coast of Luzon with those of Manila Bay and to the southward. Incidentally it determines the position of many intermed,iate points in this important valley, which may be used as reference points for other surveys. At the close of the fiscal year the field work had been nearly completed. Manila Bay, lz.ydrography of vicinity of Malabon, and of San Nicolas Banks.-Shore party with chartered.launch Filipinas, November, 1904, to January, 1905, H. M. Trueblood, chief of party. This survey was made for the purpose of filling in and correcting the work of important areas on the Manila and Cavite chart, and on the Manila Bay chart. San Nicolas Beacon was known to be incorrectly located, and this survey developed the fact that San Nicolas Banks were very different from what had been shown. The work off Malabon was for the purpose of filling in a blank area on the local chart and showing the entrance to Malabon. Northeast coast of Samar, vicinity of. Laoang (Laguan).-C".n!neral survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, shore party with chartered launch Comillas, February to June, 1905, O. W. Ferguson, chief of party. The work of this party includes Laguan Bay, Pot1 Palapag, and the neighboring islands and channels. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. A launch was chartered a part of the time to facilitate the work. West coast of Luzon, coast south of Manila Bay, .and dangers near the entrance to Manila Bay.-General survey, hydrography, triangulation, and topography, steamer Fatkomer, March and April, 1905, C. C. Yates, commanding. Thiswork'included the investigation of a shoal marked doubtful, extending from Caballo Island, the investigation of a reported danger off Vigia Point, and the survey of the coast south of Manila Bay to San Diego Point, south of Nasugbu. The rock off Nasugbu,was definitely located, and the reported dangers near Caballo Island and Vigia Point were proven not to exist. The results of this survey will materially improve the chart of the vicinity of Manila. West coast of Luzon, reefs off' Iba and Palauig Bay.-Hydrography, steamer Path.finder, February to March, 1905, Ferdinand W~tdahl, commanding. This work included the location and sounding out of the group of reefs lying to the westward of , Iba, off the coast of Luzon, and the hydrography of the anchorage at Iba and of Palauig Bay, a few miles to the northward of Iba.

70

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

Investigation of dangers near San Bernardino Straits. -Hydrography, steamer Path.finder, April, 1905, Ferdinand Westdahl, command,ing. Because of conflicting reports regarding the position in which the steamer Pharsalia was wrecked, a reconnaissance was made of the vicinity; the wreck ·was found to be lying on the southeastern part of Calantas Bank, the chart being fairly correct. as to the southern extent of this shoal. Soundings were made in Biri Channel, north of Samar, and it was proven that the two doubtful shoals shown as lying near the center of the channel do not exist, thus clearing this useful channel. A good anchorage for safety in a typhoon, east of Biri Island, was developed. East coast of Samar.-General survey, hydrography, topography, and triangulation, steamer Path.finder, April to June, 1905, Ferdinand Westdahl, commanding. Because of the present number of Government vessels going to this coast this work was taken up as early as the monsoon season would permit. Work was commenced in the vicinity of Oras, and at the end of the fiscal year had been extended to Apiton and Hilaban islands, and was in progress. This coast was found to be very crudely represented on existing charts, there being serious errors in distances and relative positions., A small harbor that may be valuable as a refuge was found between Oras and Dolores. East coast of Luzon.-General survey, hydrography, topography, and triangulation, steamer Fathomer, May and June, 1905, C. C. Yates, commanding. The east coast of Luzon is the most poorly charted of the commercially important parts of the islands. In previous seasons surveys were made to include Lagonoy Gulf and the south coast of Catanduanes Islands. The present season's work was commenced at Maqueda Channel, between Catanduanes and Luzon, and the surveys were extended to the north and northwest, and the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Preliminary reports received show that points on the northwest coast of Catanduanes Island and on the islands to the westward of Catanduane5 are in error from 3 to 4 miles, as shown on the present charts. Tidal and magnetic observatz"ons.-In addition to the field work above outlined, observations of tides and currents and of the magnetic declination have been made in connection with the other work, and in addition automatic self-registering tide gauges have been maintained throughout the year at Manila and Iloilo. Survey steamers.-The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Path.finder, after a thorough overhauling at Hongkong, returned to the Philippines November 4, 1904, and has since been continuously at work, except for short intervals when outfitting at Manila. The steamer Research has been contin_uously engaged on field work throughout the year, except f9r short intervals when outfitting or having repairs made. The steamer Fathomer was under construction at Hongkong at the beginning of the fiscal year, under the inspection of C. C. Yates on behalf of the Survey, and also of Lloyd's surveyor at Hongkong, as required by the contract. The trial trip took place at Hongkong on December 10, with the following board acting for the Coast and Geodetic Survey: C. C. Yates, Assistant; J. C. Dow, Nautical Expert; H. C. Liebenow, Inspector of Boilers, city of Manila; E. S. Daniels, Watch Officer, and D. Macdonald, Surveyor to the -British Corporation. The vessel made a speed of 10.5 knots, being 0.5 knot more than contract requirements. The board recommended the acceptance of the vessel on the completion of certain changes and additions to be made by the con-

tractor, and with certain guaranties for a limited time. The Fatkomer was delivered by the contractor in Manila Bay on January 19, 1905, and was immediately taken ovet and plac~d in commission. The steamer was hauled out on the marine railway at Canacao on April 3 and examination made under the guaranties of the builders, and the vessel was finally accepted, all requirements having been fulfilled. The vessel was completed within the amount of the appropriation. In the arrangements for survey work and living quarters the Fatkomer' s design differs materially from existing surveying vessels, and those who have served aboard report that the steamer is conveniently adapted for the purpose intended, and is comfortable for work in the Tropics.
OFFICE WORK.

The office work is done in the following divisions: Computing, Nautical Information, Chart Construction, Hydrographic Verification, and Correspondence and Property. The whole is under the supervision of the Director, who draws up the schemes for field work and for charts, examines the drawings for charts and nautical information .prepared for publication, and makes such further inspection of the work in each line as time permits. Computing Division.-This work continued Ullder the supervision of Mr. E. R. Frisby, Chief Computer, who has been assisted by one computer for the past three months, by two junior computers throughout the year, and by occasional aid from members of the field force temporarily on duty in Manila. The work of this division includes the receipt and register of all survey records (not drawings), and the completion of all computations necessary to put the field records in shape for chart construction or other purpose. The computations made in the field are verified. The principal classes of computations are the reduction of tidal observations and pl1:111es of reference, reduction of astronomic observations for latitude, longitude and azimuth, reduction.of all soundings to mean lower low water, computation of distances, positions and elevations from triangulation, and computation of magnetic declination. Data must constantly be prepared for the use of the field parties in extending surveys, and for the use of the office in plotting hydrographic sheets and in the preparation of charts. · Nautical Information Division.-This work was in charge of J. C. Dow, Nautical Expert, until ·March, 1905, when H. L. Ford, Nautical Expert, took up this duty. The following publications were prepared, verified, and issued:
Notices to Mariners, Nos. 6 to 12 of 1904. Notices to Mariners, Nos. l to 7 of 1905. Sailing Directions, Section III, Coasts of Panay, Negros, Cebu and adjacent islands, edition of 1904. Sailing Directions, Section IV, Coasts of Samar and Leyte and the East Coast of Luzon, edition of 1904· Sailing Directions, Section V, Coasts of Mindanao and adjacent islands, edition of 1905: Catalogue of Charts, Sailing Directions, and Tide Tables of the Philippine Islands, 1905·

Manila being the shipping center of the Philippines, one important duty of the Nautical Expert is to furnish information in response to inquiries regarding charts, sailing directiqns, or other nautical matters. Files of corrected charts and other publications are kept in the office for the benefit of those interested.

72

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

During the latter part of the year the correction of charts was under the: supervision of the Nautical Expert, and a systematic register of these corrections has been established. One or two junior draftsmen are constantly engaged in placing important corrections on the charts from new information, and all charts are thus corrected by hand before being issued. Chart Construction Division.-This work was in charge of J. P. Keleher, Chief Draftsman, except during his absence from October 15 to December 2, 1904, when John Bach, Observer, had charge. Twelve junior draftsmen and three apprentice draftsmen were engaged on this work. The work of the division includes th~ preparation of drawings for new charts and new editions of charts, the completion of unfinished field sheets, as the inking of topographic sheets and the plotting of hydrographic sheets, the preparation of projections for field parties, and of the various miscellaneous drawings. The following drawings for charts were completed during the fiscal year and forwarded to Washington to be printed.

At the close of the fiscal year there were in preparation at Manila drawings for seventeen charts or new editions of charts, of which seven were well advanced. Hydrographic Verification Division.-John Bach, Cartographer, was detailed to this duty in December, 1904. The work consists of the examination and verification of hydrographic sheets, the examination of all survey sheets, and assistance in the verification of drawings for charts, which is indispensable in maintaining a proper standard of accuracy. Correspondence and Property Division.-W. H. MacDonald has continued to act as Chief Clerk, in charge of routine business of the Office, including property returns, the

first checking of vouchers, time records, distribution of .publications; requisitions, forwarding instruments and supplies to field parties, stationery, etc. William Auerbach was appointed as clerk in September, 1904, and he has since acted as stenographer and assisted in the clerical work, and one junior clerk was employed part of the year to assist in copying. The Office force consists of the following:. Chiefs of Divisions and Chief Clerk, 5; Computers, 3; Clerks, 2; Draftsmen, 16; Messehger, l; total, 27. Distribution efpublications.-During the fiscal year about 6 ooo charts were sent out from the Manila office, either for official use or for sale. Of this number about l 500 chartS'were furnished to the Navy and about 2 200 charts to various departments of the Philippine government. About 9 ooo copies of Notices to Mariners and about 2 200 copies of Sailing Directions were distributed during the year to nautical men, shipping companies,. and others interested. Valuable information has been received from the civil, military, and naval officials, and from commercial and private sources, among which ma:y be menti01;ied especially reports from Coast Guard vessels, the Light-House Service, Arny Transport Service, Customs Service, Bureau of Engineering, Office of Port Works, etc. Verbal and manuscript information, skt!tches and blueprints were furnished by this Office in response to various inquiries and requests. Additional vessels for survey work.-At the close of the fiscal year, under authorization of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor and of a resolution of the Philippine Commission, arrangement was made for the transfer of two Coast Guard vessels for survey work, to be operated under an extension of the joint arrangement.

The survey of Batangas and Balayan bays was assigned to Assistant Bowie. He left Manila on August 23 and reached Batangas on the following day. Field work began immectiately. A base line was measured and the necessary signals were erected. The triangulation was completed on September 20 and the hydrographic work began on the 26th. On November 19 the survey of Batangas Bay and approaches, including the eastern half of Maricaban Island, was completed and the party moved to a camp on the eastern shore of Balayan Bay. The work was continued and on February 25 the survey of Balayan Bay and the western half of Maricaban Island was completed. The positions and elevations of all peaks and hills near the coast were determined by triangulation or with the plane table. The triangulation has lines from which it can be extended in any direction. A large steam launch was used with great success by the party. During the six months spent on this work, the party lived in camp on Batangas and Balayan bays. The inhabitants were friendly and nothing was molested by them dqring the season. In several instances they put up signal poles which had fallen down. The natives of this section are industrious if given fair compensation.

pleted the work between Capiz and Port Batan, and the survey is now continuous between Nipa Point in the vicinity of Capiz to New Washington, formerly called Luga tic. The only serious interruption to the work was during the period July 23 to August 2 I, when necessary repairs were being made to the ship. On October 31 the work on the north coast of Panay was suspended on a{:count of the change in the monsoon, and the vessel proceeded to Iloilo. On November 12 the survey of the southern end of Guimaras Straits was resumed. The old triangulation points were recovered and the necessary signals were erected and the positions of the stations needed in the work below Luceran Light were determined. The work was continued until December 8, when the command of the ship was turned over to Assistant W. C. Dibrell. The account of the work after this date is given under his name. In January the extension of the coast triangulation and topography south from Iba, Luzon, was assigned to Assistant Derickson. He proceeded to Iba on January 4 and recovered triangulation points in the vicinity. The triangulation was extended south to Capones Light-house and a reconnaissance was begun up the San Marcelino Valley to extend the triangulation to Subic, but not completed. The topographic survey of the shore line, main road, and adjacent mountains was extended from a point near the mouth of Bucao River to Cabangan. The work closed on February 28.

The continuation of the survey of Guimaras Strait was assigned to Assistant Dibrell, and he took command of the steamer Research at Iloilci. The triangulation was extended from the work already done along the southern and southwestern shore of the Strait. It was also extended to southeast acro8s the Strait to the west coast of Negros and northward of Inampulugan Island across the Strait to Negros. A base line was measured to check the work on the west coast of N egros oq the beach near Pulupandan. The position of the mountain peaks visible from the stations were determined whenever the clouds permitted. A. topographic survey was made from Lusaran Point to Dolores Point, joining work already completed at both ends. The topograph_ic work was completed from Binalbagan northward to a junction with the survey south of Vallodolid. The survey of the east coast of Guimaras Strait was then extended by completing about 8 miles of coast and joining the work already done in this region. The survey of the west coast of N egros, north of Pandan, was in progress on June 30. The hydrographic work was completed in Guimaras Strait from Binalbagan to Bacolod, and the area west of Binalbagan and south of Guimaras Island was also surveyed. A self-registering tide gauge was in operation on the southeast coast of Guimaras Island, but the record was not continuous until May l, as no regular keeper could be engaged until that time. On June 26 this gauge was moved to the village of Nobatas, on the north coast of Guimaras Island. A record was also obtained on a self-registering ·gauge at Iloilo. Strong northeast winds prevailed in December, usually blowing day and night. Changing light winds in January. Strong northeast wind again prevailed in February until the middle of the month, when the weather became favorable for work and continued so until the end of April. In May the wind blew strong from the north until the monsoon changed at the end of the month, when the weather was again favorable. There was no rain until June, and the unusually dry season caused delay in making it necessary for the ship to visit Iloilo every ten days for water, which could not be obtained near the working ground.

outfit. The entire outfit had to be packed by men from 8 to 10 miles to reach the stations at the west end of the valley, and in some places there were no trails. The Observer remained at the stations with a very light outfit while making the observations and suffered a good deal in bad weather. All water used had to be packed from 1 ~ to 3 miles. Rainy weather prevailed in June and made the rice fields almost impassable to the men carrying the outfit. A base line 5 miles long was selected near Lingayen and permanently marked. The positions of all bell towers to churches and other prominent objects and mountain peaks visible from the stations were determined. Most of the churches are large stone buildings and many of the bell towers can be occupied as stations. The Negritos in the mountains were very timid and hard to catch, but proved to be good workmen as packers. · The Observer expresses his appreciation of the aid extended to him by the treasurers and supervisors in the several provinces, who did all in their power to advance the wmk. · The work was in progress on June 30.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

The survey of the southeastern portion of Iligan Bay, Mindanao, was assigned to Assistant Ferguson. He reached Camp Overton, Mindanao, on Septemher 23, and began work immedi. ately. A hydrographic survey was made of the anchorages at Camp Overton and Iligan and of Quinalang Cove. The topographic survey covered the coast from Binui Point on the westward to the point north of Quinalang Cove. The work was completed on January 17. The military authorities courteously granted the use of the station steam launch for the offshore hydrography, and the remainder of the hydrographic work was done by using small boats. On March 2 Mr. Ferguson and the party under his direction began the survey of the northeast coast of Samar in the vicinity of Laoang. A base line was measured and an azimuth was determined. The triangulation was extended to cover the harbor and the neighboring islands. A hydrographic survey was made of the harbor and off the entrance to the harbor. There are numerous islands in this vicinity with many wide bays and channels between them, and numerous rivers :fl.owing into the sea. The shores are covered with a dense growth, which delayed the progress of the triangulatioii and forced the topographic party to work in the water a good deal of the time. A dangerous shoal was located west of the northern portion of Cahayagan Island 4 miles offshore. A self-registering tide gauge was maintained at Laoang. The work was in progress on June 30.

531 miles lines sounded. 913 soundings ~ade.

The extension of the hydrographic work i~ Manila Bay was assigned to Aid Trueblood. He chartered a launch and began work on November 8 in the vicinity of Malabon. Signals were erected and additional positions were determined. The work of signal building was unusually laborious on account of the extensive mud flats which extend offshore in this region. The work of sounding· began on the 12th, and was continued until December 2, when the work was completed. The tide observations made at Manila were used to deduce the plane of reference for the soundings. No statistics for this work were given in Mr. Trueblood's report. On December 7 the hydrographic survey of Sau Nicolas Banks, in Manila Bay, was begun. A tide staff was erected at the entrance of Naic River, and levels were run to a bench mark established in the vicinity. The work was completed on January 2 I'. The work was delayed by wind and rain during December. The statistics g1ven above refer to the work on San Nicolas Banks. The shape of these banks was developed and proved to be very different from that shown on the published chart. The position of San Nicolas Beacon was determined.

Surveys in various portions of the Philippine Islands were assigned to Assistant Westdahl. He reached Solvec Cove on the west coast of Luzon on November 5 and began work immediately. A hydrographic survey was made along the ~oast, which consisted of completing the unfinished work alongshore and for a few miles offshore, from Vigan to San Fernando, thus completing the survey of the northwestern coast of Luzon from Lihgayen Gulf to Laoag. A special development was made of Vigan Anchorage, Solbec Cove, Port San Esteban, and Santiago Cove, and a line of deep-sea soundings was made from San Fernando to Iba. A group of reefs lying to the westward of Iba was located and developed by sounding, and the hydrography of the anchorage at Iba and of Palauig Bay. The work referred to above was completed on March 9. It was continued, whenever the weather permitted, from Nove.mber 5 to the date stated, except for the periods December 8 to 9 and January 28 to February, when the vessel was absent to procure coal and stores. On April 13 work in San Bernardino Strait and on the east coast of Samar was taken up and was continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. The position of the wreck of the steamer -Pharsalia in San Bernardino Strait was determined, and a reconnaissance was made of the vicinity. Soundings were made in Biri Channel, north of Samar, and it was proven that the two doubtful shoals shown on the charts as lying near the center of the channel do not exist. East of Biri Island a good anchorage for safety in a typhoon was developed. A general survey \Vas made along the east coast of Samar ·from the vicinity of Oras to Apiton and Hilaban islands. A small harbor, valuable as a harbor of refuge, was

found between Oras and Dolores. The work along the coast of Samar was delayed and rendered more difficult by the hostility of the natives, who were fighting the authorities. A good deal of the time the parties sent to work on shore were accompanied by a military escort, which was regarded as necessary by the commanding officer of the Philippine Scouts, who was conducting military operations in this region. This officer kindly issued the instructions necessary to secure these escorts. On May 20 and 21 the vessel was engaged in transporting troops, in response to a request from the commanding officer at Oras, from Oras to Borongan and return, as no other steamer was available. · .In response to a request from the commanding officer, on June 7 assistance was rendered to the U. S. gunboat Paragua, which had gone ashore on a reef between Apiton Island and Binugayen Point.

H. C. Graves.

The collection of the data necessary for the publication of a Coast Pilqt of Porto Rico was assigned to Nautical Expert Graves. He proceeded to Porto Rico on the steamer Explorer and was afforded all necessary assistance by the commanding officer, Assistant R. L. Faris. During the period March 25 to May 15 the Explorer was engaged in Coast Pilot work in the vicinity of Porto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, Desecheo, and Mona islands. 'fhe Explorer was taken into every harbor and anchorage around these islands that a: vessel of her draft could enter, and the sailing lines into them were checked and notes on ranges, prominent features, and shoals were made for the Coast Pilot. Masters of vessels, pilots, and other local authorities were consulted .for information as to anchorages, channels, usual sailing tracks of vessels, supplies, winds, currents, and other ·general information. The captains of the ports were consulted for information as to harbor regulations anP. pilotage. The officers of the United States Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service gave information as to local quarantine practices and anchorages, and the local United States Weather Bureau officials supplied data in regard to winds and weather. · At all the principal ports a special inquiry was made of the best local authorities available for information as to geographical names and their proper spelling. The deputy collectors of customs, captains of ports, pilots, and in one case (Vfoques) the alcalde, supplied information of this character. Current observations were made in Vieques Passage, in Guanajibo Channel on the west coast of Porto Rico, and in Mona Passage, near the edge of the bank off the west coast of Porto Rico. At each station observations were made on selected days, both when the moon was near zero and n\aximum declination. Current observations were also made in the sound between Culebra and ¢ulebrita islands while a hydrographic party was examining Windward Passage. Photographs were made of the prominent features of the islands for views for the Coast Pilot.

On July l the work of remarking the boundary line between the United States and Canada was in progress, under the direction of the Depart~ent of State, with Messrs. O. H. Tittmann, Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and C. D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, as Commissioners representing the United States, and with W. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian Department, as Commissioner representing the British Government. Messrs. C. H. Sinclair and E. C. Barnard were assigned to the immediate charge of the work in the field, representing the United States Commissioners, and the following statement covers the work done by the parties under them during the season of 1904: Parties were organized at Gateway, Mont., Porthill, Idaho, and Laurier, Wash., during the early part of May, 1904, and were all disbanded before the middle of November. The vista along the boundary was cleared for a distance of 84 miles, zo miles between Mooyie River and Porthill, 61 miles between the Samilkameen and Skagit rivers, and 13 miles between Cascade and Midway, British Columbia. Twenty-five preliminary sites for boundary monuments were located. Twenty-five aluminum bronze monuments were set in concrete between Frozen Lake and the high ridge between the forks of Yaak River and twenty-five between Laurier, Wash., and Midway, British Columbia. The topographic work was completed from the Samilkameen River to Skagit River, a distance of 61 miles, and from Laurier to Danville, a distance of 13 miles. It extends 2 miles on both ~ides of the boundary line. The triangulation was completed from the vicinity of Cascade to Skagit River, a distance of l4I miles, and a reconnaissance was made to extend the triangulation to Monument No. 1, on the summi\ of the Rocky Mountains. Leveling was done between Barron, Wash., and the boundary at Pasayten River, a distance of 35 miles, and the elevation of the base line near Danville, Wash., was determined by a line of levels s miles long.

ALASKA BOUNDARY.

The work of tracing and marking the boundary line between Alaska and Canada as laid down in the award of. the Alaska Boundary Tribunal at London in 1904 was ~ontinued, with 0. H. Tittmann, Superintendent Coast and Geodetic Survey, and W. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian Department of Interior, as members of. the Delimitation Commission, representing the United States and Great Britain, respectively. Messrs. Fremont Morse and J. A. Flemer were in charge of parties at work on July 1, and on July 29 another party was organized at Skagway, under charge of Mr. 0. M. Leland, for work in the vicinity of White Pass. Mr. Morse cleared a portion of the line north from the Stikine River. He established four permanent monuments on the boundary lin,_e, one on the north bank of tfte Stikine River, one five-eighths of a mile back from the river, on high ground, one on the summit of Elbow Mountaip (Peak 4235 of the award), and one on the s,ummit of Peak 4300 (Peak 4200 of the award). . A topographic sketch was made of the vicinity of the cleared portion of the line, and several peaks in the neighborhood of the work were connected by triangulation. Numerous photographs were made of the boundary line, showing the monuments in position and the mountain peaks on the line or in its vicinity. ' Mr. Morse reports his appreciation of the courtesies extended to him by Mr. WhiteFraser, chief of the Canadian party at work in the vicinity, am:l by Mr. F. E. Bronson, deputy collector of customs at Wrangell. The work closed for the season on September 30. On May J7 Mr. Morse resumed work on the Alaska-Canada boundary in the vicinity of Unuk River with Messrs. Netland and Mosheim as his assistants. Mr. J. D. Craig accompanied the party ~ the representative of the British Government. The work was in progress on June 30. Mr. Flemer was at work on the boundary on July 1, with Messrs. D. W. Eaton, J. M. Donn, and Edmund Polk as assistants. The triangulation of the lower Chilkat River was connected with the boundary peaks near Pleasant Camp in the Tlehini Valley. A vista was cut along the boundary line across Glave Creek Valley and five monuments were erected on the line, three on the south side and two on the north side of the stream. Eleven triangulation stations and five camera stations were occupied in this vicinity. The geographi~ positions of boundary peaks Nos. 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, and 55 were determined and they were connected with the triangulation of the upper Chilkat River. The point designated as No. 54 is in the Tlehini Valley just below Pleasant Camp. Numerous photographs of the line and peaks in its vicinity were made. Work was suspended for the season on October 19, when the party started to Seattle, Wash., and reached that place on October 24. Mr. Flemer resumed work on the boundary on May 17, with D. W. Eaton as assistant,_and continued it until the close of the fiscal year. The weather was_unfavorable and slow progress was made.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERA TIO NS.
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.
ANDREW BRAID,

Assistant in Cllarge.

The Assistant in Charge of the Office has direct supervision of the work of the different divisions of the Office.. The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate Office of the Assistant in Charge.
COMPUTING DIVISION.

The work of furnishing information to the field parties of the Survey and to persons outside the Survey in reply to requests occupied a considerable portion 'of the time of the Chief of the Division, nearly all the time of the Writer, and 13 per cent of the time of the other members of the Division. The time required for this work is greater than ever before and is increasing rapidly. The manuscript of the following appendices to the Report for 1904 was completed . and the proof was read:
No. No. No. No. 6. 7. 8. 9. Precise Leveling from Red Desert, \Vyoming, to Owyhee, Idaho, 1903 (30 pages). Precise Leveling, Holland to New Braunfels, Tex., 1903 ( 20 pages). A test of a transit micrometer {38 pages). Triangulation in California, Part I (274 pages).

Aside from the routine computations the progress made in the more important computations during the year may be stated as follows: 1. The computation of precise leveling has kept pace with the field work, being kept nearly up to date continuously. 2. The recomputation and reduction to the United States Standard Datum of the triangulation in the southern part of California was completed and considerable progress made in similar computations for the portion of California north of Monterey Bay. The computations of the main scheme of triangulation in northern California are complete, but there are several hundred points not in the main scheme yet to be computed. 3. The computations connected with a new ·investigation of the form of the geoid in the United States have made considerable progress. The computation of the topographic corrections to observed deflections of the vertical to take account of the topography for a radius of more than 4 ooo kilometers around each station has beeli completed during the year for about 230 astronomic stations. This leaves only 70 more stations immediately available for such treatment. The general plan in studying the form of the geoid by measures within the United States is to divide the whole mass of data available into four groups corresponding to four separate areas, to investigate each
91

92

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

group separately, and then combine the four groups in one large group in deriving the final results. The investigation has been carried nearly to completion in three of the four groups. Records are kept in the Division from which the cost of the different classes of work done in the Division Ca.n be ascertained. The average effective force of the Division during the year amounted to eleven ·persons, in addition to the Chief, which is somewhat smaller than during the previous year. The number of pages of correspondence prepared in the Division was somewhat less than during the preceding year, but the number of geographic positions furnished in response to requests was 23 per cent greater and the number of descriptions of stations was 15 per cent greater than during any previous year.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAQNETISM.

Though 15 men have been detailed for temporary duty in the Division, their aggregate time amounted to not much over a year, and as some of them required instruction in computing and observing, the effective time was certainly less than that of one man continuously employed. The revision of the computation of the magnetic observations made by the various field parties was kept nearly up to date. The results of the field observations made during the preceding fiscal year were submitted for publication as Appendix 3 of the Superintendent's Report for 1904, and the proof of that appendix was read. The discussion of the magnetic observatory records was begun. The tabulation of hourly values of declination and horizontal intensity for Baldwin for the three years 1902-1904 were nearly completed. On account of the makeshift character of the observatory building at Baldwin, and the consequent large range of temperature and comparatively frequent readjustment of instruments, it seemed desirable to verify the general character of the variations by comparison with Cheltenham before making the final reductions of horizontal intensity. The Cheltenham records were therefore taken in hand and considerable progress made. The tabulation of results at all stations occupied more than once up to June 30, 1904, was completed. This showed that the reversal of secular motion of declination during the past ten years apparently extended over all but the extreme eastern part of the country. A preliminary isogonic chart of the Philippines was prepared; based on the observations of the Coast Survey and of the Jesuits. A preliminary investigation was· made of the change in the earth's magnetism between the years 1885 and 1895, treating the subject analytically. The necessary explanatory data were prepared to accompany reproductions of the magnetograms of the Cheltenham Observatory for the days on which magnetic storms occurred, for transmission to foreign observatories. Lists were prepared of the '' quiet '' days at all the magnetic observatories of th~ Coast and Geodetic Survey, and transmitted to Dr. Mauritz Snellen, in accordance with the resolution of the International Committee on Terrestrial Magnetism.

The data for the earthquakes recorded by the seismographs of the Coast Survey up to the end of 1904 were read and tabulated. A preliminary discussion was made of the results of atmospheric electricity observations at Cheltenham.
TIDAL DIVISION.

· Harmonic analyses were computed for l 1 stations, with an aggregate length of 4.Vz years. Nonharmonic reductions were made for 103 stations, with an aggregate length of 33 years. The plane of reference for reduction of soundings was determined for 61 stations. Tide notes were prepared for 407 stations upon 102 charts and 43 original hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was furnished to the field parties and in response to requests from individuals not connected with the Survey in 288 instances, involving the preparation of 476 descriptions of bench marks, tidal data for 31 stations, and current data for 3 l stations. About 13 years of self-registering tide-gauge records from 18 stations wen~ tabulated as high and low waters and also as hourly heights of the sea. There were received, examined, and registered in this Division an aggregate of about 30 years of record from self-registering gauges at 28 stations, together with about 4 years of record from box and staff gauges. Tidal records and data from outside sources were' received as follows:

Foreign countries.
Argentina: Tides for l month at 1 station and tide readings for 6 years at 2 stations. Australia: Staff readings for 1 .Vz years at 2 stations and hannonic constants for l station. Bermuda: Hourly readings for J year at l station. China: Staff readings for 4 years at 2 stations. Egypt: l month of high and low waters at l station. France: Harmonic constants for 7 stations. Germany: Record from self-registering gauge for 2 months at 2 stations, staff readings for 2 years at 4 stations, and harmonic constants for l station. Great Britain: Staff readings for 6 years at 3 stations. Italy: Staff readings for 5.Vz years at 7 stations. Japan: Hourly heights for 3 months at r station and harmonic constants for r station. Liberia: Staff readings for r month at r station. Mexico: Staff readings for 5 years at 27 stations. New Zealand: Staff readings for 1 year at 1 station and harmonic constants for 1 station. Spain: Staff readings for 12 years at l l stations. The Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, loaned the Survey the record for 16 years with self-registering gauges at 4 stations and high and low water readings for 2 .Vz years at 1 station. One year's record of a self-registering gauge was procured at Nassau, Bahama Islands.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

One year's record of a self-registering gauge was received from Honolulu, Hawai~. At the request of the Canadian government the predicted tides at Astoria~ Oreg., and Sitka, Alaska, for 1906 were furnished. At the request of the Secretary of the Marine Department of New Zealand the predicted tides at Wellington and Auckland for 1906, and the tidal differences for the principal ports of the country, were furnished. Appendix No. 5 to the Annual Report for 1904, "Cotidal lines for the world," 88 pages with 41 charts, was completed for printing and the proof was read. Nearly all the proof of the tide tables for 1905 (516 pages) was read. The manuscript for the tide tables for 1906 was prepared for printing and the proof of l 7 3 pages was read before the close of the fiscal year.
DRAWING AND ENGRAVING DIVISION.

The Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section executes the work indicated by its title, and the combined result is shown on' the charts published and issued by the Survey. During the year 350 requests for information were received and answered in the Division. These involved the measurement of areas and shote line and distances between various points, the preparation of tracings from original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, and the construction of special maps.

In addition to the foregoing, 570 charts were revised (including second and third editions of the same chart), corrected, and verified for new editions or new prints; 23 projections for topographic sheets and 54 hydrographic sheets were constructed for the use of field parties or the Office; 381 topographic and hydrographic sheets were inked, plotted, revised, or made ready for the approval of the Office. The illustrations required for the Annual Report of the Superintendent for the year 1904 were completed. Information was compiled in response to numerous· requests for information from persons outside the Survey. The publication of the charts in the Philippine

Islands required the time of two draftsmen continuously. Most of the drawings for these charts were prepared at the Manila suboffice. They were carefully examined and verified, and were completed by adding titles, notes, compasses, etc., in this section. Two young Filipino students were sent to Washington for instruction by the Philippine government and have been attached to this section since February. They ·have made rapid progress in acquiring knowledge of the work of the section. All the charts covering Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River were carefully revised and improved, using all the old hydrographic sheets in this region in connection with the results of the recent resurveys.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905. INSTRUMENT DIVISION.

In this Division an account was kept of all instruments and general property owned by the Survey or purchased during the year; 1 825 instruments of various classes were put in order, adjusted, and sent to the field. Minor repairs were made to the Office buildings and furniture, and progress was made in constructing a new tide predicting machine. For the purpose of providing the Director of Coast Surveys in the Philippine Islands with a standard for the comparison of base tapes, one of the tapes which had been used in the base measurement of nine bases on the ninety-eighth meridian, and the length of which is therefore very accurately known, was fitted with appliances for suspension under standard tension, side by side with the one to be compared. These appliances were designed and made in the Instrument Division and forwarded to Manila with the tape. The theodolites of magnetometers Nos. 10, 11, 17, and 19 having become much worn from use, and being for other reasons inadequate for the convenient and accurate determination of azimuth, new ones were purchased and fitted to these instruments. A new magnetometer, known as Coast and Geodetic Survey No. 29, was constructed. The wooden magnet box of the old ''Bache Fund'' magnetometer and a magnet, formerly belonging to magnetometer No. 19, were utilized in the construction of this instrument. During the year an automatic printing recorder for a Quick Sounding Machine was designed and made. A hotel time stamp was purchased and utilized in the making uf this apparatus, which furnishes a record upon a continuous band.of paper of the month, day, hour, minute, a. m. or p. m., fathoms, feet, and tenths of feet of each sounding made. Transits Nos. 4, 18, and 19 were provided with transit micrometers and other appliances incident to this improvement. Electrical illumination of field instruments, which heretofore only found limited application, owing to the difficulties accompanying the use of liquid batteries, was this year applied in the case of transits Nos. 18 and 19, meridian telescopes Nos. 1 and 3, and zenith telescopes Nos. 2 an<l 6. This was possible on account of the improvements which have been made in the quality of certain dry cells sold in the market. There were completed in the early part of this fiscal year two additional plane tables of the same design and material as those of No. 91, described in the last report. One of these has been thoroughly tested in the field and found so superior to the older form, by reason of its redu~ed weight and added rigidity, that the aluminum alloy known as Ennis's No. 1 can be said to mark a distinct step ahead in the art of making surveying instruments. The unusually severe winter of 1904-5 afforded. an opportunity to prove the efficiency of the float tube of the electric tide indicator of the New York Maritime Exchange, which was designed specially with the view of preventing interruption of the working of the apparatus by ice impeding the free motion of the float. Though other float tubes required attention during the severe freezing spells of that winter, this one never failed to operate, though left entirely to itself. A plan permitting the application of the same principle even in such localities where there is not sufficient depth of water to afford the requisite vertical space for a

column of petroleum equal in height to the distance between extreme high and low waters was devised. This plan is based upon the idea of sinking the tube, the lower end of which is closed, into the bottom to the necessary depth, and to establish_ communication between the interior of the tube and the outside by means of a small pipe, entering at the side somewhere below the lowest low water and reaching down to within an inch or two from the bottom of the tube, thus preventing the loss of oil even at the lowest low water. Mr. Fischer made several visits to Pittsburg to inspect different lots of monuments when they were ready for shipment to the United States and Canada boundary, west of the Rocky Mountains, and to the Alaska and Canada boundary. He also supervised the construction, by a private firm, of transit micrometers for two transits belonging to the Canadian government, and repairs to the same instruments. He served on the jury of awards at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in the group including scientific and measuring instruments.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES.

The routine work in the libr.ary was kept up to date. The records of the observations made in the field were indexed as they were received. Assistant Eimbeck was assigi1ed to the Division as Acting Librarian and continued in this position from July r to August 3 I. Mr. Guittard, the J_,ibrarian, reported for duty on September r.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS MADE BY THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY BETWEEN JULY l, 1904, AND JUN:E 30, 1905.
By L. A.
BAUER,

Inspector of Magnetic Work and Chief of Division Terrestrial Magnetism, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic .Survey.

INTRODUCTION.

'l"he present publication contains the results of the magnetic observations made on land and at sea by members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the pro~ecution of the magnetic survey of the United States and outlying territories during the period July l, 1904, to June 30, 1905.* There are also included the results of some observations made by magnetic observers of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution, who were temporarily attached to parties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for purposes of instruction, and some made in Louisiana by Prof. G. D. Harris of the Louisiana Geological Survey, with an instrumentloaned to liim by this Bureau. Five magnetic observatories t have been in continuous operation throughout the year: At Cheltenham, Md.; Baldwin, Kans.; Sitka, Alaska; near Honolulu, Hawaii; on Vieques Island, Porto Rico.
OBSERVATIONS ON LAND AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The distribution of the stations on land is shown in the following table, from which it will be seen that the work of the year was principally in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, and Oklahoma, with a· 1 few stations in each of 3 l other States and Territories.

There have now been obtained precise magnetic data for determining both the distribution of the magnetic elements and their secular change in every State and Territory of the United States at a sufficient number of stations to warrant the early publication of a new set of magnetic charts, viz, for the year 1905. The construction of these charts necessarily involves a rediscussion of all available secular variation data and the preparation of a new set of tables. This work is now in progress. Some results of a preliminary discussion of the declination data are considered of sufficient importance to be published herewith, in advance of the full report.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

SECULAR CHANGE OF MAGNETIC DECLIXATIOX

The magnetic survey of Louisiana, which was completed in 1904, developed the fact that, contrary to expectation, the declination had reached a minimum in that State about the year 1898, and has since been increasing, and there were indications of a similar reversal of the secular motion at other places in the interior of the country. On the Pacific coast it was supposed that east declination had reached a maximum about ten years ago, but the reoccupation of several old stations in the spring of 1904 showed that east declination had been increasing quite rapidly since 1897. In view of these facts, more than the usual number of old stations were selected for reoccupation in planning the field work for the fiscal year 1904-5, and although on account of changed local conditions many of the old stations were no longer available, a sufficient number were reoccupied exactly or approximately to give a general idea of the secular change of the magnetic declination during the past 5 or 10 years. The results are presented in the following table. The letters after the names of stations indicate: (a) that the old station was reoccupied exactly, (b) that it was reoccupied approximately, and (c) that the new station was some distance (half a mile or more) from the old one.

A tabulated value of annual change refers approximately to the middle of the period from which it is deduced. A plus sign indicates increasing east declination or decreasing west declination, and a minus sign the reverse. It appears that the line of no annual change does not differ much from the agonic line, and that in general both east and west declination are increasing. On the Atlantic coast the annual increase of \\'est declination is probably not more than r' in Maine, but rises to more than 31 from Rhode Island to New Jersey, and then decreases to zero in
*Mean of observations in Dccctnber, 1904, and January, 1905.

APPENDIX 3.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Georgia and Florida. At the Porto Rico Magnetic Observatory, on Vieques Is1and, west declination is increasing ~t the rate of about 7' per year. In Mississippi and Alabama east declination is increasing about 2' per year, and along the who1e Pacific coast the increase appears to be as. much as 3' per year.
OBSERVATIONS AT SEA AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION.

The policy of making magnetic observations at sea as often as the regular surveying duties of the ships of the Bureau would permit has been continued. Observations were made on the Bache during her cruises from Norfolk, Va., to Maine and return, and from Norfolk to Colon, Canal Zone, and return; on the Blake on the cruise between Norfolk and Maine and return; on the Explorer on the cruise to Porto Rico and return; on the Patterso"n on the way from Kiska, Alaska, to Honolulu, and from Honolulu to Seattle, Wash. Some observations were secured also by the McArtlmr and GedneJ' in connection with the work in Alaska. The Carnegie Institution of Washington, through its Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, has undertaken a systematic magnetic survey of the oceanic areas. The Bac/1e, Patterson, and Explorer are each provided wi.th a Lloyd-Creak dip circle and accompanying gimbal stand, by means of which dip and relative intensity can be determined on board ship, and the Blake was similarly equipped until she went out of commission in the fall of r 904. The other vessels of the Survey are not well adapted for magnetic work, on account either of small size or steel construction. They have not been supplied with Lloyd-Creak dip circles, therefore, nor have many declination results been obtained by them. Observations for declination are made with the usual standard liquid compass and an azimuth circle of the Ritchie or Negus pattern. Each value of declination, Jip, or intensity usually depends upon the mean of observations made on 8 or r 6 equi-distant headings while steaming in a circle, once with port and once with starboard helm. In some cases, ho,vever, observations were made on three headings, namely, on the course, one or two points to starboard of the course, and then a like amount to port. Summary

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

GENERAL METHODS OF OBSERVING.
LAND WORK.

The methods of observing have been the same as those described in previous publications. Observers engaged exclusively in magnetic work are supplied with a complete magnetic outfit, consisting of theodolite-magnetometer, dip circle, half-second pocket chronometer, an observing tent, and small accessories, while those who are expected to get magnetic results incidental to other work are supplied with more or less complete outfits, according to circumstances. Where only declination results can be secured under the conditions involved, a compass declinometer is supplied; but to those who can atte1i1pt more, a dip circle wi~h compass attachment is furnished, with which compact outfit, knowing the azimuth of some reference mark from triangulation or other source, the declination, dip, and total intensity (Lloyd's method) can be obtained with a very fair degree of accuracy. During the year se\'eral extended series of observations have been made to test the accuracy of Lloyd's method of determining the relative total intensity with a <lip circle. Observations were made at a large number of stations to determine the total intensity by that method in addition to the usual determination of horizontal intensity with the magnetometer. The following table shows what may be expected of a firstclass instrument, carefully handled. For purposes of comparison, the horizontal intensity has been computed from the dip and total intensity determined with the dip circle. -----·---------- --·----

Dip circle No. 23, using needles 3 and 4, was adopted as a provisional standard for dip circles before an earth inductor had been secured and, though not ne·w, is a very reliable instrument. Needles 3 and 4 were reserved for relative intensity work during the past year and the ''intensity constant'' was determined by observations at the Baldwin Magnetic Observatory in October, 1904. From that time to the dates given above i't was in continuous use under rather trying- conditions of weather and transportation, but an inspection of the table shows not only that the error of observation is small, but also that the "intensity constant" has remained constant for six months. An equally satisfactory showing was made by a new Dover dip circle (No. 169) of Lloyd-Creak pattern belonging to the Carnegie Institution, as will be seen by referring to the tabulation of results in Georgia.

APPEXDIX 3.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

IIS

Dip circle No. 56 did not show up so satisfactorily, nor was it expected to do so, for the instrument and intensity needles were known to be of inferior quality. Even with this dip circle, however, the difference between the results by magnetomeLer and dip circle seldom amounted to 1 part in 200 and averaged about I part in 500.
SEA WORK.

The experience of the Patterson on her trip to Honolulu, and of the Bache on her trip to Colon during the past year has shown that Lloyd's method can not be employed for determining the total intensity on shipboard within a considerable distance of the magnetic equator, at least with the deflecting needle and mounting at present provided. The earth's total force is entirely overcome by the force of the deflecting needle, and the suspended needle ')'ill not take a position of equilibrium at right angles to the deflector. Either the deflecting distance must be increased or the relation of the magnetic moments of the two intensity needles altered. To overcome this difficulty an arrangement has been devised by the Inspector of Magnetic \Vork, which cunte1~1plates the determination of relative horizontal intensity by means of deflections of a standard liquid compass, the deflections being produced by a dip needle or small magnet mounted at a fixed distance above the compass. Observations on land indicated that the angle of deflection could be read with a sufficient degree of accuracy, and the device is in successful use on board the brig Galilee on the preliminary trip of the magnetic survey of the North Pacific Ocean which has been undertaken by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
ACCURACY OF RESULTS.

The endeavor in general is to secure on land declination and dip observations whose absolute error (including everything involved-error of observation and reduction) shall not exceed 2 1 , and that the horizontal intensity be determined within r part in r ooo. The experience of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been that, under all of the conditions involved in a campaign of field work covering a large area, including the standardization of instruments and the determination of reduction errors, this accuracy can not be much reduced. In observatory work with special instruments, or when special investigations are made under the best conditions by special observers, there is no difficulty in reducing these limits of error. But in a large organization, where results must be secured from all kinds of observers, under all conditions, and at times under great physical difficulties, and when all the errors are considered before the results can be utilized, the degree of accuracy stated must be regarded as satisfactory and sufficient. It happens, of course, that these limits, for one reason or another, are occasionally exceeded, and there may be a few isolated cases in which the errors are two or three .times the amounts given. An extended series of observations was made with the compass attached to dip circle No. 56 to test the accuracy of declinations determined with it. From observations at more than 50 stations it was found there were very few cases where the declination results by compass and magnetometer differed by more than 31 , and the difference exceeded 2 1 in less than one-third the total number. This bears out the ~tatement made last year (Appendix 3, Report for 1904), that with proper care the declination can be secured with this simple arrangement correct vl'ithin 2 1 ·

C<;>AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905· COI\IPARISOX OF INSTRUMENTS.

The absolute instruments at the Cheltenham Observatory, comprising declinometer, magnetometer, earth inductor, and theodolite, have been adopted as the ~tandard instruments to which all instruments are referred. During the year special observations were made at Cheltenham to standardize the Lloyd-Creak dip circles Nos. 28, 33, and 35, new Kew-Dover dip circles Nos. 30 and 31, and new magnetometers Nos. 29, 36, and 37, and various other instruments. Numerous comparisons were also made at the Baldwin Magnetic Observatory and at the station in Washington near the Zoolog~cal Park, and individual comparisons were secured at other places where the same station was occupied with different instruments by different observers in the course of their regular field work. These comparisons show that few changes are required in the instrumental constants adopted last year. The various dip circles used and the corrections which have been applied to the results by each are given in the following table. The figures after the decimal in the fourth column indicate, as in the past, the particular needles to which the correction applies-thus 24. 12 means dip circle No. 24, needles 1 and 2:

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC

OBSERVATIO~S.

II7

Magnetometers Nos. 20 and 21 continue to give results for horizontal intensity less than the standard. The same was·found to be true of the two new magnetometers Nos. 36 and 37. The results with these instruments have therefore been corrected as follows: No. 20 +.002 JI No. 21 +.006 H No. 36 +.002 H No. 37 +.003 II Index corrections have been applied to declination results obtained with compass declinometer or compass ·needle. Declihations determined with magnetometer No. 19 have been corrected by the same amount as last year, namely 1 1 .5, decreasing west declinations and increasing east declinations,
REDUCTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS.

A first comi:utation is made by the observer in the field, and he must carry it far enough before he leaves a station to assure himself that the desired degree of accuracy has been attained. This computation is carefully revised in the Office in the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism and the necessary corrections are applied to reduce the results to the standard instruments, as indicated in the foregoing section. Each value of magnetic declination is then corrected to reduce it to the mean of the particular month in which the observation ·was made, with the aid of the continuous observations at the nearest magnetic observatory, allowance being made for the change in diurnal variation with change in magnetic latitude. No attempt has been made to correct the dip and ·horizontal intensity for diurnal variation, for the reasons stated last year. The office work involved in the reduction and revision· of results and preparation for publication was intrusted to Mr. D. L. Hazard, computer.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABLES.
LAND 0BSERVA'rIONS.

The values qf declination, dip, anci horizontal int~nsity presented in Table I are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the order of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic coordinates were scaled from the best available map, either the United States Geological Survey topographic sheets, a Post Route map, or a Rand & McNally State map. In such cases only the nearest whole minute ~f latitude and longitude is given. The horizontal intensilJ' is expressed, as lteretqfore, in terms of the one hundred tlzousandtlt part of a C. G. S. unit of intensity of magnetic force.

In the column headed ''Instruments,'' M stands for ''magnetometer,'' and D. C. for "dip circle." Italicized numbers in the magnetometer column indicate that the declination was determined with a compass declinometer of the number given. When the declination was determined with the compass attachment of the dip circle, the letter C is placed in the magnetometer coiumn. The dip circles have been given the designations indicated on page l 16, the figures after the decimal point denoting the needles used. Values of horizontal intensity printed in italics were obtained by combining the observed dip with the total intensity determined by Lloyd's method. The letters B F refer to a small magnetometer called the '' Bache Fund,'' which was used in connection with dip circle No. 27 to detennine the horizontal intensity. The magnet used to deflect the dip needles Nos. 22 and 23 is suspended for oscillations in the Bache Fund magnetometer and was also used to determine the declination. The observer is indicated by the initials of his name. The names of the observers are as follows:

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS. Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wood, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a detailed description, so that the station may be located even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to th~ one used as a reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is given in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained on application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square, set so as to project an inch or two above ground and lettered on top U. S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired and were willing to bear the expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by States and by names of station.

Centendlle, Bibb County.-The station is in the Centerville Cemetery, one-half mile southwest of the town. It is distant 23 feet from a double cedar tree, bearing 6o 0 west of north, 14.4 feet from the wire fence on the east line of the grounds, and· 130.3 feet from the west gate post at the entrance to the cemetery-the northeast corner of the grounds. The station is marked by a limestone post S by 6 by 30 inches, set 29 inches in the ground and lettered U. S. C. & G. S., I90S· The following true bearings were determined:

PRECISE LEVELING FROM RED DESERT, WYOMING, TO SEATTLE, WASH., 1903-4.
By }OHN F. HAYFORD, Inspector ef Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The leveling between Red Desert, Wyoming, and Owyhee, Idaho, was done in 1903 and is reported upon in full in Appendix 6 of the Report for 1904, "Precise Leveling· from Red Desert, \Vyoming, to Owyhee, Idaho.'' \Vhen the elevation brought from the eastward by this leveling wa5 carried fonvard from Owyhee to the tide gauge at Seattle, the discrepancy found, though well within allowable limits, was sufficiently large to make it necessary to distribute it back over the line as far as Red Desert. Hence, it is found desirable in this appendix to show the elevations resulting directly from the leveling between Red Desert and Owyhee, together with the elevations as corrected. The leveling between Owyhee, Idaho, and Hunts Junction, Washington, was done by Mr. F. H. Sewall, Aid, May 5-0ctober 4, 1904, and that between Seattle and Hunts Junction by Mr. G. Clyde Baldwin, Aid, May 7-0ctober l, 1904. The line follows the Oregon Short Line Railroad from Owyhee to Huntington, Oreg.; the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company to Pendleton, Oreg.; the Washington and Columbia River Railroad to Hunts Junction, Washington, and thence the Northern Pacific Railroad to Seattle. The first three railroad companies named facilitated the leveling by allowing Mr. Sewall and his party to use velocipede cars over their lines. The velocipede cars were not used over the Northern Pacific Railroad; the officers of that road, however, showed many favors to Mr. Baldwin and his party which aided them in the1r work. The party slept, but did not get their meals, in a freight car fitted up with bunks which was hauled from siding to siding as the work progressed.
INSTRUMENTS AND

Rons.

Mr. Sewall used precise level No. 8 and Mr. Baldwin No. 7. Both these instruments are of the most recent type and are fully described in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, pages 200-2 1 I. The value of a 2-millimeter division on the level vial of either instrument, No. 7 or No. 8, is slightly less than 2". The telescope of each of these instruments has a clear aperture of 4. 2 centimeters and a focal length of 41 centimeters. Mr. Sewall used rods R. and S. Mr. Baldwin used rods V and W. These rods are of the type described on pages 418-419 of Appendix 8 of the Report for 1899. The rods are of the direct-reading type and carry a centimeter graduation on which readings are made to millimeters by estimation.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, r905.

The lengths of the 3-meter intervals marked on each of the rods by a fine graduation on metallic plugs in its face, as determined by the National Bureau of Standards, before and after the field work and reduced to o° Centigrade, are as follows:

Each rod was measured with a steel tape at least twice each month while in the field. The reading of the rod thermometer was always noted in connection with these measurements, and care was taken that the rods and tape should be at the temperature of the atmosphere, so that reliable comparisons could be made. These measurements were made in order to detect, if possible, any change in the lengths of the rods during the season. They do not gh·e the absolute lengths of the_ rods at any time, as the error. of the tape with which the measurements were made is not known. The National Bureau of Standards' measurements of rods R. and S, used by Mr. Sewall, indicate a slight lengthening of these rods during the season. The field measurements did not fix the time of this lengthening. On the contrary, they indicate a slight shortening during the season of about this same amount. The level computations were made by using the mean length for the two rods as derived from the Bureau of Standards' measurements, namely, 0.35 millimeter per meter too long at o° C. The Bureau of Standards' measurements of the rods V and W, used by Mr. Baldwin, indicate a slight shortening during the season. The field measurements of the rods indicate that this change took place as two sudden changes, between July 6 and July 12 and between August I2 and August 25. Accordingly, the computations were made on the assumption that the rods preserved their length as measured at the Bureau of Standards in April, 1904, until July 7; that their lengths were a mean between the two Bureau of Standards' mea<;urements during the period July 8-August 12, and after August 12 were as shown by the Bureau of Standards' measurements of January, 1905. The three values of the excess of length per meter at o° C. thus used in the computation were, respectively, +0.52, +0.48, and +0.45 millimeter. The index corrections for the rods as determined at \Vashington on April 13, 1904, were as follows, in millimeters: For R,. -0.5; for S, -o.8; for V, -0.4, and for W, -0.4. A new determination of the index corrections of rods V and W, December 22, 1904, agreed with that given above within 0.1 millimeter. . The methods of observation are stated in detail on pages 21 I-222 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903.
FIRST CONNECTION BETWEEN THH ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS BY PRECISE LEVELING.

The level net extending from the Atfantic coast as far west as Cheyenne, Wyo., comprises 48 circuits, including those in which water leveling along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico fornis one side. The principal connections with sea level are at Sandy Hook, N. J., an<f at Biloxi, Miss. This net and its adjustment are fully described in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, "Precise Leveling in the United States." The line of leveling westward from Cheyenne, over the Union Pacific Railroad and connecting lines, is a single line without any checks by circuits, though each portion of the

APPENDIX 4.

PRECISE LEVELING TO SEATTLE.

line was, as usual, leveled at least twice. The computed elevations along the single line, &\arting with the adjusted elevations at Cheyenne, were, as shown in the following tabulation, 2047.6741 meters for bench mark B3 at Red Desert, \Vyoming; 903.6_997 meters for bench! mark \V 4 at Owyhee, Idaho, and the eastarn end of Mr. Sewall's leveling; and 127.5028 meters for bench mark P 3 at the western end of Mr. Sewall's line near Hunts Junction, Washington. Mr. Baldwin began his leveling on bench marks at Seattle, of which the elevation had been fixed with reference to mean sea level at that point by tidal observations, with_ an automatic gauge, during five years, 1899-1903. The computed ele,·ation of bench mark P 3 at the eastern end of his line was found to be 127. 3 153 r:1eters, or 187. 5 millimeters less than that found by Mr. Sewall by leveling from the eastward. Two questions at once arise in connection with this discrepancy. Is it probably due simply to the errors of observations concerned in fixing the elevation of bench mark P 3 ? How shall this discrepancy be distributed in fixing the elevations hereafter to be used as standard for the bench marks along the line from Seattle eastward? The probable error of the elevation of the mean sea-level surface at Seattle, as computed from the eastward from sea-level connections on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, through the precise level net to Cheyenne and the single line of levels to Seattle, is ±. 76 millimeters. The actual discrepancy is two and one-half times as large as this. According to the. doctrine of chances, such a discrepancy, two and onehalf times the probable error, should occur about once in ten times. An observation is not ordinarily rejected m{less the discrepancy is from three and one-half to five times the probable error of the observation. From the point of view of the method of least squares no reason exists, therefore, for believing that this discrepancy is not due simply to errors of observation. The probable error of ±76 millimeters given above takes account of the errors in the tidal observations as well as of the errors in all the leveling concerned. The probable errors of elevations in the level net, as far west as Cheyenne, were computed from the adjustment of the level net and depend upon the discrepancies developed in the 48 circuits in the net. For the line westward from Cheyenne it was assumed that the probable error of a kilometer of completed line is ± 1 .04 millimeters, the value found for leveling of this class in the adjustment of the level net.* The conclusion that the discrepancy of 187.5 millimeters (0.615 foot) is due simply to errors of observation, and moreover, that these errors are exceedingly small, may be emphasized by the following considerations. As already stated, the principal connections with sea level on the eastern coast are at Sandy Hook, N. J., and at Biloxi, Miss. The shortest line of leveling of the highest grade of accuracy between Seattle and Sandy Hook is 7 700 kilometers long (4 800 miles), via Cheyenne, \Vyo., Sioux City, Iowa, St. Louis, Mo., Chicago, Ill., through Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie, and by Oswego, N. Y. If it is assumed that the discrepancy is an accumulated error of leveling through this line, the average rate of accumulation is 0.025 millimeter per kilometer ( l foot in 7 700 miles). The shortest line of leveling of the highest grade of accuracy from Seattle to Biloxi is 5 700 kilometers long ( 3 500 miles), via Cheyenne, \Vyo., Norfolk, Nebr., Abilene, Kans., Fort Worth, Tex., and Shreveport, La. If it

be assumed that the discrepancy is an accumulated error of leveling through this line, the average rate of accumulation is 0.033 millimeter per kilometer ( 1 foot in 5 7~0 miles). The results of the tidal observations at Seattle are as follows:

The mean is r 3. 8846 feet= 4. 2320 meters±o.008 meter. The elevations given in this appendix for bench marks Tidal 4, Tidal 5, F anP. G near the tide gauge depend upon the above determination of mean sea level. l\'Iean sea level was fixed, as used in the adjustments of the precise level net, by six years of tidal observations at Sandy Hook anti by five years at Biloxi. The total range in the six annual means at Sandy Hook was 0.098 meter (0.322 foot), and in the five annual means at Biloxi, 0.030 meter ( o. r oo foot). E\'iclently the tidal observations contributed but a small portion of the errors which combined make up the discrepancy of 187. 5 millimeters. Evidently, also, it is unnecessary in order to account for the discrepancy to assume that mean sea level on the Pacific is at a different elevation from that on the Atlantic and Gulf; or, more specifically, that mean sea level is at different elevations at Seattle, Biloxi, and Sandy Hook. The discrepancy found is within the possible limits of error of the precise leveling alone, even though it be assumed that the leveling in question is of as high a grade of accuracy as any yet done anywhere in the world. Having reached the conclusion that the discrepancy of r 87 .5 millimeters is due to errors in leveling, the question arises, how shall this discrepancy be distributed in fixing elevations hereafter to be used as standard? The theoretically best elevations would be obtained by making a new adjustment of the precise level net, including the new line and new connection with mean sea level at Seattle. To adopt such elevations resulting from a new adjustment of the net as standard elevations hereafter to be used would cause great inconvenience to all who are using the thousands of elevations already published, by introducing many small corrections. The problem is to make such a distribution of the discrepancy as will produce the minimum disturbance in past publications and the minimum inconvenience in the revision of past computations, and at the same time give standard elevations which are so near to the theoretically best elevations that the loss in accuracy by such an arbitrary adoption of standard values will not be serious. After careful consideration it was decided to hold· unchanged all elevations as published at Red Desert, Wyoming, and eastward of that point, and to distribute the discrepancy of r 87 .5 millimeters at a uniform rate ( 0.097 millimeter per kilometer) from Seattle to Red Desert. The corrected elevations printed in this appendix and to be used as standard are computed on that basis.

APPENDIX 4.

PRECISE LEVELING TO SEATTLE.

201

This arbitrary decision makes the adopted elevation of Red Desert about 100 millimeters greater than the theoretically best elevation. The agreement between the adopted and the theoretically best elevations is closer than this for points either to the eastward or westward of Red Desert, approaching exact agreement as the point considered is supposed to approach the places at which connections have been made with mean sea level. The doctrine of chances indicates th~t there is about one chance in five that the adopted elevation at Red Desert is nearer the truth than the theoretically best elevation derivable from the observations.
RESULTS AND THEIR ACCURACY.

The direct results of the leveling and the adopted corrected elevations are shown in the following tables, in which all the permanent bench marks are given. If no distance is given in the fourth column, the bench mark is in the main line of levels. If a distance is given in the fourth as well as the third column, the bench mark is on a spur and the distance given in the fourth column shows the point at which the spur branches from the main line. Each short section, usually from r to 2 kilometers long, into which the line was divided by permanent and temporary bench marks, was leveled at least twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. On each section upon v.·hich a forward and backward measure differed by more than 4m"'v K (in which J< is the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks in kilometers), both the forward and backward measures were repeated until two such measures fell within the limit stated. The fifth column gives the total discrepancy accumulated at each permanent bench mark between the elevation as computed from the backward lines and from the forward lines separately. The sixth column gives the elevations which result directly from the leveling. The last column gives the adopted corrected elevation. All elevations are referred to mean sea level.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.
OWYHEE, IDAHO, TO HUNTS JUNCTION, \VASHINGTON, LINE.

\Vhen commencing this line at Owyhee, Mr. Sewall leveled between bench marks W 4 and V 4 · The observed difference of elevation was v.-\V,=-o.258ometer. The same difference observed in 1903 (see preceding tabulation) was -0.2582 meter. This agreement within o. 2 millimeter indicated that the bench marks were undisturbed. The computation of the Owyhee-Hunts Junction line was based on the elevation of \V 4 as fixed in 1903, namely, 90,1.6997 meters.

LINE.

The computation of this line was started with the elevation 6.0549 meters for bench mark Tidal 4, corresponding to the reading 4. 2320 meters ( 13. 8846 feet) for mean sea level on the tide staff as fixed by tidal observations during the years 18991903. The leveling fixing the relation between the tide staff and the bench marks near it was done by l\fr. Baldwin in connection with this line. Previously, wye le\·els had been run between the tide staff and some of these bench marks, and they served to show that the tide staff and bench marks were stable.

The principal items of information in regard to the two lines, Owyhee to Hunts Junction and Seattle to Hunts Junction, are given in the tables below in the same form as the tables on pages 224-225 of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1903, arranged in such a manner as to be conducive to comparison between lines. The number of permanent bench marks includes all with which the leveling was directly connected, regardless of whether they are new bench marks or bench marks previously estab}ished by some other party or organization. The average distance between bench marks was obtained by dividing the total length of the main line by the nmnber of permanent bench marks. The speed was obtained by dividi11g the total length of the line by the interval in months from the date of the first leveling to the date of. the lac;t, inclusive. The expression ''total length'' refers to the completed line. Each completed section of the line was leveled at least twice, and in some cases four or more times. To obtain the speed in terms of single line, one must therefore multiply the speed here given by a factor somewhat greater than two. The discrepancy in millimeters per kilometer was obtained by dividing the total discrepancy on the main line by the length of the main line.

Co.MMENTS ON THE LEVELING.

Both parties made use, as a rule, of the railroad rails as supports for the rods, as the parties did in 1903. The results again indicate that this practice is conducive to both speed and accuracy. Mr. Baldwin ran his line through the Stampede tunnel, 2 miles long. It would have been slow and difficult to 'run the line around it. The most serious delays in the tunnel were caused by the smoke left by trains. This was avoided in part by doing the leveling at night when there were fewer trains than during the day. Acetylene bicycle lamps were used to illuminate the faces of the rods. The rodmen carried pocket lamps and the recorder used a miner's lamp. The average speed made by Coast and Geodetic Survey parties with this type of precise level has been 105 kilometers (65 miles) of completed leveling per month. Though these two lines of 1904 were run under unusually difficult conditions over heavy mountain grades, and in a region where the available boarding places were far apart, the speed of one of the parties was as great as the average, and for the other party, which had the additional hindrance of not being allowed to use velocipede cars, the speed did not fall much below the average. Mr. Sewall stated in his report on the - - - - - _._ --------- -------

season's operations that more than 70 miles of the line leveled by him was on grades of from 1.7 to 2.3 per cent. Mr. Sewall ran 22.6 kilometers ( 14 miles) of single line in 9 hours on June 1, a cloudy day, all of which proved to be within the required limit of accuracy. The fastest mile was done in 19 minutes, with 8 instrument stations, or at the rate of 3.2 miles per hour. Before the season of 1904, though the parties were urged to establish many permanent bench marks. their instructions required simply that ''the distance between successive bench marks shall nowhere exceed 15 kilometers." In 1904 their instructions stated that "there shall l;>e no portion of the line 100 kilometers long in which there are not at least 20 permanent bench marks. It is desired that the number of bench marks shall, in general, greatly exceed that necessary to keep within the limits." The result was that the average distance between permanent bench marks in 1904 was only 3 kilometers, about one-half as great as the average for lines run for several years past. This tends to make the leveling slower and more costly, but makes its record, as marked on the ground, much more permanent and convenient. Mr. Sewall adjusted his instrument but six times during the season. From July 25 to October 4 the angle. between the line of collimation and the tangent to the level vial at its middle point was found to be greater than 6", namely, 6".6 on only one day. The adjustment was tested once each day. On all the precise leveling a careful record of weather conditions is kept. A special investigation ot the leveling here reported upon was made to determine if possible whether any relation existed between the direction of the sun with reference to the direction of progress, and the errors. The investigation indicated a slight tendency for leveling which progresses toward the sun to carry the elevations too low.·

Ferguson, Assistant, extended the primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian southward from the line May-Gabriel, on which the triangulation in I 902 closed, to the line Serita-Stockdale. The line May-Gabriel is the southern limit of the Lampasas base net. The line Serita-Stockdale is the s~uthern limit of the first figure to the southward of the Seguin base net. The triangulation of 1903-4 adds, therefore, to the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian heretofore published, one section qetween bases and one figure more. The progress of the season of 1903-4, measured along the meridian, was 112 statute miles and the number of primary stations dccupied 26. Mr. 0. W. Ferguson, Assistant, was in charge of the whole organization, including the second observing party, and made the observations in the first observing party. Mr. William H. Burger; Assistant, was in direct charge of the second party, acting as observer. The primary triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was, at the close of the winter season of 1903-4, complete in so far as m:easurements of horizontal and vertical angles are concerned from the stations Drywood, S. Dak., and Layden, Minn.,. near the point where the boundary line between North Dakota and South Dakota meets the Minnesota boundary, to the stations Serita and Stockdale in the vicinity of Floresville, 'l'ex. 'l'he range in latitude is from 45°38' to 29°13', or 16°25'. All the base measurements have been completed along this portion of the triangulation, except of the Brown Valley Base in the last figure to the northward. No astronomic determinations have been made along this triangulation except one detern1ination of latitude and longitude made at Marlow, Ind. T., in advance of the triangulation and for a special purpose. The results of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, from the vicinity of the Page Base in the northern part of Nebraska to the junction with the portion published in this appendix, have been published.*

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

The engineer, intent only upon securing the necessa~y information ·to enable him to extend this triangulation or to base other surveys upon it, will find the information he desires in the latter part of this appendix, commencing with the explanations of positions, lengths, and azimuths. The index printed at the end of the appendix,' used in connection with the sketches, will enable him to find quickly the data he desires for any given locality. . The progress made in primary triangulation in the season l 903-4 in Texas was even more rapid than that of the season of 1902 from Kansas to Texas, which was commented upon* as being, so far as thi> writer was aware, the most rapid and economical triangulation of that grade' of accuracy yet executed at that time. The increased rapidity of the triangulation in 1903-4 redounds to the credit of the two officers concerned in th.e observations. It also makes the field organization, the methods of observation, and the accuracy attained of special interest. The field organization for the season of 1903-4 consisted of a building party, two observing parties, and five light keepers. The building party, under the immediate direction of Mr. J. S. Bilby, Signalman, erected the observing towers in advance of the observing parties, and marked the stations in a permanent manner. Mr. Bilby also made such revisions of the previous reconnaissance as were found necessary or desirable. The movements of the two observing parties were so planned that they were always· at iniervisible stations. Each observing party showed a heliot~ope during the afternoop. and a light at night to the other observing party'. Each of the five light keepers showed, in _general, t'wo heliotropes or two lights, one to each observer. The movements of the light keepers were controlled by code signals sent by the Morse alphabet with the heliotropes or lights. · The organization and methods of building and observing were in most respects identical with those set forth fully in Appendix 4 of the Report for 1903, in connection with the triangulation of 1902. The more important points of difference are as follows: The second observing party consisted of the observer, foreman, recorder, driver, and cook. In l 902 there was no foreman in the second observing party. The outfits were somewhat lighter than in 1902 .and but two teams instead of three were required to move the camp of the first observing party. The theodolites used, Nos .. 168 and 145, both direction instruments with horizontal circles 12 inches in diameter, were of the same type as those used in 1902. Mr. Burger made all paintings for horizontal angles by using an oblique cross in the diaphragm of the telescope. Mr. Ferguson used two parallel vertical lines about 20" apart, as both observers did in 1902. The instrument used by Mr. Burger also differed from the instrument used by Mr. Ferguson and from the two used in 1902, in the arrangement of the pointing lines in the micrometer microscope. Ordinarily, with each micrometer microscope, pointings upon the circle graduations have been made with one pair of parallel lines. In each micrometer on theodolite No. 145, as used by Mr. Burger, there were two pairs of parallel lines so placed that the interval subtended on the graduated horizontal circle

between points midway between the lines of each pair was about four minutes of arc.* With the ordinary arrangement of lines in the microscope the practiee is to make two readings in each position of the microsoope, the one known as the backward reading being made upon the graduation which is adjacent to the zero of the micrometer and to the apparent left, and the other, called the forward reading, being made with the same· movable lines and on a graduation adjacent to the zero of the micrometer and on the apparent right. With the new arrangement of lines one reading, called the backward reading, is made on the graduation adjacent to the zero and to the apparent left, with the apparent left-hand pair of parallel lines. The other, the forward readitlg, is made on the g~aduation adjacent to the zero o~ the micrometer and to the apparent right, with the apparent right-hand parallel lines. The minutes of the reading are taken from the backward reading as usual.· With the 1iew arrangement of lines but one tu-In of the micrometer head is necessary between corresponding backward and forward readings instead of five when a single· pair of parallel lines. is used. This is believed to be conducive to both speed and accuracy. For the elimination of the effects of errors of run upon the mean observed direction dependence was placed, as in 1902, ·upon making the mean value of the run small by adjustiµent and upon distributing the readings upon each station pointed upon approximately uniformly over the five-minute interval between adjacent graduations by the proper .selection of the settings· upon the initial station for the separate positions. t When one pair of parallel lines is used for both backward and forward readings the existence of a large error of run may be determined by inspection of the record of observations of directions. That is not the case when two sets of parallel lines are used. Mr. Burger was, therefore, required to make special observations to determine the run at least once a month. He was required to reduce the error of run by adjustment whenever it "was found to be greater than 1 11 for the mean of the three micrometers, or greater than 3" for any one. A second observation of the direction to a station to be detem1ined by intersections was taken during this season only when it could be secured under conditions nearly as favorable to accuracy as the conditions when the first measuremei1t was made, and without much delay to observations of the primary directions. In 1902 two observations were made on all intersection stations. At least two observations of each vertical angle were taken on each day instead of one as in 1902. No vertical angles were observed at night. Those taken at night in 1902 were found to be of too low a grade of accuracy to be of value. t
*The double sets of parallel lines were placed in this instrument and put into use during this season at the suggestion of the writer. This modification of the instrument and the corresponding · change in the method of reading the circle was suggested to the writer by the Lake Survey practice of taking backward micrometer readings only and by a conversation with Prof. Asaph Hall, jr., and Mr. H. F. Johnston, assistant engineer, on a Lake Survey observing tower at Mackinac Island in August, 1903. t See Appendix 4, Report for 1903, page 82i. tSee Appendix 4, Report for 1903, pages 822-823, 921

PROGRESS OF OPERATIONS

Mr. Ferguson and several members of the triangulation party which had been under his direction in South Dakota during the preceding summer season, arrived at Lampasas, Tex., on October 25. On November 4 the building party left Lampasas to begin the erection of signals. On December 28 the last of the 24 signals was completed. These signals, with an average height to the instrument of 28 feet, were erected at an average rate of 2.3 days per signal, making no deductions for Sundays, delays, and traveling between signals. The two observers reached May, the first station occupied, on November IO. The second observer, having had no previous experieuce in primary triangulatiol1, accompanied the first observer at May and Gabriel, the first two stations occupied. For the remainder of the season the two observing parties were never together. The observ1ng period was 2.1 months, observations at the last of the 26 stations being completed on January 11. In the following tables the stations occupied during the season by each of the two observers are arranged in order of time. The second column indicates the days on . which observations on primary stations were taken; the third column, the number of . such days; and the fourth col mm~ gives the approximate height of the instrument above the ground. The heliotrope or light was placed about 1.6 meters higher than the instrument.

For the season of 1902 the average number of days of primary observations at a station was 2. 7 for one observer and 3.8 for the other. The ratio of the number of observing days at a station to the total number of days at a station, exclusive of the time before the first and after the last primary observation, was o. 77 for Mr. Ferguson and o. 70 for Mr. Burger. This ratio, which depends mainly upon the weather, has usually been from o. 77 to o.86 for previous seasons along the. ninety-eighth meridian. The comparison indicates that the weather was more unfavorable than usual in 1903-4. The average interval from the last primary observation at one station to the first primary observation at the next during this season was 1. 2 days for Mr. Ferguson and o.6 for Mr. Burger. The difference between the two observers in this respect was mainly due to three serious delays of the first observer by bad weather. The rapidity of movement between stations and of preparation for observations 'is much greater than for any past seaso;1 along the ninety-eighth meridian of which the results have yet been published. The average distance between stations as traveled was about 22 miles. The average rate of progress for the whole season was 6.2 primary stations per month for each observer. The corresponding rate for the season of 1902 was 5.2 stations ph month. During the first half of the season of 1903-4 the second observer was getting his first experience in this class of work. The weather was more unfavorable during the first than during the last half of the season.· For both these reasons the progress was much

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

more rapid for the last fifteen stations, commencing with Hugo and Krueger, namely, 7 .9 stations per month for each observer. The fact that the work was done much more rapidly during the last than during the first half of the season is especially interesting in connection with the fact that the observations were much more accurate during the last than during the first part of the season.
STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS.

No local adjustments of directions were made because they have become unnecessary since the present method of supplying missing observations in broken series has been followed.* The quadrilateral formed by the stations Lavernia-Thomas-Stockdale-Serita was not adjusted. It will form a part of the next sec;_tion to the southward. The length and direction of the line May-Gabriel had been fixed by the adjustment of the section of triangulation between the Stephenville base net and the Lampasas Base. t . . The length of the Seguin Base had been fixed by the base measurement. The length published for the Seguin Base, as reduced to sea level on the supposition that the elevation of Seguin West Base above mean sea level was 170 meters, is 6 794.611 meters.t The assumed elevation, 170 meters, was the best that was available for Seguin West Base at the time the report upon the base measurements was published. In the winter of 1903-4 the elevation of this point was determined by precise leveling and found to be of 189.09 meters.§ This increased the computed reduction to sea level by 0:020 meter and made the reduced length 6 794.591 meters. . The primary triangulation from the line May-Gabriel to the line Lavernia-Thomas at the southern edge of the Seguin base net was adjusted as a single section, holding fixed the direction and length of the line May-Gabriel and the length of the Seguin Base. In the following condition equations the numbers assigned to the directions corre·spond to those shown on the two illustrations at the end of this appendix. The number of a direction inclosed in parentheses, thus ( r ), means the required correction to that direction. The 39 condition equations which refer to closures of triangles are given first, the 18 \vhich refer to ratios of sides next, and the length equation last. In the side equations and the length equation the coefficients and absolute terms are expressed in terms of units of the sixth decimal place of logarithms. The greater portion of the work making this difficult adjustment was done by Mr. M. H. Doolittle.

TRIANGULATION, LAMPASAS TO SEGUIN.

255

The maximum correction was ,i".96 to the direction (No. 55) from Hugo to Carpenter. A larger correction than this occurred in but five out of fifty sections of primary triangulation in the United States.* This large correction will be discussed later in this appendix under the head of ''A study of errors.'' The probable error of an observed direction is
'...~-

in which :!i·v· is the sum of the squares of the corrections to directions and c is th,e number of conditions. This places the section of triangulation between Lampasas and Seguin with Nos. 33 and 34 of the fifty sections of primary triangulation referred to in the preceding paragraph . . The sections were numbered in order of accuracy, with the most accurate placed first, The Lampasas-Seguin section of triangulation, as measured by this standard, is of slightly greater accuracy than the eastern oblique arc and of practically the same grade of accuracy as the transcontinental triangulation. t
ACCURACY AS INDICATED DY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES, CLOSURES OF TRIANGLES,

AND ACCORD OF BASES.

The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary scheme as far south as the line Lavernia-Thomas, at which the adjustment stops. The error of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess are also shown. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closurl! of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than r8o 0 plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangle, since it is proportional to the area. Wherever no entry is made in the column headed, ''Corrections to angles,'' the angle in question was not measured.

Of the fifty-seven triangles in the preceding table, twenty-five have plus closures and thirty-two minus closures. The a\·erage triangle closure is 111 · 13 and the maximum - 3". 97. The average closing error in the eastern oblique arc was 111 · 19 and in the transcontinental triangulation 1 ".06. Of the fifty sections of triangulation in the United States above referred to, twenty sections have average closures greater than r. 13 and thirteen sections have maximum closures greater than 3.97. The observers in r 903-4 were not attempting to secure the highest possible degree of accuracy, but on

the contrary, had been directed to ''proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed 3", and the average closing error shall be but little greater than l" is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated.'' The average closing error of l". lJ, and the fact that but two closures out of fifty-seven exceeded 3 11 , shows that the observing corresponded with considerable accuracy to the specification laid down before commencing it. Each of the triangles with closures greater than 311 involved a line of sight which was close to the ground or trees (see discussion under the heading, ''A study of errors''). In solving the normal equations the length equation was, as usual, assigned to the last place so that the discrepancy in length, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of lengths had been satisfied, became known. The length of the Seguin Ba~e, as thus computed from the Lampasas Base, was one part in 620 ooo less than its measured length, corresponding to a discrepancy of - 7 in the seventh decimal place of logarithms. This agreement within 11 millimeters on a base 6.8 kilometers long is exceedingly close. There are but two cases of closer agreement in the fifty sections of triangulation previously referred to.
A STlJDY OF ERRORS.

The following comparison is interesting as showing how closely the two observers agreed in the rapidity and accuracy of their observations, or, in other words, how well the first observer succeeded in teaching the second at the two stations where they observed together. Mr. Ferguson's primary observations were made at the rate of 2 minutes for each pointing on a distant signal, and Mr. Burger's at the rate of 2. l minutes per pointing. During the season Mr. Ferguson observed seventy-two primary directions to which. the average correction, \Vithout regard to sign, was found to be o".28 and the maximum 1 11 .30. The number of primary directions observed by Mr. Burger was fiftythree, to which the a\·erage correction was 0 11 .34 and the maximum 1 11 .96. The progress of the work was much more rapid during the last half of the season than during the first half. The following comparison of the accuracy of the results in the two portions of the seas.on is therefore interesting: ---·- -------·-··· ---- -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Average cor-

During the first half of the season one of the observers was getting his first experience in tnis kind of work; the weather was more unfavorable than dnring the last half of the season, and more low lines, ·passing near the ground or trees, were encountered than during the last half of the season. It is difficult to ascertain whether these contrasts account for all of the difference in accuracy between the two halves of the season's

work. The triangulation during the last half ranks with the best tenth of the primary triangulation by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The direction Hugo to Carpenter (No. 55) received the maximum correction in the adjustment, namely, - I". 96. The record books and field correspondence show that these two stations were not intervisible in daylight, though they were at night with the aid of the greater refraction which occurs then, and that the obstruction was at about one-third of the length of the line from Hugo. The 1iineteen observations at Hugo over this line showed an unusually large range, namely, I4."3, and three of the nineteen were rejected under the rule that all observations differing more than 5" from the mean are. to be rejected. All these observations were made on December IO. At Carpenter sixteen observations were made on Hugo oi1 the night of December 9 with a range of 8". 7. The observer, knowing that Hugo was visible only with the aid of the extrarefraction at night, took sixteen more observations on December 10. On December IO the range of the observations was 5". 1 and the mean was 4. "85 smaller than on December 9. In the final adjustment the mean of the thirty-two observations was used. The adjustment shows that this mean was close to the truth, as the correction which it received, No. 45, was only +o."07. Apparently, according to all the obsen1ations, this line of sight was deflected to the northwestward on December 9, and in the opposite direction on December 10. In each case the wind blew across the line of sight from the side toward which the line was apparently deflected. A comparative study of the corrections found necessary 'in making the adjustment and the records of observation and field correspondence shows a decided tendency for the larger corrections to be associated with low lines of sight. The records and correspondence show that thirty-seven out of one hundred and twenty-five directions were observed over lines which may be classed as low. The average correction to these thirtyseven directions is o". 39, whereas it was but o''. 28 for the remaining 88 directions, for which the records and correspondence either show no notes as to 'the height of the line of sight, or else show it to be high throughout its whole length. Of the six corrections to directions which are greater than I " four occurred on low lines. Eight of the eleven corrections to angles which are greater than 1" invoked low lines. Each one of the seven triangles which have closing errors greater than 2" involves a low line.

The total cost of the work of the season was $7 goo.

The cost per station occupied was the same as in 1902.* The cost per point determined was greater than in 1902 because a smaller percentage of points was determined by intersection. The remaining unit costs were larger than in 1902, even
*See Appendix 4 1 Report for 1903, page 872.

though the cost per station was the same, because the belt of triangulation was much narrower upon an average. The cost, as given aboYe, includes all salaries and wages chargeable to this field work, either in preparation or execution, and at the end of the field season the preparation of field reports and the putting of reports and computations in the final form in which they are submitted to the C?mputing Division in the Office. It includes even an addition of one-eleventh to the salaries actually paid to the mem hers of the permanent force during this ser\'ice, to take account of the fact that in general in such cases twelve months' salary is paid for each eleven months' work. It also includes all transportation of officers and men to and from the field and the cost of outfit and of material· bought.
EXPJ,ANATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZIMUTHS, AND OF THE GNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustment, all depend upon the Lampasas and Seguin bases. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired, it may be obtained with all the accuracy needed by adding to the sea-level length as given . h f . . .

The maximum value of this correction does not exceed 1 :dr, 0 of the length for any portion of the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed ·ir rli:rli 0··0 n of the length for any portion of this triangulation. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and the azimuths-need a special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a giv~n station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. l,ouis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the Office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous

triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March 13, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that former!)· in .use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic positions in New England* and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, .N'ew Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' and in ''The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States,'' publications which cleal primarily with the purely, scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid withi1i the area covered nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be deriyed from the astronomic obsen·ations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations ~vhich are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum he used for the whole country. In fact this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accuratdy coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. The problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic ob11ervations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, an<l with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but it is not --------·-------------·---- ----- ------- - - - - - - - - · - - - - ·X· Many such positions had been published in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1885, Appendix No. S for 1888, and Appendix No. 10, 1894. Since the adoption of the Cnited States Standard Datum many positions in Texas, Indian Territory, Oklahoma. Kansas, and ::-\ebraska reduced to that datum have been publisl.1ed in Appendix 6, Report for 1901, Appendix 3, 1902, Appendix 4, u903, and Appendix 9, 1904.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. . The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contras~ to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that with each new important accession of <lat~ a new spheroid fitting the geoid with Hie greatest possible accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the detennination of the figure of the earth. ~t is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of tl].e determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum, for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and .152 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approached closely to the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the positions of the station Meades Ranch as follows:

The following table·gives the positions of all points and the azimuths and lengths of all lines fixed by the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation of 1903-4 in Texas, except the stations Serita and Stockdale and the points determined from them. This table may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the two ·illustrations and the index at the end of this appendix. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, and in the fourth column the page on which its elevation above mean sea level may be found. The azimuth and length of every line over which observations have been made in one or both directions are given in the list in connection with the position of one end only of the line.

APPENDIX 5.

TRIANGULATION, LA:i'vIPASAS TO SEGUIN.

The positions of all points for which the latitudes and ~ongitudes are given to thousandths of seconds have been fixed by a complete adjustment of the triangulation concerned, so as to make all the triangles close and remove all discrepancies between lengths, azimuths, and positions. Such adjustments are of a very high degree of accuracy, as indicated in the preceding pages, for points on the main scheme, of a less degree of accuracy for supplementary points, and of a still more approximate character for points determined by intersections only. In each class all discrepancies are removed to the limit given by the decimal place shown. The above statements, in regard to the various degrees of accuracy refer to the manner in which the discrepancies were removed. If less than three decimal places are given in the latitudes and longitudes, the point in question has not been .fixed by fully adjusted triangulation, or is fixed in such a way as to furnish no check on its position, and the accuracy with which its position is known is indicated in part by the number of decimal places given. The seconds of latitude and longitude are also given in meters for the convenience of the draftsmen. The azimuths, distances, and logarithins of '1.istances are given to various numbers of decimal places, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure. The following tables give the positions of 23 primary stations and' 35 subordinate stations, or 58 in all, which have not before b~en published. The positions of May and Gabriel, which were published in Appendix 4 of the Report for 1903, are here repeated for the sake of completeness. For tP.e convenience of those who may wish to compare the lengths here given with others which are expressed in feet, or vice versa, the following conversion table is here inserted:

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.

269

These descriptions may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this appendix and to the index. In each description the tense used is appropriate to the date at which the description was written. All directions in the descriptions are given in the form of azimuths reckoned continuously from the south around by west to 360°, west being 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. The azimuths are true, not magnetic, unless otherwise stated. In general the surface and underground marks described are not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not, in general, affect the underground mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed. Any person who finds that one of the stations here described is disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to

Note I.-A hole was dug 18 inches in diameter to a depth of 2 feet, then I foot in diameter to a depth of 4Yz feet. In this, the lower or underground mark, a 2-inch iron pipe, 2 feet long, was set, flange down, and the hole filled, level with the top of the pipe, with concrete niade of Portland cement, sai1d, and broken rock. The pipe was filled with concrete and a 60-j:>enny steel wire nail set in the center of the top, the point, projecting one-fourth of an inch, marking the center of the station. Over this was placed 6 inches of sand. · Then the surface mark, a similar piece of pipe, ·was plumbed directly over the lower mark and the hole and pipe filled with concrete level with the surface. A 60-penny nail was set in the top of the pipe as below to mark the center of the station. The top of the pipe was covered with cement about one-half inch, on which was marked" U.S. C. & G. S. 1903." The reference mark was an iron pipe, 2 feet long, set in a hole 1 foot in diameter; surrounded and filled with concrete, with a 60-penny wire nail projecting one-fourth of an inch, the top of the pipe being level with the surface. Note 2.-The surface mark was the same as described in Note l, except that sometimes the pipe was only l foot long. The subsurface mark was a 40-penny nail set in cement in the solid rock. The reference mark was the same as described in Note I, unless otherwise stated. Note 3. -The center of the station was marked as described in Note 2, unless stated otherwise, but the reference mark was a one-half or three-fourths inch drill hole, l to 2 inches deep, surrounded by a paneled triangle 3 to 5 inches on a side.

COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY OF ELEVATIONS.

The zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed and were corrected for height of object observed and of instrument, so as to refer them all to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme where zenith distances had been observed was then computed from the observations over the line joiuing them by the formula

in which h. and /z, are the elevations of the stations, '· and e;, are the measured zenith distances, s is the horizontal distance between the stations, and p is the radius of .curvature. As there were always two or more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The elevations of the stations of the main scheme from Travis and Shovel, at the north, to Lavernia and Thomas, at the south, with the exception of Carpenter and Krueger, were obtained from a single adjustment, as shown in the tabulation below.

COAST AND GEODE'1'IC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

The elevations of Barton, Seguin West Base and Seguin East .Base were held fixed at 315.70, 189.09, and 18I.87 meters, respectively, these being the elevations as fixed by precise leveling.* In the following tabulation the observed differences of elevation treated in the adjustment are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight,p, assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the square of the length, s, of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the formula log p=9-2log s. The observed difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named minus the elevation of the first. The quantity contained in the last column but one is the correction to be applied to an observed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±0.41 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 31. 7 kilometers (1971 miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.41 meter. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the .elevations of the three stations fixed by precise leveling are about ±0.04 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Station Shovel was assumed to be the one least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ±o. 30 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, and when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the spirit leveling, it was not changed. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in this portion of the main scheme, there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.30 meter, or 0.98 foot, and for most of the stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. The elevations of the stations May and Gabriel had been fixed by the vertical angles measured in the Lampasas base net.* The elevations of the stations Post, · Buzzard, Carpenter, and Krueger were fixed by observations in both directions over a single line 0)1ly; hence, these stations do not appear in the adjustment.
TABLE OF ELEVATIONS.

The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: First, those fixed directly by the spirit leveling, and of which the elevations are subject to a probable error of ±0.04 meter; second, the stations in the main scheme fixed, by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±0.1 to ±0.3 meter, and third, the intersection stations, of which the t:levations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the intersection stations not being occupied, and whose elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ±2 meters in some cases. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of which the elevation is fixed by spirit leveling, as indicated in Class I of the following table. Station Shovel is probably least accurately determined of all the stations in the main sche~e. For a table to be used in converting feet to meters, or vice versa, see page 265.

LONG WIRE SWEEP.
By D. B.
WAINWRIGHT,

Assistant.

There are some areas ~long our coasts which have plenty of water for deep-draft vessels but which can not be pronounced absolutely safe for navigation owing to the fact that pinnacle rocks, coral rocks, or ledges of small area have been found there as a character_istic feature. No matter how closely these areas may have been surveyed with lead and line, there is still a possibility of the existence of hidden dangers which have not been charted. This uncertainty is an inherent defect in the method. As a remedy a Harbor and Channel Sweep was devised and has proved highly satisfactory for channels and anchorages; but as it covers in a traverse a width of only 65 feet its employment for completely sweeping large areas, like Frenchmans Bay, Maine, could not be entertained. Some other construction which would accomplish the desired result within a reasonable time was needed. The French Hydrographic Service has used a long rope sweep supported at intervals by buoys, but the most promising form for a sweep is one briefly described in the Report of the Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army, 1903 . .Starting with the latter as a basis, the sweep used in Frenchmans Bay was developed. The length of the horizontal dragging wire of the sweep is 1 ooo feet, and it is supported at th.e desired depth by three large buoys, one at each end and one in the middle, and at intermediate points, :;tt intervals of one hundred feet, by small buoys. The drag wire and the wires attaching the buoys were all of galvanized No. 12 American gauge .. The buoy wires were attached to the drag wire by swivels; and a swivel was also put in every 50 feet to overcome the tendency of the wire to twist into kinks. Shackled to the lower end of each of the large buoy wires were two cast-iron balls (deep-sea sinkers), each weighing 63 pounds. To the small buoy wires 9-pound sounding leads were attached by snap hooks: . The top cone of each of the small buoys was provided with a socket to carry a small flag stick with a flag. Around the top of the flag stick was wrapped a pound of sheet lead. This was for the purpose of capsizing the buoy when its wire was slackened by the drag wire striking an obstruction and thus giving notice of the. presence of a danger to navigation. In operation three launches were used, and the one attached to the center buoy by a 50-foot line, towed straight ahead in the direction it was desired to drag over, and was·kept on this course by observing sextant angles for position and plotting the same
56-o5-19

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

on a hydrographic boat sheet. The two other launches were attached to the ends of the drag by a 25-foot towline, and each directed its course so as to keep a specified strain on the towrope, as indicated on a spring balance attached to the latter, and at the same time make good a course that would be parallel to that of the middle launch. Position angles were observed with sextants on the end launches at regular intervals. These positions were plotted on the smooth hydrographic sheet and were used for drawing the path swept over by the drag. A sharp lookout for any unusual behavior of the buoys was kept up on the launches, and a patrol boat followed with spare buoy, anchor, and line to mark, for future development, any shoal spot indicated by the drag in the course of the day's work. ' In Frenchmans Bay the rate of speed adopted was from 1 ~ to 2 nautiCal miles an hour, and the pull for each end launch 125 pounds. This pull represented the resultant of the tension necessary to keep a half of the system at a certain curve and carry it ahead through the water at the required speed. The angle of the towrope with the general direction of one-half of the system corresponded with that of a diagonal of a parallelogram of forces, the tension and speed through the water being taken as the components. This angle was computed in advance and, together with the pull indicated on the spring balance, served to determine the course to be steered .by the launch. When not in use the buoy wires were kept wound up on one reel and the drag wire on another. When the drag was set from a steamer or cutter, a buoy wire and one set of heavy weights were attached to the end of the drag wire and lowered slowly overboard until the upper end of the buoy wire was unreeled. One of the large buoys was then attached and lowered into the water, a small boat taking it in tow, carrying it away from the vessel. The drag wire was now paid out until the shackle for the first small buoy wire was reached. The latter and one of the 9-pound leads were snapped on to the.shackle and the paying out continued until the upper end of the buoy wire was unreeled, when a small buoy was hooked on and dropped overboard. The paying out was again continued, the weights and buoys, small and large, being attached in their proper sequence. The launches then took charge of the system and it was towed along endwise until the center launch reached the beginning of the line to be traversed, when the end launches took up their proper positions according to directions signaled from the center launch. The start was then made, and thereafter the end launches were maintained in their proper relative positions by a suitable code of signals given from the center launch. To maintain the necessary transverse tension on the system and at the same time carry the system through the water at the required speed or its equivalent-maintain the tow rope at the proper angle while the spring balance indicated the specified pullthe end launches head out or away from the center launch. Should one of the ends of the sweep be observed to be in advance of its proper position, the launch having it in tow is given the proper signal, and it responds by heading still farther away from the center launch, thus slowing down that end. If, on the contrary, the end is falling behind, the launch heads in on a course more nearly parallel with the center launch, which has the effect of increasing the rate of speed of that portion of the system, at the expense of the transverse tension. This control of the end launches is a necessary feature, as the wind and tidal currents have more or less effect on the movements of the system.

LONG WIRE SWEEP.

DESCRIPTION IN DETAIL.

11/ire, g~lvanized No. l~, American gauge; diameter, 0.08 inch; weight per linear foot, 0.017 pound. The length used for buoy wires was 49. feet (0.83 pound). This length was determined, first, by the depth at mean low water it was desired to have absolute certainty as to hidden dangers, namely, 35 feet; second, the allowance for rang~ of tide; third, the allowance for lift of weights due to pull of towrope. The total length of drag wire was l ooo feet. This was divided into 50-foot sections, for, besides being connected by swivels to a shackle every 100 feet where the buoy wires were fastened, there was also an intermediate swivel, to avoid kinks. End and center buoys.-Shape, double cone, each one 2 feet high and 2 feet in diameter at its base; weight, 30 pounds; volume, 4. 19 cubic feet; displacement, 268.2 pounds in sea water; material, galvanized iron. They were strengthened by an inch flange at the junction of the two cones and a stay rod run through lengthwise. The latter was turned over at each end so as to form eyes. Small buoys.-Double cone galvanized iron, l foot high and l foot in diameter; weight, 6.5 pounds; volume, 0.525 cubic foot; displacement, 33.5 pounds in sea water. Buoys strengthened by an inch flange at junction of cones. No stay rods. Socket soldered on at the upper end for a small flag stick. Eye soldered on at the lower end. Wezgllfs.-For end buoys two 63-pound iron balls (deep-sea sounding sinkers) 8-inch diameter. For small buoys, 9-pound hexagonal sounding leads, 2 inches in diameter.

With the above weights the buoys were submerged one-half. It may be stated that in case of emergency, ai1d in a locality where the submerged rocks are not worn smooth, an effective drag could be constructed, if wire and swivels were on hand,' by using oil barrels or boats for the larger buoys and 5-gallon kerosene oil or paint cans for the smaller ones.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.*

, A topographic map is the delineation upon a plane surface, by means of conventional signs, of the natural and artificial features of a locality. Every point. of the drawing corresponds to some geographic position, according to some method adopted for representing the surface of the spheroid on a plane, which is called the projection. Since it is a representation in miniature, the distance between any two points on the map is a certain definite fraction of the distance between the same poit1ts in nature. This ratio is called the scale. Each point, besides being projected on a horizontal plane, has its elevation relative to a level surface, in some way indicated. The level surface adopted for the map is called the datum plane, and the representation of the variations in the vertical element, the modeling of the country, is called the relief.
CONTROL.

'

All topographic surveys of importance are based upon a system of triangulation. A sufficient number of points, whose geographical positions have been determined by triangulation, properly distributed over the area to be surveyed, forms the framework for controlling the accurate location of the various details.
*Advantage has been taken of the opportunity afforded by the preparation of a new edition of the Plane Table Manual to make a new arrangement of the "Three-point problem," with the intention of simplifying the description of the conditions found in practice and the several steps required for the graphic solution of the problem with the plane table according to Lehman's method. This method is the most rapid one, in the hands of an experienced topographer, but for those who may ha\·e only occasional use for a graphic solution Bessels's method or the tracing paper protractor· method is recommended.

INsTRU.'.ILE::-<"TS AND ADJUSTMENTS. THE PLANE TABLB.

The principal instrument in use by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for mapping is the plane table. For this purpose it is a universal instrument. A 11 the riecessary operations for producing a map are executed with it in the field directly from the country as a model. Other instruments are employed as auxiliaries to it under certain conditions, as will be seen later on under the head of '' Field practice,'' but in general it fulfills all requirements alone. Description (Illustration 1).-The plane table is composed of a well-seasoned drawing board* about 30 inches in length, 24 inches in width, and three-quarters of an inch thick, with beveled or rounded edges. It is commonly made of several pieces of white pine, tongued and grooved together, with the grain running in different directions to prevent warping. It is supported upon three strong brass arms, to which it is attached by screws passing through them and entering the underside of the board, the three holes for the reception of the screws being guarded by brass bushings and situated equidistant from each other and from the center of the table. By means of these screws the board can be removed at will. Tlie movements (Illustrations 1 and 2) of the tables in use by the Coast and Geodetic Survey are made from several different models, but as the principal features are the same in all designs the description of one type will suffice for all. The arms to which the board is fastened rest upon the sloping upper face of a rather fiat hollow cone of brass, to which they are permanently fixed. Upon its lower edge or periphery this cone is fashioned into a horizontally projecting rim, the inferior face of which is as nearly as possible a perfect plane, and this in its turn rests upon a corresponding rim of somewhat greater diameter projecting slightly beyond it. This second rim forms the uppen and outer flange of a circular me~al disk in the form of a very shallow cylinder. The inferior face or plane of the upper flange or rim has, at its contact with the superior face of the lower, a horizontal rotary movement about a common center which is also the center of the instrument, and the two are held together by means of a solid conical axis of brass extending upward from the center of the inner face of the lower disk. A socket of similar shape fits exactly over this axis, projecting downward from the inner side of the apex of the conical or upper disk. The two plates are held together by means of a screw with a milled head, capping the cone from the outside, and which can be loosened or removed at pleasure. · A tangent screw and clamp fastened to the edge of the upper rim permit, when loose, the revolution of the table about its center, and, when clamped to the lower limb, hold the table firm while the tangent screw gives a more delicate movement. Three equidistant vertical projections of brass, grooved on the underside, and cast in one piece with the under face of the lower disk, extending from the periphery toward the center, rest upon the points of three large screws which come through a heavy wooden block below. This block, which is the top of the stand and is approximate in form to an equilateral triangle, is 2 J4 inches thick when made of wood.

The three screws last mentioned have large milled heads, are quite stout, and play through the block below by means of brass female screws let into it. They are the leveling screws of the instrument and are equidistant from its center. Upon the underside and center of the metal lower disk is a socket containing a ball with a brass arm, which projects through the center of the block from beneath. The lower end of the arm is threaded, and upon it pfays a female screw \Vith a large milled head, which can be relaxed or tightened at pleasure. The screw clamps the whole upper part of the instrument to the stand; it is loosened only before leveling and kept securely clamped at all other times. The block, made either of wood or brass,* is sttpported upon three legs, and with them forms the tripod or stand of the instrument, the legs being of such a length as to bring the table to a convenient height for working, and so arranged as to be taken off at will, or closed so that their brass-shod and pointed ends can be brought together or moved outward, as may be required. They are made on the open or skeleton pattern, and each is securely attached to a segment of the tripod head by a long brass bolt.
;\IOUNTAIN PI,ANF, TABLE.

A small plane table, with a board measuring only 14 by 17 inches, is employed in reconnaissance, mountain work, or as an auxiliary to one of the standard size. All the various parts are reduced in size to correspond with the board, and the construction of the movement simplified.
THE
ALIDADl~.

The type of alidade in general use (Illustration 3) consists of a skeleton rule (12 inches long by 2 Yz inches wide) nickel-plated underneath, from and perpendicular to which rises a metal column (3 inches high), surmounted by Y's, receiving the transverse axis of the telescope, to one end of which axis is firmly attached a graduated arc of 30°, each side of a central o 0 , an accompanying vernier being attached to the Y support. The arc moves with the telescope as it is raised or depressed, and it is used in the measurement of vertical angles to determine heights. A clamp and a tangent screw placed on the other side of the telescope, opposite the arc, controls its vertical movement. The telescope is fitted accurately near its center of gravity within a closely fitting cylinder, to which is solidly attached the transverse axis. The telescope revolves within the cylinder 180°, stops being fitted for that range. This affords an easy mode of adjusting the cross li1ies to the axis of revolution, and for correcting with a striding level the errors of level and collimation and revolution of the telescope. Upon the tube of the telescope are turned two shoulders, on which rest a striding spirit ·level, which can be readily reversed or removed at pleasure. The eyepiece carries the usual reticule with screws for the collimation adjustment, and to this is attached a glass diaphragm, having one vertical and three horizontal lines engraved upon it. One of the horizontal lines crosses the middle of the diaphragm, the other two are placed equidistant from it, one above and one below. The interval between them remains a constant chord for the measurement of distance upon a graduated staff or rod.
*Now made of a special alur11i1111111 alloy.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

In some cases short auxiliary lines have been added dividing the interval into still smaller chords. Several of the alidades are furnished with a micrometer eyepiece so attached that the thread is horizontal, and has a vertical movement for measuring the angular distance of a fixed length on a rod which remains a constant chord. To the rule of the alidade are attached two spirit levels, one in the longitudinal direction of the rule and the other at right angles to it. A declinatoire (shown in Illustration I) accompanies the alidade and is carried in the same packing box. It consists of a rectangular brass box 7 inches long by 2 wide, with an arc at each end graduated ·to 15° on each side of the o 0 · It contains a needle long enough to extend from arc to arc, and resting on a pivot midway the box. The sides running lengthwise the box are parallel to a line connecting the zero marks of the two arcs. T!te metal damps, for holding the projection on the board, are of two kinds: U-shaped for the ends, and the side clamps, the latter being made of thin metal strips about 12 inches in length, with two or more springs attached to grip the underside of the board. Adjustments.-From the nature of the service in some sections of the country the plane table is often necessarily subjected to rough usage, and there is a co1~stant liability to a disturbance of the adjustments; still, in careful hands, a well-made instrument may be used under very unfavorable conditions for a long time without being perceptibly affected. One should not 'fail, however, to make occasional examinations, and while at work, if any difficulty be encountered which ~n not otherwise be accounted for, it should lead directly to an examination of the adjustments. 1. The .fiducial edge ef the rule.-This should be a true straight edge. Place the rule upon a smooth surface and draw a line along the edge, marking also the lines at the ends of the rule. Reverse the rule and place the opposite ends upon the marked points and again draw the line. If the two lines coincide no adjustment is necessary; if not, the edge must be made true. There is one deviation from a straight line, which, by a very rare possibility, the edge of the ruler might assume, and yet not be shown by the above test; it. is when. a part is convex and a part similarly situated at the other end concave; in exactly the same degree and proportion. In this case, on reversal, a line drawn along the edge of the rule would be coincident with the other, though not a true right line; this can be tested by a true straight edge. 2. T!te levels attac!ted to t!te rule.-Place the instrument in the middle of the table and bring the bubble of either level to the center by means of the level_ing screws of the table; draw lines along the edge and ends of the rule upon the board to show its exact position, then reverse 180°. If the bubble remains central it is in adjustment; if not, correct it one-half by means of the le,·eling screws of the table, and the other half by the adjusting screws attached to the level. This should be repeated until the bubble keeps its central position whichever way the rule may be placed upon the table. This presupposes the plane of the board to be true. The other level should now be examined and adjusted in a like manner.

Great care should be exercised in manipulation lest the table be disturbed. 3. Parallax.-Move the eyeglass until the cross hairs are perfectly distinct, and then direct the telescope to some distant well-defined object .. If the contact remains perfect when the position of the eye is changed in any way, there is no parallax; but if it does not, then the focus of the object glass must be changed until there is no dis- . placement of the contact. When this is the case the cross hairs are in the common focus of the object and eyeglasses. It may occur that the true focus of the cros.-; hairs is not obtained at first, in which case a readjustment is necessary, in order to see both them and the object with equal distinctness and without parallax. 4. Axis ef revolution.--Since the bearings of the pivots are fixed, the axis of revolution is assumed to remain parallel to the plane of the rule. 5. Vertical Hne ef diaplzragm.-Point the intersection of the vertical and the middle horizontal lines of the diaphragm on some well-defined distant object; revolve the telescope in its collar 180° and again observe the object. If the intersection covers it, the adjustment is perfect; if not, one-half tht:; error must be corrected by moving the diaphragm, by means of the adjusting screws, and the other half with the tangent screw of the table. This operation should be repeated until the adjustment is perfect. 6. llfiddle horizontal line ef diaphragm.-( 1) Adjust the striding level by reversing it end for end and correcting its error-half the difference by its own adjustment, half by the tangent screw of the telescope. (2) Point the telescope to a target, and note the reading, or make a mark whe:re the wire points, when the bubble is in the middle. (3) Revolve the telescope in its collar 180°, and note the reading or mark the place where the wire points, when the bubble is in the middle. (4) The mean of the two pointings is the true level line, upon which the wire is to be adjusted, which may be done in this way: Keep the bubble in the middle and by means of the adjusting screws bring the middle wire to bisect a point half way between the two readings or marks. The adjustment may be verified by revolving the telescope as in ( 2) and if the middle wire again bisects the point the adjustment is perfect. (5) If it is now desired to make the vernier read zero on the vertical arc, the table must be carefully leveled; and in order to do this more perfectly than can be done with the levels 011 the ruler, it may be done by observing the striding level; the telescope remaining clamped, the striding level should read the same in every position of the alidate when the table is perfectly level. (In general, this will be found too delicate a test, as the table is not sufficiently even for so sensitive a level to be employed.) The table being leveled, move the telescope with the tangent screw until the bubble is in the middle, and then set the vernier to read zero; the screw holes in it are oblong, so that it admits of being- pushed either way. ( 6) It is easy to have the adjustments near enough to serve for running curves of equal elevation, but in determining the heights of stations it is best to make the observations complete, with reversals, both of level and of telescope, taking the mean of the observations, by which the errors of adjustment are eliminated. This, in fact, is always done with the theodolite, and should be done with the alidade when precision is required.

It will be seen, from analyzing these observations, that the level was one-half minute out of adjustment, the horizontal wire one and one-half minutes, and that revolving the telescope in its collar 180° changed its relation to the index on the vernier by r '. The mean is free from all errors of adjustment. Tlte stadia rod* (Illustration 3), used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, is simply a scale of equal parts painted upon a wooden rod about ro feet long, 4 inches wide, and 17;( inches thick, so graduated that the number of divisions upon it, as seen between the upper and lower horizontal wires of the telescope when the rod is held at right angles to the line of sight, is equal to the number of units in the distance between the instrument and the rod. Graduation.-In all cases the rod should be graduated for the particular instrument, and, if the best results are to be obtained, to suit the convenience of the observer. In practice the alidade is mounted on a stand, and its center is plumbed over on~ end of a hundred-meter base, measured on level ground. A line, representing the zero of the graduation, having been drawn about 5 inches from one end of the rod, the latter is held vertical at the other end of the base, zero mark upward. The observer at the a.lidade then makes the upper horizontal line of the diaphragm coincide with the zero and directs the rodsman by signals where to draw a line which coincides with the lower horizontal line. This intercepted space on the rod is subdivided to read meters and the graduation continued to within a short distance of the bottom.

This graduation is represented by the equation d= fs+ (f+c),

where d=the /=the i=the s=the

distance from the center of instrument to rod (in this case roo meters); focal length of the telescope (which is 35°m for the average alidade); distance between the upper and lower wires of the diaphragm (4i m); length of the intercepted portion of the rod (1 111 .185);
0

c= the distance from object glass to center of instrument ( = { ) As indicated in the preceding equation, the readings of a rod graduated in this manner are not quite true for distances above or below roo meters, since the vertices of the constant and similar angles (one subtending the chord represented by the intercepted space on the rod and the other by the space between ~he upper and lower wires) do not lie at the center of the instrument, but at a distance beyond the object glass equal to the focal length of the telescope, and therefore the intercept on the rod will not be proportional for all distances from the center of the instrument. To have it so, the instrument should be mounted at a distance back from the end of the base equal to one and a half times .the focal length of the telescope (j+c). To all readings of a rod graduated according to this last method the constant quantity f+c must be aQ.ded. The correction for the first method is small and can be ignored for mapping on a scale of 1-10000 or smaller. The formula for the correction is:

Where K=correction in meters, B =distance read on rod in meters, B'=length of base, in meters, for which the rod was graduated. The corrections for 50, 200, 300, and 400 meters are +0.262, ~0.525, - r.050, - r .575 meters, respectively. bzclined.siglds.-When the rod is held at a point above or below the instrument, the line of sight is inclined at an angle with the horizon, and a correction has to be applied to the reading to obtain the horizontal distance. If the rod is held perpendicular to the line of sight the reduced distance is simply the product of the cosine of the angle of inclination into the rod reading. If the rod is held vertical, which is the usual and also the safest method, there is an additional correction on account of the oblique view of the rod. These corrections can be ignored in the ordinary work of the Survey; that is, on a scale of r-10000 or smaller, since for short distances they are too small to plot, and when the distances are long enough for them to become appreciable they are still small as compared to the uncertainty of the rod reading. For the convenience of the topographer engaged on large scale work, tables for reducing readings of inclined sights can be found at the end of the Manual. llficrometer CJ1epiece.-When a micrometer eyepiece is used in place of 'the stadia lines, a rod about 3. 7 meters in length is employed, attached to which are two targets. A base is measured on level ground and the instrument either plumbed over one end or back of .it a distance equal to J+c, depending upon the manner the rod is to be held

302

for an inclined sight. The rod i~ then taken to one of the subdivisions of the base, consisting of an even multiple of the unit adopted; say 100, 200, or 300 meters, and the upper target being fixed, the lower target is set and fixed so that the angular measure of the interval by the micrometer will consist of an even multiple of turns of the micrometer screw. The rod is now held at the other subdivisions of the base, and the readings tabulated. A distance table is then prepared, by interpolation, for the intermediate distances. Plane-table sheet.-From the standpoint of efficiency the plane-table sheet is the least satisfactory portion of the plane-table equipment. Owing to its hygrometric nature it is very susceptible to atmospheric changes: expa~1ding and contracting um:easingly. This would be but an insignificant source of error or annoyapce if it were equal in all directions. The map or plan would Llen simply change· its scale, for which an allowance could readily be made. But the objectionable feature arises from the unequal expan- · sion and contraction which changes the relative distance and directions of the points. It has been determined by exP.eriment that strips cut longitudinally from drawing paper varied from IO to 25 per cent more than strips cut transversely from the same paper. Various substitutes* have been tried, but none have proved entirely satisfactory. The 1.Jnited States Geological Survey, to eliminate this distortion, employs two sheets of paragon paper, the size of the plane-table board, mounted with the grain at right angles, ai'id with cloth between them. This method is applicable to small scale surveys where a sheet the size of the table board covers a large area of country, or, on the other hand, tq large scale cadastral surveys where the great amount of detail makes the rate of progress slow. But for intermediate scales and an area containing a moderate amount of detail, a longer sheet is much more economical, because a smaller number of points are needed to keep the work within the control of the triangulation than would be required if it was limited to the size of the table. . A certain amount of overlapping work, of which there is more or less at the jut}Ction of the two sheets, would also be avoided. The plane-table sheet of the Coast and Geodetic Survey consists of a sheet of Whatman's cold-pressed, hand-made antiquarian paper, 52 by 30 inches. It is backed \vith muslin, which extends about 1 inch beyond the edge of the paper td protect it from fraying. To reduce the distortion to a minimum a sheet should be thoroughly seasoned before it is taken to the field or a projection laid down on it. This is effected by exposing it alternately to a very damp and a very dry atmosphere. On testing a sheet after a week of such exposure it will be found to have much less tendency to expand or contract unequally. Paper stored away, piled up in stacks, does not properly season. Scale.-The selection of the scale to be employed depends so much on the character of the country to be surveyed, the amount of detail to be included, and the uses to which the completed map will be put, that no general rule can be given for guidance. It must be remembered, however, that nothing is gained, either in economy or rapidity, by .the u;e of small scales when the details are shown to be plentiful. The minute drawing involved proves a tax on the topographer and is a great time consum.er.

PROJECTIONS FOR FIELD SHEETS.

It is presumed that determination has been made, by triangulation, of points most suitable for the use of the topographer who follows with the plane-table work, and that a sketch of the same is at hand, giving an approximate skeleton map of the area to be surveyed. The location or orientation (as it is frequently called) of the sheet is then based upon several important considerations. It may be taken as a rule that the intervisibility of the points extends across valleys, from summit to summit, or across rivers, bays, and other bodies of water. So that generally the line of greatest depression of the valley (thalweg) should follow as nearly as practicable the middle of the sheet, regard being had for any abrupt change of direction or impartance of lateral features; or, in. other words, the areas to be surveyed should be divided as far as possible into water basins, extending from divide to divide, and not center upon a ridge forming portions of two basins. The reason for this being that from either slope of the basin points are visible on the opposite summits which will· be common to the sheets which include the adjoining valleys, while from the middle of the valley points will be visible on both summits. From the written descriptions of the points determined, discrimination should be made in regard to.their temporary or permanent character. A flag in a tree is likely to have disappeared soon after its determination, and the usual cut of a triangle in its bark may have disappeared before the lumberman's ax, while a church spire, a light-house, a house chimney, a copper bolt in a rock, or a bottle buried beneath the surface of the ground is more likely to be recovered and to be of service to the topographer. Two intervisible points, one of which may be occupied, or three inaccessible points, are all that are absolutely necessary upon a sheet for the commencement of work. for from, or upon these, all other points required may be determined, and it is oftener more, important, from considerations of economy of time and facility for work, to have more regard for embracing the topographical subject in its entirety, where points may be determined at convenience, than to furnish a large number of determined points at the expense of the best orientation of the sheets in regard to topographical details. In flat sections where the vertical question is scarcely a factor, the main question is generally a plan that will cover the area. with the {ewest sheets compatible · with a sufficient overlap of common points; and where the object is a survey of one side of a river or other body of water, points on the opposite shor.e should be included when possible. When it is possible, the sheet should be located by one familiar with the peculiar topography of the region to be surveyed, and with some knowledge from observation of the relative value of tJ1e points between which there may be any necessity for discrimination. Where the surface 'is broken without any marked basins of large area, and when the i;beet, on the scale determined upon, will cover several successive basins and <livid-

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1905.

ing ridges, the consideration of reach from higher to higher summits should control as in the reach over one valley; thereby affording the best means for determining position and any desirable auxiliary points in the lower intermediate summits and in the valleys. Points at the junction of confluent streams have usually large arcs of visibility, and are consequently of great value for purposes of orientation. If, therefore, such a point should be near but off the edge of a sheet of regular dimensions, and from the necessities at the opposite edge can not be included by it, it is often well to extend the length of the sheet so as to include the point, even though there may be no intention to complete topographic details upon the additional piece. Light-houses are often of this character, the reasons governing the selection of their positions for light purposes having equal weight in the selection of such positions for survey signals. The draftsman will be materially assisted in laying out the limits of the projection by drawing on a piece of tracing vellum a plan of the sheet, corresponding in size to the scale of the triangulation sketch. Take, for example, a sheet 52 inches in length by 30 in width, on which a projection on a scale of 1-10000 is to be drawn, the triangulation sketch being on a scale of 1-100000. The dimensions of the plan will then be one.tenth those of the sheet, viz·, 5. 2 by 3.0 inches. Placing the pattern over the sketch and shifting its position about over the locality to be smveyed, the limits which include the most favorable conditions for the projection will soon become apparent. The Polyconic projection has been adopted by the Coast and Geodetic Survey for mapping its work. The method of constructing one is as follows: The limits of the sheet having been determined, the middle meridian A (see illustration 5) is located and drawn; then its intersection with the most central parallel is found, and the perpendicular B erected there. Next turn to the page of the "Tables for a polyconic projection of maps" t in which is given the degree of latitude which includes the limits of the sheet. In this instance the latitude is 40°, to be found on page 223 of the tables. The number of minutes of latitude on the central meridian, above and below the central parallel, being known, take the corresponding distance from the column headed ''Sums of minutes for middle latitude" and lay it off (C) above and below the central parallel, and with the same distance as radius, strike arcs D D D D above and below, from near the extremities of the perpendicular B. With a well-tested straightedge draw lines E E through the north and south minut.es on the central meridian, and tangent to the two arcs D D to the right and left. This gives three parallel lines perpendicular to the central meridian. On the opposite page 222, from under the head of ''Arcs of the parallel in meters,'' take out the value corresponding to the number of minutes of longitude east and west of the central meridian and lay off the .whole distance F F' F" on each perpendicular, taking each distance from its appropriate latitude. Subdivide these into minutes

ature" ), are inappreciable and may be disregarded, the ordinates Y only being used. These give the distances to be set off from the lines B and E, perpendicularly toward the pole, for each minute of longitude counting from the central meridian. For ordinary field projections of scale 1-10000 the ordinate of the extreme minute only need be used, and the parallel drawn a right line from the point so fo11nd to the central .meridian. This ordinate H being set off on each of the parallels, the meridians are all drawn in with a fine ruling pen, then subdivided into minutes, and the parallels carefully ruled in through the points of subdivision. The projection is verified by applying the measure of a number of minutes of latitude and longitude, and by a comparison of diagonal measurements on different parts of the sheet. All measurements should be carefully taken from the scale with a keenly pointed beam"compass, and the marks pricked in the paper should be as light as possible to be seen, so as to insure the greatest possible accuracy. The draftsman is supplied with a list of triangulation points, which gives their relative distances, their latitudes and longitudes, and also the equivalents in meters of the seconds of latitude and longitude, according to which the points are now plotted on the sheet by measuring from the corresponding minutes. Thus in the diagram the distance J represents the seconds of latitude; K, the seconds of longitude of the trigonometric point. The accitracy of the plotting is tested· by a measurement of the respective distances between the points with a beam-compass, these distances being also given. The latitude and 1011gitude are then plainly marked, usually on the north and east sides of the sheet, at one extremity of each parallel and meridian, and the pencil marks erased. It sometimes becom~s necessary to base topographic work upon a detached scheme of triangulation, before the usual astro1iomic observations have been made. In this case the oi1ly elements given are the distances from the points to two projected arcs of rectangular coordinates (which are assumed) and the distances between the points. The projection for plotting these consists simply of axes of ordinates and abscissas so laid on the sheet that it will embrace all the points required by the surveyor, and in the manner most convenient for his work; and the points are plotted from these by the intersection of two arcs with the distances of the points from the axes as radii, either north or south, east or west of the axes, as the plus or minus sign given may indicate. The only test is by the distances between the points, and there should be at least two from each. If the work be correctly done, a regular projection can be constructed on the sheet after it is finished and the required astronomic work is completed. In case it so happens that for some special purpose it becomes urgent to undertake a piece of topography, when neither the data for projections nor coordinates are at hand, plotting by distances is the only resource left, and, of course, great care is necessary. When a sheet has no projection-that is, no meridians and parallels, it is advisable , to draw squares of 1 ooo or any specified number of meters on it, by means of which the projection can ultimately be laid down correctly. Accessories.-The u_sual accessories for plane-table work are: Large umbrella for shading table, binocular, pocket compass, 10 or 20 meter steel tape, Locke's level,

clinometer, metal scale, dividers, pencils, rubber, block of emory or sand paper, table of heights, note, and sketch book.* . A metal chart case should always accompany 1:he table to secure the sheet from sudden rain and other injury liable to occur in transportation of the sheet to and from the field and for its safe-keeping when not in use. Its diameter should not be less than 3 inches, for no sheet can be rolled to a less diameter without serious rupture of the fiber of the paper. It is also advisable to have a rubber cloth for covering the table when it is carried from station to station.

FIELD WORK.

Organization ef party.-In organizing a party for field work it is necessary to have one man to carry the table. His duty is to rem.ain constantly with the instrument, never to leave it unguarded; and while the topographer is at work he holds the umbrella to shade the table from the sun and thus protect the observer's eyes from the glaring reflections from the paper and instruments. The table bearer should be taught at the beginning of the work the mode of. setting the table over a point and taking it up from the same. In the first instance to grasp firmly two legs of the tripod and with the knee to extend the third one until it reaches the ground at the proper distance from the point, and then place the other two in position. The distances from the point will vary, as the ground may be level or $loping, in order to keep the tripod head vertically over the point and approximately horizontal, securing the latter condition by sighting over the head to the horizon. In taking up the table two legs should be grasped firmly and the table raised, resting upon the other leg, upon which the first two are closed, when the table is raised in place upon the shoulder. Two rodsmen are needed, and the rapidity with which the work is executed largely depends upon their efficiency. When well trained they should be able to recognize the salient points of the features to be mapped, so that the topographer can draw in correctly the details from the least number of readings, in the absence of an aid to make a sketch of the intricate portions. The amount of assistance an aid can give to his chief is limited only by his skill and experience. The logical inference being that he is in training to become a topographer himself, he takes charge of an increasing share of the work as he becomes more and more familiar with the methods employed. This enables his chief to turn his attention in other directions, which will expedite the survey and increase the output. An outline, merely, of his duties can be suggested: Building signals, drawing plans of intricate details, sketching contours, selecting stations in advance, running traverse lines with auxiliary instruments, and finally in taking charge of the plane table in the absence of his chief, who is thus afforded the opportunity of inspecting some difficult area and formulating some plan to meet the conditions found there.
*For the Locke's level, clinometer, and pocket compass a Casella pocket alt-azimuth instrument may be substituted, as it combines all three in a very convenient form. ·

A PLANE TABI,E MANUAL.

The additional number of men required to complete the party will depend mainly . on the means of transportation-wagon, horseback, or boat. Preliminary reconnaissance.-Before commencing the instrttmental work, a reconnaissance of the country should be made for the purpose of recovering triangttlation stations and to locate signals at suitable poii1ts for subsequent determination and ttse. In the location of signals, either as permanent points or simply for temporary forward lines, a great deal depends upon the good judgment of the person placing them. Two purposes are to be subserved: First, the seeing of sufficient known points to give a good determination; and, second, to command a view of as great an area of country, and as many natural and artificial features for filling in the topography, as possible. It should be remarked, also, that in the course of prosecution of the regular work no favorable opportunity must be allowed to pass for locating a signal or determining a point which may at some future time be of service. Advantage should be taken of open places in the woods commanding roads or ravines. Piers or draws of bridges, or piles, giving lines up and down streams, which have precipitous and wooded banks; trees of unusual appearance in prominent positions, or bearing flags placed upon them for the purpose: points of rock, offshore or otherwise; lightning rods, cupolas, weathercocks, chimneys of factories, and other peculiar and marked objects come within this category. In fact, it may be set down as a rule that well-determined signals located at convenient distances over the sheet are more likely to be too few than too many. Sig1la/ poles should be straight and perpendicular, and the flags upon them adapted in color to the background against which they will be seen when observed upon. Grap!iic tria1zfrulatio11 (Illustration 6) .-Signals having been erected at each triangulation station, and also on all prominent hills within the area of the sheet, where they will he useful in providing additional control, the next proceeding will be to occupy one of the former points. Care should be exercised in choosing a day for this portion of the work, as it is essential to have favorable weather for a satisfactory test of the plotted points in the field and for the determination of new ones. On arrival at the station the table is set up approximately over the center mark, and the sheet secured to the table, so that it will be held firmly and evenly and not be disturbed in its position by the friction of the alidade, nor by ordinary winds. As the longest side of the board is usually made equal to the width of the sheet, and the sheet is usually longer than this width, the excess of length is rolled up inward, turned underneath the sides of the table and fastened with a metal spring clamp, biting from the top of the sheet on the table to the inside of the roll beneath. One clamp at each end of the roll serves to hold the roll ends securely. The sides of the sheet are sometimes held to the table by similar but shorter clamps, but it is preferable for the free movement of the alidade, and more secure against strong winds, that a metal strip, the length of the side between the end clamps, with spring clamps fastened to the outer edge, and biting the underside of the table, be used for holding down the edges of the paper. The chief and controlling condition in work with the plane table, and without which no accurate work can be done, is that the table shall be oriented-that is, that all lines joining points on the sheet shall be parallel to the corresponding lines of nature. Let T, T', T", T"' (J:"ig. 1) represent the board of the plane table, upon which is spread the sheet; the plotted triangulation point a upon the sheet representing the

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

signal A upon the ground; b, the spire B; c, the signal C; and p, the station P; the small letters on the sheet representing the centers of the signals on the ground, which are referred to by corresponding capital letters. The table is placed approximately level over the station occupied, P, and oriented, also approximately, by the eye, so that the plotted points on the sheet are in approximate range with the station P and the signals or objects they represent in the field. Then plumb the point p over the station P, fixing the legs of the table firmly in the ground. In maps of large scale it is important to plumb the plotted point exactly over the station, but on the usual field scales of the Coast and Geodetic Survey ( l-10000 and l!..20000) an approximation with the eye is all that is requisite. To effect it more closely a small stone is held underneath the point and then dropped to test the position, or a plumb bob fastened to the table below the point serves the same purpose. Plumbing arms or forks are made and supplied by the instrument dealers. The plotted point having been plumbed over the station as accurately as the scale of the work demands, place the alidade on the table so that the rule shall extend across and parallel with the line joining two of the leveling screws; loosen the large clamp screw under the tripod head, and with the leveling screws bring the bubbles of the two levels on the rule to the center; clamp the screw under the tripod head, and the table is level. Now, unclamp the revolving plate, place the edge of the rule upon the plotted points p and b, the telescope being directed toward the spire B, as shown by the arrow-head of the figure, and revolve the table until B is seen in the field of the telescope; clamp the revolving plate, and with the tangent screw of the movements bisect the top or center of the spire B with the vertical wire of the telescope. The table is now oriented, if the points have been correctly plotted and the proper objects sighted. To verify this, place the rule upon the point'p again, and upon the points a and c, consecutively, and if the two signals A and C are bisected by the vertical wire of the telescope, the position is assured, and the lines connecting points of the sheet are parallel with the corresponding lines on the ground. The failure to bisect A and C would indicate an error of plotting or an unequal change of the dimensions of the paper (distortion), which must be examined, and in case of the former, corre~ted, and in case of the latter, allowance made for, as indicated later on. (See distortion errors, page 316.) The next proceeding is to draw the line to the next point which it is desirable to occupy or determine, either some natural object which can be occupied, or a temporary signal placed for that purpose, as the signal D. The edge of the rule is placed upon the point p, and moved about that point as a center until the signal D is bisected by the vertical wire, and then a line, f, is drawn along the edge of the rule from p far enough to reach the estimated position on the sheet of the point d, and at each end of the rule the short check lines n n are drawn. These check lines can be used in reversing the alidade with the accuracy that is obtained by the greatest length of a range line. They may be indicated on the sheet, with names of objects, as in fig. 2-cli., chimney; t., tree; cup., cupola; sp., spire; w. m., windmill; or numbered, and a record kept of the objects sighted, where details are complex. In the same manner lines should be drawn to such objects as it is desired to determine. This determines only the one element of direction; it will be necessary to determine the distance from the point occupied either by measurement or by intersec-

tion from some other fixed point, at an angle not less than 30° nor more than 150°; all acute intersections should be verified by a direction from a third point. The table is moved to the station A (Fig. 2) and placed over the point, oriented approximately, leveled, ·and the axis of revolution clamped as at station P. The rule is then set upon the line a p, the telescope directed toward the signal P, and the table put in position in the ma1:mer described. Then, keeping the edge of the rule upon a, direct the telescope to the signal D and draw the line a d, intersecting/, and determining the position of the point d upon the sheet, corresponding to D, and bearing the . same relation in directions and distances from the points p, a, b, and c as the signal D does from P, A, B, and C. All lines to other objects which were drawn from p, and which objects can be seen from A, are intersected and determined in the same manner. When a direction has been drawn from a station to any undetermined point that may be occupied, the position of the point may be determined by occupying it with the table, and orienting the table by the line drawn to it, and resecting upon a signal whose corresponding point is plotted upon the sheet. The table is placed over the point D (Fig. 3), oriented approximately, leveled, etc., as at the previous stations. The edge of the rule is then placed upon the line d p, passing through the point p, so that the checks n n are just visible along the edge, and the telescope directed toward the signal P, and the table oriented. The rule is then placed with its edge bisecting one of the plotted poitits, such as b, which will give a good intersection (the nearer 90° the better) with the line f, and is moved about that point as a ct;nter until the spire B is bisected by the vertical web. A line is now drawn accurately along the edge of the rule through b, crossing the line/. If this line intersects the. line fat the point d, the position of the latter is assured, and a delicate hole with the dividers should be pricked at the point, surrounded by a small circle in pencil. Resection upon any other determined point will verify its position. From this point, d, directions are observed and drawn to verify the previous intersections upon chimne; 1 , tree, cupola, windmill, etc. There are occasions when occupying some station that several objects are seen whose position it is desirable to determine by prosection, but there is doubt of their being recognized from other stations. A new station is then occupied close by the first one and new lines drawn to the objects. The intersection thus obtained will necessarily be acute, but will materially assist in their identification from other localities. All lines should be drawn lightly and carefully, close to the edge of the rule, with a hard, finely-sharpened pencil. If the table and alidade be in proper condition, the contact of the edge of the rule with the paper will be perfect throughout its length, and in drawing a line along the edge care nrnst be taken to preserve the same inclination of the pencil and to keep it sharp. If the rule should be raised from the paper at any part, great care is to be observed that the pencil does not run under the edge and thus deviate from a straight line. Amount qf control.-There is no fixed ratio between the number of determined points and- the number of square miles of the region to be surveyed or squal"e inches of plane-table sheet. The greater the number of points well distributed over the latter the less likelihood of error due to distorti<;>n of the paper.

· A large number also makes it easy for the topographer to determine hy resection subordinate stations for mapping the details, and in consequence fewer traverse lines need be run. More than sufficient for these purposes are not necessary, and it is important when carrying on a graphic triangulation not to waste valuable time and favorable weather, but to advance this. part of the work as rapidly as possible betore the sheet becomes affected by exposure. The three-poiut problem (Illustration 7) .-A subordinate station is located at any desired place where a good view of the surrounding features can be obtained. If the position of this point has not been previously determined it is now effected by means of the resection of lines from three fixed points. The special advantages of the plane table as a mapping instrument are due to the rapidity with which it obtains results by the method of graphic triangulation and to the facility it affords the topographer in determining his position at an unknown point by the graphic solution of the three-point problem. When the latter method is applicable-that is, when the country is open and signals can be easily seen-its superiority over a system of traverse lines is manifest. The topographer is then at liberty to choose his ground without reference to his last station or to one succeeding. He is not tied down to a backsight nor restricted by the conditions imposed by a foresight. He· need not set up his instrument on an area barren of detail nor cut his way through obstacles (bushes, hedges, trees) to establish a station at a commanding point of view. The number and situation of the stations are governed solely by the amount and location of the information to be mapped. On the other hand, traverse stations are chosen on account of their visibility, and many of them are of no service whatever beyond carrying the line forward. When the table is imperfectly oriented, the lines drawn from the three_ projected points, when sighting on the corresponding actual points, will not intersect at one point unless all four are on the circumference of a circle. (See Fig. 3, Indeterminate position.) Except in this case, two of the lines will be parallel, intersected by a third (see Fig. 4, Station on range line between two fixed points, and Fig. 2, Station on prolongation of range line), or they will form a small triangle called the tria11gle of error. (Figs. 1, 3, 5, and 6.) The solution of the three-point problem determines the location of the station occupied and orients the table simultaneously. The relative positions of the three fixed points with reference lo the new station have an important bearing on the strength of its determination. In the following statement in regard to the different groupings of points met in practice, for the sake of brevity, the term "fixed pojnts" \\rill be understood to mean points already determined and plotted on the sheet; the "great triangle" referred to is one formed by the three fixed points, and the '' great circle '' is the circle passing through them. 11/hen the new station is outside the great circle, the strength for determination of a position will be weak when the middle point as seen from the new station is the farthest of the three and the angles are small. (See Illustration 7, Fig. 3.) If the new station is located outside the circle, and some distance below it, the angles are small and the determination correspondingly weak.

The determination increases in strength for given angles as the middle point approaches the new station. (Fig. r.) When one angle is small or o 0 (points in range), the determination will be strong, provided the two points making the small angle or range are not too near each other when compared to the distances to the new station and to the third point; provided also the angle to the third point is not too small. (Fig. 2.) Wizen the new station lies on or near tlze great circle, its position is indeterminate. (See Illustration 7, Fig. 3.) f;V/zen the new station is mitlzin the great circle, the strength of its determination increases as it approaches the center of gravity of the great triangle. (Figs. 3, 4, 5.) There are a number of graphic solutions, but all save three are better suited to the drafting room with its appliances than to the conditions which exist in the field. Lehmann' s method of solution is the simplest and most direct, and applies under all circumstances. The directions are stated in the form of rules. The term ''point souglzt'' will be understood to mean the true position on the sheet of the projected point of the station occupied. The surveyor is assumed to be facing the signals, and the directions right and left are given accordingly. Rule I.-The point sought is always distant from each of the three lines drawn from the three fixed points in proportion to the distances of the corresponding actual points from the station occupied,* and it will always be found on the corresponding side of each of the lines drawn from the fixed points. t · The simplest case for the application of this rule occurs when the station to be determined is within the triangle formed by the three fixed points; the point sought must then be within the triangle of error to satisfy the conditions. (See Illustration 7, Fig. 5.) Although Rule 1 is sufficient in itself for the solution of the problem, there are two subordinate rules which materially assist the topographer in reaching a decision as to the proper location of the point sought with reference to the lines from the fixed points. Rule 2.-When the point sought is without the great circle it is always on the same side of the line from the most distant point as the intersection of the other two lines. (See Illustration 7, Fig. 1.) · Rule 3.-When the point sought falls within either of the three segments of the great circle formed by the sides of the great triangle the line drawn from the middle point lies between the point sought and the intersection of the other two lines. (See Illustration 7, Figs. 3, 4, 6.) . Application~! rules.-In practice the topographer first decides the relation of the new station with reference to the fixed points, whether it is within the great triangle or in one of the segments or outside the great circle. He then determines the position of the

* Demonstration.-A, B, C (Illustration 8, Fig. r) are projections of the three signals from which it is desired to determine by resection the position of a fourth point, D. The table being out of position to the right, the triangle of error formed by the three lines from A, B, and C is ab, ac, be. The true point occupied lies at D, being at the intersection of the circles AB ab, AC ac, BC be. Now, if ·perpendiculars be drawn from D to the lines drawn from A, B, and C, we shall have Da : Db :: DA : DB or Db : De :: DB : DC. t That is, if it is on the right side of one line, it is 011 the right side of each oue of the other two, and if on the left side of oue, it is on the left side of each one of the other two.

point sought with reference to one line (if within one of. the segments or without the great circle by Rule 2 or 3); it then follows from Rule 1 that it must be on the corresponding side of the other two lines. Finally, he estimates the relative distances of the three actual points from him and marks the position of the point sought a proportionate distance from the three lines.
EXAlllPLES.

Illustration 7, Fig. I: When the point sought is without the great circle, the intersection of the lines from B and C fall to the right of the line from A, the most distant point; therefore (Rule 2) the point sought must be on its right, and also (Rule I) on the right of the line from B and C. Its exact po'sition is then estimated according to Rule r. Illustration 7, Fig. 2: When the point sought is on or near the prolongation of a range line, it must be outside the parallel lines on the side of the line to the nearest fixed point of the range. In the figure it will be seen that the point sought must be outside the lines from A and B, and to their right to satisfy Rule 1, and also to the right of the line from C. Illustration 7, Fig. 3: When the point sought is on the circle passing through the · three fixed points, the position is indeterminate, as the three lines will intersect at one point, although the table is imperfectly oriented. Another selection of points must be made. Illustration 7, Fig. 3: \Vhen the point sought falls wiJ:hin one of the segments of the great circle, the line drawn from A, the middle point is to the right of the intersection of the lines from B and C; therefore (Rule 3) the point sought must be on its right side, and also (Rule I) to the right of the line from B and from C. Locate it exactly according to Rule I. Illustration 7, Fig. 4: When the point sought is on or near the range line between the fixed points, the point sought must be between the parallel lines to satisfy the conditions of Rule 1. Its position with reference to the intersecting line follows from the same rule. .In the figure the point sought being between the lines from B and C, is to the right of each, therefore it is to the right of the line from A. Illustration 7, Fig. 5: When the point sought falls within the great triangle, it must fall within the triangle of error. No other position would satisfy the conditions of Rule 1. Illustration 7, Fig. 6: When the three fixed points are in a straight line. In this case the points are considered as being in the circumference of a circle of infinite diameter and the point sought always lying in one of the segments of the great circle. The treatment of this case is then identical with that of Illustration 7, Fig. 3. · The preceding cases are all examples of the conditions which may occur when the table is deflected to the right. By turning the printed side of the illustration to the light and looking at the figures through the paper, they will appear reversed, and they will then be examples of conditions which may occur when the table is deflected to the left. ' Repetiti<m.-When the true point has been estimated and marked on the sheet in accordance with the foregoing rules, a new orientation is made. If the lines from the three stations now intersect at that point, it proves the estimate to have been correct

and the pos1t101i. is determined. If a new triangle of error is formed, it indicates an erroneous estimate, and the operation must be repeated. Orienting by estimation.-A small triangle of error is the result of a close orientation, which the topographer endeavors to accomplish at the first trial by taking advantage of any range that may exist either of signals or other details already plotted on the sheet. It will serve the same purpose if they are near enough in line to estimate a direction on the sheet to the farthest object, and then to orient by it. The declinatoire may be used, but it is a slow and inaccurate method of orientation. It is employed for this purpose by placing the straight edge of the box containing the needle u1pon a magnetic meridian, previously traced upon the map, and revolving the table until the needle points to o 0 , or north, on the graduated arc at the end of the box. The magnetic meridian is roughly determined at any well-determined station, when the table. is properly oriented by the use of the declinatoire itself, the meridian line being drawn upon the sheet along the straight edge of the box when the needle points to o 0 · Or the table may he oriented by making the straight edge of the box coincide with one of the meridians of the projection and then tttrning the board until the needle points to the right or left of the zero, according to the amount and direction of the magnetic deviation. Bessel's mctlwd b)' inscribed quadrilateral is the simplest meq10d by construction. The objection to it arises from the fact that in practice the intersection of the construction lines often falls beyond the limit of the board. · By this method a quadrilateral is constructed. with all the angles i.n the circumference of a circle, one diagonal of which passes throttgh the middle one of the three fixed points and the point sottght. On this line the alidade is set, the telescope directed to the middle point, and the table is in position. Resection ttpon the extreme points intersects in this line and determines the position of the poin't sought. Illustration 9, Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let a b c he the points on the sheet representing the signals A B C on the ground. The table is set up at the point to be determined ( d), and leveled. The aliclade is set ttpon the line ra, and a directed, by revolving the table to its corresponding signal A, and the table clamped; then, with the alidade centeri~1g on c, the middle signal B is sighted with the telescope and the line ce drawn along the edge of the rule. The alidade is then set upon the line ac and the telescope directed to the signal C, by revolving the table, and the table clamped. 'Then, with the alidade centering on a, the telescope is directed to the middle signal, B, and the line ae is drawn along the edge of the rule. The point e (the intersection of these two lines) will be in the line passing through the middle point and the point sought. Set the alidade upon the line be, direct b to the signal B by revolving the table, and the table will be in position. Clamp the table, center the alidade upon a, direct the telescope to the signal A, and draw along the rule the line ad. This will intersect the line be at the point sought. Resection upon C, centering the alidade on c in the same manner as upon A, will verify its position. The opposite angles of the quadrilateral adce being supplementary, Lace and Lade are subtended by the same chord ae, and Lcae and Lcde are subtended by the same chord ce; consequently, the intersection of ae and ce at e must fall on the line db; or, the segments of two intersecting chords in a circle being reciprocally

proportional, the triangles adj and cef are similar, and the triangles cdf and aef are similar, and d, .f, and e must be in a right line passing through b. In using this meth.od the triangle formed by the three fixed points can be contracted or extended, as may be desirable, by draw'ing a line parallel to the one joining the two extreme points, and terminated by those joining the extremes with the middle point. The graphic solution can then proceed in the same riianner as that described for an original triangle. Tracing-doth protractor.-The third method consists in laying off the angles between the three known points on tracing cloth or paper, and using this as a protractor, deterinine the position of the unknown point. Fasten a sheet of tracing cloth or pa.per to the board, marking upon it a point to represent the unknown point. Draw through it lines toward the three known points. Then shift the tracing clot}:I over the sheet until each of the three lines·passes through the plotted point cor:responding to the point toward which it is drawn. The position of the unknown point will be at the intersection of these lines. This method is less exact and not so convenient as the other two previously described, and is impracticable when the wind blows.
TWO-POINT PROBI;E:\I.

The occasion may arise where "it is desirable to place the table in position at a given point, from which only two determi1~ed points are visible. This may be done by the following methods: One method possesses ihe virtue of requiring no linear measurements, and demonstrates in a very satisfactory manner .the effectiveness of the table in determining position by resection. (Illustration 8, Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5.): Two points, A and B, not conveniently accessible, being given, by their projections a and b, to put the plane table in position at a third point, C. (The capital letters refer to points on the ground, and the small ones to their corresponding projections.) Select a fourth point, D, so that the intersections from C and D upon A and B make sufficiently large angles for good determinations. Put the table approximately in position at D, by estimation or by compass, and draw the lines Aa and Bb, intersecting at d; through d draw a line directed to C. Then set up at C, and assuming the point con the line dC, at an estimated distance from d, and putting the table in a position parallel to that which is occupied at D, by means of the line cd, draw the lines from c to A and from c to B. These will intersect the lines dA and dB at points a' and b', which form with c and d a quadrilateral similar to the true one, but erroneous in size and position. The angles which the lines ab and a' b' make with each other is the error in position. By drawing through c a line cd' making the same angle with cd as that which ab . mak~s with a' b', and directing this line cd' to D, the table will be brought into position, and the true point c can be found by the intersections of aA. and bB. Instead of transferring the angle of error by construction, we may conveniently proceed as follows, observing that the angle which the line a' b' makes with ab is the error in the position of the table. As the table now stands, a' b' is parallel with AB, but we want to turn it so that ab shall be parallel to the same line. Place the alidade on a' b'

APPENDIX 7,

A PLANE TABLE MANUAL.

and set up a mark in that direction, then place the alidade on ab and turn the table until it again points to the mark, then ab will be parallel to AB, and the table is in position. Another method is as follows (Illustration 8, Fig. 6): Two points, A and B, not conveniently accessible, being given by their projections a and b, to put the plane-table in position at a third (undetennined)·point, C. Set up the table at the point sought as closely oriented as can be done by estimation, and resect upon A and B, intersecting the line be at e'. The angle ac' b is the true angle at the point occupied, subtended by AB, being the angle of nature actually drawn; therefore, the true point must be on the circumference of the circle passing through abe'. Construct this circle. Measure off a base, CD, at least half the length of CB., at right angles, or nearly so, to be, in either direction most convenient. Set up a signal at D, and with the alidade draw the line e'd. Remove the table to D, and, by means of a signal at C (the point sought), and the line de', bring the table into a position parallel to that which it occupied at C. With the alidade centering on d, observe the signal B, and draw the line db' intersecting eb at b'. e' b' is the distance of the point C from B, and this distance laid off on the circle ae' b as a chord from b will give e", the true position of the point C. A fourth point may then be occupied, and by resection upon A, B, and C the accuracy of the determination of C verified. Where it is possible to get the two signals A and B in range, it is easy to determine the position of a third point by a method long practiced by topographers. Set up the table anywhere oi1 the range line, and orient by the latter. Resect on the unknown point, drawing the line anywhere on the sheet most convenient. Leave a signal at the occupied point on the range line and set up the instrument at the unknown point. Orient by the line drawn when at the station on the range line, sighting on the latter station. The tible will now be in a parallel position to that when on the range line, which is the true position, and the unknown point may be determined by resection upon the two fixed points and their projections. Deflection of long lines.-In adjusting lines of intersection upon a point or object from a series of stations, when these lines do not coincide in one point, as they are usually derived from signals at unequal distances, the error should not be divided equally among them, hut in proportion to their lengths if the discrepancies are not eliminated by the rules for distortion errors given later. It should be bonie in mind that very short lines from a determined point-as, for instance, to the corners of a fenced road, where the table occupies the center .of the intersection of two roads-may be taken with no apparent error when the table is deflected to some extent from its true azimuth, but that in this case a prolonged line will be considerably out at its further extremity. A long line should never be obtained by the prolongation of a short one from a back station where there is no small check line, or some other point in that prolongation already fixed. It will be apparent that the more nearly at right angles intersecting lines cross each other the more clearly the point will be defined; acute intersections, as far as possible, should be avoided, and, even when they are crossed by a third line at a satisfactory angle, a fourth line, or an accurate rod reading from a well-determined point, is advisable if within reach.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

Sometimes a position is established by measuring along the estimated direction from a near-by fixed point and then orienting by this assumed position and a distant point. This method should be used with caution, but is generally reliable for rodding the detail in the vicinity. Distortion errors. *-The distortion of a plane-table sheet destroys the perfect proportions which exist between the fixed points and their plotted representatives on the sheet. The diagram illustrates the effect distortion would have in the detennination of a point.

A, B, C, etc., are plotted in their true relations. After the sheet has contracted, a, b, c, etc., represent the relations those points have assumed. The paper contracts at a uniform but different rate in each direction. The plane-table is supposed to be at X, the exact center of the figure, and it is required to determine the position by the distorted points a, b, c, etc. By reversing the telescope, we immediately ascertain that we are directly on the line HD. Reversal will also show that we are on the. lines A E, CC, and BF. But the distortion is not apparent until the telescope is pointed at the signals, and the lines are drawn on the sheet. Then if we orient by the line HD, we shall produce the figure of the diagram, giving five determinations, r, 2, 3, 4, and X, each made with four well-conditioned points. Any one of these conditions would be considered satisfactory if we had not the other points to show that something was wrong. To orient by the line BF will produce the same result. But if we take the diagonal AE, we shall have two positions at 5 and 7, formed by the intersection of the diagonal points, with the lines from the other points

running wild. Using the diagonal CG would give two points at 6 and 8, with the lines from the other points running wild as before. Position by compromise.-There is no question that out of the nine positi<:ms developed by these settings, that at Xis the only true compromise. When the sheet is distorted, all positions are compromises; and Xis the true compromise in this case, for it is on the lines CG, AE, etc.: a below and e above, the line connecting A and E, by equal quantities. A line drawn through the distorted points a and e must pass through the middle point X. The positions 5, 6, 7, and 8 can not be true, because lines forming them will not pass through the opposite points when extended, which we know to be. the condition that must be filled. Rules: ( 1) A station made with three points that are on the lines of contraction, the resecting lines forming near'ly right angles at their intersection, will give the true position in relation to all points in the sheet (as Ii, b, d). ( 2) A similar condition of right-angular intersection at the station, but the lines forming diagonals to the lines of contraction, will give the worst possible position for the station (as a, c, and e). (3) A station made with three points on one of the lines of contraction will give the correct orientation of the table (a, lz, and c) but not the correct position. (4) In estimating errors of the point due to distortion, those situated on the lines of contraction require no allowance, however distant. Application.-If the change in the sheet due to contraction or expansion gives the same percentage of the units of length, both lengthwise and transverse of the sheet, the points are still in their true relative position, and the projection is practically as good as when laid on the paper, but is on a slightly altered scale. .When the percentage of change in the units of length is greater in one direction than the other, the sheet and projection are distorted; and to make a station by the three-point problem, the change of scale in each direction must be allowed for. The difficulty in making such allowances is not great, if the principal effects of distortion in the sheet are borne in mind. It would not be permissible, even were it practicable, to make new points on the sheet, as this would destroy the geographic position. It is necessary, therefore, to assume the new points by estimation, applying the percentage of change to the distances measured between the points on the lines of change-that is, on lines parallel to the edges of the sheet. If the point occupied and the point sighted to are on a line parallel, or nearly so, to one edge of the sheet, its movement from the distortion can only be along that line. When the position of the point sighted to is found situated to one side of the line parallel to the edge of the sheet, the distortion will also affect it in the direction at right angles to that edge, and the effect of the distor.tion will be most apparent when the angle of deflection is 45 ° and the position at as great a distance from the point occupied as the paper will permit. As the angle of deflection increases above 45° the effect becomes less and disappears at 90°, when the position will fall again in a line parallel to an edge of the sheet. Referring to the diagram, Illustration 10, to make a station with the three points a, b, c: If the sheet were not distorted, the station would be at X; A, B, and C being the true positions plotted when the projection ':'as drawn. But the sheet having contracted, a, b, and c show the relative positions of these points; therefore we make such allowance

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

for the contraction derived from measuring the unit of length that we can place or imagine a and c to he where they belong, at A and C. b requires no change, as it is on a line Ptrallel to the edge of the sheet. To locate A we must know the distances (approximately) h to a and h to X, which, multiplied by the percentages of contraction (in this case), will give the distance of A above and to the left of a. The same process locates C. If the station were to be made with the points a, c, and e, all three points would have to be imagined in a new position by the same process that A has been located. Stations made in this way will be good for all local sketching within an area that the contraction of the sheet is inappreciable; but to take cuts on distant objects from such a station the orientation of the table must be changed. If an object is somewhere near the direction of a and the table at the compromise station X, the table must be oriented by a and X, the imaginary position A being discarded. The same processes apply to all positions on the sheet for the station occupied. Height ef instrument.-Having obtained the horizontal position on the sheet of the occupied point, the next proceeding in the logical sequence is the determination of the height of the instrument above some datum plane, in order to locate and draw the contours of the area surrounding the station. The angle read and the dii;;tance between the occupied point and the observed point measured from the map, the height is computed by means of the tables to be found at the end of the Manual, or the result can be obtained mechanically by using the hypsograph. This instrnment was designed by Assistant Fremont Morse for use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey and differs from the ordinary fom1 of topographic slide-rule used by engineers in three particulars: First, it is circular instead of rectilinear; second. it does not give elevations in the same unit as the distances, but gives heights in feet when the distances are measured in meters; and third, the arguments used for determinh1g the heights are the horizontal distance and angle of elevation instead of inclined distance and angle of .elevation. The instrument will indicate the difference of height (uncorrected for curvature and refraction) for any distances and angles encountered in ordinary topographic work, with an error much smaller than the probable error of observation of the plane-table alidade. For complete description and directions for use, see Appendix 4, Report for 1902. Relief-There are two methods of representing it-by hill shading and by contours. Hill shading is generally effected by a system of lines, called hachures, drawn in the direction of the slope. When it is steep, the hachures are thick and closely spaced. On the other"hand, a gentle incline will be indicated by fine lines widely separated. Contours* or horizontal curves are the outlines of horizonal sections of ground at different elevations with designated equal intervals between their planes, delineated in their true positions relatively to each other and to the rest of the map, and conforming to the scale of the map itself; or, briefly, a contour is a curve produced by the intersec· tion of the horizontal plane with the surface of the ground. They may also be described

as imaginary shore lines formed at stated or regular elevations, by water which is supposed to rise successively to these elevations over the face of the country. Prr!file.-As each curve has equal vertical ordinates at all points, the el~vation or profile of a hill, as well as a model in relief, can be constructed from the map, when it is accurately executed on a large scale, without further field measurements. A profile of a hill is the outline or trace formed with its surface by a vertical plane cutting the hill in any direction. Illustration No. 13 shows the profile through the line A' B' of the hill It, as represented on a topographic map. The foll parallel lines upon the profile represent the successive heights or sections of the hill of 20 feet, and the broken or intermediate lines x x x those of IO feet. A reference to the letters of the diagram is all that is necessary to a full understanding of the subject: a is the shore line or high-water line upon the map, x x x are the auxiliary IO-foot curves; /' the coincidence of curves upon the chart at the perpendicular face of the hill/, upon the section. This is the only case where contours of different heights run into each other upon a topographic plan. D' is a depression in the face of the hill, represented on the profile by D. d' is a barranca or dry broken gully, and c' c' a water course. It will be plain that if we were to suppose the water to rise to a height of 20 feet above the high-water line, to It on the profile, the 20-foot curve upon the map would become the shore line and the depression D' would fill up and become a pond of water; and if the water were to rise to a height of 30 feet, the dotted broken line would form a shore line, and the knoll G would become an island. Advanta,r;-es and disadvantages of lzill s/1ading and contours.-In a mountainous country the method of hill shading presents a picture which expresses more forcibly to the eye the configuration of the country than a system of contours. But the objection to its sole use arises from the fact that, although one ridge is pcrceh·ed to be higher than another, there is no guide for stating in terms of some linear unit this difference in elevation. It also obscures the symbols representing other details on the surface. A system of contours furnishes a convenient means for obtaining the heights 011 any part of a map, but does not adapt itself to the representation of the small but important accidents of the ground, such as gullies, ledges, rocks, etc.; nor does it satisfactorily delineate such features as cliffs, bluffs, quarries, railroad cuts, and embankments. For these reasons the Coast and Geodetic Survey has adopted both methods, employing hachures for the smaller features and where the steepness of the slope would make the contour lines approach together so closely that individual lines would become indistinguishable, and relying on the contours to delineate less precipitous ground. The t\vo systems can be seen combined when it is necessary to indicate a rocky and broken mountain face. (Illustrations 14 and 1 5.) Tlte contour interval customarily used on the Coast and Geodetic Survey field sheets is 20 feet. When, however, the contour runs very near to some remarkable accident of ground, as a prqminent spur or indentation, a slight deviation above or below its true plane is admissible to include this feature, although it is preferable to avoid doing so, if possible, by the introduction of an auxiliary curve. In abruptly mountainous and C?mparatively inaccessible regions, where sketching must be relied upon, 100-foot curves may suffice to develop all necessary features.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.

Datum plane.-Probably the best plane of reference for heights of points on the earth's surface is the mean level of the sea, since the mean of the rise and fall of the tides is approximately this level. In practice, however, mean high water is usually taken, as it includes all land not covered by the tide range, and is the line dividing land and water. Reference signal.-It is advisable in commencing the survey of a region bordering on tide water to locate one or more signals at the assumed high-water line, carefully noting the height of the top of the flag above the same, to be used in measuring angles of depression for heights from points occupied during the progress of the graphic triangulation. As the heights of other points are determined in the course of the survey and verified from observations from two or three other points, these in turn may he used for the same purpose. The following are the methods of surveying curves of equal elevation : First. The deterruination of the position and heights of a number of characteristic points of the terrene, and with these as gui~es tracing the contour lines. This is the method generally tised in surveys embracing such areas as the sheets of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on scales of 1-10000 and 1-2qooo. It has the merit that the development of the terrene proceeds with the survey of the skeleton, and does not necessitate a return to a station when once occupied. In connection with the determination of position by resection it works harmoniously and economically, since points that would be selected for position as having the best outlook are likely to be the characteristic ones of the terrene. Second: Surveying and leveling the skeleton and its traverses. Third. Surveying and leveling the profile lines. The profile is a traverse line on which are determined the heights of the points at which the surface changes slope. The points where this line is intersected by the successive contour interval are easily determinable with the level and rod. Fourth. Surveying and leveling the base of each level section. To determine the ba!le of each level section the table is set up in position where this level intersects the profile, and using the alidade as a leveling instrument, with a target fixed on the rod at the height of the optical axis of the telescope, the line is traced by locating the rod in successive positions at characteristic points of the terrene, when the target comes in the horizontal plane of the optical axis, direction and distance of the rod being determined and drawn in each case. A line drawn through these points, recognizing features between the stations, locates the curve. In this operation allowance should be made for curvature and refraction, when the distance becomes sufficiently great to make it a factor. Fifth. Surveying and leveling the parts of several level ·sections from one station. When parts of several level sections are run from one station, set up the table at a point on a contour, and observe on a staff the height of the optical axis of the alidade. Set a target on the staff above this height as many contour intervals as its length will include. The aid carries the staff below the instrument and is signaled to stop when the target comes in the hor-izontal plane of the optical axis, and at successive steps traverses the lower curve. The target is then lowered on the staff one contour interval and the next curve above is traced in the same manner, continuing the proceeding until the level of the instrument is reached, when the table is moved to an upper station

and the proceeding continued until the summit is reached. (Applies only t.o very small contour intervals.) Sixth. The division of the terrene into squares, triangles, or parallelograms. By the mode of regular division of the surface into squares, triangles, or parallelograms, pegs are driven at regular intervals, and their heights determined by level in the way that may be most convenient, a spirit-leveling instrument being the most accurate. Station routine.-The topographer having determined his position on the sheet, and also the height of the instrument, proceeds to map the natural and artificial details of the area. surrounding the station. For this purpose the direction of each detail is obtained by pointing the telescope upon it, the edge of the rule cutting the station point; its distance is determined by reading the stadia rod held there for the purpose. This distance is then taken off the metal scale with a pair of dividers and plotted along the edge of the rule. · While this is in progress the aliclade is used both as a level for the observation of objects of the same height as the instrument and for measuring angles of elevation and depression to such of the plotted details whose position at critical points of the contours would materially assist the topographer in tracing them. Number ef elevations to be delermined.-No rule can be laid clown as to the number of elevations that should be determined from each plane-table station or for a given area. It will depend on the skill of the topographer and the modeling of the ground. The number will be adequate when he is confident of tracing, by their aid, the· contours with an accuracy sufficient for the scale and the purpose of the survey. It would indicate careless and slovenly work if the contours were found on examination to deviate frequently from their true position on the sheet by more than half an interval for a slope of less than 5° in an open country. \\Then the slope is steeper, or in wooded regions, a greater latitude is permissible, but even here, in representing the crests of ridges, prominent hill tops, and valley floors, this limit of half an interval should not be departed from for good work.* Contour sketcldug.-The topographer will be assisted in sketching contours, where the modeling is intricate, by lightly drawing a skeleton composed of the ridge lines and thalweg lines (lowest lines of valleys) in their proper positions around the station. On the ridge lines will be found the extreme outward or convex bends of the contours, and on the thalweg lines the extreme inward or concave bends. It can be readily imagined that if each spur and each small depression was represented by its appropriate line, and on each of them were located, either by observation or estimation, points having elevations equal to some multiple of the contour interval, it would be only necessary to connect those points having the same elevation with a smooth curve to have a correct plan of the contours. It will simplify the sketching at a station to draw the highest, lowest, and middle contours first, as they will then serve as guides for estimating the position of the others. J)pical contour groups (Illustration 16 ).-It should be remembered that a contour never splits, as shown in Fig. 1; nor do two contours run into une, as shown in

Fig. 2; nor cross each other, except in the rare instance of an overhanging cliff, as shown in Ffg 3. When an auxiliary contour is introduced, no more of it is drawn than is sufficient to delineate the special feature which makes it necessary. A principal contour, on the other hand, can not have an end within the map; if it commences at one edge it must terminate at another. A closed contour encircled by one or more closed contours is either a hill, as shown in Fig. 5, or a depression, as shown in Fig. 6; the arrows showing the direction in which water would run. The summits of all the hills of importance should have their elevations determined and marked on the map. All depressions without an outlet ~nd which do not contain a pond or lake should be marked with a D at their lowest point. A series of contours, as shown in Fig 4, is either a croupe (the end of a ridge or promontory) or a valley. If a croupe, the contours will have their concave sides toward the higher "ground; if a valley, the contours will have their concave sides toward the lower ground. A combination of four sets, like Fig. 7, with convex sides turned toward each other, represents a dip in a ridge, or the junction of two ridges, and is called a saddle. A pass in a mountain range generally takes the form shown in Fig. 8. Order ef development ef contours.-As the progress of topographic work is usually from the shore line inward, this affords the most favorable direction for drawing the curves of equal elevation, and as it is desirable that all work at a station shall be completed when it is first occupied fo avoid the necessity of returning to it, the curves should be drawn by 'estimation from the shore line to .the points sighted and determined for position and height, to be checked by drawing from those points when in turn occupied. The heights of a sufficient number of points must be determined to guard against any wide range of estimate of height by the eye. In abrupt slopes of considerable extent the use of a pocket clinometer is valuable in determining the degree of slope, and in order to draw the curves by the widtlis of their zones (the cosines of angles of slope) from a paper scale prepared for the purpose. (See Illustration 32.) Fi'lling z"n.-Having completed the work at a given station, the topographer proceeds with his party and instruments to an adjoining locality, where he selects a new station from which he can gather the details of an area bordering upon the one last surveyed. In this manner the skeleton map is filled in by successively occupying stations over the whole expanse of the sheet. Traverse Hnes.-In a wooded country, where it is impossible to find open space with range sufficient to see enough points for deteni1ination of position by resection, it is necessary to run traverses along the roads, with offsets to such lateral features as it may be practicable to reach without the expenditure of excessive labor and time in opening lines of sight. The levels, when necessary, are carried along with the line by observing vertical angles with the alidade upon some mark on the rod, taking back and fore sights at alternate stations. ll'1a£n traverse.-The standard table is used on main roads and whenever the details are important and numerous. The traverse line is started by occupying some point previously determined and sending the telemeter rod ahead to a place selected for its advantageous position,' in

reference either to the surrounding features or facility in obtaining a new section of the traverse. Having sighted to this point, read and plotted the distance, short guide lines should be drawn along the edge of the ruler at both ends and numbered or lettered, so they may be identified from others of like character. The table is then moved to the forward station, approximately oriented by estimation, and the plotted point carefully plumbed over the one on the ground. The alidade is now placed on the table, and the table oriented by bringing the edge of the ruler close up to the guide lines; then revolving the table until the vertical wire bisects the rod or signal left for that purpose at the last station. The same processes which were employed at the initial station are now repeated; the detai.1 is mapped and the new station in advance occupied in turn, tlie line progressing in this manner by successive steps. In running traverses, great care should be taken to sight as low as possible upon the fore and back signals, so as to avoid any error of deflection which might arise from the inclination of the signal poles. Subordinate traverse.-When the line is unimportant and few features present themselves to be noted, an auxiliary plane table oriented by a declinatoire. or a transit, fitted with stadia wires, may be employed. When this method is pursued with a second table the forward rod station is not occupied, but another is chosen in advance of it, from which it can be seen where the instrument is set up and oriented with the declinatoire. Sighting the alidade to what is now the back station, the di~tance is read and plotted along the edge of the ruler, and the point so determined represents the one occupied by the table. _ The pivot on which the declinatoire needle rests should he examined frequently as the least roughness will cause the needle to drag and introduces serious deflections in azimuth. All traverse lines should start and end at well-determined points. This will serve to check the accuracy of the work. If the closing error is not too large, the line should be adjusted by distributing it throughout its length. The line is run on a spare sheet when an auxiliary table is used; then traced, "swung in,". and adjusted between the two fixed points. Determinations .for hJ1drography.-Where the topography surveyed includes the shore line of a body of water, the hydrographic survey of which is intended to follow the topographic work, as in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, it is the duty of the topographer to locate and determine the shore signals, and it is only necessary to state that they should be so placed as to furnish the hydrographic party with as many points as is desirable for the determination of positions on the water. Natural or artificial objects along the shore, or in plain sight from the water, such as fence ends, rocks, prominent houses, etc., should be determined and marked upon the sheet. Lines to buoys and other permanent ·fl.qating objects at anchor should be, as far as practicable, taken at the same stag!:'. of the tide, or direction of current. The mean l~w-water mark should be delineated, and when it is beyond the reach of the plane-table and presents no marked points for determination, or is of a character that will not permit the use of the instrument-as along the swampy shores in the

324

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905·

South, where the muddy shoals extend far seaward, and among the shifting quicksands of our great estuaries and bays-it may be left to be traced by the work of the hydrographic parties. The channels through mud flats of this character should be indicated, however, if only approximately, by cuts and tangents, or the determination of stakes at the turning points. \Vhere the fall of the tide exposes rocks and ledges, shingle beaches, etc., their character and extent should be delineated and distinguished from the sandy beaches, as these features are most 4ifficult and laborious for the hydrographic survey to represent. . Higlz-water and storm-water line.-In tracing the shore line on an exposed sandy coast care should be taken to discriminate between the average high-water line and the storm· water line. Determination ef inaccessible points.-On a precipitous coast, where the shore line is inaccessible and can not be determined hy ordinary methods, the salient features are located, when occupying commanding stations, by observing the vertical angles upon them, and drawing direction lines to them. Then using the elevation of each station as a base the distance to each feature is computed and platted. The same method applies to outlying rocks, and is often employed where there is any doubt of their being identified from different places. Large-scale surveJ1s.-As has been previously stated, 1-10000 and 1-20000 are the scales customarily used in the execution of the topographic work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as they are the ones best suited for the charting of the coast line and harbors of the United States. Other surveys for special purposes have been made from time to time on scales both larger and smaller, and the field practice has been modified according to the requireme"f1ts of the scale used. A topographic survey of the District of Columbia outside the thickly populated limits of th'e city of Washington was made between the years of 1880 and 1891 on a scale of 1-4800. The methods pursued are here described, as they are typical of other surveys on a large scale. Based on a sufficiently minute triangulation, the: plane-table and stadia, wye level, ·and rod were used for all determinations of details. The relief was elaborately indicated by contour interYals of 5 feet. The datum plane is the same as used by the engineer department of the District, on which is based all the levels used for grades of streets and sewers in the city of Washington, the survey being made for the purpose of extending streets and avenues beyond the city limits. From this datum, along all roads, avenues, and railroads, and where roads were infrequent, across country, lines of level were run, and after careful checking in the usual manner bench marks were placed in position convenient to all parts of the region. The plane-table stations were established so as to easily overlook every part of the field and so close together that each was surrounded by the others within the range of a si'ngle reading of the stadia rod. The mode of procedure was as follows: The plane-table was placed in position by a graphic solution of three-point problem. At the same time the height of the level was determined above some near bench mark and the target of the level rod fixed, so that when it was in the line of sight

of the level the bottom of the rod would rest on the ground where the elevation corresponded to that of some contour. The level rodsman then began his journey along this imaginary horizontal line, holding the rod for the observation of the levehuan at each noticeable change in the configuration of the ground. The levelman directed the rodsman by signals at each point until the rod was in position on the contour line, when the stadia rod was substituted and its distance read and plotted on the plane-table sheet. The roclmen followed the cont:our line in both directions from the table as far as the stadia rod could he conveniently read. Generally two and sometimes three contours were run from one level station, and on their completion a turning point was fixed and the level shifted to higher or lower ground, as the circumstances required. A survey of Craney Island, Virginia, was made in the same manner on a scale of I-!200.
RAPID SCRVEYS .

.llfilita1y reconnaissance.-In almost eyery field of operations, from the commencement of the civil war to its close, the plane-table was used. Until this time very little was known, save in theory, of the value of the plane-table as a reconnoitering instrument, and all the officers engaged in the work testify that, for rapidity and accuracy in the execution of military reconnaissance, it is more effective than any other instrument. The system usually adopted, in default of triangulation, was to measure a base with an ordinary chain and to do triangulation with the plane-table. In detailed surveys for the Army, where a topographer averages from r to 3 square miles a day, on large scales a chained base of from one-half to three-quarters of a mile for the sun·ey of an area of 25 square miles is found sufficient . . At Chattanooga, from two different bases of about half a mile each, plotted on separate sheets, and carefully measured once with a common 20.meter chain, the same chain being used to measure both bases, after considerable intermediate plane table triangulation carried on by two officers, two objects were determined 2 ~ miles apart, common to both sheets, which were on a scale of 1-10000, and the discrepancy was but about 15 meters. Many other points of junction indicated this to be the maximum error. In this case the leaves were mostly off the trees and the hills afforded good points. The sheets covered about 20 square miles each. At Nashville there was a discrepancy of about 10 meters in 2 miles. At other times, when the character of the country or the pressure of time did not admit of the measurement of a preliminary base and plane-table triangulation, the work was commenced by starting from a single point and extended by linear measllrement with the chain or stadia, intersections from the ends of the chained lines being taken to determine objects, which, as the work progressed, could also be used as checks upon the chaining. Where circumstances permitted, an occasional return with the chain to a back point, either to close a series of lines upon it or to start afresh, was resorted to. This work was generally carried on over roads and the interior filled in by sketching and intersections as far as practicable. · Some of the tests of this latter work, where the operations of two officers joined, were remarkably close. A very efficient topographic officer estimates that with the usual number of hands and a good sketcher to aid, in a country of average variety of detail, in which all the

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1905·

·houses, prominent barns and outbuildings, streams, roads, general outline of woods, and approximate curves are to be shown, on a scale of l-10000, an area of between 2 and 3 square miles can be filled in daily, with sufficient accuracy for military purposes. This rapidity of work, however, could not be expected in or near towns or populous districts. It is doubtful if, under average conditions, the work would be more than onehalf this amount. In some thickly wooded sections and where time is limited, it has been found advisable to run the main roads with the plane table and fill in with the compass, which is more rapid but less accurate than where the entire work is done with the plane table alone. The usual method employed where these methods were combined, was as follows: Where the army was stationary, or moving leisurely, one main road was run with the plane table, the operator being accompanied by assistants well practiced in the use of the compass. Upon arriving at any important road or water course an assistant was sent to the right and left, starting from a plane-table point, determined by the chaining, and running as far as was requisite and then returning to the main road again to repeat the operation, the compass notes, of course, being kept in a book prepared for the purpose. Prominent points determined by the ·plane table were used as checks in the compass work. The intervening topography, where no compass or plane-table work had been done, was sketched in by the chief of the party, in which accurate pacing became of great value. With compass and notebook.-Plane-table methods can be utilized to advantage when compass, pencil, notebook, and ruler are the substitutes for an instrumental outfit. The book serves as the sheet and board combined, and the ruler, as it was in the early days of the art, becomes the alidade. Plzotogrammetry. "t-In the topographic reconnaissance made for the Alaska Boundary Survey by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the camera with constant focal leJ?gth has been used as an adjunct to the small mountain plane table'. The latter was used to plot the shore line and adjacent topography, also to determine as many peaks of the interior country as possible by the intersection of lines of direction. All camera stations were determined geographically and hypsometrically, and plotted upon the plane-table sheet. The topographic details beyond the reach of the plane-table were ·added to the map in the Office by the photogrammetric methods. The rugged mountains of southeast Alaska· appear particularly well adapted for this mode of procedure, as identical points can be readily picked out from different panorama views, owing to the characteristic shapes of the mountain peaks, snow fields, glaciers, etc. ' Periods of fair weather are aiso very short and of rare occurrence in that locality, and a great deal of topographic material can be gathered photographically in a short time, which when plotted will cover a large territory if a sufficient number of reference points on the views have been located instrumentally. The plotting proper can be carried out to any degree of minuteness and detail; the only requirement is that a sufficient number of camera stations shall have been occupied .. - -----·--------- - - ----------- - - -·- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

to fully cover the territory in question, so that every topographic feature of prominence has been seen or photographed from at least two stations. By this application of photogrammetry the plane-table methods of determining topographic details are extended to the Office, inasmuch as the same features are selected from the panorama views and plotted geographically which would have been located by the plane-table. But the actual time spent in the field is reduced at the expense of the time needed for office work. Surve;1 in advance of tria.ngulation.-Where it is necessary to make a topographic survey in advance of the determination of points by triangulation, a reconnaissance is first made for the location of a base line and selection of points to be determined with the plane table. The base is measured with sufficient accuracy and conveniently, with a steel tape which has been compared with a standard at a fixed tension, and to one end of which is attached a spring balance to secure the same tension during measurement. The successive lengths are marked by lines cut on copper tacks driven in wooden stubs firmly set in the grounc;l. The t.._emperature is noted at frequent intervals as the work progresses, and tf1e corrections are applied to the length of the base when completed. The base is then properly located on the sheet in reference to the area to be embraced and its length carefully set off. It is well at the same time to mark in three or four different parts of the sheet lengths of r ooo meters for the purpose of determining at any time the true scale of the sheet, variable by the different hygrometric conditions of the atmosphere. Signals having been erected at the selected points, the extremes of the base are occupied with the table and the·points, as far as may be reached with good intersections, determined from them and lines of direction drawn to all the points visible, to serve as checks upon their determination from other points furnishing directions for good intersections. The survey then proceeds as usual. It is well at the beginning of work to draw (using the declinatoire) the magnetic meridian, at some determined _point near the middle of the sheet for the purpose of putting the table in approximate position at any station with the declinatoire. The manner of doing this is described elsewhere. Before finishing the field work it is important, when the sheet has no projection, to provide data for drawing a true north and south line. This is done by drawing from a point upon the sheet, when the table is in position, a line in the vertical plane through Polaris and the point occupied and recording the time of observation. The azimuth of the star at that time being known, a true north and south line can accordingly be set off. If a small transit instrument is at hand and carefnlly adjusted for movement in vertical plane, an assistant with a lantern can be located where the vertical plane through Polaris and the point occupied intersects the ground, at as great a distance from the point as the ground will admit within the limit of communication by light signals. When such a position is marked the direction from the point occupied may be determined by daylight. If, in the absence of a transit, the alidade has not vertical range sufficient to observe Polaris, au illuminated plumb line may be used for the alignment.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1905.
OFFICE WORK.

All the topographic features of a survey should be drawn in pencil upon the sheet in the field, while they can be seen. Sketching and plotting in the office from notes, unless the country be near at hand for ready reference in case of doubt or defective data, is objectionable. When this is unavoidable, the sketches should be transferred to the sheet as soon as possible after being made, while fresh in the mind of the person by whom they were made, and by whom they should be plotted. Days which. from inclemency of ·the weather, are unfavorable for out-of-door work should be allotted to this purpose, and advantage should be taken of them, also, for retouching any details of the sheet which may have become indistinct, as it is very important that they should not be left indefinite or become obliterated; for when the inking is done, a-; it generally is, at a distance· from the field of operations, the necessity f~r this care is obvious. Nos. 4 and 5 pencils are good for this purpose, for which very hard or very soft and black pencils are equally unsuited. In the inking of a topographic sheet three requisites to its proper appearance when finished should be borne in mind-clearness, neatness, and uniformity. The lines and objects should be Clear and sharply defined, nothing being left obscure or doubtful; the paper should be kept unsoiled, and erasures avoided as far as possible, and the style and strength of the drawing should be the same throughout. It is an important matter that an easy and natural appearance should be given to the sheet, for, as before remarked, a mere rigid adherence to conventional signs is not all that is necessary; while there should be no deviation in this respect, at the same time the draftsman should strive to represent the country. There is a great difference with regard to this among topographers. Two correct sheets of the same section of ground, executed by different persons, may be inked, and while one will have a stiff and ungraceful look, the other will appear a:~istic and natural, giving at once the impression of a true representation of the country surveyed. Office work should not be commenced until the topography is entirely completed, as no inked or partially inked sheet should ever be used in the field. Sometimes, for the special examination of old work, or for the insertion of some recent artificial or natural changes, this becomes necessary, but there is always a risk of injuring an inked sheet by exposure to the weather or by using it upon a plane table. The inking should begin with the high and low water lines. The high-water Jin~ or shore line proper should, in all cases, be full and black, the heaviest line on the sheet, and in this, as in all the rest of the ink work, the lines of the surveyor should be strictly adhered to. The topograph)·, as drawn in the field is supposed to he correet when the sheet is finished, and no office amendments or changes are admissible. The low-water line is drawn, not so full as the former, but clear, black, and uniform, consisting of a dotted line for sand and mud and the conventional sign where it is formed by shells, rocks, or coral reefs. ' Neither the inner border of a marsh nor a shoal covered at high tide has a distinct continuous line to mark its limits, each being represented in its proper form and within its area by its conventional sign only, but the shape should be well and correctly

defined. All objects between high and low water, covered at full tide, should be represented less boldly than the other features on the sheet, but not faintly or indefinitely. The roads should be inked plainly and evenly, with their sides parallel, except where the survey shows a de·viation from the general width. Main thoroughfares when fenced are drawn with a full line, subordinate roads where fenced should be shown by the usual sign, and where there is ro inclosure a line of dashes should indicate the roadside, and then should follow the fences and houses. In drawing the latter, care must be taken that the corners and angles exhibit a sharp, clear outline, which adds much to the appearance of the sheet. The general skeleton of the survey being now completed, the contours are drawn with a bold, uniform, plain red line, without break, over all the other work, following accurately the full range of level of each of the contours on the sheet. After this comes the general filling in, byconventional signs, of sand, marsh, grass, cultivation, orchards, rocks, hachures, etc. Some practice is needed to execute the sand work regularly and neatly. It should never be done hurriedly, though of course rapidity in this respect follows practice. The lines representing marsh, and the delineation of grass on the fast ground, should always run in the same direction over the whole sheet and be parallel to the top of the sheet and the title. The appended drawings (Illustrations I 7, 18, 19, 20, and 2 r) give the conventional signs as adopted by and · now used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The most difficult part of the inking for a beginner is the lettering, which now follows, and for which samples are gi~·en (Illustration 22). It is expected that every topographer shall have learned to draw sufficiently well to ink his sheet in a clear and distinct manner and letter it with some regard to neatness and graphic effect, as the appearance of an otherwise well-inked sheet is marred by careless or indifferent lettering. The location o.f the names upon the sheet should be such as not to cover or obliterate any detail or feature of the survey, and the letters should be put on neatly and gracefully, and in point of size and form according to the specimens furnished. The title should follow, with such notes as may be necessary to explain any peculiarity of the sheet or survey.* This title and lettering should, as far as practicable, be so placed that when the sheet is held with the top (the north end of the map) from you it .can be easily read; in other words, as nearly parallel to the top or upper end of the sheet as the nature of the work will admit. All names \Vell established and recognized in a neighborhood, both general and local, should be collected during the survey, and their correct orthography ascertained, and in case of any doubtful or disi;mted orthography a report should be made giving any traditions or authorities which bear upon the subject. N~ illuminated or German text, old English, or what is known as ''fancy printing,'' should be indulged in, a strict adherence to simplicity being required. The minutes of the parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude should be marked in figures at the upper and right-hand ends, respectively, the degrees on the center parallel and center meridian only. When buoys are determined by the topographer, and their names, colors, numbers, or kind are known, they should be placed on the sheet and so marked.
*The topographers in the Coast and Geodetic Survey are required to write the title and notes on a separate sheet of paper an<l attach it to the plane table sheet. This portion of the lettering is done at the Office.

When it is desired to use the preceding table, a sight must be attached to the rod or the proper position of the rod left to the judgment of the rodsman. The usual and safer way is to have the rod held yertical for all readings. There are then two corrections to be applied, one to reduce the inclined distance to a horizontal one and one for the oblique view of the rod. The equation for reducing tlie readings is: Horizontal distance=r cos· v+(c+f) cos v Where r=reading of vertical rod; v=angle of elevation or depression; c=distance of object glass to center of instrument; f =focal length of telescope. The following table gives the coefficient of reduction by which the rod re~ding is to be multiplied. It is based on the assumption that c+f is to be added to the result to obtain the distance to the center of the instrument. Example: Given an angle of elevation or depression 8° 10' and the reading of the inclined sight on vertical rod= 173. 1 meters. From the table:

Point B is 195. 62 feet above point A. . Formula for determining heights by a vertical angle and distance.-The difference of level consists of two parts-that which arises from the angle of elevation above the horizontal plane of the station and that which is due to the curvature of the earth. The former depends upon the angle and distance, the latter upon the distance and the earth's radius. If a' be the angle of elevation in minutes of arc, d the distance, h the height, then, as the tangent of r' is lrfi . 1., we have for the first part h=ll'fi"fa'd, if h and dare both expressed in the same units of lengtli, but if dis expressed in meters and h in feet, one meter being 3.28 feet, we get It= I n-ga'd. For the fraction Tn"B" we may conveniently. and with sufficient accuracy put 1 u'-o-lf less ~ of ro"o..0-, and thus find the rule: Jl.fttltipl.Y the distance in meters b)' the number of minutes of arc, point off tlu: tlzousandth part, and subtract tlze twentieth part of the number thus obtained. This will give the first po'rtion of difference of height, \Vhether elevation or depression. 'fhe second term, depending on the curvature, varies as the square of the distance, and amounts to o. 22 foot in 1000 meters, including the effect of ordinary refraction. As with the instruments under consideration extreme accuracy is not attainable, it is plain that for distances under 1000 meters this term may be neglected .. When the distance is greater, we have the following rule: Take the tlzousandtlz part of tlze distance in meters, square the same, having regard to the first decimal figure, and multiply by 0.22. This term is always positive. If the first term be an elevation, it is increased; if a depression, it it diminished by the second term. Example.-Distance=ssoo meters; angle of elevation, 36'.
rifund xa'=198.ooo subtract '!'tr 9.9 first term' 188. 1 second term 6.6 sum

= 5.5 square =30.2 multiply by 0.22
second term 6.64

194. 7=differen'ce of elevation in feet.

for computing differences i'n elevati'on.*

To obtain the difference in elevation in feet multiply the horizontal distance in meters by the factor in this table corresponding to the observed angle of elevation or depression. The factors are given for each ten minutes, but the value for the nearest minute may be interpolated, using the column of differences for one minute. The result is still to be corrected where necessary for the effect of curvature and refraction. TABLB III.

ef correcli.ons for curi1ature and refraction.*

The correction in feet for the combined effect of curvature and refraction is given for each loo meters' distance, the thousands of meters being given in the column to the left and the hundreds in the upper line. The correction is to be added to the dijference of elevation for angles of elevation and subtracted for angles of depression, or it is always to be added to the uncorrected elevation of the point to be determined from point of obsen;ation. Example: At a station whose elevation is rooo feet (at telescope), angle to signal=3° elevation, horizontal distance=5000 meters. From Table III factor is 0.1719, which multiplied by 5000=859.5 feet. From Table IV correction is 5.5 feet. Corrected difference of elevation=859.5+5.5=865 feet, which added to 1000=1865 feet for elevation of signal. If the above angle to signal be 3° depression, then corrected difference of elevation=859.5-5.5=854 feet, which makes height of signal= - 1000-854= 146 feet.

Example: At a station whose elevation is 304.80 meters (at telescope), angle to signal 3 ° elevation, horizontal distance sooo meters. From Table V factor is o.os24, which multiplied by S ooo= 262.00. From 'table VI correction 'is 1.67 meters. Corrected difference of elevation=262.oo+ 1.67=263.67 meters, which added to 304.8o=s68.47 meters for elevation of signal. If the above angle to signal be 3° depression, then corrected difference of elevation 262.oo--1.67=26o.33 .meters, which makes height of signal=304.80-260.33=44.47 meters.
