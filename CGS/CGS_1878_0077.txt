0.FFICE OF THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Wasltington, December IO, 1878. Srn.: I have the honor to transmit this report, showing in detail the proµ,Tess made in the sur,·ey of the coa.<>ts of the United States and geodetic operations prosecuted in connection with that work in the course of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878. The field parties and the vessels used for transportation are of necessit.;\· exposPd to all varieties of climat('. and t-0 all extremes of weather. It is therefore a subject of g-reat satisfaction to report that. the vicissitudes of the year, so sadly marked by unusual mortalit.v in one section of the TTnion and by the record of man.r st-0rrns along the coast, ba;-e entailed no disaster t-0 the service. Of several parties on the shores of the Lower Mississippi one remained at work until late in August. Yellow fever was then raging above and below the working ground, but the operations were in no instance delayed by sickness." On the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific coast of the L"nited States, an aggregate of twenty-nine Yessels has been in employ. The usual risks have been met by the parties when afioat, but no loss has been incurred beyond the outlay for repairing the slightly injured Yessels. In January last one of the steamers of the survey was in great peril during several da;rs in the Gulf of :Mexico, but was finally relieved by the exertions of her officers and crew. Of this incident further mention will be made in connection with a notice of the work in whicli the vessel was at_ that time engaged. As heretofore the aim has been st-Oadily maintained of limiting the outlay for each party to the least sum consistent with its efficiency. All items in estimates for outfit and for mouthly expenditures in field work and hydrography have been closely scanned, and it is gratifying to add that the assistants have cheerfull,r sustained all arrangements for promoting economy. A few years ago the hydrography, for want of suitable vessels, was left behind the field work, but recently the adv~nce made hy the sounding parties has nearly equalized progress as between those branches of the service. In the course of the fiscal year ending June 30, 18i8, the ltydrography was prosecuted by fifteen parties working in twenty-four localities. Each of the Navy officers who have conducted work under m,v direction, and the officers associated with tl1em, will be named in separate notices of the work done by the several parties. It gh·es me pleasure to record that the officers detailell from the Navy Department have worked with energy and intelligence. Their efficiency in the discharge of duty is a gratifying evidence that' the present naval standard befits the honor of the nation, and secures the well-being of one of its most important interests. The distribution of all the parties in the course of' the year is gfren in tabular form in AJlpenllix N<>. 1, which shows in geographical order the localities of the work. It will be seen that progress bas been made in t-Opographical development on parts of the coast, not heretofore included within the limits of operations. That the work should he advanced yearly over new or unsurveyed ground has been regarded as an imperative duty, but while sustaining that policy, some regard, of necessity bas been given t-0 calls for the revisiou of h,plrogmph~' at import.mt localities when the expense to be incurred was comparatively light,. .. _______ -·- -·-----·-------------·-·----·- ... -"------·----·-·-

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

At several of our principal seaports the local authorities have appropriated means for revising the shore line and soumli11gs of early surveys, so as to develop changes that have occuITed .and afford dM.a for the stay of encroachments. These in most cases have caused alterations hurtful to the channefo, lmt the injury done can be ascertained only by careful resmTey. \Vhen the facts are ascertained and proper restraining limits are pointed out, further encroachment on the water space is prohibited by municipal or hy legislatirn action. \Yith means furnished hy the State of Maryland a complete reimrvey bas been made of the outlines and water space of the harbor of Baltimore, and similar work is now in progress at Philadelphia, for wliich mcan8 were provided by the city authorities. These operations keep mainly in view the data requisite for answering inquirie;; as to the causes of alteration for the worse; hence tl1e shore-line sluvey and soundings are conjoined with elaborate observations of the cnITents, aml compariso11 of their courses and velocities with those of earlier periods. ~umerous observations are recorded, aud the is:me of their discussion is to point out restrictions needful for the preservation of tlie harbor. As already said, each of the principal ports of the Atlantic seaboard <has been for such purposes under consideration by the local authorities, and more recently the harbor of Norfolk. Ju all tlie instances here alluded to, appeal has been made for the services of trained observers, and, as already intimated, such calls have been favorably met in cases in which officers of the government have been associated as advisory boards with harbor commissioners. Pay of hands and all expenses incidental to the resurveys of harbors have been borne by the local authorities. Arnl if we regard the pn~jeded improvements in such cases as,purely local, and leave them out of view, it iH neYertheless desirable that the apprOJlriations for the Coast apd Geodetic Surve~· should he l'Ufficient for maintaining tlue progress in the regular work, and for providing at the same time the means for revising hydrography in which national interests are involved, so far as related to general nmigation, and in which appeal cannot be made to municipalities. Cases of this kind, beyond the range of riparian interests or ownership, will be cited in the frtrther mention which will be made presently under the head of estimates. The geodetic work of the survey, resulting in finally-determined positions on land, of course suffers no change under causes that affect here aml there the shore-line surveys an<l the hydrography, nor so far as yet known any change whatever. Nevertheless, geographical points, ·whether determined bJ· astronomical observations or by triangulation, depend for exactness of relation upon prc,·ious knowledge respecting the figure of the earth. Dnring the last hundred years the interest manifested in geouetic operations has been steady, but through all the <>arlier parts of that period the interest was necessarily prospective. The question at i1;sue could not be solved until data hafl been accumulated by measurements made on the surface of the earth over wide ranges of latitude and iongitude. Europe, Asia, Africa, and America have contributed material, so far as geodetic work has been extended, for determining the figure of the earth, and at no preceding time has the interest in regard to that qtrnstion reached the degree of earnestness now generally manifested. In order to further in all ways possible such means as migl1t be taken to secure the object sought, the leading scientific men of Europe have instituted an International Geodetic Association. The annual meetings of that body have greatly enhmwBd the spirit of research, and will probably lead to renewed exertions and to the adoption of all expedients that the science of the present day may be able to present for an early and satisfactory settlement of the question. With the sanction of the Treasury Department our own country is fitly represented in that association hy Assistant J. E. Hilgard. The methods used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey lrnYing been kept in a<:cord with all improvements, the geodetic work of the United States is properly regarded in Europe and in the Geodetic .Association as being fully equal in grade to any work of the kind. Our interest therefore in the question concerning the figure of the, earth may be considered as commensurate with the extent of our territory. The geodetic operations now in progress, and of which further mention will be made in the body of tl1is report, are so arranged as to furnish points for eoITectiug maps of the interior, and at the same time to add largely to the data needful for determining the magnitude and figure of the earth in general, and especially in regard to the figure most nearly in accord with the surface 01 the United States. Our first contributfon in results such as have been eagerly desired by successive

masters of geodetic science in times past will be the computed length of the arc of the 11wrf1lia11 extending from Nantucket Island to Mount Blue, in Maine; the length of the arc from Ocracoke Inlet, N. C., to the head of Chesapeake Bay, in l\far;yland; and the oblique arc upwards of twelYe hundred miles long, beg-inning at Calais, on the northeastern uoundary of the United States, arnl extending southward and westward to Atlanta, in Oeorgfa. These measureH are all dcriYed from the main triangulation of the Atlantic coast. In the course of a few years, if meanH are aYailable, data will be at hand for assigning the true measure of one of the longest parallels of latitude trawirsir{g the area of the United States. When complete the chain of great triangles for the geodetic connection betweeu the surwy of the Atlantic coast and that of the Pacific coast, will stretch east and west. nearly twenty-six lmndred miles, and the work will bind together in true geogTaphical and geodetic relation all interYening States along or near the 39th parallel, and indirectly all the other States and Territories of the Union. The hydrography of the Gulf of Mexico will be a subject of mention under the 11eacl of Section VIII, in Part II of this report. ·when the gulf soundings were so far a(1Ya11ced as to giYe certainty, and therefore special value to researches in regard to living forms that inhabit deep-sea bottoms, Prof. Alexander Agassiz, of Harvard, was notified that trawls and dredges would be sent with the vessel, and was invited to accompany her with an assistant to superintend the dredging " collections, take charge of and report upon such specimens of deep-sea and other ocean fauna as might be brought up by the hydrographic party of Lieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbee, C. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, in t,he steamer Blake. Professor Agassiz promptly accepted the invitation and joined tbe part~-, with his assistant, l\lr. S. ,V. Garman, expecting to return after a short stay in the Gulf to hil'l duties at C'amhridge. But, early in the cruise, the vessel, while under charge of a Spanish pilot, v.-as stranded on a reef off the coast of Cuba, and was relieved from imminent peril only by the steady courage of her officers. Although inconvenienced by the unexpectkld delay, Professor Agassiz remained near b,v and effectively aided in obtaining assistance, and when the steamer was again afloat pursued the iutended investigations. The results were incidentally gathered, but the)" are ample, and "·ill he recognized by naturalists as adding greatly to the means for investigation in conrses purs1.1ed elsewhere by expeditions fitted out at great cost in Europe. The specimens procured by deep-sea dredging in the Gulf of Mexico were assortecl b~' Professsor Agassiz, and committed for final im'estigation to naturalists severally the most eminent in the branches of study to which the different specimens pertain. In pursuance of arrangements to which reference was made in my last annual report, a num her of stations were occupied, in the course of the fiscal year, for g·aining needful knowledge in regard to the variation of the compass, or declination of the magnetic needle. ~4.long the Atlantic coast of the Unit,ed States the declination is well known, observations having been made iucident~lly at many stations, as shown on a sketch appended to this volume. But whatever the declination may be at any one position near the coast, a line along which the magnetic needle has the same variation can be well tra-0ed out to sea only by starting from points in the interior, at which points the same variation has been actually found. Hence the necessity of distributing obsen'ations over a large area. The stations included in the operations of the present year, and which have not been previously occupied, will be mentioned in the body of this report, and also in .Appendix No. 1. The discus8ion of the 8ecular change of the magnetic declination has been continued by .Assistant Charles A. Schott, all recent·observations being taken into account for bringing the results up to· the present time. In June last he repeated the determinations, which haw been heretofore made annually, of magnetic measures at the reference station in Washington, D. C. At the observatory in Madison, which was erected by the authoritie8 of the I~niversity of 'Visconsin, magnetic observations have been kept up during the year. The instruments, furnished from this Office,.are self-registering, and have yielded continuous photographic traces that indicate even the least magnetic perturbation. The first year's records from this obserYatory have been discussed, and the results will soon be arranged for publication. From the tidal division of the Office printed tables are issued annually, predicting all the tides of the coming year for ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States.

REPORT OF THE SUPERIN'l'ENDENT 01'' THE

The times are given with a near approach to precision at special places where long series of obRervations were recorded in past years, hut with somewhat less exactness for intermediate poRitions. l<'or some year.s the tables have been regarded as necessary aids in the navigation of our coasts. These tidal predictions result from the application of systems of anal,ysis and discussion that have been from time to time improved, but chiefly by modifications of methods formerly in use. The last improvement in analysis, and known as the "hrumonic method," was devisetl by Sir William Thorrnmn, anrl has been adopted by the tidal committee of the British Association for the Adrnncement of Science. By this treatment the tide is followed hourly, and is scanned in strict accordance with time through the entire series of observations. The tidal records of Pulpit Harbor, North Haven, in the Fox Island group, Penobscot Bay, Maine, for a period of six years, have been a11alyzed by the harmonic method and discussed by J\Ir. 'Yilliam Fenel of tlw Coast and Geodetic Survey. His report on the subject (Appendix No. 11) ex1)laim; the principles of this kintl of analysis which, in application, is not restricted to tidal observations, but may be used for any series of numerous observations made at equal intervals of time. Then follows, in the paper, the application of these principles for the determination of tidal constants of all the principal tide components, derived from the Pulpit Harbor observations. The results arc thoroughl.r di8cussed and compared with theory, and with results obtained by the same method in other parts of the worltl. Means are thus afforded for a careful examination of the tidal theory. In this connection, also, the paper shows that much study has been given to the character of the tides in shallow waters. l\Ir. Ferrel, in concluding, applies results for· computing and predicting tides along the whole coast of New England, the type of the tide appearing to be the same throughout, as shown by comparing results from the Pulpit Harbor series with those dcrh·ed from the series recordetl in Boston Harbor. To illustrate the nature of the work proposed in the detailed estimates which were submitted to the department in October last, a synopsis was given showing the field and office operations of . the past fiscal year. The synopsis is here inserted as usual in 1n·evions annna.l reports. It will be noticed that the work has been a1h·auced in upwards of one hundred localities on the Atlantic coast, Gulf of .'.\Iexico, and Pacific coast of the United States, including geodetic stations intermediate between the eastern and western coasts. For convenience, the work of the land and hydrographic parti{!s will be recapitulated in the usual geographical order.

'l'he estimate;.; for continuing the work of the Coast and Geodetic SnrYey during the fiscal year ending .Tmw ;{O~ lbRO, \Yere "nbmitted to the department in October last. The aggregate of estimates then presented, althong·h greater than the appropriation of' the current fiscal year, is much lt>ss thau tlie amonuts first sulnnitted iu October of the preceding ;year. In consequence of reduced appropriations during seYeral yea.rs, it has been impossible to revise the surveys of several important localities with 1lne regard to the prO.(..'l'CRS to be made at the same time over new ground. For several yean; the interests of commerce have required that the hydrography should be revisetl in Long Island Sonnd; in New York nay; in Delaware Bay and Hiver; at U1e Missisisippi River Delta; ill San .Fra1wiE:co Hay; at the Colmnbia Hiver entrance; and at other localities where changes Jmn· taken ph1<·e in tlw course or direction of the channels. 'rhe amounts stated in the estimate;.; barely snflke for rnakiug· such ad\·auces in the work as would keep pace with the rate of deYelopment. Along the grtat. inland waters of \Vashington Territory, all points available for commercial 1mrposes hnYe already attracted the attention of settlers. The estimates for continuing the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the Unifa~d States during the year ending ,fone :30, J8g0, are intended to proYide for the following progress: FrnuFwonK.-To continue the topography of the western fibore and islands of Passamaquoddy Ba.Y and its estuaries; to complete the topograpl1y between Penobscot Bay and Narragnagus Hay, mid that of tlie RhorPs of the PenobRcot near Bangor; for the determination of heights at sonw of the prineipal trigonometrical point8 between Boston and the Saint Croix, and of coefficient,. of rnfraetion; to complete the h~·drography between Penobscot Bay and Narraguagus Bay, and continue Houmlings iri tl11· eoaRt approaches eastward of Petit ]Hanan Island; to continue a topog-raphical and hydl'Ogrnphic survey of rortsmouth Harbor; to make such additional triangulation as may be requisite for that and other surveys on the eastern coast, and determine the position of new light-houses hetweeu Eastport, .Me., and New York; to continue soundings along tl1e coast of Maiue, and other~ ofi~shore b~·drography between Cape Cod and Manan, and make special examiuation for the sailing liues for charts; to continue the observations of sea and tidal currents in the Gulf of :Maine; to continue tidal observations, and to make sucl1 itstronomical and magnetic observations as nwy he rpqnil'ed; to continue sneh topographical and hydrographic resurveys of the coast between Cape Cod and New York as may he found necessary; to continue the survey of the Com1ectknt Hi ver from its mout11 up to Hartford; to make such examination as may be required in New York Harbor, an<i such surveys in its vicinity as may be found necessary, including· t.l1e continuation of the topographical and hydrograpbic resurvey of the south coast of Long Island; to make along this 1mrt of the coast ohservations on tides and currents ; to extend the 11lane-tahle smTt\V of tl1e H nelson niver above PeekRkill; t,o continue the triangulation between the Hndson l:.iYer and Lake Champlain; to make the requisite astronomical observations; to continue the topogTaJlhical and bydrographic resurYeys of the coast of New Jersey, and of Delaware Bay and Hiver; t-0 connect the Atlantic coast triangulation with that of Chesapeake Bay, near the houndary line. between l\faryland aud Virginia; to complete the detailed survey of James River, Va., including the h~'drography, and continue the plane-table survey of the Pot-0ma.c River; to coutiune souUnntrd the main triangulation from the Atlanta base to the Mississippi River at or near .Memphis, including astronomical and magnetic observations; to continue the su11plementary hydrography between Cape E:enlopen, Del., and Cape Henry, Va., and in Chesapeake Bay, and

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
OBITUARY.

One of tbe most uReful members of the Coast Survey Office, Mr. John T. Hoover, died in the forty-fourth year of his age of rapid pulmonary decline on the 25th of May, 1878. ·within the fortnight preceding that date he was at the office as usual, efficiently discharging duties to which be bad been long accnstmned. Mr. Iloover entered the senice in boyhood, and, in addition to native inllustry aud patience, brought a decided aptitude for method and dispatch in office details. These qualities were happily united with an amiable disposition and constant readiness to further the interests of the work. He was throughout life greatly esteemetl by a large circle of friends-in the church where he was active, in leading charitable societies, of which he was an officer, and in the office to the duties of which his energies were devoted. In each of these bis tact and facility in the discharge of business were cheerfully made effective for the benefit of his associates.

PART II.
The distribution of the field and hydrographic parties in the course of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1878, is shown in tabular form in Appendix So. 1. :Following the order in which the parties are therein mentioned, abstracts will now be given of reports on the work done in each localit,r. Much of the efficiency in the service depends upon mea11s of transportation and accommodation. Eleve11 steamers, of from three hundred and fifty down to sixty tons burthen; eighteen schooners, of from one hundred and sixty.four to thirty tons burthen, and four small steam launches have been employed in the work of the year. In the oversight needful for keeping all the vessels in goo<l condition, and careful supervision of the estimates for outfit and repairs, I have been ably assisted by Commander Edward P. I,un, U.S. N., hydrographic inspector of the Coast and Geodetic Surrny. The patient application of that accomplished officer, and his readiness in giving personal attention to the requirements of the service at points however distant, have greatly furthered the interests and success of the survey. Lieut. "rilliam H. Parker, U. S. N., assisted in the office of the hydrographic inspector from August 13, 1877, until the rnth of June of the present year. On the 28th of June, 1878, Lieut. Commander Philip H. Cooper, U.S. S., was assigned to duty in tlie Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey. This report was then closing, but"arrangcments were in progress for the periodical examination of depth on the bars of harbors along the Atlantic coast. The details of this service arc in charge of Lieutenant-Commander Cooper, and will be the subject of mention in my next annual report. vV. H. Mapes, inspecting engineer, as in past ;years, remltrs, 1111der the direction of the hydrographic inspector, faithful serdce in the supervision of repairs and of alterations when requisite on the vessels of the surrny. His intelligence and care in the cxecntioJI of details committed to his charge e'\'ince high regard for the best interests of the work. The abstracts which follow are illustrated by the seveml progress sketches, as numbered in the heading of each of the sections. The general progress made in the sm-ve;y~s shown in Sketch No.1.

Hydrography of the coast of Maine.-The approaches of the coast of Maine in the vicinity of Mount Desert Island have been sounded by a party in charge of Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. N., Assistant ()oast and Geodetic Survey, working with the steamer Endeavor. 1''or the erection and location of signals the vessel left Rockland on the 26th of June, 1877, and was employed in that preliminary work until the 5th of July, when soundings were begun. Tidal observations were at the same time mmmeuced at Bass Harbor. The hydrographic work was frequently interrupted by heaYy fogs, but unusually good weather prevailed during September and until the middle of October. A. few days of remarkably clear weath('r were improved by running from Mount Desert Rock three radial lines northward and westward to connect with the inshore hydrography, which last-mentioned work was extended by Lieutenant l\Ioser from the vicinity of Schoodic Point to the limit of previous operations ne.ar Isle au Haut. A few radial lines of soundings were 'also run to seaward from Mount Desert Rock. In that Yicinity the steamer Endeavor was repeatedly run in difforent directions over the Columbia Ledge, but no depth of less than four fathoms was found. Near the shore the bottom consists of rock, but further out the specimens brought up in sounding showed stiff, dark clay, with small broken pieces of horublendic rock. The work done by the party of Lieutenant Moser developed the hydrography coastwise for a

Lieutenant Moser was assisted during the season by .!\faster J.B. }forelock, U.S. N., and Master F. E. Greene, U. S. N. 'Yhile working southward of Mount Desert., Lieutenant Moser's attention was called to the site of a rock between Sutton's Island and Great Cranberry Isla11d. Aftm· due search the danger was found about midway in the beating channel between the two islands. The rock is small at the top, and has on it only seven and a half feet at mean low water. Being little known it was marked on the chart as Sperlin Rock, after the name of the resident of Cranberry Island who made known particulars which aided in the deYelopment. I,ate in June a ledge was developed between I'emaquid Point and Monhegan Island. The least water found was seventeen feet on what seemed to be the pinnacle of a rock. Topography of Skilling Rfoer, Jlfe.-North of the site of work mentioned under the preceding head, the topographical survey of the main coast has been a<lYanced in the vicinity of Skilling River, one of the estuaries of l·'renchman's Bay. For this work Assistant Charles Hosmer took the field in the middle of .Jiuly, 1877. The weather was \'ery nnfavomble, but iu the eourse of six weeks the usual margin of topographical details had been mapped to represent tlie sliores of Partridge Cove and Raccoon Cove. When the survey was well in hand with a prospect of joining to the westward with plane-table work, which will be notieed presently, :Mr. Hosmer was prostrated by a sudden attack of illness, and in consequence the field party was discharged at the end of August. Assistant Hosmer, as soon as possible, proceeded to his home, and by careful treatment was in due time restored to his accustomed health. The statistics of the work done by him in this sectiou are : ]\files of sho:i;e line surveyed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 281 Hoads, miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 Area of topography, square miles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... __ . _ 3 In the spring of the present year Assistant Hosmer again took the field for serdce, which will be noticed in this report under tlie bead of Section VIII. Topography of Blue Hill Bay, Me.-For continuing the survey of the coast of Maine to the north ward and westward of Mount Desert Island, a part,y was organized to work under the charge of Assistant A.\\'. Longfellow, and took the field on the 22d of .June, 1877. .Toining at the western limit of the sheet projected for the survey of this season with plane-table details which had been mapped in a previous year as far eastward as Blue Rill primary station, Mr. Longfellow surveyed the north shore of Blue Hill Bay, and extended bis work eastward to include Newbury Neck and the opJiosite shore of Union River Bay. The north end of J,ong Island also appears on the topographical sheet. "The general character of the topogra1>hy upon the north shore of Brue Hill Bay is a rough, wooded, granite hillside, the quarries of which furnish the principal industry of Blue Rill Village. These quarries supply to the government, and to many cities of the Uuion, an excep. tionally fiue quality "Of dressed stone for public buildings." The small islands and ledges in Blue Hill Bay are represented on the plane-table sheet. Field work was closed on the 22d of September.

bis party from Belfast on the 22d of May, 1877, to continue the hy<lrographic work sout11war<l and eastward of Eggemoggin J{eacb, and beyond Naskeag Point, where soundings were dosed last year. In the course of ·a week the n·fp1isitc "ignah; were all in place, and tidal obserYation8 -were in progress. Soundings were then begun in .Jericho Bay, a11d the weat:ier being fayorahle, the pr~je.ction was filled by the end of June. The outer limit of the hydrographic sheet includefl the shore of Swan Island. Special attention was gh·en by Lieutenant Hawle_v to the dew·lopmeut of rocks aml shoals in Jericho Bay. "The titles iii the hay hetwt>eu Deer Isle and the mainland on the north, and Swan Island on tlie south, set east and west, the floo(l setting to the westward. AJ the western end of Swan Island it sweeps around towards the Hca, and the general direction of the set being northwest and southeast, the tidal current is strong in th(' narrow channels, but its force is influenced by the wind." Among the dangers determineu in position is Thornlmsh Ledge, at the eastern entrance of .N"askeng· Harbor. The work here nuder notice was done with the steam launch Sagadahoc, the schooner being· used for quarters at her anchorage in Saskeag Harbor. On the 1st of Jnly the Hebooner Bamest left her anchorage and proceeded to Isle au Haut, but on the way' a tide gauge wa8 put up at Green's Landing. The ve;,;;.;el was thPu hrought to anehor in the Thoroughfare, and a party was organized, in charge of Master G. U. Hanus, U. S. N., to make a hydrographic suney of Head Harbor. In this place, at the south end of Isle au Haut, the schooner Earner;t. had heen caught by a heaYy southwest. gale, and cast ashore, as mentioned in my report of last yeal'. TIH~ part~' detailed for the survey left the Tboroughfare in the steam lanuelt and cutter on the 5th of July, aml completed tl1e Hnn111ling of Head Harbor in the course of the next nine days. Tidal observations were continued at Head Harbor, Isle au Hant Thoroughfare, and Green's Land· ing while the soundings were in progress. The work, as pro,·e<l b.'' the experience of the party in the preenling season, was dangerous, and f·.ould be :Hfrancecl at ra,·orahle times only by soundiug in the cutter, the place being too much exposed to admit of workiug with the steam launch. "'llile prosecuting the soun1lings, the officers and men were accommodated in houses along the shore of Head Harbor. .After completing the work last mentioned, Lieutenant Hawley commencerl on a third projection which had been made to include the waters between Isle au Haut and Deer Isle. This work was vigorously prosecuted in sections by two parties detailed from the Earnest, the anchoragP of wl1ich was not changed until the 7th of August., when tlw Ye!'sel was mo,·ed to Green'8 Landing. Dense fogs were frequent in August, aml the work during that month was mueh delayed. The southem half of the bydrographic sheet was however filled with soundings when it became necessary to recall the schooner in order to make read~· for her transfer to the I_>acific coast under preYious arrange· men ts. Deer Isle Thoroughfare and the adjacent waters were smmded by the 11th of September, when the work was closed. The party then proceeded to Belfast, and, after laying up the steam launch, sailed for Baltimore, at which port the schooner was refitted for her Yoyage to Sau Francisco. Lieutenant Hawley transferred the command of the Earnest to Sailing )faster P. G. Let-0urnau, and himself took charge of the schooner Silliman for the prosecution of work which will be rnentione(l under the hood of Section YI in this report. Ile was assisted on the coast of Maine h;r :Jfasters G. C. Hanus and A. H. Cobb, U. S. N., and by Ensign A. )fertz, U. S. N.

Tidal obser·vations.-The series of tidal and meteorological observations commenced at North Haven, in Penobscot Bay, in January, 1870, has been stea<lily maintained during the last fiscal year by Mr. J. G. Spaulding. The self-regh~teriug gauge is fornh;hNl with heating apparatus. Every precaution bas been taken to avoid breaks, and so far as the record extends, this series is one of the most perfect among the tidal records. OecasionallJ, when of necessity the apparatus is

14

stopped for deaning or repairs, the continuity of the record is secured by frequent staff readings, as at other stations. Since the year 18 i3 a good self-registering tide gauge has been used at Providence, R. I., by the city engineer in making local improvements. The records, up to the close of the year 1876, have been received at the Office, and in the preliminary discussion there is promise -Of good results. Excepting for the record paper and blank forms furnished to the observer at Providence, from time to time, the series of observations at that port is maintained without cost to the government. In due time the records \Yill pro\'e valuable for investigating the tides of Narragansett Bay. Tria11guluti11n in X1m· Hamp11hire.-On the 13th of May Prof. E. T. Quimby again took the field, and occupied the rernaiuder of that month in resetting the signals needful for the measurement of horizontal angles from the summit of Gunstock ~fountain. Early in June the theodolite was in adjustment at that station, and as soon as practicable the mea.~urernent of horizontal angles was completed b,r obser,'ing on signals at stations Cardigan, Bean Hill, Prospect, "Whiteface, Tra.sk, Catammmt, and 1-Gattlesnake. Sear the middle of the month the instruments were transferred to Gilford, and from that snmmit most of the signal!'! abo\'C mentioned were also observed on, previous to the :!0th of June, at which date field operations were closed for the month. ProfeHsor Quimby will again take up the triangulation in July, and prosecute work as heretofore during the summer. Purther mention of the progress made by his party will be made in my next annual report. Trfon!Julation of Boston Upper Ha.rbor.-The legislature of Massachusetts having provided for a resurvey, the board of Larhor commissioners of Boston made request for the detail of a Coast Survey obseITer to make the requisite triangulation for establishing points. Assistant I~rancis Blake, jr. 7 was assigned for the service, and t-0ok the field in Septem Iler, 1877. In tl1e coast triangulation of a form~r year, one of the stations occupied was in South Boston. :Mr. Blake found the ground marks of that station, and established a second point on Powderhorn Hill, by observing with the theodolite from two of the early stations in the vicinity of Waltham. After couuectiug the line from ::South Boston to Powdcrhorn with the general coast triangulati~11, other stations were chosen fo1· the special surve.r, and were occupied in succession. Forty-one points in all were determined i11 position for the topographical work contemplated by the board of harbor counuissionert'I. Eight other positions beyond the city limits were established and marked with granite posts. "From these 1>0ints future changes in the harbor lines can be readily traced for com1Jarison with the results of the local survey _of this year. At several of the stations occupied, Mr. Blake observed the direction of subsidiary objects, for the use of the city engineers. The result;; of the work done by the triangulation party were checked by a base line measured by Mr. Edward S. Pilbrock, engineer in charge of the filling of part of South Bost-On Flati!. Assistant Blake's determination of the length of the line, by computing through the triangulation, agrees within less than half an inch with the measurement of the engineer.

Blake, under a necessity which then arose for close personal attention to private affairs, to my great regret resigned his place in the survey. He had rendered able and ver_y acceptable service during a period of twelve years. Ligltt-houses <letermine1l in position.-With the requisite instruments, Assistant G. A. Fairfield reached Prm·incetown, Mass., on the 20th of August, 1877, and made arrangements for determining in position all the light-houses between Wellfleet and }farblehead. The adjacent stations of the primary triangulation were visited and identified, and for the five lights on Cape Cod Peninsula, angular measurements were subsequently made from Mill Hill, Scargo, Shootfiying, and Manomet Hill.

At Plymouth, after determining in position the light-house, Mr. Fairtield measured horizontal angles for marking on charts the Standish Monument and the monument in tlle town, both of wllich serve as leading marks in approaching the harbor. Passing on to the .-icinit~· of Cohasset, three stations were occupied with the theodolite for ascertaiuing the exact relati\e position of the lighthouse on Minot's Ledge. The ma1·ks at the station "J1Ta.ntllsket" which ha!l been occupied in the survey of Boston Harbor, having been displaced, were renewed b~- Assistant Fairtield. Adjacent to the six lights in the neighborhood of l\farblchcad three station points \Yere identified, and were occupied for the measurement of horizontal angles b~· mean8 of which five of the aids to navigation were determined.

SEA CURRENTS.

The general scope of the work intended off the coast of New England, and for which provision had been made in the construction of the schooner Drift, was mentioned in my last annual report. The work had then been commenced, and was in lll'Ogress at the cud of the fiscal year. Master Robert Platt, U. S. N., successfully recorded current observations at one station in June, 1877, the depth being sixt.y fathoms at his anchorage. The second position chosen for the vessel was in thirty-fi\'fl fathoms to the southward and westward of George's Shoal and Cultivator Shoal. Good observations were rccorclrnl, tllongh the weather was bad, with high winds and sea and frequent fogs. .At this station the flood-tide swell was particularly noticed, making up at each flood tide and running down on the ebb. X ortheast of the station last mentioned, Master Platt found a spot on wllich the soundi1Jgs gaYe onl.r eight fathoms. The shoal spot was indicated by discolored water. Between George's Shoal and Cultivator Shoal the Drift was brought to anchor in sixteen fathoms, and cmrent observations were recorded. Tl1e tidal swell was perceptible at this station, and at the 8trength of the flood and ebb tide the schooner was surrounded with strong and well-marked tide rips. 'l'hese rips disappeared on the turning of the tide. · · The fourth current station was occupied about fifteen miles to the eastward of George's- Shoal. In good weather the schooner was anchored in thirty-two fathoms. arnl au excellent scrim; of observations was recorded. While at this station a brig was noticed to be trying to work to the northward, but remained in sight during thirty-six hours, ha"\'i11g m,fortnnately tacked again and again to be set ha.ck by the action of the tidal current. The direction and forcp, of the current being knowl) on board the Drift, by the observations then in progress, the schooner was moYed without delay a distance of twenty-four miles to this station, although the wind was direct!~· ahead. Near the northeast edge of George's Bank current observations were recorded successfullJ', and also at a sixth station ten miles south of Brown Bank. The Drift was anchored in one lmudred and thirty-five fathoms, and the movement of the water at the smfacp, and as low down as seventy-five fathoms was noted, but after working sixteen hours with success the vessel was driven off by bad weather. Very heavy tide=rips were crosse<l in standing to the westward, and gales were frequent in the latter part of July. After needful repairs at Boston the Drift resumed work, and occupie(l a station iu sixt,y-five fathoms off Cape Sable. The operations there gave good results, and the weather was favorable. The last position in which the vessel anchored was on the north side of Browu Bank in fift.y-two fathoms.

A dense fog prevailed while the observations were in progress, and but little wind until the record was almost complete, when the work was dosed hy a 8ml<len 8outheast gale, in which l.Jy the parting of her hawser the anchor of the Drift was lost. In returninJ toward Boston, breakers were freq111·11tl,\· noticed wliere the depth was found to he upwanls of 011e lrnrnlred fathoms. Thelle proved to be very heavy tide rips, and so prevail where they wen· observed as to warrant their im;ertion on charts of the approaches to Massachusetts Ba:v. Some of the rip8 are twenty ancl otllers as m,1cll as forty mile::; long and at least. ten miles wicle. Sometimes they resem.ble ;;hoal water, or breakers ahead, and tlte report of l\Iaster Platt states that stra11gers coming Oll them without notiee at night. wo11l1l hH grnatl.r perplexed. His own experience is thus expressed: ''\Ve drifted along with the current, where t.he depth was one hundred and sen~11teen fathoms, until we came into these breakers, and found only a very hcaYy tide rip; the sea so high arnl combing that we bad to reduce all sail; three reef the mainsail and haul tlie boom well off to keep from rolling our mast out.'' At intervals across the entrance of Mas8aclm8e1:ts Bay five cnrreut stations were occupied between Uape Ann and Cape Cod, and three other:,; to the eastward and along the south coast of Cape Cod. In six positions while the schooner was at anchor the force and direction of the currents were determined for a depth of thirty fathoms; at fifteen stations the obsen·ations were made for a depth of ten fathoms, and at nine statiolls the surface currents were deterrniued. Temperature obserYatiom; were recorded at the same time, aml the dernsity of the water was tested by about U.ree lrn11dred ohserYations.

Surve.IJ of Rockaway Inlet and vicinity, N. r.-A resurvey being det5irable to determine the nature and extent of changes in shore line at Uockaway Beach, ou the south shore of Long hlaud, Assistant J. W. Donn was clet.ailed for senice and took the field early in July, 1877. Along the beach all the triangulation points used for the early survey hau been washed awa)'. From points to the eastward of the inlet, determined in 1875, triangulation was therefore extended lJy Mr. Donn to include tile western side of Jamaica Ba~· and the ground between the bay aud Couey Island. As soon as practicable the shore lines were traced by meaus of the plaue taule. A;;sistant Donn, after comparing his results with the outline shown by the earlier sm·n·~-, tllns reniarks in l1is report from the field: "In the bay marshes only slight changes were obserYable, but 011 Rockaway Beach and at the south cud of Barren Isla,nd and the entrance of Dead Hon;e lnlet there was only a slight resemblance to the outlines shown by the original work. Great changes are noticeable after every hea,·y easterly storm. The extension of Itockaway Beach to the westward is at present rapid and unceasing. A reconnaissance of tl1e whole bead1 from the inlet to Far Hocka· way showed no encroachment of tile sea that might, by effecting an opening to tile eastward, check the westerly growth. Eastward of Far Rockaway, at the distance of two miles, an inlet has oeen formed, which is rapidly enlarging, aud forms an additional outlet for the waters in the western extremity of Great Soutll Bay. 'fhe whole configuration of the shore iu tile vidnity of Far Rockaway appears greatly changed from that shown by the early 1mrrn.r. \\'est of Hockaway Inlet remarkable changes !lave occurred in tile line of the islands and bays, the alterations extending up to Gravesend Bay.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Surrey of Coney Island, N. Y.-In the field operations of last :mar the triangulation of the south coast of Long Island had been brought as far eastward as Manhattan Beach. One.of the stations was at. tlie east eml of Uonp,y Island, and another was occupied in the village of Gravesend. For continuing work in the present season, Assistant Donn found and reoccupied two of the stations, and from them obserYed with the theodolite on a number of cupolas along the line of Coney Island. Three additioual stations were occupied, including Fort Tompkins, and from the angular measurements points were provided for the plane-table survey. The fopography was commenced on the 1st of :May of the present year. Interruptions were frequent by wind, rain; and fog. Each feature, natural or artificial, is shown in its proper position on the plane-table sheet of Mr. Donn, and for this part of the coast of Long Island the sheet is an excellent standard for comparison with future surn'ys. Of the changes now going on in the vicinity, he remarks: "Sheepshead Bay and the creek connecting it with Gravesend Ray are rapidly filling up, and it is altogether prolmble that Coney Island will be an island only in name at no distant day." :Field work in the vicinity of Coney Island was completed early in ,Tune.

During the summer, ~.\.ssistant Donn was engaged in Jamaica Bay in the prosecution of a survey which was commenced in the summer of 1877. Of this work mention will be made in my next report. l'endu/um c.:rperiments.-After careful preparation, Assistant C. S. Peirce arranged tlie pendulum, which be had previously m;ed under other conditions, to swing in vacuo, and during the month of September, 1877, it was swung at various pressures with the heavy end down. For these operations time was defaormined before and after experiments with the pendulum. While abroad as a delegate to the International Geodetic Association, Mr. Peirce·at intervals made comparisons of the length of our pendulum standard with that of the Prussian Geodetical Institute. In November tests were made of certain scales used for the measurement to hundredths of a seconcl of the traces on chronograph sheets, the aim being to measure the chronograph record without estimations. The pendulum was swung in December with the heavy end up, and in the course of the winter Assistant Peirce compared all the micrometers which be l1ad m;ed in previous experiments. Subsequently a11 elahorate series of measures was made for comparing our pendulum meter with a German meter. In April and l\Iay of the present year the pendulum was swung at New York in air of which the tklmperature was about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Among other operations conducted this season were experimtmts for the coefficients of expan·8ion of two meter hars and micrometer tests with reference to the spectrum meter. Additional obsernitions were made to compare the statical and dynamical tlexures of the stand which snpport8 the pe.ndnlnm. 'fhe records of the various experiments mentioned in this abstract are contained in twenty-six volumes. 1'i<l1il ob.~erwtfons.-A.t Governor's Island, in New York Harbor, the series of observations with a self-regi11teri11g tide gauge has been kept up by Mr.. R. T. Bassett. In freezing weather the difficulty of maintaining a continuous record has been met by applying heated water to keep the working parts of the apparatus free from ice. A nineteen-year cycle, including continuous observations during winter, will soon be completed at this station. The record, as heretofore, is frequently resort.eel to by local t1 ngineers for adjusting the levels proper for bridges, wharveR, sewers, clikes, and harbor improvements generally. For comparison with the results at Governor's Island the same observer occasionally records day observations at Hamilton A venue Ferry w barf in Brooklyn. In October, 1875, a well-furnished self-registering tide gauge was establish'ed at Sandy Hook on one of the wharves of the New Jersey Southern Railroad, and was put in charge of Mr. J. W. Banford, who, having charge of the depot and the direction of the laborers employed about the

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUHVEL

19

place, commands all the facilities requisite for keeping the apparatus in good working order. The chief officers of the railroad company also have been very obliging, and by their favor the operations have been succcssfolly mainta,ined. Sometimes the water is quite rough, but good rt>sults have been secured by the selection of a screened position for the title gauge aml by carefully attending to its condition. 'l'he movable part:s of the apparatus wrar rapidly at this station, but it is doubtless the only voint at which, wit.hoot great expense, it would he practicable to reconl the tides in the vicinity of Sandy Hook. 'file registers show that the rise and fall are largely affected by winds, especially when great storms are prevailing at sea off the coast of Sew ,Jersey and Long Island. Topogrnplty of Burlson R·irer, N. Y.-The party of Assistant H. L. -Whiting wal' organized on the 13th of July and was at work in the field until the 21st of Xon·mber, 1877. In that interyal the detailed sur\·ey of the easteru side of Hudson River was adYaneed from Crot011 Landing upwards to Peekskill. '£he resulting map represents about nine miles 11f the rh-er 8ille as measured by·its general course, with the usual margin of characteristic-topography, the nmuerons intersecting roads, aml the surface features of the ground above and below Verplanck's Point. Between the limits of the work of this seasou the scenery on the west side of the riYer is among the most striking that the topographer is called upon to delineate. Above the somewhat ahnipt tt>rminations of the highlands the rh-er yaJlp,y again assumes the softer features which are i;een about New· burg and Fishkill. Mr. ·w. C.

In the latter part of the fisc~l year the survey of the banks of the river was re8umed by this party. Hudson River levels.-The de8truction of the initial bench-mark established near Albauy,.in 1858, in connection with a line of levels for referring the tide planes of the river at Albany to those of New York Harbor, made it necessary to refer the Albany station to a bench-mark below, the identity of which was not in doubt. This involved the necessity of running a line of levels from the miter sill of canal lock No. 1, at Albany, down the river t-0 a bench-mark establi,.,hed in 1858 at Stuyvesant. The distance is about twenty miles. The le\'eling was intrusted to Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, who began operations on the 15th of December, 1877·, with instruments of greater nicety of construction than have been usually ernplo~-ed for such purposes. Subassistant Andrew Braid and Mr. J.B. Baylor assistd iu the work. To insure accuracy, two lines were run, and both were closetl on the bench-mark at Stuyvesant Oil the 23d of December. In the work here noticed, Lieut. J. H. Willard, U. S. Corps of Engineers, eft'ectfrely co-operated · with and assisted the party of Assistant Tittmann. Primary triangulation.-For connecting the triangulation of the rnlley of the Ilndson with the primary work of the coast, two additional sta.tion8 have been occuvied by .As1-dstant Hiebanl D. Cutts. Early in June, 1877, the instruments which had boon used in the pr{'{)eding season were transferred from South Adams, and were set np on the summit of l\Iount Tom, in l\1assaehusetts. Heliotropes were at the same time stationed on Grey lock Mountain, and on l\lount Monaduock. By the 5th of July the angular measurements needful at Mount Tom were completed, and as soon as practicable the party and instruments were ill readiness for observing from the summit of l\fount Equinox, in Vermont. That station is thirty-eight hundred and forty-three feet ahorn mean tide. In consequence of the decreased temperature, resulting from its height an<l latitude, the summit, when occupied, was enveloped in fog for nearly half the number of day11 when the air was clear a thousand feet below the summit. Assistant Cutts, however, succeeded in observing Oil the heliotropes which he had previously stationed on five outlying primar~· stations. Operations

on Mount Equinox were completed by the 5th of September. The camp equipage was then stored at Factory Point. Accompanied by Mr. C. H. Sinclair as aid, Assistant Cutts next visited Mount "''asltiugton, to ascertain what point on that summit had heen used as a sigual while angular measire11u·.nts were in progress in the triangulation of Kew Hampsllire. As the smnmit had not been occupied with tlw theo<lolite by any observer of the Coast Survey, the question at issue was to 1etermiue whether the point observed on in 1851 and 1853, from distant stations to the eastward, was identical with the signal used in the operations of 1876. After careful examination and due measurements with the theodolite, Assistant Cutts found that the object observed on in the lastmeutioned year was the northeastern chimney of the new hotel, and thitt the signal formerly observed ou, the place of which is marked by a copper bolt, was fifty-four yards west by south from the chimney.

By an aggregate of two hundred observations the vertical heights of eight stations were determined iu the course of the season by angular measurements. Pennsyfra nia and Xew York boundary line.-A joint commission of three members from each of the two States met at Sew York City on the 29th of May, 1877, to make arrangements for correcting and finally marking the boundary line, which, to be exact, should, at all points between the Delaware HiYer and a point near Lake Erie, correspond with the 42d parallel of north latitude. At the conference it was agreed that the line should be traced ont by a party of surveyors in the employ of the joint commission, and that request should be made for the services of a Uoast Survey obsen·er to determine the latitude at each of four points, the extremes lming two hundred and fifty-three milPs apart. Snhassistant Edwin Smith was detailed for tbe work desired, and, as previously arranged, he reported in person to the joint commission on the 10th of July, at Hale's Eddy, which is very near the eastern end of the boundary line. Mr. J.B. Baylor, of the Coast SurnO\y, accompanied Mr. Smith to aid in the observations for latitude, which were to be made only at points specified by the commission. At tlie eastern end the initial monuments set by the surve;yors in 1786 were carefully sought for, but without success. The commissioners therefore went some miles westward, traced back to Hale's Eddy, from known points of the old line, and erected a monument, the geographical position of whiell in latitude and longitude was determined by Subassistant Smith and Mr. Baylor by obsenations continued through ten days and nights. The subsequent computations for tlrn latitude of that mouumeut place it two hundred and seventy-four feet north of the 42d parallel. Similar observations for latitude were made at Firm's station, near Great Bend, about twenty miles wc8t of the eastern end of the line. The results for latitude show that the old boundary there passes three hundred and forty-three feet south of the 42d parallel. At this station the marked stone was found where it had been placed in 178u. l~it'ty mile" farther westward Burt Rtation was occupied near W ~llsburg. Latitude was determined at a position indicated by the commission as on the old boundaryliue, and the point occupied by the instrument was found, by subsequent computation, to be seven hundred and ninety-one feet north of the 42d parallel. The fourth Htatiou (Clark's) is within a mile of the western end of the boundary line. Observatious for latitude were made in the usual way, and from the computations it appeared that the boundary, as traced there in 1786, is only one hundred and forty-nine feet north of the42d parallel. The near agreement between determinations made with the best instruments in the summer and autumn of 187i, and results found in 1786 with instruments less accurate in constrm;ition, is remarkable. The four stations occupied by Subassistant Smith were all well marked by brick piers, capped with stones that may be easily lettered. At each of the piers a meridian line was established. In the interval of two months preceding the loth of September, when the field work was ch>sed, observations had been successfully recorded on twenty-five nights. The records of the four

Geodetic operations in Yew Jcr.~e:y.-At the outset of the fiscal year l'rof. E!llrnnl A. Bowsrr was yet engaged at )fount Rose in the meiMmrement of horizontal anp;les with the tl1emlolite. After completing the record at that station the iustrurnent was trausferrccl to Pickles station, where the measurements were resumed, arnl at interYals continued until the close of the calemhr year. Signals were observed on at }fount Horeli, (~oat Hill, Haycock. :\lont:urn, awl }fount Olin·; and ouservatiom; were at the same time rf'conled for detennining the positions of subsidiary stations. Field work wa.'> di.scontinued during the latter part of the winter, lmt "·as re.~umc1l iu ApriL arnl was prosecuted at interYals until the close of the -fiscal year. The statistics will lw gi\·en iu my next annual report. Much of the work conducted this season by Professor Bowser im·olYed tltl~ erection of ;;ignal-; and their ac~justment, and the posting or heli<~trope;; at stations too distant to admit of the use of ordinar,.1· signal poles. Geodetic survcy.-In previous seasons the scheme for triangulation in Eailtern Penns.dnrnia was brought into connection with stations of the primary work north of Pltihtdclpliia. To the southward and westward of tliat city reconnaissance had been made with a. Yil·w of Joi11i11g also with stations of the primar,y triangulation which crosses the head of ChesapPake Bay, hut for the present season means were not availaule for resuming· field operations until near the close of the :fiscal ;year. Prof. L. M. Haupt, of the University of Pennsylvania, reorganized his part~- early in June. After due anangemeuts a station Wai' seleckd in Chester Cmmt~·, and by the u~m of 11ig·ltt signals directions were obtained for clearing lines of sight to Principio station, near the lieatl of Cl1Psa· peake Bay, aud to Meeting House Hill, a poiut to the westward of \Yilmingtou, iu Delaware. ..At the first· named station a .structure sixty feet high was found reqnh,;ite for the measurement of horizontal angles. That station anJ those adjacent to it will lJe occupied in the eonrse of the s1111mwr. At the close of the fiscal year the party was engaged at a station on tlle south sule of the Lehigh, where the needful angnlar measurements were completed for joining the northern part of the st' heme with the triangulation of New Jerse~-. Latitude and longitude of Harrisburg, I'a.-A.fter completing work which has. been noticed under a preceding head, and before retul'lling to the office, Subassistant Smith stopped at Ilanislmrg, under directions to make observations there for latitude and longitude. Cohm1·l "\Y mrall im111cdiatel~' conferred with the goyernor of PennsylYania and other officials at the State capitol, and a point for observations was select.ell near the Ront.heaRtern gate of the capitol gromuls. Mr. Smitb, aided by Mr. Baylor, commenced obsern1tions for latitude on the 14th of September, and in the course of six nights seYeuty-two entries were macle in the record on sixteen pairs of stars. On ft,-e nights sixty.four observations were made on thirty.three pairs of >;tar" fo1· clm>nometer correction, and on ~ach l1igllt telegraphic signals were exclmnged with the X:n-al Ohserrntory at \Yashington to determine the !lifterence of longitude between that. obst>JTatmy awl the point of observation in Uie capitol grounds. At the same place obRernttiorns were made 011 sep· arate days by Mr. Baylor for magnetic declination and intensity. The point at which observations were made for latitude and longitude was markC>d h.'· a fine sandstone block, and another was set as a meridian mark two hundred mul lift~·-six foet north of the astronomical station. Determinations for geographical position were rpferrt·(l to tlw capitol dome by measuring a base line with steel tape aml tbe requisite allgle;; 1Yith a theodolite. 2\fr.

Tile stations were marked hy sections of iron pipe upward of two feet long :wJ four and a half inches in diameter. After the pipe was firmly set upright the. signal pole was inserted, n,ml on that tlie angular measurements were made. I u the course of the summer the wharf lines of the city will he mapped on a large scale by Assistant R. M. Bache, hi:s stuvey being based 011 points determined by the· triangulation. Further notice of that work will find place iu my next annual report, to whicll it properly belongs. The triltngnlation iucludes points on both sides of' the Delaware at Philadelphia, and also stations on Windmill Island all(l Petty's Island in the river. The physical sun-e,\· needful at Philadelphia was plaeed in the charge of Assistant Henry Mitchell, and under 11is immediate direction the requisite observations were made by Assistant H. L. J\farindin. These were so arranged as to develop particular information in regard t-0 the tides arnl t:urrents of the river, especially for the western channel between Five :Mile Point and the south end of Petty'fl. Island, and until the end of December, 187i, the operations of this party were confined witl1in the limits just named. Six tide-gauges were erected and an aggregate of upwards of four thousand obsen·ations was recorded. Twehe bench-marks were made, and these were rcf'errl:'(l to the tide-stations by levelling. At five stations across the river transversl:' velocit.~· curves were determined, and eight hundred and two obseiTations on the cnnents were recorded. On the same sections one thousand six hundred and twenty soundings were made. In work connected wilh tbe physical survey Assistant Marindin occupied eighteen stations with the the-0dolite and erected as many range marks. For ascertaining the position of current floats six hundred and forts-four angles were rneafl.ure<l and three hundred and thirt,y-nine others for tbe location of' eight measured base lines: which were used in deducing transverse curves of cnITent velocities. l'rom tlie observatli,ins here recapitulated, re:,mlt. tweuty-sen~ll transverse cunes and nine vertical cun·es, illustrating the ,-elocity of the water at and below the surface in the section of the Delaware included in the sunrey. The work was resumed in May last, and was yet in progresi-l at tbe end of tbe fiscal year wben this report was closed. Light-house.~, Dei111.rare Boy.-For determining the exact positions of the light-houses in Delaware Bay, A8sistant ,J. A. Sullh-au reached Uape :May in tlm middle qf' Sf\ptember, 18i7, and soon identitiecl the station "lligbee '' b.r the ground marks which had been placed when that point was occupied in the triangulation of the coast some years ago. The tower at Cape Henlopen having been occupied with the theodolite at tl1e same perio<l, Mr. Sullivan adopted as a base for his work the line which crosses the entrance of the bay. The observations made at "Higbee," Cape Henlopen light-house, and other stations, previous to the end of December, afford data for the positions of the lights at Hereford Inlet, Cape May, Maurice HiYer, Bgg Island, Cross Ledge, Brandywine Shoal, aud :Mispillion Creek. The distance and direction from the old light-house of the new light-house at Cape May were determined. Cape Henlopen beacon-ligltt aud Delaware Breakwater light-house were observed from Cape May and Cape Henlopen. The new stations" \Veek's Landing" aml "Two Mile Beach" were determined in order to check the position of Hereford Inlet light-house as derivetl from obserYations made there and at Cape May. While making this test the opportunity was taken to determine the positiom1

Tidal observations.-By the voluntary service of Mr. W". J. Bodell, wl'lo has other employment at l<'orh·ess Monroe, the series of tidal observations has been continued through the year at that station. The instrument used com hines tbe latest impro,;ements, and the clock is f'uruiHhed with a balance arnl lever escapement, that form liaYiug .been found less liable to derangement from occaHional jarring at the wharf than the pendulum clock which was at first used. The float boxes and other wooden fixtures at this station were rapidly destroyed hy worms, and when copper or zinc was substituted the corrosion was such as to render their use expeni;ive and inconvenient. Duriug the present year tu hes of wrought iron covered with enamel have been on trial at this station. Special obseri~atfons in Chesapeake Bay.-During the months of August, September, and October, 1877, Lieut. Frederick Collins, U. S. N., Assistant Coast. and Geodetic Survey, with the Hchoouer Palinurus, was engaged in a i,ieries of obsen·ations on the deusity of the waters of Chesapeake Bay and its more importaut estuaries. Twenty-six sections were made between the head of the bay and the capes, on wl1ich an aggregate of one hundred and sixty-four stations were occupied. At each station specimeus of the water were obtained at intervals of two fathoms, from the surface dmn1ward to the bottom. Thei:;e were tested with delicate hydrometers for densit,r, and tl1e same specimens were sent to the office for chemical analysis. In all five hundred and sm·ent,y specimens wern thus obtained and tested. This interesting work is the ini.tial step towards the sytematfo examination of the waters of all the estuaries that penetrate the coc~;.;t of the Atlantic within the limits of the Unite.d States. The service of the party in the Palinurus has been of a preliminary nature, as it was nece;.;sary to dcyise apparatus suited for the purpose, and to determine practically the best methods for carrying on the work. The report of Lieutenant Collins (see Appendix No. 14, Coast Snryey Report for 1877) gives full information concerning the apparatus, which was devised by Prof. J. E. Hilgard, fbr obtaining specimens of water, and describes the methods of conducting the experiments. lt hi intended hereafter to connect obserrations of trmperature and currents with determinations of density, so that full data may be at hand for the solution of all questions that may arise when a study of the results is undertaken. The work of the season is satisfactory, as showing that the data desired can be obtained readilJ'·

Dnriug a storm which raged in Chesapeake Bay in September, 187fl, the water at Alexandria ro,;e four ±h·t two i11ches aboye mean high-tide le\'el. This, the greatest rise known at that port, was dne to the accnrnnlatiou of water in the estuary of the Potomac when there was no freshet in the riYer. -J!arrnetic o/Jsercatio11g.-i\t the mag11eUc station on Capitol Hill, 'Vashingt-011, D. C., obsen·a. tions for dt·cliuatiou, dip, and intensity were recon1ed by Assistant CLrirles A. S'chott on the 14th, 1·3th, amt 17th of ,June, 1878. Similar observations haYe been recorded on Capitol Hill in June of each yt>ar siuce 18.)u. Tlw results fonwl this ~'f'ar confirm what ha(l been noticecl in regard to the great annual change in declination at \Yasbington and at places along the Atlantic coast. During the same period the d1ange in the magnetic dip arnl intensity has berm small. Line.y of /erel.-~·uraugcments have heen completed for running with the utmost precision a liue of len>Js from the AtTantic coast westward, t-0 follow as nearly as practicable along the thirtyninth paraJlPl of latitude. Imitruments for the purpose were devised in the office by Assistant Bilganl, and nuder his dirf'lli"ion 1;evPral obseners lia\'e been trained for field work. Of fltese Subassistant l~;lwiu Smith was detailed to IJrosecnte work on the liue here under notice. In the middle of Octolwr, 1871, he starte1! on a reconnaissance from lfagerstown, Md., but tinding the line of the National Hoad not well snited for tlw intended work, ultimately decided that the line should be nm ou tlw tilw-path of tlte Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which for that purpose he examined as far \H'St as Cum lwrlarnl. From a hench·mark at Hagerstown the work was started on the 22d of October towards Williamsport. ~Id., following of necessity the turnpike which runs 1.Jetween those towns. The country passed OH\l' b~· tlw levdling party is hilly, and owing to bad weather the bench-mark at the lastuamcd tow11 1ras 11ot readied until tlie 9th of November, but under more favorable conditions the ·work was ad nweed to Cumberland in the course of tlie next. twelve days. On the 22d of that month th<' )Htrty was tram;ferred to Hancock, but several days of rain followed, and caused the almost imprt>ee(lt>nte<l fre1-1het which ha!:! been mentioned under a preceding head. 'J'he tlestrnction of property was great in the vicinity of Hancock, and the damage to the canal was such ii.s to make it impr;wticahh~ to keep on with the level operations. Mr. Smith, in consequeuce, disbanded his )Jarty, arnl rctumf'd to the office 011 the 1st of December, 1871. The distance run, :ts shown by reeords of tlw part~·, in leYelling in bot11 <lirections was upwards of twenty-Hiree miles. Throughout the spctio11, which is abont uinety miles between Hagerstown and Cumberland, it is Jlroposed to estal1li~h primar;i· h1·11clt-marks at distances averaging six miles. :Five such benches were establisl1ed hy Suhassistant Smith, the first being on the foundation of the court-house iu Hagerstown. 'l'he secoml mark is 011 the aqne(luct of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal over Conococheague Creek; the thir1I, on t.lw ahntmeut of <lam No. 5, in Potomac River; the fourth, on the sixth lock abo>e dam No. 5; and the fifth, on t1ie aqueduct over Licking Creek.

Uoa.~t Pt'.lot.-After the prosecution of bydrographic service, which has been mentioned under the head of Section III, Lieut. Frederick Collins, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with his party in the schooner Palinurus, sailed from Hampton Roads on the 4th of January to resume duty ou the coast of Florida. The vessel passed southward without incident, and after touching at Saint Augustine left that port on the 2d of :March with a westerly breeze. Descriptions were made of the inlets north of Cape Canaveral antl other notes as material for the Atlantic Coast Pilot. After taking views of the vicinity of the cape, the Palinurus stood out on the evening of the 3d in order to pass northwar1l of the Bahamas. The wind was then fresh, but by midnight it increased to a gale. Next moruiug the schooner was in a heavy, confused sea, but being well managed suffered no damage to the hull or spars, although the sea frequently came aboard and drenched everything below. In the course of the day all the sails in succession were split by the force of the gale, but

were repaired on the instant as far as practicable. Lieutenant Collins made for a lee umle1· the reefs of Abaco Island, and there weathered the gale during the niglit. Unfortunately the morning opened with a storm from the northeast. The position of the schooner was dangerous, and to awiicl further risk with damaged sails the course was laid for Nassan, ·where the mainsail, fore.Rail. arnl jih were sent ashore for repairs. On presentation b,y the United States eonsnl, the govcr1ior-general of the Bahamas ·err conliall,y receh'ed IAentenant Uollim;, arnl off'rrr1l all assistarn·r tliat might he needful in refitting tlw sd1ooner.

some needful repair!\ were made to the machinery of the Ycssel. The yessel then steamed along, carrying soundings to her anchorage inside of Cape CafiaYeral Shoals, and the opportunity was taken in passing· to inspe<'t the condition of the signals which had been erected. t:;ome of these had gone d0\n1, and, owing to the growth of piilms uear the cape, many of the sig·11ahi conld not he distinguislH'tl i11 the oftiug. 'l'o overemut· the rlifficulty thns presented, Lieutenant-Cornmandrr Chest~r had a· few signals set up for boat work, and made a1Tm1gement;;; for occupying the lighthouse and an alljacent Rtatiou with the theodolite. Konrnliugs were con11nenced on tlw 6th of May. The steamer ran lines east, northeast, and 011 1l1e oppoRite r·mm;e in the bay, uetween Southeast Shoal arnl the maiuland, the lines being at a11 a\'erage auont a mil(· and a half apart. At the same time a boat party made somH.liugs on tra\'ersl~ lines ornr Sontltea.it i:::ll10al early in the day when practicable, and later along the coast, t!te last com1ecti11g· with the lines of soundings run by the steamer. Iu this way. and by additional lines run at right ang'lcs to the parallel lines first mentioned, the bay was thoroughly sounded. Ou a Hecond projection for developing Ute outer shoals, normals to the coast were run a mile or rather more apart t~1 a ge11eral depth of fifteen fathoms, anrl insiue of tile outer shoals the number of lines was doul>led, aml these were crossed by othms rnn parallel to the coast. Between the light-house and each of the shoals, and between the 8eparate shoals, lines of soundings were run in addition to snch 1LS were recor1letl in the course of the gcueral su1Tey. Each of the shoals was also carefull,\· dewlopPd by radial lines run from a hnoy set prnYiously over the spot on which the least depth was found. But a shoal mentioned as being a mile and a half t,o t.lrn northward of the ''Bull" was not fournl, though it was carefully sought for. ln rngartl to it, Lit'ntenant-Commantltir Chester remarks: ·'As we ran over the plact' wheu water \Yas bre:tking heaYily on the "Hetzel," autl when heaTy rollern were almoRt breaking on tlw ·'Eull·· in three fatlioms, the ('.oncl11sio11 is that the shoal iu <1 nestion doe.'! 11ot exi-;t.'' l n gern'ntl outline thp. slto:1 ls we1v found by the part,y as rrpre1mnt!·tl hy tlw r1·c01ma.isKance of 1850; but the.re i8 now a dangerons slioal uearing about north six miles from the light.

J . .:\I. Ilawley, U.S. X., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with his party, in the schooner Silliman, made arrangements for the 11~·drograpl1ie RurYey of Charlotte Ifarhor. ""ith some ditlicnlty nineteen stations, which hatl been occupied for the triangulation, wern ide11tifie11. .Additional to these, upward of seYent.r signals were erected for the adjustment of sounding;;. The details of construction were entrusted to l\Iaster G. C. Hanns, U.S.:;-;-,, who was attaehed to the party, and credit is due for economy in tbe requisite outlay. By direction of Lieutenant Hawley the signals which serrnd for soundings in one part of the ba.y were remond and used in other l>laces. ln reganl to the station points, l\laster Raum; reports: "The grass and eYen mangrove trees had o\·ergrown nrnny of the triangulation points, but, owing to the general accnrac;r of the topographical sun·cy, the pointR sought were nearly always fouud. Tlte cedar stakes set as marks some years ag·o by the triangulation party were well preserycd, but of the pine stakes set only one remainctl perfect.'' 'Vhilc som1dings were in progress in Charlotte Harbor tidal obsen·ations were rceorded at a station near Hickory Bluff, and al8o at Cape Haze. The super\"ision of the two tide gauges was committed to Master A. 11. Cobb, U. S. N., and by his attention a record of the rise and fall at intervals of only ten minutes was Retmrell for a ealemlar month at one of the stations, and for six weeks at the other. It was notieed, as resulting from high winds, that the water level was raised b,y southerly or sonthwP8tcrly breezes, allll corrm;powlingly deprc8se<l when the wind was from the north. Owing to the uuustml rainfall, the waters of ~l1ell Creek were fonuLl to be sewm foet aboYe the ordinary lernl, and thit1 condition, eonjoinetl with l1igh winds prenileut d11ring the latter part of the winter, made it a matter of some difficulty to determine planes of reference for the two resulting hydrographic sheets. On one of them, the soundings are referred to the gauge at Hickory Bluff; on the other the.rare referred to the gauge at Cape Haze. Bench-marks were established at both localities, and these are described in the titlal record. Soundings were begun on the 6th of Feurnary, anti the l1ydrograpby was advanced daily while the weather permitted. I<'requent winds in Febmary and March made it impracticable to observe the-currents, but later in the season two stations were occupied, one in the channel between Pine Island Shoal aud Cape IJay,e Shoal, anti the other in the channel to the northward of Cape Haze. By the 10th of ::\fay the hydrography of Charlotte Harbor was completed from rease Creek through Boca Grande to the Gulf. Lieutenant Hawley reports that the channel as far in as Hickory Bluff ha8 nowhere less than nine foet at mean low \\·ater. Uetween Hickory Bluff and Pease Creek there are several hard lumps with only ftrn feet of water 011 them. "Tire holdiug ground in some parts of Charlot.tc Harbor is the best which we haye found at an;}· place in Florida; it is either very sticky mutl, or a mixture of mud, sand, and shells. In bad weather, fishing smacks make a harbor just inside of Boca Grande to the sout.hward, but the bottom there is sandy, and the place not as secure as the anchorage between l'ine Island and the shoal to the northward."

Eighty-two signals were erected by the party in the course of the season. At Manatee some indispensable repairs were made, after which the Silliman sailed for New York, but off the coast of Virginia was struck with heavy weather and constrained to put into Hampton Roads. Subsequently the injury to her mast was repaired at Baltimore, and the -vessel proceeded to the coast of Maine for service, which will be mentioned in my next annual report. Master Albert Mertz, U. S. N., has been on duty with this party during the season. Tria.ngumtion of Sarasota Bay, Fla.-This work was taken up by Subassistant Joseph Hergcsheimer on the 9th of March, after the completion of a survey to be mentioned under the next head. As the result of operations, which were closed on the 15th of June, the triangulation proceeding southward from Tampa has been carried through Sarasota Bay, which, for the greater part of its lenirth, is separated from the Gulf of Mexico only by the narrow strip known as Long Key. For defining the shore line, points were determined at intervals on both sides of the bay quite down to the narrow passage which connects with the shallow inland waters leading towards Charlotte Harbor. Much rain fell during the time employed b,y the party, and the measurement of angles was in consequence retarded.

Survey of Crooked River, Fla.-This water passage bmmds the north side of Saint James's Island, which lies at the eastern entrance of Saint George's Sound. Its development was provided for in the operations of a party detailed in December, 1877, to work under the direction of Subassistant Hergesheimer, as already noticed under the preceding head. After making needful arrangements at Apalachicola the party reached Crooked River in the schooner Quick early in January of the present year, and as soon as practicable traced the shore lines of the river from its junction with the Ocklockony quite through to the western mouth of the river which passes into Saint George's Sound. The bar off the western entrance was sounded, and also the water passage throughout its entire course. This work was completed on the 23d of February. The statistics are:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

SECTION VIII.
ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIAKA, A::SCD ARKANSAS.-(SKETCH No. 15.)

H.lfrlrogra:phynf the Gulf of 111exico.-In December, 1877, full preparation was made for the return of the 11y<lrographic 11arty in charge of J,ieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbee, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geode tie Suryey, with the steamer Blake, to complete deep-sea soundings in the Gulf of Mexico . .A.t my request, Prof. Alexander Agassiz consented to accompan;v the party, and to direct in sucb operations as might yield desirable information in regard to the conditions and forms of life that inhabit the Gulf bottom. The steamer left :Xew York with all needful appliances for dredging and sounding, and was at Ha\ana at the close of the year. In the plan of work, the necessity for toncbing at Spanish ports was kept in Yiew; and permission to do so was cordially granted by the Goveruor-GPneral, who directed, also, that facilities should be furnished by the authorities of any port at which the Blake might have occasion to anchor. On the 2d of January the steamer stood off and on, dredgiug and sonrnliug iu the vicinity of the entrance to Havana, and the next two days iu the direction toward Sand Key. Excepting on the coral mud bottom, the dredge-tangles brought up many living forms. While thus engaged near Sand Key, a norther began without any sign ot approach, and bad weather prevailed duriug several days. To avoid its effects Lieutenant Commander Sigsbee took shelter at Key West, but as soon as practicable resumed opemtions with the vessel, and in the middle of January the party was engaged in dredgiug oft' Bahia Honda, on the north coast of Cuba, about sixty miles to the westward of Havana. On the 19th the Blake stood in toward the eutrance of the harbor merely to inquire for a pilot for t.he Colorado Reefs, and theu resumed work in the offing. The port official shortly afterwards visited the Blake, and took the opportunity to state that if the steamer bad occasion to enter, her signal for a pilot would be promptly answered from the fort, and it so fell out that thick weather came on a few hours after. That change, but more especially the wish for information concerning the intended cruising-ground of the steamer to the westward of Bahia Honda, inclined Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee to enter the port at lea8t for the uight, and accordingly the signal was set at five o'clock in the evening for a pilot. A boat sent by the commander of the fort was soon alongside of the Blake, and the man, who profeHsed to be a pilot, was taken on boa.rd. He was closely questioned as to bearings and landmarkR, and both Heuteuant-Commander Sigsbee and Lieutenant Ackley checked his replies as the lllarks came into view. He met all inquiries with confidence, and declared that the ship was going- well. This was very shortly before the leadsman reported only three and a half fathoms of water. \Vhen sharply asked if that was sufficient, the pilot asserted that there was plenty of water, "and mor(I beyond," an<l ha<l scarcely done so when the steamer struck. The vessel had, in fact, through misdirection, been run by the force of her engines up an inclined plane, and was lying helplesR on hard coral rock bottom with only seven feet of water under the bow and. nine feet aRtern, whereas the mean draught of the steamer when afloat was over ten feet. To keep the vessel from being set further on the reef, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee immediately sent out the anchors to Hea,ward and their chains were hove taut, one from the stern and the other from the starboard bow. l\feanR were at the sa111e time taken t-0 discharge the coal overboard at a safe distance from the port side. :Master :McCrea had been sent to the fort and with t.be transportation there furnished readu·d the nearest telegraph station. The consul-general of the United States at Havana, Henry C. Hall, esq., acted promptl~· on the request of Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee for assistance, and dispatched vessels already fit.tell, in hope that the Blake might be at once hauled off, as the steamer would suffpr frorn the effect of auy swell of the sea. Ever.vthing possible was got out and sent on shore b,y flip, Blake's company; aud the engines were backed, but all expedients failed, as did also the attempt to haul the vessel off hy the tow of another steamer. Soon after, on the evening of the 21st, a norther came up; the sea became so rough that all hands on board were in peril. Lieutenant-Uommauder Sigsbee felt constrained to send the crew ashore, retaining on board, besides himself, ouly Lieutenant Ackley, Pas8etl Assistant Bngineer W. S. Moore, two ma.chiuists, a fireman, and fh-e seamen. l'rofessor Agassiz had taken active part iu all the means employed and proposed to share the danger of the situation with the commander, as did also the officers, who requested permission to take the place of the seamen retained on boa.rd.

mander Sigsbee declined to make any change, all the persons selected at first being equally willing As the ship began to pound with the rising sea, the small compauy 011 board busied themselves about the deck and heluw in securing what w-as left, and t,o be in readiness for the w-orst; the joint of the Kingston valve was broken to admit of flooding the ship if necessary. At half past eight o'clock at night the seas were breaking along both sides, and the Yessel pounded so that those on board found it difficult to stand without holding fast. Tlle engine frames raised at m·ery blow, and the stern JlWung one point in shore. All liopes of a farnrable shift. of wind were girnn up, and at this juncture, all on board feeling that the vessel could not hold together for another half hour, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee gave order for hauling the fires and opening the KingRton valve. The vessel filled rapidly, and in a few minutes rested quietly on the bottom. A whaleboat had been kept nnder the lee of the port bow, and after a half hour ;;;pent in seenriug hatelles, it was felt that nothing more could be done for tl1e Yessel at that time, ;;;o the men were sent into tl!e boat and were followed by Mr. Moore, Lieutenant Ackley, and Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee. With little trouble the party reached the shore shortly before ten p. rn. Toward morning the wind and sea went down, and the opportunity was taken to discharge the coal that yet remained on board. The condition of the vessel soon after striking on the reef had been made known ))~· Thomas Elven, seaman, an expert swimmer and diver, who went down and passed along her whole length under both sides. Four days later he made a second examination, and his reports were of great value in directing the exertions that finally restored the steamer to the service. On the morning of the 23d of January the light-house tender Dandelion arrived off Bahia Honda from Key W'est, dispatched by Commander Smith '>V. Xiehols, F. S. N., who, being light· house inspector there, had earnestly co-operated with Consul-General Hall in sending means for the relief of the Dlake. A pilot from the port came and remained 011 board the tender, but as Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee soon follow-ed, his services were accepted b~· Captain Cosgro,·e to pilot in the Dandelion. That vessel was anchored how and stern near by, and the two eug·ineers succeeded in connecting the boilers of the tender with the whistle-pipe of the Blake. Steam was thus applied from the Dandelion t,o work the donkey pump for clearing the grounded vessel of the water which had been admitted for her safety. At four p. m. of the 24th the water was so much reduced as to admit of lighting fires under the port boiler of tlie l)lake. The main engine was started two hours afterward, and by nine p. m. the steamer was free of water, but still remained aground. Soon after·there arrived the tug La Gitana towing a lighter containing sixty-six wine-pipes, which vessels and appliances had been forwarded from Havana by Consul-General Hall, on the application of Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, through telegrams, and by Profossor Agassiz in person. The Spanish tug co-operated w-ith the Dandelion in an attempt to haul off the Blake, but without success, though the vessel was then divested of nearl;y all that eould be moYed. Finally La Gitana was directed to take a hawser from the starboard bow, wl1ile the Dandelion held hanl as before tu the star~oard quarter, and when the Spanish tng made a surge, the lllake responded by swinging rapidly around, until her head was northwest instead of south, as previously, though left hard aground aft for about ten feet forwanl from the stern post. The haw,:mr of the Dandelion was then cast off from the quarter, and made fast to the foremast head of the Blake, and the tender hauled straight ahead to depress the bows of the Blake, which were in deep water, while J,a Gitana surged again with a twelve-inch hawser, but the make still remained fast astern. As the tide was then beginning to fall the bow was held in position by the tug while the tender planted the starboard bow anchor of the Blake, the other being already out in a position right ahead or northwest. Two heavy anchors being thus well set for the final effort, the assisting vessels were released for the night, with the understanding that all the force possible would be applied at high tide, which would not occur until the forenoon of the following day. On the morning c:if the 26th, Thoma,s Eken, seaman, again went under the Blake, and reported that the vessel held only near the stern post. AR the bow was tflen floating in two and a half fathoms, the sixt,y-six empty wine-pipes brought by La Gitana were aITanged on the decks of the Blake, as far forward as possible, in two tiers, and were filled with sea-water, as were also the forward water-tanks. Some additfanal weight at the bow8 of the Blake was ad:ied by reshipping artiell',g which had been previously transferred, and t.he effect of this expedient, as expected, was to relieve the pressure of the stern on the reef. When everything was in readiness to apply fol'OO if necessary, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee and Lieu-

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

tenant Sharrer went over the side, into the dinghy, and sounded around the vessel. They perceived that the starboard chain seemed to slacken, and in a few moments were gladdened hy the certainty that the Blake.was afloat. The windlass was at once manned, the engines started, and the ship commenced swinging to the wind. Although the vessel had been slung with chains, and girdled by her crew, and wine-pipes provided to be used as camels or caissons, no necessity arose to employ them in the way which was at the outset thought requisite. The spirit, intelligence, and energy of the commander and officers of the steamer Blake, and the steady devotion of the cre'i well deserved the success that crowned their efforts. The ship struck at high water, spring tide, when the rise was twenty-nine inches, and when got off the rise was only eleven inches. By immense labor, in which all on board assisted at the outset, the draught of the vessel was speedily lessened by twentyseven inches. ln general reference to the exertions of his associates, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee says: ''During all our troubles Professor Agassiz did everything possible to render assistance, and though disappointed in the break which had occurred in the marine investigations, he made our affairs paramount in his endeavors. "To Lieut.. S. M. Ackley and Passed Assistant Engineer W. S. Moore I am indebted for suggestions of a number of useful expedients, for their unremitting personal labors, and for cheerfully sharing in the risk of remaining on board on the night of the 21st. All belonging to the vessel worked hard, and voluntarily would have remained during that night, if permitted. To the officers I owe expressions of sympathy and confidence. Machinist Peterson, who worked ~ery hard, was the only one on board able to say, from previous observation, how the ship would be likely to behave when filled with water after grounding. His intdligent description confirmed the belief that the measure which I had under consideration tended to the ultimate safety of the Blake. Among the crew there was no word of complaint; all applied themselves manfully, and in consequence of severe labor the double ration served out was all consumed." The report of Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee makes special mention of the interest manifested for the success of the cruise of the Blake, in many courtesies by Commander Smith W. Nichols, U.S. N., light-house inspector at Key West, and by Lieut. Eugene B. Thomas, U.S. N., commanding the naval depot at that port. Commander Nichols dispatched the Dandelion as being best :fitted to render effective a!"sistance. The commander of that vessel, Capt. Philip J. Cosg~ove, reached Bahia Honda at a most opportune moment, and though so sick as to require treatment from the surgeon of the Blake, the energetic direction of the Dandelion at once proved to be a gratifying relief. To this zealous and capable offi(',er my thanks have been expressed, as also to others whose activity tended to further the movements needful for the relief of the stranded vessel. As soon as practicable, after being floated at Bahia Honda, the steamer Blake proceeded to Havana, and in the course of' a few days was repaired at that port. Early on the 12th of February Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee started from Key West with fine weather to resume work. ·when clear of the reef a course was shaped to the westward of the Tortngas, and in tl1at vicinity a few casts were made with the dredge, but nothing of note came up from moderate depths. The bottom was generally soft gray mud. At eight hundred and sixtythree fathoms the dredge came up. full of mud, and attached to the tangles brought also one starfish. This was at a position sixty miles west of Tortugas. Bad weather followed for some hours, but on the 15th the trawl was worked at depths of nine hundred and fifty-five and eleven hundred fathoms in soft yellow mud. Of eight kinds of deep-sea fishes brought up, some were blind, and others remarkable in structure. A large variety Or rare living forms was there obtained, besides five kinds of sponges, and coral branches of great delicacy. Further westward another haul in nineteen hundred and twenty fathoms wa.s made with equal success. Very large carnation-colored shrimps, and a blind but well-shaped fish, a foot in length, were among the numerous specimens held by the trawl. Passing on southward and westward the trawl was again got overboard in fifteen hundred fathoms on the slope of the Bank of Campechc, where the bottom is generally soft coral mud, but in reeling in, it was found ·that the trawl had fouled on something at the bottom, and could not be cleared. This loss left only one trawl on board. The steamer passed cm westward, sounding along the north side of the bank. As the dredge brought up few specimens, a modification was

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

37

made with a ,;ew of retaining less of the mud, which seemed to be scooped up from the bottom and held to the exclusion of any specimens that might be near the spot where the apparatus was dropped. Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee and }faster H. M. Jacoby, U.S. N., soon complPted the changes deemed requisite for success, and the first trial of the new dredge brought up neither mud nor sand, but many specimens of value; among others, five entirely new sea-urchins, eacl1 closely resembling, in form, color, and size, the half of a large fresh lemon. North of the bank, and in fifteen hundred and sixty-eight fathoms, the trawl was kept an hour on the bottom and came up with specimens among which was an exceedingly rare kind of stemmed polyp. Along the west side of the bank the dredge was cast at intervals, and generally with success. Passing southward to Alacran Reef on the 18th of February, the Blake was anchored in six fathoms on the northwest edge of the reef, and 1~rofessor Agassiz examined tlie shoal water about the reef; after which the vessel got under way, passed along the west and south sides of t_he Alacran, and steamed for the edge. of the Yucatan Bank, near the northeast point of the Yucatan Peninsula. The intention of Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, by the advice of Professor Agassiz, was to run a line from the one-hundred-fathom currn at that place toward Cape San Autonio; hut during the night of the 19th of February a southeast gale made it necessary to defer the purpose. When the weather cleared, the Blake was put on her course, and the trawl was used in fifteen and twenty fathoms, bringing up the profusion lJsually fonnd near 8hore. Keeping on, under t:;asy steam, in the direction towards Cape San Antonio, rough weather was again met, and the Blake put back and took shelter under the lee of a shore that makeR out northward of ,Jolhos Island, where the vessel was detained until noon of the 22d of .February. 'Ihe steamer again started enstward, although the weather was yet unsettled, but dredging was impracticable, and no 8top wa8 made short of the Colorado Reefs, in tl1e vici11it,y of Cape San Antonio. Soundings Wf're recorded in the vicinity of the Reefs, and the dredge was about to be started when a squall came on. Standing again back towards the reefs, the Blake approached to within a mile and a half, and found three hundred and forty-six fathoms. Of the appearance of the reefs, Lieutenant Commander Sigsbee says: "A more dangerous-looking locality I ha,·e never seen. 'l'he white water was wholly within the breakers, the latter lieiug in blue water. No land was in sight." Preparation was made on board the Blake for casting the dredge near the Colorado Reefs, but at the instant of backing into the sea one of the radder chains broke adrift and got foul of the propeller. The sails were quickly adjusted, but the vessel did not an8wer, nor could the chain be relieved by a boat's crew sent astern. Lieutenant Commander Sigsbee went over the stern in a bow line, and seeing that. the chain cAmld be got away only h.Y breaking, g:trn onler for t~miing the engine at full speed. As a result the chain snapped from the rudder, but probably remaining in the propeller it was not deemed expedient to stay longer at the re!Jf. Standing broad off into deep water a cast was made in twelve hundred and twenty-two fathoms. 'l'he course was then changed to northward and eastward, and the trawl was used and brought up specimens from a depth of thirteen hundred and twenty-three fathoms. :Further on in the directiou toward Key West a very successful haul was made in eight hundred and sixty fathom8. Two other equally fortunate dredgings were made at positions south of the Tortagas. Some of the forms secured in these were entirely new. The steamer reached Key West on the 25th of February in time to escape very heavy weather that prevailed during several days. On the 1st of ::\larch the vessel again started, and stopped off the Marquesas for examinations deemed desirable by Professor Agassiz. The coral there was found to be dead. Continuing westward inside of the reef a l1ea''.Y sea was met, and in consequence Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee went into Tortugas Harbor. Next day successful hauls were made with a dredge which had be-0n constructed on board, bat the sea remained heavy. After a cast in fifteen hundred fathoms the course was laid for the Mississippi Delta, off which the dredge was used in three hundred and twenty-mie and flye hundred and thirty-three fathoms, and finally at the one-hundred-fathom curve opposite to the entrance of South Pass. Near the eastern outset of this line the Blake encountered a tremendous sea, in which the seaworthiness of the vessel after her pounding on the reef near Bahia Honda was fully proved. The sea continuing heavy during the entire run, and also off the mouths of the Mississippi, the Blake was passed between the jetties and anchored at New Orleans on tl1e 9th of March. From that. port Professor Agassiz pruceeded directly to Boston. Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbe,e took in a supply of ooa.l and refitted the vessel.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The only continuously good weather during the season in the Gulf happened while the steamer Blake was fast on the reef off Bahia Honda. This fortunately availed for the safety of the vei;;sel, but the results of tLe work, done for the most part duri:Ug rough weather, are nevertheless satisfactor.'-· Soundings and bottom temperatures were carefully recorded in connection with the dredging operations. The Blake left the Delta on the 24th of March, and in the cour.se of two days was in one hundrt1d fathoms on thi; Florida Bank. Hauls were made with t,be dredge in cruising towards water of leRs depth, a111l after touching at Key West at positions off t.he coast of Cuba in the vicinity of IlaYana. :Much bad weather was experienced in April, but the latter part of that month was spent in tl1e eudeavor to repair a defect in the submarine cable between Havana and Key West. This service was undertaken at the request of the late president, Hon. William Orton, of the 'Yestern 1Jnio11 Telegraph Company, to which, from its organizati9n, the survey has been contin· uously nuder obligations for many facilities that favored progress in the work. By the· party in the Blake tLe cable was at first nnderrun from the south beach at Key -west, and was buoyed at the edge of the reef. 'Vhen the weather sen'ed a further attempt was made to underrun to the yiciuity of the defect, which was judged to be about twenty-seven miles from Sand Key, but the cable wat-1 found to be so slack that the appliances on board the steamer became ineffoctive. The agent of the International Ocean 'l'elegraph Company directed and witnessed all the operations, and at last decided that further efforts were useless in the absence of special means for the service desired. Having rentte<l at Key West the Blake again left that port on the 2d of May, and started in sixteen fathoms a line of soundings just outside of Sand Key Light· House, and with good weather extended work towards the Yucatan Bank, but the wind and sea next day constrained a return to Tortngas after a run of seventy miles. On the way the Blake .was struck by a sea which broke seven dead-light panes in the starboard main-deck ports, though the glass was a quarter of an inch thick. The storm prevailed during sernra1 days, but on the 8th the vessel was got under way for Key ·west, seYeral of the company being ill. A few days after, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee was again off the Tortugas with the intention of sounding quitP across to the coast of Cuba. 'l'his line was cloRed a sllort distance east of the entrance to Mariel, where a tlepth of three hundred and eighty-one fathoms was recorded quite cloRe inshore. As the weather was unsettled the Blake laid off uear thP entrance to Havana on the night of the 12tl1, and then st;fJaming westward started a line off Tiahia, and carried soundiugs northward and westward to a point about forty miles west of the .Tortugas, where a depth of one hundred and fifty-six fathoms was recorded. The interval of calm that favored work on this line closed, but the vessel was moved to a position a.bout thirty miles further west, and tl1ere fmmd seventeen hundred and fifty-three fathoms. From t}lat station soundings were run to the coast of Cuba in a direction generally parallel to the line last mentioned aucl at nearly equal distances four other lines, the last starting near Cape San Antonio were run radiating from the coast of Cuba. These developed an eastern prolongation or spur of the Yucatan Bank, and that development was further verified by a line of soundings which crossed the radial lines. This final line of soundings was run northward and eastward and on the course towards Kej· 'Vest, where the Blake arrived on the 2Gth of May. At proper intervalR on all the lines of soundings, serial temperature stations were made, at each of which tLe temperature of the water was recorded at the surface and at va~ying depth to the bottom of the Gulf. Full series were registere1l at fif'ty-niue stations, the records of which will bear directly in the investigation of the currents that pass between Cuba and Yucatan. Of the · t,en lines of soundings here mentioned the greatest depth f0tmd was two thousand and sixty-four fathoms at a station about midway between Yucatan Bank and the Tortuga.a. At the place in which each of the soundings was recorded the density of the Gulf water was test.ed. On the passage of the Rteamer Blake northward Lieutenant-Commander Sigsboo stopped o:tl' Cape Florida, and ran a line of soundings with numerous temperature observations quite across the Gulf stream, -terminating the line at Gun Key. The depths found are greater than those heretofore reported for that vicinity. Passing on northward from Gun Key the vessel reached New York on t~e 5th of June.

Triangulation of Barataria Bay, La.-This work was essentially complete at the close of the preceding season. The shore line had also been traced for the use of tlte hyurographic partJ·. It remained merely to extend from the head of the ba;y a short triangulation so as to connect with stations used in the survey of the Mississippi Rirnr. For this purpose Assistant "'· II. Dennis resumed operations on the 10th of Dcember, 1877, witlt a party in the steamer Barataria. A reconnaissance was made and signals were erect-0d for a set of quadrilaterals north of the work of last year. At Woodland a tripod sixty feet high was required in order to obtain a line of sights a.hove the buildings by which the station was surrounded. Between the bay and the rh'er, at the points of nearest approach, a ridge intervenes covered b.)· a growth of liYe oak, through which four aYenues, averaging nearly half a mile in length, were cleared by cutting to admit of observing with the \he-0dolite. While l\fr. Dennis was engaged in measuring angles for connecting his work with the rirnr survey, the shore lines of the upper branches of Barataria Bay were mapped hy l\Ir. F. C. Donn, the aid in the party. The statistics of the supplementary work of this season are:

This work was completed early in April. Under another head mention will be made of the subsequent operations of the party under the direction of Assistant Dennis. Hydrography of Barataria Bay, La.-'l'hc part.y assigned for this work commenced operations on the 24th of January, 1878, under the charge of Lieut. ,~-.I. Moore, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the schooner Ready. After esta.blishing a tide gange, tl1e souudiugs were prosecuted at all favorable intervals inside of the bay, and when weather permitted in the approaches. The resulting sheets take in the Gulf hydrography for about four mile;;; east and a;;; far west of the entrance, and to a distance of rather more than three miles to seaward. Inside, the bay was sounded to a limit about six miles from the Gulf shore. During March and April the work was delayed by prevalent fogs. These were constant except for about one hour near midday. The following remarks are taken from the report of Lieutmiaut Moore: "On approaching the entrance to Ilarataria Bay the water shoals gradually from seYen fathoms (at three miles from the light-house) to !'!even feet on the crest of the bar. Inside the bar the water deepens to seven fathoms when abreast of Fort Livingston. "Inside the entrance no noticeable changes have taken place within the last twenty-five years. Thirteen feet may be carried until near the "Quartelles,'' with shell heaps on either side. A.hon· this the bottom seems to be flat, with six and a half feet of water np to the entrance of the bayous, which are invariably guarded by bars having from two to five feet of water on them. "There is good anchorage in th1·ee fathoms, Barataria light bearing south-soutlleast, bottom blaek mud." As might be expected the tides were found to be much affected b.Y the direction of the wind. It was noticed also as a peculiarity that the tide would begin to rise at the entrauce while the current was running out, and fall while the current was setting in.

Lieutenant Moore was assisted in this work by Lieuts. W. F. Low and Sidney H. May, U.S. N. Soundings were continued in Barataria Bay until the 1st of June. Tirfol observation.~.-Tbe record made by means of a staff-gauge by Mr. G. Faust, at New Orleans, during regular intervals of six hours has heen continued. The daily or tidal fluctuation in the Mississippi is very small, but the annual changes, amounting to eleven or twelve feet, produced by floods, are of much interest. The observations are kept up as heretofore, because these large changes show a tendency towards recurrence at regular periods, and hence the accumulated records ma;y be expected to yield a fair appro.ximation in advance in regard to the state of the river throughout the year. Base lines near 1lfississippi Rirer.-Full provision was made for the advance of the triangulation parties on the Mississippi l~iver, by the assignment, early in April, of Assistant H. G. Ogden, for the measurement of base lines at Donaldsonville, at Natchez, and at Vicksburg. At Donalusonville the line was located about a mile and a half below the city, and is thirty· three hundred and thirty meters in length. The measurement was made over a plantation road, and len~ls were m n 1,o reduce the mean height of the base to the top of the levee or railroad. The azimuth was obserYed for the base line by fifty-six measures, resulting from nine sets of observations in five l)Ositions of the instrument near elongation on four nights. For use in the triangulation approximate computations of the base length and azimuth were furnished to Assistant Perkins, who was then conducting the triangulation above Donaldsonville. Opposite to Natchez a base line was laid out and measured of twenty-nine hundred and seventy meters along th Concordia road at Vidalia. Azimuth was measured at an adjacent point of the triangulation. The angle between a mark set about two miles to the northward and the line leading from'' Lookout" to "Giles" was ascertained by sixty measures, which resulted from ten sets of observations with the instrument in five i)Ositions. Four nights were employed for determining the azirnn t11. Under circumstances which constrained Assistant Ogden to leave the field early in June, the charge of the party was devolved on Mr. C. H. Sinclair, who had efficiently aided in the operations at Donaldsonville and Natchez. Mr. ·w. B. French was attached to the party at the opening of the season, aud remained in the field until the close of operations. The base line measured by Mr. Sinclair was laid out by Assistant Hosmer, and properly connected with points of his triangulation of the Mississippi River, in the vicinity of Vicksburg. For more than half its length the line passes through the principal street of the town of Delta, La., the remaimler of the line ranging through adjacent cotton fields. The length, as found by Mr. Sin· clair's measurement, is 2715.3 meters. Inclement weather delayed the .completion of the measurement until the 29th of June. The azimuth of a line of the triangulation, leading from a station in Vicksburg across to a station on the island opposite to the town, was determined by twenty-one sets of observations in five positions of the theodolite. Four nights were occupied in that work. The latitude of the azimuth station wat1 determined by Subassistant Smith, of whose work mention will be made under another head. After his return to the office and completion of the computations, Mr. Sinclair was assigned to field duty in Section II. Tria,ngulation of the Jllissi~sippi Rilier near Donaldsonvilw, La.-As stated under a preceding head, Assistant F. W. Perkins remained until the middle of April at work in Section VI. After transferring his Jlarty to the charge of Subassistant Vinal, for continuing the survey of the Saint John's 1-tiver, Fla., ~Ir. Perkins started for New Orleans, and reached that portonthe27thof April, 1878. The schooner Research was at once fitteU out for ext:ending the survey of the Mssif!sippi abo\'e Donaldsonville, to which point the triangulation had been carried in previous seasons. .As already mentioned under another head, a base-line was laid out on the east side of Donaldsonville.

When tue last report wa;; received from the field, th<:>. prospect was good for progress during the summer and autumn. Inspect-ion.-Under special directions Assistant A. F. Jtodgers proceeded from San Francisco early in September, 187i, and visited the sewral parties at work on tile Rhores of Puget Sound, WaRh. Ter. The work of triangulation and topogra.}lb;y in progress between Battery Point arnl Nisqnally Uiver was carefnll;r examiued, as were also the records. Budd's Inlet was Yisited, and others in that vicinity, with a view of deciding: 011 the practicability of extending the triangulation of the sound from its present southern limit across tl.te laud known as the" I'ortaµ.-e/' lietween the waters of the inlet and Hood's Canal. Tbe Nisq1ially wa.s fountl t{1 be n'ry 11ar-rmi-, ,,-ith se,·eral outlets opening upon extensiYe fiats covered with <lrift timber aml tmags. Lea \·ing this quarter, ~Ir. Rodgers next mm·ed to Commencement Ba.v, and examinecl the ground bor<leriug: the terminus of the Northern Pacific Hailroa<l at New Tacoma. 111 the construction of tlie wharf there, piles one burnlred feet in length were used, but, as on tue coast of California, it. was noticed that the teredo is very destructiYe. Piles are eat.en away in limits of time Yarying from six months to as much a8 six years. The railroad company's Iat(~St strncture at Xew· Tacoma re.~ts upon coppered piles. From Seattle l\Jr. RodgerR went nort.h, through Possession Sonmli aucl noted the character of the streams that empt.y int-0 it. The slloreR of J,ake 'Yashingtou were examined, and the course of the Skagit River, which, it is said, waR once. navigable b,y light-thanght steamboat.s upwards ot thirty miles above its moutlt. From the Skagit the recomrnissauce was eontiuned north ward to La Conner on the southern ext.remity of }'idalgo Isla111l, and from t.ltcuce .Mr.1-to<lgers returned t.o Seattle and Tacoma by way of Port Susan and Possession l::iouud. Subsequently lrn met .Assistant J. J. Gilbert, l>y appointment, at Kala.ma, on the Columbia ]{h'er, and examined the details of the plane-table work then in progreRs. Proceeding 11Pxt hy way of Portland, Mr. Rodgers went u11 the river to Dallas City, and duriug the delay incident to the t-ram1for of freight from the upper river walked over the Cascalle Portage 011 his returu. This is a stretch of 1-1ix miles in which the transfer of an euormous yield of grain is greatly interrupted in itK passage to the coast. Early in October Assistant Jtodgers returne.rl to Kahuna alJ(l examined tile riYer shores as far up as Columbia City, at which point he took passage for Portland, and from tllence returned to San Francisco. His field operatious on the coast of California ha \'e been described iu the preceding chapter.

SECTION XII.
ALASKA TERRITORY.

Ooast of .Alaska.-The compilation of material for the Coast Pilot of Alaska has been continued by .Assistant W. H. Dall. Hydrographic notes, and others pertaining to navigation, have been completed for the coast and channels sout.h of' Cape Spencer. The 1neteorologica.1 appendix contains an exhaustive summary of' all observations recorded in Ala.ska, and a general discussion of the weather, cuITents, and periods of navigation pertaining to that region, illustrated by cha-rts of Isothermal and Isobaric lines, profiles, &c. This paper embodies much interesting matter heret.Qfore unpublished. Further progress has been mitdt> by Mr. Dall in collecting the titles of ma.ps, eharts, aud publications descriptive of the hydrogl"'ctpby of that coast. Some twelve hnnllreAJ titles hai·e been collected. Most of the works cited have been examined aud notes taken of su~h of the coutenti-; as bear upon navigation. In addition to matters of general interest, Mr. Dall has in recent years

'Tfdal ol>scrm.fions.-Tbe self-registering tide gauge lent to the Hawaiian Government survey in the summer of 187li for use at the Sandwich Islands, in the Pacific Ocean, reached Honolulu in good order, and as soon as praeticable was set up in that l!arbor by the Superintendent of the Survey, "\V. D. Alexauder, esy_. It is known tllat the apparatus worked well during the past ;year, although at the end of June, 1878, the tidal rolls from the gauge hi11I not reached the Coast Survey Office. They are doubtless on the way to \Vashiugton, and will be expected at t!Je office hefore the close of the year. Data famished by the recmd;:: of the Honolulu station will give ready means for investigating the relations of our "Ve8tern coast tides to tho8e of the open sea in the Pacific Ocean. SECTION XIII.

Geo.11raphical positions.-I<'or the determi1iation of latitude and longitude at several points in the viciuit.y of the ~Iissifisippi IUver, a party was organized early in ,July, 1877, to work under the direction of Assistant G. vV. Dean .. Tlle requisite instruments were sent from the office, and Assi8tant William Eimbeck placed in position at Columbus, Ohio, stich as were intended for use at that station. A secnud set of instruments in charge of the aid, Mr. H. v\T. Blair, was set iu place at Nash,·ille, Tenn. To facilitate in longitude determinations, i'resident Orton, of the ·western Union Telegraph Company, afforded the use of the lines and tlte transmission of messages free of charges as hel'etofore; and by the kindneRs of Colonel Van Horne, general superintendent of the Southern Division, a wire was promptly run from the telegraph office to the astronomical station. All the inl-ltruments were adjusted and ohRen"ations commenced by the 27th of ,July. On the first clear night after that date, clock signals were exchanged between the observers at Columbus and Nashville. In the course of_ the month of August, signals were exchanged also between the same observers and an observer at the United States )fa.val Observatory in Washington City. Early in Se1ltember, Assistant Eimbeck, aided b;\' :Vlr. I·'. H. Parsons, removed the instraments from Columbus and adjusted them at Paducah, K;\'., from which point he exchanged time signals with the Nashville station on three succesKive uightK precediug the middle of the month. The latitude observations at Paducah were completed in the week following; and a few days after, the instruments there in use were transterred and set up at Cairo, rn. Until the 11th of October, the weather was uufavorable for longitude exchanges, but in clear intervals preceding the middle of tliat month the requisite observations were recorded. "Meanwhile, Assistant Dea.n and Mr. Blair, at Nashville, successfully observed several series of star transits for determining their personal equation ; and subsequently several sets of observations were obtained with the Personal Equation apparatus. At tbe same time a second series of longitude signals was satisfactorily exchanged between the Nashville station and the Naval Obsen-atory at Washington. ,lfter completing the records at Cairo, Assistant Eimbeck occupied a station at Hickman, Ky., aml during three nights, closing wit.h the 27th of October, successfully exchanged time signals with the obKCITer"' at XaslH"ille. Uemoving rn>.xt to Memphis, Tenn., signals were well exchanged during five nigl1t.s with the :Nashville station. Mr. Eimheck, aft,er closing work at Memphhi, repaired to .Nash\·ille to obl-lerve for personal equation, but, as in a previous attempt for-the same purpose, continuous bad weather made it inexpedient to wait there for the desired opportunity. Late in November the astronomical instruments and telegraph apparatus were stored in a room of the State House at Nashville. When the weather permitted, the observations needful there for the determination of latitude were made by Mr. Blair. The record at Nashville was com· pleted on the 2d of December. Between that date and the previous July, longitude signals were exchanged with the Naval Observatory on thirteen nights, and between Nashville and Columbus 011 fourteen nights. Cniro, Paducah, and Hickman were determined by signals exchanged between each Jloint and the observer at Nashville on three nights, and in like manner the position of the observing point. at Mem111Iis was nxed by exchanging siguaJs on ftve nights.

Meanwhile, Prof. John L. Campbell, of Wabash College, had been recommended by the governor and by the State geologist, for the charge of the field work, which, as in similar cases, could be carried on only during the college vacation. Late in l\fay, Assistant Richard D. Cutts proceeded to Indianapolis and conferred personally with the State geologist, Prof. E.T. Cox:, and also with Professor Campbell, in regard to the topographical features of the State, with a view of starting triangulation in the locality most favorable for progress. The immediate wants and interests of the geological survey were at the same time kept in "iew. After full discussion it was decided t-0 begin reconnaissance in the hilly country south of Indianapolis, and, if practicable, to select stations for a chain of quadrilaterals extending· t:o the Ohio River . .A. short time before the close of the fiscal year, Professor Campbell was relieved from college duties and at once rook the field. His plan of work will include the selection of a site for a base line between Indianapolis and New Albany. Of the progress in the summer of the present year further mention will be made in my next annual report. Reconnaissance.-The reconnaissance for stations in Southern lliinois was resumed by Assistant G. A. Fairfield on the 10th of May. In the preceding season the even surface of the ground eastward of Saint Louis and the want of means for identifying positions some miles distant, made the selection of stations impracticable. To overcome in some measure the difficulty thus presented, Mr. Fa.irneld procured a few rockets and used them as night signals. By this de>ice, the direction was obtained t:owards a point at which it was desirable to place a signal, and at which, by a structure of moderate height, the adjacent signals might be brought int:o view. A signal was erected at Sugar Loaf station, and arrangements were made for a structure at Parkinson. Night signals were exchanged between those points, and the practicability of the line was established. At Sherman Park a signal was put up, and was seen from Parkinson, the distance being eight miles. The lines for this triangle were traced out in June, after due ttists with the spirit-lernl. Assistant Fairfield, at the date of his last report, was engaged in connecting other stations with those which he had already selected. The work will be continued during the summer, and mention of the results will be made in my next annual report. Geodetic operations in Wiscon..~in.-The progress made in triangulation, after completing the reconnaissance in Wisconsin, was a subject of notice in m.v annual report for 1876. During the year following, means not being availahle, the work was suspended, but was resumed in l\fay of the present year by Prof. J.E. Davies, of the University of Wisconsin, who had the triangulation in charge in the first-mentioned year. In the autumn of that year connection was made by the measurement of horizontal angles between the base line, near Spring Gretm, and the astronomical station at Madison, but the operations of that year closed without means for the measurement of the base, which, of necessity, was deferred until the present year. Late in May last Professor Davies made the needful preparations, and was joined on the 2d of June by Assistant Richard D. Cutts. The measurement was made with the sliding-contaet apparatus, the management of which at the outset wa.<1 directed by General Cutts. When the work was fully under way the measurement was left to Professor Davies, who completed the work in June. The ends of the line were secured for use, at any time hereafter, by structures of solid masonry below the ground surfaee. Upon these, monuments of Joliet limest:one were placed, with the proper inscriptions. The site of the line is unusually level and favorable for rapid work. The record of the measurement shows that the operation was performed with care, and that a close degree of accuracy may be accorded to the results. The course of the triangulation now in progress in Wisconsin will extend to the Mississippi River, between Prairie du Chien and Dubuque. Magnetic observations.-In this section the magnetic elements were determined by Subassistant Andrew Bra.id, at Madison and at La Crosse, in Wisconsin. As the larger number of stations occupied fall into the next section, a summary notice will be made under that head of all the determinations made by the party in the course of the season.

~lfagnetic observations.-It is generally known that the variation of the compass, at positions off the coast, can lie marked on charts with reasonable accuracy, but not as the result of observations recorded at sea. To obtain data of such importance, the magnetic declination must be known not only at fteld points adjacent to our coasts, bnt also for many places in the interior of the continent of ~orth .America. Hence, for whatever purpose observations have been made on land, within the last two centuries, the determinations all become of great account, as items of the large aggregate, needful for accuracy iu marking compasses on the coast charts of the United States. Of late years, calls for information in regard to the variation of the compass have become frequent, suggesting- that determinations, instead of being incidental among other field operations, should be committed to an observer qualified to return results from a number of stations in each season. Subassistant Andrew Braid was assigned to this service, and was carefully trained in the use of instruments by Prof. J. E. Hilgard, the assistant in charge of the office. The distribution of magnetism over the territory of the United States, having been a subject of study for years in the office, Mr. Hilgard was able to indicate readily the point8 which should be occupied first, fo order to gain the utmost with a limited outlay ia time and means. After due practice, under the inspection of .Assistant Rilgard, Mr. Braid took the field and determined the magnetic elements at Nash~ille, Tenn.; Cairo, Ill.; La Crosse, Wis.; Minneapolis, Minn.; Sibley, Des Moines, Davenport, and Keokuk, Iowa; Omaha, Nebr.; Lawrence, Kans.; and at Vinita, in the Indian Ten-itory. The work done at these places consisted, as at Madison, of observations for magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal i11tensity. Not less than three days were spent at each station in recording successive observations, and at some of them operations were kept up during four and five days. For determining the horizontal force, both deflections and oscillations of the magnet were observed, except at J,a Cross~, Sibley, Keokuk, and Vinita, where the record was made only of oscil1ations. This field work was prm;ecuted by Mr. Braid between July and the middle of December. During tbe season the weather was for the most part favorable for magnetic observations, yet on a few <lays tlle instruments were affected by irregular disturbances, or "magnetic storms." Rains were very frequent, but caused interference in the work only by delay in obtaining the astronomical azimuth. At all the stations, care was taken to set up the instruments at some considerable distance from structures of iron, and all the stations were carefully marked . .Arrangements bani boon made for securing similar determinations at another series of stations in the course of the ensuing season, the points as before heing selected so as to add directly to the means for tracing lines along which the variation of the magnetic needle is equal. Sketch No. 24, given in my report of last year, shows the results obtained thus far from repeated discussion of all the observations for magnetic declination that have been found consistent with each other.

CO.AST AND GEODETIC SUHVEY OFFICE. Assistant .J. E. Hilgard continued in charge of the Coaio;t and Geodetic Survey Office until near the close of the year for which this report is submitted. Ile was relieved on June 17, having been commissioned to execute important duties which required the presence of a representative of the Coast Survey in Europe. These were, first, to co-operate as a member with the International Committee on Weights and Measures in perft>,,ct.ing the organization of its establishment near J>aris, and to assist in initiating the practical operations agreed upon ; second, to make at J,ondon a recomparison of the Coast Survey standard yard (bronze No. 11) with the British Imperial standard, in order to establish with certainty a difterence which had been indicated by comparisons with other original standards; and, third, to attend the annual session of the International Geodetic .Association. During Mr. Hilgard's absence, .Assistant Charles A. Schott was directed to take charge of the office.

Assistant Edward Goodfellow continued on duty in the office throughout the year, aiding the assistant in charge in the details of administration and in the correspondence of the office, which is constantly increasing with the growing demand for the information accumulated by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. T.he temporary assignment to dut;y, under office direction, of several field officers gave Mr. Hilgard opportunities of prosecuting, with their aid, some scientific investigations designed to effect improvements in the instruments and in the methods and processes of the survey. Assistant 0. H. Tittmann reported to the office in August, and, after making comparisons of the secondary six-meter base bars with the standard bar No. 1, he designed and had constructed a convenient apparatus for comparing base bars, and executed the comparisons. au account of which will be prepared for future puhlication. He also supervised the construction of th~ new geodesic level, determined its constants, and made tests of the graduation of theodolites No. 88 and No. lli, of seYeral micrometer screws, and of ocean salinometers and ueep-sea thermometers. Earl~· in lJecember Assistant Tittm:um was temporarily detached from the office to make an exact leYelling between the tidal bench-marks at Albany and Stuyvesant, on the Hwlsou; m1 his return~ in ,January, he was occupied "-ith the computations of this work; he then took up the completion and rm·ision of the new Coast Survey Catalogue of Latitude Stars, which is printed as Appendix No. i of the report for 18i6. He had also in charge the designs for an enlarged construction of the level of precision. Early in May Mr. Tittmann was detached from the office and charged with the geodetic triangulation westward from the ea.stern base of the Rocks 1vionntains. Mr. IT. W. Blair, after completing at the office the computations of bis recent field work, was assigned to duty under Mr. Hilgard's immediate direction in February, and assist.ell in the re,ision of the star catalogue for observations of latitude. He also made experiments with an optical dcnsimeter devised by l\fr. Hilgard, and with a new form of drop-cylinder water-specimen cup described in Appendix No. 14, Report for 18i7, and, beside other measurement!': of precision, made elaborate comparisons between standard ,yar<fa bronze No. 11 and iron Xo. ii7 to Yerify the relative drnnge heretofore indicated in these two important standards, which were in 1856 preseuted to the United States by Great Britain as original and verified copies of the Imperial :nird. Early in April )lr. Blair was ordered to duty in the field. Assistant A. T. Mosman, who reported for office duty in the beginning· of March, was occupied in making a descriptive catalogue of foe instruments helongiug to the survey. Towards the close of that month he was detached in order to continue the primary triangulation from the Blue Ridge westward. Assistants J. A. Sullivan and F. D. Granger were assigned to the computing division during the few weeks they were on duty in the office. Late in March they were ordered to fielu service. Mr. E. Hergesheimer, upon his recovery from se,·ere illness, reported fo1· duty under Mr. Hilgard's immediate direction in January, and executed drawings of chart of Saint .Tohn's RiYer and of Uockaway Inlet for publication by photolithography. He was subsequently occupied in com· posing guide maps for topographical drawing adapted to secure uniformity in the mode of representing topographical details, and in making micrometric comparisons of certain graduatecl scales. Hydrographw Division.-In this division, which remained under the direction of Commander E. P. Lull, U.S. N., Hydrographic Inspector, aided b,y Lieuts. )Y. I. Moore and \Y. H. Parker, TJ. S. N., on cluty during part of the year, the draughtsmen's work is summarily stated as follows : Mr. E. Willenbucber has protracted, })lotted, and drawn fifteen hydrographic sheets, made the verification of thirty-six hydrograpbic sheets for registry, verwed reductions of h;ydrogTaphy for eleven charts, examined seven charts for additions and corrections of aids to u:wigation, made eight projections for hydrographic parties, and executed miscellaneous diagrams and rednctiom; for the office and tracings to meet calls for information. Mr. W. C. Willenbucher has protracted, plotted, and drawn twelve hydrographic sheets; verified, inked, and finished ten bydrographic sheets; brought up the progress sketches to date, and ha.s made such miscellaneous tracings and reductions as from time to time were required. Mr. Julius Sprandel was unable by reason of failing health to give much time w office work. He had protracted, plotted, and drawn three hydrograpbic sheets previous to his death, which

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The services of the hydrograpbic inspector are elsewhere referred to in this report. Oornputing _Division.-The direction of this division of the office was continued with Assistant C. A. Schott. The distribution of work among the computeri> was kept up as in former years as far as the small number of computers would allow, there being but three during December and January. Mr. Main's health, reported unsatisfactory at the plose of the last report, did not im· prove during the summer, and his services were necessarily discontinued from September until l\1ay, when they were resumed with reduced daily time of attendance and corresponding pay. l\lr. C.H. Van Orden was on dut.r in the computing division during July; Mr. M. W. Wines, during July, August, and September; Mr. B. Bradbury, jr., during part of September; Mr. C. A. Ives, during part of October and November. Assistant ;F. D. G-ranger reported for duty February 1, 1878, and was detached March 28; Assistant J. A. Sullivan reported for duty March 4, and was deta{lhed April 15; l\fr. P. Lobauofl' was engaged ,pn special duty from May 1 to the close of the fiscal .rear. The limited force of regular computers was just sufficient to attend to the more important current work. · .Much of the time of the chief of the division is necessarily taken up with preparing replies to official cones1)011dence; with directing, distributing, supervising, and reporting on the various computations; with furnishing geographical positions of light-houses, magnetic variation, and cor· rected longitudes for charts. The discussion of the secular change of the magnetic declination was extended by Mr. Schott to stations in Brazil, Mexico, Alaska, and the Sandwich Islands, and the data for many stations in tlie United St:ites were brought forward. This valuable discussion appears in a paper published seJlarately from this report. In September, 1\ir. Schott visited the magnetic observatory located at the University of Wisconsin, and provided for its more effective working. A full report on this observatory, including its history, description, and adjustment of instruments, determination of constants, and discussion of results J1as been prepared hy him. The results obtained during the 1irst two years of its existence are nearly ready, and will be printed in a subsequent report. The usual annual magnetic observations at Washington were made by Mr. Schott in June, 1878. He has also prepared a new register of magnetic data, in which the stations are arranged by States, and for each in chronological order. He also observed and prepared the report on his own and the observations of other officers of the Coast Survey on the transit of Mercury across the disk of the sun on Ma.y 6, Appendix No. 7. On June 24, 1878, Assistant Schott was appointed assistant in charge of the office during the absence of .Assistant Hilgard, retaining at the same time the special charge of the computing division. The work in detail performed by each com1mter during the fiscal year 1877-'78 is as follows: l\Ir.·James Main computed the observations for latitude and azimuth at Y\:mng Mountain, N. C., 1876, and those for time and azimuth at Middle Base, Helena, Ark., 1878, and at King, N. C., 1877. He also furnished star places for 1ield parties. Dr. Gottlieb Rumpf computed the following secondary and tertiary triangulations: State triangulation of "Wisconsin, 1875-'76; near Santa Monica, Cal., 1875; coast between Monterey and Point Sur, Cal., 1875; local triangulation at Madison, Wis., 1877; vicinity of Mare Island, Cal., 1877; south side of Long Island, near .Rockaway, N. Y., 1875; vicinity of Buzzard's Bay, Mass., 1870-'71; Mississippi River above New Orleans, La., 1876-'77; James River, Va.., 1875-'76-'77; Santa Barbara Island, Cal., 1871; Boston Harbor, Mass., 1877; coast near Fort Ross, Cal., 1876-'77; and nearly completed the triangulatron between Nisqually and Budd's Inlet, Wash. Ter., 1877. He also prepared abstracts of horizontal-angles survey of New Jersey, 1876-'77; perfo:rmed miscellaneous geodetic computations and supplied geodetic data for field parties, or in reply to inquiries made by office correspondents. Mr. Edward H. Courtenay was engaged in the preparation of the geographical register containing the results of the triangulations; completed the fitting on of the old sooonda.ry and ter~ tiary triangulation, sea coast of North Carolina, between Upper Currituck Sound and Core Sound; revised abstracts of horizontal directions and of vertical angles at primary stations in the Blue Ridge, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Oarolina., also in Georgia.; computed the magnetie ob-

servations, absolute values taken at Madison, Wis., in 1876 and in 1877; collected and tabulated magnetic constants for three magnetometers; assisted in the solution of normal eq nations resulting from primary triangulation; computed magnetic obsen·ations made lately by Assistants Boutelle, Mosman, Smith, and Braid; adjusted primary triangulation about Mount ·wasbington, N. H., and nearly completed the computation of the new triangulation of the Delaware Rirnr, near Philadelphia, 1877-'78. He also assisted in preparing the annual statistics of geodetic work, and had general charge of copying and clerical work. Mr. M. H. Doolittle made abstracts of resulting directions of primarr stations, .Tohns, Ga., 1875; Moore, N. C., 1876-'77; King, X C., 187G-'77; adjusted that part of the primary triangulation between Pine Log, Ga., and Brandon, .A.la.; computed the triangulation of the Connecticut River between the Sound, and north of Hartford, 1861-'62-'75; assisted in the preparation of the annual statistics, made miscellaneous magnetic computations; read off the photographic traces of tabulated results of differential magnetic observations made at Madison, ·wis., between March, 1877, and March, 1878; computed position of primary stations about the Santa .Barbara Islands, Cal., 1876-'77, and fitted on part of the secondary and tertiary work of the same locality, and nearly completed the computation for length of the Lebanon base line, Tenn., 1877. The computing division also had temporary assistance during tlie year as follows: Mr. C.H. Van Orden, attached to the division during .July, 1877, attended to miscellaneous copying, preparation of sketches, and miscellaneous geodetic computations. Mr. M. W. Wines, attached to the division between July 1 and September 26, 1877, attended to copying of data for field parties, and to special clerical work under the direction of the assistant in charge of the office. Mr. B. Bradbury, jr., was engaged in reading off magnetic traces bet,ween September 8 and 27. Mr. 0 . .A.. Ives reported for duty October 19, computed positions of a number of tertiary points, attended to clerical work, and prepared information for various field parties. He was detached from the office ~ ovcmber 30. .A.ssistantF. D. Granger was temporarily assigned to duty in the computing division. Between February 1 and March 28, 1878, he assisted in preparing abstract of directions of primary stations, King, N. C., 1876-'77; .A.nacapa, Cal., 1876; Laguna; Cal., 1877; Santa Barbara, Cal., 1876. He also adjusted three quadrilaterals of the Santa Barbara channel survey, and prepared geodetic information for a field party. Assistant J. A. Sullivan was temporarily assigned to duty in the computing division between March 4 and April 15, when he computed the triangulation of light-houses on Delaware Bay, executed by himself in 1877. He also assisted in proof-reading of annual report. Mr. P. Lobanoif was employed since May 1 on reading off and tabulating photographic traces of magnetic observatory at Madison; he also assisted occasionally in tracing descriptive sketches of stations for fiel~ parties. Tidal Division.-Mr. R. S. .A.very remained in charge. He inspected all records of tidal observations when received from the bydrographic partie.." or from the permanent tidal stations; furnished tidal data for use on the charts and to meet calls for information; arranged the observa· tions for reduction; prepared for publication the predictions of tides for the Atlantic and Pacific Coast 1.'ide Tables for 1879; and studied improvements in the construction of self-registering tide gauges. Referring to the establishment of a self-registering gauge, loaned by the Coast Survey, at a station in the Sandwich Islands, in connection with the govenuuent survey of those islands under W. D. Alexander, esq., it is suggested by Mr. .A.very tbat it would be desirable to establish a tidal station at a point similarly located in relation to the tides of our Atlantic coast. The Bermuda Islands would seem to be favorably placed for this purpose, being separated from our coast by the deep channels of the Gulf Stream. In the following table is given a statement of the names of stations at which self-registering gauges have been established, with the number of days upon which observations were recorded since the last report:

Each obsern:r forwards to the office, with the gang-e record, his tabulation of the times and heights of high and low waters, tlH1 comparative reading;-; of staff a,nd aut.omatic record, and the hourly orclinateR deduced from the tidal curve. These tabulations, when verified, serve ais a basis for the office reductions. In the work of the division, Mr. Avery bad the aid of the following-named persons: Mr. ,Johu DowneH wa;; employed chiefly in the tabulation and reduction of the tidal observation!'\ made upon the .Atlantic coaRt and upon the t.idal predictiom; of this coast for 1879. Mr. L. P. Shidy made reductions of short series of observatio11s for many stati011s on the Atlantic and l'acific coasts, predicted tides for ports at which tbe diurnal inequality was large, and aided in miscellaneous computations. M:is11 M. Thomas continued to work mostly on hourly readings and copying, and a.i1'led in the predictions. She had al8o charge of the office library until January 28. Drawing Dh:i.~ion.-This division has continued under charge of Mr. W. T. Bright. The clerical and other rniseellaneoz1.~ duties have been performed during the year by Mr. G. A. Morrison. The force of principal draughtsmen consisted of Messrs. A. Lindenkohl, H. Lindenkohl, C. ,Junken, I,. Karcher, and P. V. Erichsen, who have drawn the more important topographic and hydrographic charts for publication by copper-plate engraving or photolithograph~'· Tbe work performed by each is stated in Appendix No. 4. :Messrs. C. A. Meuth, H. Eicllholtz, and E. Molkow have clliefty been engaged in bringing np hy hand tlte aids to ria~rigation upon the published charts. This information is receked in the dfrision, and the necessary corrections and additions made previous t.o its insertion upon the printing-plate. l\y this means the sale agents are supplied with the latest data. They have also furnished t.J:ie info~mation asked for by bureaus of the government and citizens, in the form of tmcings and diagrams. Mr. E .·J. Sommer has been employed in the division since April, and has 11rincipal1y been engaged upon drawings for charts to he pl1otolithograpl1ed. Mr. B. Bradbury, jr., aid, who was temporarily attached to the division at the date of last year's report, was as.signed to field duty in August. The list of charts a.ud tiketches which have been completed or iu progress during the year, given in Ap\w.ndix No. 41 will at a glance show the large amount of work accomplished. From aver~' recent experimental beginning in the production of charts by photolithogra.phy, this process has grown to be a most important auxiliary in getting rapidly before the public the results of the iield work. ill addition to the compilation and publication of twenty-one charts by this means, progress bas been made upon seventy-eight charts of various sea.Jes, of which number forty·two have been com1>leted, including the pbotolithograpbic class. Appendix No. 3 gives a statement of information furnished by the division upon the application of officers of the United States Engineer Corps, officers of the Army, light.house engineers and inspectors, and other persons, for tracings and copies of speciaJ maps and charts. Some eighty. four calls of this description were met during the year. . Forty-seven diagrams of various descriptions were oonstruct.ed, t.ogether with drawings of numerous instruments of precision and engravings upon st.one, to illustra.t.e the papers accompa.-

nying the annual reports. The matter of correcting the original copper-plate engra~ings for the latest determination of longitude has continued to receive attntion. Projections for new charts have been constructed upon six copper plates. As the work of the survey advance;.;, it becomes in many cases necessary to revise former prqjects for charts that were constructed upon data derivefl from reconnaissances and imperfect maps. In the course of the year about thirty-five projects ha\e been reconstructed and adjusted to suit Letter the wants of the na,-igator. The numerous calls by the field parties for prqjections on drawing paper liave been promptly met, forty-three having been constructed upon different scales. The large number of sketches Rhowing the progress of the field work have been duplicated for the film; of the Superintendent and computing division, and the annual progress sketches have recei\·ed the usual additions. Notwithstanding the great amount of this miscellaneous work, the di\"i.~ion has furnished and has on hand an abundant, !impply of material for engraving, and has made progress commensurate with the field work in many sections as the data became available. Engraving Division.-The direction of the work in this division remained with Assistant L.A. Sengteller during the fiscal year. Towards its close, having received instructions to resume field duty 011 the Pacific coast, he macle auangements for the transfer of the charge of the division to his successor, Assistant J. S. Bradford. ~ In a careful and elaborate report of the work executed in detail by the seyeral engravers, and of the condition of the engraved plates, Mr. Sengteller refers to the efforts made to bring up to date the plates of those charts most in demand by naYigators. These efforts ha,-e been so far successful that all of the principal coast charts are now brought up to the current year, aud a "note of issue" engraved upon each plate, bt>aring the date to which it has been corrected; this has been done also with the plates of the principal harbor charts, sailing charts, and general coast charts. l\:fessrs.·J· .Enthoffer, A. Sengteller, H. C. Evans, .J . ·T. Young, \Y. A. Thompson, and }{. F. Bartle have continuml a.1; topographical engravern. Messrs. E. A. l\faedel, A. Petersen, H. M. Knight, ,J. G. Thompson, and F. Courtenay have continued as letter engravers. Messrs. E. H. Sipe and H. Davis have been employed as miscellaneous engravers. Mr. ,J. J. Young, during the greater part of the year, was engaged in etching the views for the Coast Pilot. The duties of copyist in the division were snccessivel;v discharged b~· Messrs. E. l\folkow, G. A. Morrison, and (since hiR reappointment February 1) b,\' )fr. L. C. Kerr. The compilation of an historical record of every plate was begun by Mr. W. B. French, who was detailed specially for that duty, and carried it on at intervals since November, 187i; upon the detaebment of Mr. French, for field service early in Marcl1, the work was for a time suspended, but towards the end of May resumed by Mr. John H. Smoot. In Appendix No. 5 will be found a detailed statement of plates completed, continued, or begun during the year, together with work in detail performed by each engraver. Electrotype and Plwtographing Division.-Under the direction of Dr. A. Zumbrock, who remained in charge, fifty-seven altos and twenty-eight bassos or printing plates were made from the original engraved plates; one hundred and fifty-four prints, fifty-three uegatives, and fifteen positives were furnished for the use of the draughtsmen and engra~ers. Dr. Zumbrock was aided by Mr. Frank Over. Miscellaneous Division.-The organization of this division, up to May of the present year, involved the direction of details in ~he care of the office buildings, the printing and distribution of the charts and reports, the charge of the stationery and instruments, and the care of the office disbursements. These duties were faithfidly and acceptably performed by ]\fr.·John T. HooYer until failing health obliged him to relinquish them. Ilis death, deeply lamented by all of his associates in the office, has been referred to in another part of this report. A rearrangement of the work of the division ha;ring been found to a certain extent desirable, Mr. M. W. Wines was assigned to the charge of the details relating to the office building, the care of the stationery, and the printing and distribution of the charts and reports; Mr. ,V, A. Herbert W the keeving of the office accounts; Mr. G. N. Saegmiiller to the care of the instrument records.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The duty of registering and filing for reference the original sheets, topographic and hydrographic, and the records of observaticms as received from the field parties continued to be performed by Mr. G. A. Stewart. From the chart room, under the immediate care of Mr. Thomas McDonnell, there were distributed, during the year, upw!Lrds of twenty-one thousand copies of charts; ovei: five thousand of this number were placed with agents for sale at the principal sea-ports; upwards of four thousand were furnished to meet the demands of the several departments of the government; thirty-three hundred were supplied to members of Congress. The distribution of the Coast Survey Reports amounted to one thousand and three copies. There were printe(l during the year twelve thousand and sixty-seven impressions from engraved plates; the numbel' of lithographed copies of charts published was thirty-eight hundred and nineteen. Mr. Fmnk Moore, assiRted by JI.fr. D. N. J;loover, served as copper-plate printer; Mr. H. Nissen attended to the preparation of the backed drawing .paper for field parties, and to the various requirements of the folding-room. The work of the instrument-shop was performed by Mr. G. N. Saegmiiller, chief mechanician, and by Messrs. John Clark, W. Jacobi, and E. Eshleman. Among the subjects which occupied Mr. Saegmiiller's' time when not engaged in routine work, may be mentioned the improvements in the construction of the dividing engine to render it capable of executing more accurate circular graduations, and the regraduation, with very satisfactory results, of one of the fourteen-iuch theodolites. The design and construction of a prismatic donbleimage eye-piece for simultaneous use by two observers in determining personal equation is also due to him. This is described in the Transactions of the International Geodetic Association for 1878. l\lr. John Clark has been engaged on improvements in the primary-base apparatus, assisting in its comparisons with the standards mentioned elsewhere; in constructing the level of precision described in Appendix ~o. -, and in other work requiring great skill and ex1rnrience. Mr. Werner Suess was employed on piece work, under the immediate direction of the assistant in charge, in constructing various self-registering magnetic and thermometric instruments, portable chronographic a1)paratus, and the optical densimeter for ascertaining the density of sea water, mentioned elsewhere in this report and described in Appendix No. 10 of the report for 1877. He also aided Assistant Schott in perfecting the building and apparatus of the Magnetic Observatory at Madison, Wis. Mr. A. Yeatman, carpenter, assisted during part of the year by F. E. Lackey and C. Webster, made the wood-work for instruments, packed them for transportation, and did all of the carpentry required by the office. The clerical duties in the office of the assistant in charge were performed by Messrs. M. W. Wines, W. B. French, and W. A. Herbert, with the occasional aid of Messrs. F. R. Parsons and George A. Morrison. As heret.ofore, the expenditures of the year for every purpose connected with field work and bydrography, have been strictly controlled by preceding estimates, of which each item as to its character and amount has been separately examined. l'arty estimates are revised in all cases when reductions are deemed expedient, and are approved by the Superintendent in advance of any outlay whatever. The control thus-provided for is made complete by the attention of the disbursing agent, J. W. Porter, by whom the account.'l of the chiefs of parties are kept in conformity with the ap1>roved estimates. My correspondence with the surveying parties, needful references pertaining t.o the progress of work under my official instructions, and to administrativ(> details generally, have been facilitated. as usual by the care of Assistant W.W. Cooper, and by his summary offhe operations of the year in the field and afloat. Respectfully submitted. CARLILE P. PATTERSON, Superintendent Ooast and Geod.etic Survey. Hon. JOHN SHERMAN, Secretary of the Treasury.

APPENDIX No. 6.
OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRANSIT OF MERCURY, MAY 6, 1878, ~IADE AT SGMMIT STATION, CENTRAL PACIFIC RAILROAD.-REPORT BY B. A. COLONNA, ASSISTANT.
Co.A.S'.l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY, SUB-OFFICE,

San Francisco, Ca1., JuM 23, l878. SIR: I have the honor t-0 submit to you my report of the observations of tb.e transit of Mercury, May 6, 1878, made at Summit Station, Central Pacific lfailroad. Owitig to a delay in receiving your telegraphic instructions of April 13, we bad only about ten days to oolloot instruments, attend to the many minor details of such an expedition, get to Summit, clear away the snow for a place for thf' observatories, erect them, put up piers, run a telegraphic wire from the telegraph office at Summit to the station to be occupied, and so on. Mr. Pratt, with bis usual ingenuity, devised a transit machine run by clock work, repreRenting the sun and Mercury with their apparent motions, gi,·ing us a very gootl artificial tranf-lit for practiee. He did the mechanical work himself, and had it ready in time for UR to have two days' practice with it before we left the city. 'Ve again practiced with it at Summit. With Mr. Pratt's aid, and with that of Carl Rahsskopff, instrument maker, we found ourselves sufficiently advanced in preparation to leave San Francisco on the 30th of April. Through the kindness of Assistant Davidson's friend, Col. George Gray, chief engineer of the Southern Pacific Railroad, I procured an order from Mr. John Corning, the assista11t general superintendent of the Central Pacific Railroad, for the transportation of our instruments by passenger train. \Ve arrived at Summit at about 11 o'clock p. m. on the night of the 30th of April, and in the dark unfoaded our instruments ourselves. Our reception was certainly a very cool one, made all the more so by contrast, for we had only a few hours ago pa."ised through the Sacramento Yalle;v, where the flowers were in bloom and the freshness of spring was to be seen on all 8ides; now, the snow shed8 cut off even the starlight and left us in utter darkness. I desired very much, in accordance with your instructions and Asi<istant DM-idsou's counsel, to get the instruments mounted on a bill ;~bout 800 feet higher than the railroad track at Summit, but it was impracticable, for the snow, about five feet df'ep on a le''Pl and in 111a11.v places drifted to greater depths, presented difficulties that could not, with the means at hand, lie overcome without much time. So I was reluctantly compelled to mount them as shown in the accompanying sketches of the station and vicinity. On the 1st day of May the transit pier was set and the transit mounted. That night I put it in the meridian and observed for time. On the 2d, )\Ir. Pratt ran the telegraph wires from the Wt>stern Union Telegraph office to the observatory and put up the chronograph, and we were ready to get the Washington Nantl Observatory time Mignals on the 3d of Max-these preparations and the sub~equent exchanges of time signals being greatly facilitated by the courtesy of l\lr.·Tames Gamble, general superinte11dent of the Paeifie Division of the Western Union Telegraph. The evening of the 4th found us with our instruments all mounted. Besides the ohservation of the contacts, preparations had been made to observe for time and the sun's limb:s and Mercury, with an instrumental outfit consisting oflst.. For time observations, meridian telescope C. S. No. 1, made by Wtirdt>mann. 2d. Three chronometers, viz: Sidereal break-circuit No. 3'79; mean-time chronometer No. :!31; mea.n·time chronometer No. 1702. 3d. A chronograph. 4th. The "Hassler telescope," made by Utzschneider and Fraunhofer and e,quatorially mounted. This telescope is 3. 75 feet focal length, three inches clear a~rture, and Mr. Pratt used it for observ, ing the contacts with an eye-piece whose magnifying power was 200 diameters.

5th. A 5f-inch telescope, the private property of Assistant Eimbeck, on the new equatorial mounting belonging to the Coast S1u,·ey, and here used for the first time. It rested on a wooden stand which rested on a rock foundation, aud was filled with stone w steady it. This telescope has a clear aperture, as stated above, and a focal length of 7 feet. I used it for observing the contacts, with an eye-piece the magnifying power of which was 120 diameters. 6th. A barometer, kindly loaned by Assistant Aug. F. Rodgers, there being none in this office that would read low enough for the altitude of Summit. All of these instruments were mounted in tents or surrounded by tent-walls, and generally well protected from the wind; about 5 feet of packed snow had to be shoveled to get space enough for the tents. On the 5th we received time signals from Washington, attended to various minor details, and spent much time in practice on the automatic transit machine. We did not compare notes, converse, or in any manner endeavor to get markings t~1at would coincide, for I thought that two in· dependent judgments of the times of contact would be more desirable. Nor did we, aner the observations, converse upon the subject until each had prepared his own notes and placed them upon record. The weather was bright and pleasant, so bright, in fact, that we were obliged to wear colored glasses to pre,·ent becoming snow-blind. The snow had melted down to about 3 feet around the instruments. On the 5th it became partially overcast with cirrus and cirro-stratus clouds. The wind blowing fresh from the southwest, the barometer had fallen 0.15 inch. It cleared off, however, in the afternoon, so that the usual time observations were made. The sun rose on the morning of the 6th in a cloudless sky. We were at the instruments at 5.30 a. m. The night had been quite cold, and the thermometer now stood at 270. There was much ice. The chronograph was cold and the ink: was frozen hard. We began by thawing out things generally, and placing the telescopes HO that they woald gradually warm, in order not to shiYer the colored glasses when we began poiutiug. The chronograph was so arranged that we both marked upon it, Mr. Pratt with one pen and I with the other. Sidereal break-circuit chronometer No. 3479 was in my circuit, and placed near me, where I also had Mr. Crittenden to mark the time b~· e~·e and ear whenever I recorded on the chronograph; the click of my ke~· waR the signal for him to mark tue time. Mr. Berndt l1eld a lam1' beneath the ink-wells to pre\·ent the ink from freezing and make it flow freely. From time to time during the last half hour before ingress we watched a little outside the sun's limb to ascertain if we coul<l see anything of the planet. A minute or so before contact we finally assumed our poisitions at the instruments, and the observations at ingrei;s were made as recorded. At noon I observed the sun's first and second limbs and the planet., as they crossed the three wires nearest the center of the transit, Mr. Pratt recording and attending to the chronograph. The day remained cloudless to its close, and the afternoon observations were made in the same manner and under the same favorable conditions as those of the morning. The phenomena of Mercury's appearance and disappearance reminded me of what I have seen in North Carolina and elsewhere, when, in a boat, on a bright day, looking over the water and a.cross the marsh, say at a tree distant :.!~ miles, and where from one-fourth to one-half 'mile of the distance is over reedy marsh, then you have the same unisteady boiling and jumping as on the sun's limb. As you approach, the tree comes into view, the top first, a kind of black phantom, so to speak, tliat filts before your eyes and repeats itself. Now, if you rise in the boat gradually, a,s. suming an erect posture, the tree takes form and becomes permanently visible just as Mercury did at ingress. Receding from the object, and being erect, you have the appearance of egress w-hen you take your seat. The waves of heated air on the marsh that roll, as it were, over the tree top, a.re rather longer than the waves that are apparently on the sun's limb. Mercury was rather egg-shaped, or elongated, when projected against the sun near it.& limb just aft.er ingress and just before egress, the smaller end being next the nearest point in the sun's circumference. At night I continued my observations for time. The siderea.l ehronometer (3479) loses rapidly with the thermometer at 210, while at about 520, or a. little over, it baa EMl8or001y any rate. ·

I have never had the pleasure Qf spending a day under a clearer or brighter sky. By 9h 30m a. m. the wind, which was not very strong m'en at sunrise, had fallen almost to a calm, all things combining to make it a most suitable day for the observations. Upon the conclusion of the work I notifieu you, and you authorizell a latitude and longitude station to be made. Time signals were received from Washington up to the 10th. Ou the night of the 9th, Mr. Pratt started for San Francisco to make the necessary arrangements for exchanging time for telegraphic longitude, and to make the time observations at the Coast Survey Observatory at 'Vashington Square. Six good night-.;; of time, and exchange of like dates, having been obtained with San Francisco by the 2d of' June, I considered it ample for the work in hand. When Mr. Pratt left Summit our mutual understanding was that the observations should be made by eye and ear. When he came to attempt it, he found that, the clock heing in a case, the tick could not be heard without the use of an armature, which i;; very objectionable. As there was no break-circuit chronometer for him, and his time exchange had to be made through the dock, he very properly decided that it would be better to abandon tlw eye and ear method and use the chronograph; but I was not a ware of the change of method until I returned to San Francisco. It was deemed desirable, therefore, to determine our absolute personal equations, which was done by means of the Coast Survey personal-equation apparatus. At the observatory i11 Sa,n Francisco .\ir. Pratt made some changes in the swit,cbes, &c., and altered the chronograph from a cylindrical to a fillet. He al,;o introduced a third pen for his absolute equation, thus making one chronograph do the work of two. As for my own absolute eqnation, the apparatu,; reco1·ded the absolute time of transit over the middle thread, and I marked the same by eye and ear, Mr. Pratt attending to the chronograph, and Mr. T. A. Harrison, late of the Sun'e,y, very ki!Hlly reconli11g for me without remuneration. Mr. E. F. Dickins, Subassistant Uoast Sun'ey, on leave, rnlnuteered his services. He was, as usual, precise and methodical; his services were timely and veQ' a,cceptable. The longitude work ha,ring been completed, I converted the merillian telescope from a transit into a zenith telescope and began observing for latitude. On the night of the 11th of ,J trne I considered ti1at I had sufficient ohser,-ations for the purpos'), and on the 13th the instmment was packed, the observatory was taken down, and everything removed to the station in time for the morning train. I desire.to mention the services of Mr. Robert Hughes, who, in addition to his duties as telegraph operator, rp,corded both the longitude and latitude work. I dwell with great pleasure on the trust which you have been pleased to repose in me. At all times your generous support of my ell.deavort:i is a sufficient guarantee for my best and entire services. V cry respectfully, yours, B. A. COLONXA, Assistant Coast Survey. CAR.LILE P. PATTERSON, Superintendent United States OoiuJt and Geodetic flurvey, W ashingt-0n, D. 0.

which was filled with earth and stones to keep it steady. The whole was protected from the wind and weather by Professor Davidson's la,rge obsenring tent. For h:tlf an hour Lefore first contact I occasionally scanned the snn's limb in the vicinity of the point of coutact to see if au.v signs of the planet could be seen. Having rested my eyes for a few minutes preparatory to the final observation, I had not been looking a minute before I saw Mercury's limh antl recorded the time marked (a). It appeared in the eye-piece of my telescope as in this sketch, except that the shaded part was invisible. Fiery waves appeared at this instant to roll along behind and across it, and the next instant to disappear. This immediately ceased, and it was at this ir1stant that I marked (a), which I consider vt>r,v near t11e true time of first contact. Retween the fiery waves were black balls of irregular shape and contiuua11y changing. At the time (b), which wm,; marked when the planet was so far on that the most casual observer could not foil to see it, it presented the appearance as in sketch marked (b). I do not attach an~· particular value to this marking. I had intended marking the time when the planet was apparently bisected by the sun's limb, but it was boiling so that I found that no such estimate could be well made. Ingress, secon.d contnet, internal. Marked the time (c). At this contact the planet had partially assumed its round appeMance, t11e cu8ps did 11ot meet sl1arp a)l{l chmr, bnt were preceded hy fiery waves. At the instant that these seerved about to begin, I marked (c), as seen in sketch. I was about on time, for the next instant the first ticry waYes ran acros8 and contact was probably over. \,Yheu thf'Re waves ceas(·d, an<l there was a well-defined bright line of light between the limbs of the 8llll aml of Mercury, which could not be mistaken, I marked (d). To this marking I attaeh no particular value. Egress, third contact~ internal. The telescope was in all respects the same as at ingress, except that a very slight amount of moisture bad formed betwePn the two glasses. I was afraid to risk taking them apart to wipe them, althougl1 I took out the o~ject gla8s and wipd the inner surface where very heavy drops of dPw bad formed. The moisture between the glasses eould ouly be seen in certain lights, and I conl<l not sefl that it matf'rially affected vision. The sky continued beautifully bright, and not a cloud had bee11 seen during the day. For 30 minutes before third contact, I watched occasionally to see if tlwrc was anything worthy of note. The sun's circumference Beeme<l to boil worse than at ingress, and as Mercury approached the sun's limb it seemed to be slightly deformed (this sketch exaggerates it about three times), and to mo,·e mnch slower. The latter of course wa.s not tltP case, hut I record it as it appeared to me at the time. At the time marked (a') the planet appeared as in the sketch, with rippling fiery and black balls chasing each other between it and the sun's limb. The time (b') was marked when I considered third contact actually made, or at the instant when the waves of fire or balls ceasell t-0 roll b1:>twe,en the two limbs. The time (c') was marked after third contact was so plainly visible as to be noted by a casual observer. I do not attach any particular value to it.

'\Vaves of light hf'gan to roll between Mercury and tbe sun, and to indicate the immediat;e approach of fourth contact when I marked (d'), as in the sketch. The limb of Mercury next the sun was now sliglttly distorted. At (e') the planet actually disappeared in the dark space beyond the sun's circumference, and I markc·d it as the time of what I considered the actual fourth contact. I then continued to RParch for several minutes, ho1ling to see the planet beyond the sun's circumference, but it had totally disappeared, and the transit was over.

OBSERVATIONS MADE AT "WASHINGTON, D, C., OF THE TRANSIT OF MERCURY, MAY 61 1878.-REPORT OF CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT.
COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., Jlfay 7, 1878. DEAR SIR: With your approbation, the undersigned, associated with Assistant R. D. Cutts, made the neces1:mry arrangements for observing the transit of Mercury of May 6, 1878, the results of which, together witll those by Assistant W. Eirnbeck, are herewith respectfully submitted. In thus multiplying observations in this city, I bad in view the desirability of obtaining data for assigning the probable ~rror to the observed times of the several phases, and consequently also of increasing the value of the local results. Assistant Cutts and myself observed at Fauth & Co.'s observatory and yard, southwest of the Capitol, 8".7 south of the dome, or in latitude 38° 53' 11".7, and 9".4 west of it, or in longitude 770 00' 45".1. The United States Naval Observatory being in longitude 5h 08"' 12".1, our place of observation was 9·.I east of' the Naval Observatory. Assistant Eimbeck observed in the rear of the Uoast Survey buildings, in latitude 38° 53' 11 11 and fa longitude 770 00' 34".7, hence 9·.8 east of the Naval Observatory. Local time was obtained by means of the noon-ball at the Observatory, viz:

I observed the ingress with an equat-0rial made by Fauth & Co., of this city, of 8 feet focal length, aperture 6~ inches, object-glass thinly silvered, and opening reduced to 3 inches diameter, ma.gnifying power about 112; used a light-colored (neutral tint) shade glass. Time was counted and noted by Mr. M. H. Doolittle. First external contact at 10h 05m 06· (by Dent 2256). When first seen limb of planet was considerably advanced, nearly double the amount of indentation as shown on Professor Newcomb's diagram, but the projected part apparently belonging to a smaller radius than the true one. Tried to catch the same size of phase at time of egress, but did not succeed on account of undulations; possibly the recordt~d minute should be one less. As it is I place no reliance on this outer contact. First internal contact at l()h 06m 40·, light darted across between sun and Mercury, but the limbs appeared loosely connected by a patch of haziness oscillating between them; full sunlight on and contact certainly over at lOh o6m 53·. The observation of internal contact is considered re· liable. Chronometer slow of Naval Observatory mean time 57·, henceh. m. s.

P.M. The third and fourth contacts were fully observetl with a t.elescope by Fauth of Wasltingtou, having a clear aperture of 2~ inches and a magnifsing power of 7S. As the t;e.le.scope was small, the observer determi11ed to note the time when the first doubt in regard to the contact arose, and a.gain when that doubt ended, under the supposition that the mean of the two would give a better result than could otherwise be obtained witll so small an objecti,,e and power.

The time was determined by Kessels' sidereal box-chronometer, and was referred to Observat.ory time. The definition of Mercury was sharp and steady. As the planet approached the undulating limb of the sun, the clear outline commenced to tremble.or break; and at this moment the time was called, anti again called, when the outline ceased to be visible. A thin cloud crossed the sun during this contact, which, however, did not interfere with the observation. The same course waR adopted for the last (external) contact, the time being noted when the inner limb of Mercury first became agitated, and again at its total extinguishment. RICH'D D. CUTTS.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, IJ. G., May 7, 1878. DEAR S1R: I take pleasure in submitting to you a report of the observation of the transit of Mercury May 6, 1878, as made by me at a station near southeast corner Coast Sarvey Office, in latitude 38° 53 1 111'.2 (north); longitude 77° 00' 34".7 west of Greenwich. The instrument employed was zenith telescope 0. S. No. 3, by 'rroughtou & Simms, of 3k inches clear aperture, and about 42 inches focal length. The magnifymg power used was 48 diameters for the morning observations, i. e., first and second contacts; aud a power of 120 diameters in the afternoon observations, or third and fourth contactt>. Time was noted by sidereal chronometer Hutton No. 220, adjusted so as to indicate approximately focal mean time. The four contacts were observed aud noted by chrO'llometer as follows, viz : Fir!lt contact (ingress) = JOh 05m 00'.0. Ohserve<l too late; notch much smaller than expected. Second contact (ingress) = JOh Oim 40·.o. Sun's limb just complete. Third contact (egress) = 5h 35m 06·.o. Instant of formation of ligament. Fourth contact (egress) = 51' 33m 04·.o. Observed t-Oo late. During the.morning observations the condition of the atmosphere proved very favorable, the well-defined solar limb appeared quite steady. In the afternoon the contacts were observed throng.h haze and a strongly boiling atmosphere. Especially at the occurrence of the last contact the sun's limb trembled and undulated violently, owing to which the observer is under the impression that. the con ta.ct was announced too late by about 5 or 10 seconds. It was difficult to judge the moment of disappearance of the notch in the solar limu.

'fhe definition of the telescope was very fair. Screens were used at the eye end oft.be telescope. 4bout an hour before observation the Hutton chronometer was compared with Dent No. 2256, the chronometer used by Mr. Schott. The comparisou was as follows: Hutton, 9h 01"' 47·.5

Col\IPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODJ<:TIC SURVEY,

February 2(), 1879.
DEAR SIR: Under date of Novemht>r 15, 1878, I submitted to the Superintendent a report· on tlie completion and results of the primary triaugnlation along the Blue Riilge between Wash-

ington, D. 0., anti Athwta, Ga. Jn this report I stated that the investigation of the probable error of this trinngulation was uot quite complete, and when completed would be communicated. This is now doue. I also submit in paper No. 1 a copy of the triangle-side computation to show the corrections to the mea .. nred angles needed to satill(Y the geometrical conditio111s of the triangulatiou. It has already bePu t-.tated, in the report referred to above, that no special equation was needed to bring the Keut l;;Jmul aud Peach Tree IUdge base lines into accord, since the values for length of junction line, as deriYed from tl1ese bases, already agx;eed closely. From the emplo,Ymeut of direction instruments, it migl!t be expected that there is no tendency tit her to oYenneasnrP or to urnlermea:mre the angles, and, in fact, if we collect the errors in the closing of the triaugles, we find for the 6:! triangles of the northern half of the triangulation, or between Kent Islaud bast-" and line Buftalo-.Moore 31 with + errors, amounting in Ille aggregate to 41".:i; ~H with - errors, amonnting iu the aggr«:>gate to 38".6; and for the 73 triangles of the southern half or between Dufl'alo-1\foQre and the Atlanta base, 30 "lith + errors, amounting in the aggregate to 41 11 .8; 43 with - errors, amountiug in the aggregate to 65".5. The want of balance I regard as accidental. If we arrange the errors in closiug of triangles according to the magnitude of the triangle, that is, according t-0 the valtle of the 1;pherical excess, we have the sum of the squares of errors as follows:

From the first part of the table we can hardly infer anything respecting a relation between the error in the closing of triangles and their mag11itude, but from the second part of the table it would seem that the rror of closing slightlJ increases with the size of the triangle. A law of this kind is very probable. The average probable error of a resultiug direction, as found from the statio11 or local adjustment, is± 0".19 for the northern and± 0".18 for the southern part of tlle triangulation. Now these numbers are ver~· much smaller than the fiual corrections to the directio11s a8 r1:>sulting from the figure adjustment; in fact on this difference depends the application of weights iu the a<\jnstment, and it forms the distinctive feature of' our met.hod of treatment as explnmed, Coast Suney Report for 1864, p. 1:!9, article 9. It is here also clearly seen that ltny increase in the uurnber of measures or observations, or the substitution of i11strume11ts superior to tbm;e actually used, would but very sligbtl.Y increase the accurac~· of the triangnlation. In onler to do tl1e latter effectively we would have to look to triauglf·s of bettt:>1· i,;hape, aml to more triangles entering in combination as well as to a sborteuing of the distanee betwce11 a11y two bas!' lines. In paper No. 2 I have gin;n a complete acconut of the consideratious for the computation of the probable error to which a triangulation ma,Y be liable in ccmsequcnce of the uncertaiut_'\· in the base measure and in conseq11ence of the unce,rtaiuties in the angular measures. The method now preseuted is tbe result of further atteution gin·n to the sul~ject since the last publication in the report of 1865. Heferring to this appendix, we haw tl1t· 1irolJable PITor or any measured angle for the triangulation between Keut Island and the junction line Buffalo-Moore = :I: 0''.63; and for the triaugulati 0 n between the Atlanta base and Ute junction :I: 011 .86; also, the probable error of the length of the junction line from the first or northern half of the Blue Ridge triangulation = ± 0'".6135, and from the 1Secoud or southern half = ± 0"'.8:!9; and eomhining with these values the effect of the prohahk errors of tlie ba1Se liues, or± 0"'.~08itnd ± om.OSJ, the respective probable errors become :l: 0'".fi97 anct ± 0"'.8:~3, heuce the probable error of the junction liue by comhiuation of these two values = :I: 0"'.;135, or 8 ,t 60 of its le11gth. The probable error of the measuI"e of Ute KP11t Islarnl ha;;t· ii,; ::!:: 2 :ri,1., 00 a111l of tl1e Atlanta base ± ~81n;-; hence the a\·emge probable error of the northern half of the Dlue Ridge triangulation = ± rn'900 , aud of the southern half= ± 1 " ".i,,00 of the length; and for the whole of the 602 statute miles of triangulation ± Teo\uo of its leugth, on the a,·erage. Paper No. 3 is submitted by special direction of the Superintendent, who desired that a complete account of the method of sol11tion of large nnmbers of normal eqirn,tions he preseutecl, and I have accordingly requesteil l\fr. M. H. Doolittle, of the Computfog Di\·isiou, to draw n1> this paper. This mtithod-of solution of linear uormal cqnatious is rigorous and direct, aml with systematic arrangement merely invoh·es mechanical labor. It may be applied to a far greater nurn ber of equations than we have had hitheTto occasion to solve (53). Its essential peculianty consists in first obtaiuing an approximate solution effected hy operating- only with a small number of significant figures of tbe coefficients inrnlYed &0 as to bring into use Orelle's tab!e.s. Logarithms are altogether dispensed with. An approximate \Talue for th..e first unknown quantity having been obtained from the first equation, and expressed in terms of the other unknown quantities contai1wcl in that equation, it is substituted in the second t>quation, anrl from this an approximate ya)ue of the second UIJknown quantity is found in terms of the remaining uuknowu quantities. Next follows a suh~titution iu the third equation, and so on to the end. Approximate n1lues of all unknown qua11titie1:1 ha.Ying thus been obtained, a rigorous substitution in the original equations is made, and tlie new and necessarily small residual"' are treatecl a seco11cl time in a manner similar to the first-llescrilierl proces.s, and the small corrections 11ow found are added to Ute firl'.lt 1tpproxi111atio11s. It is 1wt likely that a third treatment will ever be needed. To the paper .:\<Ir. Doolittle has atldetl some remarks pertinent to the proper solution and arrangement of comlitioual equations, eRpecially for the case irn·olving small angles. Pmctically, two computers arc employed in the solution of a11y large uumber of equations, and they l'Ompare their resnlts at t11e close of each da.}"s work, rnakiug the commission of any mistakes, without speedy detection, almost impossilile.

The primary triangulation, as measured along its axis, stretcheR over 602 statute miles between the Kent Island base and the Atlanta base. The junction line, which represents about the average width of the triangulation, is nearly midway between the bases (300 miles from Kent Island and 302 from the Atlanta line), and its length between Buffalo ' and Moore fl is 29.5 statute miles, or 47.5 kilometers nearly. Computed from the Kent Island base it i,,; 47 462m.826, from the Atlanta base 47 462"'.842 in length, the difference bein~ only O'te unit in the seventh place of decimals, or in linear measure about 15 millimeters, or a little over half an inch. This close accord must be regarded, in a measure, as accidental, though such accidents mmally happen only with good work. The true estimate of the value of our work is fnrnhshed by the probable error of the length of the junction line, which is a little less than ± om .6 or ± 2 feet, or ± 791h50 nearly of the length, but this quantity is not yet fin any settled. 'l'he close agreement at the junction rendered the extra labor of carrying a distance equation, for perfect accoril, un11ec!'ssary. The least square treatment of tlie northern half of the triangulation involved the solution of .52, and that of the sout,hern of 41 normal equations. Both sets were successfully solved in a \'ery short time, and the method of solution adopted by Mr. Doolittle will be presented with my full report. The accord in the azimuths of the line is no less remarkable. From the northern mean astronomical azimuth it is 3380 26' 34".07, and from the southern 338° 2G' 32".6:3, di:ffercncP 1".44, which includeis efiect of error in assumed spheroid. With respect to latitude, the northern ge0<letie latitudes overlap the southeru ones by nearly 4"; thus latitude of Moore from North 360 23' 49".905, from South 53".851; difference 3".946, about 12tm.7 or 399 feet. This I CXJJCCt to convert into a small quantity by lifting the triangulation from the surface of the now obsolete Bessel spheroid to that of Ularke's. The longitudes agree within l".2 or 0·.08, indicating that our approximate telegraphic longitude of Atlanta is probably nearly correct. In accordanee with your Yerlml approval, I shall resume my discussion of 1870, and bring out the final results for the whole olJlique arc. I remain, yours, very respectfully, C. A. SCHOTT, Assistant in charge of Office and Uomputing Dii-isio1'. CARLILE P. PATTERSON, Esq., Superintendent United StateJJ Coast and Geodetic Survey.

[PAPER No. 2.]

Estimation of the probable accuracy of a triangulation or approximate determin-ation of the average probable error of the adjusted distances. Since the pu'blication of the approximate probable uncertainty in the primary triangulation between the Epping base, Maine, and the Fire Island base, New York, in Coast Survey Report of 1865 (pp. 192 and following), the subject has received further attention with a view of a closer estimation of the probable error which might be expected in adjusted triangulation. The strict application of the method of least squares to the computation of the probable error of the adjusted distances depending upon the accuracy with which the angles and the base line have been measured-in other words, the application of the method to conditioned ob.servation.s-i.s too laborious t-0 be made, nor is it needed, since any tolerably fair estimate win answer all _practical purposes. Primarily, the a-ccuracy of the work depends upon the accuracy of the measures of the base and· of the angles, and upon the geometrical figure of the triangulation; that is, on the number of conditional equations involved. The greater the accuracy of the linear and angular measures the bett.er the shape of the triangles, and the great.er the number of checks vr conditions the smaller will be the average probable error. Supposing but a single chain of triangles, and no oondition as to &e· cord of two base lines (one being a check ba.11e), we may begin the computation of probable errol't!I with the base and first t.riangle and proceed to the adjacent triangle, and so on to the end or cheek base. This was done in 1865, with the precaution of selecting the best-shaped trillllgles t-0 form the

series between the terminal lines. This procedure will necessarily assign too great a value for the probable error: first, on account of the formula there employed for the probable error of a triangle side, which su11poses but !! of the angles measured instead of 3, and consequently ignore" the measure of the third :rnd the condition of the sum of the angles; and se1\omll,y, for the rea!l011 that the triangulation is composed of various geometrical figures, notably of quadrilatemls or other more or less complicated combinations of triangles, each of which contributes something to the aecura,cy of the whole. The most convenient form, and one usually employed for the computation of the probable error of a side of a triangle in which two of the angles are supposed measuretl aud subject to small errors, viz :

(1)
was given and numerically illustrated in the place citetl aboYe. If now, we lake account of the fact that all tl1e angles in each triangle are measured aml adjusted to their theoretical sum, viz: two right angles + spherical exce-s8, the abon~- expres;,;ion needs moditicatiou, and it can be made to assume the form given to it by Laplace. The same modification should be applietl to Strnve's formula, which is hut a difterent form of Equation (1). Our formula for the probable error'· of the dcd11ced side a, the angle A being adjacen.t to the ba8e b but opposite side a, and the angle 13 being at the vertex, becomesE~

The first column in each of tlle above tables gives the numl.Jer of the line, and the second the order of procedure. · The coefficients and absolute ttmn of Equation 1 are entered in line 1, columns 4 to 8, of Table A, not proceeding in any case beyoml four significant figures. The reciprocal of the leading !titter w is taken from Barlow's Tables, and entered in line ~, column 3, with the negative sign prefixed. All the remaining numbers in line 1 are multiplied by this reciprocal, and the product~ written underneath in line 2. This gives the value of w as an explicit ti.mction of x, y, and z.

The coefficients and absolute term of Equation 2 (omitting the coeilfoieut of w, already employed in tbe first equation as a coefficient of x) are now written in liue 1, Table 13. The coefficient of x and aJI tlie followi11g numbers in line I, Table A, are next multiplied by tlie l'Oefficient of x in line 2, and the products are \\Titteu in line 2, Table B. The alg-ehraic sum of lines J and 2, Table I~. is now entered in line :3, Table A, and line 4 is formed tl1erefrom i11 the same manner in which line 2 was forme<l from line 1. Omitting· the coefficients of ir and .r, the remaining terms of Equation 3 are written in line 3, Table R The ctmflieients of .r; and the following numbers in lines 1 aud 3, Table A, are respectively multiplied by the coefficients of yin li1ws 2 and 4, and the pro<luds entered in lines 4 and 5, Table B. The algebraic Rnm of lines a, 4, and;) of the latter table iR 11011 ent.ered in line 5, Table A, and the value of y as an explicit fuuctiou of z is determined in tl1e same manner as were similar values of u· arnl x, and eutered in the next line. In like mamier line fl, Table B, is taken from Equation 4, and lines 7, 8, and fl are formed from the coetlicientR of z and following- ternrn .iu Jim·>; 1, 3, and n, Table A, multiplied by the coefficients of z in line,;'.!, 4, uml 6. The algebraic sum is entered in line 7, Table A. If there were other equations aud unknown quantities, these processes would be repeated. The last repetition gives an approximatio11 to the value of the last unk11ow11 quantit,y. It is to he observed that the 1mmhers in Table ll have hut a single nse, while tho8e of Table A are m;ed (JYer and oYer; aud when the number of eqnatiom; is large, it is of great advantage tliat they should be thus tabulated by thernselYe;; in a form compact and easy of reference.

Other numbers may be extemled to four; hut it would be a waste of time to extend au~- umnber farther, except in the process of substitution for the determination of residuals. By this process, Mr. ,J. G. Porter and myself haYe soh·cd in ft rn and one-half days, or ;)G working hours, with far greater than requisite accuracy, 41 equations containing 174 side coefficients counting eacl1 but once, or 430 terms in all. Ead1 of m; made a complete solution, duplicating the work, and making frequent comparisons in order to avoid errors. For the sake of l>erspicnity in explanation and com·enience in printing, I have here made some slight departures from actual practice. For instance, in tlw solution of a large number of equations, it would be incouvenient to pass the eye and hand out to a vertical column of reciprocals; and they are better written in an oblique line near the quantities from which they are derived and with which they arc to be employed. II.-Additwn of new equatwn8. Suppose that after the solution of the foregoing equations and the consequent adjm·tment a new condition is established, resulting in the following normal equation: fl. 0 = - 2.0475w + 0.8362 x + 1.8567 y - 1.3149z + 8.2527 u - 1.8372; witl1 tbe addition of tbe term - 2.047:)u to the first of the 1nevious equations, + 0.8362u to the secoud, &c. Tlie absolute term is supposed not fo be an original discrepancy, but an outstanding resi<lnal, after the foregoing solution has fully entered into the adjustment, as is generally the case with azimuth and lengtll equations.

Table C(a) differs from Table C merely by the addition of the last reciprocal and the la:;;t column of coefficients. The coefficients (but not tbe absolute term) of the new equation are written in the first line of Table G. The mode of procedure is now very similar to that followed in the formation of Table E; but those products in which the reciprocals are factors are entered in the last column of Tahle C(a), and these products are again multiplied, as well as the other numbers in the same lines, by the same multipliers in the formation of the other lines of Table G. Thus the first number in the last column of Table O(a) = - 2.05 x - .184 = + .377; and the second numl>er in the last column of Table G 2.05 x - .205 x - .1842.05 x + .377 .773. Tile reciprocal of the sum of tl1e last column of Table G is entered at the end of the column of reciprocals in Table C(a); and its 1>roduct by the absolute term of the new equation gives an approximate value of u. The products of this value by its coefficients in the last column of Table C(a) furnish the first line of Table. H, and determine a correction to z. This table is now completed by the process employed in Tables D and F. If the absolute term of the new equation is an original discrepancy arising from new observations, as in the case of an extensiou of a survey, it is simply necessary to substitute the previously

determined yalues of the unknown qnantities in the new equation, and then treat the residual as aboYe indicated. In the case of sevtiral new equatiom;, each will furnish a table resembling Table G. If we snp11ose a sixtl1 equation iuvoldng t, it will be necessar_y to constmct a table G((/) with an a!lditional column; aml if there he a seYenth iuYolviug s, there will be a table G(b\ with another additional colnmu. 'l'he number of columns in Table C(a) will be correspondingly increased; but it will Le best at this stage not to extend the list of reciprocals beyond those given in Table O. Colmuns u, t, and s will therefore all be of the same lPngtli, and will terminate with the products furnished by such factors as were introduced by the lai;;t original equation and those in the same line. The sum of the numbers in column 1<, 'l':iule H(11), will then form a side coefficieut between u and I; tlie columns n and tin Table G(/J) will in like manner furnish side coefficients between u and s and between t and s; aud the last column in each table will furnh;h a corresponding diagonal coefficient. There will thus be formed a set of normal equatiom; from which 1c, x, y, and z have been eliminated, and the work may now proceed, :rs shown in Tables A and B. Table .C(n) may then be completed, and a single table like D will determine approximate Yalues of the new unknown quantities and corrections to tl1e old ones. As the absolute t~rms of the former explicit functions ham already lieen disposed of, their places should be left blank in the first line of this table. I regard the f~wilit~- with which new conditions can he absorbed as one of the principal advantages of this methrnl, and hope that it will largel,y if' not entirely obYiate the necessity of partial figure adjustment in the primary triangulation. III.-Order of .~olution. In t,he process of elimination it is desirable to avoid the introduction info an explicit function of an unk11own quantit;.- from wliich the corresponding original equation is free. In line 4, Table A, thl:' Yalnc of :J-' contains tlte unknown quantits y, whicl1 was absent from the second equation. Had the third equation changed places with the first, the terms of the original second equation might have been iutroduced directly into Tahle A, and the number of lines in 'l'able B would have been two less and th<> number of columns one less. The owler of solution in a figure adjustment can be best decided by inspection of the figure. Tlte work should commence with au angle equation from a triangle having a side (or, better, two sides) on the exterior of the figure; and no angle equation from a triangle with a new interior side should ever be introduced till after the entrance, of every angle equation not thus exposed to entanglement wit,h conditions ~-et untouched. A side equation should usually be postponed till after the introduction of all the angle equations that relate to the same points and no others, but should immediately follow them, so as to precede all equa,t.ions that extend beyond its domain into new territory.

IY.-8electfon of angle-equations.
·while it is thus desirable to postJ>one entanglement 'lrith new conditions, it is still better to avoid it altogether, so far as possible, by discarding angle equations· from interior triangles, and retaining iu prefenmce those that lie on the border. The formation, as well as the solution of the normal equations,. is thus considerably facilitated. lt is of' much less importance, but, other things being equal, it is expedient to exclude triangles with small angles, in order to avoid e11tanglement with side equations having large coefficients; and it is also desirable, though of still less importance, to exclude triangles that adjoin small angles, and so have a side common with them.

V.-Treatment of small angles.

In the first two equations the functions of the small angles at Spear and Smith so largely predominate over everything else, aml those of corresponding terms are so nearl,y eqaal that the two equations may be considered approximately identical. The sille coeffir,ient will be about as large as the diagonal coefficients, and an attempt at solution with fact-0rs extendi11g to bnt three signifi. cant figures would not be likely to fornish even an approximation to the values of the nuknowu quantities. .Adding the third equation to the first, and subtracting the second from the sum, the following equation results:

It is evident that if the first, third, and fourth equations are satisfied, the second must also be .satisfied. Hence, the fourth equation may be safely substituted for the second, or, as will easily appear, for the first, ff it be preferred to retain the second.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The fourth equation corresponds to the symbol@ 4. 2. 1, and rnigllt ha\'e been obtained directly in the usual way. The following rule ma;r be deduced for this method of avoitling difficulty with small angles: Choose the pole so as to employ the small angles once, employ them but once, and adhere to the $l!Ue pole. If the line 2 .. 4 had not been obseryed, this method would have been impracticable, and, when practicable, it is sometimes inexpedient, as in this instance. It is desirable to select Tobacco Row as the pole for at least one equation, on account of the small augles in the triangle I. 4. 2. The following method is therefore often preferalile aml sometimes necessar,y. Subtracting the second equation from the first we have-

Thiis e(]uation may be substituted for either the first m the second. It corresponds to the symbol@ 5. 4. 1. 2, and might have iJeen directly ~btained. For this method the following rule may be gfreu : Choose the pole so as to employ the small angles once, and with the same pole form an equation involving all the lh-e stations and a''oidiug the small angleis. It may be useful to notice that the fifth equation involves neither the longest si<le of the srnallangled triangle nor the opposite side of the quadrilateral formed b,y the nou-polar points. If the longest side of the small-angled triangle had been a diagonal of that quadrilateral, both diagonals would have been absent from the fifth equation. Of the two quadrilaterals 1. 3. 4 and r2) 1. 5. 4, the former is somewhat to be preferred, since the latter is worse entangled with the small-augleil side equation havblg its pole at Long, but no great difficulty may be a1>preheuded whichever is chosen. Hespectfully submitted. M. H. DOOLITTLE.

APPENDIX 9.
ON A PHYSICAL SURVEY O.P THE DELAWARE IUVER IN FRONT OF PHILADELPHIA, BY HENRY l\IITCHELL, ASSISTANT.

JUNE

30 1 1879.

Srn; In :submitting the following report upon a physical surveJ of the Delaware River at Philadelphia, I have felt it incumbent upon me to give something more than a compilation of the observations, because the proper understanding and use of the tables by tlie engineer require from 11im a wider view of the subject than this strictly local sun·ey could offer. The general scheme of the sun·eJ·, and the stand-point. from which we have regarded the scene, are revealed iu the introduction t-0 the rC})Ort, aud followed by illustrations of the practical use of the tables, ;is far as 1w1·<>ssary, to indicate their applications to the questions likely to present thcmselns. It is an unusual priYilege to deal with observations entirely trustworthy aml S.' stematically recorded, and I call your special attention to the credit due 1\Ir. II. L. l\Iarindin, the chief of the field party, to Mr. John B. \Veir, his principal assistant, and to Mr. Charles A. I:tusscll, tbe recorder. These three gentlemen, trained by experience in se.veral different riwr surveys whieh we hanJ been called UJ)On to make, not only gathered the data, bnt performed most of the labor iuvolvecl in their reduction to tabular form, &c. The removal of 1\fr. Weir during flle past ,year necessitated the employment of 1\Ir. Edward H. J,iucoln, civil engineer, temporarily. He also had been an observer formerly in our Mississip1>i work, and proved very competent. I think that you will conclude from the report that our methods gradually improve aml become more direct in their application to problems presented in the preservation of channels and the commercial occupation of their banks. Appreciating the continued aml intimate interest you have evinced in the work assigned to us, and the support which you have rendered and obtained for the party in the midst of kard times, I remain, respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL, Co<Ult and Geodetic Survey.

REPORT OF THE

OF THE

REPORT.
Tltc channel.-There are uo elements in the question" of riparian right1' and p1·ivilege:s, whieh gi rn rise to more discussion and contest than the proper location and form of the channel. All are agreed that a common pathway for 11aYigation must he prm;erTed, and all arc agreed that the es15eu. tial drain capacity for riYer waters or tides must be retained. But how far may opposite ishorc. ow1w1·15 extend their "Whan·es r To a certain stated distance from the original i:;horc line; to withiu a certain distance of the line of deepest water; or to that distance which 8hall exclude a g·iven volume~ How shall encroachment be limited to that which will not i1ffolYe iujur,y at timeis offloolls or great tides 1 Iu fine, where if> the essential channel, and what is its essm1tial form! This i1' the r1uestion we liaYe to consider. The actual shore line is among tl1e n10st uncertain contours iu uatnrc, ntryi11g· with cn~ry eltaugc in the elevation of the stream, especially in low countries, and rarely returning to its previous pm;i1ion after inundation. The tltalu:eg, or line of greatest depression, is ali;o an uncertain contour, often difficult of determination l>y soundings because of the general flatuess or the ifrer be1l, aud always disposed to shift where the bed is alluvial. To locate the ehannd properly all its co11to1m; must be taken into the account; it must be treated as a whole an1l 11ot detinctl by its salienfa only. The mctb(){l reached in our yet very imperfect study may be 8btted thus: l''rom the soundings the ordinates of many cross-sections are determined, au<l each proiile is reduced to a smooth figure hy a formula, based upon t.;ype forms, aml fitted to each particular case by 1·oeffieients. The shore lines are thus corrected or reconstructed h.Y eliminating accidental features or mere anomalies, and the normal position of the thal weg is fixell. From the original soundings, or from the ordinates of the corrected cros::;-seetious, the line of mid-area, or the locus of the center of grayit;v, is dekrmiuell and ib; radii of cmTature computeu; ><o that this too may be plotted in smoother cur\Tes if neees8ary. As a rule, howm'er, in alluvial bottoms, the line of mid-ai·ea actually observed presents smooth cun·e,.;, which appear upon the plan in striking contrast with the ragged outlines of the shore, the contmtcd profiles of sections, and the meandering course of the tlialweg. After treating the riYer as an inert mat>s, and deterrniuiug the shape of its mould, as ahoYc i 11<licatctl, it is taken up again as a living stream, and the profile of its forces aml the locus of its flow are determined. The use of the word profile as applied to forces rna:y not appear to have the same ><ignificance as when applied to the transYcrse section, which has a real existence in nature; lmt it is not i111a,qinar11, siuce it may be called into transient existence as a visible form. If a number of appll'>< were to Le simultaneously dropped upon a stream along a transverse litw, the figure which would he given by a line drawn through these npples at the end of one second would he what we l1an· callt·(l the protilc of the forces, and between this profilp of forces and the profile of the ~ction tlwrt> exi::;ts, in alhtYial bottoms, the relation of cause and effect. The transverse profile of force:; will be found to resemble the trnnsversc profile of the bottom, especially if hoth are obserYed at tlw ti111c of on1inaQ· floods, when the flowing water is constmcting its channel. Iu low-water sea:-<ont< or at great floodis the stream is often subservient to or out of regist.er with it; at such timcis tlte loci of mid-area and mid-rolm11c present limes at all sharp bemls antl coincide 0111,Y iu straight n ·adies or at pointo; of reversion. Thl'rn arc ahm in1erYa1s betwe1m tlm loci of mitl-area am] mid-rolume where the river, a:> a, lh·ing bod,Y, has recently shifted its hed and 1o1ot supplied the material for filling up its old chamwl. lu a case like this the. line of mid-area would evidently not represent the course of the channel in any abiding sense, and the liue of niid-Mlume might not yet. be firmly located. 'Ve have here the great source of trouble in meetin~ local questions of jurisdiction and 1iparian title.

Our uu1-wrnttions of currents have not been made during floods nor made simultaneously i11 a lJ the sections at any time; so that while we design to study both cause and effect we inevitably discover tlrnt our acth·e cam·es are not those which produced the entire effects, nor do they faitbfull~ represent in miniature those ca1rnes. For instance, when a stream goes around a bend it is dispoR.e<l to press along the coHcaYe shore, but in those seasons when the stream is strung and at work, tl1i" tendency is greater tllau at seasons of sluggish movement. The line of greatest motion will lie ll('yond the linl:' of grrnllt~st depth where the bend is increasing, arnl by a careful study of the relatiYt> positions of the loci of mid-area and mid-volume one may ascertain whether the de8tructiw· or c011stmctive disposition of the riyer predominates at any point. The form of the cross-section is dependent upon the curvature in the course of the stream~ and where a stream has a ten<lency to increase its bend, the center of the cross-Rection and the apex of its profile will nmrn toward the concave shore at a rate whfoh will var~- wiH1 the i1w-erse radius of curvature of the bend. Form of cross-section.-Thc most casual obserYer may notice that, as a rule, dee1)er watPr is found at a bend than in the straight portion of a stream, and that while the greatest depth lies midway between the shores in the straight re,ach, at bends tlie greatest depth lies nearer the concave shore, and lie nahlrally associates the (lepression and the shift of the thal u·er1 with the cun-atnre of the river. In the practical study of channels it has become our wa.'- to seek first the fnndamental form at straight reaCllCS1 and then introduce into its equation elements of change calculated to COllWrf tl1P cmve of the straight reach into one representing the form of section observed at hPndR, &c. The fumlamental section varies in different soils or where there is a differencl' in the vegt'tation npon the shore, but its profile oscillates, I am satisfied, only from the eurn'l of sinPs to tl1e semi Pllipse-from the cun·e of sines who8e arc is 1.57 times the mean witlth ohsnved (from surfa('.f'. to bottom), and whose maximum ordinate is 1.57 times th~ mean depth (from shore to slwrP) to thP ('lfipse, whose axial ratio is that of mean depth to half mean width. ·with central origin, the expressions for these profiles would he simply (1 ), y = J.;ii 11 cos .r

with limit of x = 1.57 e, and (2) y

= !"!-.; cz c

- :i2, iu which d equals the obsen-ed mean 1kpth and

e equals the half mean chord observed, while c in the second expression is the surface chord or width from shore to shore. The circular arc, lying between tit.ese two cu!ws, may ht· esuntially
represented by (3) y = D (ct - 2 :r ), in which D is the maximum ordinate at origin. c· In practice, the first of thc8e expressions-the sinusoid-is the most com·enient, lwcau8e 110 Ruccessive trials are necessm·~-; the surface chord and the maximum ordinate being computed directly from the mean <lepth and mean chord ob.served; and in (~I) the yalues of D and c may be similarl>computed from the mean elements observed for first trial, the observed surface width being doubtful. _ The main object in view is to replace the obserted fundamental sect-ion by one preseri,ing all -its essential features without its accidental ones. In practice we find tlrnt where there is no curvature in the course of the stream, a Rymmet.rical curve, given hy one of these expressions, fits Yer.'- ni1·Pl.v, except at and very near the surface where banks have been swept away or caved in. Now, the centrifugal force, which would press the current upon the concave shore in going round a bend, would cause the center of gmvity to move toward this shore in the inYerse ratio of the radius of curvature; and, as the volume passing is the same, there is no diminution of area.* To produce this change of the center of gravity, without diminution of area, an element must be inserted, which will reduce one part of the figure and increase the other equall.r; in other wore I,;, on one side of the origin shoaling must be represented, an<l on the other deepening.

constant for equating area-s and other constants to shift positions), arnl many devices become necessar,v iu fitting the compntell to the obserw.d curve, till no recurrent cnrYes appe:u in tl1e residuals. The fon·going is not presente<l as a tlteory of the cross-section, but as a simple and convenient method of generalizing the forms presented. The supposition that there are, in the absence of any Rplit, onl_y two elements in the formula for the profile of cross-section, retaining tlie same refativ:, position, presumes th'.1t tllere is a midway point that does not alter its depth, and tha,t the inclination of the bottom, at this point, is Rimifar (although in revf'rse sense) to that of a railroad going ronnd a bend at uniform grade. In Diagram A the type forms are furnished for tbe cross-sections, as given b,y the simple formulm above mentioned, and a glance at the "Dynamic Charts" (not furnished for publication witll tliis report) will satisf~· you that eYery case present,ed among the forty·SE'Wn sections measured in t.lie Dela.ware falls un<ler one of these theoretical types. · It remains t-0 state wLat practical advantage results immediately from the a11plication of these 01· l>ettt-r formulro which generalize the forms of the sections. 1st. To determine the normal positions of the shore lines an<l tlte tlrnlweg by deducing them .from all the measures of each cross-section. Our earlier method was to smooth out the observed profile of the section by sweeping a line through the irregularities by the eye-the method of "graphical . correction" tliat Dr. Whewcll applied to tidal observations; but a comparison of tllis old method with the one now proposed or a comparison of the curves drawn by any two experts with the old method; Rlwws that personal prejudice is a very considerable element rendering the result by the graphical method almost useless. The mean of mn.ny cross-sections ought logically to give a curve from which mere errors of observation are eliminated, but it cannot furnish the ri1·tual shore-line which is an element in the proper location and allotment of the Port· TITarden line.* 2d. To decide what feature in any cross-section has an artificial origfo or ii:; so recent that the stream has not yet acc_ommodated itself to the change. 3(l. To decide what portion of any cross-section can be improvell permanently hy dredging. A shoal which is an obstruction to navigation mny not be an obstruction to tlie ri\·er, but the rmmlt of a lleposit by the rirnr itself in a space which it has relinquished as it has shifted its bed. In such a case the artificial remo>al would only be a temporary rnlicf to navigation. The application of our formulre to the section as a test, and a comparison with the profile of forces, would in almost every case seem t-0 be entirely satisfactory in determining tlie cl1aracter of an obstruction, whether forced or suffered. 4th. To measure in ad:vance the degree to which any proposed structure woulll injure t11e chan· nd or imlnce change elsewhere. In the second part of this report the result of some efforts to determine the necessary form of the cross-section at several points on the Delaware, before ascertaining the fundamental section, will he found. Some very ugly cases present themselves, in a stream in which ice has played a part which is yet very obscure to us; lmt, on tlle whole, \Ve have been (I submit) as successful as ought t-0 be expected in a first es.say. It may be objected to the elliptical figure that it gives a vertical bank immediately at the shore line, which is unnatural in material that takes a long slope of repose, but when it is considered
~The statutes fixing the position of Purt-W:irden lines ma.ke no provision for their division l1B frontages among riparian proprietors, eac-h of whom is entitled to a right of way to the sea from every foot of his shore. Expeni;ive litigation, ending usually in irery unequ:i;J. j11Btice, hM neceesarily a~nded the attempt to determine a numericaJ re· lat.ion between :m irregular shore and a geometrical curve lying far from it. I proposed, some years ago, and still jnsist, that legisbtnres should provide for the Ctlta.blishment, first, of a "COAtien«otaal" (I now say 11irtva!) shore-line in stated curves and ta.ngent.e, nnd that the harbor-line should be so. dra'Wll, l!Ubseqnently, that ea.ch eootion should contain the interior shore-line curves as factol'B, direct or indire~~,, ·

that this long slope is not an essential condition to the proper flow of the stream, the objection, from our point of view, disappears. The general sclleme of the cro;;;s-se<'tfon, stated ahove, was iucorpo:mted in a foot-note to 111y report on New York Harbor (Ann. Rep. Coast Snrn;,y, lSi'H), since which I haw~ tourul, in the A11nales des Pont.~ et Clwussles, 18()8, an article, h:v M. Farqne, in which he ha,;; attempted to show tlw relations between the course of the thalweg and the bend of the artificial banks of n riv£>r, arnl tn connect them with the radius of curvature. The ol~jeetion to his method lie;;; in Iii,.; reliance upon single contours instead of using all the soundings and treating tile river as a whole. His papp1· involves, necessarily, much mathematical ingenuity; and while his ultimate aim seems to he m1wl1 the same as my own, his line of argwnent is very different. Upon Diagram A I ha,-e plotted the profile of one of the eross-sections observed iu the 8cnthwest Pass of the l\lississippi Rh·er, showing my conception of the three elements of which it was composed, viz.: The fundamental ellipse, the twist due to the hend, and the enlargement.

REPORT OF THE SUPERIKTENDENT OF TIIE THE DELAWARE.

A glance at tlie general chart of "Delaware Bay and River," issued by the Coast Survey, will suffice to sanction the following- }ffopositions, which, as llintH to our inqniries, l1ave been found valnaule: fat. The water-way augments as it approaches the sea, although no important tributary rin;rs PXiRt. '.211. The river1 at first tortuous, unwinds as"it approaches the sea. :111. The channel (Urns distinguishing the main artery) threads its way among shoals, with a disposition, as it approaches t11c sea, to separate into passes like delta riyers. ht aud '.!11. The expansion of the water-WHY in the al>sence of fresh-water trilmtarie1', aud tlie i11c1·eaRe of the radii of curntture iu tl1e course of tile river a,'l it approaches the sea., are both Jrn, to t ltc act.ion of tides mainly. Otl1er t lii11gs t>iprnl, the Rize of a tidal channel through alluviums may l ·P said to \W'.\~ din~ctly as the amom1t of srr\'ice which it is called upon to perform as a condni t, and the increase of tidal volume, between the mouths of the Schuylkill arnl Christiana Creek for instance, fully accounts for the increase of the a\eragc section. Again, the range of the tide heing al1out six feet, a potential !terul to this amount ma;y be Raid to (·xist at ryPr,v point.

·--------------'-------------- - - - - - - - - The :seconu figure of Diagram C illustrates the foregoing table. The area of the section, tH,000 ~quaTe feet, is that for the stage of maximum ebb current; reduced to mean low-tide, it falls to a.bout .51 ,000 square foct. While it must be admitted, from the near approach of this profile to the arc of a drcle that the section is one of economy from a- physical point of view, in the interest of navigation a greate1· width with less. maximum depth would be preferable and seems from an inspection of other sections to be admissible without incurring the danger of a middle ground. In using our formulro for changing widths we haYe simply to regard x and y as undergoing reyerse va1fations, the area remaining the same. As a rule the 1:mrface width of rivers is greater than the law of the curvature of the sectional Jirofile would give, because the waves and rains break down the shore. But in alluvial beds the river at time of freshets oft.en overflows its banks and by this relief suffers the lower portion of the profile of section to reta.in the form impressed npon it under more ordinary conditions, so that the perm.anent portion of the water-way does not represent the extreme demand. It would not seem wise to restrict a river to the dimensions of its minimum section, however perfectly this section may realize the law of economy.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Mr. Marindin has computed for me the average gauge from his eutire field of work, ndernlingfrom Five-Mile l,oint to the moutil of the Schuylkill, and furnisiles tlie followiug: Surface width, 3,645 feet. Mean depth, 19.43 feet. Thal weg depth, 3\J.50 feet. Sectional area, 70,8:!2 square feet. Plane of reference, 1 feet abm-e mean low-water. Comparing these elements with those gi"en in the preYious table for the midway 8ection, we flnu that the wiuth is 50 i·er cent. greater, while tbe mean depth is :!4 per ceut. less, 1Jip tlialwPg depth mueh the same, and the are~ only 13 per cent. greater. One mn:,;t infer from tlw;;P ti;.:·nn·;; that the straight section giYcu in the table bas too small surfac~ width and too great 111ea11 <h·p1 h, while admitting tliat the axeragc surface wicltll is considerably greater than it 11eed lw. .An im;pection of the ch:irt. shows that the majorit.,r of the sections have shallows on oue. side or the other which augment the surface width without an,rLhing like a proportional increase of :,;pction. It. is evident th:tt Mr. Marindin's gauge for the grand average would not yield a s~·nm1Ptrical profile of section, because neither the sine curve nor the ellipse would admit of the coexistence of such elements; but they yield, as might have been expected, the form characteri8tic of a winding river, produced by adding to the siBe curve the sine of double the angle, or to tlie semi-ellipse the Rine of twice the eccentric anglt~.

The avPrag-e :mrfaee witlth of the riYer for tl1e 1iortio11 (within the limit' of onr surn·,Y) al)(n·e tiloncster l'oint is over ~:,ooo feet, wllile at the lower cml of the coursP, i.e., at (~loneestn Point itself, the width Reems 1o ban' hcen naturally less tlmu any other at half tide. \Ve are not now prepared to state wl1at woultl be an adequate mean width of thi3 portiou of Delaware HiYer under a system of artificial embankments or improved shores, becau;;c a very important consideration is to be girnn to the question, How far can the islands in the river be reduced and to what extent can the shoals be removed 1 To nanow the river where now excessively broad, aml Ieave the shoals to the mercy of the temporarily increased fl.ow, would be simply to remm-e the shoals from their present locations i<> points lower down in the pathway of na,:igation, where tht\Y miglit be greater solll'ces of trouble than now. Of course it will be understood that the thalweg depth given by the g-reat average does not imply a 1~011tinuity of tleep water, but it ma;y be said that the average depth of 19! fic~t·t implies the practical:ility of securing a thahrng depth of not less than 30 feet at half tide, and the possibilit;\-, b~- retrenchment and b;\- remoYal of obstructions, of maintaining evcry~here, by the action of the currents, a continnous eham1cl depth a.s great a;; tlte hea>iest mercl1aut-sltips may require. The next tolcral.Jly stmig·ht reach lies between Sections XXXI aml XX \THI, and we may take tilese terminal sections as samples for the reach. A very marked feature in this reach is a middle ground, which, for t.bc upper section, seems to be a continuation of 'Windmill Island. From tile tables that. follow, it will be see11 that, with a fundamental circular curYe whose maximum ordinate i::i 32 to 33 and whose surface chord is 2,200 to 2,400 feet, we have been able to insert a term representing Ycry closely the middle grouwl. A slight bernl can be traced in Section XX.VIII, which becomes marked in XXXI. Between the sections just commented upon occurs a 17 foet shoal, which, I thbk, mm:t ue an obstacle which resists tlie scouring action of the stream. This, and the recently extended ;,;olid structure.s, embankments, &c., on the Pcun:,;~-lvania shore, render the region quite umnanagei1bll:' nI11ler our metl.iod of anal;ysi&-the eftect of the bend being much obscured. I give a computation hy mJ- m<1tbod of Section XXXI V, a.nd a theoretical curve by general formula for the mean of Sections XXXII, XXX:UI, and XXXIV.

One conclusion from tbe foregoing mnst be that the fundamental curve, which bad a depth of tl1irty.1;ix feet at Gloucester, has shrunk to one of thirty feet at Kensingt.-On. At ·windmill Island we have the river completely se1>a.rated into two channels while preRerYing something like its characteristic form of sf'ctiou as a whole. One can easil~' see how Sect.ion XVI c1Pge1wrates into Section XXI as the mi<ldle grouml i·hms to be an island. It is wnrtl1y of notice t.liat i11 tlm eastern cl1a111ml, between 'Vindmill falaml and the New .forsey shorn, tl1e deep watrr is uearrr the west.rm shore, although tl1e local curvatnrr is concave to tl1e eastward; showiug tliat tl1ese two channels retlect in their mold the centrifugal force of the great curve jnst ret~rre·l to.

Wimlmill faland has evidently been an obstruction to which the ri,·er has acconm1odaletl itself, and is not a middle ground lleposite(l voluntarily l>:» the stream. It would be voi,;t->ihle, from the element.\! of this aml oibcr section::;, to predict tile form of l-lection tlia.t would accoum10<.lak the stream in the absence of this obstnrntio11 and one that the stream would preserve. Other examples are abo gin~n of the lllamwr of smootbing· ont. the obsern·cl 11rotile h,r ·lt'IN·mining a formula for it. And here I beg lean~ to repeat that aside from an;\· theory of the essential form of section as represented by formula.>, the adnmtag·e of ascertaining a fitting cmTe for each section lies in determining the essential elements under existing conditions, i. c., the essential s1rrf'ace width, the positions of the virtual s1wre lines aml thalweg, the mean depth and thalweg depth, from all the soundings made, while at the same time eliminating all mere accidents and errors of obserYations. The formula furnishes the type form about which any sectional profile is oscillating and toward which it tends.

APPENDIX No. 10.

METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCHES.
BY WILLIAM FERREL.

PART "II.

ON CYCLONES, TORNADOES, AND WATERSPOUTS.

176

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

CllAPTER I.

THE THEORY OF CYCLONES.
1. In the general motions of the atmosphere, treated of in the first part of these Researches, the disturbing cause is the difference of density, arising mostly from the difference of tempei:ature between tlrn equatorial and polar regions of tlle globe, awl each one of thfl two similar systems of atmospheric circulation arisin~ from this cause, and ha>ing one of the poles of the earth for its center, embraces a whole hemisphere. In the ordinary cyclonic disturbances of tlrn atmosphere the causes are similar, but more local, embracing generall~· a comparatively small part of a hemisphere, and consist in a difference of density arisillg mostl,v from a difference of temperature between some central area and the external snrronmling parl8 of the atmosphere. In the latter case the conditions to be sat.isfied are those expressed by equations (22), Part I. vVhere, however, the part of the earth's surface to which these equations arc to be applied is of such extent only that the whole area may be regarded as a plane, and the. curvature of the surface may be neglected without material error, we haTe the approximate and more simple e.quations of (2.~), Part I. In these latter equations cos </' (sine of the latitude), belonging to the center, is used instead of cos ii, which differs in Yalue between the equatorial and polar sides of tbe cyclone. This makes the equations symmetrical on all sides of the cyclone, when the disturbing cause i8 symmetrical, and com;cqnently simplifies them very much, hut it should be understood that these equations cannot be applied to very large cyclones without C,l)llSiderable error. 2. The expressions of some of the terms of the8e equations may he simplified by adopting the following notation, putting r =the linear distance from the center; u =the velocity in the direction of r ; v =the Yclocity in a direction perpendicular to r on the left; and putting also F,, and F,. for the components of F in the directions, res]lectively, of the velocities u ancl v, we shall then haYe in equations (23), Part I, Du log P' :!!::: D, log P', Du log a' =Dr log a', D,2 u D, u, D,2 Y = D, r, D, u ~~, Fu = F ·· and F,. = F,. If we also assume that a' is a fm1ction of r sim:tlly, or, in other words, that the disturbing cause is symmetrical on all sides, we shall have D.,. log a' = o, and consequently D,. log I" = 0. ·with these changes, by omitting the accent on a', since we for the present assume a to be the same for all altitudes, the equations become

These are the equations of a regular cyclone, symmetrical on all sides, but it must, be borne in mind, that in addition to these equations the cornlition of continuity must also be satisfied, or, in other words, that the motions of the air satisfying these equations must also be such as will not cause a greater or less volume of air to flow into any given space than flows out of it at the same time. This condition is satisfied by gyratory motions with uniform velocities on all sides at the same distances from the center, and is also satisfied by interchanging motions between the internal and external parts of the atmosphere of the disturbed area, i1rovided these are such as to call8e no

'Ve should consequently have tlw baro111etric pressure at the earth's surface equal 0 at the center, and any infinitely thin stratum of e1111al densit.'- and pressure, of an,y altitude whatever in the exterior part, would be brought down to tlw earth's surface near the center at a greater or less distance, according to the height of the st.ratmn in the exterior 1)art, and t.lie rapidity of the gyrations. In the case of a homogeneous fluid without frietio11, since in this mu;e there would be a definite outline or surface, the surface of the earth would be left entire]_}· bare for some 1listauce· from the center of gyrations. It is readily seen from the expressions that iI1 tl1e case of no friction the force which tends to drive the air from the center is mostly the centrifugal force arising from the great rapidity of the gyrations near the center. At the equator, where cos C:· = o, (8) gives v = 0; hence at the equator no gyrations can arise from the. iuflne.nce of the earth's rotation on its axis, and if there are any gyrations there they must arise from initial g;yrations whose angular gyratory Yelocity is represented by v0 in (6). ii. The preceding results 11ave been obtained upon the hypothesis of no friction between the air and the earth's surface, and are independent of any form of the disturbing function contained in the term g h D, a in the first of (1), but are deduced from the last of these two equations upon the a:;snmption simply that there is an interchanging motion between the interior and the exterior parts of the disturbed area, due to any cent1'ipetal or centrifugal forces whatever, and giving a value to u, or its equivalent D, r, in the last of (1). But these results are very much modified in the real case of nature in which there is friction between the air and the earth's surface. We must, however, have in some degree the same kind of gyrations, since friction between the air and the

earth's surface being a function of tlie Yelocity which Yanishm;°when the latter Yallishe:-;, there cau be no friction to resist this telHlenc~· of the air to run iuto tl1csc gyratiom; under the circumstances until there i:s 80111e gyrator,\' motion produce(L But the amouut of the gyratory Yelocity is not now determined by the principle of the preser\'ation of areas, a8 iu the case of no friction between the air and earth's surface, but upon the amount of this frictiou and the force there is to m~erco111e it. From the last of (1) we have in the case of friction (9) F,. + ~ 1 r = - 2 (n cos~·+ ,) ~1 The first member of this equation expresses the friction and the inertia of the air heloug'ing to the gyrat-0ry motion, audit is seen that the force arisi11g from the earth's rotation, expresse<l hy the second mernberofthis eq1mtion, and which oYercomes this friction an<l inertia, requires that 11 shall have a value; that is, that there shall be a motion of the air either toward or from the center, according to the sign of the first member under the circumstances. But thi>; Yalne of u, considered with regard to all Urn part.icles of air, must be such as to satis~,- the equation of continuity, as well as the other conditions of the problem, and as its n1lue m11st depend. therefhre, upon au iut(·rchanging motion of the air between the central and exterior parts of the area of the gyrations, its value must vanish both at the center and the exterior limit, and consequently must become small as it approximates tlrnsc limits. Thl' gyrations, therefore, must vanish at botlt tltese limits a1Hl become small near these limits, especially 'vhere there is much friction. Hence, instead of the almost infinitely great gyratory >elocities near the center, as in tlu~ case of 110 frietion, we ha\·e iu the case of friction between the air and the earth's surface only gyrations of small Yelocit.'~, since there is little force to overcome the frictional resistances to these gyrations on account of the small value of u near the center. ln large cyclones these g·yrations near tlw center beeome insensible to observation over a considerable area, 80 that 1.liere is appareutl,y a perfect calm. The gyrations in this case being so much modifiell by the effect of friction, tlu~ amount of depression of the infinitely thin strata of equal density and pressure and diminution of baronwtric pressure in the central region must be also ycry much modified, so that instead of a Yer.v great diminution of pressure in the central part, and eyeu a Yacuum at the center, we haYe now in general only a comparatively small llecrease of barometric pressure there.. 6. The amount of gyrator.)' Yeloeity, i11 any given case, cannot be determined from the cornlitious, both on account of the uncertainty in the friction constant, and also ou account of the complexity of the problem. There is one important principle., however, from which we rnay make some important deductions with regard to these gyrations, which is, that the sum of the moments itrising from the actions of the g.) ratury motions of the air throug·h friction upon the earth's surfacP, taken for the whole area of the gyrations, must equal O, else these actions would haYe a tendeIH\Y to turn the whole earth around the axis of which the. center of the cydoue is the pole, which we know can only arise from the action of external forces. Since F, is the force required to overcome the friction of the gyrations, if we put :F/ for the value of }<'"at the earth's surface, and let r. represent the surface, we shall ltaYe from thb; principle
(10) ftrrF,.'=0 in which the integration must extend over the whole area of the gyrations. The Yalues of i'', taken for all va.lnes of r, must be such as to satisfy the principle expressed by tlte preceding eqnatio11, aull for any particular value of r, such as to satisfy (9), in which , by (2) is a function of 1·. Fl'{1111 the preceding equation it follows, first, t.hat where there are gyrations in citlter direction iu tlte interior there must at the same time be counter-gyrations on the exterior part; and, secondly, since F,.' is a. fanction which must increase with the gyratory Yelocit;<;, this velocity in the interior g.)Tation.~, where r is smaller, must be much greater than in the exterior counter-gyrations, where r is much greater, unless the area of the interior gyrations, which is not in any case probablP, is much greater than that of the exterior gyrations. \Ve should therefore·conclude a priori, as being at least most probable, that the interior gyrations are much more rapid than the exterior ones. 7.

in opposite directions, the stratum is not affected by frictioIJ, since the two counter actions exactly IJcntralize eacl1 other. If the strata all have the same vcloci(Y i11 the same direction there is no friction, howcYcr great the n·locit.v, e.xcept between the lower stratum and the earth's surface, aml if the relath·e Yelocities between an.\· stratum and the two contig·uous one:,; are the same, the counter-actions of the two (·ontignom; strata exactly neutralize each other, except so far as those actions differ on acl'onnt of a difference of dc1mity and 1)ressnre on the upper and under side of the stratum acted upon. These relatiYe velocities, however, may he such that the intermediate stratum is not affected hy friction, whatever the absolute velocities may he. The velocity of the stratum next the earth'8 surfacP. must be of the same order as the relative velocities of the strata immediately above it, and these relative velocities must decrease with the altitude where the forces actiag upon the different strata are in the same direction, since tbe whole action of the earth's surfaee through f1iction upou the lower stratum is distributed through the strata above by means of friction arising from the ·lifferences of the relative velocities. The ''elocities, therefore, must in general increase witli the altitude most rapidly near the earth's surface, while the relative >"elocities decrease most rapidJs. The friction, therefore, to which any stratum or particle of air is subject i8 generally greater at aml near the earth's surface, where the relative velocities decrease most ra1Jidly with the altitude, and where the pressure is greatest, than iii the upper regions, where the relative velocities of the strata are generallJ small and the pressure less. 8. At and near the earth's surface, where the relative velocities between the strata are greatest we 11uQ· a;;sume that the force required to onrcome the friction, although it depends upon the differences iu the relath·e .-elocities, aud not upo11 the absolute velocities, is sensibly in the same direction aR the velocity relath'c to the earth's surface. If we, therefore, put Ii = the resultant of the component velocities 1i and r, F., = the force in the direction of s necessary to o>ercome the friction, i = the angle hetween ii and v, reckoned from i- toward the left, called the inolinatfon, we 11hall have u = - s sin i, v = 8 cos i, F,, = - I·', sin ·i, .F; = F, cos i; and supposing i to he constant we shall likewise have D,tt. = - D"~ sin ·i, and D,1· = D,scosi.

It is not claimed that the preceding assumptions are strictly correct, and therefore this expression must only he regarded as being a1iproximate, hut as it depends mostl~· upon friction, the effect of which may gcnerall,y be regar·led as being a qmrntit.y of the secoud order, the error will generally he small, and at least tlie principal part of the effect of friction will be taken in.

If we assume r = 1001 "'' and 1: = Ji()km we get n .. c = - 0.8714, or ,; i: = - 0.8714 ii r and hence nearer the center we hiwe a still greater rate of chang·e in the gyratory n·locity corresponding to a given change of r. ln the first case we should La\·e for m1clt kilometer of approximation toward the center, an increase of 0.471,tkrn, and in the last, of 0.87141' 111 in the hourly gyratory velocities. These rates of change in the gyratory Yelocities are much greater than those which usually occur in an;r case of nature, in which the g;rratious are retarded h.r friction. Hence the forces which, in the case of no friction, wotdd produce so great an acceleration of the gJTatory velocities, in the case of friction arc mostly spent in OYercorning the friction. In such cases, therefore, tlte term F,. must be much greater than the term n, r, and corrnequently F, must be much greater thanD,s. 10. Having Rhown that the absolute Yalue ol' D, s is usually Ye.ry small, a11d :tl8o that it is generally very small in comparison with F, at. the. earth'" surface, we can now make from (11) the following important deductions: (a) At and near the earth's stirface, where D, sis small in comparison with F, and especially where it is positive, as in increasing velocities, we have in the northern hemisphere, where cos ,,, is }lositive, tan i also positive, ancl hence the velocit~· sis either iu the direction of thP first or third quadrant, accordiug as the sigu of u is negative or positive, that is, according as the air in its gyrations around the center, is approaching to or receding from the center. Hence in onlinar.Y c.n~lm1e8 there is an inclining of the direction at the earth's surface from the tangent toward tlu· center on the left, and the amount of inclination is nearly in proportion to tl.te amount of friction. In the southern hemisphere the inclination is to the right of the direction of tLe tangent. (b) Since, ac,'Cording to§ 7: F, is greatest at the surface of the earth for the same value of s, and diminishes with the altitude near the surface, so the value of i is greatest at the surface aud diminishes with the altitude, and therefore the gyrations are more nearly circular at some diRtauce from the .earth's surface than near the surface. (c) Toward the center of a cyclone where the gyratory angular velocity is great on account. of the smallness of r, aml where consequently the value of v in the denominator in foe expression of tan i is great, the value of i, everything else remaining the same, is in general smaller than at greater

distances from the center, where r is larger, and consequentl;y " smaller. The gyrations, therefore, near the center are more nearly circular than at a great distance from the center. The greater the velocit,v also, en~rytlting else remaining the same, the smaller the i11clinati011. (d) Since n cos·' becomes small near~ and vanishes at, the equator, so the value ofi, all other circumstances remaining tlie ;;ame, increases with tlic deerea8c of latitude, and at the equator where cos ·;· = o, and where also ~vanishes, it becomes either 900 or 2700, and the motion of the air is either exactly toward or from the center, and there are no gyrations. (e) 111 tl1e npJler regious of the atmosphere where there is not much friction, the inclination or deviation from the tan,!.rent i.'i small wherever the gyratory velocity is considerable, and as the motion of the air iu ordinary cyclones is towarcl the center below it must be frorn it above. Hence tlle g~Tations at high altitudes must be nearly circular but incline a little from the tangent. 'l'his must be especially the case at medium altitudes, and at all altitudes near thti center, since the radial motion either toward or from the center is small. (f) Iu a cyclone increasing in dolence the term D, s, (11) taken for any given place, and so regarded a.~ a function of the time !'limply, is positive, but in a cyclone decreasing in violence, it is negative; hence the effect of this term in tlie former case is to increase i, and in tlle la.tter to decrease it, but on account of the smallness of thh; term, as shown in the preceding section, its eftect must generall.r be small. 11. From (11) we get Fu+ D,u = 2 (n cos'/'+") utan l. '\Yith this expression of Fu + D, u substituted in the first of (1) we get, hy putting for u and r their equintlcnts - s sin i ands cos i, (1:.!)

If, therefore, i· is positive, a:s iu the northern hemisphPre, the sign of 'U must be m"gative, that is, the radial com1)0I1ent of motion must be tmf'ard the center. hut i11 the exterior g;rratious where v becomes uegative the sign of u must be positile, that is, the radial component of motion mm;t be from the center. We see, therefore, that in the northern hemisphere the interiorg~·ratiom; at the earth's surface are positive, tbat is, from right to left, and the air at tht' Rarne time app1·oaelwi;; tlu· center, so that the gyrations are in a spiral around and toicard the ceuter, hut the extnior g,natiom; are ill the contrary direction a111l the air ftowR from the center, so that the gyration& an> aromul and from the center. Since the maximum preHRnre is where the gyrations are re\·ersed. the air flows out from beneath the area of high pressure, on the one lland t-0ward the center, and on tllc otl1er han<l from it, and at the :sauw time gsrates around the center, The directions of motion of the air at the earth'R surface, af; indicated hy the solid arrows, and the circular i,.,ohars are represm1ted in Fig. 1. In the southern hemisphere, the gyrations a,re all re'\"ersed. For reasons already giveu in § fl, the interior gyrations are ge11emlly by far the most rapid, and from a mere inspection of (13) it is readil~· seen that, these produce by far the g-reateHt effoct up011 D, log P, or, iu other words, upon the barometric gradient, since y there become:> mucli greater for the same value of 1'. TheRe i11te1·ior gyrations, therefore, awl their pffects upon b~Lometric pressure, are often alone ohserYed, while the comparatin·ly rnoderatf' g.Yrations of the extnfor part aml th1?ir small effect upon the barometric pressure often pass nu noticed, e.~pecially on land where there are a great many disturbing caui;;es to interfere \Yith tlH· deYelopmPnt of a 1·pgnlar am! completC' <·yclone. The former gyrations form the cyclo1w proper, and thP latter the anti-cyclone. Hence, erffy epclonc is accompanied by a corre.Yponding anU-cy<Jlone, and tht' forriwr cmmot e.ril<f 1ritlw11t the latter. 13. The preceding results with regard to cycJones, deduced from the mathe111atieal expressions, may be. made more intelligible t.o many hy means of a more popular demonstration or explanation of them, based upon certain well-known principles. Tlie iusta11ta11eoui;; motion due to the earth's rotation on its axis, of any part of its surface except the equator, and s;o small that it may be regarded as a plane surface, ma.'' he resolved into two varts, one of translation, and one of gyration around tlte the center of the area under consideration. At the J>0le8 of tlw Barth it is readily seen that this gyratory motion is the 1mme as that of the earth's rotation on its axis, and tlmt at the equator it must vanish. For any intermediate latitude it is expressed by 11 cos C:·, or n muJt.i. }llied into the sine of the latitude. If now, for any reaso11 whatl've1\ th··r(' j,., k(·pt np a continued interchange of the air betweeu the central aml exterior part of this area continually gyrating around its center in consequence of the earth's rotation, it will he nnrlers;tood by most persons tllat, by tlte principle of the preserrntion of areas, the afr of the interior part of tlti8 area will recein~ a gyratory motion around the center, relati·e to the earth's surface, in the same direction in whidi the area comprising the atmosphere under consideration is turning hy virtue of the earth's rotation, that is, from right to left in the northern hemisphere, and the contrar;\' in the southern, and that the gyrations of the exterior part of this area mm~t be coutrar;rto those of the interior part. These gyrations, especially near the center and the exterior limit, would he ,-ery rapid if ii were uot for the friction between the air and the earth's surface. This frictional re8iHtance prevento; in a great measure the rapidity which the gyrations would otberwise ha,·e, but there must necessarily be some gyratory motion, as in the case of no friction, since without some such motion frictional resistance would not be brought into action. If we now bear in mind the well established principle that wherever a11y lmd.v or particle of air moves in any direction over the earth's surface, there is a force arising from the earth's rotation on its axis which tends to deflect it to the right in the northern hemisphere, and tlw contrary in the southern, it is seen that, in either hemisphere, there is a force arising from these interior gyrations and the earth's rotation which tends to drive the air from the center and cause a minimum pressure tlere. The exterior gyrations being in the cont.rar.r dil'ectiou, of course tlti:s force is, in this case, in the contrary direction, that is, toward the center. These two forces, then, depending upon the interior and exterior gyrations, both press the air toward the place where the gyratory

velocity Yanishes and changes sigu, and cause a maximum barometric pressure there. Of course only the g_yratory component of motion is here considered. \Yhen there is also a radial component, the deflecting force arising from the earth's rotation is required to overcome the frictional resistance to the gyrations, and so. when there is no friction, no radial component is necessary and the gyrations may he entirely circular. In additiou to this force depending upon the earth';; rotation there is, likewise, the centrifugal force due to the gyrations. This force is of course from the ce11ter in both the cyclone and anticyclone, and heiwe in the former it is com bincd with that depe11ding upon the t>arth's rotation, but in the lattt>r in the coutrar;\· direction, and in somH measure counteracts the force arising from the earth's rotation. Tlie centrifugal force, howevr,r, in the ant.i-cyclo11e is very small, both on account of the small ,-elocity of gyration and the distance from the center, but in the cyclone, very near the center, it may be much the gTeater of the two forces. Since the amount of gyratory motion aritiing from the interchanging motions of the air between the interior and exterior parts depends upon friction, and the less the amount of friction the more nearly these gyrations approximate to what they would lm in the case of no friction, these gyrations, especia1l~y tlrn initial ones, must be much more rapid in the upper regions of the atmosphere, where there is comparafrrnly little friction, than near the- earth's surface where the friction is very much greater. Hence the accumulation of air with its maximum at the dividing line between the cyclone and anti-cyclone, as already explained, is due at the start mostl;\· to the gyrations in the upper 11art of the atmospl1ere, aml the pressure from this accumulation tends to force the air out from beneath on the one side toward the center of the cyclone ancl on the oth<·r toward the outer limit of the anti-c_yclone. The tleflective force, 110\Y, arising from these radial motions, as explained above, aids in overcoming the greater friction of the gyrations near the earth's surface, but these latt.er gyrations must not lw so great that tlie force pressing· from both sides toward the place of maximum pressure wonld preYent the outfiow on both sides below, else tlte deflecting force then which overcomes the rPsistances to the gyrations would be cut off. According to the preceding reasoning and explanations, therefore, wherever there are disturbing causes to produce an interchanging motion between the interior and the exterior parts of the clisturhe<l atmospliere, from the principle of the preservation of areas, and the forces depending upon the eai1h's rotation, there are uecessaril,y interior gyra.tious of the air in one direction and countergyrations in the exterior part. and a region of high barometric pressure with its maximum at the dhidi11g line between the two kinds of g_yrations, and a flow of air at the surface from the region of high pressure, on the one side tmv:Jrd the center, and the other toward the outer limit of the anti-cyclorw, wl1ich, combining with the g_yratory motions, gives rise to a spiral motion in the interior around and toward the center, and in the exterior part around the contrary wa,y and from the centN, just as hati been deduced from the preceding mathematical expressions. 14. From (13) and (3) we get, by putting P' = 0.76'", 2ncos11+v s P (14) . D p = ("OS i ( 1.00154 + .004 t) . 103070 . P' in which sis the velocity in meterIS per second.

except that the temperature correction, here given in the expression of G, was there simply referred to in the text, but tile gradients and units of measure ltere used are different. Two years before tliis, Mr. Pesliu, mining cuginN.\r at Tari.Jes, }'ranee, had ohtai11ed relations substantially tlie same as the preceding, except the eft'<cct of friction coutaiued iu the term cos i, which in the case of no friction becomes uuit_y ." According to the theorr t!Jis effect become!'! eopecially large towards the equator, arnl it will be shown from obser\·atiou that iu all latitmles the eifoct is very considerable, and that where the angle i is uot ohserYeil, the theoretical relatiou a hove is not confirmed by observation, exce11t upon tLe hypothesis of a large value of i, arnl co11se(1ue11tly of a large effect due to friction. The fundamental eq1rntions from which the relation of (16) has bee11 obtained, except so far as friction is concerned, were iirsr gh·eu by the author i11 a papn in Runkle's :Mat11ematical Mouthly in 185!1, equations (38). At that timt· the t"rm "gradient'' wa1' not in mie. By expressing the altitude 7t in these equations in terms of the barometric prestmre P of tLe preceding eq nations, and applying the friction terms, as abo\·e, and introduciJJg the barometric gradient instead of the differeutial coefficieut, the relations above are readily obtai11ed. Tlie yalue of cos i in (Hl) depends upon the amount of friction, and hence must be obtained from observation, and when friction nrnishes we Imm cos i = 1. Since (11) i:,; strictly applicable only near the earth's surface, and this equation has been used in obtaining (1:1), the expression of G is strictly applicable only at and near the earth's surface; but the error at a distance above the surface is only in the effect of friction, and since friction is small there, and the gyrations more nearly circular than at the earth's l'mrface, for considerable altitudes we can put cos i = I, and with thii> value of cos i this expression of G i" itpplicable to these altitudes without material error. The coefficient oft iu the expression G is such as to iuclmle in the temperature correction that also for the aYerage amo1rnt of aqueous vapor, taken over the earth geuerally, and tLe balance u1ay be neglected.

The preceding results so far are all indeperulent, of any particular form of the expre8sion of t, regarded as a function of r, since the term gh D, u. in the first of the fumlamental equations (1), w bicb alone contains t, docs not enter into nn:v of the preceding expressions. lt l1as merely been a,,;sumed that there is a disturbing force of some form to kee,p up au interclrangiug motion between tlie i11t1,1ior awl exterior portions of tLe air oYer a given area. It is readily seen from an inspection of equations (1) that if D,- a = O, that ifi, if t ht tlu; expression of,, (2) is iudepeudeut of r, the equations in the case of friction are satisfied with u = 0 and 1: = O, tltat is, with a state of rest; for if there were initial motio11s they would soon he destroyed by friction. Tht· interchanging motions, therefore, necessary to keep up the gyration,,; of the c.vclone depend upon a variatio"Q of t at difforent clistanees from the cm1ter. It becomes now important to ascertain the effects produced by different functiouR oft entering into a in tlte term of yh D, u.. This ean be <lone oul,r a,p1n·oximately on account of tlw m1certai11ty of tl1e friction terms. It ha,,; been shown that both the friction terms, and those expressing the inertia, of the air, are generally small iu comparison with those depending upon the earth's rotatiou and with the centrifugal force arising from the gyrations where r is small, so that these terms may be neglected without much error, in obtaining approximate results.

In the ca!>e of a cyclone with a cold center the revernc takes place, the general interchanging current of the lower p:1rt of the air being ge11c>mlly dimini8hecl or even reversed 11ear the earth's surface in the cyclone but i11creased iu the anti.cyclone. Equation (28) has been obtaiued upon tlw hn1othesis tliat F" antl D, u in tlle ilr;,t of (1) may lJe neglected in comparison with the terms ari8ing from the effect of the earth's rotation and the centrifugal force of the gyrations.

According to (28), (r'-v) is positive where C is positive, and is in proportion to the altitude h.

In the case of an ordinar.r cyclonic system the directions of the currents in the upper regions are rt>preseuted by the duttell arrows in :Fig. 1, in which the anti-cyclonic gyrations above are suppose1l to ovPrlap a considerable part of the cyclonic gyratious at the surface.

Ileuce at all altitudes, as well as at tlw earth's surface, the maxirunm barometric pressure is where the gyrations are reversed, so that in a, cyclonic sy:,;tcm with a warm center the greatest pressure, at a considerable altitude, may be n·ry nt'ar 01· e\·pn at tlw C(~ll1f'r, arnl the pressure decrease thence to the outer limit of the anticyclorw, althouirl1 at the earth's 8urf'aC'e there ma:-· he a low minimum barometric pressure at the ceuter.

Tlte thicknesses of the strata bounded by surfaces of equal pressure are therefore greater in the rarefied celltral 11art than in the more dense exterior part, but so far as we-ight or pressure at the l~arth'>; Rmofaeo art' concerned, the rarefaction at the center is exactly compeusated h_y the greater thicknesses of' the strata, ;.;o that the pressure P' at t!Je earth's surface is Pntirt>ly irnlP1wndm1t of the temperature g:radieut, arnl depends ouly upon the amount of gyratory ,·p}(wity r' at tb(· earth's surface, as 1-1lww11 hy (13), aud upo11 friction as affecting the value of cos i. lu a eyelonic system with a cold ceutpr we lmYe the reverse. .At the earth's surface the anticyclonic gyrations give a. negative ~radieut, accorcling to (lG), but at a certain altitude, where all the g~Tatious ma~- l>eeome cyclonic~, the gradient i8 pos1tiYe from the c<~nter to the outer limit of the anti cyclo11e, so that the pressnre at that altitmle i:; a minimum at the center and a maximum at the exterior limit.

In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 is gi\·eu a graphic 1·epresentation of the gyrator:y velocitieR of cyclones at the earth's surface, ~tnd of tlw rel ationt' he tween tliese and the gyratory velocities at any al titnde above the imrfa0e, together with the forms of the correspoJ](lillg barometric cun·es of a st·ctiou passing through the center of the cyclone. ThP former lwloug,; to a c,n:lone with a warm center, in which the cyclonic gyratory \·elncities are dirninbhed ahon', aml tlie latter to a tycloue with a cold ceuter in which the rtwerse takes phwe. The co-ordhiateis of the unbroken cun·ed lines perpendicular to the radius, as indicated 1l,Y the arrows, re11reRent the gyratory \'elocities at tlle earth's surface, represented by c', and the corresponding cnn·etl lme of tile same kiml in the upper :part of the figure represents the barometric cunre of pre1;sure at the earth's surface. The maximum of pressure is at the distance at which the gyratory Yelocitirno; vanish and d1a1q.,:·e sigus, as already shown. In like manner the perpendicular cu-ordinates of the dotte!l curnid line.,; show the gyrator.r 'Telocities at some altitmle ahon· the earth's surface, greater or lei;;;,, accorcling to tlie temperature gratl.ient,, antl. tl!e correspoulling dottetl cnrve(l line in the uppt.·1· part of the tignre represents the corresponding barometric curve. ln this ease, alRo, the maximum of barometric pressure is at the distance at which the gyrations ,-:111ish and chauge sigmi, which~ in the cyclone with a warm center, is nearer the center, and in the one with a eold center further from the center than in the case of the gyrationis at the earth'" surface. Eitlier the altitude or the temperature gra<lieut, or both, might he so great as to make tl1e gyratory velocities and the co-or(linates representing them all negatiYe in the cyclo11ic sy:;;tem "ith a warm center and positini in the one with a cold center. The maximum of the curves then representing the harometric pressure at a considerable altitude would be at tile center in the former case and at the outer limit of the anti-cyclone in the latter. 20. Accordi11g to (28) the gyratory velocities of a cyclone with a warm center 1lecrease as the altitude h where U, and couseqmmtly the tempt~ratnre grmlient, are the sanw at all altitudes. But since the frictfon terms were W'glected in ohtaini11g ('.:!8) it is only apvrnximate, and 11ear the earth~s surface wllere friction is great but rnpidl)· diminisl1es with the altitude, the g,n·ator:v >elocitics increase with the altitude much more rapidly than at greater altitudes where the amount of friction is small, and where, conse(]Ueutly, the Yelocities mm;t ha,·e nearly the relations giYen by (28). If instead of using the first of (1), ueglectiug the friction and inertia termR, we had used (13), putting

and since at

and near the earth's surface cos2 i' is much less than cos i at some altitude ab°'·e, since i increases with the amount of friction, 1: 1 , in on1e1· to satisfy the coll{litions wbere friction is considered, must increase with the altitude more rapidly near the earth':; surfhce than at considerable altitudes. But for the reason that these gyrator_y velocities in comparison with those above are less near the surface than is required to satisf'.y (28), the force which arises from these gyrations and tends to drive the air from the center is much less there, and consequently the air flows in toward the center with much greater facility than at higher altitnde8 where the gyrat-0ry velocities are much greater. The velocity, therefore, of inflo~ toward the center is much tile gTeatest near the earth's surface, while the maxi111um velocity of the gyrations is at a greater altitude. The directions, therefori>, of the currents in the lower strata of a cyclone must be more inclined toward the center than at a \'cry moderate altitude abO\'e the surface, as is likewise shown by the greater value of i near the earth's surface, as deduced from (11) in§ 10 (b). If au observer at the earth's surface, therefore, stands with his face toward the wind of a cyclone, the currents, and likewise the directions of the clouds, at some altitude abo,·e him, must be from some point of the compass at his rig1lt lmml i11 the northern hemisphere, and the contrary in the southe,rn, and at very great altitudes, as in the region of the cirrus clouds, where the g;rratory velocities are mnch lei's in the case of ordinary cyclones, and may even be reversed, and where t11e radial motion is outward from the center instead of toward it, these directions may vary so much that they may seem to cross one another at right angltis, or even to be somewhat counter to one another. The directions of motion in the upper regions are indicated by the dotted arrows in Fig. 1. The area of cyclonic gyration;;; aIHl also their velocities here, according to what precedes, is mneb diminished, and those of the anti-cyclone much

increm~ed, es11ecially at Yery high hltitudes, aml the diYidiug line between the cyclonic and anticydonic gyrations much uearer tlH· center. The i11teriol' part of tl1e upper anti-cyclone consequently overlaps the extC"rior 1mrt of the cyelone below, and over tllill reg·ion the directions of motion of the air ahonl aud lit>low are very nearly or quite in opposite directions. 21. So far we ban' regar<leil the area of cyclonic distnrhauce, arnl likewise the g_yratio11s, as having a 1lefi11ite circular limit with the radius U. In the case of nature, however, this is not the .case, hut the i::·:uations of the anti-cyclone, hy means of friction, are continually bringing into circulation, both gyratory and Yertical, new porti011ll of tlie surrounding air, hy which the area of gyrations is enlarged, and, in co11sequence of the correspoudiug enlarged vertical circulation, the area of tl1e temperature gradient is also enlarge<l in somewhat the same manner. AR the area of the gyral ions is eularged the condition Pxpressed by (10) must still be satisfied, which will in geueral rc,1uire that the cyclone and anti-cydoue Loth enlarge simultaneously. 'l'here is, however, evidently a. limit iu all cases beyond which the power of the eyclone cannot extend, or at least make itself ;;ensibly felt. 22. If we regard C, and consequently the temperature gradient, as a function increasing or <lecn'asi11g wiU1 tlte time, as it generally is, we somewhat change the conditions of the problem as treated so far, hut the effects depending upon this change are so small that it is not worth while to enter into the consideration of them here. 'Vhile C is increasing of course tlie whole activity of the cycloue must increase, and this introduces a change in the amount of inertia to be overcome hy the fon·es, so that the term D, s, arnl the componeuts D, u, and D, i~ entering into tlw fundamental equatin11s, taken either positi·el,Y or uegatiYely, must increase as C increa.ses, and inversely, but as C generally clmnges Yery slowly with the time, and the amom1t of force necessary to overcome the inertia of the air in auy ortliuary rate of increase or decrease of vdocitics is ,·ery small, (§ 9), the conditions of tlte problem, and ~·ll the results, may be regarded at any instant as being sensil.Jly the same as if C were constant. "~hile C is increasing the wl10le activity aud the area of the cyclones are increasing, but the latter for reasons giYen aboYe, and not on account of the increase of U, so that the area continues to enlarge while C decreases, and although while C decreases the velocities are being gradually dirninis]1("l by frictiou, aml as C nwishes these velocities also vanish, yet the area of the cyclones is not thereb~· dimiuis1w<l 1 but rathPr e11larged to the last. 2:l. B,\ mu1pariug the f'nndamental equations (1) of a cyclone and the results deduced from them, in the precediJJg pages, with the equations of the general motions of the winds, and the resultR <leduceil from tl1em, in Part I of these Researches, it is seen that they are similar in the two cases, those of tile general motions of the atmosphere differing a little from those of a cyclone, and its acco1111ia11yiug anti-cyclone, 011 account of the greater extent of the earth's surface included, arnl the 11pmssit,v, tlierdill'e, of taking into accouut the curvature of the earth's surface instead of regarding it as a plane surface, as in orClinary cyclones. The two systems of winds, therefore, belonging- to the northern and southern hemispheres of the globe are simply two great cyclonic systems wit11 a cold center, haYiltg the cold poles of tlie earth for their centers. The motions of the air eastward around aud toward the poles, in the middle latitudes, giving rise in those latitudes to tl1e normal southwest winds i11 the northern, and northwest winds in the southern hemisphere, form the cyclones, arnl the trade-wind region the corresponding anti-cyclones, with the equatorial calm-bdt for the common limit of the two srstems. The tropical ca.lm·belt and corresponding maxima of liarnmetric pressure near tl1c parallels of ao 0 correspond to the similar calm and dh·iding line between the cyclone and anti-c,vclone in tlte onlinary and smaller cyclonic systems. The meau-temperaturn gradients of the northern and southern s,rstems are about the same, but since there is much more land in the northern than in the southern hemisphere, and consequently the resistance to the gyrations of the atmospbere around the globe from mountain ranges and the inequalities of laml surfaee generally is much less in the latter than in the former, the southern cyclonic system is the more ,·iolent of the two, so that the barometric depression below the mean is much greater at the south than at tlte north pole, and the mean position of the equatorial calm belt is a little north of the equator.

During the winter of the northem ltemi:s1)here, the temperature gradient of the northern cyclonic system ill much greater alHl that of the t'>Outheru somP less than the mean of ''inter and summer; ltence at the former time the YioleueP of the northern "~·stem is much greater m;d that of the southern sorne less than the mean, aml tlw equatorial arnl tropical calm-belts are drh·en south of their mean po:sitious. In the su1111ntir of the nol'tLern hemisphere t11e n·yerse take:-; place, an<l the position:-; of these calm-belt<i is a little north of their mean position,,. Hence there i:s a regular oscillation of these calm-belt8 and of the whole 8)-stem, with the cl1ang-es of the seasons. In § lG it has heeu asl'lumed tlrnt tlie fnuction expre:ssing- the temperature npou which the disturbance of static equilihrin111 and th{~ nrnintPIJanct~ and ad i\'ily of lht> l',H~lmws tll'pend is of the form of (24). Of course the rt·al forms of tliis function in nature an· generally only rough approximations to this, which has been asl'lumed in order to simplif,\- the problem. Tl1e results, therefore, which lia.vt; heeu olltai11e1l upon this asi'.umption are not strictly sueh as an· u;.:uall,\observed in nature, and the~- cau only he used in a gener<tl explaimtion of the pheuoawua observed, or in tlie compariso11s of tlwor.r with obsen'atio11 where we han; the a\·1·rages of great nmnhers of observations, from which the eft'ecb of abnormal distnrhances and irregularitie::; are eliminated. 24. There are several causeH which produce variations of temperature in the atmospliere, wliich may he dh-ided into primar~· and secondary. The first giYe riSl' to the initial cydonic motions of the air, and the latter can rn1ly come 111to l·lay af'tPr these iuitial motio11s take plaee.

After the c,vclouic disturb<wce due to the primary cause::; lias ouee set m, a11d asceudi11g and descendiug currents are produced, tl1e temperature of the air iR decreaRed in some parts b.r expan_ sion in ascendfllg, and increased in others by compresl'liou in descem1ing:. aud when the ascending currents are saturated with aqueous vapor the temperature is increased by tlw latent caloric of the vaiJor set free in its condewsation hy the cold of expa11sio11 iu the a:sceut of the air.

The condition of' initial motion toward the center at or near the eartli'::; surface, and cousequently of ascending currents in the interior of the cyclone in tLe lower strata, is tliat the first member of this equation taken :it or uear the earth's surface sltall be negati.-e, or, in other words, that Dr P' shall be posith·e, P' representing the barometric pressure there. After the initial motions the ttirm in the first of (1) depending upon i;, which was neglect~tl in ohtainiug (2!1), hegi118 oo have a value rn the origination of the cyclone; but this is only a modifYinp: force depending upon the earth's rotation and the centrifugal force of the gyratiom;, and eaunot uecomc so gTeat as to destroy and change the sign of tbe first member of (2\J), else tlte radial motions would become reversed without, any change in the temperature conditions upon which the,r depend. The cmidition of ascending currents, therefore, in the interior of a cyclone in the lower strata is that D, P', regarded aM a function varying with the temperature only, or rather with the density, for this depends also slightly upon the amount of aqueous vapor in tlte air, shall be positirn.

It is seen from this table that J,, the rate of diminution of temperature in m;ccnding saturated air, is mucl1. lPss than in the case of mi;saturate<l air, wl1ich is 1° for each 100 meters of ascent. This tlitference is due to the latent caloric set free in tbecon<lensation of the Yapor, and is especially large in warm summer temperatures, when, as seen in the last 1mrt of the table, the amount of aqueous yapor is comparatiYely 'Very great. Hence tile free caloric arising from the condensation or the vapor forms a Yery important part in tile preceding conditions of (32) after the ascending cnneuts ha\·e once set in, and likewise in the power of the cyclone, as seen from the expression of l>,, P 1, npon which this power depernls. In descending currents saturated air at once becomes 1111saturated, and hence we ha\·e in this case d,, = 1°, as in ascending currents of nnRaturated air. 1f J,. at all altitudes is gr(>ater than .d in the case of an ascending current, then ( J, - J,,) is negative for all altitudes, and the cowlitions of (:32) and (:1~~) are satistie<l in tbe case of W" - 11 ,,) = 0; t llat is, in the case of no primary disturbance of temperature, prO\'ided tha,t, al'cemli11g or descending- currents, lwwerer slight, are once generated by any small instantaneous impulse or te1nporary cause of disturbance; for the initial value of Jc being the same as J as soon as the vertical current, eit11cr ascendi.ug or descending, sets in, the value of J, = J,, at the start approximates to the value of J,, in au ascending or descending current, and consequently becomes less than J,, at all altitudes, and the conditions of both (:'~2) and (a.~) are satisfied with t 1, - t',, = 0 for all altitudes, and this eontinnes so until by a partial or complete inversion of the atmos11here, or from the action, meanwhile, of the primary causes of disturbance of temperatnre, the value of J,, in the surrounding parts comes to 1H1Ye a value equal to or less than that of Jc in the case of ascending currents, after which th(' conditions are no longer satisfied with (t',, - t'") = o, and all motion ceases. If the first impulse from the instantaneous or temporary cause is upward in the central part of a given area, then the currents will continue to ascend in this central part to the top of the atmospliere, and consequently to descend gently in the surrounding parts, and the currents will be toward the center below and from it abo\"e; but if the first impulse is downward in the central part the vertical and horizontal motions will all be reversed. The state of the atmosphere in wliich (32) and (33) are satisfied with (t', - t'u) = 0, after the temperature disturbances are callerl into play by any instantaneous impulse~ is called the state of un.~table equilibrium. If J" is greater than 1° in the case of unsaturated air, or than the values giYeu in the preceding table in the case of saturated air, we have this state of unstable equilibrium, but in the latter case the primary instantaneous impulse must be upward.

ease of 8aturatt~u air than iu that of UU8aturateil air, aml this ii;; ei:;peciall~· the casP for warm temperatureio; and at great altitmles, as is seen from tlrn preceding tahle. }'or a krnpe.rnture of mr it is only necessar,'I· that J" should be greater than 0°.38. In order to ha Ye the state of unstable equilibrium it is not necessary to ba,·e J g1·eater tha11 LJ,. for all altitudes, hut merel.r that there should be a p1·eponderance of sud.1 \alues, and mostly in the lower prrts of the atmosphere, so that,!, (J, - J,,) shall IJe negative. If this be the case for the lower Htrata only of the atmoHpltere, and for all tLoi'ie ahon·./: ( J. - JJ should he poHitin~, then the ascendiug current would not ascend to the top of tlw atmosphere, and the couditiorn.; may he such that they will ascent! only to a moderate height when the air will moYe out from thP center to supply the inflowing currents below. 27. It is seen from (30) that a state of unstable equilibrium in the lower strata onls of tl.te atmos1)here has little effect in pruduciug a cyclone of large extent with ascending or £1e;;cendiug currents extending to the upper regions of the atmosphere, on account of the short extent of tl1e integrations with regard to lt in the expression of DrP', upou which the power of the cyclone depends, and also on account of the large 'ralue of U, in a large cyclone, for thii,; sliowt< that tl1e temperature gradient and power of the cyclone are inYersel:v as the extent of tl1e tempMaturc <listurh· ance, tile difference of temperature between the center aml the external part remaining the i:;a.m£'. [f' J were 80 much less than L1 that the iwerage of ( J, - .1 for a stratum of l,OUO meters in de,pth were 90, the effect would onl,ybee'lual to ahout a<lifferen~e of1° iu (t', - t',,); that is, toadifl:erence of 1c between the central and exterior part of the area of temperature disturbauce arising from tlie primary causes, and extending to the top of the atmosphere. But this is au extreme assumption; for the atmosphere most probably never becomes jn this state to the height of 1,000 meters, eYen when thl' difference between J, aml J., is Yery small; and when·, there, is a very rapid diminution of the temperature with the altitude, and consequent!~· .:J, is large, the height to which such a state Pxteuds must generally be small, and this only in cases where there ha,·e been no dist11rbances of the atmosphere from the primary causes for a considerable time. 'l'he state of unstable equilibrium occurs mostly at some distance aboYe the earth's surface, and in the case of saturated air; since in this case the diminution of temperature with altit1Hlt', or \·alue uf J.,, required is much less, especially in the summer sea.Rem, as is seen frurn Table I; uut in order to have the air saturated, it is necessary that there shall ha\e been first an ascending curre11t long enough to cool the air dowu to the dew-point, and this can only anse from the disturbances of temperature due to the primary eauses. But after this has once taken place, if the Yallw of .J, is less than the Yalne of J,. in Table I, we haYe a state of unstable er1uilibriurn, since the condition of (:1'..!) would be satisfied if t',. were equal to t',, taken iu the lowest, saturated stratum: and if the npward currents were. to cease at the time of 1·eaching saturation, any iwstantaneous upward i rnpulse would briug J,. to htl"e a less Yaluc than J,,, and this would continue a::; long as tlw air could be kept saturated at any ginm altitude by means of the ascending currents. ~Yhere (t', - t'J has a finite value, either positiYe or negatfre, the primary causes combine witl1 1l1e secondary causes of <listurbance in the stale of uustable e11uilibrium; and where the state of the ittmosphere only approximates to tl1is unstable state the conditions of (32) and (33) can still lw satisfied if the amount of primary 1hsturba.ucc of temperature (t',. - t'.,) is sufficiently grc>at; but it may be such only that it is entirely counteracted. by the, disturbance of tem1wratnre from the iowcomlaQ" causes after the motions upon which these depend ha,·e once set i11, so that in such a case there can be but little atmospheric disturba.ncc. 28. If we knew the Yalue of .J, and J" for all the strata of the atmosphere, and also the amom1t of primary temperature disturbance (t', - t'J, in any case, we could determine by computation wl1ich of the conditions of (32) or (33) are satisfied. 1Jnfortunately we ha ,.e no means of knowing the Yalues of J at any special time, and we have few observations from wllieh we can deduce general average 'raJnes of it. Glai.sher's obsen·ations, during numerous ballom1 voyages, gave, for the frt>e atmosphere, the followiug rates for the diminution of tempemtnre with the increasP of altitude, taken f'.rom Dr. Hann'is paper, already referred to, deduced from results gh"en originally iu the Report of tlie British Association, 1864.

The i-;ummation of the seYenth eolumn to the top of the atmosphere woultl gi,~e the yalue of tl1e last member of (32).

'l'l;e reason of this i.-. rea(lily seen fro111 a general cousideration of the su~iect without conditions P:Xlll'PssP1l by mathematical cqnations; for if the asceur1i11g currents have been kept up Jong enough to briug J. to the Yalne or J/ iu Table I, and there has been no accession of temperature mmm. while from the primary causes, the temperaturt> of the air above beeomes so redueed, and the density 1·ons1·quentl;r so great, that the atmospheri1: ]Hessure, even of the lower strata, so fa.r as it depends upon temperature, h1·1·omes as great in the interior as iu the exterior part of the disturbed area, and t hl'll tlu· power of the cyclone arnl all motion nrn;;t t·ease. The air is likewise cooled from expansion in horizontal cm-rents where it pa;,;ses from under 1~ gn·ater to a less lmrometric 1iressure, as from the exterior to the interior of a cycl011e. The change of tclll]llll'Utm·c from this canse is a little more than 1° for t>Ycry 10'"'" of difference of pressure. l t lloes not follow, howe1-er, from the preceding result, that the cyclonic action may not be yery \·iolPnt and kept up for a consi<lerable time, for the Yalnes of J,.,.may Yery slowI.r ac11nire such yaJnes, especiall_y in the upper part of the atmosphere, as will make the last member of (32) equal to the fil'st one.

If in this examplt' tlie a1 mospl1Prie distinbance extenrled to a Yer,y small altitude, it is readily seen that the Yalne of the last member of (3'.!J \nml<l be so nearly e1ptal to thP first that we should have the Yalne of D,.

It i;..; seen from what Jff(·eetle:s that all (~.yclouic distnrhances of the atmosphere depend upon tli·~ temperature disturbances dne to the primary canseH. and that without tl1ese there is no disturbance of static equilibrium. Aft.er the iuitial cyclouic motions due to the primary causes have on;ie set in, the secondary causes of temperature disturhance are called into pla~y, which, as a whole, are antagouistie to the primar_y distnrhance8, except in the case of unstable equilibrium, and, unless the latter are H'T.Y g-reat, may e11tirel,v couuteract them, after wbicli static equilibrium again takes place. Tile more nearly the atrnospliere is ill a state of 11m;t:1lile e1p1ilillrinm, that is, the more nearly J" equal,.; J,. for all the strata, tlle less is the counteracting iufiuence of tlte ten1perature ·listurbances dnn to the secondary causes. The caloric arising from the conde11:,;atiou of the aqueous Yapor diminishes J,, by reducing it from th<> Yalnes of J, = 1 o to the ralnc iu table I, and hence puts the atmosphere in a state of unstable eqnilihrium with a ><maller >alue of J.,, amt for ans given valne of J,, less than those of J,. in Table I, giYes the eyclone more power. The etl(·ct of the cold of expansion, or losR of Rensihle caloriC', in the al'ceuding currents is opposeil to that arising from tlu< primary diHtnrllance,;, hut the lat1·nt caloric set free in the condensation of the aqueou11 vapor in part replace;;; the loss of sensilJle c:tloric h;y expansion, more than one-half g·cncrally, as is seen from Table I, anrl lwncP 1limi11ishe,; the counteracting effect of the los;s of se>m;ihlc caloric from expansion of the a.ir. The coJl(1en;;atiou of aqupons Ya.por. therefor!', pla~·s an important part in cyclouic disturbances, but is by no means either a primary or a principal cau.'\e of cyclones. 30. In a cyelonic system with a warm center, we hiwc Reen that the air ascemh; iu the central part, or cyel01w, and desceulls in the anti-cycloHe. Since, thereforp, in ascending currents of only partia.Jly saturated air the vapor must be condensed to cloud at a height greater or less according to the dew-point of the air, and in uesct·rnling current.s there is no condensation of Yapor bnt the vapor already conden,<;cu into cloud is ernpomtcrl, it is C\ident that cyclonic areas, in general, are those of cloud and rain, and anfrcyclonic thmw of clearing and clear weather. Of course it is not t-0 be supposed that these areas flOl'l'espornl with each otl1er with much acenracy either in form or extent. The cloud of tlrn asceudiug part of the atmosphere may he carried h.Y tl1e outward upper currents over into the anti cyclone area before it falls as rain or is eYaporated again in the descend· ing currents of the anti-cyclone.

Cloud iR generally formed in ascending air only, SO that the initial cloud particles, Or extremely fine drops of rain, are at first still carried upward by the ascending current, the smaller ones faster than the larger ones, until by meeting in being carried by one another and agglomerating they become too heavy to be sustained by the upward cnrrent, for the larger the drop tile stronger the current required to keep it np. It then commences to descend, but still growR from meeting with smaller aRcem1ing particles in its descent. lf the upward current is \'ery strong tlie drops are carried yery hig'l1 before they begin t-0 descend, and then, having· a long distance of dense cloud to fall through, they may become ver~' large before tlley reacll the base of the cl oml and the earth. 'Vhere the ascending current is very gentlt1, the small particles or drops may be so small when they have descended to the base of the cloud that they bavem·aporated beforereachiug the earth, and-in such cases no rain falls to the earth. In a cyclonic i;;ystem with a colU center uo rain or cloud can be formed in the cyclone, since the air is graduall,r descending, but if there is doud or rain it must be in the auti-c,rclone. In the two great examples of this kind, embracing tile northern and southern hemispheres of the globe, § 23, the cloudy a.ud rainy parts are the outer limits of the anti-cyelones, which, falling together, form the equatorial rain-belt of the globe. Of course this is to be understood onlj' of the general motions of the systems, and not of those depending upon minor local tlisturlmnces. There is much rain in the higher latitudes of both hemi:spheres, but this arises from the local cyclonic di1'turb· ances, wliich are cyclones within the great hemispheric systems of cyclones, and their conditions form no part of tho~e of the general system in which local disturbances of temperature are not taken into account. 31. So far we haYe regarded the forces depending upon the earth's rotation as being equal 011 all sides of the cyclone, and so have used tl1e'approximate equations (1) in which ·I', the polar distance of the center of the cyclone, is put for ,~, which is the polar llistance of each part of the cyclone. The expression of the accelerating force, in the direction of r, depending upon the earth's rotation is 2 nv cos/;, iu which v is the gyratory linear velocity around the center. Now, on the polar side of the C;\'Clone, where cos ois larger, this force is greater than on the equatorial side wl1ere cos o is smaller. The polar components, then, of these radial forces on the polar side of the cyclone are greater tltan the equatorial components, iu the contrary direction, of the equatorial side, and heuce there is a greater force on the polar side of the cyclone, arising from the earth's rota.tion, causing pressure toward the poles, than on the other, causing pressure toward the equator. The resultant, therefore, of all the forces, of every part of the cj·clone, tends w drive it toward the pole. The residual, or TlPglectBd pait, of this force, for any part of the cyclone, in the preceding theory, is 2 nv (cos o - cos ·I). This beiug resolved into components in the direction of the meridian and perpendicular to it, we g-et for the component of force toward the pole 2 nv (cos o - cos ''')cos 'h in which rp is the ang-Ie expressing the bearing of each.particle from the direction of the pole. On the polar side of the cyclone rl is less than ~' and heuce (cos ii - cos t11) is positive, and likewise cos rp. On the equatorial side both are negative. Hence for all parts of the cyclone, 2 nv (cos a cos 11·) co11 rp, which expresses tlie polar components of the neglected forces depending upon the neglected terms, is positive, and hence the integration of t11is force for all parts of the cyclone gives a force which tends to drh·e it toward the pole, aa stated above. Since v in the al.Jove term is negative in the anti-c~·clone, of course the effect of tlte neglected terms, in the llrecediug treatment of cj·clones, is to drive it toward the equator, so that there is a tendency of the cyclone to cut its way through the anti-cyclone, but on account of the comparatively small gyratory velocities in the anti-cycloue the forces in this case for any given particle of air are much less, in general, than in the cyclo~. As tbe c.vcloue has a tendency to cut its way through the anti-cyclone, and the atmosphere generally, and move toward the pole, and the condensation of aqueous vapor and the whole power of the system are contained mostly within it, the tendency is for the whole cyclonic system, of both cyclone and anti-cycloue, t-0 be drawn toward the pole, in case it is not confined by definite limits but is free to assume a progressive motion through the surrounding atmosphere. Of course it is not to be supposed that the cyclone, in its progressive motiou, contains at all times the same air, but mther that new portions of tl1e air are being continually drawn int-0 circulation on the polar side, where the forces depending upon the earth's rotation are strongest, and that on the equatorial

side, where these forces are weakest, other portions are being, continually bron;rlit to rest by means of friction, and cease to be a part of the system, as the cyclone mo,·es on towm·<l the pole. Siuce the force wh~ch tends to drh·c the cyclone toward the pole, a8 seen a hove, is as (cos,; cos ii'), it is evident that this force, enirything else heing tLe same, is greater iu low tlmn in high latitudes, since (cos 1l - cos") is a maximum at tl1e equator aml Yarlishes a1 tl1f' polf's. 32. It often happens that tl1e co11d itions of' a smaller cyclone, or even several of them, are con· tained within the limits of a larger one. The i:·mbars then, wl1icl1 iu a perfect l,Y regular cyclone are cireular, hecome very irregular. The contained cyclone may be sncl1 as to gin~ two points of minimum barometric pressure, or it may simply produce derangements in t!Je n·gularity of the hmbars. 'Vben t11e isobars become m01·e crowded, and co11;;;eque11tly the l1arometric gradieuti stePper, the vt>locities are likewise greater, for in 1mclt 11laccs the Yelocities of the larger and smaller c:rclone are iu the same direction. 'Vhet'e tlie isobars arc further a11art. aud gradie11ts com;eqnently smaller, the velocities are also smaller, since then the yelocities aJ.'1· in contrary directions and partially neutralize each other. Fig. 4 represents the effect upon the isobars and directions of tl1e wiml of Rmaller e~·cloues contained in larger ones. 111 the 011e on the left the depression wa,; uot sufficient to gh·e rise to a secondar,\· center of ]O\Y barometer, but merely to canRe considerahle derangement in the isobars, crowding t11em together on tlte one side anti widening tlrnm 011 tlte other, and changing somewhat tlie directions of the wind. The one on the right produces a secondar,\· center with tht> wind blow. ing around iti but with much greater Yelocity on the right si(le, wlie1·e tltt· dii'ectimrn of tlw currents of both cyclones coiuci<le, than on the other side where the gyratory Yelocity of the smaller cydone is hut :1 Yer,f little greater than the Yelocity tl.tere of the priiu1ipal one iu the contrary direction. The annulus of high barometer of the larger cyclont'. is increased in height in an irregLllar manner by those of the smaller ones falling somewlmt upon it. Qf course there are generall;r man,\· other disturbance11 combined witlt these to disturb the regularity of the isobars. Since the equations expressing the conditions of a cyclone ~ue not strietl,\- linear equations, especially so far as the centrifugal force of the gyrations is concerned, each set of conditions taken separately does not gi\-e results which, when combined, are precisely the same as the combined conditi011s would giYe, if the equations expressing them could be solYed. The formula (16), therefore, showing the relation between the barometric gradient aml the »elOl·it~· of the wind, i11 sn111e mei1snre fails wlten there is an interference of c,velones, especially "·hen the centrifugal forces are great and the radii of curvature of the isobars small. In such eases, howeYer, tlte formula is applicable without material error if we use the radins of cm·yature of tlw distorted isobar for the radius of the cyclone, r, in the formula. Generally two or more cyclones encroach upon or OYerlap one anotl1er. Fig. ii represeuts the forms of the isobars where two cyclnues, or ratl1er c;rnlouic systems, of equal area and depression, such as represented in Fig. 1, oYerlap in such a manner that the cyclones touch, and each <me is partly o\·erlapped by the anti-cyclone of the otlter. The effect is an area of higl1er uaronwtcr than that of any part of the cyclones taken separately, with the winds blowing somewhat aromlll the 11lace of the maximum, but it is seen that in such cases the isobars are b,r no mea11s circular, bnt, rather, that such areas of higli barometer, eSJH='eially wl1en camed by tlie m·erlapping of more than two c,yclones, often require lines with somewhat acute angles, or at least with very short cun-es to represent the isobars. Of course, in the real cases of nature, any sharp angleis given by theory upon assumed regular conditions, are very much rounded off b,y various abnormal disturbances. If we combine the conditiomi of the two cyclones in such cases in which the temperature gradients are su<lh as given b;y the assumed form of (24), we do not get au area of maximum cold correspondiug to the maximum barometric height, hut one in which the temperature decreases from the point of ldghest barometer each way toward the centers of the cyclones, and increases in each direction from the same J)Qint perpendicular to the line joining the centers. An area of l.Jigh llarometer is not, therefore, necessa.rily one of maximum cold. Such areas of high barometer are mmall,\' callecl anti-cyclones, a111l the air cloes in some manner move around them in a direction contrary t-0 that·of a cyclone, but this docs not arise from a central area of greater cold, for it has boon shown that such a condition would gi,·e rise to a c;rnlone and not to_a.n anti.cyclone, and that the latter would be entirely at variance with fundamental and

The areas of hig-11 barometer, theoretically, are not circular, and neither tl1e gradients uor the motions arom1d them 011 the difi:l;rent side;,; are symmetrical, and they are not ant.i-cycloneH in auy proper sense of the term. 33. S<i far we have rngarded the cyclones as cxistiug iu an atmosphere haYing no motions except those belonging to the cyclonei-;. But. ou account of the general motious oft lie atmosphere, treate!l of in the first part of these researches, cyelouei,; nsnall.r occur in an atmo8phere hayiug a general motion imh~pendtmt of tho,;c of the cyclone itsl'lf. lu order, therefore, to have the true motions relative to the earth's surface, we rnnst take the re,o;ultaut of the two motions. In the middle alHl higher latitudes of the nortltern hemisphere the general or uorrual motioH of the air is from tile west or soutllwest. 11, a cyclone in these latitudes this motion of the air 1~oincides with that of the southern side of the cyclone, arnl i111~r!'l1ses the motion relati\·e to the earth's surface, but on the northern side it is in the contrary <lirection, arnl counterad:-; in some measm·e that of the cyclone, or it may even entirely destroy it. On the east or uortheast side of the c_ydone and its 01)posite, this general motion from the 'vest 01· south west would have little effect upon the Yelocity relative to the earth's surface, lmt would affect mostl,\· the inclinatfon, that is, tl1e angle betwe1m the tangent to the isobar and the direction of the wind, decreasing it on the east or northeast side of the cyelone and increasiug it 011 tl1e west or south we"t si<le. In the latitude of the trade·wiml,., wlwre the geueml 01· normal direction is from tLe east or northeast, the reverse takes place, so that the velocitie8 of the air belonging to the cyclone are diminished or, it ma;v he, entirely de.~troyed b,'I· the general or normal motion on the sonth side of the cyclone, but increa8t'd on the nortl1 ,;i1le. Tim d'fPct upon the iuclfoalion i8 in this case likewise reverse1l, being increased on tl.Je east, or rear si(le aud dec:reased on the opposite side. Since, as \Ye lrnYe t:wcu in ~ :!:3, the general motions of the atmosphere form two great systems of eyclone aud its corr(·spondillg anti-cyelmtt', Rll ordinary C.)'clones are si1u11l,y C.)·eloues within a cyclone, so that all that has lleen statell i11 § 32 with regard to smaller cscloHes within rmlitiary C.)'clones is applic:ahle 11ern to ordi 1rn I'.) e.' <~Jones with rdereuce to tLe general motions of the atmosphere. Hence the isohar·s of eydoues, as lai<l dom1 upon the charts, are the resultants generally of two or more system;; of cyclones contaiued within or eucro1whing upou one a.Bother, and to have tLe isobars helouging to any one system it would be necessary to eliminate the effects of the others. The isobars of all onlinar,\· cyclones are therefore aft'edetl ge11erall,\· lly the it:mbans belonging to the genera 1 motiorn; of t lw at.11wspherP, al'! wt>ll as h,\- the smaller clai;s of cyclones which may be contained within tlt<' ordinary ones. 34. The prog!'ei,;si\-e motion of a cyclone llepends mostly upon the general motions of the atmosphere, but alsg upon the te1Hle11c·y of tlw cyelone to press towanl tlie pole, as explained in § :J2. In tbe trade-wind latitudes the wind at the earth's surface is westwanl, Ill' at least has a large westerly component, and he11ce tlte eyclones iu llieHe latit tulPH a1 e carried westward Ly this westward motion of the air, especially at certain seasons, and lmYin~ likewise a tendency towar1l the pole the resultant of the two ii,; a westward motion, i11eli11ed a little toward the poles, or in the northern hemisphere a motion about 'YN\L After having arrinill at the parallel of :mo or 3,-;o in the tropical calm-belt, where there is no westward motion, the progressh·e motion is a polar oue mostly, but after progressing sti11 nearer the pole, into the milldle aml higher latitude;;, tlie general eastward motion of the atmospltcrc bere, which i,; grnat in the upper regions, canies uow the cyelone toward the east, and the directio11 of the progressiYc motion, which is U8nally abont ENE., is the resultant of tltis eastwar<l rnotio11 am! th<~ motion toward the pole. All well-developed cyclones, therefore, having their origin near the P·1m1tor, 11an; mostly a progressive motion represented by a curve somewhat in the form of a parabola, lnwi11g its vertex in tlie tropical calm-helt at the parallel of 300 or 3;'.iO. Both the progressive velocities and directious, however, are very different in iudividual cases, so that there mu:-;t be other strong modi(ying iutlueuceo, and perhaps among these the principal are the distribution of the aqueous vapor and the positions of the general isothermal lines. The equatorial side of a cyclone is generall.r warmest and contains the most aqueous vapor. As the air containing tllis nlpor is carried arouwl to the east and a,;eemls, it becomes colder both from its asceut to big-her altitudes and from its being carried into higher latitudes, so that the vapor which it contains is mostly condensed on tlic cai;t or northeast side of the cyclone.

of the cyclone is much increased by the latent heat of the Yapor giYen out by condensation, tliis giYes rise to a teudcnc:v to form a new center of a c,Yclone continually iu advance of the old oue, so that the progressh"e motion of tlw cycloue i,; rather a co11timrnl forming of new cyclonet<, at least so far as the lower part of the atmot<phere is co11eernetl. in tlie <lil'ection iu whid1 the vapor of the cyclone is rnoi'tly cu11de11sed. Hence the n~locity of the progn·,;si n~ motion is g·e11e1·ally much greater than that of the geueral motion of the atmo;qlliere below. 'rhe further around the vapor is carried before it is t~011dmmed, the more it will iudiHe the llil'ectiou of the progTest:lirn motion from the east to'.l·ard tlie l>Ole. 1f it t<hould not be carried al'ou11d as far as the east before it is mostly com1e11i-;e(1, it ineliues tl1e progressi n~ motiou from tlu: t!ast t<lll·ard thtc> ecjlrntor. If the isotherms should ym·.'- much from the parallels of latitude tl1is abo might La 1·e considerable effect, so that if they extended from S\Y. to XE., the progrcs8iYe motion would be more im:lined toward the poles tLaa they woul<l he if they exteudell from X\Y. to :SE. These views with regard to the effect of tlie mwqual distrilmtiou of vapor upon the direction of tlrn progres,;ive motions of cyeloues wa,; first giveu by H.eY. \Y. Clement Ley. (Laws of the 'Wind, chap. vi.) 35. In the general motions of tl1c atmmqlhere the eastward motion, e;,;peciall~- in tlrn 111i1hlle latitudes, is much greater in the upper regions than rn.·ar the earth'" uurface, antl increases iu proportion to the altitude, as may be seen from Table XI, ~ 4;;, of the first part of tl1l'se Hesearehes, aud this is especially the case in tlw uortlien1 11emisphen~ in the winter seasou, i11 winch, accordi11g to the table, the rate of increa,;e with the altitmle i,; rnore than twice as grnat as iu the su111111er season. The tendency of this it< to carry tlie upper part of the cyclone eastward fa,;ter tlutu the lower part, an<l a8 the upper pm·t, iu wliich condensation 1110,.;tly take,.; place, canil's with it in some measure tlw ]lower of the cyclone, tl1e p1·ogTessiYe motion dept>rnls more n1iou tbe motion of the upper strata tl!m1 upon t11at of the lower om's uear the earth's stufaee, and the lower part of the cyclone tend1< to lag hehirnl tlie center of power of tl1e e;rnloue aml to come from umll:'r its cont.rol, aIHl new portio111' of the lower stratti in front of t11e cyclone are lJCiug· continually brought under it,.; power and ma<le to form a part of tl1e cy0Jo11e. The cyclone, therefore, HO far a.~ tlie lower strata are co11cer11ed, is beiug coutinnall,\- formed anew iu adntuce from this cause, just as the whole cyclone at all altitudes is, from the Pil'ect of the crn1deu,.;atio11 of vapor, becau;,;e in the middle latitudes of the northern herni,;phere it takes place mostly on th·· east or northeast si<le of the cyclone. 80 far as the progTc;,;sin~ motion of the cyclone depeuds upon the general motions of the atmosphere, tl:Jis motion, in the rniudle aud higher latitudes, :should be greater iu winter than in summer, since the general eastward motion ii:; greater iu the former ;,;eason than the latter. From TalJle XI,§ ±:3, Part I, it is "!\f'll that 011 the parallel;; of the trade-winds in the mirthcrn hemisphere, say 15° or :m 0 , tlie1·e is au eastward eompouent of motion in the \Yinter season al10Ye the altitude of about oue kflomcter, which at still hig·her altitmleis soon becomes yery strong, so that at that season it would he smucel;y possible for a cyclone to mo\·e \H\,.;tward m1lel:!ti its power were confined mostly to the lower strata of the atmosphere; for if this power were moi:;tly nhove, where the gene1·al motion is eastwan1, U1e whole s,ystern umst likewise mm·e east\\·ard. Iu the summer season, on the other haucl, it is seen that there is a westward component of motioll at all altitudes except in the very high and rare portions of the atmospl1ere, and hence at this 1'ea,.,on cyeloues in these latitudes must be carried westward. 3H. If a regular c;yclone existed in au at.mospbere in which the general motions of the upper and lower 1drata, were the same, the isobars would be circular, awl likewise the rain an·a,.;, but where the upper strata moYe faster in any direction tlian the lower 011es, the whole bo1l,v of the cyclone becomes of the form of a cylinder inclined forward in that direction, aml the eft'ect is to extend the barometric pressure in that direction, and to giYe the isobars an elliptical iustcad of a circular fonn. The eft'ect is. the same also upon the rain areas, since the cloud, embracing the up1wr part of the inclined cylinder, is likewise extended in the direction of the general motions. As the liase of the cloud is generally at a considerable altitude al10Yt~ tlrn earth':s l'mrface, tlw t:enter of tltt' cloud and rain area must fall a little forward of that of the barometric pressure, since the latter dt'pc1Hls upon the whole inclined eyliuder from bottom t-0 top, while the former depends upon the u1111er lJart only. In view of the great extent of a cyclone in co1111lariso11 with the height of tile atmosphere,

neglecting the upper very rare portions, the whole must be regarded as a very thin disk rather than a cylinder. It is Jffohable, therefore, that the forward inclination of the axis of the gyrations is not Yer.Y great, or at least that the center of gyration of the upper strata d<>es not fall Yery far in arlYance of that of the lower strata. For if it did, there wouhl be so great a difference in tl!e Yelocities of the upper and lower strata in some parts that the friction arising from this cause would tend to counteract this state, and cause the g,nations of' the upper a111l lower strata to somewhat coincide. Still the warm and moist air and cloud of' the upper region wonld be carried far in adYallcc of the center of g_yrations below, and this woultl tencl to give the whole cyclonic area an elliptical form, and perhaps to this cause is mostly due the elong~1tiou of the areas of low barometer and of the rain areas. Since the relative velocities of the rlifl'erent strata eastwar4l, in tlte middle latitmles especially, arc greatr in winter than in sununer, the isobars and the rain areas should be more extendeu in the direction of progTessive motion in the former than the latter smtson, and the higher the base of the cloud, the farther in general should the center of the cloud and rain area fall in advance of the center of the isobars and the 1>oint of minimum barometric pressure. Iu the latitudes of the t.rade-winds in 1SL1mmer a111l autumn, when cyclones occur in these hltitmles having a west or northwest progTessive motion, it is most probable that the isobars and rain areas are not extended in the direction of progressive motion, and that the center of the cloud and rain area doe:s not fall forwanl of that of the isobars, since in the8e latitudes aud seasom; the upper strata can scarcely lwYe a greater general motion than the lower ones in the direction of' progressive motion.
CHAPTER II.

PTIACTfCAL APPLICATIONS OF THE THEORY AND COl\IPARISONS WITH OB. SEHYATION.
38. After giving any tlleory with regard to natural phenomena, which shows the relations between given conditions and the results which must follow, the next most important step, and the one which natnrall,Y follows in regular order, is to compare the theoretical relations or laws with observation where there are observations aYailable for this purpose. And this is especially the case where there is any vagueness or uncertainty in the theory, so that it does not carry absolute conYiction '1ith it, but rather merely suggests laws which, although they may be regarded from theoretical cousiderations as being highly probable, are still not absolutely certain and need to be corroborated h,y oh,;ervation. lt must be acknowledged that this is frequently U1e case in meteorological researches, in which the conditions of nature can often be only imperfectly and approximately represente<l by mathematical equations, and these are then still too complex to admit of a conlJilete solution. :For then absolute quantitatiYe results cannot generally be obtained, but merely certain laws or r{1lations depending on the generally unknown laws and constants of friction, or upon constants left umletermined from the impossiliiJity of a complete solutiou of the problem, so that altltougli t11e laws may be established by th~ory, ;yet the quantitative results depending on these u11kuown constants, if determined at all, must be determined from observation. Although in meteorological researches theory often needs to be supplemented and eoIToborated by observation, yet it must not be supposed that the aid dertved from theory is not of very great importance; indeed, a ver,Y important prm·ince of theory often is merely to suggest laws and render them somewhat probahle which, but for the theory, would never occur to any one, while the complete establishment of such laws must be left to observation. lu the preceding theory of cyclones certain regular conditions had to be assumed, to which those mmally occurring in nature are frequently only very rough approximations. For instance, it is not to he s1111posed that the conditions of a cyclone in nature consist of regular gradients of increasing or <leereasing temperatures, accordillg to any given Jaw, from the center to some definite exterior limit and perfectly symmetrical on all sides, as assumed, for the sake of simplicity, in § 1G ; for they may often deviate very much from such regular assumed conditions. Besides several sets of such ap1>roximate conditions may encroach upon and interfere with on~ another, and

the conditions of smaller cyclones and tornadoes may be included within those of large c~·elonei;;, thus COillJ)licating the theor.r and rendering it more uncertain. In comparisoui;;, therefore, in special cases obser,·ation may seem to differ widely from theory, a ncl although this may be in some measure due to tl1e imperfections of the theory, yet it generally arises from the lack of sufficient obserYations to determine the Teal comlitionl' whicl1 give rise to the lll1e11ome11a ohser·ed. The temperature and barometric gradients of a tornado may be included entire\~- within the sturou111li11g stations of obsern1tion frorn which synoptic charts are formed, so that theory, from tl1e conditions indicated by such a chart, might give only a rno1lerate wind in a certaiJJ direction, while the ohRcrYed wjnd, ancl wiud giYen tlrnoretically by the real conditions, might be that of a huniea11e i11 quite a contrary direction. Jn the comparisons of theory with obsen·ation, tlierefore, it i>' lH'cessary to lrnve tlie aYerages of a great nwny ollservatio11s made under Yario11s cirenmstmicer; arnl at different times and 11laces, so that the effects of all almonnal 1listurlmnces and Yariations frnm tllP assn,ned regular comlitiow.; may he eliminated in the nmnber of obserYations used. In the determination of such conl:itants in the theory as are llecessari1y left to ohservatiou, and in the comparisoirn of theory with ob::;erYation, it would be impossible, for the want of tinw au<l space, to enter here into tlw examiuation and discussion of the numerom; iudid<lnal obsern1.tiom; m:ule in almost a11 parts of t.11e worltl wh ieh wonltl he antilalllt' for this purpose. I~ortmiatel,Y this is not necessary, since there are a number of workers in this field who with great labor liani obtained and gi\·en to the worhl mauy \'ery Yaltlable results which are availaule f\.)l' this pm·pose, so that it will he Hecessary here mrn;tly merely to enter into the fruits of their labor. For these, investigators generall~- of meteorological theories, as well as the author, shoni<l regsnl themseh·e,, as being undei· yery great aIHl lasting obligations. Among- these fo1portant results ohtailwd from ohsen·ation are thmm of the HeY. \V. Clement Ley, published in his "Laws of the \Vinds," and in various meteorological journah; those of Professor Loomis, <lcthwed, with mncll labor, from the numerous aud important ol1scrvations and weather maps of the Gnite<l States Signal SflTice, and published in a i>eries of meteorological papt>r8 in the American Journal of Seience aud Arts; those of Dr. Hildebrandsson, with n·g<trd to the n1iper curreuts of the atmosphere, arriYP(l at from an examinatiou of the synoptic charts of the Hoyal J\leteomlogical Institute of Demnark, and also t!Je 1'esultr; of Oi1ptain 'l'oyuhee, in ocean meteorology. l\lauy very importa11t obse1Ta· tions for our purpose are alr;o found i11 a work*, recently come to hand, on the hurricanes of the Antilles in Se1)tember and October of 1816 and 1817. These are e,;pecially important 011 ac(;onnt of their coming from a low latitude from wllich we have comparath'el~- few observations, and from a region which is peculiarly subject to these devastating cyclones or hurricanes; and also uec<mse these c;rnloues are hut little affocted by tlie inequalities of land surfaces, and conseque11tl.\· lia ve more of the regularity of ocean cyclo11es, while the obs6n·ations can be made with ttll the facilities for accurate obsen'ation afforded by land stations. With the laws deduced from the theory of cyclones, corroborated so far as may be, an<l supplemented by ~bservatiou, the various inequalities, both local a11d dt'pernliug upon tl1e Rea:mus, wl1ieh are observerl in the velocities and directions of the wind and iu the atmospheric 1n·essure over the difterent parts of the gfobe, may be explained, and the phenomemt attending the progressive cyclones over limd and sea may not only be explained bnt oft(lu autici11ated. Snch laws are important to all who are iuterestt'd in obser\·ing and understanding rileteorological phenomena, but especially to the mariner, exposed to t,be tlestructive <\ycloues a.t sea,, is a knowledge, not only of the laws of these cyclones, but likewise of the normal states of the winds and of the barometric pressure in all parts of the ocean and at all seasons of the year, unaffected hy the abnormal dii:;turbances of these progressive cyclones, of the very greatest importance; since, with a knowledgt.1 of the normal conditions of the winds and of barometric pressure at any time and place, he can perceive the first indications of the abnormal disturbances which are the forerunners of these storms, and so can be 011 l1is guarcl, and tlien, with a knowledge of the laws of these storms or cyclones, he can generally avoid at least their most dangerous part.

The first important relations obtainecl in tll(' preceding chapter ure those of § 10, (h·dnced from eq nation (ll ), showing the relation,.:, under ditte.re11t circumstances, between the directions of the wind an!l the isobars, exp1·rssed h,Y the angle of inclination i, which i;; the angle between the direction in which the wirnl blows and the tangent to tlw isobars. Here theory giYes us no 1Jna11titati n:\ result, since tl1e ,-alne of this angle, as ,;;bown b~· (11 ), depernls mostly upon .the unknown function of friction F,. From what is stated in § 7 this eannot be regarded a8 a function of the Yelocit~· in which we could determine from obserYation the friction constant, except perhap:,; at the earth'>; snrtiH'e and al\\~ay;; uwlPr pr.,cisely the samp circumstanceti, lrnt it is rather a function of tlte differences of Yelocitief< of the different strata of the atmosphere. \Ye know, however, that it depemls upon arnl vani:-:hes witl1 frietion, awl that "·here there i8 friction there umst be a certain amount of inclining of the will(l at the earth's surface from the direction of the tangent. t11 t.he i:,;obar tmvanl the l'enter of a cyclone, as stated in § 1 O (a), aml hence that the air mnst mo\·e around and toward the center in a kind of spiral; hut the amo1111t of thi" inclination, as required by theory ai1d shown hy ohserYatiou, is »Pry different under different circumstances. So far as tf'sting the thpm·y h,\~ obsPrYaJion is coneerne<l, all that can !Jc tlone in t.11is cai,;e is to show from oh,;;ervation that there is a certain amount of inclination at the earth's snrface, aud that thi8 varies under different circumstances as reqnired by theory, hut the amounts can only be !letermined by ohsen-ation. There was at one time a loug all!l animated di:'icnssion between the rcsp«ctfrc adherents to the circular gyratory theory of Ue1ltiel!l, so calle11, and the radial theor;y of Espy. Both parties, l'ntirely si111·Pre 1101louht, hut u11avoidahly hiased in some measure in the support of their theories, thonght that tlif'y found almnda1tt eYidences from ohsernttion, after careful 1mn·«ys and measurements in 8ome cas1·s, to support their theories. If either theory had been the true one, observation would no doubt have safo;ficrl the adl1crents to the other that it, was erroneous, lmt we now sec that the trnth lips between the two theories, arnl hence the vague and uncertain indiYidual obsen·atious or th<' eft{·cts.; of cydones and tornadoes could he easily c01mtrue1l in many cases to impport eit11er tlrnor.Y. 1n j u,;;t icP to Mr. l~B<lfiel!l, it shoultl Im hPre stated that he did not maintain that the wi11ds were strictly eircnlar, but that there was most probably some inclining of the winds towar!l the center. 40. )Ir. Ley was the first who ernle:wored to determine the angle of inclination in large c~-dones from a g-reat nn111hcr of obsern1tions made at. fifteen stations, mostly in the British 18Jes, from which lie deduced the following conclusions (.Journal of the Scottit'b Met. Soc., 1873, p. G6); I. "The winds commonly i11cline from the districts of higher towards those of lower pressure. The collectfre mean result for the. fifteen stations is 200 M'. II. "This inclination is mneh greater at inland than at well-exposed coast stations. The collectin· mean for llretit, Scil!J·, Farmouth, Pembroke, and Hollyhead is 120 49', while for the inland stations, Loudon, ~ottiugham, Oxford, BruHsell'I, awl Paris, it. is 2so 5.'3'." Tl1ese confirm the part of tlw theory of cyclones contained in § 10 (a), since they show that at the earth's surface there is a certain amount of inclining of the wind:-; from the tangent to the isobar8 toward the center, and also that a.t the inland stations, where friction is greater than at and near the sea, this indi11atio11 is greater than it is near tlw sea. 'l'he aYerage inclination of SE. winds was :150 11'; of NE. winds, 170 4:l'; of N\V., 90 4', and of S\V. winds, 20° 13'. Iu these results S. winds were taken as S \V. winds, E. as SE., and so on. Hence ESE. windR have the greatetit aud \VNW. winds the least inclination toward the center, which winds are very nearly those of the NE. and SW. sides of the c;yclone, aud consequeutl.Y of the front aud rear sides of it, siuce the average direction of progress of the c,yelones was from SW. to NE.

Considering for the present the results onl.v of this table belonginp; to tlrn surface currents, we find that tLe M'erage anglP with thp, ratliuis for tlrn exterior districts is frt.o.u, and for the interior districts 6i"i 0 .9, which give for the inclinations rl'spectively :!;;o,4 aud 24°.1, the aYPrag-P liei11g 2.i.0.1. This inclination is a little greater than that obtained by l\Ir. Ley iu his former diseussion of ob:serYatiom,; mm;tly from the British Isle8, hut thi,; is what we should expect from tlleoretical considera· tions, since in the latter case tllere was a mueh larger number of land statiom; iu emnparison with the coast stations, a111l lH·nce friction, and conseqneutJ~- the angle of inclination in the an~rage, should be greater. The mean angle of inclination giren by l\Ir. Le,Y is greatn, arul seems to he that gfren by all the observations without i·egard to groups or dis~,ricts, wliile the aYerages 11ere gfren are those of the aYerages of the sernral groups. These must gi\·e the most prolmole results, since it is seen from, the table that in both the exterior and interior district8 tile inclinations art> greatest in those districts in which there were the most obserYations, whieh must be due to some real cause, and the difference'! cannot be merely accidental oues wliit~h may be elimiuated h~· the number of observations. It is seen that the average i11c,ifination of the exterior districtH, 2fi0.4, is very little greater than that of the interior districts, which is 240.1, and hence these results furnish only a very teel>le confirmation of § 10 (c), which requires the inclination to be less in the i11te1for thau tlw exterior part of a cyclone, or area of low pressure. It ma~· be seen, howe\'er, from au inspection of Fig·. C, that the average distances for the exterior and interior districts was perhaps not n'r,y great in eompa.rison with the average radius of the whole districts, and it. is mostly near tht> cc~ter that tl1eory requires that there should be much diminution in the inclination. The districts C, c, are on the front side of the cyclone in its progre8sion and G, g, on the opposite side, and it is seen from the table that the average inclination of the former is 37°, arnl that of the latter only 120. These result."! agree well witl1 those of the former ones, from ohsen·ations of the British Isles mostly, the inclinations from the latter for the front and rear sides heing, as we have seen, about 350 and 90, the8e both being a little less because the general awrage i8 less.

The ~werage of tliese inclinations is near]~- 47°, which is much greater than that obtained by Mr. Lt\'\' for Europe. This, however, iR satisfactorily explained b;v theory. l\ir. Ley's observations were mostly of winds of considerable forcC', bnt Professor Loomis took in all cases within the isobar of 2H.!I inches, which i11c)n(letl many observations of veloeities of only three or four miles per hour. This is s(·en 110t 011ly from tltt> tahle of results gh·en by Professor Loomis, but also from the small aYerages of all the ohserYati011s giYen aboYt,. The ayerage distance from the center, therefore, of the observations used hy J>TofeKsor Loomis wai,;, no donht, much gn·ater thau that of the observations used by Mr. IA.'.'f, and hence hy § 10 (c) the inclination obtained h,r the former should he greater than that obtaim·!l b.Y the latter. Again, the a'ITeruge latitude of t11e ohsenTations used by the for111er is mneh less thall tliat of t11e ohs1·rnitious of the latter, arnl on this account also, by§ 10 ( d), thB iueliuation obtained by Professor I1oomis for the United States i:;honld be greater than tbat obtaitH'd by .Mr. Le.y for Europe. All agree in eon firming tbe truth of§ 10 (a), and in showing that tbe amount of iuelination, ou lanu at lem·t, must iu g·eueral be considerable, and consequently the c~·elonic gyrations not at all circular. If we now comp~tre the prem·di 11g i11di11atiom; for the several quadrants with those of Mr. Ley, it is seen that the maxima and minima are uel.lrly oppu::iite, for l'rofessor Loomis gets the greatest inclination in the \\". qnallmnt, which is nearly the rear quadrant on the a\Terage in the United State>;, while :\Ir. l1ey got thP greatest inclination in the front districts. This will lie considered further on, as WB are bNe merely seeking confirmations of the theoretical deductions of § 10. The following i,.; tl1e snmniar.r of the practical results obtained by Captain Toynbee from a rl iscnssio11 of the ohHCtTationl'l iu the ~ orth A.tlantie during the great cyclone on the 24th and 25th of Angust, 187;{ ('.\letereology of the North Atlantie during August, 1873): l. There is strong cvillence that the wind in a hurricane draws i11 toward it8 center. 2. The irnlraft is in·olJa bl,r greater in oue quarter than iu aI1otl1er. ~'- The irnlraft is prohably greattir near the center than further from it. The an·rage inclination from all the observatio111-1 wa,s 29°, the ob8ervations being ou the average at about tl1c parallel of 50°. This is a greater inclination than that ol)tained by Mr. Ley for Europe, though m nch less than that of l'rofessor I,oomis for the United States. Theory requires tlle i11cli1iatio11 to be less on the ocean tl1an on land ou the same latitudes. The last item in the eo;nmmary above is contrary to theory, but the author seems to regard this as onl.\· a prohahle condusion. The few ob8ervations which can be made on the ocean in a great, storm, where tlwre are 110 faeilities for making them accurately, cannot be relied upon to give very aceuratP results. 4a. From tht· oh,.,ervatiom; of Patlre Yifies on the hurricanes of the Antilles during September and (ktuhf'r of 1~7;"i arnl 1876, we rna,v deduce some Yalnable results with regard to the inclination of the wind" in cyclones ii ~hese low latitudes. Although we do not have in these the aver· ages of mau:'I~ obscnation1:1, yet we ca11 rely on tliem with considerable certainty, since the cyclones here, being 1wnrl,Y the i'l:une as oceau cydones, are more rcgnlar and uot so much affected by irregular ahuormal disturbing iufiuences, which require large numbers of observations for their elimination.

of the Antilles it was obsen·ed "that the gyrating winds cease to be circular at a long distance from the vortex and are found to dlwiatc from the tangent to the circle with au iuclination toward the center, forming a kind of large converg·ing spiral. Tl1is cotfferging i>' likewise said to "Yar,\· not only in different ltnrrieanes, hut likewise in th.· same hurricane, \Yith !lift<·r('nt directions arnl intensities of the win<l and with different distances from the rortex.'' In the same eor111ectio11 it is stated that the inclination is" especially small at no great clistauee from the Yortex." (Apuntes, · &c., p. 90.) In the hurricane of Septemller, 1875, '·the winds of the anterior part of the storm wPre approximately circular, or with a i,;light inelination toward the center i11 some cases.'' Bnt from oh8e1Tations made at numerous places" the wiucls of the second (SE.) (jtUttlrauL which remained at all these places when the vortex was at a com;iderahle distance, Rutl'ered a great deYiation toward the center, and in some cases likewise the winds not far from the vortex.'· (Apnnks, &c., p. !J2.) Similar observations were macle of the hnericanes of 18W. 111 tlw anterim· part of the storm the winds de:viated hut little from the ta11ge11t towanl the centl'r. bnt in tl1e postflfor part they blew almost directly towanl the center. Ou the islaucl of Porto Hico '' littl<· dedation in the winds of the thir1l aud fourth (SvY. and .~nV.) quadrants waR noted, l'onw greater con,~ergency in those of the first (::SE.) quadrant and a great iucli1iation toward the ce11ter in tho8e from th(' E. and S., especially as the.r llecame at a great distance from the nntex." (Apuuh's, &c., p. !13.) The hurricane of the Hlth of Octoher, 18i'fl, is presented as a notahh· example of the great convergency of the winds. "Afte.r its passage h.r IlaYana the \Yimli-;; wl1id1 in the posterior part blew from west to south, 8Ufi'ered :1 great 1leviatio11 toward the center, aml that not only at a distance from the Yortex but eYen in itl' vieinit~-." And" the wiud,.; which JH'P\'ailml from SSE. to 8., and which, <luring the passage of the \'ort~·x b,v Ha\·aua hl1'I\' with force in the different towns situated to the ESB. of Havana, s11ffe1·<,d likewise a 1·ery 11otahlt' inclination towanl tl1P center. With respect to the winds which preYailed iu tlw first quadnrnt in tlte different localities of the antelli.or part of the c.yclone, there. was obsen·ed in them likewiHea 11otahleconvcrgency, though in general in a less degree.'' (Apuntes, &c., p. !13.) From the preceding extracts, and mauy others of the !'.lame 1.'iucl which migl1t be cited, it is evident that there is not only au inclination of thP wi111ls in tht:' 1·yc1011es of the Antillt:'s, in accordance with § 10 (a), but that this i11cli11ation is much greater thall in high latitudes, as required by § 10 (d). This latter deduction from theory, if true, is very important from practical considerations, and although there cannot be any doubt with regard to it where the theory is understood, yet any observatiom; which teud to confirm it must be regarded as being ,·e1·y important, and many more observations of the same kind are ver.v desirable. 111 the extreme C}1ses, namely, in front en<l roor of the storm, the angle of inclination il'l the former is stated to he very small and the direction of the wind to be nearly at right angles to the radius of the c,\·clonP1 and in the latter to be so large that the wind blew 11lmost directly toward the center. On other sideR of the cyclone the observations seem to give about a mean between these extremes. Tlw angle of inclination, therefore, in the cyclones of the Antilles, and a\ all place" at sea in the same latitudes, is probably about 45° on the average of all cases of great velocities of tlrn wind, a.ml still much greater where the yeJocities are not very gr&1.t. But we do not have obserrations eno11gb yet for determining quantitatini results wit]). much aocumcy. At sea, in the latitude of England, this angle is most probably only from 200 to 250, Still nearer the equator than the latitude of the A11tilles the inclination rnnst approximate to 900, and on the equator, if theFe could he any central point of seusihl,y lower pressure, we know that the winds would be radial, in aceor<hrnce with Espy's theorr. This theory took no account of the important influence of the ea,rth's rotation, a.ml is therefore trne only, so far as the direction of the wind is concerned, for an earth without rotation 011 its axis, and at the equator, where the effect of rotation vanishes. But this theory would give no Yiolent winds or areas of sensibly lower barometric pressure, as we see is the case at and near the equator. With regard to the theoretical law of § 10 (e) there are mans eddences in the obserrntions of the hurricanes of the Antilles, to show tJ1at the inclination near the Yort,e:x or center of the cyclone is less than at considerable distances. It is not ()nly so stated, as in the cases cited, but it may also be inferred from many other places where, in referring to the great inelinations in special

212

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

cases tlw phrase i8 often added, "even nea.r the vortex,'' as though it was considered that the inclination there is usually less than at greater distances. 44. From the deductions of tueory, confirmed now and supplemented by numerous observations, it h; 1widm1t that many of the nsnal rules aud sailing directions must be very much modifieil, espeeially in low latitudes. Altbough the horn cards of Piddington, and all the rules based upon the strietly circular theor~· of the winds, may still be used at sea in high latitudes without great f'rr01·, yf't nearer tlie equator they nnrnt become more erroneous, and entirely fail at the equator if cyclones eonld exist tlwre. It i,:; lwginning to be prett,y generally acknowledged that in sailing flirecti011s in a l"itorm, ;.;0111e allowa11ce shouhl be made for a certain small amount. of inclining of the winds, but it seern" to he thought that this should be the same in all latitudes and at all dis· tanrws from the ct·utPr of the o;torm. If in low latitudes the inclination of the winds may be 60° or mort>, the clctl'rmination of tl1e direetion of the <laugerons center of a cyclone from the usual rules based npon the circular theor;1·, in which the i11clination is supposed to be naught, would lead to an error of fh·e or ;.;ix points ot' tlie cornpa8s. For this reason the amount of inclination at sea nuder m·erage circnnu~tm1ce:-1 sbonld he determined from observation for different latitudes, so that the na\·ig~tor con!.! mo1lify J1is rules to suit the latitudt·-; but unfortunately we have but few obserYations yet for tbis purpose at sea, and \'ery few on land for the lower latitudes. E\ren on the same latitudes considerable allowance should he mafle for distance from the center. While the center of tbe cyclone is yet a.ta considerable distance and the winds have not a great velocity, it should be eonsidPre<l that thtly are prnbably, even iii high latitudes, considerably iuclined toward the center an<l that nearer the equator the,v may be nearl.r radial, but mren in tiiese latitudes at places near the center, where the vPlocities are Yery great, the gyrations may become nearly circular. 45. So far we have neglectP<l to consider the effect of the progressi rn motion of the cyclone or air in which the cyclone exists, and consequently ha\re regarded the inclinations as being the same 011 all sides. \\There the cyclone has a progressive as well as cyclonic motion 1 the former makes the inclinations differ on different sides, as stated in § 34. The progressive motion of the atmospl1e.re at tl1e earth's surface in tbe United States is very small, as is evident from an examination of the isobars on Chart I, Part I, and as has also been 8hown by the late Professor Coffin in llis "\Vincls of the Globe," according to which this velocity is only in general two or three miles and even less in places, and from the SW. This, however, with Professor Loomis' small average velocities of the wind, given in § 42, should increase the inclination very sensibly in the west quadrant aml decrease it in the east quadrant, while the inclinations of the north and south qnadr:w1s sl1onl<l l>e little affected and ha"\"e about the a\rcrage value of all. This is the case with his resulto;, and hence they are in acconlance with tl1eory. From the chart referred to above, tbe 1n·og-res:-iirn motion of the air in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, between Europe and America is comparatively gn·at, as shown by tl1e closeness of the isouars, and hence this motion mu;;t affect the inclinations in cyclones there very much, especially in such parts of thern as have only moderatP rnlocities of the wind, aud from this cause the winds should have smaller inclinations in the front than the rear part of t11P. cyclone. But it now becomes ver,v difficult to explain b_y the preceding theory why Mr. Ley obtained greatN i11cli11ations in Europe for the front than the rear parts of the storms, while Professor I,oomis, for the United States, and Padre Vines, for the AntillM, obtained the reverse. This, however, ma,\· he explained somewhat plausibly from the consideration that the cyclones in Europe, especiall.r those of the British Isles and Norway, are cyclones within a great cyclone with its center near Icehtnd, and thi;.; is especially tLe case during the wintm seasol1, as is seen from Chart V, Part l. They are consequently cyclones upon an inclined plane, as it were, and hence the isobars, as mmall,v charted, are very much distort-ed, and the center of the cyclone as given by the charted isobars iR thrown to the left of the real center of the cyclone, as is shown in Fig. 4, and consequenHy to the NW. of the real center in this case. It is readily seen that this decreases the angle with the radius on the front or NE. side of the storms an.d increases it Oil the rear or SW. side, and consequentl,y the inclination is increased in the former and decreased in the latter. There is also another effect wbich should be considered here, which is that of the term D,a in (11), which depends upon the inertia of the air. Since at the earth's sarfaoe, if the atmosphere

213

has a greater progressive motion above than below, a new c;yclone is being contimrn1ll,v formed and new portions of air in front are re()efring a11 increasing gyratory motion, while the gyratory motion in tl1e rear is bl'i11g contjrmally <limi11ishecl for the sanw reason. The term D,~, tl1ereforP, for the front part is posith·e and for the rear negative, a.nd hence by (11) it tends to increase i on the front side ancl decrease it in the rear. This may in some cases be considerable, but the effect must generally be small. 46. Tbe effect. of the progressi ,.emotion of the air on the inciinatiom; of the winds in the e:n~lones of the Antilles iR quite large, since the progressive rnotiou of the tr,ule-winds is comparatin~l,Y great. Here the trade-winds become nearl,'I· east winch;, as i-;hown by Profoi-;sor Coffin in tlte """ind1; of tlte Globe." Hence, the winds whose cyclonic component of motion is from the X. or S. suffer the greatest deviation from this direction, the inclination being d~creased in the former case and increased in the latter. This will be better understood from Fig. 7, in whicl1 ab represents the cyelouic compmwnt of motion, snpposed to have an inclination of 4-Ti 0 m1 all sicles, aml be tlu' prng-n·ssiYe component from the ea,st, or nearly, and ac, tlie resultant of both. The direction of the progrcssfre motion of the cyclones of the A11tilles, e;;peciall:· at Havana, may be assnnwd to he about N\Y ., represented by the arrow in the figure. It is seen that in the front part of the storm the inclination of tlte resultant oc i,.i much dimini;;l1ed in consequence of the progressi\·e component he, a))(l made almost perpendicular to the radius, while from the same cause it is n·ry mucl1 imTeased in the rear, and the direction of the resultant motion coincides very nearly with thP radius, that is, is very nearly toward the center. Ou the right side, the directiou of the progressirn Yelocity /Jc coincides with that of the cyclonic motion ab, and conaequently the resultant is inereast>d, while on the left side it is in the coutrar,\· direetion, a1Hl eonseqnentl~· the resultant \·eloeit,v i,,; diminished. We have now a complete explanation of the olJsen-ed differences of inclination of tl1e wimls in the different quadrants of the c.vclones of the Antilles. By a reference to the citations alreads ginu in§ 43 it is Hccn that in ernry irrntancc the winds in the anterior part of tl1e cyclom' are said to he nearly circular or to deviate but little from the tangent, while in the posterior part, where the winds are mostl,y from SE. to S\V. the inclination is sitid to be ,·ery great autl the winds to blow almost toward tlte center, as represented by the directions of the resultant ac in Fig-. 7, in the ~wterior and posterior parts of the diagram. It is further stated with regard to tliese c~·clones generally, "that tlte wimh1 which ha Ye snf· fered least deviation with re>ipect to the tangent of the circle having for its ceuter tl1t· center of the vortex of the cyclone, have been those which have lilown from the first and fourth quadrant;;, and those de\'iatiug most with au inclination toward the center, tho:se (which have blowu) from the third, and especially those from the second quadrant. lu the winds from the E. and S. the inclination is Ruch sometimes at all distances from the Yortex tllat the wind blows directly toward it." (Apuntes, &c. p. 91.) Here it is stated again that the winds which blew from the first and fourth quadrants, which are the winds of tlte "\V. or N"\V. quadrant of the cyclone, and consequently the anterior part of it, had the least de\'iation from the tangent, and tltat those willds which blew from the third, and e>i}'tecially those from the second, quadra1Jt, and which are neccH· sarily wind;; of the posterior part of the cydoue1;, had the greatest iuclination, as they should from what has been shown. This inclination seems to lta,re beeu so great in winds from the SE. that they blew directly toward the center, as they wonld according to the postf~rior part of the diagram of Fig. 7, if the progres:sive velocity be were made a little greater in comparison wit.11 the c.vclouic component a.b. 47. From what ·precedes it is seen that the na,vigator, on determining the direction of the vortex of a cyclone from the. direction of the wind, should, in addition to cousiclering latitude, distance from center, and velocity, likewise consitler in what quadrant of the cyclone he is sitnatPd, 1;iuce the direction of the vortex wit.Ji reference to that of the wind is so differe11t i11 different quadrants, especially where there is a large progressive motion, as in the trade-wind regions. In the front part of a cyclone, where the mariner is in the greatest danger, the direction of the vort.ex is generally more nearly at right angles to the direction in which the wind blows-to the left in the northern hemisphere and the contracy in the southern-and consequently the old rules of the circular 'theory are more nearly correct here than on any other side of the storm. "\Ve have seen that this is the case in the front part of the cyclones of the Antilles, where the direction of the vortex is

214

REPORT OF THE

SL~ERINTENDE~T

OF THE

nearly at right angles to the direc~tion of the wind, while in the rear it is nearly in the direction in which the wiml blows. On either side of the direction of progress, the direction of the vortex in cyclones here may be estimated to be about 4ii 0 to the left of the clirectiou in whicll the wind blows. 48. Considering now the direetions of the wind in a o~·clone at difterent eleYations, and in the upper regions of the atmosphere, it is found that the dt:'dndiorns from theory are generally con· firmed by ob,;eryation in a remarkable manner. Atcording to § HJ (b) the inclination is less at some distance ahoYe tlle surface of the earth than at the surfaec, aml at great altitudes it is negatiYe or outward, aud hence where tlle cyclonic motions arc uot too mucli disturbed by combined progTcssi\·e motions, the directions of the clouds, in the uorthern hemisphere, sl10uld be from a point wbiL-h is to the right of that from which the surface winds blow. 1'l1e ayerages of numerous obsen'atiom; i11 tlte middle latitudes 8how that this is the case. Professor I,oornis examined in the publishrd ,-olumes of the l;nited States Signal Service the directions of the surface winds and those of the clouds in a g-reat ma.ny cases in which there was a well-detined area of high pressure 011 the east side of thn area of low pressure within the limits of the rnited States. The result at which he arriYed was that the surface winds '' drculated around tlie low center, and at the same time mo>ed spirally inward. The upper clouds were in all ca8('S rnoYing away from thc> low center and towards an area of higll pressure on the cttst aud 1:muthe:tst side." (Silliman's Journal, July 187ti, p. l i.) Hence the motion was outward aboYe aud from a point to the right of that from which tlle surface winds blew. ObserYations on the clouds iu the hurricanes of the Antilles gaye also a similar result. The elouds in the different pmdtions of the Yortex ran almost perpendicular to its direction from tbe observer, showing that the wiuds at the altitude of tl1e clouds are less conyergcut than at the surface. It, was likewise olJSerYed by Sr. de Garn boa, Director dd "Diario de Cienfuegos," in the lmrricane of September, 187G, that the ,·duels at the ,;urface liad a greater inclination than the lowest clouds. (Apuntes, &c., p. 178.) Since it has been shown, botll from theory and ohspn·ation, that the air iu onlinaey cyclones moYes in toward the interior in the lower part of tlte atimosphem, it must of course move out from it in the upper regions, and tl1e incliuation be negatire, or outward. That this is the case is shown hy thP ta hie of results giv1·11 in § 41, ohtairn·d by Mr. Ley from bis ob1-1en·ations of the cirrus clomls. 'l'he aYerage of all the angles in this table for the upper currents and for all the districts is 1o!Jo, and hence grentpr than 900, and com;equently the direction is inclined outward 190 and then' i,; a motion of the air ahm·e out from tlie center. The angle of inclination of the surface win<h· gin~n hy the table is Zi'i 0 inward. Hence the difference between the average directions of the cmreuts above m11l at the surface is about 44°, those of the upper euneuts being to the right of those l1elow. 4H. The conclusions at which Dr. Hildebrandsson arrh'ed with regard to the upper currents of the atmosphere, from the sp10ptic charts of the Royal Meteorological Institute of Denmark, are the following:* "1. Tout pres du centre (l'uu depression ou minimum barometriq ne, Jes couraii ts superieurs Re monYent a pen pres da11s uue direction parallele aux isobars et aux vents inferieurs. "2. ~\ mesure qu'on s'eloigne du centre, ils sont plies en dehors et d1~Yies :I, droite des vents inferieurs. "3. Sur les regions des maxima ils CODYergent ,~ers leur centre en con pant les isobars a ]>ell pres :\ angles droits.'' The first of these confirms that part of the theory which require!'! a small angle of inclination near the ceuter, for unles8 this angle is small both below and above, since it must be positive below and negath·e above, the directions abovP and below cannot be nearly parallel. The second shows that further from the center the inclinations are greater, in accordance with theory, and hence there is a greater deYiation of the currents abo\'e to the right of those below. While the third is not in accordance with theory taken generally, it, will be shown, further on, that it is in most cases as a result of the effect of the progressi\·e motions of the air in the upper regions.

(LawR of the 'Yimls, 71. 15G.) Aceordin~ to thi,.; la,v, 1leclnced from obseryatiou, the directions of t11e higher currents incline outward from the center of low pressure and tangent to the isobars, as observed hy Dr. Hildebrandsson, an<l as theory requires. 50. In obseiTing· and stud.Ying the motion" of tlw upper cmTe11ts in cyclones it is important to take into consideration the results deduced from theory in~ 18, according to which, iu ordinary cyclonic systems, the p:yratory Yeloeities aboYe are less than helow, aud at gn,at altitudes may be even reversed over tlrn greater part or the whole C,Ycloni<· or low-pressure area uelow, and become anti-cyclonic instead of cyclonic. 'fhis seems to be con firmed h~- Mr. Ley's obserYations on the cirrus c1oud1'.

(Laws of' tlie \\"inds, p. 13H.) 1\fr. Le;y's dirf'ct and re~rogrnde circulations corre~pond to what we ha Ye denoted by autiC;\"Clonic and cyclonic gyrations, rf'spectivel,v, and it is readily seen from au inspection of Fig. I, in which the directions of tbe 11pper c·nrreuts are represeuted by dotted arrows, and the cliYiding line between the c.vclone aml auti-cyclonP indicated by a dotted circle. There is an oyerlapping of tl1e upper anti-cyclone o\·er tbc outer part of the c,rclone belo"-, and oYer tltis belt the wimls above and below are ver~· nearly or <]nit<' iu opposite directions, and hence the former are in opposition to Ballot's law 0Ye1· this belt. l\:lr. L<'y \"ery jnsUy rPma.rks tlw.t ''it is important to obserYc that these exam}J!es fnrni8h no proof that Ballot's law may not be tnw, or approximately so, in et:ery case, for the particular stratum of atmosphere to 1cliich U i., applied.'" Thi,.; ltas been sho"·11, in § 19, to be the case aceonling to the cyclone theory, since the distance of maximum pressm·e from the ceuter, in strata of different altitudes, decreases with the altitm1e; so that although tbe currents above may he nearl;\' in accordance with Ballot',; law if wt· me:cumre the pres,.,ure itt that altitude, yet if we. compare thern 'i\"ith the pressures at the surface all the upper currents obse1Ted from the belt, Fig. I, in which the anti·C!)clone aboYe overlaps the cyclone at tlie snrface, will be nearly in opposition to Ballot's law, if compared with the pres8ures at the earth's surfaee. 51. If we had a cyclone witli a cold center the area of eyclouic gyra,tions would be great.est above, and there would be a hfl1t in which tlte cyclonic gyrat.ions above would be seen over the gentle auti-c;rclouic one::; below. Although the conditions for a local progressive cyclone of this kind might exist tem[lorarily, arising- from the primary disturbances of tempe.rature, yet the.r could not give rise to much cyclonie activity, since the currents, downward in the int.erior and outward from the center at the ea1'th's stufac;\>, woulll be subject to grea.t friction, and the power in ordinary cyclones, arising from the caloric of condensation, would be entirely wanting. Observations, therefore, on local aml progressive cyclones of this sort have not been made to establish the truth of this latter law, the reverse of that obsl·rved l\Y Mr. I,ey in the case of ordinar;y cyclones. ·we ban·, however, two notable examples of stationary cyclonic 8ystems of thi:,; sort, in which the law is unmistakably obsen·ed. The northern and southern hemispheres of the globe fornish two systems of this sort with the cold centers at the poles of the earth. The cyclonic gyrations at the earth's surface extend to about the parallel of 35° or 30°, but at great altitudes they extend to the calmbelt at the equator, so that in the trade-wind region, where we haye below the anti cyclonic g;rrations around and from the center, we have above the c;vclonic around and toward the center. Hence the motion of the cirrus clouds of this region from the southwest is nearly or quite in exact opposition to that of the trade-winds below. 52. So far, in the consideratiou of upper currents, we have not taken into account the effect of the progressive motion of the air of a cyclone, which, combined with the cyclonic, gives the observed resultant, and this consequently may be very different from the purely c;yclonic; and this is especially the case at great altitudes in the middle latit.udes. These rootions are generally nearly from west to east, and the eastward components of the velocities of these motions, for the average

of all longitudes, may be approximately computed from the expressions of these velocities in Table XI, Part l. 'L'hese give for tlie latitude of the British Isles, say 5~10 for the eastward component of velocity per hour, at the elevation of 8 kilometers, which may be assumed to be the height of tlle cirrus cloudsIn January, 6.8km + 8 x 11.Skm = 101.2km In July, 4.2 + 8 x 5.3 = 46.6 and for tlie mean of the year about 74'rn. These estimates are based upon the assumption that the temperature gradient between the pole and the equator above is the same as at the earth's surface, but it ii,; probably less above, and if so these estimates ma~· be too great. There are also various disturbing causes which may make tliem vary consiuerably at different places on the same parallel of latitude. These estimates, however, gh·e at least approximate results, and show that these progressiYc Yclocities are quite large, and much more so in winter than in summer, both of wl1ich circumstances it is rnry important to take into consideration. If we assume that the progressive ,·eJocity aborn is 74km from west to east, and that the gyratory motion at an.'' ginm dii,;tance from the center is circular, and bas a velocity of 60'"' per hour, then on the soi1th si(le we shoul<l have an eastward Yelocity of 74 + 60 = 134k"' }ler hour, but on the north side only 74 - 60 = 14'"' per hour, aml there would be a motion fro1u some quarter of the west on all sides of the cyclone. At lower altitudes, where the progressive velocity is less, the resultant velocity might vanish on the north side, or there might be a small westward motion, but there would be upon the whole a great preponderance of westerly winds. Thi,; is in accordance witl1 Mr. Ley's observations of the cirrus clouds. He states that "the most Pkvated clouds not uncommonly traverse a distance of 120 miles an bonr, and occasionally much more. The majority of instances ill which very high velocities have been observed over the Britisli Isles were in autumn, winter, arnl spri11g, aml occurred when great but distinct depressions existed i11 the NE., in Scandinavia or Finland, and the 4lirection of the upper current was from the N"\Y. or NN\"\T. Calms, on the other hand, aro extremely uncommon in this elevated stratum, at least in those imitances in which it supports visible vapor. I ha,·e oul.'· once or twice observed au actual].'· motionless cirrus cloud. * · * A condition of baric equilibrinm in this stratum is com· monl.r most nearly approache(l in summer and near th<' center of areas of high pressure.'' (Laws of the ·winds, p. 1G3.) The great \·elocities over the British Isles were observed when there was a cyclone center in t!Je NK, for then the cyclonic motion coincided somewhat with the progressive motion from west to east. These large velocities did not occur much during the summer season, for then, as seen al>ovt', the progressiYe component is comparatively small, and the mag·nitu<le of the resultant uepemls ver.r much upon this. It is possible, also, that the cyclonic disturbances may ·be generally less at this season. Calms are said to be rare in these elevateu regions, as we would expect from tlwory, si11ce the progressive motion here is so great that it rarely happens that the g,yratory com· 1>oue11t is sufficient to cou11teract it and produce a calm on the left sitle of the cyclone in its pro· gre'1sio11. Again, this state of baric equilibrium l>elnnging to a calm in these regions, is most nearly reached in summer, because then the progressive eaistward velocity is much less, and hence less gyratory motion is required to produce a calm on the left, for unless tlie gymtor.Y motion equals the progressive, as we hM·e seen above, there must be an eastward motion on all sides. It follows, then, from what precedes, that a stationary, or nearl.Y stationar,y, coudition of tl.ie cirrus clouds iudicates in the northern hemisphere the existence of a cyclone center at some distance in a southerly direction from the place of observation, while an unusually great eastward velocity indicates the existence of one in some northward direction. In the southern hemispheres the directions are reversed. 53. Professor Loomis's discussion of observations of the United States Signal Serviee, made on the top of Mount Washington at the times of low barometer, gives the following velocities and inclinations of the wind (Silliman's Journal, January, 1875): --------------· "--- - ----------------------~------------~--------------------

A copy of tile graphic representation of tlleNe results is gh'en in Fig. 8. The progresl'iive motion deduced from tliese results is N. 650 \Y. 28 miles per hour, of wliicli the eastward component is 2fl.4 miles. B_y Table XI, Part l, this component i11 open Kpace at the height of }1ount Washington would he oul;\· about W milei;, hut tlte current on Mount \Yasliington i,.; increased b,v the air from lower leYels having tu paiss over tl1e mountain range. \\'ithont going i11to an aecurate discussion of the results, it may lie rea(lily found approximately that the reRultanb' aboYe are those given by a g_yratory velocity of 30 miles with an inclinati011 of 10°, combined with the progressi,·e motion, given abo,·e. A graphic representation of tlie rcl'lnltauts by this asHnrnptiou is gh-en in Fig. 9, which coincide very nearly with those of Fig. 8~ and lH'nce the winds on Mount \Yashington, for low barometer are satisfactorily explained by tlle 11ypotl1esis that they resnlt from a gyratory or cyclonic motion combined with a large progres8iYe motion. In order to study the laws of tlie winds on ~fount \Vashiugton. Professor Loomis selected, from the published volumes of the United States Si1.rnal ScrYic1· ob.sen·atio11r-;, ,t;-H, cases in which the wind blew wit,h a velocity of Gii miles or more per· hour. As these 11ig-h ,-eJocities must occur mostl.,Y when the direction of tlle g-yrator.v motion coincides some\Yhat with that ot tlle progressive motion, theE'e velocities occur more frequently in winter than in summer, l11~ca11se thP progTessive component of Yelocity, upon which the re1mltant velocit;\- largely depends, is greatest in the former RPason, jtrnt as in the case of the motions of the cirrus clouds observed h~- :\lr. 1.e;\·. Professor Loomis's res11lts from observation give the following vroportional numbers for tlle 01·c·urrence of strong winds on Mount "''ashingtou iu the several seasons of the ;\'ear: Spring, 14.0: 8ummer, 9.2; autumn, 13.8; winter, 21.2. It is seen that the nnmtier of caRt~s of large ,·elocitiel' is more tbau twice as great in winter as in summer, which show8 tlrnt at least oue of tlw component,; of motion, eitller the cyclonic or progressh·e motion, is much greater in winter thau in ,;ummer\ As only high velocities were here consi1le1·ed, it is eYident th~tt these must have been mostl;v from some westerly point, iu which easel". the two compo11euts of motion in some measure coincide in direction. Accordingly the number of cases in which the "\\·ind blew from the se,·eral points of the compass iu these high velocities was" N. 53, X\Y. :!60, \V. ()3, SW. 27, S. 14, SE. 8, K 2, and NE. 7. Thus we see that 60 per cent. of all tlie hig-h winds e<Hlle from the X\Y.; 75 per cent. from the W. and .X\V.; 87 per cent. came from the \Y., ~\Y., and N., while only +per eeut. came fro:n the NE., E., and SE." (Sillimau's Journal, Ja11uar,y, 18TU.) From an examination of 121 cases of l1igh winds on ~fonnt \\'ashington, Professor Loomis deduced Ute following c011clusions: "1. lligh winds on Mount "Tashington circulate about a low center as they do near the le\'el of the sea. 2. 'l'he motion of the winds is IH'arly at right angles to the directio11 of" the low ceuter. 3. The low center at the height of l\Ionut \Yasbington sometimes lieR behind the low center at the surface of the earth as much a.s two hundred mile~1.'' The fhst two of tllese conclusions is exaetly in accordance with the c;n~lonic theory, the second one showing that the inclination at ~onsiderahle altitudes is small, as was obserYed in the hurricanes of the Antilles, and as required by the theor>· in § 10 (11). Fm the laRt of these <'onelusious theory does not seem to ti.rrnish auy explanation. 54. A similar examination was made of the obsen·ations of tlte· Sigmil Senice on the top of Pike's Peak, and the same general results obtained. (Si11ima11's Journal, .January, 187!1, p. 19.)

The ]>roportional numbers of these cases for the several ;ieasoni,; of the year are: Spring, 15.7; summer, 11.3; autumn, 26.5; winter, 31.2. Heuce there are nearly three times as maIJy cases in winter as in summer. The number of cases in which the wind blew from the different directionH at the times of these high velocities are: N. 28, NW. 47, "'· 154-, SW.111, S. 18, SE. l, E. O, NE. 4. According to these results, the prevailing direction of the winds on the top of Pike's Peak, as on the top of Mount \Vasbington, is from some westerly poiut, showing· tliat there is a large progresi>ive motion of the wiml from the west, or ne.arly, which is ofteu verJ- much modified by cyclonic motions superadded, which change the direction and velocity of the regular progressive motion, but which rarely so entirely counteract and reverse it as to gh-e rise to a wind from l'lOlllC easterly direction. The total number of winds from SE., E., an<L NE. during a 1ieriod of three years, from observations made three times a day, was: Spring, 64; summer, 130; autumn, 86; winter, 30.

at the altitnde and latitufle of Pike's Peak, as given by Table XI, Part 1, is little more than one-third as p,Ti>at as in tlie winter, aud l1e11ce in tlrn summer this eastward motion is more readily overcome and reversed, and an eaio;t wind produced. From the great difii:·reuce ill the frequency of easterly winds in the winter and summer season, Proft-s~or Loomis iufen; that "these winds are dependent on difference of temperature more than 011 difti>rence of pn'sl'nl'('.'' This difference, we baye seen, is explained by the greater west eom· ponent of the winds ill winter tban in summer, resulting from the greater velocity of the progress· h-e l'astwanl motion in the forn1er than the latter season, and althongl1 this depends upon the ~r ternperatttrt> g:raclierit between the pole and the equator in winter than in summer, there is <~rr«'>·q101Hli11g diftl 1·p11ee in the baronH'tric gradients, if these gradients were determined &om the atmosplip1·ic prpssnre at the altitude of Pike's Peak, as they should, as bas been staterl in § 50, and not at tl1t' ('aJ'th's surface. Although in the northern hemisphere at the earth's surface there is cml_y a small lmrometrie gradient at any latitude hetween the pole and the equator, yet at the altitude of Pikt":,; Peak, or even of the summit of Mount Washington, the pressure gradient is large, and he11cc tile large eastward progressive velocity of the air. If from the nearly equal baronwtric pre:,;snrl's of tlrn pole aud tlle equator at tlle earth's imrface we subtract the weight of a colmn11 of air of the heigl1t of Pike's Peak, and of tl1e temperature of the polP- and the equator from the nearly equal pressures at the pole and the equator, it leave,,; at this altitude a great difference of barometric pressure between the pole and the equator, and consequently there is at this altitude a h1rge baromPtrie gradient, requiring a correspondingly Jarf:!e eastward velocity, and this mu.st increase with the altitude and lie much greater in winter than in summer, as given by Table XI, Part I, which is based upon tbis principle. 55. \Ye come now to the examination of the results obtained by Mr. Ley from observations of thti upper currents already gi\·en in the table in § 41. From a mere inspection of the angles given in this talJle for the several 1listrit1ts it is readily seen that the.'! result from a large progressive motion of the atmosphere in the <lirection, or nearly so, of the motion of the center of the low-pressure area, combi11ed with a gyratory or cyclonic motion around this center, having a coni>iderable outwa.rd or negative inclination. J,et A, B, O, &c., in Fig. 10, be ·the centers of the several outer dis· tricts, a::i rcprcsen ted in Fig. 6, and let A a, Ba, Ca, &c., represent the velocities of gyratory motion, having an outward inclination uf about 30°; and also let ab represent the velocity of progressive motion of the upper atmospl1ere in the direction of the progressfre motion of the center of low- · pre1Ss11re area, represented by t.he arrow, and let us suppose that this laUer velocity is very nearly equal to that of the gyrator.v velocity Aa, Ea, &c. The resultants will then be represented by Ab, B b, Cb, &c. It hi readily seen that the effect of the progressive component is to increase the angles with the radius in tlle front and to diminish them in the rear, just aR in the case of the c~·clo11es of the Autilll's represented by Fig. 7, except that the progressive velocity in this case is so great in comparison with the c,vclmiic that the effect upon the angles is Yery much greater, and is similar to the effect upon these angles on the summit of Mount ashington, as represented by Fig. 8. Upon this hypothe11is the largest angles should be those of the districts B, C, and D, and the flmallest tl10i:e of F, G, and H. By a reference to the column of" Mean Angles with Radius" belongiug to the upper currents of the outer districts, § 41, it is seen that this is precisely in accordance with obsen-ation. In \·ague obser\'atious of this sort, it cannot, of course, be expected that any hypothesis wouM give an,r nice agreement with obserYation in quantitatiYe results. The preceding hypothesis, the anglet-1 and ratios of which are represented in Fig. 10, makes the angles a little too large in tlie rear district,,;, but this agreement could be improved by assuming a less progressiYe velocity ab. For the int(·rior districts the angles given by observation are less, and hence for the.se a n~ry small angle of inclination outward would have to be assumed in order to make the resultants reprei1e11t tlrn obsel'vations; aml this would be exactly in accordance witl1 the results obtained by Dr. Hiklebramlssou for the regions near the center of low area. Also, the gyratory vel.-Ocity is perhaps somewliat greater in tl1ese districts near the center. A diagram similar to that of Fig. 10, with these modifications, would likewise give angles agreeing, as well as could be expected, with those given by the obser\·ations, in which, as in the case of the outer districts, the larger angles are in the front and the smaller ones in the rear districts. It is seen from Fig. 10 that the resultant velocity in the district A is very small, and consequently the average angle from observation very uncertain. In fact the progressive velooity so

nearly counteracts the cyclonic that this must be a district, on the average, of calms rather than of currents. This is in accordance with the ohsen·ation of :\Ir. Ley, wl10 with regard to this district remarks that "the upper current, which had pre\'iously nearly coi nci<led in direction with the trajectory, presentl,Y changes, as a rule, to a nearly opposite point, h:tving just before become very slow. In the interval the cinns, wlw11 visible, which is rarely the ca;;e, is sometimes stationary, sometimes moves toward and so1netimes from the center of tlepre:ssion, the:m three instances being nearly equally common, but calms and motions toward tlie eente.r llTedomiuating." (Quar. Jour. Met. Soc., Oct.ober, 1877, p. 443.) If these important ohservat10ns had been anal_yzed with reganl to the sPasonl'l, they might have afforded some valuable results for com1iari;;o11 with tlleory. .Mr. I1ey, howtJver, makes one remark iu his paper which has a bearing on this subject. He says: "I haYC found that in winter \ery loral depressions, even when deep, scarcely affect tbe direction of the eirrus currents in their \icinity, the latter continuing to be governed by the mm·e general ·lil'.tribntiou of atmospheric pressures. Curiously enough, this is not the case in summer." This is completely explainecl h~- the result, deduced first from theor,\·, and then confirmed, as we have seen, by the obserYatious on the summits of Mount "\Vm;hingtou antl Pike's Peak. that the progTessh-e ea:stward Yelocity of tlie upper atmosphere is very much gTeater in winter than in summer. Ju winter thii.; Yelocit,v is so great in comparison with the c_yclonic disturbances that the directiorn,; are uot greatl,'I· affected by them, but thiR is not the case with the comparntivel;v slow progressfre motions of tll~~ l'lHmmer season. 56. In view of what has been shown in the p1·e1·eding S(~ction, it does not seem necessary to resort to the hypothesis of au inclination of the vertical axis of a eycloue backward in order to explain the observed directions of the upper currents of the atmosphere in the areas of low barometric pmssure. Ina.'lmuch as we know that the progressin> motiou of the upper strata is greater tban that of the lower ones, this 11,vpotbesis of ..\Ir. Le.r's is so mnch at variance with mechanical principles, and witb what we would naturally i11fer would take plact' nuder snch circumstances, tbat we shouhl hesitate to adopt it witl10ut seeking further for some more plausible hypothesis to explain the observations. These, as we liaYe seen, seem to be satisfactoril~· explained b_y combining the large progressive motions of the upper regions of the atmosphere with the ( ,\'du11ic, aml this progressive motion is not a mere b,rpotbesis, but a result deduced fro111 tl1eof".\· and coufirrned by numerous ol>servations. It is true that Mr. Ley's h.nmthesis recei\-es some support from tlie somewhat 1·emarkable 1·esults obtained by Professor Loomis from the obt'lervations of the Unite(l States Sigua1 Ser\·ice on the summits of Mount "\Vashington, Pike's Peak, and l\lount Mitchell (Sillimau's .Journal, Jan., 1879), according to which the maxima and minima of the barometl'i('. ehangPs appear to occur later at the summits than at tl1e bases of these mountains, which Mr. Ley explain;; hy his hypothesis. (Quar. Jour. .Met. Soc., Jul.)', 187!1.) But tliese results of Profo8sor Loomis Rh ow too much for this hypothesis, for they show that t.\iere is a. Rimilar retardation, of just a.bout tlie same amount, in the times of the maxima and miniina of tlJc 1linr11al cha11ges of barometric pressure at tbe snm· mits of these mountains, and we cannot reasorntbly explain this by meam; of <'scloues with re.cliui11g axes. When we shall have a satisfactory explauation of this retardation in thi1:1 latter case, we shall probably have one in the other. · 57. Many important practical applications may be mrtde of what we barn now Jearnerl, both from theory and observation, with regard to the motion;;; of the upper currents of the armosplumi. These, as we have seen, arc the resultants of the general motions of the a.tmosphen>, and of those of progressive cyclon~s arising from local and temporary disturbances. The former change with the s<:>asons, and are considerably mo(lified hy the local and permanent irregulal'it-ics iu the distri· bution of temperature, which is different in differe11t longitudeR, and girn rise to the approximate conditions of large permanent an<l stationary cyclones, treated of further on, and these produce some irregularities in the directions of the general permanent currents of the upper regions. With a knowledge of these on the different parts of the globe, and at the different seasons of the year, an observer is enabled to recognize the effect of any cyclonic disturbance, eyeu when the Yortex of the cyclone is yet at a great distance, b~' its etfed upon the known reguhir currents.

The almost uuiversal precursor of a distant cyclone is the appearance of more cirrus clouds than usual, not onl:v differing from those of the general current8 in form, but also in the direction of the currents indicated b,v the8e clom1;;. 'L'he approach of c,rclones from the E. or SE. is always indicated at Havana b~· the appearance of these clouds wheJJ the vortex is yet 500 miles or more distant, and while fair weather is ~'et, pnwailing.

Here the, dirediolls of the currellts as indicated by the cirrus clouds seem to be very nearly radial, aH they shoulil be by theory in these low latitudes, and at great distan-0es from the center, and hence tue direction from which tlw,Y come indicates very· nearl;v the directiou of the \'Ortex of the cyclone. In these low latitudes the progressive motion of the atmosphere above is small in tlie cyclone season and dot>,; not interfore much witl1 the directions ginm hy regular cyclonic motions. In higher latitudes the cyclonic motions, referred to the progressive center, are more nearly circular, and the 1n·ogre8sin~ motion, commm1 to the center and the whole of the atmosphere in tue upper regions, modifies Yery mnch the directions of the currents as they would exist from the effect of cyclonic disturbances alone. \Vitlliu the cyclonic area, and area of low barometei·, they would gh·e the re1mltant motiolls as obsen·ecl by }fr.

But in tbis area the motions of the upper currents are often hid by the lower clouds, and besides cyclonic disturbances in thitS art>a are usually more certainly indimited by surface currentR aud the currents iudicated by the lower clouds which usually exist. so that usuall,\' it is only the observation of the cirrus clouds at a considerable di;;tance from the center, beyond the limits of tl1e lower cloud area, that is of advantage in c1et,ermilling the existence ancl direction of cyclones, and at this distance, it sboulcl be remembeTed, tl1e cyclonic motions of the upper regions, according to theory, may not only become ra1lial, as obser,·e1l at tl1e Antilles, but eYen anti c,\·clonic. Any derangements, then, in the mmal dirrctimrn of the upper current,;, indicated bJ· tlle cirrus clouds, will indicate the existence of diRtant cyclonic disturbances before tl1ey are indicated by surface winds or clouch.; in the lower strata, 1mt the exact llirectio11 of the cyelmdc center will be left tSomewhat uncertain, though it will gt~nerally he founcl nearly in the direction from which these upper currents proceed, when the obserrnr is in front of the cyclorw, and conRequently most in danger, since then the progressive mot.ion above, as seen from Fig. IU, combines with the nearl~' radial cyclonic motion and leaves little uncertainty with rrgard to the direction. To an;y one familiar with the usual appearances of the cirruR clouds aml the dired.ioas of the upper currents indicated b~' them, and whose duty and interPl'\t it iR to watch for the tir,;t inclications of any unusual abnormal disturbances of the atmosphere, a study of tlie eflt>cts of distant cyclonic disturbances upon these upper currents must be of great im1iorta11ce, not ouly in furnishing an explanatioJJ of them, but likewise the first indica· tions of approaching danger. 58. \Yith regard to the existence of au anti-cyclur1e in conneetiou with every cscloue and tbe broad ammlus of high barometer with its maximum at the dividing limit between the cyclone and anth~yclone, ais show11 in ~ l~, we haYe many confirmatory observations. But 8inee the maximum height of the lmrometer iR generallr lmt little abO\·e the undisturbed normal height beyond the disturbed area, and the gradient of the anti-cyclone is small, and the corresponding winds only very gentle ones, and arc n~ry mueh interfered with and masked by numerous other irregularities, clPpc111li11g u1>on Yarious caul\es, the annulus of high barometer and the winds of the anti-cyclone are not readily distingniished 011 a synoptic chart, and separated from the other irregulari;ies. The chartis of lmrometric pres~mre an<l of the wiI1dtS, giYen in Part I of these Researches, represent the irregularitit·s of pressnre upon which those of tl1e systems of c,yclone and anti-cyclone are super· imposed, and bpnce wlwre the inequalities of' pressure belonging to both are charted together a regular broad anuulm; of high baromeh T i~ not generally shown by the h1obars. As an illustration we may suppose a circular area of uneYeu laud to be inclosed by a wall of the same height on all Ridel', yet if this heigllt were referred to a leYel plane, it would not be uniform, but have its maxima and miuima. The C;\'Clonic systems, also, are often irregular in themselves, and sometimes two or more iuterfne with oue another, a ntl tlms cause still greater confusion. An unusually high barometer, however, is usually observed a few days before and after the

passage of an area of low barometer. indicating that it is snrrounrled h.'' such an annnlns. ProfesRor Loomis examined the origin and progress of 44 storms in the 1::-nitPd States h;\- means of the ohserva.tions of the pnbli;,hed volumes of the Signal Service. He s<lys: "The first stage iu the deYelopment of each of thesf' storms was an area of sm·eral hundred miles ill diameter on·r which the height of the barometer differed hnt little from thirt;r inches with an ar<c>a of high barometer both on the east and west sides aml at a distance of about 1,000 miles. * "" "' On Hoft'me~·er's storm charts we frequently find three areas of high barometer, and occasioually four areas of l1igh barometer, surronndiug an area of low barometer." (Silliman's .Jourual, ,Jammr.v, 1878, pp. iJ-6.) Again, he says: "Tl1e areas of high barometer, which uniformly mark the commencement of a storm, im·ariably attend it during its progmis;; e,a,st ward.'' During the progress of tl1est:> storms the average lieight of barometer on the east side was 30.39 incheH, all(} mi tlie wt:>st side 30.3'.? inches. These areas of liigh barometer around the area of low barometer are simply tlw a111111lus of high barometer somewhat lwoken up and interfered with by the rn,riom1 clisturbauccs already mentioned. The reasou that an area of high barometer is especiall.r ob!:lt>l'Yt>d Oil the east and west sides of an area of low barometer in tlie United States, is that tl1ere i:-; a somewhat regular succession of cyclones following after oue another in the middle latitndPis, so tlmt the high liarometer of the rear of the 011e and the front of the other fall together and make the height of the areas of high barometer on tl1e east and west sides twice as grnat as on the other sides, and hence especially prominent and observable. Areas of high pressure were usually fou11d to be accornpanied by areas of low pressure 011 the east, and west sides at an a\·erage distauce of about 1,:mo miles. 'l'he a,rea of hig·h barometer occurred much more freqneutl;r m1 the east than the ·1rnst side, and in a direction about 20° S. of E. 'l'liis is due to an area of high barometer, indepflulent of the local progressh·e c~·clones, lying in the Atlantic in that direction, as is seeu from Chart I, Part I, so that tliis Ride of tlie annulus was always, as it were~ on liiglier gl'Onml, and this is especially the case in the summer season when the barometer in the interior is about 4"'· below the average, which causes a considerable gradient in that direction, as seen from Chart Y 1, Part I. Loomis also found from Hoffmcyer's charts tbat in about three-fourths of the cases examined the direction of tile area of bigb pressure from the low is SE. and the aYerage distauce about 1,700 miles. In Norway ancl Sweden there is a considerable ascemliug gra<lieut in thi;; dircction, as seen from the charts referred to above, and hence, for the reasons just giyeu, in the case of America11 cyclones the highest part of the annulus of high barometer, when referred to a le\·el plane, is iu that direction. 5\l. On the ocean the cyclonic systems ai·e more regular, so that here, if we had a sufficient number of accurate observations, the annulus of high barometer and the winds of tLte anti-c:nJlune, could be more readily tlisti11g11ished from the other irregularities, especially witLiu the tropics where these irregularities are smaller. Hence in the Antilles, where the islands, bei11g mostly small iu comparison with the expanse of oceal around them included within the cyclone, do not iuterfere much with the regularity of the cyclonic system, the annulus of high barometer is readily ol1sern'd, and the approach of the cyclone center indicated several days in adYance of its arrh·al by the riising of the barometer above its normal lm'el. The approach of !he hurricane of September, 1875, was indicated at Havana by a sudden rise of the barometer while the cyclone was yet at the Windward Islands, about 1,200 miles distant. Also, on the 13th of September, 187u, there was a great rise of barometer at Havana while a cyclone was causing great destruction in the islaml of Porto Rico. (See Apuntes, &c., pp. 117-118.) We may suppose the situation of Havana with regard to the cyclone in both these cases to have been at a, Fig. 11, in which the hP,avy circle re1nesents the highest part of the annulus of high barometer. Hence there was a rising barometer as the cyclone advanced toward the \YX\V. and Ha,·ana came under th~ maximum pressure of the annulus. Iu the first case nothing is s;iid with regard to the direction of the wind, but in the latter the wind was from tLte south, as required by theory in that part of the cyclone. With regard to the last it is further stated (p. 127) that "during the past night (of the 14th and 15th) we have rapidly departed from the area of maximum barometer, with the wind to the NNE." Havana was then within the dh·iding limit between the cyclone and anti-cyclone, and hence the barometer was fallmg and the wind had chang·ed around from S. to NNE., as it should, as may be seen from Fig. 11.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT 01'' THE

On the 23d of September, 1877, after the announcement of a hurricane on the 21st, among the islands of Rarba<los, San Vincente, and Grenada, the barometer Rtood at Ha\ana at the unusual height of 764""", the 'vind from the E., and aftenYard inclining to the NE. la this case we may suppose the situation of Havana in relation to the cyclone to have beer.; at 21, :Fig. 11, on the 21st of September, aucl at 23 on the 2:~d, under the greate;;t pressure of the annulus of high barometer. The track of the center of this cyclone, with the positiorn; of its center each day, is given in Fig. 12, which i;; a copy of a part of the Weather ~lap of tlie United States Signal Service for October, 1877. The position of Hayana iu the cyclone, as obtained from this map, for each of the last days of September and the first part of October, must haYe heen nearly as iudicated by the numher8 in Fig. 11, corresponding to the dates. As the dimensions of the c.'-done gradually increase as it a<l.Yances, the distance8 from the center in the figure are not absolute but merely rela· th-e to the increasing dimensions, so that we must suppose the tigure to represent a larger area, and consequently the same distance from the center in the figure to represent greater di8tances in the latter days of the cyclone than in the fir.;;t ones. Tbe a1TOW8 in the figure represent the directions of the wind according to theory, making ;.;ome allowance for the effect of a progressive motion, which would diminish the iuclinations on the N\V. side and increase them on the SE side. Ou the 21st and 22d we have 8een that Havana was in the anti-cyclone, and on the 23d under the middle of the amrnlus of high pres8nre. ~We furtller read (Apunte8, &c., p. lW) that on the 25th the wind was N. and NNE., very near!.'- as required h;r theory, as seen from Fig. 11. The barometer continued gradually to fall in HaYarm until the morning of the 2ith, aml during that morni11g tlwre were irregularitie8 in the diurnal oscillation. On the 28th, the barometer continued fluctuating irregularl.v without au.v decided tendency to either rise or fall. The wind was at the E. and ENE., fresh, and with variable intensity. By a reference to Fig. 11 it i;; seRn that on the 2ith the 8ituation of Havana was very nearly at the shortest di:;tancR from the center of the cyclone, and that during this day and the next this distance remained nearly the same, and hence the barometer had no decided tendency t,o either rise or fall, as was observed. On the 2Stli, it is stated, the wind was a little N. of E., as required l1y theory. .After thi8, the wind changed to the south aad then tile west, and finally, on the 6th of October, after the whole system had passed, and the uosition of Havana was in the anti-cyclone, it is stated that the wind was from the north. Theory would require the wind here to be rather from the NE., hut the directions of tlle gentle winds of the a.nticyclone are very mueh chauged hy slight abnormal disturbances. We see that according to theory the wind, which on the 25th was a little E. of N. should afterwards change around to E., tl1en S., tbe11 W., and finally in the anti-cyclone, on the 6th of October, to NE. Accordingly it is stated that from the 25th of September to the 6th of October, when a north wind was prevailiug, the wind-vane made a direct complete gyration from N. hy E. to 8.-'N., N. (Apuntes, &c., p. 12i.) If the central path of this hurricane had been on the NE. side of Havana, the line of the relatiYe position;; of Havana with reference to the center would have been on the other side of the center of the figure, and it is readily seen that the changes of the wind would have been very different. In all cases in which the track of a progressive cyclone is a straight line, the relatiYe positions of a stationary observer with regard to the center are also a straight line. If this line pas8eS through the center of the cyclone the greate:;t change of barometric Jffessure is observed, and at the passage of the center there is a very sudden change of the wind, after the short citlm during the passage of the central part, to the opposite direction. If this line passes at either side at some distance from the center, the barometric change is not so great and the veering of the wind is not so sudden nor through so many points of the c-0mpass; and the direction in which the wind veers depends upon which side of the observer the centu of the cj·clone passes. If this line passel'\ near or entirely be;}-ond the limit bet ween the cycloue and anti-cyclone there is only a slight rise of the barometer observed, which is at its maximum when the center of the cyclone is nearest to the observer, and there is no depression observed below its normal position. In all cases in which the position of the observer changes, as in tlie case of a ,·essel at sea, of course this must be taken into account also in la;ying down the positions of the obserYer with regard to the center of the cyclone, a.nd in determining or explaining the successive changes of t.he wind. Theory would also give a veering of the wind in the same way, as at and near the center, when the observer passes from the cyclone into the anti-cyclone, but th(! winds belonging to the anti-cyclone are so gentle, and consequently

so liable to be deranged, or eveu completels reversed, hy slight abnormal disturbances, that this veering is often uot ohserYed, at lea;.;t in C,Ydones on land. 60. The annulus of high barometer surrounding every cyclone, as deduced from theory, i;; not only llhown from ohsen·ations of unmmally high barometer before and after the pas,.;age of cyclones, both in the United StateR aud tlw Antilles, and from Hoffmeyer's charts, but it is often indicated by the double veering of the wind during the pa&sage of the whole sJ·stem over the ohsen·er. \Ye bave also eddence of thi;; ammlns from obser\'atiom; in the southern hemisphere. The gales observed by tlw exploring part~- of the Challenger at Kerguelen "were }>receded b:v an unusually high bflrometer, which fell rapidly as the storm began from the north; as the wind shifted to the wPst the barometer rm;e.'' (Qnar ..Tour. l\Iet. Soc., ,·ol. ii, p. 2i7.) So common are these areas of hig·lJ prPssure before aml after cyclones at sea that it is thought by some that cyclonp;; often lie hPtweeu wave;; or higl1 pressure. Captain Toynbee says he bas notice1l "that cyclonic winds were formed, as it were, in the hollows of wa,·es of pressure, in which cases the ridges triweled with the c:vclone1'! and formed, as it were, pa.rt of them. In many cases the ridges, with their corresp011ding wirnls, ext emle<l over many more degrees of latitude than the cyclones tbemseh·es; in fact, the.'-· with their inten·ening lwllow;; frecp1ent1_'.· passetl oYer us, causing winds veering from S. to N'IV., which were- not cyclones at all." (Qnar. Jour. :\'let. Soc., vol. h·, p. 14.) It would be difficult to explaiu, upon any k11ow11 principles, the existence of mere longitudinal ridges of high presRure; but that there is sucll a ridge surrounding evers e~·clone we have seen is strictly in accordance \dth well-known mechanical principles as de,·eloped in the tl1eory of c.vclones. Hence, it would seem to be morn probable that the ohse1Ted apparent ridges above referred to are merely parts of the annulm; of high barometer, obsen·ed on the east and west sides of the cyclone, in its progress from west to east, or perh,1ps most generally of a succession of such cyclones; in which case the ridges on the em<t and we8t si<les would he especiall.r prominent, jnst as in the case of the sueces8ion of <'yclones passing o\·er the 1::-nited States, in which~ as shown by Professor Loomis, there is apparently a. pretty reguhn l'i11cce;;sion of such riclges, with low barometer and a veering of the winds between them due to 8nch a succession of cyclones. A8 the maximum of the annulus of high l>arometer entirely snrronuds the cyclone at some distance from its limit of unusual violence of the wind at the earth's surface, these apparent longitudinal ridges would seem to extud .,oYer more degrees of fatitrnle than tlw cyelonPs themselves, as stated by Captain Toynl>ee. 61. It is important to e\·er,Y rrnvigator to know that a c;relone is always surrounded b.r an annulus of 1111m;uall~· high barometer, and that he cannot get within the limit of its dangerous part without passing througl1 this annnlu8; for the observation of this on any part of the ocean by means of the barometer may on tliis account he often a first indication of an approaching cyclone while yet the weather i1' fair aud calms an1 prevailing, just as in the case of the stationary obsen"er at HaYana, who, as he comes under tht· ad\'a11ci11g annulus of unmmally high barometer, knows that a c~·clo11e is coming in the distance. But in order to know when the barometer is abnormally high on any part of the ocean, he must know what is the normal height of his barometer at the place where he is aud at the time of the ;rear; for from a reference to. the charts of barometric pressllre in Part I of these Hesearcl1es, it is seen that this is \'ery differeut in difierent parts of the globe, and at the same place at different 81:'asons of the ;rcear. Thm;e charts, boweYer, were not intended for that, purpose, for the;r do not ha,·e the necessary accuracy onr the ocean generally for the want of sufficient ohsernttions, and the time has not arrived yet for constructing such charts, but obserrntions are now beiug collected from almost all partR of the ocean, and the time is perhaps not far distant wlwn such charts ean be constructed with the requisite accuracy. Such a chart might be giYen for each month from whfoh the 11avigator could at once get the normal height of the harometer for the time and place; or all the necessarJ data for obtaining this by a very simple calculation might be gh·en in two charts of the form of Charts I and III, Part I, for the northern hemisphere. It ha.s been shown in Part I that the barometric pressure P may be expressed. with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes by the first two terms of (26), which are

P =Bo+ B1 cos (\0 - E 1 )

in which Il 0 is the mean barometric pressure and B 1 the amplitude of the annual inequality. A Yalue for E 1 eonld perhaps be obtained which would be sufficiently accurate for all parts of the ocean. The valne of rp could be given in a table, say for each tenth day of the year. 'Vith the value of B 0 taken from a chart of the form of Chart I, referred to above, and the value of B 1 from one of the form of Chart III, the value of P would be readily obtained. Such charts for practical purposes oft.his sort should be given for pressures not reduced to gravity of the parallel of 450. 'l'he amplitude of the next and neglected term in the expression of P above is shown from obsen·ation to be generally considerably less than one millimeter, which will perhaps be only of abont the onler of the protmble errors of the values of Bn and B 1, which can evflr he obtained from obsen·ation and giYeu in charts. 6'.J. 'Vi th rega!'d to the general enlargement of cyclones, in accordance with § 21, this has been fully established by R.e<lfield in the case of the well.developed c;vclones originating in the torrid zone and cun·iug around by Florida, and progressing then toward the N. arnl NE. up into high latitudes. In those iu which the prngrnsshTe motion iR very nearly from west to east in the middle and higher latitudes this i8 not so much the caRe, for there is a limit beyond which the power of the cyclone cannot make itself folt on accouut of friction, and this is often reached before they come within the ;.;phere of obsen·ation. Also, there is generally in these latitndeR a succession of cyclones, aR we haYe seen, which interferes with tlteir continued expansion into very great dimensions. (i3. \Ve now come to the consideration of the formuhe in§ 14, showing the relation between the barometrie gradient tl au<l the corresponding vclocitieR of the wind, and the comparison of the results given by these formul:l' with obsen·ation. It should be borne in mind here that these formuh-p are based on the c_yclone theory, with certain assume1l regular conditions, which would gh-e motions entirely :,;ymmetrical 011 all sides; and het1ce when the conditions do not have this assumed regularity a nice agr~-ement between theory and observation cannot he expected. Although the tt>mperatnre disturbances giving rise to wirnls and barometric gradients ma;y generally hM·e somt· central point of maximum temperature with gradients of increasiI1g temperature out· ward from this center, ;yet this is generally far from completely conforming to the regular gradients assu1111·tl in the theoQ-, and tltis is especially the case in small temperature distnrhances with corresponding: small velocities of the wind. In well·developed cyclones, in which the temperature arnl barometric gradients are large and the motions on all sides nearly Rynunetrical, the regular conditions of the theory are more nearly approximated, and hence in these the formulm should give relatious rnoRt 11early iu accordance with observation. In all cases, however, for reasons already given iu § :~c, tlm formula· can be best tested by a comparii,;on with ohservation when the averages of a great nurnuer of obsen·ations are used, since then rnoRt of the abnormal irregularities may be eliminated from the a,·eragco;. 64. As an example of the application of (18) in a special case of large barometric gradient and velocit.Y of tlie wind, and also as au imperfect test of the accurac~· of the formula, we may take the great Scottish hnrrimme of the 24th of .Tannary, 1868."' From observations of the barometer at noon of '11l111rsday at Aberdeen and Culloden, it was found that there was a difference of one inch i11 1:'.8 miletl, ghing a gradient of0.5 inches very nearly. As tllis is a car,;e in which the gyration iR near the center and ver,v rapid, and also in a high latitude, we may suppose that the value of i is so small that we can put cos i = l wit.bout sensible error. We may also put for January, f= o, for a large error in the temperature prodnces only a very small effect. The value of r ii not known, bnt we shall put it at Hm milet:i. Since the elevation above sea level is small we can put I'= P'. Putting, therefore, in the formulre r = 160, cos i = 1, t =0, ''' = 90 - lat.= 320, and P = P', from (22), which mast be used in this case, since the unit of clistance is one mile and of time one hour, we get a= 71.24, b = 30473. With these values of a and b, and the value of G = 0.5 inches, we get from (20), for the Yelocity of the wind, s = 92.9 miles. The anemometer at Culloden gave a velocit~· from 90 to !H miles per hour. This example, however, should be regarded rather as an example of the application of the formula than as a test of its accnracy, for the gradient above, as

determined from the two stations, may not have been the exact gradient at Ctllloden where tbe velocity was observed, but ratber at some point midway between, and the value of r has been so assumed as to make the result of the formula agree \cry nearly with observation. V\'ith a larger or smaller value of r the result would be different, aml the test in the case consists in the reasonableness of the assumed vahte of r under all the circumstances. \Ve can only iufer that in ·an extreme case like this the formula giYes a velocity which is most probably, at least approximately,

correct.
From the data given by Padre Yiiies, obtained from observations of the cyclone of October,
1876 (Apuntes, &c., p. 112), we get at the distance of 60 nautical miles from the center a gradient of 13.Smm or 0.54 inches. With this gradient, putting r = 69.5 miles, t = 250, i = 300, P = P', and latitude= 22°.5, we get, as in the preceding example, from (18) and (22), for the velocity of the wind per hour, s = 78 miles. There may be considerable uncertainty with regard to the value of i to be used in this latitttde and so near tlie center, and the result, when the value of i is small,

depends very much upon this value. The velocities differ some, as we have 11ee11, on different sides of the cyclone, but as the gradient was obtained from observations on both sides, the formula gives a mean of the velocities at the time of obser\'ation. 65. In Silliman's Journal for January, 18i8, Professor Loomis has given a table of results depending upon the averages of great numbers of observations of Yelocities, directions, and gradients, obtained from the weather charts of the United States Signal Service for the years 1873 and 1874, from which the observed average velocities in the followiug table, corresponding to the barometric gradients in the first column, are readily deduced:

One-half the observations used belonged to velocities less than 10 miles per hour, and gradients less than 0.6 inches, in the most of which, })erhaps, the velocities and directions of the wind, for reasons already given, had only an accidental relation to the isobars, as laicl down upon the synoptic charts. These are consequently omitted as being of little value for comparisons with theory. The average distance from the center, represented by r for all the observations, is said to be auout 350 miles, and the average inclination, as we have seen, 47°. Hence, for the obsenations upon which the data in the above table depends, the average value of r and i must be both much less, since the rejected observations of low ·elocities and gradients must have been mostl,v in the outer part of the cyclone where r is greater, and likewise i, at least according to theory. The values of r and i in the preceding table are so assumed as to give a near agreement between the computerl aud observed velocities1 and yet be such as are most probably their average values corresponding to the different gradients, judging from all the circumstances. Large velocities and gra(lients must be mostly near the center of the cyclones, and lrnnce for these the average values of r must be less. And from what we have seen from tbeor·y, confirmed, in some measure at least, hy observation, the inclinations should be greatest for the smallest gradients and greatest values of r. The average S.

If with the observed Yalnes of the gradients G in tliis table, and the assumed values of r, i, rp, t, and P, we compute the Yalues of s by means of the formnlm (20) and (22), we get the velocities in the last column. But it should be observed here that tlle test of the formulm does not consist in the near agreement between the obsen·ed and computed Yelocities, for with slight changes of r and i tbeBe ccmhl haye been made to agree exactly, but it consists in the reasonableness and probability of the assumed values of r and i, judging from the aYerage values of these for all the observations, and from what theory aml obsen-ation would require with regarcl to the values of r and i for the different gradients. \Yilile there is considerable uncertaint,r with reg·ard to these, the result must Htill be Teg·anlP1l as being confirmatory of the accuracy of tlte formula, at least for large graclients and >elocities. For the smaller velocities and gradients, howcwer, the inclinations required seem to be too large, unless the direction of the wind in the outer part of a cyclone, where the velocities and gnid ient,.; are ver:.- small, are nearly radial. For a more accurate and satisfactory te><t of the formula, it is m111::h to be desired that we had the aYerage values of r arid i correspondiug to 1-i1weral classes of gradientl'i from a great 11umher of obserYations, and this both at sea and on land and in diffl·reut latitudes. HO. Tltat the i11dination of tile wind at the earth's surface in the outer part of the cyclone, -where gradient" mH1 Yelocities are small should uc \'ery great, is entirely in accordance with theory. This is 1lednct»1l in § 10 (c), from equation (11), upon the h:1pothesis that the friction at tlte eM"tb's surfa\'f', t·:1:pn·s,,e(l hy I', in (11 ), is the same at all 1li1'tances from the center for the same velocity s; but we have 8een in § 7 that the frietion <lrpm1dH rather upon the diiferences of the relative velocities of tlie different Rtrata, arnl from § HJ and Fig. 2 it i;;; seen that these relative velocities in the outer part of the cyclone are Rueb a8 to increase tile friction where the Yelocit,y s remains the same; for lien· the c,yelonic gyrations at an<l near tlie earth's surface have the anti-cyclonic above, so tl1at the cyclonic gyrations are retanle1l h:v the friction of tl.Je earth's surface below and that of the anti-cyclonic gyrations abO\-e, all(l these latter, and co11sequen t1y the differences of the relative yelocities l.rntwcen the several strata upou -which friction rlepends, are greater oYer the outer part of tbc <\\-clone thau :tt any other distauc<· from the center. vYe ha.-e here, more than anywhere else, the disk of the upper sr.rnta gyrating anti-cyclouically, anrl grinding, as it were, over the disk of tbe lower strata, gyrating in the co11trary direction. Hence the radial component of velocity here has to be great, since the force tlepeuding upon tbe eartl1's rotation, in a <lirection at right angles to the direction of the radial compom·nt of Yelocit:,- arnl in proportion to it, is the force which oYercornes the frictional resistances to the gyratwn, and where the radial component of Yelocit,,· is required to he great the iriclination has to be great. 67. The obsene<1 Yelocities in the preceding table were obtained by means of a cup anemometer, in which, as originall.v assumed by Dr. HolJinson, the velocity of the wind was supposed to be three times the Yelocity of tbe middle of the cups. But, according· to the recent theoretical researches of Dr. :\I. I'hiesen,· the relation between these .-elocities is far from being expressed by a si11g-le constant, aud is uot only different for different anemometeri'i, but differs in the same instru· ment with difforent Yelocities of the wind and densities of the air. Thi!:! is also shown, so far as different velocities are concerned, by the still more recent experimental researches of Dr. Robinsont anu F. Dohrant,:j: according to both of which the constant 3 is much too great for great velocities, hut is approximatelJ correct for velocities of about 10 miles or less per hour. According to Dr. lwbinson the extreme lowest value of this constant is only 2.286, and according to the results obtaiued by both, the observed velocities of the preceding table should be decreased about onefifth Jlart to giYe the tme Yelocities approximately, which would have been given by a correct constant of reductiou. \Vith such a decrease of these ''elocities, it is seen that considerable clianges must be made in the values either of r or of i, or of both, in the preceding table, in order ------------· -------------------------~------·-----

to give an agreement between theory aud observation. For the smaller gradients aml velocities this agreement. coulcl be still had by an increase of 8° m 10° in the values of i, but for the larger gradients and ,·elocities it would require a considerable decrease in tlw values of r, since wt1en i i3 small the value of cos i in the formula, upon which the velocity depends. is uot mud1 affected unless by a considerable increase of the angle. 68. In order to determine the effect of latitude upon the g-ra<lient, Profei;sor Loomis examined 250 cases of high velocities (Silliman's Journal, January, 1878, p. 20), di··idiug tlie observations into four groups according to latitude, and obtained the following average distances between the isobars drawn to t<lnths of an inch: .For latitude 29°.0, 98 miles; latitude 370.5, ()6 miles; latitude 42°.7, 62 miles; and for latitude 47°.7, 50 miles. Hence tLe µ-radients, which are inwrsel~- as the distances between the isobar:s, i11crease witL tlw latitude, as theory requires, aud a little more rapidly than the sine of the latitude. But in connection with the:se results we do not Lave the average velocities or values of s for each class. If we assume that these were the same for each group of obserYations cori·espondiug to the given aYerages of latituue, then theory, by ( lG), would require that the increase of gradient should. be a little less than that of the sine of the latitude, or cos ~,,since, according to (11 ), cos f must increase with the latitude. This iucrease, ltowe>er, is but litt.le for high latitudes. In the uncertainties of the data of comparison, awl especially in tlle assumption of equal averages of Yelocits for the several groups, a very uice agreement could not be expected between theory and ohservatiou upon this assumption. \Yith regard, however, to the general law of a decrease of gradient for the 1mme velocity "l'ith a decrease of latitude, many observations withi11 tl1e tropics show tllat the gradient is less here thau iu higher latitudes with the same velocity of the wind. 69. From (Hl) it is also seen that according to theor.Y the gradient for the same Yelocity of the wind must increase with altitude as P: cos i, neg·Iecting: the small effect dcpeu<ling 011 a change of temperature with altitude. Professor Loomis ubsen·es that at au altitrnlP or Li,000 feet tlw gradient is nearly oue-thir1l less than it is at the lower stations, but he does not state whether this is the case for the same ,·elocities of the wind. If we suppose tl1e n1lue of P at the lower ;;tatious to be 750mm, and the value of i = 45°, and at tlie height of li,OOO feet we put 1' = 580m'", a11d cos i = t, since the incliuations at great altitudes are small, we get (."')80 x . i07): 7.)0 = .:m for the ratio lletweeu the gradient at the Leight of G,000 feet aud that of tht> lmn·r o;tatious, suvposing thats is the same for both, which i:,; a greater decreaHe of gTadicut tlrnu tliat obserYe<l. 'Yith an assumed value of i = 30° at the lower stations, the ratio given by t heor_y would agree ··ery nearly with that observed. Of course the obserYations at tbe ltigh stations mu,;t han· been too ft>w to gi\·e the obserYed ratio witll much accuracy; aucl uesides it is uncertain whetller the a \·e1-ag·e of the ,-elocities above and below were the same. It. wat\ prohabl.Y much greater, and the gradient was increased from this circumstance. 70. lt is also seen from (lG) that the gradient G must decrease with the increase of temperature t, and hence it should be somewhat leRs in summer than in winter. \Vith regard to the 2;)0 easer; of high velocities examined, Pmfessor Loomis remarks that ''the ohsernttions indicate that. the gradient is less in summer than in winter; but the obsen'ations are too few in number to furnisll a satisfactory value of the gradient in summer for these high velocities." Mr. Les has obtained some definite results with regard to this subject from the examiuation and discussion of a great number of obser\'ations, from which he eoncludei,; that "the nwm relocity of the wind correspo1iding to each gradient is much lliglier in sunitner titan in winter,''* consec111e11tl,Y the gradients are much less in summer than in winter, other thiugs being the same. The data employed were the daily telegraphic reports issued by the Meteorological Office (London), from August, 1870, to July, 1875. The isobars were in the first place drawn as accurately as eoul<l be done for each day, and the gradients instrumentally measured in the direction in which they were the steepest over the station. The stations selected were Stoneyhurst and Kew. There is a

The results for winter include the observations from October to March, and those for summer the observations from April to September, inclusive. The results in the table show a very decided difference in the Yelocities for the same gradients in winter and summer, and one which is much too great to be accounted for in full h.r the formula of (16) with the average temperatures, or values of t, for winter and summer, and this is especially so in the case of the small gradients and velocities. If we compare the velocities and gradients of the table in § 65 with those of the preceding tal)le, it is seen that the velocities in the latter for the same gradients are much smaller than those in the former, which would require still greater Yalues of i in the forrnulm for small velocities, and smaller n1lues of r for the larger ones, iu order to make the theory agree with these observations. 1\lr. Ley has not given the average values of these quantities for the different classes of gradients and \·eiocities, but larger assumed values of i in this case would not be consistent with the average value of i for all gradients and velocities obtained by him for all Europe, as given in § 40. From all the comparisons which have heen made of observations with the results of the formnlre giving the relation between the barometric gradient and the velocity of the wind, we have seen that large values of i, except in the case of large Yelocities near the center of gyration, are necessary in order to reconcile the formula with obsernttion. In the case of no friction, and consequently completel;v circular gyrations, the value of i is o, and the formula with this value gives much larger velocities. Hence the formula of Peslin, ba;;ed upon the 11ypothesis of circular gyrations and no friction, gave a velocity much too great in the comparisons which he made with observations. 71. For the same reasons, as in the case of the annual changes of temperature, the formula would give greater velocities of the wind for the same gradient during the day than during the night. But tl1e rliflerence given l1;r tbe forum la accounts for on1y a very small part of the observed difference. According to a paper· by Dr. Hann, on "The Diurnal Period of the Ve1ocity and Direction of the ·wind," it appears that the velocity of the wind by observation during the warmest part of the day, at man~' 11laces, is from one-third to one·half greater than it is during the coldest part, in the latter part of the night. 'l'his is especially the case at inland stations, but at sea there uoes not seem to be any sensible inequality of this sort, and at great elevations the inequality seems to be reversed, the least velocities occurring during the warmest part of the day. These diurnal changes in the velocity of the wind cannot be due t-0 corresponding changes in the barometric gradient, as obtained from synoptic charts, for these are known to be very small; but both the annual and diurnal inequalities in the velocities of the winds may be explained, with some degree of plausibility, by supposing tliat a consiclerable part of the winds is due to local disturbances of temperature and barometric gradients, producing gyrations and various irregular

229

disturbances of the winds, and thus increasing the avcra.ge observed velocities, while these local disturbances are too small in extent to affect the gradients as obtained from synoptic charts, in which the stations of obl;ervation are at long distances from one another. The effect of numerous cyclonic gyrations upon the velocity of the wind due to the gradients obtained from synoptic charts, may be readily seen by considering a special case. If we suppose a particle of air to have a progressive and also a gyratory motion and that the yelocities of both are the same, then the path of the particle of air will be that of a cycloid and hence much greater than that of the progressfre motion, correspontling to the obser··ed gradient. The wind in this case would of course blow with variable direction and yelocity, as it. generally does, but the velocity obtained from the averages of observations without regard to directioa would be increased. From the Table of § 28 it is seen that the atmosphere is frequently in a state of unstable equilibrium during the da;y and in the summer season, e,·en when not saturated with aqueous vapor, and hence in a state to give rise to nurnerou:o; cyclonic disturbances of small dimensions 1 and extending up to no very great altitude. Hence mostly during the summer, and the warmest part of the day, the obserYed Yelocities arc increased, which giYe rise to the annual and diurnal inequalities of velocity, while the corresponding changes in the gradientR are not obsen·ed, bccam;e the stations of observation are too far apart to detect tlie111. On the ocean the annual and diurnal changes of temperature are very small, and, besilles, the atmosphere, on account of the re1ath·e coldness of the ocean, is not often in a state of unstable equilibrium there. The annual and diurnal inequalities of the velocity of the wind, accordingly, is not obscr,·ed here. lf the observations of winds and barometric gradients on the ocean were discm;sed, as l\Ir. Le.Y did those of Stoncyhurst and Kew, they would probably gh·e bnL littJe difference between the \'elocities of winter and summer, corresponding to the same gradients. As the regular progressiYc motion of the upper strata of the atmosphere is generally greater than that at the earth's surface, the ascending air arising from the surface on account of small cyclonic disturlntnces, or from any kind of interchange between the lower and upper strata, has a tendency to retard the greater \'eloeities of the upper currents, aud this must occur mostly during the summer season and the warmest part of the cla;.·. Thns inequalities are produced in the velocities of the upper currents, the reverse of those helow, since the causes which increase the ,·elocities below must, decrease them abm-e. A satisfactory explanation of the matter lias been gh-en by Dr. K1ip1>e11. (Zeit. der Oester. Gesell. fiir MPteorologie, Band XIV, Seite 333.) 72. The cyclone theory may now be used in the explanation of the various ineqnalitiei; of barometric pressure which are ohsen·ed 011 the same latitude in different longitudes. \Ye shall consider these first with regard to the mean pressures, independent of the seasons of the year, which is that which occurs approximately near tl1t· middletof April and October. In Part l of these Researches the effect upon barometric pressure of differences of mean annual temperature between the polar and equatorial regions, taken without regard to differences of temperature in longitude, ha,~e been determined from observation, and is shown in the column of Bo in Table X, p. 37. From this it is seen that for a difference of about 400 (72° F.) of temperature in the northern hemisphere between the pole and the equator, the difference of barometric pressure is ver,y suiall, being a little Jess at the pole than at the equator, and haying its maximum ahout the parallel of 350. In the southern hemiS})here, however, this difference, for perhaps about the same differe11ce of temperature, is much greater, for reasons already i,riven in l'art I. It is now proposed to consider the deviations of the mean annual pressure in longitude from the mean of all longitudes. 'l'his depends mostly on the corresponding deviations of the mean annual temperature in longitude from the mean of all longitudes, but in some measure also 011 t11e i11etpialities of the earth's surface, which i11terfere with the regularity of the general atmospheric curreu ts and gi \'C rise to disturbances of atmospheric presi,;urn. In the first of the following tables are given these deviations of mean annual temperature for the northern hemisphere, which must be regarded as residuals, or ratlier tlisturbances, of temperature, the e:flects of which are yet to be considered. These, as likewise those for January and ,July, are only approximate, and are not to be regarded as being very aecnrate, since they ha.-e been obtained from isothermal charts, by interpolating to the latitudes and longitudes of the tables, as well as could be, from a mere inspection of the charts. The results thus obtained were, in many cases, then smoothed off somewhat by means of the differences, so that the numbers in the table

must be regarded as giving the deviations of the general distribution of temperature over the globe, neglecting all local and minor irregularities. This is what is needed for our purpose, rather than numbers giving all the small local irregularities, since it is not proposed here to consider the effocts of the latter, but merely those of the more general disturbances of temperature over the globe.

73. If we examine the numbers in Table 1 corresponding to the northern part of the Atlantic ocean, and especially if we write these numbers in their proper places on a polar projection of the northern hemisphere, it is seen that there is a considerable area, smnewhat circular, with the center a little north and east of Iceland and west of Norway, in which there are large residual temperatures, above the average of all longitudes, amounting at, the maximum to about 20° F., which have not been taken into account in Part I, in the general motions and pressure of the atmosphere, and the effects of which we are now to consider. Here, then, we have the approximate conditions of a cyclone with a gradient of decreasing temperature from the center outward, represented approximately by (25). At a considerable altitude, however, the temperature gradient is probably less than at the earth's sm-face, since the temperature disturbances of the atmos1Jhere are mostly greater at the surface than at considerable altitudes where the temperature remains more nearly the same over all parts of the globe, and at all seasons of the year. The constant C, therefore, in (25) is probably less for the upper strata than the lower ones. These conditions must give rise to a fixed cyclone, with its center near Iceland, and consequently to an area of low mean annual barometer in the northern part of the Atlantic, and this effect must be superimposed on that belonging to the general motions and pressure of the atmos-

phere treated of in Part I, and consequently we haYe here an area in wbich the barometer is lower than the mean of the ]atitnde taken all around the glohe. That there is sncll a clepression is ::;ltown by Uhart I, Part I, on which the isobar,,; are laid down, as wt>ll as coultl he, from olJserTatious. aml although tlrt:>re is some uncertainty in tht>se lines, from tltc want of isutticient olJsenati1111s ou the ocean, yet obsernttiou shows conelusfre1y that the.re is au area. of low baro111ett>r ;,;uch a,.; theory requires. As thedistrihutiou of temperatnrn oYCr tl1e hemisphere gh·es tire conllition:,; of a cyclone with a gradient of increasing temperatm·e from tlrn pole to the equator, thi.~ is a case of a c,yclm1<' within a cyclone; arnl consequently, for reasom; giYeu in § 32, the comhiue1l etl'ect8 of tlrnse co111litions, treated separate]~, do not gi,'e precisely the true effoct:-; of lJoth comlitiou.s combine<l, yet the eff'ect8 lost are only of a secoml order, aml are of no consequence where only a general explanation of tLe observed variationR of pressure o\·er the glolJe are aimed at, and uot a comparison of exact quantitatiYe results. 74. By the cyclone tlieory e\·cry cyclone must haYe an a1111uln:-; of high barometer and its anticyclone snITounding it. As this is a fixed awl permanent cyclone, tLe anti-c~·cloue may l1t\ Yer.r broad and the gradient Yn~· small, so that the highest part of the annulnt< may ue very little liigher than the normal heiglit, aml this a11m1lns fall8 011 so ma11y other i11equalities that it ca1111ot he recognized on the chart, hnt tl1e eft'c·ct, of this annulus is seeu i11 thl· Atlantie, ou the parallel of about 05°, where it, falls somewhat 011 1 but probably considera lJly 80uth of, the annulus of lligh barometer belonging· to the hemisph<'rical cyclone, wbiclr, as we have see11, i8 ou thi:< latitn<le, am) t,lie effect of the two com hined giYes an area of barometric pressure a little hig·her than that of t.hP average oft he latitmle taken all around the globe. Since this is a case of a cyclolle 'Yithiu a e,rclo11e the d1art rPpresentiug the comlJiue<l effects of the two should be similar to l<'ig. 4, in which the a.mruhls of' high barometer of the indncled cyclone falls somewhat on that of the larger one, gh·ing- a !'omewhat elliptical area of liigh lmrometer, with winds lJlowing in some measure all arouml it, bnt with much greater \·elocity on the north and south sides than 011 the east aud west sides. 1f it were not for tile c,\'donic system with its center near Icelaml, tire calw-belt of the parallel of 35° wonlll exteud fro111 Africa and the Mediterranean entirely across the Atlantic and the southern 1>art of tlw C11itt·rl States; but nuder existing circumstances the a11ti-cyclouc of thi8 disturbing ssstem, with it.-; win<l8 g_yratiug from left to right, cuts thi8 calm-uelt, ou the east side of the Atlautie aml w, st coast of Africa, giving rbe to gentle uortlrerl.r winds, and on tlre west si1le of the Atlantic aIHl tlte soutlrt·n1 11art of the United Statt>s, giving ri8e here to a predo;11i11auct· of soutlwrly winds. It is to this auti-cyclone alone tlrat the gradienti; 011 the east and west side of the area of high haromPter i11 the AtLmtw, on the parallel of 350, is due, as well as the corrc.i;pondi11g wiuds of the8e g-rndie11ts, while on the north a.nd south sides the gradients au<l correspornling wiu<ls of the two s~·stem,.; combine. Betweeu the cent.er 11ear lcelaud and the parallel of 35°, the gradients for this reason become very steep, and hence the wPst aud 80uthwest winds of the Atlantk in the middle latitudes at·e nmtsnally strong. In the trade-wind region of the Atlantic the auti-cyclone.s of the two system8 comhi11e, and heuce the trade-wiutls here receive itdditional force from the auti-cydonc of the !i.)'stern, with its center near lcelaud. It is from the effect of this latter that tllc trade-windis on th<· e,tst side of the Atlantic blow nearly from the north, while midway the.rare from the northeast, in tire Autilles from the east, and iu tlie southern 1mrt of the United State.-; from the ,,;outheast a111l south. Tl1e effect of the permanent cyclone with its center near Icelaud i:s to canse tl1t· preYailiug direction of the winds to be more from the southwei;t and south in the British Isles and Xorway, a111l i11 Greenland and Baffin's Bay from the northea.:st. The isobars of Chart I, Part 1, for tire reg-iou of the North Atlantic, laid down from observation are, as nearly as we can judge, cxactls iu aC(:ordauce with t.be preceding deductions from theory. The prevailing directions and force:s of the winds of this region, taken for the whole year, are so well known tl1at it i8 not necessa:'J to rl'f'l·1· here, l'\"Cll if space would permit, to the numerous authorities which might be cited to proYe tlr<tt the existiug system of winds is in strict accordance with theory. (See "\Vinds of the Globe, Plate 3, lJy the late Prof. J. H. Coffin, LL. D.) With regard to the effect of the cyclone of the northern part of the Atlantic on the upper currents of the atmosphere, it should be borne in mind that the cyclonic gyrations of the lower strata, in a system with a warm center, decrease with altitude ana become more and morn anti-cyclonic, so

that althou~h the surfacwwimls of the middle latitndes are much increased b~- the cyclonic gyrations, it is uot so much the crnse at 80me height ahoni the surface, and in the upper regions of the atmosphere the eastwaru currents may be much diminisl1ed by the anti-cyclonic gyratious prevailing there, especiall;r near tlw outPI' limits of the l'yclonie g·.uati011s below. It i::< importaut to take this into conl'iideration in obsen-i11g and stud.Ying the npper emTenti; of the N01th Atlantic. 7t1. There is anotl1er eft'ed wbid1 should he taken iuto account here, which coh1cides in some measure with that arisil1g from the local inequalitiPs of tl'rnprratme. \Yr l1ave seen in Part I that the g'lmeral motion of the atmosphen· in tlie mid<lk latit ml rs i1> tow:'!nl the east, and between the parallel of 300 or a:Jo and the equator it iR toward tue wei;;t. The middle of the current aud the maximum ~elocity eastwanl are aboYe tbe varallel of ,-;:oo. ,,-here this current encounters the greatt"r friction of tht> couti11ent, all(l t>Rpecially liigh Janel:-; awl mountain range8, it is deflected in part to the right aml left, the part to the ri1:d1t passi11g oYer thr Pastnn sidP of the Atlantic and west eoa:st of Afric:t and joining the ge11eral wp.::;tward current in the lower latitudes, :ind the part deflected toward the left passing np toward the pole arom11l h~' Greenland, aud joining again the general current eastward in the middle latitudes. 'file westward eurreut within the tropics is likewi::;e deflected in part h,\· the A nwriean continent, all(l eHpecia Uy the liigh mountain ranges of Mexico, to the right oYer the southern part of the United States, am] also joins ihe general eastward current of the mid<lle latitmle.~. Henue there are prodnceJ two great gyrations of the atmos phere from this cause iudepern1ent of any locaJ distnrhance8 of te111peratnre, the one around some point nrar Jceland a;;; a center, and tlie other around somt· point about the middle of the Atlantic near the parallt'l of a:Jo. Sim·e wherP t111>re i~ motion in any dirrction there is a deflecting force arising from t.lie earth'is rotation to thl' right of this direction in the nm·theru hemisphere, the gyration around the center uear lcdand must 1·amw a lmromdric depression in that regio11, while the g,\Tatim1 aromu] tile otbei· center on or 1war thP parallel of 35°, since it is in the contrary dil'ectio11, muM eanse an aren of J1igh harome!er with its center near the center of gyrations. The effects of these g',natious arising from the deflections of the continents, both on the barometric pres;.;1ue a11d on the motions of tl1P atmosphere, coincide so nearly with those arising from the local disturbauct>s of temperature tbat we cannot 1,wparah· tlH·m and say bow much belongs to each camm. The cP11h·r of tJ1(· arPa of resultant low harometer from the two canses, as shown by the chart, sef'111S to he a little further \rn ... t tl1:111 it slionltl be if it <lepended on the temperature disturbance alone, since t!Je maximum of t11e latter is further east th.111 the center of the area of low barometer. The center of thP <lepression, t11erl'fore, arising from the deflections of the continents, is perhaps a little west of Iceland, a11<l therefore the ceuter of the resultant depression arising from both causes is a little east or Iceland, hut not so far a;;; it wonl<l be jf it depended on the cyclone arising from the ternper<tture d1o;turha11ce alone. 76. From the first of tl1e precc<li ng taole.~ it is JikPwise seen that tl1ere is a temperature disturbance i11 the north em part of the Pacific Ocean, though less than i11 the Atlantic, which must gin> rise to a fixed c_yc101w a)l(l an area of lower mean aun ual barometric pressure than the normal of the latitude. l;'rom Chart I, Part I, it is seen tllat observation g·iyes such an area of barometric depres:sion. Tl1e d(·vreBsion, lwweYPr, iu tllis case rna~- he cl ne in great part, if not mostly, to the gyrations produced hy the deflections of the coutinent.s 1 al'! exvlained in the case of the Atlantic uudt·r similar circumstances. These deflections are without doubt much gn·ater here than in the Atlantic on account of the high range of the motmtains so near the Pacific coast. In this ocean we likewise lun-e a higher mean annual barometric pressure than the average of the latitude extending near!~· anm;s the ocwa11, aml a ssstcm of wiuds o\·er the whole oceau, similar to that of the Atlautic, all of which are explained in the same ma1111ea· as those of the Atlantic. 77. In the interior, or rathrr ou the east side, of Asia, it is seen, from the table of residual mean amrnal temperatures already referred to, that there is an a.rea of low temperature relatively to the a\·erages of tlJ(~ latitnde8. Tliis area is W'r:r irr('gufar and furnishes only very imperfectly tlie couditio111'i of a. tixe1l eydone with a <'ol<l ceuter; besides the area is too large to give these conditious accnrately, for reasons giYen in § 1. If we had the complete conditions of a cyclone, the cyclonic gyrations around the center of this area according to the theory of this kind of cyclones, would probablJ- cause a diminution of the barometric pressure at the central cold area, as in the

cases of the great liemis1)berical cyclones, i11 which, especiall:y that of the southern hPmisphere, there is a depressiou of tlie barometer over the e<·ntral cold area; but on account of tl1e imperfection of the conditions i11 this ease the g-reater mean annual preRRnre due to tl1e lcHs lll<'an annual temperature is but little affected from this cause. It ii,; seP11 from Chart I, Part I, tl1at the ecuter of the area of high mean a11nual barometric prcssnrn is m1wh furtlwr \H'>"l tllll11 that of tl1e ec·uter of the relatively cold area, and it would therefore Reem that it must he dut>, at lt>ast iu part, to smne other cause. It is no uoubt caused iu part hy tl1e oYerlapping of the an·as of 11igh barometer surrounding eacll of the permaneut c_vclones of the nortl1er11 purts of tl1t· two gre>at oceans. 111 tl1e uortliern lJtut of North America we liave somewhat similar eomlitious, hut the area of relative cold aml tLe amount of temperature clisturha11ce are much li;ss, aml e011seqne11tl,Y the mean annual pressure js less than in Asia, _aml the area of high haromett>r rdatin·ly to the aYerages uf the latitude is of less extent. In the northern part of Afriea we ha\-e a somewhat circular area of n·latin·ly high tmnperature, hut the center being- ver~' 1Jear the e1prntor, it carniot give rise to an.'· cydouie effed, aud the corresponding low ba.rometer of tliis art>a, shown by tl1e chart, is dim e11tirPl,Y to the greater rarefaction of tbe air. 78. 'Ye now come to the consideration of the local disturbances of barouwtrie pressure in the northeru hemisphere and tlle corresponding (listurbances of the g-e11eral motions of tlw atmosphere, for January, dne to the resi<lnals of temperature gi \-en in tlie seeo111l of tlH' preeediug tables. It is seen from the tables that the distrilmtion of these residuals for Jauuar.Y i;; somt·what similar to those of the mean .temperatures, hut that they an· i11 g<·11eral more than twi('c a;; larg·e. The effects of these residuals, then, on the pressure of the atmosphere and tlu· general motious of tlie atmosphere for J anuar,v, as treated of and gi n·n in the first part of the8e I tesea rdws, 111 nst al,,;o he ><imilar, but in general about twice ft8 great. Accordingly we han' at tliis season of the year t!Je t1Yo g-rf'at cyclones of the 11orther11 ]>arts of the Atlantic awl Pacific Ucca11s Ycry similar to thost> belonging to the season of mean annual temperatures antl 1>ressnres, hut with a Yiolcncc and barometric pressure about twice as great. Tlw mean annual pressure at Iceland is ahout 754""", while the average of the latitnde B 0 , Table X, l'art I. is i;)S.~'"'\ aud hence :i depn·t<siou, 1lue to the residual temperatures of Table I, of more than 4""". In .January the prpss1ue at Ieelarnl is only about 750"'m, while the average of the latitude for this sea5011, b,Y the table just referrccl to, is Bo+ B 1 = 758.2 0.6 = 758.8, alHl hence the amount of depression due to the resic1nals of temperature, not consiuered in tbe averages for the latitude~ is nearly II"'"' at this seasOll, arnl a little more than twice as great as in the case of tile mean annual temperatnres auu pressure.,;. In the Pacific Ocean the barometric rlP.pressim1 is 11ot q11ite 80 gTeat, ~lltt it is ahont twil~P as much in .January as for the mean of the year. A part of these barometrie depressions, as in the ca8e of the meau ammal dt'pressiou:-;, is likewise due to the gyrations arising from the dP-fiectiom; of the g·e1wra.l moti011s of the atmosphere hy the continents, and 11erhaps in case of the Pacific the greater part; aud Rince these general motions are much iucreased iu Januar;r a.boYe the average or mean of tht> ~·ear, the 1-.:01rt of thes<· depre8sions due to this cause shonl!l be much iuereased also i11 ,Jan nary. On at~crnmt of these great flepressions in January in the northern J>arts of thetw oceans, the g-radients of the middle latitnde>s of thPse oceans, espelJially of lhc Atlantic, become very stePp, ~iucc tlwy coml>iiw wilh the gTadie11t of these latitudes helouging to the general pressure of the atmosphere or that of the great hemispherical cyclone with its center at the pole, and hence the west and southwest wiuds of tlwse latitudes in January are unusualJy strong. As seen from Table X, Part. f, the ayera.ge pre:ssnre of t11e latitude for Januar~- is Bo+ B 1, in which B 1 has a positive value, except in the extreme north an<l south latitudes of the hemisphere, with a maximum of l.66'"m. Hence, where the depression eausl'tl hy tlwsc cydonNi is equal to B 1 there is no annual inequality though there mas be a small semi-annual mie. This li1w of no annual ine.quality is laid clown from observation on Chart III, Part I, designated h,\' U.

thi" acconnt so imperfect, that this annulus is very impertectl,r formed in this case, especially near the eqnator, whPre the forces on which it depends vauish. rn. It is SPen from the second of the preceding tables that in January the residuals of tempt'rature o\·er a n'ry large area, with ifa center on the. eastern Ride of Asia, and over a much ~mmllcr an'a in tlit' northern part of North America, are 11egath·e, and hence theRe areas at this season are rdati\·el,v cold OJH"8. Tl1ese give very imperfect!.'· the conditions of a cyclone with a cold interior. If tlu·se eonditiou' wt>re perfect, and espeeiall,Y if they were on sea instead of land, the cyclonic g,uations arouml t lw ct>uter might so depress the barometer in the interior as to nearly or quite counteract tht· efft>d 011 t 111· haromrter due to the increased density from cold, as we see in the two great 11cmi:.;phcrical cyclo11<·" i11 wliich the effect of the gyrations is greater than that of the greater df'll"it,\· of the air, t·srec'ally in th(· sontlteru one, where the baromPter in the polar n·gions is Yery mncl1 lower than at the cqnator. Tlwre is 110 doubt 1-<ome cyclonic effect in these regions and some <h·pressio11 of tlie haromekr from thi8 cause, imperfect as tl1e conditions are, but the. eftect of the grca tcr <lPnsity from «Ol(l is mncli greater, and hence in these reg·ions, e8pecially in Asia, the lmromctcr stand, nr111sually hig·h in January. 80. From the la:;t of the prt>cediug tal>les it is seen that the temperature residuals for July are ge11cr:1ll,\· f.\lllall. Jn the 11orther11 part8 of tl1e Atlantic and Pacific Oceims, where iu Jauuary we lia(l thl' comlitious of cydone8 1 the effects of wllich caused great barometric depressions, we haYe now Yery lH.'arly the aYerage temperatures of the latitude, imd hence no conditions giYing rise to <',Yclonc>s all(] haromt>tric depressions o\·er these regions. Hence tlle great barometric depressions which preq1ilt>d lwn· i11 ,January lrnYe now Yery nt>arl:.· Yanished, and the barometric gradients disappean·d, as is seen from an inspeetion of Cbart vr, Part T, and the strong west winds which prernil in the middle Jatiturles on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in January are now of Yery little force, a,; i,.; indicated by the width between the isobarH and consequent smallness of the gradients. The barometric presstue at Iceland, where in .Tanuars it was vers much depressed, is 11ow exactl:.· equal to the average of the latitude, wllich is B(\ - B 1 of Table X, Part I, and hence thi>re is no c_yclonic action aud depression from thi8 c~mse, and the gradients of the middle latitudes of the At Ian tie are simpl,r thoRe of the average of all latitudes belouging to the great polar cyclone existing at this seasou, with a small barometric depreRsiou OYer the }lOlar regions. The effect of tile gTPat cyclone in the winter season, witli its center near Icelarnl, no doubt extendi,; to the equator aml camies the position of tlie calm-belt there on the Atlantic to be a little further south tlian it otlwrwise would be. This effect, added to the general oRcillation of this belt, observed all around the glohp and theoreticallJ e.xplaine11 iu § 2.3, cmmeR an unmmal amount of oscillation of this belt 011 the Atla11tic with the changes of the Reasons. 0Yer Europe, Asia, and North America, now, the temperatiue iR much greater than on the ot·eau;.;, and considerably above the average of the latitudes, and 11ence the temperature residuals me posith'P, and cause a depres8ion of the barometer below the average pressures of the latitudes ~fren h;y B 0 - B 1 by the greater rarefadion of the air mostly, 8ince these residuals are not so distributed as to furnish conditions wl1icb can give rise to much cyclonic action. Over the region of Il udson's and Baffin's Bay, and Greeulaml, aud in the middle of the Pacific Oct~an, on latitude mio, the residuals are sornewliat large and negatin', imlicatiug that the temperatures of these regions in July are colder than the average of the latitudes, and hence the barometric presirnres hen· should be greater than the averages of thelatitu<le, given b,r B 0 - B 1, and observation sliows that thiR is the ca8e, a8 ma,r be seen hy comparing Chart VI, Part I, with the value of Bo - B1 ginn hy the table before referred to. These areas of negative residuals are somewhat circular, aud hence fnmish roughly tlle conditions of a cyclone with a cold cen tfw, and there is probably some c,Yclo11ic action and depression of the barometer from this cause, since the barometer over these regions does not 1liffer much from the ~werage of the latitude, while the temperatures di~r considerably. 81. "'e have now seen bow little tlie diflerences of baromeiric pressure O'Yer the globe in the same season of the year, and at the same place in differc·nt seasons of' the year, depend directlJ on mere difforenees alHl changes of temperature, and how entirely out of proportion it iS to these differences and cha11ges. At the polar regions, especially those of the southern hemisphere, where there is the greaki,;t cold, the barometric pressure is the least, and over the northern hemisphere generally the great changes of temperature from January to July, taking

This disproportion hctwe('n t1·mperature and barometric JH'essnre ii-; because the barometric gradients iu perfect C'yclo11es depend almost entin·ly 011 thP Q·elouic gyratiorn;.; of tht> atmosphere, alHl not upo11 the temperatnre gradients, as has been ,;liown by theory in § HI, and the amount of haromPtric <leprN;sion in tlrn interior of a cyclonic system with a cold center should be as great as in the case of onf' with a warm center, except so far as the slight imperfections of tl1e theory with rt>gard to effrds of frietion are concerned. 111 the two great hemisplierical eyclones with the cold polps of the Parth at the · center, comddt·riug on]~ tlw a\·prage tempPratnre of the latitmle, we haYe a TlPar approximation to a perfect cyclonic s;1·stem, <'Xcept so far as inequalitieR of surface are <·om:ernet1, aud hence there is a diminution of preSflllrt' at tlic pol<>s in proportion to the amount of eyclonic motion prodncfil, and tllat this <lepPTlllR Yery much on the rcgnlarit.'- and smoothness of th<' surfaec is S<'<'ll from the differe11ces of the g;nations aud consequent pressures in the polar regions of the two liemisphcres. "\Yl1en we come to (·011si(her Ilic effect,; of the resi(lnals of temperature, not taken iuto account in the consideration of tht> two gn·at hemispherical cyclones, they mostly furnish very imperft'ctJ~-, if at all, the conditions of a perfect an<l regular cyclonr, so that the c;1·clone theory cannot be in geueral applied to them witl1 auy dt'gree of accunwy, and therefore the c·.olcler areas, with rder. ence to the averagP for the latitndes, give an increased barometric pressurc>, since the c>fted of c_\·clonic ac1iou is 11ot sufficiPnt tu decrease the pressure ill the ct>ntral part as much as it is illcreased by diminution of templ"r<1tnre. 8:?. In the southern lie11ii."pliere there il'I iu general very little Yariation of temperature in longit.mle. and hencf' the rei"iduah; of temiwratnre, ])Ositive and negati\·e, such ai-; gi,·en in the Jlrc>cedingtables for tlte northern hemisphere, are gene.rally small. The great hemispherical c~·clonic s.rstem, therefore, with its ]ow harouwter in tlw polar regious a.ml its annulus of high li:1ro111t>ter a1ouml the globe, ha,·ing its maximum about the parallel of 30°, ii-; very little disturbed hy local irregularities of temperature, the belt of high barometer being only broken up a little~ mostly in the summer season, hy tbe greater mean tcmpt>ratnre of South America, Africa, and A1rntralia. As in the northern hemisphen·, the gyratio11s arising from the deflection of the general currents of the atmoRphere bJ- tl1e continents no donht produce comdderable effect, t>speciall~- those arising from the deflections of the high ra11ge of the Andes in South Amt'.rica, since these general currents in this hemisphere are Yery strong. "\Ye lrnYe thus in the South .Atlantic, as in the :~forth Atlantk, au arP.a of increased barometric pressure from this cause with its center near tbe paralJel of ::rn°, :mll like"Tise west of the contim·nt of South America on the same latitudes. TherP is likewise a Jeflection of the westward currents of tht' South rmlian Ocean by the east eoast of Africa down hJ- Madagascar and Mauritius Islands, which pass<·s on down into the general eastward cnrreut of the middle latitudes, but a lmrncl1 of it passt·fl around west of .Australia to join again the westward current, thus causing a slight g:yration aroun<l au area witl1 its ceuter midway between Australia. aJ1d Africa, and on the parallel of allout :~oo, and consequently an area with a barometer a little higher than tlle aw111·age of the latitmle. Hence on the southern hemisphere, as in thP northern, there are currents of atmospherP on the ea.stern sides of the continents, pa.ssing from the lower to the higher latitudes through tl1e belt of generally l1igher barometer with its maximum about the parallel of 300. In this hemisphere the general change of temperature from winter to summer is ,;mall, but it is sufficient to produce a 1woportio11ate effect upon the strength of the great c~·clone system, increasing it in winter and decrea.siug it in summer, ancl this in winter i11creascs the harometric gradients and the height of the belt of high barometer, but depresses the barometer in the polar regions, and in summer the reverse. But in wint.er the amount of atmosphere in either hemisphere is greater, since the opposite hemisphere is then warmer, and the air expands and a portion tlo\YS over into the colder hemisphere, 80 that the general or average height of the lmrometer is i11creased from this cause in the winter and diminished iu summer. The greater pressure in winter of eitl1er hemisphere, arising from this cause, is mcreased in the latitudes of the belt of high barometer by

the greater aetiYity of the general hemispherical cyclone, but decreased in the rolar regions, wLere the effect of the former cal1Se may not only be destro;yed but reYersed. Hence the barometer in eitl1er 11emis1,here is in general bighf'r in winter tlrnu in summer, not considering inequalities in lougit11de; but thi;.;, ac(~ording to theory, may be reversed i11 the polar regions. This is sllown hy ob>:ervatiou to b(' the caSl', a;; is :-;eeu from Table X, Part I, in which it i:-; Heen that the ·alue of H1 , the coefficient of annual inequality. is req'rsed at the paralltcl of ahont 78° in the northern 11cmi1'plwre, and 011 the parallel of 5.3° in the southern hernispherP. s:t Aecording· to § 30 tlte interior of an ordinary progres~i ,.e cyclone ii' geuerall,v a reg'ion of cloud and rain, especially if the air is moist and the cyclone lias cou ti11ued in action m1til the moist air of the :-;urface arises hy mf'an:" of tlie i11terinr gently a8ce11ding cnrreutis until it arriyes at a height at · wbicl1 the aqneou.-; yapor is eomleused. That the iuterior of 3 cyclone is in general au area of cloud awl rain is too well known to ordinary obscrYation to need an;v proofs from regular series of obi:;ern1ti01rn. In a perfect cyclone, in an atmosphere without progressiYe motion, the area of cloud and rain would lw circular, \Yitlt its center at tl1e centrn' of the c.vclone; but when the atmosphere lrn8 a progressh·e motion in any direction, by§ :w, this anm sl1o!lld hi' sm11ewhat elliptical with the 1011ge1· axi.s 11early in tlrn directiou of the progre.ssive motion of the atmosphere, and also nearly in the din·ction of the 1·rogrcssfre motion of the cyclone, l'iuce tl1e latter dPpen(ls very 1111wh upon the former. Loomis has shown from tlie Signal Service observations that the figure of tlw whole rain area is ge11era1J:.· of an oval form. He also ascertained the longer and shorter diameters of a number of rain areas i11 which the depth of rain was at lea:-;t oue inch during the prece1li11g (·ight hours, aml of utlll'rs in which the tleptlt was at lea8t a half inch during that tiTme. (Silliman',.; Jonrnal, ,July, 1877, l'· :!.) ·with regard to these he remarks: "The form of these rain areas is sometimes quite irrPgular, hut generally it a11proximates to an ellipse, of which the major axis is not quite double the minor axis." Since· the clout! from w 11icl1 the raiu fall:" is being continuall,Y carried forward hy the upper stnrngPr cmTr11ts of the atmosphere's progrt>ssive motion, in fHh·~rnee of the gyrations of the lower 1mrt of the atmosphere, tlw center of rain area should fall i11 advance of the center of the area of low liaromctt~r. Loomis found, for the aserage of 38 easel' wliieh he examined, that "the average distarn·e of tlle center of greatest rainfall from the center of low pre1'1mrc for the cases north of latitulle ;)(jO is :mo miles, lmt it soml·tinrns 1,xceetlH 750 miles." Tlais rainfall was for the precediug eiglit hours. From this shonlrl be dedn<'teci tl1e progressi,·e motim1 of the area of low barometer in four 11ours, say 100 miles, iu orde.r to have tLe simultaneous tfo·tauce of rain center from the center of area of low pressure, which would lea \'C it on the an'ra,:.:;·e a!:ont 200 miles. Thi· direction of the storm's path coincides Yer~· nearly with the direction of the axis of rain area. I~or the :werage direction of N. 440 B. of the storm's path, Loomi:-; found, from three years' ohse1Tatio11s, the a·erage direction of the axis of rain area N. 5:10 E., arnl for the a\-erage direction of N. 1110 K for the former, Le found N. 115° E. for the latter. Hence the directions in all cases an· very uearl,v the same, antl no doubt that of the a\·erage dil-ection of the progressive motion of the atmosphl·rB, ei:;peciall,v of tl1e cloud region in each case. According to theor.r, § 3G, the forms of the isolrn.rs should also ha.1·e an ontl figure, with the ltmger axis somewl1at in the direction of the axis of rain area and of the progressin~ motion of the cycl01w or area of low bitromi:>ter. Loomis found the forms of these isobars t~ Yary much in form. In some case:-; they were ucarJ~· circular, but 7 per cent. of them were fonr times as long as wiile, 20 per (!ent. three times, and 47 per cent. double. He remarks: "The aYerage form of tile isobars about the 8torm's center may bl' said to be au irregular O\'al, whose length is ne.nly tloulJle its brea(ltlt." (Sillimau's .Journal, .Tul_y, 187LJ.) Tlte preceding rei:mlt:-; from observations, especially the distance at which the center of rain area falls i11 adn1nce of the storm center, seem to irnlicate an enor·mous inclination of the axis of the storm formtrd at the top, which is entirely i11consistent with the hypothel;is of its inclination backward. But, in accordance with § 37, there can be but little inclinatiou of the real axis of the gyrations, and the center of cloud antl rain is carried forward in adYance of this. 84. In 101 cases of low barometer in which the amount of rain did not amount. to one·eighth of au inch, Loomis found that more than one.half showed a pressure less than 20.70 inches; more

He says: "There Heeml'i to be no room for 1lonht that harometric minima sometimes form with ·er;\little rain, aud continue without au;y co111'i<lerable rai11 for eight hotul'i, aud sometimes for twt'l1tyfour hour,; aml lo1Jger.

His tinal co11clm;ion i>i that "rnii~lall i:-: not eN.~enfial to the formation of W't'flN of {me barometer, 1111d iN not the pr;ncipal c1111.w· of thdr formation m· of their progressiv(~ motion." (Sill. .four., .Jn!~-, 1871.) Tliis is strictly in accordm1ce with the tlit'ory of§ 29 In tl1e cases of llrPas of low harometer without rain, thei-;p low areas arise from cyclo11i<· motio11s d11e to tlte tenJiwrature <listurhanceis aril'ing from the primary causes, aud these, according to the theory, must always exist to a eertaiu extt·nt before the seeomlar;\ can>iP ariRing· from the cornlensation of aqueous ,-apor can take place. l t does 11ot i-;ccm, lioweYer, that these areas of low barometer without. rai11 continue n'ry long·, or that tlw barometer en·r lwcome:-; Yery low, and we could not infer that. thi>i woultl lw the ease from theort>tical co11siderati011:-;.

Although cyclonic areas are ge11erally areas of doud and rain, ,yet tLe re\·erRP of this ii,; not true, for the areas ot ran'.ti<·d air ari,;ing from the primary causes, and gi dug rise to asc·e11ding currents awl rain, may he so irregular iu form as not to safo;fy the conditions of a cyclone, except so imperfectly as not to gi,-e rise to much cyclonie action, and then we generally haye long-continued moderate rains without much wiml. Sometimes there are ReYeraJ rain centers within the area of low baroml'ter, awl they are sometimes found in tl1e an·as of hig-h baromett·r, and there are ali!o eeuters in tile area of low barometer wbete the rain iis in greater abundance tlmn else\\·llere. 'l'his simpls indicates that, in accordance with§ 32, cycloneis may exist within cycloni1· 8ystems, aud so in the ari:~as of higli barometer, and whereYer there an~ isolated ;;pots of rain within the area of low or high barometer, or places where there is greater abuudauce than elsewhere in the area of low barometer, we haYe the eYidence of the existeuce of a smaller cyclonic sxstem within a larger one. 85. Accordiug to the theory of the progrei;isin~ motions of cyclones in § 35, eYery c;rnlone originatiug near the equator should :fin;t be carrietl westward and toward the pok; then, after arri'\"'ing in the middle and highe1· latitudes, 8honld be carried eastward l\y.the prevailing curreut.s. To be assured that this is the case it is oul;v uecessary to glance at the charts which we now bare of the numerous tracks of cyclones originating near the equator in all longitudes and in hot It hemisphere8. But on account of tlJe various modi(viug iufluences, sbttt'd in that sectiou, there is a great diversity in rhe forms of these tracks and the \'elocitie8 of progress at different times and places, so that whPn the mariner is ad,~ised of the approach of a c_ycloue in the distauce by any of the usual indications, tlie best that he can do is to determine the probable cause and velocity by taking the arnrage of all for U1e locality and the season of the year, which can readily be dune from chartis upon which the tracks and rates of progress are laid down. But for this purpose be should ham charts for all parts of the globe of all the known tracks of cycloues giYen for the diflerent seasons of tl1e year, for they clmuge considerably with the seasons. There are certain parts of the globe and seasons of the _year in which the conditions seem to be especially favorable for the 01·igiuating of' cyclones. Of the well-developed c;rclones which originate near the equator, alld usually progress in a somewhat parabolic orbit into high latitudes, a very large and di8proportionate number seem to originate in the .A.tlantic, a little north of the equator, and almost exclusively in the latter part of summer and the first part of autumn. This admits of a very plausible explanation. According oo the theory no cyclone can originate at or

very near the equator(§ 4). The region of the trade-winds of the Atlantic are also uufavorable for their origination, since the steady currents, mostl,Y uear the surface of the earth, carry the vapor which they contain into or near the belt of calm awl cloud before it rises into rei,.,..ions where it is condensed aml gh-es out its latent caloric, upon which the 11ower of the cyclone, very much de1w11tls. The conditions then favorable for the origination of a cyclone are in or uear the calm and eloud belt, where and when this belt is at some distaiwe from tlie equator. Now, for the theoretieal reasons given in § 80, the calm-belt is farthest from the equator at the season, or very ueal'l,y, when these cyclones mostly originate, being then 10° or 150 from the equator, and when this belt recedes toward t.he equator the conditions become so unfavorable tl1at no cyclones originate here. In the China Sea and North Indian Ocean the equatorial calm-belt is Yery much deranged and broken np by the great rnonsoonH arising from tlrn wide range of ammal fluctuations of temperature in the interior of Asia. According to Dove, (Gesetz <ler Stlirme), the frequency of cyclones in the North Indian Ocean has two maxima, one in May and the other in October. These are the periods of the breaking up and changing of the monsoons, and accordingly then the conditions are more fayorable for the origination of cyclones, according to§ 83; for the8e monsoons are simply the exaggeration of the trades in the one case aml their complete reYersal in the other, by the great temperature disturlmnces in Asia. In the Chiua Sea the cyclones take place mostly in September an<l October, when the current arising from the great in draft into Asia cea8es; for some reason few occur at any other season of the year. 8G. The calm-belts of high barometer around the globe with their maxima ou the parallels of 300 or 3;;0 on the ~werage, do nut furnish favorable conditions for eith(·r the origination or support of c,Ycloues, since it is a belt of descentling currents, or rather of a ,~ery gradual settling down and flowing out of the air on both sides, near t,he earth's surface, and hence it is a belt of very dry atmosphere. There is therefore iu general very little cyclonic disturbance either in this belt or the belt of the trades, It is within this belt of high barometer aml tlie trades that we have the almost rainless regions of Peru, N1caragua, the Sahara or Great Desert of North Africa, and of Egypt, Arabia, Pcrisia, &c. Not, only Yery few cyloneis originate in this belt, but there seem to be only a few gaps where those originating nearer the equator can get through into the higher latitudes, notwith8tauding the general tendency they haYe to rnoYe from the equatorial toward the polar regions. The ])rincipal reason for tLis is tiJat this belt in ge11eral is too dry to support a cyclone while it is makiug its wa:r through. The;y, therefore, pa:-.s through, mostly, if not entirely, on the east sides of the two great oceans, those of the North Atlantic in the region of the Antilles, Florida, &c., and tl101-;e of the North Pacific Ocean in the region south and east of China and Japan. Here the northern tendeney of the air on the east sides of tbe areas of high barometer in these oceans, as obsoTed and ex11lained by theory in § 741 not only aids the cyclones in passing through toward thP polar regions, but it carries warmth and moisture with it for tlidr support. It is ouly at these placPs that the warm aud moist air of the equatorial regions passes into the middle and higher latit111l1·s; for the geucral returning or au ti trade currents of the upper regions are both cold and dry. The \varmer water of the Gulf Stream in tLe Atlantic, and of the corresponding current of the Pacific, is supposed to have considerable influence upon these cyclones, and they no doubt, aid them Home, and in some measure determine their routes and directions; but if we examme charts of tht> traekl' of tl1ese c;yclones, it does not appear that their influence is very great. At all othPr places around the globe the cyclones which originate a little north of the equator seem to i11cli11e toward higher latitudes, hut the tracks laid down on the charts are in all cases short ones, and none of them extend through the belt of high barometer, but it is possible that the c_yclones may, under certain unusually favorable circumstances, get through into the higher latitudes. The progres8fre velocities of the cyclones, while near the equator, is not nearly so great as it is in the higher latitudes. The reason of this is that this progressive motion at first is nearly west· ward and depends mostly upon the general westward motion of the atmosphere, which is very small, except near the earth's surface, in comparison with the rapid eastward motion in the middle and higher latitudes, at considerable elevations, upon which the progressive motions of tbe cyclones there depend. At the vertices of the parabolic storm tracks, where the progressive motion is directly toward the pole, and is independent of the east and west motious of the atmosphere, but depends

entirely upon the general tendency to move from the equat-0r toward the pole, and upon the gentle currents in the same directions on the east sides of the oceans where the cyclones gener.illy if not exclusively make their way through toward the pole, as has been explained, the progressiYe Yeloc. ities of the cyclones are the smallest, as theory requires and as obser-rntion shows. 87. Excepting the cyclones which in summer and autumn originate near the equator and pass ou the east sides of the great oceans toward the pole, the cyclones of the mi-0.dle latitudes originate in these latitudes, and the strong eastward tendency of the general motions in tllese latitudes, especially in the upper regions, in which the cornleusatiou of vapor and the power of the cyclone is mostly, carries the cycloneR forward in this direction, the relocities and directions being somewhat modified by the several other circumstances stated in ~ 05. 'rlmt this eastward progressive motion of the cyclones depends, in some measure at least, on these general eastward motions of the atmosphere, is shown by the fact that the progressive motions of the cyclones eastward is greatest in winter and least in summer, just as in tlie ca8e of the general motions of the atmosphere, as shown by Table XI, Part I. This is shown by Loomis"' from the Signal Se1Tice observations, according to which the Yelocities in the United States are nearly oue-halr greater in winter than in summer. It is true this is not the exact proportion in which the general eastward motions of the atmosphere of winter exceed those of summer, tbe former being more than twice as great as the latter according to the table referred to, but the progresi>iYe motions of the cyclones in summer are increased because the cloud and region of coudeusation of vapor is generally higher then than in winter, and hence the controlling power Qf the eyelones being up where the eatstward motion is greater, the cyclones rno,,e eastward with greater \"elocity on that account. If we examine the charts of the United States Signal Serdce it is seen that while the tracks of cyclones, or areas of low barometer, keep somewhat Oil the same latitudes a()ross the .American continent, and likewise aeross the Atlantic, in winter it is very different. .At this season most of the. cyclones originating at, or arriving at the western coast of North America in the middle and higher latitudes, seem to avoid the interior of the continent aml to pass in a southeasterly dirootion oil the west side of the continent into low latitudes, passing around by Texas or the Gulf of Mexico, along tbe eastern side of the United States, up toward Greenland and the northern part of t,he Atlantic, and crossing it at a higher latitude than they usually do in the summer season. The interior of North America, in the winter season, is an area of high barometer, very dry and cold. If a cyclone from the Pacific could be carried into this area at this season it could scarcely subsllit and get through to the eastel'r1 side. Besides, the isotherms at this season run around this area somewhat as the tracks of the cyclones just described, leaving the colder and dryer region on the left, and tbe warmer aurl moister one on the right, all the way around. Hence the tracks of the cyclones follow around somewhat in the directions of the isotherms, in accordance with the theory in ~ 34. 88. In the southern hemisphere, as in the northern, observatiou i,ihows that the cyclones origi nating a little south Cff tb.e equator, likeVl-ise tend, in connection with their westward motion, to move also from the equator toward the llole, as theory requires, but that the:'-' cannot in genera} get through the belt of high barometer and dry atmosphere with its middle about, the parallel of 300, except on the eastern Sides of the continents where there are slight currents passing from the tropical to the middle latitudes, aiding the progress of the cyclones in that direction and carrJ'ing aqueous vapor for their support. Hence all the cyclones originating in the region of the South Indian Oooa.n, between the equatur a.nd the tropic, are carried westward until they arrive where the currents a.re deflected southward by the continent of Africa by which they are enabled to pass through int.-0 tbe strong eastward current· of the middle latitudes, where they are rapid!,. can·ied eastward. The vicinity of Mauritius and :Madagascar is, therefore, on the great highway of thei>e cyclones, as that of the Antilles and Florida in the northern hemisphere is for thoRe which originate in the Atlantic a little north of the equator. · These cyclones originate mostly during the summer season of the southern hemisphere, becau1m th.en the great northea.st monsoon of India. extends considerably south of the equator, becoming there a. northwest wind, and meeting the southeast trades 10° or 150 south of the equator, and forcing the equat.orial calm-belt down t.o these latitudes.t Hence the conditions are favor.ible for

the origination of these cyclones only a,t this season, for the reasons given in § 8.), in the case of the cyclones originating north of the equator in the Atlantic. In the .Atlantic south of the equator there is another area of higher barometer with winlls gyrating somewhat around it, as then-1 i:; north of the equator, giving· rii,.;e to a. gentle current. on the east coast. of South America, from the equator toward the middle latitudes; as there is at the Antiller; and the southern part of the l7nited State;;; but we hani no aceount of any cyclones passing from the latitudes near the eqnator, througli lmn· into the great eai;tward current of the middle latitudes, as at l\la<lagascar and l\laul'itins aufl on the east side of the Atlantic in the northern hemisphere. The reason of this is, that the southea!'t trades here generally extend enth'elJ across the equator, and even during the summer of the southern hemispherB, wheu c;yclones origi· nate in the South Indian Ocean, the trades here extend almol't u11 t-0 the equat-Or, so that the calmbelt, in or near which, only, these cyclones originate when it is sufficiently far from the equator, is too near the equator for cyclones to originate in the part of the Atlantic immediately south of the equator. 8!1 We ha \-e seen that in both hemispheres, all around the g"lobe 1 there is a belt of high barometer with its maximum about the J>arallel of 30° or 35°, but that the barometer stands higher on these parallels in the middle of the great oeeaus than on and near the continents on account of the gyrations of the atmosphere arising from the deflections of the continents, causing a pressure in ward from all sides on account of the force arising from the earth's rotation. These areas of high barometer, as is the case in areas of high barometer generally, are dry, arnl hence cyclones do not originate much within these areas, nor can they generally be supported long if they can get in from without. But since the air gyrates somewhat arouml these areas, there is no tendency of cyclones to enter them, except on the eriuatorial sides, since there the general tendency of cyclones is toward the 11oles. The great calm-belts of the general motions of the atmosphere of these latitudes pass through these areas, and hence they are areas of com1)arative calm, both as regards the general motions of the atmosphere and likewise cyclonic disturbances. The general tendency of cyclones is to skirt around areas of high pressure, since there are currents on all sides around them, but in these cases this is prevented on the east sides of them by the general tendency of cyclones to move toward the pole, and hence the cyclones originating near the equator at certain seasons only of the year rnm·e around these areas of high pressure on the equatorial, western, and northern sides. <her the whole interior of these areas, therefore, in the Nort,h Atlantic and Pacific, in the northern hemisphere, and tlle South Atlantic and Pacific and the ludian Oceans, in the southern hemisphere, there is little danger from any cyclonic disturbances, except around the outskirts during the cyclone :,;eason. The progressirn velocities of C)'clones around these area;; are ditt"e1·ent in different oceans, and in different parts of the tracks in the same ocean. On the equatorial sides, where the cyclones are canied westward by the general westward current, the velocities are greater than they are where the eyclones curve around into the higher latitudes, since here there is only a small part of the general westward current detlected around, and consequently the velocity of the atmospheric cttl'l'eut is Yery small. After arriving in the middle latitudes, where the general eastward n1ocity of the atmosphere is comparath·eJy great, the progressive velocities are much increased. The Southern Indian Ocean i::; rema1·kable for the small progressive velocities of its cyclones. According to Piddington, these are often oniy two or three miles an hour, especially at the vertices of the parabolic tracks where they curve around int-0 the middle latitudes. The reason of this is that there is only a small deflection of the westward currents within the tropic by the continent of Africa, an<l hence but a slight gyration around the central area and increase of barometric pressure, 1-lO that the cyclones are carried around very slowly. The more nearly c,rclones can get within the central parts of these areas, the slower their progrnssive velocities; and it therefore sometimes happens that c;-,-clones in the Southern Indian Ocean are apparently almost stationary. The c;yclones which originate in the middle latitudes at all seasons of the year, and those which come through int-0 these latitudes froru near the equator at certain seasons, are carried fo1·ward eastward in these latitudes until they die out; but here likewise, as we have seen, they have a tendency to skirt around the area of high pressure and dry air of the interior of North America

in the winter season by cnrving around toward the equator, and they, no doubt, have the sanw tendency on the eastern continent, but on account of its great extent they probably neyer sueeeetl in getting entirely around. The middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere, with a constant eastward current at the earth's surface of about 30 kilometers per hour, and much greater in the upper regions, with scarcely any interruption from the continents, is a great highway for cyclones, which move with a great progressive velocity, often perllaps entirely around the globe; and touching tlle continents at Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, gfre rise to the great storms and bai:-ometric oscillations which are experienced at these capes.

90. Tornadoes are simply special cases of cyclones, go.-erned by the same general principles, and the conditions are in general represented by the same equations. The foundation, therefore, of the theory of tornadoes has already been laid. in the theory of cyclones in the :first chapter, 80 that it is not necessary here to go bru3k to first principles, but merely to adopt, by means of slight changes, the equations tl1ere given to the special case of tornadoes. The principal feature which distinguishes tornadoes from what are especially called cyclones is the smallness of their extent, and this is due to the difference in the initial temperature conditions which give rise to each. These, in the case of cyclones, consist in gradients of increasing or decreasing temperature from the center to the external part of a somewhat circular area, depending mostly upon the primar.\' causes of temperature disturbance, the range of which is represented by t'c - V in the first member of (32), and as a disturbance of this kind must generally extend over a considerable area the dimensions of cyclones, even in their initial stages, must be conespondingl;r large. The conditiom~ of tornadoes depend rather upon the vertical relations of temperature between the different strata of the atmosphere, or values of J, and J in the Reconcl member of (32). \Yben these are such as to giYe a state of unstable equilibrium of the atmosph"re, as heretofore explained, we have a condition in which a torna.do is liable to occnr at any moment from any slight local temperature disturbance or mechanical impulse, which gh-es the undn strata a little greater tendency to burst up through the overlying strata at any one point than anywhere else. Bence, tornadoes are gen~rally of very small extent, and, although very similar to cyclones in many respects, they form a distinct class, and it can scarcel~· be said that the~e is an~· connecting link between th~m and cyclones, or, iu other words, that the smaller c_yclones commence where the larger tornadoes leave off. 91. The general equations of a cyclone (1) are also applicable to a tornado, but, on a-0connt of the small extent of the latter, the terms in those equations depending upon the earth's rotation and containing n as a factor may be neglected in the theory of tornadoes without sensible error. At the distance of 1 1000 meters from the center of a tornado, on the parallel of 4501 the lim~ar gyratory velocity, due to the earth's rotation, is only about 185 meters per hour, or 0.05 of a meter per second, and at other distances nearer the center less in proportion to the distance. This is so small in comparison with the usual velocities in tornadoes that it may be neglected. Since in equations (1) the plane of P 1 and origin of hare entirely arbitrary, we can put P for 1 P , and if the quantities in the equation all belong to the same stratum h vanishes. Hence, neglecting the term depending upon the earth's rotation, and putting for · its value in (2), we get

the notation being the same as in § 3. The value of C. therefore, in this case, depends upon the sum of the initial moments of gyration relative to the earth's surface around the center of the tornado, and is independent of the gyration around this center depending upon the effect of the earth's rotation, represented by the terms r 2 n cos v,. In cyclones, we have seen, this term determines the manner of gyration from right to left in the northern hemisphere, and the contrary in the southern; but in tornadoes the manner of gyrati-On depends upon the sign of c, and consequently upon tile moments of gyration which the air, with reference to the center of the tornado, may ha·rn at the time of the origin of the tornado. The sum of these moments can rarely happeu tQ be exactly o, and the slightest tendency one way or the other gives rise to very rapid gyrations around the center where r is sma11, as must be seen from (b). This is exemplified in the case of a large fl.at basin of water wllich is allowed to run ont through a small hole in the center. The water may have no perceptible g.rration or motion of any kind, yet near the center it will generally run into a gyration the one wa.r or the other. The case is somewhat similar in a tornado, except that, instead of running down, the air of the lower strata, in a state of unstable equilibrium, runs up through those ahoYe at the vlaec where it receives its first impulse. 92. lu C~'cloues the gyrations, since the,y de.pend upon the earth's rotation, are kept up as long as there is an interchanging motion between the central and exterior part, due to difference ot temperature, and they are merel,y modified, but not entirely destroyed, by friction. They therefore continue as long as the difference of temperature and the radial interchanging motion continue, and hence they may continue for a long t.ime. It is otherwise with tornadoes. Since the gyra.tious in these depend entircl~- npon the initial moments of gyration, and the tendency of friction. is to constantly reduce these, and consequently the gyratory velocities, the air is soon h1·ought tn a state of rest., or 1iearly so, and the course of the tornado is run. If the sign of (Jin (c) were ent.irely accidental, and not determined one way rat11er tha11 the other by any existing circluustances, the gyrations of tornadoes would be as often in one directfon as tbe other. This, howm·er, doeR 11ot seem to be the case, but they are generally, if not always, in the same direction as those of cyclones. The reason of this is that the atmosphere is hardly ever entirely free from cyclonic action, which, though almost or quite imperceptible, is yet sufficient t-0 determine the manner of tbe gyrations of a tornado; for in order to do this, it is not necessary that the center or the tornado should coincide with the center of cyclonic action, but simply that it should be somewhere within the area of the gyrations. · 93. In a cyclone, we have seen that the effect of the term depending upon the earth's mtation causes the gyratory velocity at the same distance from the center to be different in the upper and lower strata. In tornadoes, the eflect of this term being insensible, the tendency of friction is to reduce these velocities, where difforent, to the same, except near the earth's surface, where friction is great., and where, consequently, the gyratory velocities are much less. Since the friction term in the last of (a) bas boon neglected in obtaining (b), of course this last equation is not strictly appli· cable in the cases of friction, especially very near the center, where the gyrations are very rapid, and consequently friction much increased. In the case of cyclones we bav-e seen that the effect of friction is very great, and the actual velocities of gyration fall very far short of those given by the hypothesis of no friction. But a cyclone of the usual dimensions is a very broad flat disk of atmosphere, very many times greater in width than in altitude, especially if we neglect the upper very rare part of it, while a tornado may be regarded al> a column of gyrating air in which the altitude is several times greater than its diameter. Hence, while the gyrations of such a disk are very much affected by friction, those of a tornado, except near the earth's surface, are affected very little, and in the upper regions they may be regarded as conforming very nearly to the law of (b), and con!lquently the gyratory velocities, at different distances from the center, are very nearly

In the initial stages 7 however, in which the whole energy of the tornatlo is mostly spent in overcoming the inertia of the air and in producing the gyrations, the Yelocitif'~ of gyration above and he.low may he, anfl generally are, very different, and at different distane('" from the center llo not at all conform t,o tlie law of (71), since they t11eu dq>entl upon tlrn initial gyrations wllich the air may 11ave; aud it, h; ouly afte:r the torna<lo has l>een Rome time iu action, iu a. quiescent atmosphere, or at least one iu which the progrcssiYe motions of the strata abon~ a.1111 below are the same, that the Yelocities ahon· and below, except near the earth's surfar-e, hecouw nearly the same, and they conform approximately to the law of velocities itffersely a«s the distance. 94.

The last term of the second member depends upon the friction and the inertia of the air in its radial motion toward or from the center, and is gcnemlly very small, especially at some distance aboYe tl1e eartll's surface. The equation shows the relation between the pressures at the same altitude at different distances from the center. Since the friction of the gyratory motion bas been neglected, it is only a1>proximate, but very nearly correct, except near the earth's surface. ThtJ ya Jue of' r,,, therefore~ i;hnnlrl lw that existing at some short distance above the earth's surface. 95. Besides the comparati\Tdy small amount of fricti011 i11 a torrnt1lo, af'. shown in ~!t:.!, tliert' is also another circumstance whicb causes the violence of a tornado to be much greater than that ot' a cyclone. It is seen from (9), neglecting n cos ,,, in tltis case 1 that the force whi<'h o\Terconws tltt· friction and inertia of the air, in tl1e gyrations ir a tor11ailo, depends upon 11, that i,_, tlu~ Yelol'.it,Y of motion toward or from the center. Now, in an ordinary cyclone we hani seen that, in co111seque11ce of the effect of the earth's rotation, the. gyrator:r velocitie«s are less above than below in proportion to the amount of temperature di,,,turbance; and that tlrn greater part of the forne, depentling upon the temperature gradient, which keeps up the interchanging motion between the centraf' and external part, is counteracted h.r this difference of the gyrations abm'e and helow, which t~'luse8 the centrifugal force to be greater below than above. In the tornado, however, in which the term depending upon the earth's rotation is inseusible, the vfllocity of the gyration:.; is the same a how~ as below, and hence the full force due to the temperature gradient is spent in keeping up the motiou toward the center below and from it above. This gives a greater value to u, and hence to th<> fo1·ep which overcomes the inertia and friction in the ~~ratory motion of a tornado. 96. In the theory of the general motions of the atmosphere, and also iu that of cydones, tLe effect upon pressure of the inertia of the air was shown to be so small that it could ue neglected without sensible error, but in tornadoes the velocities are frequently so rapidly accelerated, and consequently the effect of inertia so much increased, that it now becomes necessary to take it into acoount. From (8), Part I, if we neglect the terms depending upon the earth's rotatiou, anil 1·eganl P simply as arising from "gravity antl the iner1ia of the air, we readily obtain

By comparing the Yalue of D,h in the preceding equation (m1 ) with that of (m) we get for unsaturated air
(n)

In tbe mterior of a tornado with rapidly a8cending eurrenfa, and where the air is not saturated, we can put .d equal to this value. If then, in the surrounding parts of the atmosphere we haw J' = 10.1, and(,= 80°, putting 1< = 0 at the surface, where h = o, (n) gives at the altitude h = t ,000 meters, u = 6m nearly, for the nlocity per second of the ascending current at that height, and hy the formula it increases in proportiou to the altitude. In the center of a tornado, bowe\er, the r~iou of cloud and saturated air generally eomei;; down to the earth, or nearly so, so that the ascending· currents are mostly of saturated air. In this case it is seen from Table I that the value of J is 111nl'.b lesR than in the case of dry air, and \aries considerably with temperature and altitude, and the air is in a state of unstable equilibrium especiall~· in the summer season, with a Yalue of' J' less than one-half of the value of J in (o), required in the case of unsaturated air. By <~omparing the valueR of J in Table I with those of J' in Table II, we have, for the altitudes of the principal part of the cloud region iu the summer season, J' - J equal to about 00.15, and hence tlie average state of the atmosphere at this season i;.; that oi' tmstable eq11ilibrium when the air is 8aturatecl. Tornadoes therefore very fre·1uentl~-, if not generally, originate first in the cloud strata of the atmosphere, and afterward extend down to the earth. 'Yith the Yalue of ...!' - .J abm:·e, supposing it to be constant for all altitudes from 11 to 11., h;\' putting It,= o, and t = 20°, (n) gin·s 11 = 7.1'" for h, - h = 1,000 meters, aml iu proportion for other values of h, - h. But the value of J' ma.y ditfor very much from the aYerage values of the table, and give at different times, yery different values of J' - J. In the winter season it is seen, from the Yalues of J in the table, that J' - J is mostly, if not alwa;ys, negative, nnd henl'e we then rareljT, if ever, have the conditions necessary for a tornado. It should be borne 41 mind here that beside the state of unstable equilibrium, it is necessary to haYe some initial gyrator,v motion iI1 order to have a tornado. Frnni a comparison of the Yalues of J' in Table ll, deduced from Glaishcr's balloon ascents, with those of J iu Table I, it is seen that in high and cold altitudes the value of J' - .J in (n) is negati H', and consequently 1t is decreased as 7t is increased, and hence the atmosphere is in a state of stable equilibrium and the ascending currents from the ren·rse state lower down may be very much retanled if not entirely brought to rest, and the air must conse!Jneutly fiow out from the central part at some intermediate altitude, as in the case of cyclone::;. \\'here J' - J is not constant but changes with the altitude by some unknown fuuctioIJ, the integration must he performed by meehanical quadratures, as in the case of Cj'Clones in~ 28. 98. In consillering the motions of solid bodies or partieles contained iu the atmosphere of a tomado, it is necessary to have some general expre;.;si011 of the amount of resi;.;tance which they suffer in their motions through it. Let us confine onrsch'cs to solid or liquid spheres simply, and

Frnm expm·imcnt.s made by Dr. Hutton with a whirling machine, as given by Professor Loomis·, the resistance of the air to a globe one inch in diameter, for all velocities from 5 up to 300 feet per f\f>cond, is represented very nearly by l{ = ,()(HJOH7~ it' ounceR, u being ex1)resse·l in feet per second . .Assuming that the resistance Yaries as the square of the diameter and density of the resisting medium, as deduced h,v Newton from theoretical considerations, and generally Yery nearly con· tirrued by observation, we shall have as a general expression, R= ,()()()()672 u· D's.

.A hailstone, tht'refore, one centimeter in diameter would fall through the lower atmosphere at the rate of 1:!.6 meters per second. At the J1eight of J,000 meters, where the \·alue of .~ is reduced to about 0.54, we should have u' = 1 i.I, and hence tl1e final velocits of r.ud1 a hailstone at that height would be considerably more. From the formula it iK seen that in the case of hailstones four times as great in diameter, the values of ·u' would he twice as great. In the case of au ascending current, with a velocit:-.· l"Jnal to n', the body would remain suspended in the air, arnl if this velocity were greater than u1 it would be carried upward with a velocity equal to the excess of the velodty of the ascending current over the value of u' gi\·en by the formula abo,·e in any case. Iu the case of a hailstone four ceutimeters (l.H i11elws) in diameter at the height of 5,000 meters, we have D = 4, aud s = 0.54, and with these .-alnes ( zi') giYes u 1 = 3-!.2 meters for the velocity of the a:;cemliug current requil'ed to keep such a hailstone suspended in the atmosphere at that height, and with au ascei·diug current of H.:.! meters per second it would be carried upward at the rate of 10 meters per second. The ascending velocity required to sustain a raiu-drop iu tlrn air is gh·en by ( p). If tl!e diameter of the drop is 0.4 centimeter, the formula giYeR u' = 2.7 metns for the .-elocit,y of the ascending current required to keep it suspended in the air uear the earth's surface wl1ere s = 1, but in high altitude8 it requires ccm8idera.hly more. Mr. Dines has measured rain-drops a:; small as .0033 iuclies (.083mm) in diameter.+ WitJ1 D = .0083'"' (p) gin:·s 11 1 = 1.2 mete:r,:s for the ascending velocity required near the earth's surface to keep the surnlleist measured rain-drop from falling to the earth. Cloud and fog partides may he many times less, and hence the ascemling \·elocities required to keep them snspeu<led in the atmosphere would be almost imperceptible. l\fr. Dines 11as mea:;ured fog particles a:s :small as .000():.! i11cht>s iu diameter,+ and those uot meai:;urable may be very much less. The law of resistance as the square of the diameter may uot hold Yery accurately for particles so very small, IJLtt the formula aJlplicd in these cases at least shows that the a . .,-;l'endiug velocities required to sustain them iu the atmosphere is extremely srna.ll. 99. Where a body near th(i .-ortex of a toruado is kept suspemled in the air by ascending currents and at the same time gyrates rapidly around the center, tlie centrifugal forc11 ari:;ing from these gyrations may be much greater than that of gnnitr, and a enrreut of air toward the center is necessary to keep such bodies from beiug driYen by thi:; centrifugal forcii awa.r from the center, with a velocity much greater in some cases than wonltl lie required in an ascending current to keep the same body from falling.

cannot commence unless the air is either saturated down to the earth's surfaDe, or the unsaturated air there is in the state of unstable e,quilibrium, whicll would requirn the rate of dimiuution of temperature or value of ,;J' tbere to be more than IJ0.!)!)2. Bat if toma<loc>< arp included in a cyclone, as they generally are, we then llave the satnratt·!l air up i11 Ilic cloud region, arisiug from tile ascending current. of the interior of the cyclone, and we then liaYe tlie stat<' of unstable equilibrium with a value of J', in high temperatures, of only about 0°,4 and upward, <'Yen when t11e air near the earth's surface is neither saturated nor in the state of un:-;tahle equilihriam of unimturuted air. In such a case the gyrations commence first up in the clontl regio11, but soon exkud down to the earth's surface, since the diminution of harometri!~ press nm in the ('.entra l part arh;iug from the gyrations above causes the air to rusli iu from all si(lt>s toward the ce11ter i11 the lower part of tlie atmosphere. Of course, with the preceding ccrnditious, we must also have the other condition of a tornado(§ 91), which is an initial gyrator,y motion rela1iwly to tile center. 104. With the assumed values; of r in the preceding table, and the correspondiug computed va.lne.s of h, in No. 1, used as co-onlinatfls, the cnrved li1rn in Fig. 14, repre:-;enting tile stratum of equal temsion P1 and temperature ti, and which i,,; the hase of the cloud, ii:; laid down. The cmTed lines with arrows represent the fatPral and ascending curn·nt:-; of the ail', the fonuer, near the earth, being mostly toward the center, in order to supply the !ha ugh t of the asct·mliug curreut in tlle central part, but ill the upper regions there must of course lH· a flowi11g out from tlie center. In connection with these motions, it must be borne in mirnl tlmt the air has also a g,rratory motion, and Yery rapid 11ear the center. Without this we shoul<l han· simply the ClllT('Il ts of Espy'l'i t lieory. \Vherevcr the currents of air enter withiu or alHJ\'C the li1w me11tioned ab·ffe, the invisi\Jlc aqueous vapor of the unsaturated air is now comleu;:;ed alHl lweome" visihle in the form of doml. Of course the original cloud particles are extreme!,\- small, but are co11ti11ually increasing in size by aggregation, since the smaller particles are carried up more rapidly tlia.11 the larger ones, and tbeJ- are, therefore, constantly coming in contact with one another." If they become too large to hP kept suspended in the atmosphere by the ascending currents, they fall directly back to the earth, but if not, they are carried up where the currents an\ outward from the center, and arp. carried out from the ce11ter where there are no ascendin!!: currents, or only n\ry foe!Jlt· ones, an<l where they fall as rain at some distance from the center. The precediu; is for tlw most part truP in or<li11ary cyclones of large dimensions, except that the comparatively feeble a;:;cending- currents do not preYent tile rain from falling at any part after the drops attain a certain si.r,e. Jn a cyclone also the clond does not generally come down to the earth in tile ceuter, but is onl,\' a little lowered. 105. The ascending velocity (u) iu t.he interior of a tornado, as ginm b,v (n), depends entirely upon the difference of temperature between the interior aud the l'lnrrnumling parti:i. and is independent of any gyratory Yclocity around the center, since the terms in (f) coutaiuing i·. as a factor and the friction term Fu' were neglected in obtaining (fl) and (n ). It is seeu that from this source we get only very moderate ascending velocities in tlic interior of a tornado, upon any reasonable and probable assumption of decrease of temJJerature with altitude in the surrounding uudisturhed atmosphere, as baa likewise been shown by Dr. He;ye.t V\'ith the better knowledge whie11 we now have with regard to the rate of decrease of temperature with increa,;e of altitude, both in ascending currents and in the normal quiescent state of the air, the as;snmptions by wllich .Kspy obtained very rapid ascending currents by his theory, are now known to be not only improbable, but entirely impossible. It becomes neces;sary, therefore, to seek some other explanation of the powerful ascending currents which, from the observations of their mechanical effects, are known t-0 exist in the central parts of a tornado. We have seen in the theory of cyclones that all radial and vertical currents {lepend upon difference of temperature between the internal and external parts, and that when thi!'l difierence ceases to exist the cyclone soon vani8bes. It may ali:io be shown that when a is not a function of the temperature, equation (/) is satisfied 'with D,u = o, if v has the same value for all altitudes, and it is, therefore, satisfied without radial, and consequently without vertical motions. The radial and vertical motions, therefore, even where there is a gyrntory motion, depend upon the ditlerence

-0f temperature alreull.r reforred to, pro,·ided these gyratory motions are the same at all altitudes,
and the Ydodty of the ascending mirre11ts in 1lw interior is stHl given by (n). It bas beffil explained that all the strata, through friction aud other causes, although at first they may have differeut gyratory velocities, haYe a temleuc,Y to assnmc the same gyratory velocity, except those 11eaP tl1e earth's surfam1, where the velocities are much retarded and diminished lly the friction of tl1e earth'l'i surface. Let ui;; now suppose we hatl a toruado with ver~· rapid gyrations near the center at all altitudes, aud 1:mffering 110 resistance at tlte earth's surfo,(,>e. 'Ve might then have a large harometric depression in the cent er, due mostly to the centrifugal force of the gyrations, a.nd com1iarati\·ely little of it to diffl~rence of temperature between the interior and surrounding air. But 11otwithsta111li11g the gri~at lJarometric depression in this case, the velocity of the ascending currenti;; would be ouly those given lly (n), which, we have S{Jen, could in no case he Yery great. lOti. If we 11ow suppose that tlH~ barometric depression in the middle of the tornado is 30"'m, and tuat from sorne cause the gyrations near the earth's surface should cease, so that there would be no force to resist the pressure belmr towartl the center, then by (k), with t. = 30°, and 'u =()in this case, wn should ha Yen= 8± met«rs for the al';cendiug velocity per second, caused by this difference of pressure. After the currents arising from this difference of pressure have once i;;et in, of course some of this difference would lie i;;peut in overcoming the friction, Ro that, as in all such cases, the actual velocity would be 80IIie foi;;;,;. If we now suppose that the gyrations below are not entirely wanting, but that the Yelocity is dimini;;hed one-half, then the centrifugal force would be onefourth, and iso oHl)- one-.fonrth of the difference of pressure below would be counteracted by the ce.ntrifngal force of the gyrations. I1et us further suppose that another fourth is used in overcoming friction. \Ye would then Rtill lia\.-e a difference of 15'"m for overcoming the inertia of the air and producing an aseemliug· velocity. ~'ith this <lifi'erence, and with the same value of t,, (k) sti11 gives au ascending current with a velocity of 60 meters per rncond. It should be observed here that the direction of the current is not determined in (k), and cannot oe vertical at or very m~ar the earth's surface, but from the circmnstauces of the tornado must become approximately so at a short distauce al1ove the earth. V\' l' now see bow the enormous velocities of the ascending currents in a tornado may be caused by the difierences between the gyratory velocities above and those very near the earth's surface. The former prevent the air moRtl,V from pressing in to fill up the partial vacuum nea:r the center, wl1ile the smaller gyratory nlodties near the earth allow it to rush in there mostly to SU[>l}Iy the draught arising- from the diminished pressure withiu. As these gymtions depend upon the initial moments of gynition of the air ju the viciuit.Y around the center, the energy of tile tornado dept>Il(ls mostly upon these, the effect of which, by the nature of tornadoes, is mostly concentrated uear t11e 1·e11ter. But the temlency of friction is to constantly use up this energy, so that the tornado cauuot continue very long. The initial motions, however, by whieh the air is caused to run iuto ra11iil gyrations around the center depends upon the temperature differences, without which the tornado cannot originate. 107. In order to account for the immense amount of min which often falls in a tornado in a short time, it is 1wcPssary to liase an estimate of the amount of aqueous vapor carried by the ascending currents of t.bti interior part np througl1 the bitse of the cloud into the upper regions, where it is condensed, and also of the depth of rain arising from its condensation if it all falls directly back to the earth. Let

e = the elastic force of aqueous vapor at the l)ase of the cloud ; d = the depth of rain resultiug from the condensation in the ascending current, aupposing that the current extemhl so high that t,he vapol' is all condem;ed.
Then, with an ascending velocity, u, the weight of aqueous vapor carried up per second, measured by the mercurial colunrn, is U.6~3 e1t: 7980. Multiplying this by 13.6, the specific gravity ofm~rcury, we get d = .OOlOGeu for the depth of r:tin given by the condensation per second. With a temperature of 210 at the base of the cloud, ais in our assumed example, No. 1, we have from Regnault's table, e = .0265"' for the elastic force of saturated air, and with this value the preceding formula gives for a.n ascending

velocity of 60 meters per second d. = .0016Srn per second or 0.101'" (about 4 inches) ller minute for the depth of rain, if it were to fall uirectly hack. Our problem is too complex, taking into acconnt friction and all other circumstauces, to deter-. mi11e the relation between the radial and vertical v<>locities; but we know that the radial compouent must be toward the vortex in the lower part of the atmosphere in order t-0 supply the draught of the asce11ding current, and greatest very near the earth, whem tl11'~ are least counteracted h~· the centrifugal force of the gyrations. But somew1iere above, it m<iy he at a great altitude or not, according to the rate of diminution of temperature with increa8e of altitude in the surrounding quiescent atmosphere at the different altitudes, there must be a flowing out of the air abo,,-e, RO tlmt in tbe ascent of the air there is an inclining toward the vortex helO\Y, as repr!-'seuted iu Fi~. 14, and from it above. The vapor, therefore, aho>e a certain altit11dc is gradually diRpersNL arnl, if condensed into rain, it falls at some distance from the \'ortex of the tornado. "'it!J an asl't'lldingvelocit.y of 60 meters per second the rain would all bti carried up to an altitrnle where it would be carried out from tlle vortex, and hence none of it would fall <hre<'tly back. According to (p) ~mch a velocity would keep suspended in the air, at an altitude where the density it; dimiuishetl one-half, and where consequcntlJ' s = 0.;), a globe of water, if such could exiRt, with a diauwter D = 1.8'm (about 7 inches). \Vith such an ascending velocity, therefore, no min could fall direct])· had;:, hut there would be an immense fall of rain around about in the vicinity, especially if the torwvlo in its irregular progressive motiom1 should remain stationary, or near1y so, for i>everal minutes ov<>r the same spGt. Tlrnt an ascending velocity of 60 meters per secon<l, obtained fmm the assumptions of the preceding section, is 110 unusual velocity in tor11adoes, will be shown from the obscn·cd mechan· ical effects of tornadoes. 108. If the velocity of the ascending current is not so great that the rain is all carried up to where the cmTents are outward from the -.ortex, and where con.seq nentl,v the water is disperned, and yet great enough to prevent its falling l>ack, then in the whole lower part of the elom1, up perhaps to the altitude of 3,000 metern, there may be an a.cc111n11lation of rain, preventet1 from falliug by the ascending currents, and from being dispersed by the intlowin~ currents from all sides toward the vortex. Of courHe the sustaining of this water in the eloud uses up the energy of the tornado and hastens its breaking up. Suppose the f:'yratory motions and energy of the tornado were such as assumed in§ 106, which give an effective force of 15mm for producing ascending currents in the interior; if we now suppose that the interior is so charged with water as to dimiui:sh this effective force from 15mm to 3mn·, this would require a weight of water equal to l:Jmrn of mercury or a depth of rain equal to 12 x urn= rn3mm (about G.3 inches), and the 3"',. remaining, by (j) or (k), would still give an ascending velocity, according to (p), much more tllan sufficient to keep the rain from falling in drops of the largest size, for by the former we should still luwe au a,;cencling velocity of about 27 meters per second, and by the latter this would support a drop with a diameter D = 4'm. If we now suppose that the energy of the tornado and the velocity of the ascending currents are being gradually diminished, either by the accumulation of water in the cloud, or the effect cf friction, thls accumulation of water may all fall to the earth in a very short time, and giYe rise to what is called a cloud-burst. This is especially liable to occur in mountainous regions ; for if we suppose that a tornado heaYily charged with water is modug towanl the Ride of a mountain, l\f, as represented in Fig. 13, its coming in contact with the mom1tain wonld interfere n'l'y rnuch with the gyrations of the tornado aud the inflowing currents below, and tend to break up the whole system almost; at once, and let the whole accumulation of watel' drop suddenly down. Hence cloud-bursts usually occur on mountain sides.* 56. The water in cloud,bnrsts does not generally fall as rain, bnt is poured d01rn. J,ong before the ascending currents are so reduced as to allow the water to fall in dropR it Reems to collect together at certain placeR and force its way downward through the ascending current in a stream. This it would naturally do, since we cannot suppose that the water is eYer evenly distrihuted oYer any given place or that the velocities of the ascending ctirrents arc everywhere in the same Yiciuit.y

the same. A considerable mass having been collected at certain points, it is then enabled to force its wa_y through and draws into its train much more from all sides on its way down, so that it may ~mount to a continuous stream kept up for several minutes. Of course, having once made an opening for itself, its -..~elocit.;\~ is gradually accelerated, so that on reaching the earth the velocity may become immense and tbe stream strike with great force. Each one of these descending streams may make a great hole or basin in the ground; and on a steep mountain side, if the stream continues for a short time, it may give rise to a mountain 8lide: or at least to a great ravine, carrying rocks and trees with it down the mountain side. Immecliately after the great tornado at Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, on the 19th of June, 1838, Esp;\' visited the vicinit)' and examined the sides of the ridges and mountains. He found a great many holes eight or ten meters in diameter and one or two in depth, according to the nature of the soil and depth to the rock, the sides often cut almost perpendicularl:v down on the upper side, but entirely washed out below, so as to form tl1e commencement of a ravine. Sometimes the current seemed to strike with so great force that it made a great hole or ba:siu, and rebounded so as not to strike the ground again for a consi(lerahle distance. A considerable number of these holes in the earth were oftfln found close together in the same vicinity, indicating that the water was poured down through variom; opcningR at the same time. VVith regard to a ridge a half mile west of Hollidaysburg· he says: ''On examiniug the northnn side of this ridge, large masses of gravel and rocks and trees and earth, to tbe number of twenty-two, were found lying at the base ou the plain below, haYing been washed down from the side of the ridge by running wat~r. The places from wllich these masse,; started could easily be seen from the base, being only about thirty yards up the side. 011 going to the head of thef'e washes, they were found to be nearl,\- round basins from about one to six feet deep, without au~- drains leading into them from above. The olcl leaves of last year's growth, and other light materials, were 1,ving undisturbed above, within an inch of the rim of these basins, which were generally cut down nearly perpendicularly on the up11cr side, and washed out clea11 on the lower. The greater part of tLese basins were nearly of the same diam. eter, abont twent~· foet, and the trees that :sto0<l in tLe.ir vlaces were all washed out. Those below the basin were generally standing, and showed b~~ the le:owes aml grass drifted 011 their upper side, hmv hiµ·h the water was in mnning down the side of the ridge; on some it was as high as three feet. It probably, howeYer, dashed np on the trees above its general le\'el." (Philosophy of Storms, p. 37;'.i:) Tn an 1w1:01111t of a remarkable storm which occured at Catskill, July 26, 1819, it is stated that" the rain at times desce111led i11 very huge drops, arnl at times in streams and sheets." Again, another ob:-iern'r "particulad;\- noticed that he <'Onld see no drops of raiu, but the water seemed to deseend in stream8 allll sheets." lt is evi(lent from these, and many other similar paragraphs which might he citf'd, that the water in snch cases is poured down in streami;; and does not fall as rain, especia11y since the lig-htest materials were not washed away close to the margin of these basins on the upper sides referrP1l to aho\'e; and the reason of this, evidently, is that the accumulated water in the cloud is poured 1lown in stl\~am;.; while the ascending- currents are, as yet, too rapid to allow the largest drops to fall a8 rain. 110. It ma~' lw snvpose<l by sonw that a11 ascending velocit;r as great as 60 meters per second, as (leduced from the assumptions in§ 1OU, is not only extremely ran·, but one which never occurs in an~· tornado. This reqnireR a barometric depression in the interior of the tornado of about 30'"m. By examining column P' in the tahlc of § 10:!, it is seen that with the assumed conditions of our tornado, the theoretical te11sion of the air llear the center nearly va.uishes, and the interior becomes almost it 'aeuum; hnt of eonn;e Yt·ry gre.at allowanees must be made for friction so near the ceutt>r, where tlie theoretieal gyrator~· YelocitiPs almost hccome infiuite. For since tl1e air of the ascending current in tlle vortex is mostly 8llpplied by the current near the earth, where frietion is great ancl the g.yrator.r velocity much diminished, this affects tbe gyratory nlocities very greatly all tbe way up, so t.bat. they may differ very mul'11 near the center from tliose given by (d), in which the effect of friction is ueglecteu. Bnt tliat the tensiou of the air is Yer;\· much dimini8hed in the middle of tornadoes, much more than the assnme11 amount of 30"'m, is nb-..-ions from the ex11losive effects often observed iu the pai'.'lage of a tornado. The walls of houses are thrown outward in every direetion, cellar doors are lmrst open against the force of a hurricane wind, corks fly from bottles, and explo0

sions occur wherever air is oonfined, which denote a great and sudden diminution of the outside tension of the air from the diminished pressure in the tornado, so that ascending velocities may, no doubt, be often much greater than that wlliclt would arise from a depression of 30"'"' only in the interior of the tornado. This may also be inferred from the powerful force of the ascewling cm·rents in sustaining and carrying in the air large and heavy bodies t-0 a great distan<:e. Of the many examples which might be ~iven it is only necessary to cite one well-authentivated case: During tlie tornado at Mount Carmel, Illinois, June 4, 1877, we read that "the spire, -vane, arnl gilded ball of the Methodist church were carried fifteen miles to the nmtheastward." Nothing ii,; stated with regard to the material of which it was oonstructed, but we must infer that the ascending currents which could keep it suspended in the air for at least fifteen or twenty minutes must have had an enormous velocity. According to the formula (p) the ascending velocity required to keep a svhere one meter in diameter and of the specific gravity of water suspemlecl in the air is 135 meters 1)er second. On account of the probably greater surface, in proportion to the weight, in the case of the church steeple, the velocity required was i>erhaps much less than tbiR, but tl1is estimate in the case of the spbere enables us to judge better with regard to what WM; required in the case of the church steeple. One reason why heavy bodies are not more frequently lifted from the earth and carried up is that at the earth's surface the velocities are necessarily horizontal only and the vertical components of velocity are naught. If heavy bodies were generally in the situation of church steeples they would be more frequently carried off. 111. The expression of a,§ 107, is applicable to cyclones or to any ease of moderate rain in which there i8 little or no cyclonic action. Wherever there is cloml or rain there are a»cemling currents, but the velocities in such cases are generally very small in comparison with those in the vortices of tornadoes. With descending currents, however gentle, there can be neither cloud nor rain. If we suppose the velocity u of the ascending current to be only 3 metero; per second, and the air saturated at the temperature of 270, we have in this cased= .00318 x .026.'.i = .00008iJm for the depth of rain given per second by the vapor carried up if it is carried up so high that it is all condensed. In summer temperatures the mean rate of diminution of temperature with decrease of altitude, as may be seen from Table I, Chapter I, u about 0°.4 per 100 meters in the lower part of the cloud. Hence at the altitude of 3 1000 meters the air, which at the earth's surface is 30°, and 270 at the base of the cloud, as in our assumed example No. 1, is cooled down to mo, and at this temperature, according to Regnault's table, the ascending air has Jost half its vapor. Perhaps, Oil the average, the air does not ascend so high that it loses more than half, except in tormulom; and -violent cyclones, and in such cases, with an ascending velocity of 3 meters per second, we have d = .000042'" per second or .0025m per minute. ~ With an ascending velocity of 3 meters (p) gives, in th~ lower part of the at,inospherc, D = .05''"' for the diameter of the smallest drops which could fall, so that those still smaller wouhl be carried up and kept suspended in the air until b,v aggregation they should become large enough to fall, or unt.il the accumulation of water in the doud should diminish the velocHy of the ascending current sufficiently to allow them to fall. With an ascending velocity of 3 meters, only the larger drops can fall, so thJtt there cannot be much rainfall until the velocity is diminished. There is the1·eforc a limit to the rate of rainfall beyond which it cannot extend, and this must be considerably less than .0025'" per minute or 0.15m per hour. In the vortices of tornadoes, wltere tlte velocities are enormously great, of eourse there is a iuoportionat~ amount of vapor condensed to rain, but this, as we ha.ve seen, must either be poured down, or, if it falls as rain, must he scattered oycr a large area about the outer limits of the violent Ilart of the tornadoi where the ascending Yelocity is less than 3 meters per second. With very gently ascending currents the rain falls in small drops only, or a mist, before much aggregation takes place, especially if the air is nearly saturated aud the base of the cloud low. If the base of the cloud is high tltese small particles, in their slow fall toward the earth, may be entirely evaporated before reaching it. In such cases the lower base of the cloud bas no definite outline, and may fall considerably below the le.-el where oomlensation first takes place; for these very fine falling particles are simply doud particles not quire sustained, a.s usual, by the ascending current. 112. We come now ro the consideration of kail-sror9R8. In our assumed example of a tornado, No.1, the plain or stratum of zero temperature, according to (z) 1ind the illustrating example under

it, which applie.s in this case, is 6,428 meters almve the base of the cloud, and, according to theory, if we take no account of friction, is likewise brought down to the earth in the center. A vertical section of this stratum, passiiig through the center of the Yortex, is represented by the curved line in Fig. 13, between the dark and light colored cloud. Since great allowance near the center, w:Pere the gyrations are Yery rapid, must be made for the eftect of friction, the region of freezing and snow is Jlerhap.s um~er brought entirely dow 11 to the earth, but, in general, the base is simply depressed a little in the center, as represented by the base of the cloud in Fig. 17. Below this base in Fig. 13 aqueous vapor is condensed into cloud and rain, but above, into snow. The rain-drops below may be also carried np into the snow region by the ascending currents, and, if kept suspended there a little while, frozen into small hail. The.se may then be kept suspended near the base of the snow-cloud, and increase in size by the rain wl1ich is caJ'fied up into this region coming into contaet with them before it has had time to freeze. In this way compact homogeneous hail-stones of ordinary size are formed. At the height of nearly 7,000 meters, tlrn densit:.r of the air in comparison with that at the earth's surface is 0.42. 'Yitll this as the value of .~, (p') gives u' = 2om nearly as the ascending velocity required to sustain a hail-stone at that altitude one centimeter in diameter. This, from what we have seen, is no unusual velocity for ascending current8 in tornadoe8, and one which must frequently take place, even at great altitudes. It is not necessary that the hail~stones should remain in the freezing region along time, or remain stationary. They may be carried from the vortex out where the velocity of the aseending eurrent is small, and dropping down some distance, may then be carried in toward the Yortex by the iu:fiowing current on all sides, aud up agaiu rapidly into the freezing regiou. Tlie nucleus of large hail-stones is generally composed of compact snow. A small ball of snow, saturated with unfrozen rain which is carried up into the snow-cloud, is formed in that region and freezes, and being of less specific gravity than compact hail, is kept where it receives a thick coating from the rain carried up, as in the case of the small hail, and afterwards falls to the earth, eitller at somr distance from the center where the aseeuding currents are weak, or near the vortex after the rapidity of the ascending currents has become sufficiently diminished. As there may be in the case of cloud-bursts a great accumulation of rain and a sudden down-pouring of it all in a short time, so in a hail-storm a great quantity of hail may be collected in the lower part of the cloud, brougl1t in by inflowing currents on all sides toward the vortex, after the ascending currents have become too weak to carry it up aml throw it out above again, and are still too strong to permit it to fall. But soon the interior of the tornado becomes so overloaded, and the energy of the whole system so much spent, that the hail is all allowed to fall to the earth almost at once. Hence the almost incredible amounts of hail which are said to sometimes fall in a short time. llB. ·when a bail-stone is carried up in or near the vortex and carried out above to where the ascending current is too feeble to sustain it in the air, it graclually drops down and the inflowing current draws it in toward the vortex, where it is again carried up, and thus describes a sort of oval orbit, a, b, or a', 111 , as represented in Fig. 13. It ma,r be thrown up very high into the snow-cloud region, as at a, or hut little above its base, as at a'. It ma,Y des0ribe a number of such orbits or revolutions before it falls to the earth. 'Yhile high up in the snow.cloud region it receives a coating of snow, and then while descending very gently where the strength of the currents is not quite suffident to sustain it, and near the base of the snow region where rain yet unfrozen is carried up, it receives a coating of solid ice, which ma~· be continued for some time after it falls into the rain· cloud, since the hail-stone still continues for some time below zero temperature. After a little the inflowing current below, as at b an<l b', draws it again into the vortex, where it is again thrown up into the snow region to receive a new coating of snow. It thus receiv~ alternate coatings of snow and foe, and the number of each sort indicates the number of revolutions described, before it is permitted to fall to the eart11. When we consider the enormous amount of water which is rapidly carried up in a tornado, and that the lower part of the region of freezing must contain mostly rain, not yet frozen, since the snow there formed is at once carried still higher, we can readi1y nndersmml how the hail-stone can receive a considerable coating of ice in a short time. While high up in the snowcloud at its turning-point, as at a and a', it of course remains some time nearly at the same altitude, and, it is reasonable to suppose, long enough to receive its coating of snow. The accounts of hail-srones composed of a.nucleus of snow, and then of concentric layers of ice a.ud snow alternating, are quite numerous, but of the many cases which might here be cited we

shall refor to only a notable one whicb has occurred in somewhat recent times. In a liail-storm at Northampton, Mass., June 20, 1870, hail-stones foll weighing 01-er a half pound. i\fost of them were of the form of concentric layei·s like tl1e coats of an onion. ::"rlr. Hour:i·, who gtffe an acconnt of this storm (Silliman's .Journal, vol. uO, p. 403)~ state" that in one of them he counted thirtecu layen;, indicating, a.s lie says, that it had passed through as many strata of snow-y and yaporous cloud. The true explanation is that it oscillated as mauy times between the iain-cloud and snow-cloud regiom;, or, in other words, that it performed six or seYeu reYolutions with tlle lower part of its orbit in the rain-cloud and the upper part in the snow-cloud, as described abo,-e and as represented in Fig.13. The shape of hail-stones varies Yery much. Some are like a disk or Yery oblate spheroid. If for any reason the hail-stone becomes tile least flattened, the ascending current wllich keeps it suspended in the air also keeps its shortest d1ameter perpendieularl.r to the current, and 11ence it increases most on the edges. Others are of a pyramidal form. This has been explained hy Professor Reynolds in the paper alremly referred to. Hail-stones are sometimes of an enormous size. At Olmutz, on tl1e 31st of 1\fay, 1868, there was a hail-storm in which the larger stones were most1:-- of an irregular ova,l shape with uneven surface, the longest diameter being from 14 to 22 lines. Those from 18 to 22 lines all weighed over 3 dramR, and the greatest, 24 lines long1 weighed 5 draehms. (Zeit. Oester. Gesell. fiir !lfet., Band III, S. 318.) In Iowa, in April, 1880: "Hail-stones 12 inches in circumfereuce ha\"e 1Jee11 llH~asnrnd i11 Sac County. In Davis County a flattened disk of hail measured 4~ inches in diameter, and was 2 inches thick. In Iowa County a group of ice crystals fell, 2 inches in length, Ii inches wide, and 1 iuch thick." (Iowa Weather Service Press Bulletin, 82, April, 1880.) 114. In the second example of the table,§ 102, the gyrator,r vclocit,\- at the distance of r,. = 1,000 meters is assumed to be on1y 3 001 and tlle dew-point t 1 eight degrees below tlie temperature of the air f at the earth's surface at the distance r where the influence of the tornado does not affect the tension and temperature of the air at the surface. From the co-ordinates rand h 1 in the table tl1c cur\·ed line in Fig. l i is laid down, representing the stratum of the tension P and temperature t, where the aqueous \apor of the air in its asceLt and motion from all sicles toward the Yortex begim; first to be condensed into cloud, a.ml wllic11 is conse(1uently the base of the c1ond, as in t11P case of the tornado in example. No. 1. The difference etween the temperatme of the air at the earth's surface and the dew point being greater in this case, the height of the cloud at the distance r,, where it is not sensibly affected by the gyrations of the air, is also greater, but it is ne\·ertheless brought down to the earth at and near the center of the gJTations by the great rapidity of these gyrations there, as represented in_ Fig. 14, aud forms what is called a water-spout. Hence n wnter,spout i.~ ximp1y the cloud brought down to the eartlt fr01n a Mn.~idemble keight in a tapering form to a snul<ll /Jase by the rapid gyratory 11wtions of the air. When the spout occurs on laud it is often called a laud-spout, but land and water s1muts are essentially the same. A water-::ipout and tornado differ only in their dimensions. It is seen that the same principles and formul:e are applicable in both cases, but in the water-spout the gyrator,;velocity is less·, and consequently the base of the cloud or spout wltich reaches tbe eartli is smaller. In our example No. 2, (w) gives the radius of tl1e base n. = 24"', and (.i:) gfres v = l2;)rn as the gyratory velocity per second at the outer limit of the spout at or near the earth's surface. Nearer the center the velocity is very much greater. 'fhese are the thooretical velocities ol>tained b~- assuming v = 3m, Of course considerable allowance must be made for the effect of friction, which has not been taken into account in tlle formufa. In order to really ltave such velocitie" near the center iU any case of nature, and a spout as represented in Fig. 14, it would be necessary to ha\e 1'" perhaps considerably greater than 3"', but still it is reaclily seen how such it phenomenon can be produced upon the preceding princi1)les. · The destructive effects of so extremely great velocities can readily be imagined, especially at sea, where they are not so much diminished at and near the surface b;y friction. lf~ however, we examine the values of v in the table, § 102, it is seen that, although the Yelocities are enormously great near t.he center, yet they diminish very rapidlJ· with increasing distances from the center, so that these destructive meteors can be approached within a very short distance witli entire safoty, and they may pass very near without doing any injury.

at sea or buildings on land, their destructive effects may be very great and sudden, as is readily seen from theory, and often confirmed by observation. On land they are the same as toniadocs, except that their visible clouded part is not so low or so wide at the base, and the extent of the area of violence is less. Jn the center of a water-spout, as in that of a tornado, no rain falls or water descends in any form, though a heavy shower often falls in the vicinity. Ou land, dust and a great many light substances arc carried up in tlw interior, and as they arc being collected from all sides by the inflowing currents toward theTortex below, they often assume the form of a cone, which, in the first formation of the spout, seems to rise up and meet the descen<ling spout, falling apparently from tlie cloudR, and thus the whole phcuome11011 often assumes the form of an hour-glass. Of the great tornado of vVest Oaml1ridgc, August 22, 1851, it is said:* ''To some who watched it closely its form resembled a tall wide-spreading elm-tree. To others it appeared like an inverted cone. Several represent it as a dense uprigllt column, and a few as having the shape of an hour-gla..'ls-" The average width of destructive violence was about 300 meters. The several observers, no doubt, saw it at different times, and under somewhat different circumstances, in its progressive motion over the inequalities of surface. It was only wltere the earth contained a great amount of dust or other light materials on the surface that the right cone at the base was observed, and the whole assumed the figure of an hour-glass. This tornado evidently had a good deal of the water-spout feature about it, and it probabl.Y fell somewliere between the two fonns represented in Figs. 13 and 14. On the 14th of August, 1847, J>rofessor Loomis observed a water-spout on J1ake Erie,t the height of which, by a rough estimate, was about a half mile, and the diameter about ten rods at the base and twenty rods above. This coincides very nearly with our No. 2, represented by l·'ig·. 14. No observations of te1111rnrature of the air or dew-point are given, but the difference, by theory, must have been about so to give the olJserved height. In water-spouts at sea there is a rising up and foaming of the sea water under the s11out, on account of the greatly-diminished atmospheric pressure and rapid gyrations within the spout. By theory the water rises 13.6"'m for each millimeter of barometric depression, &o that if there should be a depression of lOOm"' the water would rise 1.36m. This heaping up of the water is always obsenml, and 011 accmrnt of the rapid gyratiug currents of the air the water is much agitated at the surface, and much of it may be carried up in the interior of the spout by the aRcending current. This sometimes gives the spout a whitish appearance below. The heaping up of the water and rising of the spray, cam:ed hy the great agitation, sometimes gives the appearance of a small right cone, as occurs in land-spouts from the collection of dust and other light materials. The '\"\ ater which falls as rain, in connection with a water-spout, is always observed to be fresh water, for the l'm1all amount of sea water can-ied up, when mixed with so much rain water, is not perceptible. That water-spouts do draw u11 water we know from observation, from which it appears that ponds are sometimes drained, and the fish, frogs, &c., transported to a considerable distance. From a comparison of v with P' in table, § 102, at the different distances from the center of a tornado or water-spout, it is sen that the barometric pressures are very little aftected except within tl1e limits of destructive violence, where obsen'ations are not conveniently made, and hence itR effect upon the barometer is rarely observed. 115. 'Vi th the co-ordinates rand h of No. 3 in table, § 102, we get the form of spout represented in Fig. 15, and with those of No. 4 in the same table we get the form of Fig. 16. The former is uot very tall because the dew-point of the air does not differ much from its temperature, and the base of the spout is not very large on account of the smallness of the assumed gyratory velocity v.. In the latter the spout is very high because of the great difference between the dew-point and temperature of the air at the earth's surface. It consequently requires a very great gyratory velocity to bring down a. spout with even so small base from so great a height. By assuming different temperature, <lew-points, and gyratory velocities, we can obtain spouts of a great variety of formsfrom the tornado cloud, with its base covering a considerable area, to a very tall, slender pillar of only one or two meters in diameter. With regard to the observed dimensions of water-spouts, Horner says that their diameters

range from 2 to 200 feet and their heights from :10 to 1,500 feet. Dr. Iteye states that their diameters on land at base are sometimes 1nore than 1 ,ooo feet. 'l'liesc correRpoml with our tornado cloud, Fig. 137 and consequently they han· little of the appearance of a spout unless they are tall. Oersted puts the usual height of water-spout;.; from 1,500 to 2 1000 foet, !Jut states that in solllP rare cases they cannot be much less tlrnn 5,000 or G,OOO foet. Of course all such ('Stimates art' n·ry vague, and may lJe Yery rnucb in error. V'ntll a l1igh temperaturn a1ul \Pry low 1l1·w-point, differing from the temperature of the air about H> 0 , a water-spout one mile in height wouhl he obtahwtl by the formula, hut spouti;; of this height proliably occnr very rarnly. 116. The Journal de Physique, vol. 88, contains account8 of a great many water-spouts, with remarks by M. Dcfranc, from which the following· items are extracted: "On the 23d of June, 1764, a water-spout was seen on t.lrn Seine, which had its b:tse ou tlie riYer and reached up into the clouds. It was .i udged to be ahou t three fret in diameter at the clon<l a11d still less wlwre it touelied the river. There were some 1mrts transparent, wliich allowe<l tl1e ascensio11 of the wate1· to be seen. It finally hrnke at ahont- one third of its hci~ht. The lower imrt foll i11 rain, the uvper part was drawn up into tlrn cloud in a secoml of time, and the phenomenon wa.s followed bJ· hail." This spout is remarkable for the smallut>ss of its diameter. Then· wa;;, 110 cloubt, water carriPcl up in it from tl1e river, hut wliat appears to be "·ater ascending· in ·water-spouts may he merely thP condensed vapor of foe atmosphere iu the form of cloud or mist. The lower part, without much doubt, bml water in it which fell back into the rinr when the spont broke. \Yater-spouts arc often obscrvcll to drop down from the cloud in an incredibly short i.nstan t of time and to lw drawn up again in the same manuer. 1-Vhen the gyrations are such as to not quite rrnluce the tension and temperature in the center, so ~t,., to condense the aqueous vapor, a very slight increase at once reduces the temperature sufficiently and the spout becomes ,·isible from top to bottom almost iustantaneously. Just the re\·erse of this takes place when the spout l)l'eaks, arnl it appears to lw drawn up instantly. This is especially the case in small spouts like thi8 mw. The hail indicates that the aswnding currents of this spout extended up into thJ region of freezing tenq1erature, lmt mo;.;t probably the hail was not formed from tliB water of tlie river. "On !\fay 17, 1763, Captain Cook saw six water-spouts upon Queen Charlotte Sound. In one of these a bird was seen and in arising was drawn in by force and turned around like a spit. Their first appearance was indicated by a vinlent a,gitation and elevation of the water. \V!te11 the tube was first formed or became visible its apparent diameter increased. It theu diminished aml llecanw invisible at its lower extremity." The observation of the bird's beiug drawn in is important in showing that there is a drauirht and an inflowing of air from all sides to supply the ascending current. 'l'he obsen·ation also shows that the air has a gyratory motion around the center. At first the g,yratfons are graduall,v increased, and after the spout first appears as long as the gyrations are increasing the spout, !Jy theory, must increase in diameter, but the reverse when the gyrations begin to diminish. The Yiolent agitati011 and heaping up of the water before the spout appears, sl10ws tltat the gyrations and lmromPtric depression in the wnter exist beforn the spout becomes visible, and that the spout onls av1)ear1-1 after the diminution of tension and temperature necessary to condense the »a1,or occurs. "On the 12th of July, 1782, there was a water-spout near the Island of Cuba. The base appeared to occupy the space of four toises, the base of the colunrn four feet, its middle tPn foct, and the up1)er part, in enlarging, formed the cloud. l\1any discharges of a eannon i11terrn11ted tlw course of the water from the sea, which was elevated in rapid spirals and separated from the base.'' This likewise seems to have been a. spout of small diameter, but of the usual tapering form toward the bottom and a rapid widening above to form the basl:' of the cloud. 'fllat tbe tlischar~t' of cannon may tend to break up water-spouts of small dimensions, is not to be regarded a.s improbable and entirely imaginary. In such a spout the ra11idity of the gyrations, by theory, extends to a very short distance from the center, and the whole comprises a mere column of tJrn air of .~mall diameter, and that the great agitaUon or oscillating motion of the air arising from the. clischaq::-e of cannon should sensibly affect the moments of gyration and gyratory Yclocitics, and thus break np the spout, is not a.t- all unreasonable t-0 sup})Ose. M. Dct'ranc remarks that "he never saw a water-spout before 10 o'clock in the morning nor

after 5 o'clock in the evening"; that "they never appear during the night 1101· during the winter," and that "there are always two circumi'itanPes atternling them. 1rhe nrst is the presence of the sun during, or a little before, the phenomenon. The secon<l is the absence of the wind, or only a very feeble one, except always in the space occupied hy the water-8pont." Tornadoes and water-spouts originate only in an unstable state of equilibrium of the air, which requires an unmmall,y rnpid decrease of temperature with increase of altitude. This can take place only when the strata nearest the earth are unusually be:Ltecl, and this 1wYer occurs in the night or during the winter, anrl but rarely in cloudy weather. Tornadoes :uid wafor-spout.s, therefore, take place mostly, if not al ways, in the summer season and during the day, when it has been clear at foast a sJiort time before their occurrence. If any agitation of the air, such as that arising from the discharge of a cannon, tends to break up these meteors, then any considerable disturbance of the air from auy cause mnRt tend to prevent their formation, and hence they do not occur when there is more than a feeble wind. This, however, cloes not apply to land-spouts which are formed in the interior of a tornado, having their origin in a state of unstable equilibrium in the cloud 1·egfon, and commence there, but ratl1er to water-spouts on seas aud lakes, originating in a state of un8tahle equilibrium of tlle lower unsaturated strata of the atmosphere. 117. According to theory, without friction there would he a slender thread of spout at the center in all cases after the gyrations had fairly set in and heen marle to conform to the law of (d), hut on account of the effect of friction near the center, where the gyratory Yeloeities become enormously great, these velocities are very much diminished there, and do not conform to the law of velocities invtwsely as the distance from the center. The spout, therefore, is not alwa:rs brought down to the earth, bnt the base of tile cloud is simply hronght down a little in the center in the shape of a funnel, as represented in Fig. 17. This funnel-shaped cloud is to be seen at t.he first formation of a spout, before fully formed, and also at the cud after the Rpout is broken up, and is ofwn Qhserved in land tornadoes in which the whirl first commences up in the cloud. In this latter case the spout may not he brought to the earth at all b:r the gyrations, or these gyration_s may so increase and extend themselves as t-0 draw the cloud down over a considerable area of the earth's surface, as represented in Fig. 13, ancl then the cloud does not have the appearance of a spout. "'ater-spouts at sea, first a1)peariug some distance off, ca,n generalJy be avoided or, if not, preparations can be made to guard against the danger; but where they are suddenly formed on the spot, and drop down, as it were. from above, they give little forewarning of approaching danger. Tbis is exemplified in a case of recent occurrence. The British bark Bel Stuart; Captain Harper, 011 tltc evening of No>emher 14, 1878, one hundred and sixty miles off Cape Sable, "was struck ~y a white squall m a comparatively smooth sea and clear sky, wl1ich swept her decks and created consternation on board. At 6 p. m. of the same day, all hands being on deck afwr supper, a strnnge fiigbing of tlrn wind was observed hy the watch, and the sky became. suddenly threatening, wit.bout a corresponding indication of the barometer, which showed a rising tendency. Captain Harper and his first officer were on the dtck at the time. AU hands noticed the peculiar change in Aea and sky and were discussing it, when, without a moment's notice, the sea forward seemed to swell up to meet the lowering sky and swept the bark across her bows, carrying away her foretop· mast, foretopgallant-mast, jib, jib-boom, foretopmast-stays, and the maint<Jpgallant-mast, with all thefr accompanying sails. In a moment, as it seemed, the bark, with all sail set and in a fair wind, with a moderate sea, was left a comparative wreck to wallow in the trough of the tremr,ndons seas which had followed tlte spiral volume of water. 'rwo minutes before the fatal catastrophe Ca11tain Harper says there was no indication of the water-spout." (N. Y. Herald, December 10, 1878.) It seems from this account that the bark ran into the spout as it was being formed and before it became visible. The sighing of the wind was caused by the ra11id gyrations of the air, and the threatening sky by the incipient condensation of the aqueous vapoP caITied up by the ascending current. The barometer remained unaffected because, as we have seen1 the barometric 11ressure is diminished only at and very near the center, and the observed rising of the sea was caused by this depression, as has been explained in the theory of water-spouts. The injurious effects prove the grea.t rapidity of the gyrations near the center given by theory. 118. When we have the conditions of a water-S})OUt in fair weather with little moisture in the air, we have what are called icltite squalls or fair-tceatkcr whirlwinds. In such cases the dew-point

is so low, and consequently the cloud, when formed, is so Ligh, that the gyrations may not be able to bring it down, in the form of a spout, to the sea. But still the gyratiuns and the rapidly ascending current in the central part are there, and the rising aml boiling uf the sea. High up in tlte air, also, directly over tlie toiling of the ;;;ea below, is a patch of white cloud, formed by the condensation of tile yapor in the ascending current when it arrh-es at tile height at which it begins to be condensed. This cloud may eYentuall.r exteud over a considerahle portion of' the heaYens, but at first it is a small cloud i11 a clear sky, as represented in Fig. 17, aml is whitt'. hecause of the great amount of reflected 1igl1t. It has, no doulit, the funnel shape beneath, but being higlt up, and tile obsen·cr being generally nearly under it, this feature is uot generally observed. If the air be not too dry it ma;y be followetl by a shower of rain. Peltier says: "\Yhite squalls arc rery rare, Lut the,\· are sometimes met with between the tropics, especially near elevated lauds; they are generally Yiolent and of short duration. They often take place when tl1e sky is clear and without any atmospheric circumstances giving notice of their approa,cb. The only thing which indicates their proximity is tile lioiliug of the sea, which is ver;y much agitated hy the viol~nce of the wiuds. Many of tl1ese squalls, which commence either by a little cloud, or even without any visible cloud, are soon accompanied b,\- ·iolent rains a1ld · thick clouds." The bull's.eye squalls on the west coast of Africa are of prccisel,y the same nature. According to Piddington, the Portuguese describe these squalls as "first a1·peariug like a bright white spot at or near the zenith, in a perfectly clear sky and fine weather, and which, rapidly dcscendi11g, brings with it a furious white squall or tornado.'' By comparing these descriptions with the account of the water-spout, in the pmceding section, it is readily seen that all these 1'r1ualls are precisely the same as water-spouts, except that tlie air is too dr,y, and the gyrations not quite sufficient to bring the cloud down in the form of it spout. They may occur almost an:nvhere, but are much more frequently met with in some parts of the earth than in others. The;r are very common on and near thf\ west coast of Northern Africa. This is because tLe atmosphere there is frequently iu a state oi unstable equilibrium. The tendency of the lower strata of the atmospl1ere tllere, as in the trade-wind region generally, is toward the west, except the surface sea-breeze currents in summer. This is· proYed by the immense amount of dust which is carried out from the continent over the oceim, so that ships and the whole surface of tile sea at times become covered with it. This air, coming from tile warm and dry deserts of Africa, is very warm. ·Iu the upper strata tile cold ocean air from the west overlaps this warm air below, and thus is produced a yery rapid diminution of temperature with increase of altHude, and consequently a state of unstable equilibrium, wl1ich is one of the conditions of a tornado or water· spout. The other condition of initial gyratory motion, as explained in § 91, can rarely be entirely wauting. Hence these squalls abound here, but not geuemll.v In connection with water-spouts, because the dry air from the continent contains too little moisture. 119. In very hot, dry climates, wilere there is a sandy soil, we have sand-.~ponf,s, or pillars of sand. The dry air in such climates is frequentIJ- in tlte state of unstable equilibrium, aud tliere are all the conditions of a water-spout except the vapor to condense. The gyrations of the air and the ascending currents are the same as in the water-spout, but instead of carrying up Yapor, they collect the sand or dust from the vicinity aud ci1rry it up. Tbe inftowing current from all sides toward the vortex, up to a considerable height often, keeps it near the center. According to (q), however, there is a distance from the center wilere the force arising from the inflowing curreut acting u1>on the particles of sand, and the centrifugal force of the gyrations, are in equilibrium, and this distance depends upon the diameter D of the sand particle, unless we sup1)ose that the velocity u of the inflowing current toward the center is in\·ersely as ri, which is impossible, for this would make u infinite at the center, whereas we know that it mu8t vanish there. vVe know that u' must be such a fuuction of r that it will increase from the center, and also that it cannot iuereaS(~ as rapidly as the first power of r, for that would require the ascending current to be the same at all distanC<lS from the center, but we know it. must he greatest at the center. Let us therefore put u' = cri between these extremes. With this expression (q) becomes

This shows that for different Yalues of n there is a corresponding value of r, and hence the sandparticles are arritugcd at differeut distances from the center, according to tl1eir size, the largest ones being farthest off. On account of the u11knmn1 Yalne of c in any case we cannot determine this value of r, but we k11mv mwh size of partwles must haye its status Pt some certain distance frm11 the center. The same result would be obtained witli either extreme of 11' = c, or 'U' =er, cxcPpt that the status of the particles would not be precisely at the same distance. If there was no limit to the size of the sand particles there would be no limit to the distance from the center at which the_\' would gyrate, provide1l the a8cendiug current were sufficient to carr:· tl1em up, lt11t "ith a limit to their size tht·re wonl1l he a limit to this distance, and this wouhi determine the ra<lin,,; of the sand-s11out or llillar of sand. But where there is no limit to the size of the particles, and they are of all 8izes from tl1e smallest up, even iu t11is case there is a co111lition which determines the size of th!' spont, antl that i8 that the ascending current must be 8trong· enough to keep them suspernleil in the air. As the largest particles must gyrate at the greate8t distancei,; fm111 the center, there iis a certain distance at which the ascending current is not sufficient to :-mstain these larger particles, and this determines the-limit of the spout, for beyond this distance the larger. ·particles c:umot bB ~mstained and the smaller ones are tlriven nearer the center, where the ascending current keeps them from falling. The height of the spout in this ea~1· <1PpPnth1 upon the hpight at which the ascending currents incline outward from the center, for of rnnrse it is there carried away and dispersed. This height depends u11011 various circumstauees. J\fany of these pillarn of sand are observed t-0 be very tall.

In the ca8e of the water·S})Ont the teusion and temperature diminish Yt>ry ra11itll.Y toward the center, so that before the vapor arriYes near the center it is nearly all coudensecl, and the centrifugal force tends all the time to drive the water or cloud particles away from the center, e\·en beyond the distance where condensation first takes place, as represented in the figure8 of tl1e water-spouts. But as tlte ascending cur, rent is yery rapirl, and the spout is larger ahon-, the particles are perhaps alwa;ys kept within that limit, and the spout is 11ot enlarged by the driving of the particles away from the center, lteyoncl the li111it where condensation fin1t takes place.. ln the case of both water-spouts and sand· spouts, therefore, if there is not an absolute vacuum of particles in the central part, the particles are tso exceeclingly rare. t,here that it must be regarded as being sensibly a vacuum. 'l'he circumstances under which observations of such a vacuum can be made are very rare. l\l. Bow·, in the year 1850, ob8CITed three water·spouts at the same time on Lake Janina, from the top of ~1 high mountain. The weather was entirely clear, without clouth! or wind, but. very oppressiv~ aml hot. The spouts seemed to riRe up from the lake, and he could look down into the top of them aml see that they were hollow in the middle. (Bulletin Soc. Geologique de France, t. viii, p. 274.) Of a ~whirlwind observed at Schell City, Mo., in the summer of 1879, Professor Nipher says: " There were 110 surface winds strong enough to bear dnst along the surface of the ground, but the dust carried up in the vOTtex was collected only at the vortex of the whirl. The dust column was ahont two lmndred foet high, and ])erha11s ahout thirty or forty feet in diameter at the top. The 1lirection of rotation waR the same as of storms in the northern hemisphflre. Leaving the road the whirl par>Red ont on the prairie, immediately filling the air with hay, wl1ich was carried up in some· what wider spira.ls, the diameter of the cone thus filled with bay being about 150 feet at t-0p. It was then obser\'ed also tllat the liust column was hollow. Standing nearly under it, the bottom of the dust column appeitred like an annulus of tlust surrounding a circular area of perfectly clear air. The area grew larger as tlle dust was raised ltigber, being about fifteen or twenty feet wide when it, was last obser\·ed." (Nature, Sept. 11, 11-179.) The water-s1)out connected with the great tornado of April 18~ 1880, at Marshfield, Mo., seems also to have been hollow. In this case the cloud was high, and, as frequently happens in land

This arii,;es from tl1e air running into numerom; whirl;.;, or g,rratim1s, while it at the sauH' time has a progressh'e motion. These are especially liable to oecur in connection witli geunal cyclones extending over a comiideraule area, for tllen, especiall:> in the cloud region, the air is often in a state of unstable equilibrium, aud on account of the gyrat.imrn of the c_ycloue tl1e moments of gyration, with regard to any 11oiut in tlte cyclone where there may be a rushing up of the air of the lower strata through the upper ones, cannot generally be naught, and hence we Lan~ both conditions which are required for t.he formation of these wltirls in tlie atmosphere. TheRe may form small secondary cyclones, or tornac~oes and water-spouts, or simpl~· a slight wllirling in the atmosphere of not much Yiolence. Tbe progressive motion of the air in which these g,nat io1ti,; occur may be, and is mostly, that of the larger e:>clonl.' in which the small g·,..-rations occul'. \\'Jrnn the directions of the g;n·atory and progresRi,·e motions coincide, tile resultant velocit~ lmcomes unusually strong, and we ha,·e a strong blast.

If th1' gyratory velocity is greater than the progressi\-e, it may he whirled e1ttirely around. These blasts and oscillations of the vane are especially ohserva hie on the clearing'- up side of a storm. Thi;; is the clear cold side, and as the upper part of this is carried forward eastward faster than the lower, it overlaps the more central warmer part of the air below before it has time to cool down by ratliation, and thus there is produced a more ra.phl tliminutiou of temperature with increase of altitude, and a state of umstable equilibrium in whiclt these gyrations of tlie air rea.<lilj· originate. It is Rimilar to what takes place 011 the west coast of Africa, as explainetl in § 118, g'iYing ri:-ie to tlte bull's-eye squalls. As a patch of white cloud is seen vertically over foe place of each one of these squalls, so on the clearing-up side of a storm a cumulus cloud, wltite if the sky generally is clear. indicates the existence of one of these gyrations of the air which gi ''e rise to blasts and oscillations of the wind vane. The cloud~ generall.v l1igh np bet·ausc there is not much vapor remaining in the air, is produced by the condensation of tlte Yapor in the ascending current in the central part of these whirls, which mostl.r are not of much violence, hut ~mfficient to produce eonsiderahle rnriatious in the velocity and direction of tlle wind. 122. The oscillations of the barometer, sometimes ealled ''1mruping,'~ and v.-ltieh are known to be associated with gusts of wind, are not only accounted for by (j) or (k), hut the exact amount of baromet.ric oscillation, corresponding to a given change in tbe wind's velocity, can be computed. It will be remembered that this formula gives the effect of the small term in (/) depending upon the inertia of the air, which was neglected in the general theory of cyclones an<l tornadoes, but has to be considered where there are any sudden changes of velocity. B.r the formula (j) or (k) a change of velocity from 10 meters Iler second to a calm aft'ect.s the barometer placed on the sid.e of a wall or any barrier against which tl1e wind blows, aml where consequently it is in a calm, and the value u = o, arnl produces a corresponding change in the pressure of 0.0o'i""".

These are ahout thr greatest changes which occur in the velocities of the wind in gusts or blasts, and hence the oiscillatiom; rarely exceed 0.5"'"'. Much, however, depends upon the position of the barometer. This must be placed where the air is entirely obstructed, and the velocity reduced to naught. If placed in the rmTent there is no change produced by a change of the velocity. On tile winclward side of a barriel' there is a sligl1 t rise of tile barometer with au increase of the wind's velocity, hut on the Jee side there is a sligl1t decrease due to the "drag'' of the air.

The amplitudes of the oRcillations here seem to he, in general, a little greater than those giveu above, arising perliaps from the greater riolence of the winds generally in these hurricanes. "Under foe infincnec of the blasts the barometric column is so agitated and so irregular that it renders the rt·a11ing of it vf'ry difficult, since it. is scarcel.Y possible to take au exact medium.

The next most important da,;;s is that which depends in the same way upon "What may be called the mean sun, giYing rise in del'P water;; to a semidiurual tide only, but in shallo\r waters to quarter<Jiurnal, &c., tides . .As each of the other classes of terms iu ll depemLs nvu11 term:; in the expression of Y in (1) similar to that of the mean moon, each one may be 8aid to depend upon a fictitious moon, differing merel,y from tlle mean moon in magnitude and the apparent Yclocity with which it moYes around the earth.

Since An: B" in (5) are functions in which none of the quantities vary in the different components except in, and this varies very little in each of the classes, instead of putting R = AnBn or equal ~A.

F'rom the three most important diumal components in the expressions of (.'.J), we get, from what precedes, two classes of shallow-water components, of the form of (7), the first arising from all the resultant terms in the pr0tincts of the components in which the anglel:l are the sums of the angles iu the components, and hem.'.e semidiurnal components, arn.l the other arising from those in which the angles are the. difforences of the angles in the components multiplied, arnl hence components of long period. ·we thus get the components in the following schedule, and the ralues of t11e constants R, 11, c', alJ(l q in the t>xpression of (7):

The designation K 1 K 1 of the first component inuicateis that it arises from the· diurnal compo" nent of the K or 1\'13 tides; that of the second, K1 01, that it arises from the diurnal components of the Kand 0 tides, and so on. The valueis of i, and c in t,he expressions of u and c' are contained in Schedule I. The values of A and£ in the expl'essions of Rand q are obtained from the analysis of the tide-observations for the component depending directly upon the forces contained in the fust schedule. This leave:-; only the coustanti:; C andE in (7) for each class of shallow-water components unknown, so that if tbe:,;e are det.ermined from the anal.rsis of the tide-observations for an.r one of these components, they are then known for all, and consequently all the components of the class are known quantities, without any further analysis of tide-obsernitions. From the values of u in the semidiurnal components it is seen that the i·eriods of three of them coincid(\ with the periods of three semidiurnal com11onents depeuding directly upou the tidal forces, aud hence the shallow-water components cannot be separated from the others directl,y by the analysis of the tide-observations. If, howeYer, we can determine C and E by the analy1>is for any component whose period does not coincide w1th that of any of the other components, we then know the values of the shallow- wa.ter compoueuts combinetl with those depending directly upon the tidal forces. 8. In the same manner as in the preceding section, we get from the principal semiltiurnal factors combined with those of the diurnal, two more classes of shallow-water components; the one being diurnal, having angles which are the differences of those in the original components, and the other, angles which are the sums of those angles.

In tllis schedule tile designation 1\12 K 1 of the firi,;t component denotes that it depends upon the semidiurnal lunar or M tide and upon tl1e ditirnal declinational or K tide; the designation 8 2 P 1 deIJotes that it de1>ends upon the semidiurnal solar or S tide and upon the diurnal P tiue, and so on. In the two factors in the expressions of R, the first is the amplitude of the semidiurnal, and the second the amplitude of the diurnal component of the tide denoted b.Y the characteristics or subscript numbers. In the expressions of q, also, the first epoch is that of the semidiurnal component or factor, and the second that of the diurual one. From an inspection of the several values of n in the diurnal components of this schedule, it is seen that there are three 4t which the value of u, and consequently of the period, is the same as that of the diurnal deelinational componen_t in Schedule I, and hence these three shallow-water componeIJts, forming in reality only one resulting component, are combined with th~ latter, from which it cannot be separated by the analysis of the obsen·atious. There is also one, the J\12 K 1 tide, affecting t11e diurnal M6 or K tide of Schedule I, and another, the S2 K 1 tide, affecting the diurnal P tide. Among the terdiurual components there are two whose J>eriods are so nearly identical with that of the lunar terdiurnal component that in the analysis of only one year's tide-observations they caunot be separat.ed, and appear t.o give only one l'esulting component. These two components are t.hose designat.ed h.r L 2 0 1 and N2 K1. 9. The large:;;t shallow-water components arise, in general, from the semidiurnal components of Schedule I, espeeially in the Atlantic Ocean, where the diurnal <~omponents are small. By the multiplication of the semidiurnal terms in (5) into each other, two and two, there arise two classes of terms giving rise to corres1>onding shallow-water components, the one in which the angles are the snms of the original angles, being quarter-diurnal components, and the other, in which the angles are the clifforences, being components of Jong Ileriod. We thus get the following schedule ~of shallow-water components, with the corres1)onding values of the constants R, 1t, d, and q in (7): _

The amplitudes and epochs, A and"' in the values of Rand q, are those of the semidillrnal components in Schedule I. From tbe components given in each division of this schedule the law is seen by which all the others, with the corresponding constants, may be obtained. 10. All the preceding shallow-water components arise from using in (5) the components ot Schedule I, as has been explained, and hence they may be called shallow-water components of the first order. In the same manner and upon the same princinles we can now, in a third approximation, introduce the shallow-water components of the first order in-to (5), and thus obtain a numerous class of shallow-water components of a second order. For instance, if we use, in (5), the quarterdiurnaJ components of the preceding schedule, together with the components of Schedule I, we get, from the semidiurnal and the quarter-diurnal factors, terms which gi\·e rise to two classes of shallow-water components of a second order, the one being semidiurnal and the other one-sixthdiurnal component. These, together with the values of the constantR R, 11, c', and q of (7), arc co11tained in tb~followiug schedule:

analysis of the observations, and the different parts are inseparable by the analysis. For instance, the components M 2 (l\12 M 2 ) and~ (l\'1 2 8 2) both have the same value of u, and hence the same period as that of the lunar semirliurnal component of Scl1ednle f. In like manner there are two components affecting the solar semidiurnal component. The amplitudes and epochs A and e in this schedule al'e those of the semidiurnal components. 11. By using the components of the preceding schedule in connection with the semidiurnal components we get in precisely the same manner and upon the same principles a still lower order uf shallow-water components. The most important of the sernidiurnal components in this schedule have been so used; and since their periods are the same they am combined with the semidiurnal components of Schedule I. From the one-sixth-diurnal components, so used, we get, giving those only depending upon the mean lunar and solar tides, the following:

12. Only a few, perhaps, of the shallow-water components in the preceding schedules are sensible to observation at most tide stations; but at Liverpool and a few other places the amplitudes of some of them have been found, from actual analysis of the tide-observations, to be quite large, that of the quarter-diurnal component at Lfrerpool being nearly 9 inches. Even the one-e.ightl1-diurnal lunar component of the third order is quite clearly brought out from the analysis of the observations of many stations. At river stations far from the sea many of these components must be quite large, since it is owing to them tltat the semidiurnal tide is so distorted frequently and made to vary so much from that of <leep waters, the form of which does not deviate from what is called "tlie law of sines aml cosines.'' A few of the preceding relations lier.ween the amplitudes and epocl1s of tlrn shallow-water components were first published in my Tidal Researches, and comparisons made with those obtained by the Tidal Committee of the British Association from the analysis of the tide-observations of Liverpool and other places; and although these theoretical relations claim to be only approximately correct, ;vet it was surprising to see bow nearly they coincided with those obtained from observation. In studying the theoretical relations of the tides, and making comparisons between them and the tidal forces producing them, it is not only necessary to have a complete schedule of all the sballow-watr components which may, in any case, affect the components depending directly upon the forces, but also to have from theory as many relations between the amplitudes and epochs of the various components a.'! possible; hence the importance of the preceding schedules. 13. It is now necessary to devise a method of obtaining the amplitudes and epochs of the components in (2) from averages of observations taken at regular intervals for a certain period of time. From (2) we getin which
(8) H =.!',.A. COS(~.

This expression of H may include all the shallow-water components of the form of (7), since the latter can be reduced to the form of the expression of H above. If we now take the average of all the observations made at equal and short intervals of time throughout the time t = ·, which fall within certain limits rp' ,., and q;" ~,of any argument 'I''"' of which

If we use sin for cos in these expressions and d1ange the sign, it is i:;een from (19) that we get those of n,. For terdiurnal, quarter-diurnal, &c., components the corrections depending upon m and n are unimportant, since only the amplitudes of these components, which are very small, ent-0r into the ex11ressions. It is seen from the smallness mostly of the numerical coefficients, taken in connection with the valueR of A, that most of the terms in the preceding expressions of m and n are very small. The large values of mu and m12 in the diurnal components, arising from the very small value of (i, - i.-) in that case, occur where there is no sensible diurnal component, and hence are of no importance, since after appl~·ing the correctious the result is approximately 0. By using the values of T"., which have been girnn for each class of ~l, tides, terms containing A 1 of the semidiurnal tide disappear, and as this is mnch the largest of the amplitudes, the values of 111 and n are thereby much diminished. Indeed, when these values of T, are used, all the corrections depending upon m and n may be neglected 1 except in very nice theoretical investigations, such as determining the moon's mass; and this is especially the case when the results of the obserYations of a series of years are used, in which case the effects of these small con·ections are mostly eliminated from the arnrages. 16. It yet remains to determine, from averages of the observations, the quantities M, and N. in (16). This must be done by means of (12), in which a is the average of all the hourly observations of H during the time :-, contained within the limits rp',. and p",,. If we make these limits include 150 of the argument \I',,, as is usual, we shall then have twenty-four of these averages. If we take the limits so that the middle of the included interrnls correspond to <p, = O, \I',,= 150, 'I·'= 300, &c., and denote the corrn8pomling values of the averages by a 0 , a1, a 2, &c., we get from (12)1 by supplying the implied constant of integration A,., twenty-four equations, as follows:

a,, = Ao + 1\11 +0 + M2 +0 + l\f3 +0 + &c. n1 =Ao+ l\1 1 cos 15° + N 1 sin 15° + :M2 cos 30° + N1 sin 300 + M3 cos 45° + N 3 sin 450 + &c. a 2 =Ao+ l\11 cos 300 + N 1 sin 300 + l\I2 cos 600 + N 2 sin 600 + l\I;i cos 900 + N 0 sin !JOO+ &c. a3 = Ao + 1\11 cos 450 + N 1 sin 450 + :M2 cos 90° + N 2 sin 90° + 1\13 cos 135° + N 3 sin 1350 + &c. and so forth. The solution of these twenty-four equations hy the, method of least squares gives us a <'Airtain number of normal equations, the number depending upon the number of terms taken into account in the expression of a. These normal equations are entirely independent of one another, and give directly, without any further solution, the values of the constants, A 0, M1, N 1 , M2 , N 2, &c. The following, gfren in the most convenient form for computation, are all that we shall have occasion to use in the tidal analysis:

in which tis the time of tlie observation exprm;sed i11 Jwuns fmrn the epoch, or time t = 0. It is therefore necessary to ha\·e a table gfring the values of each of the arguments rp, for each hour of fiery day in the year. Table I, computed from (34), with the valnes of i, given in Schedule I, is such a table of the principal arguments expressed in hours of 150 eacl1, and the multiples of 24 hours being neglected. It is given for the first and last days of the year only, merely as a sample, the complete table in manuscri1Jt having been used. The solar hour is found in the first column under 'h' and the corresponding values of the other arguments rp,, given to the nearest integer only, are found under their appropriate heads. Since all the observations within the limits of a half hour preceding and following each hour come in tlle same gronp,it is only necessary to ha-ve in the tables the hour belonging to the middle of the group, or, in other words, the values of cp, in hours t-0 the nearest integer. The averages then correspond to the even hours of '/,· 18. The epochs obtained directl,y from the analysis by the preceding method are those of·' in (8), in which the time, t = 0, is the same for all the components. In the expression of H (3), tlte angle i,t + "· is the hour-angle of the M, tide, and the epoch e, is that which belongs to the case in which tis reckone(l from the passage of the fictitious moon M, over the meridian. The former, ·', varies very much generally from year to year; the latter,·, is theoretically the same for each year. After the reduction of ·' to e we can compare the several values of e belonging to each of a series of years an<l estimate the probable error. This reduction is made by the la.st of equations (9), b;y adding sc. to the epoch ·'.. It is necessary, therefore, to have the value of c.for the assmned time of t = O at the beginning of each year. The values of c. for each class of M. tides is obtained from the expressions of c, in Schedule I, in which the values of .<, .<', ii, &c., at the beginning of each year must be used. With the data contained in the introduction to Peirce's Tables of the Moon,

these values of c, have been thus computed for a series of years extending back and forward from the present time, and given in Table II. This table can be reatli1y extended furlber each way by means of the difforences. In this table t in (3) is supposed to he reckoned from midnigl1t, and hence 180° have been added to the values given by the expressions in the schedule. Hy mean& of this table the reductions above are readily made for any year containc!l in the table. In this taul<· are also contained the values of iu 1 and ii/, which are often needed. Ill the reductions of the epochs of any of the shallow-water components which <lo uot fall within any of the fourteen clas8es of eomponents giYen iu 8chedule I, the \'alues of c', ginm by its expre8sion in the several schedules of the shallow-water components, must be used. After snch reduction;, the epochs of these components for difterent years should also be the same. rn. The amplitudes and epocl1s obtaine<l directly from the analysis require still another reduction in a few cases, to make the re~mlt.s of different ,vears comparable one with another. These are the cases in wl1ich the components are affected b,r other aml 8maller components of so nearly thr same period that they cannot be separated hy the anal.vi'lis.

Since the first year's observations are uot quite complete, the series having been commenced on the 21st of ,Ja1mary, and therefore requires to be treated a little differently in some of the details, we shall st>lect as our example the lunar or M 1 tide of 1871.

component. These residuals, moreover, furnish almost a perfect check against any errors in the work, either of taking the averages of the groups of observations or of computing the amplitudes and epochs from these averages. Each of the 24 values of a above is the average of about 365 obsern1tions, and an.Y error in taking these aYerages shows itself in the residuals, so that if any of these residuals are unusually large, it is necessary to reyisc the work until the residuals fall within the mmal limits. Any error, likewise, of any consequence in the work of obtaining the amplituues and epochs from these a''eragw; is shown by the residuals, since any such error not only causes the resitlnals to he unmmally large, but also causes a prepo111lera11ce of plus or minus signs in different parts of tlie column of re1'iduals. It is Letter, tllcrefore, to obtain the uncorrectetl amplitndeR and epochR of the tidal cornpo11ents, which are the trne oneR belonging to the expresRion of a, so that the accuracy of the work may be tested hy means of the resiclnalR, and then to correct these am. plitudes and epocl1s, than it is to corr··d tlw co.or·linateR M nncl Nin order to oht.uin Llire<'tly the eorrectcd ones. Iu the manner which has jnst been explainP1l sixteen tides for each of the Rix years, making ninety.six in all, han' been treated, ancl the work checked l1y means of the residnalR. In most of them, LoweYer, it was founll necetisary to use ouly two terms in the }He<:eding expression of a., whfoh always left tlic residnahi so small as to imlil~ate that if they contaiuetl :yet any other real terms, thf'y were too small to he of any importance. It is seen from tl1c formula· for ohtaiuing the constant.-; in any tidal P-Omponent that tlie,:r are en t irel;y imlepeuclent of those of any of the others, so that we can obtain those of any one of tl1e111 and neglect tlw l1ala11ce if we wish, hnt the resiflnals then tlo not furuiRh a che<~k for the accuracy of the work. :!2. If the a>crages weri· those of the true tide merely, nuaffectetl by tl1e abnormal ilisturbances of winds, ocean currents, and clm11ges of haromPtric· pressure, arnl all the real terms in the pre. 1·t~diug exprf'ssion of a were taken into account, we should have no resi1lnals. These residuals, then, are the parts of theRe distnrhauces which are not eliminated from the aYeragcs hy the number of observations mmd, together with the efiect,s of very small terms neglected in the expression of a. It is important, therefore, to estimate the probable errors in the results arising from these causes. From tlic residuals in the preceding table we get ~1.' 2 = .002!"186. \Vith this Yalue, }lutting 111 = U, since there are 13 unknown quantities, we get fmm (:lO) e = .<H03 of a foot, or about k of au in.,h, for tbe probable ermr of the arnrages of one year's obserYations, upon the hypothesis that the resiuuals conta.iu no real neglected terrnH in the expression of a. \Vith thi1' value of e we likewi."c get from (32) r = .0030 of a foot, or about 2\ of au inch, for the probable error of the amplitudes A, arising from nneliminated abnormal disturbances. From (33) we get r' = 0°.03 for the probable error of the epochs '· Jf the re.sitluals are still affected by any real neglectell terms iu the. expression of a, then the probable en·orio; are still less than thef'e estimates. The example in hand is alumt an average one, the residuals in Rome caseR giving larger ancl in otberH Rnmllpr probahle errors, witlwut mucl1 range of Yariation. lu tl1<> t·.ourse of so much work there are of course somfl small <irrors which escape tleteetion hy mPans of an ins1iection of the residual:'!. The effects of such errors a.re also included in these probable errors. As the residua.ls must he <lue mostly to uneliminatec:l abnormal disturbances, and ouly in a mmparatively few cases the result of error, the part of the probable error due to the latter cause must be yery small, so that we have a complet.e check against errors of any importanc<'. !!::. Ha Ying obtaine·l the amplitudes aml epochs in the expression of a preceding, the next step i:-; to correct them, Ro as to r11 dnc·· tl1em to tbe true amplitmles arnl epocl1s of (8). This is done by meanR of ( t 7) and (20) aft.l'r tl1e values of ni and n ha Ye been com1mted hy means of the formulre of § 15. These formnlm give in this case, for the diurnal component, m 1 = - .0028; n 1 = .0022; and fOI' the semicliurnal, tll1 = - .0185 and 11 1 = - .0030. ·with these values of m and n ancl the values of'

In this, as in the preceding case, tl1e corrected results are very satisfactory, the residuals and the probable errors being quite small, and the signs of the residuals indicate that the corre.ctio11s for the eflects of the term depending upon the moon's node are correct.Ir madP. Tlie probable error of the amplitude here, in the iwerage of the six rearR; is a little less, and tha.t of the 1~pochs a little greater, than in the preceding case. 26. The two semidiurnal components which need fo be corrected for the effect of the two terms of nearly the same periods depending upon the moon's node, are those of l\11 and 1\1 3, tl1e mean lunar and declinational components.

Herc the probable error of the average amplitude is much greater than that of the preceding cases, and the pmbable e1Tor of the epoch, l'edue{l(l to lineal me:1sure, is about the same as that of ~be amplitude. ln the ease of tbe amplitudes it is seen, also, that the miuus signs l'a.ther prevail 1n the first half of the sei·i~ and the plus signs in tl1e latter half. Tlle average of the first three is .0157 feet, or nearly -Jr of a.n inch, while t.hat of the la.st three i>1 tbe sam{I ·with the contrary sign. This result bas a.n important bearing upon t.he principle by which the corrections for tlH' luna1· nodal term have been made,, wliicl1 is, that large1· aud sma.Uer tides a.re tlroportional t;o tlie forces upon ·which they depend. 'l'his. principle is theoretioa.lly correet for doop-water tides without friction, but I have not found it to be strictly-0orrect in a.n:r case which I have examined. Jn the tides of Brest, Liverpool, KUITaehee, San Francisco, a.nd other8, and notably so in the Boston tides, I have found that the larger semidiurnal tides are smaller in proportion to the forces than the smaller S.

The same is sltown h~· the residuals above to be true in the tides of Pulpit Cove; for these residuals show that the larger amplitudes of the first part of the series, corrected upon the }Wincip1e of prop0l'tiona1it,v to tl1e force~", are more than t of an inch smaller than tlie corrected smaller amplitrnles of the last half of the series. Having a series of only six ~·ears OD hand, which is less than one-third of the period of the moon's node, this matter cannot be so clearly brought out here, but if we had a se1'ies of 19 years, it would be interesting to trace the residuals, given by the corrected amplitudes as above, around the wlwle period; n.nd they would undoubtedly have contrai·,> sig11s in the two opposite parts of tlte period c-0rrespouding to the largest and the smallest amplitudes, as I Jiave found in th.- case of the J,iye111ool ti<les.

'l'l.J.e probable enorK here are smaller thau in tlw preceding mtse. The probable error of the rpoch, reduced to lineal meaAure, is± .0069, a little greater than that of the amplitudes. 'l'he signs" of the residuals in both the amplitudes and epoclis are entirely satisf'actory, and the correction for the effect of the small t{\rm of nea.rly the same period, depending upon the moon's node, seems w be accurate}~· made in this case. 27. The amplitudes and epochs of five components of long period have beeu obtained from the analysis of the observations by the method explained in§ 20. All the daily averages of observations throughout the .fear contained within each equal tlivision of 15° of each argument were put into one group and the averages taken, from which were obtained, as in the case of the short period compouent.".· twenty-four averages for each argument, and from these the amplitudes and epochs were obtained as in the short-period tidt>s. For the purpose of arranging the daily averages in their proper groups a table of the yahtPs or each argument for the middle of each da..v throughout the year was made, so that it would be readily seen from the table in which group each daily a>erage was to be put, The corrections for 1n and n (19) become of no importance in long-period tides, on account of the large value of the denominators (i! - i,,) -r. Putting for si, its value in the case of the lunar. semidiurnal tide, which is 280.98410, and for si,. the value of u,., as directed in§ 20, and taking the daily value of u2 in § 4 as an example, we should have for the hourly value of 1'2 0°.5-l44, and hence (si. - 1'2 ) = 28°.4397. With this value, putting .. = 8760, the numberofhourR in a year, the denominator becomes 4265, and the coefficient of A. for the maximum. value of the numerator, would be only !n:\2 · This in the case of the tides in band, in which A for the lunar tide is less than 5 feet, would give a value form of only about .0023 of a foot, or :f6 of an inch. For all the other short period components the value would be much less. · The errors arising from the unequal distribution of the observations through the arguments may amount to much more than these, bnt they cannot amount to anything of much import,ance, as will be shown by the following results. As the arguments all commence with t = o, for the beginning of the year, the epochs immediately obtained had to be correc.~ted by adding the values of k, given in § 4, in order to make the epochs of the several years comparable with one another. .A correction alw for the amount of

The varying values of .A, and the scattering values of £' falling somewhat in all parts of the circumference of the circle, indicate that there is no sensible lunar elliptic or <leclinational component, which, it will be shown, is what theory requires. The epochs e 1, of the solar elliptic, and those of e 2· of the solar declinational component, falling somewhat in the same part of the circumference of the circle, indicate real components; but since the period of the argument is one year in this case, the;y am undoubtedly due to meteorological causes, such as changes of winds and of barometric pressure, and likewise of ocean cnrrents, all of which may have a Yariation with an annual period. The amplitudes and epochs of these components for 18i!3 c.ould uut be olltained on account of a change in the zero of the tide-gauge during this year. The shallow.water component is the l\I2 8 2 long-period component of Schedule JT. The small range in the values of the epochs for tl1e several years, as well as the largeness of the amplitudes, shows that this is a. real tide-component with an amplitude of more than two inches. The small probable errors of both the amplitude and ,epoch, the former bei1ig only one-eighth of an inch, show that the principle which has been adopted of using· the daily aYcrages ca-nnot lead to much error, for the greater part of these probable errors is no doubt due to the accidental uneliminated disturbances of winds1 barometric pressure, &c., since they are nearly of the same order as thosf, in the short-period tidmi. The height of the mean level of the sea above the zero plaue of tlm tide-gauge was found to be in feet as follows :

It is seen t.hat there was a great change for some reason in the zero plane of the tide-gaug·e in The series of observations is too short to decide the interesting question in geology, whether the continent is rising or falling, unless the rate of change were considerable, and we coult.1 he certain that the zero of the tide-gauge was kept. on the same level plane throughout.

28. It is pmposed under this head to ascertain how nearly the lWCceding results from obser\"a· tion satisfy the various theoretical relations between the amplitudes, e1)()Chs, and tidal forces, first published in my Tidal Researches. This is important, since if these relations or Jaws can be shown from comparisons with observation to hold generally for all tide-stations, tlteu tllese relations need no longer be sought by a laborious analysis of tide observations. I.et us consider, first, the mean lunar tide, ai:; obtained from analysis, and given in§ ~4. At least five of the six components given there are real tides. The first, of which the amplitude is denoted by A 1 , is a very small diurual tide depending upon correspou11iug forces. It is the resultant of two components arising from the two terms in Schedule I, tlenot.ed by m 1 and 111, in which the pefiods, ~ denoted by ttie values of i., are very near.ly the same 1111 that of the m~n moon, Pllt·

Theory gives no relations between the forces, aud the amplitudes arnl epochs of the tides from which we can cletermiue the latter, but it only establishes certain relations between the amplitmles aml epochs of the ditterent components of approximately the same periods. 'Ve have to depeml, therefore, upon observation for the amplitude and epoch of one or more of the larger components of each class, and then from these theory determines the rest. ,.Ye have to depend upon observation for the amplitudes and epocbs of the mean lunar s_emidiurnal tide, and can make no direct comparison of them with theory. The quarter-diurnal lunar tide, of which the amplitude is tle11otetl by A 4 , is the shallow-water. component of Schedule IY, designated by lVI2 Mz. The small range of the values of the epoch s4 for the sHeral ;rears show that tbis is a real component, though quite small, the aYerage of the obserYed amplitu<les being only about ! of an inch. This component in the Liverpool tides has an amplitude of uearl:r nine inches, which indicates that the shallow-water components there, in general, must be veQ· much larger than at Pulpit Coni. The oul,v theoretical relation which we bani in this tide fol' comparison witli obsern1tion i.-- that its amplitudes for different years should be in proportion tu tl1e squares of the amplitudes of the mean lunar semidiurnal component, as is seen from the Yalue of R in Schedule IV. This relation holds in this case, the amplitudes of both components decreasing with the series, but the probable erro1·s in the very small amplitudes of A 4 are proportionately so large that this agreement with theory must be regarded as being roost likel~· aecidental. In the Liverpool tides, where the amplitude of this eomponeut is very much larger, thi,,; theoretical law ii-; satislietl by observatiou vei·y accurately.

Thi&, although a component of the second order, is much larger than the quarter-diurnal component. It is surprising to see how all the abnormal and other disturbances are eliminated in tl1is cast1, as shown by the nice agreement of the resnlt~ for the several years. This arises no doubt from tlle fact that tbe ueglectetl corrections depending upon m and 11, (19), in the diurnal and semidiurnal tides, are entirely insensible in this 1"ase, for reai-;on:-; which hitve been already giveu, aml tliat only the abnormal accidental disturbances have to be eliminated.

'l'ne amplitude of thh; component, according to theory, should be to that of the correspoudili;r lunar compone11t very uearly in the proportion of the solar and lunar forces, and hence les8 tuan half a.-> great. If we except the first value, that of 1870, which tor 80flle rea.i,;on is much larger than the rest, the averages of the balance gfre about this mtio.

The 1:;cattering values of the e}lochs, <~, of the bwdiurua.l component indicate that there is no real component of this period. The Yalues also of the epochs, "' indicate t,hat. there is no real sensible quarter.diurnal solar component, and thi:.,; confirms the theoretica-1 relations given in Schedule IV, in which this component is designated L~- S, S,. }'rom the Yalues of H there given, it is seen that the ratio of UJbo; rn1mponent to the correspomliug lunar component ii< as A/ to ~.\ 1 2 , A 1 and A,, being the amp1itudes respectiyel,Y of the l11m1r aml solar semidiurnal l'Otnponents, and hence the amplitude of the solar quarter-diurnal component should lw onl~, about 4\, of that of the lunar. But this latter was found to be only about :! of an inch, antl hence the amplitude of the solar quarter-diurnal component would be by theory only about 1 ko of au iuch, and hence the component is too small to be brought out in the analysis of the observations. The one-sixth-diurnal solar component, tle'signated b~- S, (S, S,) in Schedule Y, should ha\·e an amplitude by theory, as seen from the >alnes of R in the schedule, ,~d1ich is to that of the corresponding lunar component, as A/ to A 13, that iR, only about 2 &,-, of the latter, and he11ce entirel.r insensible. 30. In all the other M, tides only two components, the dittmal and semidiurnaJ, were brought out in the analysis, the residuals :-;bowing tlta.t if there were any other o;eni,;ible components of a lower order they were too small to be of any importance. Of the diurual eowpuneuts only those belonging to the M~, Mt,, ".\f,, Mt:·, and .:Vlt~ tides depend upon terms in the tidal frlrces. These we shall consider further on. The scattering nilnes of the epochs,~., of the others, as well as the smallness of the amplitudes in most cases as brought out by the analysis, show that there an.1 no real diurual components belonging to these classes of tides, which is iu accordauce with theo1·y, fur there are not only no terms in tl1e tidal forces to give rise 1lirP.ct.l,Y to such compouents, but tlwre are none in Schedule III of the shallow-water diurnal components haying the same periods respectively. The quarter-diurnal shallow-water eomponent M, S, of Schedule n~, from the re,,;nlts of the analysis given in § 24, does not seem to be a sensible component at Pulpit Cow1, thougl1 at LiYerpool it has an amplitude of about five inches. The small aplplitmles giYen by the analysis are simply the effects of the unelimiuated irregularities, as the irreg1Ilm· values of the epochs indicate. According to the theoretical relations given by the valttes of H. in Scliedule IV, the amplitude of this component should be to that of the lunar quarter-diurnal component as A, t-0 ~A" that is, <LS .7706 t.o ~ x 4'.895, or 1 to 3 nearly. Bnt as the latter was found to be ouly about l of au inch, the amplitude of the former should be only about 1\ 1 of an iueh, and hence the compoileut is too small t.o he shown by the analysis of the obseiTations. This, together with the examJlle given in the last section, furnishes two ca1-1es in which tlte theoretical relations between the amplitudes in Schedule IV are confirmed, inasmuch as these relatious give uo sensible components when none are found by the analysis. In tile Li\rerpool tides, where the amplitmles are so large that very accm·ate comJlarisons could be made, I found that these relatiomi were aoourat;ely sa.tisfied by the results

If the fi \'e equations had been treated by the method of least squarei;;, the!".e residuals would haYe been divided in some measure among the other equations, and consequently would haYe been diminished a little, but this would have changed the value of iJ1'- but little on account of the small weight of the last two equations. The theory upon which these equations are based is that of deep-water tides, and if they do not precisely satisfy the results obtained by the analysis from the obser,·atiom;, the exphmation is to be found in the effects of shallow-water cornpouents, which are not taken into a.ccount in thesP equations. If we turn back to Schedule Ill aud examine the shallow-water 1linrnal ('Omponent8 given by theory, we find from the value of u = i~ that there are three which have the 8ame perirnl as the component depending directly upon the tidal forces, of which the amplitude is the first member of the first equation, a.ml oue afl:'ecting the amplitudes, or first members, of each of the other four equations in the same manner. :Now, sin<'e the efte9t of these shallow-water components cannot be separated from the others b~' analysis, we do not know whether they ha,·e a sensible eft'ect upon the preceding equations, but since the five equations cannot be completely satisfied with any values of the unknown quantities, and we h[we found from the analysis that there are sensible sba.Ilow-water components among some of the other classes, it is most probable t.hat these equations are slightly affected by sensible diurnal shallow-water components, and that the correction of the moon's mass, which we ha·rn obtained, 1WtJ· likewise be slightlJ- aifocted hy them.

The first two of these equations are based upon the two Jlrincipal diurnal components, and the other three should have comparatively small weight on account of the smallness of the componentfi upon which they depend. We shall therefore determine the unknown quantities from the first two. These give L 0 = 3000,3 and U = .701. These values satiRfy the equations with the annexed residuals. The first two are not much larger than the probable errors of observation, but the last one is mnch greater than the probahle error, ± :P.7, of the epoch 26'20.8 from observation, which imlicates that the theory is not completely satisfied by observation. This is no doubt on account of the disturbing effect of small shallow-water component8 not taken into account in the theory. The amplitude of this component iR only 0.8 of an inch, so that a disturbing component with an amplitude of only *of an inch, with the proper epoch, would he sufficient to change the epoch of the affocted component by the amount of the residual, and make observ;;ttion agree with theory. l f the preceding equations had been treated by the method of least squares, the residuals would have been tlistribiited among all the equations and somewlrnt diminished, and tbe values of the constants obtained would have been slightly different. The value of G above is the time in days by which the maximum of any inequality in the di urn al tide follows the time of the maximum in the forces, as for instance, the time that the maximum lunar diurnal tide follows the moon's greatest declination, or the tillle that the minimum follows the time of its crossing tbe equator, for the diurnal tide does not absolutely Yanish at this time, as is usually i,i1pposed, unless the conditions should he such as to make I<~= o, in the tidal expression8 of the preceding section, as in the case of the equilibrium theory. 33.

'l'lie first fh·c of these e<111utious are taken from Tida.1 Researcl1es (17l), neglecting the terms of a third order depending upon oc', and 1mtting for the first members of the P~1uatior1s their numerical values obtained from the anal.rsis of the observations, and the others are additional equations obtained in the 83.me manner and based upon other ~till smaller tide components. The componentH induded in the equations are denotetl by M2, M 111, M:i, &c. 'l'he preneding are the equations whinh he1oug to deep-water ti<leH without friction Yarying from the law of proportfonality to the tirst powm· of tl1e velo('ities, and with the two unknown quantities <let,ermined from observation shoultl repr<'sent the tides in m·ery part of the world. In a.dclition to tl1e am1llitudes of the several tide «'omponentis of Pulpit. Cove in the first members of these equations, those for Lh·erpool, and Kurraclwe, India, are also gh·en for the Rake of convenient eomparison. These are not the absolute values of the amplitudes, but the values in terms of tl1at of the mt>..an lunar component of each statiou. ln tides of shallow waters, the etfeets of the small shallow-water terms are not includeA.1 iu the relations expre8Setl by t11e.se equations. By the equilibrium theory the first members of these equations should be equal to the secoml members with B = o, and hence should be exactly the same at all tide stations in every part of the world. It is· seen, howeyer, from a mere inspeetion of the equations, how· very imperfectly this theory represents the tides at all of the three stations, and especially the tides of Pulpit Cove, and how diftereut must be the value of E at the several stations. It is seen from the first equation that the amplitudes of the solar semidiurnal tide at Liverpool and Kurrachee are less than what

they should be by the equilibrium theory by about t and t respeetiYely, and that at Pulpit Cove it is only about t of what it should be. It is readily seen from an inspection of these equations that they can be Ratisfied only ,-er.r imperfectly for Pulpit Coye, within any tletermined val1111K of ,,,,,_ mul E, aml that they can be m11cl1 better satisfie1l by muHipl.'·ing the first members of tlie e1}luttiom; hy an unknown constant. This constant is introduced upon the hypothesis that the tidal compouents are tlimiuh;hed by the eftect of friction which is as a higher power than the first power of the velocity, as nm Ye at various times explained. U?_:>on this hypothesis large tides are dimini:shed by friction more than small ones in prop-Ort.ion to their amplitudes, and hence where there is one large component, as the meau luuar, and a umnber of much smaller ones, since tbe amplitudes of the latter are obtained by analysis from the differences between the larger and smaller resnltant tides, the smaller compo11entfi are diminished more than the larger ones in proportion to their maguitudes, unles.s friction is as the fiI·st 1>ower of the velocity. If we rake the first, third, and fffth ot' the preceding <'(]uatiorns for Pulpit Cove, aml introduce a constant factor c, we have-

.1574c = (.4582- 36.2,Jp.) (1 .0469 c = (.1256 - :·t2 ?iµ) (1 .2082 c = .192:l (1 - .228 E)

The solution of all the equations h_y t_he method of least squares would give values for these constants differiug but little from those above on accouut of the ~nnallness of the amplitudes in the neglected equations, which gives them little weight. The Yalue of 0;1 above gives for the moon's mass 1 1 = \;, which is much too large, as is usually the case where the relations differ much from 6 those of the equilibrium theory. The equations for Liverpool give /L = -l0 , and for Kurrachee, where the relations approximate more nearly to those of the equilibrium theory, µ = ·d:s· which is per· haps not very much in error. The values of the constants above satisfy the preceding eiglit equations with the residuals annexed, which are in terms -Of the amplitude of the mean semidiurnal tide, which is 'nearly 5 feet. The fourth residual, therefore, is more than 2 inches. 'Yithout the introduction of the constant c these residuals would be. much larger. The value of this constant indicates that the amplitudes of all the smaller components relati vel,r to that of the mean lunar, are tliminished in the ratio of 1.166 to 1, or about t part; of this we have already had an indication, as shown in § 26. By the introduction of the constant c, or one equivalent to it, I have in all cases found that the observati-0ns are better represented by theory, and a better mass of the moon is obtained, which indicates that there is an effect due to friction or some other cause which diminishes the amplitude of the tides. Uplm the large value of E, required to satisfy the precediug equations, depends the peculiar type of tides at Pulpit Cove, in which the sohu· aud duclinational components are very srua11, and the amplitude of the Ms or principal elliptic oomp~nent is rnQ· large, even a fourth larger than the solar component, although the tidal force in the former ca.se to that of the latter is about as .192 to .458. This peculiar type of tide., so different from that of Europe.an tides and of tides generally, seems to extend all along our coasts, and is indicated by a difference in the values of E, so far as yet obtained, for our tides and for those of other parts of the world. These values are, as shown above: for Pulpit Gove, E = - 1.164; for Boston Harbor, E = - 1.412; for New York Harbor, E = - .963. In European tides we have: for Liverpool, E = - .288; Brest, E = - .323; and at Kurra.chee, India, E = - .440. The value of the constant c for Boston Harbor is 1.350, and for New York Ha.rbor, 1.245, both considerably greater than that found above for Pulpit Cove. The rnlur of c for Brest is 1.050, which is very nearly unity, as it should be by the equilil>rium theor_y. According to the va.lne of c above for Pulpit Cove, the correction applied to A', § :!1.i, tu reduce it to A, was 00<> .grea.t. by } part of the correction, since that correction was made upon t4e

The value of G is the time in da~-s by wU.ich the maximum of the vaQ'ing tide follows the maximum of the Ya.ryiug tidal force produl'ing it, and it is 1 he mean time mi the a...-erage by which the greatest tides fo1low the conjunction or opposition of the mnon and snn.

These components do not seem to be very larg·e in general at Pulpit <'on~. where they have been obtained from the analysis, but they are, no doubt, sufficient to so <listurli the relations as to 1n·eve11t a nice agreement between observation and tlrn theory of dt>ep-watn tides, and hence to reuder unreliable the determination of the moon's mass from tht>se relations. From the preceding investigation of the sliallow-water tides, I think that we cau nuw see dearly why it is that. satisfactory aud consistent ,-alues of the moou's mass have not in general been obtained from the relations of the semidiurnal tides; for these relations are disturbed by the Yarious sballowwater components, which do not enter into thi> theory of deep-water tides, which has been used in determining the moon's mass. The perfection of tl1e tidal theory, so as to represent accurately the results of ohsen·ation at all tide, stations, and gi\"e a C'Orrect mass of the moon, rlepernls mm mainly upon the study of tl11~ ,.;hallow- water terms. \Yith regard to the det,ermination of' tlw moon's mass, from the rmmlt8 so far as olitaiuhi the relations of the diurnal tides promise better success in the future than those of tl1e semidiurual tides. The diurnal tides are not aftected by so many of the shallow-water components, aucl it i . .;; probable that these can he determined from the analysis of the observations, since them are two comparatiYely (}Hite large components with perio1ls differing from those of any others, and hence can be determined by analysis of the observations; and then from the theoretical relations giYcn in Schedule III the others can be, at least approximately, determined, and the componentil of deep w:lter titles which they affect can be corrected for their effect. The relations of these corrected resultfl, obtained from tlie analysiR of tl1e obRerYatious, should then agree with the theoretil·al relath·es, and give a correct mass of the moon. 3."i.

Om\ ohjection in Ill~' mirnl to adopting the harmonic analysis of the tides was that it did not giYe the results in a form convenient for computing the heights and times of high and 11.TW water simpl,,-. I have, however, 8ttcceeded in putting the results into a form hy which I think these latter can be compute.I with as much or even more facilit.y than they can be by the old forms of expressions of high water and lnnitidal intervals, especially where the <linrnal tide is la.rge, as on the Pacific t'oast. B,v thP formula of Tidal Researches (22) we can put equation (8) into the following form : H = H 0 + R COR (2 i1 f - ''.u. + 1'.r) in which

lu this expression of H we I1ave t' 11 · '·' which is the epoch of the mean lunar scm.:iidinrual tidP, (livided by 2 i 1, equal to the mean lunitidal interval, and we shall h;we for the yariable Iunitidal int.erval, as affecte,d l1y the other eomponcnts.L = £~11. 'l.J_.~!!._ 2 i1

in which .J< mn.'!t have its value belonging to the time of hiyh water. Thitt assumes that the ti1ur of high water occurs when the angle 2 i 1 t - ":i. 2 ) + 19is eqval O. This is not strictly eorrect in any case, especially when the diurnal com11onents are large; but is sufficiently correct for the tides of Pulpit Uove, where these diurnal componeuts are very small. If we therefore have the \'alue of l\I and N for the time of high water, we readily obtain Rand ,'J for this time, the former of whieh added to the constant Ho, is the height of high water, and the latter divided by 2 i is the variable part of the lunitidal interval to be added to the mean value. As the values of the angles in the expressions of M.a.nd N are required at the time of high water, which is one of the quantities sought, the two quantities sought can only be obtained by approximations, but this is rendily done, ancl a second approximation is generally sufficient. The

first approximation is that which we obtain br assuming the time of water to be the high water of the mean lunar semidiurnal component. This, from the expression of H, is-

in which n is an;v integra.l number, and the days are reckoned from the beginning of the yNir. lf we then have a taNe of the time of the pas8age of the mean moon o.-er the meridian throughout the year, which is readily obtained b:y successive additions, thP llrst part of the expression of T gives the time to be added to t!Je time of the transit of the mean moon over the me1·idia11 in order to obtain the meau time of high water. The ntltw of : is con.itant, an<l that of c1 is constant through the year, but changes e\·ery year. Putting this value of T for the value of t in the npressioms of M and ~, we get the tirst approximate -value of 1'3. Adding this to the .-aloe of 0 111 in the expression of Tabon, this will giY(~ a second approximation of T, and then putting t equal this value of T in the expressions of .M and N, we generally get the values of H and ,1 with sufficient accuracy, and then the preceding expre!'lsion of J, gives the luuitidal inteiTal. The computations would be -very much facilitated hy having the ,-alues of the angle,; (i,, - :.!i1 ) t for each day throughout the year for all the sensible terms in the ex1iressions of 2\f and~ gh-en in tables, for then their -values could be readily obtained for any other time by interpolationi and >'nch a table would serve for every tide station. The computations would also be very much more facilitated in the case of any 1mrticular tide station to have the values of each of the terms in the expressions of .'.\I and X girn11 iu taulet> for every tenth degree of the arguments, from which, with tlw argument>' obtained also front tl1e tables mentioned above, the values of each term could be readily obtained. Such tables. ltowe-ver. eoultl only be used for the particular ticle >itation. 38. It bas been found that the unknown constants E an1l G, iu tlte ti1lal e>xprei,;,.ioni,;, as determined from the observations of Pttlpit Cove, ditter Yery little from those of the tides of Boston Harbor. This is a result of great practical importance, since it shows that the type of tlu> titl(· varies very little from Boston to Pulpit Cove, and it is therefore prohahle that it Yarie>' \'et·~ little from Cape Cod to Eastport. The ;mmc tidal tables and the same compntations of tht· titles for any one station, as Boston or Pulpit Cove, could 11fOl'3bly be used for e\·ery >'tatio11 from Cape Cod to Eastport, without any error of any practical importance, by simply chaugiug two COIL stants, that of the amplitude and epocl1 of the mean lunar tide. The ·former wonltl simply requirn the amplitude of the resultant tide .at any one station to be multiplied by a certain ~onstant to reduce it to that of any other station, and the other would require that the time or lt111itidal inter. val should be changed by a constant quantity. Such an arrangement would S<tYl' a great ammml of labor in computing the tides for a number of places along the coast. 39. Another result of great practical importance ifl the probable errors of tile amplitudes ol' the several tide components as obtained from one year's ol:isen·ations. From comparing the result:; of each of the six years with one another this has been found in the maximum ease to he only om·fourth of an inch, and on the average only al>out one-sixth of an inch. If we wish result,;, then·fore, of which the probable error is not more, say, than one-fourth of an inch, one year's obserrntions are sufficient, and for all practical purposes one-fourth of an inch is of no consequence whatever. For the tidal predictions, the most accurate formnl& tlo not _a(lmit of any a~curate cornparisont; with individual observations, since the abnormal meteorological disturbances may at an~· time be a foot, or even much more.
