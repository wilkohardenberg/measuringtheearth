Dr. Henry Smith Pritchett served as Superintendent from July l to November 30, on which date his resignation took effect. He left the service to accept the position of president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

A notable event during the year was the inauguration of the survey of the coasts of the Philippine Islands. Acting upon the information obtained by an officer of the Survey sent to the islands for the purpose of reporting upon existing conditions, an assistant of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was sent to Manila with authority to organize a suboffice and establish the necessary facilities for preparing the data obtained by the surveying parties in the field for immediate publication in the form of preliminary charts. · The Director of Coast Surveys in the Philippine Islands was also authorized to publish Notices to Mariners and all information useful to mariners as soon as practicable. A small body of trained officers was assigned to duty in this region and the existing conditions made it desirable to adopt the plan of making detached harbor surveys at all important places as the first step in carrying out the plan of the survey. A report of the results accomplished during the year will be found in Appendix No. l to this Report. . · From the foundation of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, in l83t, the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has been charged with the custody of the standard weights and measures of the United States. The constantly increasing demands upon the Bureau and the necessity for increased facilities and equipment induced Congress to establish the National Bureau of Standards by a law which was approved March 3, 1901, but did not become fully operative until .after the close of the fiscal year. A more detailed reference to this. subject will be found in the report of the Office of Standard Weigh,ts and Measures.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

f9CJL

On March 13, 1901, the necessary connections between triangulation in widely separated localities having been made and the computations being sufficiently advanced to afford the basis for such decision, the Coast and Geodetic Survey adopted a standard datum, to be known as the "U. S. Standard Datum," to which all geographic positions throughout the United States will be reduced, whenever possible, as rapidly as practicable, so as to make such positions strictly comparable in all portions of the country. In October, 1900, a notable publication was issued by the Survey under the title of ''The Transcontinental Triangulation and American Arc of the Parallel.'' The Hon. Lyman J. Gage, Secretary of the Treasury, honored the Sur\rey in authorizing the publication of the following, over his signature, as the preface to the volume:
The vomme which is here presented to the scientific world contains the results of the most extensive piece of geodetic work attempted by any.nation, a geodetic triangulation across the continent and the resulting arc of the parallel. This work has been conducted with the greatest care, and many improvements in the means of observation have marked its progress. In presenting this complete record of a great undertaking, carried through by a bureau of the Treasury Department, the executive officers of the Department feel that it will prove a contribution to the science of the world worthy of the United States. · ·

The preparation of another important contribution to the subject of geodesy was completed during the year under the title of ''The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States,'' and contains the discussion of an oblique arc extending from Maine to Louisi\J.na. The act of Congress making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, approved June 6, 1900, contained an item of ·appropriation for all necessary employees to man and equip the vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This legislation involved a radical change in the organization of the parties afloat, as the vessels of the Survey were manned with enlisted men of the Navy. The change was anticipated and had been prepared for as far as it was in the power of the Survey to make such preparations in advance of the date, July l, 1900, when the law authorizing it went into effect. On July l some of the vessels were en route to Alaska and others were returning from Porto Rico, and consequently the transfer from the naval to a civil basis could not he effected on that date. The plan agreed upon was that all the crews were to remain under their naval enlistment until such time as each ship should reach a home port, when the transfer would be made as soon as practicable, and that the Survey should repay to the Navy Department all of the expense incurred after July l. This plan was carried out and the crew of the last vessel from Alaska was transferred in November and the records of all the men under naval enlistment were closed in the following month. The constant changes of the coast line and of the depths in rivers, harbors, and ocean bars, the increase in the draft of ships, the new features continually added by commercial and other developments make it necessary to resurvey many parts of the c;oast at intervals more or less frequent. ~n the Eastern Division, hydrographic work was done on the coasts of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida; topographic work in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, and

REPORT OF THE SCPERINTENDENT.

South Carolina; triangulation in Massachusetts, :New Hampshire, Florida, Georgia, and Maine; elevations were determined by leveling in South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, and magnetic work was done in North Carolina, Maryland, District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. A permanent magnetic observatory was established at Cheltenham, Md., to be used as a base station. A continuous tide record was obtained at New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and Fernandina. In the Middle Division, the triangulation was extended along the ninety-eighth meridian in Nebraska and Kansas; nine base lines were measured in Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma Territory, and Texas, with primary accuracy and· unrivaled speed and economy, and magnetic observations were made in Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas,. Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In the Western Division, triangulation, topographic, and hydrographic work was done in Oregon and Washington. A continuous tide record was obtained at San Francisco, Cal., and at Seattle, Wash., and a speed trial course was established in the Santa Barbara Channel. Magnetic observations were made in Washington and Oregon. In Alaska, surveys were made along the coast of Seward Peninsula, including Port Clarence and Norton Sound. The survey of Prince William Sound was continued, and toward the end of the year the important work of surveying the principal passes through the Aleutian Islands into Bering Sea was begun, as well as the survey of Icy Straits and Cross Sound. In Porto Rico, hydrographic work was continued in the harbors and bays and off shore. The triangulation around the island and topographic surveys of the shore line were continued. The topographic survey of Vieques Island was completed. In the Hawaiian Islands, the work of separating the records relating to the Coast Survey from the Land Office records wa!' begun, and also the compilation of a list of the geographic names used in the islands. In the Philippine Islands, astronomic observations were made at fourteen stations, and the longitude, latitude, and azimuth determined. Magnetic observations were also made at these stations and tide observations were made at ten different places. Three charts and three notices to mariners were issued. Six additional charts (four from Coast and Geodetic Survey work and two Spanish charts needing republication with additions) were ready for publication on July 1. A steamer was purchased by the Philippine Commission for the use of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and money was..appropriated by the Commission to repair and equip this vessel.
MAGNETIC SURVEY.

The detern1ination of the magnetic elements was made in 340 different localities, embracing 376 stations ( 65 of which were in localities previously occupied) distributed over 31 States and Territories, from Maryland to Alaska, including the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, Porto Rico, and Brjtish Columbia, and the local disturbances affecting the mariner's compass in the waters along the coast of southeast Alaska were examined. The principal magnetic observatory or base station at Cheltenhai11, Md., r6 miles southeast of Washington, was completed, the instruments were installed and photographic records of the magnetic variations were obtained after April, 190r. A

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

photographic self-recording instrument was install~d in an extemporized building at Baldwin, Kans., and records of the magnetic variations were obtained after August,
1900.

Declination variations were observed in an extemporized building at Sitka, Alaska, after October, 1900, and special simultaneous magnetic observations were made by all the magnetic parties at various times and especially in connection with the total solar eclipse May 17 and 18. In addition to their regular work, these observatories will cooperate, at the formal request of the G'erman Government, with the international magnetic work to be carried out during the time <1f the Antarctic expeditions which have been sent out from Germany and Great Britain.
COAST PILOTS.

Owing to the Spanish war, officers engaged in the preparation of the Coast Pilots were detached, the work was interrupted, and some time was required to reorganize this special branch of the service. During the fiscal year, the Coast Pilot relating to southeast Alaska was thoroughly revised in the field and prepared for the printer. The field revision of the Coast Pilot between San Diego and San Francisco was completed and new editions of sections relating to the Atlantic coast were· published and the revision 3;nd issue of other numbers is progressing as fast as the available force will permit.
INTERNATIONAL LATITUDE SERVICE.

Satisfactory results have been obtained at the astronomical observatories maintained under the direction of the Survey at international expense at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., for the purpose of determining the variation of latitude.
SPECIAL WORK.

Speed trial courses for the use of ships and torpedo boats were established in Delaware and Chesapeake bays, and the Santa Barbara Channel course was extended. One officer of the Survey continued to se'rve as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, another was sent to the meeting of the International Geodetic Association held at Paris, France, in September, i:900, as the representative of the United States, and others investigated the methods of making hydrographic sur\reys and the printing of charts in foreign countries. In the demarkation of the provisional boundary between Alaska and British Columbia, one officer acted as commissioner and another as engineer on the part of the United States. Two officers of the Survey were appointed by the United States Supreme Court as members of a commission to retrace and mark the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee, and one officer was engaged on the resurvey of Mason and Dixon's Lir.e under an assignment requested by a commission of the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania. One officer completed the connection of gravity stations in the United Stat.es and Europe and another had charge of the Survey Exhibit at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, N. Y. · , Details in regard to the field work of the year will be found in Appendix No. 1 to this Report.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

The appropriations made for the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey on account of the fiscal year of 1901 amounted to $902,830. Of this amount $10,885 was for the use of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, which by later legislation has been merged into the National Bureau of Standaras. Sixty thousand dollars was for the rebuilding of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer A. D. Bache, and the sum of $20,000 for the building of a small steamer, while $210,245 was for the pay of the officers and men of the Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels, and $s4,600 for repairs of vessels. For Office expenses, including the purchase of new engraving machines, the sum of $38,ooo was provided, and the remainder of the appropriation was about equally divided between party expenses and salaries. The. statement of the expenditures during the fiscal year is given on pp. 24-5 r.

The usual work in the Office was continued. The work of reducing the geographic positions in southeast Alaska to a uniform standard was almost completed. The computation of more than l ooo miles of precise leveling lines was made. A United States Standard Datum, to which all connected geographic positions are to be reduced, was adopted and the positions of the primary points along the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation along the eastern oblique arc and along the western oblique arc were reduced to this datum before the close of the fiscal year. The discussion of ''The eastern oblique arc of the United States" was completed and submitted for publication. Bulletin No. 41, "The magnetic survey of North Carolina," was prepared for publication. The preparation of a new edition of the Magnetic Declination Tables was begun and the revision of the computation of all magnetic observations previously made by the Survey was undertaken and considerable progress made. The annual volume of tide tables for the year 1902 was prepared and published with the usual separates for the Atlantic coast and for the Pacific coast. It contains predictions for 70 principal and about 3 ooo subordinate stations throughout the world. Harmonic analysis of several series of tide observations were made, aggregating five years of continuous record. An aggregate of thirty-five years of record from automatic tide gauges was received, examined, and registered. The drawings for 13 new charts and for 9 new editions of charts were c9mpleted. The copperplates for 7 new charts and 5 l new editions of charts were also completed, Nine hundred and ninety-two plates were corrected for printing, and 75 330- impressions were made from the engraved plates. A new edition of the Chart Catalogue was prepared, published, and issued. Fifteen new charts published by lithography were issued. The usual monthly Notices to Mariners were prepared. published, and issued. An electrical apparatus for indicating changes in water level at any distance from the point of observation was purchased for use in the office of the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, and the changes and improvements necessary to adapt it for use as a tide indicator were completed. Details under this head will be found in Appendix No. 2 to this report.

The inspection of the field work during the first half of the fo;c;al year was confined to the personal supervision, by Assistant Ogden, of the operations of the steamer Endeavor, Assistant F. A. Young, commanding, engaged upon an examination of the bars and channels in the Delaware River above Bombay Hook. The work involved the determination of the availability of channels that differed about r foot in depth. The duties of the Inspector in the Office were more than usually onerous during the year. The act of Congress making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, approved June 6, 1900, contained an item of appropriation for all necessary employees to man and equip the vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This legislation involved a radical change in the organization of the parties afloat, as the vessels of the Survey were manned with enlisted men of the Navy. This change was anticipated and had been prepared for as far as it was in the power of the Survey to make such preparations in advance of the date, July l, 1900, when the law authorizing it went into effect. On July r, some of the vessels were en route to Alaska and others were returning from Porto Rico, and consequently the transfer from the naval to a civil basis could not be effected on that date. ' The plan agreed upon was that all the crews were to remain under their naval enlistm nt until such ·time as each ship should reach a home port, when the transfer would be made as soon as practicable and that the Survey should repay to the Navy Department all of the expense incurred after July I.) This plan was .carried out and the crew of the last vessel from Alaska was transferr~ in November and the records of all the men under naval enlistment were closed in the following month. The successful execution of this plan is· largely due to the courteous consideration of PaymasterM. M. Ramsay, U.S. N., aQd to his clerk, Mr. H. C. Jordan, who remained in charge of the accounts until the final settlement. The preparation of the necessary rules ~nd forms for the record of the civil crews required by the scheme adopted under the provisions of Treasury Department Circular No. 111, dated July 13, 1900, involved a large amount of labor of an unusual kind, and Assistant Ogden expresses his appreciation of the earnest and efficient work of Mr. J. H. Roeth, clerk, in this connection. Assistant Og.den sailed from New York on March 2, under instructions to proceed to Porto Rico and inspect the hydrographic and topographic work in progress in that locality. He visited the parties of Assistants Nelson, Flower, Boutelle, and Forney and

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

issued such instructions as were found to be desirable on account of the local conditions and the objects to be accomplished. He sailed from San Juan, P.R., for New York on May 8. . On October 20, 1900, a contract was entered into with the Towsend & Downey Shipbuilding and Repair Company, of New York, to rebuild the steamer Bache, and on March 19, 1901, a contract made with the James Reilly Repair and Stipply Company for building a small steamer under authority granted by Congress, and work on both these vessels was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The special appropriation for repairs to the steamer Gedney put the hull of the vessel in first-class condition, and a contract was made for a new boiler for this vessel, to be installed after the return of the ship from work in Alaska during the field season of 1901. The other vessels of the Survey received repairs during the year as they became necessary and were authorized by the appropriation for that purpose. The following is a list of the ships in service· during the year, with a chronological statement of their changes of station: ·

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

I9C>I.

A leaflet describing the preparation of Coast Pilots and ~ Notice to Mariners, stating changes in the sailing directions for Delaware River, were prepared for the printer. Specifications for rebuilding the steamer Bache and for rebuilding the steamer Hydrographer were also prepared. On June 30 the United States Coast Pilot, Pacific Coast, Alaska, Part I, had been prepared and was ready for the printer. The following publications, prepared by the Coast Pilot party, were issued during the year: ·
United 'States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part V (reprint). United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VII ( 2tl editlon). United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VIII ( 2d edition). Supplement to United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part V. Bulletin No. 40. Coast Pilot notes 011 the Fox Island Passes, Unalaska Bay, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean as far as Point Barrow (3d edition). Leaflet 011 Coast Pilots for Pan-American Exposition. Notice to Mariners of changes in Delaware River.

Assistant Ogden expresses his appreciation of the very satisfactory services rendered by the clerks in his office, and the great interest and earnest energy shown by the officers of the Coast Pilot party in the preparation of the work intrusted to them. III. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR OF GEODETIC WORK.
J. F.
HAYFORD,

'Inspector o.f Geodetic Work.

The inspection of the geodetic work is made, in the main, with<?ut leaving the office, in the form of a careful examination of the correspondence and monthly reports from field parties, and of the records and coinputations received from time to time. The Inspector of Geodetic Work is also the chief of the Computing Division, and is able to utilize as an efficient form of inspection the careful examination M which every record is necessarily subjected when the office computation is being made. The Inspector, therefore, only occasionally finds it necessary to visit ·parties in the field. For the purpose of inspecting the operations of the base measuring party at work on the Alice Base Line, in Texas, Assistant Hayford left Washington on December 4 and proceeded to Alice, Tex. He reached the base line on the 7th and thoroughly inspected all of the operations of the measurement and was much impressed by the skill which had been developed by the party during the season's work. · The plan of operation followed has resulted in very rapid measurement, with an accuracy in the determined length far above the limit absolutely demanded by the triangulation. Prof. A. E. Burton, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, taking advantage of the presence of the Inspector of Geodetic Work at the Alice Base, joined the party on December 8 for the purpose of submitting the tape apparatus constructed by the institute to a practical test in field use. This apparatus has been developed by the students of the institute during the past thirteen years, Messrs. Henry E. Warren and Geotge C. Whipple having taken the principal part in this operation. Authority was given for this test in order to determine whether this form of

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

21

apparatus could be used to advant2.ge in measuring any base line which may be required in the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The following is extracted from the report on this test Rubmitted by the Inspector of Geodetic Work:
The important feature of this form of tape apparatus is the device for obtaining the temperature of the tape. The whole length of the 100-meter tape and an approximately equal length of German silver wire form two of the arms of a Wheatstone bridge. The two variable arms of the bridge, together with the telephone which is substituted in the place usually occupied by a galvanometer, and the necessary interrupter, batteries, and connections form the thermophone proper. The electrical resistance of the steel tape varies more rapidly with a change of temperature than does that of the German silver. The ratio of the resistance of the tape to that of the German silver is therefore the measure of their temperatures; or, with sufficient accuracy, it is a measure of the temperature of the tape, provided the German silver is similarly exposed so as to have approximately the same temperature as the tape. The thermophone dial, over which moves a pointer which indicates the position of the contact point regulating to two variable arms of the bridge, is graduated so as to indicate the temperature of the tape in Fahrenheit degrees. This method of determining the temperature of the tape has three very important advantages over the use of mercurial thermometers either fastened to the tape or swung in the air near it. I. It determines the actual temperature of the tape regardless of whether the heat reaches the tape in the radiant form or otherwise. 2. The thermophone furnishes an instantaneous determination of the temperature of the tape. 3. The thermophone furnishes a measure of the actual mean temperature of the whole length of the tape.

The apparatus was also tested in Washington, before going to the field, by making repeated readings on a single tape length, extending over many hours of sunshine, shade, and darkness, covering two entire days. The Inspector was much impressed by the desirability of using this apparatus after certain modifications have been made, and commends the various good features combined in it at present. The Inspector also visited the leveling party at work in Alabama, under charge of Aid \V. H. Burger, and found the work progressing in a very satisfactory manner. IV. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR OF MAGNETIC WORK.
L. A.
BAUER,

Inspector of lllag11etic Work.

The work of inspection consisted mainly in duties incidental to the supervision of the field work in Terrestrial Magnetism, such as the preparation of the necessary directions and infonnation for the use o~ the field parties, the critical examination of the records of the magnetic observations made in the field, and the writing of the summaries and reports of progress. Personal inspection of the field work was made at various times, and during the fall of 1900 an examination of available sites for magnetic observatories in Alaska and in the Hawaiian Islands was made, as described in Appendix No. 1 to this Report ..

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is madt! not only by payments directly from the Disbursing Agent, but also largely through the medium of its Assistants and other officers, when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

23

approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order dated March 26, 1886, as follows:
EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, D. C., Marclz 26, 1886.

Under authority of section 3648 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, permission is hereby given that needful advances of money be made to officers of the Navy detailed to duty as chiefs of parties in the service of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and to all Assistants, SubAssistants, and Acting Assistants, or officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey acting as chiefs of parties and engaged under instructions from the Superintendeht of such Survey upon any work or operations of said Survey. No compensation shall be allowed for the disbursement of any moneys hereby authorized to be advanced, and the officers or persons authorized to receive and disburse moneys so advanced shall be subject to all the terms, provisions, and conditions of law as to the custody, disbursement, and rendering of accounts of public money of the United States. But no advances of money shall be made to a civilian chief of any party in the service of said United States Coast and Geodetic Survey unless a bond of such civilian officer shall be given in the penai sum of ·$2 ooo with two sureties who shall have qualified in that sum, and which bond shall contain the usual condition of the bond required by law from disbursing agents or clerks, and shall be approved by the Solicitor of the Treasury, and be filed in his office, and shall from- time to time be renewed, strengtltened, or increased, as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct.
GROVER CLEVELAND.

In conformity to this order there are now 57 officers of this Survey bonded in the.sum of $2 ooo, or more, each. When acting as chiefs of parties these officers receive, from time to time, such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and on the other hand receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers, and after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the First Auditor of the Treasury for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this service and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures.

The Annual Report for 1899 was conipleted under the direction of Assistant Preston, and the proof of Special Publication No. 4, "The Transcontinental Triangulation,'' was read. The MS. for Special Publication No. 6, "Notes Relative to the Use of Charts,'' was prepared, sent to the printer, and the proof was re~d. Progress was made in the preparation of the Annual Report for 1900, but owing to the illness of the editor, Assistant Preston, its completion was delayed. 01i assuming the duties of editor on March 5 Assistant Winston found the Annual Report for 1900 still incomplete. The plan upon which it had been prepared was examined and revised in order to make it accord more nearly with existing conditions, and the preparation of the illustrations was continued until May rs, when the completed MS. was sent to the Public Printer. In the latter ·part of May the MS. of a special publication ( 869 pages) covering the discussion of the eastern oblique arc of the United States, by Assistant Charles A. Schott, was received and prepared for publication, except the illustrations, which were not all completed before June 30. Abstracts of the reports of field parties for the first half of the fiscal year were prepared for the Annual Report for 19or. The MS. for all publications of the Survey passes through the office of the editor and the proof is received and sent to the proper division of the office for revision. The Tidal Division reads the proof of the Tide Tables, the Chart Division that of the monthly Notices to Mariners,' and the Coast Pilot Party that of the Coast Pilots and Supplements. The following publications were received and bsued during the year: .

The Office cobtinued under the general direction of the Superintendent, Coast and Geodetic Survey, with Inspector Stratton in immediate charge until June 30, 19oi. During the previous fiscal year an attempt was made to enlarge and reorganize the Office of Standard \Veights and Measures in order to meet the constantly increasing demands upon it more efficiently, and the draft of a bill providing for the establishment of a National Standardizing Bureau was submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury, with an appended statement of the conditions necessitating such legislation. This bill received a favorable report by the House_ Committee on Coinage, \Veights, and Measures, and was under consideration by the Senate Committee on Commerce at the adjournment of the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress. A great deal of interest was taken in the measure by manufacturers, scientists, and others throughout the country, and it was-favorably considered and passed by Congress in a somewhat modified form, and became a law on March 3, 19oi. The act provides that the Office of Standard Weights and Measures shall be known as the National Bureau of Standards, the duties to be as follows:
l. Custody of the Standards. 2. Comparison of the Standards used in scientific investigations, engineering, manufacturing, commercial, and educational institutions with the standards adopted or recognized by the Government. 3. The construction, when necessary, of standards, their multiples and subdivisions. 4. The testing and calibration of standard measuring apparatus. 5. The solution of problems which arise in connection with standards. 6.~The determination of physical constants and the properties of materials when such data are of great importance and not to be obtained of sufficient accuracy elsewhere.

The Bureau will exercise its functions for the Government of the United States, for any State or municipal g-overnment within the United States, or for any scientific

54

society, educational institution, firm, corporation, or individual within the United States requiring the use of standards or standard measuring apparatus. For all comparisons, calibrations, tests, or investigations, except those performed for the Government of the United States or State governments within the United States, a reasonable fee will be charged. Provision is also made for the purchase of a site, the erection of a suitable laboratory, its equipment with the most improved facilities, and the personnel necessary for the organization of the Bureau. Although the bill did not become fully operative until July 1, preliminary plans were immediately prepared by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures for carrying out the provisions of the act. This ii1volved the examination of numerous sites, and investigations as to equipment, personnel, and the immediate development of some of the more important lines to be taken up by the new Bureau. Preliminary investigations were made as to the construction and equipment of the more important laboratories of this and other countries, and of the work that must, of necessity, be developed as soon as possible after the organization of the new Bureau. A large number of sites were very carefully inspected with reference to their freedom from mechanical and electrical disturbances and accessibility, in order that a selection might be made as soon as possible after July 1, 19or. On account of the many requests for information received from Congressional committees and individuals in public and private life, the work of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures was greatly increased. Nevertheless the regular work of the Office was not allowed to suffer, and the usual number of adjustments and verifications of apparatus were made for the Executive Departments, for the States, and for others. . Numerous requests for information concerning the origin and present status of the metric system were received, showing that the country is considering the commercial advantages of the system in its transactions with European and South American nations. The use of this system in the Philippines, Porto Rico, and Cuba, and the dose relations existing between these islands and the United States since the war with Spain, has doubtless much to do with the interest now manifested in the subject. The division of the work of the Office into two sections was continued during the year. SECTION I. The usual number of verifications was made for the Executive Departments, for the State authorities, for manufacturers, and others. In addition, a 5-meter standard was determine<! for the Japanese Government, a 100-foot steel tape for the chief surveyor of the Straits Settlements, and two 50-meter tapes for the Mexican Government. The following is a summary of the work done;
59 tapes compared. 18 single weights verified. 13 sets of weights verified. 5 capacity weights verifie<l. 53 thermometers compared. 28 hydrometers verified. 14 leveling rods compared. 6 balances verified.

Total number of calls.
SECTION

II.

A large portion of the time was devoted to making plans for increasing the range of comparisons and for new lines of work to be undertaken. A second complete intercomparison of all the resistance standards of the Office, including two new 1-ohm coils, shortly before verified at the P. T. Reichsanstalt, were made during the year, and showed a gratifying constancy of the preliminary standards adopted. With a new intercomparison in contemplation, sufficient information concerning the rate of change of the coils will be at hand to allow suitable corrections to be applied and to enable the Office to guarantee results to within sufficiently small limits of accuracy to meet the most exacting demands, which is at present impossible on account of the absence of such information. The various resistance boxes of the Office were also recompared and the master standards of a number of manufacturers of scientific apparatus were verified.

SUMMARY OF Rl>SULTS.

16 miles shore line surveyed. 7 miles of roads and railroads surveyed. 1 mile of creeks surveyed. I 17 miles of sounding lines completed. 3 tide stations established.

From July 1 to August 4 the .h.agre was at Baltimore, Md., making repairs, and the party was employed in completing the records of the past season's work in Porto Rico. I.~ accordance with instructions, Assistant Boutelle took the vessel to New York for repairs, sailing on the .5th of August and arriving on the loth. : The vessel was placed in the dry dock for repairs, which were completed on September 12. On September 17 the vessel proceeded to Irvington on the Hudson, and the resurvey of the river at that point was begun. Watch Officer Proctor reported on board on September 19 and Assistant Little on September 29. The triangulation was taken up at the stations Hook Mountain and Pagoda, and extended up the river to Stony Point Light-house. The hydrographic work was completed from Ardsley and Piermont to a point opposite Hook Mountain. The topography was extended from Ardsley and Piermont to a point above Tarrytown on the east side and to Nyack on the west side. On the east side the fopography extends to the railroad track and on the \vest side to the road between Piermont arid Nyack. The weather was extremely unfavorable for field work on account of fog and rain. The work for the season closed on November 5, and the vessel sailed for Baltimore, Md., to fit out for work in Porto Rico. The vessel reached Baltimore on November 13.

In order to extend the standard levels of the Survey, Aid \V. H. Burger left Washington on July 15 and proceeded to Somerset, Ky., where the arrangements for the season's work were completed and a party was organized. The work began on July 23, and the line of levels was carried southward from Somerset, Ky., along the line of the Cincinnati. New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway to Harriman Junction, Tenn.'· and thence eastward along the Southern Railway to Knoxville, Tenn. While engaged in this work very little time was lost on account of bad weather, but the inconvenient schedule of trains used in transporting the party caused some delay. The route passed through a mountainous and sparsely settled portion of Kentucky and Tennessee, and the towns affording accommodations for the party were far apart. The grades on th.e railway were heavy, the trestles were long and numerous, and in the first hundred miles of the route the railway passed through 24 tunnels. The topography of the country rendered it impracticable to carry the levels around these tunnels and it was difficult to level through them. Variou.s devices were used to illuminate the leveling rods while at work in the tunnel, and an acetylene gas lamp, such as used on bicycles, was found to be more satisfactory than any other device on dark days and when the tunnels were not straight. In straight tunnels, when the sun was shining, a mirror was placed at each end of the tunnel and the rods were illuminated by reflected sunlight.

From a point near Elverton, Tenn., the levels. were carried over a branch lint: miles long to a triangulation station on Melton Hill. The levels were connected with bench marks established by the U. S. Geological Survey at Knoxville, and the party then proceeded to Woodville, Ala., under instructions to carry the levels from that point to Birmingham, Ala., via Decatur, Ala. The route followed the Southern Railway as far as Decatur, where the levels were connected with bench marks established there by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A. The route then followed the Louisville and Nashville Railway to Birmingham, where connection was made with bench marks established there by the Corps of Engineers, U.S. A., and the work for the season closed on January 12. The work described above forms a portion of the leveling operations between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala., undertaken to connect the elevations determined at the former place by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey with those determined at Knoxville and Chattanooga, Tenn., by the U. S. Geological Survey, and those at Decatur and Birmingham, Ala., determined by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A.

On July 1 Aid Dibrell, attached to the party of Aid J. A. Fleming, was making magnetic observations at Hatboro, Pennsylvania. The observations were completed on July 2, and on July 3 he reported at the Office. On September 4 he started to the field to make magnetic observations in Indiana and Michigan. Observations were made to determine the three elements of the earth's magnetism at the fifteen i-itations named above, and the stations were all marked with a stone post suitably lettered. On September 29, at Terre Haute, Ind., special declination readings were made at intervals of five minutes throughout the entire day, and the temperature was read and recorded at intervals of fifteen minutes, seventy-fifth meridian time being used. Similar observations were made by other magnetic parties in different parts of the country in execution of a plan to determine the areas over which the diurnal variation of the declination is the same. The work in this Division closed on October 16, and Aid Dibrell started on the 17th to continue his season's work by making observations in the Middle Division.

The work begun by Extra Observer Donn during the previous fiscal year was 1.:ontinued by him after July 1. The triangulation and the shore-line and adjacent details of Miles River, and the several creeks flowing into it from the east, were finished at the end of July, in addition to a large portion of the work on the south side of the river, between McDaniel and Bloomfield, the south margin being the Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad. In August all the interior work north of the Miles River and extending to the heads of the creeks flowing into the Back Wye, including the heads of Leeds and Hunting creeks, was completed. In September the work was advanced in all the branches of the Wye River, from points previously determined from the Eastern Bay and Miles River triangulation. Tpe work in this vicinity ·was completed, and on October 28 the party moved to Elkton. The survey of Elk Neck began on November 1. Much delay resulted from the difficulty of landing on the shore from a boat, the eel grass growing in the water covering the approach out to a depth of 6 feet in many places, and while using a team, from the necessity of driving long distances over bad roads to reach portions of the

Under instructions to determine such positions as were required for the topographic work in the vicinity of Portsmouth, N. H., and then to redetem1ine the position of the Isle of Shoals Light-House, Assistant Fairfield proceeded to that place on July 18. Operations in the field began on July 20, and on August 23 the geographic position of all the points required for the work had been detem1ined, computed, and furnished to the topographic party. On August 24 the work of recovering triangulation .points began, and continued until three old stations were found undisturbed. On August 31 Assistant Fairfield went to Isle of Shoals Light-House, and the observations there were made between September 5 and 15. The sea was too rough for him to leave the Light-House until the 20th, when he returned to Portsmouth. Much delay at the next station resulted from unfavorable weather, and the necessary observations were not completed until October 12. Ou this date he received instructions to close work and report at the office, and immediately proceeded to do so. On October 25 he proceeded to Beaufort, S. C., under instructions to determine the geographic positi6n of the points required for making a hydrographic survey of the entrance to Port Royal and of the Range Beacons on Hilton Head and Paris Island. Field operations began on the 27th, and all the necessary observations were completed on December 3r. Some of the triangulation points were difficult to reach, and at several of them it was necessary to erect high tripods and scaffolds for observing. Assistant Fairfield makes special mention of the aid rendered and courtesies extended to him by Admiral Sumner and the other naval officers at the Port Royal Naval Station. S. Doc. 50--6 81

32 stations occupied. 34 positions determined. 99 miles tape measurement. 99 miles of leveling (by vertical angles).

Operations began on January I4 under instructions to undertake the connections of the coast triangulation with that in the Blue Ridge Mountains by extending the work from the coast triangulation to Augusta, Ga., and the work was assigned to Assistant Fairfield. The line Port Royal to Church in the coast triangulation was used as a base for the work, and two other old stations, Parry and Brooklyn, were used in determining the position of a new station, Salt Bridge, on the ~harleston and Western Carolina Railroad, a short distance from Beaufort, from which a direct measurement was made along the railroad to a station Beach, near Beach Island, and a short distance from Augusta. The line was measured along the straight portions of the railroad and prolonged off the track to a junction of the tangents, where a change in direction occurred. The railroad is comparatively straight from Salt Bridge to Allendale, but there are fifteen curves in the next 25 miles, and the tangents range from one-half mile to 6 miles in length. This condition made it necessary to establish and occupy a large number of stations on this portion of the line. The remainder of the line was measured along a tangent 20 miles long to Beach Island, where final observations were made on June I I. The direct measurement was made with a steel tape lying on top of one of the rails along the straight portions of the railroad track and supported on wooden posts set at intervals of 25 meters when it was necessary to extend the measurement off the track to reach a station placed at the intersection of the two tangents wherever the railroad changed its direction·. The tape measurement began 011 March 9, and was continued after that date whenever the weather permitted until April I8, when it was completed to Beach Island station. The measurement was all made at night, except two short tangents which were measured on a cloudy afternoon. The line was measured twice, once in each direction, and the measures were made on different nights. The elevations were determined by measuring double zenith distances on every 200-meter mark on the portion of the line on the railroad, and on the 50-meter marks on the portion not on the track where the tape was supported by the posts. These observations were made while the tape measurement was in progress.

The azimuth was carried from the line Salt Bridge to Church by measuring horizontal angles at all the stations established at the points where the line changed direction and at some interpolated stations on the long tangents. These observati01l's were made in the daytime or at night, as was found most convenient, using heliotropes by day and lamps at night.

Assistant Fairfield expresses his appreciation of the efficient service rendered by Signalman Jasper S. Bilby in performing the duties assigned to him. He also reports the courtesy shown by the authorities of the Atlantic Coast Line Railway in stopping all trains between stations to take on or put off the party in going to and from work. This was a great convenience and greatly facilitated the work. The operations closed on June 22, and on June 24 Assistant Fairfield reported in person at the Office.

The leveling party in charge of Assistant Ferguson was at work in the field on July I, extending the standard levels south from Cincinnati, Ohio, and had completed the work as far as Corinth, Ky. The work was completed to Somerset, Ky., on the 31st of August, and connected with bench marks established at that place by Aid W. H. Burger in starting his leveling work a short time before. The party then moved forward to Harriman, Tenn., where the necessary bench marks were established from which to carry the line on toward the southern terminus. The route followed the Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway to Chattanooga, Tenn., where the levels were connected with bench marks established at this place by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., and by the U. S. Geological Survey. The levels were then carried along the Memphis and Charleston branch of the Southern Railway to Woodville, A1a., where connection was made with bench marks established by Aid W. H. Burger, from which he started his levels toward Birmingham, Ala. The work described above forms a portion of the leveling operations betwen Cincinnati, Ohio, and Birmingham, Ala., undertaken to connect the elevations determined at.the former place by the U. S.

FLEMING.

The preparatory operations leading to the erection of perinanent magnetic observatory buildings at Cheltenham, Md., were assigned to Aid Fleming on July 12. Under the direction of the Inspector of Magnetic Work an examination of the plans and methods of past and existing magnetic observatories was made. The result of his examination indicated the following as the chief requisites desirable in the location and erection of a magnetic observatory. . The selection of a site without local magnetic disturbances, and well removed from all probable future artificial magnetic disturbances; the elimination, in the construction of the buildings, of all materials showing any magnetic properties; the arrangements for absolute and variation instruments to be such that mutual interaction of the different instruments would be inappreciable; the building or buildings for the measurement of absolute values to be so constructed as to admit of a number of simultaneous determinations without danger of appreciable mutual interaction of the magnets of the various instruments; the building for variation observations to be constructed so as to have, without extensive heating, a uniform temperature throughout the year as nearly as possible; the buildings for the variation observatory to have accommodations for at least two sets of instruments, one eye-reading and one self-registering, both rooms to be of sufficient size to meet all reasonable demands. A site was selected at Cheltenham, Prince George County, Md., and magnetic observations were made in nine places within its limits to determine whether any local magnetic disturbances existed in this vicinity. · The plans were made and the buildings were erected in practical accordance with the requirements mentioned above. The unusual character of the buildings rendered it impracticable to construct them by contract, as all of the bids were in excess of the estimated cost and of the available funds. It was consequently decided to purchase the material and to erect the buildings by hiring the necessary labor. The work of excavating for the foundations and piers began on September 19, and the buildings were completed and ready for the installation of the instruments on December 22.

On September 29, Assistant French left \Vashington for the field, as a member of the party under charge of Assistant C. H. Sinclair, to be engaged in determining the latitude' and longitude of the Yerkes Observatory near Chicago. This work was completed on October 28, and on the 29th Assistant French proceeded to Danville, Ill., under instructious, to determine the magnetic elements, and to establish a meridian line at that place. This work was completed on Novetpber 4, and he proceeded to the Office in 'Washington, reporting for duty on the 19th. On March 15 he left Washington under instructions to proceed to Pensacola, Fla., and transfer the schooner Transit to Mad1sonville, La., and to make an inspection of the schooners Quick and Spy and the naphtha launch which were in charge of a ship keeper at that place. This work was successfully accomplished, and Assistant French proceeded to Darien, Ga., to complete the work assigned to Assistant E. D. Preston, who was relieved some time previously on account of ill health. He reached there on April 1 and immediately began operations for the purpose of determining the geographic position of Sapelo Light-House and other objects near the entrance of Doboy Sound. The old triangulation stations Spalding (reco\'ered by Assistant Preston), Fox, and Marsh were recovered, utilized, and remarked. Several objects formerly determined as secondary points were also utilized. A small sloop, hired for the purpose, was used as the means of transportation for two weeks, but it proved unsatisfactory on account of contrary winds, and a small steamer was used during the remainder of the season. The geographic position of the Light-House was determined and also the position of several old beacons, four range marks set for use in opening a proposed channel through the bar, and several other prominent objects. The unfavorable atmospheric condition caused considerable delay in the progress of the work. After completing this work Assistant French proceeded to Pensacola, Fla., under instructions to make a hydrographic examination of the channel into Pensacola Bay in the vicinity of the point where the U. S. S. llfassachusetts had grounded. Deck Officer Roeth, Captain's Clerk Sanger, and a leadsman were ordered to report to him at Pensacola and aid him in the work. Active field operations began on May 1 and ended on May 23. Three triangulation stations were occupied and the necessary positions determined for use in the hydrographic examination. Lines of soundings were run across the channel at the entrance to Pensacola Bay in several directions.

APPENDIX NO. r.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

In addition to this work, lines were run so as to develop the dredged channel through Caucus Shoal and the channel from this shoal to deep water in the bay. No work could be done on the bar after noon, and usually it was necessary to suspend work at 10 o'clock in the morning on account of rough water caused by wind. Whenever the bar became too rough for the work, the party was employed in topographic and hydrographic work in the bay. The topography of the western end of Santa Rosa Island and around Fort McRae was completed and plotted on the hydrographic sheet. The soundings covered the lower bay west of the navy-yard in a general way to show what changes had occurred since the former survey. Two tide gauges were established at the entrance of the bay and referred to bench marks previously established in connection with the reduction of soundings to a common plane of reference. Soundings were also made to develop the increase in depth of water near the wharves resulting from the dredging done by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company. As soon as t~is work was completed, Assistant French disbanded the party and proceeded to Washington, D. C., reaching there on May 25. He commends the efficient service of Messrs. Sauger, Roeth, and Nelsen. On May 30 Assistant French left Washington under instructions to make a hydrographic examination of Nantucket Sound in the vicinity of Horse Shoe Shoal, and southwest of this shoal to Great Point. Through the courtesy of the Chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service, the revenue cutter Dexter was detailed to transport the party and the commanding officer was directed to furnish the necessary assistance in preparing for the work. C. L. Green, first watch officer, William Sanger, captain's clerk, A. C. L. Roeth, deck officer, first class, and Joan Patterson, leadsman, were detached temporarily from the Survey vessels on which they were serving and ordered to report to Assistant French on board the Dexter. The Dexter proceeded to Nantucket Sound on June 3 and the work began on the following day. Tide gauges were erected at Nantucket and Edgartown, and tide observations were made at both places during the day for a period of fifteen days. A tide gauge was also erected on Horse Shoe Shoal, and observations were made on it while the soundings were in progress. On June 24 the Dexia was required for other duty and the work was suspended. The party was disbanded and the members of it returned to their respective stations. Assistant French proceeded to Washington and reported at the Office on June 25. His report states that Captain Hand and the officers of the Dexter did everything in their power to expedite his operations, and commends them highly for making it possible to accomplish so much in the few days available for the work.

The ship was coaled and ready for sea on the 8th, and sailed on that day for Cape Hatteras. After much delay, on account of the dense bank of smoke hanging over the coast and ocean, the Blake reached Hatteras Cove on August 9. Owing to the conformation of the coast and the distance of the work from the shore, the difficulty of accurately locating the ship while sounding would have been great under the best conditions, but this difficulty was vastly increast:d by the very unfavorable atmospheric conditions which prevailed while the work was in prog;ess.

Very fortunately, however, no occasion for such a warning arose, the weather during almost the whole month of August being very moderate and the sea very smooth, though the atmospheric conditions were most unfavorable. The work was successfully completed on August 30, in spite of the difficulties under which it was executed, and gave a very satisfactory delineation of this previously unknown area, and. developed the existence of an extensive mud bank, with a little more than 30 fathoms of water on it, in a good position in which to anchor the light-ship. The work closed on August 30, and the vessel sailed the same day for Norfolk, Va., and reached there on the 3rst. From Norfolk the Blake proceeded to Washington, D.

The preliminary arrangements were completed and on July 20 he proceeded to Brooklyn, N. Y., and field operations began in the vicinity of that city on July 21. The work progressed without interruption until October 20, when the field operations closed. As many of the old triangulation points were recovered as . possible, and from these various objects, including new stations, were located, which served to fix town plans, roads, etc., in position, so that these could be plotted on the old topographic sheets or on new projections. Numerous field notes and sketches were also made to cover the region examined, and the position of all prominent buildings in the towns was noted on the town plans obtained from the officials of each place. · In this way such work can be done very rapidly, and with the required degree of accuracy.

Thames River, Connecticut.

The revision of the hydrography and topography on the Thames River, Connecticut, with a determination of the position of the river lights and buoys between New London and Norwich, was taken up in August and the work was assigned to Assistant Marindin. He left Washington on August 4, and field operations began on the 5th. The necessary signals were erected, and tide staffs were established at five points in the river. The hydrographic work above New London includes a resurvey of that part of the Thames River from the railroad bridge at New London to the upper limits of the United States naval station, and from this point to Norwich a hydrographic reconnaissance of the channel in connection with the determination of the position of the range lights and buoys. The position of the buoys and of 20 range lights was determined by using a plane table and the topographic sheets of the original survey. A resurvey was made locating the shore line and railroad on the left bank of the river between the New London railroad bridge and Allyns Point, by using a plane table. A hydrographic examination was made of the best channel across the shoal ground situated between the 30-foot contour in the sound at the mouth of the Thames River and the deep hole below the railroad bridge at New London. A weighted rope, 500 feet long, with each end attached to the stern of a tugboat, was dragged along this channel, covering in all a width of about 600 feet, without discovering any obstructions. An examination was also made to discover a rock reported as an obstruction to navigation in Greens Harbor, a portion of New London Harbor. The rock was dis covered and its position determined. Upon the completion of the work outlined above, Assistant Marindin closed the field operations on September 24 and reported at the office in \Vashington on the 25th.

The schooner Matchless, Assistant W. I.Vinal, commanding, reachedCharleston,S. C., on June 14. Assistant Vinal was instructed to make a new survey of the old channel entrance to Charleston Harbor, in response to a. request from the United States Light House Board, to furnish information upon which any change in existing lights and buoys could be based, or any new ones established could be located. The survey of the old channel was limited by adopting its intersection with the main channel for the northern limit of the work, and the 4-fathom curve to the southward of the bar as the southern limit. He was also instructed to make a plane-table survey of the outside shore line from Cummings Point southward to the limit of the hydrographic sheet furnished for the work. The geographic positions for this work were determined by a triangulation party and furnished to Assistant Vinal. The tide gauge established at Fort Sumter was referred to Cummings Point and connected by levels with Charleston Light-House, where a mark was established. A tide staff was attached to the wharf on the north side of Light-House Inlet and referred to .the bench mark, to furnish a plane of reference for the soundings. A plane-table survey was made of the shore line of Morris and Folly islands, from Cummings Point southward to the limit of the hydrographic sheet. The work was completed on July 27, and the Matchless sailed for Baltimore on July 28, and reached that place on August 7. The vessel was placed on a dry dock for examination and temporary repairs. After coming out of the dock, the vessel was anchored off Sea Girt, and the party was engaged in completing the records of field work until September 2 I, when Assistant Vinal was relieved of the command of the vessel by Assistant George L.

On December 17 the steamer Baclze, \V. I. Vinal, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, left Baltimore and arrived at Shooters Island, Xew York, on the 19th. The ship was placed in the dock of the Townsend and Downey Shipbuilding and Repair Company, who had been awarded the contract for building a new hull, and remained there during the remainder of the fiscal year. Assistant Vinal continued in command of the ship, with a reduced crew, to care for the Government property and render such assistance as might be in his power to hasten the completion of the new hull. On April 18 he began the survey of the shore line and the hydrography of lower Newark Bay and Kill von Kull. This work was continued whenever the weather conditions permitted until May 31, when some of the officers were needed for more urgent work, and operations were suspended and not continued until after the close of the fiscal year.

SUMMARY OF R!;SULTS.

J( square mile area covere,d by topography. 1 mile of coast line surveyed. I mile of shore line of river surveyed. 2 miles of shore line of creeks surveyed. 2 miles of road surveyed. I topographic sheet completed. 1 base line measured with tape. Y. mile of beach measured with tape. 4 square miles area cov;!r d by triangulation. 9 stations occupied. 8 geographic positions determined.

An examination to determine the desirability of establishing compass deviation range marks at Delaware Breakwater for the use of vessels in adjusting their compasses was made by Assistant \Vainwright July 5 to 7. This work was completed and he returned to the Office and resumed his regular duties. On October 22 he again left the Office and proceeded to Charleston, S. C., under .instructions to organize a party and make a special survey in that vicinity in accordance with a request from the Navy Department for the information of the Naval Board, '' organized for the purpose of examining into the expediency of changing the location of the naval station now at Port Royal, S. C., to some point in the State of South Carolina, at or near the city of Charleston.'' A topographic survey on a large scale was made of the locality known as the Lawton plantation, which is situated on the right bank of the Cooper River, about 6 miles from the custom-house wharf, and extends from Chicora Park southeastward along the river for nearly 1 mile. A very small contour interval was adopted as the one most suitable for the topographic work. A number of bench marks were established by spirit leveling and used by the topographer iii his work. The plane table and wye level were both used in delineating the details. The topography was controlled by nine triangulation points, whose positions were determined for this purpose and the determined distances depend on a base line measured twice with a steel tape. Assistant Wainwright reports that the services of Aid Tilton were particularly valuable, on account of his familiarity with leveling operations, and states that with some additional experience he will become a competent topographer. . He also makes special mention of Mr. R. J. Emory, jr., for the zeal and intelligence with which he executed all the duties assigned to him. Having completed the work assigned to him, Assistant \Vainwright proceeded to Washington and reported for duty at the Office on December 27.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

375 miles of shore-line of rivers surveyed. 20 miles of roads surveyed. 2 topographic sheets completed. 54 triangulation stations occupied. 6o geographic positions determined.

The duty of making a resurvey of the Choptank River and tributaries was assigned to Aid Weld, and he left Washington for Tilghman, Md., on July 1 I. After some preliminary work he organized a party on July 16 and began at once to erect the signals necessary to extend the triangulation from a line already determined by the Chesapeake Bay triangulation. The naphtha launch assigned to thee us of the party was not ready for use until August 27, and much delay resulted from the use of sailboats previous to that date. On August 29 a subparty was organized and placed under direction of Assistant Latham, who used a sailboat until October 13, when a launch was available for his use. The triangulation was extended up the Choptank River, to Cabin Creek, 10 miles above Cambridge, Md., and also up the larger tributaries. The shore line was surveyed by using a plane table and such adjacent topography was done as could be easily reached from the shore line. The survey extends fr.om Force Point, on the Chesapeake Bay, just below Poplar Island, to Hills Point, and then up the Choptank River to Cabin Creek. A good deal of the interior topography, as shown on the topographic sheets of the former survey, made in 1847, was examined and the changes noted in order to transfer it to the new sheets. Aid Weld left the work in charge of Assi!)tant Latham on November 15 and proceeded to the Office in Washington. Aid Weld commends Assistant Latham for his zeal in executing the duties assigned to him. The work was continued by Assistant Latham until November 21, when he closed work and reported at the Office in Washington on the 22d.

On July 1 the steamer Bache, P. A. \Velker, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, was at work in Chesapeake Bay below the mouth of the Potomac River, engaged in executing the triangulation required for the resurvey of the hydrography of this portion of the bay. A reference to the progress in this work before July r is contained in the Report for 1900. It was continued without interruption until July 24, when preparations began to transfer the men on the Baclze from the Navy pay roll to that of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The transfer was completed and the necessary recruits to fill vacancies caused by discharges were secured by August 6, and field work was resumed. On September 4 Lieut. Commander Charles E. Vreeland, U.S. N., member of the Board of Inspection and Survey, Navy Department, was taken on board at Annapolis, Md., for tht: purpose of making an examination of Chesapeake Bay to the westward of Barren Island, with a view of establishing a trial course, r mile long, for torpedo boats. ·The assignment of the ship for this work was made at the request of the Navy Department. The examination was completed on the 8th and the vessel returned to the lower bay after landing Lieutenant Commander Vreeland at Annapolis. Preparations were made ,for a change in the command of the ship, and on September 15 Assistant Welker was relieved and ordered to command the steamer Blake. First Watch Officer Green assumed temporary command of the Bache on September 15 and remained in command until September 21, when he was relieved by Assistant W. I. Vinal, who took command on that date at Baltimore, Md. On September 26 the Baclte left Baltimore, and on the 27th landed H. C. Mitchell, aid, .at New Point Comfort light-house to continue the observations at that station. After repairing the damage to the triangulation signals resulting from recent storm, the vessel returned to Baltimore and was held open to inspection of bidders for

Coal and provision were taken on board, and on October ro the vessel returned to the working ground, where the work was continued until the 25th, when the ship returned to Baltimore to permit measurements, etc., to be made by those wishing to bid on the contract for reconstruction, and was detained there until November 14, when she again returned to the lower bay and resumed active work in the field, which was continued until the 28th, when the work closed and the vessel returned to Baltimore. On December 17 the Bache sailed for New York, and reached Mariner Harbor, Staten Island, on the 19th. The vessel was then placed in the hands of the ship builders who had been awarded the contract to rebuild the ship.

were in progress, and a sufficient number of positions had been determined to start the hydrographic work. Four signals offshore were found to be necessary and \Vere erected with difficulty in water -0 to 25 feet deep. The bottom was found to be of a hard, coral formation, and iron pipes could not be pumped down as usual in such cases. Where the water was less than 12 feet deep a wooden tripod was framed, supported by boats, and lowered into the water with the bottom heavily weighted. A pole with targets attached was secured to the top of this tripod and held in place by guys attached to anchors. In deeper water a gas pipe 2Yz inches in diameter, heavily weighted at the bottom, was dropped overboard and secured in an upright position by guys with anchors, as mentioned abm·e, the usual targets being fastened to the top. Three of these signals were destroyed by a gale before serving the purpose for which they were erected, and it was necessary to replace them. On February 9 Assistant Welk er received telegraphic instructions, sent at the request of the Light-House Inspector of this district, directing him to replace the Texas Rock buoy, which had gone adrift and was then stranded in the southeast channel near the entrance. The buoy was recovered on the 11th, but was in such bad condition that it was necessary for the vessel to visit Key \Vest to obtain a new one. The new buoy was placed in position on the 18th, and in executing this work one of the ship's anchors was lost. Two large hydrographic signals were carried away in a heavy squall on the 19th. This squall developed into a violent ''norther'' during the following night, and five of the signals on the outer reefs were carried away by the heavy sea. Stormy weather prevailed during the remainder of the month and early part of l\farch, and little progress was made. On March 9 the vessel sailed for Tampa, Fla., to obtain a steam launch which had been sent by rail to that place for the use of the party. Special arrangements for transporting the launch were made, and it was necessary to wait for favorable weather for the return trip on account of the weight of the launch and the consequent clanger of the lashings giving away. These conditions caused so much delay that the launch could not be placed in the water at Dry Tortugas until March 18. Rapid progress was made with the work during the early part of April, but after the 16th the weather was again stormy and more signals were carried away, causing much delay. During May, -more progress was made than in the previous three months, and on May 24 the hydrographic survey of all the approaches to Dry Tortugas was completed. The ship sailed next for Key West towing the launch. The launch was put in proper condition for storage and turned over to the commandant at the United States naval station for safe-keeping. The necessary supplies were taken on board and the Blake sailed for Baltunore on June 1 and reached that port on June 6. The rest of the month was spent in putting the ship in condition for work on Nantucket shoals and in making necessary preliminary preparations. Assistant Welker reports that Assistant Flynn performed valuable and efficient service in navigating the ship, in the triangulation and hydrographic work, and in directing the office work of the ward-room officers. The Blake was at Baltimore at the close of the fiscal year.

A hydrographic examination of the bar off the entrance to Port Royal, S. C., to determine whether certain reported changes since the last survey existed in fact was made in December under the direction of Assistant Yates. The two officers mentioned above and a leadsman were ordered to join the party, and the revenue cutter .Forward was instructed, through the courtesy of Capt. C. F. Shoemaker, Chief of the Revenue Cutter Service, to take the party on board and to render every possible assistance to Assistant Yates in the prosecution of the work assigned to him. The work began on December 5 and was continued whenever the weather conditions permitted until it was completed on December 28. The location of nearly all the signals used in connection with the work had been determined by triangulation fr0m the shore and the location of the other signals was determined by measuring sextant angles on two of the triangulation point;. Tide observations were made at the Port Royal Naval Station and on the bar during all the time that the soun~ings were being made. The observations on the bar were made on a tide staff attached to the wreck of a vessel lying about 3 miles inside of the bell buoy. The plane of reference used for the reduction of the soundings and the time correction for the dista1ice of the water tide staff from the bar were determined from simultaneous tide observations at the outer tide staff and at the Port Royal :Naval Station. All the soundings were obtained with a well-seasoned lead line, which was carefully tested before and after the soundings were made. The leadsman was an expert with many years of experience, and the soundings were rpade only when the water was smooth. Especial care was taken to determine the height of long ground swells. The examination was made for a special purpose, and consequently no attempt was made to develop anything but the best practicable channel over the bar and the relation of this channel to the buoys in position at the time the work was in progress. At the beginning of the work it was found that the location of the ranges did not indicate the deepest water over the bar, and it was decided to adopt the channel used

by the local pilots as the base for the development of the examination. The location of the pilot's channel was determined by having a pilot, who \\'as selected by the local pilot association, take the vessel four times across the bar through what he considered the deepest water. The position of the vessel was determined at every minute while running these lines, and soundings were made every twenty seconds. The development of this channel dtd not change the results obtained. Upon the completion of the work Assistant Yates returned to Washington. His report expresses his appreciation of the effective aid rendered him by Capt. J. C. Mitchell, First Lieut. F. S. Van Boskerck, jr., and Chief Engineer H. C. Barrows, officers of the cutter Forward, and the interest they showed in the work.

The steamer Endeavor, with Assistant Young in command, was engaged in making hydrographic examinations and surveys in the Delaware River between Chester, Pa., and Bombay Hook from July r to November 26. The work involved the determination of the availability of the channels that differed about r foot in depth, and resulted in showing that changes in depth had taken place since the previous survey upon which the ranges for the use of shipping were based. The work was greatly facilitated by the data furnished by Lieut. Col. Charles W. Raymond, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., in charge of improvements on the river, which included a large number of geographic positions, blue prints of hydrographic surveys, and other information. The triangulation executed under his direction was connected with the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and can be used in the future as a part of the Survey system.

All recent hyclrographic surveys of the Engineers were a guide to tlw special localities examined and rendered it possible to eliminate large areas from consideration. Assistant H. G. Ogden, Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, was on board the Endeavor during this examination and supervised the operations. During the season two obstructions to navigation were discovered just off the channel below Pennville by using a long fishing net. This net was weighted and allowed to float downstream, being so arranged that when the bottom cau~ht on any obstruction the float immediately above the object would disappear beneath the surface of the water. The sounding boats followed the net downstream and located the obstructions. On November 28 the vessel started to Baltimore, Md., via the Delaware and Chesapeak Canal, and reached that place on the 29th. Assistant Young commends the efficiency displayed by the officers under his command in performing the duties assigned to them. The Endeavor remained at Baltimore from December 5 to March 21, and minor repairs were made to the vessel. On March 22 Assistant Young left Baltimore unaer instructions to make a hydrographic examination at the entrance of Sassafras and Elk Rivers in Chesapeake Bay. The necessary signals were erected and tide gauges were established at Pooles Island, Betterton, Reybolds \Vharf. and Town Point. Observations of the tide were made by simultaneous readings on the gauges at these stations between March 23 and 28. The gauges were referred, by spirit leveling, to bench marks established in the previous work, for the purpose of comparing the results with those formerly obtained. On account of unfavorable weather, soundings were made on only four days, but a number of lines were sounded. The soundings at mouth of Sassafras River were referred to tide observations at Betterton, and those at the mouth of Elk River to tide observations at Betterton and at Rey bolds \Vharf. On April I 7 the E11dcaz·or returned to Baltimore for additional repairs, which were not completed until June 22. On June 23 the Endeavor again left Baltimore, under instructions to continue the hydrographic reconnaissance begun during the preceding fiscal year by Assistant Vinal in Lower Chesapeake Bay. Thirteen triangulation stations were visited and the signals were repaired. This work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

9 hase lines measured.

A party was organ· zed under the direction of Computer A. L. Baldwin to measure 9 base lines, distributed along tlie 98th meridian. These base lines had been located and the ends marked during the progress of the reconnaissauce for the triangulation. The work began on July 16 an<l the following base lines were measured during the season: Shelton base, near Shelton, Nebr.; Page base, Holt County, Xebr.; Anthony base, Harper County, Kans.; El Reno bas~, Canadian County, Okla.; Bowie base, Montague and Clay comities, Tex.; Stephenville base, Erath County, Tex.; Lampasas base, Lampasas County, Tex.; Alice base, Nueces County, Tex.; Seguin base, Guadalupe County, Tex. Five base apparatus were used in measuring each base, two 50-meter tapes, two loo-meter tapes, and the duplex bars. At the first base a comparator, loo meters long, was prepared and measured with the standard bar in melting ice. On this comparator each apparatus was standardized before beginning the base measurement. At the last base a comparator was established in a similar manner, and the operation of comparing each apparatus with the standard bar was repeated. At every base l kilometer was measured once with each apparatus as the means of comparison, and one-fifth of the remaining length of the base depends upon measurements made with each apparatus. The portion measured with the duplex bars was remeasured with these bars. A double portion was measured with one 50-meter tape and remeasured with the other, and a double portion was measured with one 100-meter tape and remeasured with the other. This programme was successfully carried out, and on January 16, 1901, six months after the work began, the last comparison was made, after completing the measurement of the last base line, and a notable record in the measurement of base lines for primary triangulation was an accomplished fact. The mne base lines aggregate 69 kilometers or 43 statute miles in length, and are

so widely distributed along the meridian that twenty-six d.ays of the time during the season were necessarily used in moving the party and outfit from base to base. In addition to the officers, five laborers were used in the measurement. At the first base advantage was taken of the comparator established there to standardize two roo-meter steel tapes for the Japanese Government, this work being done under the direction of Mr. Louis A. Fischer, adjuster of weights and measures, in the Office of Standard \Veights and Measures. At the Anthony base, the party was inspected while at work by Dr. H. S. Pritchett, then Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and at the Alice base Assistant John F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodetic Work, visited the party and inspected all the details of the measurement. Prof. A. E. Burton, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, accompanied Assistant Hayford, and during their stay with the party some field tests were made with thermophone tape apparatus belonging to the institute. As an instance of the rapidity with which some of the work was done, it may be mentioned that at the Stephenville base, 6.3 kilometers long, the interval between the arrival of the party 01 the line and the departure therefrom was eleven days, two of which were Sundays, on which no work was done. Mr. Baldwin reported in person at the office on January 31.

485 square miles area covered by reconnaissance. IO triangulation stations ·selected. 9 triangulation stations occupied. 21 geographic positions determined. 958 square miles area covered by triangulation.

The continuation of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was in progress under the direction of Assistant Granger on July 1 at Ono triangulation station, \Vheeler County, Nebr., and the work progressed without serious interruption until the close of observations at station Old, Holt County, Nebr., on October 17. This work is the continuation of Assistant Granger's previous work along this meridian. The actual time required in making the observations of horizontal and vertical angles at the nine stations occupied was fifty-nine days, or an average of six and onehalf days to a station. The number of ~Erections observed at a station ranged from 4 to 8, with an average of 5. After closing observations at station Old, and storing the instruments and outfit at Page, Nebr., Assistant Granger took up the work of reconnaissance northward from the line Walnut to Sparta, and selected two new stations which formed a quadrilateral with the two already named. Field operations were closed on November 8, and Assistant Granger reported at the Office for duty on November 12. On April 13, 1901, Assistant Granger left New York for Page, Nebr., under instructions to continue his work of the previous season on th~ extension of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian northward through Nebraska and South Dakota. He reached Page on the 15th and immediately prepared for reconnaissance work. He continued the reconnaissance until June 20, when he returned to triangulation point Walnut and prepared to occupy the station. The observations at this station were in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Assistant Granger expresses his appreciation of the efficient service rendered by E. E. Torrey, foreman, and D. A. Lewis, driver.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1901.

On October 31 final disposition had been made of the outfit for the winter, and on November 1 Assistant Mosman started to Washington and reported at the Office on the 6th. Assistant Mosman left Washington on May 17 under instructions to proceed to Sterling, Kaus., and resume work on the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in continuation of his '\vork of the previous season. Signalman Bilby was sent to the field a few days earlier to secure outfit and make necessary preliminary arrangements. He built tripods and scaffolds at Sunflower, Pretty Prairie, Kingman, and Cheney stations and finished the structure at Arlington. The scaffolds at Arlington and Kingman stations were extended above the tripod to a height sufficient to allow the heliotropes mounted on top to b~ seen from other stations, where it would otherwise have been necessary to mount the observing instruments so high above the ground that it would have been dangerous to occupy the stations on account of strong wind when the screens were in place during the observations. The screens were necessarily used on all scaffolds while obst;rving, as the prevailing wind in this region caµsed too much vibration of the instruments to permit observations without them. On June 3 and 4 the camp outfit was moved from storage to Savage Station and the station was ready for observations on the 8th. Strong wind prevented work until June 12 and the obsenrations were completed on the 14th. It was difficult to procure teams for transportation to Station Gilmore, and this station was not ready to begin observing until the 2 rst. Unfavorable weather caused a delay of two days, but the observations were completed on the 25th. More time was lost in finding teams to transport the outfit to Station Partrid?e, and this station was not ready for observation until June 30. Harvesting the crops goes on at this season in Kansas and all available transportation and labor are engaged. At the end of the fiscal year the work was in progress.

In continuatjon of the work described in the Eastern Division, Nautical Expert Ross left New Orleans on December 7 for Galveston, Tex., visiting Morgan City, Sabine, Rockport, and Aransas Pass en route. While at Sabine he made a trip through the Port Arthur Ship Canal. He reached Galveston on December 14 and organized a party to make a hydrographic examination of the bar off the entrance to the harbor. In connection with this work, Mr. Ross reports the courtesy extended to him by Capt. C. H. Riche,. Corps Engineers, U. S. A., and the valuable assistance rendered by his orders. He was given every facility to examine the original records of surveys made by the Engineer Corps, and an assistant engineer and several employees were detailed to assist him in making the hydrographic examination of the bar. The soundings made were more for the purpose of comparison and to note any indication of changes in the buoyed channel which might have occurred during the two months which had elapsed since the survey t11an to develop the contours of depth over the bar. The bar buoys were relocated during the progress of the work. The steamer Pkerabe, of Galveston, was hired and Mr. Ross was fortunate in having a day for the work when there was no sea or swell on the bar, a rare condition at the season of the year. · After completing the duty assigned to him, Mr. Ross returned to Washington on December 26.

The leveling work under the direction of Aid Tilton was in progress on July I at Hadir, :Nebr., and the party was at work continuing the line of levels between Norfolk and Page, Nebr., as i:eferred to in the Report for 1900. The line was completed to Page and connected with the south end of the Page base line of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian on July 28. On the same day the party started to Solomon, Kans., to extend the levels south from that place. The route from Solomon to Anthony, Kans., followed the Union Pacific Railway to Salina, over the route of the transcontinental line of levels, thence along a branch of the same road to McPherson, from which place the route followed the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to Anthony, Kans., where the work was closed for the season on October 14. A branch line was run from Pretty Prairie, Kans., to a point near the selected triangulation station of the same name, and from Kingman, Kans., to a point near the selected triangulation station, also of the same name. As these stations had not been occupied and marked, a stone bench mark was established at the end of each one of these branch lines. The line was connected with the stone marking the southeast end of the Anthony . base line of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. Aid Tilton reported in \Vashington on October 17.

Various preliminary arrangements were made and magnetic observations in this division were begun at Sterling by Aid Dibrell on October 29. While engaged in this work a wagon and horses were used as a means of trausportation. The stations named above were occupied and observations were made to determine the elements of terrestrial magnetism. .The stations were marked with stone posts wherever it was practicable to obtain them, and with cedar posts at the other stations. On October 30, at Sterling, special declination readings were made at intervals of five minutes throughout the entire day, and the temperature read and recorded at intervals of fifteen minutes, seventy-fifth meridian time being used. These observations were made by other magnetic parties in different parts of the country in execution of a plan to determine the areas over which the diurnal variation of the declination is the same. The work in this division was closed on the 16th of November.

A new edition of the Coast Pilot for California, Oregon, and Washington being necessary, Nautical Expert Ford left \\'ashington on December 20, under instructious to proceed to the western coast for the purpose of collecting the information required for the work of revision. "Assistant Dickins, commanding the steamer GedneJ', was directed to take Mr. Ford on board and afford him all necessary assistance in his work. While waiting for the Gedney to sail, information was collected in San Francisco. Mr. Ford reported on board the GednCJ' on January 16, and on the 28th the vessel sailed from San Francisco f01 a cruise to the southward to verify the sailing directions and Coast Pilot notes prepared in advance, covering the coast from San Francisco to the Mexican boundary. The ports south of San Francisco were visited, new wharves were located, and all necessary information was collected. The Gedney returned to San Francisco on March 9, having completed the necessary work south of that port. After returning to San Francisco, Mr. Ford was engaged for 50me time in c6mpleting the compilation of the notes made in the field. On May 16 he was detached from the Gedney, and established headquarters in San Francisco and prepared to take up the work on the coast north of that port, using local transportation as the best available means of obtaining the desired information. From May 25 to June 30 the necessary verification of data relating .to the coast between San Francisco and Trinidad Head was completed, except for a small part of minor importance immediately to the northward of Point Reyes. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

Portland, Oreg., on the 20th, where he organized a party and made all necessary preparations for the season's work. The party left Portland on the 22d and proceeded to Camas, Wash., where camp was pitched and active field operations began immediately. Signals for use in the hydrographic work were erected and soundings were made until May 9, when an unfinished sheet of the previous season was completed. Assistant Latham reported on April 30 and was assigned immediately to active duty. On May 9 the river was already high and rising rapidly to the regular flood stage caused by melting snow in the mountains, and consequently the hydrography had to be suspended and no topography could be clone. Stations were selected for triangulation points and at five of these the necessary observations were_ made. On June 8 the party moved to Prindle's Landing, where the camp was pitched and the work of reconnaissance was. resumed. By June 27 the scheme had been developed as far as Bonneville, 4 miles below the Cascade Locks. Three stations were occupied and observations were in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

SINCLAIR.

In accordance with the request of the Sec:retary of State. the Secretary of the Treasury a11d the Secretary of the Interior assigned to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Director of the Geological Survey the duty of making a reconnaissance along the forty-n,nth parallel, and especially from the Rocky Mountains to the westward. These officers received more specific instructions from the Secretary of State, and with his approval detailed officers of theii: bureaus . to. carry· out the reconnaissance. The following statement deals only with the work executed by Assistant Sinclair and the party under his direction, except as stated in the paragraph referring to the opening of the vista. During February, March, and April ASbistant Sinclair made an examination of the records and other material relating to the northwest boundary of the United States, on file in the State Department and deposited in the Congressional Library. He also prepared a list of stars for latitude observations covering twenty-four hours of time, and made all necessary preparations that could be made in Washington for taking up an examination of the northwest boundary for the purpose of recovering the monuments established by the International Commission and making the· desired reconnaissance. The principal work assigned Assistant Sinclair was the reoccupation of such old astronomic stations as could be found and the determination of such new stations as might be found desirable to establish. He left Washington accompanied by Assistant H.F. Flynn, as a member of his party, on May 7, and proceeded to Seattle, Wash., where the preparations for the season's work were completed and a party was organized. The party left Seattle on May 16 and proceeded by way of New Whatcom and Sumas to Chilliwack, British Columbia. A pack train was secured and the party started on May 22 over 12 miles of road and 20 miles of trail to the boundary observation station of 1859 on Silicia Creek, near which a number of mining claims had been located. The trail was in very bad condition from constant rains and lack of repairs and was traversed with difficulty. Several of the animals rolled down steep slopes, but fortunately without serious damage to themselves or their packs. The astronomic station was recovered and observations made which identified it beyond question. From this station the distance stated in the old field notes was measured and the adjacent mark on the boundary was recovered. Rain and clouds seriously retarded the work and satis- · factory observations were not obtained before June 15. The constant rains also retarded the work of clearing the vista along the line to such an extent that comparatively little was aL-complished. It was desirable to extend the vista from this boundary mark in both directions to the adjacent marks, but the summits of the mountains in the vicinity were covered with deep snow and it was impracticahle to do so at this season of ~he year.

There were no trails open to the points east and west in June. but a party of Canadian surveyors were reported working their way along the Chilliwack River toward Chilliwack Lake. A line was cut through the heavy timber 4 ooo feet west and 6 ooo feet east of the starting point by the conjoint parties, and four wrought-iron posts were placed in position to indicate the random line forming the axis of the vista opened by cutting the timber. These posts are 4 feet long and 3Yz inches in diameter with a flange 10 inches wide at the bottom. Each post has a bronze" cap with two lines and the figures'" 1901 " cut in the top, and the intersection of these lines marks the random line. An iron post suitably marked was also established near to, and due west of, the old latitude station and a witness mark was made. on a large bowlder a short distance to the southeast of the station. The old wooden block is in bad condition and these marks were established to assist in recovering the station at any future time. On June 23 the pack train with the outfit started to Chilliwack and reached there the following day. On the 26th the party left Chilliwack by steamer and proceeded via the Columbia River and the Canadian Pacific Railway to Midway, British Columbia, arriving there on the 27th. Preparations were made to extend the work to the eastward of Midway and the work was.in progress on June 30. Assistant Sinclair calls special attention to the valuable service of Assistant Flynn and mentions in detail the work executed by him and states that his previous experience in the field and office made him particularly valuable on this expedition.

On July 1 the McArtlmr, under command of Assistant Ferdinand \Vestdahl, was at Sausalito, Cal., engaged in completing the resurvey of the bar off the entrance to San Francisco Bay. On July 14 the work was suspended for the· season on account of the prevailing fog and other unfavorable weather conditions. Only a portion of five days had been suitable for the work during the month. A more detailed account of this work is published in the Report for 1900. The vessel was taken to Oakland, where the boiler was cleaned and repaired, and other necessary repairs to the ship were made. The transfer of the new crew from the Navy pay roll to a civil establishmen.t was effected. While engaged on this work, orders were received on August 21 to proceed with the ship to Seattle, Wash. After returning from the cruise in Alaska with the Coast Pilot party, Assistant W estdahl received instructions to take up the hydrographic survey along the water front at Seattle, Wash. Active field operations began on November 12 and were completed on December 6. The 'weather was stormy, cold, and very unfavorable to rapid progress.· After obtaining the results mentioned in the above summary, the work was closed because the weather conditions indicated that thick weather and fog would prevail for a long period. The McArt!zur left Seattle on December 9 and reached San Francisco on the 15th. Various repairs were made, and the ship was ready for work on March 15. Active field operations in making supplementary surveys to complete seven hydrographic sheets of former work, covering portions of San Francisco and San Pablo bays, began on March 22 and continued until April 12, when the work"assigned to the ship was completed, and the McArthur returned to Oakland Harbor in order to complete the field records for transmission to the Office.

\V. WEINRICH, Jr., llfagnelic Observer. S. K. PAUL, Recorder.

The selection of a suitable location for a magnetic observatory to serve as a base station in the magnetic survey of Alaska was assigned to Assistant Bauer. He left Seattle, Wash., on September 12 and made a magnetic examination at Fort \Vrangel, Juneau, Skagway, and Sitka. He was at Sitka from' September 20 to-October 4, and 1irnde a thorough examination of all available sites in this vicinity, determining the magnetic elements at four stations. The observat.ions indicated that the distribution of the earth's magnetism was fairly uniform in tl1e region covered.by the stations, and it was decided to locate the observatory at Sitka. · On the return trip to Seattle he made ~gnetic observations at Dundas Bay and Killisnoo and at various stations in Gastineau Channel. He left Juneau on October 9 and reached Seattle on the 12th. In order to make such magnetic observations as circumstances permitted during a cruise of the steamer McArtlmr in Alaska with a Coast Pilot party on board, Magnetic Observer W. Weinrich, jr., reported for this duty at Seattle, Wash., on September 5, and continued the work until the end of the cruise on November 1. He made magnetic observations at Bartletts Bay, Battery Point, Chasi1ia Point, Dixon Harbor, Dolomite, Juneau Isle, Carta Bay, Killisnoo, Ketchikan, McLean Arm, Port Chester, Port Snettisham, Skawl Point, Sitka, Spasskaia Island, and 'William Henry Bay. He also aided in the determination of the amount and direction of the unusual local disturbance of the con1pass existing in Peril Strait, Lynn Canal, near Bat· tery Point, in Gastineau Channel, and at Port Snettisham. Magnetic observations were also made at Comox, British Columbia. Daily (except Sunday) declination readings at Sitka were made by Recorder Paul from 7 a. m. to 3 p. m.

For the purpose of locating a magnetic observatory at Sitka, Alaska, and making arrangements for the erection of the necessary buildings Aid Fleming proceeded to that place in May. He reached Sitka on June 1, and remained there until the close of the fiscal year. A final selection of the observatory site, and bids for the construction of the observatory were obtained from Seattle, Juneau, Skagway, and Sitka. Estimates of the cost of labor and material were also obtained. · The selection of the observatory site involved the examination of five proposed building sites. Special magnetic observations were made to determine the local disturb.ance, if any, and also to determine the effect of iron ships anchoring in the harbor or lying at the wharf. The necessary preliminary work was completed during the month.

SUMMARY 01' RESUI,TS.

Fox lsla11d Cmup.
25 triangulation stations established. 1 base line measured. 45 square miles area covered by triangulation. 15 triangulation stations occupied. 27 square miles area surveyed by topography. 42 miles general coast line surveyed. 979 soundings made (not plotted June 30 ). 4 tide stations established.

On July r the steamer Patil.finder, under command of J. J. Gilbert, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was at St. Michael; Alaska, engaged in preparation for the season's work. The small steamer Yukon and two launches which had been hault:cl out of the water at this place in the preceding year were launched. On the evening of July 4 a party was sent in a launch to place buoys in the approach to the Apoon entrance to the Yukon River, and on the 6th the work of constructing signals began. Having recently arrived from Nome, against which a quarantine had been established, the vessel was required to remain at the quarantine station fourteen days or keep away from St. Michael during that period. The latter alternative was adopted, and the topographic work began near Toik station instead of in St. Michael Bay. Signals were erected and observations began in all branches of the work, every effort being made to accomplish as much as possible during the short season available ·for the work. Assistant Flynn returned on the r 4th of July, after successfully placing bttoys to mark the Apoon entrance to the Yukon River. His work was much delayed by the launch breaking down and the difficulty of covering the long distance traveled in safety. The Yukon, with the necessary complement of men, was assigned to Assistant Flynn, and he was put in charge of the triangulation work. He occupied 24 stations, most of which were difficult of access, and connected the triangulation at St. Michael with that of Golofnin Bay. It was evident that in order to complete the survey of the shoreline between St. Michael and Golofnin Bay and of Golofnin Sound in one short season, the usual method of executing such work would have to be abandoned and a more expeditious one adopted. It was decided to proceed without waiting for geographic positions, to dispense with projections, and to nm the shoreline as carefully as these conditions permitted, using sufficient ·expedition to accomplish the work as outlined above, and to adjust the topographic work to the triangulation when the positions became available. All the shore line was run by Assistant Gilbert and Aid Frisby, working from the ship to a point a short distance beyond Cape Denbigh, when the work proved to be too far away from the ship's anchorage and it becan1e necessary to use a tent. Watch Officer Fitzgerald was placed in charge of the hydrographic work. Owing to the great distance to be covered, it was decided not to extend the hydrography beyond the 6-fathom curve, except on a few lines to verify the soundings shown on the charts beyond that depth. ·

GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1901.

At the close of the season, while waiting to haul out the Yukon, a more careful survey of the harbor at St. Michael was completed, and a special effort was made to locate a sunken scow, but without success. The survey of Golofnin Sound pro\'ed that it is not more than one-third of the size shown on the published chart, in use at the time, and that more than half of it is too shallow to be used except by small craft. After completing the work the vessel returned to St. Michael for the purpose of housing and storing all the boats and other property. Owing to unfavorable weather, this work was not completed until September 2 l. On the 22d the ship went to Egg Island and made a topographic survey of it on the 24th. On the 25th soundings were made between Egg Island and Cape Darby. All the members of the U. S. Geological Survey party, who were to return on the Patlzjindcr, were on board by September 28, and the vessel started to Dutch Harbor during the night. · The vessel reached Dutch Harbor on October 2, was delayed three days coaling, sailed for San Fran~isco on October 5, and arrived at that place on October 14. The Patlifinder remained in San Francisco Harbor until April 18, and on that day sailed for Seattle. The vessel stopped at Port Stanley and the Government property stored there was examined and disposed of, the useless articles being sold at public auction and the remaining property taken on board and carried to Seattle for storage or shipment to \Vashington. The vessel reached Seattle on the 25th and remained there until May 2, when she sailed for Alaska, stopping for coal at Comox, British Columbia, and at Victoria, British Columbia, where a "submarine sentry" was purchased. Attention was called to this. useful device by Captain \Velbron of the steamer Quadra, who referred to its value in exploring unknown waters and strongly recommended it as a safeguard in such work as the vessel would have to do during the season. Assistant Gilbert was enabled to purchase the device through the good will of the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company, the owners. The voyage north was a stormy one, but was attended by no greater disaster than the loss of one of the boat booms, which was washed away, and the vessel anchored in Dutch Harbor on May 16. The work was at once begun by the erection of an automatic tide gauge. The great obstacle to work of any kind in this vicinity is the constant fog which covers all the hills the greater portion of the time, and never disappears entirely at this season. The line Flat to Grove was used as a base for work in Unalaska Bay and a base line was measured in English Bay and the triangulation extended to the passes. An examination was then made as far east as Ugamuk Island, and a number of signals were built to be used in extending the triangulation through the channel between the Tagalda groups of islands and Akutan and Akur Islands. This channel was examined with the sentry and found to be free from dangers. The observation of angles and topographic work was continued whenever the weather permitted. Tide gauges were erected around Unalaska Island and tide observations were made. The shores of the island are extremely interesting, the many picturesque bays, the remarkable cliffs and bluffs of basalt, and the hundreds of outlying rocks, large and

sma'n, and of all shapes, the snow-capped mountains now and then showing through the clouds, and the continual succession of waterfalls, all contribute to impress the visitor. The ''submarine sentry" proved to be very valuable. The device is set to give warning when any required depth is reached, and when the vessel passes over a spot with that depth of water on it, the sentry bell rings and a ''kite'' is tripped and comes to the surface, thus giving warning in time to steer away from danger. The "sentry" is reliable for any depth up to 25 fathoms with one ''kite'' and 40 fathoms with the other, and it is also provided with a tube for sounding in same manner as with the Kelvin machine. This region offers few facilities for camping along the shore on account of the difficulties of moving, as it is not possible to land except in sheltered places and most of the work was necessarily done from the vessel. Assi~.. ant Gilbert reports that Assistant Yates, in addition to other duties, performed those of executive officer in a very satisfactory manner, and the other officers were equally attentive and efficient in their positions. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

GRAVES.

A new edition of the United States Coast Pilot, Pacific Coast, Alaska, having become necessary, Nautical Expert Graves was assigned to the work, and on July r, 1900, was on board the U. S. Light-House Tender Columbine in Alaskan waters collecting the material needed for the revision of the former edition. Mr. E. H. Francis, the well-known pilot for Alaskan waters, was associated with Mr. Graves in this work. · The Columbine left Sitka on July 6 for Unalaska on light-house inspection work and visited the Fox Island passes and Unalaska Bay. A pilot from Unalaska was on board while the vessel was cmising in the Fox Island passes. Advantage was taken of every available opportunity to acquire personal knowledge, and copious notes were made of information useful to mariners. The Columbine returned to Sitka on July 24 and sailed on the 27th for buoy and inspection work in southeast Alaska. The route included all of th·e important channels of commerce. The weather was exceptionally good and the runs were nearly all made in daylight. The Coast Pilot information is practically complete for the principa~ channels where the surveys are good. Commander W. P. Day, U.S. N., and Capt. William C. Langfitt, U. S. A., the Light-House Inspectors, ai1d Captain Richardson and the officers of the Columbine kindly aided in the work to the extent permitted by their regular duties. The Columbine reached Seattle on August 15, and Messrs Graves and Francis left the vessel and reported at the suboffice. They were occupied with office work in connection with their work in the field until September 2, when they reported on board the steamer McArthur in accordance with it1structions dated August 22. The llfcArthur sailed on the 6th for Coast Pilot duty in Alaska, being used as a transport for Messrs Graves and Francis. On this trip the ship steamed ~ 600 nautical miles and visited 87 harbors and anchorages in southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. The weather was generally good until October 6, but after that date it was quite the reverse until November r, when the voyage ended at Seattle. Coast Pilot notes were made on all the waters visited, and numerous photographs and sketches were made. As much information was collected as the conditions permitted without unduly delaying the voyage. Mr. Graves left the ship on November 7 and Mr. Francis on November 1 1.

On July 1 the steamer Patterson, commanded by J. F. Pratt, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was making the voyage to Nome, Alaska,'and reached that place on July 6. Mr. E. C. Barnard, Topographer, U. S. Geological Survey, and his three assistants, had been authorized to take passage on the Patterson, in the wardroom, from Seattle to Nome, Alaska, and the eleven hands belonging to his party were carried in the forecastle. A portion of the supplies and outfit for this party was landed at the United States Army post on Nome River. The party and the remainder of their outfit, and nearly all the remaining portion of their supplies, were landed at Chignick, Golofnin Bay. At Mr. Barnard's request a small portion of their supplies was kept on board to be delivered to the party later in the season at Port Clarence. During the season forage for the party was taken from the army post at Nome and landed at Quartz Creek, in the vicinity of Cape Rodney. In addition to carrying out his instructions in regard to transporting this party and outfit, Assistant Pratt furnished them with a spare ship's cutter and during the season supplied them with all the information and data in his hands which they needed to facilitate the work of the survey Mr. Barnard was making. The survey work of the season began on July 9, when the triangulation of Golofnin Bay was taken up. It was extended across the high peninsula on the west side of the bay and then westward along the coast. The hydrographic and topographic work progressed at the same time, and an effort was made to keep each branch of the work up with the others. The season was an unusual one, and from the time the snow melted· until late in August there was no rain. The tundra became so dry that fires, starting from the camp fires kindle'.\ by the numerous prospectors in this region, spread and smoldered in all directions, and the country between Rocky Cape and Cape Nome was enveloped in s:noke the greater portion of the time for a period of five weeks. This atmospheric condition greatly delayed the progress of all classes of the work, and kept the triangulation behind all the other classes.

During the season the following triangulation work was done. A chain of figures beginning on the east side of Golofnin Bay was extended to the westward alon~ the coast to Sledge Island, a distance of about 96 miles. This work is checked by a base line about 1 mile long, measured with a steel tape on the beach between Nome and Snake rivers. The observations were made under difficult and dangerous conditions, as it was necessary for the observing party to land every day through the surf on an outside unprotected coast. Another scheme of triangulation starts from a base line, measured with a steel tape near the Teller reindeer station in the northeast corner of Port Clarence, and covers all of Port Clarence, Grantley Harbor, Imurook Passage, and Imurook Basin, forming a continuous chain 58 miles in length. The triangulation work was done by Aids Derickson and Rhodes. The topography was taken up at the point where work was suspended at the close of the season in the previous year, just inside Rocky Cape, Golofnin Bay, and extended westward to Sledge Island, and a survey of this island was also made. This work was also executed under extremely dangerous conditions, as it was necessary for the topographic party to land through the surf on the outside unprotected coast under many unfavorable weather conditions. A topographic survey of Port Clarence, Grantley Harbor, Imurook Passage, and Inmrook Basin was made. The topographic work was done by Assistant R. L. Faris . .The hydrographic work was extended along the coast covered by the triangulation and topography . . That portion between Golofnin Bay and Sledge Island is called the " Gold Coast," along which the landing of stores and provisions has been made at short intervals. A careful hydrographic survey wa!; made of the coast between Rocky Cape and Sledge Island, from just outsi~le the breakers out to a depth of from 5 to 7 fathoms of water, covering the ground with lines normal to the coast and about one-half mile apart. The steam launches were used on this work and lines normal to the coast were sounded by using the ship out to the limits of the hydrographic sheets at intervals of about 2 76. miles. At inter\ als of 5 miles the lines of soundings extended to a distance of 25 to 30 miles offshore. It was evident that a change had occurred in the entrance to Port Clarence, and consequently a careful survey was made ancl plotted on a large scale. Diligent search was made for the shoal reported to be about 8 miles west of Cape Nome, and 173 miles offshore, but it was not discovered. All of the hydrographic \Vork resulting from the use of the launches and boats was done by Messrs. Appleton, Eisler, Furman, and Giacomini. A self-registering tide gauge was erected at Tapkok, behind the rocky projection at the southeast corner of the headland, at the United States Army post at Nome, at Sledge Island, and at Cape Riley, Port Clarence. The record obtained by using the gauges was supplemented by two tide staffs erected near the camps, from which all the survey \\'Ork was done in Imurook Basin. · The- work in Port Clarence and Grantley Harbor was done in the tempestuous weather of early winter. Imurook Basin was about 25 miles from the nearest anchorage for the ship, too far to make the survey from the ship, and consequently rough camps were established.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

157

In referring to the officers under his command, Assistant Pratt's report contains the following:
The triangulation was executed hy Messrs Derickson and Rhodes, ai<ls, and it becomes my agreeable duty to call attention to the persistent and painstaking manner in which they did their work aml the excellent manner in which they handled their boat' crews. Successful surf landing under almost all weather conditions brings to light the good judgment am! capacity of the young officer to handle men, and I have the pleasure of stating that both of these young gentlemen clemonstrated their possession of these qualifications far above the average. Too much credit can not be given them for the hard and ha7.ardous duty that they have so successfully performed. I especially desire to c,all attention to the topographic work of Assistant Faris on account of its comprehensiveness and the great rapidity with which it was executed, and also to the unusual capacity he possesses for the execution of all the different classes of the field work of the Sur\.ey, and to the excellent judgment that he has displayed in handling work, officers, and crew. Assistant Faris was constituted official and responsible navigator of the ship, and perfonned this work with unusual promptness and precision. It is with pleasure that I have to report that all the watch officers, chief engineer, yeoman, surgeon, and draftsman were always more than willing to take hold, irrespective of what or how disagreeable the duties might be, whenever their services could be made available.

The survey of Icy Strait and Cross Sound was assigned to Assistant J. F. Pratt, commanding the steamer Patterson. He completed all necessary preparations and sailed from Seattle, Wash., May r 6, under instructions to proceed to southeast Alaska and take up the work. Assistant E. F. Dickins, commanding the steamer Gedney, was also assigned to this work under Assistant Pratt's direction, but he was delayed in San Francisco and Seattle securing bids 'or a new boiler for his vessel and did not report at Bartlett Bay until June 25. The details of the work of the Gedney are stated elsewhere in the extract from the report of Assistant Dickins. On May 18 coal was taken on board the Patterson at Union Bay, British Columbia, and the vessel then proceeded to Sitka, via Juneau, and reached that place on May 26. ·The steamer Cosmos was put in ~rder and launclied, and on May 30 the Patterson started to the field of work with the Cosmos in tow. A hurried reconnaissance was made of Icy Strait as far west as Bartlett Bay before sending Pilot E. H. Francis back to Seattle to bring up the steamer Gedney. On June 1 the Patterson took Pilot Francis to Juneau, and returned to the field of work on June 3. Assistant Derickson was placed in command of the Cosmos, and made observations at triangulation points which it was inipracticable to reach fro·m the Patterson. The triangulation points at the eastern entrance to Icy Strait could not be found, and the line Don to Calm, on the eastern side of Chatham Strait, was used as a base from which to extend the work. From this base the reconnaissance was carried as far west as Dundas Bay, and the triangulation was completed as far west as Glacier Bay. Whenever practicable, magnetic observations were made at the triangulation points with a compass declinometer. Self-registering tide gauges were est:iblished at Funter Bay and Hooniah, for the purpose of transferring the plane of reference for soundings to·Hooniah. When the report closed only three anchorages-Swansons Harbor, Hooniah, and the head of Port Althorp-had been found free from ic;ebergs. Three others had been utilized-Bartlett Bay, Mud Bay, a,nd Dundas Bay-into which large icebergs floated.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

The currents were very much stronger than anticipated, and in the anchorages ranged from slack water to 2 ~ knots. The ice varied in size from small float ice to bergs which grounded in 30 fathoms of water, and rendered the anchorages dangerous when the icebergs could approach the vessel with a 2-knot current. In Mud Bay the vessel was anchored in 9 fathoms of water, and pieces of ice grounded about one-quarter of a mile outside the vessel. The strong ebb and flood currents running 4 to 5 knots collect the ice and mass it across the passages, at times completely blocking them. The narrow passages are full of swirls and eddies, and it was dangerous to use them. In going through the passage to the north and west of Lemesurier Island one night in order to anchor in Bartlett Bay, a windrow of ice in one of these swii:-ls was encountered, and a large piece struck the stem of the Patterson and carried off sideways the upper part of her cutwater. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

J.

H. ROBINSON, Engineer.

295 square miles· area covered by triangulation. 90 triangulation stations occupied. 86 geographic positions determined. 35 elevations determined by vertical angles. 125 miles general shore line surveyed.

The survey of Prince William Sound was in active progress on July I, with Assistant Ritter in charge of the work. The work continued without interruption until the close of the season, October ro. The party left Orea 011 the following day and reached San Francisco on October 25. The following statement refers to the whole season, while the statistics given above cover only that part of the work completed after July 1, the statistics covering the first part of the season having been included in the Report for 1900. The work of the season consisted of triangulation, hydrography, and shore-line topography, including the location of prominent mountain peaks and the determination of their elevation. A base line was measured with a steel tape line at the western end of Hawkins Island, for the purpose of checking the triangulation already completed and to serve as a base for the work in progress.

COAST A:;o.;D GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, rgor.

Astronomic observations to determine the azimuth of a line were made at Orea. Magnetic observations to determine the declination were made at Orea and at stations 10 and 30 miles west of Orea. Photographs for general and topographic use, and the usual tide and meteorologic observations were made. The triangulation was extended from the head of Cordova Bay to Point Johnstone, the north point of Hinchinbrook Island. It was connected with the triangulation of 1899 at Orea and at Station Pond, which is near the check base line. On a few days, when the clouds did not obs1;ure the mountains, observations of horizontal and vertical angles were made on them. All the observations of angles were made by Aid Denson. The areas sounded during the season comprised Hawkins Island cut-off from the eastern end, where it joins the work of the previous season, to the northwestern extremity where it connects with Prince \Villiam Sound. The so-called Middle Ground Shoal was developed. This shoal extends from Makaka Point on the east, in a westerly direction toward Point Johnstone, and in a northerly direction toward Gravina Bay. From Makaka Point sounding lines were run embracing the area to the eastward as far as the eastern end and head of Sheep Bay. The hydrography of the upper end of Cordova Bay, joining and extending the work executed in 1897 by the U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross, was developed. The topographic work consisted mainly in delineating, by using a plane table, the shore line, the rocks, and the adjacent topography. The localities thus mapped included the western end of Hawkins Island cut-off, the south sbore of Prince \Villiam Sound from a point 5 miles west of Salmo Point to Point Johnstone, and the north shore of the sound in the vicinity of Sheep Bay. Thirteen stations were occupied with a _phototopographic camera, most of these being triangulation stations. The survey of Prince William Sound was continued in April by Assistant Ritter and his party. He arrived at Orea on April 1 r, and field operations began immediately. It was decided to extend the triangulation from the line Makaka to Point Johnstone, as a base, north\vard and then along the eastern shore of the sound, using stations on the main land and adjacent islands. The camp was set up at Snug Corner Cove, a sheltered harbor at the southwestern extremity of Port Fidalgo, 20 miles from Point Johnstone and 45 miles from Orea. From this camp the work was completed south to the base line and 15 miles to the northward. On June 7 the camp was moved to the mouth of Jacks Bay, on the south shore of Valdez Arm, 18 miles from Valdez, and the triangulation was completed to Jacks Bay at the end of the fiscal year. In selecting the stations care was exercised in placing them in such positions that future extensions of the work will be comparatively easy at the points where such extensions will be necessary. Auxiliary positions were determined wherever they were necessary to control the shore line topography. In Galena and Jacks Bay, the angles in. the subsidiary triangulation were measured by using a sextant. The position of each prominent and characteristk· mountain peak visible from two or more triangulation stations was determined and the elevation obtained by measuring vertical angles. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

On August 2 r, Assistant Ferdinand \Vestdahl, commanding the steamer llfcArthur, received instruction to proceed with the vessel to Seattle, Wash., for the purpose of conveying H. C. Graves, nautical expert, and E. H. Francis, Alaska pilot, to Alaska and along the southeastern coast to enable Mr. Graves to collect the data required in a revision of the Coast Pilot covering this region. All the necessary preparations were made and the vessel left San Francisco on August 28. The McArthur reached Seattle on September r, and Messrs. Graves and Francis came on board on the following day. Mr. William Weinrich, jr., magnetic observer, came on board on September 5. The vessel left Seattle on September 6 and went to Union Bay, near Comox, British Columbia, where a supply of coal was taken on board, and on September 8 sailed for southeastern Alaska. On this cruise the ship steamed 3; 600 1iautical miles and visited 87 harbors and anchorages in southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. The weather was generally good until October 6, but after that date it was quite · the reverse until the voyage ended at Seattle, \Vash., on No,·emb"er r. The vessel on this cruise was used exclusively as a transport for the Coast Pilot party, and the work accomplished will he reported in detail by Mr. Graves, Nautical Expert. All possible assistance was extended to him and the ship was practically under his orders during the cruise. S. Doc. 5 0 - r r 161

Messrs Graves ai1d \Veinrich left the ship on November 7 and Mr. Francis on November 1 r, and the vessel afterwards proceeded to San Francisco and was engaged in supplemental survey work in the bay. Preparations for work in Alaska were completed, and the steamer JlfcArtliur, F. \Vestdahl, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding, left San Francisco on May 4 and reached Seattle on the 9th. The steamer Patterson was almost ready to sail for Alaska with a pilot on board and the 1JfcArt/mr waited to follow her. Both ships sailed on the 16th at\d reached Jun.eau, Alaska, on May 23, having taken on coal at Union Bay, British Columbia. The 1JfcArtliur filled her coal bunkers again and both ships proceeded to Punter Bay on the 25th and anchored for the night. On the following day the ships separated, and the JlfcArtlmr passed through Icy Strait and Cross Sound to the Pacific Ocean. A good deal of floating ice was encountered and the· land was covered with snow to the water's edge. The ship reached Kodiak on the 29th and replenished the supply of coal and water and engaged Paul W. Pavlof as pilot. The waters to be' sun·eyed were not familiar to the officers of the ship and were said to contain many dangerous rocks. The ship proceeded to the working ground and reached there on June 6, after a very stormy passage, being forced to seek shelter several times and to remain in Knprianof Harbor for two days. Field operations began on June 7 and continued until the end of the fiscal year, but very little work was accomplished. A reconnaissance was made and nineteen triangulation stations were selected. A base line was measured and lumber was landed through the surf for the erection of signals. Only one triangulation station was occupied. The weather continued stormy, and most of the time was spent in lookii1g after the safety of the ship, as many of the anchorages were roadsteads without much protection. On June 13 it was necessary to proceed to Dutch Harbor for coal. \Vhile at that port an unsuccessful effort was made to observe for a time at the astronomic station. A comparison of the ship's chronometers was made with those on the steamer Pat!ifinder and also with those on the U. S. Army transport Warren. The ilfcArtlmr left Dutch Harbor on June 19 and anchored in Acherk Harbor ·on the following day. · The erection of signals continued whenever the weather conditions permitted. The field of work was a difficult one with no safe harbors near, and no anchorages were available where the ship was not liable to exposure to danger at any time from a sudden · change in the direction of the wind. Safety in the open sea could not be considered on account of the dangerous rocks in the area off the coast and the prevailing thick weather. The local knowledge of the pilot was very useful, but could not be wholly relied on as to the safety of the anchorages. His presence aided materially in advancing the work. Views of the land for the Coast Pilot were made whenever the conditions permitted and all other useful information collected as opportunity offered. The work was actively in progress at the close of the fiscal year. Assistant Westdahl commends Watch Officer Crowley, Second Watch Officer Lyman, and Chief Engineer Sullivan for their attention to duty and interest in their work, and mentions particularly the care with which Watch Officer Crowley prepared the accounts of the ship's expenses.

On January 31, 1901, Prof. V.l. D. Alexander took the oath of office as Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Sun"ey. For many years previous to this elate he held the office of surveyor-general of the Ha,rniian Islands, before and after the annexation of the islands by the United States. After his appointment in the Coast and Geodetic Survey he continued to supervise the preparation of a large scale map for the Territorial government and had directions of the tide observations made in the islands. He prepared a list of the geographic positions already determined on the islands, except the islands of Kauai and Niihau, reducing the latitudes and longitudes to one uniform mean standard and converting the distance from feet to meters. He also began the preparation of a dictionary of Hawaiian geographic names and performed various duties in connection with tlie transfer of records and instruments from the surveyor-general's office to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. He was engaged in performing the above duties at the close of the fiscal year.

The selection of a location for the magnedc observatory in the Hawaiian Islands to serve as a base station in the magnetic survey was assigned to Assistant Bauer, and he left San Francisco on October 17 under instructions to make the necessary examination. He examined various sites on Oahu and Hawaii Islands and selected a point on the extensive coral plain in the southwestern part of Oahu Island, near Sisal, as the best available site. He also made magnetic observations at Kahuku, \Vaialua, Honouliuli Ranch (two stations), Ewa Mill, Sisal (two stations), Honolulu, Diamond Head, Puuloa Railroad Station, and Puuloa Point (Pearl Harbor) on the island of Oahu, and at Kilauea on the island of Hawaii. He returned to San Francisco on November 29.

The schooner Eagrc, Assistant J. B. Boutelle, commanding, sailed from Baltimore on December 3 and reached San Juan, Porto Rico, on December 20. The vessel remained at San Juan until January 8, taking on coal, lumber, and stores, making repairs to the steam launch Inspector, and other necessary preparations for the season's work. The vessel left San Juan on January 8 and proceeded to Fajardo, on the east coast of Porto Rico. Signals were erected along the Cordilleras Reef and southward along the coast to Ensenada Honda, and the triangulation, topography, and hydrography in this vicinity was commeticed. The topography wa~ extended from the work of the previous year to the eastern .extremity of the Cordilleras Reef and southward to the vicinity of Cabras Island. The hydrographic work was extended from Cape San Juan Head to the Piraguas Rocks and about 6 miles to the eastward, off shore. On March 7 the vessel was moved to Ensenada Honda and the work was then extended from the above limits southward. The triangulation and topography were completed as far as Punta Yeguas, the southeast point of Porto Rico, and the hydrographic work to a line

running a iittle west of south from the outer Piraguas Rock to Vieques Island, and from the west side of Punta Arenas to Punta Cascajo, at the south side of Ensenada Honda. The weather was much more favorable than during the previous season, light southerly winds prevailing much of the time instead of the regular easterly trades; but the hydrographic work was ".ery much delayed by frequent repairs which were necessarily made to keep the boiler of the steam launch in running order. The rainy season began in the latter part of April, and after that date rain showers were of frequent occurrence. Field work closed on May 31 and the vessel proceeded to San Juan. The vessel sailed from San Juan for Baltimore on June 1 r, reaching there on the 20th, and remained there until the close of the fiscal year.

The ./11atchless was undergoing repairs at New York October 8 to November 26, when the repairs were completed. Preparations for survey work in Porto Rico were completed, and the vessel sailed on December 3 for Ponce, Porto Rico, under the command of George L. Flower, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The ./11atcliless reached that port on the 21st and field operations began immediately. A tide gauge was erected at Ponce and in Guanica Harbor, and the hydrographic survey of the harbor began on December 25. The soundings \Vere made by using a whaleboat, as no launch was available, and the party was too small to man two sounding boats. ·Much time was lost while at work on the southern coast in making trips to Ponce for water and stores, as it was the only port at which they could be obtained. The work progressed as rapidly as circumstances permitted, and the boat work was completed on January 16. The \·essel sailed .the same day for Ponce for water and stores, and then proceeded to Guayanilla Harbor and began the survey of the harbor on January 22, and the boat work was completed on February 14. This harbor possesses a fine, deep entrance. well protected, and affords a safe refuge for vessels. On February 16 work began at Tallaboa Bay, still using the whale boat for the sounding party. The bay is only partially protected by a few small islands, and the progress of the work was much retarded by rough water. The sounding work at this place was completed on March 5, and on the following day work with the schooner began off the southern coast. The water was continuaHy rough and the soundings \Vere made without waiting for smooth water. On March 26 the launch Rudy arrived at Ponce, and afterwards aided materially in advancing the work. The development of the south coast from Ratones Island to 'Point Brea out to the 28-fathom curve was completed on April 12. On the 13th the vessel sailed for the west coast, under instructions to develop the shoals and channels between Caho Rojo and 167

Mayaguez. A general reconnaissance of this portion of the coast was made, and an automatic tide gauge was established at Puerto Real, but it was impracticable to place it in charge of anyone on shore, as no one could be found with sufficient intelligence in the vicinity. The sounding work began oi1 April 23 and continued until June 4. During this time lines of soundings, normal to the shore line, averaging 400 meters apart, and extending to a point approximately 5 miles off shore, were nm between Cabo Rojo and Mayaguez, and the shoals developed.

In addition to this work a survey was made of Puerto Real. The northeast winds of the northern coast meeting the southeast winds of the southern coast made the wind of the west coast so variable that it wa£ impracticable to work with the schooner. Several attempts were made to locate the outlying shoals indicated on the chart. Some of these were found, but the rainy season was so far advanced and the coast so much hidden by rain squalls and haze that the attempts to locate them proved unsuccessful. Water and stores were procured at Mayaguez while working on the west coast. On June 6 the launch was stored at Mayaguez, and on June 8 the vessel sailed for Baltimore and reached her destination on June r 7.

The topographic survey of Vieques Island, Porto Rico, was assigned to Assistant F,orney, and he was also directed to occupy a station in the main triangulation, located on the island. Stores and supplies were obtained in New York and the party sailed for San Juan, Porto Rico, on January 5, and reached that port on January 10. It was necessary to remain in San Juan until the 17th, in order to take passage on the next steamer for Vieques Island. During this period of delay, Aid Dibrell occupied one of the triangulation stations in this vicinity and made observations to determine the magnetic elements. On the I 7th the party proceeded to Vieques Island and pitched camp on the ramparts of the old Spanish fort south of the town of Isabel Segunda. A reconnaissance of the island was made and the triangulation points established and determined by Assistant Hodgkins were recovered. Triangulation stations were occupied to complete the connection with the triangulation previously executed and to connect two light-houses, Puerto Mulos and Puerto Ferro. A plane-table triangulation was then executed, based upon the points already determined, for the purpose of determining the additional positions necessary for the topographic 'work. On the topographic sheets the heights were expressed in meters and refer to mean high water. The contour interval was fixed at 10 meters. The interior ridges and valleys were shown by form contours depending upon a topographic reconnaissance with the plane table. The Spanish names used on the plane-table sheet were obtained from Clandomino Flores, a native of Vieques Island, who acted as pilot for Admiral Sampson, U. S. N., while he was cruising in these waters during the war with Spain.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, r90r.

Some confusion of names exists in this region and the island is called '' Crab Island" on many published charts, while the inhabitants and the old inhabitants of the island of Porto Rico use the name '' Isla de Vieq ues. '' Large numbers of land crabs are found on the island and the name Crab Island probably originated from this condition. Tide observations extending over a lunar month were made at Puerto Ferro on the south coast. Magnetic observatioris were made at a station near Isabel Segunda, at Great Harbor, Culebra Island, at Ponce, and at Aibonita.

Assistant Forney expresses his appreciation of the service rendered during the season by Aid Dibrell, who joined the party well informed 011 the theory of the plane table and soon became proficient in its use in the field . Mpst of the topographic work on the island was executed by him. The work for the season closed on June 13. The camp outfit was packed, transported to San Juan, and shipped by steamer to Washington. The party started to Washington and reached New York on J une 30.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

997 square miles area covered by reconnaissance. 31 triangulation stations selected. 997 square miles area covered by triangulation. 20 triangulation stations occupied. 45 geographic positions determined. 1 base line measured.

The determination of the geographic position of Mona Light-House, Monita Island, and Desecheo Island, and the extension of the west coast triangulation to Point Borinquen and the connection of the triangulation east of Ponce along the south coast with the work which had been extended south and west from St. Thomas and Culebra islands to Point Lima, Porto Rico, and Mount Pirata, Vieques Island, were assigned to Assistant McGrath. He spent two days in New York completing his outfit, then sailed for Porto Rico on January 5 and reached San Juan on January IO. Three days were spent in San Juan, and during this time arrangements were made to obtain supplies from the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments of the Army, and information was obtained from the Light-House Department. Assistant McGrath m<i.kes special report of his cordial reception by Col. John L. Clem, chief quartermaster, U. S. A., at San Juan, and states that the Stlr\'ey is greatly indebted to him for the libenfl arrangements made by him which greatly facilitated the ..vork. The Light-House Engineer and the Inspector were both absent on duty, but the request for information was honored as fully as possible at their office. The party reached Mayaguez on January 14, and the deputy collector of customs in charge of the port, Mr. F. Cuebas, kindly passed the outfit through the custom-house without delay. Active field operations began at once and tbe position of Mona Light-House and the offshore islands was determined by occupying the triangulation points at Mariquita, Mesa, and Atalaya, which positions had been determined during the previous year. The observations at the stations named above were completed on February 3, after many delays and considerable hardship from lack of proper accommodations. In connection with the determination of the offshore islands, several mountain peaks were located and tangents were observed to coast lines of Mona, Monita, and Desecheo islands. An effort was made to occupy Desecheo Island, and with this in view a fisherman at Aguadilla who had more experience and local knowledge of the
171

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

island than anyone else on the coast was engaged to transport the party to the island whenever the proper weather conditions prevailed to make a landing possible. The triangulation was then extended from the point reached during the previous year to Point Borinquen, and all notable points between Point Rincon and Point Borinquen that were visible from the triangulation stations and which seemed to b~ of importance for geographic or topographic purposes were located. Observations for magnetic declination were made with a declinometer at three of the triangulation stations. While the work was in progress Assistant McGrath was ready at all times to respond to a summons from the fisherman at Aguadilla when the conditions for visiting Desecheo Island were favorable, and did respond to one call, but found upon arrival that an interval of two hours had so changed the conditions as to make the trip hopeless. After completing the triangulation to Point Borinquen, and having no immediate prospect of securing the proper weather conditions, the plan of occupying Desecheo Island was abandoned. Several of the signals at triangulation points on the west coas.t were found undisturbed. The respect with which the signals and station marks on this coast are treated by the native population is very satisfactory, and is in keeping with the consideration and courtesy shown the party in all their relations with these people. When the work on the west coast was completed the party proceeded to Guayamas, and reached there on March 8.

DETAILS OF FIELD OPERATIONS.

A reconnaissance of the coast was made, and the line Corazon to Point Figuras Light-House was selected as the base from which to extend the work. The necessary observations to extend the triangulation to Point Lima and complete the work assigned to the party were finished on May 3. It was not necessary to use lamps as signals except at stations Guayanes, Candelero, and Lima, where they were necessary in observing from ~fount Pirata, which station was occupied by Assistant Forney in conne9tion with his topographic survey of Vieques Island. The work was delayed by the lack of accommodation, the very inferior facilities for transportation, the poor roads, and the necessity of using trails where there were no roads. Assistant McGrath makes special mention of his aid, Thomas ~elson Page, jr., who proved to be a faithful, earnest, diligent, and ambitious worker, and showed a most gratifying interest in his duties. After completing the work the party proceeded to San Juan, and sailed for New York on May 14. Assistant McGra~h reached Washington on May 22 and reported in person at the Office.

' 7 topographic sheets completer!. 5 magnetic <;tations occupiccl.

The triangulation, topographic, and magnetic work on the northwest coast of Porto Rico was assigned to Assistant Nelson. He spent three days in New York purchasing supplies and outfit and then proceeded, on January 5, to San Juan, P. R., and reached that port on January ro. · A party was immediately organized and field work began without delay. The triangulation points from which it was necessary to extend the work to t11e westward were not conveniently located, and much time was spent in making a reconnaissance and clearing the lines. Observations in all three branches of the work began on January 22, and steady progress was made until the close of the season. The party moved from San Juan to Toa Baja, about 20 miles to the westward, on January 28. The lack of roads and bridges and the primitive methods of transportation greatly retarded the work throughout the season. Fortunately the railroad extends from San Juan 60 miles along the coast to the westward, and this made it possible to complete the work to a junction with that of the previous season, at Point Jiguero. The roads are simply bull-cart tracks and trails all the way from San Juan to Aguadilla and even to Anasco. A few pieces of road were begun between Arecibo and Utuada and between Manati and Ciales, but never completed, and landslides have since occurred which have rendered these roads practically useless. The party moved to Vega Baja on February 28, to the Ma1;ati River on March 14, to Arecibo light-house on April 4, and to Amador plantation, near Camuy, on April 27. The railroad ends at Camuy, and the road to the westward hardly deserves the name at any time, and becomes almost impassable in the rainy season. It was over this road that the last move was 11iade to Aguadilla, a distance of 26 miles, when, with the assistance of ten bull carts and a relay of bulls and drivers at the Fortuna plantation, about the middle point, the trip was made in ~wenty-six hours.

The reconnaissance and triangulation preceded the topography, and numerous obstacles had to be overcome, and at all interior points it was necessary to cut lines in 8.ll directions. The difficulties in the way of triangulation increased as the work progressed to the west, and Borinqucn Light-House and Aguadilla were so unfavorably located that it was almost impossible to make a connection with them from the east. The plane-table work began near the eastern entrance to San Juan Harbor, and was extended to Point Jiguero, on the west coast, where it joined the work executed during the previous season. This was accomplished with comparative ease, as the coast line consists largely of sand beach, with intervening cliffs and bluffs of soft limestone not over 50 or 60 feet high. There are numerous outlying rocks of small size in places, and along the beach sand dunes ranging from 10 to 30 feet in height were found, which were difficult to represent on the topographic sheet. Aguadilla Bay is an open arm of the sea, and vessels can approach to about one-quarter of a mile of shore. The Arecibo anchorage is only suitable for small craft. The swell and surf are heavy at all seasons of the year. In fact. the surf is so strong on the entire northern coast that it is dangerous for small boats to laud except behind Point Salinas and at one other point u,ear Camuy. The bar across the mouth of the Rio Grande de Arecibo pre\·ents anything but lighters and rowboats from going in or out. The Rio Plata is the first river west of Sau Juan, and is the largest and longest on the island. It is very turbulent and treacherous during the rainy season. There are two small towns, ToaiBaja and Dorado, near its mouth. There are no bridges over this river except the railroad bridge, and it is not possible to cross over this with animals. The Manati is the next river of importance, and is considered the most dangerous on the island. The partially completed railroad bridge was the only one over the river, and it was necessary to use the ferry in crossing. \Vhile in camp near this river in March, a hurricane visited this portion of the island and lasted about ten hours. The camp was in danger of being washed away, as the water rose r 5 feet in six hours, but fortunately only one tent was lost, though the party was cut off from field work_f.or two days. The mouth of the Rio Grande at Arecibo is about half a mile wide at high water, but at low water is bare except the channel, which changes with every rain as the water pours down out of the mountain gorges. Sugar plantations extend along the valleys of all these rivers, and also for some distance along the coast; at intervals, from Bayamon to Camuy River. The country from Camuy west consists of irregular ridges heavily covered with brush, and in many places with cocoanut trees, royal palms, mangoes. coffee, and banana trees. Magnetic observations were made at the following places: Fraile, Baja, Amador, Point Caracoles, and Aguadilla. Assistant Nelson makes special mention of the kindness and aid extended to him by Col. John L. Clem, chief quartermaster, U.S. A., at San Juan, in furnishing forage and transportation and in facilitating the work to the extent of his ability. The rainy season began about April 15, and after that date there was rain every afternoon. In spite of every obstacle, such as those mentioned above and others equally as troublesome and difficult to O\'ercome, the work was pushed steadily forward to completion and a junction was effected in June. On June 19 Assistant Nelson sailed with the officers of his party from San Juan for New York, and reported in person on the 25th at the Office in Washington.

FRANK \VALLEY PERKINS.

As stated in the Report for 1900, Assistant Perkins was at Manila, P. I., on July engaged in the investigation of the existing conditions relating to surveys and in collecting information as to the future needs of the Philippine Islands. Several interesting communications were submitted by him containing important information upon which to base the plans for the future survey the islands, as demanded by the necessities of the situation. An abstract from his reports is given in the Report for 1900, under the heading "Special duty." On July 15 he sailed for the United States on the U. S. transport Sherman, via Nagasaki, Japan, and arrived in San Francisco, Cal., on August 6. He was detained on duty in San Francisco until August 16, when he started to Washington and reported for duty at the Office on August 28.

The inauguration of the survey of the Philippine Islands and the establishment of a suboffice in Manila, P. I., was assigned to Assistant Putnam. After making all necessary preparations in Washington and San Francisco, he sailed from San Francisco for Manila, P. I., on November 16, and reached his destination on December 15. Two assistants, Edmonds and Denson, one aid, Rhodes, and five recorders, Morford, Hill, Pixley, Colt, and Bernhardt, accompanied him as members of his party. H. C. Mitchell, aid, and \Villiams \Velch, draftsman, sailed at a later date and reached Manila on December 3 1. .· The additional members of the party mentioned above were employed at various dates between January 14 and March 22, as their services became necessary and suitable men could be found. General instructions were given Assistant Putnam to make all necessary arrangements for the inauguration of a survey of the coasts of the Philippine Islands. A suboffice was established at Manila as headquarters from which the work of surveying the coast could be managed and a place where all data could be collated for the preparation and publication of preliminary results, when such publication would be of immediate benefit to commerce and navigation. · Assistant Putnam presented his credentials promptly to the Commanding General and as soon as practicable called on the President and members of the Philippine Commission, on the Admiral of the Fleet, and on the officers of the Military Government. The requests that it was necessary to make were granted, receiving such consideration as could be expected in view of the disturbed condition of the country. The Survey is especially indebted for assistance in its work to the Unitecf States Philippine Commission, the Adjutant-General, Ghief Quartermaster, Chief Signal Officer, Chief Engineer Officer, Chief Commissary, Depot Quartermaster, Captain of the Port, and other officers of the Division of the Philippines, as well as to the officers of the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company and to the managing director of the Campafiia Maritima. Messrs. Edmonds, Denson, Rhodes, Mitchell, Morford, and Hill were assigned to the charge of parties in the field away from Manha during the year by Assistant Putnam, and he remained at Manila in charge of the suboffice and executed such field work in the vicinity as was found to be desirable and practicable. The field work was considerably retarded by lack of transportation facilities about the islands, by the condition of the telegraph lines, by the lack of suitable boats for hydrographic work, and, toward the close of the year, by unfavorable weather. No difficulty was experienced on account of the insurgents, though Batangas was fired upon while a party was at work in the town. At two places a party lived in towns not garrisoned. The work was delayed only to a slight extent by sickness, as the general health of the ·party was good. The plan of work followed comprised the determination of geographic positions and the making of detached harbor surveys. This plan was demanded by the existing conditions and the small force and the limited equipment available for t_he work. Great difficulty was experienced in obtaining suitable boats for hydrographic work

and at one important place no boat could be obtained for this work. The native boats are long and slender, with wide bamboo outriggers, and can llOt be used for hydrographic work. All the field parties received great assistance from the commanding officers of military posts and other military and civil officers. The following is ·a condensed statement of .the work accomplished by the various parties before the end of the fiscal year. The statement of the work executed is presented in this form as a matter of convenience. The officers on duty under Assistant Putnam's direction were placed in charge of parties by him and were entirely dependent on their own ability and resources in carrying out the instructions for the work assigne_d to them as chiefs of parties.

LATITUDES BY ZENITH TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS.

Observations for latitude were made at all longitude stations except Cebu by the observers in the field and at Manila (Putnam, observer), making fifteen stations in all.
A.ZIMCTH ·OBSERVATIONS.

Azimuths were derived from the time observations at all the longitude stations except Cape Bojeador, and meridian lines were permanently marked on. the ground except in a few cases where this was impracticable, and in such cases the azimuth of some other marked line was derived as above stated. To control local triangulation, azimuths were determined by theodolite observations on Polaris at Manila (Putnam) and at Bolinao (Denson), and by theodolite observations on the sun at Santo Tomas (Denson) and at Darigayos (Denson).
MAGNETIC O_BSERVATIONS.

Observations with a compass declinometer. were made at all the longitude stations except Cape Bojeador.

TIDE OBSERVATIONS.

Observations were made as follows: Manila, Luzon, February 1 r to June 30. Sual, Luzon, January 30 to March 6. San Fernando, Luzon, January 26 to March 14. Santo Tomas, Luzon, May 6 to May 23. Darigayos, Luzon, June 17 to June 20. Aparri, Luzon, January 3 to April ro. Balayan, Luzon, May 14 to May r6. Tacloban, Leyte (dates not given). Reports were made by each chief of party, in which the details of the work executed were stated. Office work was undertaken as soon as necessary quarters and furniture could be obtained. The supply of many necessities for sale is very limited, and no desks could be obtained for more than a month after the party reached Manila. The demands upon Assistant Putnam were very exacting and his time was fully occupied with the numerous details involved in directing the surveys in- the field, in addition to the routine work necessary in conducting the office, involving correspondence, computation, furnishing information on request, preparing results for publication, disbursement of funds, and many other details too numerous to mention. Draftsman Welch was placed in charge of the Drawing Division and two Filipino draftsmen were employed to assist him-. Five charts were drawn and traced with lithographic ink, as follows:

Five tracings were prepared for the Captain of the Port, one for the Captain of the transport Slzeridan, and one for the Collector of Customs at San Fernando. Considerable work in plotting and verifying hydrographic sheets and some inking of original sheets was done. ·when the tracing of a chart with lithographic ink on lithographic paper was completed, the tracing was placed ,face down on a clean lithographic stone, which was run through the press several times. This transferred the ink to the stone and the paper can then be washed away withput removing any of the ink. The characters for sand, trees, swamp, hachures, lettering (in part), and the projection were drawn directly on the stone. About 100 blue prints of various sketches were made and distributed on request of the Captain of the Port and other officials. After overcoming many obstacles, three charts were published by lithography, and publication was then suspended until suitable paper could be obtained, as there was none for sale in Manila or Hongkong.

188

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY RE;PORT,

1901.

Six additional charts, four from Coast and Geodetic Survey work and two from Spanish charts needing publication with additions, were prepared for publication. About 200 copies of the advance prints of the three charts mentioned above were distributed. Three numbers of a Notice to Mariners, dated March 1, April 1, and July 1, were prepared and :published in an edition of 500 copies, and most of these were distributed to the various officials, including the collector of customs at every port. The Spanish board of trade republished these notices in Spanish and they were received with favor by others. In response to a request addressed to the President of the United States Philippine Commission, under date of December 24, 1901, the Commission, on March 8, 1901, made an appropriation to purchase a small steamer for the use of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and subsequently appropriated money for repairing and refitting the steamer and also an amount to purchase coal for the use of the steamer. The steamer Research was purchased and at the close of the fiscal year was still undergoing alterations, as it was found impossible to avoid long delays from lack of facilities and other causes. The different classes of work were actively in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

He began the work on August 1 and continu!'!d it during the remainder of his stay in Paris and London, and reported at the Office on September 8 to resume his regular duties in the Drawing ana Engraving Division. In Paris he secured an introduction to M. Emile Levasseur, member of the Institute of France, and professor in the College of France, through the courtesy of the United States Ambassador, Gen. Horace Porter. M. Levasseur gave him letters of introduction which secured the authority and facilities he desired in the prosecution of his work. He visited the office of the "Service Geographique de l' Armee,'' the office of the ''Service Hydrographique, '' and the office of the '' Directeur de la Carte de France et du Statistique Graphique,'' where every courtesy was shown htm as the result of presenting the letters given him by M. Levasseur. While in London Mr. Fowler visited the Admiralty Office and several of the large publishing houses. Information was obtained bearing upon the subject under investigation and the details reported by Mr. Fowler after his return to the Office.

RESURVEY OF MASON AND DIXON'S LINE.

PENNSYLVANIA. MARYLAND.

W. C.

HODGKINS.

The resurvey· of Mason and Dixon's line, the boundary line between the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland, having become desirable, a commission was authorized by the legislature of the respective States to undertake the work. This commission is composed of three members, the Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Secretary of' Internal Affairs of Pennsylvania, and the State Geologist of Maryland. Assistant W. C. Hodgkins was selected to execute the necessary work in the field, and he was detached from duty at the Office for that purpose. He left Washington on October 21 and proceeded to Cumberland, Md., and on the following day began a reconnaissance of the region adjacent to the boundary. As a result of this·work he decided to begin operations at the northwest corner of Maryland, and the actual running of the trial line began on November .5. Unfortunately, winter weather was experienced at an unusually early date, and progress was delayed by frost and snow. The work proceeded until December 20, when the party was disbanded and operations were suspended to wait for more favorable conditions. Assistant Hodgkins proceeded to Wa&hington and was engaged on other work until April 8, when he resumed the survey of the boundary to the eastward of the Susquehanna River. This portion of the line between Cecil County, Md., and Chester and Lancaster Counties, Pa., \vas originally marked by monuments of cut stone, approximately 1 mile apart. Most of these monuments were found in place, but nearly all of them had been disturbed, and many of them were in a mutilated condition. When any monument; or portion of a monument, was found in its original position, this was assumed to be the boundary line, and the position was marked in a much more permanent manner than that originally adopted. Notes were made along the line in order to prepare a topographic sketch in its v1c1mty. The progress of the work was seriously retarded by long-continued and heavy rains, and to some extent by extremely hot weather in June. On Ju·ne 30 this work was still in progress, and a section 23 miles long had been covered. While engaged in this work Assistant Hodgkins was named as a member of the commission appointed by the United States Supreme Court to re-mark the boundary line betweei1 Virginia and Tennessee, and was absent on that duty May 17 to 22 and June 10 to 26. During his absence the party continued at work under his assistant, Robert H. Blain. The incidental expense of this work was paid by the States interested.

MARKING .THE VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE BOUNDARY.

VIRGINIA. TENNESSEE.

W. C. HODGKINS. J. B. BAYLOR.

On April 30 1 1900 1 a decree was announced for the United States Supreme Court by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller which ordered the re-marking of the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennes5ee, established in 1801-1803 by the joint action of these States, commonly known as the ''diamond line,'' as the ''real, certain, and true boundary between the said States.'' In this decree William C. Hodgkins, of Massachusetts, James B. Baylor, of Virginia, and Andrew.H. Buchanan, of Tennessee, were appointed a Commission ''to ascertain, retrace, re-mark and reestablish said boundary line, but without authority to run or establish 'any other or new Ene.'' W. C. Hodgkins and James B. Baylor are Assistants in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and they were detailed to perform the duties imposed by this . decree whenever the necessary conditions permitted. On May 17 1901, funds for field expenses provided by the States interested having become available, the Commission met at Coast and Geodetic Survey Office in Washington and organized by electing Assistant Hodgkins, chairman; Assistant Baylor, secretary, and Professor Buchanan, treasurer. A considerable amount of preparatory work had already been accomplished by the Commissioners through correspondence. The necessary instnunerits and outfit were furnished by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to the extent permitted by the available supply. On May 20 Assistant Baylor and Professor Buchanan proceeded to Bristol, Tenn., to begin active field operations, and Assistant Hodgkins returned to his work on the Pennsylvania and Maryland boundary. Assistant Baylor continued on the work during the remainder of the fiscal year, and the work was still in progress on June 30. Assistant Hodgkins was engaged on this work in the field from June ro to 25.

The Survey was requested to undertake this work, by the International Geodetic Association, and all the incidental party expenses were paid out of funds furnished by the association. The work in Europe was completed, and Assistant Putnam returned to \Vashington, reporting for duty at the Office on September 21. He was directed to prepare the results for transmission to the association and to complete· the connection by making the final set of observations in Washington. These observations were made early in October, and on October 12 a report on the work was submitted.

ESTABLISHING TIDE GAUGES IN THE DELAWARE RIVER.

D. B.

WAINWRIGHT.

In order to comply with a request from the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange for the establishment of tide staffs in the Delaware River for the use of shipping Assistant Wainwright was instructed to make the necessary arrangement and execute the work. He left Washington on April 10 and erected large tide staffs, or gauges, on the principal wharf at Chester, Pa., on the wharf of the United States Oil Company, near Marcus Hook, and on the naval magazine wharf, near Fort Miffiin. Each gauge was an inch board 9 inches wide and 13 inches long, firmly attached to the outer face of the wharf. The face of the gauge was painted in square blocks 1 foot high, alternately black and white, with large figures on the squares of the opposite color. Provision was made for the removal of the gauges when necessary to repaint them and for replacing them in the same position. The work was successfully completed on April 19, and Assistant Wainwright returned to Washington. A steam tug was furnished by the maritime exchange a11d was used as the means of transportation.

ISAAC WINSTON.

EXAllIINATION OF INSTRUMENTS OF PRECISION AT THE PARIS EXPOSITION.

The duty of representing the United States as delegate to the meeting of the International Geodetic Association at Paris, France, was assigned to Assistant Winston, and he was directed to make the necessary preparations to attend the thirteenth General Conference of the Association, which was to assemble at Paris on September 25. \Vhile in Paris he was directed to avail himself of the opportunity presented by the exhibit at the Paris Exposition and to examine and report upon the instruments of precision which might be used in the. various operations of this service. He left the Office on August I 7 and sailed the following day from New York for Paris, where he arrived on September 13, having spent some time in England en route. The examination of the instruments exhibited at the Exposition began on the 14th, and thi~ work continued until the 23d. On the 24th preparations to attend the sessions of the International Geodetic Association were made and 011 the 25th the opening session was held. Assistant Winston attended all the sessions of the conference until it adjourned on the 6th of October. He then continued the examination of instruments and completed this work on October 14· After spending some time in Europe, on leave of absence, Assistant Winston returned to Washington and reported for duty at the Office on December 6. He submitted a report upon the instruments examined and also a report giving a resume of the work of the International Geodetic Association. The association publishes the proceedings of each conference in detail and consequently no extracts from this resume are stated in this place. He makes special acknowledgment of the many courtesies extended to him as delegate of the United States by the officials of the French Republic and by the French Geodetic Association.

EXA:lllNATION OF HYDROGRAPHIC METHODS IX VSE IN EUROPE.

C. C.

YATES.

Advantage was taken of the presence abroad of Assistant Yates, and he was instructed to make an examination which would enable him to submit a report upon the hydrographic surveys of England, France, and Germany, and upon the heliographic methods of making copper plates for printing maps in use by the Military Geographic Institute at Vienna, Austria. He was also instructed to investigate the desirability of establishing foreign agencies for the sale of Coast and Geodetic SurYey Charts. A reference was made to this work in the preYious Annual Report. As a result of presenting his credentials, Asf:istant Yates was granted unusual authority to pursue the investigations under his charge and many courtesies were extended to him by the representatives of the United States abroad and the officials of the Go\·ernment in the countries visited. ~fany delays occurred and the investigation extended far beyond the date anticipated in the beginning. Various offices and institutions were visited and time was spent on board the survey vessels of England and France, by special permission, watching the methods in actual use in the field. Assistant Yates visited Berlin and Vienna, and, having completed the duty assigned to him, returned to the United States and reported at the Office on August 20. He expresses his great appreciation of the courtesy and kind attention shown him and reports a long list of officials and others to whom the thanks of the Survey are due for the aid extended to him in the .prosecution of his work.

An extract from the report of the Assistant in Charge is given below:
The Annual Report of the Office for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1901, is accompanied by the Annual Reports of the various divisions thereof, namely: Computing Division, Division of Terrestrial :\Iagnetism, Tidal Didsion, Drawing and Engra\·ing Division, Chart Division, Instrument Divisio1i, Library and Archives Division, Miscellaneous Division, aml Special Duty. The Computing Di,·ision continued under the clirection of Assistant J. F. Hayford, whose report shows a creditable amount of work accomplished, especially considering the limited force at his disposal. The Division has, as heretofore, been reinforced from time to time by the temporary detail of Assistants and Aids when not actively engaged on field duty. The regular employees of the Division and the field officers temporarily cletailed for office duty are given in l\Ir. Hayford's report aml need not be enumerated here, and the usual statistical infonnation concerning the correspondence and routine work are also furnished. Among the most important items of work accomplished may be mentioned the following. The work of reducing the geographic positions in southeast Alaska to a uniform standard was almost completed. The computation of more than 1,000 miles of precise leveling was made. A United States Datum, to which all connected geographic positions are to be reduced, was adopted, and the positions of the primary points along the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation, along

the eastern qblique arc, and along the western oblique arc were reduce<l to this <latum before the close of the fiscal year. The Division of Terrestrial Magnetism continued under the charge of Assistant L. A. Bauer. His report contains the usual detailed account of the correspondence, routine work, and distribution of magnetic infonnation. During his absences on field inspection the office work of the Division was attended to by Mr. D. L. Hazard. Bulletin No. 41, "Magnetic Survey of North Carolina," was prepare<l for publication; various magnetic instruments were carefully examined an<l their constants determined; plans were prepared for magnetic observatories at Sitka, Alaska, and Honolulu, Hawaiian Islanc!s; the preparation of a new edition of the Magnetic Declination Tables was begun, and a revision of all field magnetic observations to date was undertaken and good progress mane. :\Iention may also he made of the wide distribution of a circular to surveyors, professors of engineering, etc., requesting information relative to ·magnetic declination, secular change allowed for in relocating old boundary lines, etc. The large correspondence resulting from this circular has been critically examined and the information derived therefrom has been tabulated for publication. The Tidal Dh·ision, as heretofore, remained under the charge of :\Ir. L. P. Shidy, and his report gives full details as to work accomplished <luring the year. The annual volume of Tide Tables (for 1902) was prepared, verified, an<l published, and the usual reprints for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts were issued; the usual reductions ancl discussions of tides were attended to anrl information furnished for tide notes of charts; tidal information has been furnished in response to numerous inquiries, etc. Dr. R. A. Harris prepared for publication, as an Appendix to the Annual Report for l<}OO, a paper entitled, "Outlines of Tidal Theory,'' and also a leaflet on tides and tidal currents for distribution at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition. :\fr. Shidy also revised and extended the portion of "General instructions for Hydrographic Parties" relating to tides and currents. In the 'l'i<le Tables for 1902 several new features were introduced, among which two current diagrams for :Kew York harbor and tables for finding the height of the sea at any time between high and low water are worthy of special mention. The Drawing and Engraving Division continued under the charge of Assistant \\'. \V. Duffield, and his report shows in detail the work accomplished by each of the five sections of the Dh·ision, and gives the usual statistical information as to information furnished, etc. In the Engraving Section the work of chart production has been facilitated am! expedited by the introduction of the new engra\·ing machines. The one for engraving soundings especially has proved a great labor-saving device and shortens very materially the time required for putting hydrography on copper. In the Drawing Section, under the immediate supervision of Chief Draftsman E. H. Fowler, the principle of transfer from negath·es or copper plates has been successfully applied in the matter of makingtitles to original sheets and in adding sanding, etc., to drawings for photolithographic reproduction. This has resulted in a considerable ~ving of draftsmen's time and has enabled the section better to keep up with the increasing demands upon it. In addition to the regular work of the section, a map of the world, S feet by 20 feet, on which the Colonial possessions of all the great nations are shown in appropriate colors, was prepared for the use of the President. In the Printing Section, under the immediate direction of Foreman D. N. Hoover, the regular work has been kept up as usual and some progress made in printing bond copies for the files of the old plates in the archives with a view of properly cataloguing ~he same and eliminating useless plates. The facilities of the Photographing Section have been increased by the purchase of necessary new outfit ancl by the removal to the more comn10cl.ious quarters in the attic of the main building. The increase of facilities, the new equipment and the improvement of processes have resulted in a gratifying increase of the output and improvement in quality of work of this section. The usual amount of work has been a,ccomplished in the Electrotyping Section. The Chart Division, consisting of the Chart Section and the Hydrographic Section, has remained tmder the charge of Assistant Gershom Bradford, the Inspector of Charts. In the Chart Section the voluminous correspondence relating to charts, the keeping of the accounts with sales agents, the general issue of charts, coast pilots, and tine tables to Departments of the GO\·ernment and to the outside public, the hand corrections of charts from recent information, and the coloring by hand of lights and buoys, have received careful and prompt attention. The usual statistical information concerning the work of the section and the distribution of charts, etc., is given in Mr. Bradford's report.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.

In the Hydrographic Section the usual monthly Notices to Mariners have been prepared for publication, the aids to navigation were kept up to latest information on our various charts, numerous hy<lrographic sheets of field parties were plotted or verified, and much misceJlaneous work was done. The Hydrographic Section was aided to some extent by occasional details for short periods of field draftsmen, who, however, were usually confined to the work of the party from which they were detailed. In the Instrument Division, under the charge of Chief !\lechanician E. G. Fischer, the usual amount of work has been accomplished. This consisted of repairs to instruments, the construction of such new instruments as are not obtainable in the open market, the issue of instruments, camp outfit, and general property of the Survey, including the checking of the annual im·entories. Minor repairs to buildings, repairs of office furniture, construction of cases for library, etc., and the care of office bells, pneumatic clocks, etc., also received due attention. The complete work of the Division during the year is given in detail in Mr. Fischer's report in statistical form. Mr. Fischer also modified and improved an electrical tide indicator and attended to its installation at the rooms of the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange, supervised the construction of a 5-meter iced bar and base tape apparatus for the. Japanese Government, and subsequently aided in the standardization of the same. He also performed like func~ions in connection with the construction and standardization of a JOO-meter base tape apparatus for the Trigonometrical Survey of the Straits Settlements. :\inch of the work of preparation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit for the Pan-American Exposition also devolved on this Division. The I,ibrary and Archives Division has continued under the charge of Mr. E. L. Burchard and his report gives full statistical information in regard to the books, pamphlets, serials, maps, and charts purchased, donated, or received in exchange, and the original sheets and records received from field parties. Good progress has been made in the indexing of the archives. The Miscellaneous Division has as heretofore attended to the purchase and distribution of supplies required for the Office and making requisitions for printing and binding, the issue of stationery to field parties and Office Divisions, the custody of the publications of the Survey, and the keeping of the records relative to their distribution. The report is submitted in tlie usual statistical fonn. The special assignment of Assistant C. A. Schott was continued, hut, owing to his illness in the latter part of the fiscal year, the report of the work accomplished was submitted for him by Miss Lilian Pike. The computation and discussion of the Eastern Oblique Arc from :\1aine to Louisiana occupied the greater part of the year, and was finally completed and the report submitted for publication. The computation of geographic positions in the New England States was also completed and the Tennessee triangulation adjusted. The proof reading of Special Publication No. 4, the Transcontinental Arc, was also compl!!ted and work resumed on the reduction of the California arc. In the immediate Office of the Assistant in Charge Mr. George A. Fairfield has assisted in the correspondence and attendee\ generally to routine husiness; Mr. A. B. Simons, in addition to his clerical duties and the keeping of the accounts of moneys received from sale of publications, sale of old condemned property, and for work done for outside parties, has had general charge of the watchmen, the messengers, and labor force, and the keeping in order of the Survey buildings. ;\Ir. E. B. \Vills has kept the time records of the Office and Field employees, the express and freight matters, and the registered mail records. Miss Kate Lawn has in general attended to the typewriting and copying for the Office and miscellaneous clerical duty. She has also attended to the distribution of Notice to Mariners and largely to the distribution of other publications of the Survey. She has been assisted in this work by temporary appointees-Miss E. :\1. French, Miss I,. Helen, arnl :\1iss E. L. ::\Iewshawtheir terms of servi~e aggregating sixty-six days. In conclusion I take pleasure in reporting that t11e condition of the Office is in general very satisfactory and the reports of the various Di visions show an unusually large amount of work accomplished during the year. This is in part due to the introduction of new facilities, the improvement of the methods, and the adopting of labor-saving devices, hut due credit must also be l{iven to the hearty and efficient cooperation of all the chiefs of Divisions. Strenuous efforts ha\·e been made to expedite the work of the Survey, particularly in the matter of preparation of charts for publication, and also to so systematize the work as to eliminate as far as possible sources of error.

The work of this Division may be divided into four classes: ( 1) Supplying information of various kinds to the field parties and to persons outside the Survey. . ( 2) Final computations or revisions of computations in connection with recent field operations: (3) Computations which are necessary to reduce older field work to a standard datum. (4) The preparation of results for publication. The detail of the temporary force was made for short periods from time to time as the necessities of the field operations permitted, and many of this temporary force were engaged in completing their records of field work while attached to the Computing Division. Consequently these temporary details only brought the average effective force of the Division up to 8 men besides the chief. · The average effective force for the different months varied from 3 in August to 15 in March. From December s to 22, Assistant William Eimbeck acted as chief of

Division, and from May 31 to June 30 Mr. A. L. Baldwin, computer, occupied this pos1t1on. During the first period Assistant Hayford was absent on field duty and during the second period he was on leave of absence. Within the limits of this report it is possible to state only a few of the more important results reached in the work of the Division during the year. The routine work of answering correspondents and furnishing information to field parties has always been heavy and is steadily increasing. For considerable periods it' has absorbed nearly all the energy of the Division. Some idea of the volume of the correspondence may be obtained froni the statement that during the year 2 3 r 9 geographic positions and l 185 descriptions of stations were furnished to various parties. In judging of the work involved in these descriptions and positions, it should be borne in mind that the data required must be, collected from numerous volumes covering the operations of the Survey in past years, that nearly all the descriptions of stations require accompanying sketches, and that many letters require special computations to be made before an answer can be prepared. Aside from this routine work and other routine computations necessary to make the results of recent field work available, notable progress was made in the following work: The work of reducing the positions in southeast Alaska to a uniform standard was almost completed, and about l 300 of the geographic positions were entered in the register. During the year more than I ooo miles of precise leveling lines were completed, and the Office computations made. On March 13, 1901, a United States Standard Datum, to which all connected geographic positions are to be reduced, was adopted. This datum is the one already used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in publishing the geographic positions of several of the Eastern States. The positions of the primary points along the 39th parallel triangulation, along the eastern oblique arc to Mobile, and along the western oblique arc, were reduced to this datum before the close of the fiscal year. The tables for the computation of geodetic positions published in Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1894, Appendix No. 9, extend from 18° to 72° of latitude. The computation necessary to extend these tables from 18° to the equator was made, and the result is published in Appendix No. 4 to this Report. This extension makes the table available for all latitudes from 72° north to 72° south. Assistant Hayford mentions the individuals of the regular force of the Division by name, and highly commends the value of their service, and the ability and efficiency with which they have executed the duties assigned to them.

The work of this Division was continuedon the same lines as during the previous fiscal year. It was largely routine work and included furnishing a large number of compass directions for the charts issued by the Survey, supplying declinations for the Coast Pilots, and correcting the position of the isogonic lines on charts of Alaska for secular change. Numerous calls for information relating to magnetic declination and its secular change were received and answered. The demand for information of this character is steadily increasing. A circular requesting information relating to magnetic declination and the amount of secular change allowed in relocating old boundary lines \vas widely distributed over the United States by being sent to surveyors and professors of engineering and mechanics and the information received in reply was critically examined and tabulated for publication. Bulletin No. 41, ·'Magnetic Survey of North Carolina," was prepared for publication, and the proof of Appendixes Nos. 9 and 10, Report 1899, was read. The preparation of a new edition of the Magnetic Declination Tables was begun, and the revision of the computation of all magnetic observations previously made by the Survey was undertaken, and nearly all the declinations were completed. Progress was made in the preparation of the isogonic chart of the United States for 1902. Various magnetic instruments were compared and their constants were determined. Plans were prepared for magnetic observatories at Sitka, Alaska, and at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands. Mr. D. L. Hazard acted as Chief of Division from September 5 to December 10, and also at other times when Assistant Bauer was absent on short trips of inspection. About one-half of Assistant Bauer's time was devoted to duties relating to the direction and inspection of field work which devolved upon him as Inspector of Magnetic Work. Assistant Bauer commends the able manner in which Mr. Hazard performed the various duties assigned to him.

The annual volume of Tide Tables for the year 1902 was prepared and published. The separates for the Atlantic coast and for the Pacific coast were also published. The volume has several new features, among which may be mentioned two current diagrams for Kew York Harbor and some tables for finding the height of the sea at any intermediate time between high and low water. ' Sixty-one volumes of tidal records were prepared for binding. Nonhanuonic reductions were made for 64 stations with about one month's observations at a station. Harmonic analyses were completed for a year of hourly ordinates at each of three stations and also for several short series, which, together with the work in progress at the close of the last fiscal year, brings the total to an equivalent of the complete analysis of five years' continuous record. The plane of reference was determined for 54 stations. About twelve years of automatic tide-gauge record was tabulated as high and low waters and also as hourly heights of the sea. Tide notes were prepared for a large number of stations upon charts and hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was prepared in response to requests from numerous field parties and persons not connected with the Survey. This involved the preparation of tidal data for 566 stations and descriptions of 264 bench marks. The following records were received during the fiscal year: One year's record from the automatic gauges at Fort .Hamilton, N'. Y .. Philadelphia, Pa., Reedy Island, Del., Washington, D. C., Fernandina, Fla., Presidio, San Francisco Bay, California, and Seattle, Wash. One year's record at Providence, R. I., from the city engineer. One year's record from 3 stations at Habana Harbor, Cuba, .from the Corps Engineers, United States Army. Records covering shorter periods from automatic gauges and staff and box gauges were received from 37 stations in the Eastern Division, 16 stations in the Western Division, 14 stations in Alaska, 16 stations in Porto Rico, and 4 stations in the Philippine Islands. An aggregate of thirty-five years of record from automatic tide gauges was received, examined, and registered. In addition to the above, an aggregate of two years' record from staff and box gauges at 77 stations was received. A tracing of the original tide record at Wellington, New Zealand, for one year, and a table of high and low water times and heights for three additional years were received from an official of the Government. The above observations cover an aggregate of thirty-seven years' tide observations, all of which were examined and registered.

This Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section executed the work indicated by its title and the combined result is shown in the charts published by the Survey.
DRAWING SECTION.

The following statements and tables show in detail the work accomplished in this section, which was continued under the personal direction of Mr. E. H. Fowler, chief draftsman. Several changes in the method of work were introduced to increase the output without lowering the high standard of excellence in execution heretofore maintained. The process of transferring to original sheets the notes, titles, and general lettering which are common to all has been perfected s6 that the work of preparing these sheets for approval and registration is reduced to a minimum and results in saving much labor and expense. A new sheet of standard letters (Roman capitals), accompanied by a self-spacing device, was completed and the resulting method of building up titles will eventually insure uniformity in the titles of all the field sheets and all the charts published by photolithography and also result in saving much time in their preparation, thus reducing the cost of publication. A large map of the world, 8 feet by 20 feet, was prepared for the use of the Presideht, on which the colonial possessions of the great powers are shown by appropriate colors. The work of the Division, as a whole, is commended by its Chief, and Messrs Fowler and H. Lindenkohl are specially mentioned for the energy and ability displayed by them.

Four hundred and thirty-three charts were revised, corrected, and verified for new editions or reprints from copper plates. Thirty-six topographic and 44 hydrographic projections were constructed for the use of the Office and the field parties and 12 projections were made on copper plates. Nearly 400 illustrations were made for the Annual Report and the Special Publications (including the Coast Pilot).
ENGRAVING SECTION.

The work in this Section continued under the personal direction of the Chief of Division. During the year three engraving machines were installed and put into use. The machine for engraving sou_ndings works well, and makes it possible to engrave the

hydrography of a chart in a short time (one to three days). A large border cutting and tinting machine and a new and improved compass cutting machine have added to the efficiency of the Division by increasing the output of charts. Several charts were published by transfer from copper plates cut by machine work, except the sanding, fathom curves, and bottom characteristics engraved by hand, and tp.e topography, notes, title, etc., which were added by photolithography from drawings made to fit the engraved plates, This process proved very successful and is very useful in the publication of preliminary editions. The following tables show the work of the section in detail. The following original plates were completed:

The work in this Section is shown in the following tabular stateme.nt. Messrs. Willenbucher and Wyvill executed the work with the aid of the temporary force assigned to the Division from time to time for short periods. A notice to mariners was prepared and issued each month. The hydrographic sheets received from the field parties were examined and verified and the work necessary to complete them was done. This involved a large amount of plotting. as shown in the tabular statement:

The accounting for the instruments and general property of the Survey was done in this Division. This involved the checking of the inventories submitted annually by all parties having charge of Government property in.use by the Survey and the·entry on the books of the Office of all property purchased by those employed in the Survey in executing the work assigned to them. All instruments received from the field were examined and the necessary repairs made before sending them out for use in the field. During the year more than 1 600 instruments of various kinds were cleaned, adjusted, and sent to the field. Minor repairs to the Office buildings and to the office furniture were made. The construction of twelve new plane table Alidades was undertaken and considerable progress made.

Two meridan telescopes (Nos. 2 and 16) were remodeled and repolished, and several changes were made to improve the instruments. Considerable time was spent in preparing the instruments loaned to the Baldwin-Zeigler Polar Expedition and in instructing the observer in their use. An electric apparatus for indicati.ng changes in water level at any distance from the point of observation was purchased for use in the Office of the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange; and the changes and improvements necessary to adapt it for use as a tide indicator were completed. The Japanese Government having requested the Survey to supervise the construction of a 5-meter iced bar and base tape apparatus by a private firm, the Chief of this Division was assigned to that duty, and it was successfully performed. He also took part in the comparisons necessary to standardize this apparatus. He performed similar duty in connection with the construction of a 100-meter base tape apparatus for the Trigonometical Survey of the Straits Settlement. The exhibit of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Pan-American Exposition was prepared and packed for shipment.

--------------------The library is essentially for the purpose of reference, and this use of it involved. much labor on the part of the personnel. The daily calls upon the archives for original records also requires much time in charging the records issued to individuals using them and in crediting them when returned. The system used enables the librarian to quickly locate the records in use when they are not found on the shelves. · The indexing of the archives made steady progress, and during the year all of the astronomic records and half of the geodetic records and computations were examined and indexed. The principal growth of the library during the year was from exchanges with various foreign institutions, as shown in the following table:

C. A. Schott. . ~ In charge of computation of arc measures. Miss L. Pike .. · Computer. C. R. Duvall .. ! Do.

Assistant Schott continued in charge of the discussion of arc measures 111 the United States and the preparation of the results for publication. The completion for publication of the computation and discussion of the eastern oblique arc of the United States required almost the entire time of the personnel until the MS. was submitted for publication on March r, r901. This arc extends from l\faine to Louisiana along the eastern coast of the United States, and the discussion is based upon observations made from time to time as the necessity of extending the survey of the coast became urgent, covering nearly the whole period of the existence of the sun-ey. In consequence, the examination of records and reduction of results were exceptionally laborious. The final proof of Special Publication No. 4, ''The Transcontinental Triangulation.'' was read and the publication was issued in October, 1900. After March 1 the reduction of the arc along the western coast of the United States was taken up and the adjustment of the triangulation between the transcontinental triangulation and the Los Angeles base net, involving the solution of fifty-six normal equations, was completed. The computation of latitude observations at three stations, not previously reduced, was completed, and the computation at four other stations nearly completed. The revision of former computations at other stations was in progress. On March 2 r Assistant Schott was compelled to give up work on account of ill health and was not on duty at the Office after that date, though he continued to direct the work during the remainder of the fiscal year. Miss Lilian Pike, computer, was in immediate charge of the work during this period, and executed Assistant Schott's directions.

PREFACE.
Early in 1899 the writer was requested by Dr. H. S. Pritchett, then Superintendent, to consider the general questions involved in deciding upon the loc~tion and number of the bases which should control the length of the triangle sides in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, and to prepare instructions for the measurement of these bases. Among the suggestions made ·by Dr. Pritchett at this time, three were especially emphasized. namely: That it would be better to measure many bases at comparatively short intervals along the triangulation with a moderate degree of accuracy than to measure few at longer intervals with a very high degree of accuracy; that the bases could be measured at a much smaller cost if one party measured as many as possible in a single seasm1 in advance of the triangulation than if the customary plan were followed of measuring one base at a time as the connections with the triangulation were completed, and that the degree of accuracy in the base measures which it is necessary or desirable to attain should be ascertained, and the plans for the measurement made with reference to securing this accuracy as quickly and economically as possible. These suggestions have been followed faithfully. Looking upon the methods of fixing the lengths in triangulation in the broad-minded manner forced upon one by these suggestions, one important point in regard to the selection of base sites appeared to call for an immediate decision and action. An examination of the manner in which errors of length in a triangulation accumulate in passing from a base to a remote triangle side shows clearly that the most accurate part of the operation is the base measurement; that the accumulation of error is most rapid in passing from the base to the border lines of the base net, since poor geometrical conditions are necessarily encountered in the expansion from the base, and that the errors of length accumulate much more slowly in the chain of triangles between base nets than in the base nets, but that even here the errors are large in comparison with those involved in the base measures. If, then, in making a reconnaissance for a base it is found that two sites are available, on one of which the grades are small and uniform and the connection with the main chain of triangulation is difficult, and on the other heavy and rapidly changing grades are encountered but the geometrical conditions in the base figure are relatively good, it is evident that to select· the second site is to weaken the base measures, which are the most accurate portion of the operation of fixing the lengths in the triangulation, and at the same time to strengthen the triangulation in the base net, which is the least accurate operation .. Rough bases and good base nets are much to be preferred to smooth bases and poor base nets. Accordingly the reconnaissance party, which was about to select the sites for the bases from Kansas to southern Texas, was instructed to pay especial attention to securing good geometrical conditions in the base nets, even at a sacrifice of accuracy in the bases, and was informed that the accuracy of the base measures could be kept up to the required standard on any grade not exceeding 5 per cent, and that narrow, deep

ravines or valleys should not be considered as obstructions to the base measures. These instructions had a decided effect in fixing the location of bases, and account for the relath·ely rough ground over which many of the bases were measured. The Lampasas Base* is a good example of a rough base in a good base net. \Vhat degree of accuracy is it desirable to strive for in the measurement of base lines of which the sole function is to control the lengths in a triangulation? In the transcontinental triangulation the computed probable errors for the ten bases vary from l part in 1 28 ooo (Kent Island Base) to 1 part in 1 600 ooo (Salt Lake Base) and for only one base beside the Kent Island Base is the probable error greater than 1 part in 500 ooo, namely, the American Bottom Base, of which the probable error is 1 part in 353 ooo. The probable errors of the border lines of the base nets in the transcontinental triangulation vary from 1 part in 78 ooo in the American Bottom base net to 1 part in 365 ooo in the Yolo base net. After omitting the Kent Island base net because its base was measured with a very low degree of accuracy, in each of the remaining nine base nets the accumulation of error was so rapid that the probable errors of the border lines of the net, expressed as proportional parts, were from two to five times as great as the probable error of the base itself expressed in the same manner. The probable error of the lines in the triangulation '11ost remote from the base varies from 1 part in 45 ooo (Cape May to Cape Henlopen) to 1 part in 220 ooo (Toiyabe Dome to Lone Mountain, between the Salt Lake and Yolo bases). From these figures, t and from similar indications from other triangulations in th'e United States and in foreign countries, it was evident that very little increase in the average accuracy of the lengths of the triangle sides of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation would result from increasing the accuracy of the base measurement beyond that represented by a probable error of 1 part in 500 ooo. It was therefore decided to use this standard of accuracy in writing the instructions for the base measures. A constant endeavor was made in planning for and making the base measures to keep the accuracy up to the standard by strengthening the methods of the past at their weakest points, while, at the same time, increasing the rapidity of the operation by such omissions of refinements and of additional measures as would have simply the effect of reducing the strength of the past methods at their strongest points. A careful study of the past base measures, in which the writer was ably assisted by Mr. A. L. Baldwin, indicated clearly that although such measures are ordinarily of more than sufficient accuracy in' so far as accidental errors are concerned, they have two weak points with reference to constant errors. Each base has usually been measured with but one set of base apparatus, or, at least, with but one type of apparatus. The apparatus is usually standardized under one set of conditions at headquarters, and used under another set of conditions in the field. In so far as the writer is aware. there has been no exception to the rule that, whenever a base or part of a base has been measured with two different types of base-measuring apparatus, discrepancies between the measures have developed which were larger than could be accounted for by the accidental errors and too large to be consistent with the degree of accuracy which was supposed to be attainable with the apparatus.

evidence available indicates strongly that each type of base apparatus, and possibly each particular apparatus even of one type, should be suspected of being subject to an error peculiar to it:;elf. In the base measures of I 900 it was determined to reduce such errors to smaller proportions by making the length of each base depend on several sets of apparatus of two different types. A study in detail of the primary base measures made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the last ten years, namely, of the Holton, St. Albans, Salina, Salt Lake, and Versailles bases, and of the manner in which the apparatus was standardized in each case, left little room for doubt that there is an intimate relation between the conditions under which the apparatus is used or standardized and the systematic or constant errors in the results obtained. The evidence is very strong that the more serious errors are those due to erroneous determinations of the temperature of the measuring bar or tape. In general it seems to be true that the bar thermometer and the bar do not have the same temperature, and similarly mercurial thermometers seldom gi,·e the temperature of a tape accurately. It is not certain that, even with the duplex bar apparatus used independently of the thermometers, the temperature deduced from the relative expansion of the two bars was accurate. The evidence indicated strongly that the errors in temperature to be feared were dependent upon whether the apparatus was in sunlight, shade, or darkness; in rapidly rising, stationary, or falling temperatures, or inside a building, shed, or yard, or in the open fields. It was apparent that it was unsafe to assume that the le::ngth of either a bar or a tape as determined at the Office under a selected set of conditions supposed to be favorable to great accuracy, as, for example, at night undet a shed and with nearly constant temperatures, is applicable to that same apparatus under the widely different conditions encountered in the field. It seemed obvious that the proper procedure is to standardize the apparatus in the field under conditions as nearly as possible corresponding to those encountered in the base measures. The Woodward iced bar is the only apparatus in the possession of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to which the above statements do not apply. In the instructions for the base measurement quoted at the beginning of the following report there are four points on which especirrl stress is laid and of the importance of which the preceding paragraph should be sufficient explanation: First, the time and money to be used in both the standardization and the base measurement are limited strictly to the amounts necessary to keep tht accidental errors down to the limit indicated by a probable error of 1 part in 500 ooo; second, five sets of apparatus of two different types are to be used on each base; third, the five sets of apparatus are each standardized at the beginning and end of the season and intercompared on each base on the so-called test kilometer, and therefore these measures afford unusual opportunities to determine the actual accuracy attained; fourth, the standardizing in the field is done under conditions which are as nearly as possible identical with those encountered in the base measures. It was confidently expected that the unusual skill which would be acquired by a party making measurements of several bases in quick succession would help greatly in making the required measures rapidly and at a small cost. It may be noted also that the instructions or orders as written and enforced prohibited experimenting and striving for unnecessary accuracy, and encouraged the neglect of unessential precautions.

The writer feels that he can fearlessly invite a critical examination of the facts set forth fully and fairly in the following ·report. He believes that under such a critical examination these base measures will be found to have been made with a rapidity and economy that is unexcelled; that in so far as accidental errors are concerned they are more accurate than is necessary, the excess of accuracy having been attained, howe\·er, by the use of judgment and skill rather than time and money; and that in so far as systematic or constant errors are concerned, they bear within themseh·es positive evidence of their degree of reliability, and that this degree of reliability is certainly not less than in any of the base measurements of the past. The writer desires to acknowledge here his full appreciation of the fact that the success of the base measurements of 1900 is due to the zeal, ability, and faithfulness with which the field operations were carried on by Mr. A. L. Baldwin and his party.
THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITCTE TAPE APPARATUS.

It being known to the Superintendent that there had been de\·eloped at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a new form of tape apparatus of great promise, the writer was authorized to use the opportunity afforded by a visit of inspection to the base party at Alice, Tex., in December, 1900, to make a test of this apparatus to determine its adaptability to the measurement of primary bases. The President of the Massachusetts Institute kindly loaned the apparatus to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for that purpose. Certain tests were made at \Vashington in November, 1900. In December the writer and Prof. A. E. Burton, of the Massachusetts Institute, aided by the base party, made other tests of the apparatus on the Alice base. As these tests are closely associated with the base measures here reported, it seems appropriate that the conclusions derived from them should be stated here. Little has yet been published in regard to this apparatus.* It has been developed gradually during the last fourteen years by students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, acting under the direction of Prof. A. E. Burton, several theses having been written on different phases of this subject. The important feature of this form of tape apparatus is the device for obtaining the temperature of the tape. The whole length of the loo-meter tape and an approximately equal length of German-silver wire form two of the arms of a Wheatstone bridge." The two variable arms of the bridge, together with the telephone which is substituted in the place usually occupied by a galvanometer, and the necessary interrupter, batteries, and connections form the thermophone proper. The thermophone has been patented by Messrs. Henry E. Warren and George C. Whipple, and is manufactured by E. S. Ritchie & Sons. It has been used for determinations of temperatures in various ways, and the work of the students at the Massachusetts Institute now under consideration is mainly that of developing this. apparatus to use with long measuring tapes. The electrical resistance of the steel tape varies more rapidly with a change of temperature than does that of the German silver. The ratio of the resistance of the tape

to that of the German sil\"er is therefore a measure of their temperatures. Or, with sufficient accuracy, it is a measure of the temperature of the tape. proyided the German silver is similarly exposed, so as to ha Ye approximately the same temperature as the tape. This ratio is the quantity really measured by the thermophone. The thermophone dial, over which moves a pointer which indicates the position of the contact point regulating the two variable arms of the bridge, is graduated so as to indicate the temperature of the tape in Fahrenheit degrees. In regard to· the Massachusetts Institute tape apparatus as a whole, the writer is convinced: r. That with the themophone apparatus in its present form, and using all refinements, measures can be made even in daylight, and when the temperatures are varying rapidly, with a much higher degree of accuracy than is possible with tapes and mercurial thermometers even under good conditions at night. 2. That after the apparatus has been modified and strengthened at certain points with reference to making it proof against comparath·ely rough usage and capable of quicker manipulation, certain refinements being omitted, much more rapid measures can be made with it than with any form of bars, and probably more rapid than with the present form of tape apparatus if the tripod method rather than the stake method is used. 3. That it can be used efficiently with no more previous preparation of the ground than is necessary for bar measurement by substituting tripods for the marking stakes at the tape ends and for the intermediate supports. A few remarks may be necessary to explain the refereuce above to a possible tripod method of measurement with tapes. Base measurements with bars have ordinarily been made with the bars supported upon portable tripods. It has not been feasible to measure primary bases with tapes similarly supported upon tripods, since it was absolutely necessary to make the measures at night to secure the necessary degree of accuracy with the means heretofore available for determining the temperature. The thermophone apparatus determines the temperature with all necessary accuracy in daylight. Hence, it is now possible to substitute tripods or other portable supports, which may be placed in position as the measurement progresses, for the fixed stakes which have heretofore been used. With a well-organized base party, familiar with the work, the setting of the stakes requires considerably more time than the subsequent double-tape measure of the base.

GENERAL STATE::'llENT.

The general plan for the measurement of nine bases along the ninety-eighth meridian was presented to the writer in the form of instructions from Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, at that time Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A thorough understanding of the campaign will be hastened by printing an extract from these instructions, dated in May and July, 1900:
You will be detailed to take charge of a field party which is to measure nine bases along the ninety-eighth meridian, of which Page Base at the north, and Alice Base at the south end, are the extremes. Four steel tapes, two 100 meters in length, and two 50-meter tapes, and the duplex base bars, are to he used in the measurement of the bases. A portion of each base, about I kilometer in length, is to he measured with all five sets of apparatus, and of the remainder of the base a portion is to be measured with the tapes and a portion with the bars. Very little increase in the average accuracy of the lengths of the triangle sides of the ninetyeighth meridian triangulation will result from increasing the accuracy of the base measurement beyond that represented by a probable error of I part in 500 ooo. The following limits of accuracy on each operation are selected with a view to attaining a probable error but little if any greater than I part in 500 ooo on each base. You will strive to keep as far within these limits as is possible by the use of good judgment and skill, but you will restrict the time and money expended upon each operation substantially to that required to keep barely within these limits. You will standardize each tape and the duplex bars at the beginning of the field season upon a 100-meter comparator, which you will establish near Shelton Base for that purpose, by measuring the length of the comparator at least four times with each base apparatus. The measurements by each apparatus must not all be made on a single day or night. If four measures do not suffice to reduce the probable error of the mean for any apparatus below I part in 300 ooo, additional measures will be made until the probable error is reduced below that limit. The length of the comparator is to be determined by measuring it with the iced bar at such times that the longest inten·al between any such measurement and any measure with a piece of base apparatus for the purpose of standardization shall not exceed thirty-six hours. In computing the length of the bars and tapes, the length of the comparator shall not be assumed constant, but instead will at the time of each duplex or tape measurement be assumed to be that given by the nearest measurement with the iced bar, or by the mean of the last preceding and first following .measurements. The bars and tapes are to be re-standardized in the same manner. at or near the end of the field season. The conditions under which each form of apparatus is standardized should approximate as near as is feasible to those under which it is used in the actual measures of the base. 2.p S. Doc. 50--16

COl\ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, i901.

One kilometer of each base, to be known as the test kilometer, is to be measured with the'duplex bars and once with each of the tapes. If any one of these five measures shows a residual from the mean of more than 17 milimeters, an additional measure of the test kilometer shall be made with that apparatus. Residuals of more than 17 milimeters on the test kilometer, which persist even after a remeasurement, shall be considered to indicate the desirability of re-standardization, but in no case shall the apparatus be standardized without special authorization, except at the beginning and ending of the season as indicated above. Of the remainder of each base not less than one-tenth nor more than one-third is to be measured twice with the duplex bars; not less than one-fifth nor more than two-thirds is to be measured once with each 50-meter tape; and not less than one-fifth nor more than two-thirds is to be measured once with each 100-meter tape. Additional measures shall be made if the discrepancy between the two measures on any section exceeds 20mm K (in which K is length of the section in kilometers) until two measures are obtained which agree within that limit. About one-fifth of the total length of all the bases after the test kilometers are deducted should be measured with the duplex bars, and about two-fifths each with the 50-meter tapes and the ·loo-meter tapes. Such precaution should be taken to secure accurate horizontal and vertical alignment of the tapes and of the bars as is necessary to insure that the errors arising from this source on any section of the base shall be less than 1 part in 1 ooo ooo. It is not desirable, however, to use any more time on this part of the operation than that necessary to keep well within the limit stated. This principle should also be applied to the determination of the tension on the tape while in use. PARTY ORGANIZATION.

An effort was made to so arrange the party that the illness or disability of one man should not stop the work. A working force of ten persons was decided on and this number was varied only at the first base, where Mr. L. A. Fischer, Adjuster, of the Office of Standard Weights.and Measures, had immediate charge of the preparations for and measures with the iced-bar apparatus, and when the employment of occasional day labor would increase the party's efficiency. The personnel of the party included the following: A. L. Baldwin, Computer and Chief of Party, made all the contacts between the duplex components and forward contacts on all tape measures. William Bowie, Assistant, aligned the bars for the duplex measures, made rear contact on tape measures, and had immediate charge of the setting of the tape supports. Frank H. Brundage, Aid, spaced the trestles for the bar measures, ranged out the bases. aligned the tape supports in the vertical, and recorded for the tape measures. Ora M. Leland, Aid, kept the record of the duplex bar measures and leveled the bases for tape grades and profile. ~rof. L. S. Smith, succeeded by R. S. Ferguson, Recorder, read the bar inclinations, thermometers, and assisted in the leveling operations. Five laborers completed the party.
TIME TABLE.

The base map shows at once the general location of the nine bases, and the railroad lines there shown indicate the route followed by the party. July 16, 1900, was the date of the arrival and organization of the party at Shelton, Nebr., and after this date twenty-six days must be charged for each meh1ber of the party to the delays incident to the transp0rtation from each base site to the one next in order of measurement. The movements of the party may be conveniently shown in tabular form.

The departure from the Seguin base began on January 18, 1901, so that, excluding the time spent in traveling, the average time spent at each base, not excluding Sundays and holidays, was 15.6 days.
UNIT OF LENGTH.

The 5-meter steel bar No. 17, designated as B 17 , when immersed in melting ice, was the unit to which all determinations of length were directly referred. This bar No. 17 has been compared directly with Prototype Meter No. 2 l, designated as Mw and known in terms of the International Meter. This makes, then, but two intermediate standards between the bars and tapes actually used on the base, and the international standard of length, the International Meter. Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892, pages 351-393, contains the complete description of the various determinations of its length in terms of the -Prototype Meter No. 21, which were made previous to 1900. The length of the bar at the temperature of melting ice was there found to be 5 meters -16.2µ*. The probable error when referred to the Prototype Meter No. 21 is ±0.4µ, but when referred to the International Meter, including the uncertainties of M2 " is ±1.1µ, or one part in 4 500 ooo. While this result was entirely satisfactory, the standardization of a similar bar for the Government of Japan, by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, made the opportunity for a very desirable check on the constancy of B, 7· These comparisons were made in July, 1900, by Mr. L. A. Fischer, of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures. The Japanese 5-meter steel bar is identical in form and material with B,,. but has not the defect of having defining lines of unequal width,t these being, on the contrary, of uniform and equal width on the Japanese bar. A determination of the length of this bar, designated as J, was made to depend, first, upon comparisons with B, 7 , and second, upon comparisons with Prototype Meter No. 21. Nine comparisons with B, 7 , five with B,7 direct, and four with it reversed (turned end for end), ·gave the value of Jin terms of M.,. J=5M.,-22µ±0.5µ.
*The separate values for B, 7 in the sense A-e11d right or A-end left were neglected for this work as too small and uncertain to be taken into account and no attention was paid to reversing the bar; t As described on page 340, Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892.

244

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

Eight direct comparisons with M., in the manner fully described in sections 13 and 14 of Appendix No. 8, Report for 1892, were made with the resulting value of J in terms of l\1 J=sM.,-24.5µ±1.04µ.
2 ,,

This result would indicate that the old value for B, 1 is too large by 2.5µ, or one part in 2 ooc ooo, but when judged in the light of the probable errors no snch conclusion can be reached. Viewed as a check this result is eminently satisfactory, and if weighted according to its probable error it would have little effect on the adopted length.
THE SHELTON 100-1\IETER CO:\IPARATOR.

This comparator was a line 100 meters long, prepared for measurement with the iced-bar apparatus. Nineteen well-seasoned pine posts, r""8 long and 15c"' by 15c"' in cross section, to hold the intermediate microscopes, were set firmly in the ground with 0"'·9 projecting. The posts were accurately aligned and spaced with their centers 5'" apart, and the tops were sawed to the same horizontal plane. The ends of the line were marked by spherical-headed brass bolts cemented into the top of limestone blocks of peculiar shape designed to give them great stability in the direction of the line. These end monuments were 76c"' deep with a base 76c"' by 2dm and top 20"" by 20<'" (see illustration No. 2). They were set on a thin layerof gravel and rammed into position with the long side parallel to the line of the comparator. The end microscopes were mounted on heavy plates bolted to wooden piers constructed from four posts like the intermediate posts, well framed together (see illustration No. 3). Alongside of the posts three sections of portable track were moved along the line with the progress of the measurement and supported on posts set midway between the microscope posts. The site was chosen for the comparator by the writer in the level pasture of Mr. Joseph Owens, nearly a mile west of the town of Shelton, Nebr., and near Shelton East Base. It is parallel to the baseline and distant only about 30 meters from it. The stability of these posts, piers, arid stones may be inferred from the measures of the comparator interval which follow.
RESULTS OF :MEASURES OF THE SHELTON COMPARATOR INTERVAL.

A detailed description of the iced-bar base apparatus, with instructions for its use and specimens of record and computation, may be found in Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892, pages 338 to 350. Illustration No. 4 shows the apparatus in use on the Shelton comparator, and illustration No. 5 shows the method of aligning the bar in its trough horizontally, using a striding level resting on plugs about a meter apart. The speed of measurement varied only slightly from 10om per hour, although single measures of the comparator interval were recorded in 50 minutes. The alignment of the bars in the vertical was accomplished by mounting a theodolite in the line of the end microscopes and bringing the intermediate microscopes into position as each was adjusted. Cut-off cylinder No. 1 was used at both ends of.the line and its length was 1111 .01, and the value of the level 2".43. The end microscopes A and B, now called Nos. 1 and 2, have a value of one turn equivalent to 72.06µ and 71.2µ, respectively. The intermediate microscopes now numbered 3, 4, 5, and 6 have a value of one division equal to r µ.

The distance between the terminal spheres of the Shelton comparator was measured times with B, 7 in melting ice, beh\:een July 26 and August IO. A measure as here designated means a determination of the' comparator interval with readings both before and after the interchange of observers in reading on the ends of the bar. This interchange was made in all cases whether the observers were Fischer and Baldwin. as on the first two days, or Fischer and Bowie, as on the last three days. Table No. 1 gives all the data for the length of the comparator. The first and second columns give the date and time of day of observations. The third column gives the direction ii1 which the measure proceeded. The fourth column gfres the results for the length from the single measures after the correction for the length of B, 7 has been applied, ( 20) ( - 16. 2 µ), and the fifth column gives the mean result for the day.

DISClJSSION OF RESULTS OF THE SHELTON COMPARATOR MEASURES.

An inspection of these results shows no movement of the terminal spheres during the entire period and therefore a constant length for the comparator. The inspection also shows a decided tendency toward a large result when measuring away from the sun. In considering this peculiarity it must be remembered that the practice followed throughout these measures was to shade the microscopes and iron caps which supported them while they were holding the measure. As soon as the microscope is shaded the side of the iron cap toward the sun begins to cool rapidly and the microscope begins to move toward the sun. The effect of this will be that, when the measurement proceeds toward the sun, too short a length for the comparator interval will be obtained, and vice versa. As there is no exception on the five days to this tendency, and as the observations made when the sun was farthest from the meridian show it most decidedly, it is apparent that a measure in each direction with the sun in the same position is necessary for a correct determination of the comparator interval. The probable error of a single measure of roo meters with this apparatus, when the entire comparator was protected from the sun, has been with various observers as follows:·
'
tnni.

At Holton (see Report for 18<)2, Part II, p. 399) .............................. ±0.061 At Washington (see "Transcontinental Triangulation," p. 193) ................ ±0.030 At Washington (see" Transcontinental Triangulation," p. 194) ................ ±0.038

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPOR1, 190r.

The residual from the mean, in the case of the tenth determination, exceeds five times the mean of these probable errors and would become a subject for rejection if the evidence of the sun's effect should be neglected. Moreover, the result for the length of the comparator interval will be 100 meters +22""".30 whether the mean be taken by days or individually. The evidence is sufficient to show that each value in column 5 of Table No. l must be accepted ~s a single observation for the reason that it is necessary to take the mean of two consecutive measures in opposite directions to eliminate the effect of movement of microscopes. From the residuals from column s of Table No. l the probable error of the mean was deduced, ±o'"'".02, an~ the probable error of each value, ±0"" .04.

THE

SEGUI~

100-METER COMPARATOR.

This comparator was a line JOO meters long prepared for measurement with the iced-bar apparatus in exactly the manner previously described for the Shelton loo-meter comparator. The site of the comparator was chosen by the writer in the pasture of Mr. Henry Soefje, 8 miles north of the town of Seguin,· Tex. The line of the comparator is nearly parallel to the Seguin Base Line, about JOO meters south of it and l kilometer from East Base. The terminal monuments were similar to those already described for the Shelton comparator except that they were of granite.
RESULTS OF MEASURES OF THE SEGUIN COMPARATOR INTERVAL.

The distance· between the terminal spheres of the Seguin comparator was measured five times with B, 7 in melting ice between January 14 and 16. The new cut-off cylinder No. 2 was used here for the first time. It was used at the east end of the line with a length of l'".04, while No. l was used at the west end with a length of l"'.07. No. 2 carries a level with one division equivalent to 2".33, and is similar to No. 1 except that its millimeter scale is extended to permit a reading of 12'"'. The three measures on January 14 and 15 were made with Baldwin and Bowie observers, interchanging between ~he first and second readings on the ends of the bar in each position. In the measures of January 16 observers Baldwin and Leland exchanged in the same manner. Table No. 2 gives the data for the length of the comparator. The results for the length of the comparator in the fourth and fifth columns is given after the application of the correction for the length of twenty bars of B, 1 ( - 324 µ).

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF THE SEGUIN COMPARATOR MEASURES.

The agreement of the hvo measures in opposite directions on the 15th, and again on the 16th, is so close as to show that there was very little, if any, systematic movement of the microscopes tending to make the measurements too short when proceeding toward the sun, as noted in connection with the Shelton comparator. If the small discrepancies between the two results in each pair is attributed to such a moyement of the microscopes, the movement is in the reverse direction. The explanation of the different action of the microscopes at Seguin from that at Shelton is simple when it is known that to obtain proper illumination for the microscope pointings the shade was not used during the measures of January 15, while on the 16th the day was overcast. To satisfy the instructions not to assume the comparator length a constant, the length of the comparator inter~al was assumed to have changed, and room+ 1"'m·54 was us~d as its length for any comparisons before the 14th, 100"'+1"'"'.51 between the 14th and 15th, and 1oom+ I"'m·59 between the 15th and 16th. The probable error of the direct mean ±omm.04, being the most. unfavorable to the accuracy, is adopted as the probable error of the length of the comparator used in standardizing the apparatus. The probable error of the Shelton comparator being ±omm.02, and of the Seguin comparator ±omm.04, the probable error therefore of the mean length is 1iot greater than ±o""".03. As the length of each apparatus depends on the mean of the two comparators the probable error of each hundred meters measured, in so far as the determination of the lengths of the comparators is concerned, is v(.o 3 )·+(.o 22 )'-±o"'"'.037, or one part in 2 700 ooo. The probable error ±om'".022 is the probable error of B, 7 ± r. 1µ, multiplied by 20, the number of bar lengths in 100 meters.
THE DUPLEX BARS.

The combined length of the duplex bars Nos. 15 and r 6, with their coefficients, has been determined twice since their construction. The reader is referred to United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Special Publication No. 4, ''The Transcontinental Triangulation,'' pages 191-197, for the results of these comparisons. The detertnina.tions of September, 1896, made on the 50-meter office test line after the return of the apparatus from the Salt Lake Base, might be expected to give a working length for the apparatus. No use had been made of the apparatus during the interval between that date and the Shelton determinations. However, it must be noted that the duplex contact slide apparatus was used during this comparison for the first time without protection from the direct rays of the sun. A complete description of the apparatus, by Assistant William Eimbeck, the designer, is given in Appendix No. r 1, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1897, pages 737-752. The directions for its use in the field as there stated were slightly modified as shown in the description of the field procedure given on page 252. The results from the measurement of the Salt Lake Base* showed that the lengths resulting from the use of thermometers were more accordant than those from the use of the duplex method depending entirely on the difference of expansion of the steel and brass bars. They also showed that the three partially independent results were desir*See Appendix No.

able especially as they furnish information as to the thermic behavior of the apparatus. The thermometers were therefore used throughout this work.
1'HERMOMETER CORRECTIONS.

The thermometers used in the determinations of tape lengths, and lengths of the duplex bars Nos. I 5 and r6, are the same as those used in the field measures. They are centigrade thermometers, graduated to half degrees and were read by estimation to o 0 .05. The following table gives the corrections necessary to reduce the observed readings of these thermometers to the hydrogen scale as determined by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, July 27 and October 31, 1900, and February 8, l9or. -- - - - · · - --- - - - · · - · - - --.I

On August l 1 and August 30, and again on January 15, the readings of these thermometers when packed in melting ice were determined. The only appreciable change was noted in No. 7241. which changed from o 0 .oo oil August 30 to -0°.15 on January 15, and on examining the record it was found that oil November 2 this thermometer was heated to unite a parted column, and observations after that date in comparison with others indicate such a change. In the application of the thermometer corrections the mean of the determinations by the Office of Standard \\.reights and Measures was accepted, except as noted for No. 7241. Thermometers for which only one set of corrections is shown were broken during the field season.
FIELD TRESTLES IN USE WITH THE DUPLEX APPARATUS.

The trestles which were used on the Holton, Salina, and Versailles Bases, belonging to the secondary monometallic bars Nos. 13 and r4, were again used. The cradle arms, namely, the fixed portion of the trestle above the tripod head, were found to be too weak and flexible for the double-contact pressure of the duplex bars when used with that apparatus at the Salt Lake Base.*

Before the apparatus left the Office for the work under discussion, new cradle arms with double the cross section of the old were substituted for them. A single trial of their relative flexibility was made by applying a horizontal pull at the top. This comparison showed a reduction of at least one· half in the horizontal flexure. In all other respects the trestles retained their original form. The comparisons on the loo-meter comparators were made with the bars supported on these field trestles, without footplates, exactly as they were used in the measurement of .the base lines.
SHELTON DETERMIXATION OF THE LEXGTH OF THE D'UPI,EX BARS.

Five measures of the comparator inten-al were made with the duplex bars, on four different days, and at temperatures ranging from 22° to 33° C. The atmospheric conditions were as yaried as it was possible to secure without delaying the work. The relative readings of the middle and end thermometers show that on the first measure the middle thermometer indicated a temperature about 1°.5 higher than the end thermometers, while on the second, third, and fifth measures they were close together. The contacts between the components were all made by the writer and in 'the same manner as in all previous measures with this apparatus. The ,·ertical alignment of the bars was controlled by pointing the adjusted aligning telescopes on the barrels of the end microscope as each bar was placed in position. The inclination of each bar was measured in the usual way by means of the attached sectors. Table No. 3 contains the data for the length of 20 bars of the duplex apparatus, obtained at the beginning of the season on the Shelton roo-meter comparator. The first column gives the number of the measure; the second and third, the date and hour of the day; the fourth, the direction of the measure; the fifth shows whether the face of the apparatus was up or down; the sixth gives the mean temperature as indicated by the three thermometers in each bar; the seventh and eighth, the length of 20 bars of steel minus loo meters at the temperature of observation and after reducing to the duplex temperature 26 °. 45; col mnns nine and ten furnish the same information for the brass bars; while eleven and twelve furnish the gain of brass in the 100 meters, and the consequent length of the 20 bars when the steel and brass components are of equal length. In these determinations and those at Seguin, the coefficients of expansion, l l .54µ per meter for steel, I 8. 45µ per meter for brass, and the duplex coefficient 1. 668, were used. These coefficients were determined from 32 measures of the Office 50-meter comparator in November, 1896.* The duplex coefficient is the ratio of the coefficient of expansion of steel to the difference of the coefficients of brass and steel. Necessarily it is independent of any temperature. The duplex length is the length of the bar when the steel and brass components are of equal length and at the same temperature. It is evident that the duplex length can be determined without reference to any thermometer indication by the application of the duplex coefficient to the difference between the brass and steel set-ups in the measurement of the comparator interval. When the duplex length is once known, the length of any section may be computed from the· gain of brass oYer steel as measured by the readings of the scales which show the relative positions of the --------------------*See " Transcontinental Triangulation," pp. I g6 and I 97.

brass and steel bars. This can be most readily shown by a numerical example. In the first measure, on October 16, of the west half of section 8 of the El Reno Base (see Table 6), the brass component lost during the measurement 3o"'m.84, as compared with steel. In other words, during this measure the length of 100 brass bars was 3o"'m.84 less than the lenth of roo steel bars. The length of the 100 steel bars was less than that of the 100 bars at duplex length by the duplex coefficient times 30""".84.

Tht derivation of the last two columns of Tables Nos. 3 and 4 furnishes a further illustration of the use of the duplex coefficient. The first value, -4.89, in column 11, is the +9·38 of column 7 minus the +14.27 in column 9. This value, -4.89, is b~th the difference between steel and brass set-ups and the difference between the length of 20 bars of steel and the 20 bars of brass during the measurement. The first value in the last column, namely, +1'"'".22, is +9 111 '".38-4""".89 (i.668), the factor I.668 being the duplex coefficient.
SEGUIN DETERMINATION OF THE LENGTH OF THE DUPLEX BARS.

At the conclusion of the base measures, four measures of the Seguin loo-meter comparator were made with the duplex bars. These four measures were made on two different days and in the same manner as described for the Shelton determinations. The temperature ranged from 23°. to 12° and, although the first two measures were made under a cloudless sky, the thermometers \Vere more consistent than at Shelton. The last measures were made in cloudy weather with the temperature nearly constant. Table No. 4 contains the results of these measures.

DISCUSSION' OF RESULTS OF DUPLEX COMPARISONS.

It seemed· desirable to examine the results first to discover whether or not any modification in the coefficients already adopted was necessary. If the assumed coefficients were wrong the lengths reduced to a fixed temperature should yary with the temperatures at which they were determined, or in the case of the duplex with the amount of the' scale difference. At Shelton no such grouping of the results was found. At Seguin a most satisfactory check was obt'lined. For the twenty bars of steel the mean of the two values determined at 12° only differs by 0 .06 from the mean of those at 22°.7 when reduced to 26°.45, as shown in Table No. 4. For the twenty bars of brass these two results are identical, and from the scale readings alone the two results differ only o""". r 3. As these facts showed that any change in the coefficients would be minute and not authorized by the probable error of these results, the temperature at which the steel and brass components are of equal length, called the duplex temperature, was computed from the nine comparisons on the two comparators taken as one group. The results were then reduced to this temperature, 26°.45, for the steel and brass components, and the mean result, roo"'+r .43 for twenty bars of steel and brass, has a probable error of ±0"' .05, or r part in 2 ooo ooo. Computing the length of the twenty bars independently of thermometers, we get an identical result, 100 rm"'.43, but with a probable error of ±0 ro, or r part in r ooo ooo. It should be noted that the use of the bars during the season has apparently lengthened the twenty bars of steel by omm. 14, and of brass by omm.20, but when computed independently of thermometers they seem to have shortened o"'m.04. The range in the results at Shelton being great enough to contain the entire group of results at Seguin, it is uncertain that any change has taken place. The duplex bars had not been in use since the determination of their lengths in September, 1896 1 when the lengths of the twenty steel and brass COmpone!ltS reduced to the temperature 26 o. 45 were mm .44 for steel and +2""".04 for brass. No reason has been discovered for this shortening of the brass component equivalent to 1 part in 170 ooo.

COAST AND GEODETIC SCR \'F;\' REPORT. 1901. FIELD PROCElH'RE \\'ITH THE DUPLEX BARS.

The modus operandi so carefully: described by Assistant Eimbeck on pages 763-764, Appendix No. I2, and the directions for the use of the apparatus on pages 747-751, Appendix No. Ir, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for r 897, were carefully studied. In certain particulars it was decided to modify these to suit the changed conditions and to omit many readings in order to increase the speed. On starting a measurement, the trestles having been arranged at the convenient height but in the rear of the section mark, the zero bar (No. 15 in every instance) was aligned ai1d in position "face up," the front encl of the component which is in line of the base brought over the section mark. Transit No. 149, in both direct and reversed position, was used at a distance of about 30 feet and at right angles to the bar, in referring to the section mark. The other component was then set normal, either. by the plane mirror or with the front scale, whose reading when normal was known. 1The components are said to be set normal when their fro1it agates are in the same plane normal to the bars. The bar scales on this bar were then read, recorded, and checked. The temperature was noted, and if higher or lower than the duplex temperature, 26° .45, the hrass component was shifted hackward or forward by an amount sufficient to permit the measuring of 250 meters if possible without another set-back or set-up. This was done to make as few delays as possible in the measurement. Next, the first bar of the measure was placed on the trestles and simultaneously with the rough alignment by the observer at the forward end, the rear end of the bar was raised or lowered by means of the sliding wedge. (see illustration No. 6), and securely clamped when at the correct height. The preliminary contact was then established by seizing tl1e bar under the left arm and sliding it backward bodily while the contact slides are held back and protected as much as possible with the forefinger of the left hand. The signal ''Ready for line'' was given when this approximate contact was begun, and generally with its completion the perfect alignment was completed by the forward observer, who bisected the line flag at the next section post ahead, which had previously been set five-eighths of an inch from the line, which is one-half the space between the components. It will thus be seen that one of the components traveled in the exact line of the base. The final contacts were then established between the components as quickly as possible by means of the contact screws (see illustration No. 7), and at the same time the mercurial thermometers and the inclination sectors were read and recorded. This completed the laying of the first bar. Unless a set-up or set-back of brass became necessary no more scale readings were taken until the end of the half section, usually after the layingof the hundredth bar. Next the zero bar was launched (see illustration No. 8) and carried ahead by the two men (see illustration No. 9),called "bar men," and brought into line and contact as the second bar of the measure. The inclination sectors were read, checked, and recorded, and the thermometers again read and recorded. On the third bar and until the ninth was reached the thermometer readings were omitted, the mean temperature from eight sets not differing- materially from that from twenty. . The observer in charge of the trestles spaced them and made them stable. The gain in speed over former bar measures was in a great n~easure due to the observer aligning the trestles simultaneously with the rough bar alignment. so that when he

finally left the bar it was certain that the trestles ahea<l were in line. He then went to the front trestle, and by sighting under the fixed bar set its roller at the general grade of the ground. This enabled the forward bar man to immediately clamp his forward trestle and assist in the work at the rear trestle. At the conclusion of the measurement of 250 meters (or a quarter section), and at 750 meters, the bars were both reversed with care but no scale readings were made unless a shift of brass was required to equalize the amount of projection of the components beyond the protecting case. At the end of the half section, where a stop was usually made, the forward agate of the steel component was referred to the ground and the scales of the last bar were read and checked. The brass component was then shifted to normal with steel, the scales read, and the bars left standing. On resuming the measure the front agate was referred to the ground mark and the start made as described for the beginning of the section. \Vhen transferring to the ground the readings were never made on a scale, but the end of the measurement was presenred by a mark on a copper tack so that the set-ups (or set-backs) could be checked at any time with a quarter-meter scale and dividers.
RESULTS OF DUPLEX :\IEASl!RES OF XINE TEST KILO:\IETERS.

One kilometer of each base called the lest kilometer was mea,sured once with the duplex bar apparatus and once with each of the four steel tapes. The duplex measures of these nine test kilometers, the first of them made August l and 2, 1900, and the last January 5, 1901, will first be treated. Table No. 5 contains the data resulting from these measures. The first column gives the name of the base; the second the date; the third the mean temperature as indicated by six thermometers, whose bulbs were midway between the components; the fourth and fifth the temperature at the beginning and end of each half section; the sixth the length of the section computed independently of the thermometers; the seventh the length from the steel bars in conjunction with the thermometer readings; the eighth the length from the brass bars and thermometers; while in the ninth and tenth are the differences between the results, steel minus duplex, and brass minus steel, respectively.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM DUPLEX MEASURES.

An inspection of the results in Tables :Nos. 5 6, and 7 reveals one specially important feature of the results from duplex, steel, and brass, namely, that they are always arranged in a certain order, with the result from steel between that from duplex and that from brass. Moreover, the differences, steel minus duplex· and brass minus steel, bear a fixed relation to each other. This mean ratio in the case of
1

Table No. 5 is

S-D

ir-s= r.67,

and in Table No. 6

= r.66,

and the indi\'idual values of

this ratio in the tables agree closely with this mean. Under the section Temperature errors ef !lie duplex measures (p. 291) this discussion is continued at some length. At this point it is deemed sufficient to compute the probable error of a single measure from the double measures of each section, first neglecting the thermometers, second using the steel bars with the thermometers, and third the .brass bars with the thermometers. The probable error of a single measure of a mean section (543 meters)in Table No. 6 becomes ±1 "".o for duplex, ±1 "'.2 for steel, and ±1"'"'.7 for brass. In Table :No. 7 ( 92I meters) these probable errors increase to ± 1 2 for duplex, ±1"'"'.7 for steel, and ±2"'m.6 for brass. The weights assigned '""ere inversely proportional to the squares of the probable errors derived from Table No. 7, namely: For duplex 10, for steel 5, and for brass 2~ A weighted mean, derived in the same manner as in Table No. 7, can now be taken and adopted for the duplex lengths of the nine test kilometers ,;hown in Table No. 5, as follows:

As a further check on the values adopted for the coefficients of expansion, the relative results on section 6 of the Seguin Base and section 6 of the Shelton Base should be noted. The lowest temperatures of the season were encountered on the section at Seguin, with the result that on the first measure, when the total rise of temperature was 3 °. 3, the result from brass was 2 1111" above the duplex, but on the second measure, when the total fall of temperature was o 0 .8, the result from brass was l"'m.5 lower than the duplex. On the west half of section 6 at Shelton the temperature was practically constant, and 25 ° above that on the Seguin section, but the duplex and brass differ only o""". 3. Therefore the coefficients can not be appreciably in error.
THE STEEL TAPE APPARATUS.

The 100-meter tapes Nos. 85 and 88 were used in the measurement of the Holton and St. Albans base lines in 1891 and 1892. Their cross section is 6mm·34 by 0 111111 .47, and the weight per meter of length was 22.32 grams originally, and had decreased to 22.29 for T 8 and 22.07 for T 88 when tested after the completion of the nine bases under s ' discussion.

S. Doc. 50--1 7

COAST AND GEODETIC SCR VEY REPORT, r90r.

The so-meter tapes Nos. 247 and 248 were cut from a steel ribbon of the same approximate cross section as the 100-meter tapes. They are about s 11n.o meters in length, and No. 247 weighs 21.8 grams per meter, and No. 248 20.9 grams. Instead of graduations ruled on the tape itself there are end graduations ruled on silver sleeves riveted to the tape. These tapes carry no intermediate graduations. The tape stretchers used to give tension and alignment to the tape are described and illustrated on pages 414 and 41s of Appendix No. 8, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892. The spring balance attached to the stretcher was similar to the one there described, except that it was a metric balance reading directly to 2s grams, and which could be easily held to 12 grams. Only one stretcher was used, the end of the tape being held by a simple staff in the rear. As a tension of 1 s kilograms was applied to the tape, the breaking link could safely be omitted, because there was little danger of a tension over IS kilograms being applied in carrying and manipulating the tape. A strip of cotton cloth, which would not twist, was substituted for the breaking link. The thermometers, which have already been described, were tied in a horizontal position, with their metal backs in contact with the tape, and about 1 meter from the marking sleeve. A comparison of thermometers attached in this way with thermometers whose bulbs ·were inclosed in steel sheaths was made in October, 1897, on the so-meter office test line, and continued through twenty-four hours. The thermometers with protected bulbs were hung with these bulbs at the height of the tape alongside those tied to the tape, as described. The length of the tape from thirty-seven determinations, as indicated by the thermometers with protected bulbs, was onun.08 less than that from thirtyeight determinations with thermometers tied to the tape. Moreover, the maximum residual was omm.so (and four residuals exceeded o"'m.40) in the first case and only omm.28 in the second, while. the signs of corresponding residuals from the two sets of thermometers '\Vere nearly always the same. The o"u".08 showed that the indicated temperatures differed o 0 · IS centigrade, and the residual om"'. so is equivalent to 0°.92 in temperature. \Vhen in use for measuring a line or for a determination of its length, the tape was supported at equal intervals of 2s meters throughout its length. The intermediate supports consisted of steel wire nails driven into 2 by 4 inch stakes set at these intervals along the line. These support nails were ranged into a straight line for any tape length by means of one telescope of the binoculars brought to the right height at the forward end of the tape (see illustration No 10). At the forward end the tape was supported and aligned over the marking stake by the tape stretcher. These marking stakes were wooden posts 4 by 4 inches in cross section, securely driven to the proper height and with the top surface about parallel with the surface of the ground. Instead of the zinc plates, as used at Holton, copper strips* ssn"" by 11 nun and with a thickness of I nun .4 were nailed 011 top of these posts parallel to the line of the base and distant from it half the width of the marking sleeve of the tape. The height of these strips brought their top surfaces into the plane of the marking sleeve and allowed the tape graduation to be prolonged onto this strip by means of a sharp awl and without the use of a try-square. The rear-end graduation of the tape was supported and held by a plain staff and brought into coincidence with these successive marks.
*These strips were first used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the writer in 1897, on :the Versailles Base.

WITH THE STEEL TAPES.

The marking and support stakes for the measuement were ranged out and adjusted beforehand .. For this alignment an 8-inch theodolite was used. The measurements were all made at night. Eight men for the so-meter tapes and twelve for the ioo-meter tapes were used when possible in the measurement.* A description of the personnel for measuring with the so-meter tapes will suffice for the roo-meter tapes when four extra men are added to carry the tape ahead. There were required two observers, one at the front and one at the rear encl of the tape, who also read the thermometers, and the observer at the front end helped to carry the tape ahead; one recorder, who also furnished the light for reading the tension and led the party to the next marking post ahead; two men to apply the tension at the front end and hold it in the rear; and three men to handle lamps and carry the tape ahead. The cooperation of the observers was secured by word of mouth, passed along by the man in the center when the wind was unfavorable. \Vhen the stretcher at the front end had brought his balance to the proper height and nearly to the proper reading the observer at the front encl called "Tension." As soon as the rear-end observer had adjusted the rear-end graduation of the tape to coincidence with the proper mark on the copper strip he called "Contact." The tension was made perfect, and when the position of the front graduation had been marked he called ''All done,'' and both observers read the thermometers. The thermometer readings were repeated by the recorder when he entered them in the record. The observer at the front end unhooked the tape from the balance, and at the command "Come ahead" each carried 'the tape above his head as it was moved to the next marking stake. The mean speed attained in this process was 2 kilometers per hour and a single kilometer was measured in IS minutes. The copper strips were put iti position when the marking tables were set and aligned. When a displacement, called set-up or set-back, became necessary- or desirable by reason of the expansion or contraction of the tape, a new mark was made and noted by the recorder. By daylight these set-ups and set-backs were measured with a quarter-meter scale and dividers. The record of the tape measures consisted, for each tape .length of the designation of that tape length with the corresponding readings of thermometers, and a record of the set-ups and set-backs, with an occasional record of the time and weather conditions.
METHOD OF DHTERl\IINING LENGTHS OF TAPES.

The lengths of the 100-meter and 50-meter tapes were determined by measuring the interval of the ioo-meter c01pparntor, already described, in the same way as any similar section of the base was measured, except that with the end microscopes paintings were made on the end graduations of the tape, after n;aking the readings on the cut-off (see illustration No. 13). The tape stretcher was mounted on a section of the car track and the graduated surface of the tape brought into the focus of the microscope, while the rear encl was s0 fixed in position by tying it to a fixed staff that its graduation could be observed. The tapes were supported at intervals of 2s meters in the focal plane of the microscopes.
*It was seldom possible to use this number without delay to the leveling, and eight men were often used when measuring with the 100-meter tapes and only six with the so-meter tapes.

:z6o

COAST AND GEODETIC SCR VEY REPORT, r90r.

The thermometers were tied to the tape in the mann~r described for the actual base measurement. When the tape was put under tension on its supports and aligned it was first brought to focus under the microscopes. At the signal ''Ready'' from the observer at the. front end both observers made pointings, and at the word '' Contact'' from the rear observer (see illustration No. I4), the front observer calling ''Finished,'' the thermometers were immediately read and recorded. The observers then exchanged places, each checking the other's micrometer reading on arriving at the new position. These pointings were repeated and one determination of the tape length was completed, depending on two sets of readings and thermometer indications. The programme for the so-meter tapes was necessarily modified. A mark on the usual copper strip was made in the center of the comparator and a contact made by an observer as at the rear end of the tape in actual measurement. To relieve a man from holding contact here a staff that could be swung out of the way was provided, and after the tension had been applied the final contact was obtained by driving a small wedge alongside this staff (see illustration No. IS). When the tape was under tension and the contact made perfect by the observer in the center of the comparator (or rear end of the tape) a pointing was made on the graduation, the reading recorded, and both thermometers were read. The observers exchanged places and the same operation was repeated. The tape was then moved to the other end of the comparator, the tension applied at the opposite end of the comparator, and the same exchange of observers occurred here. A single determination qf a double tape length was thus obtained, which depended on four contacts, four microscope pointings, and eight thermometer readings. The standard tension adopted for all the steel tapes was IS.O kilograms. Before it left Washington, spring balance No. 100 was set in accordance with determinations by the Weights and Measures Office so as to give a correct tension of cs kilograms when in a horizontal position, and was carefully kept throughout the season as a standard. The working balances were tested by this one at the beginning of each night's work and at its close, if the index reading showed that a new comparison was desirable. In February, after tqe return of the party from the field, a new determination by the Office of.Weights and Measures showed that at the close of the season a tension in excess of 15 kilograms had been applied, amounting to 33 grams. This extra tension means that on the last measures the derived length for the 100-meter tape or double so-meter tape is omm.08, or one part in I 250 000, too great. To avoid the labor of distributing this amount through the season, one-half this quantity was added to the ~ength from the Shelton and one-half subtractec;l from the length from the Seguin comparisons.
DETERMINATION OF LENGTHS OF TAPES.

The first column of Tables Nos. 8, 9, Io, and II contains.the date; the second the time of· day; the third the mean temperature as indicated by two thermometers; the fourth the observed length of the tape (or of two tapes in the case of the so-meter tapes); the fifth the residuals in the sense of computed minus observed value, which result from the equations of the tapes deduced later, and the sixth, the remarks as to location and weather conditions.

In order to simplify the computation it will be assumed that there was no change in length of the tapes during the season. · It is then possible to take a mean of all the observed lengths (.x for the mean of all temperatures (IJ and leave the coefficient of expansion to be settled by a later discussion. The following values are thus derived for the four tapes from Tables Nos. 8, 9, IO, and II:

DETERMrnATION OF COEFFICIENTS* OF EXPANSION OF THE STEEL TAPES.

The coefficient of expansion for the two 100-meter tapes was determined by Prof. R. S. Woodward in I89I, at Holton, Ind., and the results found, with their probable errors, were,· for Tape No. 88, y= rmm.0914±0111111 .0032, and for No. 85, J'= r"'m.0947 ±om"'.0021. Although the probable errors were small, these coefficients, when applied to the results in Tables 8, 9, 10, and I I, are evidently too large. The discussion of the I89I results seemed to tend toward greater uncertainty and larger residuals for determinations made during the daylight hours, doubtless due to radiation effects. It had been the experience of the writer that these uncertainties of temperature during the clay were not eliminated by the protection of a shed, as on the office test line and on the Holton Ioo-meter comparator. It was therefore determined to again solve the observation equations (from the Tables v and VI omitting the day observations. From Table V there remain 26 observations on 9 different nights. These, treated in exactly the manner in which the full group of observations was originally treated, give the following equation:

By comparison with the duplex bars, on the nine test kilometers, it is possible to get still another determination of this coefficient. Using the data from the abstracts of these test kilometers, which are found in their proper places in succeeding pages, equations of the form (t-tJy+c= (l-lJ where t is the observed temperature; 1 is the mean temperature of standardization; c is an unknown, representing the constant difference between the bar length and the tape length under consideration; l is the length of a tape at the observed temperature, as given by one-tenth of the kilometer, and ( is the corresponding length x from Tables Nos. 8, 9, ro and I I, so corrected for inclinations and set-ups as to be comparable with l.

ADOPTED EQUATIONS OF TAPES.

Adopting, then, these weighted means as the respective coefficients for the four steel tapes, and using these valut>s in Tables Nos. 8, 9, IO, and l l, the residuals in the fifth column are obtained. The probable error of a single determination of a tape length (or of two tape lengths in the case of the 50-meter tapes) from these residuals becomes for T 88 , ±omm. 19; for T 85 , ±o'""'.24; for T 047 , ±o'"'".24; and for T 048 , ±0'" 15. From these residuals any change in the length of the apparatus from use during the season may be detected. Tape No 88, for instance, has a sum of the residuals at Shelton equal to +o""".32, or an average of o'""'.03, while at Seguin the residuals sum up to -o"'"'.32, or an average of -o"'"'.04. This tends to show a lengthening of the tape equal to o'"'".07, or l part in l 400 ooo. In like manner Tape 'No. 85 has an average plus residual of o"''". l 8 at Shelton and an average minus one of o"''". 27 at Seguin. This seems to be good evidence that No. 85 has increased in length om'".45, or one part in 220 ooo. However, the residuals from the test kilometers display no apparent change, and for this reason it seems desirable to accept the mean. The residuals for Ko. 247 indicate a slight elongation of a double tape amounting to omm. IO, or 1 part in 1 ooo ooo, while No'. 248 by its residuals shows no appreciable change. The equation for each tape may now be written as follows:

SHELTON BASE LINE.

The site of the Shelton Base Line was selected in April, 1899, by Assistant F. D. Granger. It is located in the valley of the Platte River and is parallel to the Union Pacific Railroad track, between the towns of Shelton and Gibbon, in Buffalo County, Nebr. Its middle point is in latitude 40° 46' and in longitude 98° 47', and its elevation above the ocean is about 608 meters. The length of the base is approximately 7.89 kilometers and its mean azimuth is 70° 02'. The terminal markings, which are 56_.3 feet north of the north rail of the railroad track, were put in position when the line was connected with the triangulation in May, 1899. The tripods and scaffolds \Vere in place \vhen _the measuring party reached the line, so that the surface marks, consisting of copper bolts with cross lines in limestone posts 8 inches square and 2.5 feet long, were undisturbed. Since 1899 a fence, 8 feet from the line, had, been erected, which placed it in t~1e public highway for its entire length. East Base monument was used as a bench mark .in a line of precise levels run in 1899 and the connection with the \Vest Base monument was made by Prof. L. S. Smith, a member of the base line party. It would be hard to imagine a more perfect base site when considered topographically, no roo-mcter length having a difference of eleva,tion as much as a meter. The only impediment to the progress of the measurement was the team traffic along the line and the high winds encountered when measuring with the duplex bar apparatus. Several thermometer readings over 44 ° .5 C. were recorded while working with the bars. The base was divided into eight sections, five of which were r kilometer in length; the third (from East Base), 600 meters; the fifth, r 200 meters, and the sixth, r 084 meters. Between sections 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, permanent marks were established by using duplicates of the stone marking the ends of the 100-meter comparator. Instead of the brass, spherical-headed bolts, brass screws were cemented into the top surface of the stones. The other section marks were crosses in copper rivets in the top of 6 by 6 inch pine posts, set with 4 feet of their length below the surface. Sections 3 and 6 (aggregating r 684 meters) were measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus. Sections 2 and 7 (2 ooo meters) were measured in one direction with 50-meter tape No. 247 and in the opposite direction with No. 248. Sections 4, 5, and 8 (3 200 meters) were similarly measured with roo-meter tapes Nos. 85 and 88. The test kilometer, section r, was measured once with each apparatus. Of the entire base, therefore, 0.24 depends upon the length of the duplex bar apparatus; 0.23 on each roo-meter tape, and o. rs on each 50-meter tape. The fractional part of a bar length on section 6 was measured with 3-meter steel bar No. r, whose corrections are known. Table 12 contains the results of the measures of the Shelton Base.

To reduce the measured length to the sea level, the height of Shelton East Base is taken from the precise leveling as 6 r 6. l meters. The levelings of the base in July and Angust, 1900, gives the mean height of the eight sections and the corresponding reduction to sea level.

And the total reduction for the entire base becomes -o. 7684 meters. An inspection of the residuals developed Oil the test kilometer, where five apparatus are involved, in comparison with the residuals Oil the other seven sections, where but two, or in the case of the duplex but one, apparatus was used, is sufficient to decide how the probable error should be computed. The errors of manipulation are evidently very small compared with those which are constant for each apparatus. Therefore, two measures with any single apparatus are regarded as one, and from the probable error of a single measure of a kilometer section, determined from the residuals on the test kilometer, the probable error of the entire length is computed. This probable error of a single measure from the test kilometer is ±4m"'.o, aud the probable error of the whole length, therefore, is ±8" ".5.

If, on the other hand, the probable errors of the single measures had been taken from the discord of the measures on each section and each divided by the square root of the number of apparatus involved, the total probable error for the base would then become only ±2m .3, a quantity which is without doubt too small. It is quite possible that in the case of the probable error ±2mm.3 for the base, computed from the discord of the individual measures on each section, there should be added the uncertainty of the comparisons of each apparatus with the 100-meter comparator. l\'loreover, it is evident that these uncertainties are already measured in the probable error of a single measure of the test kilometer ±4 .o, and therefore should not be combined with the probable error ±8'"m.5, which is already a combination of the probable error of measurement, and the probable error of measuring the comparator interval with the different apparatus.

PAGE BASE LINE.

In the valley of the Elkhorn River north of the town of Page, in Holt County, Nebr., the site of the Page Base Line was chosen. A reconnaissance by F. D. Granger, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, in May, 1900, decided its exact location. Its middle point is in latitud~ 42° 27' and longitude 98° 24' west, and about 592 meters above the sea level. At its southwest end it attains its greatest elevation, 627 meters. There is a general slope of the ground downward toward its northeast tern1inus of nearly 46 meters. The length is approximately 8.25 kilometers, and the mean azimuth 39c .9. At 2.40 kilometers from southwest base a small ridge was crossed, on the northeast face of which the maximum grade was encountered. The correction to the 50-meter tape at this point for the 3.03 meters difference of elevation was 92. I millimeters. The major part of the line was unbroken prairie used either as pasture or meadow. Twelve barbed-wire fences and five cornfields were crossed in the measurement. The terminal marks were placed in position before the measurement began. They consist of li1nestone blocks 6 by 6 by 8 inches in dimensions, set below the surface, while blocks 24 by 24 inches and 14 inches deep, mark the stations at the surface. These monuments, securely set in cement, are lettered and have copper bolts inserted at the centers of their upper surfaces with cross lines marking the ends of the base. The

ends of the sections were marked with copper rivets in the top of 4 by 6 inch posts set at least 3 feet in the ground. Exceptions to this marking were made at each end of the "test kilometer" section 6, where limestone blocks 54 inches long, dressed to 6 b)' 6 inches at the top, carrying copper bolts with cross lines were used. After the surface monument at Southwest Base had been placed in position, it was connected with bench mark M 2 (1900), thus becoming a bench mark of the precise level line. By means of a forward and backward line the Northeast Base monument was connected with it by Aid 0. M. Leland, using precise le,·el No. 5. The base was divided into eight sections for convenience of measurement. The first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh from the southwest end are each r kilometer in length, the third r 050 meters, and the eighth r 201 meters. The first three sections were measured in one direction with one 50-meter tape and in the opposite direction with the other 50-meter tape. Sections 4 and 5 were similarly measured with the roo-meter tapes. Sections 7 and 8 were measured in each direction with the duplex bars, while section 6 became the test kilometer. Of the length o. 29, therefore, depends on the duplex bar apparatus; o. 21 on each 50-meter tape, and o. 15 on each roo-meter tape. An extra measure of section 4 with Tape No. 88 was made to detect a supposed error in the first measure. A mean of the two was accepted and no extra weight assigned the result. Table No. 13 contains the results of the measures made on the Page Base.

and the total reduction for the entire base becomes -0.7689 meters. . In the same manner as at Shelton Base the probable error of a single apparatus on a kilometer as derived from the residuals on the test kilometer is ±2" .1, and likewise the probable error of the whole base is ±4""". 7. The probable error of the base from the discord of the measures on each section is also ±4"'"'.7. Combining this probable error with the uncertainty in reduction to sea level and the length of the comparator, the adopted probable error of the whole base becomes:

The site of the Anthony Base was determined in a reconnaissance by Stehman Forney, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the summer of 1899. The base is about parallel to Bluff Creek in Harper County, Kans. Its southeast terminal is directly north of the schoolhouse in the town of Anthony and l ;1l miles from it. The northwest terminal is on land belonging to \V. W. Millican, of Thorntown, Ind., about equally distant from the towns of Anthony and Harper. The permanent marks at the base ends were put in position when the base was located. Below the surface a limestone block 6 by 6 inches in cross section and l foot long ( 21 inches long at Northwest Base) was set in concrete with its top 4 feet below the surface. Into the top surface of this post a copper bolt was secured, and the center of the station (underground) is a millimeter hole in this bolt. At the surface a hard limestone block 23 by 23 inches and 16 inches high, weighing 700 pounds, set in a mass of concrete 4 feet square and 4 feet deep, carries at the center of its top surface a bronze station mark, the millimeter hole in the center of which marks the end of the base. These station marks are made of a composition of copper and brass, and have a shank .6 long with a slit in its lower end into which a brass wedge is inserted, so that when the bolt is driven home it bulges out at the bottom of the hole, which is made

larger there than at the top, and in this manner is securely fastened in place. The top of the station mark is 80'°'" in diameter, with an inner circle (countersunk) 37mm in diameter. The letters "U. S. C. & G. S." are cast on the space between the inner and outer circles. Between the bottom of the surface monument and the bolt marking the point below the surface there is an earthenware drainpipe 7 inches in diameter and 25 inches long. This drainpipe is embedded in the upper mass of concrete and covered with a piece of gah·anized iron to prevent anything from falling on the underground mark. The latitude of the middle point of the base is 37° 11', and the longitude 98° 03'. The height of its highest point is 423 meters above the sea level, while the azimuth of the line is about 142°.5. The length is approximately 6.03 kilometers. At 2.40 kilometers and again at 2. 70 kilometers from Southeast Base the measurement crossed sharp ravines with the tape hung on tall supports 15 to 18 feet in height, and at 3.9 kilometers crossed Spring Creek. The approach to this creek from the southeast is comparatively gentle, but to leave it necessitated the breaking of the grade of the 100-meter tape length between stakes 79 and 81, where the difference in elevation on 75 meters of the length is 6.57 meters, requiring a grade correction of 96""". 1 for a 25-meter span. These sections of the line could not have been measured with any form of bar apparatus without expensive preparations. In general, the line traversed cultivated fields except at the northwest end, where there was some unbroken prairie. It was divided into six sections-sections 1, 3, and 5 being a kilometer in length; section 2, 1 052 mete~s; section 4, 996 meters, and section 7, 987 meters. Section 1, though by no means level, was used as the test kilometer, and its northwest end was permanently marked by a stone 3.5 feet long and 6 by 6 inches in cross section, set on solid rock and cemented in position with 1 f0ot of its height projecting above the surface. A cross in a copper rivet set in the stone marks the exact point. Section 2 ·was measured once with each of the 50-meter tapes. Sections 3, 4, and 5 were similarly measured with the 100-meter tapes, except that on section 3 two measures with each tape were made. Section 6 was measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus. The fractional measures-less than 5 meters-on sections 2, 4, and 6 were made with the 3-meter fractional bar No. 1. The monuments at Southeast Base and at the end of the test kilometer were used as bench marks in a precise level line ( 1900) and, incidental to the work of determining the tape grades, the pier at Northwest Base was connected with the levels during the progress of the work by Mr. R. S. Ferguson, Recorder, using precise level No. 5. Table ~o. 14 contains the results of the measures of the Anthony Base.

EI. RENO BASE J,I:s'E.

On the divide between the Canadian River and t,he North Fork of the Canadian is located the longest base in the ninty-eighth meridian triangulation-the El Reno Base. The reconnaissance by Stehman Forney, Assistant, in 1899, decided its location, an<l the terminals were permanently marked by him. It is in Canadian County, Okla., south\vest of the city of El Reno. Its middle point is in approximate latitude 35° 28 1 and longitude 98° 02 1 west and is about 425 meters above sea level. The length is 12.9 kilometers and the azimuth of the line is roughly l 10°. The western terminal is the highest point on the line, and the descent from this point is 36 meters in the first kilometer. From this point the line retains this general elevation for 7 kilometers. The last 5 kilometers are comparatively smooth, with a rise in the last kilometer of l 3 meters to East Base. 'fhe western half is broken by two sharp ravines, where 18-foot supports were needed for the 100-meter tapes. At the approach to one of these ravines on section 4 the steepest grade was encountered, where the difference in elevation in a 25-meter span was 2.85 meters and the corresponding correction for grade was l 62"'m. 7. About fifty wire fences intersect the line and two large straw piles had to be removed before the measurement was made. At r.2 kilometers from East Base the line crosses the track of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway. East Base is on the land of Mr. G. L. Newman, and the piers are similar to those described for the Anthony Base. The surface , monument is a red sandstone 2 by 2 feet iu cross section, l foot high, and .weighs 600 pounds. A bronze station mark similar to that used at Anthony in the center of this stone marks the end of the base. This mark is 48 inches above the bolt in the limestone block which marks the station below the surface. At West Base a similar monument 'on the land of Mr. J. T. Seawell marks the end of the base. It is on the summit of a prominent hill 2 }f miles south and 6U west of the Rock Island depot in El Reno. The leveling for the tape grades and for the mean height of the thirteen sections was not connected with any known bench mark. The end monuments, which are bench marks of the most permanent character, will ultimately be conneetecl with the precise level net of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The base was divided into thirteen sections, numbered from West Base. Section 7 is 444 meters, and section 9, l 450 meters long, while the other eleven sections are approximately l kilometer in length. Sections l, 2, 3, 4, and s were measured once with each 100-meter tape; sections 9, ro, r r, r 2, and l 3 were similarly measured, using· the 50-meter tapes, and sections 7 and 8 were measured in each direction with the duplex bars. Section 6 was chosen as the test kilometer, being most easily accessible from the camp, and was measured S. Doc. 50-18

with each apparatus in the usual way, except that two extra measures were made with 100-meter tape No. 88, as additional checks on the constancy of its length, but the mean of the three results used as one. The base therefore depends for its length as follows: 0.13 on the duplex bar apparatus, 0.21 on each roo-meter tape, and 0.23 on each 50-meter tape. Table No. 15 contains the results of the base measures.

During a reconnaissance by Stehman Forney, Assistant, in r 899, a site for the Bowie Base was located on the divide south of the Red River in Clay and Montague counties, Tex. It is west of the city of Bowie and south of the town of Bellevue. Its middle . point is in approximate latitude 33° 36' and very near the meridian of 98° west. The length of the line is 8. 20 kilometers and its azimuth about r 60°. The northeast terminal is r mile southeast of the town of Bellevue, in Clay County, on· a prominent knoll on the farm belonging to the Orton Brothers. It is almost exactly 6 meters below the southeast terminal which is on the highest part of a prominent ridge on the farm of C. H. Bodeker. The marks at the ends of the base are of the most permanent character. The piers at the surface and the marks underground are duplicates of those described for the El Reno.Base, with a single exception. At Northwest Base the native rock was found at 3 feet below the surface and a copper bolt in this rock was made the underground mark. Nothing unusual in the topography was encountered. Beginning at the southeast end, the lin~ falls 20 meters in the first 700 meters, rises gradually for the next kilometer, crosses several little creeks, and falls to its minimum height where it crosses a sma,11 creek at 5.7 kilometers. The heaviest grades are on section 8 approaching Northwest base, where in i 100 meters there is a rise of 27 meters. The maximum grade occurs in a 25-meter span on which the difference in elevation is 1.64 meters and the corresponding correction 54mm.o. The grades and profile were determined by leveling in duplicate with precise level No. 5, but as there were no bench marks in the immediate vicinity, the end piers pre-

serve the base height for future determinations. The height of the northwest terminal is about 3 l 7 meters above the sea level. The base was divided into eight sections, beginning at Southeast Base, the first six being l kilometer in length, the seventh l 098 meters, and the eighth l 099,meters. Sections l, 2, and 3 were measured once with each loo-meter tape. Sections 4, 6, and 8 were similarly measured with the 50-meter tapes. Section 7 was measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus. Section 5 became the test kilometer on account of its convenient location rather than its topography. The measurement of this section with the bar apparatus involved the necessity of using very heavy grades. amounting in one instance to 4° 41 1 · With the tapes, it became necessary to have a different grade for the 50-meter tape from that of the Joo-meter tape in order to cross two small ravines without. high marking stakes. The base depends for its length as follows: o. l 6 on the duplex bar apparatus; o. 2 1 on each Joo-meter tape, and o. 2 l on each 50-meter tape. Table No. 16 contains the results of all the various measures made on the Bowie Base.

The Stephenville Base was located by Stehman Forney, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the summer of l 899. It is on the eastern side of . the Bosque River, Erath County, Tex. Its southern end is about three-fourths mile west of the town of Selden, on a ridge between Indian anCl Simms creeks. It follows closely the crest of this ridge until it culminates at North Base in a prominent knoll known locally as Bunker Hill. The line is 7 miles southeast of the town of Stephenville. Its middle point has an approximate latitude of 32° 10' and is close to the ninety-eighth meridian. Its azimuth is roughly 4 ° 15' and its highest point is North Base, which is 442 meters above sea level. Its length is 6. 3 kilometers. The grades over the entire length were gentle, the maximum being l .42 meters in a span of 25 meters with a correction of
0

4m'".o.

The permanent marks at the ends of the base were put in position by the reconnaissance party in 1899. The underground marks are small drill holes in the end of copper bolts cemented into the tops of hard limestone posts. These posts are 14 inches long and 6 inches square, and are set with their tops 34 inches below the surface, with a mass of concrete 24 inches square surrounding them. Above the top of this mark the mass of concrete is 4 f.eet square, and embedded in it, at the surface, is a hard limestone block 24 inches square and 14 inches thick, weighing 600 pounds. The center of the station at the surface is secured by a metal station mark, a duplicate of that described for the marks at the Anthony Base (page 270). North Base is 5~ miles east of the Court-House in Stephenville, and a half mile north of the road leading to Skippers Gap. It is on the summit of Bunker Hill, on land belonging to Geo. W. Gentry, of Selden, Tex. South Base is located on land of Mr. Willie Funk, of Midland, Tex.,

and is near the_ public road between Stephenville and Hyco, Tex. A line cleared through the timber, made by the measuring party, will readily guide one to the station. The grades and profile of the line were determined by leveling in duplicate with precise level No. 5. There being i10 bench marks in the vicinity, the end piers preserve the height of the base for future determinations. The base was divided into six sections. Beginning at North Base, the first three were each 1 ooo meters, the fourth 1 100 meters, the fifth 1 ooo meters, and the sixth 1 156 meters in length. Sections 1 and 2 were measured once with each 100-meter tape. Sections 3 and 4 were Il)easured with each 50-meter tape. Section 6 was measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus. Section 5 was used as the test kilometer and was therefore measured once with each apparatus. The base depends for its length as follows: 0.21 on the duplex bar apparatus, 0.20 011 each 50-meter tape, and o. 19 011 each 100-meter tape.

LAMPASAS BASE LINE.

The problem of the selection of a site for a primary base along the arc of the ninety-eighth meridian near the thirty-first parallel of latitude was solved by Assistant Stehman Forney in 1899. The Lampasas Base lies across the drainage, with its northeastern terminal about 2 miles east of the city of Lampasas, in Lampasas County, Tex. The southwestern end is on the brow of a prominent hill about 2 miles south of the city and nearly a rniie west of the Austin road. The character of the topography along the line of measurement makes it the rouyhest base yet selected in the meridian arc, while its length, 6 kilometers, makes it also the slzortest. The middle point of the line is in latitude 31° 02' and its azimuth is 215°. The highest point of the base is its southwest terminal, and the difference of elevation between the two ends exceeds 66 meters. Appended to this report is a profile of the line and a sketch of the base figure.' Although this base is the roughest and shortest of the nine measured, its accuracy in proportional parts is exceeded by only two of the nine. This indicates that the principle on which the reconnaissance party acted is correct, namely, that it was more desirable to secure good geometric conditions in the base net than to get the most favorable top~5raphy for the base. \Vhile the abruptness of the grades may seem startling, the results show that such inequalities of the line- are easily surmounted when the measuring apparatus consists of loi1g tapes. The maximum grade occurs in the first section, when:: it exceeds 3. 1 meters in a 25-meter span and has a corresponding correction equal to 200111111 · For r mile at the northeast end the line required clearing, as it was covered with low, scrubby oaks. The permanent marks were already in place when the measuring party arrived. At Northeast Base, the sub-surface mark is a metal station mark, as described under the heading Anthony Base (page 270), cemented into solid rock. A similar mark in the top of a limestone block 24 by 24 inches and r 3 inches thick marks the station at the surface. This surface block is securely set in a body of concrete 48 by 48 inches, the solid rock being cut away a few inches to allow the upper surface of the block to be placed even with the ground. At the southwest terminal, the underground mark is 6 by 6 inches and 12 inches long, embedded in concrete with its top surface 24 inches below the top of the surface stone.

280

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

I9CJI.

This surface stone is of limestone and 24 inches square and I 4 inches deep. It is embedded in a mass.of concrete 48 by 48 inches, 22 inches deep. Both stones carry the station marks, the lower one being protected by a wooden box 8 inches long with a board over the top. Northeast Base is about 250 meters north of the Belton road in a pasture belonging to :\<Ir. Howard, of Lampasas, and is near the northeastern brow of a timbered hill. Southwest Base is in \Vhat is known as the Craft pasture. As no bench marks exist in the vicinity, the grades and profile were determined by leveling in duplicate with precise level No. 5 between the encl piers, which will preserve the provisional height of the base for future determination. The base was divided into six sections beginning at Southwest Base; the first, second, fifth, and sixth were each l ooo meters, the third r 449 meters, and the fourth 5 I 5 meters in length. Sections 1 and 2 were measured once with each 50-meter tape; sections 3 and 6 once with each · 100-meter tape; section 4 was measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus. Section 5 became the test kilometer, and was measured once with each of the tapes and once with the duplex bar apparatus. The base depends for its length as follows: 0.12 on the duplex bar apparatus; 0.24 on each loo-meter tape, and o. 20 on each 50-meter tape.

About 7 miles south of the town of Alice, in Nueces County, Tex., the Alice Base Line was located in 1899 by Assistant Stehman Forney. Its middle point is in latitude 27° 46 1 near the ninety-eighth meridian, and its azimuth is approximately 90°. The height of the base above sea level is approximately 64 meters, and its length 7 kilometers. The line is smooth, traversing pasture land covered with scattering mesquite brush and cactus. There is a very gradual slope from west to east, amounting to but 9.44 meters in the whole length of the line. The terminals were perpetuated in the same manner as at Lampasas Southwest Base, and these piers were made bench marks for future connection with the level net of the United States. The West Base pier is only 300 meters from the house of Luciano Garcia, to whom the land belongs, and is 3 888 meters west of the center of the Alice and Brownsville stage road. There are no prominent objects in the vicinity of East Base, which is 3 083 meters east of the center of the stage road. The base was divided into seven sections, beginning at the east end. The first four and the last two sections are each I kilometer long, while the fifth is 97 1 meters. Sections 1, 2, and 3 were measured once with each 100-meter tape, sections 6 and 7 were measured once with each so-meter tape, section s was measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus, while the test kilometer, section 4, was measured once with each of the tapes and once with the duplex bar apparatus. The base depends for its length as follows: o. 17 on the duplex bar apparatus, o. 24 on each 100-meter tape, and o. 17 on each so-meter tape. Table No. 19 contains the '!'"esnlts of the measures made on the Alice Base.

SEGCIN BASE UNE.

The site of the Seguin Base Line was chosen in 1899 by Assistant Stehman Forney, in the valley of the Guadalupe River, in Guadalupe County, Tex. It is about midway between the cities of Seguin and New Braunfels and on the east side of the river. Its middle point is in latitude 29° 40' and its eastern terminal is very near the meridian of 98 °. The height of the base above sea level approximates 165 meters, and its length is 6.8 kilometers. While lying at right angles to the course of the drainage, the entire range in the elevations along the line is less than 14 meters. The maximum grade was 3.56 meters in 50 meters, necessitating a correction of r 27'"m.o. The western terminal is on a small hill, co;,ered with scattering mesquite brush, on the land of Henry Steinman, l 100 meters west of the Seguin-New Braunfels road and about 400 met~rs east of the Guadalupe River. The eastern terminal is on the land of Henry Soefje, at the western edge of the live-oak timbe1' about 2 miles northwest of Von Beckman's store and gin. It is r 050 meters east of the main road between Von Beckman's and New Braunfels, and the line crosses the road at the northwest corner of Mr. Soefje's dooryard. During the year, between the location of the base and its measurements an enterprising farmer erected a barn directly on the line l 464 meters from west base, but being on a slope where the line of sight was not interrupted, it was a simple matter to remo\'e a board on the. line and measure with the tape through the barn. Twenty-six fences, most of them of barbed wire, were crossed by the line. The permanent marks were put in position when the location was chosen and are similar to those described for the Anthony Base (p. 270), with the exception that at East Base the underground mark is a copper bolt cemented into the natural sandstone rock about 32 inches below the surface. The mass of concrete in which the capstone was set was kept clear of the bolt by means of a box 9 inches square. The base was divided into seven sections, beginning at West Base, sections l, 2, 5, and 7 being each 1 kilometer in length, section 3, 700 meters, section 4, 1 200 meters, and section 6, 895 meters in length. Between sections 6 and 7 and on the line a hole in the top of a stone post 6 by 6 by 1 2 inches and o. 6 meter below the surface sen· es as a witness mark for the recovery of the eastern terminal. The other section marks were copper rivets in 4 by 6 inch posts securely set in the ground. Sections l, 2, and 3 were measured once with each 50-meter tape and section 4 similarly measured using the roo-meter tapes. Sections 6 and 7 were measured in each direction with the duplex bar apparatus, and i-;ection 5 was adopted as the test kilometer, and a single measure with each tape and the par apparatus was made over it. It was impracticable to connect the terminal monuments with any precise level bench marks, and the surface monuments were therefore left to preserve the provisional height of the base for future connection with the precise level net of the Sun'ey. The connection between the two terminals was made in duplicate (by running in each direc-

COAST AXD GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, i901.

tion) using precise level No. 5, as such leveling was necessary to determine the tape grades a~ well as the mean height of the base. The base depends for its length as follows: 0.31 on the length of the duplex bar apparatus, 0.23 on each 50-meter tape, and o. 12 on each roo-meter tape. Table No. 20 contains the results of the measures of the base.

To aid the reader in judging the value and extent of the work accomplished in this field season of six months a brief summar~ is added. Bm whose length when immersed in melting ice was known with a probable error of 1 part in 4 500 ooo, became the unit of length for all these measures. From this unit of length two 100-meter comparators were prepared, 750 miles apart, and their lengths determined with an average probable error of I part in 2 700 ooo. Five sets of apparatus were determined on each of these comparators, with an werage probable error of approximately I part in 2 ooo ooo. The nine base lines here tabulated were measured in such a way that on the average one-fifth of each base depends on the length of each apparatus~ ----------- · - - - - - - - ··---·------·----.

These bases, aggregating 69. 2 kilometers, with an average length of 7. 7 kilometers, have an average probable error of 1 part in 1 200 ooo, \vhich was attained without the expenditure of either time or money in excess of that necessary for the lesser accuracy required by the instructions, namely, r part in 500 ooo. They, in connection with the Salina Base of the transcontinental triangulation, control the lengths on r 100 miles of the arc of the ninety-eighth meridian.
COST OF THl:o; HASE LIN.E MEASURE:\IENTS.

It is now deemed advisable to show the total cost of the work which has just been summarized. The total amount expended for field expenses was $7 5 Ir. 65. These field expenses include all items of transportation, freight, etc., beginning and ending in Washington, all material, camp equipage, and pay and subsistence .of entire 'party,

286

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

except salaries of officers. Adding the pay of the officers, which is the only item of expense not included in the field expenses, $2 546.84,* there results$ro 058.50, which is the entire amount expended for field expen,<>es on the nine bases. Approximately 25 per cent of the $7 500 was spent for transportation of the party and outfit by train and wagon, but this proportion of necessary travel and freight would have been considerably greater if all the bases had not been measured in one season's work. The cost of preparing the results for printing, including all computations made at the Office, $r ,or6. 28, would bring the total cost of the bases to $rr,074.78, which would be $1,230.53 per hase, or $r6o per kilometer. The above amounts include all the cost of standardizing the apparatus.
SPEED ATTAINED WITH BARS AND TAPES.

The actual speed of measurement during this season can be most readily shown in tabular form. In Table No. 2 r all the bar measurements where 400 meters or more were measured consecutively have been tabulated. In column 3 there is shown the total time which elapsed between the completion of the reference to the ground mark at the start and the beginning of the reference at the end of the section. In column 6 the average number of bars per hour for each of the seven months in which measurements were made is shown. In Tables Nos. 22 and 23 similar information is tabulated for the roo-meter and 50meter tapes. In columns 5 and 6 the speed is expressed in kilometers per hour.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901. ERRORS OF THE DUPLEX MEASURES.

At the conclusion of his consideration* of the behavior of the duplex bar apparatus the designer says: '' The duplex may be regarded as equally perfect and efficient both as a bimetallic and a thermometric apparatus.'' This conclusion was necessarily based on results from the use of the apparatus when fully protected from the sun and wind by means of the ''Salt Lake sled,'' which was a movable tent. The errors which were not apparent under these ideal circumstances must now be considered as well as errors which may have been in those measures and which are indicated by the additional evidence of this season. There was, during all of the duplex bar measurements of 1900-01 now under discussion, no protection from the wind or from the direct rays of the sun except when an umbrella was held to shade the contact ends to enable the observer to see the contact lines more clearly. The three sources of error described by Assistant Schott (p. 200, ''Transcontinental Triangulation '') can here be neglected as practically nil. The first, due to the push of the contact slide spring at the time of contact, was diminished to less than one-half by the strengthening of th~ cradle arms, page 249. Furthermore, the pressure of the springs was throughout the season the same during the base measures as during the standardization. The same trestles were used in the standardization measures, at about the average height used on the bases, and any push of the contact springs would have had the same effect on the .duplex measures of the comparator intervals as they had on the field measures of the bases. Finally, the springs were used with much less strength than heretofore, being only strong enough to insure a contact between the agates when in use. No oil was applied to these contact slides, and in consequence very little trouble from an accumulation of dirt was encountered even on the days when the wind and dust were troublesome. As to the second source of error, due "to the wear of the knife edges during the season, the restandardization at the end of the season revealed no such wearing away, or an amount so small as to be absorbed in the errors of standardization. Formerly such wear was plainly rliscernible in the blunt appearance of the knife edges, whereas, at the conclusion of this season the agate knife edges presented the same appearance under the microscope as at the beginning of the season. The third source of error is that due to the change in position of the components relative to the point of support of the metallic casing during the time of laying the bar. This source of error was rendered less effective by increasing materially the rapidity of the base measure, and by reading thermometers at the time of contact at the front end of the bar instead of at the rear, as has been the practice heretofore. · It is evident that the change in the time of reading the thermometers affects only the results from the bars as a thermometric apparatus. The amount of this error is dependent on the rate of change of the temperature and on the manner of yielding of the trestles. Its effect on the duplex result may be readily computed, if we assume that the friction on the roller is so great as to preclude the possibility of the brass casing of the bar advancing on the roller with the small increases in temperature. In other words, the center of expansion of the hr~ casing is at the center of the bar instead of at the knife edge of the rear trestle. The

sted and brass components are held against the rear end of the casing by springs at a point 2.44 meters from the center of the bar. Between the beginning of any measure and the end, an increase of temperature of the brass casing will pull back the front end of the bars an amount equal to the expansion of the brass casing for this 2.44 meters and for the whole range of temperature during the measure. As an example: During the measure of the test kilometer at Shelton, p. 2s4, the temperature rose 23° .3. The correction to the measured length of the kilometer from this source of error would be: corrn. = - .000018s (2.44) 23.3 = - Imm.OS Thus, in one of the most extreme cases of the season, the error fr'?m this source is only one part in a million. At this point it should be noted that the accuracy is greater for the thermometric results than for the duplex result, when only the measures of the comparator interval are considered. In the actual measures the probable errors for a single duplex measure of a mean section of S43 meters (Table No. 6)was ±1""".o, from which would be expected a corresponding probable error of ± _/I.~ mm., or ±o"'m. 43 for any section 1oo meters long. v S·43 In a similar manner from the probable error of a single duplex measure of a mean section 12 of 921 meters (Table No.7), equal to ±rmm.2, we would expect±- -- -'. mm., or± om"'-40 ._/9.21 for any section roo meters long. The probable error of such a single measure actually deduced from the nine observations on the loo-meter comparators in Tables Nos. 3 and 4 was ±omm. 30. Let the probable error of the steel be treated in the same manner, and the probable error of a single measure of roo meters from the nine observations on the comparators is S·43 7 mm. or ±om'.".s6. Treating the probable from sections 92r meters long is± /r. v 9.2r errors of the brass in the same manner, the three. corresponding probable errors are ±omm. rs, ±omm.73, and ±omm.86. The only conclusion possible from these figures is that the results from the duplex follow closely the laws of the accidental errors, the probable errors increasing but little faster than the square root of the lengths. With the steel and brass it is quite different. In the case of the steel, the errors increase very closely as the length, while with the brass the errors increase more rapidly than the length. The evidence of systematic or constant errors is therefor greatest in the results from brass and steel, while the duplex result is apparently not entirely free from such errors.

The discussion of the results shown in detai~ in Tables Nos. s, 6, and 7 may now be resumed. It is certainly true that the part of the accidental errors which would affect the measure from brass differently from that of steel, such as faulty contacts, a lack of contact between either set of components, and errors in reading and setting the scales S-D on which the set-ups and set-backs are measured, would make the ratio B-S vary from its mean value r.67 (seep. 2s7). Referring to Tables Nos.sand 6, we may see that in

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl:RVEY REPORT, 19cn.

the fifty-three sets of differences there displayed, in not one case is there a reversal of sign (S-D is always plus when B-S is plus) even when these differences are less than o"'m.5, and in all the results of the duplex bar measures (see Tables Nos. 5 and 6) there is not a single case in which a correction of less than om"'. 2 to one of the results will not produce exactly the ratio 1. 67. This feature can hardly fail to surprise anyone familiar with the use of any measuring bars where the contact slide is involved, and when it is remembered that from 200 to 400 contacts are involved. Attention should here be called to the fact that this peculiarity of the ratio also checks the computation. For instance, if one tries to compute the length of a section, where 199 bars had been laid, as if it had been an entire kilometer, the result from the scale reading (the gain or loss of brass over steel) would be so wild as to detect an error at once. Again, suppose an error equivalent to o 0 · 1 centigrade or more was made in reducing the length of the steel from the mean temperature to the temperature of observation, the changed ratio would detect the error. As a curicus example of this, the reader is referred ,to the "abstract of field results" on the Salt Lake Base (p. 774 of Appendix No. 12, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1897), where the observer rejected the result from the duplex on the second measurement of Section VI in computing the probable error, doubtless because the residual was suspiciously large. An examination of the ratio shows something obviously wrong in the value of the . S-D ratio ----- = 9802-9779 = 10.5. But the office computation showed that an error had B-S 9804-9802 been made in the field computation of the length from the steel component, and that the rejected duplex value was correct. An inspection of the results of the Salt Lake Base (pp. 198 and 199 of the "Transcontinental Triangulation") reveals this same ratio, even when the bars were carefully protected from inequalities of weather. The correction to preserve exactly this ratio

~-::~ = 1.67

in any one of

t~e

twenty-two single measures would not exceed o"'"'.2.

These results, in conjunction with those of this season, make up all that have been obtained with the duplex bar apparatus. It is obvious, therefore, that the accidental errors which affect the two components differently, such as faulty contacts, errors of reading scales, etc., are of a much smaller magnitude than those which affect the bar as a whole, such as are due to transfer measures, the inclination of the bars, etc. What 'then has been the effect of removing the protection (movable tent) and subjecting the bars to steep gradients (even e:xceeding 4° .J.o') in all conditions of weather? In tbe Salt Lake measures the probable error of a single measure of a section ( 1 ooo meters) is for the duplex ±1" 14, and for the steel and brass somewhat less, but on the thirteen sections (averaging 92 1 meters) measured during the past season, on the nine different lines, the probable error of a single measure of a section is very little greater for the duplex, ± 1m'".2, but the probable errors from steel and brass increased to± 1 7 and ±2'""'.6, respectively. It is the opinion of the writer that a computation of the Salt. Lake measures by half sections, where the temperature was in one case rising and in the other falling, would show probable errors much more favorable to the duplex result than to those from steel and brass. The evidence that the duplex result deserves more weight than the results from

steel and brass is convincing. First, because the probable errors. of the results of the field measures from Tables Nos. 6 and 7 are much Jess than for either steel or brass. Second, because the probable errors of the duplex results follow more closely the laws of accidental errors, whil~ for steel and brass the probable errors follow the laws of constant errors more nearly, varying in direct proportion to the length. And lastly, because by the removal of the tent and the subjection of the bars to different conditions of the weather, the probable errors have not beu1 much affected for the duplex result, but the probable errors of the steel and brass have increased greatly. In Tables Nos. 5 and 6 it is apparent that wherever the range in the temperature is least the results from the three methods are most nearly in accord. In special cases, such as the test kilometer at Alice Base, section 6 at Stephenville Base, and the northwest half of section 6 at Anthony Base, where the temperature was either stationary or varied little, the accord is perfect. With the one exception of November 2, when the canvas jacketing had become wet with dew during the preceding night, there was a decided tendency to have a large result from brass and steel when the temperature was rising and the reverse when the temperature was falling. In other words, when the temperature is rising the results stand in the order brass, steel, duplex, the brass being the highest. It may occur to the reader to inquire why the evidence does not require the steel and brass results to be rejected and show the assumption true that the thermometers record the temperature in advance of the brnss and steel components, but that these bars are of the same temperature. Let us first assume seven cases when the temperature is rising, where at least two of three involved temperatures are alike. In the first one, let the thermometers and the brass component have equal temperatures, both above Thermometer= Brass that of steel, thus: Steel . As the thermometer indication is higher than the steel temperature, it follows that the result from steel would be greater than that from the brass, which in this case is the correct result. Also, the temperature of the brass being higher than that of steel, the gain of the brass component is too great, and when multiplied by the factor l .668, or duplex coefficient, would give a result from the duplex Duplex method greater than either. The three results would stand Steel This ot·<ler and Brass the ratio of these results may be shown by a numerical example: Suppose the thermometer and brass temperature to be o 0 · 2 above that of steel.

Moreover, assumptions 2, 3, and 6 would therefore correspond with the facts, the results having the right order and the same ratio. In a similar manner, by assuming the temperatures all different, two cases out of a possible eight were found where the order of the results and this ratio of the differences between the results would agree with the facts. In view of the fact that with a rising temperature five out of a total of fifteen assumptions of the relation of the three involved temperatures would agree with the relation as found, it would seem to the writer too radical to assert that assumption No. 6, where the duplex result is correct and the thermometer is in error, is tht= only one possible, and reject the other four as impossible. Not being certain, then, that the two metals have exactly equal temperatures, it is not certain that the steel and brass measures should be rejected and the duplex results alone retained. The three results have been tried on their merits and the weights assigned inversely as the squares of the probable errors.
CONSTANT TEMPERATURE ERRORS OF THE DUPLEX MEASURES.

The presence of constant errors in any base measure due to a defective knowledge of the temperature of the bars has been explained in previous base measures by assuming a lag of the mercurial or bimetallic thermometers. The variety of temperatures encountered in the Shelton comparisons affords an opportunity to look for evidence of such a lag of either themometric or bar temperature. On July 27, and the first measure _of July 28 (Table No. 3, p. 250), the temperature was rising at the rate of o 0 .05 centigrade or more per minute, and these are the only two determinations of either comparator interval with the duplex apparatus made \vith rapidly rising temperature. Comparing the mean of these results with the mean of all for each method, the result from steel is o"'m.12 higher than the mean, the brass result om"'. 14 lower and the mean of the two determinations for the duplex method, becomes loom+ 1"'m.99 for the 20 bars, independently of thermometers. This is om'".56 longer than the adopted value. The evidence of these two determinations with rapidly rising temperature indicates that the temperatures as given by the thermometers on the 27th were too low and on the 28th too high, but on both days the brass temperature is apparently, from giving the shorter result, greater. than that of steel. On the other hand, with falling temperatures, as on July 26 and August 4, the brass temperature is lower than that of steel (shown by the greater result). In other words, brass seems to take the temperature in advance of steel. This would mean that the duplex result, which is dependent on an equality of temperature between the brass and steel components, is also affected by a constant error from this cause. Now, in the actual measurement on the nine test kilometers, the temperature conditions at Shelton and Bowie Bases and on half of the section at Page, El Reno, Stephenville, Lampasas, and Seguin Bases were the same as those on July 27 and 28. The duplex length of these sections would be, therefore, increased in millimeters as follows, to correspond with the fact that the comparator determinat10ns show the bars under these conditions to be om"'.56 per loo meters longer than usual: at Shelton and

Bowie Bases by sm"'.6, and at Page, El Reno, Stephenville, Lampasas and Seguin Bases by 2""".8. Such a change would place the duplex result among the tape results in three of the ~ven cases, and the agreement of the bars and tapes would be improved in each case.
ERRORS OF STEEL TAPE MEASURES.

The errors affecting measurements with long steel tapes have been fully treated in the pages discussing the tape measures of the Holton Base (Appendix No. 8, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892, Part II). As to errors in grade corrections they are of the compensating class. Errors in determining the differences it~ altitude of consecutive marking tables are as likely to be of one sign as another. Throughout this season's work the interval between support nails has been 25 meters, and on nearly all the bases the .differences of elevation were determined for each 25-meter interval, and thus the small cumulative error ciue to imperfections in the alignment of these support nails to a uniform slope has been eliminated. The errors of alignment are necessarily very minute, as a lack of parallelism with the base of any so-meter tape to the extent of a decimeter would give rise to an error of only o""". IO. A decimeter is an impossible quantity, as each marking table and support nail was aligned with an 8-inch theodolite to within r centimeter. Any departure of the intermediate supports of the tape from a vertical plane through its ends would give rise to errors of the same sort and sign. Supposing an extreme and impossible case of a centimeter out of alignment on each support, the total accumulation could be but o""".8 on a kilometer, or r part in r 200 ooo. The question of economy, presented to the Superintendent when the plans were made for measurif1g the Versailles Base, brought about a change in the interval between supports from IO meters to 25 meters. This was made possible by the increase in the applied tension from r 1. s kilograms to rs.
TE:\'1PERATURE ERRORS OF THE
TAPl~

MEASURES.

The method of attaching the thermometers directly to the tape in horizontal position was first used in measurements of primary bases at the Versailles Base. This 'departure from ·the exact duplication of the Holton Base methods, it is believed, has at least not increased the uncertainties in the tape temperatures. That the day measures are more uncertain than the night measures has been thoroughly established. Without doubt this is due to the differing capacities of the tape and thermometer for absorbing and radiating heat under varying conditions. Some evidences of errors of this sort may therefore be expected even where all measures and standardization are carried on between sunset and daylight. These may be distinguished as errors due to time of night. As the aim of the party was to attain results which should conform in accuracy to the limits prescribed in the instructions and not to experiment, there may not be data sufficient .to come to any definite conclusion. \Vhatever errors of temperature are present in the actual measurement on the base ought also to be present i~1 the standardization, which was made at similar times and under similar conditions. Referring to the results in Tables Nos. 8, 9 1 10 1 and r 1, the reader needs to be reminded that in these determinations of length there was no protection from the

COAST AND GEODETIC SL'RVEY REPORT, 19cn.

weather, and the results show considerable effect ·Of the wind during the Shelton comparisons. But the Seguin comparisons are all free from wind effect and these alone should be used in discussing temperature errors. The maximum residual at the Seguin comparator is o""". 17 for Tape 85, o"'"'.20 for 88, o'""'. 16 for 248 and om'". 17 for 247, without any rejected observation aud including observations on three iiights which were quite different iti their atmospheric conditions. On the 12th of January there was dew and a few clouds, the 14th was perfectly clear with no dew, and on the 15th it began clear but became entirely overcast with storm clouds during the observations. The probable error of a single determination of a tape length from the Seguin comparisons only, in the case of the roo-meter tape, or of two tape lengths in the case of the :J -a-meter tapes ' is .. th~refore ±o"''" · 09 for T 85' ±o"'m · 10 for T 88' ±om"' · 07 for T ~48' and ±o'""'.06 for T.,,. The largest probable error of a single determination at Seguin is only one part in 1 ooo ooo. · When compared with the probable error of a single determination, where only the night comparisons at the Holton comparator were used (p. 263), the temperature errors here displayed are less. The probabie error of a single measure of a kilometer as deduced for the measures on the Holton Base was ± 1"'"'. 74. In a similar manner the probable error of a single measure of a kilometer from the tape measures on the Versailles Base was ±1 "'.20. From the results of all the measurements on the nine base lines under discussion the probable error of a single measure of a kilometer section can be computed, for the 50-meter tapes ±1" .7, and for the 100-meter tapes ±1 .8. It is shown, then, that even though these probable errors are computed from sections which have been repeated by a second tape and involve errors of standardization, the probable errors have not increased over that attained in the Holton Base measures. A comparativetest of the two methods of handling the thermometers has already been made on p. 258, which is entirely favorable to the method of attaching the thermometer to the tape in a horizont:d position, as compared with the Holton Base method of incasing the bulbs in steel sheaths and holding at the height of the tape. The departure, therefore, from the Holton Base method of handling the thermometers, and of increasing the tension and distance between supports, is justified by the resulting probable errors. The liability of showing a constant error in tape measures from a lag of the mercurial thermometers is 'not great, because the range of temperature during the measure of a section is small. An unsuccessful attempt was made to discover a lag of thermometers with respect to the tape. There is apparently no decided lag effect either in the Versailles Base measures or in the measures during this season. The results of the comparator determinations and on the sections where measures were made on different nights show a tendency to constant errors which does not correspond to an assumed lag of the mercurial thermometer, but is probably due to a.changed relation or persistent difference between the thermometer and tape temperature due to atmospheric conditions. The magnitude of these errors is hard to determine, but from the residuals on the test kilometers, on sections involving measures on different nights and on the comparators, they are of about the size indicated for the duplex result on the comparators ('rabies Nos. 3 and 4). The maximum residual for any one of the four tapes is o"'"'.87, and for the duplex result it is omm.86. For 50-meter Tape· No. 248 the maximum residual is omm.47, and the

probable error of a single determination of 100 meters is ±o"'"'. 15, the same as for the steel and brass components of the duplex. It seems desirable to examine the tape results with a Yiew to discovering constant errors peculiar to different nights. On July 28 measures were made with Tapes 88 and 85 on the same night as the comparisons. Referring to Tables Nos. 8 and 9, the observations on 85 for this night make the tape o.mm47 shorter than the mean, while on 88 this night's observations make the tape o"'"'.21 shorter than the mean. Applying these two corrections to the measures of the Shelton test kilometer and the correction* 5" 6 to the duplex result (p. 254) there result these values:

The range in the results from these three sets of apparatus in Table No. r2, 13" ".4, is thus reduced to 7 "".9, the result from Tape 85 dgreeing closely with that frot11 the duplex.
CONSTANCY OF STEEL TAPES.

Although the 100-meter tapes used at the Holton and St. Albans Bases were again used in this work, their equations can not be directly compared. The tension has been increased from r 1.5 kilograms to 15.0 kilograms, and the interval between supports from ro meters to 25. On July 19, before any of the standardizing of this season began, when unreeling tape No. 85 an undiscovered defect in the reel caused a kink in the tape which could not be entirely removed. The difference between the tapes, T 88-T85 , was at Holton 2mm.45, at St. Albans 2"'m.57, and throughout this season 3" r6. . The test of constancy is greatest in this season's work, extending as it does through six months and involving nine base lines. The reader is again referred to the section, ''Adopted lengths of tapes" to note that three of the tapes, 88, 247, and 248, show no change during the season over 1 part in I ooo ooo, while Tape 85 apparently increased in length o"'"'.45, or r part in 220 ooo. Again 50-meter Tape No. 204 was tested both before and after the measurement of the Versailles Base (p. 226, "Transcontinental Triangulation"), with almost identical values for its length, which indicates that the tension of 15 kilograms is not excessive.

MAXIMUM GRADES FOR STEEL TAPES, AND BREAKING OF GRADES.

The rather unusual topography for a base line encountered on four of the nineo lines, as shown by the maximum grade corrections, mentioned in connection with each base, will cause comment, and the manner in which it was overcome should be explained and justified. As an exhibition of this the reader is referred to illustration No. 17, the profile of the Lampasas Base. No grading to ease the grades on any of the lines was , ·attempted, and the 25-meter spans of the tape measurement are nearly parallel to the surface of the ground traversed, except where such parallelism would necessitate placing an intermediate tape support below the grade of the marking tables, a tall support being substituted in all such cases. On section 1 of the Lampasas line it was necessary to break the grade (have the middle support above the grade of the marking tables) on three-fifths of the section. Also, on this section the maximum grade of the entire season was encountered, 3. r 5 meters in 25 n~eters, involving a correction to the measured length
*As derived on pp. 294, 295.

COAST AND GEODETIC SVR VEY REPORT, 190r.

equivalent to 201 millimeters. An improbable error of 5 millimeters in determining this difference of elevation would cause an uncertainty of om'".3. As has been pointed out these errors are not ·cumulative and moreover occur but seldom. When tapes are inclined in this manner it is plain that the distance between the terminal marks will be greater than when the line is horizontal. The investigation of this question, pages 487,488, Report for 1892, Part II, shows that for grades of 5 per cent or differences of elevation cf less than 1. 25 meters for each 25-meter span this correction may be regarded as insensible, being considerably les::. than r part in 1 ooo ooo. On this, the extreme of all sections measured during this season, only thirteen of the forty spans exceed this 5 per cent grade, and for these the corrections due to such slope could be readily computed and applied. The correction would be about om"'.8 in the extreme case. Any possible criticism of the method of breaking the tape grades may be most readily disposed of by referring the reader to the test kilometer of the Bowie Base. On this section the roo-meter tapes were practically unbroken from end to end of the section. but for the 50-meter tape four broken grades occur, making the grade corrections for the 50-meter tapes 234""". r, and for the 100-meter tapes 19]'"'".2, yet the mean of the length from the 50-meter tapes differs only om'".9 from the length from the 100-meter tapes. It may be concluded from this and other similar cases that the increased friction ·on the support nails has not produced errors of appreciable magnitude. In perfecting the tension for the final contact it is as probable in a given case that the man applying the tension will have to slack off a few grams as to take it up, and thus the errors from the increased friction on the supports would be as likely of one sign as the other.
WIND EFFECT ON TAPES.

Very little attention has been paid to the effect of wind on tape measurements, except to avoid making measures while a strong breeze was blowing, such measures being not at all trustworthy. At the Shelton comparator delays were caused by high winds which failed to subside with the setting of the sun. Observations were made on the tapes for determinations of their lengths when the wind was disturbing the tape very much. The effect seems to be that the results are erratic and necessarily not as trustworthy as those on calm nights. Experience soon taught the observers that when using the tape under the conditions of tension and supports here \Jsed any wind which did not set the tape to vibrating violently would not seriously affect the results. When it is explained that during the five months after the completion of the Shelton Base practically no delays to the progress of the base measurement were made necessary by the wind, the liability of delays from wind will not be urged as an objection to measures with long tapes.
ERRORS DUE TO TENSION ON THE TAPES.

The errors due to erroneously holding the pointer of the dhl to the exact tension are obviously not of the cumulative class. Any personal equation of the man applying the tension in persistently applying too much (or too little) tension is eliminated by having the same man apply the tension in the determinations on the comparator as in the base measures, which .vas the practice during the season, with two or threi! minor exceptions.

TEN-METER INTERVALS FOR TAPE SUPPORTS VERSUS TWENTY-FIVE METER INTERVALS.

Very little discussion is required to point out the advantage of the longer interval of twenty-five meters over that of ten meters. The evidence already produced is deemed sufficient to prove that there was no loss of accuracy from the change. _On the work of setting stakes and preparing for tape measurement a direct comparison can be made by taking the figures in the table on page 332 of Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1892. According to this table, for the 5.5 kilometers of the Holton Base 53.5 days for one man were required, or 9.7 days per kilometer. In the work under discussion, where the interval was 25 meters between tape supports, 201 days for one man were spent in cutting and setting the tape supports for measuring 57 kilometers, or 3.5 days per kilometer. As a matter of economy this change, then, shows a reduction in labor of preparation of something over one-half by reducing the number of tape supports in a kilometer from 100 to 40. If the reduction in the lumber and cost of transporting it were added, the comparison would become still more favorable to the long interval between supports. The setting of the tape supports was done by a party of from four to five persons, consisting of one officer who had immediate charge of the work and handled the forward end of the tape, one officer who aligned the tape supports, and two or three men. The time necessary for such a party to set one kilometer of tape supports varied from two to six hours.
TAPES VERSUS BARS.

For a proper discussion of the relative merits of the duplex bar apparatus and the long steel tapes, it is necessary to state the relative cost of the two. The cost, when computed in terms of a day of labor for an officer or laborer, of measuring 57 kilometers of double measure with steel tapes was 406 days. For measuring 16.1/z kilometers of double measure with the duplex apparatus the cost was 321 days; that is, 7. l days' work for one man was required to measure a kilometer twice with the tapes and 19.5 days' with the duplex apparatus. In making this comparison one-half of all the time required for the leveling was charged to the tape measures and none to the duplex measures, because the profile of the line necessary when bar measures only were made would require much less time than the leveling for the grade of the tape. The item of 406 days is made up of three parts, as follows: 201 days in cutting and setting the tape supports, 112 days in the actual measurement, and 93 days for the extra leveling required. There were 61 days spent in opening the lines and aligning the few points required on the base, which were necessary for either type of apparatus. The three to five hours during the evening were called a half day in making this comparison. From these figures the labor of the bar measurement is two and three-quarter times as great as that of the tape measurement. When comparison is made of the probable errors of a single measure of a kilometer section, that from the Salt Lake Base, ±1'""'. 14, and from this season, ±1"''".2, for the duplex result, are practically identical with that attained in the measurement of the Versailles Base for the 50-meter tape,± 1"'"'. 2. It is true, however, that viewed in the light of these probable errors the accuracy is greater from the duplex, for two reasons,

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl'R \'EY REPORT,

I<)OI.

viz, the duplex gives three results which, although they are not independent, are desirable checks on a portion of the accidental errors to which the apparatus is subject, and,. second, because the errors due to determinations of the grade are displayed in the case of the bar apparatus, while in the case of the tape measures such errors would affect both measures alike.
FIFTY-METER TAPES VERSUS ONE-HUNDRED-METER TAPES.

The probable errors may be expected to reveal the relative merits of using a 50-meter and a 100-meter tape. The probable error of a single determination of the comparator interval was for the two 100-meter tapes ±o"'"'.19 and ±o"'"'.24, respectively, and for the 50-meter tapes ±o"'"'.24 and ±o"''".15, respectively, which is slightly favorable to the shorter tape. Again, the probable error of a siugle measure of a kilometer when computed from all sections was ± 1"'"'. 7* in the case of the 50-meter tapes, and ±1""".8* in the case of the loo-meter tapes. While this gain in accuracy is small for the 50-meter tape over the loo-meter tape, it is nevertheless instructive as showing that the accidental errors of the thermometer indications are not decreased with a multiplication of the thermometer readings. As the accidental errors of making twke the number of contacts made necessary by the use of the 50-meter tape instead of the loo-meter tape are so smallt as, to make no showing in the probable error, it would naturally be supposed that the double number of thermometer indications recorded for the 50-meter tapes would have a great effect on the probable error. Such is not the case, however. The ease with which 50-meter tapes may be adapted to obstructions of topography makes the labor of setting the supports about equal to that required for the loo-meter tapes. The choice between the two must be made, then, in the comparison of the number of operatives required with each length of tape. The minimum number of operatives for the 100-meter tape is eight, and for thf' c;o-meter tape six, which means that it always takes one-third more help to manipulate me longer tape . . While the speed of measurement with the 100-meter tape is about one-fifth faster than with the 50-meter tape (see Tables Nos. 22 and 23), this is unimportant for two reasons: First, because the time required for the measurement is much less ·than that required for the preparation of the line for measurement; and, second, it is always desirable to keep the measurement following closely the setting of the supports. In measurements through pasture the tape supports were so frequently disturbed that it was found convenient to complete the measurement as soon as 3 kilometers had been prepared for measurement. The work of measuring 3 kilometers in each direction was readily accomplished during an evening without regard to whether it was with the loo-meter or 50-meter tape. The conclusion therefore is that the loo-meter tape has few if any advantages ·over the 50-meter tape, and requires a party at least one-third larger for i.ts manipulation. ----·---*These probable errors involve the errors of standardization and the constant errors of each tape, so are not comparable with the probable errors stated on page 296, and therefore were not used in discussing the relative accuracy of bars and tapes. tSee page 474, Report for i892.

NINE BASES ON NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN. CONCLUSIONS.

301

The history of geodesy presents few if any examples of a base measured with more than one apparatus which do not show outstanding differences very large in comparison with those which are displayed by repeating the measurement with the same apparatus. These constant errors, which are only detected by the use of several sets of apparatus, have been revealed in this season, and it may be inferred that the ab~olute accuracy is therefore at least as great as in previous bases where but one type of apparatus is involved. These constant errors are shown in the results of the measures of the nine test kilometers. The maximum range in the. results was 2om'", the tapes, as would be expected, agreeing among themselves nl.ore often tlup1 with the bars. The bars give a smaller result than the mean, ranging in the kilometer from 2""".1 to 10'"'". 3. This outstanding difference between the duplex result and the mean of all is 1 part in 175 ooo on the average. In like manner, 100-meter tape No. 88 shows a tendency to give the largest result, being above the mean in seven of the nine cases and averaging r part in 385 ooo on the entire 9 kilometers. The source of these constant errors is still problematic. In concluding this report of a geodetic operation of this magnitude, in which in a single season of six months nine primary bases were measured, the opinions of the writer may not be amiss. The accomplishment of the work was made easy by the complete cooperation of every member of the party, and its success is due in great measure to their untiring support. Special acknowledgment of the valuable advice and assistance of Assistant Bowie should be made. The benefits accl'uing from keeping the same party throughout the season are incalculable. Evidences of the increasing efficiency of the party were the rapid preparation of the base sites; the record of the stub-setting party in setting r 300 meters of marking posts and intermediate supports at proper intervals and in accurate alignment for the 50-meter tapes in one hundred and forty-three minutes on the Alice Base; and, finally, the attainment of tlre unprecedented speed of 100 bars (500 meters) in sixty minutes for the duplex measurement at Seguin was the culmination of the increasing experience on the eight bases which preceded. The general conclusion, from a consideration of all the work done ·.vi th the iced-bar apparatus, must be its superiority over.all types of base-measuring apparatus, displaying no errors of the systematic or constant class. Also, that two to six measures under the most trying conditions and without the protection of a shed will give an accuracy equal to that represented by a probable error of 1 part in 2 500 ooo. The duplex apparatus in use under the most trying conditions has shown itself to be entitled to probably first rank among contact-slide bar apparatus. Its double contact feature has proved no hindrance, and the results have shown that it is possible to use it in high winds in which the secondary apparatus could not be used. This greater stability is probably due to the greater weight of the duplex. An examination of the resuits from duplicate measures and in competition with the tapes re\·eals constant errors of some magnitude. These constant errors can be most nearly overcome by duplicating the field conditions of temperature and atmosphere on the comparator determinations. In summing up all the errors of tape measurements, except those involving the

COAST AND GEODET.tC SURVEY REPORT, 190r.

grades, and which are necessarily small, the real criterion is t_he probable error of a single measure of a section where the observations extend through more than one day or a variety of weather. Such a test occurred on nearly every section of the Versailles Base,* and the~ errors were shown to be small. During this season such tests. occurred on but few sections, but the indications.from these agreed with the Versailles experience. It is not maintained that no constant errors are in evidence in the results of the tape measures, but it is not believed that they are larger than those which affect the duplex bar measures. It is apparent that a field comparator whose interval should be measured with the iced-bar apparatus is a positive necessity when an absolute accuracy of r part in soo ooo is desired. It is also necessary with either the duplex bar or tape apparatus to have the conditions of temperature and weather the same in the actual measures as in the standardization. This duplication of conditions could be more readily attained with the tape apparatus than with the duplex bars. In future base measures with a field comparator at each base it would be feasible to measure the comparator interval with the tape on each of the two to four nights when measures were made on the base. In this manner a party no larger than the one of this season could use two or three so-meter tapes and have a so-meter comparator at each base with no greater cost than in these measures, and attain an absolute accuracy ~till greater than here attained. *Page 230, '' Transcontinental Triangulatio.n.

EXTENSION OF TABLES FOR THE COMPUTATION OF GEODETIC POSITIONS TO THE EQUATOR.
By
JOHN

F.

HAYFORD,

C/iief of Computing Division.

These tables are an extension of those published in Appendix No. 9, of the Report for 1894, which are applicable between latitudes 18° and 72°. The tables here printed extend from 18° to the equatpr. They are based on the same constants as the tables in the 1894 Report, namely, upon the Clarke Spheroid of 1866, of which the equatorial radius is 6 378 206.4 meters, 'and the polar semiaxis 6 356 583.8 meters. For the purpose of making these tables complete in themselves the deri\·ation of the formula:: on which they are based is reproduced from the 1894 Report. To apply these tables to the computation of positions south of the equator it is only necessary to bear in mind in using the formula:: that all south latitudes are negative. Whenever b. <p as computed in these formula:: is negative it indicates a numerical increase in the latitude. In ~sing the formula for f::,.a it should be noted that for the Southern Hemisphere the term sin .Y:l ( <fJ+<p') is always negative and therefore D.a and b.A always have the same sign in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas they have opposite signs in the Northern Hemisphere. To apply these tables to the computation of positions in east longitude it is only necessary to consider that all east longitudes are negative. These formulre and tables, with those in 1894 Report, keeping in mind the above statements, apply to the computation of geodetic positions over the whole sphere, except in latitudes greater than 72° north or south. In the logarithms given in the tables a minus sign over the characteristic indic&tes that 10 is to be subtracted from the characteristic as printed, and a double minus sigr1 indicates that 20 is to be subtracted from the characteristic as printed.
FORMULM FOR THE COM?UTATION OF GEODETIC LATITUDES, LONGITUDES, AND AZIMUTHS.

When the geographical coordinates of latitude and longitude of a point 011 the earth's surface and the distance and azimuth to another point are known, the problem of computing the latitude and longitude of the second point and the reverse azimuth may be treated in two different ways. V/e may either solve the spheroidal triangle formed by the two points and the pole, as a whole, arriving at trigonometrical functions of the required co-latitude, azimuth, and difference of longitude, or we may develop expressions for the differences of the required and the given quantities.

COAST A:-;D GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

The former or direct method has the inconvenience of requiring the use of ten places of decimals in the computation, in order to give the positions with a degree of exactness corresponding to that of the known distance between the two points, while the second leads to very convenient expressions, on account of the smallness of the differential arcs in ordinary triangulation. \Vhen, however, the arc between the two points reaches several degrees in length, the direct method must be resorted to. This solution has been very completely and elegantly effected by Bessel, and is given in Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 86, 1826. Adopting the second method, we follow in the main Puissant (Traite de Geodesie)* in the development of the difference of latitude of two points on the spheroid in terms of the distance, azimuth, and latitude of the given point. It will be desirable first to recall the expressions of several lines of an ellipse in '·erms iln-olving the latitude <p which is the angle the normal to any point on the ellipse makes with the major axis.

The radius of cun·ature Rand the normal N are principal quantities used in geodesy. It will be obser\'ed that radii of curvature for different latitudes do not intersect unless produced, and that when they lie in different meridional planes on the spheroid they will not intersect at all. A and B in Fig. 2 are two points on a spheroid of revolution, having the latitudes <p, <p', and joined by the geodetic line AB= s, making the angles with the meridian PAB=180°-a, and PBA=a'-180°. The azimuths a, a' are reckone'd·from sonth around by west in consequence of the latitudes being reckoned, by settled c..ustom, from the equator toward the poles, otherwise the 111eridional coordinate of a point would be more properly measured from the pole and the azimuth of a line reckoned from the north. The angle APB between the two meridional planes passing through A and B is the

Furthermore, An, Bn', Ar, Br' indicate the normals N, N', and the radii of curvature in the meridian R, R', at the points A and B. This being premised and the latitude <p of the point A being given, as well as the length s of the geodetic line AB and its azimuth a, we propose to find the latitude <p' of the point B, the angle Lli\., and the reverse azimuth a', by solving the geodetic triangle ABP. Writing y, y', for the co-latitudes, for 180-a, and <Y for the arc AB referred to radius = 1, we have in a spherical triangle for y' the following equation: cos y'=cos y cos <Y+sin y sin (j cos Observing now that o is always a small arc, rarely exceeding l 0 , and generally less than 30', we can develop the increment of y with reference to that of <5 in a rapidly converging series, and will have, by Taylor's theorem,

This difference of latitude is, however. referred to a sphere whose radius is N and requires still to be transformed by referring it to one whose radius is R..,, the radius of curvature in the meridian for the middle latitude.

*In his "The Theory and Practice of Sun·eying" Prof. J. B. Johnson develops this corrective tenn in a direct manner as contrasted with the approximate and lahorious method given in the text, anrl p0ints out that the 1-power in the denominator of /J should be replaced hy unity. This has been 1lone in the appended tables; although the 1lefect is not more than 0.001 of the value of this term, which is itself very sma!J.-C. A. S.

which formula, although of a somewhat complicated derivation, is very simple and convenient in practical computation with the aid of the tabulated log. factors B, C, /J, E. The term* ( o<p )° D is here interposed between the second and third terms of the series proper, because the latter is frequently not required, being insensible when the distance s is less than about ro statute miles or logs, in meters, less than 4. 23. The term ( o<p )· D should be used whenever log Ii exceeds 2.31, and !z· may be substituted for (ocp)· in all cases where logs does not exceed 4.93. The term depending on the fourth differential coefficient, neglected in equation (a) never exceeds o" .002 ·for ff = I 0 or s= 100 kilometers, and may therefore be safely neglected in practice. t

In the line from Ibepah to Ogden, in Utah, 230 kilometers long, the additional term amounted to o".038.

For distances greater than any that can be directly observed, see development of formulre in series by Dr. F. R. Helmert, "Theorieen der Hoheren Geodasie, Leipzig, 188o," Vol. I, pages 296-298.

N. B.-Take out A from table for <p1 ·

The inverse problem.-Cases frequently occur where the distance and mutual azimuths are demanded of two points whose latitudes and longitudes only are known. It has not been found necessary to prepare special formulre and blank forms for this computation, as it can readily be made with the help of the preceding forms. It is done by dividing LtA. =s sin a . A . sec <p' by the first term for L1 <p, It= s cos a . B, whence we get tan «= __LJ~ :_!L A sec cp' h
Thi~ would give the azimuth at once, prodded we knew h, since LJA. is given. We therefore compute the smaller terms for the difference of latitude in order to obtain k by subtracting them from the known value of LJ<p. The only addition to the usual form

is the term log tan a= log ( s sin a) - log ( s cos a). The value of s will best be taken from the term /z when sin a exceeds cos a, and from the term LJ"A when the reverse is the case. When the distance s is large, as in primary triangulation, it will be necessary to introduce the correction for LJ'A. due to difference of ratio between sine and arc, using the form for primary work, inversely, as indicated above.

FORMULA AND TABLE FOR COMPUTING THE SPHERICAL EXCESS OF TRIANGLES.

In every spherical trian.<,5le the excess of the sum of the three angles over 180° bears the same ratio to eight right angles as the area of the triangle bears to that of the \\'hole . . f arra area SJ)here. Puttmg r for rachus, t' for the exces.<>, we have - ·· = - , , hence t =-- . _ 47r 4r7T ,-In order to express fin seconds, of arc, we must divide the expression by sin 1". The area of the triangle, when it is small in relation to the whole sphere, as is the case in all geodetic triangles, may be expressed with sufficient accuracy for this purpose by Yz a, b, sin C, where a, and b, are two sides and C, the included angle. \Ve then ha\'e sin___ C f·- a b _I .I - 2 r' sin 1 "

DETEIUII~:\ TION

OF REL\ TIVE V:\LUE OF GR.-\ VITY IN EUROPE :\ND THE U~ITED STATES 11' 1900.
By G. R. PUTNA:\!,

Assista11t.

This work was carried out for the purpose of more definitely connecting \Vashington, used as a base for the American pendulum observations, with several of the more important European base stations. The cost of the field work was paid from a grant made by the International Geodetic Association, while the instruments and time of the observer were supplied by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. fr accordance with the suggestions of Prof. F. R. Helmert, Director of the Central Bureau of the Geodetic Association, the European statio:1s were restricted to the three localities, London, Paris, and Berlin, to some one of which most of the earlier observations had been referred, and with which more recent base stations in other countries have in general been carefully connected. In the vicinity of London observations were made at three stations: Greenwich Observatory, Kew Observatory, and the Polytechnic Institute (near Portland Place), so as to .::onnect the three important English base stations, on which depend, often independently, extensive series of observations. The lack of a satisfactory connection between these three points has been a difficulty encountered in discussing pendulum observations. (See Clarke's Geodesy, p. 344.) Even the more recent connections have not given entirely accordant results. Observations were made at Potsdam, instead 0f Berlin, because of the present geodetic importance of the former station, which has also been most .::arefully connected with Berlin. Acknowledgment is made of the great courtesy received from the Directors and Assistants of the various institutions visited, in the matter of accommodations and facilities for carrying on the work, and in the furnishing of clock rates and comparisons. In London the work was rendered practicable by the special arrangements made by the General Post Office (Telegraph Department) for transmission of time signals direct to the Yicinity of the station. Acknowledgment is also due to the North German Lloyd Steamship Company for courtesy in the matter of transportation to Europe.
DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.

Very favorable locations were obtained for the observations at all stations, both with respect to uniformity of temperature and stability of support. The total range of temperature at the six stations was 6° .85 C., so that the effect of any uncertainty in the temperature coefficient should be small. The extreme range of temperature during the observations at each individual station is given below, the largest being only 1° .3 C.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

At each place the pendulum case was mounted on solid stone, masonry, .or concrete foundations, as detailed under the separat~ descriptions. The flexure of the support, including case and foundation, is also given below, as measured statically by obserdng with a microscope the displacement of the knife edge in microns when a force of l .5 kilograms was applied horizontally in the plane of oscillation of the pendulum. It is believed that the slight flexure observed was mostly due to the case itself, and that there was no considerable flexure in the foundations at any of the stations. The apparatus used for measuring the flexure is not sufficiently delicate to determine accurately very slight differences, and those obtained between these stations are not unlikely due to uncertainty of observation. As, however, the total range in the flexure corrections applied at these stations is less than one millionth of the period, it is practically a negligible quantity as far as the present work is concerned. The locations of the stations, in general well removed from the lines of hea\·y traffic, rendered them satisfactorily free from earth vibrations clue to this cause, with. the possible exception of London. Here the point of observation was but 48 meters from Regent street, an important thoroughfare, but no resulting effect on the oscillation of the pendulum was noticed, nor is there any marked discrepancr between the observations made during the night and during the day. The results with the separate pendulums are, however, somewhat less accordant at this station. (Table D.)

Washington, D.

(See Report United States Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1894, Part II, p. 42.) The geographic position and the elevation of the station are derived from points established on the Survey Office building. Kew Observatory, Old Deer Park, Ricltmond, SurrC)', England.-This is now a part of the National Physical LabQratory. Observations were made in the seismograph room in the basement. This is a small room partitioned off from a large octagonal room in the center of the south side of the building. The apparatus was mounted on the concrete floor in the same position used by Mr. E. G. Constable in the pendulum obser\'ations of 1888 under direction of Gen. J. T. \Valker. and slightly north of the position used by Capt. W. J. Heaviside, 1873-74. This room is immediately west of and at the same level as the southeast corner room used in the English observations of 1864 and 1873, and by Col. R. D. von Sterneck in 1893. The geographic position is from that

given for the Observatory in the American Ephemeris, and the elevation is derived from an Ordnance Survey bench mark near the northeast corner of the building. Greenwich Observator;1 , London, Engfand.-Observations were made in the record room at the northeast corner of the old obser\'atory building. The apparatus was mounted on a low brick and stone pier built on the stone floor. The pier is in the same position, but not so high as that used by Von Sterneck in 1893. Some of the later English pendulum observations have been made in this room,. but other parts of the building have also been used for this purpose. The geographic position is from that given in the American Ephemeris, the pendulum station being about 19 meters east of the meridian circle. The elevation is derived from an Ordnance Survey bench ~imrk near the entrance gate of the Observatory. London Polytec!tnic Institute, 309 Regent street, London, 1¥., E11g/and.-Observations were made near the south side of the plumber shop in the lowest basement of this building and about 48 meters west from the building line of Regent street. The apparatus was mounted on the concrete floor. The geographic position is taken from the Ordnance Survey map (London, Sheet VII S. W., scale 6 inches to l mile). The elevation is derived from that given on the large-scale Ordnance Survey map (London, Sheet VH 52, scale 5 feet to l mile). This station was selected as the nearest convenient locality to the former stations at Mr. Henry Browne's house in Portland Place (used by Sabine, Kater, and others), and at No. l All Souls Place (used by Herschel), both in private residences. (For locations of these stations see Philosophical Transactions, Royal Society, 1818, p. 93, and 1890 A, p. 558; also Sabine's "Account of Experiments to Determine the Figure of the Earth," p. 343.) The station at the Polytechnic Institute is 511 .7 of latitude south of Herschel's station and 8 11 .2 south of Sabine's station. Potsdam, German_y, ''Konigficltes Preussisc/1es Geodiitisc/1es /nstitut. "-Observations were made in the northeast basement room ("Nord-Ost-Keller"). The apparatus was mounted on a low stone pier built on the concrete floor. This room has been used for the relative pendulum observations made at the Geodetic Institute, but it is cast of and lower than the inner room in which are being carried out the elaborate absolute determinations of the force of gravity. The geographic position and elevation of the · station were furnished by the Director of the Institute. Paris Obse1vafo1J', France.-Observations were made in the octagonal room used by Commandant G. Defforges and described by him as '' Observatoire, rez-de-chattssee de la tour de l'Est." It is a room with massive masonry walls, on the ground floor, southeast of the main north entrance to the Observatory, and west of the meridian circle. The apparatus was mounted on a massive cubical stone block near the .center of the room. Observations have been made in other parts of the building by earlier observers. The geographic position is from that given in the American Ephemeris, and the elevation is derived from a bench mark of the Nivellement general de la France, east of the north entrance of the Observatory.
INSTRU:llENTS AND :ltETHODS OF OBSERVATION.

The half-second pendulum apparatus and pendulums A,, A 5 , and A 6 were used in this work. These pendulums have a record of extensive service and long voyages, and from their first use at Washington, in 1894, have shown a nearly constant period.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901.

There has been in this time apparently a slight diminution of about one millionth of a second. This apparatus is described in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Reports for 1891, Appendix 15; 1894,,Appendix l; and 1897, Appendix6. The methods of observation, as modified in 1895 and described in the last two of the above reports, were follo\ved in this work, with the partial exception of the plan of swinging the pendulums for the entire interval between time observations. At the European stations the observer did not m~ke his own observations for time, but in general depended on the regular work of the observatories for this service, and at Kew and London used the time signals sent out during the day by telegraph from Greenwich Observatory. In some cases, therefore, the pendulum swings did not cover the entire interval between the epochs of the star observations for time, but a study of the rates of the standard obsen·atory clocks at Greenwich and Paris indicates that probably very little uncertainty is introduced by depending on them. At Potsdam and Washington special time observations were made and the pendulum S\Vings cover th.e entire interval between these determinations (ninety-six hours at Potsdam). Briefly stated, the method of obsen·ation was to swing successively three pendulums in two positions each, making in all six swings of eight hours each (twice this number were made at Potsdam). Pendulum A, was swung on knife edge II, and A 5 and A 6 on knife edge' I. The swings were made with a nearly uniform arc, diminishing from about 55' to 20' (this is the total or double arc), and at a nearly uniform pressure, about 6o'°mof mercury. The thermometer, inserted in a dummy pendulum in the case, had its corrections determined before and after the work. As a precaution a free thermometer was also suspended in the r:ase.
RATES OF CHRO:N"O:\IETERS.

The periods of the pendulums were obtained by means of coincidence observations made with two break-circuit chronometers, used alternately in the flash apparatus circuit. At \Vashington both chronometers were sidereal, but at the European stations one sidereal and one mean time chronometer were used, the latter giving a more convenient coincidence interval in the higher latitudes where the force of gravity is greater and the period of these pendulums more nearly approaches the sidereal half second. The separate observations and computations with the two chronometers afford a convenient check on the work, though in general increasing the accuracy of the final result but little, for at none of these stations do the mean periods derived from the two chronometers differ more than o'.0000002. The rates of the chronometers used in the pendulum observations were obtained as detailed below: Washington, D. C.-Starobservations for timeweremade in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office Observatory with an astronomic transit, the observations and chronometer comparisons being recorded chronographically. In.June and October observations were obtained each night of the work, and the same star'list was used throughout each group of observations. Kew Observato1y.-The standard mean time clock "French" of Kew Observatory was compared each day at 10 a. m. and r p. m. with time signals received by telegraph from Greenwich Observatory. The comparisons at Kew were made on a tape recorder, and at Greenwich the sending of the signals was compared with their standard clock by a chronographic record. The chronometers at Kew were compared with each other and

with the clock "French" by eye and ear comparisons of coincidence of beats. The corrections to the signals sent from Greenwich, as resulting from the final time computations, were furnished by the Astronomer Royal. The mean. of the two daily telegraphic comparisons was adopted in deriving the rate of the standard clock '' French.'' Greenwicli Observatory.-Sidereal chronometer r 829 was compared chronographically each evening with the standard sidereal clock of the Observatory, the corrections to which were derived directly from the meridian circle observations. The two chronometers were compared by coincidences of beats. Meridian circle observations were obtained by the Observatory Assistants on the evenings of July 3, 4, and 6. The final clock corrections were furnished by the Astronomer Royal. London Polytechnic fnstitute.-Mean time chronometer 1840 was compared twice daily with the time signals sent hy telegraph from Greenwich Obsen·atory, the comparisons being made on .a tape recorder. The two chronometers were intercompared by coincidence of beats. The sending of the signals was recorded chronogrnphically at Greenwich, and the corrections, as resulting from the final time computations, were furnished by the Astronomer Royal. Special arrangements for the sending of the time ;signals to a point convenient for this work, and for installing the necessary receiving apparatus, were made by the Engineer in Chief, General Post Office (telegraphs). Potsdam, Geodetic lnstitute.-Star observations for time were made by Herr E. Borrass on the evenings of July 2r, 24, and 25, from which were computed the corrections to the standard sidereal clock Dencker 27. The two chronometers were compared with this clock on the tape chronograph each evening. The corrections and rates of clock Dencker 27 were furnished by the Geodetic Institute. Pan·s Observatory.-Star observations for time were made by the Observatory staff on the e\·enings of July 31, August r (pa_rtial set), August 3, and August 4. The chronometers were compared by coincidence of beats with the standard sidereal clock used in these observations. The computed corrections to the clock were furnished by the Director. Some idea of the possible uncertainty of the chronometer rates may be obtained from the pendulum results themselves. A certain combination of pendulums was always swung during each twenty-four hours, either A,R, A,D, and A 5 R; or A 5 D, A 6 R, and A 6 D. A separate chronometer rate connection was used for the interval of each such group. Therefore, if the results be combined by these groups instead of by the separate pendulums, the discrepancies between such results may be attributed lo errors in rate, though undoubtedly they also include other sources of error. An examination of the present observations in this manner shows discrepancies which if due entirely to rate would indicate an average uncertainty of rate of 0.05 second per day, and a maximum. at any of the six stations of o. ro second per day (corresponding to an uncertainty of about the r · 430,000 part in the resulting value of g).

REDUCTION OF OBSERVATIONS.

The computations were made in the same manner as heretofore, tbe periods of the pendulums being reduced to the standard conditions, sidereal time, arc infinitely small, temperature l 5° C., pressure 60"'"' of mercury at o° C., inflexible support. The following is a summary of the corrections applied to the observed period: Rate correction= +0.00001157 RP, where Pis period and R is daily rate in sidereal seconds on sidereal time (+if losing, - if gaining).

I

. PM sin ( cp+<p'j sin ( cp- cp') A re correct1011 = . . where Pis period, Mis modulus 32 log sm <p-log sm q/ ' of common logarithmic system, <p and q/ are initial and final semi-arcs (2<p and 2q/ are the quantities given in Table B).
Temperature correction= +0.00000837 P (15°-T observed temperature in degrees centigrade.

Flexure correction= -0.00000130 P JJ, where P is period, and D is observed displacement of knife-edge in microns, when force of 1. 5 kilograms is applied horizontally in the plane of oscillation. The above temperature, pressure, and flexure coefficients were determined by experiment in 1894. Table B gives a detailed summary of the observations and corrections, and in Table C are collected the mean periods of Fhe pendulums and the differences of each from the mean, for the separate stations.

RESULTS-

Table D gives for each station the value of g computed from the periods of each pendulum separately and from the means of the three pendulums, with the differences of the individual results from the mean_ The latter are to some extent a measure of the accuracy of the work, but not entirely so, as there are errors, such as flexure, which might affect all three pendulums alike. These values of g are based, as indicated, on the value provisionally adopted for \Vashington in 1892. In Table E are given the data as to the positions of the stations and the values of g as above, and also those based on the result tent-atively obtained at Potsdam in the elaborate determinations of the absolute force of gravity now in progress there, but not yet completed.* This, which is probably the best value of the absolute force of gravity now available, indicates tl~at the provisional value for Washington and all valnes based thereon wiq need to be increased by about 0.013 dyne or centimeter, or about the I '75000 part. The connection between the three London stations indicates, in accordance with previous experience, that marked and sudden changes in the amount of the force of gravity are not likely to be found between near points. Greenwich is distant from Kew 21.6 kilometers (13.4 miles) and from London Polytechnic Institute ro.8 kilometers (6.7 miles). Greenwich is 42 meters (138 feet) higher than Kew and 24 meters (79 feet) higher than London. Greenwich is o' 32 11 of latitude north of Kew and 2 1 21 11 south of London. Resulting from these differences in elevation and latitude we should have the following theoretical differences in the force of gravity as compared with those found by the present observations:

TRIANGULATION NORTHWARD ALONG THE NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN IN KANSAS AND NEBRASKA.
By
JOH~

F. HA YFO!W, Inspector o/ Geodetic Work.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

It is proposed to extend a chain of primary triangulation northward and southward from the transcontinental triangulation in the vicinity of the ninety-eighth meridian approximately along that meridian to the Canadian border to the northward and to the Rio Grande to the south\vard. This triangulation, which may for conv~nience be called the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, when completed from Canada to Mexico, from latitude 49° to latitude 26°, will pass through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma Territory, Indian Territory, and Texas. For the engineer, this triangulation will, in combination with the tran~continental triangulation, form the main framework for the control of all the triangulation in the United States. For the scientist it will furnish incidentally a great arc of a meridian having an amplitude of 23 °, and passing over a region in which the. surface indications are that the local deflections of the vertical are probably small. The Mexican Government has already in progress a triangulation along the same meridian which it is expected will extend the arc southward from latitude 26° to latitude 17°, at which point this meridian intersects the Pacific coast. It is also possible for the Canadian Government to extend this arc far to the northward. The present state of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation within the limits of the United States is as follo\vs: The reconnaissance is complete from the Rio Grande to points in North Dakota in latitude 43 ~ 0 , over an arc of 17 ~ 0 . All the necessary bases between these points have been measured save one which is near the Rio Grande. The ten bases measured are, in order, from south to north: Alice Base (Texas), Seguin Base (Texas), Lampasas Base (Texas), Stephenville Base (Texas), Bowie Base (Texas), El Reno Base (Oklahoma), Anthony Base (Kansas), Salina Base (Kansas), Shelton Base (Nebraska), and Page Base (Nebraska), the name of the base indicating its location near a town of the same name in each case. A report on the measurement of nine of these bases during the season of 1900 may be found in Appendix No. 3 of this Report. The remaining base is that at Salina, in Kansas, which was measured in connection with the transcontinental triangulation*· As this base line lies near the intersection of the thirty-ninth parallel and the ninety-eighth meridian, it belongs essentially to both triangulations.
"See "The Transcontinental Triangulation" (Special Publication No. 4), pp. 174-190. 361

COAST AND GEODETIC SVR VEY REPORT,

I9<JI.

The m~asures of horizontal and vertical angles are complete from the transcontinental triangulation northward to latitude 43X( 0 , in South Dakota, three figures beyond the Page Base, and from the transcontinental triangulation southward to the vicinity of the Anthony Base near the Kansas~Oklahoma line in latitude 37°. · The connection with the Anthony Base is not complete. No astronomic determinations have yet been made, and hence the portion of the triangulation which has been co~pleted is not yet available for use as an arc in determining the figure of the earth. It is proposed to publish the results of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation from time to time as complete sections between bases become available for that purpose. It is desirable to make the publication in such sections since the lengths between bases are not completely fixed until the second base has been connected with. This Appendix contains a complete statement of the results for th~ two sections from the Salina Base to the Shelton Base and from the Shelton Base to the Page Base*, including all secondary and tertiary points determined, as well as the primary points, and including the vertical as well as the horizontal measures. It includes the republication of certain information in regard to the triangulation between the Salina Base and the stations Meades Ranch and Waldo, which is common to the transcontinental triangulation and the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. The first reconnaissance for the triangulation to the northward was made during the autumn of 1896, between August 17 and November 9, and during the spring of 1897 between April IO and June 20, by a party under the direction of Assistant F. D. Granger. ~Afterwards, during the seasons of 1897-1901, the comparati\,ely little additional reconnaissance which was found necessary to supplement or extend this reconnaissance was done during the field seasons, which were devoted mainly to the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles. The measures of horizontal and vertical angles in the triangulation to the northward were all made by Assistant F. D. Granger during the seasons of 1897, 1898, 1899, and 1900 with one exception. The station Walnut, which was necessary to c9mplete the connection with the Page Base, was occupied by the same observer in 1901.
THE METHODS AND INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF HORIZONTAL ANGLES.

All of the angle measures were made by the direction method. Each series of observations consists of successive pointings on the various stations in order, from left to right, with corresponding readings of the horizontal circle with three micrometer microscopes followed immediately by paintings on the same stations in the reverse order after reversing the position of the telescope by transiting it through the wyes and turning the alidade 180° in azimuth, each pivot remaining in contact with the same wye as before. Each obser:vation of an angle consists, therefore, of two pointings on each station involved, one in each position of the telescope, together with the corresponding micrometer readings, 24 in all, both a forward and a backward reading of each micrometer being made in each of its positions.
*See illustrations Nos. l-4 at the end of this Appendix.

At each station in the triangulation under consideration which was occupied in 1890, 1891, or 1892, theodolite No. IO was used in seventeeen positions and two series of observations were taken in each position, making the total number of measures of each a11gle thirty-four. The horizontal circle of this theodolite is 35cm in diameter and carries a IO' graduation read directly by three micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The telescope has a clear aperture of 2}1! inches (equals 5<m.4) a focal length of 243( inches (equals 61<"'.6) and a magnifying power of 36. At only one of these stations was it found necessary to pla.ce the instrument more than 50 feet above the ground-namely, at Heath (57 feet). During the measures of 1896, all in the vicinity of the Salina Base and serving to connect it with the main triangulation, theodolite No. l l 8 was used in seventeen positions and two series of observations taken in each· position, or thirty-four measures in all.· The horizontal circle of this theodolite is 3o<m in dia1i1eter, is graduated to 51 spaces and is read directly to single seconds by three micrometer mic~oscopes. The telescope has a clear aperture of 6cm, a focal length of 58<m, and a magnifying power of 35. The instrument was not elevated more than 35 feet above the ground at any station. During the measures of l 897, commencing with the station Waldo and ending with Lebanon, theodolite No. l 18 was used in eleven positions and two series of observations were taken in each position, or twenty-two measures in all. The instrument was less than 18 feet above the ground at each station. During the season of 1898, commencing with station Brown and ending with Prosser, theodolite No. II8 was used in thirteen positions, two series being taken in each position, or twenty-six measures in all. At only three stations was the instrument elevated more than 50 feet above the ground, namely, at Brown ( 70 feet), Cooper ( 66 feet), Bltie Hill ( 66 feet). In .three cases, however, the pointings were made upon very tall poles. The pole observed at Cooper from Brown was l 18 feet high. On the line Herrick-Sand Creek there is an obstructing ridge at about the middle of the line. In order to see from instrument to instrument, it would have been necessary to build each instrument tripod about 80 feet high. To save expense, instead of building the instrument tripods to this height, they were each made 50 feet high and a pole 126 feet high ~as observed at Sand Creek from Herrick; similarly, one 121 feet high was observed at Herrick from· Sand Creek. In each of these cases the pole was stwporte<;l ·by the scaffold upon which the observer stands and which is entirely independent of the instrument tripod and was held securely in position by suitable wire guys. During 1899, at the six stations in the Shelton base net, theodolite No. 146 was used in thirteen positions, two series being taken in each position, or twenty-six observations in all upon each angle. Theodolite No. 146* carries a horizontal circle 3o<m in diameter, graduated to s' spaces and read directly by three micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The clear aperture of the telescope is 61mm and its focal length 74<m. Three eye-pieces, magnifying 30, 45, and 60 diameters, respectively, were furnished with the telescope. The highest elevation for the instrument anywhere in the base net was 43 feet at Shelton East Base. In all the observations thus far indicated the circle was used in seventeen, eleven,

or thirteen positions with the readings on the initial station uniformly distributed m·er 360°. Commencing at station Pompey in 1899, this plan was radically changed, as indicated below, and was again changed at the beginning of 1900. Commencing with station Pompey in 1899, during the remainder of the season the instrument was used in the twenty-four positions indicated below, one measure only being made in each position.

The purpose of this change is indicated in the paragraphs following the instructions for 1900 and 1901, given below. At Pompey and the five following stations occupied in 1899 and ending with Brayton the instrument was never more than 50 feet above the ground. ·During the seasons of 1900 and 1901 theodolite No. 146 was again used and the observer was acting under the following instructions:
In making the measurements of horizontal directions, you will measure each direction in the primary scheme sixteen times, a direct and ~ reverse reading being considered one measurement, and sixteen positions of the circle are to be used, corresponding approximately to the following readings upon the initial signal:

When a broken series is observed the missing signals are to be observed later in connection with the chosen initial, or with some other one, and only one, of the stations already observed in that series. In selecting the conditions under which to observe, you should proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and that the average closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated.

In regard to the positions specified in these instructions, it is important to· note three points: I. In each of the four groups of four positions each, the readings of the three microscopes on the circle corresponding to pointings on the initial station will be nearly uniformly spaced at intervals of approximately 15 ° over the whole 360°, and therefore the mean values of the angles from each group of four positions will be but little affected by periodic errors of graduation. In connection with this statement it is necessary to keep in mind that, during each measure, the alidade is turned 180° between the direct and reverse readings when the position of the telescope is changed, and therefore the three microscopes which are at intervals of 120° furnish readings at nearly uniform intervals of 60° duriug each measure. 2. In each· group of four positions the micrometer readings corresponding to the initial station, and therefore those corresponding to each station, are nearly uniformly distributed over the 5' interval covered by the micrometer. The effect of this is to insure that if a correction for run is appli~d, the algebraic sum of such corrections for each micrometer corresponding, to pointings on each station will be nearly zero. In other words, the mean yalue of any angle from observations in four positions uncorrected for run is almost independant of the run. An examination in detail of the observations at two or three stations showed that it was entirely unnecessary to apply any correction for run to observations made under these instructious, and considerable time was thereby saved in making the computation. 3. No microscope ever returns for pointings on a given station to any position on the circle which it has fonnerly occupied. When the observations in sixteen positions have been completed, the circle has been read at ninety-six points, scattered at intervals of three or four degrees over the whole circumference for each station observed. This insures that the mean value of each angle from sixteen positions is still more completely freed from the effect of periodic errors than _are the means from the separate groups of four positions each. Looking back now to the statement of the twenty-four positions used during the latter part of the season of 1899, it will be seeu that many of the good points of the 1900 programme had already been secured in 1899. In 1899 the effect .of the run of the micrometers was not eliminated in each group of four positions but was almost completely eliminated from the mean of the twenty-four positions. The total number of measures was reduced from twenty-four in 1899 to sixteen in 1900 after a careful study in detail of the 1899 observations, and a general study of the relation between the accuracy secured and the number of measures made in previous observations in the United States. It '~·as concluded that the additional measures after sixteen are obtained increase the accuracy of the results very little. At the stations occupied in 1900 the instrumeut was never placed more than 30 feet above the ground. At station Walnut in 1901 it was placed only 15 feet, above the ground. The preceding statements apply to observations at the primary stations only. In observing upon points determined by intersection from primary stations, which will for convenience be called tertiary points, from one to three positions w~re used. For a few secondary points which were occupied to reach other points, but which did not form a part of the primary scheme, an intermediate programme was used.

In all the triangulation here treated the paintings were made upon poles, as a rule, being supplemented by paintings upon heliotropes when much difficulty was encountered in seeing the poles.
PROGRAMME OF OCCUPATION OF STATIONS.

In the following table the stations are arranged approximately in the order in which they were occupied. The second column indicates the days on which observations on primary stations were taken, the third column the number of such days, and the fourth column is added here for convenience to indicate the height of signals. In .general, the pole observed upon was but a few feet higher than the instrument at a given station. The few extraordinary cases in which the pole was extended far above the top of the instrument tripod are mentioned under the previous heading. The height of signal must be considered in connection with the rate of progress, both because the work may be delayed in waiting for the building of signals, and because there is likely to be more delay on account of wind when observing from a high signal than when observing from a low one. It will be noted that the station Iron Mound was occupied twice, once during the progress of the main triangulation, and once for the purpose of connecting with the Salina Base. Similarly, Meades Ranch and Waldo were each occupied twice, first in connection with the transcontinental triangulation, and later at the beginning of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. Station Prosser was also occupied twice, once in 1898, and again after the signals at the Shelton Base had been built in 1899. In the table and in the statements following it, each new occupation of a station is counted as if it were an occupation of a new station, as it is virtually equivalent to a new station at which few directions were observed.

The following data, compiled from the above table and from the preceding state· ment of the number of observations at each station, show clearly how much reduction may be expected in the time spent at the station when the number of observations is reduced. A comparison between the heavy (thirty-four obsen-ations) and the light (sixteen observations) programme is especially fair in this case, since all the observations were made by one man who already had many years of experience, and were made under the same general conditions as to length of lines, height of signals, topography, and climatic conditions.

It is evident that upon an average the reduction of the number of observations from 34 to 16 saved 5.3 observing days at each station. For the whole group of station here treated, 1890-1901, the total number of observing days was 434, and the total number of days from the first day of observation to the last day of observation inclusive at each station was 555. Hence the ratio of the number of observing days at a station to the total number of days at the station, exclusive of the time before the first observation and after the last observation, is 434 to 555, or o. 78. Therefore, the saving of 5.3 observing days at each station i;; equivalent on an average to a saving of nearly seven days of occupation at each station under the average conditions involved in this triaiigulation. It is noteworthy that in the three separate groups of triangulation treated the percentage of observation days in each of the groups agrees with the above-mentioned percentage ( o. 78) within one-half of one per cent. The question whether the reduction in the number of observations has appreciably affec~d the accuracy of the work, will be treated later. There were eight stations at which the instrument was elevated 50 feet or more above the ground. At four of these, namely, Heath, Blue Hill, Sand Creek, and \Vilson, the time of occupation was longer; at three, namely, Brown, Herrick, and Brayton, the time of occupation was the same, and at one, Cooper, the time of occupation was shorter than for the average of the group. It is thus evident that there is a slight tendency for the observations at the high stations to be slower than at the lower stations.
STATE!llENT OF ADJUSTMENTS.

For the stations involved in the transcontinental triangulation local adjustments* were made. From the stations from Meades Ranch-Waldo northward along the ninety-eig')1th meridian to the Page Base but few local adjustments have been made. The computer

made local adjustments at a few stations where the proportion of broken series was greatest, these being the cases in which the local adjustment will in general produce the greatest changes in the angles. These extraordinary cases being carefully studied indicated that the effect of the local adjustment at the remaining· stations would in general be simply to change the angles in the hundredths of seconds, the tenths being seldom affected. It was therefore considered that the time would not be well spent in making these local adjustments, the effects of which would be so small as to be entirely masked by the corrections inevitably applied in the figure adjustments. For the greater number of stations the directions used in the figure adjustments are therefore those resulting directly from the observations after the mere taking- of means. The figure adjustment was made in five sections, viz, the Salina base net, from the Salina base net to the El Paso base net, from Meades Ranch-Waldo to the Shelton base net, the Shelton base net, from the Shelton base net to the Page Base. The adjustment of. the Salina base net is fully set forth in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation,'' pages 182-188. The stations involved are Vine Creek, Iron Mound, Salina East Base, Salina West Base, North Pole Mound, Thompson, and Heath. (See illustration No. r, at the end of this Appendix.) The only fixed line in the figure was the base. The number of observed directions involved was thirty. There were thirteen rigid conditions to be satisfied, nine relating to the closures of the triangles and four to the ratios of sides. The stations west of the Salina base net to and including Blue Hill and Allen, as shown in illustration No. 1 at the end of this Appendix, form a part of the KansasColorado series of triangles between the Salina and El Paso bases, of which the adjustment is shown in'' The Transcontinental Triangulation,'' pages 514-55 r. Two hundred and twenty-five observed directions were involved, and these were connected by ninetynine conditions, of which seventy related \o closures of triangles, twenty~eight to ratios of sides, and the last condition was that the length carried through from Thompson-Heath at the edge of the Salina base net must agree with the length of the line Holcolm HillsBig Springs at the edge of the El Paso base net. The adjustment of the triangulation (see illustration No. 2) from the fixed line l\Ieades Ranch-Waldo to the fixed line Lowell-Prosser of the Shelton base net, which had previously been adjusted, involves seventy-six observed directions connected by twenty-nine rigid conditions, as indicated below, of which twenty-two referred to closures of triangles and six referred to ratios of sides, and the last is that the length carried from Meades Ranch-Waldo must agree with the fixed length of LowellProsser. In the following condition equations the numbers assigned to the directions correspond to those shown in illustration No. 2. S. Doc. 50-24

The adjustment of the triangulation northward from the Shelton base net starts with the two fixed lines Valley-Cameron and Cameron-Prosser at the edge of the Shelton base net and closes on the Page Base, of which the length was fixed by a measurement by a party under Mr. A. L. Baldwin in 1900. (See Appendix 3 of this Rep0rt.) The adjustment involves ninety-six directions connected by forty-three rigid conditions, as indicated below, of which No. r to No. 30 relate to .triangle closures and No. 32 to No. 42 to ratios of sides. The thirty-first is the condition that the length of Cameron-Prosser as computed from Valley-Cameron shall agree with its fixed value, and the last condition is that the Page Base as computed from the line Valley-Cameron at the edge of the Shelton base net shall agree with its measured value.

The ordinary practice in the Coast and Geodetic Survey in adjusting a piece of triangulation comprising two base nets and the intervening triangulation has been, to first adjust each base net by itself independently, then to adjust the intervening triangulation to fit the fixed lines at the borders of the two base nets. In the adjustment indicated above there is a radical departure from this practice. The adjustment starts with the fixed lines on the edge of the Shelton base net, in accordance with the former practice, but ends at the Page Base itself, including both the intervening triangulation and the Page base net in a single adjustment without any distinction between them. The advantages of the former practice were twofold. First, the adjustment was symmetrical. It began and ended with a border line, or lines, of a base net, whereas

TRIANGULATION ALONG NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

373

the new practice is unsymmetrical, beginning with a border line or lines of a base net and ending with a measured base in the midst of another base net. Second, the work of adjustment was somewhat lighter under the former practice than is the case now, since the smaller the number of equations dealt with in each group solved simulta. neously the lighter is the computation. The new practice substitutes a single group for "two groups of equations, namely, one corresponding to the intervening triangulation and one corresponding to the base net. · The increase in computation thus produced is small, though doubtless real. The advantage of the new practice is that greater accuracy is secured. In general, the larger the number of triangles dealt with in a single group of equations, the greater the accuracy attained, since the breaking into groups of triangles necessarily involves the neglect or mutilation of certain rigid conditions actually existing which must be fulfilled by the observed directions. In the case under consideration, the neglected condition is an important one. In the former practice the length equation, expressing the condition that the length of a given base, as computed from a preceding base, must agree with ·the measured length, is only used between the base nets. In other wor:ds, the distortion of the measured angles necessary to make the two bases agree is all forced into the triangulation intervening between base nets, whereas it is a well-known fact that errors in length accumulate more rapidly as a rule within the base net itself, where poor geometric conditions necessarily occur, than in the main chain of triangles between base nets. Thus, under the former practice, the error of length which had accumulated in the whole chain of triangles from base to base was in the adjustment dissipated by distorting the measured angles on the part of the chain in which the rate of accumulation of length error is probably least, leaving the part of the chain in which the rate of accumulation of length error was probably greatest without any adjustment in so far as the length equation is concerned. Under the new practice there is a length equation running through each base net.
ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO OBSERVED DIRECTIONS.

For the purpose of comparison it may be noted that the same quantity for the Salina base net was ± o".44 and for the Kansas-Colorado series of triangles, which includes the triangulation westward from the Salina base net to Meades Ranch-Waldo, was ± o".50.* For comparison it may also be noted that in the twenty-one sections into which the transcontinental triangulation was divided the maximum value of d was ± o" .82 in the American Bottom base net.; the minimum value was ± o". 23 in the NevadaCalifornia series of triangles, and the a\·erage value was ± o".44.* By inspection of the formula for the probable error, d, of an adjusted direction given above it may be seen that if the ratio of the number of directions to the number of conditions is the same in two groups of adjusted triangles the values of d· are proportional to the average values of v". Under these conditions,. then, the average value of the correction to· a direction may be used as a rough means of comparing the accuracy of any one group with any part of some other group, since the probable error of an adjusted direction will be nearly proportional to the average value of corrections to directions in such groups. The values of the ratio, number of directions divided by number of conditions, in the five groups of adjusted triangles here treated are: in the Salina base net, J? = 2. 3;

Hence the mean value of a 43 correction to a direction may be used as an approximate measure of the relative accuracy of the different parts of the triangulation. It is desirable to determine whether the accuracy has been affected appreciably by the reduction in the number of observations of each direction, accompanied, as indicated on page 368, by a corresponding reduction in the number of days on which the observations were taken. Dividing the whole triangulation from Salina Base to Page Base

This evidence is a strong indication that there has been no appreciable reduction in accuracy.
ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES AND CLOSURES OF TRIANGLES.

The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary scheme from the Salina Base to the Page Base, together with the error of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than 180° plus 'the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangle, since it is proportional to the area.

The maximum correction to any angle is -2".30 to the angle at :'.\Ieades Ranch between Heath and Golden Belt measured in 1891. The triangles show 69 closing errors of the plus sign and 46 of the minus sign. The average closing error of a triangle for this whole triangulation, without regard to sign, is o".68 (115 triangles). For comparison it may be noted that the average closing error for the whole transcontinental triangulation is 1".06, and that the average closing error for the 2 l sections into which that triangulation was divided \"aries from a minimum of o".57 in the ~evada-California section to a maximum of 2".22 in the American Bottom base net (see "Transcontinental Triangulation," p. 16 ).

f~_.:J__", in which 2'L1° is the sum of the '\/ 3ll squares of the closing errors of the triangles, and 1t is the number of triangles, is for this triangulation and for the separate groups into which it is divided:

In the transcontinental triangulation the mean error of an angle, computed as indicated above, varies from ±o" . ..J.2 to ±r".59, and its average value is ±o".77. (See "Transcontinental Triangulation," p. 613.) The mean error of an angle as tlms computed from the triangle closnres may be rendered comparable with the probable error of the resulting direction by multiplying it by vt to take account of the fact that an angle is the difference of two directions, and by the factor 0.674, to reduce from a mean error to a probable error. The mean error of an angle, a, for the triangulation between Meades Ranch- \Valdo and Page Base, namely, ±o".42, when reduced to a probable error of direction is ±o".20, whereas the probable error of direction as computed from the figure adjustment for the same section is ±o". 29. (See page 375.) The excess of the second of these values over the first is an indication of the magnitude of the errors which were put in evidence by

the rigid conditions relating to the ratios of sides and the accord in length between bases, and which do not appear from the triangle closures alone. To secure further evidence as to whether the accuracy of the triangulation has been appreciably affected by the reduction of the number of observations of each direction, the following table, similar to that shown on page 376, has been compiled. Certain triangles belong to two different seasons. In such cases the triangle has been credited to the season during which two of its three stations were occupied.

This evidence again indicates dearly that no appreciable reduction in accuracy has occurred on account of the reduction in the number of observations. No attempt has been made here to set forth the agreement of the separate measures of each direction as a criterion of accuracy, since it is well known that it is of little value for that purpose. A close agreement of the separate measures of a given direction is of little consequence, since such measures are usually subject to constant errors of considerable size, which become evident as soon as the closures of the triangles are studied or an attempt is made to adjust a figure. For example, the probable error of a direction computed from the figure adjustment, and therefore including the constant as well as the accidental errors of the measures, is for the observations of 1900-1901, ±011 .29 (see page 375). This probable error refers to the mean of 16 measures. Hence the probable error of a single measure of a direction should be four times as great, namely, ±1 11 .16, and for a single measure of an angle should be vt2 times as large, namely, ± 1 11 · 64. If this probable error were due in the main to accidental errors in ~he angle measures, the range of such measures should occasionally approach or exceed seven times this value, or ll".5. As a matter of fact, the range of such measures at these stations never exceeds 7''. 5, and seldom exceeds 6". 5. This triangulation is therefore no exception to the general rule that the accidental errors in the angle measures are less serious than the constant errors.
THE ACCORD OF THE BASES AND THE ACCURACY OF THE LENGTHS.

In solving the normal equations of the figure adjustment, between l\ieades RanchWa.ldo and the line Lowell-Prosser of the Shelton base net, the length equation was as usual assigned the fast place, so that the discrepancy in length, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of lengths had been satisfied, became known. It thus became evident that the Shelton base, as computed from the line Meades RanchWaldo, which in turn depends for its length on the Salina and El Paso bases (but mainly on the former) was shorter by 1 part in 58 ooo than its measured length (represented by 75 in the seventh decimal place of logarithms). In other words, after the angles S. Doc. 50--25

have been adjusted to close all triangles and to make the computed length of each side the same, whatever one of the several possible chains of triangles are used, the best length which can be derived for the Shelton Base from the triangulation from the southward differs from its measured length by I part in 58 ooo. Similarly the best length which can be derived for the Page Base as computed from the triangulation connecting it with the Shelton Base is r part in 270 ooo longer than its measured length. (This discrepancy is represented by 16 in the seventh decimal place of logarithms.) For comparison it may be noted that the nine discrepancies of this nature between bases on the transcontinental triangulation varied from I part in 724 ooo to r part in 25 700.* Five out of the nine discrepancies were greater than that between the Salina and Shelton bases and seven greater than that between the Shelton and Page .bases. To put the accuracy with which the lengths are determined in evidence, the probable errors for certain lines have been computed from the probable errors of the base measures and of the angle measures. The length of the line Thompson-Heath at the edge of the Salina base net, depending on the measures of the Salina Base and the angle measures in the base net, is 31 563"'.71±0111 · 16, its probable error being, therefore, I part in 200 000. Similarly the length of the line Meades Ranch-\Valdo from the adjustment is 25 783"'. l r and its probable error is ±0 111 .204, or r part in 126 ooo. This probable error has been computed as if Meades Ranch-Waldo depended for its length on the Salina Base alone, whereas its length is really dependent on both the Salipa and El Paso bases. As the Salina Base is, however, very much nearer than the El Paso Base, the above probable error is but little too large. The adjusted length of the line Lipps-Cooper which is about midway between Meades Ranch-Waldo and Lowell-Prosser, the two fixed lines in the adjustment, is 22 983"'. 18. The probable error of this line, when computed from the southward only, depends upon the probable error of Meades Ranch-Waldo, as shown above, and the additional errors accumulated in the intervening angle measures and is ±o"'.227, or r part in 101 ooo. Its probable error when computed from the northward alone depends upon the probable error of the line Lowell-Pr~sser, as shown below, and the errors accumulated in the inter\'ening angle measures, and is ±o"'. 135, or l part in 170 ooo. The length of the line Lipps-Cooper as fixed in the adjustment is necessarily nearly a mean between its two possible independent lengths, as computed from the southward and northward, respectively. Hence, with sufficient accuracy the probable error of the adjusted length of the line Lipps-Cooper is Yz-'1(o:2-i7)"+(0:!;3s)'. or l part in 174 ooo. We may note here that twice 1 part in l/4 ooo, or r pa.rt in 87 ooo, represents the probable error of the discrepancy between the two bases, Salina and Shelton, as brought together on this line, since the probable error of the difference of the two quantities is necessarily double the probable error of their mean. The actual discrepa11cy between the bases is 1 part in 58 ooo, not very different from its probable error, but somewhat in excess of it. The lengths of the lines Lowell-Prosser and Valley-Cameron at the e::dge of the Shelton base net are respectively 22 944.02 and 2 r 180.56 meters and their - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ---······---------------*See the "Transcontinental Triangulation," pp. 613-6r4.

probable errors are ±om.069 and ±0 .05 r, or l part in 333 ooo and l part in 415 ooo, respectively. These probable errors are computed from the probable error of the Shelton base measures and the computed errors of the angle measures in the Shelton base net. Similarly the length of the line Prairie-Walnut, near the Page Base, and its probable error, as computed from the uncertainties as in measures of the Page Base and in the angles concerned, are 18 196m. 70 and ±om.030, or the probable error is l part in 607 ooo. The line Buffalo-Ono is about midway between the two fixed lines in the adjustment covering this region. It is eight triangles from Valley-Cameron and six triangles from the Page Base. The probable error of its length, as computed from the southward only, including the uncertainty in the length of Valley-Cameron, shown above, is ±om. 164. The probable error of its length, as computed from the northward only, depending upon the uncertainties of the Page Base measures and the uncertainties in the angle measures in the intervening triangulation, is ±o"'. 167. The length of this line as fixed by the adjustment being necessarily nearly a mean between its two possible independent lengths, computed from the southward and northward, its probable error is ±om.117, or l part in 229 ooo, its adjusted length being 26 74]"'.68. The probable error of the discrepancy between the Shelton and the Page bases is 2 parts in 229 ooo, or l part in l 14 ooo. The actual discrepancy is l part in 270 ooo, very much smaller than its probable error.
ACCURACY AND ECONOMY.

In fixing the method of triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian the aim has constantly been to hold the accuracy up to the standard fixed by the best half of the transcontinental triangulation, a standard of accuracy which compares very favorably with that actually attained in any country. With equal constancy there has been kept in view the desirability of reducing the cost of the triangulation and the time required for it as much as possible while holding the accuracy up to this high standard. The time required for, and the cost of, the office computations have been kept in mind. That the accuracy has been kept up to the selected standard and abo\·e it is put in evidence by the corrections to directions, closures of triangles, accord between bases, and probable errors of lengths as set forth in the preceding pages. It is also noticeable that the accuracy has not decreased with the gradual change of methods as the triangulation proceeds northward. A considerable amount of time has been saved in the office part of the work by omitting all corrections for run during the latter part of the work and by making very few local adjustments, the fom1er being entirely unnecessary with the present programme of observation and the latter but seldom needed. A small amount of time has also been saved in the field by utilizing the field computation as au insurance against loss and making no duplicates of records excetpt of the descriptions of stations. The principal saving in the field in time and money has been in the reduction of the number of observations of each direction. The reduction from 34 to 16 observations saves on an average seven days at each station. During 1900 it took on an average fourteen days to make the observations at a station and to move to the next and prepare

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 190r.

for observation. If the change were made back from the 16-observation programme of 1900 to the 34-observation programme of 1896 it would take seven days, or 50 per cent, longer at each station, the cost would be increased in nearly that ratio, and the increase in accuracy would be imperceptible. Even to go back to the programme of from 22 to 26 observations used in 1897-1899 would increase the time at each station by more than two days, or 14 per cent, with a corresponding increase of cost.
EXPLANATION 01: POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AND AZil\IUTHS, AND OF THJ<: UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustments, all depend upon the Page, Shelton, Salina, and El Paso Bases, the last mentioned having but little effect upon the lengths. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and the azimuths-need a special explanation. All of the positions and <1;zimuths have been computed upon the Clark spheroid of 1866, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, before the computation of latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience let the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together \vith the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, be called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. \Vith the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in 1899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involved much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March I3, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in :New England, and therefore its adoption will not affect the positions which have been used for geographic purposes in New England* and along the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, or those in the States of -------------.

* l\Iany such positions are puhlished in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1885, Appendix No. 8, for 1888, and Appendix ~o. IO, for 1894.

New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation'' and in ''The Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States,'' publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it is in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully. The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths to engineers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area coYered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be derived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is desirable simply that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observatians which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable tiiat one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely neces.'iary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. This is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirablt: that when a certain spheriod and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed ·by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. It is, however, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, desirable, in dealing with this problem, that with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possihll! accuracy, and new values of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. · The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were : First, the adopted datum should not differ widely'from the ideal datum in which the sum of the station errors in latitude. longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in

390

COAST AND GEODETIC SlJRVEY REPORT, 19<H.

the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and third, it was desirable, other things being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a miminum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina. An examination of the approximate station errors available on the United States Standard Datum at 204 latitude stations, 68 longitude stations, and 126 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely to the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. How closely it approaches to that ideal will be set forth in a later publication. The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch, as follows:

The positions here published on the United States Standard Datum therefore differ considerably from those given in the Transcontinental Triangulation'' (pp. 854-865), which depend upon a spt!cial geodetic datum which was adopted for the special purpose of that publication, and which was based upon the astronomic obseryations connected with that triangulation alone.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR \'EY REPORT,

1901,

TABLE OF POSITIONS, AZIMUTHS, AND LENGTHS.

The following tables give the positions of all points, and the azimuths and lengths of all lines, fixed by the triangulation here treated. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the four sketches at the end of this appendix and the preceding index. In the second column of the index will be found for each point, first a reference to the page on which its position is given, and following this a reference to each page on which the azimuth and length of any line radiating from this point may be found. The positions of all points for which the latitudes and longitudes are given to thousandths of seconds have been fixed by a complete adjustment of the triangulation concerned, so as to make all the triangles close and remove all discrepancies between lengths, azimuths, and positions. Such adjustments are of a very high degree of accuracy, as indicated in the preceding pages, for points on the primary scheme, of a less degree of accuracy for secondary points, and of a still more approximate character for tertiary points determined by intersections only. In each class all discrepancies are removed to the limit given by the decimal place shown. The statements in regard to the various degrees of accuracy refer to the manner in which the discrepancies were removed. If less than three decimal places are given in the latitudes and longitudes the point in question has not been fixed by fully adjusted triangulation, or is fixed in such a way as to furnish no check on its position, and the accuracy with which its position is known is indicated in part by the number of decimal places given. ·The seconds in meters are given for the convenience of draftsmen. In the columns giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances various numbers of decimal places are given, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure.

GENERAL STATEMENT IN REGARD TO THE DETERMINATION OF ELEVATIONS ALONG THE NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

While the measurement of horizontal angles was in progress at each station the vertical angles to each station of the primary scheme were also measured on as many days as possible. Vertical measures were also made to many secondary and tertiary stations. The observations in the primary scheme were reciprocal, but not simultaneous; that is, each line was observed in both directions, but at different times. The vertical ·measures were all made during the middle part of the day, when the refraction is near its minimum value and when its diurnal change is slow. ·The zenith distances of two or more of the stations visible from a given station were observed directly with a vertical circle. The vertical angles to the other visible stations were determined by measuring the differences of the zenith distance between tht:se stations and the two or more of which the absolute measures had been made. For this purpose an eye-piece micrometer on the telescope of tht> theodolite used in measuring the horizontal angles was employed. It is useless to aim at a high degree of accuracy in such vertical measures over lines from 10 to 30 miles long or longer, since the irregular variation of the refraction from hour to hour and day to day produces changes in vertical angles which affect the tens of seconds, and sometimes even the minutes. All differences of elevation computed

from such observations are subject to large errors, due to these atmospheric changes, regardless of the degree of refinement of the instrumental measures. The accuracy of the elevations determined along the ninety-eighth meridian would probably have been increased somewhat by extending the observations at each station over many days, but such slight increase in accuracy would not have justified the extra expenditure of time and money. The accuracy of the elevations has been kept within such limits as to make them valuable for topographic and cartographic purposes by frequent connection of the measures with bench marks of which the elevations have been accurately determined by precise leveling forming a part of the level net covering the eastern half of the United States.
COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY OF THE ELEVATIONS.

The zenith distances and the differences of the zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed. At each station at which the zenith distances of two or more stations were obser~1 ed, and differences of zenith distances were also measured, involving these stations as well as the remaining stations, certain rigid conditions existed between the observed quantities. An approximate adjustment was made to satisfy these conditions, and the resulting zenith distances for all stations derived. These zenith distances were corrected for height of object observed and of instrument so as to refer them all to the ground at each station, or to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme was then computed from the observations over the line adjoining them by the fonnula I

in which h and h, are the elevations of the stations, C. and C, are the measured zenith distances, sis the horizontal distance between the stations, and pis the radius of curvature. As there are always two or more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The least square adjustment was made in two sections. The first adjustment involved all stations in the pril}1ary scheme from the Salina Base to and including the Shelton base net as shown in Illustrations Nos. r, 2, and 3, and including also the secondary station Russell Southeast Base and Russell Northwest Base. The second adjustment involved all the remaining stations of the primary scheme to and including those in the Page base net. In the following table the observed differences of elevations treated in the first adjustment are shown together with their adjusted values. The weight, p, assigned to each observed difference of elevation was made inversely proportional to the length s of the line .between stations and was cotweniently computed by the formula log p = 9-2 logs. The observed difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named minus the ele\'ation of the. first. The quantity v in the last column but one is the correction to be applied to observations to obtain the difference of adjusted elevations. S. Doc. 50--27

The elevations of 29 remammg stations indicated by the observations are the 29 unknowns determined by least squares from the 87 differences of elevations indicated above. The probable error of an observation of weight unity as derived from the adjustment is ±0.47 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 19_0 miles (=31k 111 .7) long (this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight) determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.47 meter. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1901,

The probable errors of the elevations of the eight stations fixed by precise leveling are about ± o. 11 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Station Brown was estimated to be the one least accurately determined and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and found to be ± 0.28 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, or when combined with the probable error of the elevation furnished by precise leveling it was± 0.30 meter. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme between the Salina and Shelton Bases there is about an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.3 meter, or about 1 foot, and for most stations the accuracy is much greater than this. The results of the second adjustment in which the stations concerned are those from Valley, Cameron, and Prosser on the edge of the Shelton base net to the Page Base, are shown below in the form used for the first adjustment .

In this second adjustment the elevations of four stations were taken as fixed, namely: Valley and Cameron fixed by the previous adjustment, their elevations.being 696. 19 and 639. 19 meters respectively, and the stations Page Southwest Base and Page Northeast Base fixed by precise leveling, their elevations being 626.63 and 580.98 meters, respectively. The elevations of the fifteen remaining stations indicated by the observations are the fifteen unknowns determined by the least squares from the thirty-nine observed differences of elevations given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity as derived from the adjustment is ± o. 23 meter. The length of line corresponding to unity weight was again 3 I. 7 kilometers (1973 miles). The probable error for the elevation of stations fixed by precise leveling is about ± o. 10 meter. The station Elm was estimated to be the one least accurately determined. Its probable error, computed from the vertical measures line, is± 0.32 meter, or combined with the uncertainty of the elevations fixed by precise leveling it is± o. 34 meter. In this section, therefore, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme there is about an even chance that the elevation is correct within o. 3 meter, or within I foot, and for most stations the accuracy is much greater than this. It is interesting to note that in spite of the fact that the observations were made on a smaller number of days at each station, that the probable error corresponding to unit weight is much smaller than in the southern group of observations, being± 0.23 meter as compared with :±: 0.47 meter. The elevations of various tertiary stations outside the primary scheme which were determined by observations of vertical angles from the primary stations were computed by using the following formula, which is applicable to the observations made in one direction only over each line,

in which m is the coefficient of refraction. The value of the coefficient of refraction used on each line was a mean value derived from a group of lines in the primary scheme in the general locality in question, it beiHg assumed that the most important conditions affecting the coefficient which can be effectively taken into account are the influence of the region and of the climatic conditions of the particular year and months during which the observations were taken. The computed differences of elevations being combined with the adjusted elevations at the primary stations, there were obtained for each tertiary station as many determinations of its elevations as there were lines to it. The weighted mean of these was adopted and is given in the following table of elevations. The weights assigned to the different lines were inversely proportional to the squares of the lengths of the lines. These tertiary elevations are of course of .a much lower grade of accuracy than the elevations of the primary stations. Occasionally the separate determinations of the elevation of one of these points differ by as much as a meter.
TABLE OF ELEVATIONS.

The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes. First. Those fixed directly by the precise leveling and of which the elevation is subject to probable error of ±o. 1 I meter.

Second. The primary stations fixed by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±0.30 to ±0.34 meter. Third. The tertiary stations of which the elevatious are fixed by measures of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the tertiary stations not being occupied. These elevations are subject to probable errors which may be as great as ±0.5 meter in some cases. For more exact elevations of the stations fixed by precise leveling and for an exact statement of the points on each station mark to 'vhich such elevations are referred, the published results of precise leveling should be consulted.
