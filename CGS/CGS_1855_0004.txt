REPORT.
l\1Anrn, October 23, 1855. Srn: As required by law and the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to sub_mit a report of the progress of the coast survey under my superintendence for the past year. The work has been in progress, as for the last three years, in all the States where it is not essentially completed. My report of progress is divided into three parts: the introduction, containing general statements and references to the more d~tailed notices of the other parts of the report ; the description of all the operations classed geographically, according to sections ; and the appendix, containing lists., reports, memoirs, and papers relating to the survey immediately or growing out of its operations. I. The introduction gives: 1st. Some general statements and notices of the principal subjects which are found in detail in the other portions of the report and remarks. 2d. A condensed statement of the progress during the past year, arranged geographically. 3d. The estimated progress for the next fiscal year, with the estimates of means necessary to secure that progress. II. The next division contains a detailed account of the work in the field and afloat generally to the 1st of November, 1855, classed geographically by sections, and arranged in each section under the heads of reconnaissance, astronomical work, triangulation, topography, and hydrography. The labors of each officer are then stated, and the statistics reported by him. A very brief summary of the operations precedes the details to facilitate reference to them, and the office-work of the section is noticed in a very general way. Each section forms, as it were, a chapter, and can be referred to easily, being numbered in order from one to eleven. After the work in the field and afloat is a separate chapter of office-work, which closes this part of tho report. III. The papers in the appendix are classified under the following general heads: 1. General lists. 2. Coast Survey reports and correspondence, subdivided into-A, developments and discoveries; B, special surveys and reconnaissances ; C, commerce and commercial facilities; D, tides and magnetic results ; E, office-work. 3. Special scientific matters, classed as-A, geodetic and astronomical ; B, magnetic ; C, tidal and current ; D, miscellaneous. 4. Miscellaneous correspondence. 5. Light-house matters. 6. List of sketches accompanying the report, and sketches, maps, and diagrams. An abstract of the contents of the report and appendix, with reference to the pages, and an alphabetical index, precede the report. The object of this mode of treating the subject, and of the several divisions, were fully explained in my report of last year. The limit~ of the geographical sections into which, for convenience, the survey is divided, and which, from the data. before me when the division was made, were supposed to contain about equal amounts of shore line, are as follows : SECTION I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith, inoluding the coast of the States oi Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusettri1, and Rhode Island.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

SECTION II. From Point Judith to Cape Henlopen, including the coast of Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and part of Delaware. SECTION III. From Cape Henlopen to Cape Henry, including the coast of part of Delaware, Maryland, and part of Virginia. SECTION IV. From Cape Henry to Cape Fear, including part of Virginia and North Carolina. SECTION V. From Cape :Fear to the St. Mary's river, including part of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. SECTION VI. From the St. Mary's river to St. J oecph' s bay, coast of Florida, and including и, the Florida reefs and keys. SECTION VII. From St. Joseph's bay to Mobile bay, including part of the coast of Florida and Alabama. SECTION VIII. From Mobile bay to Vermilion bay, including the coast of Mississippi and part of Louisiana. SECTION IX. From Vermilion bay to the boundary, including part of the coast of Louisiana. and that of Texas. SECTIONS X AND XI. Coast of California and of Oregon and Washington Territories. Taking in hand the small sketch of the coast which accompanies the chart of magnetic lines, the progress of the survey may be traced in a general way. The triangulation extends with two breaks only, one of ten and one of fifty miles, from Penobscot bay, Maine, to a point ten miles below the Cape Fear, in North Carolina, taking in the sounds and the greater number of bays and rivers to the head of navigation : from thence onward it has included "\Yinyah bay and Georgetown harbor; Charleston harbor, and thence to St. Helena sound; Tybee entrance and its vicinity; the Savannah river to the head of Argyle island; St. Simon's.entrance and Brunswick harbor; Cumberland entrance (St. Mary's) and Fernandina; the St. John's to Jacksonville; the Florida reefs and keys from Virginia key to Key Rodriguez, and from Loggerhead key to the Marquesas; the coast of South Florida ; from the Miami to the head of theи Gulf of Florida ; Crystal river offing to Cedar keys ; Ocilla river иentrance ; St. Andrew's bay and its dependencies ; Mobile bay and Mississippi sound ; Chandeleur sound, connecting Mobile and New Orleans through Lake Borgne and Pontchartrain; Atehafalaya bay, from Point au Fer to Cote Blanche bay; Galveston lower and upper bays, and east and west bays ; the coast of Texas, from Galveston entrance to Palacios bay, and the entrance to the Rio Bravo del Norte. This triangulation rests upon eight final and many preliminary bases; the main bases are in Massachusetts, New York, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and Miss1ss1ppi. On the western coast the main triangulation extends from Sonoma mountain, north of San Francisco, to below Monterey ; and other triangulations have been made of Rosario straits, the Canal de Haro, and the islands between ; of harbors in Puget's sound and its dependencies, and of part of the sound itself; of Columbia river entrance, and up to Astoria ; of Humboldt bay; of Ballenas bay; of Monterey; of San Pedro, and of San Diego bay, a.nd includes in preliminary surveys all the ports of California and Oregon, and part of those of Washington. A general hydrographic reconnaissance has been made of the whole western coast, with accurately determined geographical positions of the principal capes, headlands, and ports. The topography, which, based upon the triangulation, gives the details of the shore and of the interior as far as is necessary for the purposes of the navigator in enabling him to recognise the land, or for a land communication, follows it closely. Besides detached worli in Casco bay, it extends with few breaks, except those of the coast line, from Great Boar's Head, north of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to the head of Bogue sound, North Carolina. It has accompanied all the rest of tho work mentioned in tracing the triangulation, being generally about one season only behind the most advanced parts of it, on the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific, so that where the progress belongs to any year previous to the last, the topography has generally

been executed.

The hydrography follows in its turn, requiring for its complete development the topography ; but in special cases substituting reconnaissance for survey. Detached hydrographic work has been done in Maine, east of the Penobscot; in Casco bay, and in its vicinity; at Portsmouth, Newburyport, Ipswich, and Annisquam. Massachusetts bay is nearly complete, and from Cape Cod to the North Carolina line, including that extremely difficult work of the Nantucket shoals, and the broken ground east, north, and south of them, the bay of the :fi.\'e States, the Vineyard and Long Island sounds, New York bay, and its dependencies, Delaware bay and river, the Chesapeake, and several of its rivers. South of this the hydrography includes Albemarle sound, N. C., the Wimble and Hatteras shoals, Hatteras cove, Hatteras inlet, Ocracoke inlet, Core sound, Cape Looko~t shoals, the Fryingpan shoals, Beaufort entrance and harbor, and dependencies, Cape Fear shoals, entrances and river, Winy ah bay and Georgetown harbor, S. 0., Cape Roman shoals, Bull's bay, Rattlesnake shoah, Charleston entrance and harbor, and approaches, the seacoast from Charleston bar to North Edisto river, North Edisto entrance, Port Royal entrance, and Beaufort river and harbor, Martin's Industry shoal, Gaskin banks, Tybee entrance, Georgia, and Savannah river, to the head of Argyle island, the passes through the Romerly marshes, Doboy inlet, St. Simon's entrance, St. Mary's entrance and Fernandina harbor, Florida, St. John'.s entrance and river to Jacksonville, the Florida reef frorn Cape Florida to Key Rodriguez, Key Biscayne bay, Legare and Turtle harbors, Key West entrances and harbor, Rebecca and Isaac shoals, the Tortugas, Tampa bay, (reconnaissance,) Cedar Keys harbor and approaches, Ocilla river entrance, Apalachicola bay and harbor, and St. Mark's, (reconnaissance,) St. Andrew's bay and dependencies, Mobile entrance and bay to the head of Mobile river, Alabama, Mississippi sound frorn Giant's pass, Mississippi, nearly to Lake Dorgne, Louisiana, the outer coast from Dauphine island, Mississippi, to Ship and Cat islands, part of Chandeleur bay, Louisiana, the passes of the Mississippi, Pass Fourchon, (reconnaissance,) part of Atchafalaya bay, Vermilion bay and Calcasieu entrance, (reconnaissance,) Sabine entrance and river, (reconnaissance,) Galveston entrance and lower and upper bays, the seacoast frorn Galveston bar to opposite Cedar lake, Aransas pass, (reconnaissance,) the Rio Grande entrance. The developments useful to commerce and navigation, made in the couree of a very large extent of work, are of course numerous, and a full statement of them, continued from my report of last year, is given in the Appendix No. 9. The calls for information from the archives, and the numerous applications for reportE, maps and charts, show that these are not the only claims of the coast survey to usefulness. The calls are made notwithstanding the very large distribution of the annual reports of the survey by Congress, amounting, during the past two years, to nearly twenty thousand copies, showing that the demand for the reports, and for the maps and sketches which accompany them, exists in quarters not reached even by this large distribution. The pressure which increased prices of labor and supplies of all kinds had brought upon us, threatened so seriously to impede our progress, that last yeal.' I asked for an increase of the appropriations to meet this increase. This was recommended by the Secretary of the Treasury and granted by Congress, so that I have this year been able to keep up the scale of the survey, which otherwise must have been contracted to meet the increased expenditures of the work in the field, afloat, and in the office. Unforeseen expenses have come upon us for injuries to our small vessels, by storms, which have been necessarily met from means that otherwise would have ~en devoted to adtlitional work. One of the disasters which will involve us in the most considerable of the unforeseen expenses of the present year, is the explosion of the boiler of the steamer Hetzel. This occurred while the vessel was moving and under apparently no extraordinary pressure of steam. The reports of the commander of the vessel and of an officer of the army who w&e on board, on coast survey duty at the time, are given in Appendix No. 66. By request <>f the Navy Department, an investige.tion into the circumstances of the explosion has been directed.

4

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT

The best idea of the progress of the work during the past year is to be had, in the least time, by examining the list, Appendix No. 1, which shows the distribution of the :field parties and of those afloat during the year, the officers in charge of them, the localities of work, and the progress made by each party; then by passing to Appendix No. 36, in which the office lists show the progress in the several divisions there. The summary, I am convinced, will be deemed entirely satisfactory. It shows a very large amount of labor, physical and mental, on the part of the officers of the survey, and of bodily labor of the men under their charge. Since the date of my last report :five officers of the army, who had considerable experience in the work, have been relieved from service upon it, viz: Captain T. J. Cram, of the topographical engineers, and Brevet Major Henry Prince, Captain E. O. 0. Ord: Lieutenant D. T. Van Buren, and Lieutenant James 'fotten, of the line of the army-the fourth named officer at his own request. Arrangements were made to supply the places of these officers and to detail the additional officers provided for under the rules of the Secretary of War, but the exigencies of the v\Tar Department have not permitted them thus far to be carried out. I have иno doubt that when these exigencies shall be less pressing, the vacant places will be filled. The loss of the varied scientific ability of Captain Cram has been felt in our operations. No officer or civilian has come under my notice who has superior powers to Major Prince in reconnaissance, including the execution in the :field, and the power of communicating the information obtained. Personal inconveniences were only regarded by him in the light of incidents varying the routine of the work, and his outfit and appliances were always on the most economical scale consistent with efficiency. '\Vherever he went, all persons with whom he came in contact were interested in assisting him in attaining objects which so much interested him. His combinations were happy, his coup d'reil perfect, his sketches with pencil and pen characteristic and rapid. I feel it due to this officer, who has devoted so much time and energy and talent to the coast survey, to speak out in regard to his services. I would also refer to the Appendix No. 68 for an expression of my views on this same subject, transmitted to the honorable Secretary of War, with the request from the Treasury that they might be placed on the files of the War Department. The number of officers of the army at present attached to the survey is eleven~ (Appendix: No. 2,) viz:и .Three from the corps of engineers, one from the corps of topographical engineers, four from the artillery, and three from the infantry. Nine additional officers are required to :fill the number authorized by the Secretary of War. The number of officers of the navy attached to the coast survey on hydrographic duty were, on the first of September, fifty-nine, being an increase of four upon the details of the previous year, and a decrease of two from 1853. Of the fifty-five sea officers thus attached, (see list in Appendix No. 3 bis,) twenty-seven only were connected with the survey a year ago, so that the rotation of forty-four per cent. to which I referred last year as crippling the parties by its rapidity, has been exceeded during the past year, Allowance shoхld be made for this in considering the hydrographic results of the survey. Were it not that the present enlightened head of the Navy Department has made it a point to permit the survey to retain the chiefs of parties, and thus to have the advantage of experience in the directing mind, the results would have been disastrous. It is true that some of the officers detailed have previously been connected with the survey ; but it is equally. true that even these must, in the progress of the work, require new training under the new circumstances in which they are placed. The very favorable consideration which the Secretary of the Navy shows towards this work has remedied some of the minor evils to which I felt it my duty to refer in my last report. The new laws relating to seamen have secured to us, also, a better class of men, as a general rule, than we had before their passage. In the details of naval engineers there has al.so been an improvement in the increased number of more experienced engineers allowed to us. Some of the facts relating to this branch of service in former years were quite of a startling character in reference to the want of experience of the engineers sent to us. On the first of September there were three first assistant engineers on cout

survey service, the lowest grade of which, in my judgment, should be sent to have the control of the engine and boilers of a vessel, containing so many officers and men whose lives are. valuable to the country and engaged in a work the expenditure for which may be so much increased or diminished, according to the skill and knowledge of the engineers. The number of first, second, and third assistant engineers connected with the survey on the first of September was fourteen ; of these eight were third assistants. I am aware that there are cases of distinguished ability and knowlege in the junior grades of assistants ; but I speak of the rule, and not of the exceptions, and consider the lives and property at stake to require all the experience for their case which can possibly be allotted to them. The list of naval officers being, according to usage, made up to the first of March and :first of September, near the periods when the changes are made from north to south in surveying, or from the o.ffi_ce to afloat, none of the results of the action of the Naval Efficiency Board appear upon them, nor have the results of this action been fully developed so as to make it desirable to speak of them up to the date of this report. The developments and discoveries of the past year have been numerous, although not any one ranking probably so high in importance as the discovery of Stellwagen's bank, made last year. I have placed with the developments the examinations made of the entrances to some harbors which are just now attracting a good deal of attention, and which will be carefully surveyed before the next year closes. A list of developments and discoveries by the Coast Survey, from the beginning of the work to the close of 1854, is contained in Appendix No. 9. 1. Extension of Stellwagen's bank to the southward and eastward, some sixteen or seventeen square miles, enclosed by the twenty-fathom curve. 2. Determinations of rocks off Marblehead and Nahant. 3.

tion I, will be found full notices of the other developments in the Section, except those relating to the tides. Last year quite an elaborate series of observations was planned and executed, and the discussion of them made under my immediate direction, and while it showed important progress made, also proved that some additional data were necessary to fully comprehend the subject, the interest of which to the navigation of these sounds cannot be over-estimated. These new observations are noticed briefly-in Section I, and more fully in Appendix No. 33. They will undergo immediate discussion. These investigations will reduce to rule some observations of tides and tidal currents, which apparently were quite wit.bout regularity. To test the idea of a current setting on the shore of Long Island, in the great bay between Gay Head and Cape l\Iay, which may be called the bay of the five States, (as the term New York bay has been appropriated to a much smaller, though exceedingly important sheet of water,) the experiments described in the hydrography of Section II were made, aoo with the negative result that of all the bottles thrown in between Nantucket and New York entrance, but one was reported, though the Routh side of Nantucket and the Vineyard were specially searched, and notices were circulated in all the local papers of Long Island and the vicinity. That one of these bottles should be picked up on the bar at the island of Santa Cruz, one of the Azores, is a fact full of interest and instruction, and suggestive of an important field of research, which I propose at once to occupy. The maps of an important locality, made at intervals of a few years, give the means of knowing the direction and amount of change taking place, of studying the causes, and of applying the principles of engineering to controlling and modifying them. Such has already proved true in reference to parts of New York harbor, surveyed thoroughly in 1836, and re-surveyed within a few years. The changes developed are of great importance in the commercial development of that great sea-port, and the facility with which they are generalized will appear from the notice of them given in the Appendix No. 24. The new survey making for the Commissioners will do for the whole harbor what the partial surveys have done for limited portions of it. The fact established by Lieut. Comg. Craven, that the straits of Florida, between Cape Florida and Bernini, are but three hundred and seventy fathoms deep (about four tenths of mile) in their deepest part, overturns muck of the speculation which has in former times been rife upon this matter. The existence of the waters of the polar current below those of the Gulf Stream, even as far south as latitude 259░ 36' N., established by the same observer, is a fact of great interest; the temperature of the surface-water being eighty degrees Fahrenheit. Lieut. Comg. Craven found the water at the depth just named to be but two degrees of Fahrenheit's scale above the freezing-point of fresh water. The mean temperature of the sea on this section, if the waters could be mingled from top to bottom, would at the time of exploration have been 64░ Fahrenheit, while that of the air was probably not less than 75░ Fahrenheit. The great pressures and low temperatures thus afforded by the ocean must find. application in scientific experiment or in useful art. The following up of the range of hills beyond the Gulf Stream, first discovered in 1858, and extending in the same general direction with the curve of the stream, from the Florida channel nearly to Cape Lookout, is one of those happy results of combined perseverance, skill, and intelligence which cannot be too highly praised. Using the coast survey chart of the Gulf Stream as a basis, the accomplished hydrographer who made this exploration seems to have been at no loss to place his sounding-line just where the bottom would be reached at about the expected depth. I have given notice of these observations in some detail under the head of "Gulf Stream," between Sections III and IV of this report. The existence at the bottom of the ocean beneath the Gulf Stream, from the latitude of 3go to Cape Florida, of cold water, much colder than belongs to the latitude, has been proved by direct observation in different years. The destiny of the Cape Fear country, with all its resources and enterprise, hangs in a great

degree upon the facility of entrance to this admirable river. Surveys can and will show the progress of changes there, and are the only means by which improvement can be guided. The officer who, regardless of his own personal comfort, has volunteered, while passing from one section of the survey to another, to take up the difficult work of re-examining the Cape Fear entrances, deserves the gratitude of all who have an interest in the resources, and share in the enterprise to which I have alluded. The results as given under the head of hydrography of Section IV, will be found of decided interest. The favorable changes in the main ship-channel into Charleston harbor, and in the bulkhead which closes Maffitt' s channel towards the harbor, have been chronicled by the same officer ( Appendix No. 15) whose name has been given to the channel by the citizens of Chatleston in token of their appreciation of his services in regard to it. That nature is at this time struggling to open a channel here, and requiring only assistance from art, is quite certain, and now is the time, while the play of forces is tending to do the work, to give the necessary help to confirm the beneficial action. Circumstances may change. By occasional effort-directed, however, in a systematic way-we are gradually arriving at a knowledge of the depth of the Gulf of Mexico without specially employing a party for the deepsea work. The lines run this year are of interest, though the depths being obt&ined with the lead-line, can only be considered as rough approximations. The entire series of tidal observations necessary to the study of the general motion of the tide-wave in the Gulf of Mexico, and of the principal tidal phenomena of its ports and harbors, have been completed, requiring merely, when more minute investigations succeed these general ones, filling up between principal stations. We have now reliable results for fourteen tidal ~ations, each occupied for more than two lunations, and four for a year or more. The tidal movement in the Florida channel is traced hy four stations from Cape Florida to the Tortugas ; that along the western coast of the peninsula by four stations; that along the north shore of the Gulf, between Cape San Blas and the mouths of the Mississippi, by five stations; that between the Mississippi and the Sabine by three stations ; and that on the western side of the Gulf, between Galveston and the Rio Grande, by four stations. The observations at these points have been reduced according to methods introduced by myself and modified in the tidal division, and when they admitted of it, according, also, to those of Mr. Lubbock. The observed tide-wave has been decomposed into its two chief constituents, the diurnal and semi-diurnal waves, and these have been followed in their changes. There is yet much to be done in the study of these results, but they have already, while furnishing all the data required for practical purposes for tide-tables for our useful charts, yielded much richer fruit, and will ultimately give the clue to the somewhat complex: system of tides of the Gulf of Mexico. The simple result, that the tide-wave passes across from the Tortugas to the mouth of the Mississippi, there being a difference of but about an hour in the occurrence of the high waters at those two points, is of itself sufficient to stimulate curiosity, and to show that there is much to be unravelled. To state this in another point of view, the semi-diurnal tide at the mouth of the Mississippi is earlier than it is to the east of the Delta or to the west, though this point is deep up the Gulf, as it were, and the question might suggest itself how the tide gets there without touching either of the shores. The curves which represent the law of rise and foll, and time of the compound tide of each of the principal ports, and the two chief components or type curves of the tides of the Gulf, as they may be called, have been satisfactorily determined. They are very characteristic at the periods when the diurnal tide is the greatest and least, nalflely, when the moon is farthest from the equator, and when crossing it. 'l'hese tides are especially a coast survey development, for I am not aware that even the phenomena were known, much less the laws of them understood~ until the Coast Survey observations and investigations were made. The curious circumstance, that in many of the ports the tide ebbed and flowed as a rule but once a day, and that to this rufo there were exceptions, while in others it rose and fell regularly twice

in twenty-four (lunar) hours, was of itself known to but few persons. Navigators, generally, attributed the rise and fall of the waters of the Gulf to the winds, and their apparent regularity for days together and then sudden irregularity, to the general trade-wind, character of the winds, and to their exceptional changes. The determination of the position of a rock so far at sea as the Cortez rock is a matter of great difficulty, and I am less surprised that it was missed in the :first reconnaissance of the Cortezи, bank, than that it was found in the recent examination. The Uncle Sam rock is nearer the coast, and no difficulty existed in :finding it when the position was approximately known. Rocks along coasts and in harbors are extremely difficult to find unless where the sea breaks upon them, and no reasonable expenditure of time and means would suffice to make the hydrographer sure that he had found, even by sweeping with deep-sea lines, all such dangers to navigation. A remarkably low tide, with a heavy swell, often reveals these hidden dangers in places where they have been unsuspected, and after a channel has been used by thousands of vessels, day after day and year after year, a point of rock is found by bringing up some unlucky craft. The hydrographer does his best with the sounding-line, obtains all the information he can from pilots and fishermen, and then often must incur the blame, but ill-deserved, of having omitted some pinnacle of rock from his chart. The discovery of so characteristic a mark as the reddish sand within the bar at San Francisco entrance, cannot fail to be of great importance to navigators. It appears to have been carefully ascertained that it was not owing to some special condition of the rivers that this sand was found, but that it is always there, marking the inner limit of the bar of the Golden Gate. The officer who made this discovery will verify the facts relating to it from time to time. The development of the channel between Yerba Buena and the Contra Costa was a necessary result of the surveys, but not the less useful on that account. The importance now attaching to San Francisco rendered it essential that soundings should be multiplied where a noble city had taken the place of a ranch for the sale of hides, the sole occupant of this sple;ndid bay when even recent charts were made. The tidal observations on the western coast have furnished materials for a chart showing the places where it is high water at the same instant, or chart of co-tidal lines. An approximate chart has been constructed by me from the discussions of these observations made for me under special instructions, by the tidal division. 'rhis chart, and a memoir accompa~ying it, explanatory of the considerations upon which it was made, was presented, by authority of the Treasury Department, to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at their recent meeting in Providence, and will be found in Appendix No. 50. The conclusion which I draw from this series of lines is the same as that already deduced from those on the Atlantic coast, namely, that the tides thus observed are essentially littoral, or shore-tides, in their character, and give but little information as to the general progress of the great ocean tide-wave. I could not properly include, in the table of developments, one of the most useful results of the Coast Survey-the marking of the Florida reef by signals at intervals along it. This has been done by an officer of the survey, under the general instructions of the Light-house Board, and with means furnished by the special appropriation recommended by them for the purpose. The Coast Survey signals along the reef were necessarily of perishable materials. They served, however, to mark the spots where permanent beacons should be placed, and it was only necessary to substitute iron for wood in the construction to furnish the most valuable aids to the day navigation of the Florida channel which have yet been devised. Fourteen signals or beacons have been thus placed, by request of the Light-house Board, on projecting and dangerous points of the Florida reef. These are so distinguished from each other, by colors and letter-vanes, that the navigator on making one of them can hardly fail to know his position. Plain descriptions are given of each beacon (Appendix No. 16) by the officer

who placed them, and such details in regard to them, and remarks, as to make them of the highest value for the day navigation of the reef. In fact, by picking them up in succession and keeping them at a safe distance, the master of a vessel may run along the reef with entire confidence. The Gulf Stream soundings off Key Biscayne have been examined by Professor Bailey, of West Point, with very interesting results. He states that these soundings, which are from depths varying from one hundred and forty-seven to two hundred and five fathoms, agree in their general characters as well as their organic contents ; they arc light greenish-grey mud, composed chiefly of organisms, which he names, in a profusion hitherto unrivalled in any known deposite of the present ocean, and only surpassed in fossil state by certain strata of the island of Barbadoes. The interesting remarks of Professor Bailey are given entire in Appendix No. 55. The following notices to mariners have been communicated to the Treasury Department: The development of a shoal one mile and a half south of Nantucket light-boat. (.Appendix No. 11) The existence of a knoll in the main ship channel, entrance t.o New York harbor. (Appendix No. 12.) The existence of a shoal spot, with but nine feet water, near the end of York spit, Chesapeake bay. (Appendix No. 13.) Determination of the position of a dangerous rock (lat. 32░ 29' N., long. 119░ 04~' W., approximate) on Cortez bank, off the southern boundary of California. (Appendix No. 18.) The location of a rock upon which the steamer "Uncle Sam" struck, south of Point San Pedro, Oalifornia. (Appendix No. 19.) The existence of a deposite of reddish sand inside, and extending from, the bar at the entrance of San Francisco bay, as far up as the "Heads." (Appendix No. 20.) The beginning is made this year of a compilation, from Coast Survey data, of sailing directions, lists of dangers, latitudes e.nd longitudes, magnetic variations, light-houses, tides and currents, and other hydrographic information, for the coast and ports of the United States which have been surveyed or examined in the progress of the coast survey. This will be added to from year to year as the work advances. The arrangement of the article is described in the preface to it. In every case reference is made to the map, chart, or report, in which the information is found. This list includes nautical information in regard to numerous localities from Maine to Texas, both inclusive, and from southern California to Washington Territory.* The list of localities surveyed on the western coast (Appendix No. 6) contains sixty-eight, of which the geographical positions have been determined and preliminary surveys ha>re been made. Of these fifteen are bays, sounds, inlets, or straits, of ten of which preliminary surveys have been made, either in the whole or part; of four the topography of the shor<Js only has been executed, and of one the geographical position determined; of ten of these bays, &c., sketches have been published. Nineteen of the localities are harbors or ports, of which preliminary surveys have been made of fourteen, topographical surveys of the rest, and sketches or preliminary charts of all but one published. Twenty-four of the localities are capes, points, headlands, or islands, chiefly surveyed for light-house purposes, of nineteen of which sketches have been published. The remainder include entrances to rivers or to harbors, anchorages, reefs, banks, and the city of .San Francisco. The present list presents twenty localities not on the former, representing nearly the progress during the pa.st year, and for the time previous, the results of which had not reached the office at the date of my last report. It will be seen that all these surveys, which are deemed of interest, are engraved and published as soon as practicable after their receipt, and that we are up to the last season's fieldwork with the sketches for this report.
0 It was intended to append these sailing directions, &c., to this report, but they a.re too voluminoua for the purpose, a.nd must be published sepa.ra.tely. Appendix No. 30 gives a. list of them.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Among the matters relating to the western coast contained in my report of this year, is a. memoir (Appendix No. 26) descriptive of the coast generally, by Assistant George Davidson. This is valuable, as embodying the experience of an intelligent observer who has gone frequently along the coast, between its two boundaries of Frnzer's river and San Diego, in various ways, has visited its principal ports, islands, capes, and headlands, and has navigated many of its waters. It is the beginning of what must grow up into one of the most useful documents resulting from the survey. By a coincidence which is one of its best recommendations, the necessity for such a paper is strongly insisted upon by the intelligent and learned traveller, whose contribution to our work I proceed next to refer to. The memoir will be found in the Appendix No. 64. Few of the practical details relating to the Coast Survey have given more trouble than the ascertaining of the proper names of localities and their orthography. Even upon the Atlantic coast, and where the settlements have been made by those speaking the English language, the case is difficult; and where, as upon parts of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, and upon the western coast, the settlements have been ade by the French, Spanish, and other nations, or where the names given by the aborigines of the country, or by the first discoverers, are intended to be preserved, the difficulty is greatly increased. Our population is so changeable, that names are very readily lost, changed, or corrupted. The land parties consult the residents of places on shore; the hydrographic parties the pilots, fishermen, and sea-faring men. Two sets of names are frequently presented, neither of which may be correct. When about to publish the Б.rst Coast Survey map of New York bay and harbor, by the advice of the Hon. John C. Spencer, then Secretary of the 'l'reasury, I sent the sheets to the members of Congress from the several districts, asking that they would furnish the names of residents in the districts who might most advantageously be consulted in regard to the proper designation and orthography of the localities embraced within their districts severally. In some cases the names of several residents of the same district were furnished, and the information differed so considerably as to increase rather than remove the doubts resting upon the subject. The information: when classified, led to important suggestions as to a better plan of proceeding. It was plain that if, in such a region as the vicinity of New York, there was difficulty in establishing the names of places and their orthography, there must be much greater difficulty elsewhere. By the ad vice of the Hon. George P. Marsh and the Hon. Edward Everett, I consulted, for the orthography of names in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, the Hon. H. C. Murphy, a ripe scholar, who had made these subjects his especial study. His reports have embodied a fund of information on this subject for our archives, and have afforded a basis, in some cases, for restoring aboriginal names or rescuing them from corruptions; in others, for establishing orthographies beyond a doubt; and in others, have shown that doubts must always rest upon the received orthographies. This system has been followed up as the finished charts of other portions of the coast have been furnished. On the western coast the case was one of extreme difficulty. Different names had been given by successive discoverers or explorers to the same points, and the same indentations, the same bays and sounds. These had frequently replaced aboriginal names which were preserved by the inhabitants, or names given by the early explorers on land, or by the missionaries, which had been retained in their pure or in a corrupted form. The mistakes and various titles and orthographies were exceedingly perplexing, and in some instanees names were altered more than once, modes of spelling were changed and restored, and the whole subject seemed one of perplexing uncertainty. It was of the first importance, then, to trace the history of discovery on that coast; to ascertain the original names and the successive ones; to restore those which were corrupted, and to fix those uncorrupted beyond the power of change ; to go back to the earlier names, when the later had not become so permanently attached to the localities as to make it too difficult; and, in short, to make the Coast Survey maps and charts the standard for names and their spelling, as for the geography of the country. To efect this I availed myself

OF THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

11

of the visit to our country of a distinguished ethnographer, Doctor J. G. Kohl, who had made the most admirable collection of maps of discovery on the "\Vestern continent, compiled from va1иious sources, and presenting the subject in the most systematic manner, with a series of his own, showing, by striking and original methods, the results of successive voyages, travels, and expeditions by sea and land. From him I have received a report of the most interesting character, which will be published in connexion with the archives of the survey, and of which an abstract showing the nature of its contents is appended to the present report. (.Appendix No. 64.) The points to which I called the attention of Dr. Kohl are thus briefly snllliilled up in a memorandum which I handed to him for his guidance: "To trace the succession of discoveries and explorations from Cortez to those of Wilkes and De Mofras, giving their dates and localities. 'l'he localities to include the immediate coast and the interior to the coast range of mountains, inclusive. The explorations to be those by sea and by land. To give the maps resulting from these explorations, or notes of where access may be had, if they have been published, and copies of manuscript maps, when they exist only as such. To give the titles of books, maps, and charts relating to these discoveries, and information where they may be found. To give a general notice of each exploration or voyage, with reference to maps, and a general historical map on tl1c plan of Dr. Kohl. To give the best authorities for the names of localities, showing how the names have been given, and thus to establish their orthography as a basis for the geography and hydrography of the western coast of the United States. To furnish a catalogue of the names of headlands, capes, sounds, bays, and harbors, with the authorities." The impossibility of compressing this work into a small compass forbids its publication as an appendix to this report ; though great pains have been taken by Dr. Kohl to reduce it to the smallest possible limit. In consequence of this limitation, and of the nature of the work itself, he has found it desirable to explain exactly how far this work may be considered merely a fragment. (Appendix No. 64.) The report of Doctor Kohl includes" 1. .A complete historical account of the progress of discovery, as connected with the hydrography of the western coast from Coronados island to Cape Scott, the northern point of Vancouver' s island. "2 . .A map to illustrate the historical account, showing in colors the range and limits appertaining to each discoverer and explorer. "3 . .A collection of maps, reduced copies of originals or duplicates of ancient and modern maps, in further illustration of the history. "4 . .A list of names of bays, capes, harbors, &c., on the western coast, with critical and historical remarks, settling the orthography of the names. "5. A catalogue of books, maps, manuecripts, &c., relative to discoveries on the western coast." The map illustrative of the memoir just noticed, exhibits in colors the extent of coast included in the discoveries of each navigator and traveller, with names, dates, &c . .A. brief description which accompanies it explains the plan adopted in its preparation. The collection of historical maps shows t.he tracks and routes pursued by successive explorers, and many of them are copies from manuscripts or from rare printed maps. The list of geographical names includes the history of nearly three hundred localities, capes, inlets, harbors, &c., on the western coast, with a separate discussion of the name of each and the authorities relating to it. A geographica.l description of the coast suggested by Dr. Kohl will be prepared, his views falling in exactly with those which I had commenced to execute for the .Atlantic and Gulf coasta.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

In fact, the report of William P. Blake, Esq., (Appendix No. 65 ,) opens with a general description of th"! sort for a part of the coast of California. The bearing of such a description, drawn from the Coast Survey maps and other authentic sources, upon the historical questions relating to names of localities, is thus stated by Doctor Kohl: "In many caseR, while engaged on the work just completed, I was enabled to decide in regard to certain historical doubts only by following your reports in connexion with letters and views, and the descriptions given by officers engaged in the work under your superintendence. To give but one instance from many which occurred-I could make out that the old ' Cabo Galera' of the Spaniards was our Point Ooncepti'on, only by comparing the old descriptions of it with the Coast Survey views and delineations of that cape." The first portion of the memoir by Mr. Blake (Appendix No. 65) is devoted to a general description of the ranges of mountains bordering the California coast. They are shown to consist of a series of parallt>J ranges, enclosing longitudinal valleys. The general trend of all these ranges is also considered with !lpecial reference to the determination of the hydrography of the neighboring coast. The existence of sub-marine mountain ranges parallel with the coast is declared from the indications presented by the features of the land, and by the groups of islands disposed in straight lines. Mr. Blake considers that there are two or more parallel ranges of this kind south of Point Conception, and their probable position and trend is noted. He also considers it highly probable that submerged ranges will be found parallel with the coast north of Point Conception, and 1mggests that a series of soundings be made on lines perpendicular to the general trend of the coast muuntains, and also in the direction of the trend of the islands. The second division of the memoir includes a brief general description of the important geological features of the principal ports and bays from Bodega to San Diego. The nature of the rocks at the several magnetic stations between these points iR given, and the descriptions are accompanied and illustrated by small maps and sections. Lieut. Comg. Alden, chief of the hydrographic party on the Pacific coast, in the steamer Active, has, on various occasions, rendered service to vessels in distress, which I have heartily approved. This year, on her voyage to Washington Territory, he fell in at Crescent City with a body of recruits of the United States army, who had been cast ashore by the burning of their transport, and were in distress, and immediately took the officers and men on board and transported them to Fort Steilacoom, to which they were bound. (See Appendix :Xo. 69.) By a curious coincidence, this timely relief by a Coast Survey vessel was afforded to a detachment under the command of Brevet Major Henry Prince, who had just been relieved from the coast survey, and whose services in the work I have had occasion to acknowledge in the warmest terms. Every two years the list of geographical positions determined during that period, in the survey, is published in the appendix to my report. The last publication brought .the list up to 1853, and it is now completed to 1855 by giving the results for the past two years. (Appendix No. 8.) A full discussion has been made of the observations of magnetic declination or variation hitherto collected in the coast survey by Assistant Hilgard, Mr. Schott, and myself, and has resulted in the chart given with this report. The mode of discussing the observations to arrive at this chart is rather too technical for statement here, but will be found in the Appendix No. 47. The observations were all reduced to one epoch by the results of Mr. Schott's investigations. (Appendix No. 48.) Some observations were intrmluced from other sources than the Coast Survey, and due credit will be given in the complete publication for them. The observations on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and on the Atlantic were separately discussed, and when brought together required but little shifting of the lines to produce agreement. Six groups were formed of the Gulf results, and they were discussed in conditional equations, involving second differences. The stations on the Atlantic were referred to a greti.t circle, passing through a point near Portland and Cedar keys; thirty-one groups were formed, and a complete

equation of the second degr!)e applied to them. The thirty-one conditional equations, involving six unknown quantities, were discussed by least squares. By a small change in the coefficient of the square of the abscissa, these two sets were brought quite near together, giving a continuous representation as shown on the chart. The memoir, or report, of Charles A. Schott, Esq., chief of the computing division of the Coast Survey office, (Appendix No. 48,) is one of great importance, not only to the survey directly, but to all who use the compass, whether navigators, land surveyors, or engineers. The investigation will enable them to reduce observations of the magnetic variation from one date to their equivalents at another, whether before or after the date of observation. It is based on one hundred and eighty observations at stations distributed over the coast of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. The heads of the report will give the best general idea of it. The first contains the discussion of the secular change of the variation at stations presenting reliable observations, prior to about the year 1740; the second, subsequent to that time; the third, results from comparatively recent observations; the fourth, the investigation of formulro which repreRent the secular changes of the variation at the several localities, with a general synopsis of results and remarks. The discussions are very ingenious and thorough, are conducted by the methods of the modern mathematics, and will well repay a careful examination. The principal results are represented in curves (Plate No. 51,) and the comparisons are made graphically between the numbers given by the formulro and by the observations. An interesting fact connected with these discussions is, that a series of observations made with great labor, and apparently with great care, by E.W. Bean, Esq., of Hatboro', Pennsylvania, and kindly communicated to me, proved so discordant with the results which Professor Hansteen had reached, that we felt compelled to reject them, and I was obliged so to inform this indefatigable observer. His reply was a very characteristic one, expres:>ing his conviction of the accuracy of the observations. It has proved not only that these results are in harmony with the law deduced from other authentic observations, but that they afford us one of the best sets of data yet obtained in our country for the discussion of the secular change. An additional list of magnetic variations determined during the past season will be found in Appendix No. 49. The tidal observations have been continued during the year on both the eastern and western coasts. The details in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, under my more immediate direction, have been in charge of Assistant L. F. Pourtales, and those on the western coast have been continued with Lieutenant W. P. Trowbridge, of the Corps of Engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey. Those on the Gulf of Mexico have been, as far as the general phenomena are concerned, brought to a close, requiring the occupation of one or two permanent stations to keep up the series, and of some temporary ones a.t points to be hereafter determined from the discussion of the observations now collected. Of the temporary stations on the Atlantic the same remark may be made. The tidal observations on the western coast have made good progress by Lieut. Trowbridge's exertions, the permanent stations being well kept up, and the temporary ones having been extended north into a difficult portion of the survey and to difficult points on the coast. In my report of last year, I gave (Appendix No. 51) tide-tables for some of the principal points of the United States, derived from the observations and reductions in the Coast Survey. I have substituted for these, in the present report, (Appendix No. 53,) an article of a more popular cast, prepared from the Coast Survey data, and communicated by authority of the Treasury Department to Messrs. E. & G. W. Blunt. I consider that the services of these gentlemen, in reference to the hydrography of our coast and to navigation generally, entitle them to the highest consideration from any one engaged in similar pursuits, and therefore most cheerfully afford the time necessary to recast scientific matters into a popular form for them. I feel it a compliment to be asked to assist men of their order of usefulness. They sow their seed broadcast, and

access is had to soils which otherwise it might never reach, if confined to official reports and scientific memoirs. Nor is this done in any spirit of exclusiveness; for to others, with the same object, I would gladly afford the same aid, if they considered it desirable to have it. It has been said by one of the highest scientific authorities in matters relating to the applications of mathematics to physical astronomy, that until he prepared a popular treatise on perturbations, in which, casting aside all formulro, he labored to bring the result within the mind's grasp, logically arranged in words, the subject had not the same clearness in the mind which' it assumed under the process necessary to popularize it. In our American association we have seen one of the greatest mathematicians of the day explaining the most abstruse problems of this same physical astronomy by a logical analysis of the most convincing sort, and treating the formulm, in which he afterwards clothed the analysis, as a dress which any one could put on at will. These high authorities sustain me in saying that efforts thus to popularize the Coast Survey results are not lost, even to the highest scientific discussions of them, and that clearness of conception of the phenomena results from attempts thus to set them in order for a ready understanding of them. Before giving a short account of these tide-tables, I must be permitted a word as to the mode of preparation of them, and similar articles denning my own connexion and that of others with them. I am not willing to take from others, because having officially certain power to do so, and because usage has in some cases sanctioned it from time immemorial, results of their labors, nor am I willing to give up my just right over my own studies. In organizing the tidal division, I of course availed myself of the labors of the officers who had been engaged in the subject from the first beginnings, and especially I studied what was written in regard to it. The processes then established under my direction were the best that I could find, or thought them so. These have been in part continued, in part modified, by myself and by others, and in part changed. :Mr. W. W. Gordon, Sub-Assistant Henry Mitchell, and Assistant L. F. Pourtales, have in turn been very useful in this respect. The routine of the tida.l division is now established in a great degree, and kept steadily onward, by the care of Assistant Pourtales, in charge of it, and the industry and skill of the computers under him. In the course of this routine results are furnished for the maps and charts of the survey according to prescribed forms, which have originated in precisely the same way with the routine of computations. When a special subject comes up for discussion, I collect from the tidal division all the data bearing upon it, and for furnishing these the chief of the division and computers are entitled to credit. If, upon study, more information is necessary, I call for it, prescribing generally its form. The ideas which occur to me as to modes of working, I communicate; the hypotheses which arise in the course of the investigation I cause to be tested. In all this the computer who acts deserves merely the credit of accuracy of computation, which I do not claim. If he finds opportunity for improving my processes, I give him credit for this; and so if he points out some relation which I had not observed, but he in no sense prepares my paper, he is entitled to more credit than the copyist who writes it out, but it is of the same order. In preparing, for example, my paper on the co-tidal lines of the Atlantic C-Oast, I called for the data of the establishments, put them roughly in order, had them arranged properly, the co-tidal hours deduced by referring to Mr. Whewell's paper as a guide, and the establishments carried out to deep water by referring to the charts and to Mr. Airy's tables. The results being returned to me, I grouped them by Lloyd's method ; and finding that various groups should be tried, directed this. These results were examined and returned, over and over again, for new discussions in the division. In this I, of course, computed many of the tables roughly, so as to see whether the hypothesis were likely to yield fruit, and sometimes more and sometimes less thoroughly, according to the time at my disposal from pressing a.vocations. The subject at last began to assume a definite shape; I drew up the text, leaving such numbers as required examination blank, to be filled in the tidal division, and the tablea to be filled in from reYisQd computations; the chart roughly drawn to

be done carefully. In all thia I give great credit to Mr. Pourtales as assisting me, and in my paper have given the names of the computers by whom the results were reduced. This is the credit to which Mr. Pourtales and Messrs. Heaton, Mitchell, and Hawley are entitled, and I would be the last one to deprive them of a particle of it. So in the case of the tide-tables which are under consideration ; the data came from the office, and were often returned for re-arrangement and revision. The routine tables were presented by the division. The roughly prepared tables, original with me, were returned to them to be completed. The examples roughly worked out were sent to them for revision, and in many cases others were substituted for them which I had at first fixed upon. In all this, credit is due to Mr. Pourtales for entire and thorough cooperation with me, and to the computers generally for their faithful work. The article, however, is mine. I am alone responsible 'for its faults and imperfections. If it renders service to navigators, I shall be happy in sharing the pleasure ,from this source with those who have contributed to enable me to receive it. '.rhese tide-tables (Appendix No. 53) give only approximate results, but such as may safely be used in a general way, before more complete prediction tables can be furnished, or when these are not at hand. The first part of the paper gives the mode of determining roughly the time and height of high water at the ports of the United States named, by referring to the Nautical Almanac for the time of moon's transit, and to the tables for the other quantities. Examples show how to apply the rule. The second part gives the means of a nearer approximation to the time and height of high and low water, by taking into consideration some changes which are not allowed for in the first part. Tables are again given which are less compact than those in the first part, but are, however, quite simple, and require the use only of the Nautical Almanac in conjunction with them to give the second approximation sought. Rules are again given, and examples follow the rules. Next, the attempt is made to give an idea of how to work tides having a large daily inequality, as those on the Pacific and in certain parts of the Gulf of Mexico, where the morning and afternoon tides differ greatly in height and time. Tables are again given, in which, by the use of the Nautical Almanac in determining the moon's declination, the time and height of these apparently irregular tides can be predicted within moderate limits. The rules and tables are not so simple as those of the second part, but I trust will be found not diffieult to use. Some brief notes are added on the tides of the Gulf of Mexico, which are, however, confined to the limited object of showing the height at the different ports. Last year I directed a series of observations on the interference tides of Nantucket and the Vineyard sounds, and gave my personal attention to the observations until in operation, when I left them under the charge of Sub-Assistant Henry Mitchell, who carried out my design with signal ability. This year we have taken up the results where the compututions of the last year's work showed we had arrived, and have sought, by additional observations, to unravel some of the still tangled skein of these tides. The objects attained last year, and sought this, are stated in a general way in Appendix No. 33. I must not here omit to state that the powerful analysis of Professor Peirce has been directed to this subject in consequence of the interest which he found in some of the results of last year, and that I have great hope of assistance in reducing this complex system to order, from his mature study of the problem which it presents. I have already noticed under the head of developments the description and chart of the co-tidal lines of the west.em coast, (Appendix No. 50 and Sketch No. 49,) which have been added to our results of this year. In connexion with the subjects relating to the western coast tides, I may here refer to Appendix No. 51, as containing the results of observations upon earthquake waves, recorded upon the self-registering tide-gauges at San Francisco and San Diego 1 on the 23d of December, 1854. The connexion of the observations at the two ports with each other is carefully traced out, and both are referred to the earthquake waves of the date mentioned which caused such extraordinary disasters in Jape.n, and especially in the harbor and city of Simode.. The cha.ra.ct.er of these

waves being ascertained, and the time of their transmission, the average depth of the ocean in their path becomes known. A valuable paper by Cliar1es A. Schott, Esq., chief of the computing division, on the solution of normal equations by indirect elimination, is given in Appendix No. 40. It is too technical in its character to be understood by such a notice as is appropriate in this place, and I therefore merely refer to it by its title, that those whom its details will interest may refer immediately to it. The point to which, in the several chronometric expeditions of the Coast Survey, we had brought the determinations of longitude between Cambridge and Liverpool, was stated in my last report. The outstanding differences of results pointing to temperature as their source, a nrw expedition has been undertaken and just brought to a close, in which the greatest care has been taken to secure as equal a temperature as possible. The temperatures of the chronometers while at sea and ashore have been ascertained, and the several chronometers had been specially examined before the expedition commenced, for the effect of temperature. We have also taken pains to eliminate personal equation, as far as it can be done by using the same observers, both at Cambridge and Liverpool. As heretofore, the distinguished director of the Harvard Observatory, William C. Ilond, Esq., has had immediate charge of this expedition, and the full and creditable co-operation of Mr. Hartnup, the director of the Liverpool Observatory, has been given. The computation of the results of this expedition has already been commenced by George P. Bond, Esq., of the Harvard Observatory. (.Appendix No. 43.) Director W. C. Bond has continued to furnish us the observations of moon culminations, and has added to them observations on the lunar spots. Interesting remarks upon this subject are contained in his report. (.Appendix No. 43.) The volume containing the results of the Coast Survey chronometer expeditions of 1849, 1850, and 1851 has been prepared by George P. Bond, Esq., and is now reported as ready for the press. The telegraph operations for longitude have been extended during the past year as far as Macon, Georgia, and arrangements have been made for continuing the work to Montgomery and Mobile, and thus reaching New Orleans as speedily as is consistent with due care and precision in the operation. .A full report of the work is given under the head of Section V, where the stations of last year were established, and in the Appendix No. 46. The entire report is printed of the accomplished astronomer who directed the observations. A catalogue of the places of circumpolar stars, and of zenith stars, derived from the best authorities and brought up to January, 1855, is given with this report, and is printed, as being useful for reference by our parties and by astronomers generally. The programme of the longitude operations, together with the modes of reduction of the observations, give an excellent idea of the method of applying the telegraph to this purpose. The report contains, also, memoranda in regard to the instruments employed. The suggestion with which it closes, of a series of observations between 'Wilmington and Columbia, upon the new line just put up, is in the course of execution. This will connect Wilmington and Columbia directly, each of these stations having already been connected with Washington by an intermediate station. Thus a most important verification will be obtained. :Mr. ::Mathiot has presented to me a paper which, as bearing upon our interpretation of the experiments on wave time in transmitting galvanic signals, for telegraphic differences of longitude, appropriately finds a place in the appendix to my report, (No. 61.) It is the description of an experiment designed to show that a sensible interval of time is required to raise a galvanic current to its maximum, under certain fixed circumstances, or that before the action of a battery can affect a conductor, a sensible period of time is required to generate the electricity necessary to produce the maximum intensity of current due to the battery with this conductor. Having arrived at conclusions fatal to the accuracy of the present mode of observing and computing moon culminations for longitude, Professor Peirce has been engaged in investigations

intended to rescue this branch of astronomy from the position in which he finds it. A proposi.tion for determining minutely the figure of the moon' R disk is one of the points of these investigations. This, as will be seen in his able memoir, (Appendix No. 42,) depends upon the use to be made of occultations of the Pleiadu3. The subject of occultations, which were favorite и themes with Bessel and Walker, Professor Peirce proposes to take up again and to a})ply tl1oroughly by means of a new minute triangulation of the Pleiades. This work is imperiously demanded of the Coast Survey. The project has found favor with the men of science of our country, wl10 thoroughly understand its bearings, and the results to be expected from it. It requires, however, the use of very expensive instruments, quite beyond the means of the Coast Survey to procure. From this dilemma we have been relieved by the liberality of citizens of New York State-of the city of Albany-who have offered us the use of instruments exactly adapted to this purpose, which they have undertaken to supply, under the direction of the authorities of the survey; the sole condition being that they shall be worthy of the work, of the state of science of the day, and exceed in magnitude and value any heretofore provided for a similar purpose. I cannot refrain from mentioning Mrs. Blandina Dudley as the liberal and enlightened donor of a heliometer, which is to be used at Albany for the execution of this work. Other necessary instruments will be provided by the public-spirited citizens of Albany, who have charged Dr. B. A. Gould, jr.-whose astronomical labors are already so well known to the country-to procure the first-class instruments needed for these investigations. Professor Peirce's lucid report on the method of determining longitude by the occultation of the Pleiades will be found in Appendix No. 42. Dr. Peters has urged upon me the use of transits of some of the best defined of the lunar spots, instead of the moon's limb, for longitude purposes, and has made some interesting comparisons at the Cloverden station with the Harvard Observatory, the differences of longitude of the two stations being known from geodetic observations. The accuracy of our latitude determinations depending, of course, on those of the declinations of the stars employed in them, it is of great importance to us to ascertain the value to be attached to different catalogues embracing the stars used in our observations. This subject has occupied the attention of different officers of the survey; and recently Mr. Charles A. Schott, in charge of the computing division, has made.a useful comparison of the Greenwich Twelve Year Catalogue-deservedly a favorite from its accuracy-and of Rumker's Hamburg Catalogue, including right ascensions as well as declinations, (Appendix No. 45.) This catalogue stands the test of the comparison better than that of the British Association. On the average, the north polar distances are three-tenths of a second less than those of the Twelve Year Catalogue ; the average difference, without regard to sign, is one second and two-tenths, and the greatest difference eight seconds and three-tenths. The number of observations for determining a star's place is less in the Hamburg Catalogue than in the Greenwich, in the proportion of two to three, the average number being nine in the former. With a view to secure steady progress in the publication of the records and results of the survey for which appropriation has been made 'by Congress, I have relieved Assistant J. E. Hilgard from the charge of the computing division of the office, and have assigned to him, in conjunction with the a.ssista.nt in charge of the office where the work touches upon the office ground, under my immediate direction, and with instructions in regard to the general plan of the publication, the arrangement of the details of its execution, of the forms for the different varieties of work which it embraces, of the descriptions which it requires, of the copyings from the s.rehives, th~ printing, and the like. Many of these details have been already matured, and are hi the course of execution. The astronomical observations with Airy's zenith sector, with the zenith telescope at certain stations, and portions of the geodetic work, are preparing for the printer. A volume containing the Gulf Stream results bas made considerable progress, the whole of 3

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

the diagrams having been revised by Professor Pendleton and prepared for engraving under my immediate direction, anrl some portions of tlie text being ready. The magnetic observations have undergone a thorough examination by Assistant Hilgard and myself, preparatory to collecting them in a volume of records and results. Mr. Schott has also been engaged in labors bearing on this same subject. The sailing directions and other items of nautical information collected in the course of the survey are preparing for these volumes. In connexion with this, a general coast description, to follow the coast as surveyed, is in progress. In addition to the volumes thus preparing for t11e press, from what may be called the regular work of the survey, a volume of results of the chronometer expeditions has been prepared by George P. Bond, Esq. ; an elaborate report of investigations on the Florida reefs has been nearly completed by Professor Agassiz, and the requisite plates have been nearly :finished, in a style which will do credit to the state of the art of lithography in our country; a valuable memoir by J. G. Kohl, Esq., on the history of maritime discovery on the western coast, has been prepared. The publications from the archives, while they insure that no part of the work shall be lost by accident, and that all of it shall be made useful as rapidly as executed, gives the very great further advantage that its revision may be made while those who did the work in the :field are still connected with the survey. It will avoid the drawing out to a great length of publications after the work has closed-a thing which has been the reproach of many surveys. It will prevent the necessity for expensive arrangements for the care and preservation of the archives, accumulating from year to year in an increasing ratio. These are but a few of the advantages which will flow directly or indirectly from these publications. It is obvious to the least reflection that the first step in such a work is the most difficult, and that when we have once commenced to publish, the volumes will follow each other in succession as rapidly as the means appropriated will allow, when the work of preparation and printing has become one of routine, or in a great degree mechanical. The publication of the special reports referred to, which contain investigations that advance the science of the day, instead of sealing them up in the archives and using merely the results, will be hailed with satisfaction by the men of science of the country. The volumes relating to our harbors and coast, and embodying the varied information collected in the progress of the survey, will have nearly the same interest for commercial men and navigators. It has become already apparent from "the great number of ways in which the coast survey results are worked up in the publications of the day, in maps, gazetteers, manuals, and the like, that such publications are much sought for as of general public interest. Considerable progress has been made by Lieutenant E. B. Hunt, of the corps of engineers, in the preparation of a descriptive index of papers relating to astronomy, geodesy, topography, hydrography, drawing, engraving 1 printing, electrotyping, and the like, including in fact all subjects of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and their applications to science and the arts, which are used in the various branches or departments of the survey. Such an index will constitute for this special work what the celebrated index of Doctor Young did for natural philosophy generally, up to the date of its execution. Such an index of reference to works accessible to the officers of the survey, and to those interested in similar pursuits, will be of the greatest value in directing research and in preventing loss of time and study in reproducing that which has already been done. This index would have been prepared for the present year's report, but the pressure of engineering and light-house duties assigned to Lieutenant Hunt, under an arrangement between the Engineer department and the Coast Survey, has been more severely felt than was expected, and this work could not be completed, without too much haste, in time to be incorporated in the appendix of this. report. The ten years' general index of the Coast Survey reports, prepared last year by Lieutenant Hunt, has already proved of the greatest convenience to the officers oi the work. In many

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

19

cases known to me it has saved a great deal of time in referring to special matt(иrs embraced in those reports. The officers of the survey contribute, from time to time, ingenious practicttl lh'>иices in the way of their work, descriptions of which are published with my report. During the past year reports upon the following have been received, (Appendix, Nos. 41, 56, to 60 and 63): l. Description of an apparatus for measuring preliminary bases, by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, (Appendix No. 41, Sketch 53); 2, of a tripod and scaffold for primary stations, (Appendix No. 57); 3, of a signal for secondary triangulation, by Assistant John Farley, (Appendix No. 58, Sketch 52); 4, of a signal for hydrographic purposes, by Lieut. Comg. B. F. Sands, U. S. N., assistant, (Appendix No. 60, Sketch 54) ; 5, of an instrument for obtaining specimens of the bottom of the sea, by the same officer, (Appendix No. 56, Sketch 55) ; 6, of a branch circuit galvanometer for measuring galvanic currents of great quantity, by George Mathiot, Esq., (Appendix No. 63.) The devices for measuring preliminary bases are not only of value in themselves, but suggestive by their combinations ; and in working, various modes occur as suitable in different cases, or to different persons. The secondary signal, though simple, is exceedingly useful; for in small triangulations, unless the signals are very straight, small, well centred, and truly vertical, the work cannot close, and faults are sometimes attributed to instruments and atmospheric circumstances, when the character and placing of the signals should bear the blame. Lieut. Oomg. Sands' ingenious tripod and signal admits of many applications ; the revolving signal itself, made of met:il, may in many positions replace a heliotrope. He has devised also a revolving heliotrope, which is admirably adapted to geodetic purposes. One of the instruments now referred to was used during the present season by my party, in Section I, at a subsidiary station, and answered all the purposes for which it was intended. A description of this form of heliotrope is given in Appendix No. 59, and the form of the instrument is presented in Sketch No. 54. The instrument for obtaining specimens of the bottom is on a plan lluite different from any we have hitherto tried in the survey. 1\1r. l\1athiot' s branch circuit galvan'1meter has been in use for some time in his department, with important practical results in electrotyping. In my last report I mentioned a portable transit by 'Villiam Wiirdemann, Esq., which had given excellent results, and this year have had a similar one under trial in my party, with entire satisfaction to the observers. We have also used a new zenith telescope by 1\Ir. \Viirdemann, which for admirable workmanship surpasses any instrument I have before seen, from his establishment. The design, too, is excellent, and well deserves the praise bestowed by Assistant Dean, in his description, Appendix No. 44. Where great portability is not desired, this instrument leaves almost nothing to be desired. Each field-party of the Coast Survey, as a general rule, works up its own observations, the topographical parties return their sheets in a finished form, and the hydrographers reduce their soundings and plot them upon charts. The office-work executed by each party is reported to the Superintendent, and, with special exceptions only, turned into the office at 'Washington, before resuming operations, in the field or afloat. Duplicate computations and verifications are made in the office, and the comparison is required to be reported to the Superintendent. In the office the work is combined so as to furnish maps, charts and sketches, and these are drawn, engraved and published. The labors of the office thus increase with the increase of the fieldwork, and its organization must develope .with that of the rest of the work. The present arrangements are due in a great degree to Captain H urnphreys, Major Stevens, and Captain Benham, who have been successively in charge of the office, and to myself, and any one who has watched the progress of change will see that it has been gradual, and has combined the experience of many minds desirous of progress and not fearful of change. The labors of Captain Humphreys, who was the first assistant in charge under my superintendency, and under whom the survey assumed the general form which it has now, have indelibly impressed themselves, as

20

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

I see and know, upon the office arrangements ; and, after mature consideration and the experience of the present, I have not a word to withdraw of the commendation which I have bestowed in former years upon his abilities, zeal, industry, and success. In reiterating this, I give the best possible pledge to his successors that their just claims will neither be overlooked nor forgotten when they in turn shall have sought other fields of usefulness. Administration has in many cases taken the place of personal execution of details ; but this is admitted as a consequence of the expansion of the work, or, in other words, a necessity. The organization of the office ii.ow presents the following divisions, each under a chief immediately responsible to the assistant in charge of the office, and to whom, in turn, the employes in his division are responsible: 1, the computing division ; 2, the tidal division ; 3, thP- drawing division ; 4, the engraving division; 5, the electrotyping division; 6, the printing and publishing; 7, the distribution and sale; 8, the instrument-making and carpentry; and 9, the archives and library. и The instruments are under the immediate charge of the general disbursing agent; the clerks generally, messengers and laborers, are under the immediate supervision of the clerk of the assistant in charge of the office. The assistant in charge had formerly a general assistant, whose duties were of importance, and the necessity for replacing whom has been fully recognised, but so far without result. Attention is again called to the filling of this important position, by the assistant in charge of the office, in whose remarks I fully concur. Officers of the army are liable to be frequently changed. Being in charge of most of the divisions, it has been rendered especially necessary that a permanent aid or clerk should be allowed to each, to avoid the loss of the office experience. This arrangement secures the progress which new mind applied to the details of the division generally brings, and at the same time steady and matured action. A hydrographic officer is also attached to the office, whose duties in the revision of work and in advising in regard to details of office hydrography are of the first importance. The lists presented by the several divisions of the office, (Appendix No. 36,) and the notices of their labors in a subsequent part of this report, will show that the office has fully maintained its efficiency during the past year under the charge of Captain H. W. Benham, of the corps of engineers. The results of the computing and tidal divisions have already been referred to in a general way, and some of them quite at length. The action of all the divisions according to a regular plan, the parts of which fit with each other, is secured by a project of work submitted in advance by the assistant in charge to the examination of the Superintendent; the details, of course, to be varied from more or less in the course of the year, but unity of purpose is secured, and general conformity to a system arranged beforehand prevents desultory and irregular effect. Under the authority of the Treasury Department, nearly eight thousand sheets of charts and maps have been, during the past year, distributed or deposited for sale. Two-thirds of the number have been distributed gratuitously, and the remainder, with the exception of a few used in the office, have been sent by the disbursing agent to the sale agents, as heretofore. At the suggestion of the assistant in charg~, thirty-two sets, selected from the published maps, were bound into volumes and distributed to universities, naval stations,и and vessels, and to persons specially intenisted in the progress of commerce and navigation in various parts of the Union. It may in part be anticipated from the previous remarks that the tidal division bears, at present, a less simple relation to the organization of the survey than others. It is, in fact, in reference to the execution of the Superintendent's instructions for observations, and seeing to the faithful and continuous execution of their duties by the tidal observers, analogous to a field party, with many scattered observers, such as is controlled by Lieutenant Trowbridge. In reference to carrying on discussions of the observations, it is under the immediate direction of the Superintendent, who is, for all such discussions, effectively the chief of the party, though, aa

OF THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

21

his attention is necessarily of an intermitting sort, he finds it necessary to steadiness of execution to devolve this charge upon an assistant. The chief of the tidal diviHion is also chief of a party, and directly and solely responsible, in the discharge of this duty, to the Superintendent, with whom all correspondence should be held, and to whom all reports should he addressed. The tidal records go into the general archives of the survey, and are drawn from them from time to time, as their discussion requires. The results of the ti Jal party's discussions are furnished to the office for the maps and charts in prescribed forms. In this, and for all . purposes of regulation in regard to attendance, receipt of pay, and the like, the tidal division forms part of the office, and should correspond with the assistant in charge and report to him. These remarks will explain why a report of Assistant Pourtales finds notice in this introduction, and is given in the Appendix No. 32, while another is noticed under the head of the office, and placed with other reports in Appendix No. 36. The report in Appendix No. 32 shows the tidal observations made during the year, and the discussions in progress or made in relation to them. In the drawing division, the list of maps, charts and sketches (Appendix No. 36) shows seventy in hand, of which twenty-seven are finished maps, and forty-eight preliminary charts and sketches ; of these, thirty-six have been completed and thirty-nine are in progress. BeRides these there are ten diagrams, illustrating matters described in the report and appendix. These numbers are about the same as those of last year. The list of maps and preliminary charts and sketches (Appendix No. 36) which have been engraved up to this time shows two hundred and twenty-six, including some in every part of our extended coast. One hundred and fifty-seven are of localities on the Atlantic and Gulf coast, forty-four on the Pacific, and twenty-five are sketches showing the progress of the survey. The list includes, in some cases, different editions of the same map or chart. Forty-five of the sheets are of :finished maps and charts. The list of maps and charts engraving includes twenty-eight plates. There were unfinished at the date of the last report on the engraving, thirty-one plates ; forty-six have been commenced during the past year, and seventy-one, including nineteen progress sketches, having been completed during the year. All these numbers, which represent work finished or in progresA, .are an increase of those of the previous year, and attest the progress of this division of the office in its useful labors. The greater part of this is work of the inferior grades. The first-class engraving does not keep up with the field-work, notwithstanding all our efforts. We have tried at home everywhere, and abroad by correspondence, to increase our force of first-class engravers, but with very limited success; and my impression of the necessities of the case has become so strong, from observation year after year, of the increasing wants of this branch of th0 Coast Survey, that I have finally addressed the Department on the subject, (Appendix No. 37,) and have presented the case for its decisive action. The views of the assistant in charge of the office have been strongly presented to me, and I place them with my own in the Appendix No. 38. I doubt not that we shall realize important results from the action taken in this case, to which the zeal and energy of Captain Benham will be entirely devoted. Map engraving of the first class as a branch of art, especially topographical engraving, has been neglected in our country, and hence, when a demand occurs for :finished maps, it cannot be met. Other branches of this admirable art have taken precedence, in point of public estimation and profit, of this one; and we feel sensibly the consequences. To raise up a school of topographical engraving might be possible in a long series of years, but it would require a work on a much larger scale than ours, and of a more permanent character, and a community more patient in its demands for results, to make this a mode for ns to apply exclusively. \Ve hope, among the young men who devote themselves to the engraving art in our office, that some will become first-class engravers ; but a. few, however, of .many who enter, can hope to do so. We want immediately, not in the remote future, firHt-class results. The young men themselves who are to be taught want more fi.rst-class instructors.

22

RE PO R T 0 F T HE SUP ER IN T END E N T

We have heretofore derived great assistance in altering maps and enlarging them from the electrotype process. The entrance plate of Delaware bay having been some years ago irreparably injured, and the publication of the whole series being thus delayed, it was determined to expedite its re-engraving by dividing the plate between several engravers, trusting to re-uniting the parts by electrotyping. This was successfully done by the accomplished electrotypist of the Survey. Intent, however, always upon improving his art, he had become dissatisfied with ,the slow operation of making very nice joints between the plates to be combined, and with 'the injury which finely engraved plates suffered in the operations of making these joints, requiring much re-engraving after the combination was effected. He has hit upon a process by which the whole operation becomes extremely simple and perfect, and in which hours replace weeks formerly given to it. A thin electrotype cast of the plate to be remodeled is taken, which, while it has all the engraving perfectly upon it, is thin enough to be cut readily with the shears. The pieces cut to the requisite shapes are cemented, in the new form required, upon a blank plate, and an electrotype copy of this is made. A beautiful application of this process has lately been made to the map of Mobile bay. The entrance of this bay occurs both on the map of the Mississippi sound and of Mobile bay. Being engraved with the former map, it was copied by the electrotype, cut from it, joined to a similar cast of the upper bay, and now forms a map on one sheet of Mobile bay, in which scarcely any re-engraving is necessary. A description of the process devised by Mr. Mathiot will be found in Appendix No. 62. Besides the general maps resulting from the surveys, special ones have been in progress in the office during the year. The Congress map has been brought up to date; the Commissioners' map of the harbor of New York has been kept as closely up with the field-work as circumstances allowed; and the Light-house map for the Board has been studied and is in progress. A revised description of the Congress map will be found in Appendix No. 39. The map, as directed by law, exhibits in colors the principal results of the survey, and the statistics connected with it show the progress of the work and some of the more important details of methods. The number of items of information communicated from the archives again presents (Appendix No. 5) an increase within the past year, now numbering eighty-three, of which twenty-two were for departments of the government, fifty-eight for individuals or associations, and three for local authorities. An application to the Superintendent for such information is forwarded to the Treasury Department, and in no case, thus far, has its assent to the communication been refused. The conditions which it makes are the liberal ones, that if the information is published, credit shall be given to the Coast Survey for it, and that the cost of copying the record, or map, or chart, shall be borne by the person to whom it is sent. The list does not include the copies of proof-sheets of maps and of published ones sent upon special application, under the authority of the Treasury Department. It will be men that the localities embraced in the list extend over the entire coast of the United States, one of the early ones being Eggemoggin reach, east of Penobscot bay, in Maine, and one of those near the end being Matagorda bay, in Texas. The western coast localities occur frequently on the list. The following list of maps, sketches, and diagrams, to accompany this report, contains sixty titles, several small sketches or diagrams being in some cases placed upon the same plate. The maps and sketches of localities are arranged geographically in the separate sections of the survey. All those belonging to the first section are lettered A, to the second B, and so onward. They are numbered also in the order in which they occur in the section, as A No. 1, A No. 2, and so on. The first sketch in each section is the one showing the progress of the work in the section generally, and the sub-sketches of progress in different parts of the section come next in order. For general reference, a number will be found on the upperи part of the sheet of each plate. These numbers run through the whole series of plates in the volume. A list of the plates immediately precedes them, after the last page of the appendix. The diagrams n-0t referring to localities, and classed as miscellaneous, are lettered :

Light-house on Smith's island, \Vashington Territory. Light-house on Point "Wilson, иwashington Territory. These recommendations have been tra.nsmitted to the Light-house Board for their consideration through the Secretary of the Treasury. (Appendix No. 70.) The watchful consideration of the wants of navigation, and the recommendations for supplying them to the proper authorities, are among the most useful services which can be rendered by the officers of the Coast Survey. Special surveys have been made for the Land Office of the Florida Keys, under the act of Congress of June 28, 1848; and of the i1llands of the western coast, under the act of August 31, 1852 ; for the Engineer Department, of the Rappahannock river, Virginia, and of the St. John's, Florida. The work on the Florida keys, for the Land Office, included the connection of the Keys with each other, and.ultimately with the main, and their division into sections and quarter sections by meridians and parallels, referring to a determinate point on Key West, and to the difference of latitude and longitude from that point. The progress made has been duly r~ported to the Commissioner of the Land Office, consisting of extracts from the reports of the five assistants of the Coast Survey who have been employed in that region, embodying not only an account of the progress of the work, but also of the nature of the surface of the keys. Topographical maps representing the surveys accompanied the report, with descriptive notes relating to the positions of the marking-posts of the quarter sections. An inspection of this work was made by one of the senior assistants of the survey, and I visited, myself, the parties and examined the surveys executed. '.l'he report to the Commissioner is published in Appendix No. 25. We have met with many obstacles in the survey of the islands off the coast of California, but at the latest reports the parties were at work there, and from the character of the assistants engaged in the matter, they will, I doubt not, present as good an account of work as the season will permit. The schooner Humboldt, built by the Coast Survey for this work, and sent to the western coast, had, after a passage which was at first disastrous, requiring her to put into Rio to refit, reached San Francisco, where the assistant who was to employ her had long before arrived, and waited the means furnished by the new appropriation and the arrival of his vessel to join the other parties at work near the islands. I am expecting reports from theseи parties by every California mail, having provided for the anticipation of the reports usually made at the end of the season. The survey of the Rappahannock has been steadily prosecuted i the triangulation is now complete from above Fredericksburg to the mouth of the river; the topography is following it 4

closely, and the hydrography has reached a point below Tappahannock. The topographical party is now engaged there, and the hydrographic party will return as soon as their labors in New York bay can be l1rought to a close. Full details in regard to this survey will be found under the head of Section III, and in the Appendix No. 14, a letter relating to the river. The maps of the river are making in the office from the results already obtained, combining, together, the topography and hydrography of which maps already exist, as far as the surve)'." has been carried. и The survey of the St. John's river, from Mayport Mills to above Jacksonville, has been nearly completed. There is yet required the measurement of a local base of verification, and a portion of topography. The maps for the Engineer Department are in progress. The details of the work are given in Section VI of my report, under the heads of the several operations. Much difficulty was experienced in procuring the current observations recommended by tho commission on the river and requested by the Engineer Department. These, and the tidal observations, I have not yet investigated. I visited the parties during the surveying season, and looked into their plans of working and their results. Last year, by invitation of the city authorities of Portland, I took part in a commission for recommending a proper shore-line for the harbor, consisting of General Totten, United States Chief Engineer, Commander Charles H. Davis, U. S. Navy, and myself. The object of fixing a shore-line, beyond which parties should not be allowed to encroach upon the water, was to prevent, by timely action, injury to the noble harbor in question. The report of this commission has been published by the city authorities, but will probably not find its way into a public document, where it should, for reference, unless I place it in this report. (Appendix No. 31.) By so doing, I do not intend to imply authorship of the report, which will be readily recognised as that of one of my accomplished colleagues. The valuable statistics appended to this report of the commissioners by John A. Poor, Esq., of Portland,Ihave, by his permission, presented in abstract with the report. The notice of Portland harbor will, I think, be found of interest to nautical men, as well as to engineers. I proceed next to give a condensed statement of the operations of the past siirveying season, to October 1, 1855, and to follow this by the estimates for the fiscal year ending July, 1857, adapted to tije same scale of progress. SECTION I. Ooast of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rlwde Island.-( Sketches ..4. Nos. 1 and 2.)-Mount Harris, Dixmont, Maine, between the Kennebec and Penobscot, has been occupied as a geodetic and astronomical station, magnetic observations having been also made in connexion with the others. The minute reconnaissance of some doubtful lines in advance of the triangulation and for a base of verification, has been in progress. The secondary triangulation of the Kennebec from its entrance, to Bath, Maine, has been in progress. The topography of the ielands and main shore of Casco bay has been in progress. That of the sea-shore of New Hampshire, from the mouth of the Merrimac river to that of Hampton river and Great Boa.r'lil Head, and of the coast of Massachusetts, near Ipswich and Annisquam, has been completed. Some deficiencies near Hyannis, on the south shore of Cape Cod, have been supplied. A section of the Gulf Stream off Cape Cod and Nantucket has been attempted. The hydrography of Massachusetts bay has been continued. Stellwagen's bank has been further examined, and the off-shore work broad off from Cape Cod peninsula to deep water bas been in part executed. Deep-sea soundings han been made off the entrance to Massachusetts bay. The liydrography of the Vineyard and Nantucket sounds has been nearly completed. Additional tidal observations have been made at stations upon Nantucket and the Vineyard sounds, and upon Block Island sound. The permanent tide-gauge at Boston bas been kept up. The magnetic elements have been redetermined for changes at Burlington, Vermont ; Salem, Boston, and Nantucket, Massachusetts; and Providence, Rhode Island. A new chronometer expedition for the longitude of a central point of the survey has been completed. The computations arul :reductions of the season's work have been made.

The observations of the field parties, as they have been turned into the office, have been computed, and when approved passed into the archives. The topographical maps and hydrographic charts, with the computed results, have furnished the data from which the new maps and sketches referred to have been drawn and engraved. Some plates have been prepared for the annual report, not coming under the head of any of the sections. The engraved maps have been electrotyped, and from these plates impressions taken for publication. The numerous sketches of progress, and others accompanying the report, are in part from these data. The estimates for the next fiscal year are generally the same as those for the past. These suppose the same aid which is now furnished under the law from the Navy and War Departments by the detail of officers for the hydrography and land work respectively. The amounts thus estimated, and those appropriated for the present fiscal year, are given in parallel columns, as follows :

SECTION I.-FROM PASSAMAQUODDY BAY TO POINT JUDITH, INCLUDING THE COAST OF MAINE, NEW HAMPSHIRE, MASSACHUSETTS, AND RHODE ISLAND. (SKETCH A.) The survey has made its usual progress in this section. An additional station of the primary triangulation has been occupied between the Kennebec and Penobscot, its lines extending forward to Mount Desert and Isle au Haut, and the work being still quite in advance of the secondary. Astronomical and magnetic observations have been made at the same station, and additional magnetic observations at several others. The reconnaissance for a base of verification, and for some of the doubtful lines towards the boundary, has been completed. The secondary triangulation has been extended over the entrance to the Kennebec, and up the river to beyond Bath. The topography of Casco bay, its islands and main, has made progress; and that of the coast has been executed from near Newburyport to Hampton river entrance, besides work of filling-in on Cape Ann and Cape Cod. The hydrography of Massachusetts bay has made very good progress inside, and the ap_ proaches. Additional investigations of Stellwagen's bank have been made; several rocks have been determined. The difficult in and off-shore \Vork on the outside of Cape Cod peninsula has advanced well; and off-shore lines have been run west of Nantucket shoals, and between Cape Cod and George's bank. The hydrography of Nantucket and the Vineyard sounds has been nearly completed, and work of verification has been executed. A section of the Gulf Stream, southeast from Nantucket, has been partly explored. The tidal observations at Boston have been kept up. Additional observations for the tides of the Vineyard and Nantucket sounds have been made. A new chronometer expedition for examining the effects of temperature, supposed to produce the differences in former results of outward and inward voyages, has been made, and the observations are already under discussion. This included an elaborate examination of the eft'ects of temperature on the chronometers employed in the expedition. The usual observations far culminations have been procured, and observations on tran&its of lunar spots for longitude have

been in the course of examination. The preparations made to carry out the suggestions of Professor Peirce in regard to the triangulation of the Pleiades, and their uses in conjunction with the moon, for longitudes, at the next period of their occultations, are noticed in the introduction to my report. The following maps, charts, and sketches, have been drawn within the year: Portland harbor, TOtoo and 2 / 00, (for Commissioners,) Nantucket shoals, Gloucester harbor, Plymouth harbor, Ipswich and Annisquam harbors, Bass River harbor, Monomoy shoals, Eastern series Nos. 2 and 3, and the chart of Massachusetts bay is in progress. The engraving of the following plates has been in progress during the year : Portland harbor, Annisquam and Ipswich harbors, Boston harbor, Plymouth harbor, Monomoy shoals, Bass River harbor, Muskeget channel, and Eastern series No. 1. The engraving of Salem, Newburyport, and Gloucester harbors has been completed. Reconnaissance.-The reconnaissance for a base of verification for the primary triangulation, and for some of the projected lines, in Maine, considered doubtful from examinations of previous years, has been continued by Assistant Charles 0. Boutelle, aided by Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan, and by Mr. F. P. Webber. In the month of October, Mr. Boutelle examined the intervening ridge found by Major Prince to exist upon the line Moose-a-bee - Cooper; but, owing to the prevalence of fogs and r!l.ins, was not able to complete the reconnaissance before the time proper for his return to the work in Section V. It will be resumed early in the next summer. A topographical survey was made, under the direction of Mr. Boutelle, by Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan and Mr. F. P. Webber, of the site for a base of verification found last year by Major Prince upon Epping plains. A plan and profile of this line, and its connexion with the primary triangulation, has been submitted by Mr. Boutelle. The site is represented on Sketch A. The connections of the base site with the stations in the quadrilateral in which it is situated, are all that could be desired as means for verifying the primary triangulation in Section I. Primary triangtdation and astronomical, observations.-After the measurement of the Florida. bases in April and May, the party under my immediate charge returned to Washington, and comparisons of the base apparatus with the standard bar were carefully made. The party next proceeded to this section, where Mount Harris, Dixmont, was occupied between the 25th of July and 22d of October. Horizontal angles were measured for the primary triangulation, azimuths, latitude, and magnetic elements determined, and vertical angles measured for heights. The season and locality were very unfavorable for the geodetic observations ; frequent haze and storms, and the fogs of the Penobscot and Kennebec, interrupting them. The nights were, until late in the season, favorable for astronomical work, especially near the zenith, to which our modes of observing refor. There were eight heliotrope points to be observed upon, and three secondary signs.le, the shortest of the primary lines being 26.5 miles, and the longest 60. It was necessary to raise the heliotrope on Mount Desert some fifty-six feet above the ground, in order that the line from Mount Harris should pass above Mount Waldo. The station point at Mount Harris had been elevated twenty feet above the ground by a substantial structure of mason work, prepared last season. I was assisted in the observations generally by Assistant G. W. Dean, who had entire charge of the transit observations for time, and of the latitude and magnetic observations, a:хtl measured the vertical angles for heights. Mr. S. J. Hough was the recorder of the geodetic work, Messrs. F. M. M:clver and McLane Tilton of the astronomical. Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow also observed for latitude, in order to test the question of personal equation with the zenith telescope, and was engaged under my immediate direction in ~iscussing the observations and bringing up the records of the measurement of the Florida bases, m which he had assisted. I was indebted to Assistant A. S. Wadsworth for aid in posting heliotropers, and to Lieutenant James Totten, U. S. A., for the erection of a high station and scaffold at Mount Desert. The necessity for great steadiness in the structure, and for great strength to make it resist the high winds of this region and season of the year, made this work

36

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

one of no small practical difficulty. Lieutenant Totten also assisted, from time to time, in the observations of horizontal angles. Two zenith telescopes were used by Assistant Dean in order to examine, in a point of view which had suggested itself to him, the subject of personal equation differing from that to which I have above referred, namely, the use of different instruments by the same observer, determining the latitude by the same stars. 'fhe number of measures taken for the primary anglps was 1,025 upon eight points, and for the secondary 150 upon three points, with the thirty-inch theodolite by Troughton & Simms, (C. S. No. 1.) The number of measures of vertical angles for heights was 180 upon four stations, with the eight-inch Gambey, (C. S. No. 57,) and 104: upon eleven stations with the micrometer of the thirty-inch theodolite. The station at Thomas' Hill, Bangor, which had been used by the late Assistant S. C. Walker in determining, by telegraph, the difference of longitude between Cambridge and Bangor, and Bangor and Halifax, was observed in turn with the primary stations. A mark at the distance of about two and a half miles was connected with the primary station, and its azimuth determined by eleven sets of observations on Polaris at its eastern elongation, and by five on Lamda Ursre Minoris at upper culmination. Each set of observations consisted of five pointings on the star, telescope direct, and as many telescope reversed, and of twelve paintings on the mark, telescope direct and reversed. These numbers have been derived from previous examinations of the probable errors of observation. The latitude observations by Mr. Dean consisted of 264: sets on 49 pairs of stars, with a new zenith telescope by William Wiirdemann, loaned by that artist, and of 179 sets on 39 pairs with a Troughton & Simms zenith telescope, (C. S. No. 2.) The number of observations on each pair of stars was five. Of the pairs 16 were selected from the Greenwich Twelve Year Catalogue, and 33 from the British Association Catalogue. The values of the micrometers were determined by 480 observations on Polaris at elongation, and of the levels by forty measurements with the micrometer screw, the pointings being made upon a collimator adjusted to a siderial focus. The observations made by Mr. Goodfellow consisted of 224 sets on 38 pairs of stars with a Wiirdemann zenith telescope, and of 220 observations for micrometer value, the same pairs being used, as far as practicable, as in Mr. Dean's observations, and the micrometer value being determined in the same way. Too much praise cannot be awarded to the new zenith telescope made by Mr. Wiirdemann. In his report (Appendix No. 4:4:) Mr. Dean says: "This instrument is the largest, and, in point of nice mechanical construction and style of finish, far excels all others of a similar kind which have fallen within my notice. The telescope is fifty-one inches in focal length, with an aperture of three and three-fourths inches. The diaphragm consists of five vertical threads, adjusted at convenient intervals for transit observations, and provided with an adjusting screw for collimation. The limits of the field are equal to fifty revolutions of the micrometer, or more than thirty minutes of arc, and the arrangement for its illumination is most complete. The lamp is small, but so constructed that it gives a strong, steady light from seven to eight hours without any attention, and without affecting the instrument by heat. The eye-piece is provided with a parallactic movement, and the levels attached to the telescope are of the most perfect construction. The weight of the telescope and its appendages upon its horizontal axis is almost entirely removed by an ingenious contrivance for attaching the counterpoise weight, devised by Mr. Wiirdemann, by which the bearing is transferred to the outside of the steel cylinder, enclosing the horizontal axis, by means of a steel-bar lever which is attached to the telescope, and a ring moving freely upon friction rollers around the steel cylinder and directly over the vertical axis." "The design, construction, and finish of this instrument are highly creditable to the artistic taste and workmanship of Mr. Wiirdemann." The time for the latitude and azimuth observations was determined by 129 transits of high and low stars with the Wiirdemann portable transit, (C. S. No. 10.) This small instrument

fully sU!ltained the reputation given to its class by the observations made by Assistant Davidson on the western coast, detailed in my report of last year. Magnetic observations.-The magnetic declination was determined at a point just southwest of the station, by 188 observations on four days with a portable declinometer by Jones, (C. S. No. 1.) A magnetic disturbance accompanying an Aurora interrupted the observations on one day, but the results accepted appeared quite free from disturbing action. The horizontal intensity was obtained from two sets of observations on two days. The dip was measured by four sets on four days with a ten-inch dip-cirr,le by Barrow, (C. S. No. 4,) the place of observation being near that for the declination. The geological formation of Mount Harris is called by Dr. Jackson talcose 1;late. Gneiss appears in parts of the hill, but not at the summit. Metrorological observations.-The usual meteorologicaljournal was kept by Mr. S. J. Hough, and 333 observations for temperature, 270 for the evaporating point, and 356 of the barometer, (Green, No. 613, and aneroid by Dent, No. 8580,) wind, &c., were recorded. The heliotropers kept journals of the weather at each station, and forwarded them weekly. A comparison of these journals enables us to form conclusions in regard to the general direction and velocity of passing storms, and assist in fixing their geographical limits. The climate in this part of the section presents a strong contrast to that further south-in Massachusetts, for example-in relation to geodetic work. The sudden change from a comparatively high to a low temperature is accompanied by frequent storms of wind and rain, by great cloudiness, and by almost constant haze. The water retaining its comparatively high temperature, sea-fogs are very frequent. The powerful radiation which goes on at night when the sky is clear, covers the numerous ponds and valleys with fog, which, on the rising of the sun, is set in motion, and entirely destroys the transparency of the air. The abrupt change of temperature in the air by cooling, when the ground is comparatively warm, causes extraordinary lateral as well as vertical refraction. The cloudy days of autumn, of which we usually had two or three while working in Massachusetts, when the air was so transparent that very distant signals were perfeetly seen, have not been met in our experience at this station. This summer I considered the propriety of changing the day observations with heliotropes for night ones with lamps and lenses; but the observations in regard to the fogs showed that it was not advisable to make the change. At present, with our long lines, we keep fully ahead of the secondary triangulation, even while working only a part of a season in this section; and as the number of points to be observed diminish on approaching the boundary, and the length of the lines diminish, the work can, at any time after the occupation of Mount Desert, be pushed, if at all necessary. Magnetic ob8ervati01W.-During the montli иof August, observations for the determination of magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were made by Charles A. Schott, Esq., of the computing division, Coast Survey office, at the following named stations in the section: Salem, Boston, and Nantucket, Mass., and Providence, R. I. The results obtained at these several places, and at other stations, as noticed under Sections II and III, are given in Appendix No. 49. Mr. Schott was aided in the operations here mentioned by Mr. J. Main, of the computing division. As Mr. Schott's labors spread over several sections, I give his report in the appendix (No. 49) as presenting a view of the whole series. The expenditure on these observations is the smallest, considering the results obtained, ever incurred for such a purpose in the survey. Secondary triangulation.-Assistant C. 0. Boutelle has presented, in a very complete shape, the results of secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine from Saco river to the mouth of the Kennebec, execut.ed by him in 1850, 1852, and 1854. In this report he says: "I beg to call your attention to the marked contrast presented between the statistics of work shown in the preface to Vol. I, and in my report of work in Section V, lately sent you. Six months' work in Section I has sufficed to occupy four-tenths as many stations, to measure as

''If the cost of each work were similarly contrasted, it would show the difference still more
strongly marked." The continuation of the secondary triangulation of the coast of Maine has been under charge of Lieutenant A. W. Evans, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, assisted by Sub-Assistant Benjamin Huger, jr. The work has been confined to the Kennebec river, extending from the mouth, which it connects with Mr. Boutelle's triangulation to Merrymeeting bay. The wooded character of the shores of the river has made the work tedious. Lieutenant Evans made a reconnaissance in Merrymeeting bay in the month of August, and during the progress of the work connected two stations, viz: SebattiY and Manhegan, of the primary triangulation, with a new point in the secondary series upon the Damariscotta river. Connections were also made with points in the secondary work of the previous year, to the westward. The triangulation of this season includes the city of Bath and the towns of Phipsburg, Arrowsic, and Georgetown. Points were also established in Woolwich, Westport, Wiscasset, Edgecombe, and Boothbay. Twenty-nine stations in all were established, of which twelve were occupied. One hundred and ninety-one angles were measured upon seventy-two objects, by fifteen hundred and forty-five observations. Four hundred and sixty measurements were made for vertical angles at four stations. The work was discontinued in the middle of November, at which time Lieutenant Evans prepared the schooner " Hassler," which had been employed in the service of his party for resuming duty in Section V. He expresses his obligations for the essential assistance rendered by SubAssistant Huger, who has been assigned to the charge of a party to be engaged on the western coast of Florida. Topography.-Assistant A. W. Longfellow has continued the topography of islands in Casco bay, east of Portland, in connection with the determination of the shore-line of the ma.in land, from a point opposite Mackworth's island northward, and eastward beyond Clapboard island. The islands embraced in his sheet of this season are, Long, Marsh, Jewett's, Green Crotch, Hope, Little Jebeig, Great Jebeig, Crow, Sand, Little Bangs, Stave, Ministerial, Bates', Cousins', Little John's, Great Mages, Stockman's, Sturdevant's, and Basket island. The shore-line of all at high and low-water mark, and the topography of several of those named, has been completed. This work was commenced on the first of August, and terminated on the arrival of the period for the return of Assistant Longfellow to Section V, where he had been engaged in the former part of the present surveying season. Mr. N. S. Finney has been attached to the party as aid. The schooner Meredith was employed in furnishing transportation, and was also 1l8ed in the early part of the season in posting the heliotropers for the primary triangulation. It was intended to use this work immediately for the hydrography of Casco bay, and Mr. Longfellow was directed accordingly to work up the shore-lines. The steamer Walker, Lieut. Comg. Sands, was directed to this point, but her repairs occupied so much more time than had been reported as neccessary for the purpose, that the proper season passed before she could reach the atati-0n, and the stormy character ()f the weather here 7 entirely broke in upon my plans.

After completing the work of verification assigned to him in Chesapeake bay, (see Section III,) Assistant H. L. Whiting was occupied in office-work until the season was favorable for topography in Section I. He then commenced filling up the space between the planetable sheets of Assistants Boyce and Gliick near Falmouth, between Essex and Annisquam, on his own sheets, and extending the coast topography from the limits of Assistant Longfellow's sheet near Newburyport, and to the mouth of Hampton river. The sheet from north of Newburyport, Massachusetts, to Great Boar's Head, New Hampshire, (see Sketch A bis,) was chiefly executed by Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardella, and verified by Mr. \Vhiting. "The work is carried back to the Eastern railroad, which has been the boundary, inland, for the last two seasons. The work is much in detail, with the sand-hills of Salisbury and part of Hampton Beach, the marshes back of them, with Hampton river, and numerous creeks winding through them in all directions. The necks and fast land are pretty thickly settled with farms and irregular portions of cleared and wooded land." " The character of the country slightly changes from that further south ; the high rolling hills peculiar to the country between Ipswich and Newburyport seem to recede further from the shore, and the land is generally lower, more. rocky, and apparently not so fertile, and the pine and cedar seem to be a more characteristic growth. There are some rocks and ledges off Hampton river and Great Boar's Head, which stretch out towards the Isle of Shoals, and seem to indicate a gradual return of the rocky and broken character of our northern coast, which was for some distance quite lost in the 'Cove' or interval between the promontory of Cape Ann and the more rugged country we are again approaching. The shore still continues quite low, however,~ the northward, Great Boar's Head being the only bluff or headland in the vicinity which is directly on the shore." The following are the statistics of Mr. Whiting's work: Shore-line............................................................................

The topography north of Thompson's station, Cape Ann-above referred to as near Annisquam-was executed by Mr. Whiting, assisted by Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan. "This work (Sketch A bis,) comprised the high broken land of 'West Parish,' directly north of your station of 'Thompson's,' and lying between Squam and Essex rivers. I was able to resume the work without trouble or delay, and made a very satisfactory closing of this sheet. The weather during this time was very favorable. " The character of the country is that peculiar to this ridge of Cape Ann, wonderfully broken, with abrupt hills, rocks~ valleys, &c. The height of the country ranges from 150 to 200 feet; all minor and artificial details, as buildings, woods, fences, &c., seem lost in the general character of huge rocks and boulders, sometimes absorbing nearly three curves." "The amount of detail, as generally given, does not r.over the work, which is one mass of curves of contour and elevation. The area surveyed is about five square miles, with some ten miles of road." The survey near Hyannis was made by Sub-Assistant Sullivan, and verified by Mr. Whiting. It covered an area of about six square miles of wooded country. Mr. Whiting speaks very favorably of the work of both of his assistants. The season here having closed, Assistant Whiting has been instructed to resume the work of verification in Section III, Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardella to take up the topography of the Florida keys (Section VI,) and Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan has been assigned the charge of a topographical party in Texas (Section IX) with Assistant Gilbert.

Hydrography.-Two parties have been engaged in the regular hydrography of this sectionthat of Lieut. Comg. H. S. Stellwagen in the steamer "Bibb," with the schooner "Petrel" as a tender, and that of Lieut. Comg. C. R. P. Rodgers in the schooner "Gallatin." A third party, that of Lieut. Comg. B. F. Sands, commanding the steamer "Walker," was assigned to work in the part of the Gulf Stream more immediately connected with this section, and in Casco bay; but the repairs to the steamer occupied so much more time than was anticipated, that the very "boisterous autumn weather of this year commenced before the vessel was ready for sea, and rendered impracticable the completion of more than a part of the Gulf Stream work. The hydrography of Lieut. Comg. H. S. Stellwagen, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, has consisted of several lines eastward from Nantucket, some one hundred and fifty miles and back, to Nausett, Cape Cod. Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen made search for a bank north and east of Stellwagen's bank, indicated by Lieut. Comg. Almy, from soundings which he had made on approaching this point of the coast in the "Independence,'' but without success. This party determined the position of the rock and flat ground in Gloucester harbor, pointed out by Mr. Webber, one of the pilots. The rock is "on Eastern Point ledge. The flat ground is a continuation of Dog bar." Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen further says: "Webber's rock lies S.S. W., true, from Eastern Point light, distant three hundred and sixty-three yards, and has but seven feet water at ordinary low tides; its top is not more than three or four feet in diameter, and could be easiiy removed by powder. The 'flat ground' spoken of by :M:r. Webber is part of the 'Dog Bar ledges;' shoalest water sixteen feet at ordinary low tide. "\Ve found a space with but thirteen feet at Round rock, and a small ledge extending a little north of it, with fifteen and seventeen feet." A syphon tide-gauge, invented by Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen, was tried by him near Highland light, Cape Cod, and with good results. Additional soundings upon the southern extremity of Stellwagen's bank showed that the twenty-fathom curve extended further south and east than was previously supposed. The new edition of the chart (see Sketch No. 5) shows this extension. The party also located "Sammy's" rock, between Nahant and Marblehead, a..nd a small rock near Nahant. The following office-work was completed by the party before resuming work afloat this season: "1. Sheet of off-shore soundings, extending from Nantucket shoals S. E., E., and N. E.; scale 30<f0 00 и "2. New plotting and completing chart of the south side of Nantucket island, connecting work on the Nantucket shoals with that ofMuskeget channel; scale TIAooи " 3. Completion of work between Marblehead and Boston harbor; scale 21ri>ooи "4. Plotting, completion, and reduction of the chart of Massachusetts bay, including Stellwagen's bank; scale 1oo1000, reduction " 5. Plotting one line of soundings between Chatham and Cape Cod, 40 -ho. ''The copying of soundings and tide-books, &c., and labelling and recording specimens, have also been finished.'' The statistics of the season's work are as follows: "Deep-sea lines, from South shoal to eastward and return, number of angles, 12; soundings, 248 ; miles, 330. "Atlantic coast, Cape Cod peninsula, number of angles, 505; soundings, 2,484; miles, 351computed in round numbers, as some lines extend from Cape Cod to Massachusetts bay. Massachusetts bay, Stellwagen's bank, &c., number of angles, 1,126; soundings, 5,738; miles run in sounding, 1,025. "Total angles, 1,643; soundings, 81470; miles, 1 7706."

From the lines run, we obtain a glimpse of the form of bottom in this region of complexity; but it will require many more, fully to explore it. The mc;1st instructive line is that due east from the Nantucket light-vessel, on which we have in succession, beginning fifteen nautical miles from the vessel, twenty-eight fathoms; forty-five, forty, twenty-four fathoms; at :fifty-five miles, thirty, thirty, twenty-five, twenty-nine or thirty, twenty-nine, twenty-one fathoms; at ninety miles, thirty-six, thirty-eight, forty-five, forty-four, forty-four, forty-nine, fifty, sixtytwo; and one hundred and thirty fathoms, at one hundred and fifty-two miles; showing between fifty-five and ninety miles a space with from twenty-one to thirty fathoms. South of the twentyone to thirty fathoms' space, a line run at about fifteen to twenty miles' distance s11ows deeper water; while north of it, and between this space and George's bank, three lines show respectively eighteen and twenty-five fathoms; twenty-nine, twenty-five, seventeen, twenty, twentytwo, twenty-two fathoms; and twenty, twenty-five, twenty-five, fifteen, twenty-five fathoms. This indicates that the shoal space is related to George's bank and the shoal ground on the north. The steep pitch which characterizes these under-water slopes, as far as we have examined the coast, appears on the line first referred to at about one hundred and fifty miles from land. The same occurs at about one hundred and thirty-five miles on a line nearly east by south from the southeastern point of Nantucket, and about one hundred miles on a line southeast from the same point. The party of Lieut. Oomg. 0. R. P. Rodgers, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the schooner Gallatin, commenced operations on the first of August. "The first work was the survey of the shoals near Stage harbor and Chatham lights. Thence we proceeded to survey the mid-passage between Great Point and Monomoy, including a minute examination of Great Round shoal, where we found in one place but two feet of water. We then filled the deficiencies on the southeast side of Martha's Vineyard, and those between West Chop and the Nantucket light-boat. After this we devoted ourselves to a patient and very minute examination of the numerous shoals north of Muskeget and Tuckernuck islands-a most difficult field, covered with sand-rips, over which the tide rushes with great velocity. The wind in this locality is rarely moderate; when there is not a :flat calm, the breeze is usually fresh enough to baffie or impede the hydrographer, while in the frequent fogs he also finds a formidable enemy. We have very carefully surveyed a clear, beating, ship channel, with not less than seventeen feet at low water, passing between the Tuckernuck, the Shovelful, and the Muskeget shoals, towards the hai;boj of Nantucket, with three buoys to mark its outline. This channel cannot fail to be much used by vessels bound to Nantucket from the westward. In fresh northerly winds it will save much exposure to a rough sea, shorten the distance, and perhaps obviate the necessity of beating to windward. It will at all times be v-ery advantageous to the steamers on the route between New Bedford and Nantucket, and to the Nantucket wha.le-ships, which are usually, during six months of the year, towed by steam to Edgartown; where, during the winter months, they load and refit." Lieut. Comg. Rodgers acknowledges the efficient services of the officers in his command, and also specially mentions the valuable aid kindly afforded by the collector at Nantucket, E. W. Allen, Esq., and by the collector at New Bedford, C. B. H. Fessenden, Esq., in placing boa.ts at his disposal for the use of the hydrographic party. The work, terminating on the 10th of October, presented the following statistics: Number of m1 и1es run in и sound mg ..................................................................... . 894: Number of theodolite angles ............................................................................. . 1,4'1 Number of sextant angles ....................................... ииииииииии .. иииииииииииииииии .. иииии .. ииии 1,042 Number of soundings recorded ............................ ., ............................................и 16,200

gress of his work, seem to have remained, until the period of his thorough examination, entirely unknown. The shoal discovered by Lieut. Comg. Rodgers, a mile and a half to the southward of Nantucket light-boat, (see Appendix No. 11,) though determined in position and general limits, notwithstanding the lateness of the season, will be more :tirecisely defined in the course of the ensuing surveying year. , Tides.-The regular observations of tides at Boston have been kept up, and those already collected have been under discussion. 'rl1is, in fact, is one of our most reliable and continuous series on the Atlantic coast. I have already noticed the discussion of the results in the introductory part of the report. The study of the curious interference tides in :Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, and in the passages between them and the ocean, and in the ocean near the shores of the islands of the same names, was commenced last year, and the limits of the variable tides, the characteristic forms of the interference waves, and the general facts in regard to the tides, were obtained by observation. This year observations based upon the conclusions of the former season have been made for the more minute determination of the curious tidal phenomena of this region. Observations have also been made upon the laws of the tides in basins communicating by narrow entrances with the sea. SECTION II.-FROM POINT JUDITH TO CAPE HENLOPEN, INCLUDING THE COAST OF CONNECTICUT, NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA, AND DELAWARE. (SKETCH B.) In the spring of this year, the Commissioners appointed by the governor, under authority of an act of the legislature of the State of New York, to restrain the encroachments on the harbor of New York, and to report in relation to them, called upon the President of the United States for the services of engineers and surveyors to assist them in labors which they deemed not only of loca.l but of national importance. They were referred by .the President to the Coast Survey office, and, during my absence in Florida, conferred with the assistant in charge, Captain Benham, of the corps of engineers, and explained their views and wishes. Under the sanction of the President and Secretary of the Treasury, and by request of the Commissioners, I subsequently went to New York and arranged for them a re-survey of New York bay and harbor, which should present at once the outline and topography of the immediate shores, and the liydrograpby of the harbor, the outer bay, and adjacent bays, and the East and North rivers, and subsequently give the whole topography and hydrography of the bay and dependencies, as required by the State law, the Commissioners bearing the expense of the work, and having the services of the Coast Survey officers as volunteers in it, and the use of the vessels, instruments, equipments, and the like. With these arrangements for the field-work were others, connected with the preparation of e. map of the survey; first in a preliminary form, with shore-line, characteristic topography of tlie immediate shores and hydrography, and finally in a complete form, to show the city and wharves, the adjacent cities, and to extend eastward to the meridian of Throg's Point; westward to that of Perth .Amboy, New Jersey; on the north to about a mj.le above Spuyten-dyvil creek on the Hudson; and to the south to ab()ut the old entrance of Shrewsbury river, which would include the seaward approaches of the bay. A comparktive map was prepared of the previous surveys of the Coast Survey executed in parts of the harbor and approaches in 1836, 1848, and 1853, and the interest attaching to its results determined the Commissioners to ha'f'e the new surveys added to the comparison in a similar map. A comparative map of New York city and the south end of Manhattan island was also directed to be prepared for varioll.e p~ods characteristic in the growth of the city, and from authentic materials accessible to Commи sioners in the State and city offices, and in private collecti-Ons.

The arrangements for the field and office work were submitted by me to th(и f', иmmissioners and approved, and I have kept the operations steadily in view by weekly rqиurts from the field and half-monthly from the office, so as to supply additional facilities or parties to meet the contingencies of the weather and other circumstances. The assistants who have engaged in this survey, whose names will be stated in the notices which follow, have all entered upon it with a heartiness which does them very great credit; and each one has obviously made it a study, that so far as he was concerned, the work Rhould succeed, and that tlir difficult conditions of coming up to time, without sacrificing accuracy, should be fulfilled. I supposed at first that but little triangulation would be necessary, and transferred the party of Assistant Edmund Blunt from the upper part of the Hudson to this work in consequence of his knowledge of the localities of the signals formerly established by the Coast Survey, but I soon found that all his ability and skill would be required to keep the i)arties depending upon him for points, at work. The changes in the. neighborhood of the city were such, that not only most of the station points were lost by occupation by buildings and the like, but the lines were interrupted in the same way or by ornamental trees ; hills had been cut down, and radical changes of all sorts had been made, so as to render almost an entirely new triangulation indispensable. This was readily made upon the basis of the lines of the old work which could be recovered ; but the question being one of time, and the topographical and hydrographic parties not being able to begin their work effectively until numerous new points were determined, Mr. Blunt' s powers were severely taxed. In addition to his former assistant, Lii>utenant A. H. Seward, U. S. Army, I detailed Assistant C. P. Bolles to join Mr. Blunt, expecting that he would serve but a fow weeks, but instead of this he was obliged to remain in :New York from early in July until the beginning of October. Further aid being necessary, Suh-Assistant .Tohn Rockwell was next instructed to join Mr. Blunt, and remained with him until the close of the season. The services of these gentlemen will be stated in a more detailed notice of the work from Mr. Blunt' s report. Assistant F. H. Gerdes had already, last year, commenced, and in great part completed, a map of thewharvesof the city of New York. This work he was instructed to complete, and to add the city, and the cities of Brooklyn, Jersey City, and Hoboken, and then the topography of the shores of the East river and Hell Gate to Throg's Point; of Harlem river, and of the Hudson to the limits of his former survey of its banks. Assistant R. D. Cutts was instructed to take up the topography of Staten Island and its vicinity up to Jersey City, and on his being relieved, to join the Commissioners under the treaty relating to the fisheries of the coast, Assistant A. S. 'Wadsworth was ordered from my party for this duty. Assistant A. M. Harrison took up the topography of Sandy Hook, and of the shores of Shrewsbury river, of Sandy Hook bay, and of Raritan bay. Subsequently, Assistant S. A. Gilbert was instructed to execute the topography from Brooklyn round the shores of the inner and outer bay, of Coney island and Long Island to beyond Rockaway inlet. To Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. Navy, assistant in tlie Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, and schooner Madison, Lieutenant Truxton, was intrusted the hydrography of the East river, Hell Gate, and the sound; of Throg's Point, of the upper and lower bays, and the approaches from see.~ and of Raritan bay. To Lieut. Oomg. Richard Wainwright, in the schooner Nautilus, was assigned the hydrography of the Hudson from above Yonkers to the mouth ; and on his being furnished by the Commissioners with a small steamboat, which very much facilitated his work, that of Newark bay, of Kill van Kull, and of Arthur Kull sound. The computations of his work were ma.de by Assistant Blunt as fast as the observations were turned in 1 and the results furnished to the other parties and to the office at Washington.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The topographers, as they determined shore-line from time to time, traced it and furnished it to the hydrographic parties, and sent it also to the office. The hydrographic work was plotted, as it came in, by Mr. Balbach, the draughtsman of Lieut. Comg. Craven's party, and by Mr. Strausz, the draughtsman of Lieut. Comg. Wainwright's party. Tracings were sent, as the work advanced, to the office at vVashington. At the office a projection was made for the map by Mr. Boschke, and the results worked,in a.s fast as they were furnished; by him and by Mr. Key . . The assistant in charge did his best, also, by communicating the wants of the office to the field parties and to me, to obtain the necessary materials in time. The various information which had been determined to be placed on the map was collected, as far as practicable, before the com letion of the survey. I was indebted to Captain A. A. Gibson, U. S . .Army, for the interest which he showed in this matter, and for the various suggestions which he made to improve the value of the map. The scale of this map bas been agreed upon with the Commissioners as 26 h 0 , ; and besides this, a map of the city wharves and of Brooklyn was to be made upon a scale of infooи On the scale of 20 ~ 00 the Commissioner's map will consist of twelve sheets, each 44 inches long by 28 inches wide, and forming, when united, a large sheet, 11 feet in length and 9~ feet in width. The comparative map of different surveys will be on a scale of 2 0 t 00 , and in two large sheets, 4 feet by 4 feet. This study is in charge of Mr. Boscbke. In August last I repaired. to New York to meet the officers who had been selected to act as advisers in regard to the engineering and other questions involved in the encroachments on the harbor, and while there communicated with the Coast Survey parties, giving supplementary instructions, and carefully informing myself of the degree of progress of the seWJral parts of he survey. I proceed to notice the several operations of the parties, drawn from the reports to the :first of November. Triangulation.-This embraces an area of four hundred and thirty-four miles, extending over the space already described as included in the limits of the Commissioner's map. It has been executed by Assistant Edmund Blunt, with the aid of Assistant A. H. Seward, U. S. Army, and .Assistants C. P. Bolles, . and John Rockwell. Between the 20th of June and the 30th of October ' one hundred and thirty-eight stations were occupied, and 1,589 series of observations made, consisting of 10,397 observations. This presents an amount of work almost unprecedented. With great practical skill, it has been made of the character exactly required, so as to lose no time by aiming at arrangement of triangles inappropriate to the circumstances of the case. Topography.-The limits of the topographical sheets executed by Assistant F. H. Gerdes are stated in his report, Appendix No. 21. They consist of two sheets of the East river, two of the North (Hudson) river, and one of Manhattan island. The statistics of the details are as follows:

Interesting particulars in regard to the amount of washing away of the south shore of Raritan bay are given in Mr. Harrison's report. Mr. Harrison was assisted by Mr. P. R. Hawley, and had the use of the Coast Survey schooner "John Y. Mason" for transportation. 'fhe report of Assistant S. A. Gilbert (Appendix No. 22) shows the following amount of work executed on Long Island, between Gowanus and Hog Island inlet. The amount of details thus far surveyed is as follows : и Shore-line..................................................................... 178 miles.

Mr. Gilbert acknowledges the assistance derived from the services of Mr. Malcolm Seaton, aid in his party. The plane-table work of. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth, executed between the 10th of August and 1st of November, extended on the Jersey shore from Jersey City to Constable's Point, on Staten Island; on Staten Island, from the quarantine to Newark bay, and including also the shores of Newark bay to the mouths of the Passaic and Hackensack rivers. Fifty miles of shoreline are comprised in it. The party is still at work completing the shores of the Great Kills. Hydrography.-In the execution of the hydrography of the East river, and of the inner and . outer harbors, Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven reports the following work done up to November 1st: Area surveyed: (square miles) ......... ;............................................... 40 Miles of soundings........................................................................ 1,967 Number of angles measured............................................................ 5,132 Number of soundings ..................................................................... 74,050 Greatest depth of water, (fathoms)................................................... 20 Least depth of water, (fathom)....................................................... 1 Tides observed, (stations)............................................................... 5 Operations commenced............................................................ .. . . . .

The discovery or development of a shoal in the main ship-channel, south of the Narrows and near West bank, is one of the important results of this re-survey. Official information ofи this is expected at an early date, and will be published at once. Lieut. Comg. Craven made some very interesting experiments, at my suggestion, to test his views of the source of increase of the point of Sandy Hook; these, however, require repetition before drawing positive conclusions from them . . Up to the 1st of November, Lieut. Cvmg. Wainwright had completed the part of the Hudson river between Glenwood and Castle Garden, Newark bay, and Kill van Kull and Arthur Kull, or Staten Island sound, to Elizabethport, and expected to complete the work assigned to him и before the eloae of the season.

The statistics of his work are as follows: Number of milPs of sountlings ran.................................................. 388 " angles observed.......... .. . . ...... ..... ............ ...... .... ....... .... 4,311 " casts of the lead.......................................................... 28,259 current sti,,_ions occupied............................................... l~ " " tidal stations occupied................................................... 5 A small steamboat was employed for Lieut. Oomg. vVainwright by the Commissioners, and served greatly to advance the _progress of the hydrography. Assistant H. I,. Whiting, on his return from Section I, made an examination and re-survey of Sandy Point, near Stonington, Connecticut, and found that a material change had taken place since the survey in 1839, along the beach and point north from Xapatree, (the bluff at the southwest angle of the bea.ch, extending from \Vatch Hill to Sa.ndy Point.) He reports that, since the period of the former survey, the point bas extended northward about a thousand feet, and that it has also chauged in shape since 1839. "The greatest ancl most important chango, however, is in the bay or I arbor. The encroachments of the beach, and deposites c.f sand beyond, have entirely changed the condition of the channel." A hydrographic examination of this locality, and re-survey if necessary, will be included in the instructions of the ensuing season. In addition to the foregoing, the frillowing work has been done in this section: JJfagnetic observations.-An elaborate discussion of observations in the United States, with a view to determine the changes of variation, has been made duriug the 1iast two years by Charles A. Schott, Esq., of the computing division of the Coast Survey office. The importance of the results must be obvious when it is stated that, without them, the variations upon our published charts become in a few years obsolete ; and that, with them, they may be supplied without sensible error for many years. и In the course of this discussion it became apparent that, at certain localities, the magnetic elements must be re-determined, to test the amount of their change. This has been done in the cours_и of the past summer by Mr. Schott, assisted by Mr. Main, of the computing division, the stations having been selected in reference to their immediate usefulness for the purposes referred to. In New York harbor an examination of the local variations was made by occupying, in succession, a station on Manhattan, Governor's and Bedloe's islands, and at Sandy Hook: The other stations occupied in this section were at Albany, Greenbush, and New York city; at Cold Spring, opposite иwest Point; at Philadelphia; and at Cape May, New Jersey. Secondary triangulation.-For ihe purpose of making use of the moon culminations and occultations observed at Philadelphia for longitude, the Old and New High School Observatories have been connected with the Coast Survey triangulation points in their vicinity, (Sketch B.) The completion of this work in the early part of March devolved on Captain W. R. Palmer, U. S. Topographical Engineers, by the detachment of Captain T. J. Cram from Coast Survey service, and the results show that the measurements necessary in the connexion were made with great care. Captain Palmer refers, in his report on the completion of this work, to the acceptable services volunteered by Assistant George Davidson, then incidentally engaged in other duty at Phila~ delphia. The original and duplicate records of the work of connexion have been deposited in the office. In consequence of a change of location in the High School Observatory, involving the transfer aiid re-adjustment of the instruments employed, only a few moon culminations were observed during the present year. In this department the survey has lost the valuable services of Pro_ fessor E. Otis Kendall, by his attachment to the chair of mathematics in the University of Pennsylvania, which takes him from the High School. At the close of last season, Lieut. Comg. Maxwell Woodhull, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, made an intereating experiment on currents in the bay between Nantuck-et and

OF THE UNITED STATES OOAST SURVEY.

47

Cape May, which I have elsewhere called the Bay of the five States. It had been alleged that a current set inwards in this bay towards some part of Long Island. To test this crossiug from Nantucket to New York, current-bottles were thrown over from the schooner Gallatin, with requests on the labels contained within them that their finding should be reported to the Cua;;t 'Survey office. The information was circulated through the medium of the press as widely as was practicable. The bottles were thrown overboard between latitude 40░ 59' N. and longitude 71░ 03' W., and latitude 40░ 26~'N. and longitude 73░ 50~' vV., in the latter part of the month of October, 1854. None of them being heard of, I employed a careful person to search the south shore of Nantucket, and also had some search made on that of Martha's Vineyard, but the current-bottles were not found. It was concluded, therefore, as probable that the current was setting outward, and not inward, at that time, and that it had carried them into one of the branches of the Gulf Stream. Quite recently I received from Charles Bowen Jones, Esq., H. B. l\f. consul at the Azores, the only card which has yet been returned. This was picked up while floating on the bar at Santa Cruz, (Azores,) on the 13th of last June, and has been courteon~ly forwarded to me through the United States consul at the Western islands, Charles \V. Dabney, Esq. The bottle containing it was put over from the Gallatin, about four miles southeast of Sandy Hook, on the 30th of October, 1854. A copy of the card, as filled up and returned by J\Ir. Jones, . will be found in the Appendix No. 54.

SECTION III.-FROM CAPE HENLOPEN TO CAPE HENRY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF DELAWARE, MARYLAND, AND PART OF VIRGINIA. (SKETCH C.)
This is one of the sections of the survey which, from its early beginning and the manner in which it has been pushed, is the most forward. The primary triangulation is entirely complete, and the t>econdary on the ocean shore. The main body of the topography of the Chesapeake and the outer coast is done, and the remainder will be finished, with the present force applied, before the office can be ready for engraving it. There remains about thirteen months' work for one party near the lower part of the Chesapeake, and some eighteen months' on the outer coast of Maryland and Virginia. The triangulation of the rivers of Maryland, and of the Rappahannock, in Virginia, is done; that of the James river nearly done. The topography of rivers in Maryland is in general completed, and part of those in Virginia. The in-shore hydrography of the outer coast, and of the Chesapeake bay proper, is finished. There remains the off-shore work and parts of the rivers. In fact, this section has made greater proportionate progress than if the present plan of the survey had been earlier adopted, attempting to bring all the sections, as far as practicable, on the same line. Maps and charts have been drawn of Chesapeake bay, sheets Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and seacoast of Virginia, No. 2. The 1ast mentioned has been engraved, and the chart of the seacoast of Virginia and entrance to Chesapeake bay, with those of Chesapeake bay, 400\, 00 , and sheets Nos. 1 and 2, 80h 0 , are in progress. During the past year the following operations have been in progress, of which a detailed account will be found under the separate heads of the section: 1. Magnetic observations in connexion with those on the coast, or to determine the changes of the magnetic elements necessary to our charts. 2. The triangulation of the Rappahannock river has been ~ompleted. 3. That of the James river has been so nearly finished, that this winter or next spring, at furthest, it will be carried to the mouth of the river. 4. The verification of the topography on the shores of the Chesapeake has been in progress. 5. иThe topography of the lower part of the Chesapeake has been nearly completed. 6. The topography of the outer or ocean shore of the section has been also in progress. 'l. The topography of Rappahannock river has been carried forward with the hydrography. 8. Hydrogl'a.phy of verification has been executed in the lower pa.rt of Chesapeake bay, and sailing directions and li&ts of dangers prepared. и

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

9. The hydrography of Pocomoke sound, Chesapeake bay, has been completed. 10. The hydrography of James river has been in progress from near the mouth up the river. 11. The hydrography of the Rappahannock is well advanced towards completion. 12. The regular tidal observations have been kept up at Old Point Comfort, and others hav~ been made for river-tides in the Rappahannock and James rivers. 13. Views have been taken for the charts of the outer coast. Magnelio observations.-ln connexion with a series of stations in Sections I and II, observ~ tions were made during the present season for declination dip and horizontal intensity, at the magnetic observatory in the Smithsonian grounds, and also on Capitol hill, in Washington city, and at Causten station, Georgetown. These were conducted by Charles A. Schott, Esq., of the computing division, Coast Survey office, aided by Mr. J. Main, and the results obtained are presented in Appendix No. 49. , Secondary triangulation.-After making a careful reconnaissance in the early part of November of last year, the party of Captain W.R. Palmer, U.S. Topographical Engineers, assistant in the Coast SurYey, proceeded to measure a base of verification on the south side of the Rappahannock river, Virginia, (Sketch C.) The site selected is about five"miles below Tappahannock, and opposite to Accaceek Point. "The apparatus used in the measurement consisted of two four-metre rods of iron wire of the diameter of those employed in the measurement of the original base in April, 1853, about ten miles below Fredericksburg. The temperature of the rods was ascertained by means of_two thermometers, one being attached to each rod during the progress of the measurement. The rods were supported by four tripods, made of pine wood, and the deviations from a level were carefully determined by means of the sector." Captain Palmer completed the measurement on the 17th of November, and forwarded to the Coast Survey office the note-books containing the details of the operations, and a sketch of the vicinity. The length of the base, as determined in the computing division, is found to be 1639.8808 metres, or 1.019 statute miles. His report continues as follows: "The triangulation founded upon this base was, by the 6th of December, carried, by a series of five well-shaped triangles, to the line "Bowler - Folly" below, and up the Rappahannock to station" Jones - Carter," the termination of the work in the previous season, (see Sketch C.) This line, as determined in June, 1854, by the triangulation from the original base, measured 4069.69 metres, and by the triangulation founded on the base of verification, 4069.64." The difference, 0.05 of a metre, or less than two English inches, presents a highly satisfactory result, and.is strong evidence of the care taken in erecting proper secondary signals, and securing their verticality, in placing the theodolite accurately on the station points, and in the angular measures made in a series of sixty-nine triangles, of the correctness of which it furnishes a direct test. Captain Palmer resumed 6perations on the Rappahannock on the 22d of April, and by the 25th of June completed the triangulation of the river to its entrance into Chesapeake bay. The progress of the work during the season, as shown by the statisties, has been marked by the characteristic zeal, ability, and energy of that officer. Of the fifty stations established by him since the date of my last report, thirty-five were occupied; and on fifty-five objects, one hundred and fifty-eight angles were measured by two thousand three hundred and eight observations, with the six-inch Brunnerи theodolite, No. 60. The length of river-course included in the work of the season is about forty miles, and the area covered by the triangulation, eigbtyeight square miles. The whole length of the river, from Fredericksburg to the mouth, is about 108 miles. This distance was estimated by pilots and others, who accompanied Captain Palmer in his reconnaissance, at one hundred and :fifty-five miles, which Colonel Mansfield and himself, by estimate, reduced to one hundred and thirty. The erroneous estimates of distances, where there are no good maps, have entered into the estim.a.tea of the speed of vessels and 10

forth, mingling thus with many of the transactions of ordinary life, the scale of which they exaggerate. Lieutenant J. P. Roy, U.S. Army, assistant, was attached to this party, and his efficiency is JlrG}Jerly commended by Captain Palmer, who acknowledges also the services of l\Ir. P. C. F. vVest, temporarily attached to the party as aid. The party had the use of the schooner Bancroft for transportation. Having secured and marked the numerous station points usecl in the season, Captain Palmer returned to the office, and has deposited there the records of the work, original and duplicate, together with sketches and descriptions of the signals. Captain Palmer takes occasion to rectify an omission in his reconnaissance report of 1853, which, though he harl almost immediately corrected in a letter, had escaped my attention until it was recalled by A. G. Grinnon, Esq., of Madison C. H., Virginia. The fact as it should stand is, that on the Rappahannock rock occurs, (a secondary sandstone overlying the granite at Falmouth,) and extends se,иeral miles down the river to the days. This fact may be a very important one in reference to the improvement of the river. Captain Palmer is at present engaged in charge of the Coast Survey office, during the temporary absence of Captain Benham, of the corps of engineers. I had intended to assign to him the execution of a large triangulation as a mark of my appreciation of his merit and capacity, as shown on the Rappahannock, but the duty in which he is now engaged claimed precedence of the other. While in Philadelphia, engaged in completing his work of the autumn, Captain Palmer completed, in March last, the work of connecting the ol<l High School Observatory with the new one, and with the. general triangulation of the survey, which had been commenced by Captain Cram, U. S. Topographical Engineers, just before he was relieved from the Coast Survey. The triangulation of the James river, Virginia, below City Point, in charge of Assistant John Farley, was in progress at the date of my last annual report, and has been proi;;ecuted in the usual manner, the work being suspended during winter only in consequence of the frequent impediments from ice and bad weather, and after midsummer and in the early part of the autumn by reason of the unfavorable nature of the season for field duty. Beginning on the 15th of October at City Point, the junction of the triangulation of the A11pomattox river from Petersburg, and that of the James river from Richmond, the work of the main stream was advanced as far west as \Vestover west base by the 25th of December. The intervening time, previous to resuming the triangulation in the middle of April, was employed by Assistant Farley in revising the computation&" of his work of last season, including those requisite for the comparison of the two bases at Richmond and Petersburg, the rt.Jsults of which show a very close agreement between their measured and computed lengths. Field operations were continued until the 3d of July, at which time the work had reached a station twenty-two miles below City Point. (Sketch C.) Twenty-two stations were occupied in a series of twenty-six triangles, all the angles of which were measured by two thousand two hundred and twenty-two observations with the six-inch Brunner theodolite, No. 66. The area comprised in the triangulation below City Point is about twenty-three square miles. The difficulties presented by the sinuous character of the James river have been successfully met by the experience and resources of Assistant Farley; and, under favorable circumstances, it is probable that the triangulation may be extended, during the present autumn, or certainly in t~e early part of the spring and summer, to the mouth of the river, so as to form a connection with the main work on Chesapeake bay. In this duty he is now engaged, having been employed during the summer in the computations of his work of the present season. One of the essential conditions of a successful tertiary, or of a secondary triangulation with small sides, is that the signal-poles shall be straight, of proper shape, and truly vertical-the neglect of which frequently involves much expense and labor. A very neat arrangement for a

1

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

secondary signal, stand, and pole, has been made by Assistant Farley, and his description and drawing are given in the Appendix No. 58, and on Plate No. 52. Topography.-Assistant H. L. Whiting was engaged, at the date of my last annual report, in the revision and verification of topography at Bodkin Point, and on the north and south shore of the mouth of Sassafras river, Chesapeake bay, (Sketch C.) This duty was completed on the 18th of December. Succeeding operations of a similar character will be referred to under Section VI. On his return from Florida, at the close of April, Assistaht Whiting resumed and continued the work of verification on South river, and at the mouth of Magothy river, Chesapeake bay, (Sketch C,) until the beginning of June, and was subsequently engaged in topographical surveys in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, as mentioned under Section I. His topographical sheet of Sassafras River entrance, Maryland, Cnrh-0 ,) has been received at the office. The topography of the western shore of Chesapeake bay, from Back river northward, and including part of York river, has been executed by the party of Assistant John Seib. This work is embraced in plane-table sheets No. 62 and No. 63, which are now complete.-(Sketch 0.) The survey of the present year includes Bennet's creek, Pocosin river, Cheesman's creek, Back creek, part of York river, and several small creeks and water-courses, (Sketch C.) On the southern shore of York river, the topography has been carried from the main shore of Chesapeake bay to within three and a half miles of Yorktown. Assistant Seib commenced work on the 22d of June, (after his return from Section V,) and closed operations on the 4th of August. The Coast Survey schooner Wave was in the service of his party. The completed topograp1iical sheets present the following statistics for the present season: Shore-line surveyed.................................................................. 58 miles. Roads surveyed........................................................................ 23} " Area surveyed......................................................................... 21! " The country over which these sheets extend is thus described by Mr. Seib: "The land is low and almost level; it rises a little, and gradually as it recedes from the shore of the Chesapeake bay. Along the latter are extensive marshes, and in and beyond them patches of pine woods, with a few small farms. Along the rivers, creeks, and roads, it .is thickly settled, and between them are large bodies of woods, mostly of pine ; at some distance from the bay there are fine oaks, gum, chestnut, &c." This party resumed the topography of the Rappahannock river, and continued it until the progress of the season rendered it advisable to return to Section V. Between the 10th and 26th of October he was engaged in the revision of shore-line of the Rappahannock river, furnished by the hydrographic party, and joining his own previous work, and from that time until the 16th of November pursued the regular topographical survey of the shores of that river below .Accaceek Point, (Sketch 0,) carrying the work as far as stations '' Punch Bowl - Doicnman.'' The length of river course included in his two sheets is twelve miles and a half. One of the sheets has been completed, and the other is very nearly so. Together they include about thirty-three miles of shore-line. The devotion of this able topographer to his work is shown by his constant presence in the field, changing the locality and section to suit the season for working. The topography of the sea-coast of Virginia from Watson station, on Metomkin ba.y, to a point opposite to the east end of Wallop's island and mouth of Chincoteague inlet, was executed between the middle of July and the 26th of August by the party of Assistant George D. Wise, subsequent to his return from duty in Section VII. The details furnished by the survey of the present season complete the sheet of that vicinity commenced by Sub-Assistant W. M. Johnson, (Sketch C.) These include thirteen miles of shore-line and thirty-one miles of road within an area of fifteen square miles.

51

Bub-Assistant Spencer C. McCorkle was engaged during the progress of this work in the party of Assistant Wise. The topographical sheet extending from Gargathy station to Wachapreague inlet was received at the office in December, and Assistant Wise reports the probable completion of another before his return to duty in Section VII, for which he is now under instructions. Hydrography.-Lieut. Comg . .Richard Wainwright, U. 8. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, in command of the surveying schooner Nautilus, has continued the finished hydrography of Rappahannock river from Green's bay, the limit of the previous season, to a point five miles below Tappahannock, the termination of the triangulation of last year, (Sketch C.) The extent of river course embraced in the soundings of the present season is about thirty-six miles. This work, as heretofore mentioned, was undertaken and is prosecuted at the request of the Engineer Department. Lieut. Comg. Wainwright makes special mention of the services of Mr. A. Strausz, attached to his party as draughtsman, in the prompt and accurate determination of the shore-line requisite in the hydrographic work. The details of the season are as follows : Miles of sounding run ............................................................. .. 298 Casts of the lead ..................................................................... . 32,569 Angles observed (in hydrography) ............................................. . 2,096 Stations occupied with theodolite ................................................ . 50 Miles of shore-line surveyed ...................................................... . 65 Six tidal stations were occupied below Leedstown in April and May, at which over three thousand observations were recorded. At the end of March Lieut. Comg. Wainwright turned into the office his hydrographic sheets Nos. 4, 5, 6, (., 0\ 0 ) and sheets Nos. 7', 8, (10-iroo) of Rappahannock river. During the summer and autumn he was engaged in the hydrography of the Hudson river and the dependencies of New York bay, as noticed under Section II, and will shortly resume work on the Rappahannock. Some particulars of interest in regard to the bars of that river are contained in a list given by Lieut. Comg. Wainwright. (Appendix No. 14.) The hydrography of the James river, Virginia, from Deep Water Point light-house to a point opposite to Jamestown island, has been executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, (Sketch C.) This work was prosecuted with great energy after the return of the hydrographic party from the Atlantic coast, south of Charleston, the necessary preliminary triangulation of the river being executed personally by Lieutenant Maffitt. The shore-line was also determined by the party throughout an extent of twenty-eight miles, embraced in the hydrography. The number of angles observed was eighteen hundred, and the number determined two hundred and seventy-seven. Work was discontinued at the end of August in consequence of sickness on board the schooner Crawford, employed in the operations. The statistics of this survey areNumber of miles run in sounding............................................. 1,081.5 Whole number of soundings................................................... 39,464 Observations were made at two tidal and at five current stations within the limits before mentioned. The cha.rt of J a.mes river on sea.le 20 i 0 0 , in two parts, has been drawn and sent to the office by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt. The hydrography of the outer coast of this section, and of the Chesapeake bay proper, was completed last year by the party of Lieut. Comg. Almy, whose work in continuation lies in Section IV, where the details will be found. At the opening of the present sea.son, he revised and verified the soundings upon important sheets of work executed in the lower part of the

bay, and prepared sailing directions, lists of dangers, &c., for the charts of this part of the bay and of its entrnm:e. The boiler of the steamer Hetzel) assigned to this imrty,иexploded on the 24th of .August, causing the death of several of the party, and seriously injuring the vessel. The steamer was employed, at the time, to furnish trans11ortation to Captain Gibson, U. S. Army, assistant in the Coast Survey, who was to take the views rer1uired of the chart for the sea-coast of Maryland and Virginia north of the Chesapeake entrance. She was at Sand Shoal inlet, under what was supposed to be easy steam, when the port boiler burst. Third Assistant Engineer Samuel C. Latimer, e. S. ~avy, "'\Villiam Bulger, fin;t-class fireman, and Bernard Moran, seaman, were killed on the spot; and 'William Gardner, first-class fireman, John T. Knight, secondclass fireman, and Michael Scanlan, ordinary seaman, were fatally injured, so that they died in spite of the care and attention of Assistant Surgeon Williamson, U. K Navy, who was in attendance upon them. Benjamin Yan Horn, second-class fireman, David E. Marshall, quartermaster, and Coleman vV elsh, ordinary seaman, were seriously injured. The report of this melancholy disaster, as given by Lieut. Corng. Almy, is in the Appendix No. 66. The vessel took fire and was thought t) be sinking; but the fire was checked, the leak stopped, and she was finally towed to Hampton roads, and thence to Baltimore. .An inquiry into the cause of the explosion has been made, and a re11mt is soon expected of the extent of injury to the Yessel and machinery, ancl the cost of repairs, should it be deemed expedient to put her again in commission. 'l'he Hetzel is a serviceable vessel, being of light draught; and though her power is but moderate, it has been adequate to the work in and near Chesapeake bay, in which she has been employed.' In order to enalilc I,ieut. Oomg. Almy to execute the hydrography of Pocomoke sound, Chesapeake bay, which formed a part of his instructions for the season, the party was transferred to the Coast Survey schooner Varina, which had just returned from the Florida coast, under command of Lieut. Comg. 0. H. Berryman. This officer promptly made the arrangements necessary to give to Lieut. Comg. Almy the use of the Varina, occupying himself the wreck of the Hetzel as an office to bring up his work. The work in Pocomoke sound was completed by Lieut. Comg. Almy, notwithstanding the disadvantages arising from the necessity of transferring his party to another vessel, and the unusually boisterous character of the latter part of the season. The limits of the work on the westward extend to a line passing southward from Fog island to иwatt's island, and thence to Scott's Hall, on the Virginia shore of Chesapeake bay, (Sketch C.) "The configuration of the bottom of this sound is such, having a river channel with several creek branches and :fiats, that the lines of soundings required to be run closely. In executing this part of the season's work, 401 nautical miles were run in sounding, and the whole number of soundings made was 16,330. Nine hundred 11nd twenty-one angles were taken by the theodolite, and eight hundred and two hy sextants, for hydrographic positions. Nineteen high tides, and twenty-one low tides, were observed. The whole number of tidal observations recorded was seven hundred and three." The hydrography of Tangier sound, included in the instructions for the present year, was unavoidably postponed in consequence of delay arising from the disaster to the steamer Hetzel, already referred to. Lieut. Comg. Almy has turned into the office during the past year the following charts: Mobjack bay to Cape Henry, Virginia................................................................ Toiazy Hampton Roads and part of Elizabeth river to Fort Norfolk.................................... 20-& 00 Norfolk harbor, Virginia ................................................................................. 10000 Lynn Haven Roads, Virginia ................. ., ........................................................ . As referred to in previous reports, the continued operations of this party in the vicinity of numerous shoals and dangers has afforded occasion to render important incidental services to vessels navigating the lower part of Chesapeake bay. Three instances of thii kind have occurred within the present season. The schooners Jane Brindk. and JJavid a~и ha.viag grounded on Hampton bar, and the schooner ArM on Willoughby's bank, were worked otf by

53

parties of officers and men from the Hetzel. The Arno had hoisted signals of distress, and was relieved with considerable difficulty and some delay. Lieut. Comg. Almy remarks in reference to these and other cases: "It is often in my power, aml I deem it my duty, to go to the relief of vessels in danger when I can do so consistently with the discharge of other duties LI.evolved upon me." A report from Lieut. Comg. Almy relating to a light-house on "York Spit," Chesapeake bay, will be found in the Appendix No. 71. Tides.-The usual tide observations, with the Saxton self-registering gauge, have been made at Old Point Comfort. '1.1hese are returned monthly to the office, read off there from the autographic sheets, and reduced by the tidal party under charge of L. F. Pourtales, Esq. Observations for river tides have been made by the parties of Lieut. Oomg. '\Vainwright in the Rappahannock river, and Lieut. Comg. Maffitt in the James river; six statiom having been occupied by the former, and two by the latter party. The attempts hitherto made to erect a gauge near Cape Henry, for comparison with that at Old Point Comfort, and for testing the correctness of the reduction by depth from one point to the other, have not been successful. The tides of the Chesapeake, which present very interesting problems, will be investigated. Views.-Captain A. A. Gibson, U. S. A., was instructed to join Lieut. Comg. Almy in August, and to go with him to such points as were suitable for taking the views required for the charts of the ocean shores of this section, and had in fact accomplished this duty, having taken the 8ketches, when the steamer Hetzel, which had conveyed him to the loca1ities, was disabled by the bursting of one of her boilers, as already narrated. 'fhe letter of Captain Gibson, announcing this disa5ter, and written at the request of Lieut. Comg. Almy, is given in the Appendix No. 66.
Gt'LF STREAM.

My instructions of last year had providecl for quite a considerable amount of incidental work to be done in the Gulf Stream by our hydrographic vessels in passing ~outh and north, to and from th~ southern sections; but storms and other circumstances prevented their execution. The information which has now been collected, and which has resulted in the chart of the Gulf Stream already published, should serve as the basis for new inquiries. The tracing of the range of hills beyond the axis of the Gulf Stream by Lieut. Comg. Sands, in the steamer Walker, is an example of the successful application of this knowledge to work out a result, and the zeal shown by him in the prosecution of the work, seconded by his skill in selecting his positions, lias been amply rewarded by the most interesting results. Direct observations in the continuation of the plan of making sections across the stream have also been made by Lieut. Comg. Craven, near Cape Florida, and by Lieut. Comg. Sands, southeast from Nantucket. 1. In passing from the Gulf of Mexico northward, Lieut. Comg. Sands, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, ran a line of deep-sea soundings, and for temperatures through the Florida channel, and as far north as Hatteras, (Sketch No. 17.) In a general way, the results may be stated as follows, though, when we come to analyze them, it will be found that the general statement requires some limitations, that, folkwing nearly the course of tlie Gulf Stream (see Sketch No. 15, Coast Survey Report, 1853, or No. 24, Coast Survey Report, 1854)from a point southward of the Pine islands, (Florida keys,) in latitude 24░ 23' N. and longitude 81░ 23' W., he kept soundings until off Cape Lookout, in latitude 33o 57' N. and longitude 75░ 361 W. No measured depth exceeded five hundred and seventy fathoms, which probably corresponds to about four hundred fathoms of actual depth. The nearest approach to the land off the Florida peninsula was about twenty-two miles, south of Jupiter inlet; and the di.stance off Gape Lookout was about sixty miles (nautical.)

54

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

If we trace the stations as they follow each other by the Gulf Stream chart of 1854, we shall find, beginning off Cape Canaveral, (Position 8,) that Lieut. Comg. Sands was on the outer edge of the axis band of the Gulf Stream, where he found the depth four hundred and ten fathoms, the position corresponding with the range of hills discovered by Lieuts. Craven and Maffitt; that Positions IJ and 10 followccl the same edge, (giving the same depth, four hundred and ten fathoms,) and 11 inclined more to the westward, or towards the axis of the strea:хi, (giving five hundred and fifteen fathoms for the depth.) The Positions 12, 13, 14, and 15 are nearly in the axis of the Gulf Stream, the depths measured being five hundred and thirty, five hundred and ten, no bottom at four hundred and forty, and five hundred and sixty fathoms. Position 15 is just north of the St. Simon's section, and corresponds nearly with one of Lieut. Comg. Craven's positions of1854. Lieut. Craven determined the depth; .with the Massey log, to be four hundred fathoms; Lieut. Comg. Sands, with the ordinary line, five hundred and sixty fathoms, giving about the same proportion which Lieut. Comg. Craven had previously found, under corresponding circumstances of depth and current, for the two methods. Position 16 is off the axis of the stream, and to the east of it; the depth is five hundred and seventy fathoms. This is on the Charlest.on section, as run by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, in 1853, and falls near two of his stations, at one of which the depth was determined by the sounding-line, as between three hundred and four hundred fathoms, and the other, where no bottom was found, at six hundred fathoms. This position is not far enough east for the top of the hill-range struck by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt. Position 17 is nearly on Lieut. Comg. Craven' s Charleston section of и1853, and lies near one position at which he found bottom at four hundred and eighty fathoms, and another no bottom at five hundred fathoms. Lieut. Comg. Sands found no bottom at five hundred and seventy fathoms, the line parting. Position 18 is near the inner or western edge of the hottest or axis band of the stream. The depth found was five hundred fathoms, falling on the Cape Fear section, between two stations of Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, at one of which the depth was seventy fathoms, and at the other no bottom was found in six hundred fathoms. Between 16 and 18 the axis of the Gulf Stream had been crossed, 19 is on the edge of the cold-wall band, 20 is in that band, and 21 in the cold water near the shore. The depths measured were respectively four hundred, four hundred and thirty, (uncertain,) and twenty-three fathoms. To resume, the Gulf Stream chart indicates that soundings were struck on the outer edge of the hottest band of the Gulf Stream ; that they were carried along that edge, inclining to the westward or towards the axis ; then nearly along the axis, inclining from it ; then crossing it to the westward into the cold-wall band, and crossing this to the cold water near the shore. This supposes the chart to represent correctly the course and division of the Gulf Stream, requiring that these phenomena should be the same as in former years, and that the chart should correctly represent the former observations. The soundings for temperature having been taken at different depths, we a're enabled, from former deductions, to know to what parts of the stream the curves representing the changes of temperature with depth apply. From these comparisons, independently, I would infer that Position 8 was outside of the axis; 9 and 10 outside, but near it; 12 outside, and 13 inside; 15 and 16 on it; 18, 19, and 20 inside of it, near the cold wall, 19 being nearer than the other to the middle of that band. The deepest temperatures not being numerous, and being sometimes quite discrepant, makes this comparison less valuable that it would otherwise be. The difficulty referred to, arises from the liability of jarring the lower thermometer when the lead strikes the bottom ; in which case the indication of the instrument is sometimes affected, even when, as will sometimes happen, the thermometer itself does not also strike. I have omitted the positions when there were not deep-sea temperatures to check those niiarer the surface. These deductions would require no change in the axis, as represented on the diagram of 1854, between Canaveral and Charleston. Either of the diagrams represents the case within the probable limitsoi' error of position and observation.

The question of the limit of this range of hills still remains undetermined from these observations, for the line broke at Position 1'i, which is the last limit heretofore established of the range; and the next position is so much inshore, as to make it doubtful whether it is not on the inner slope towards the land. The surface temperatures, and those at fifteen fathoms, agree with the deductions which have just been made. That these were in part affected by the temperature of the air is obvious; but that the greater part of their change is not due to this, but to different positions with respect to the axis, is all plain from examination. The surface temperatures taken in the hot band were from 83░ to 81! ░ Fahrenheit ; those at fifteen fathoms, from 82░ to 78i 0 и The lowest temperature, twenty fathoms from the bottom, observed beneath the warm band, was at Position 6, off Cape Florida; at five hundred fathoms, 49░ Fahrenheit. From this point the temperatures increased in passing northward, to 60░, 59░, and 54░, at the depths of five hundred and ten, five hundred and forty, and five hundred and fifty fathoms, in Positions 12, 15, and 16, from the latitude of St. Augustine to that of Tybee. The surface temperatures of those observations taken in June, 1855, are some two degrees higher than in corresponding localities in the same month of 1853. 2. A very interesting section of the Gulf Stream was made by Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, across from Cape Florida light, eastward, to Bernini, (Sketch No. 1'7 ,) carrying soundings with a depth not exceeding three hundred and seventy fathoms the whole way across. The section was run in the month of April. The highest surface temperature was 80░ Fahrenheit, and the lowest temperature observed, corresponding to the greatest depth, 34░ Fahrenheit, or within two degrees of the freezing-point of fresh water. The curves of temperature with depth in this comparatively shallow pass, pre8ent quite a new feature, or rather an exaggeration of the former curve, representing a movement and not an equilibrium of temperature. The following statistics of his Gulf Stream work are reported by Lieut. Comg. Craven: Positions made..................................................................... 12 Greatest depth on section........................................................ 370 fathoms. 34░ Fahrenheit.

Is length is such (see chart in report of 1854) that bad weather, or accident to the vessel or instruments, is very liable to occur before the section is crossed. It was attempted last year by Lieut. Comg. Craven, and this year by Lieut. Comg. Sands, who, in October, reached some forty miles east of the position of Lieut. Comg. Craven, marked on the chart of 1854. J have still the hope that a second attempt by this officer may be more successful than the first, in which the stormy weather, and expenditure of fuel carried, prevented progress across the stream. Professor Bailey, of the Military Academy, West Point, has devoted such time as he could spare from the arduous labors of his professorship, to the examination of the organisms to be found in the soundings along the coast. An interesting communication from him relative to a cursory examination made of specimens from the Florida section will be found in Appendix No. 55. SECTION IV.-FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING PART OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. (SKETCH D.) This section is one which has in past years made comparatively considerable progress, and which, therefore, had not needed prtlssing. The peculiarities of the survey in it are many, but Well understood 1 and will gradually be provided for. The small ocean-E<hore triangulation now

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

extends from within eleven miles of Cape Henry, where it will join the Chesapeake work, to within forty miles of New inlet, where it will meet that of the Cape Fear. It serves as a reconnaissance for the main work, determining, from the minute knowledge acquired in the course of its execution, and of that of the hydrography which follows it, the character and circumstances of the larger triangulation. Meanwhile it furnishes hydrographic points and shore-line, which have been used for the survey of the shoals, inlets, and harbors, of this most dangerous portiи;m of our coast, which have in turn been taken up, and, with a few exceptions, disposed of for the present. The Wimble shoals, Hatteras shoals, the Frying Pan and Cape Fear shoals, have been surveyed ; Hatteras and Ocracoke inlets, Hatteras cove, Beaufort and Cape Fear harbors, have been thoroughly surveyed, and their changes carefully watched. The whole of Albemarle sound has been covered by a lWimary and secondary triangulation, and. its topography and hydrograpby have been executed. The sounds from Pamplico southward have been covered by triangulation and topography, including Core sound, Beaufort harbor, Bogue sound, and others south of it, to below New river. A reconnaissance of Pamplico sound and its tributary rivers has been made, by which we know exactly the nature of the work necessary there, and as soon as a main triangulation party is disposable it will be ordered ; the expense of the small work ceasing in one to two years more. Great care has been taken to preserve all the station points not absolutely in movable sands, an<l to provide means for the recovery of those which may be lost from causes only controllable at too great expense. The steady prosecution of the plan of work in this section is all that is necessary to bring its results out even earlier than' that of the other sections, as it wi!s begun early, and more than half of it presents but moderate difficulties of execution. The steam-vessel which has heretofore been devoted to Section III is available for this section, and should be repaired for the purpose, or another be furnished in her place, so that thtl regular coast hydrography may keep onward. Thill year it has advanced from Cape Henry to the North Carolina line, a distance of thirty-six miles, in part of a season. The explosion which crippled the Hetzel toward8 the close of the season is noticed under the head of Section III. It may be proper to remark here, that when the land-work of a coast like this is once completed, the hydrography may be repeated at intervals at a very slight expense. The points becoming known when the sands shift, re-surveys are not only useful in determining the actual condition of thingA, but in furnishing data to the engineer for tracing effects to causes, and thus for engineering knowledge necessary to enable him to control and modify the forces of nature. I have already pointed out, in previous reports, that this coast is in a dangerous condition of destruction by the ocean ; the sands which protect Albemarle and Pamplico sounds from the invasion of the ocean, being carried away year by year and deposited on the shoals. The small triangulation at the northern end of this section will require one, and perhaps two, seasons to reach Cape Henry, and that at the south end one and a part of another to reach the Cape Fear. The work will then be continuous along the whole ocean-shore of the section. Meanwhile, the other operations necessary to complete the hnd...work will be in progress, and the regular outside hydrography will be advancing. I expect, also, that the appropriation may permit work in Pamplico sound, and the rivers emptying into it. Preparations have been made to avail ourselves of the new telegraph line between Wilmington, N. C., and Charleston, S. C., to connect those two points for difference of longitude directly, which have heretofore been connected through Raleigh, thus checking the former work between Washington and Columbia. De Rosset station, at Wilmington, and the State-House station at Columbia, which have been kept standing, will afford ready means for this purpose. The following charts relating to this section have been published: Pasquotank river 1rn i ilo> 1850; Beaufort harbor 20l 00 , 1851; Frying-Pan shoals n-ifpoo, 1851; New river ancl bar T"doo, 1852; Ocracoke inlet 10}o 0 , 1853; and Beaufort harbor, preliminary chart, 1854.

Preliminary chart of Albemarle sound ; map of Cape Fear river, upper and lower sheets; and Beaufort harbor, on steel, as a finished chart. Triangulation.-The triangulation joining the Chesapeake and Currituck sound has baffied all calculations as to the time of its execution, 1mrtly from the difficulties of the work, and partly from the loss of station-points and the necessity for remeasuring angles, and other causes. It is not certain that even another season may not be required to complete it. In the mean time, points have been determined approximately on the ocean shore for the use of the hydrographic party. Assistant J. J. S. Hassler, under whose charge this work has been, reports for the last season's work ten stations determined and five re-determined, eighteen hydrographic signals placed, two thousand and sixteen observations made, and an extent of ocean coast of fourteen miles, bordering the area of twenty-eight miles included. The part of the sound in which they were at work being too shoal to use the schooner Vanderbilt for transportation, the party suffered a good deal from exposure to the inclemency of the winter in open boats and flats. The northern limit of the work is at Bonny Signal, (see Sketch D,) about eleven miles only south of Cape Henry. On completing the inking of his topographical work in Section I, Assistant A. S. иwadsworth resumed the triangulation of the outer coast of North Carolina, between Bogue sound and Stump sound, (see Sketch D,) commencing at the line Pickett - Plum-Orchard in the former sound, and reaching the line Skeleton - l\facawber in the latter, about three miles south of New river, at the close of the season, extending twenty-five miles along the coast, and covering thirty square miles. Forty-five stations were occupied, forty-nine points observed upon, and one hundred and forty angles measured, by 5,022 observations with a six-inch Gambey theodolite, (C. S. No. 27.) The points along the beach of this triangulation are all available for the hydrography, and are quite numerous. Mr. Wadsworth reports, that should it be necessary to resort to a small main triangulation in this region, there will be no difficulty in measuring short bases at any desirable points; that along the beach there will be no cutting required; that signals may be placed where most convenient for the work ; and that the wood, within such limits as the triangulation would be likely to cover, is oflittle value. The winter season is reported by the parties on this part of the coast to have been unusually severe; and this, together with the difficulties of transportation, retarded the work. Mr. H. S. Duval served as aid in this party, assisting in part in measuring the angles. Assistant Wadsworth, after his return, was on duty in my party in Section I, and subsequently engaged in topographical work for the Commissioners on New York harbor, as mentioned under Section II. The topography, which has usually been combined with the triangulation by Mr. Wadsworth, Was omitted this year and the last, with a view earlier to close upon the Cape Fear triangulation. It will be resumed by a second party in the coming season. The work of Assistant Bolles, south of the Cape Fear, belongs properly to Section V, in which it will be found detailed . .Hydrography.-The regular hydrography of the section has been executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. J. J. Almy. U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Hetzel. The Sketch D shows the limits of the work, which are Cape Henry on the north, and the boundary between the States of Virginia and North Carolina (in latitude 36░ 31' N.) on the so~th-" a sea-coast ex.tent of twenty-six miles, and extending seaward from sixteen to twenty miles .и This comprises an area of three hundred and fifty square miles. "In executing this, six hundred and nineteen nautical miles have been run in sounding; five thousand four hundred and ninety-one soundings have been taken in from three to thirteen fathoms water. The number of angles ta.ken by theodolites for hydrographic positions is one thousand and forty-nine, and the number taken by sextants for the same purpose is 8

58

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

seven hundred and seventy-five. The number of tides observed is twenty-six high tides and thirty-four low tides, and the number of tidal observations is five hundred and seventy." By referring to Sketcl1es C and D, it will be seen that the hydrography of the entire sea-coast of Virginia, about one hundred and five statute miles in extent in chord lines, is completed. 'l'his was commenced by Lieut. Comg. Almy in 1851, and has been carried forward with steady perseverance. During the same period he has done a very large share of hydrography in the Chesapeake bay, selecting, generally, for its execution those portions of the seasons unfit for outside work. The work of this party in the Chesapeake and outside, in Section III, will be found mentioned under the head of that section. On his way from the coast of South Carolina to the James river, Lieut. Comg. Maffitt examined the channels at the main entrance to the Cape Fear, and also.New inlet, (see Sketch D.) It is known that the shifting sands of the Cape Fear and New inlet bars cause frequent variations in the depths, according to the prevalence of particular winds and their degree of violence, so that at different seasons of the year and in different years the channels change their comparative depths. When Lieut. Comg. Maffitt made his examination, in June, the main ship-channel had two feet and three-tenths less water in it than when surveyed by him in 1853, while the western channel had become the main entrance, having two feet more water in it than in October, 1853. New Inlet bar, in like manner, had shoaled nearly two feet. The positions of the new channel beacons at Beaufort, N. C., were determined by tile same party. Sketches of these different determinations have been furnished to t;1e office. In these detached works there were:

SECTION V.-FROM CAPE FEAR TO THE ST. MARY'S RIVER, INCLUDING THE
COAST OF THE STATES OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.
(SKEJlCH

E.)

Along the coast of this section we have made good advances since the survey was commenced in 1848, on a scale so small that at first it appeared to make almost no progress. We have gained, too, much experience, and know how to appreciate better both the difficulties and facilities. While the harbors and shoals have received our first attention, and have been examined without waiting for tbe regular progress of the work from end to end of the section, that regular progress has been kept steadily in view. While some of the easier portions of the work have been done, we have not avoided the difficult parts, but have plodded slowly through them, studying meanwhile how such work may be better and morerapidlydone hereafter. As the appropriations have been increased, and the sections begun before this have not required so much, additional resources have been laid out upon this section. Many special surveys have also been made for the Engineer Department, which will ultimately be woven into the general survey of the coast. I will rapidly pas~ in review the work done. Charleston harbor and its approaches has been carefully surveyed, the bar sounded out twice, and Ma.ffitt's channel three several times. These surveys were at once made the bases of the proposed ~mprovement of the harbor by the city of Charleston and by the United States. A preliminary ,chart haB been puhlished, and the finished map is in progress of engraving. Sever&l compara-

tive sketchel'! of Maffitt's channel have been published. Tybee entrance and approaches and the Savanna'b. river have been surveyed above the city to the head of Argyle island. The maps of these surveys were used by the Commission on the improvement of the river. A preliminary sketch has been published, and the finished map is in progress. A base line has been measured on Edisto island, and the triangulation carried from it northward and eastward tu Long island, S. C., and southward and westward to the Hunting islands. In connection with this, the topography has covered about two-thirds of the same space, and the hydrography of the ocean coast has been nearly completed between Charleston and North Edisto. Two harbors of refuge, Bull's bay on the north, and North Edisto on the south, have been surveyed, and charts of them published. The information thu~ obtained has also induced appropriations for lighting them, so as to enable ves~els driven either to the eastward or westward of Charleston to find a refuge either by night or day. Port Royal entrance, and the shoal off it, known as Martin's Industry, have been examined, and a sketch of the reconnaissance, extending to Beaufort harbor, is in progress. The approaches to Tybee entrance-namely, Calibogue sound on the north, and the opposite shore of Savannah river to the south-have been triangulated: and the survey of Romerly marshes made complete in reference to a cut proposed through them. Winyah bay and Georgetown harbor have been surveyed, and the Roman shoals to the south of it. A general reconnaissance has been carried along the coast of the section, including a recent one from the Cape Fear to Charleston, and the triangulation and topography have made progress over the reconnaissance from the Cape Fear south to I,ockwood's Folly. A hydrographic reconnaissance of Doboy inlet, and of Altamaha river to Darien, has been made. The triangulation of St. Simon's sound and Brunswick river ism progress. A hydrographic reconnaissance of St. Andrew's sound has been made. A triangulation of Cumberland sound is in progress, upon which a hydrographic reconnaissance has been based. These detached pieces of work embrace more than three-fourths of the most important points on the coast, and attention has been directed to them in their intrinsic order of importance, or that which circumstances gave to them. The preliminary bases upon which these surveys rest have been measured by rods duly compared at the Coast Survey office, and the work forms part of the general coast series; each fragment falling into its appropriate place in the whole survey. The tides have been investigated by numerous stations along this reach of coast, and the results have been worked up and published in tide-tables, and in the form of co-tidal lines on a chart. The magnetic elements have been determined at various points, including the stations of the primary triangulation and points in the harbors. The latitudes and azimuths necessary to constitute a geodetic work have been attended to, and the differences of longitude, for which the telegraph has afforded such admirable means, have been determined for the long reaches over which the lines extend. In this way Charleston and Savannah have been connected with Washington city, and thus with the central longitude station of the Coast Survey, and with each other. During the past year the survey of this section has made even more than usual advance, in all its branche11, as the detailed account of the operations under the several heads of longitude determination, primary and secondary triangulation, topography, hydrography, and tides, will fully show. The hurricane of September, 1854, which raged so fearfully along the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, made, no doubt, many changes in it. The destructive action on Sullivan's island, Charleston harbor, led to the not unreasonable supposition that Maffitt's channel might also have been affected by it. In 1851 the Moultrie house stood about one hundred and twenty-seven yards from high-water mark, and in March, 1855, but thirty-six yards. Such a remarkable change attracted attention immediately after the storm, and I directed Lieut. Comg. Maffitt to make as early a re-examination of the channel as practicable. This was done in March, 1855, giving the gratifying evidence of an improvement on the bulk-head of the channel. (See Sketch No. 20.) In a recent letter (see Appendix No. 15) on the comparative .nap, showing

60

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

the results of different surveys of this channel between 1851 and 1855, Lieut. Comg. Maffitt remarks: "The chart of 1855 shows a general increase of depth upon the bulk-head, and a contraction of eighteen yards in the general width of the channel. Bowman'sjettee has settled about one foot and fifty-six hundredths, the result of which has been to increase, by twenty-eight minutes, the duration of the flow of ebb-tide over the jettee, with an increased velocity of half a k.not per hour directly through the channel. The benefit of this is, no doubt, made manifest by иthe general increase of water over the bulk-head. The high-water mark along the shore of Sullivan's island is now three hundred and twenty yards more to the northward than in 1852. The necessity for small jettees along this shore, for its general protection, is a subject for consideration.''

"The general increase of depth on bulk-head, from 1852 to 1855, is four and a half feet. "The above table gives striking evidence in favor of the adaptation of this channel for improvement. It will be observed that there is an improved condition of the channel, from chart to chart, and that the scrutiny of five years has, as yet, developed nothing but a flattering progression, encouraging the laudable enterprise." A re-examination of the main ship-channel of Charleston harbor was made in March, in consequence of alleged changes. Upon this subject I give an extract from Lieut. Comg. Maffitt's report: "A re-examination of the main ship-channel of Charleston bar gave evidence of some considerable change since the survey of 1851. The channel has made to the southward, since that time, some forty yards; and also, at the period of this last investigation, (March 8th and 9th, 1855,) had deepened in the general channel-way about .95, or nearly one foot. "I question the continued improvement or present permanency of this bettered condition of the main ship-channel. Its position, in reference to the dredging influence of the tidal-currents, of ebb and flood, is such as to insure a certain normal depth, influenced, at times, by heavy gales-some deepening it, and others having the reverse influence. The Coast Survey chart probably presents the normal depth that will, as a rule, be found in this channel at mean low water, as the original soundings of 1849 do not differ materially from those of 185-0 and 1851." At the time of this survey the buoys were found to be placed in the best water. The survey of Romerly marshes, for the Savannah Chamber of Commerce, was made upon an unusually large scale, that it might afford data for their discussions in regard to the possibility of improving the intricate interior navigation now passing through them. A. copy of the survey has been furnished to the president of the Chamber. The drawings of the following maps, charts, and sketches have been in progress, or have been completed within the yea.r : Winye.h bay and Georgetown harbor ; Winyah ba.y a.nd Roman

shoals; comparative chart of Maffitt's channel, 1852 to 1854; Charleston harbor, and Savannah river; and these have likewise been engraved, with the exception of the first and last. The chart of Winyah bay and Georgetown harbor is now in progress in the engraving division. Longitude determinations.-Another link in the chain of longitudes between Washington and New Orleans, as determined by telegraph, has been completed this season, by connecting Columbia, South Carolina, with Macon, Georgia. To make the determinations at these points complete, the latitudes and magnetic elements have at the same time been observed. Near the close of December, Dr. Gould took charge of the Columbia station, and the station at Macon was assigned to Assistant G. W. Dean. On the 1st of January the instruments were in position, and the observations for latitude at Macon were commenced. The usual delays from accidents to the telegraph lines, and other causes over which the observers had no control, formed no exception to former experience in this branch of the Coast Survey operations ; and, before the observations were fairly commenced, the services of Dr. Gould were required in another section, and the charge of the Columbia station was transferred to Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow. Between the 16th of January and the 10th of March, one hundred and twenty-seven star signals were successfully exchanged, on seven different nights; the observers exchanging places after three successful nights' observations, for the purpose of eliminating the effect of personal equation. At the Columbia station, four hundred and two observations were made upon eighty-seven stars, with transit No. 8, C. S., for determining the clock error, azimuth, and collimation corrections to the transit instrument. Fifty-five observations were made upon eleven well determined circumpolar stars for thread intervals. The inequalities of the transit pivots were determined with the riding-level, attached to the instrument by the usual method. At Macon, three hundred and thirty observations were made upon seventy-one stars, with transit No. 6, C. S., for the determination of the clock and instrumental corrections. Thirtyfive observations were made upon ten circumpolar stars, at upper and lower culmination, for thread intervals, and the inequalities of the pivots of the transit were determined by the method adopted at Columbia. Observations were also made for determining the personal equation between Mr. Dean and Mr. Goodfellow. The latitude of the station was determined by Assistant G. W. Dean, from one hundred and sixty-three observations upon thirty-four pairs of stars, with zenith telescope No. 5, C. S. The value of the micrometer was obtained from two hundred and eighteen observations upon Polaris near its western elongation, and the necessary observations for the value of the level divisions were also made. The magnetic determinations were made near the southeastern part of the Academy square. They consisted of one hundred and sixty-five observations for variation on four different days, with declinometer No. 22, Jones, (C. S. No. 1,) two sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia on two days, and three sets for dip with the ten-inch Barrow dip-circle (C. S. No. 4) on three days. A meridian line was established and permanently marked in the Academy square at Macon, by Mr. Dean. The ready co-operation of the officers connected with the telegraph lines, and particularly Mesl!l's. Butler and Heiss, superintendents of the lines over which the experiments were made the past sea.son, are appropriately acknowledged in the reports of the officers who had charge of the respective stations. The report of Dr. Gould, which contains many important details in regard to the telegraphic method of longitudes, is given in the Appendix No. 46. . .'.lh:angulation.-The party of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle has been engaged during the season in the triangulation of the Stono river, which, when completed, makes a continuous system of secondary work extending from St. Helena sound to Long island, east of Charleston, S. C.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

He has also restored the hydrographic signals on the ocean shore, destroyed by storms and the encroachments of the sea, between Charleston and Sorth Edisto river, and executed miscellaneous work connected with the primary triangulation. The following are the statistics of the work done : 13 Number of stations occupied........................................................ '' angles measured.................................. ..................... 63
'' '' objects observed upon................................................. observations made...................................................... 70 542

The angles were measured with the ten-inch Gambey repeating theodolite, C. S. No. 43. Mr. Boutelle was assisted during part of the season by Assistant Fairfield and Sub-Assistant Huger, and by Mr. J. A. Sullivan, aid. The party had the use of the schooner Guthrie for transportation. Upon the secondary triangulation Mr. Boutelle remarks : "This work unites with the secondary triangulation of Wadmelaw sound, (Sketch E,) upon the line Bailey (2) to Ohrisholm (2,) and completes a chain of secondary triangles extending from St. Helena sound to the northeast end of Long island, S. 0. You will see, by the sketch, that the chain is a double one from Edisto to Charleston. Separating at Rockville church, one chain of triangles proceeds along the sea-shore by the way of Bohicket creek, Kiawah and Folly Island rivers, to Charleston harbor, where it unites with that work upon the line Charleston light to Circular church. The other chain proceeds up North Edisto river and Wadmelaw sound to Church flats, thence down the Stono and across James island to Charleston harbor, uniting upon the same line as the first set. In crossing James island, the station 'Royal' was made in the primary line Elliott's cut to Charleston light. Two secondary triangles are formed with this station upon Circular church, Elliott's cut to Royal, and Royal to Charleston light, the sum of the two secondary sides; Elliott's cut to Royal, and Royal to Charleston light, being equal to the primary side. They stand this test very well." "In these two series of triangles, there are fifty-nine points, of which fifty-eight have been occupied-several of them three times, and many of them twice. Twenty-one stations are upon houses, or buildings near houses; two are in church towers; one on Charleston light, and one on Fort Sumpter. Five are upon primary tripods forty-:6xe feet above the ground. Fortynine sides are through avenues. In connection with the secondary triangulation, sixty-two other points of third order have been determined for the use of the topographical and hydrographic parties. One of the most difficult tasks for the triangulation party in this section is to furnish points directly upon the sea-coast for the use of the hydrographic parties. A belt of sand-hills, varying in height from ten to thirty-five foet, intervenes between the interior marshes, along which the secondary triangulation is carried, and the sea-beach. These sandhills are nearly everywhere covered with pine forest-trees from fifty to one hundred and twenty feet in height, while the ground between the trees is covered with a dense and tangled undergrowth, sorely impeding our progress in opening avenues. Thus far along the coast, we have succeeded in furnishing points by taking advantage of openings in the wood, putting flags on tall trees visible from the top of some house in the interior on which we have a station, and the line from which we cross from secondary stations like 'Townsend,' on Botany bay, or Big Samly Point, near the mouth of the Stono, which are situaJ;ed upon points commanding the coast in either direction, and making good intersections upon all shore-points seen from one interior station. But occasional caies will arise, as at Long island, near the upper end, where an avenue seems the only available resource. I think, however, that by careful reconnaissance and judgment in establishing secondary stations, points may be furnished along the entire seacoast of South Carolina as fast as they are required by the hydrography." " 'rhe use of houses as secondary stations has been eminently successful. From the statistics here given, you will see that at best many avenues are required. Had all our иstations been upon the ground, we must either have multiplied enormously the number of avenues, or built high signals and observing tripods~ or have made smaller, more numerous and lesssymmetrical

triangles along the edges of the marsh. I have so often mentioned in my reports the considerate kindness with which we have been allowed thus to occupy nearly every house along our routes, that it is unnecessary to enlarge upon it here. The character of our work along the seacoast of South Carolina is such that we are necessarily thrown much upon the courtesy of the planters who occupy it for facilities in prosecuting our labor, aml in many cases we cause them both trouble and inconvenience. These have not only been cheerfully borne, but in addition thereto, an amount of personal kindness and consideration, combined with interest and aid to our work, has been everywhere manifested far beyond our expectations or deserts." An important suggestion in regard to the employment of night-signals, under the circumstances of the southern sections of the survey, is made as follows: "I carried out last season four 'Fresnel signal-lanterns' to use at night ; but the delays in beginning work, described in this report, prevented me from using them. I have great faith that they may be rendered useful, and that night observations through avenues will be found more accurate than those by day. If lateral refraction in avenues is increased by the heat of the sun upon one side of the avenue, while the other side is in shadow, we will be more likely to have uniform density during the night. The nights, too, are generally calmer than the <lay, and our tripods will be more steady. I was sorely pained at the necessity for leaving the question unsettled last season, and hope it will be fully tested next winter. "The amount of light cut off by the avenues is very great. The side, east base, to Mathews' and Elliott's Cut, to New Cut, are each about twelve miles long. At no one of these stations have I ever seen the signal-pole at the other, and upon the last named side, where there is an avenue 4.8 miles long and thirty feet wide, I have never seen the outline of the large tripo(l and scaffold at each end, although both were freshly whitewashed, and could be seen at five miles distance with the naked eye when the country was open. But in the latter case, branches projecting across the line more than forty-five feet were not cut, and thus the avenue formed a. kind of tube five miles in length, and with an average diameter of thirty feet-the eye at Elliot's Cut being 3.5 miles, and at New Cut 4.2 miles, from the nearest end of the tube." The form of tripod used at the primary stations for elevating the instrument described in Assistant Boutelle's report of 1853, ti.nd a model of which is deposited in the Coast Survey office at Washington, appears to have been very successful, as will be seen by the following remarks extracted from Mr. Boutelle' s report of the past season : "A long-continued series of observations at the ElJiott's Cut tripod showed its usefulness, and the great storm of last September tested its steadiness. On examining it with the sectors in December last, the stationpoint marked upon the top of the tripod was found to be exactly over the mark in the ground beneath it:" On the tenth of March operations were closed in this section, the means provided having already been exhausted, and Assistant Boutelle, with Mr. Sullivan, proceeded to the St. John's, fl.Dd thence in the schooner Graham to Key Biscayne, to prepare for the measurement of the base line there, (see Section VI.) Sub-Assistant Huger was attached to the party of Lieutenant Evans, engaged in the triangulation of the St. John's, and when this work closed, proceeded with the same party to Casco bay, (see Section I). When Assistant Boutelle was instructed to resume work in this section, it was expected that he would replace Assistant Cutts, the period of whose detail for the western coast had expired, in the California section. His operations were directed accordingly, especially to the closing up of what he had undertaken. Since that time, Mr. Cutts has been detailed as surveyor to the commission on fisherie8, and Mr. Boutelle will return to this field of labor, in which he has acquired oo much experience. The reconnaissance made two years ago by Major Henry Prince (Report of Superintendent Coast Survey, 1853, p. 55, Sketch E,) showed that a peculiar system of working must be ~pted between the Cape Fear and Winyah bay. Accordingly, Assistant C. P. Bolles was l~lltructed to make a. small triangulation over the narrow sounds, and the small belt compare.-

tively clear of wood, near the ocean, carrying forward the topography at the same time, and making a reconnaissance for a main triangulation. Mr." Bolles was assisted by Sub-Assistant G. H. Bagwell. During the season he carried this combined work nearly to Lockwood's Folly, (Sketch E,) and has arrived at some quite satisfactory results as to the mode of progress with the main triangulation in this region. By this plan of working, the lines for the main work C!ltJl be selected so as to secure the least possible cutting, and other advantages, and their directions being known with reference to the sides of the small triangles, they can be run with certainty, and therefore at a moderate expense, when compared with the plan of random lines. A triangulation of Romerly marshes, south of Tybee entrance, was completed, and of St. Simon's sound and Turtle river in part, executed by Assistant A. W. Longfellow, in the months of :March and April last. The Romerly marshes lie between Skiddoway island on the west, and Great Warsaw island on the east, (see Sketch E,) and are bounded on the north by Wilmington river and Warsaw sound, and on the south by Odingsell's creek. My attention had been directed to their survey by the Chamber of Commerce of Savannah, in reference especially to the channel through them used by the inland steamboats and coasting vessels. A local base was measured, and provision made for connecting it with the triangulation of the coast south of Tybee. Mr. Longfellow remarks: "Much delay and loss of time occurred here from the difficulty of seeing the points and signals, the ordinary obstacles to observing over.. the southern marshes being rendered almost insuperable by the smoke from the extensive fires which were raging in the interior of Georgia. Repeatedly, for eight or ten days in succession, objects within half a mile could not be identified. The mornings were usually foggy, and the smoke and haze so dense during the day, that the only tolerable seeing was had for a few moments before and after sunset. This annoying delay much curtailed my subsequent operations in Section V, as after getting up the signals I was unable to commence the measurements of angles till March 4, &nd concluded them March 23. "In this interval seven (7) stations and twenty (20) topographical points were put up, five (5) stations were occupied, and seventy-three (73) angles were measured, by 1,483 repetitions, with the six-inch Brunner theodolite, No. 67, belonging to the Coast Survey." These points having been furnished to the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, Assistant Longfellow took up the triangulation of St. Simon's sound and Brunswick harbor. (Sketch E.) A base line was measured with the chain upon the sand beach at the south end of St. Simon's island, in front of the plantation of the Hon. T. Butler King. From this base the work was carried southwardly to Jekyl island, on the outer shore of which, as on St. Simon's, points were established for the use of the sounding party in surveying the bar. From Jekyl the triangles were carried to within a mile of Brunswick, and also started northwardly towards Frederica, Darien, aud Doboy sound. Fourteen (14) stations were erected, and seven (7) occupied. Thirty-two (32) angles were measured by 1,496 repetitions. Copies of the field-notes, and the computations of the work, have been made and forwarded to .the office. On closing this work, Mr. Longfellow returned to Section I, where he has been employed in the topography of Casco bay. (See Section I.) A reconnaissance for the triangulation of Cumberland sound and the entrance to St. Mary's river, will be found included in the notice of Section VI. Topography.-The topography of Edisto island has been continued by Assistant John Seib, and that south of the Cape Fear, in connection with the work of secondary triangulation, by Assistant Charles P. Bolles. Assistant Seib commenced the topography near Edingsville, (see Sketch E,) on the ocean shore of Edisto, at the point where it had been left by Assistant George D. Wise, aoout the middle of Ja~uary, a.nd between that period and the 8th of May, had completed the shore-

line ancl interior to the South Edisto river, and up the river nearly to Raccoon island, and on the northeast to the public road, joining Assistant Wise's work there. The shore-line surveyed was eleven miles and a quarter, (llt,) the area thirty-four (34) miles, the shore-line of creeks and water-courses navigable by small vessels seventy (70) miles. This is one of the most highly cultivated regions of the sea islands of South Carolina, and being intersected in every direction by water-courses, is difficult to survey. Mr. Seib acknowledges his obligations to the gentlemen on whose plantations he surveyed for their kindness in facilitating his work. On completing the inking of his ma11s, Assistant Seib resumed the topography of the Chesapeake above its entrance. (See Section III.) The topographical work from Cape Fear entrance to Lockwood's Folly (Sketch E) has already been referred to under the hea.d of the triangulation with which it was combined. Hydrograpliy.-The regular hydrography of this section has, as heretofore, been under the charge of' Lieut. Corng. J. N. Maffitt, U.S. N., assistant ill the Coast Survey, having this year the services of three sailing vessels, the schooners Crawford and Madison, and the tender Bouncer. This party commenced work with the resurvey of Maffitt's channel, in CharleEton barbor, apprehensions in regard to its deterioration having been caused by the very great changes of shore-line of Sullivan's island beach, near the channel, made hy the severe gale of September 11, 1854. Happily these fears were groundless, the depth of water on the bulk-head dosing the channel having actually improved. (See Comparative Chart, Sketch No. 20.) A~out the same time Lieutenant Simpson, in. the Madison, commenced the outside hydrography from Charleston bar to North Edisto, (Sketch E,) completing the whole within two miles in the course of the sea.son, thus furnishing materials for a coast chart of the section. The unusually boisterous character of the season told much upon the progress of the work:. After completing the re-examination of Maffitt' s channel, the survey of the Romerly marshes (Sketch No. 24) near Tybee entrance, Georgia, and their approaches, was made upon the hai;is of lfr. Longfellow's triangulation, and a chart at once furnished for the Chamber of Commerce of Savannah. Changes havin.g been reported in the depth and position of the main ship-channel of Charleston, Lieut. Comg. Maffitt next made a re-survey there with results which will be referred to hereafter. The la.st work of the sea.son was a survey of the northern approaches to Tybee, and an elaborate hydrographic reconnaissance of Martin's Industry shoal, Port Royal bar, Port Royal hay, and Beaufort river, S. C., to the city of Beaufort. On the 4th of June the work was closed in this section and the pa.rty transferred to the James river, (see hydrogrrphy Section III,) having in the last mentioDed work accomplished one of the most difficult pieces of hydrography yet undertaken in the collrse of the survey of the coast. In a severe gale on the 23d of April the schooner Bouncer, used as a tender by the vessels of this party, wa.s wrecked off Port Roya.l bay. The vessel was at anchor when the gale came up but could not be got under weigh, and both cables parting, she went ashore and was dashed to pieees. All hands were happily saved, but the property contained in the vessel, public and privaoo, was lost or much injured. In passing northward Lieut. Comg. Maffitt re-examined the Cape Fear entrance and New Inlet, and also determined too positions of the new beacons at Beaufort, N. C. (See hydrography of Section IV.) The statistics of the sea.son's work in this section (Section V) a.re as follows:

This work, with that off the Cape Fear and Beaufort, North Carolina, and in the James river, makes the following remarkable aggregate of the year. The officers of the party were Lieutenant Simpson and Acting Masters Davidson and Luce, of whose services Lieut. Comg. Maffitt makes full acknowledgment in his report.

The recent results of the survey of Maffi.tt's channel have been placed on the comparation map, (Sketch No. 20,) and a new edition of it issued with this report. A complete hydrographic reconnaissance of Doboy bar and sound, leading to Darien, Georgia, was made by Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, in February last. Lieut. Comg. Craven states in his report: "I have to observe that the winter season at the South was particularly unfavorable for my operations, the atmosphere being filled with smoke from the extensive fires raging in the woods ; during a delay of six weeks at Doboy, I had, in the aggregate, only ten working days." The following are the statistics of the work : и

Comg. Craven also made a hydrographic examination of St. Simon's sound and Turtle river, to Brunswick, Ga., in compliance with the request made to me by the Secretary of the Navy, and a sketch founded upon it was sent to the Department. It is proposed, during the coming season, to replaC this by a complete survey, based on the triangulation of Mr. Longfellow, heretofore noticed. The hydrographic reconnaissance of Cumberland sound, and the harbor of Fernandina, by Lieut. Trenchard, will be found under the head of hydrography of section YI. Tides.-'.I'idal observations were made at St. Simon's island, near the light-house, with a Saxton self-registering gauge, by Gustavus '7\Tiirdemann, Esq., for two lunations 1 and the records have been reduced at the office. Charleston has been one of the permanent tidal stations of the survey; but on the change of occupancy of Castle Pinckney from the military authorities to the civil, the observations were interrupted, and the tide gauge, and wharf where it was placed, were much injured. Great pains have been taken, but with indifferent success, to restore this stat.ion to its former efficiency. As soon as Mr. Wurdemann is disposable he will be sent there and the observations be resumed. Few persons are aware of the importance of not breaking in upo.n a series of observations like these, where the circumstances varying in a cycle, a break deranges by so much the whole series, and hence it is difficult to secure continuity of observation. In this case, the efforts made by the chief of the tidal party at the office were without success. SECTION VI.-FROM THE ST. MARY'S RIVER TO ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, COAST OF FLORIDA, AND INCLUDING THE FLORIDA REEFS AND KEYS. (SKETCH F.) The work of this section has made excellent progress during the past season, and has been pushed even beyond the limit permitted by the appropriation of the past :fiscal year, by anticipating in a degree the increased resources of the present. The operations have been as follows : 1. Two base lines have been measured ; one on Key Biscayne, the other on Cape Sable prairie. 2. The triangulation of the Keys has been extended eastward to Loggerhead Key. 3. The triangulation of the Keys within the sounds has bf'en extended westward towards Florida bay. 4. The triangulation of the St. John's river has been carried from Mayport Mills, near the entrance, to above Jacksonville. 5. The triangulation of the entrance to Cumberland sound, and of the St. Mary's river, and of Fernandina harbor, has been commenced. 6. The topography of Mud Keys, Snipe Keys, Saddle Bunch Keys, Crane Keys, Whiting Key, Marvin Key, Mallory Key, Blake Key, and Wells Key, has been completed, and the marking for the Land Office has been executed. . 7. The topography of Key Largo has been in progress. 8. The topography of reefs and keys of previous years, including that of Key Biscayne bay, of the Marquesas, of Boca. Chica, and the keys northeast of it, and of Key Largo, has been verified. 9. The topography of the St. John's has been carried from Mayport Mills to Jacksonville, requiring but little additional work to carry it to the limit of the triangulation. 10. The hydrography of the reef has been carried from Carysfort reef to Grecian shoal. 11. .A. hydrographic reconnaissance of Tampa bay has been made.

68

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

12. The hydrography of the St. John's river has been executed from the entrance to above Jacksonville, and elaborate tidal and current observations have been recorded. 13. A hydrographic reconnaissance of St. Mary's entrance and Fernandina harbor has been made. 14. Tidal observations have been made for not less than two lunations, by self-registering gauges, at Indian River inlet, Indian Key, and the Tortugas. 15. Fourteen beacons or signals have been placed upon the Florida reef. An account of these various operations will be found under separate beads in the following pages. They have employed the time, in part, of one party for the measurement of bases ; of three triangulation parties; of four topographical pltrties; and of three hydrographic parties; one having a steamer and sailing vessel, and the others, each, a sailing vessel. The office-work of the several parties which had "been in the field or afloat during the previous season in this section, was brought up before recommenc-ing operations. The drawing of the first sheet of the chart of Florida reefs, 80 &00, has 'been completed, as also a comparative map of the northwest channel to Key West, between 1846 and 1851. The engraving of the chart of Key West harbor, and its approaches, has been completed within the year. The work which is directly available for the pmposes of the Land Office, is that executed 'by one of the triangulation parties, two of the topographical parties, and the measurement of' the base at Cape Sable, by means of which the prairie may at once be divided. At the request of the Engineer Department, and in conformity with arrangements made, by the approval of the Chief Engineer, General JosephG. Totte:n, with Lieutenant John Newton and Captain .J. F. Gilmer, of the corps of engineers, the survey of the St. Jahn's river was carried from Mayport mills, near the entrance, at which it was left in lS-53, to a point beyond Jacksonville. The triangulation was completed in May last, an.d the topography and hydrography followed it closely. There yet remains a base of -rerification to be measured, and a small p0<rtion of topography above Jacksonville to be executed. connection with the hydrography, special observations l>f tides a.nd currents were called for by the Commission on the impro..-ement of the St. John's, a part of which n.ar the bar at the entrance were of very difficult execution. r.I.1be work has not yet been discussed, but, as far as present indications go, will be satisfactory. J inspected the parties. engaged in it in March last, while on the way to. IDasu<re the sou.th Florida 'bases, and fou:nd the arrangements and progress quite satisfactory. One of the most valuable labors of the sea:son in this section has been the placing, for the Light-House Board, the beacons forming a nearly continuous series along the whole Florida reef1 from the Fowey Rocks, at the eastern extremity, to Ea.stern. Sambo, on the western end of the reef. They are placed at suit.able distances and apprnpriately marked, so a.s to enaOle the ll.avigator, in the day-time, precisely to know his position when he makes any one of them, and! to follow them in succession along the :reef, after he h&S fallen in with and recognised one. These have replaced Cbast Survey signals, so that their positions are determined where thesurvey has reached. Generally, these signals were made rnie of in placing the new ones, and thus it has been found that the materia}fl used are likely to stand the action of the sea for many years. The places, constrt10tion, aud all other matters relating to these signals, wePe a.pprovetl by the Light-House Board before acting in replacin~ them. The tidal statiBns established between Cape Florida on the east, and the Tortugas on the west,. :have giTen very satisfactory information in regard to. the progress of the tide-wave through theFlorida. channel. The difference in the time of semi-aiurnab high-wa;ter 'between Cape Florida and Indian Key r is thirtyиone minutes; between Indian. Key and Key West, thirty-si:iE minutes; a.nd: between Key West and the Tortugas, twenty-nine minutes. . The corresponding distances are about fifty-eight, fifty-five, and forty-nine nautical miles, Key Biscayne and Cape Sable bases.-These bases,. for the triangulation of sou.th Florida:, a.nd

of the keys and reef, were selected after a reconnaissance by Assistant F. R. Gerdes had determined the probable character of the main triangulation, and the facilities afforded for the measurement of the base or bases upon which it must rest. The sites selected were subsequently surveyed by the plane-table, and their connection with the triangulation studied. (Sketch F No. 2.) Bases of about four miles in length it was found could be readily measured on Key Biscayne and at Cape Sable, the length being in good relation to that of the sides of the triangles, and their connection with the triangulation easy. A preliminary base measured at Key Biscayne would serve the immediate purposes of the triangulation of the eastern keys and eastern part of the reef, while the final base there would verify the lengths coming from Cape Sable, and give a base for passing northward on the Atlantic side of the Peninsula. The Cape Sable base comes by an easy triangulation across Florida Bay, to above the middle of the keys, between the Marquesas on the west, and Virginia Key on the east. Considered as the bases upon which the triangulation of the main land and adjacent keys was to rest, they were at the opposite side of the peninsula-the one on the Atlantic, and the other on the Gulf side. The site of the Key Biscayne base presented very moderate undulations of surface, (Sketch F No. 2,) and but few obstacles from wood or from marshy ground. That at Cape Sable (Sketch F No. 2) was admirable, being almost a perfect level on a prairie, with the single drawback, that dry weather was indispensable to the measurement, the site becoming rapidly soft and tremulous after rains. The Key Biscayne site required considerable preparation, by clearing and grading, which was executed, first by Assistant Gerdes, and next by Lieutenant Totten, U. S. A., and by Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, and others of my party, just before and during the measurement. The lowest parts of the Cape Sable base were ditched on either side by l\Ir. Gerdes, and in some places embanked. At the western end a cut was made through a mangrove wood, and a slight embankment raised by Messrs. Boutelle snd Dean just before the measurement; but generally, firing or cutting the grass, and removing the roots where the measuring apparatus stood, were the only preparations necessary. The preparation of the monuments and screw-piles for the ends of the bases, the stones and screw-piles for marking the intermediate miles, and of the equipments generally, were made during the winter, under my direction, by Thomas McDonnell, Esq. The preparations for measurement were made by Assistant C. O. Boutelle and l\lr. J. A. Sullivan, aid. The party had the use of the schooner Graham for transportation, and, during part of the time, the schooner Bowditch; and were also aided, by transportation and towage, by the steamer Corwin, Lieut. Oomg. Craven. The base apparatus, retained a.t the office until the latest moment for comparisons, was sent by steam from Washington, and shipped on board the Graham at the St. John's river. Comparisons were made by the measuring bars Nos. 1 and 2 with the standard iron-bar before the measurement at Key Biscayne ; during it, on the occurrence of an injury to one of the measuring bars, and at the close, and on closing the Cape Sable measurement. The apparatus for comparison of the measuring bars with the standard was the same as that in use at previous bases, the Saxton pyrometer. It consisted1 essentially, of two granite or heavy wooden posts, sunk about two feet in the ground, at a distance from each other equal to the length of the standard-bar, The pressure of the earth around the posts was prevented by a box filled with sand, which produced a remarkable steadiness in the apparatus. A sunken bo_x, loosely fitting around the posts, protected them from the direct action of the sun, wind, and rams. One of these posts supported an immovable Ji.butting screw, the other a mirror with abutting screw attached, placed "in a vertical position, and turning upon an axis. Opposite the mirror, at a distance of twenty feet, and at right angles to the direction of the posts, a wooden pillar supported a graduated scale and reading telescope. The abutting screw, mirror, and ~cale, were in the same horizontal plane. In making a comparison, the standard-bar, enclosed in a wooden case with openings at the ends for the extremities of the bar, was placed

70

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT

on trestles between the granite posts, one end of the bar being in contact with the fixed abutting screw, the other resting against the screw of the mirror. The reading of the scale, as reflected in the mirror, and the indications of the thermometers attached to the bar were then noted, the standard removed, and one of the measuring bars made to occupy its place. If the length of the bar fell short of that of the standard, so that the reading came off the scale, the deficiency was made up by turns of the mirror screw, the number of turns being carefully noted. In the comparisons after the measurement, however, a larger scale was used, and the necessity of turning the screw was clone away with. In all, seventeen sets of comparisons, each set consisting of three readings of the standard, and three of each of the measuring bars were taken, both before and after the measurement, and upon eight different clays, at temperatures ranging from 57░ to 86░ Fahrenheit. The measurement at Key Biscayne was commenced from North Base on the 9th of April, and nine working days, of seven and one-third hours each, were occupied in the measurement, the average progress in a day being 107.2 tubes, or one-fourth of a mile. The chief obstacles to rapid progress were the interwoven palmetto roots, which it was impossible entirely to extirpate, obliging the bearers to move with great caution ; the irregularity and frequent changes of grade in the surface; and the high temperature at which the work was carried on. The whole number of tubes measured was 965, (corresponding to a length of about 3.601 miles,) uncorrected from inclination, of which 492, or more than one-half, required an adjustment for rising on falling grades. The average of greatest plus inclinations on the several days was 58', of greatest minus 54'. The average temperature of the thermometer at the contact end of each tube, was 82 11 .9 Fahrenheit. The party left camp, generally, before daylight, so as to reach the part of the line where the measurement was going on by sunrise at latest, and the work was continued until sunset, with an interruption of an hour at breakfast-time, and of two hours during the hottest part of the day. The following table contains some of the statistics of the measurement which are of interest.

The measurement of the base at Cape Sable was commenced on the 4th of May and completed on the 11th, occupying eight days of about six hours eaeh. 'fhe whole number of tubes measured was 1,072; the average number per day 134, or one half mile in length ; and the greatest number in any one day was 192 in six hours twenty-four minptes-an average of two minutes to each tube. For the whole base the average number of tubes per day of nine hours was 200. This rapidity was attained at a mean temperature of 87░.9. The level character of the ground is shown by the fact, that of the whole number of

OF THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

71

tubes measured, only 78, or a little over seven-hundredths of the whole, were inclined, while the greatest inclination did not exceed 25'. The nature of the ground rendered it advisable to mark the ends of this base with screw-piles, which had accordingly been prepared for the purpose-a large one, the centre of which marked the end, and four smaller ones-two in the line of the base, and two in a line at right angles to it, at suitable distances from the central pile. It is not necessary here to enter into the details of inserting these piles and making the points with precision; they gave, however, no especial trouble. Two of the mile-points werA marked by similar piles. The statistics of the Cape Sable base are given in the annexed table.

I have already stated that the immediate preparations for measurement were made by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle and Mr. J. A. Sullivan, aid. In the measurement I was assisted by Assistant G. W. Dean, Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow, Mr. Fairman Rogers, volunteer aid, and 1\Ir. Thomas McDonnell. Mr. Prenot, of the office of Weights and Measures, accompanied us to keep the apparatus in its best working order, and on the occasion of an injury to it at Key Biscayne, rendered especially valuable service by his mechanical skill and ingenuity and his promptness. Mr. C. B. Baker, aid, rendered occasional service on the two lines. Mr. Hogers and Mr. McDonnell took part with me in the comparisons of the apparatus with the standardbar. Mr. Dean placed the monuments and mile-stones, assisted by .Mr. Goodfellow. The records were kept by Mr. Goodfellow. This service being especially severe, I must transgress my usual rule by making a sincere acknowledgment to every member of the party of my high appreciation of their labors, so cheerfully rendered under circumstances often of considerable trial. To Fairman Rogers, Esq., of Philadelphia, civil engineer, who volunteered to accompany me for the sake of seeing the modes of working in the Coast Survey parties, and was always ready for work of any description, even the hardest, skilful, energetic, and untiring in its execution, my thanks are especially due and especially paid. During the measurement at Cape Sable, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle and Lieut. James Totten, U. S. A., made a minute reconna.issance for the connection of the base with the kevs to the southward and on the main to the northward. и . Lieut. Watkins, U. S. N., light-house inspector of the district, gave us every facility which his duty permitted, accompanying the party in the light-house schooner "Florida" to Cape Sable, and assisting in the reconnaissance just referred to personally, and by the aid of his vessel,и boa.ts, and men.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The comparisons of the measuring apparatus with the standard-bar at Cape Sable were completed between the 12th and 18th of May, and the party left the base. Similar comparisons, in which I was assisted by Mr. Hilgard, Mr. Dean, Mr. McDonnell, and Mr. Prenot, were made after the return of the apparatus to Washington-an arrangement as nearly similar in all respects to that used in the -field as it could be made, having been adopted for the ex11eriments. It is worthy of note, that the results thus obtained are the best which the office comparisons have yielded, owing to difficulties heretofore found insuperable in the change of distance of t1.e ~two 1ioints connected with the ground, between which the apparatus is measured, and other causes, some of which, though obvious, could not be remedied, and others which baffied our investigations. It may be of interest to compare the statistics of the different measurements made with this base apparatus since it bas received its present approved form. The bases which I have measured since that time have been those at Bodie's island, N. C., Edisto island, S. C., Key Biscayne, and Cape Sable, Florida. The following table shows the comparison:

The base at Rodie's island was measured upon a sand-beach, and in part on perfectly level sand-flats ; that at Edisto over a remarkably level piece of cultivated ground ; that at Key Biscayne over an undulating surface of sand ; that at Cape Sable over an almost level prairie covered with grass. At Edisto considerable pains were taken in grading. At Key Biscayne more grading was desirable than we had time to make. At Bodie's island and Cape Sable scarcely any grading was necessary. The surface at Bodie's island was a sharp silicious sand, on which it was easy to move the iron plates supporting the trestles of the measuring tubes. At Cape Sable the earth, when .the roots of the grass were removed, was a loam of mixed vegetable and calcareous matter, the latter being in the form of an impalpable powder, and forming, when wet, a sticky mass like clay. The base measured during the present season at Key Biscayne was connected with the triangulation of the Florida Reef by Lieut. James Totten, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey. Arriving at the end of May from Key West, in the schooner Bowditch, Lieutenant Totten commenced at once the crcetion of signals at North base, South base, the station Key Biscayne, and at Elliott's Beach. The works at the last-named station being found nearly obliterated, a new centre was established, and marked by five granite blocks sunk into the earth; four being placed at the cardinal points, six feet distant respectively, from that on which the centre was marked by the intersection of lines cut on the stone. A record of the sta;tion-ma.rb at ea.eh

end of the newly measured base has been placed on file in the office. Lieutenant Totten commenced observations at Elliott's Beach on the 1st of June, and successively occupied South Base, Key Biscayne, and Korth Base. The sig-nals used at these stations were from fifty to sixty feet in height, and the utmoRt care was taken in their adjustment in vertical positions. The connection was completed within a month, (see Sketch F,) and the results include the following statistics : Number of stations occupied.............................................. 4

" " North Base to Key Biscayne........................... 960. 7 metres. Area included in the triangles........................................... 11.1 sq. miles. After concluding this work, Lieutenant Totten laid up the schooner Bowditch at Key West, and returned to the North, where he was subsequently engaged with my party, as mentioned under Section I. Triangulation.-The triangulation of the Florida reefs and keys has been eontinued by the parties of Lieutenant James Totten, U. S. Army, and of Lieutenant A. H. Seward, U. S. Army, assistants in the Coast Survey-the former having charge of the work outside of the sounds, and the latter of that within them. The services of Lieutenant James Totten having been required in connection with the preparations for measuring the base lines before referred to, and the erection of beacons for the light-house establishment, the party was placed in charge of Sub-Assistant John Rockwell, an extract from whose report will show the limits and general character of the work done. "The space embraced by the triangulation (see Sketch F) extends from the line Rock Point-Eastern Sambo, eastward as far as the line Loggerhead key-Palmetto, the last named station being near Newfound harbor, and northward as far as the line Douglas keyPoint Dora, where it joins previous work of Lieutenant Totten. The southern boundary is the line of the Florida reef. This is independent of the small piece of detached work for the determination of the position of the northwest light-house in Key West harbor, which was also accomplished by the party." The Saddle Bunch Group, besides numerous detached keys, are included in the limits just stated, and the results of the season may be summed up as follows : Number of stations occupied ................................................ ,..... 23
'' observations made ..................................................... 5,341

Area of triangulation, in square miles.......................................... 125 Length of longest side, in miles.................................................. 9.335. The instrument used in making the observations were the ten-inch, No. 73, and six-inch, No. 19, Gambey theodolites of the Coast Survey. Th~ ~chooner Petrel was employed in this and other duties of the party of Lieutenant Totten. I v1s1ted this party in the latter part of April, and was entirely satisfied with all the arrangements for working. Before the close of the season a sufficient number of points was determined to occupy a. topographical party in its appropriate duty during the next season. Mr. Rockwell gives the following particulars relative to the peculiar character of the keys embraced in the survey of the present year. "The keys over which the work was extended may saf~ly be characterized as among the least valuable Qf all the keys. The foundation of coral rock is covered but scantily with soil. In eome places the mangrove and buttonwood trees will grow, in others only the bush mangrove. The solid land forms only a small proportion of the whole. A large part of the area is covered by an intricate system of shallow creeks and lagoons, which cut up and separate the keys, and another part by swamps, where the mangrove grows to a considerable size and with won10

derful density. Within this region there are a few settlements of single houses on spots where sufficient soil has been found to cultivate vegetables and fruits. The quality of the soil appears to be good enough to produce all that is elsewhere raised in similar climates, and such trees or plants as require no great depth of earth, :flourish well ; but the supply of soil is quite deficient. There is, however, an opportunity to effect a good deal more than has been done in the way of cultivation of the soil. There is available land enough in these keys, within a reasonable distance from Key West, to supply thatmarket with such articles as can be raised, but the town is at present dependent for its supplies upon importation from the main land of Florida and the N orthem States. "Sponges are obtained in the shallow waters among the keys to a considerable extent, and form one of the articles of export from Key West, though not a very important one." (Appenи dix No. 25.) The party of Lieutenant A. H. Seward, U. S. A., was engaged during part of the season in extending southward from last year's limits the triangulation in Barnes' sound. (See ' Sketch F.) In consequence, however, of the increasing shoalness of the water in the lower part of the sound, the schooner Bowditch, employed by the party for transportation, was necessarily left at the anchorage of the preceding year-the triangulation being carried on from thence with small boats until the distance from the vessel rendered further operations by this method impracticable. Six stations were occupied by the party, at which a hundred and thirty-three angular measures were made by eight hundred observations. The work of the season terminated at Duck key, (Sketch F,) on the 20th of February; at which time the schooner Bowditch was assigned to Assistant Whiting, and was subsequently employed in the operations of my own party in the section. The following extract from the report of Lieutenant Seward shows the nature of the obstacles met in the progress of the work in Barnes' sound: "While employed in carrying on the triangulation, I took advantage of favorable opportunities to reconnoitre that portion of the sound between Key Largo and the main shore, but was unable in many places to get more tha.n half way across with the small boat, on account of the bars which connect the different keys having no channels as heretofore." After consultation with Lieutenant Seward, and a personal examination of portions of this intricate region, a plan of transportation and working ha11 been adopted which I believe will remedy in a great degree the obstacles heretofore found. By coming off the base at Cape Sable, and carrying the triangulation eastward to meet the former work, a satisfactory solution will be found of the problem regarding the continuance of the triangulation. Lieutenant Seward joined the party of Assistant Blunt in the summer, and has since been engaged in operations connected with the work of the New York Harbor Commission, as noticed under Section II. The triangulation of the St. John's, by Lieutenant A. W. Evans, U.S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, is connected with that formerly executed at and near the entrance by Assistant G. A. Fairfield, by the common stations Sand-hill, (3,) Round Pond, and Horse-shoe, (See Sketch F,) and, from the side between the last two, the work was carried on up the river, and points given to a topographical party, under the charge of Assistant A. M. Harrison. "The observations for continuing and completing the work were carried steadily onward, with occasional delays in reconnoitering for new intermediate stations, and the erection of signals. The St. John's, from its mouth to Da.mes' Point, presents a series of extensive marshes, intersected by large streams, affording opportunity, which was used as much as possible, for a comparatively large order of triangles. At Reddie's Point, four miles above Dames' Point, the river is suddenly contracted to about a mile in width, and it maintains this width, with slight variation, to Jacksonville. The heavily wooded nature of the banks prevented any selection of stations, except at points comparatively near the water's edge1 and therefore rendered necessatY

an increased number of them. An object kapt in view from the beginning was the avoidance, as much as possible, of heavy cutting of timber, unavoidable in many cases.'' Mr. John B. Harvie acted as aid to Lieutena.nt Evans during part of the season, and Mr. F. M. 1\folver during the rest. The instrument used was a six-inch theodolite, by Brunner, C. S. No. 58, with which all the observations were made. " The plan adopted in the triangulation of Casco bay, in the summer of 1854, was continued here-of taking, for every set of measures reading forward upon the instrument, a corresponding set backward, to correct any possible drag of the lower limb. The work was :finished only in May, the measurement of a base of verification being unavoidably postponed.'' The work executed upon the St. John's may be summed up as follows: "The triangulation extended from Mayport Mills to Winter's Point, about two miles above Jacksonville; thirtyonc (31) stations of 2d order were occupied, and four (4) of 3d order; and three hundred and ninety-three angles were measured upon one hundred and ten points, by five thousand six hundred and fifty-four (5,654) observations. Three stations of Mr. Fairfield were occupied, and twenty-eight new ones." "The St. Mary's work occupied about a month's time, and consisted in the measurement of a base and in a reconnaissance, having for its object ultimately the selection of stations for a triangulation, and immediately the furnishing of points to the hydrographic party which commenced operations in June. My operations embraced Cumberland sound, northward as far as Dungenness House, Amelia river to Yellow Bluff, the proposed terminus of the Atlantic and Gulf railroad, and the entrance and bar. A rough reconnaissance was :first made with a telescope having a. circle reading to three minutes. Points upon the shore of the sound and the sea, selected with a view to intervisibility, were occupied with theodolite No. 58, and angles measured by sweeping round upon all signals in sight. These signals were generally flags, and a numerical nomenclature was adopted for them ; commencing on tho inside of each island, and running outward, in order, to the sea-shore. These points were thus all determined by intersection, but not, of course, with the accuracy of a triangulation. A base of a mile in length was selected upon Tiger island, near the sound, from which it was separated by a strip of wooded sand-hills. The ground, of sand and marsh, was very level and unobstructed. Four hundred and four bars in all were measured, (1,616 metres, or 1.005 miles,) and the temperatures of each noted. The extremities of the base were marked by stones set in the ground, and were then connected by observations with the points of the reconnaissance. These points were then plotted, and a sketch, including a tolerably accurate shore-line, was furnished to Lieutenant S. D. Trenchard) U.S. Navy, in charge of the hydrographic party." Topog't"aphy.-Two parties, as in the previoue season, have been employed in the speciai survey of the Florida keys for the General Land Office. Thi topography of several groups lying north ea.st of Key West, and of detached keys in their immediate vicinity, has been executed by the party of Assistant J. Hull Adams, and the included area divided into quarter sections by posts numbered and properly secured to resist the action of the tides for their displacement. Assistant Adams arrived at Key West in December, but owing to the detention of the schooner Agassi.z for repairs, rendered necessary by the damage sustained by being run upon the rocks near Cruz del Padre, on the coast of Cuba, operations were not commenced until the close of the following month. From that time until near the end of May the survey was prosecuted without interruption ; and regarding the difficulties presented by the peculiar character of the localities, as falling within my own personal observation, the results are highly creditable to the party entrusted with its execution. The work includes the topography and marking of the llud keys, Snipe keys, Saddle Bunch keys, Crane keys, Whiting key, Marvin key, Mallory key, Blake key, and Wells' key, (Sketch F.) Favorable weather, and the diligent employment of facilities thm afforded 1 show a consid~able aggregate in the work executed during the aoo.son. The atatistias are as follows

76

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

и

Shore-line of keys surveyed ........................................... 142 miles. Area ................................. , ....................................... 63 squaremiles. Special mention is made in the season's report of the untiring application to duty of SubAssistant 0. T. Iardella, attached to this party. Tracings from the maps drawn by Assistant Adams during the summer have been furnished to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, reference to wbich, and extracts from. the report of the season, will be found in Appendix No. 25. ' The work of this party was inspected and verified by actually repeating portions of it independently by Assistant H. L. Whiting, one of the most experienced and accomplished topographers of the Coast Survey, whose report was very favorable to its accuracy, thoroughness, and neatness. Assistant Whiting examined also the work of previous years by Mr. Adams, from Soldier key to Key Largo, and also near Boca Chica, at the western end of the reef. In his report, Mr. Whiting says: "Mr. Adams' work appears to be very carefully and faithfully executed, even to the minor details, and the representations are natural and characteristic. I consider it as work of the first class." "With regard to the amount of work done in a season, I should consider it fair. The survey is simple; that is, it has but one feature-the determining of the outline of a generally wooded shore ; but the difficulties of getting at this shore, with accurate points and stations for detail, are sometimes almost insurmountable. The outside shore is generally accessible, but on the inside, and on the shore of the creeks and passages between the keys, the mangrove often grows quite out into deep water; and where this is not the case, the mud is so deep and soft that it is almost impossible to approach or make stations along the shore." "These are characteristics peculiar to this work and coast, and materially affect a comparison or estimate as to the amount of work which might be done in any given length of time. " Of the two sheets of Mr. Adams' work, where the Land Office sections were marked, I found all the posts in place, as far as I examined; and it is worthy of remark, that every corner section, falling upon any of the keys, has been marked throughout the whole of his work of last season. This season the marking has been omitted on the overflowed lands, &c., according to instructions.'' The work of the second party, which was under the charge of Sub-Assistant S. A. Wainwright, has furnished the outside shore-line between Point Perry and Excelsior, and three square miles of the interior of Key Largo North. (Sketch F.) The length of shore-line surveyed is about thirty-three miles. Various expedients, tried by Sub-Assistant Wainwright, for inserting posts to mark the intersections of land section-lines with the shore, were found impracticable, the coast being composed of continuous coral rock. Signals were, however, placed at all the points determined, and adequate means will be provided, when the time for final marking arrives, to overcome the difficulty referred to. The progress of the work at Key Largo North during the season was much hindered by bad weather and by the cutting of lines. The schooner Joseph Henry was employed in the operations of this party. Mr. Wainwright reports that, besides the stormy character of the early part of the season, the great distance of safe harbors in which his vessel could lie, outside, impeded sensibly his progress. Since the date of my last annual report, the topographical sheet of Bahia Honda, or Spanish harbor, has been turned into the office by Mr. Wainwright. lle is now about to resume work on the inside shore of Key Largo North. The topography executed by Mr. Wainwright and by his assistant, Mr. H. S. Duval, in the season of 1854, was examined by Assistant H. L. Whiting, who reports with moderate favor

77

of its character, and with less of its amount. That of thiA year iA, com;idering the nature of the season, more satisfactory, as I ascertained by personal examination, near the close of the seaRon. Topographical verijfoation.-A careful examination or verification of the topography executed in the southern part of this section during previous years, and during the early p:ut of thiR season, was made by Assistant H. L. иwhiting during lmrt of the months of _l\Iarch and April. This consisted of three topographical sheets by Sub-Assistant ,J. H. Adams, in Key Biscayne bay; one sheet by Sub-Assistant S. A. \Vain wright, comprising the north end of Key Largo ; two sheets by Sub-Assistant Adams, northeast from Boca Chica; and one sheet of Sub-Assistant R. M. Bache, containing Boca Chica itself. The object of this examination was not only to verify the work, but to have the suggestions, in regard to the Land Office survey, of one of the most experienced and accomplished topographers in the Coast Survey. The verification was found quite satisfactory, as might have been expected, and the details of thi~ aml Mr. Whiting's suggestions will form a basis for future action. After speaking of the great difficulty and expenses of cutting the lines of quarter-sections through the mangrove growth, l\fr. "Whiting observes: "If the object of the Land Ofl:lce survey is to define and locate the particular sections and quarter-sections sufficiently to enable those who take up the land to identify them, this is accomplished, it appears to me, lwyond all question, by the marking as now done. The fact of the section-lines terminating and intersecting with the shore-line on all sides of the keys, makes a positive and definite point, and a mathematical determination of the sections.'' On presenting this subject to the Commissioner of the Land Office, I was authorized to omit the cutting through of their lines, the expense of which i.s certainly, under the circumstances, not warranted. Mr. Whiting had the use of the schooner Bowditch for the greater portion of the work. The plane-table survey of the banks of St. John's river, Florida, for the Engineer Department, has been nearly completed by the party of Assistant A. M. Harrison, commencing on the 6th of March, at Mayport Mills, and joining with the sheet of Sub-Assistant R. M. Bache, the work was carried along both sides of the river as far up as Jacksonville, where it was stopped on the 14th of May by the illness of Assistant Harrison. His report presents the following statistics : Miles of shore-line surveyed..................................................................... 65 Miles of creeks, sloughs, &c......... .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . 58 .Area in square miles.............................................................................. 13! The work is embraced in three sheets, and the portion above Jacksonville, yet to be included, will occupy but a small part of the time allotted for work in the coming season. The schooner J. Y. Mason was employed in transporting the party, instruments, and equipments, required in the work. Special mention is made, in the report of the season, of the efficient services of Mr. P. R. Hawley, who was engaged as aid to this party. Assistant Harrison has been occupied since his return from Florida in plane-table surveys, as mentioned under Section II. Hydrography.-The hydrography of the Florida reef, under the charge of Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, has made good progress, and the quality of the work fully sustains the reputation of that accomplished hydrographer. It has been extended from Carysfort reef to Grecian shoal, (see Sketch F,) and comprises an area of sixty-five square miles. The number of miles and soundings run was 267 ; the number of angles measured, 622; and of soundings taken, 16,136 . . A section of the Gulf Stream has also been run by the same officer, which brings the explorations south as far as Cape Florida. This party also rendered essential assistance to me in transportation, and other facilities, while preparing for and engaged in measuring the base lines at Key Biscayne and Cape Sable.

78

REPORT OF TllE SUPERINTENDENT

: The cheerful manner in which all these services were rendered by the chief of the party and the officers of the steamer Corwin greatly enhanced their value, and made them as acceptable to me, individually, as they were useful to the public service. Besides the hydrography in this section, Lieut. Comg. Craven executed that of Doboy sound, a reconnaissance of St. Simon's, and a re-survey of New York bay and harbor; of which notice has already been taken under their appropriate heads, in sections II and V. Such an amount of varied work of standard excellence has not before been executed by any coast survey party. When the season is sufficiently advanced for the purpose, these indefatigable officers will return to their labors on the Florida reef. The experience gained by Lieut. Comg. Craven in prosecuting the hydrography of this section, has enabled him to make judicious recommendations in regard to aids to navigation required on the eastern coast of Florida. These, on being communicated to me, were referred to the Lighthouse Board. The special localities and character of the aids recommended are stated in Appendix No. ~2. A hydrographic reconnaissance of Tampa bay was made in June last by Lieut. Comg. 0. H. Berryman, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the schooner Varina. A base was measured with a chain on Egmont key, (see Sketch F,) from the south side of the light-house towards the end of the key, and points determined by its use on both sides Of the bay to Fort Brooke and Old Tampa. The hydrography was commenced at Egmont key, and carried to Gadsden's Point, Fort Brooke, and Old Tampa. In reference to the use of the shores of Tampa bay as a railroad terminus, Lieut. Comg. Berryman says: "I have found an excellent harbor and site for a railroad depot, but the piers, I think, will . be unusually long ; yet, if the Company are desirous of making a substantial improvement, the length of the piers ought not to be a serious objection." "Eighteen feet water may be brought to the anchorage from sea; the anchorage is very spacious and deep, (having from four to live fathoms,) the holding ground excellent. The ground for the depot is perhaps twelve feet above the ordinary high tides, and three above the tide in the great gale of 1846. This is at the landing, and from this point the land rises very gently for five hundred metres, to about twenty feet. Pines and some black-jack are the only timber; the area is about four or five hundred acres, and piers will require to be four or five hundred metres long to reach fifteen feet water .. The anchorage is protected on the east by a middle ground several miles wide, having from eight to ten and twelve feet on it ; on all other sides by land and banks. This anchorage is on the west side of the bay, and just south of Mount Point." "The approach to this anchorage is by the main ship-channel, up to Mangrove point; thence, west-north westerly across the bay, around the north end of the great middle ground, and south, keeping in the deep water." "At high summer tides, perhaps a draught of twenty feet may be brought in." '' This reconnaissance has been very laborious to those employed.''

reach, the anchorage alluded to in my remarks respecting the terminus for a railroad on the west side of the bay." "Ballast point may be approached nearer than a mile with ten feet very soft bottom. Old Tampa may be reached with the same depth quite as near." "The sheet will best exhibit these approaches ; it will be furnished very shortly, and a tracing will be forwarded at once.'' The engraved sketch of this reconnaissance accompanies this report. (Sketch No. 31.) The instructions of Lieutenant Berryman included an examination of Charlotte harbor, but the season was too far advanced, when the niconnaissance of Tampa was completed, to permit its execution. The hydrography of Ocilla river and St. Andrew's bay by this party, and the observations made in the Gulf Stream, will be found noticed in their appropriate places. The special hydrography of the St. John's river, Florida, (Sketch F,) for the Engineer Department, was completed within the present season by the party of Lieut. Oomg. Richard Wainwright, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey. The services of that officer being required in the continued hydrography of Section III, and subsequently in New York harbor, the completion of the survey of the St. John's was assigned to Lieutenant Trenchard, of his party. With the schooner Guthrie, soundings were commenced on the 10th of April at Mayport Mills, connecting with the hydrographic work of Lieut. Comg. Craven, and lines were carried from thence to the upper limits of the triangulation at Winters' Point about two miles above Jacksonville. The soundings are embraced within about thirty miles of shore line; and nearly thirty thousand casts of the lead were made, over nine hundred angles observed, and about a thousand miles of sounding-line run. The bottom is generally sand and mud. The greatest depth of water found was eighty-two feet at a point off Jacksonville. In connecticm with the hydrography of the river, observations were made at eight current stations on and outside of the bar, a flood and an ebb being observed at each. Five temporary and seven permanent tidal stations were also occupied. At four of the latter simultaneous hourly observations were made for six days, and results obtained, which are reported to be satisfactory, the object being to trace minutely the passage of the tide-wave along the river. At the three stations, viz: Near Light-house, on the Bar, and at Fort George inlet, observations were made for four days, and full simultaneous tides were made sufficient, it was thought, to insure good results. "The tide-stations were located, with one exception, at the points marked upon the tracing accompanying the instructions. The exception was at Station B, the water being too shoal for the gauge, and a site upon the opposite side of the river in deeper water was selected as being more suitable." "The greatest rise and fall exhibited by the tidal observations is as follows: At A, Taylor's Mill, near Jacksonville, 1.20 foot; at B, near St. John░s Mills, 1. 75 foot; C, on Dames' Point, 2.47 feet; D, near St. John's Bluff, 3.83 feet; near the Light-house, 6 feet; on the Bar, 6.20 feet; and at Fort George inlet, 6.60 feet. "All the current observations on and outside of the bar have been completed. The stations marked upon the tracing accompanying instructions were occupied, as far as practicable, a flood and ebb being observed at each. Observations have been made, in all, at eight stations. The exposed character of the tidal and current stations near the bar caused the failure of the first attempt to procure simultaneous observations at them, and it was finally necessary to hire a ?teamboat to accomplish the object-thus delaying the completion of the work in the :first mstance, and, finally, considerably increasing the expenses.'' . The season not affording time for a complete survey of Cumberland sound and St. Mary's river, a hydrographic reconnaissance was ordered, in connection with the triangulation of Assistant A. W. Evans, before referred to. This was executed by Lieutenant Trenchard, U.S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, detailed from the party of Lieut. Comg. Wainwright. This reconnaissance will be followed up by a complete survey. Its results can on1y be considered

approximate. (Sketch F.) Lieutenant Trenchard says, in his report: "The least water found upon the bar at ordinary low tide was thirteen feet. Eight feet can be carried through the Swash or Cumberland channel. The former ship (now the south) channel is nearly closed, and is nsed only by steamers of light draught in mild weather." " Over twenty feet can be carried up Amelia river to Yellow Bluff, and there is good anchorage off the town of Fernandina, in from :five to seven fathoms water, soft muddy bottom. Nearly four thousand casts of the lead were made in from one to thirteen fathoms water, 'and over eighty miles of soundings run. The tide-gauge used for the reduction of soundings was established at Fort Clinch wharf." "High and low water was observed at Fort Clinch, Fernandina, and the town of St. Mary's, which exhibited no difference in the rise and fall of tide, or any in the time of high and low water at the two former places, the rise and fall being eight feet. The иtime of high water at Fort Clinch was thirty-five minutes earlier and low water forty-five minutes earlier than at St. Mary's, the rise and fall being 7.35 feet." Tides.-The attempt to observe the tides at Indian River inlet, on the western coast of the Florida peninsula, having last year failed from circumstances stated in my report, Mr. Gustavus Wiirdemana was sent there in April to establish a self-registering gauge and to obtain observations for at least two lunations. This duty he satisfactorily performed, and the results have been sent to the office and reduced. A self-registering gauge was established at Indian Key by Lieutenant James Totten, U. S. Army, and Mr. L. E. Tansill, placed in charge of it. This gives an intermediate point between Cape Florida and Key West for the study of the motion of the tide-wave along the reefs and , keys. The gauge was kept working for two lunations, and the results have been returned to the Coast Survey office and reduced. Cor1wral Thompson, of the Engineer company, established a self-registering gauge at the Tortugas, and observed during two lunations; this completes the general group of stations for the Florida channel. The tides at Tortugas resemble very much those at Key West, having the same large diurnal irregularity. Those at Indian Key are intermediate in their character between the tides at Cape .Florida and at Key West. All the observations made in this region have now been reduced by the tidal party at the Coast Survey office, and the results put in the form of tide tables and furnished to me for the discussion of the co-tidal lines of the Gulf of Mexico, now in progress. Beacons.-Beacona or signals intended to be permanent for the use of navigators were placed upon fourteen points of the Florida Reef, under the dirlXi;ion of Lieutenant James Totten, U. S. Army, assistant in the Coast Survey, and with means furnished by the Light-house Board, by whom also the plans for the work were approved before my instructions were issued. The localities at which the signals were erected are as follows: Beginning at the westward and passing eastward along the reef, (see Sketch No. 30,) 1, Eastern Sambo; 2, American shoals; 3, Alligator reef; 4, Croker's reef; 5, Conch reef; 6, Pickle's reef; 'T, French reef; 8, Grecian shoals; 9, Turtle reef; 10, Pacific reef; 11, Ajax reef; 12, Long reef; 13, Triangle reef; 14, Fowey rocks. There yet remains one to be placed at the " Elbow," between Grecian shoals and Turtle reef. These signals or beacons, placed on the most projecting and dangerous points of the Florid& reef, are generally from four to six miles from the keys, and within half a mile of the usual limit of the Gulf Stream. "In the day-time they cannot fail to attract the attention of careful navigators. and to warn them of their proximity to danger." They stand in four feet or less of water. Close to the eastward the water is very deep. " A vessel approaching from the seaward may sail within a few hundred yards of any of these beacons ; but it wou1d always be prudent, and particularly in very light or very heavy weather, to give them a wide berth. In light weather it often happens, especially after long

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

81

easterly blows, that the force and direction of the Gulf Stream sets across the reef, and then vessels are imperceptibly carried amid the dangers, although the course steered should, if made, carry them outside of all trouble." ""\Vhen this misfortune befalls the master of a vessel, it frequently occurs that the wind proves too light to draw his ship out of danger, and a few moments' indecision then is fatal. "'\Vhen he finds himself to the west of any one of the signals, or the signal bearing east from the vessel, he may be sure that he is between the reef aud the keys, and consequently surrounded by shoals and dangerous rocks. In all such cases of danger, as above mentioned, unless perfectly acquainted with his whereabouts, be should lose no time in coming to anchor until he can ascertain which is the safe course to pursue.'' The report of Lieutenant Totten (Appendix No. 16) contains a full description with references to a drawing (Sketch No. 30) of the mode of constructing the beacons, of the mode of distinguishing them, and of the localities, with remarks in relation to them of great interest to navigators. These signals are piles of wrought and cast iron, thirty-six feet high, inserted below in the coral reef, and surmounted by an iron cylinder of lattice work, to render it more readily Yisible from a distance. "Three colors have been used in painting each signal, so as to make them as striking to the eye as possible. For this purpose white, red, and black have been chosen as the most conspicuous ; and in painting the signals, these three colors have been so combined that no two adjacent beacons have the same colors upon the like parts." "By examination of the colors alone, on approaching any one of these signals, the master of a vessel may ascertain his latitude and longitude with tolerable certainty; and if the letter in the vane can be made out, then there can be no mistake whatever." The letters by which the beacons are distinguished follow each other in order from the westward, as fully described in Lieut. Totten's report. I am satisfied, after examining these signals, that some mode of distinction other than that by the letter-vane should be used; perhaps a solid made by the rotation of a letter about a vertical axis, such as is described in a note by me to the preliminary Light-House Board, and published in the report of 1852, might answer the purpose as a distinguishing mark. The whole duty of determining the points for these beacons, of making the plans for them, of superintending their construction, and placing, was executed by Lieut. Totten with care, Bkill, and economy. Doubts in regard to the specimens of bottom formerly collected in and near Key Biscayne bay and Cape Florida having arisen from the examinations of Professor Bailey, Lieut. Totten made a well-selected collection from characteristic localities while engaged in the vicinity in connecting the Key Biscayne base with the main triangulation. These, with the descriptive report oflocalities, &c., accompanying, have been submitted to Professor Bailey. SECTION VIL-FROM ST. JOSEPH'S BAY TO MOBILE BAY, INCLUDING PART OF THE CO.A.ST OF FLORIDA AKD ALA.BA.MA.. (SKETCH G.) This is the first year that an appropriation has been granted for this section, which includes a difficult part of the coast, and where progress must necessarily be slow. Three parties have been at work-one in determining the astronomical position of a point in St. Andrew's bay by its latitude and difference of longitude from Pascagoula, in magnetic observations at the same point, in measuring a preliminary base, and in a secondary triangulation of St. Andrew's entrance and bay, and part of its dependencies ; a second, in the topography of the same bay ; and a third, in the hydrography of Ocilla river and entrance, St . .Andrew's bay, and Cedar keys, and in running deep-sea lines in the Gulf. Tidal observations were also made at St. Mark's. A preliminary chart of Cedar keys and sketch of Ocilla river have been drawn, and that of

St. Andrew's bay nearly completed. Cedar keys and approaches, as preliminary, and Ocilla river have been engraved, and Cedar keys and approaches, as finished, is in progress . .Astronornical observations.-Observations for latitude with the zenith telescope on eightythree pairs of stars, and for azimuth and magnetic declination, were made at St. Andrew's (see Sketch No. 35) by Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns, of the party of Assistant Gerdes, and ninety-five transists were observed for local time and difference of longitude between S~. Andrew's and Pascagoula. These were conducted during the progress of the triangulation of St. Andrew's bay. The observations for latitude were made with the zenith telescope (No. 1) of Troughton & Simms; those for azimuth with a twelve-inch Gambey theodolite (C. S. No. 16,) observing direct and by reflection in mercury; those for time, in connection with the foregoing, with the transit, (C. S. No. 9,) by Troughton & Simms; and the declinations, by a Jones declinometer, (C. S. No. 2.) Triangulation.-The triangulation of St. Andrew's bay (see Sketch G) has been executed by the party of Assistant F. H. Gerdes. Operations were begun on the 17th of December, and by the 17th of the following March the work was completed by a system of triangles extending over the sound, including the various small islands adjacent, and embracing St. Andrew's city, together with East and Northwest bays. A new base was measured with iron wires on the north side of St. Andrew's sound, upon which the secondary triangulation rests. This was connected with the tertiary base measured last year with a chain, and gave the small difference of 0.2 of a metre between the two measurements. This work was executed by SubAssistant J. G. Oltmanns, under the instructions of Mr. Gerdes. The following are the statistics of the work: Number of signals erected and secured................................................ 36 Number of signals occupied as stations................................................ 34 Number of signals and objects observed on . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . ... . .. . .. .. .. . . . . . . . 67 Number of angles measured............................................................. 195 Number of observations ................................................................... 1,176 Number of triangles calculated......................................................... 63 Area of triangulation, in square miles................................................ 55 The instrument used was a six-inch Gambey theodolite, (C.

Topography .-A plane-table survey of St. Andrew's bay and sound, including St. Andrew's city, has been executed by the party of Assistant George D. Wise. This work was commenced on the 10th of January, and completed on the 22d of April. Within that period Assistant Wise was also engaged in furnishing shore-line and points for the hydrographic party engaged at St. Andrew's bay. His report of the season in this section contains the following summary of the work accomplished by the topographical party : 27 Miles of Gulf coast surveyed............................................................. Miles of road-line surveyed............................................................... 17! Miles of shore-line surveyed............................................................. 130 52 Area, in square miles...................................................................... "St. Andrew's bay is a very beautiful sheet of water, easy of access, and sheltered from all winds. The vicinity is considered remarkably healthy, having never been visited by the cholera or yellow fever, and is much frequented during the summer months by inhabitants from the interior, who resort to its shores for bathing, hunting, and fishing. The shores are sandy and the water bold. The soil is said to be peculiarly adapted to the culture of the grape." The map of St Andrew's bay and sound, 20 ~ 0 0 , drawn by A88ista.nt Wise is now in the ' archives of the Coast Survey Office. Mr. _Wise was engaged during the summer in topographical work, noticed under Section UI, and will shortly return to resume the plane-table work on the western coast of Florida.

Hydrography.-The hydrography of this section has been in charge of I,ieut. Comg. 0. H. Berryman, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, commanding the schooner Varina, and has consisted of a survey of St. Andrew's entrance and part of the bay, of Ocilla river and entrance, and of part of Cedar keys. Off-shore soundings have also been made on a line from the Tortugas to Pensacola, and from Cedar keys to Pensacola. The work of the same party in Tampa bay belongs to the preceding section, (Section VI,) and the soundings for temperature in the Gulf Stream, by this party, have been noticed. The limits of the work of St. Andrew's bay are shown in Sketch G; they include the entrance and approaches, and the bay to St. Andrew's City. In his report upon this hydrography, Lieut. Comg. Berryman observes: "In the survey of St. Andrew's bay, I did not find as much water on the bar of the main entrance as I had been led to expect-sixteen feet being all that can be carried over at low tide ; but as the coast is rather bold, and the bottom clean sand, alterations may be expected in the bars and channels." "St. Andrew's bay is a :fine sheet of water, but the draught which can pass the bar cannot be carried more than three or four miles, owing to a shoal which extends from Davis's Point entirely around by Saddle Hills, and then towards the small inlet by the west end of Hurricane island. No more than thirteen feet can be found on this shoal in the deepest part; it is, however, very narrow, and after crossing it three fathoms will be found, and increasing to as much as eight in proceeding to St. Andrew's City. Good anchorage may be found, after getting over the bar and inside the banks, by hauling to the westward under ' Saddle Hills,' which form the east end of the 'Hurricane island,' with good holding ground in three fathoms. All the shoals can be seen very plainly. In windy weather, from S. W., the surf breaks nearly across the bar." "The entrance by the east channel, around the west end of Crooked island, has a little more water than the main pass, but the communication with the west part of the bay is obstructed by a bulk-head, running in a N. W. direction. from the middle ground quite to the shore, of hard white sand; and a passage about forty feet wide, with ten feet water, lies between the middle and the bulk-head." "Very little commerce is carried on here, there being only one or two saw-mills near the head of the bay." The statistics for the survey of this bay are as follows : 11 Number of stations occupied ............................................... .,.........

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

"The Ocilla river entrance is about ten miles east of St. Mark's light-house, and is fronted by a labyrinth of sand and oyster banks, which extend several miles off seaward, and arc bare at low tides. The channel winds among these banks very crooked and narrow towards the mouth of the river, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico, between two extensive marshes, entirely overflowed at high tide." " Vessels drawing five feet of water may enter this river at high tide, but they cannot swing to or around their anchorage, owing to the very narrow channel. The mouth of the river is about eight hundred metres wide, and grows narrower as you ascend. Some rocks may be found in the channel-way, and about two and a half or three miles from its entrance, a ledge crosses from one side to the other ; none but boats can pass it." "Large quantities of live-oak, ready for shipment, line the shore after getting above the marshes." "Vessels bound for this river must obtain a pilot at St. Mark's, and then they will have great difficulty in finding their way into the entrance. The whole should be staked out like St. Mark's." The hydrography of Cedar keys and approaches was continued from that of last year, and occupied the time of the party until it was necessary to proceed to St. Andrew's bay. The work lies west and north of the channel No. 4, (see Sketch No. 33, and Sketch G No. 2, Report 1852,) as far as Derrick key, and east and south from Snake key towards the "Oyster reefs." Lieut. Comg. Berryman states that the hydrography resembles that previously executed by him at this locality, there being a series of fiats, with channels between them, leading to the passes in the Oyster reefs. The following statistics of the work are given : Number of soundings.............................................................. 46,346 '' double angles......................................................... 322 " theodolite angles..................................................... 20'T Miles of lines of soundings ................................................ ,...... 356 39 Area, in square miles (statute)................................................... 2 Number of tidal stations.......................................................... Stations occupied.................................................................... 5 5 Stations established ............................. , ... ,.............................. In passing from the Tortugas to Pensacola, Lieut. Comg. Berryman ran a line of deep-sea soundings, about latitude 26░ N., longitude 84░ W., to latitude 30░ N., longitude 87░ W., taking also the temperature at the surface of the sea, at twenty fathoms depth, and at the bottom. The depths varied from ninety fathoms to three hundred and twenty, the greatest depth found, and thence to sixteen fathoms. The figure on the bottom of the line run is a gradually increasing slope from ten fathoms in forty miles to forty fathoms in twenty miles, with finally a sudden steep pitch from two hundred fathoms to three hundred and twenty in depth in twenty miles. .A. corresponding steep rise on the other side gave three hundred and twenty fathoms to one hundred and sixty fathoms in forty-five miles, and a varying slope, averaging about 1.6 fathoms to the mile. The surface temperatures were q11ite irregular, varying generally, however, from 68░ .4 to 'Tl 0 .4. These, at twenty fathoms, were quite uniform, varying, omitting one observation, from 67░ to 69░, on the whole line. The temperatures at the bottom, allowing for irregular observations, were lower as the bottom was deeper, passing from 66░ at forty fathoms depth of bottom, to about 56░ at three hundred and twenty fathoms. The observations were mado on the 31st of December and the 1st and 2d of January, and the temperature of the air, recorded at the same time with the temperature of the water, varied from 60░.9 to 73░.4. The connection of the deep pocket, which Lieutenant Berryman crossed, with the solution of the curious problems relating to the motion of the tide-wave in the Gulf, will probably hereafter appear. Tides.-Tidal observations were made at St. Mark's with a Saxton self-registering tide-gauge, by Corporal Thompson, of the engineer company, for two lunations. The tides are similar to those of Cedar keyli 1 being half-day tidiii, with a large diurnal inequality, or difference between

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

85

the morning and afternoon tides. This difference amounted, in extreme cases, for high water, to 1. 3 foot in height. There is so great a change in the tidal phenomena between St. George's and Oedar keys, that other stations may yet have to be introduced when the minuter investigations of the motion of the tide-wave are undertaken.

SECTION VIII.-FROM MOBILE POINT TO VERMILIO~ BAY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF MISSISSIPPI A~D PART OF LOUISIANA. (SKETCH H.)
The work of this section has made unusually good progress. The primary triangulation, which has been stationary for some years for want of means to supply a party for its execution, has been resumed, and the secondary triangulation and topography of Chandeleur sound and islands has been in vigorous progress. The latitude and longitude of a point in Atchafalaya bay have been determined, and the triangulation of the bay from Point au Fer to Cote Blanche bay has been executed. The topography has followed this closely, and extends from the point just named to include Belle isle, at the mouth of the Atchafalaya river. Magnetic observations have been made at Belle isle. The topography of the neck between Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain has been executed. The hydrography of M; sissippi sound has been carried westward nearly to Pitcher point, including the back bay of Biloxi, and the entrance between Horn and Ship islands. Special deep-sea lines in the Gulf of Mexico have been run; hydrographic reconnaissances of the entrance to Vcrmilion bay, and that of Calcasieu river, coast of Louisiana, have been made. The drawing of Sheet No. 1 of Mississippi sound has been finished during the season, and that of Sheet No. 2, and of Biloxi bay, has been in progress. The engraving of sheets of Mobile bay and Mississippi sound, No. 1, is now in progross. Triangulation and astronomical observations.-Two triangulation parties have been employed in this section during the greater part of the season; one under charge of Assistant F. H. Gerdes, and the other of Assistant J. E. Hilgard. Sub-Assistants J. G. Oltmanns and Stephen Harris volunteered to remain in this section during the summer, to advance the main triangulation and work of the Chandeleur islands, which had fallen behind the actual wants of the other parts of the work in this locality. The zeal and devotion to the service of these young gentlemen, and of Messrs. J. S. Harris and R. Halter, aids, who are with them, deserve great commendation. It has ex.posed them to one of the most violent hurricanes which has occurred on this part of the coast for many years, of which the vicinity of Mississippi City appears to have been the seat of greatest violen::e. The uneasiness which was felt in regard to the exposure of these officers and their men in the small schooners of the survey has been happily disappointed-intelligence having been received of their safety. Assistant Gerdes was occupied on the Hudson (Section II) during last summer, and in inking the topographical sheets resulting from the season's survey; Sub-Assistant Oltmanns, in the meanwhile, in the schooner Gerdes, taking up the triangulation of St. Andrew's bay, (Section VII,) as already noticed. Observations for time having been made at Pascagoula, the chronometers were transported in ~he schooner Gerdes to Atchafalaya bay, to obtain the difference of longitude, (see Sketches G and H.) An astronomical station was established on Deer island, at the mouth of the Atchafalaya river, at which latitude observations were taken with the zenith telescope, (C. S. No. I,) and time observations made with the transit, (C. S. No. 9.) The magnetic declination was observed also at the same station. " One of the difficulties encountered was in the selection of a good site for a base, and it was found impossible to employ in tb.e measurement anything but a chain, as the ground consists

86

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

entirely of marsh. A line was selected at Point au Fer, and connects with the work, as will be seen by reference to Sketch H. "A better line can be measured with the rods and trestles on Cote Blanche bay, which will be in the middle of the work." 'l. is base is, therefore, to be considered as altogether preliminary. It has been seen at St. Andrew's that Mr. Gerdes's chaining may be safely relied upon for such purposes. . The triangulation extends from Point au Fer (Sketch H) to Cote Blanche bay, and inclUdes an area of about two hundred and eighty square miles. "It consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary triangles, of very good shape, fulfilling all the necessary conditions. The primary lines vary from ten to fifteen miles in length, and all of them have been observed on sufficiently for a preliminary survey." The statiatics of this work are reported as follows: Transit observations for time, at Pascagoula and Deer island......................... 161 Observations for latitude, (pairs of stars).................................................... 86 Observations for azimuth on Polaris, at Point au Fer light............................ 60 Observations for magnetic declination....................................................... 225 Triangulation stations, number of............................................................. 17 The usual books and records were duly prepared and turned in with this work. In conjunction with Assistant Hilgard, Mr. Gerdes re-measured a portion of the D~uphine island base, to verify the marks there, which bad in part been disturbed in the hurricane of 1852. This work has been satisfactorily accomplished, and a new terminus marked for the west end of the base, derived from the marks of the old measurement. The result of this work has been very gratifying, as but for the care taken during the measurement in 1847, to mark intermediate points along the base, and to retain even the occasional markings undisturbed, the west end of this base might have been lost, the hurricane having obliterated or disturbed the monument, and the marks connected with it. At the close of this work Mr. Gerdes returned to Section II, where he has been employed in New York bay and harbor for the Commissioners. (See Section II.) Sub-Assistant Oltmanns, in the schooner Gerdes, took up the triangulation and topography of the Chandeleur islands, and to avoid the necessity of waiting for the connection of the triangulation on the north, measured, in conjunction with Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, a preliminary base on one of the divisions of Chandeleur island, (see Sketch H,) and has made a secondary triangulation for connecting the islands of the group with ea.ch other and with the main. He reports, under date of August 22d: "I have laid out and measured nearly all the angles of a secondary triangulation from the Chandeleur, north end, towards the south some eighteen or twenty miles, and to the westward, embracing those of the Chandeleur islands, geneially called the Freemason Keys. From these a connection with the main land may be eitablished.'' "The angles were measured with the twelve-inch Gambey theodolite, (C. S. No. Hi,) by two or three sets of six repetitions, direct and reversed, and the triangles close very well, 2". '1 being the largest correction for any single triangle." "The atmosphere is generally, except very early in the morning, so hee.ted, that observing with any degree of accuracy becomes impossible, and in only two instances have I been able to observe in the afternoon." Much of the result of the patience and labor of the party was destroyed by the disastrous hurricane of September 16th of the present year. Its effect on the immediate site of his work is thus described by Mr. Oltmanns: " The beach on which the base was measured is entirely washed away, and at the north end I found, instead of a sand-bank from ten to twelve feet high, eight feet of water. Only fouT or five posts throughout the line remain to show even the situation of the base. Nearly all the stations were disturbed in such a way as to require the re--erection of signals."

Proper measures have been taken for restoring the signals, and for repeating the observations rendered necessary by their displacement. The party is still engaged in this duty, and satisfactory progress in its accomplishment has been reported. The continuation of the primary triangulation of this section on Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds was entrusted to Assistant J. E. Hilgard, who also had charge of work connected with the publication of the Coast Survey records and results, which required his presenee in Washington. In his absence the party is in charge of Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, with Mr. J. S. Harris as aid. Mr. Hilgard, after reporting his preparations for work in December last, says: "After erecting tripods and scaffolds at all the principal stations, (the weather being too hazy for observation,) I awaited opportunities for measuring angles, but such was the prevalence of fog and smoke, that up to February 12th I succeded in measuring completely the angles at only one station, (East Pascagoula,) and partially at two others. At that time, conceiving that the work could not be carried on to advantage during the ensuing two months, I discharged the hands, and entrusted my aid, Mr. J. S. Harris, to occupy and measure the angles at station 'Mississippi City,' while I proceeded to Washington, to confer with you in regard to the publication of records and results." "I rejoined my party in Section VIII on the 12th of April, and by May 3d completed the measurement of angles in the quadrilateral East Pascagoula, Horn Island east, Horn Island W!Ylt, and BeUefontaine. Mr. Harris had succeeded in getting a great number of measures of the angles at 'Mississippi City.' At that time I was joined by 1\Ir. Stephen Harris, who was to continue the work after my return to Washington. We proceeded to Lake Borgne and Pontchartrain, examined the condition of the signals, and replaced those that had decayed." " Observations at Rigolets light were completed, and those at Grand island partially finished by the close of May, and the annexed sketch shows by red lines what remained to be done at that date. I left my party on May 24th, leaving Mr. Stephen Harril!l in charge, with detailed instructions for the continuation of the work." Up to October ht, the date of Mr. Hilgard's report, six primary stations had been occupied, and two hundred and twenty-one angles measured with the 10-inch (No. 74) and 12-inch (No. 37) Gambey theodolites. The progress made is shown on Sketch H. In the intervals, when observations on long lines were less practicable, the secondary trian~ gulation in Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain was pushed by the party, and hopes are entertained of its completion as far as New Orleans before the close of the present year. Between the middle of May and the end of August, eight stations were occupied, a.nd three hundred and thirty-five angles measured by six repetitions of each, (Sketch H.) "Much delay and additional work was caused by the loss of some of the station-marks. The instability of the shores in this region makes the preservation of stations a matter of great difficulty, which it is now proposed to meet by the use of iron screw-piles." T?pography.-The three localities where topographical work has been in progress in this section are: Atchafalaya bay, Louisiana; between Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain; and the Chandeleur islands ; the :first, by Assistant F. H. Gerdes ; the second, by Assistant R. M. Bache; and the third, by Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns, (see Sket~h H.) ~и Gerdes' survey at ..A.tchafalaya, occupies the four sheets marked on Sketch R, including Pomt au Fer, a.nd the ea.stern side of Atchafalaya bay and Belle isle. The sheets give, together, rather more than one hundred miles of shore-line, and embrace an area of about seventy square miles. и Su~.A.ssistant Oltmanns followed, under the direction of Assistant Hilgard, his own triangula.t1o_n of the Chandeleur islands by a topographical survey, beginning at port Chandeleur and :tending southward, including the Chandeleur islands, to a point half a mile below the south se, and the north of Freemason keys to Point Hope, (Sketch H.) This work comprised one

E8

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

hundred and twenty-six miles of shore-line; but in consequence of changea caused by the recent hurricane, already referred to, a re-examination will be necessary before the return of the topographical sheets. The proper directions have been given for this purpose. Mr. Oltmanns observes: "The southeast and south wind raised the tide quite over the islands, and, as I actually measured at the time, there was a current of six and a quarter miles per hour. As a natural consequence, the shape and size of the Chandeleur islands_ have undergone material alteration. The changes are small at the north end, but become' more frequent and considerable to the southward." Mr. Oltmanns is still engaged in the revision rendered necessary by the circumstances just mentioned, and the shore-line will at once be re-surveyed where it has changed, so as to be in ~oper condition for the execution of the hydrography. The topography of the neck of land between Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain (see Sketch H,) has been in part executed by the party of Assistant R. M. Bache. His party was organized in February, but in consequence of delays in the necessary repairs of the vessel employed in the work, operations in the field were not commenced until the end of March. The sheet of the season embraces the eastern part of the Rigolets and the adjacent shore of Lake Borgne. The party remained in the :field until the 12th of June, at which time the survey comprised thirty-four miles of shore-line, within an area of about seven square miles. Assistant Bache has been engaged in office-work since his return, and will shortly resume the topography of this section. Hydrography.-The hydrography has been continued by the party of Lieut. Comg. B. F. Sands, U.S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Walker. Before resuming his duties afloat, the office-work of the last season was closed up, consisting of the plotting and inking of his chart of soundings off Horn and Ship islands, from the meridian of Round island nearly to Cat island, scale 20t 00 , and of lines of soundings run between Pensacola and Mississippi delta, and of one run south of the delta in search of a reputed shoal, scale ~000 . The hydrographic note-books and journals were also duplicated and verified. The regular hydrography of the Mississippi sound was advanced from a line between the west end of Horn island and Belfontaine, completing the sound westward to within two miles of Pitcher point, and including the back bay of Biloxi and the entrance between Horn and Ship islands. Lieut. Oomg. Sands remarks: '' We were much interrupted by foggy and hazy weather ; but such time was profitably employed in repairing damages sustained in the several gales which we had encountered in the month of January.'' After closing this part of the hydrography, an examination was made of the channel between Pelican and Dauphine islands, which a few years ago was used by the steamboats plying between Mobile and New Orleans. This channel was found to have but five feet of water in it, and about thirty yards in width, " entirely impracticable for vessels, and changed by every gale from the southward of east or west." Lieut. Comg. Sands continues: " The little bay between Pelican and the east side of Dauphine island was not materially changed, and is still a good anchorage for vessels that can enter the channel at the south end of Pelican island, where twelve feet can be carried in." A reconnaissance was made of the entrances to Vermilion bay and to Calcasieu river, Louisiana, (Sketch No. 40,) by Lieut. C?mg. Sands, and sketches were furnished to the Light-House Board, at whose request the work was executed. These are appended to this report. Of the bar of Vermilion bay, Lieut. Comg. Sands reports, that "none but very light-draught vessels can get over it;" and of that of Calcasieu, that "it has five and a half feet at low water, shoaling gradually to that depth from three fathoms, and deepening on the inside to twelve and fourteen feet in the river."

On his passage out to Section VIII, Lieut. Comg. Sands began a line of deep-sea soundings
and temperatures, intending to pass from the northwest passage out of Key vVest harbor to the delta of the Mississippi (Sketch No. 38,) but was interrupted hy a gale, on the abatement of

which the line was resumed. Unfortunately the information in regarcl to depths over two hundred and fifty fathoms is incomplete, and that depth is soon reachecl from either end of the line. The facts in regard to temperature are, however, interesting, showing that late in December, while the temperature of the air was from 61░ to 73░ Fahrenheit, surface temperatures in the Gulf were found as high as 77░ Fahrenheit; and that at a depth of about two hundred and thirty fathoms, the lowest temperature measured was 50░ Fahrenheit. Other interesting lines of deep-sea soundings were run by Lieut. Comg. Sands: one from Ship Island shoal to the delta of the Mississippi gave no depth greater than thirty fathoms; a second, from the eastern side of the delta to near Pensacola, gave, after finally leaving the delta, no depth less than thirty-seven fathoms, being, in fact, well on the plateau before remarked in this region; a third, from Pensacola southward, shows that the depths increase rapidly at a moderate distance from the shore, compared with the corresponding increase further to the westward. Sections prepared from this work will be found on Sketch No. 38. The remarkable work executed by Lieut. Comg. Sands in the Gulf Stream haR already been noticed. (See Gulf Stream.) A fourth line of soundings was run from Mobile entrance towards Key 'West. (See Sketch No. 38.) In summing up his season's hydrography, Lieut. Comg. Sands remarks: "The work of the party, with all the disadvantages of bad weather, as will be seen by the following statistics, is nearly double that of any previous season, which is mainly attributable to being well officered and manned, enabling me to take advantage of every hour of favorable weather with a strong force." The amount of work of different kinds and in different localities is thus stated :

A line of soundings was run across the entrance to the .Mississippi delta by Lieut. Comg. E. J. De Haven, carrying depths from nine to forty-two fathoms. An apparatus for bringing up specimens of the bottoms has been contrived by Lieut. Comg. Sands, a description and :figure of which are given in Appendix No. 56, and Sketch No. 55. It is quite different in form from any of those previously used in the survey, and practice alone can decide in regard to the several merits of the plans for different kinds of bottom. In speaking of one of his lines of deep-sea soundings in the Gulf, Lieut. Comg. Sands observes: "These deep-sea soundings have enabled me to test satisfactorily my specimen-tube, a plan of which I have .submitted to you. It never failed to bring up a specimen of the bottom except upon one o_ccasion, when the lead and specimen-tube ca::ne up so battered and bruised as to prove conclusively that it bad struck rock." 12

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

vVe arc indebted to Heutenant Comg. Sands for the arrangement of a gas-pipe tripod for signals on shoals, and for beacons-a description of which is given in Appendix No. 60, and a drawing in Sketch No. 54. I extract from his report the remarks in relation to the tests to which this tripod has been subjected: "One was placed, in May, 1853~ on a shoal off the west end of Horn island, in the entrance between Horn and Ship islands, a situation exposed to heavy seas from the Gl,llf of Mexico, and upon resuming my work this season I found it unmoved-more firmly :fixed even than when first placed, after a lapse of two years." "The success of the experiment induced me to place it in the midst of the breakers, on Dog Island bar, in the same inlet, as a signal to be used in my hydrographic work, and I left it there to serve as a beacon for vessels navigating Mississippi sound, as the. bar is close upon tho southern side of the deep channel running along to the northward of Ship and Horn islands." Light-ho'IJ.ses.-The reports of Lieut. Comg. Sands, of reconnaissances made of Vermilion bay and Calcasieu river, at the request of the Light-house Board, are given in the Appendix Nos. 80 and 81. The sketches resulting are shown on Plate No. 40. I have already noticed the work under the head of hydrography in this section. Lieut. Comg. Sands recommends the discontinuance of the light at the entrance of Vermilion bay, and reports against the erection of a light-house at Calcasieu river. SECTION IX.-FROM VERMILION BAY TO THE BOUNDARY, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF LOUISIASA AHD THAT OF TEXAS. (SKETCH I.) The progress of the survey has been interrupted in this section by causes which could not be foreseen, and which will be referred to in giving an account of the operations. A triangulation and topographical party, and a hydrographic party, with two vessels, have been at work during part of the season just past. The details in this section are so few tha.t progress is rapid in proportion to the time expended, but not in proportion to the means, in consequence, chiefly, of the expense of supplies, and the difficulties in regard to transportation. Steps have already been taken to secure the early arrival of the parties in this section at their several stations, and a topographical party will be added to those sent there last year. The engraving of the map of the entrance to the Rio Grande has been completed. Triangulation.-The triangulation of the coast of Texas, southward and westward from the head of Matagorda bay, has been extended during the season by the party of Assistant S. A. Gilbert. At the close of the last season, Assistant Gilbert made a plane-table survey of part of Cape Small, which is referred to in Section I. In consequence of unavoidable delays in receiving instruments and equipage for the party, operations were not commenced on the coast of Texas until the middle of March. The triangulation covers the upper part of Matagorda bay, from .its eastern extremity to stations near Palacios bay, a lineal extent of about twenty-eight miles, (see Sketch I.) Assistant Gilbert selected ten princip1'1 stations, eight of which were occupied in the measurement of forty-four angles. The series of triangles comprises an area of about two hundred square miles. The following description is given by Mr. Gilbert of the character of the country over which his survey has extended : " With the exception of the immediate vicinity of the Colorado river it is prairie ; much of it is low and wet, liable to be flooded from the bay during very high water. The woods along the Colorado are very dense, mostly cotton-wood and willow. The river empties into the bay by two mouths, but for several miles back it is a perfect labyrinth of channels, bayous, and islands. There is but little trade in or out of it as yet, but it is being improved so as to be made navigable at all stages of water. The entrance to both mouths is very shoal (about three feet) over a bar of hard sand p,nd shells. Matagorda is a pleasant town of about three hundred inhabitants ; it was almost demolished by the Sep~mber tornado, but has been nearly rebuilt."

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

91

'l'opography.-In connection with the triangulation~ the party of Assistant Gilbert executed the tL1pography of the western shore of Matagorda 11ay from "Seven Mile Station" above Matagorda, southward, to include the town, and the mouth of the Colorado riYCr (Sketch I.) In that extent, about twenty-four miles of shore-line were determined, and eighteen miles of roads. The area embraced in the topography is about eighteen 1Hpiare miles. Assistant Gilbert mentions, in terms of high praise, the efficient services of Mr. Malcolm Seaton, attached to his party. On his return from this section, in the middle of June, Mr. Gilbert waR engaged in his officework, but later in the season, on a pressing call for his services, took the field in Section II, where he will be engaged until the usual time of making preparations for return to the southern work. Hydrography.-The party of Lieut. Oomg. E. J. De Haven, U. S. Navy, in the schooners Arago and Belle, has been engaged in continuing the in-shore hydrography of the coast of Texas, southward from the enirance to Galveston bay, and that of the upper part of GalveEton and Turtle bay, which is now completed (Sketch I.) Work was commenced on the 21st of January and continued until the 15th of l\1ay, at a good rate of progress. At the last mentioned date, while the party was engaged in landing materials for the erection of a signal at San Bernard station, the Arago was set on shore by the force of the current. The damage received and the advance of the season induced Lieut. Comg. De Haven to return to the North, after having temporarily repaired the vessel. The report in detail of the disaster to the Arago is given in Appendix No. 67. rrhe in-11hore soundings were carried from above Bolivar Point, southward and westward along the coast, nearly to Bernard station, a distance of about fifty miles (Sketch I.) The soundings in Turtle bay were made in the schooner Belle. Whole number of soundings ..................и................................. 20,865 ~files run in sounding............................................................ 1,014 Angles observed................................................................... 1,080 Tides.-Tidal observations were made for correcting the sounding at Bolivar Point, at San Luis, and at Velasco-the establishment of stations outside of the bars being reported as impracticable. The observations for the progress of the tide-wave in the Gulf of Mexico have been completed in this section. Light-houses.-An examination for a light-house site at Gallinipper Point, Lavacca bay, was made by Lieut. Oomg. De Haven, and has been reported. (See Appendix No. 82.) Several aids to navigation in Matagorda bay, recommended by him, are stated in Appendix No. 73.

XI. -CO.A.ST OF CALIFORNIA, AND OF OREGON AND WASHINGTON TERRITORIES. (SKETCHES J .AND K.)

The regular operations of the suney have heen succesafully carried forward during the past year in both these sections, as the details in the following pages will serve to shgw. The primary triangulation north and south of San Francisco, and the tertiary system along the coast connected with it, has advanced satisfactorily. The triangulation near Santa Barbara, and of the Western islands, has also made progress. The triangulation of Port Townsend harbor, of Admiralty inlet, and of Puget's sound, has been carried on from a base measured near Port Townsend. The topography in connection with each one of these triangulations has followed them closely. That of the coast between San Francisco and Monterey has been nearly completed, so as to join the two places. .A.nacapa, part of Santa Cruz, and the coast between Point Duma and Buenaventura, have been surveyed . . ~he hydrography of San Francisco entrance, and bay proper, has been completed within the limits necessary for a complete chart of the bay. Some interesting developments have been made in the course of thia survey. The hydrogra.phy of the coaat near Point Duma, and of the

REPORT OF TlIE SUPJl:RINTENDBNT

"\Vestern islands, has been in progress. A dangerous rock on Cortez bank has been determined in position, as also a rock on the immediate coast near Point San Pedro, upon which the steamer "Uncle Sam" struck. (Appendix Nos. 18, 19.) Light-house examinations have been made at several points. The investigation of the tides has been continued, and some interesting results in regard to earthquake waves have been observed. The co-tidal lines of the Pacific coast have been approximately established. ' The preliminary chart of San Francisco entrance, map of south Farrallon island, and Alden's reconnaissance, northern sheet, have been drawn and engraved to accompany this report. (Sketch No. 48.) Assistant George Davidson has furnished a valuable article descriptive of the coast, from the northern to the southern boundary. A complete history of the exploration and discovery, with an analysis of the names of localities, and a historical map, has been furnished by Dr. J. G. Kohl, and an abstract is appended to this report. (Appendix No. 64.) An able report on the geology of the immediate coast, which has such close relation with its topography and hydrography, has been made by William P. Blake, Esq., geologist of the Exploring Expedition of Lieutenant Williamson, U. S. Topographical Engineers, and is also appended to this report. (Appendix No. 65.) Primary triangulation.-This work, northward from San Francisco, and on Monterey bay, California, was continued in charge of Assistant R. D. Cutts until the time of his relief in April, by the arrival of Assistant G. A. Fairfield, appointed to that duty. The pttrty of Assistant Cutts moved from the station "Santa Cruz," (see Sketch J K No. 2,) at the end of November, having in the interval, when observations on the main lines of the series were prevented by unfavorable weather, completed three tertiary stations in the vicinity. On completing the station at the mouth of Pajaro river his efforts were employed in marking, by stone blocks, the primary stations on San Pablo bay for their future security, and in placing stone monuments, with suitable inscriptions, to mark the termini of the Pulgas base. "Each monument is of the same size and material, and consists of two pieces of Benicia freestone, viz: a square shaft and pedestal." "The shaft is 5 feet in height, and its top and base 1 foot 10 inches, and 2 feet square, respectively. The diminution from the base upwards is one-twelfth ; the shaft weighs a ton and a half. The pedestal is 2 feet 8 inches square, and 1 foot 3 inches in height, including the inch bevel on the top, and upon which the shaft rests. The weight of the pedestal is three-fourths of a ton." The usual inscription is cut upon the monument at each end of the base. After completing observations at a third station, connecting with the two on Monterey bay, before mentioned, the party resumed operations on the series extending northward from San Francisco bay. In reference to this work Assistant Cutts remarks: "This station (Sonoma Mount, see Sketch J K No. 2) will connect with the hills overlooking Bodega bay, and, to the northward, with the mountains lying between Russian river and Clear lake. The character of the country is such, that it is not possible to determine from the primary stations the topographical points necessary for the delineation of the coast. A small tertiary series is indispensable for this purpose, so far as I have reconnoitred." "Now that the triangulation, both to the northward and southward, has emerged from the confining barriers extending from San Francisco to Mount Bache, the scheme for the primary triangulation in both directions can be much enlarged, should it be deemed advisable. The last line observed from Mount Bache was fifty miles in length, 11-nd the base for the continuation of the work southward is forty-seven miles." A sketch of the triangulation executed and proposed, and the records, abstracts of angles, computations, &c., appertaining to the work up to the period of the departure of Mr. Cutts on the 16th of May, have been received at the office, and duplicates of the results, together with

tracings of the topographical sheets, were turned over to Messrs. Fairfield and Rodgers, to form part of the archiveR of their respt>ctive partieR. The statistics of the work executed between the beginning of the present surveying year an cl J\fay 1st, are as follows : Primary stations occupied ................ ., ............................................ . 2 Secondary and tertiary stations occupied ........................................... . 5 Number of angles observed and determined ....................................... . 47 Number of horizontal measurements ................................................ . 1,966 Number of signals erected ............................................................. .. 16 Number of vertical measurements .................................................. .. 2'74 Number of observations for azimuth ................................................ . 3G8 The weather, since the arrival of Assistant Fairfield, has much hindered the progress of the triangulation northward from San Francisco . .After a short leave of absence, Assistant Cutts was assigned to duty in New York harbor, (see Section II,) and relieved from that to take the important position of surveyor to the commission under the treaty relating to fisheries on the coast of the United States and the British provinces of America. At the close of l\Iay last, Assistant George Davidson, in the Coast Survey brig Fauntleroy, left San Francisco for Washington Territory, where he was to undertake the triangulation of .Admiralty inlet. In July a short preliminary base, a mile and three quarters in length, had been measured near Port Townshend for the work of Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, and Hood's canal; but Mr. Davidson still hoped, in the course of the triangulation, to find a better base than this, especially for the triangulation of the Straits of Fuca. The side on which the triangulation of Port Townshend connects with that of Admiralty inlet being but two miles, antl the longest lines of the inlet work about ten to fifteen miles, the length of the base already found would not be objectionable, if the triangles from it were well conditioned. The unusually hazy character of the weather much hindered the progress of the triangulation, which, however, Mr. Davidson was enabled to carry to the line "Bush-Foul weather," at the entrance of Hood's canal, (see Sketch J No. 3,) erecting signals also as far as "Point No~ Point," on the west side, and Useless bay, on the east. Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson, under the direction of Mr. Davidson, executed a tertiary triangulation in connection with the topography of New Dungeness. He has also completed topographical surveys of Port Ludlow and Smith's island, at the entrance of the Straits of Rosario. In the course of the triangulation the number of first-class signals erected by Assistant Davidson Was nineteen, with an equal number of the second class. Fourteen stations were occupied, at which one hundred and six angles were measured by two thousand six hundred and twenty-eight repetitions upon one hundred and one objects. The number of secondary objects observed upon to assist in sketching the shore-line was three hundrecl and six. Altitudes were observed with the sextant at two stations upon twenty objects. Sub-Assistant Lawson occupied four stations at New Dungencss, and measured ten angfos by on~ hundred and ninety-two repetitions. His topographical work embraces a total shore-line of thirty-four miles, and an area of about 4. 7 square miles. A change in the position of the bubble of the level of the zenith telescope in use at Humboldt astronomical station was noticed by Assistant Davidson during the prevalence of shocks of an earthquake .. Unfortunately, the transit instrument, with its level, was not in use, and the observations on the level of the zenith telescope were not such as to lead to any conclusion beyond that just stated. L On closing their work in October, 1854, .Assistant Davidson and Sub-Assistant James S. .awson, who had been five yea.rs on the western coast, were instructP.d to return to the Atlantic s~de, and I ha.d begun to make arrangements for substituting other officers in their places, when t ey applied to return to these Sections.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The experience which they had acquired rendering them so especially competent for duty there, I did not hesitate to comply with their request, and they returned in March last to San Francisco. Assistant Davidson has again been affiictcll with rheumatism, but his persevering energy has kept him in the field. I am indebted to :Mr. Davidson, who was one of the pioneers on this coast, and has, from choice, worked there, returning after a short visit to his friends, for a good general des~ription of the western coast from the northern to the southern boundary. He has been frequeiitly up and down the coast in the several vessels of the survey and in almost every mode of con vcyance which the country affords, determining geographical positions, making magnetic observations, executing the triangulation and topography of the survey, examining sites for light-houses, and engaging in all the miscellaneous duties which the beginning of a survey necessarily require. His descriptions are, therefore, generally drawn from b.is own observation; and where he has collected the information, he so states in his report. This memoir (.Appendix No. 26)иwill be found to contain notices of the following localities: Straits of Rosario, Canal de Haro, (islands forming these straits,) Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, Straits of Juan de Fuca, coast from Cape Flattery to Gray's harbor, Shoalwater bay, Columbia river, coast from thence to Cape Blanco, Rogue river, Crescent City, Klamath river, Trinidad bay, Mad river, Humboldt bay, Eel River valley, Shelter Cove, Mendocino City, Albion river, Point Arena, Haven's Anchorage, Bodega bay, Tomales bay, Point Reyes, the Farrallones, the Golden Gate, San Francisco, the coast from thence to Monterey bay, San Simeon, San Luis Obispo, coast south of Point Conception along Santa Barbara channel, San Pedro bay, Los .Angeles, Mission of San Luis Rey, and San Diego. Valuable information is given in reference to the character and modes of execution of the Coast Survey work in California and Oregon and Washington Territories. Some additional work in the triangulation for connecting the western islands and the coast was executed by Captain E. 0. C. Ord, U. S. Army, after the date of my last report, and before the order relieving him from Coast Survey duty reached him. As early as he could be spared from this side, Assistant W. E. Greenwell was instructed to relieve Captain Ord. A vessel suited to the western coast (the schooner Humboldt) was built under the direction of Mr. Greenwell, and sent round Cape Horn, while he proceeded by the most direct route to San Francisco. The appropriation had been so nearly exhausted by the expenditures for the party of Captain Ord, that Mr. Greenwell judged it expedient to await the arrival of his vessel, and of the new fiscal year, before undertaking to organize a party. The schooner Humboldt was injured in a gale and put into Rio for repairs. Proceeding on her voyage, she reached San :Francisco, after a tedious passage, at the close of the month of August; and, at the last advices, ARsistant Greenwe11 was at San Pedro, with 'instruments in place, and ready to take advantage of the first favorable weather which might offer for observing. He had erected signals at Point Duma and Santa Barbara island, and three on Santa Catalina (Sketch J K No. 2.) The ultimate plan of Captain Ord for the accomplishment of this work, as stated in his supplementary report, was, to proceed from a base measured near Los .Angeles, connecting thence with the nearest island, and including all the islands in a series of triangles, joining them at practicable points with the main. Assistant Greenwell expresses strong hopes of being able to find on Santa Cruz island a site for a base which may serve for the triangulation of that and the neighboring islands, and afford at once the preliminaries requisite for their topographical survey. He commends, in his report, the willingness and energy shown in the service by Mr. P. C. F и West, attached to his party as ai(l. Sub-Assistant .A. F. Rodgers has continued the topography of San Francisco bay and that of San Pablo bay and its dependencies. Just previous to the date of my last annual report, he bad completed a sheet extending from the entrance and embracing the western shore of San Pablo bay as far as Petaluma creek, the shore of which it also incl !des. He has since completed the topography of the opposite shore of the bay, from the mouth ! Karquinee strait southward

to a point beyond the entrance, and that of the eastern shore of San Francisco bay from San Antonio creek, opposite to the city of San Francisco, and extending southward about nine miles. The following are the results of his seaHon's work: Miles of shore-line ofland surveyed................................................... 73~ Miles of marshes, creeks, roads, and ponds.......................................... 24:5 Total area (square miles)................................................................. 62t Su~Assistant Rodgers has sent to the office the sheets containing his work of the present season. Mr. Rodgers also re-surveyed the shore of San Francisco entrance near Fort Point, the topography of which had been materially changed in the preparation of the site for the works of fortification there. In assigning a reason for a recommendation, which has been adopted, that the projected sheet-San Francisco bay and harbor-should he extended to include San Leandro creek, Mr. Rodgers remarks : " Within the limits of this sheet is the topography of the bay of San Leandro, upon the western bank of which is the village of Alameda; between this and the neighboring town of Oakland, upon San Antonio creek, much rivalry exists, each claiming superior advantages as a point of embarcation for the produce of the garden county of the State, (in which they are both situated,) finding a market, as it must do, in San Francisco through one of these channels. A great drawback to the prosperity of Alameda and Oakland has been found in the shallowness of the water at low tide, in approaching them from the main bay, rendering the arrival and departure of ferry-boats so irregular as to prevent their being resorted to by the business men of San Francisco as places of residence, while their milder climate and picturesque beauty of location eminently fit them for such retirement. Should San Francisco fulfil the promises of early days, and attain the importance which, as the commercial emporium of the western coast of our continent, she seems destined to, the towns opposite to and so near as Oakland and Alameda will, of course, participate in her prosperity. Various projects for improving the channels in the San Antonio creek and that of San Leandro have already been discussed, and a bill appropriating thirty thousand dollars for deepening the former channel was brought before the legislature of the State at its last session. I would most respectfully recommend that the bay of San Leandro and adjacent shores be included in the harbor chart of San Francisco bay when published. More than the additional topography necessary for the extension of the project map, as sent from the office to Lieut. Comg. Alden, is furnished upon the plane-table sheet which I forward herewith. A harbor map without this ~ork upon it would appear incomplete, as San Leandro and San Antonio creeks are the only important points upon the bay in the vicinity of San Francisco, and as such attract ei>pecial attention." Sub-Assistant W. M. Johnson has oontinued the topography of the coast between Point Ail? Nuevo and Pigeon Point, (Sketch J No. 2,) and executed the surveys necessary for examinatwns for sites of light-houses at Santa Barbara and San Pedro. (Sketch No. 45.) Of the country embraced in the first-named survey, Mr. Johnson says: "The country gone o:er i~ very broken, being intersected by deep ravines running perpendicular to the general direction of the coast line ; several of these contain living streams of pure water, and in this particular it possesses great advantages as a grazing country. The point of greatest elevation embraced within the survey is five hundred feet above high water." Mr. Johnson giv.es, in this connection, reasons for preferring Pigeon Point to Point Ano Nuevo for the site of a light-house, which have been submitted to the Light-house Board. (See Appendix No. 74.) T~e work of the season was interrupted by the illness of Mr. Johnson, but resumed at the ~~rhest moment with his characteristic fidelity. The results of the examinations made by ieutenant T. H. Stevens, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, near Santa Barbara and San Pedro, based on the surveys of Mr. J'ohnson, are given in Appendix No. 83.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Returning from this work, that of the coast north of Pigeon Point was resumed, when Mr. Johnson received instructions to co-operate in the survey of Santa Cruz and Anacapa islands, (Santa Barbara islands,) and the adjacent coast, for light-house purposes, (Sketch J.) Of this survey, Mr. Johnson says: " The islands make a double 11heet, as we succeeded in con~ necting them by triangulation, three points on Anacapa having beeH. established from the triangulation on Santa Cruz as a base. This was the only way in which the survey could have been made satisfactory, as, from the formation of Anacapa, it would have been impossible to get a sufficient base to connect the three parts of this island. The west end of Anacapa is a peak nine hundred and thirty feet in height, the base of which is 3,893 yards long and 1,239 yards wide. This is separated from the middle island by a gap ten feet wide, through which the boats usually passed to and from work." "The middle island is 2,!.l64 yards long and 4!.l3 yards wide. East island is 2,088 yards long and 493 yards wide. The gap separating Middle and East islands is two hundred and four yards wide; but, from the great number of rocks, it is impassable even for the small boat of the schooner. The length of Anacapa, on a direct line from point to point, is five miles and forty-five yards." The party of Sub-Assistant John:on has since been employed in the topographical survey of the coast of Santa Barbara channel, between Buenaventura and Point Duma, and in furnishing points and shore-line for the hydrographic party now engaged there. The following statistics for the season are reported : Number of miles of coast-line surveyed................................................ 49! Number of miles of shore-line of rivers, creeks, &c................................ 37! Number of miles of roads of rivers, creeks, &c. ................... ................. 34 Area of country in square miles......... . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30! Interesting particulars in regard to Santa Crnz island and the valley of San Buenaventura will be found in extracts from the report of Mr. Johnson, (Appendix No. 28.) Hydrography.-Lieut. Comg. James Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Active, has been engaged in the hydrography in these sections, assisted during part of the season by Lieut. Comg. T. H. Stevens, U. S. N., and during the remainder by Lieut. Comg. Archibald MacRae, in the schooner Ewing. A summary of the operations of the party under the immediate charge of Lieut. Comg. Alden, from the date of my last report to the close of June, when they proceeded to Washington Territory, is thus given in a repo:at from the chief of the party: "Soon after our return from the North, the soundings in Sir Francis Drake's bay and about Punto de los Reyes were done, (Sketch No. 47 ;) then the work on the bar and entrance of San Francisco bay, including some ten miles of the coast on either side, was commenced and steadily continued, with occasional interruptions by the weather, to its completion. This chart, with a report in relation to matters connected with it, was forwarded to you on March 16th, together with some two hundred and thirty specimens of the bottom. The work inside was then resumed, and connected with that previously done and the inside work. The whole is comprised in six sheets, the last five of which were sent to you on the 1st instant, with forty-one additional specimens of the bottom. The accompanying sketch will show the limits, and the following statistics the amount of hydrography done in and about the harbor : Fourteen hundred and sixty-four miles have been run in soundings, and twenty-five thousand six hundred and ninety-three (25,693) soundings taken. The number of angles taken with the theodolites, for hydrographic positions, is six hundred and ninety-one ; and the number with the sextants, for the same purpose, is five thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven, (5/767.) The square miles of area sounded out are three hundred and two, and the number of specimens of the bottom taken is two hundred and twenty-seven." "Sailing directions, and remarks on the bar and entrance, were forwarded to you with the chart on March 15th, and I would now briefly notice all the outlying hidden dangers on the inside of the bay which, have come under my observation.

APPENDIX Ko. 8. List

ef

geographical positions determined by tlte United States Uoast Stm:ey and continued from the reports of 1851 and 1853.

The present list is a continuation of that published in the annual reports for 1851 and 1853, and contains the geographical positions of points determined astronomically and trigonometrically since the date of the former, with the repetition of some points preYiously published for convenience of reference. The following explanations will give all the information requisite for the use of the tables. For the purposes of the survey, the coast is divided into eleven sections; in all of which the work is carried on simultaneously. The survey being in different stages or progress in the several sections, and new results being added from year to year to those here given, the same divisions have been adopted in this publication: The several sections are defined as follows: Section I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith. Section IL From Point Judith to Cape Henlopen. Section III. From Cape Henlopen to Cape Henry. Section IV. From Cape Henry to Cape Fear. Section V. From Cape Fear to St. Mary's river. Section VI. From St. l\Iary's river to St. J ose1ih's bay. Section VII. From St. Joseph's bay to Mobile bay. Section VIII. From Mobile bay to Vermilion bay. Section IX. From Vermilion bay to the Rio Grande. Section X. Coast of California, San Diego bay to 42d parallel. Section XI. Coast of Oregon, 42d to 49th parallel. The tables give the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points in each section, and their relative azimuths, or bearings and distances. The manner in which these data have been obtained may be briefly explained here. In each section a base-line of from five to ten miles is measured with all possible accuracy. A series of triangles, deriving the lengths of their sides from this base, is then established along the coast by the measurement of the angles between the intervisible stations. In this primary series the triangles are made as large as the nature of the country will permit, because the liability to error increases with the number of triangles. On the bases furnished by the sides of the primary triangles a secondary triangulation is next established, ex.tendingиalong the coast, and over the smaller bays and sounds, and determining a large number of points at distances a few miles apart. The distances between the points thus determined, as given in the tables, are liable to an average error of about one foot in six miles, until a final adjustment between the base-lines shall have been made. In some parts of the survey the base-lines for tlie primary triangulation have not yet been measured, in which cases the distances depend on preliminary base-lines, measured with great care; and they are liable to an average error of one foot in three miles. This applies to the positions on Savannah river in Section V, and to those in Sections VI, IX, X, and XI. As on the completion of the primary triangulation in each section the several series form one connected chain, the different bases afford verification of each other and of the triangulation connecting them. The first three sections arc thus connected. Observations for latitude and azimuth are made at a number of stations of the primary triangulation in each section. The difference of latit!Jde, longitude, and azimuth between these and other stations are then computed, under the supposition t11at the earth is a spheroid of

120

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

revolution of the following dimensions, which are those determined by Bessel from all the measurements made to the present time, viz : Eq_uatorial radius= 637'7397.16 metres. Polar radius = 6356078. 96 metres. Eccentricity = 0.081G9683 It has been found that the differences of latitude and longitude, as computed in this manner from the distance and azimuth between two stations, and which are called geodetic, differ from those obtained by astronomical observations. Such disagreements are due to local irregularities in the figure and density of the earth; and the error resulting from them in the determinations of latitude, and of the meridian plane, is designated as station error. It amounts, according to the results obtained at present, to between one and two seconds of arc in the eastern section of the survey, and to about half a second in the sec,tions south of the Dela: ware. In order to eliminate the in:fiuence of station errors on the general results, observations are made at a number of stations, the results are referred to a central station by means of the geodetic differences, and the mean of all is used for the computation of the positions given in the tables. The geographical positions must therefore be considered as liable to future changes, from the accumulation of new observations, and the final discussion of all the results obtained. The differences of longiticde are obtained, as has been stated, by computation from the distances, latitudes, and azimuths of the triangulation. In adding up these differences from station to station, an accumulation of the unavoidable errors is probable. They are checked, however, by differences of longitude, determined by means of the electro-magnetic telegraph, in every section where the introduction of the latter makes it practicable. SEATON STATION, in Washington city, has been selected as the centre for the telegraphic differences of longitude. The sections at present connected by telegraph are Sections I, II, III, IV, and V. The first three being also connected by triangulation, the check on the geodetic differences of longitude is here obtained, and the agreement is very close. The longitude from Greenwich in these sections depends upon that of Cambridge Observatory, as determined by chronometric differences between Liverpool and Cambridge, and by occultations, eclipses, and moon culminations, observed at various observatories in the United States, and referred to Cambridge by means of telegraphic differences. The following statement shows the result up to the present time:

Explanation of the tables.

The :first column on the left contains the name of the several stations or friangulation points. Their general locality is intimated by the heading at the top of the page, by means of which they will be readily found on the sketches aceompanying the taliles. Sub-headings in the first column indicate the locality more minutely where it is practicable. The stations are generally either prominent ol~jects of permanence, such as spires, lighthouses, beacons, &c., or they are 110ints on prominent hills, capes, or pcints of land, where signals have been erected for the purpose of the Hurvey, and which are marked on the ground. In a small number of cases, in the first three sections, but much more freqm,ntly in the southern sections, where settlements on the coast are sparse and few permanent objects are to be found, the stations have no other distinguishing mark than the signal erected on the spnt, and after its decay, the mark left on the ground to designate the station-point. The latter generally consists of posts or stones set around the point, while the centre of the station is designated l)y an earthen cone or glass bottle buried under the surface of the ground, and marked on top by a stone or post. Wliere the station is on a rock:, a copper bolt, or a hole filled with lead or :mlvhur, will be found to design.ate the exact spot. The sketches showing the configuration of the land, as well as the relative positions of the stations, no great difficulty will be ex11erienced in finding the latter when desired for local surveys or reference. In any case where minute descriptions of particular points are required, they can be had by application addressed to the Coast Survey office. The second an<). third columns contain the latitudes and longitudes of the siationR named. The fourth column contains tlie azimuth of the line joining the station named in the first column to that named in the fifth-that is to say, the angle which that line makes with the meridian of the former station, reckoned from south around by west, t1uough the whole circfo. The sixth column gives the back azimuth of the same line, or the angle which it makes with the meridian of the latter station, reckoned as before; the difference between the azimuths in the fourth and those in the sixth column being 180░ less the inclination. of the meridians at the two
~tations.

The seventh, eighth, and ninth columns give tho distances, in metros, yards, and miles, between the stations named in the nrst and fifth columns. The relation of the metre to the yard, used in obtaining these results, is, 1 metre= 1.0935691) yards, or 39.3G8505 United States standard inches. For each station the azimuths and llistances to two other stations are given. In everf case the lines so given have actually been observed. . In each section the stations of the primary triangulation are distinguished by being printed
m SMALL CAPITALS.

In Section V, near tlie mouth of the Savannah river, some of the former preliminary positions have been improved from more reliable observations ; and in Section YI, the positions in the vicinity of Key West, and to the westward of it, have been repeated, and the longitudes are counted from Greenwich. 16

General list of Coast Survey discoveries and develop1nents to 1854 indu8ive.

1. Determination of the dimensions of Alden's Rock, near Cape Elizabeth, Maine-1854. 2. A rock (not on any chart) in the inner harbor of Gloucester, Mass.-discovered 1853. 3. A bank, ninety miles eastward of Boston, with about thirty-six fathoms of water-probably a knoll connected with Cashe's ledge, but with deep water between it and the ledge-1853. 4. A bank, (Stellwagen's Bank,) with ten and a half to fourteen and a half fathoms of water on it, at the entrance to Massachusetts bay, and serving as an important mark for approaching Boston and other harbors-1854. 5. A dangerous sunken ledge (Davis' ledge) to the eastward and in the neighborhood of Minot's ledge-1854. 6. Boston harbor: Broacl Sound channel thoroughly surveyed, and marks recommended1848. 7. Several rocks in the fair channel-way in Boston harbor entrance-1854. 8. Nantucket shoals: Davis' New South shoal, discovered in 1846, six miles south of the old Nantucket South shoals, in the track of all vessels between New York and Europe, or running along the coast from the Eastern to the Southern States, or South America. 9. Ditto: Two new shoals north and east of Nantucket-discovered in 1847. 10. Ditto: Six new shoals near Nantucket; the outermost one, fourteen and a half miles from land, and with only ten feet water-discovered in 1848. 11. Ditto: McBlair's shoals, off Nantucket-discovered in 1849. 12. The tidal currents of Nantucket shoals and the approaches-1854. 13. Nantucket shoals: Davis' Bank-discovered in 1848, and survey finished in 1851. 14. Ditto : Fishing Rip, a large shoal extending north and south about ten miles to the eastward of Davis' Bank and thirty from Nantucket, with four and a half fathoms-surveyed in 1852. 15. Ditto; A ridge connecting Davis' New South shoal and Davis' Bank-found in 1853. 16. Ditto: A small bank or knoll, with but five fathoms on it, about five miles east of Great Rip, with twelve fathoms between it and Davis' Bank and Fishing Rip, the water gradually deepening outside of it to the northward and eastward, beyond the limits of the series of shoals. 17. Contraction of the inlet at the north end of Monomoy island, and opening of new entrance to Chatham harbor-1853. 18. J'.1.faskeget channel-surveyed by Lieut. C. H. Davis in 184.8, and Lieut. C. H. McBlair

in 1850.

OF

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

19. Numerous rocks in Martha's Vineyard sound, Long Island sound, and the various bays and harbors connected with them. 20. The tidal currents of Long Island sound-1854. 21. Gedney's channel into New York bay, having two feet more water than the old channels. Had the true depth of this channel (which is seen, by comparing old and new charts, to have then probably existed) been known in 1778, the French fleet under Count D'Estang would have passed into the bay and taken the assembled British vessels. 22. The changes in New York harbor, near the city, between 1845 and 1854. 23. Sandy Hook: Its remarkable increase out across the main ship-channel has been traced from the surveys of the topographical engineers and others, and by several successive special surveys. 24. Increase of depth in Buttermilk channel, ascertained and made known in 1848 by survey of Lieut. D. D. Porter. 25. Delaware bay: Blake's channel at the entrance discovered ju 1844-open when the eastern channel is closed by the ice. This discovery has served to develop, strikingly, the resources of that portion of Delaware. 26. Blunt's channel in Delaware bay. 27. Changes in the Delaware near the Pea Patch. 28. The true extent and position of the dangerous shoals near Chincoteague inlet, Virginia1852.

29. Mctompkin inlet, Virginia, shoaling from eleven to eight feet in the channel during 1852. 30. Two channels into Wachapreague inlet, Virginia-one from the northward and the other from the eastward-both with seven feet water at low tide-1852. 31. A shoal half a mile in extent, not put down on any chart, 5! miles east from the north end of Paramore's island, Virginia: it has but four fathoms water on it, and has nine fathoms around it-1852. 32. Great Machipungo inlet, Va. ; found to have a fine wide channel, with eleven feet water on the bar at low tide and fourteen at high; good anchorage inside in from two to eight fathoms; the best harbor between the Chesapeake and Delaware entrances-1852. 33. Two shoals near the entrance to the Chesapeake-one 4! nautical miles S. E. by E. from Smith's island light-house, with seventeen feet water upon it; the other E. by S. nearly, 7! miles from the same light, with nineteen and a half feet upon it-1853. 34. Only three feet water upon the "Inner Middle," the shoal part of the Middle Ground west of the "North Channel," at the Chesapeake entrance-1852. 35. A twenty-five fathom hole 2! miles west-southwest from Tazewell triangulation point, eastern shore of the Chesapeake ; all other charts give not more than sixteen fathoms in this vicinity. и 36. A shoal at the mouth of the Great and Little Ohoptank, in Chesapeake bay-1848. 37. The general permanence of the Bodkin channel, and shoals in its vicinity, at the entrance of the Patapsco river-between 1844 and 1854. 38. A shoal (New Point shoal) in Chesapeake bay, with sixteen feet water on it, southeast from New Point Comfort light-house, off Mobjack bay-1854. 39. A reconnaissance of the Wimble shoals near Nag's Head, coast of North Oarolina-1854. 40. Deeper water found on Diamond shoal, and a dangerous nine-feet shoal off Cape Hatteras-1850. 41. A new channel, with fourteen feet water, into Hatteras inlet, formed during the year 1852, which is better and straighter than the old channel. 42. The well-ascertained influence of prevailing winds in the movement of the bars at Cape Fear and New inlet entrances, and the gradual shoaling of the main bar; the latter fact being of great importance to the extensive commerce seeking this harbor-1853. 43 и Frying-Pan shoals) off Cape Fear, N. C. A channel of 2! fathoms, upwards of a mile

APPENDIX No. 10. Letter of Commander Charles H. Davis, United States navy, cmnmunicating information relative to developments made in Boston harbor.
CAMBRIDGE, MAss., October 30, 1855. Sm: I have the pleasure to inform you that I have recently determined several important spots in Boston harbor of which I have been some time in search. A year ago, (October 29, 1854,) I wrote a letter to Mr. Alfred Nash, the very intelligent and skilful pilot, in which I furni8hed him with memoranda of dangerous places said to exist, and still not actually known. A copy of that letter is transmitted herewith. During the present month Mr. Nash-has apprized me of his having verified some of these new dangers, and accordingly I have determined their position with precision. On the list accompanying this report, I have given not only the angles and depths, but notices of the manner in which the dangers have been first discovered. In our rarely long-interrupted correspondence upon the hyclrography of Boston harbor, and its improvement, there has frequently been occasion to mention to you that several of the most able of the Boston pilots have interested themselves in communicating to the Coast Survey (either through me, or directly to yourself) all authentic information-the only information worth having-concerning such discoveries as those now reported. Owing to the broken, jagged, and uneven form of the rocky bottom of Boston harbor, in which numerous high-spiring points, with scarcely surface enough for the lead to rest on, are known to exist, these discoveries must be occasionally expected. They are made by vessels striking on shoal spots, where only good water had till then been known. These spots are, in fact, often surrounded by the deepest water. They are not likely to be found in any other manner, for there is nothing in the character of the bottom or its form (being, as it is, wholly devoid of any regularity of contour) to indicate the places of these sharp points. The method of tracing the spurs or ridges under water, suggested by Prof. Agassiz, does not apply in the special cases to which these remarks refer. All this is well known to you, and has been said before ; but the occasional repetition of it may serve to correct the erroneous impression that the discovery of hitherto unknown rocks shows any defects in the regular hydrographic survey, or affords to an indifferent person, to whom they may happen to be communicated by the pilots, any cause for self-gratulation. So far from showing defects, the fact that these rocks are discovered, as they are, by the most skilful pilots, added to the fact that they lie for the most part in deep water and in the channel-ways, prove that the survey is fully up to the actual state of knowledge, and keeps pace with its advances. An opposite opinion could only be held by one ignorant of hydrography and of the nature of this ground. и I have heard that some rocks not down on the chart have been found among the Cohasset group. I will inquire into this. In such a vast congeries of rocks, among which there are no channels suited for general use, the only important determination to the aeaman is the ourer

Between the bars nine feet of water can be carried, and from bar No. 9 to within two miles and a half of Tappahannock twelve feet, with the exception of a bar in Tobago bay, with a depth of water on it of eight feet. It is a quarter of a mile in extent, and is three miles and a q_uarter below Port Royal. The depths are all given as at low water. At the lower end of Green's bay the river makes a sudden turn, and the channel is very narrow, which causes many vessels to run ashore. The most intricate part of the river occurs opposite Tappahannock, the stream being there divided into several channels of little water, but the plotting of my work in that portion of the river is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable me to give a detailed account of it. All the bars, with the exception of the first, second, and fourth, seem to have heen formed by creeks which empty into the river opposite to them. The rise and fall of the tide is about four feet. Respectfully, yours, Prof. A.. D. BACHE, Superintendent U.S. Coast Survey.

DEAR

156

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTEND:iNT

by my repeated surveys, extending from 1850 to this date, a period of five years, during which time numerous storms have swept the coast, the gale of September, 1854, especially, producing changes of the most marked, and, in many instances, serious character. I am happy to state that the surges of the sea, though beating on the bar at every assailable position during the prevalence of that terrific blow, has not closed up, as by many was predicted, this channel ; but, on the contrary, a marked change for the better is apparent, and the experiment suggested by an anxious desire to benefit the commercial prosperity of t~e noble city of Charleston, is urged by the friendly overture of nature, inviting, instead of repelling, the opening of this more desirable passage to the ocean. Those who are familiar with the subject of bar improvements, can fully appreciate the great and various difficulties that are to be battled with, in such a field of operation. The uninitiated look for prompt results, and but too often condemn or intimidate the more sanguine, when there is a slight failure either from contracted means or inappropriate machinery for the tedious and harassing experiment. The scepticism of many haR induced me to give the whole subject-matter a careful revisal. While schemes, unequivocal in their character, for the formation of a new and deeper channel to the ocean are easily arranged, they are so vast, by necessity, that the government exchequer would scarce suffice for such expensive operations. That a necessity exists for attention to the bar of Charleston, no one doubts; suggestions were anxiously called for, and many were submitted to the unbiassed consideration of the commission called by the city to look into this matter. But one plan was adopted, and that originating with me was offered with extreme hesitation as an experiment that involved but a moderate outlay without the possibility of detriment to any existing channel. That the plan is still a hopeful one, ruy previous study of the subject fully shows. The following table bears me out fully in the deductions which I drew from the record of my surveys. The chart of 1855 shows a general increase of depth upon the bulk-head, and a contraction of eighteen yards in the general width of the channel. Bowman's jettee has settled about one foot and fifty-six hundredths, the result of which has been to increase by twenty-eight minutes the duration of the flow of ebb-tide o.ver the jettee, with an increased velocity of half a knot per hour, directly through the channel. The benefit of this is, no doubt, made manifest by the increase of water over the bulk-head. The high-water mark along the shore of Sullivan's island, is now three hundred and twenty yards more to the northward than in 1852, and the necessity for small jetteea along the shore for its general protection, is a subject for consideration.

APPENDIX No. 16.
Report made to the Superintendrnt by Lieutenant James Totten, ll. S . ..Army, assistant in the Coa8t Survey, on the erection of screw-pile beacons on Florida reefs, with descriptions of tlie signals. (See Sketch F No. 5.)

July 16, 1855. DEAR Srn: I have the honor to report, that, in obedience to your instructions of January 20, 1854, enclosing those from the Light-house Board of the 19th of the same month, and by authority of subsequent instructions, I have caused a number of screw-pile signals or beacons to be constructed, and have had them erected along the Florida reef. The complete signal, as now standing at several points hereinafter named along the reef, is made entirely of cast and wrought iron, and is thirty-six feet in vertical height. Each signal consists of a screw-pile, and a vertical shaft of thirty-six feet above the top of the pile. The shaft for convenience in transportation, &c-, is made in three sections, designated, respectively, the first, second, and third sections, counting from the lowest to the highest. 'rhe screw-pile and the two lower secti<ms are of cast, and the upper section of wrought-iron. The screw-pile is nine feet long, and nine inches in exterior diameter, and has a cylindrical cavity within it seven and a half inches in diameter, and seven feet in depth. The first or lower section has an extreme length of fourteen feet, of which four feet passes into the cylindrical cavity of the pile, and is there carefully wedged in its place, leaving ten feet in the clear above the pile. On the upper end of this section is cast the lower half of a collar, so arranged, in connection with the other half cast on the foot of the second section, that the two can be firmly bolted together. 'l'he second or middle section is ten feet in extreme length, and is provided, at either end, with the respective halves of two collars, so adjusted, in connection with those on the other sections, that the whole shaft may be strongly bolted together. The first and second sections are cast hollow, and the iron in each is seven-eighths of an inch in thickness. The third or upper section (called also the spindle,) of lrought-iron, is sixteen feet in extreme length, and is solid throughout. On the lower end of this is the half of a collar, corresponding to that on the upper end of the se:ond section, and intended for fastening these two sections together. The third section or ~pmdle carries a vane of wrought-iron, and a cylinder or barrel of strong hoop-iron. The vane 18 supported in its position just above the collar connecting the second section and spindle, by t~o powerful hinges. The vane represents one of the letters of the alphabet, supported by the hmg.es, six feet in vertical height, and otherwise in proportion. The cylinder or barrel is six ~:~:. m length, by two. and a ha~f feet in diamet?r,. and i~ _strongly made after th~ manne~ of T ice-work, of hoop-non, and 1s firmly secured m its pos1t1on at the top of the third sect10n . . he shaft at the foot of the 1-0wer section, where it enters the screw-pile, is seven and a quarter in-::hee in exterior diameter, and decreases uniformly in size to the top of the spindle, where it

is only two inches in diameter. Three colors have been used in painting each sigwil, so a,; to make them as striking to the eye of the mariner as possible. For this purpose, white, red, and black, have been chosen as the most conspicuous; and, in painting the signals, these three colors have been so combined that no two adjacent beacons have the same colors upon like parts. By examination of the colors alone, on approaching any one of these signals, the master of a vessel may ascertain his latitude and longitude with tolerable certainty; and if the letter in the vane can be made out, then there can be no mistake whatever, if reference be haq to what ' follows herein. The signals above described are located on the most projecting and dangerous points of the Florida reef, and stand generally from four to six miles from the outside shores of the Florida keys, and within half a mile, in every instance, of the Gulf Stream. In the day-time these signals cannot fail to attract the attention of careful navigators, and warn them of their proximity to danger. The depth of water where the signals stand does not exceed four feet in any case at low tide, and just outside of them to the eastward, in the Gulf Stream, it is of unknown depths. A vessel approaching from the seaward may sail within a few hundred yards of any of these beacons; but it would always be prudent, and particularly in very light or very heavy weather., to give them a wide berth. In light weather it often happens, especially after long easterly blows, that the force and direction of the Gulf Stream sets across the reef, and then vessels are irnperceptilily carried amid the dangers, although the course steered should, if made, carry them outside of all trouble. vVhen this misfortune befalls a master of a vessel, it frequently occurs that the wind proves too. light to draw his ship out of danger, and a few moments' indecision then, is fatal. 'Vhen he finds himself to the west of any one of the signals, or the signal bearing east from his vessel, he may be sure that he is between the reef and the keys, and, consequently, surrounded by shoals and dangerous rocks. In all such cases of danger the master of a vessel, unless perfectly acquainted with his whereabouts, should lose no time in coming to anchor until he can ascertain which is the safe course to pursue. The following named reefs, &c., are the localities where the improved signals stand. These points are well known to all the wreckers and pilots who frequent the Florida reef, and each of them has, at some time, proved fatal to one or more valuable vessels and their cargoes. I mention the points in the order in which the signals stand, proceeding from Key \Vest towards Cape Florida and this is also the alphabetical order of their localities. 1. TnE EASTERN SAMBO.-The signal on this carries the letter "A" in the vane, and bears S. 3░ 29' 24" E., (true,) and is distant about 4.5 nautical miles from Geiger's houses; it also bears S. 13░ 13' 01 11 W., (true,) and is distant 5.0 miles from south Saddle Hills.

APPENDIX No. 17. Report of Lieut. Comg. B. F. Sands, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, upon the result of an examination of the channel between Pelican island and DaupMne island, west of entrance to Mobile bay.
COTTAGE

PosT

OFFICE, MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Mn.,

July 15, 1855. Srn : The Pelican channel, between Pelican and Dauphine islands, is constantly changing. My examination of it in May last shows a very narrow channel of seyen feet near the beach of Dauphine island, which is changed in depth and direction by almost every severe gale that visits the coast. The north end of Pelican island is sometimes cut away and distributed in shoal-lumps in what was previously the channel, and sometimes thrown upon the beach of Dauphine island, forming a point there as shown in the sketch of my examination in 1853, after the August gale, which also cut a shallow and narrow passage through the narrow part of Pelican island. That passage is now closed. From these frequent changes I consider the channel impracticable for vessels larger than sailboats. The bay between Pelican and the east end of Dauphine island is much the same as when it was surveyed by Lieut. Comg. Patterson, and is a good anchorage for vessels that can enter the channel at the south end of Pelican island, which is marked by a spar-buoy. The accompanying sketch shows the channel as it was in May last. Respectfully, your obedient servant, B. F. SANDS, Lieut. Comg. U.S. N., assistant in OoMt Survey. Prof. A. D. BAcHE, Superintendent .

southern coast of California, was sought for by Lieut. Comg. Archibald MacRae, U.S. N., as~istant Coast Survey, and determined to he in latitude 32░ 29' N., and longitude H9░ .04~ \V., (both approximate.) The shoalest water on the rock is reported by Lie11t. :D:IacRae to be three and a half fathoms, subject to a possible tidal reduction of six feet, which might reduce it to two and a haiffathom8, orjifteenfeet. Lieut. MacRae placed a buoy, composed of two casks, with a :flag-staff between, upon the shoalest part of the ledge to which this rock belongs, and wl1ich he represents as quite extensive. The buoy could be seen in clear weather about three miles. I would respectfully request that a copy of this letter may be sent to the Light-house Board, that their attention may be directed to the placing of a beacon on this ledge. I enclose herewith a Coast Survey sketch of Cortez Dank, from a reconnaissance by Lieut. Comg. Alden in 1853. In that examination the rock reforred to was not found . .A minute survey of this dangerous locality will be directecl.

Letter from the Superintendent to tke Secretary of the Treasury, communicating extracts from the report of Lieut. Oomq. Archibald JJiacRae, U.S. N., assistant in the Goa.st Survey, relat,ive to the position of a rock on which the steamer " Uncle Sa1n" struck, May 7, 1855.
DrxMONT, PmrnBSCOT CouNTY, ME., July 20, 1855. Srn : I have the honor to communicate the following extracts from a report made under date June 3d, in conformity with directions given by Lieut. Comg. James A.Iden, U. S. N., chief of the hydrographic party on the western coast, to Lieut. C0 mg. Archibald MacRae, U. S. N., assistant, in command of the surveying schooner "Ewing," to search for and mark the position of a rock upon which the steamer "Uncle Sam" struck on the 7th of May of the present year. "Proceeding to sea yesterday afternoon, and finding it too late to make immediate search between Point San Pedro and Steeple Rock, the schooner was kept off and on until this morning, when we ran in to within half a mile of the shore, about midway between the two points named, and thence, coasting the breakers, proceeded to the vicinity of the ' Steeple,' where we hauled off-shore. "There was a strong breeze blowing, and so heavy a sea that it was impossible to make any other examination than by watching for breakers. 'fhis, however, was entirely satisfactory. "About two miles north of Steeple Rock, and half a mile off-shore, the sea broke occasionally on a rock between fifty and a hundred yards outside of the point of a reef, which, commencing at the northern end of a small chain of rocks lying close in-shore just above Steeple Rock, ~weeps out off-shore at a point intermediate between Point San Pedro and the Steeple, and, JUdgmg from the breakers, trends in again to a bay southward of Point San Pedro. '.' Whether there is deep water between this rock and the reef we could not decide, but were satisfied that it would not be prudent to attempt a 1iassagc. "By reference to the sketch furnished by Sub-Assistant Johnson, a copy of which is herewith enclosed, it will be observed that the position of the rock is almost identical with that assigned by Captain Ba.ldwin, ..who probably had a smooth sea at the time his vessel struck, and thereCOAST SURVEY STATION,

CoAsT SURVEY STATION, DIXMONT, MArnE,

October 20, 185 5. Sm: I have the honor to communicate, in the following extract from a report made by Lieut. Comg. James Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, the existence of a deposite of red sand inside of the bar at the entrance of San Francisco bay, California. Lieut. Comg. Alden says, in his letter dated July 20th, "I made a careful examination of that locality just previous to leaving San Francisco, and the result fully sustains our first observations. "This marked peculiarity (the red sand) exists only inside of the curve or 'horse-shoe' formed by the bar, and as far in as the Heads, comprising an area of less than four miles square. "It is thought that this red sand will serve as a safe and surn guide to vessels entering San Francisco in thick weather, and to steamers it may be regarded as of great importance. "Passing up the coast to the northward of Point Piedra, keep in ton or twelve fathoms water, gradually shoaling to the bar in from five and a half to six fathoms, and proceeding on, the water will soon deepen inside the bar, where the red sand will verify the position; after which steamers, with proper care, can make good the entrance in the thickest weather." I would respectfully request authority to publish the foregoing for the benefit of navigation on the western coast. Very respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon.

Report of Assistant F. H. Gerdes on topography executed by his party on Manhattan island, and on the shores of East and North rivers, including the city of New York.
NEW YORK, OctOber 31, 1855. Sm: I have the honor to report that the following topographical surveys, as directed by you

in the early part of July, 1855, have been completed: 1. East river, from Hellgate to Gowanus bay, including part of Astoria., Ravenswood, H1;1nter's Point, 'Green Point, Williamsburg, and Brooklyn, to the wharf opposite Greenwood cemetery.

2. North river, from Jersey City to Gutemberg's wharf) including Jersey City, Pavonia, Hoboken, Washington village, \Vest Hoboken, and parts of Weehawken, and extending westward to the Palisade avenue. 3. North river, from Gutemberg's wharf to Normansville, opposite Tubby hook, embracing shore and characteristic topography. 4. East river, both sides from Throg's neck to the city of N cw York, with characteristic topography, and, in some partA, with considerable interior, embracing also Flushing bay, Riker' s and Berrian' s islands, the Brothers, and the larger }Jar ts of \:V ard' s and Randall's islands, with the improvements thereon since 1850 ; also the determination of a series of points for the use of the hydrographic party. 5. Manhattan island, containing an entire new survey of the shores, also of the opposite shore-lines of Harlem river, with characteristic topography, and a complete topographical survey of the upper part of the island, which had not been included in the map of 1854. In regard to the survey of Green Point, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Jersey City, Hoboken, &c., I would remark, that the time allotted for the completion of the harbor map of New York did not admit of a greater extension in the interior. I have included, in the respective sheets generally, from six to eight blocks deep, and in some instances more; and always determined the direction of streets towards the interior. * * * * * * * In the map of Hell Gate, surveyed in 1850 by Henry L. Whiting, Esq., assistant U.S. Coast Survey, I found it necessary to add many alterations and improvements, particularly in the city and State government possessions on Ward's and Randall's islands. I added all that was necessary, and, furthermore, I determined, over the whole extent of Mr. Whiting's survey, a series of points to be used as sounding points by the hydrographic party. In every other respect the map of Hell Gate was perfectly good, and is one of the finest specimens and handsomest representations of reduction from nature that I have ever compared in the field. The sheet of East river, from Hell Gate to Throg's neck, I suppose must appear quite different from Mr. Renard's survey of 1837 or 1838. There are now large and :flourishing villages and manufacturing places where then only single and scattered farms could be found. Cities, even, are laid out where he must have found marshes and forests. * * * * * In 1853 I added the improvements and re-surveyed parts included in the topographical Coast Survey maps above Manhattan island on the Hudson river, but I had no points of triangulation and had to trust to chaining. Lieut. Comg. Wainwright was directed by you to re-sound the river from Yonkers downwards, for which purpose .Assistant Blunt determined a series of trigonon;ietrical points. Thinking it proper that my survey of 1853, as well as the hydrography of 1855, should have also to be based on this triangulation, I connected the topography up to Yonkers with Mr. Bhmt' s points, and added, at the same time, all improvements to my sheets, and corrected the slight deviations. l also furnished, by your direction, to the Commissioners on New York harbor encroachments, a map, running on East river from 10th to 28th streets, and embracing the blocks between the shore and First avenue, made on a scale of 2 ioo of nature. * * * Very respectfully, your most obedient servant, F.

Report of .Assistant S. A. Gilbert, on the topographical work executed by his party on the western and southern side of Long Island.
FLATLANDS, LONG ISLAND, N. Y., November 1, 1855. Srn: The following is a report of the progress of the topographical work under my ch_arge, in the re-survey of New York harbor and bay: ' My varty was organized on the 25th of August last, but, owing to circumstances out of my control, did not get into active operJ,tions until the 1st September. We then commenced work at Gowanus, near Greenwood cemetery, and rnn the east side of the harbor and bay to Hog inlet. These limits include the villages Fort Hamilton, Bath, Gravesend, Sheep-head bay, and Rockaway; also localities known as Gravesend bay, Coney island, Pelican island, Barren island, Duck Bar -island, Rockaway beach, and the greater part of Jamaica bay, with the numerous creeks and islands in and around it. The amount of details thus far surveyed isShore-line...................................................и......................... 178 miles. Roads .................................................................................. . 67 " Area ................................ -.................................................. . 46 square miles.

I am pleased to be able to report very favorably of my aid, Mr. M. Seaton, he having been of great assistance to me. Whenever it was practicable, we worked with both plane-table and compass at the same time, Mr. Seatvn using the compass and chain in the interior, on roads and general details ; his work thus done amounts to six square miles in area, in which there are twenty-five miles of roads, and about ten miles of outline of marsh ; all of which is included in the previous statement.

Report of .Assistant A. M. Harrison, on topography executed by his party on the coast of New Jersey, from the head of Raritan bay to Shrewsbury inlet, including Sandy Hook and the highlands of Navesink. u. s. SCHOONER J. Y. MASON, Off Perth .Amboy, Middle8ex Oo., N. J., October 31, 1855. DEAR SIR : I have the honor of sending you my report of the work executed by myself and party <luring the past season. * * * * * * * My first work consisted in selecting sitelil and erecting signals for the triangulation party. Twenty-one signals were erected on the shores of Raritan bay, seven on Staten island, and fourteen on the coast of New Jersey, extending from South Amboy to the highlands of Navesink. Careful topographical sketches, measurements, and written descriptions of these stations, were made and forwarded to Assistant Edmund Blunt, duplicates of which I will send to the office before the close of the season. This having been completed, I commenced my topographical work at Sandy Hook, on sheet No. 1, that being the on-ly sheet containing any determined points. Previous to commencing plane-table work, however, I searched for six stones erected on Sandy Hook by Sub-Assistant

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

165

R. M. Bache, under your directions, in 1851, as :fixed points of reference, for the pmpose of marking definitely the changes which might occur in that region. I succeeded in finding five of them, and placing signals over them, and subsequently determined their positions carefully on the plane-table sheet. The sixth stone, I am convinced, is not lost, and I will endeavor to find it next season ; it has probably been covered with sand by the wind. The latter appears to me to be one of the causes, if not the chief cause, of the changes which take place annually at the Rook. My first sheet, No. 1, embraces the survey of Sandy Hook, the adjacent island, and the shoals in the vicinity, which are bare at low water, and a portion of the highlands of Navesink, running from a third to three-quarters of a mile inland. This was inked and forwarded to the office ; and on the 26th of September I commenced sheet No. 2, which includes the shore of Kew Jersey, from the Highlands to near the village of Union. On the 19th of October a tracing of this sheet was sent to the office. Since then I have executed the shore-line of sheet No. 3,_which extends from Union to about a mile up the Raritan river beyond South Amboy, completing the shore-line of the work originally planned for me by yourself for the season. A tracing of the latter will be immediately forwarded to Washington. I now propose to commence the filling in of the interior topography, and continue eastward until such a time as you may deem it necessary for me to start for the St. John's and St. Mary's rivers. In regard to the changes which have taken place on the Raritan bay shore of New ,Jersey since the last survey, the accompanying list of points, where I have made examinations, will give the amount of washing away which has come under my observation: 830 yards east of Chesnaquack creek................................................ 30 feet. At Matayan (or Mataven) Pc;int..................................................... 40 " At Oonaskonk Point ........ ,........................................................... 30 " At Point Comfort........................................................................ 75 " 648 yards west of the wharf at Port Monmouth................................. 30 "

I have been assisted by the aid of the party, Mr. P.R. Hawley, in the erection of signals,
and towards the end of the season in plane-table duties; and I take this opportunity of speaking of his work as having been entirely satisfactory, and executed with a hearty good-will. Respectfully aubmitted by, your obedient serva.n t, Professor A. D. B.A.cHE,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT
OFFICE OF 00MMISSIONER8 ON HARBOR ENCROACHMENTS,

30 Broadway, New York, June 20, 1855. Whereas the President of the United States, on the application of this commission, has authorized Professor Bache to grant such assistance in the survey of the harbor of New York as may be consistent with the general progress of the Coast Survey ; and Whereas Professor Bache has expressed his readiness to comply with the desire of the members of this commission, and to furnish a sufficient number of engineers, together with the necessary implements and appliances to make the surveys and examinations contemplated by the law creating this commission, and to superintend and direct the same ; therefore, Resolved, That Professor Bache be, and he is hereby respectfully requested to detail, as soon as may be, such officers and engineers as he may deem necessary to make, under his superintendence, accurate surveys of the shores of the harbor of New York; to take such soundings in the said harbor, and observations of the currents therein, as will enable the commission to present to the legislature an accurate map of the harbor of New York and the adjacent lands, in accordance with the requirements of the act of March 30, 1855, Chapter 121. I certify the foregoing to be a correct copy of a preamble and resolutions passed by the commission on harbor encroachments. G. H. BOUGHTON, Secretary.
IRVING HousE, NEW YoRK, June 23, 1855. Srn : I have to acknowledge the receipt of your note enclosing the preamble and resolution of the Commission on Harbor Encroachments, requesting me to make arrangements for a survey of the harbor of New York and the adjacent lands by parties of the Coast Survey, under authority given by the President of the United States and Secretary of the Treasury. In compliance with the request of the commissioners, I have already commenced the necessary arrangements by the detail of officers and the assignment of vessels and other appliances for the survey, and will complete all the preliminaries in the course of next week. I shall endeavor so to arrange the work as to complete at least the shore-line and most essential hydrography by next November, so that it may be accurately mapped in the office; presenting also, if practicable, in time for your report to the legislature next winter, the topography of the immediate shores. Should the commissioners desire special arrangements in regard to any part of the details of the work, I will be obliged by their communicating their wishes to me, that I may give directions to the several parties. As soon as the necessary arrangements are completed I will report them to the commissioners. Very respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, DEAR

Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey.
G. H. BouGHToN, Esq.,

Secretary Commission on Harbor En<YroaChments, &c.
At a meeting of the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, July 9, 1855Professor Bache made the following report of his arrangements under the resolutions of the commissioners of June 20, of which he asks the approval of the commissioners. 1. A triangulation party is at work under charge of Edmund Blunt, Esq., assistant U.S. Coast Survey, assisted by C. P. Bolles, Esq., and Lieut. Seward, U. S. A., assistants Coast Survey. This party has been rendered necessary by the obliteration of many of the points forro~rly determined by the survey in the progress of improvement, and by other circumstances of a snn-

ilar kind. The party bas been withdrawn from the upper part of the Hudson, and merely the extra expenses will be charged to the commissioners. 2. A plane-table party, under the charge of F. IL Gerdes, Esq., assistant U. S. Coast Survey, will be engaged in New York city, Brooklyn, .Tersey City, and in the East river and Long Island sound to Throg's neck .. This party was already provided for, and only its extra expenses will be chargeable to the commissioners. 3. A plane-table party, under the charge of Richard D. Cutts, Esq., assistant U. S. Coast Survey, which will work on Staten island and the adjacent shores. 4. A. plane-table party, under the charge of A. M. Harrison, Esq., assistant U. S. Coast Survey, which will work at Sandy Hook and the vicinity, and on the north shore of Raritan bay. 5. A hydrographic party, under the command of Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, having the steamer Corwin and schooner Madison for the use of the party, which will survey the East river, Long Island sound to Throg's neck, the upper and lower bays and approaches. 6. A second hydrographic party, under the command of Lieut. Comg. Richard Wainwright, U.S. N., assistant Coast Survey, having the schooner Nautilus for the use of the party, which will survey the Hudson from Yonkers to the city inclusive and Harlem river. This party has been withdrawn from the upper part of the Hudson, and only the extra expenses are chargeable to the commissioners. 7. Should it prove by the middle of August that the progress is not as rapid as is now expected, other parties may be added if desired. 8. The foregoing parties, officered from the Coast Survey, are all furnished with the vessels needed, instruments, and other appliances; and merely the contingent expenses and such extra expenses as may be incurred by the officers will be charged to the commissioners. 9. To keep the execution of the map as nearly up with the field-work a~ possible, the hydrographic draughtsman ofLieut. Comg. Craven will work in New York in the office of the commissioners; the plane-table and hydrographic sheets be sent to Washington as early as practicable, and will be compiled there into a map on the scale and with the limits of that presented in project to the commissioners on the 6th of July (marked A, with one to two miles additional on the north side.) 10. To have a copy of the comparative map, with the addition of the survey of 1855, prepared for the commissioners in the office of the Coast Survey. 1.1. To have a comparative map of the city wharves and exterior line, from surveys at different periods, prepared in the office of the commissioners by the draughtsman of Lieut. Craven's party. 12. The accounts for the expenditures for this work will be rendered monthly. The deta.iled accounts will go to the office of the disbursing agent of the Coast Survey, who will prepare them for examination of the Superintendent, and an abstract for his signature, approval, and certificate; which abstract, with the signatures of the disbursing agent and Superintendent, will be sent to the commissioners in duplicate. 13. These arrangements are intended to furnish the hydrography, shore-line, and at least the characteristic topography of the adjacent lands of the harbor and bay and the dependencies generally, by the 1st of November to the 1st of December next, and a preliminary map which x:iay be presented to the legislature before the second Tuesday in January ; leaving the completion of the topography in the interior, and such parts of the dependencies as cannot be reached, and the complete map to another season.

At a meeting of the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, July 9, 1855, the following resolution was adopted : lle8olved, That the report of Prof. Bache this day submitted to the commission on the ar-

re.ngement and duties of the several parties detailed by him for the survey of the harbor, be and is hereby sanctioned and approved. G. H. BOUGHTON, Secretary. HARBOR COMMISSION OFFICE, New York, July 9, 1855.

At a meeting of the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, held at their office on Monday, July 9, 1855Prof. Bache having stated to the commissioners that he desired that General Totten, Commander Davis, and Captain Benham might be appointed with him in the consideration of an exterior line for the harbor of New York, and matters relating thereto, Mr. Bowen offered the following resolution, which was adopted: Resolved, That this commission, in compliance with the request of Professor Bache, do hereby respectfully request Gen. Joseph G. Totten, Commander C.H. Davis, and Capt. H. W. Benham to meet Professor Bache at such period of time as he may determine, and as will be convenient to themselves, for the purpose of consulting on a proper water-line for the harbor of New York. Resolved, That a copy of the foregoing resolution be sent to Professor Bache, and that he be requested to communicate the wishes of this commission to the gentlemen therein named. I certify the foregoing to be a correct extract from the minutes of the proceedings of the commissioners. G. H. BOUGHTON, Secretary. HARBOR. COMMISSIONERS' OFFICE, New York, July 9, 1855.

BOSTON, July 11, 1855. Srn: The project for the Commissioners' map on a scale of :oho having been commuи nicated to them, has met their approval. It is desired to have from one to two miles extension on the north side of the map, so as to embrace improvements on the main north of Spuyten Dyvil Creek. With this change the map will be executed. Please have the projection prepared at once, and arrangements made to put the work in as received. Constant communications should be kept up with the parties and with me in reference to the map, to insure its being kept up with the field-work and work afloat. One of the best draughtsmen, capable of executing work like that in the Boston harbor, and State and city maps, should be put on this map. It must be drawn on backed paper, or some arrangements be made for backing. These details and those of drawing should be carefully matured, and a memorandum be made of them and sent to me. The scale of shades must be studiously followed. It is expected that the field-work will all be complete, as far as shore-line an<l characteristic topography of shores are concerned, by November 15, and the latest day for compkting the map is January 10. Should it turn out that existing plane-table sheets may be used in furnishing topographical details to any extent, topography of as much of the interior aa can be prepared will be mapped. In mapping, care must be taken to work on a uniform system as to the belt of topography to be represented, so that the map may not present a mere fringe at one part a.nd a. large space of interior at another, marring its symmetry.

IJes!Jription of the manuscript chart of New York harbor, bay, and approaches.

This chart is reduced from plane-table and hydrographic surveys made iu 1855, "for the Commissioners for the preservation of the harbor from encroachments.'' It is projected on a sp,a}e of 20 fio 0 , or 3. Hi8 inches to the mile, with every fifth minute of latitude and longitude marked, (reckoned from Greenwich,) and the whole :mrface of the sheet is divided by red lines into square miles, for the convenience of estimating areas or distances. The neat line dimensions arc ten feet in length and seven feet ten incheR in width, embracing Throg's neck on the east, Hudson river, two miles above Spuyten Dny,Til creek, on the north, the mouth of Raritan river on the west, and near old Shrewsbury river on the south, extending over a section of country thirty-eight miles from north to south, and thirty miles from east to west. 'l'he surveys are based upon trigonometrical positions of secoml and third orders, established principally in 1855. The topography forms a belt above the high-water line, varying in width from one fourth to one mile, within which the details are minutely preserved, except of such city squares as are fully occupied; these being uniformly shaded, and only the public buildings within them being represented. The hills are developed by blue contour curves, at vertical distanceH of twenty feet, and the cultivated fields are bounded by broken lines. So far as the surveys and drawing have been carried, the chart is thus complete; but the large body of work to be accomplished within a given time, both in the field and in the office, has rendered several omissions necessary. On this account it is styled a "preliminary chart," until the additions shall have been made, agreeably to the original design. From the hydrography a chart is produced, showing, hy established methods, the form and character of the bottom, the dangers, the courses and ranges for sailing, the buoys, light-houses and beacons, and profiles of sections of the channels and bar. The soundings are recluced to mean low-water, (the plane of reference,) and arc selected from numerous soundings, so as to represent the bottom. The profiles of the channels and bar are constructed upon a horizontal scale of 20 h 0 , and a vertical scale of shn and show the form of bottom and volume of water at each cross section. The sailing directions are prepared from the recent survey, conformable to the ranges and courses of the present establishment . . The current table is made from observations taken at twenty-seven stations, showing the d.irection and velocity at each station at first quarter, maximum, and third quarter of the tides.

h The tide-table exhibits the corrected establishment; the rise of highest and fall of lowest tides ; t. e fall of mean low-water spring-tides; the height of mean low-water neap tides; the mean rise and fall of tides, a.nd spring and neap tides; and the mean duration of rise, fall, and stand.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The magnetic variation, either computed or observed the present year, is given for Sandy Hook light-vessel, Sandy Hook, the Narrows, Goverm>r's island, New York city, and Throg's neck. The list of light-houses and beacons contains the description a,nd position of each.

Remarks by !Jfr. Boschke on surveys made at dijferent pcriod8 in New York harbor.
NORTH RIVER.

Since 1835 the North river has deepened from about 40th street, southward, on the average nearly one fathom, and the deepest channel-way lies now on the New York side. On the New Jersey side, opposite Long wharf, the river has also deepened by some two feet, but a considerable deposite has been made south of Cunard dock, and opposite to Canal dock.
EAST RIVER.

Between Newtown creek and the navy-yard the bed of East river has changed slightly in the channel-way, and the Бat oppoRite Rivington street has extended into the river. A tendency to this effect existed in 1835, and is marked by an isolated spot of 16 to 18 feet, projecting out into the river. From the navy-yard to the Battery the river has deepened somewhat throughout, averaging from three feet to one fathom, without change in the course of the deepest channel-way. The water front at Brooklyn and Williamsburg has been much changed since the last survey. The shoal at the head of Buttermilk channel has been diminishing since 1835, in size, but the Hpot of least depth has shoaled from thirteen to twelve feet, and evidently changes in position, and often in size, but has always left to the east and west of it channels of uniform depth and width. There seems to be at present a tendency io shoaling off the wharves, between South aml Atlantic dock ferry, on the Brooklyn side. The spit from Castle Garden, off the battery, to pier No. 6, is increasing, and there are now two twelve-feet spots extending into the river. Between 1835 and 1848 Buttermilk channel increased in depth, but diminished in width. The flats at Atlantic dock shoaled in certain spots from twelve to seven feet, nnd in other~ from twelve to ten feet.
JERSEY FLATS.

A comparison between the surveys of 1835 and 1853 shows a decrease of water generally over the Jersey flats, with a tendency towards a uniform depth of six feet water, in nearly a straight line from Ellis' island to Robin's reef light-house.
FROM THE NARROWS TO NAV.ESINK LIGHT. (SHEET NO.

2.)

The fourteen:feet channel, and its bar, have undergone scarcely any change in depth, but the channel has been encroached upon in width somewhat. The flat which separates it from East thanuel has kept its original shape, but is steadily shoaling. East channel may be considered as improving in general depth, although, in the survey of 1848, several small spots of eighteen and sixteen feet occur. The same survey shows that the l!ar of 1835, carrying nineteen feet, had sanded up to seventeen feet; a small spot of that depth naving so increased as to make the bar of 1848 about half a mile in width. The survey of 1853,

OF

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

171

however, shows the channel and bar improved, giving the latter eighteen feet water, and a width of about an eighth of a mile. The main body of the :flats, between East channel and Swash channel, seems to have retained its shape, but the general depth is increasing. On this occurs the dry Romer shoal, which follows the same tendency. It is gradually washing away, and at present covers scarcely a fourth of the area shown in 1835. Swash clmnnel is constantly changing, especially on the southern side, where eighteen-feet lumps are very frequent. The survey of 1855 shows a considera1le improvement in this channel, with free access, four fathoms water, and a width of a quarter of a mile; but the survey cannot be regarded as sufficiently detailed to render it certain that no obstructions whatever exist in the channel entrance. The fiat between Swash channel and main ship-channel has changed very little in area; but the shoalest portions, as Flynn's knoll, &c., are diminishing in size, and have improved in depth from one to two feet. False Hook channel deepened between 1835 and 1848 011posite to Sandy Hook light, and the bulkhead due east of east beacon has been washed away. A fifteen feet, spot has formed north of Sandy Hook, projecting into the main ship-channel. The southern part of this channel has in some places shoaled, and the large flat east of the channel, consisting, in 1835, of three distinct eighteen-feet shoals, sanded up previous to 1848, and then constituted a continuous shoal of that depth.
NEW YORK BAR.

Gedney's channel, which in 1835 had a channel-way of 3:! fathoms, sanded up, so as to show in 1848 a very narrow bar, with three and a half fathoms. North channel had, in 1835, several knolls of three and a half fathoms, but the survey of 1848 shows a bar a mile in width, and, in occasional spots, as little as three and a quarter fathoms water. The survey of 1853 exhibits a considerable improvement in this channel, but its apparent tendency to deepen to four fathoms could be determined only by a minute re-survey. Its direction seems to be due east of a point half a mile north of Sandy Hook east beacon. South channel,, in 1835, carried on its bar three and a half fathoms. The survey of 1848 shows obstructions of eighteen-feet spots; and though that of 1853 represents it as improved, one spot of sixteen feet occurs in the channel-way.

October 13, 1855.

QUINCY, MAssACHUSETrs, .AugU8t 9, 1855. h DEAR Sm.: Three groups of keys were surveyed and marked during the past season, namely, t e Mud keys, Snipe keys, Saddle Bunck keys, (commonly known as Sal Bunce keys,) and several small and detached keys lying about thirteen miles northeast of Key West.

172

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The ~Ind keys arc traversed by three channels running nearly east and west; the portion south of the third channel being broken into small 1mtches of mangrove, growing from deep mud. They comprise an area of about two square miles, and are entirely overflowed at ordinary high tides. On this group nine posts were placed at the intersectfon of the meridians and parallels with the shore-line or edge of mangrove growth, the meridians being laid off parallel to that passing through Long Point. The Snipe keys extend in a southeasterly direction, a distance of four and a half miles. The northern group is a mile and a quarter in length, and somewhat less in breadth. It, is very much broken up by channels, and overflowed by high tides. Snipe key No. 1 is a single key, two and a quarter miles in length, and four hundred and fifty yards wide for half a mile from its northern end, narrowing one-half in the next mile, and again widening. Ten posts were placed on this key and numbered, the positions of which are marked upon the map prer1ared for the Land Office. Snipe key No. 2, adjacent to the last mentioned, is separated from it by a passage about a hundred and sixty yards wide. It is somewhat over two hundred yards in breadth at the northwestern end, but increases to a breadth of half a mile at the southern extremity. This key was marked by three posts. The Snipe keys are all covered with mangrove, and parts of them are overflowed at ordinary tides. The Saddle Bunch keys, divided from the last named by a passage called the Narrows, about two hundred and twenty yards wide, are intersected by three large bays, which nearly separate them into as many distinct groups. The greatest amount of fast-land is at the southern part, included between Sal Bunce harbor and Sugar Loaf creek. This portion embraces an area of nearly ten square miles, most of which is covered with a heavy growth of button-wood, mangrove, and iron-wood. Fifty-nine posts were planted upon these keys, properly marked and numbered, and firmly secured against the effect of the tides. The meridians and parallels dividing the Snipe keys and Saddle Bunch keys into quartersections, were laid off from the middle of the sheet by parallel lines. The detached keys included in my survey of this season are known JJfarvin key, about six hundred and fifty yards in circumference, and another of twice its size just south of it, but bearing no name. Both of them are covered with mangrove, and lie about. north of Snipe key No. 1, distant two miles. In a line with these and the southeastern extremity of Snipe key No. 1, is Mallory key, about a quarter of a mile in length, and the same in breadth. One half of it is covered with mangrove, and the other with bushes growing from deep mud. Blake key lies a mile to the southeast of Mallory key. It is a small clump, upon which there is a trigonometrical station. Whiting key is four hundred and thirty-seven yards in length, and one hundred and ten in breadth. It lies opposite to the Narrows, a passage between Snipe key No. 2 and Saddle Bunch keys, which is the only outlet to the keys lying eastward. Three small keys west of Whiting's key arc called the Crane keys. Wall's key is situated a mile and a quarter from the mouth of Sugar Loaf creek, and nearly north of it. It contains an area of less than a fourth of a mile, and is marked by two posts. , From the outside of Saddle Bunch harbor to the north Saddle Hill station, there is a lagoon ~t about one mile deep. The distance from Saddle Bunch harbor to the station called "Martha" rs seven and a half miles, and the shore is almost straight. In this extent there are some patches of beach and coral bottom ; other parts are deep mud, with mangrove ; sea-grape and buttonwood is the principal growth along this outer shore. The posts for the division of the land into quarter-sections were all placed, wherever it was possible to get to the positions. This report is accompanied by three tracings-one of the Mud keys, one of the Snipe keys,

No. 2.-Extracts frorn the report of Sub-.Assistant S . .A. иwainwright, on the determination of shore-line between Point Perry and Excel,sior, on the outside of Key Largo, north.
NEWPORT, RHODE IsLAND, ..August 23, 1855. Sm.: I have the honor to report to you the progress of my work in Section YI, Florida reef, and to send you the accompanying sketch, showing the portion executed by my party during the present season. This comprised the determination of shore-line between Point Perry and Excelsior, on the outside of Key Largo, north. Its aggregate length is about thirty-three miles, including the various indentations of the coast. Three square miles of the interior were surveyed, and the work of the season involved the cutting of somewhat less than two miles, for a line of sight. Several attempts made to place the section posts for the General Land Office proved ineffectual, and, in accordance with your directions, I have deferred their establishment until the adoption of a method for overcoming the difficulties experienced in the attempts which have been made. Signals were placed in the positions determined for the posts, to serve a convenient purpose in placing them hereafter. The difficulty referred to arises from the nature of the shore, which is entirely of rock, and impenetrable to any of the ordinary means employed for the pla.cing of marks intended to be permanent. Amongst other expedients I tried posts furnished with iron braces, bent a.t right-angles and placed at opposite sides, but found that the rock crumbled away from the spikes driven in to secure them, and that the posts washed away. The shore-line has yet to be traced, and the inside of the keys from a point about two miles Hild a half from Angelfish creek down to the limits of the outside shore-line; and the completion of this will bring the topographical work up to the present limit of triangulation. The difficulties presented in its execution are almost insuperable. Operations on foot are in many places impossible, and in others the waier is so shallow for miles in the coves that boats cannot be got through them. The chief difficulty is in establishing the positions for section posts, a great number of stations being necessary for the purpose. It is often impossible to procure any suitable station, owing to the softness of the bottom, and to the thick growth of bushes on the shores. My work was very much delayed by the stormy character of the season. Respectfully, S. A. WAINWRIGHT, Sub-Assistant lJ. S. Coast Sttrvey. Professor A. D. BACHE, Superintendent.

I decided to postpone the definite division into quarter-sections until this key and those adjacen~ were connected by triangulation with Key West, so as to make the whole system more

plam. The marks are secured, however, and afford means of sale, should it be desired to press the sale.

No. 3.-Extrac 1s frorn the reJJOrt of Assistant H. L. Whiting, in regard to cutting of lines and marking quarter-sections. CoAsT SuRVEY ScHOONER AGASSIZ, April 9, 1855. Sm: * * * l\:'.Iy operations have been conducted without interruption or delay, and all vossible available time has been improved to the utmost. The weather has been generally favorable, and my work itself has been quite satisfactory. I l ave reviewed three sheets of work in Key Biscayne bay, comprising the work of parts of two seasons; one sheet of work at the north end of Key Largo, executed during the last. season and this; two sheets of work northeast from Boca Chica during last season and this ; and one sheet of Boca Chica The cruising in execution of this work has been about seven hundred and fifty (750) miles. The time occupied, including all the changes from place to place and from vessel to vessel, has been from the 8th of March to 9th of April. With regard to the particulars and results of my examination of the topographical work referred to, I can report it as highly satisfactory. I have gone over a large portion of all the work, and where I have examined it I have done so very closely Lnd critically, and I am most glad to say that I have found no important errors whatever.
DEAR

With regard to the question of cutting the lines in order to make the corner sections, it can be done, of course ; but the time and expense will be an important consideration. Some of the larger keys are covered with a dense growth of mangrove and other trees, which are the hardest wood to cut. The heat and mosquitoes in the woods, and the work of chopping, make the men of our parties, as now organized, at times absolutely refuse to work. The most practicable and efficient way to accomplish this would be to hire gangs of men expressly for this purpose, or to give out the cutting hy contract. If a gang of choppers was engaged equal in force to our parties, I think one topographical party could keep at least three such gangs. constantly at work. From this comparison (and I am confident I have not overstated it) some idea can be formed of the time and expense which it will take to open all these lines. There is another point that has suggested itself to me in relation to this question, which may not be admissible in the Land Office survey, however. This is the necessity of cutting these lines or making the interior corner sections. If the object of the Land Office survey is to define and locate the particular sections and quarter-sections sufficiently to enable those who take up the land to identify them, this is accomplished, it appears to me, beyond all question, by the marking as now done. The fact of the section-lines terminating and intersecting with the slwre-line on all sides of the keys, makos a positive and definiteJpoint, and a mathematical determination of the sections.

No. 4.-Extractfrom the report of Sub-Assistant John Rockwell, U. S. Coast Survey. ROCKAWAY, September 1'7, 1855. Sm: * * * The keys extending between the line Rock Point-Eastern Sambo, and eastward as far as the line Loggerhead key-Palmetto (near Newfoundland harbor,) over which the triangulation was carried this season, may safely be characterized as being as valueless ~s any in Florida. The foundation of Coral Rock is furnished with but a scanty covering of soil. In some places, mangrove and buttonwood trees will grow; in others, nothing more

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

than the bush mangrove; and in most places, nothing at all. The really solid land, moreover, forms but a small proportion of the territory. A large part is covered by an intricate system of shallow creeks and lagoons, which cut up and separate the keys, and another part by swamps, where the mangrove grows to a considerable size and with wonderful density. "\Vithin this region there are two or three settlements of single houses on spots where sufficient soil has lieen found to cultivate a few vegetables and fruits. The quality of the soil appears to be good enough to produce all that is elsewhere raised in similar dirnates; and such trees or plants as require no great depth of earth :flourish well. But the su1)ply of soil is quite de.fieient, and the spots where even what I have mentioned can be accomplished are compa:ratively few. There is still an opportunity, however, to effect a good deal more than has been done in the way of cultivation of the soil. There is available land enough on tliese keys, within a reasonable distance from Key West, to supply that market with such articles as can be raised; but the town is at present dependent for its supplies upon importation from the main land of Florida and the northern States. Sponges are obtained in the shallow waters amongst the keys in considerable quantity, and though not a very important item, they form one of the articles of export from Key West. The keys present many obstacles and few facilities for the prosecution of the survey. The shoalness of the water between them prevents access with the vessel oftentimes within five, six, or eight miles from the points where the work may happen to be in progress ; and approach even with boats is dependent upon wind aml tide, and, in many cases, very difficult. The mangrove swamps which abound on the keys are among the most formidable difficulties. Tall signals become necessary in order to be visible above the trees, and lines have not unfrequently to be opened through the swamps. This is a slow, laborious, and expensive operation. The swamps are over:fiowed at high tide, and the mud, water, and mosquitoes that abound in them are beyond description, and these, with the intense heat of the climate, render the work of cutting almost impossible. The labor of opening lines and dragging boats over the shoals has proved to be very severe upon the crew of the vessel. The only locality where provisions and good water can be obtained is at Key West, and no small amount of time is lost in running to that port for supplies.

WASHINGTON, D. C., 1Jiay 20, 1855. Sm: The triangulation party, under my charge, commenced their field operations on the 7th of January, 1855. The first two weeks were employed in reconnoitring from Indian key, on the inner side of !ey Largo, in a northerly direction, when, finding it impossible to reach my work that wa,y, e vess~l .proceeded through Angelfish creek to my last anchorage of the preceding year. F Remaimng at this point, the triangulation was carried on with small boats until the 20th of ebruary, _when it became impossible from the great distance of the work from the schooner. b Proceedmg to Key West, the "Bowditch" was turned over to Mr. Whiting, on his arrival, Y the steamer.

While employed in carrying on the triangulation, I took advantage of favorable winds to reconnoitre that portion of the sounds between Key Largo and the main shore, and was unable in many places to get more than half way across with the small boat, on account of the bars which connect the different keys having no channels, as heretofore. From this I concluded it was next to impossible to cover this portion of the sounds with triangles coming off my last base; it being some two miles and a half in length, and the sounds fifteen or sixteen in breadth. I would respectfully suggest coming off the base at Cape Sable, or from one below Indian key, and carrying the triangulation northwardly towards my last points, as more likely to be successful. Very respectfully,

I would further state that I measured two bases of about four miles in length, one on Key Biscayne and the other on Cape Sable Prairie; which afford means of immediate division of their localities, if it is desired to place them in the market. Cape Sable Prairie is a beautiful piece of ground, though so recently formed that the s2il is still highly impregnated with salt. The chief component of the soil is calcareous matter, derived from finely divided corals. Very respectfully, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent.

Extrac~ from

a descriptive report made to the Superintendent by Assistant George Davirlson, upan localities on tlie western co<UJt of tlie United States /ro1n the rwrth entrance of Rosario strait, W. T., to the southern boundary of California.

Rosario Strait and Canal de Haro.* * * * A vessel entering Rosario strait with a favorable tide and wind can get through in one tide frorn either entrance, the other being visible. In coming from the north, if the wind fails, it would be advisable to anchor on the shoal north of the Matia group. Anchorages can be had under Village Point (Lummi island;) in Strawberry bay, (Cypress island;) and in the shoal bight running from James island southward to Kellett's Ledge. No boat can pull against the currents here, and the roar of them is like that of a. gale of wind through a forest. A kn<nvledge

of their peculi!trities is very desirabfo. Th('re is a long and large, and a short and small tille, the same as on the coast. The greatest height of ti<le noticed was between twelve and fifteen feet. Dangers.-Two sunken rocks occur in Rosario strait, visible at very low water, northwest of Lummi island. The Belle Rock, near the Bird Rocks, is likewise visible at extreme low water ; as also Kellett's Ledge and Entrance Rock. These, with Peapods, Black and Bird Rocks, and others not visible, are a drawback to navigation, and occasion much anxiety when the wind fails.
Canal de Haro is ten miles longer than Rosario strait, and makes a right-angle in its course.

The volume of water passing through it is also greater and the currents stronger. The anchorages are not reliable. It is advisable to keep always in mid-channel, though no unseen dangers now exist within my knowledge except Unit Rock. If the wind is light, vessels bound north should keep quite clear of the inside Nahnymoh cl1annel, so as not to be drifted into it. Good anchorage is found in Cordova bay, with plenty of wood and water; as also on the north side of Sidney island, and under иWaldron. The anchorage at Stuart's I do not consider practicable, especially for sailing-vessels. Bellevue island (Sau Juan) is the resort of great numbers of Indians, with an extensive fishery near Henry island, and an old fishing station on the inside of the southeastern extremity. Canal de Haro is wider than Rosario, and an inside channel leads from it in a northwesterly direction to the Nahnymoh coal mine~. It had not been surveyed, so far as I have found, previous to the time of our survey. The soil of the islands forming the straits is scarce and poor, and very dry during the summer. The islands generally are covered with a thick growth of Oregon pine, other kinds of Wood being exceptional. The highest mountains are Constиitution on Orcas, Lake on Cypress, Erie on Fidalgo, and Lummi peak on Lummi, ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 feet in height. The top of Mount Constit.ution is destitute of trees. Most of the islands abound in deer, and elk are found in great numbers on Orcas. All the islands present the same general geological features ; sandstone and conglomerate prevail, in some cases to a thickness of several thousand feet, with a very great dip, which in some instances is almost perpendicular. и There are indications of coal on Patos, Lucia, -Orcas, and Lopez. On Orcas (N. vV. point) there is said to be a seam thirty-two feet thick. At Bellingham bay coal exists in quite numerous and apparently extensive veins, varying from six to sixteen feet, and of several qualities. It .ignites readily, burns rapidly, with intense heat, much flame and volumes of smoke, and berng lighter requires greater space for stowage than other coals. Some of it produces an almost incredible amount of clinker. Extensive beds no doubt crop out on the borders of the streams, running to the waters west of the main land. The straits are navigated only by fishing-vessels. Those arriving for Bellingham coal and vessels of the Hudson's Bay Company invariably pass through Rosario strait. All traffic in these waters will eventually be carried on by small steamers or tow-boats. A steamer now runs regularly between Olympia and Victoria, and last year made trips to the Columbia river. I consider the islands between Canal de Haro and Rosario strait as fitted only for limited settle~ent; there being little arable land and a great scarcity of fresh water. They can be used ~ tishing depots, and coal, perhaps, exists on some of them. The Hudson's Bay Company as a settlement on Bellevue island, at the point so designated on my map of last year's work. Settlers are gradually coming up Admiralty inlet towards the Bellingham bay district, and many have claims on Whidbey island. dA_dmiraJ,ty i'lll,et-Puget's sownd.-Of this vast inland arm of the sea I cannot speak as ~ visedly as of other parta of the coast, though having gone as high up as Olympia, I was able observe the fooilities which it offers for steamboat navigation.

for as population advances. The trade is already very considerable, a number of saw-mills giving freight for a large carrying trnde to San Francisco, the Sandwich islands, and .Australia. The soil bordering t11is sound is not as good, generally, as tlrnt of the \Val1amut or Columbia river valleys. * * * * 'l'he tides at the head of the sound rise and fall about twenty feet at extremes, leaving a muddy :flat half a mile in width. I have been unable thus far to Бnd any Rite suitable for a base. The country is densely * * * * * wooded to the water's edge, and the shores and bluffs are high. * Strait of Juan de Fuca . * * иии Commencing at the eastern extrem~ty of the strait, the first object of interest is Smith's island. The sketch of my preliminary survey, furnished to you, will give an idea of its size. (See .Appendix No. 76.) * * * * V cssels coming into the straits from sea should at first hold well to the Vancouver side, and thus avoid Duncan's rock and Tatoosh island if the wind fails, as there is generally a very short, heavy swell coming in, and vessels passing between the two incur much risk. SnbAssistant Lawson saw from Tatoosh what lie supposes to be a rock half way between that island ancl Duncan's rock. He tried several times to land on Duncan's, but always without success. A reef occurs between Tatoosh and the main, and the currents in this vicinity are very strong. After passing N eeah bay on one side and San Juan on the other) vessels may anchor almost anywhere along the straits close in-shore; but good berth must be given to Race island, the Trial islands, and Discovery islands, as the currents running past them arn exceedingly swift. The southern shore of De Fuca's strait is inhabited by Indians living in stockaded villages. They are tolerably expert in the use of fire-arms, of which they seem to have a good supply. Kind treatment may do much towards conciliating them, but it is well to be prepared to resist any aggression on their part. Polygamy is tolerated among them. They live mostly by fishing, but succeed in cultivating very good potatoes. Both sides of the Straits of Fuca are covered with an extensive growth of fir, and station points for the survey must necessarily be chosen as near the coast-line as possible, as it will be impracticable to carry tlrn lines inland. Kellett's chart gives a very good idea of the strait, and being on a large scale, it is deservedly prized by navigators. Settlements are gradually advancing from Puget's sound along the strait towards Cape Flattery, and seem destined to meet those coming up the coast from Gray's harbor and Shoalwater bay. No signs of coal or indications of gold have yet been found along the shores. New Dungenn;s is a safe anchorage, where wood and water may be obtained; the last, however, only at particular stages of the tide, as the immense flat"at the mouth of the stream will not admit the passage of boats except on full or half tide. False Dunqeness is a l>etter anchorage, but, from my observation made during only one visit, it offers no facilities for watering. Several Indian villages are found on the southern side. Wood and water in abundance will be found at Neeah bay. * * * * From Cape Flattery to Gray's harbor (in about 46░ 58' N.) there is nothing special to remark. Vessels bound for that lrnrbor must follow the line of the beach closely till off the entrance. This stretch of coast bas ever been notorious for the hostility and vindictiveness of the Indians inhabiting it-several Spanish and English vessels and crews having been taken and destroyed; and hence the names "Destruction island," "Isla de Dolores," "Punta de .Martyres," &:c. The number of small streams emptying on this line of coast affords to the Indians a constant gource of supply in the salmon, with which they abound. Oil is obtained in considerable quantity from the black-fish and whale, which they fearlessly attack and capture. Sho~water bay.-The country in this region is filling up rapidly, and trade is carried on in the shipment of oysters~ the bay furnishing nearly all required in the southern markets. Gray's harbor is perhaps as productive, but the article is not obtained at any other points north of San Francisco. Shoalwa.ter bay exMnds nearly to Baker's bay, or the north side of the

Columbia river, and the Indians pass from one to the other over a portage about a mile in width. * * * * * * * * * * Columbia river.- * * * In summer there is rarely any risk in crossing the bar under the charge of a pilot, but in winter the heavy swell breaking from Capo Disappointment to Point Adams, changing as it does the course of the channel, renders the entrance extremely difficult, and the exit almost impossible. The utmost vigilance of the best pilots is required to keep the run of the gradual but sometimes sudden changes. Vesseb are frequently detained for weeks in waiting to get out, and those arriving off the harbor as long to get in. The trade of the river would doubtless warrant the regular employment of a tug, (propeller,) as now in use at Humboldt bay. No loss has occurred there, during three years, to any vessel under charge of the tug and her pilot. The plan seems a.s well adapted to the Columbia, as the anchorage in :Baker's bay, close under the cape, is practicable, and the top of the cape is a good lookout. The north channel would afford a safe and easy exit from the anchorage. (See McA.rthur's chart.) Judging from the formation of the cape, the passage from the north channel, seaward, is less liable to change than the south, but this can be determined only by a close comparison of all the surveys of the entrance. * * * * * * * The topography of Columbia river entrance should be executed to include Cathlamet bay, and north along the ocean shore, running thence to Shoalwater bay entrance, as the basaltic formation on this strip is a peculiarity of the approaches of the Columbia. Any navigator noticing the features of the Shoal water bay entrance will not mistake it for tha.t of the Columbia. The triangulation should be carried as far as Oregon City, up W allamut, and to the cascades of the Columbia river. This will be a work of great labor, and must expose the party to sickness, as persons settling rarely escape the fever and ague in the wort't form. * * Though very desirable, it will always be difficult to make the published hydrographic surveys a record of the changes occurring constantly at the entrance of the Columbia. I have designated "Oape Disappointment'' by that name because it is never known as Cape Hancock on the western coast.

From Oolwnibia riveiи to Oape Blanco.-The name Blanco appears to have been applied before "Orford," and moreover very well expresses the appearance of the cape. The bluff is about a hundred feet high, and nearly perpendicular, with whitish sides. The top is covered with trees, which give it the appearance of an island in making it from the north or south, the neck and some distance back to the main being destitute of trees. This line of coast is nearly straight. Tillamuk is a bold, prominent, and readily remembered and recognised headland, at the southern termination of the long sand-beach runniag from Point Adams. * * * * * * * * * From Tillamuk the coast presents a country well watered by numerous small streams emptying into the ocean. It is densely covered with timber, and for a few miles back looks favorably from the deck of a vessel. The Tillamuk bay is said to be several miles in length, but the entrance is such that it can be made only under the most favorable circumstances, there being very little water on the bar. Between Tillamuk and Koos bay the country (excepting the headlands shooting into the ocean) appears low, and well watered for many miles back, but vessels cannot approach from the sea..
North of the Koos is Umpquah river, the largest stream between the Columbia and the Sacra1?ento. The entrance is long and narrow, with about thirteen feet of water on the bar at low tide.. This river is said to drain an extremely fertile region, well adapted to agriculture and grazing, and abounding in prairie land. The valley of the Umpquah is filling up with

water on it at low tide. The coal once alleged to exist here is now pronounced a lignite, and cannot be used as fuel. The geology of this section docs not give any promise of coal. I have been informed that vessels anchoring close in with the bluff between Cape Arago and the Koos bar may ride out heavy southeasters; and if so, it is important, no other place between Sir Francis Drake's and Neeah bay affording that facility. The Coquille river, entering about :fifteen miles south of Cape Arago, has been followed a distance of thirty miles, giving a depth throughout of not less than fifteen foet, and an average width of forty yards. It drains a very fertile region, abounding in many varieties of timber. l:1" umerous Indian encampments are found upon its banks, and quite extensive fish-weirs. When off t11c entrance last year we saw about a dozen houses which had been built by the miners then engaged in washing the auriferous sand and gravel found on the beach between that point and Rogue's river. A small stream (Six's river) empties into the ocean a mile north of Cape Blanco. A preliminary survey of the reef off Cape Blanco has been made, s)lowing its relative position and the passage through it. In the country near Port Orford is found the finest white cedar, and, so far as I know, this is the only locality in which it occurs along the coast. Port Orford is the best summer anchorage between Drake's bay and the Columbia. It is about seventy miles distant from the mines in the interior, and on the opening of a road would become a large depot of supply. Rogue's river, so called from the c1!aracter of the Indians inhabiting its banks, deservedly merits the appellation. One vessel has entered, was attacked, deserted, and was then burnt by the Indians. The water always breaks upon the bar, and the reef off the entrance demands attention. Illinois river.-The naming of this river is made merely upon the guess of some miners and settlers at its mouth, which they had reached by following the coast from Crescent City. * * The river is fifty or sixty yards wide, deep and sluggish, else it would, during summer, force its way through the gravel-beach at its mouth. Indian huts in great number appeared on the banks, but most of the occupants were then engaged higher up the river in taking salmon. Smith' sriver.-The entrance of this river I looked for in vain from the deck of the vessel, though scarcely two miles from the shore, and I was able to form a pretty good estimate as to where it should open. The "Smith's river" of the maps is a myth. The reef of the coast hence to Crescent City, like the Rogue's river and Blanco reefs, demands an examination. Crescent Oity.-The anchorage is rocky and uncertain. The beach is low and sandy. Klamath rfoer.-The mouth of this river was closed in 1851. I believe one or two vessels have entered it. Trinidad bay affords a safe anchorage in summer. * * * 'l'he land in the vicinity is very rich and well adapted to agriculture. Red-wood trees grow in this vicinity, and attain an enormous size. 'fhe stump of one which we measured was about twenty feet in diameter, and a dozen in its vicinity averaged over ten feet. One is said to be standing on the bank of a small stream on the south side of the bay that will measure thirtv-two feet in diameter. The trees are quite straight, branch at :fifty to a hundred feet from the ground, and frequently attain a height of two hundred feet. .A forest of red-wood presents a magni:ficent sight. Mad river empties about a mile above Humboldt bay. Egress is shut out by the breaking on the bar; but the vast amount of lumber in its valley will soon :find an exit through a canal to Humboldt bay. A deep slough from the latter approaches quite close to Mad river, near its mouth, thus favoring the execution of such a project. I am informed that the river averages a hundred yards in width. Humholdt bay.-(See Appendix No. 28, C. S. Report 1854, and Appendix No. 76 of this report.) 1l The Eel River valley is, perhaps, one of the most fertile on the western coast, and is rapi~ly filling with settlers. The Indian name of the river or valley is" Weeot," probably signifying ptenty.

The only vessel taken into this river thumped over the bar in 1850. It is said to have nine feet water on it. South of Eel river, the first bold headland is False Mendocino, one of the terminations of a ridge from the interior. Bear river empties between that and Cape Mendocino. A minute examination of the coast thereabouts may possibly determine a landing place for boats through the surf during fine weather. Off Mendocino ("Cape of Perils" of Ferrelo) lies Blunt's reef, and I am told that a ridge runs westward from Mendocino, upon which soundings have been obtained at a considerable distance from the coast. The fact would be of great importance to coasters when near the shore in thick weather, as it would give their position and enable them to change their course according to the trend of the shore. Shelter cove may be regarded as a harbor of refuge, and vessels running for it in great stress of weather will find good anchorage in four fathoms water. In coming from it southward, a good berth must be given to the point, which is rocky. The place affords water and some
w~.

Mendocino City is the site of a large lumber establishment, which produces about forty thousand feet per day. The anchorage is small and not available in winter. In entering, the north point should be kept as close aboard as possible, and rounded to the anchorage in four fathoms. There is always an uncomfortable swell here. The Noyou river cannot be entered, the water constantly breaking on the bar. The same is true of the centre of the bay, about midway between the north and south points. Albion river is a stream of little importance, and offers no facility whatever as a harbor, at least for sailing-vessels. Point Arena is comparatively low, partially covered with sand, and bare of trees for some distance from the coast-line. The land is well watered in this region, and suited to agriculture. There is no landing. * * * * * * * Haven's anchorage would be difficult to recognise, unless the position of a vessel approaching it had been exactly determined. * * * * * * Bodega bay affords good anchorage under the north side. Vessels coming from the north in thick hazy weather are apt to mistake this locality for Point Reyes, though on making the last mentioned point the same doubt does not arise. The British survey, especially of the northern part of the bay, seems to be accurate. Tamales bay is entered from the south side of Bodega bay, and forms a sheet of water extending southward and eastward ten or fifteen miles, and terminating in the vicinity of the Lagoon Delimantour, which runs northward from Drake's bay. It is a succession of flats, generally visible at low water, but having a crooked and narrow channel through them. Point Reyes and Sir F1иancis Drake's bay.-The Point, as will be seen by the topographical survey of Sub-Assistant Lawson, is a bold and readily distinguishable headland extending about three miles, with a precipitous face to the southward. * * * * The bay affords a good harbor of refuge in heavy weather, from either the north or south, and merit~ a hydrographic survey, as its facilities a~e now known only to the coasters. In certain cases it has been resorted to by vessels of the largest class. Farallones.-On the last map sent to you I have made a note of the alleged existence of a * * * * * rock about S. S. E. of the north Farallon. The Golden Gate.* * * It would doubtless be a matter of interest t~ obs~rve closely the strength of the current making through the Golden Gate, and its general direction across the bar. * * The plan of fog signalling, superior to whistles or bells, and now in practice at Monterey, would doubtless be of service here. A vessel ap~roaching in a fog, or on a thick night, on firing a gun, and being answered from Fort Point, could judge of the proximity by the report.

San Francisco.-A re-survey of the city, a little beyond the limits of the present sheet, would be of much moment, to show the remarkable growth and development of the place, and the cbanges which have occurred. * * * * * * From the Golden Gate to .!Jionterey bay (the "Bay of Pines" of the Spaniards) there is little to attract notice. The mountains rising from the shore are about two thousand feet high, and destitute of trees, but during the rainy season (winter) they present a green and lively appearance. Large herds of cattle roam through the valleys. Ap1iroaching Santa Cruz the country shows the labor of the husbandman, and its pr-oductiveness is astonishing. This is one of the garden-spots of California. Two or three rivers enter into Monterey bay, draining the Salinas. A specimen of silver ore now in my possession was found in the vicinity, and it is affirmed that the ore is found there in abundance. The occurrence of cinnabar is proven by the successful operations of the New Almaden mines. Bitumen is found on the Salinas river. Monterey presents a beautiful appearance in approaching it from the sea ; the surrounding country, by its alternation of hill and valley, attracting tlie attention of the most casual obsetlt.er. * * * * * * * * At Point Cypress is found the wood from which it takes its name, and so far as known it is found nowhere else along the coast. From Point Carmel to Piedras Blancas the coast is nearly a straight line, the hills destitute of wood coming down to the line of the coast. The valleys between them are the resort of the grizzly bear. The hills range from fifteen hundred to twenty-five hundred feet in height. In the vicinity of San Simeon the country presents an aspect favorable to agriculture. The soil is light and very productive. On the sketch I have marked the best landing-place for boats. The hills at San Luis Ob1'spo come down to the coast, and the town itself lies about ten miles back, in the middle of a fertile country. On the bay I discovered many fossil remains in a coarse dark-colored sandstone, lying under hills of what appeared to be soft magnesian limestone. The remains are of enormous size, but can be obtained only by great labor. The landing at San Luis Obispo is at all times bad. On the coast chart I have directed your attention to a rock, said to exist about S.S. W., eight miles from the first rock north of San Luis Obispo bay. Point Conception has been already described in my regular reports. The anchorage of the Coxo is a good one in summer. From thence to Santa Barbara the coast is nearly straight, running east and west, the hills for twenty miles coming down to the coast, forcing the traveller to leave the beach for their sea-slope. The trail passes over hills and down steep slopes, running through valleys in a rich grazingcountry until within fifteen miles of Santa Barbara, where the hills recede from the shore, leaving a good margin of land for cultivation. The coast trail from the north comes in through the St. Inez valley to the shore, and from thence turns southward along the coast. A la1ge bitumen pit, about eight miles west of Santa Barbara, empties directly into the ocean, and the bitumen floating on the water works against the summer winds, even beyond Point Conception. Navigators, in making the Santa Barbara channel, readily estimate their approach at night by the peculiar odor of the bitumen. * * * * Santa. Barbara is a town of considerable size, and lies in the middle of an agricultural tract running ea.st and west. The mission is one of the best establishments of the kind in California, and in the gardens attached to it the grape and olive are cultivated. In summer, vessels can easily anchor inside of the kelp, but the winter gales detach and dr~ve the kelp shoreward, in such vast quantity that cables of vessels becoming foul must of necessity be let go.

San Pedro bay.-This anchorage is one of the best on the coast in summer, and I witnessed an instance of a vessel there riding out a gale in winter. The attempt to make an inner harbor within the lagoon will never be made by any one who has ex11erienced a southeaster in that vicinity. * * * * * * * * The town of Los .Angeles is about twenty-two miles by the road from San Pedro. It is the centre of an extensive grape-growing region, which doubtless will in time furnish the coast w.th wine. The quantity of grapes and fruit already shipping to San Francisco is very considerable. The olive grows here. The country at the foot of the Black hills is as productive as any in California, but its distance from a large market is a great drawback to extensive improvement. The plains are literally covered with herds of cattle, and some of the large proprietors count their yearly increase by thousands. These cattle are driven to the mining districts, and to San Francisco. The coasting trade of San Pedro is now greater than the aggregate trade of all the other ports southward of San Francisco. The rm'ssion of San Luis Rey is the largest in .Alta California. It is the centre of a country unequalled for salubrity and productiveness, and the number of domesticated Indians in its neighborhood give it the appearance of a la~e and busy town. It is now a military post. San Diego.* * This harbor is the second in point of excellence on the coast, and the only drawback is want of wood and water for supplying vessels. An artesian well was commenced at La Playa, but abandoned after reaching a depth of six hundred and :fifty feet, at a cost which would perhaps have sufficed for bringing water from the San Diego river in small pipes. * * It is a curious fact that in summer the current along the coast of the Pacific sets from east to west, while among the islands in Santa Barbara channel it runs southerly. I have no doubt that the " Wi1ifield Scott" was set on shore by this current. On Cortez Bank it frequently sets against the wind at a rate of nearly two knots per hour. * * * * * * Tlie kelp of Puca' s straits grows from the bottom, has a very long, very thin, smooth and hollow stem, from an eighth to three sixteenths of an inch in diameter, until it reaches within twenty feet of the surface, when it gradually increases in size to about an inch and a half to two inches, finally expanding to a hollow bulb three or four inches in diameter. This bulb floats upon the surface, sustaining from ten to twenty very long, broad, smooth leaves, the edges of which, being at intervals contracted and expanded in width, present a ru:ffied appearance. Some of the stems are from twenty to thirty fathoms long. The leaves attain a length of about fifteen feet, and are from eight to ten inches broad. Tlte kelp of California is different from that just described. Some of the masses in the Santa Barbara channel are arborescent, large stems or trunks coming up from the bottom, which is there generally rocky, and bearing minor stems and leaves. This kelp does not, like the other, grow from such considerable depths, but, like it, rises to the surface and there floats. The main stems are sometimes a foot in diameter. The immense fields of kelp on the western coast will in time become a source of profit and revenue to those engaged in obtaining from them their valuable products. At present the want of facilities and scarcity of laborers forbid the attempt. My experience on the western coast warrants the observation that kelp may be regarded as an indication of a rocky bottom. It is always present where sunken rocks exist, unless torn off by the violence of the weather. T.be ~atura.l deduction from the fact is, that kelp, growing, should be avoided in general navigation. In reference to facilities for carrying on the work of the Coast Survey on the western coast I ma.y remark, that the whole of Washington and Oregon Territories may be described in few

words as an almost impenetrable forest, the trees acquiring a great size and height, and guardecl by a dense undergrowth, barring convenient passage alike to the Indian and the settler. The rainy season commences in Oregon earlier than at the south, with heavy, soaking rains. At the mouth of the Columbia we had rain in summer, and, what was strange to us, thunder and lightning, which we experienced again only last summer in Rosario strait. The rainy season sets in about the middle of October, and continues until the end of April. The same may be said of Washington Territory, but perhaps the period of wet weather is even longer. The triangulation of Washington can be carried on from Cape Flattery to the head of. Puget's sound and to the 49th parallel, although I have yet found but one base site, and that of very moderate leng~h. Considering the reliable chart of Kellett, I think it advisable to work from Admiralty inlet up the sound, as this will afford the best means of finding a suitable base, and in another point of view it will commence the work where the population is :first settling. The Straits of Fuca may be reconnoitred and signals and stations established, following with the triangulation, as might best answer in conjunction with the work laid out in Puget's sound. The features of the shores require that the topography should be executed on the scale 20 ~ 00, working with a double party ; a vessel being furnished, so as not to impede the triangulation, as the plane-table work cannot possibly keep pace with it. The chances and facilities for encamping are very few, and the practice would involve vexatious and unprofitable delay. North from San Francisco, the triangulation can be carried on for a hundred miles without much interference from wooded mountains. North of Bodega the timber commences and increases in density and size as we proceed north, so that at Mendocino none of the hills are left bare. The woods are dense, and progress through them can be effected only by opening roads, or by falling into some Indian trail or deer path. The woods descending to the ocean, renders it difficult to carry even a small triangulation along the coast. North of Mendocino and the Humboldt region, the country is one sea of timber of immense growth, and the undergrowth and fallen trees would sometimes make it impossible to convey a party beyond a mile in a day. .After repeated attempts by a party of government troops with officers, and accompanied by a topographical engineer, the Oregon trail was reached from Port Orford, but not without great privation and hardships. Several contracts taken for the survey of sections near Mendocino have been thrown up, although closed at large prices, and the Surveyor General of Oregon attempted several lines from the Wallamut valley before he could force his way through to the Pacific. The triangulation can be extended southward from San Francisco to meet that of the Santa Barbara channel. The hills are bare and very high. The elevated ridge back of Santa Barbara channel is sharp and precipitous, with no trails to the summit in the vicinity of Santa Barbara. I found it utterly impossible to gain the top in two trials. The gulches are filled with huge boulders and fragments of rock, and the sides covered with trees and undergrowth. Parties operating here would require camp equipage and full means of transportation by mules. The rainy season commences about the first of November, and ends in the middle of March. In some seasons, November and January are favorable for work, though as a general thing the attempt. to work in winter will not warrant the outlay. The islands in Santa Barbara channel are high and difficult of ascent, and present many obstacles to the triangulation of the channel. On some of the islands it will be necessary to duplicate the stations. Santa Catalina I estimate rises to the height of three thousand feet. I would recommend the selection of points on the main, near the shore, but sufficiently elevated to admit of lines passing over not only the ordinary exhalations, but the fogs of the channel. In summer the fogs lie between the islands and the main, and coming in from seaward at sunset, frequently envelop the islands themselves. When the islands are not enveloped, their tops can be seen from elevated stations on shore. The rainy season begins between the

middle of November and the first of December, and ends about the first of March. Frequent intervals favorable for work occur during the rainy season. In summer it is impracticable to observe on lines running over plains, such as those near San Pedro, or shallow water. иwater is easily obtained at Prisoner's Harbor and at San Pedro, though it must be carted one or two miles to the landing. Some wood can be 1irocuretl at Prisoner's Harbor, but it is not so Rcarce at Santa Barbara. "\Vater at the Coxo is not good, and wood anrl water from the St. Inez valley must be taken through the surf in supplying vessels. Very respectfully, GEORGE DAYIDSO:N", Assistant Ooast Survey.

The country in the vicinity of Bodega is very productive, both in the valleys and on the hills which border the bay. A tract of fine agricultural country stretches behind the hill range, extending north towards Russian river and Petaluma. Riding from the bay towards th State prison, I was surprised at the extent and excellence of the agricultural lands. и Bodega bay must necessarily become an important shipping port for produce, though it is rapidly encroached on, and must ultimately present only a navigable creek, surrounded by marsh.

Sm: * * * * From Ano Nuevo to the valley of the Pescador, the general formation of the country is that of a table-land of three terraces, the first or lowest gradually sloping from tho foot of the second to the coast, which is exceedingly rocky and inhos11itable looking, the underlying strata being sandstone. But a few acres of this part of the countrv is under cultivation, the remainder being exclusively devoted to the grazing of cattle, to ~hich, from the abundance of water to be had at all seasons of the year, it is admirably suited. In the valley of the Pescador there are about three square miles of fine arable land, all of which has been taken up by permanent settlers, who are amply rewarded for their labor by abundant harvests. This va1ley is well watered by two large streams-the Pescador and Butno. At two miles from the mouth of the valley begins the forest of redwood peculiar to this State; the timber being so near the settlements, and in such abundance, is easily obtained at a small cost. In consequence of the great scarcity of this very necessary article in the larg.er portion of the State, attention will no doubt be directed to the resources of this valley, as the means of obtaining a impply at a small cost, both from its almndance and the facilities for getting it to market, as it could be transported to, and shipped from, Pigeon Point without difficulty. The country between the valley of the Pescador and that of the San Gregoria undergoes a striking change, both in the character of its topography and geology ; instead of the table-lan<l, we here meet with a s1mr of the coast range running down to the sea, and no appearance of the sandstone can be found in the bluff, which varies in altitude from two to three hundred feet, and is intersected by a number of small valleys at "gulches" which take tbeir rise in the mountains; all of which are dry during the summer months. These give the country a very broken and rugged ap11earance. This is also a fine grazing country. Over this part there is no road exc_ept for empty wagons, the beach during the time of low water being made the highway for transporting produce. From the San Gregoria to the Tunitas the country is of exactly the same chafucter as that between the San Gregoria and Pescador. The valley of the San Gregoria is lilmall but fertile, and is watered throughout its whole extent by the stream of that name.

At the Tunitas my work on this part of the coast ends, having this creek as the northern uoundary. Between the San Gregoria and Tunitas we found and determined one of the trigonometrical points, and also one about a mile north of the Tunitas. The amount of work between the Tunitas and Point San Pedro yet to be completed is, according to a recent and very good map of San Francisco county, 19 miles of coast-line. On the 7th of June we began work on the east end of Santa Cruz island, to fulfil your instructions pf the 10th and 12th of March, by measuring a base and triangulating each way from it so as to be able, with this triangulation as a base, to determine three or more point;; on the island of Anacapa, 4! miles distant. This was the only way of making the survey with the desired minuteness and accuracy, from the fact that it was irnpossil>le to use the chain at all on the western part of the island, which is a solitary peak, 930 feet in altitude, standing on a uase of 3,560 by 1, 130 metres. On the north side of this peak there are several deep gulches with almost vertical sides, running from its apex to the bluff, which is from 250 to 300 feet above high water; on the south side the inclination is uniform from top to bottom. The chain might have been used on the other parts of the island, but even there I doubt if we would have been able to make a connected survey. During the survey of .Anacapa we were much delayed by fogs, which nearly enveloped t1w peak, on the top of which was one of my principal signals. The survey of these islands was attended with no little personal riRk. At Santa Cruz, where we were obliged to land on the sand and shingle beaches at the mouth of the " Gulches," the surf was oftentimes so heavy that even with the best management the boat would be swamped. On one of these occasions the cross-hairs in my alhidade were broken by the water getting into the tube before we could get ashore with it, although my men were always ready, instruments in hand, to jump and run as soon as the boat grounded ; with this single exception, we escaped without any more serious consequences than a thorough drenching with salt w11tcr. .At Anacapa our goiug ashore was attended with less difficulty and clanger, as we were fortunate enough to find on the north side of each division of the island places where, by getting on the rocks, we conld land with little risk. On the middle and eastern portions these landings are always good at this season, but the one on the west end is oftentimes difficult if not dangerous. This is owing to its being so near the west end of the peak, that it is exposed both to the heavy swell of the ocean and at the same time to the northwest winds. Thus a short chop sea is ]Jrocluced, in which it was oftentimes hard to prevent the boat from being thrown on the rocks. On the south side of tlw island there is no place to land except through a very hea'"Y surf. Anacapa is a place of great resort for the seal, sea-lion, and formerly of the sea otter, but the latter have been all killed off for their fur. During the time we were surveying at .Anacapa there was a small vessel engaged in seal 1.untiug. The party employed consisted of five men; they had erected try-works on the northи s~de of the middle island, at the boat landing, and up to the time of landing had tried out eighty-live barrels of oil. Fish of many varieties abound in such numbers both here and at Santa Cruz, that two or three persons in a short time can load a boat. The part of Santa Cruz surveyed is extremely ragged, barren, and entirely destitute of water, and the surface of the northeastern portion is thickly strewed with large angular pieces of ston~, broken as if by a hammer. Several species of cactus and some of the coarser grasses flourish. The only animal found here is a small gray fox. The species is very numerous. The foundation of this island, as well as that of Anacapa, is a coarse gray (almost black) sandstone, very rotten, and entirely unsuited for building. This formation is filled with innumerable cavities, which, at a little distance, give it the appearance of an old and blackened l10 neycomb .

.'rhc soil of Anacapa is loose and thin, producing only a stunt.ed species of the cactus, together with a thick-leaved succulent plant common in the vicinity of the sea-coast and in dry, sandy

localities. There is not a drop of water on this island. The east end of the island is a place of resort of countless numbers of sf'a-birds, which deposite their eggs and bring up their young in perfoct security from the disturbance of man. I doubt very much whether previous to our arrival that part of the island had ever been visited by a white man. * * * The mission of San Buenaventura was founded in 1782. It is situated at the foot of the dividing ridge between the valleys of Santa Clara and San Buenaventura, about half a mile from the shore, which at this point makes a considerable sweep to the southward, forming a cove that is sufficiently protected from the northwest to make the landing during the summer safo, and I understand that southeast winds have but little effect in comparison with that produced at San Pedro and Santa Barbara. Fifteen miles west of Buenaventura and immediately on the coast there is quite a rich mine of sulphur. Upon one occasion I visited this locality and found ashes, scoriae, and other indications of recent volcanic action. 'The ground was so hot as to be painfol to the feet, and the gas emitted almost suffocating. Surface specimens which I brought away were found to contain sixty per cent. of pure sulphur. It is but very recently that smoke and flame are said to have been seen issuing from what is called the "chimney" in tbis locality. The mine is known to but few persons, and has not as yet been workecl. The valley of San Buenaventura iR tboroughly irrigated by water from the river of the same name, which is carried to every part of it by means of ditches, and to this practice is in a great measure owing its astonishing fertility. Corn, tobacco, and all kinds of grain, fruits, and vegetables, grow to the greatest perfection. The valley of the Santa Clara at its mouth is about twenty miles wide, and through the middle flows the river Santa Clam, at this season of the year an insignificant slream, with but an inch or so of water in its channel; though after the rains of winter begin, it is from a mile to a mile and a quarter in width, and then has water enough to break through the narrow sand-beach at present separating it from the sea.

Letter of Commander Jame8 Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, commimicating information relative to the coast, harbors, and commerce of Washington Territory.
U:isITED STATES COAST SURVEY STEAMER

"ACTIVE,"

San Francisco, November 3, 1855.
DEAR Sm: Agreeably to your request, I will proceed to give you all the information I possess in Tegard to the coast, harbors, commerce, &c., of Washington Territory, commencing in t11e Gulf of Georgia, at Point Roberts, through which the 49th parallel of latitude (the northern boundary of the United States) passes. This point (Point Roberts,) coming down as it does from the north and parallel to the shore, forms a bay some seven or eight miles wide and as many deep. The u11per or northern.portion of it is dry at low water, but the bay affords good anchorage, except in the winter. The depth of water varies from two to eighteen fathoms. In the eastern extremity of this bay there is another small one, which is quite accessible a~d entirely land-locked. Just south of the last-named is Birch bay, where a good anchorage Ill four fathoms is found; but it is open to the westward, and exposed to gales in the winter time from that quarter. Five miles further south, and ten from our boundary, is the shoal discovered

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

by us in 1853. It is in mid-channel, and has on it from five to nine fathoms water, thus affording anchorage to vessels which are often becalmed in that vicinity, and owing to the great depth of water elsewhere, compelled to drift about at the mercy of the tides. Near this point the Gulf of Georgia terminates by a group of islands, which are thickly studded from the main to Vancouver's island, and which also occupy, with their Yarious channels, the space contained between that gulf and the straits of Juan de Fuca-a distance in a southerly direction of about twenty miles. The whole group covers an area of about four hundred (400) square miles. The Gulf of Georgia and straits of Juan de Fuca are connected by two good ship-channels, called on the charts respectively Haro and Rosario straits ; they arc of ;mfficient width, and navigable for vessels of the largest class. The great depth of water presents a difficulty, but anchorages may be had for the most part, as tlrn chart shows, at convenient distances along the shores. To the eastward, between Lummi island and the main, is another channel leading into Bellingham bay. At this point the settlements commence; and here also are found several veins of coal, or what would be more 1iroperly called "lignite." The Puget Sound Coal Mining Company have opened one vein, going into the bank, just above the hwel of the title, some three hundred foet ; but it has not as yet produced an article proper for steam imrpose8. It burns freely-so much sn, that this vessel consumed it in a proportion of nearly three tons to ane of good steam coal. The residuum, which is composed of clinker and ashes, amount!! to more than one-half of the actual weight of coal put. into the furnaces : still it is brought into market and used for domestic purposes at San Francisco, and brings, I am told, a remunerative price. Bellingham bay opens into Rosario straits to the southward ofLumrni island, which communicates with Deception Pass and the channel to the east of Whidbey's island. This pass is at the head of the straits of Juan de l'uca, and on the east side of the entrance to .Rosario straits. It is very narrow and difficult for sailing-vessels, owing to the current, which, at certain stages of the tide, runs with great rapidity. Whidbey' s island is thirty-five rnile8 long, aud averages three miles in width, and, from the number of settlers upon it, I s110ul<l judge that the land was better for agricultural purposes than any other in that vicinity. It is for the most part prairie, and yields very abundantly. Port Townshend is at the south entrance of Admiralty inlet, and seems to possess all the requisites of a central point. The present anchorage, under Point Hudson, where the settle~ent is, is somewhat exposed in the winter, but protection may be had on the opposite side or a little further up the bay . .Fifteen miles up Admiralty inlet, at the entrance of Hood's canal, on the west side, is Port Ludlow. The inner harbor, where there is eight fathoms water, is completely shut in hy the land, and forms a perfect basin. The proprietor of the saw-mill which is established there, and .his employes, together with a few Indians, are the only inhabitants. Five or six miles further up the canal, on the opposite side, is Port Gamble, where there is also a fine harbor ; but the entrance is more difficult than the last-named on account of the narrowness of the channel. Here, also, is a saw-mill, which is the largest in that section of the ~ountry, and here, too, there are no other settlers than those connected with the mill; nor am ., aware that there are any whites on Hood's canal, except those employed in getting out log1 10r the mills. ?-'he statement herewith enclosed (which was furnished me by Captain Pope, one of the proprietors of the mill at Port Gamble) will convey some idea of the amount invested and the immense resources of the country in that particular. Hertofore the lumber business has been ;~y ~uch overdone, and many of the mills are doing but little, while others have stopped. e difficulty of procuring labor during the past season has occasioned much embarrassment ~~o;g o~erators. The recent discovery of gold at Fort Colville, near the northern ~onfines of a.I erritory, has drawn off many of the laboring class, and some of the towns, even, are lllost depopulated from the same ca.use, so that it is quite impossible to get at the number of

190

individuals belonging io a village with any degree of accuracy. The whole number of votes cast at the last election of Delegate, &c., did not exceed fourteen hundrec1 (1,400 ;) and I am told that, instead of an increase of the population, which should be expected, there is clcidedly the reverse. Passing up the inlet, twenty-five miles from the entrance to Hood's canal, is the village of Seattle. It is situated on the main land, and at the north side of Duwamish bay. Wide mudflats extend out from the head of the bay nearly to the point' on which the town is situated. Coal, similar to that at Bellingham bay, has been discovered some ten miles up the riv\')r. The water is too deep in the bay to anchor in, except near the shoTe. There is also a small settlement at the south part of the entrance, called "Alki." The next town of any comparative importance is Steilacoom, which is just inside the entrance to Puget's sound, and twenty-seven miles from the last-named place. The fort, wheretheTe are stationed at present two companies of infantry, bears the same nam~, and is situated about one mile back from the landing, which is at the mouth of the river. The anchorage must be more or less exposed in the winter season, owing to the width of the sound at that point. Five miles further up is fort Nisqually, a Rtation still belonging to the Hudl'mn's Bay Company, from whence large quantities of furs are shipped annually. They also IJOssess extensive sheep and cattle farms. At the head of Budd's inlet, which is the head of navigation, is the flourishing town of Olympia, the seat of government. It is the largest and most important place in the Territory, but at the time when we were there, in July last, many of the inhabitants had gone to the mines, and I should judge that, like the other villages on the sound, its population is, for the most part, of a floating character. The anchorage is good, but owing to a broad flat which extends out from the town, the water does not deepen to three fathoms for nearly a mile and a half. From Olympia (to retrace my steps) to the entrance of Admiralty inlet, where it opens into the straits of Juan de Fuca, the distance is eighty-five (85) miles. The inlet and the sound, formed b;y a great arm of the sea, varying from one to three miles in width, added to the straits of Juan de Fuca, which are from ten to twenty miles wide and eighty long, making in the aggregate an inland water communication from Olympia to the Pacific ocean of one humlrcd and sixty-five miles, with no bidden dangers, bold shores, and water enough for vessels of the largest class, would, I shou1d think, attract the notice of some of our enterprising steamboat corn1mnies. One or two comfortable boats running regularly with mails, stopping at different po in ts on the sound between Olympia and Victoria, a settlement of the Hudson's Bay Company on Vancouver's island, would in a short time build up a business that could not but be exceedingly remunerative. At present, the only means of communication to be obtained is through the assistance of Indians in canoes, or small sailing-vessels, which latter is at times the most tedious. From Admiralty inlet, passing along the south shore of the straits of Juan de Fuca, the first harbors arrived at are Port Discovery and Washington Harbor. The former is perfectly accessible, while the latter has a difficult entrance and has not yet been examined by the Coast Survey; both, it would appear, are safe and commodious. Few or no regular settlers have yet wade either of these points a permanent stopping-place. There are a few whites employed there tem11orarily, I am informed, getting out spars and timber. The anchorages at New and False Dungeness are formed by long, low sand-spits, extending out from the shore and curving gradually to the eastward. The best anchorage in the latter is near the south shore, the water being too deep for that purpose near the spit. There are no settlers found beyond this vicinit~, which is about thirty mileE from .Admiralty inlet, nor are they met with again on the American side of the straits or on the coast, till you arrive at Shoal-water bay. Near Callam bay, and twenty-five miles inside the straits, several seams of coal have be?n found, and from the specimens I saw I should think that it is far better than any other yet disи covered in this range of country.

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

Nee-ah bay, which is just inside the straits, forms a tolerable temporary anchorage, but it is, even in summer, very uncomfortable, owing to the roll of the sea, which has a fair sweep into the bay. Much of that can be avoided, however, by anchoring clmrn to the kelp on the wc~t side. Pas~ing out of the straits, the only dangиer to he observed is Duncan's rock, which, however, as it is never covered by the tide, can generally be seen in time to be arnide<l. From Cape Flattery, the south point of the entrance of the straits to Point Grenville, the distance is seventy miles. The shore for the whole distance is for the most part lined with rocks. Flattery rocks are the most important ; they are situated about twelve miles Routh of the cape, and extend out about three miles from the s11ore. The outer ledge is awash, with a safe passage inside of it. The others are not at any point more than a mile or a mile and a half from the shore. The reef off Destruction island extends out about one mile, and the outer point is three miles from the shore or main land. The anchorage under Point Grenville is only tolerable, even in summer, owing to the shoal water which forces a vessel, except of light draught, to anc11or so far out tlrnt foe point can afford but little i1rotection. Twenty-three miles from this point is Gray's harbor ; it has not yet been cxamine1 by us, but I am informed that the entrance is bad, and the anchorage not to be depended upon, owing to the fact, that when the tide is out it is one broad mud-flat, intersp~rsed with narrow clrnnnell'l too intricate for navigable purposes, except by steamers of a small class. The land, too, I am tvld, is not fit for agricultural purposes ; anJ I should think this true, judging from the fact that there ia not a settler in that vicinity. Shoal-water bay comes next; it is about fifteen miles from the last-named place, ancl twcntytwo to the northward of Cape Disappointment, (Columbia riwr.) There are two good channels leading into it, but, like Gray's harbor, it is full of channels and mud-flats; still there are many good channels among them, which are easily navigated by vessels of an ordinary size. The bay is from four to eight miles wide, and twenty-three in length. It heads up to the south within five miles of Baker's bay, in the Columbia river; that portion of it being for sixteen miles shul out from the sea by a narrow strip of land about one mile wide, which extends from the entrance to Cape Disappointment. There are several streams running into the bay, and are of more or less importance. The settlers are for the most part on the Wallahpah river, w11ere, I am informed, the best land is found. Those about the bay are generally employed in collecting oysters for the San Francisco market, where great quantities are being constantly sent. The enclosed statement will give you an idea of the value of that trade, and also the number of inhabitants in that vicinity. This brings me in my report to the Columbia river, the north or right bank of which is the southern boundary of' \Vashington Territory. I know but little in reganl to the number of settlers, or amount of business in that quarter. With great respect, I am your obedient servant, Professor .A. D.

APPENDIX No. 31.

Report of Portland Harbor Commission.
The Commission organized by the city of Portland for the purpose of obtaining a plan for regulating, permanently, the line of construction of Portland harbor, and for the genera} preservation and improvement of the channels and harbor accommodations, met a.t Portland on Friday evening, October 6, and, after as careful and mature an examination of the subject submitted to it, as the limited time would allow, it is now prepared to report upon one branch of its inquiries. The information which the Commission has obtained from various sources-as, for example, from the comparison of maps of different dates, from gentlemen who are well acquainted with the former and present oonditions of the harbor, and from personal observations; the interroga-

ST.ATES COAST SURVEY.

tories which have been put to the Commission, both by gentlemen actually engaged in the prosecution of great enterprises, and by those who liave them in r,nntemplation ; the nature itself of the subject, involving as it does the application of some of the most important principles of engineering in tidal harbors ;-all combine to render it impossible that the Commission should furnish at present a full and final report of its opinions. Iu<leed, these opinions must be guided by further observations. The information alrea<ly acquired has shown the necessity for instituting a systematic investigation into the course and velocity of the tidal currents in the harbor ancl its approaches. It is also desirable that the members of the CmnmiRsion should be able to confer with each other more deliberately than their present occupations will allow. If the knowledge already collected, and tliat which is yet to be added, be properly arranged arnl digested, the report of the Commission may be hereafter referred to as a useful compilation of facts and opinions. The results of the comparisons between the old an<l new maps of the harbor shoulll be stated in detail. The capacity of the harbor at high and low water, and the condition and area of the reservoirs, should be given. The principle on which the conservation of the inner basin rests, and the circumstances under which this basin may be made most effectually to perform its office of keeping the channel open, ought to be defined, and some analysis should be presente<l of the mode in which the tidal waters are distributed during the periods of ebb and fl.nod. It will be interesting- also to consider the effect of the breakwater upon the bar, the middle ground, and the channel insicle of the middle ground; to point out the effect of the extension of several of the wharYes, and by this meau8 to arrive at some general conclusions which may at least have the effect of p:иeventing future injury. In addition to this summation of general principles, and of the results of previous experience, the Commission attaches great importance to a consideration of the future prospects of the city. The opening of new and extensive lines of railroad communication, the direct intercourse with Europe by the use of steam, and the interchanges arising from the ratification of the reciprocity treaty, concur at this moment to create a new era in the commercial history of Portland. It would not be satisfactory, either to the Commission itself or to the authorities by which it has been convened, to limit its views and recommendations to existing necessities. It entertains the hope that, with suitable study and reflection, it may be able to furnish a plan simple in its principles and admitting of a uniform extension, such as will meet the wants of an increasing commerce, and provide a safe and convenient accommodation for a large amount of shipping. This plan has yet to be matured; it has to be drawn out in an intelligible form ; and it. is to be accompanied by a full explanation of the reasons which govern the Commission in its adoption. With the foregoing views the Commission has decided to divide its report into two parts, in accordance with the suggestion contained in the instructions of the committee : one part to consist ofa recommendation in reference to the line which will form the limit of constructio1! on the north side of the harbor ; the second part to consist of a detailed statement of all the information concerning the harbor which has been gained by the study of mai)s and otherwise, of a comprehensive plan of improvement, and of the views and principles upon which the plan is based. The Commission will 1)roceed, therefore, at once to the description of what it conceives to be the best limit of construction, and to the recommendation of certain rules of conduct which car.not, as it thinks, be too early adopted or too rigidly enforced. In this description reference is had to the wharves as now existing, (October, 1854,) and as defined on the Coast Survey topographical sheet executed by Alexander W. Longfellow, Esq.: ?0 mmencing at the eastern corner of the gas company's wharf, next above the Portland bridge, in a straight line to the southern corner of the end of Robinson's wharf, and along the endиofit to the eastern corner ; thence, in a straight line, to the southern corner of the end of Central wharf, and along the end of it to the eastern corner ; thence, in a straight line, to the southern ?Orner of the end of Custom-house wharf, and along the end of it to the eastern corner ; thence, in a straight line, to the southern corner of the end of Railway wharf, and along the end of it to the eastern corner; thence, in a. atraight line, to the southern corner of the end of St. Law26

rence wharf, and along the end of it to the eastern corner ; thence, parallel to the straigh portion of the outside railroad track, to the shoals to the sontlnvard of .Fish Point. And nwrcover, the Commission recommendf' that, if any wharf lie constructed to the eastward of St. I,awrence wharf, on~r tlie deep water inside of the middle ground, the party constructinf!,' it be required to dnиdgc a channel through the middle ground one lnmdred and fifty foot wide, and to a depth not less tlrnn that of the passage leading to the deep water, which depth is now thirteen feet. The Commission has decided not to draw the line at present, eit1ier above the gas cC,mpa.ny'8 wharf or bdow Fish Point. It will be observed that this harbor line cuts off a portion of Smith's, Brown's, and Union wharves. The Commission has no wish, even if it had the power, to interfere with the estab_ lished rights of private property. It lays down a line which, in its opinion, is best suited to preserve the channel; but it remains with the city government to determine whether these wharves shall be suffered to remain as they arc. There can be no doubt that the extension of those wharves is positively injurious to the harbor, and, conversely, that it would be beneficial to the harbor if the 11rojecting extrcrni ties of those whanes were rnmoved. If they are suffered to remain, the owners should be required to maintain, by dredging, the present depth of water as far in as the Commissioners' line. In addition to the above the Commission recommends: 1. That d;edging be constantly employed in the slips, and at the extremities of the wharves wherever it is necessary. Although the harbor of Portland is a commodious one, still its capacity is not such as to admit of the neglect of this easy means of preserving its usefulness. Owing to the very soft cl1aracter of the mnd, dredging can be done at a very little expense; and it is to be remembered that the natural advantages of a harbor, like other natural advantages, are only to be preserved and enjoyed through constant care and attention. 2. The Commission recommends that the basin above Portland bridge, known as "Fore river," or "Stroudwater," be jealously kept from encroachment. The existence of Portland harbor is entirely due to this inner basin. If the latter is diminished, the former will suffer in a corresponding degree. This opinion is given without any qualification. Although the Commission is fully aware that improvements might be made in this basin, which, while they served some other valuable purpose, would also increase its scouring power, still, such improvements could only be safely conducted under the superintendence of a competent engineer. If any such alterations are Jll'O])Osed, they ought to be carefully examined and subjected to rigorous conditions. In the present state of things, however, any invasion of the tidal waters above Portland bridge will be attended with danger. 3. The Commission suggests the propriety of obtaining, from the legislature of the State, a law which will vest in the c~ty of Portland authority to remove constructions extending beyond the Commissioners' line, and also exclusive control over all the interior waters which form the natural reservoirs of Portland harbor.

Sec,ond re:port of the Commissioners on Portland harbor,
In the first report which the Commissioners had the honor to present to the city of Portland, they were compelled, by want of time, to limit themselves to those views and recommendations which, as they were informed, would receive immediate application. In foat report it was stated that materials had been collected throu<>'h the kind offices of the ' b ma.yor and officers of the city government, from intercourse with well-informed citizens, and bv a study of the maps of Portland harbor, for a. more ela.borate and comprehensive communication;

STATES COAST SURVEY.

and it was also suggested that the consultation of the Commissioners hacl led to the conception of a general plan for the preservation and improvement of the harbor. The first report having lieen designed to meet special exigencies, it does not appear necessary to make any particular referenceR to it in this place. The Commissioners propose to give to the present report a wide scope-to embody in it some of the useful information which they have acquired, and to fortify any opinions they may express by such arguments as have been furnished them either by observation or study. Previously, 1rnwever, to entering upon the main subject, they will indulge in some preliminary remarks. And first, they cannot but remark, with great satisfaction, that the case now presented is one of a novel and singularly interesting character. The common occasions for calling together a council of engineers for harbor improvements have been either to remedy natural defects, to repair the consequences of neglect, to restore a regimen wl1ich has been disturbed by natural convulsions, or to remove artificial constructions which lmve proved injuriowи to the channels. The Commissioners believe there is not one, in the long list of cases which they have met in the course of their reading, where the engineer has not been required either to undo what has been badly or thoughtlessly done, or else to do something which will supply a positive defect. But the grateful task assigned to this Commission is entirely different. It is not called upon to introduce any change into the natural state of things, or to condemn the errors of the past. Having before it a harbor of excellent capacity, with sufficient natural means of self~preservation, it is only expected to show how that capacity may be safely used, and how those means may be maintained unimpaired. Events of the most recent occurrence have given such extraordinary impulse to the business of Portland, that its shipping may not impossibly be doubled in the next ten years. Under these circumstances, the city government, with great wisdom, as it seems to the Commission, has determined to use its best endeavors to escape, in future, those great evils and expenses which have been so frequently incurred by mismanagement or neglect in other places. The most frequent examples of this mismanagement are to be found in the harbors of Great Britain and Ireland. Most of them have been brought to light by the rapid expansion of British trade during the long period of peace and prosperity which has just terminated. The study and treatment of these cases has created a special branch of applied science-the branch which treats of engineering in tidal rivers and harbors. . In the circumstances here recited, the Commissioners feel that they are acting under a great responsibility. If the course which they recommend for Portland harbor should be adopted by the present authorities, and pursued hereafter, it will depend upon them whether the expected increase of commerce is attended with a corresponding increase in the facilities for its prosecution. With this charge in view, they have not failed to bestow upon the subject a careful and impartial investigation. But, secondly, it is very evident, the Commissioners wouldиremark, that, for the adoption and successful prosecution of any plan of improvement, a controlling supervisory power over the harbors of Portland and all its interior basins must be lodged in competent hands. If no ~uch power exists, action will be always desultory, and sometimes mischievous, as it has been ~n other places. This is a position which need not be maintained by any long argument. It 18 quite apparent that owners of lands bordering on the tidal waters will, if permitted, follow out ~heir distinct designs without concert of action, with different objects in view, and with a ~P~cial regard to those objects, irrespective of any general effect that may result from them. ~is :qually apparent that, in a case of so much general importance as the present, the rights 0 ./rivate property should not be allowed to interfere with public utility. To enforce this con81 ~ration, instances may be mentioned where the exercise of private rights has caused great ~h.almost ~rremediable injury. Chester, Wexford, New Castle, Exeter, Stockton-on-Tees, Itby, Bridlingt-On, are 1mch instances. Hull, also, furnishes a striking example of the

204

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

manner in which private and corporate interests have acted mischievously. Others might be adduced from the Parliamentary reports. All of them convey the same lesson, which is, that the want of an intelligent and i1errnanent supervising authority, which will examine and regulate in all respects, however Jetailed or general, any occupation of the water area, is certain to lead to harm, anrl to produce effects which must be counteracted at some future period with difficulty, hitzard, and expense. 'rhe Commissioners have already said, in their previous report, (and they desire to repeat it here with emphasis,) that the city government of Portland is the proper body to be invested with the controlling supervisory power over the harbor of Portland and all its иadjacent waters, unles11, indeed, (which is not probable,) the legislature should establish a permanent Cornmistiion, with authority to direct constructions in all the tidal harbors of the State. In order, however, to guard against misapprehension, it may be well to say that there is no desire to encroach upon, much less to defeat, private and corporate rights. It will be readily understood that, in this question, there are two classes of interests somewhat distinct from each other-public and private. There are also two classes of objects-special and general. Neither one of the objects or interests need, necessarily, be sacrificed to the other; but it will often demand a sound discrimination to render them compatible with each other. The exercise of such a discrimination properly belongs to a durable anrl responsible body. And the Commissioners cannot but express the hope and expectation that they are now addressing a body which either is, or will hereafter be, invested with suitable controlling powers, by means of which it can restrain ignorance, allay contention, reconcile jarring иinterests, and educe the common (which is the highest) good. The plan of the present :report embraces three general divisions; which are-1st. A general description of the harbor, comprising its topography, its natural formation, and its past and actual conditions. 2d. The method of increasing its accommodations, and at the same time maintaining its depth ~ and capacity. 3d. Miscellaneous observations.
HARBORS.

Outer Harbor.
Portland, like many harbors of the first rank in this class, is naturally divided into an inner and outer harbor. The natural separation of an enclosed sheet of water into an inner and outer harbor most frequently arises from three leading causes-a better protection due to the conformation of the land in the inner harbor ; a nearer approach to the seat of business ; and an actual separation, to a certain extent, of the waters of the two parts. The last distinction is an important one to be examined, 1br where it is marked and. definite, the engineer finds his subject of harbor improvement presented to him in two branches, which meet, to be sure, finally, but which are, within certain natural limits, wholly independent of each other, and may be treated in a different manner and at different times. The final place of meeting here spoken of is, of course, the channels conducting to the sea, lying below both the inner and outer harbors. But it is apparent, where these channels are maintained by a flow from two or more interior receptacles, one of which 'constitutes the harbor proper, or principal seat of business, and bas nothing but the lower channels in common with the other receptacles, (except that the waters stand at nearly the same level in all,) that it is not only admissible, but even unavoidable to treat the improvement of each receptacle separately in all respects, except in respect to the effect of the improvement on the passages to the sea. The usual limits of division into upper or lower, or inner and outer harbors, are simply given by the form of the shores. In New York harbor, the Narrows is the point of separation, and Raritan bay and river comprise 3

OF THB UNITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY.

205

grand reservoir, the force of which is expended on the sea channels alone, no portion of it whatever being felt within the Narrows. In Boston harbor, where the inner and 'outer arc equally defined by nature and by man, Dorchester bay and Quincy bay are reservoir8 to the Light-house channel, and in this regard are co-operative with, but independent of, the higl1er receptacle. In Portland harbor, however, the mode of separatiCl'll is different. The case is one of interest to the student. The position and extent of the inner harbor are decided by the better protection and nearer approach to the seat of business, and by an actual separation in part of the waters by the peninsula on which the city of Portland stands. But the northeast boundary of the outer harbor is an imaginary line drawn over the summit-level of the waters between Peak's and Great Hog islands, and between Great Hog and l\fackey"s islands. On one side of this imaginary line, and in its immediate vicinity, the currents of foe floo<l tide tend towards the northeast, and on the other side to the southwest. On one side, the currents of the ebb tend towards the southwest, and on the other to the northeast. This is one of the numerous examples of confluence such as take place on coasts having the geographical character of the coast of Maine or the west coast of Ireland. Where these phenomena regularly occur on a grand scale, and are owing to the confluent determination of tide-waves of different periods, as in the Irish channel, they give rise to tides of great height, having little or no apparent motion at the place of meeting, and to tidal nodes, twelve hours apart, at which the currents are very ra1iid, and run almost unceasingly, while the rise and fall of the water is insignificant. A mere confluence of currents, like this of Portland, which is on a small scale and quite local, is interesting to the general student only because it exemplifies, by an humble instance, the uniformity of the law (lf action. But the knowledge of it is indispensable to the engineer, because it defines the limit of the field of his operations. 'l'he outer harbor of Portland, then, must be described as the irregular space comprised between the shores of Cape Elizabeth and the inner harbor on the south and southwest; and Jl.fackey's, Great Hog, and Peak's islands, together wHh an imaginary line on.the water joining these islands, on the north and northeast. There are two reservoirs-the Back cove and the Presumpscot-belonging to this harbor, which have no connection with the receiving basin of the inner, until their waters meet on the ebb in the channels of the outer harbor. The two former, and the latter, are therefore to be considered apart from each other. There will be further occasion to speak of this when the improvement of Back cove comes up in order.
Inner Harbor.

Every harbor possesses some features in form and situation which give it a special character. Portland belongs to that class of harbors which is maintained by the scouring operation of the ebb tide flowing from basins situated within the proper harbor. Its special character is t!erived from the relative situations of the harbor and interior basins. The harbor itself is contained bet>;eeu the extremity of the peninsula on which the city of Portland stands, and the similar pen1~sula of Cape Elizabeth on the opposite side. It 18 a sheet of water 2,680 yards, or one and thirty-two hundredths (1.32) nautical miles, in length, and at the average high tide, eleven hundred yards in width.* At mean low water the average width is reduced to one hundred and nine yards. It runs in a direction northeast and ~uthwest, the entrance being at the northeast end. The southwest end is terminated by ortland bridge. Portland harbor may be otherwise иdescribed as a figure appro.aching, in form, to a parallelogram, of which the longest sides are 2,950 ya.rds, and the shortest sides eight hundred and ~wenty (820) yards, and at low water four hundred and forty (440) yards. The long sides are, oth of them, slightly inflected, following the natural sweep, which in this instance is very gradual.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Above Portland bridge the channel becomes narrower and shoaler, and less fitted for the purposes of navigation; consequently, Portland bridge appears to be the limit of the harbor. It is true, tliat if thi8 bridge had been built a littfo farther up, or a little lower down, the effect would have been the same. There are two circumstances, however, in addition to the position of the bridge itself, and the decrease of the channels above it, which give to the latter the character of a boundary. One of them is, that the best water in depth and extent is below the bridge; the other is, that the city of Portland 1iresents here almost its entire business front. Hereafter, then, that sheet of water which lies below Portland bridge will be spoken 9f as the harbor of Portland, and the space above as the receiving basin or reservoir: It will be convenient, both in the descriptions and in the plans to be presented, to adhere to these distinctions. One of the first observations that occur to the engineer, in respect to the territorial position of the harbor of Portland, is, to admire the sagacity, or good fortune, which directed the founders of that city in the cl10ice of its site. Their judgment in the matter. may have been controlled by other conditions, and e8:pecially by the character of the aborigines. But, whatever it may be owing to, the city of Portland now stands precisely upon that spot which a careful examination would pronounce to be the best. By contrasting its site with Plymouth, Wellfleet, and Sag Ha: bor, where the harbors are so rapidly deteriorating under the influence of natural causes that the hand of skill would hardly be extended to save them from destruction, one is led to a just estimation of an external position like that of Portlan,d, having an interior basin above it, and being washed by the successive ebbs and flows of the tide. The area at mean high water of the harbor proper, or of the space between Portland bridge and the breakwater on one side, and Fish Point on the other, is six hundred and seventy-seven (677) acres. The area of the basin above Portland bridge is, at mean high water, about nine hundred and eighty-eight (988) acres, and at mean low water about one hundred and eightytwo (182) acres. The relative proportions of the harbor surface and reservoir are as 2 to 3 at mean high water, and as 3 to 1 at mean low water. The relation of these two spaces to each other will be more exactly conveyed in terms of their capacity. The contents of the harbor at mean low water are about 9,250,000 cubic yards, and at mean high water 18,395,000 cubic yards. The same measures above the bridge are 4,087,000 cubic yards and 12,620,000 cubic yards. The ratios of the capacities of the two parts below and above Portland bridge are as 3 to 2 at high water, and as 9 to 4 at low water; differing somewhat from similar functions of the areas. There will be occasion to make use of these measures hereafter. The inner basin, called Fore river or Stroudwater, terminates at the tide-mill by a dam or bridge. The distance from this dam to Cape Elizabeth, following the course of the channel, is 4.27 nautical miles, and in this distance the waters make a general circuit of about ninety degrees, the most abrupt bend in the windings of the channel not exceeding eighty degrees, and the other bends being more easy. From this it appears that the windings by which the water enters the receiving basin are not great; and this is one of the best conditions of a reservoir. Again, there is no contraction of any importance in any part of the reservoir; the tidewave, therefore, if unimpeded by artificial constructions, will ascend freely: this is another one of the good conditions of a reservoir. Where this condition exists, a rate of current is established approaching uniformity; the velocities of the flood and ebb are more nearly equalized throughout the channels. Owing to the first condition, the course of the tidal currents is easy; they are subject to no violent deflections, and have therefore few eddies. This is another of the good conditions of a reservoir, for by this an ebb and flood of tide, regular in period as well as direction, are maintained; confluences and interferences are avoided near the times of change of tide ; and the greatest and least levels of high and low water may be attained if, as we said before, not prevented by artificial means. The riparian soil appears not to be liable ~o easy degradation, either under the action of the tidal current or of the waves of a storm; this is another good condition of the reservoir, and the Commissioners seem to have established this fact by the inspection of water taken from all parts of the harbor and basin during the four

OF TRE UNITED ST.ATES CO.AST SURVEY.

207

quarters of the flood and ebb tides. By this inspection it is satisfactorily ascertained tlrnt in a normal state of things the water in this in1nrndiatc vicinity has no appreciable arnonnt of matter at its disposal. The material of the bottom is genera1l.Y soft mud ; tliere is no 8and deposite even on the bar, and the Commissioners are not aware that such a deposite is to be found in any part of .the ground of which they are now speaking. The maximum velocity of ordinary tides iB not sufficient to overcome the adhesiveness and inertia of the surface over which it flows. During the spring-tides, and especially during the equinoctial tides, the maximum of nlocity is so much increased in strength and duration that the preceding remark would not probably be applicable; but it is the normal state of things only which is now under consideration. All the conditions of tlie harbor and reserYoir, the enumeration of which has just terminated, imply stability in the waters of Portland. Portland harbor is in fact a harbor of an original formation, and being well proportioned in its parts (for a harbor of that class,) it would be inferred that it wais not liable to any changes except such as are slow and scarcely l'erceptible. This theoretical view is sustained by an examination of tl1e earlier maps. The Commissioners have been furnished from the office of the Coast Survey of the United States with comparative maps, on which are laid down the shore-line and curves of Major Bache, Colonel Anderson, Moody, Des Barres, and of the Coast Survey of 1854. All these maps are al~o separately in the hands of the Commissioners. It results from a very minute and careful comparison of the different periods of time represented by these maps, that the Commissioners cannot discover any conclusive indications of an organic law of change. They have not been able to perceive that any one 1iart of the harbor is especially weak; that there is any dangerous tendency, arising from the 01)eration of the law of deposite or from the action of the tidal currents, to alteration or deterioration. It is to be remembered, in the comparison of maps of an old date, that the rule of reduction of soundings is never satisfactorily given. Unless, thereforo, very great changes have taken place, such as transcend the limits of the probable error of reduction, it is not easy always to arrive at any definite eon el usions. In those maps, however, in which the shore is bold and unchangeable, the examiner is furnished with a means of testing the accuracy of the survey by the outline of the shore, and thence he may form a judgment of the reliability of the whole map . . The opinion of the Commissioners, Б'OVerned by this test, is generally favorable to the maps m their possession, and this has led them to rely, without hesitation, upon the inference that the harbor of Portland is not, as has already been said, subject to organic changes. They are not, therefore, called upon by prospective considerations, to recommend new and important constructions. They will recommend, in its proper place, the extension and completion of the present breakwater. A few results of the comparisons of the several maps with each other may here be stated. They will exhibit the grounds of the Commissioners' opinion. The depth on the bar, in Colonel Anderson's map, is the same as at present; he shows eighteen feet on the Cape Elizabeth side, but the erection of the pier has produced changes which deprive Colonel Anderson's map of any value in this place. The shore-line from Cape Elizabeth or the north shore agrees pretty well with the Coast Su~ve~ map, which is the standard. There is greater depth at the bridge, but here another a.rtificial construction interferes with the comparison. The middle ground is reduced in size since Colonel Anderson's time and the channel between it and Fish Point, though the same as ~depth, differs in width and form; here, also, the original state has been artificially disturbed. he ~e~ths on the middle ground, notwithstanding its diminution in size, are unaltered. t' This 18 very striking, for if it is assumed (setting aside the ignorance of the datum of reducion) that the apparent changes have actually taken place, still here is an absence of uniformity or harmony of change. If the Commissioners turn to Major Baehe's map of 1820, to which they have given that care-

208

REPORT

OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

ful attention demanded hy the high reputation of it8 author, it is fonnd that there was apparently more water on the bar in 1820, by two feet, than at the present time. But if the reduction of the soundings of ::\lajor Bache to the zero point of the Coast Survey could be satisfactorily made, this difference would probably be diminished. On the chart of Major Bache the three-fathom curve is nearer the Cape Elizabeth side, by an average distance of one hundred yards, than now. The change in this respect near Portland bridge is remarkable, and wel~ woTth noticиing, By showing how much such structures may d:sturb the existing state of things, it will serve as a warning against multiplying them unnecessarily, and without sufficient precautions as to the mode and conditions of their erection. On the Portland side the same curves are nearly coincirlent ; on the middle ground the eighteenfeet curve nearly coincides with the pTesent. The twelve-feet curve is somewhat less than tlrnt which now exists. It is very noticeable, that a portion of the eastern end of the middle ground seems actually to have been removed, whilst, on the other hand, the depth of the water on the middle ground has sensibly diminished. The most interesting change is the creation of a sort of bar, reaching across from Fish Point to the middle ground, making it shoaler in this spot now than it was in J820. Further, the channel between the middle ground and the shore is now shorter than it was formerly, which implies an increase of depth in this particular place. In conclusion, although the Commissioners will not deny that there are indications from Major Bache's map of some slightly unfavorable changes during the last thirty years, yet they are disposed to ascribe the greater part of the apparent variations to those incessant fluctuations in the form of the curves which every student of the subject must have observed, and which, in many cases of projected improvement, are really much more perplexing than alarming. The actual existence of all these variations, even when admitted without due allowance for the now inappreciable errors of reduction, do not, in the opinion of the Commissioners, tend to establish any constant law under the action of which they can be supposed to take place. The fixeu and simple character of the harbor of Portland forbids their entertaining the idea that there can exist, unknown to them, any natural deterioratingи agencies, the effects of which are either to be dreaded now or guarded against in time to come. Those enduring processes of nature which produce secular changes in the earth's surface, are of course left out of consiueration; they are beyond the scope of the present inquiry.

PLANS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.

The Commissioners will preface this division of their report with some general views. When it is proposed to modify the existing state of a tid~l harbor of good natural capacity, _it is not to be forgotten that the modifications are to be held in strict subordination to certam general natural relations on which the harbor depends. Thus, for example, the area of the natural reservoir should not be diminished without a suitable compensation, unless circumstances require a corresponding diminution in the channel of the harbor; and, in the same manner, the diffusion or divergence of the waters in the reservoir should be carefully avoided. Again: if the limitation of the natural channels fonrts a part of the plan, the enginee.r m~st be careful that his operations are not carried so far as to produce inconvenience to nav1gat:on through an excess of velocity. Again: in modifying the existing state of a channel, attentio~ must be paid to the natural flow of the tidal stream, by which means a uniformity of motion 18 maintained in the different sections of the channel, and disturbed or violent states of the current are prevented. ' Again : the new boundary lines of the channel should be as regular as possible, coincidin_g with this natural flow ; in other words, a broken line of front would be condemned because it would occasion eddies, either by potritive ob~tructions or by unequal expansions and contractions. Again : the admisaion of the waters of the reservoir into the channels will be allowed to take

OF

209

place in a manner approaching, as nearly as possible, to that which nature has already prescribed in the case under consideration. Again: the e:fiect of contemplated alterations on the transmission of the tide-wa\'e \Yill be thoughtfully regarded. And finally, as all the plans have for their primary o~ject the convenience of commerce, the best and most durable interests of owners and proprietors immediately concerned in their execution will never be lost to sight. If it were attempted to form an idea of a tidal harbor in every way suited to the purposes of navigation, it would be described as one easy of access in all states of tide aml weather; aftording, at its first entrance, a partial degree of protection; possessing, in it~ interior, a common anchorage, both 11pacious and secure ; and having convenient docks into which ve8sels might haul, and lie with perfect safety while loading and discharging cargoes, or undergoing ins1}ection and refitment. The only quality wanting to the conception of such a harbor is, that it should possess in itself the means of its own preservation. Now, the preceding account of what would constitute a good tidal harbor has approximated very nearly to a description of the harbor of Portland; the only feature which, in the case of the latter, is specially defecti\re, is that of harbor accommodation. The plan of the Commissioners, then, will resolve itself into this: into furnishing the requirecl shipping accommodations, in such a form as will strictly comport with the rules already laid down ; and the recommer;,dations of the Commissioners will have for their object the llreservation of the self-maintaining power in obedience to the same principles. In the present case, where there is the prospect of a rapid and indefinite enlargement of business, no scheme, on the one hand, would be satisfactory, which was merely designed to meet present necessities; and, on the other hand, any plan involving great expense, and anticipating the growth of the city at some distant future period, would scarcely be less o~jcctionable. What is wanted is a project simple in its conception, and yet comprehensive, admitting of gradual execution according as parties apply for leave to extend their premises, and also of enlargement just in proportion to the growth of the city; a project which will disturb as little as possible the constructions now in use, and will be unlikely to create conflicting interests, or prevent the co-operative labors of individuals hereafter. Whilst it would be inexpedient, and probably useless, to attempt to sacrifice rights of available property to any of those magnificent designs which an ingenious theorist finds it easy to put upon paper, it is at the same time necessary that the Commissioners, profiting by the frequent examples in the republic, should contemplate a state of things of which the present business and population of Portland are but the healthful and vigorous germs. Private interests are to be cared for, but they are t.o be cared for in harmony with, aad in subordination to,' the general welfare. The present growth of the plant is to be fostered, and space i~ to be provided for its future expansion. Havmg all these principles and considerations before them, the Commissioners have prepared the accompanying plan, which they have now the honor to present to the city government. (Sketch No. 3.) It consists of a series of wharves or piers projecting at right-angles to the line of the shore on both sides of the harbor и between these IJiers, docks of sufficient width receive the shipping. The requisite depth in these docks will be kept up by the use of a suitable dredging-machine, in skilful hands and well conducted. The entrances to the docks may be closed or not, at the option of the proprietors, by outer gates, and thus the docks may be converted into wet basins. These gates will be constructed at the joint expense of neighboring proprietors, and, whereTer closed, they will present a uniform sea-wall, in which there will be no ~mpediments to the easy flow of the tidal waters. To complete the wet basins, the wharves, ;h.ich are to be enclosed, should be built solid. The walls or ends of piers, on lioth sides, when ~ish~ :iccording to this plan, form the new boundaries of the channel. The channel being us dinun.ished in breadth, the relative ratios of the reservoir and harbor space, in area and

capacity, will be altered. By the time this plan is fully executed, the condition of the reservoir will be unavoidu1ly changed by bridges and other constructions, which will keep pace with the city's progress, and lle the necessary concomitants, as well as instruments, of its prosperity alHl increase. If, however, the recommendations subsequently to be made are followed, the ratios of the reservoir to the harbor will be increased rather than diminished. From this may Le expectccl some increase, not probably important, in the depth of the harbor channel. But, wliat is more to the present purpose, the tidal stream will acquire greater velocity from th~s cause. Pains have been taken, therefore, after making the greatest possible estimate of the future ca1Jacity of the reservoir, not to narrow the channel so much as to produce a velocity inconvenient to the shipping; the augmentation will not probably exceed one-quarter of the inesent rate on the floo(l current, and still less tlrnn that on the e1i"L current. This applies to common neap ancl spring tides, but not to extraordinary states of the tide. The lines of wharf-front on this plan are drawn to harmonize with the natural flow of the tidal stream, and the form given to the passage from the reservoir to the harbor has been derived from a study of the natural curves of depths. It further appears, from a discussion of the current observations of the Coast Survey, that the larger llo<ly of water passes through the deeper and wider channel between the middle ground arnl the l1reakwater, though a consitlerable 1iortion passes through the channel between the middle ground and the Portland shore. 'l'he latter current meets the Back cove and Presumpи scot tides off Fish Point. The results, agreeing with the expectations formed from an inspection of the chart, show that, in the lower portion of the harbor and near its mouth, the motion of the waters is controlled by the sub-aqueous deposites. This authorizes the establishment of tlw new c1rnnnel limits independently of these currents, the form of the curves near the shore being taken as the safest guide in this part of the harbor. In general, however, the line from Portland bridge to the middle ground has been regarded a~ a single "reach," through which the direction of the tide is not essentially changed. All that the Commissioners contemplate in the fulfilment of this project js such a gradual construction of new wliarves or piers, and extension of old ones to the fixed line of front, as 1Hivate wants may dictate, and the city government approYe. However gradual this process may be . the works will form appropriate parts of a whole, ancl in the mean time no injury will accrue from the slowness of the execution. It does not, in an American at least, demand any great exercise of the imagination to foresee the time when both sides of the harbor of Portland will become the scenes of equally active business, and when the shores of its receiving basins an(l the islands of Casco bay, in which natme has furnished so many valuable harbors of refuge, will exhibit proofs of the wealth of the city by the increase of their settlement. But the commissioners would not be justified on this account in recommending that any effort should be made to carry out this plan at once, either wholly or even in any great part. On the contrary, it is their advice that its progress s110uld be just in proportion to the progress of the city, and that anything; like a spirit of speculation with regard to it should, as far as possible, be avoided. It is worth while to mention that, when the new water front has been permanently establishetl on both sides, the common anchorage of the inner harbor, between Cape Elizabeth and Portlancl bridge, will comprise an area of three hundred and fifty-two (352) acres, and the water area of the docks on both sides will altogether amount to about one hundred and fifteen (115} acres, assuming one-half of the enclosed space to be water space. The water area of the London docks is auout ono hundred and eighty (180) acres; that of the Liverpool docks is less than one hundred (100) acres. ThusJ it will be perceived that sufficient accommodations are provided for the greatest probable increase of tonnage. :Finally, the Commissioners have to say that, in the formation of this plan, they have encountered one difficulty, (they have no means of overcoming,) which consists in the distribution ~f he wharf and dock spaces within the proposed limits of construction. This distribution 1" somewhat arbitrary; still, a line of wharf drawn at random might abut upon the property ot two different proprietors. The Commissioners, therefore, have not filled up the enclosed spa.ell

with any wharves, except those already built. It is desirable that Rymmetry should be observ-ed
.a8 far as possible, and they will be happy, if the city government wish it, to complete the details,

when informed as to the limits of the riparian ownerships. There is no part of their subject to which the Commissioners have given greater attention, in proportion to its importance, than Back coYe and its improYcmcuts. It is very certain that no ?irnl Rcheme of construction ought to be allowed, at the present time, to interrupt the development of the harbor proper-the natural de11ot of tratle. It may he said, without hesitation, that a plan of improvement of the Back cove, projected in the present day, may prove, either because it is on a wrong scale, or because it combines too many o1)j0cts, or for similar reasons, unsuited to the future wants of the city. And it may also be said, that such a plan might come fo be regarded as premature on other accounts; as, for example, on account of the area of the wet basin, the depth and width of the channels, or the action of the 1wonr. A general view of ihc subject will be properly preceded by a brief description of Dack cove, and the clumnd leading to it. Back cove is a basin of '787 acres in extent. It is irregular in outline, lmt \)f nearly ~qual length and lireadth. Its surface is quite level, and is trace<l by the serpentine drains peculiar to horizontal basins ; a long and continuous guzzle stretches from Deering bridge into the diannel. It is nearly bare at mean low tide; at mean high tide it is covered to an average depth of seven and a half feet; at this stage of the tide it contains about 10,440,000 cubic yards Qf water. The basin slopes gradually eastward towards a deep and narrow channel : the depths on the two sides of the draw of Tukey's bridge, at mean low water, are twenty-three aud twenty-one and a half feet; at tlie draw of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railroad, the depth is seventeen feet at mean low water. This channel is situated at the southeast extremity of the basin, on leaving which it makes a turn of ninety degree!l. The scouring force acts unequally, owing to the channels narrowing suddenly; at the inner end it bas excavated to the depths of twenty-nine and thirty-one feet, but at the railroad draw the bottom rises to a little more tl1an one half that distance 11elow the level of mean low water. Dc11ths convenient for naYigation, however, are carried into the outer harbor. In the description of the outer har1ior, Ba,ck cove is mentioned as one of its independent reservoirs ; it is in fact the principal one. This is to be borne in mind. Now, if the Commissioners were absolutely required to furnish a plan of improvement of Dack COY-e, such as would render it useful for commerce, they would have to consider, first, the effect of that improvement on all the lower waters ; and secondly, the nature and extent of the improvement in itself. But in respect to this last consideration, the Commissioners confess that they would be at a loss to make U}) their minds. It would be difficult to determine, in the present state of things, whether it would be advisable to convert ninety-six acres (the area of the .Liverpool docks) into a wet basin, or more or less. While the harhor proper rernair>s unimproved, no great accommodation of this sort seems to be needed. Still the opportunity is a magnificent one, which should neither be squandered, nor in clue season neglected. Aml the Commissioners, in addrcssin,.,. the public body which has invited their opinions, and between 0 which au.d themselves there is a common object and a common interest, desire to lay stress upon the words due sea~on. To insure the success of a great project like this, it should be seasonable, not lagging behind, nor yet anticipating too much, the times. If boldness, energy, ~nd a speculative spirit, are requisite to the conception and execution of such an undertaking, JUd~ment and prudence are equally wanted to give it a right character and direction. In conclusion, the Commissioners are inclined to think that this is not the occasion to prepare a J>lan for the improvement of Back cove, and accordingly none is presented . . They are, however, unanimous and clear in one opinion, and that is, that the future occupation of Back cove should be guarded with jealous care, liecausc it is a valuable reservoir, arnl because it is a means of greater future usefulness. Any plans concerning it should Le subjectell to a rigorous scrutiny, and any numerical calculations applicable to the plans should be carefully tested and strictly interpreted. This is said in the way of warning. It is not doubted

212

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

that an opinion so well weighed, and so decided, will receive due consideration. It has been the intention of the Commissioners to make a study of the plan of improvement of tlrn Back cove furnished hy Col. Clapp, and to report upon it. They very greatly regret that a want of time has pr{"i'Cnted their rendering this service. What has been said is by no means intended to a pplr to Col. Clapp' s project. After pasf5illg Fish Point, in the way to be described, the CommisRioners see no objection to the occupation of any reasonable extent of the shoal grounds lying to the northward, and between that point and the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railroad bridge. The front face-'Of works here must follow, in general, the shore-line. The lines on the map of a section of Portland, traced by W. A. P. Marshall, civil engineer, November, 1854, and marked "proposed R.R. or street," are approve<l. Though there is no objection to puRhing out construction on the shoal above mentioned, as far as the railroad bridge, yet there would be great objection at present to carrying it any further out t1rnn the proposed lines, in the space between the railroad bridge and Tukey'R 1iri<lge, on the Portland side. This space and the space opposite, described in the mayor's letter of October 23, 1854, as "on the \V-estbrook s.ide, between the railroad and Tukey's bridge," bound the channel to the :Back cove. Any improvement in these spaces should be made dependent on the plan of improvement of Back cove. It has already been observed, that there is an unequal action of the scouring force in this vicinity; this inequality ought not to bP increased. A greater or lesA water-way will be wanted here according to the general plan. For this reason, it will be most expedient to leave things very much in their present condition. The wharves on the Westbrook side may be allowed to come out to a line marked a li on :Mars1iall's tracing, already referred to, which line crosses the extremity of the longest of the present wharves. This, then, is the wharf-line adopted by the Commissioners, subject to future change when the 11lan of improvement of Back cove is taken up, of which tlrn whole area contained between Tnkey's and the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railroad bridges must necessarily form an integral :part. From the development of their plans, the Commissioners will now proceed to their recommendations.
RECOMMENDATIONS.

The first. of their recommendations is, that the sea-wall be continued around Fish Point, in the way most beneficial to the proprietors. The line of this wall should be made to conform to the original shore, and at the extreme limit it should project with an easy turn, such as will conform to the curve produced by the alternate confluence and divergence of the tidal currents. The line upon the accompanying plan shows what is here meant. In all subordinate respects, the greatest benetit will arise from allowing the 1noprietors to consult their own wants and execute their own measures. The continuation of the line to Tukey's bridge has already been given under the head of plans. The second recommendation of the Commissioners, and the one to which they attach the highest importance, is directed to the means of maintaining the harbor, and of preserving, in all future time, its present capacity and usefulness. This recommendation is, that the city government should keep a most jealous watch over the waters of the reservoir, or receiving basin, above I'ortlancl bridge. Upon the conservation of this reservoir in a state of usefulness, equivalent to that which now exii;ts, depends the usefulness of the harbor. In this :field a. vigilant supervision and energetic control are absolutely imperative. It is perfectly unde.rstood that the harbor of Portland owes its existence to the scouring action of the waters of the reservoir on the returning ebb. The character of the harbor may be regarded as an expression or function of this power. If the power be diminished, the depth and capacity of the harbor will be diminished in t~e same proportion ; if the :power be increased, tlie harbor will be proportionately improved. This statement is simple and accurate. It comprises all that need be llaid. The harbor now exists;

OF THE UNITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY.

213

whether it shall continue to exist in its present state, whether it shall be improved, or whether it shall be suffered to deteriorate, are questions which will be solved hereafter by the action of those to whom this most important trust shall be confided. It is, then, to be duly considered in what manner this trust may be best fulfilled; and the Commissioners will be obliged to conclude that their labor has been vain if they fail to irn presil on the city g-ovcrnment the preservation of the water receptacle to its fullest capacity ; but not, however, in any actual or particular form. The question of the conservation of reservoirs demands special treatment. In the first place, in a city situated as Portland is, it is unavoidable that bridges and other means of transit should rise to meet the wants of an increasing population; and further, it is to be observed that instances will frequently occur in which, as tho city expands, tidal mud-lands may, and must, be occupied for a variety of purposes with great benefit. But, in all .~uch cases, the rule to be followed is to exact from the parties concerned a full compensation, for any space they may wish to occupy, by means of excavations elsewhere, made generally between high and low water mark. In this way land overflowed at high water may not only be harmlessly, but even beneficially improved ; for these excavations should he made in such a manner as to increase the average depth of the reservoir, or of its scouring property. Now, the scouring force has a known ratio to the mass of water and its motion. The velocity is as the square root of the depth, and t1rn mass is proportionate to the depth and velocity ; that is, the scouring force depends on the depth of water in the reservoir. These relations are such, that a reservoir of a hundred acres in area, having an average depth of twelve feet, is equal in scouring power to a reservoir of one hundred and eighty-three acres in area, having only an average depth of eight feet. With this statement in view, it will be perceived that the Commissioners are verr far from recommending that the growth and business of the city should be retarded or incommoded by the want of proper means of intercommunication between it and the neighboring country, or by the absence of other improvements. They only insist that, in all such cases, tl1e public interests be not sacrificed to private or corporate enterprises. \Vhenever, accordingly, any party or iiarties are authorized to raise constructions which will exclude the tidal waters from any portion of the receiving basin, let them be requirecl, as a condition of their grant, to make suitable compensation for the space thus occupied. Dy this means public and private interests will be harmoniously blended ; and while every reasonable latitnde will be allowed to s11eculative energies, the harbor (the common property of all, on the maintenance of which the ultimate success of these energies is dependent) will lose none of its usefulness. But, although no interruption is to be applied to this branch of the city's development, it mnst always be borne in mind that bridges, weirs, and other similar works, are actual obstructions to the passage oftbe tidal waters. They, to a certain extent, prevent the waters from obtaining their greatest and least level before the change of tide-or, in other words, the tide-wave may not, in consequence of them, be equally and fully propagated throughout the reservoir; consequently, the reservoir loses some of its characteristic value, and the high-water navigation is n.either so advantageous nor of so long duration. A judicious restraint, therefore, is to be exercised upon these constructions. It would be impossible, unless a special case were under advisem:nt, to go beyond this general caution; it may be well, however, to repeat it. Finally, all bridges across Stroudwater should be built on piles . . ~third recommendation which the Commissioners will make is, that there be a strict prohibJtwn against throwing ballast or dirt of any kind into the harbor . . A fourth recommendation which the Commissioners will venture to make is, that wherever trre~oncilable ''differences of opinion arise concerning matters of importance to the harbor, advisers be called in who are free from local and personal influences. Rival claims are easily magnifi<Jd by contending parties, and victory on either side may result injuriously to the general cause. The cases of Norwich and Yarmouth (British harbors) may be appropriately adduced as affording instructive lessons. The calm and enlightened view is, that all parties have a <lOtnmon interaat; the aim will be to discover wherein the interest lies.

214

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The fifth suggestion will be, that a method should be devised to prevent the washings by rains into the harbor. The sixth recommendation of the Commissioners is, that the necessity for using a dredging-machine may be fully and fairly acknowledged. On this subject a word or two may be added. It is worth while to remark, that there are very few good harbors in the commercial world the usefulness of which is not either insured or augmented by some artificial means. Good harbors are, like other natural gifts, to be improved. The very employment of a harbor involves, to some extent, an injury to its resources; and it is particularly true of tidal harbors, и,that their commercial distinction almost necessarily brings with it the creation of incidental causes of deterioration. It is on this account that the principle of compensation has been so strongly urged. The use of the dredging-machine is the application of this principle in a peculiar way. It is not the intention of the Commissioners to anticipate, by any meansJ the necessity for their employment ; but it should be clearly understood that, sooner or later, recourse must be had to them, and the instruments themselves should be regarded with favor. Seventhly, it is strongly recommended by the Commissioners that the care of the waters of the harbor and reservoir be immediately assigned to a suitable person. Perhaps, at present, this duty will be apparently insignificant; but if it be established now, and fully recognised, it will be much more easy hereafter to resist encroachments, to arrest the abuse of privileges, to keep the city government advised of the progress of improvements, and of the adherence of projectors to the plans which have received official approval. Let the office be known to exist, and much future trouble will be prevented. It would hardly seem expedient at present to create a new office for this purpose. 'l'he city engineer might, if the government think proper, be in trusted with this duty. In the eighth place, the Commissioners recommend the extension and completion of the breakwater in conformity with the original plan. In their opinion the entrance to the inner harbor would be improved by it, and the harbor itself would be better protected. A small light on the extremity of the breakwater will be very serviceable in turning into the harbor. The work in its present incomplete state does not accomplish all the purposes of its erection, The description of light, and its precise position, would come under the direction of the Lighthouse Board. Lastly, the Commissioners beg leave to express their adherence to the views and recommendaи tions contained in their first report.
MISCELLANEOUS.

The Commissioners will close their report with some miscellaneous observations. The attention of the city government is called to the fact that the draw of the Portland, Saco, and Portsmouth railroad bridge is so built, that vessels in passing through it are obliged to cross the direction of the stream. A similar mistake should on every account be guarded against in future. Wherever it is suffered to happen, alterations will follow, in consequence of it, in the bed of the river and in the course of the stream. Colonel Anderson's report contains an estimate for a sea-wall or breakwater on the middle ground. The Commissioners are not opposed to this project on any general grounds, if properly executed. A solid structure in that part of the harbor would undoubtedly be inconvenient to vessels, and spits would project from it, by natural formation, in the direction of the flood an~ ebb currents which would sensibly diminish the capacity of the harbor and its freedom of navigation. The miudle ground is in itself one of those very common features of tidal harbors and bays, the origin of which is so well undertood that its place might be dete:rmined by a knowlcd~e of the currents alone. Upon this base, supplied by nature, a superstructure may be erected if otherwise justified by the wants of the case and by economy. But the Commissioners have no information in their possession which induces them to believe that a. work of any kind is really

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

215

needed here. The problem is an intricate and special one, and is dependent on the extension of the breakwater. It must be treated separately, and the Commissioners will be 1wepared to investigate it whenever called upon by the city authorities. It was intended to transmit with this report a plan of a suitable wet basin ; but upon reflection it has not been thought necessary. The English engineers, c~pecially J\Ir. Fairbairn, may be consulted on this subject. The admirable plans and drawings of Mr. Fairbairn and others contain all the information and examples which a constructing engineer could possibly desire, aud wherever a wet basin is wanted they will, of course, be studied. The harbor of Portland is entirely landlocked, but as it lies in a northeast and southwest direction it is swept by northeast winds coming down Casco bay ; the distance of the islands in this direction from the mouth of the harbor being one mile. Some inconvenience results from this, especially in violent gales like that of the autumn of 1831. The force of the waves created by the southeast gales of the Atlantic is not wholly spent when they reach the harbor. It appears, also, that this harbor is sometimeR incommoded by ice, and occasionally is entirely frozen over, as happened not seldom in the years of the preceding century. But the Commissioners have reason to believe that this last obstruction is now of very rare occurrence. These slight inconveniences are counteracted not only by the security and goodness of the har1or itself, but by the nature of its approaches. A good holding-ground of stiff clay is found in many })laces in Casco bay inside of the islands; and the islands themselves create, as has been before observed, many natural haruurs of refuge. The mud in the harbor affords a safe bed for vessels to lie in when aground. The rank which Portland holds among the commercial cities of the United States cannot be satisfactorily assigned at this time on account of the rapid extension of its business, arising from the causes referred to in the early part of this report. No persons are Letter acquainted with the future prospects of the city, or with its statistics of trade and commerce, than those to whom this communication is addressed. The Commissioners allude to them here in order that they may have the pleasure of participating in the present well-founded hopes of prosperity. It sometimes happens that good harbors are wanting where other elements of colllmercia1 greatness are found in abundance, and, conversely, that good harbors exist where the materials of trade are absent. In this instance the facilities of nature, territorial position, and the legitimate courses of commerce, all combine to create a large commercial emporium. This promise of future greatness has given great interest to the labors of the Commissioners, who have never ~uffered themselves to forget that their opinions may, if adopted, exercise a permanent influence lU a sphere which is constantly extending in limits and importance.

Extracts from a pampldet by John .A. Poor, Esq., on the commercial importance

of Portland.

The harbor of Portland has been known, from the first discovery and settlement of North America by Europeans, as one of the best, if not the most commodious, safe, and accessible of any on the Atlantic coast. It was well described by Christopher Levett, who visited it in 1621; an~ ~t was sailed into by the great French navigator, Du Monts, as early as 1603. As the Principal seaport of all the region east of Massachruetts, during the period of colonial depend-

216

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

ence, and latterly, as the commercial capital of the State of Maine, it has been well known in the commercial history of the country. As a harbor of refuge, in case of storms or severe weather, it is probably more resorted to than any northern seaport of the United States. On the approach of an easterly gale, hundreds of vessels drop into it for shelter, as naturally as ships in the British channel seek the harbor of Portsmouth or Southampton, or those of the North sea make the port of Sunderland. Portland harbor is so easy of access at all conditions of the tide, and with any direction of wind, and withal is so capacious, deep, and well sheltered, that the largest ships may иenter and securely ride at all times and under all conditions of the weather. This will be quite apparent by reference to the charts of the United States Coast Survey. For reasons which are very readily understood, the city of Portland has not heretofore attained that commercial success to which her position seemed to entitle her. She has, however, grown rapidly into importance >Yithin the last few years, and is attracting attention as the terminus of the Grand Trunk railway of Canada, the European packet-station for the valley of the St. Lawrence and the vVest, and the route for the trade and travel between the Upper and Lower British provinces. Her commercial importance may be considered as first established when measures were entered upon to open a more direct line of communication by railway between the St. Lawrence, at Montreal, and the Atlantic ocean, at Portland, and to extend these lines so as to connect the several British provinces with each other and the United States across the breadth of the State of Maine. The railway system of Maine, as it may be called, including its provincial connections, embraces an aggregate length of more than two thousand miles, built or in process of construction. This system of railway has a gauge of five feet and a half, which gives it a character peculiar to itself, and one that makes it independent of the narrow gauge lines of New England and New York. The first practical effort to carry out this railway system was commenced in 1844. As soon as this movement was understood, and the commercial position of Portland made known through the public journals of the United States and Canada, an immediate enhancement of the value of the real estate of the city took place. This was followed by a corresponding increase of business. The extent of this will be readily perceived by the following table, showing the population and valuation of the city at different periods, as follows:

The rapid growth of the city from 1844 to 1854 was mainly attributable to the extension of its railways.
THE RAILWAY SYSTEM OF PORTLAND;

There are four distinct and independent lines extending or radiating from Portland. I. The southern line is the Portland, Saco, and Portsmouth railroad, extending as a trunk line from Portland to South Berwick junction, thirty-eight miles, where it branches into two lines ; one extending to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where it unites with the Eastern railroad, reaching to Salem and Boston, a distance of one hundred and seven miles from Portland; the

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

217

other extending to Dover, Haverhill, and Boston, a diHtancc of one hundred and eleven miles from Portland to Boston. This line wmi completed from Boston to Portland, br the way nf Portsmouth, November 23, 1842, and the connection between Boston and South Derwick junction, by tho way of Dover, New Hampshire, was made July 21, 1813. II. The western line is the York and Cumberland railroad, extending from Portland to Saco river, at Buxton, a distance of eighteen miles, to which }Jlace it was opened in February, 1853и It is in contem}>lation by the friends of this line to extend it westward, so as to comiect with the railways of New Hampshire and unite with the Boston and }faine railroad, in the neighborhood of Dover. III. Tlie northern line is the Portland and Montreal railroad, formerly called the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railroad, but now known as the Portland 1.;ection of the Gran cl Trunk rail way of Canada. This line is completed to Montreal, two hundred and ninety-two miles, with a branch to Quebec of one hundredиmiles. The plan for building this roacl was first entered upon in the fall of 1844. The terminus of the Grand Trunk railway at.Portland embraces, probably, the most extensive accommodations for the transaction of business to be found in the United States. 'rhe company owns a frontage of nearly two miles upon the deep water of Portland harbor, into which wharves are extended, so as to form a succession of docks of any required number or extent. 'l'ho passenger station of brick, just completed, four hundred and forty-four feet in length, by ninety-six in width, is arranged with a complete suit of offices, and is fitted up with every convenience and accommodation that could be devised for such a purpose. There is a freight depot, five hundred and fifty feet in length, part of it seventy-five, and the remainder ninety feet in width; another, four hundred and fifty by forty-two, connected with it by covered passage-ways, and several large warehouses upon the wharves, used in connection with lines of steamboats. IV. The eastern line is the Kennebec and Portland railroad. This line is on the narrow gauge, and connects with the Portland, Saco, and Portsmouth, and the York and Cumberland l'oads, in Portland, all on the same gauge. The line extends to Brunswick, with a branch to Bath, Gardiner, Hallowell, and Augusta, to which place it was opened November 1, 1852, a distance of seventy-two miles, including the Bath branch.

are springing up along its route. Large quantities of masts and ship-timber are also brought to tide-water by this railway. Portland now enjoys a very large trade with different parts of l\1aine, in supplying materials for building vessels, and in ship-stores. Estimating the cost of our new ships built in 1854 at $60 per ton, it shows a product in that year equal to $15,454,617. Next to lumber, ships are our greatest export in 11oint of value. The value of ships sold in the year ending June 30, 1854, may be set down at $5,500,000. The foreign commerce of Portland increased rapidly in 1854 over that of pre"1uus, years. We give below a table showing the foreign commerce from 1846 to 1854, with the exception of 1852 and 1853, the records of which were lost by the burning of the Portland custom-house last year:

The increase of the commerce of the city has probably been exceeded by the growth of manufactures in our midst. In addition to the introduction and increase of various branches of home industry, several large manufacturing establishments have grown up within the last few years. The future prosperity of Portland depends upon its ability to secure the bulk of trade between the United States and the British North American provinces. Its commanding position, aided by the powerful influence of the Grand Trunk railway, will secure this if her own citizens, especially her merchants, are equal to the occasion that is now offered them for the purpose. Bringing the aggregates into one view, the extent of the trade between the United States and British North America, according to the United States returns of commerce and navigation, is shown to be as follows : 1827...... ......................................................... $3,149,014 1849............................................................... 8,'758,986 1852............ ......... ........................ .... ..... ......... 16,519,305 1853 ............................................. ........... :...... 20,691,246 1854 ...........

A line of screw propellers is also established, running between Portlaml and New York. The Canadian Steam Navigation Company makes Portland its winter harbor for five months of the year. The land on which the city is built was formerly an island, and it is now connected with the main land by a narrow neck, formed entirely of marine deposite, and a few yards only in width, which alone prevents the sweep of the tides entirely around the city. On the margin of tidewater, a broad avenue of nearly two miles in length has been built in front of the town, and the extension of this street around the city on the same level will give an exterior wharf-line exceeding seven miles in length, at which vessels may discharge or receive cargoes. The carrying out of this plan of a commercial street, enclosing the peninsula, will increase, to an extraordinary degree, facilities for the transaction of business, add largely to the area of the city, and enhance the value of all its real estate. The commercial advantages claimed for Portland, on account of its harbor and its geographical position, may not, in the opinion of some, be justified by its past history. The explanation of this is found in the earJy history of this portion of the continent.

The English claimed all North America, by right of discovery and prior dominion, from foe taking possession of New FounJland, by John auJ Sebastian Cabot, in 1497, some months before the time when Columbus first came in sight of the main land of the continent of America. In 1531, Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence, as far as 2\lontreal: and received the title of Governor of Kew France, in 1540, the name by whicl1 Canada -was first known tt> Europeans. In 1603, the King of France granted to Du l\lonts, the great French navigator, all that portion of the continent between the 40th and 46th parallels of north latitude; and from 1603, the whole country east of Sagadahock (the Kennebec) was occupied as French territory, till the peace of Ryswick, in Hi97. King James of England granted all North America, between the 34th and 45th parallels of latitude, to the colonies of north and south Yirginia, in 1606, and in the year 1607 the earliest settlement of the English race in the New '\Vorld was made at tlie mouth of the Kennebec, prior to the settlement at Jamestown, in Virginia. This settlement was abandoned in 1608, the same year in which Champlain laid the foundation of Quebec. The settlement of New England by the Pilgrims, in 1620, prevented the French from extending their possessions west of Sagadahock ; which became the admitted boundary between Acadia and New England, "not as a line of peace and concord, but the place of future controversies.'' The rivalships of French leaders, and the contests of hostile races, in which Indian cruelties bore a conspicuous part, threw a distrust as to their safety, in seeking a home within the territory now held by us, over the minds of European emigrants, who sought the New vVorld ; which was increased by those extravagant accounts of the rigor of the climate framed by the early settlers at the mouth of the Kennebec, as an apology for their desertion, giving to all that portion of the continent east of Casco bay a reputation adverse to its growth, from which it slowly recovered. In 1603, Du :Monts entertained, from accounts obtained of the natives, the idea of a shorter route to Canada than through the St. Lawrence, and sailed south from his headquarters at Port Royal, to the Kennebec, for the purpose of :finding it; but failing to reach Canada through this route, he explored the coast, and took possession as far west as Cape Porpoise, in the name of the French monarch. Boston was subsequently claimed by French diplomatists, according to Bancroft, as a part of the territory of New France. While, therefore, the very simple and natural idea of opening a communication between the St. Lawrence and the Atlantic ocean, in the most direct line from Montreal to Europe, was suggested to the philosophical mind of Du Monts, in 1603, the conflict of races, of rival grants and different nationalities, delayed its execution just two centuries and a half. This great idea was first realized by the completion of the Portland and Montreal railway in 1853, two hundred and fifty years from the time of its first suggestion. The natural advantages which the harbor of Portland was seen to possess for becoming the seaport of Canada, led to the formation of the Grand Turk railway, and to the extensive preparations for business at its termin_us. The low charges for pilotage, wharfage, dockage and h~rbor dues, and the cheapness of insurance from this port, give it advantages for business with which no other Atlantic port can at this time compare.

Report to the b'uperintendent, by Assistant L. F. Pomиtales, of field operations and office-work e:recuted in the Tidal dfoision.

CoAsT

SURVEY OFFICE,

Octobmи I, 1855.

Srn: I beg to submit the annual report of the work done under your immediate direction by
the tidal party under my charge. It can be naturally divided into the two heads of field-work and office-work.
FIELD-WORIL

и

No essential changes have occurred in the general plan of tidal observations. The permanent stations at Boston, New York, Old Point Comfort, and Charleston, on the Atlantic coast, and San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, on the Pacific coast, have been kept up, and have generally afforded satisfactory results. The series at Charleston has, however, suffered a rather extensive interruption, caused by the removal of the observer from his station at Castle Pinckney, and the difficulty of obtaining another. A self-registering tide-gauge has been set up, and the supervision of the observations intrusted to Professor Lewis R. Gibbes. It is hoped that the arrangement will prove successful. On the western coast the observations have continued under the care of I1ieutenant W. P. Trowbridge, U. S. Engineers. His well trained and experienced corps of observers have continued to merit the praise which was bestowed upon them in last year's report. Of temporary stations several have been re-occupied in the southern part of the Atlantic coast, which had failed in last year's scheme. They were in trusted to the experienced care of Mr. Gustavus vViirdemann, who has probably done all that could be accomplished under the peculiarly difficult circumstances under which he was placed. The chain of stations occupied in the Gulf of Mexico has been completed, by the addition of a few stations on the coast of Florida. So far the discussion иof the observations would seem to show that they will prove sufficient. On the western coast several temporary stations have been occupied. The more difficult ones are now in progress under Lieutenant Trowbridge's personal supervision. Mr. Saxton's self-registering tide-gauges have continued to be used as much as practicable, and when in the hands of careful persons the results have been very satisfactory. The annexed table shows a list of the tidal observations received at this office during the year ending on this day. I have included in it the observations made in the waters of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in 1854, which were received too late to be included in the list for last year.

APPENDIX No. 33.
Repmиt of Sub-Assistant H. JJ.Iitcliell, on Tidal obsertJations made in Nantucket sound.
NANTUCKET, MASSACHUSETTS, October 6, 1855. DEAR Sm: The systems of observations on the interference tides of Section I, which have been undertaken by me under your immediate direction, during the past two seasons, commencing at the more general and striking features of this phenomenon, have gradually led us to the careful study of details. The operations of the former season, as proposed in your instructions, aimed at the determination of the localities in which these interferences take place, the liniits of the district of variable tides, the characteristic forms of the interference waves, and of general facts relative to the effect of tl1ese interferences upon the larger inequalities, half-monthly and diurnal. By a successful season's work the above results, among others, were obtained. It now remained to make a more minute survey of the phenomena, to trace not only the general history of the two tide-waves as they meet and combine, but to show the nature of this meeting as affecting the elementary diurnal and semi-diurnal waves. The observations had shown that the disturbance caused by these interferences in the tidewaves was not confined to the immediate vicinity of what are, strictly speaking, the meetingpoints, but that slight distortions in the form of the tide-waves take place at a considerable distance from these points. The precise extent of the region of these disturbances could not be ascertained witиhout additional data. The interference phenomenon, as observed in the former season, exhibits itself in three localities, viz: at the junction of the Nantucket and Vineyard sounds, in Muskeget channel, and in the open sea southeast of Nantucket island. During the latter season your instructions directed my operations to the examination of the first of these localities, and of such other points to the eastward and westward as should serve to compare our observations of the interference tides with those of other stations quite beyond the reach of disturbance. At Falmouth a series of observations, at intervals of fifteen minutes, was taken during a period of sixty days, and in connexion with these the tides of Block island and Menemsha bight to the westward, and Hyannis to the eastward, were simultaneously observed. The tidal currents have been studied as far as the instructions directed. The efforts of the sea to maintain its level, among the double disturbances caused by the presence of two tide-waves, which may perhaps be regarded as quite distinct in this relation, give rise to violent currents, by which large bodies of water are actually transported from place to place, and enter as an element into the observed rise and fall in certain localities. The difficulty arising in the discussion of the former observations from such causes, purely loca.l in their character, has led to the attempt to elucidate them by experiments made in ha.ya and small inlets, where, by reason of the small area of operation, the various movements of the water could be subjected to close scrutiny, hoping that the information thus obtained would enable us to recognise the same ca.uses in their more extensive 'relations and effects.

OF

.From these experiments we have obtained curious facts relative to the effect of the peculiar configuration of the coast upon the tide-wave, especially in the case of a wave passing from the sea into a .broad basin by a narrow inlet. The observers at all the tidal stations have been required to record the rise and fall of swells or "wind-waves" each hour of the clay, in connection with their meteorological notes. Having employed skilful and experienced assistants, I am able to present to you a connected series of work without the loss of a single day. I have been greatly indebted to l\lr. F. Buxton for his intelligent and steady industry, and I need not call your attention again to the longtried zeal of Mr. G. Wiirdemann. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL,

APPENDIX No. 34.
Report ~f Lieutenant TV. P. Trowbridge, U. S. Engineers, assistant in the Coast Suri~ey, relative to the Tidal and llfagnetic operations by the pcirty under his charge on the rvestern COa8t.
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, October 15, 1855. Sm: I have the honor to report the progress of the work of the tidal party under my charge, on this coast, since the date of my annual report of September 6, 1854. At that time there were five stations in operation, viz: San Diego, San Francisco, Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Astoria. The observations at Humboldt and Port Orford were com1)letecl about the 5th of October, making about two and a half lunations at each place. The observations at Humboldt were conducted by Mr. J. A. Black, and those at Port Orford by Mr. T. A. Szabo. Both of these observers have now left me; Mr. Black having returned to the States, and Mr. Szabo having received the appointment of assistant assayer in the United States branch mint at this place. The following stations have been added this year: Bodega, Farallon islands, Cape Flattery, :Noo.tka sound, (Vancouver's island,) Port Townshend, Steilacoom, and Shoal-water bay, the base stations having continued in operation till the present time. и The gauges at all of these places have been erecterl by myself, excepting that at N Jotka sound, and the results have been as satisfactory as I could wish. The observations at Bodega were commenced on December 2d, 1854, and completed on February 28th, 1855. These were conducted partly under my own supervision and partly by Mr. Szabo. The observations at the south Farallon were commenced on May 18th, and completed on October 10th, 1855; the curve traced by the register is unbroken for five months. The observations were by :Mr. N. N. Wines, now keeper of the light-house at that place. ,On the 7th of July I set out on board the Coast Survey steamer "Active" for Cape Flattery, with a party of two or three tidal observers and five or six hands. We reached the cape on the evening of the 12th, but owing to the darkness and fog were not . able to run into Nee-ah bay, and accordingly kept on up the straits. Captain Alden had taken on board a detachment of United States soldiers at Crescent City, whom he found in a destitute and suffering condition, and felt anxious to proceed directly to Steilacoom, and accordingly we ~nchored for the first time, after leaving Crescent City, in the harbor of Steilacoom on the even1~~ of t~e 13th. I immediately put up a tide-gauge at the wharf, and left an observer in charge 0 it, with directions to observe the high and low water for two months. As it was my intention
T

224

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

to make obf:ervations at Port T1)wnshend and at Cape Flattery) I thought it might be important to observe the progress of the tide up the sound. Observations for a few days were also macfe at Olympia, by which the difference between the tides at Steilacoom and Olympiaи can be determined. Captain Alden having finished surveying the harbors of Steilacoom and Olympia, sailed for Port Townshend, and, with the help of the crew of the "Active," I put up a pier, and set up a self-registering gauge with a detention of only two days. Mr. Bergan, formerly sergeapt-major of the 4th regiment of United States infantry, was left in charge of this gauge, which i>lиas kept running from August 1st until September 11th. Ilaving completed the erection of the gauge at Port Townshend, I was enabled, through the kindness of Captain Alden, .to land my party at Cape Flattery the next day after, (.Tuly 28th,) and had erected the gauge and commenced operations on the 4th of August. I have to acknowledge the kindness of the captain and officers of the United States sloop-ofwar "Decatur," for assistance in erecting a structure for the tide-gauge on the beach at Nee-ah bay. Captain Sterrett kindly gave me the assistance of a boat's crew, with boats, anchors, &c. Magnetic observations were commenced as soon as the tide-gauge was in good running order, and finished within about two weeks with good succei,;s. They consist of four sets of observations for absolute declination, with the portable dcclinator and detached theodolite, in connection with Polaris, five sets of vib.ration and deflection experiments for intensity, and three sets of observations for dip. Anxious to carry out your instructions with regard to the tidal observations at Nootka sound, I chartered a small schooner and sent Mr. C. J. W. Russell, who volunteered to do the service, to a point near what is called Nootka sound) with directions to make fourteen days' observations upon the coast tides. Mr. Russell had acted as interpreter for me at the cape, and felt confident that he would be able to get along amicably with the Nootka Indians, notwithstanding the very unfavorable reports which we had received from the Hudson's Bay Company concerning them. He set sail on the 26th of August, and commenced his obrnrvations near an island called Aho-Setle on the 28th. The observations were made outsiie the general coast line, under the lee of two or three small islands, so that they are strictly coast observations, and are not influenced by any harbor obstructions. The observations were completed on the 11th of September, the party having been daily threatened with destruction by about fifteen hundred savages, who had collected for the purpose of driving them away. On the 12th of September the ''Active" returned to Nee-ah bay on her voyage down the coast, and I broke up my camp, having made six weeks' good observations. On the 14th of September we e:u,.tered Shoal-water bay, and, while the officers were engaged in making a chart of the bay, I made two weeks' tidal observations within the bay. It was absoи lutely impossible to find any point outside at which a sta:tf could be erected, the whole coast in the vicinity being one extended sand-beach of two or three hundred yards in width, upon which the most fearful surf continually breaks. After leaving Shoal-water bay we sailed directly for this place. I have just despatched Mr. Rm1sell, in whom I have perfect confidence, to Cuyler'B harbor, on the island of San Miguel, near Point Conception, with directions to make six weeks' observations upon the tides, according to your wishes. The observations at the base stations, viz: San Diego, San Francisco, and .Astoria, have been kept up with the usual success until the present time. On my return from the north I find, however, that the observer at San Diego had been obliged to renew some parts of his structure which had been destroyed by the worms, and a similar cause has rendered it necessary to put a new float-box in the gauge at Fort Point; the sheet for the last month or two shows the effect of the swells in making a very broad curve. .By careful reading, however, the time and height can be obtained with all necessary accuracy, but the defect will soon be remedied.

I transmit herewith a general chart of the coast, showing the stations that have lieen occupied up to this time, with the dates of the beginning and ending of the observations. The station near Nootka is not marked with certainty, as the latitude and longitude were taken from a chart by the observer, Mr. Hussell, and is liable to an error of two or three minutes. A list of the stations which have been occupied during the year is also a1Jpended to this report. It gives me much pleasure to commend again the services of l\Iessrs. T. A. Szabo, James Wayne, Andrew Cassidy, and Sergeant H. E. Uhrlandt. :Illessrs. \Y ayne rtnrl Cassidy have been honorably discharged from the army during the year ; they still retain the places assigned to them two years since in charge of observations at Astoria awl San Diego. l\Ir. Szabo has recently received an.appointment in the United States mint, and although I was sorry to lose his services, yet I could not 01ipose his obtaining so advantageous a position. I would respectfully acknowledge the services of Sergeant Uhrlandt, who, in addition to his duties as tidal and meteorological observer at Fort Point, has tabulated most of the curves of all the stations, and assisted me in my office-work. The observations have now been extended from San Diego to Nootka sound, Vancon-verиs island, embracing nearly seventeen degrees of latitude and nine and a half of longitude; all except the two lower stations lying between the longitude 120░ 25 1 and 126░ 37'. Between these limits the geography of the coast presents somewhat remarkable features; and as these must, under any circumstances of the location of the tide-gauges, influence the observations, I have endeavored to gain as much knowledge upon this point as possible, from personal observation, during my voyages along the coast. The line of coast between San Diego and Point Conception presents the greatest irregularity of the general coast-line, embracing, as it does, about one and three quarter degrees of latitude, and nearly three and a quarter of longitude, while the coast bt-tween Point Conception and Nootka sound changes but six degrees in longitude for fifteen of latitude. By a glance at a. chart of the coast, this abrupt change in the direction of the coast at Point Conception strikes the attention at once; the chain of islands below Point Conception indicates a less depth of water along this part of the coast, or at least shows the existence of great unevenness in the ?ottom of the sea at no great depth. The observations at San Diego and San Pedro may be mfluenced by tl1ese causes. Above Point Conception, the only islands arc the Farallones, and these are mere rocks. The only obstruction to the motion of a great wave, therefore, between Point Conception and Nootka sound, would be the hanks which exist off Cape Orford and the Straits of Fuca, on which forty or fifty fathoms are found twenty or thirty miles from land. From San Diego to within twenty miles of San Pedro, the coast mountains come down to the sea, ancl form high cliffs along the whole distance. For twenty or thirty miles in the vici11ity of San Pedro, however, the shores are low, the sea entering the land and forming lagoons and salt marshes or low sand beaches. From a point a few miles above San Pedro to Point Conception, the shores are again high and unbroken by any marked depression. Northward from Puint Conception, the mountains sl~pe to the westward very gradually, and finally meet the sea so as to form perpendicular chffs from one to two hundred feet high. About thirty miles from San Luis Obispo, the shores again become low where the valley of San LuiR opens upon the sea. This valley has the shape of a crescent, which embraces the high laml called Point San Luis, and opens to the ;,ea above, at the "Estero rock," and below it widens out so as to form a low extent of beach or twenty miles to the south. From the Estero to Monterey, the sea washes the very base ~ange, rendering a passage by land along the coast almost impassable, and indicating a great fi?th of water close to the shores. The Bay of Monterey presents again a sloping beach for Steen or twenty miles, when the Salinas and Pajaro valleys debouch upon the sea. Between hanta Cruz and San Francisco again the sea approaches the base of the mountains, leaving, po~ever, generally, a narrow plateau along the coast. In the vicinity of San Francisco, from omt Bonita south ten or fifteen miles, the land is again low ; the low beach below Point

Lobos indicating a former delta of the Sacramento river. Low lands occur again near Bodega and Russian river, the coast range being somewhat broken from Point Ronita to the Russian river. Here again the high and impassable mountains commence and slope abruptly to the sea, forming another precipitous wall of rock, which extends above Cape JHendocino. Between this cape and the Columbia river there is an alternation of low and high land, there being no important rivers, and the only irregularities in the coast line being the reefs which generally extend for two or three miles from the main head-lands. The low lands on this portion of the coast are found near Crescent City, Rogues river, Cowes bay, and the Umpquah river. Off Crescent City an important feature is the bank w11ich seems to run out from the main land to a distance of thirty miles, the depth of the water being from forty to seventy fathoms. The sand-banks of the Columl1ia river are well known, and this portion of the coast presents some of the most remarkable beaches, I presume, in the world-the Clatsop beach on the south, and the Great vVeatl1er beach, as it is called, on the north of the entrance of the river. The vV eat her beach extends from Maekenzie' s head in a direct line northward for nearly fifty miles, the only break in the whole extent lieing the narrow entrance to Shoalwater bay. This magnificent beach is several Jrnndred yards wide at low water, perfectly even and hard, and the huge waves of the Pacific break in straight lines for many miles, presenting a most sublime appearance. The Che-ha-lis river, or Gray's harbor, is the northern limit. From Gray's harbor to Cape Flattery but little is known of the coast, excepting that no shoal or islands are found extending to any great distance from the land. The uniformity of the coast line is broken up at Cape Flattery, and beyond the straits of Juan de Fuca a chain of islands and bays extends far to the northward. The tidal stations which would appear to be least influenced by local causes are, I think, the following : San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Farallon islands, Bodega, Port Orford, Cape Flattery, and Nootka. This subject, however, requires more investigation than I have yet been able to bestow upon it. I would be glad to submit some observations upon the selection of local positions for the gauges, the construction of the gauges, and so forth; but my report is already too long, and these subjects will be reserved for a future time. I cannot close, however, without expressing to you how much I feel indebted to Captain Alden and the officers of the "Active" for the kindness and courtesy which they have extended to me during my summer's work. vVithout their assistance, I should have accomplished but little compared with what I was enabled to do. Captain Alden not only transported my party to and from those places which I wished to reach, but gave me every assistance in his power in erecting gauges, moving my baggage, &c.; and I feel greatly indebted, also, to all the officers for many personal favors and attentions. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

APPENDIX No. 35.
Letter of Litut. JV. P. Trowbridge, U. 8. Engineers, as<:istant in the Coast Survey, stating the

incidents attending the obsert'ation of tides at Nootka sound.
SA~ FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA,

October 11, 1855.

DEAR Sm: I have the honor to report to yon the safe arrival of my party at this place on the '7th instant, after an absence of three months. According to your instructions, I left San Francisco on the 7th of July, in the steamer "Active," for the 1mrpose of extending tl1e tidal observations of the coast above the Columbia river, as far northward as possible. It gives me great pleasure to report that my labors have been attended with quite as good success as I had dared to anticipate. The very unsatisfactory information that I had been able to gain with regard to the northern coast, and especially concerning the Indian tribes of Cape Flattery and Vancouver's island, had given me some apprehension that my observations might be interrupted, and I found afterwards that. my anxiety was not without good cause. The Indians at the cape conceived a foolish notion that I had come to bring back the small-pox, which raged fearfully among them shortly after Mr. Davidson's visit there, and for some time they seemed ready for an open collision. I succeeded, however, in keeping them quiet by explaining to them as well as possible the object ?f my visit, and showing them my disposition to resist any interference in my operations. 'l'he id~a of the return of the small-pox, however, had become extensively spread among the northern tnbes, and some of them found it a convenient excuse for a hostile feeling, which came near leading to serious results on several occasions. I informed you in a letter from Cape Flattery, that I had sent Mr. C. J. \V. Russell to Nootka s?und in a small schooner, with directions to make fourteen days' observations upon the coast tides. Mr. Russell returned to the cape on the 12th of Se1)tember, after having accomplished, to my perfect satisfaction, the duties in trusted to him; but I regret to say that the observations were made under the most perilous circumstances ; nothing, indeed, but the firmness of Mr. Russell, saved the whole party from destruction by the savages. They were obliged to anchor the schooner near the shore within bow-shot of the beach, and observe the staff from the deck of the vessel by day, and b; means of a boat by night. For a few days they were unmolested, but after the news of their arrival had become known, the Indians flocked from all quarters to see them. The ideiL bad been injuriouslv circulated by some of our enemies near Cape Flattery, t~at the object of Mr. Russell's visit wa~ to cast some evil spell upon the land and waters, and ~-ey _demanded that he should leave immediately, telling him plainly that they would attack: ini if he did not; he told them however, that he could not leave until he had finished his observat'ions. '!'hey then endeavored ' by allи manner of stratagem to get possession of the vessel, an; even attempted to sell poisoned provisions. t 'or several days and nights the crew were unable to take any rest, and Mr. R. was obliged 0 take the night observations with a la.mp in one hand and a pistol in the other. On the 11th

228

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

of September, having finished the observations, the party set sail for Cape Flattery, leaving the Indians still gathered, with canoes continually bringing reinforcements. The observations at Nootka were commenced on the 28th of August, and continued uninterrupted until September 11th-fourteen days. I transmit by the mail of the 20th, the curve constructed from the observations, and also a sketch of the locality taken from an English chart. The obserYations at Cape Flattery were commenced on the 4th of August, and continued until the 12th of September-six weeks-without interruption; ihe gauge was placed ~t Nee-ah bay, under the lee of Waddah island, as it was found impracticable to establish it at the extreme cape. The observations at Port Townshend were conducted by Mr. Bergan, and were uninterrupted from August 1st until September 11th, excepting during a heavy blow from the southeast, which commenced on the night of 1st September, and continued until the evening of the 4th. The curves traced by the gauges at Cape Flattery and Port Townshend embrace four sheets, all of which are transmitted to the office. I have not yet heard from the observer left at Steilacoom, but presume he will soon reach this place ; his instructions were to make observations until the middle of September, and then return by a sailing vessel to San Francisco. On foe 12th of September the u Active" arrived at Nee-ah bay, on her way down the coast, and I struck my camp and left the straits. In addition to the observations enumerated, I may mention three days' observations at Olym11ia, two weeks' harbor tides at Shoalwater bay, and one day coast tides at Crescent City. I also made magnetic observations for declination, intensity and dip, at Nee-ah bay, upon which a separate report will be made; the magnetic observations occupied rue two weeks. In all the tidal observations I have personally superintended the erection of the gauges, whether self-registering or otherwise, excepting at Nootka sound, and the observations at Kee-ah bay were made under my immediate supervision. It will thus be seen that two new coast stations have been added, extending the observations as far north as Nootka sound, while, simultaneous with these, observations have been made at Port Townshend and Steilacoom. I :find also on mv return that the observations at the Farallon islands have been uninterrupted to the present ti~e; the last sheet came off yesterday; and from this place three sheets are now ready for transmission. I propose to send Mr. Russell to the island of San Miguel, near Point Conception, in a few days, as I cannot trust to getting a station at the Point. Mr. R. will leave on Thursday. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. P. TROWBRIDGE,

CoAST SURVEY OFFICE,

October 1, 1855.

The annual report of the occupation of the computers during the year ending November l,

1855, and an appendix containing the detailed statements, is herewith respectfully submitted. The charge of the computing division has been continued with Assilltant J. E. Hilga.rd, and during his absence with myself. I wa.s in charge of the division during ten months, while :Mr.

229

Hilgard was engaged on field or other duty, and was relieved on the 1st of August, when I took the field for six weeks, under special instructions from the Superintendent. After September 24th I resumed the duties of chief of the division. No change was made in the general organization of tbe division, which, from the past year and previous experience, has proved efficient in every respect. The distribution of the astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic reductions among the several computers, has remained as stated in last year's report, with such changes as were found expedient under the circumstances. Mr. J.E. Blankenship has been added to the number of computers, l\Ir. D. A. Burr has resigned, and l\fr. McL. Tilton has been transferred to one of the field parties. The application of the computers to their respective duties has proved as productive as could be desired, and the results have been brought out with a view to approach as near as possible to the form in which they will be needed for 1mblication; in this respect the division and the work of publication will mutually be benefited. The lffoject of work for the last year was adhered to as closely as was found advantageous, and in reference to bringing up reductions of former years a considerable progress has been made, leaving but little of the work of former years to be recomputed. A statement in detail on the occupation of the several computers during tbe year ending November 1, 1855, is herewith appended. Mr. Cliarle8 A. Schott was in charge of the computing division for ten months, during which time a number of reports to the Superintendent, or assistant in charge of the office, have been submitted, out of which the following may be specially noticed: On probable errors derived from observations of horizontal angles at a given station by the method of least squares ; on side equations ; on the adjustment of horizontal angles of a triangulation, by application of the method of least squares; on the reduction of the Savannah river triangulation ; on the chronometric difference of longitude ; and on the latitude of stations in Sections VI, VII, and VIII, determinecl by Assistant F. H. Gerdes ; a scheme of reduction of the primary triangulation in Section I; on the latitude of Agamenticus, resulting from three different instruments; on the reduction of the latitude stations, observed with the Military Academy zenith telescope ; a discussion on the residual discrepancies in the primary triangulation of Section I, with special reference to lateral refraction; on the Cape :Fear river triangulation of Assistant O. P. Bolles ; on the resulting longitude by moon culminations of the Rio Grande station; a discussion on the residual discrepancies in the primary triangulation of Section II, with a comparison of the thirty-inch and two-feet theodolites ; and on the reduction of the Winyah bay triangulation. During May and June I was principally occupied with the collection and discussion of the results for magnetic declinations on the Atlantic and Gulf coast. In conformity with instructions from the Superintendent I was on field duty during August and part of September, since which time I have been engaged in arranging and disc~ssing my magnetic observations. The magnetic observatory under my charge was in Dperati_on from the latter part of November till the latter part of July, when the operations were discontinued, for the purpose of making a new arrangement in the instruments and method. The charge of the division was resumed by me October 1st. lYfr. Eugene Nulty completed the second reduction of the azimuth observed by Assistant Bolles at Wilmington, North Carolina, 1852-' 53, and reduced the latitudes of six preliminary stations de~ermined by Assistant Gerdes in Sections VI, VII, and VIII, 1853-'54. He disc11esed the latitudes of the De Rosset station Section IV occupied by Assistant Dean in 1854, of Ragged :M t. stat10n, . ' the Superintendent's ' Section I, occupied by party in 1854, by G. W. Dean and Mr. Barris. Mr. Nulty reduced the latitude of station Sebattis, Section I, determined by zenith telescopes No. 1 and No. 2 in 1853, and reduced the latitude of east base, Section IX, 1853, and the latitude and azimuth of Jupiter station, in the same section, and by the same observer, G. W. Dean. The reductions of the latitudes of Columbia, South Carolina, occupied by Dr. Gould and Assistant Dean in 1854, and of Macon, Georgia, occupied by Assistant Dean in 1855,

230

were also completed. The reduction of the second computation of the transit ancl longitude of Rand key will probably be completed. Assistant Theodore TV. TVerner has reduced Lieutenant Seward's triangulation in Section YI, near Card's sound, in 1854, and made the second reduction of the Cape Fear river triangulation of Assistant Bolles, of 1852 and '53. He also reduced Lieutenant Totten's triangulation of \Vinyah bay, South Carolina, in 1853. Mr. Werner computed Assistant Gerdes' triangulation of the Cedar keys, of 1851 and '52 ; computed rectangular co-ordinates of positions d~termined by Captain Palmer on the Rappahannock river, in Section III, 1854; reduced Assistant Gilbert's triangulation in Section VIII, of 1853 ; made a least square abstract of horizontal angles of Ragged Mount, occupied by the Superintendent in 1854; computed Assistant Farley's triangulation, connecting the James and Appomattox rivers, in Section III, and nearly completed the reduction of Assistant Cutts' primary triangalation south of San Francisco, Section X, of 1855. Mr. Werner has besides made, under Assistant Blunt, computn,tions for the New York harbor survey now in progress, and will probably complete Assistant Gilbert's triangulation of 1855, in Section IX. Mr. James JJiain reduced the chronometric differences of longitude of ten stations, in Sections VI, VII, and VIII, occupied by Assistant Gerdes' party in 1852, '53, and '54 ; revised the prime vertical latitude computations of Agamenticus, and the eight latitude stations occupied with the zenith telescope belonging to the Military Academy. He also revised the computations of eight stations occupied with zenith telescope No. 1, and assisted Mr. Hilgard in preparing the form of publication of the zenith sector latitude observations and reductions. The latitudes of east base, Section IX, and of Unkonoonuc, Section I, have also been fully revised. Mr. }fain was detached from the division for field duty, assisting Mr. Schott on his magnetic trip, and has reduced the observations for time, azimuth, and declination, for sixteen magnetic stations, since he joined the office on 10th of September. He will probably complete the reduction of the intensities at the same stations. JJ11". G. Rumpf has been in charge of the geographical registers, which includes the revising and correcting of the first and second computations, and prepared the statistics of the astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic records of the survey for the year 1853. Up to the month of July, Mr. Rumpf directed the computations made by Mr. Toomer, and was assisted by him in the revision, second computation, and adjustment of the upper Cht:sapeake Bay river triangulation in Section III, a revision of great extent. He also computed the positions near the mouth of Cape Fear river, determined by Assistant Bolles in 1851; compared the two reductions of Rappahannock river, Section III; assisted in the reduction of Casco bay triangulation, horizontal and vertical angles observed by Assistant Boutelle in 1854, and will complete the statistics of the survey, relating to this division, for the year 1854. Mr. Rumpf, besides, made some miscellaneous computations. Mr. J. WiesBner assisted Mr. Schott in making out an abstract of probable errors of obscn'ation of horizontal angles of the primary triangulation in Sections II, III, and IV, and performed some miscellaneous calculations. He assisted Messrs. Hilgard and Schott on the computations for the discussion of the magnetic declinations ; deduced the length of the San Pedro base, Section X; prepared information for the General Land Office, relative to the Florida keys; reduced the azimuth of Wilmington, Section IV, observed by Assistant Bolles; and deduced the length of the second base on the Rappahannock. Mr. Wiessner made a second computation of the zenith telescope latitude of Marriot, of 1846, and the first reduction of the horizontal angles at Ragged Mount, Section I; and reduced, by the method of least squares, the transits at Hum-. boldt station, Section X, 1854. The laborious reduction of the Casco bay triangulation ot Assist'.lnt Boutelle, in Section I, was completed; and the reduction of the chronometric difference of longitude between East Pascagoula, Deer island, and Hurricane island, Sections VII and VIII, determined by Assistant Gerdes' party in 1854 and '55, has made considerable progress.

3fr. J. H. Toomer assisted Mr. Rumpf in the revision and second computation of the Chesapeake Bay and river triangulations, made out abstracts of probable errors of ]1orizontal angles, and has performed miscellaneous computations. l\Ir. 'l'oomer attended daily for more than two months the magnetic observatory, completed the reduction of Assistant Gilbert's triangulation in Section VIII, of 1803, ancl made progress with the last obsenations taken in that section, and the computation of the geodetic latitude, longitude, and azimuth of the Rappahannock river, Section III; which work he will probably complete hy the :first of November. He also assisted on the reduction of the Casco bay triangulation. Jlfr. Jolin T. Hoover performed the usual clerical duties of the division, and principally attended to the magnetic observatory, made some computations relative to tlie zenith sect.:ir ]atitudes, and some triangle and other miscellaneous geodetic computations. Some copying of mathematical })apers was done by Mr. Hoover. 1llr ..David A. Burr computed right ascensions of stars under Mr. l\fain's Llirection, and assisted Mr. Schott on the comparisons of the star places in the Twehe Year and Rumker's Bamburg catalogues. He assisted occasionally as copyist, and also at the magnetic observatory, and resigned about the 1st of April. .~fr. McLane Tilton assisted in copying for the division, and also for field parties, and in February was temporarily transferred to the tidal division, and afterwards detached from this division. Jlr. James E. Blankenship joined the division as a computer on tlie 22d of June, and assisted :Mr. Schott on the discussion of the secular cliange of the magnetic declinations, and afterwards assisted Mr. Rilgar<l <ill the computations relating to the discussion of the magnetic declinations. Duplicating and miscellaneous copying has been done by R. Freeman; and miscellaneous computations by A. S. Clements, under Assistant Hilganl's immediate direction.

llEPORT OF QF]j'JCE OCCUPATION IN THE TIDAL DIVISION, LS CHARGE OF ASSISTANT L. F. POl'RTALES. COAST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1855. The observations of tides, and the discussion of their results, being under the immeJiate direction of the Superintendent, a report on them has been transmitted to him directly. The general organization of this division has remained the same as heretofore . . In addition to the discussions of tidal observations, &c., made under the Superintendent's immediate direction, the computers of this division have continued to keep up the rethction of the obRervations as they come from the field, so as to make the results readily available whenevr~ wanted, and, in the case of permanent stations, to enable us to detect more readily inaccuracies and defects, and to remedy them. Numerous tide-talJles have been preparCll from the results of the reductions, and furnished on demand to the engraving divisiuu, to he entered on the maps in the course of publication. The following is an abstract of the occupation of the different computers during the year: JJfr. H. Heaton has continued the discussion of the tidmi in the Gulf of Mexico. He has also been engaged in computations preliminary to the determination of the co-tidal lines in that ~ulf and on the western coast, and in discussing the daily inequality on the latter. This work 11118 done under the immediate direction of the Superintendent. During my absence, in the months of July, August, and September, Mr. Heaton was in c1 iarge of this di vision. Mr. R. S. .Avery has revised the predictions of tides made by the other computers ; has comPf8red them with observation; has prepared tables of corrections to be applied t-0 them. He has ~ ~ continued the discussion of the Boston observations. Of his abilities and assiduity I have a occasion to speak too often to make a repetition here necessary.

232

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Mr. J. Kincheloe has been engaged in preparing tables of predictions of tides, but has chiefly been occupied with the discussion of the Boston tides. Ile has continued to show assiduity and ability in the discharge of his duties. JJir. P. R.

REPORT OF MR. GEORGE MATHIOT, IN CHARGE OF TIIE ELECTROTYPE DIVISION,

The work of extending and combining the engraved plates has been quite large, and consumed a very considerable amount of time, which I had hoped to devote to experimenting on the actino-engraving process. This has led me to devise a more expeditious method of making these combinations, than the difficult and tedious mechanical process heretofore employed. By the advantages of this new method I hope in future to be able to economise sufficient time f~r prosecuting my actinic experiments. A detailed description of the new method of combining 18 :presented. (Appendix No. 62.) Apparatus has been constructed for recovering the mercury from the residual zinc and sweepings of the batteries. This apparatus was finished but quite recently, but near three hundred pounds of quicksilver have been already obtained by it.

OF THE UNITED STATES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

245

Some time has been devoted to the actino-engraving ; chiefly in reviewing what was done the previous year. But few experiments have been made; yet I am now satisfied that success will be obtained by a diligent course of study and experiment.

REPORT OF MR. V. E. KING ON THE DISTRIBUTION .AND S.ALE OF MAPS.

At the date of my last report, (November 6, 1854,) fifty-six sheets of Coast Survey maps had been published. Since then the chart of "Key West harbor and approaches" has been added, which will make the number now published fifty-seven. The following-named charts, although reported as being nearly :finished at date of last report, were actually completed during the year, viz: "Newburyport harbor," "Salem harbor," "Long Island: sound," (in three sheets,) "Charleston harbor," and .Alden's reconnaissance No. 2 ofthe western coast. Important additions and corrections having been made to the following preliminary charts, new editions have been published, vizи: Nantucket shoals; Alden's reconnaissance No. 1 of the western coast; entrance to Columbia river.

.APPENDIX No. 37.
Letter of the Siperintendent to the Secretary of tlie Treasury in relation to tlte necessity for an increased force of topograqhical engravers for the Coast Survey office.
ME., September 14, 1855. Srn: I would respectfully ask permission to advise with the department in regard to the progress of the engraving of the Coast Survey results. No subject connected with the immediate practical results of the work has employed more of my thought, attention, and observation than this one. The difficulties connected with it have, in most cases, been solved, but there still remain important ones to contend against. By dividing the maps and charts into two classes-one preliminary, to be published immediately on the execution of the work; another of a :finished character, to be engraved in the highest style of the art-a leading and most prominent difficulty is obviated, for it is possible to find numerous persons capable of all but the higher kinds of engraving. The public is satisfied to balance promptness of publication against inferiority of work, provided the highest standard of excellence, such as is consonant with the whole design of the survey and its elaboи rate methods in the field, is kept up in the finished maps and charts. The issue of these finished maps and charts must, however, keep pace with the execution of the field work, though at a certain distance behind it. On taking charge of the Coast Survey in 1844, I found large arrears of unpublished work, and became soon satisfied that the number of engravers in the office must be much increased, and contract work out of the office must be resorted to in order to keep pace with the current work and to bring up the back work. The idea just stated was approved by the department as a cardinal one in the management of the survey. The engraving establishments in the principal cities were visited by me and by Captain ,A. A. Humphreys, then assistant in charge of the office, and to whose devotion and knowledge the Coast Survey owes so much, to ascertain what good engravers eould be procured to work at

the office, and what contracts could be made. At the same time apprentices were introduced, with the design of ma~ing engravers in our own establishment. It would detain you too long to state the degree of success of these experiments, and the causes which rendered all the attempts to increase our corps of engravers, and to have maps engraved out of the office, less successful than could have been desired. It is proper, however, to say that at different times renewed efforts were made, and that I was zealously assisted in this in turn by Major Stevens and Captain Benham, assistants in charge of the office. The JJlans were modified by close observation of their working. Engravers were invitecl to work upon our maps at their own homes, and other efforts were made to induce the best artists of the country to work for us. Meantime the scale of the work of the survey was extended to the whole coast of the United States, and the additional field work demanded new facilities for its publication. The preliminary maps and charts,и and sketches, issued at once on the completion of the surveys, were much multiplied in number, and there was danger that the style and finish of the higher grades of maps might actually deteriorate instead of improving. The application of electrotyping, by which the finest maps could be perpetuated and multiplied at no greater expense than was incident to the copying of the coarser charts, has removed the great objection to this elaborate work on the score of expense. The fact became, from year to year, more apparent that the talent of the country was so profitably employed in other branches of engraving, that map engraving was comparatively neglected, and that there could not be found in the United States, upon any terms, enough first-class engravers to execute the required number of plates of first-class maps. The engravers introduced by Mr. Hassler and myself into the office had, during this time, not only acquired the greatest skill of which they were ca11able in their art, but had in several cases passed the age at which their physical vigor rendered them most capable of work. One of the first-class engravers, brought from abroad by Mr. Hassler, had, with the consent of the office, left the work. Several attempts were made to obtain the supply of first-class engravers, which was so indispensable to the progress of the engraving, and which could not be had in the United States, from abroad. These were made through our ministers and consular agents, through officers of the survey who were in Europe on private business, and through personal friends of my own, with some of whom I had formed intimate relations while abroad, and some of whom had been officers of the Coast Survey. All these attempts, from various causes em;ily traced, failed ; and the exigency not only still exists, but it increases every month with the progress of the coast survey. To sum up, we are falling irretrievably behind in our publication of first-class maps ar,d charts, for want of additional first-class engravers, and this demand cannot be supplied in the United States . . The plain duty of seeking it abroad where it is known to exist, has been executed time after fame, as far as it can be by correspondence, and that method has failed. Seeing, then, that we must have more first-class engravers to supply the necessary Coast Surv~y maps, and that they cannot be had in the United States, nor abroad by correspondence, it is my duty .respectfully to propose to the department to try the only resource left, namely, to invest me with authority to send one of the officers of the Coast Survey, and for this I would at present prefer the assistant in charge of the office, Capt. Benham, of the corps of engineers, to such places abroad as, from my knowledge of the condition of engraving there, would seem to prom~se to afford the indispensable supply of first-class engravers, say four in number, on terms similar to those formerly approved by the department to be submitted anew to its approval) and Under i nst ructions и from me to be also approved by ' the department.

APPENDIX No. 38.
Remarks of Oapt. H. W. Benham, U. S . .Engineers, assistant in cliarge of the Coast Survey Offece, in his annual report to the Superintendent, showing the necessity for obtaining additional engravers. CoAST SuRYEY OFFICE, October 15, 1855. DEAR Sm: * * * * * * * * * The indispensable necessity there exists for obtaining additional engravers for the execution of our finer charts, which have now been delayed for years in the office, when in all other respects they are fully prepared to lay before the country; and this necessity, I regret to say, no efforts of myself or of my preclecessors have been able to meet from any resources that have been open to us, and which, without other efforts or other means available, will leave the most important of the magnificent results of this survey as a mass of inaccessible waste paper in this office, or require that it should be thrown off to the country in a. crude, imperfect, and half intelligible manner, corresponding in no degree with t!:ie opeiиations of the other part of the work, or with the reasonable expectations of the country, from the liberal appropriations granted in previous years by the confiJence of Congress, for the prosecution of this work. These very appropriations, I am compelled to say, while adding most extensively to the progress of the work in all other respects, have but increased in a multiplied degree the difficulties and embarrassments on this subject; the increased sums available enabling you to extend proportionably the field operations, and the office to prepare and reduce, ready for the engraver, the maps of the survey, as skilful surveyors or draughtsmen are obtainable to any extent desired in our country, while the means of throwing the results of these surveys before the country in a form corresponding to their excellence in other respects, in a reasonable time before they shall be out of date, has as yet been unattainable ; no other duty or work in this country haviug heretofore made necessary the artistic skill here required, needing, as it does, an experience of years, with much native taste, to represent with clearness and accuracy the manifold details usefol on our maps, ou the small scales required for their general utility, and for economy of distribution; and the efforts which have been made in this office, at considerable labor and expense, within the past four or five years, to instruct young men residing in this vicinity in thiB art, some fourteen of whom have been on trial in the office for the purpose, have not been thus far successful to the extent of.our constantly increasing wants, either by the want of native taste needed for the highest skill, or, as in other cases, by the inducements offering for the more stirring and active operations of life, better suited to the genius and temperament of our people, and in other more recent cases where the necessary abilities and industry appear to he combined by the length of time still needed for the attainment <lf the skill deemed requisite for the execution of our best charts. In this dilemma, with the urgent necessity, it cannot be gainsaid that the great results of this survey, so important to our commerce and to the world, should be brought forward for publication to the country at the earliest day possible after these results are obtained. The amt\Unt of work now on hand of first-cla!ls charts already reduced and now in tke drawing division, prepared for the engravers, as by e. report and estimate which I have had carefully

APPENDIX No. 39.

DeBcription of the Congress map, by Lieut. J. C. Tidball, U. S. A., assist.ant in the Coast Survey.
A proviso in an act passed at the second session of the thirty-second Congress directed that the annual report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey shall, when presented, "be accompanied by a general chart of the whole coasts of the United States, on as large a scale as convenient and practicable, showing, as near as practicable, the configuration of the coasts, and 1Jhowing, by lines, the probable limits of the Gulf Stream, and showing, by lines, the probable limits to which the soundings off the coast will extend, and showing, by the use of colors and explanations, the exact portions of our coasts, of which complete charts have been published by the Coast Survey; also, showing such other parts of the coasts of which the triangulation, the topography, and soundings have been completed, but not published; and, also, such parts of the coasts of which the triangulation and topography, or triangulation only, have been completed." In compliance with this provision, a chart was drawn, in the Coast Survey office, in the winter 0~ 1853, and accompanied the Superintendent's report of that year. It has since, from time to fame, received additions as the work of the survey progressed. This chart is known as the Oongres8 rnzap, and is made upon a single sheet about nine feet square, which, for preservation and convenience, is backed with linen cloth and attached to a roller. The scale used is nrirhnnn or _about .04 of an inch to a statute mile, and the meridian lines and para1Iels of latitude are constructed by this scale for each minute. The projection used is the Polyconic-a. method fully explained in Appendix No. 39, report of Superintendent Coast Survey for 1853. The centr<il meridian for the eastern coast is 84░ W. from Greenwich; the wes_'.ern coast being projected separately, bas its central meridian 120░ W. from Greenwich. U ~pon this frame-work of projections is traced, in an unbroken line, the entire coast of the . nrted States from f>assa.ma.quoddy bay (the northeastern limit of Maine,) following the indentations of the shore along the .Atlantic around the peninsula of Florida to the mouth of ::iBio Grand~, the coast o_f the Gulf of Mexico; and from Fr~ze.r's river, ne~r the northwesterly P .t of Washmgton Terntory, to San Diego, the southern hm1t of the United States upon the acific ocean. The northern shore of Cuba and the coasts of Nova Scotia, island of Cape Breton, an~ a large part of Newfoundland, are likewise laid down, as also the boundaries of the States an the northern lakel!!.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The general direction and limits of the Gulf Stream are marked out in their proper positions, and the temperature is indicated by shaded bands, increasing in width to the north and east, which are darker in proportion to its greater warmth at different localities, as determined by a system of explorations extending from Cape Florida to Cape Cod, and by a series of temperature soundings across the axis of the stream from the following points: Cape Cod, .l\fontauk Point, Sandy Hook, Cape Henlopen, Cape Hatteras, Cape Fear, Charleston, St. Simon's, St. Augustine, and Cape Canaveral. These lines of soundings are represented upon the map, and show the extent to which the survey has already explored this wonderful and important phenomenon. Diagrams for each of these lines are shown upon the map, in which the curves of different temperatures at the same depths, and of the same temperature at different depths, are constructed, and also sections representing the form of the bottom of the ocean, which is therein shown to be diversified by mountains and valleys, similar to the earth's surface above water. Explanations of these diagrams and explorations, and the developments that have been made for the benefit of navigation and science, are given in the several recent annual reports of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. Lines of soundings for temperature and deep-sea bottom specimens, made upon different parts of the coasts, are laid down. From observations that have been made, the Isgonic lines, or lines of equal magnetic declination, have been determined, and are given upon the map. The progress of the various descriptions of work of the 1mrvey is shown upon the map by different colors and other conventional signs, which present at a glance the operations in the two grand divisions of the labor-namely, the field and office work ; the former of which comprises the topographical and hydrographic reconnaissances, the magnetic and astronomical observations, the primary and secondary triangulations, the topography and hydrography; and the latttir, the drawing of topography in progress, drawing of hydrography in progress, engraving of topography in progress, engraving of hydrography in progress, published topography, and published hydrography. The meaning of the colors and signs is explained in the legend upon the map. The lines and stations where the magnetic telegraph has been used for astronomical observations are marked out, showing the extent to which this great modern invention has been employed for scientific purposes in the ascertaining of longitudes upon the coast survey. The map, therefore, as its title indicates, exhibits at one general view the configuration of the coast of the United States, and the limits of the Gulf Stream, the probable limit.s of soundings, and, by colors, the charts published or in progress ; and the extent to which the reconnaissances, triangulation, topography, and hydrography, respectiv-ely, are completed or in progress, to November 1, 1855, as compiled from the archives of the Coast Survey and other authorities; and is susceptible of additions and alterations, to show the advancement of all these different portions of the work in the successive years. Sub-sketches, upon a scale of TOo<f 0000 , show the approximate co-tidal lines of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for each half hour. A list of base-lines, with their locality and division into primary and local, is given. A table is laid down upon the map, giving, in a condensed form, the statistics of the Coast Survey at p(lriods from 1844 to 1855, showing the total of the work that has been accomplished during that time . .A list of Coast Survey charts published, giving the locality, class, scale, and date of publication, is also to be found upon the map. The conventional signs for topographical drawings, used, more or less, upon all the Coast Survey charts, are delineated and explained upon the same sheet ; as alRo scales of shade used in topographical drawings, to represent the different declivities of ground, by which accurate graphic representations of portions of the country borи dering upon the coast have been obt.ained in such manner that their respective elevations an.d declivities may be judged by inspection only.

nation, current charts showing the manner of representing by curves the direction and velocity of tidal currents in different harbors and sounds, and tidal diagrams showing the manner of registering the rise and fall of tides by means of curves, are easily understood by inspection. A tide-table added gives the rise, fall, and mean duration, &c., of tides at the principal harbors upon the coast. Numerous specimens of the manner of recording hydrographic observations are given upon the map, and also forms of records and computations of the principal astronomical, magnetic, and geodetic determinations in use by the Coast Survey.

APPENDIX No. 40. Solution of Normal Equations by indirect elimination.
By Chas. A. Schott, Computing Division.

The application of the method of least squares in geodetic operations has become so frequent and indispensable, and in consequence of this, the number of linear equations (normal equations) to be solved has so much increased, that any method of solution of more ready application than that ordinarily used must be considered as valuable, both as time-saving and as contributing to a more extensive application of the method of compensating by minimum stiuares, especially when we consider that frequently the limit of application of the method is prescribed by the practicability or expediency of solving a great number of equations. It was thought that the method of solution by indirect elimination, not confined to normal equations alone, might prove acceptable to those not having convenient access to the notices on this subject. The method has been tried and successfully used in the computing division. As stated in my paper on the adjustment of horizontal angles of a triangulation, Superintendent's Annual Report of 1854, Appendix No. 33 S, page *75, the direct method of the solution of normal equations, known as Gauss' process of elimination, has formerly been exclusively made use of, especially in the reduction required for the primary triangulations in Sections I, II, and III, and by it a dozen equations, with as many unknown quantities, may be solved without inconvenience. The ordinary method of elimination requires the formation of n (n 1) (2 n 4) numenca . 1 co-e ffi cients . c . b y virtue . . 1 d. .buLOr n equat10ns of t h e symmetrica 18tn 1 .2.3 1 ) (n 5 ), ti on of the co-efficients. This number is reduced in Gauss' direct process to n ( n 1.2.3 and shows the diminution of labor, as well as the rapidly-increasing ratio of the number of co-efficients with the number of equations. A full account of this method will be found in Encke's Berlin Astronomische Jahrbuch for 1835, pp. 26'7, 272; and in the same publication for 1836, p. 265. In the shorter method of indirect elimination communicated by Gauss to Gerling, (see ap11endix to Gerling's work on the application of the calculus of compensation to practical geometry, 1843, p. 386,) we have been furnished with the means of solving the numerous normal equations which the present state of geodesy demands, and their numbers are frequently counted ~y the dozen. The method is by no means restricted to normal equations, to which, however, it. a~plies best. However, in an instance where 86 unknown quantities were successfully ehmmated, extraordinary means, such as cannot be commanded at all times, have been resorted to. Although the method does not apply with equal facility to all normal equations, yet, in most cases, it will be found time-saving, even for a small number of equations. 'l'he method of indirect elimination premises that the corrections to an assumed value of ap~r?xima.tion for the quantities sought are very small, or approximates to zero. By this supposi:ion, the propriety of finding an approximate value for one of the unknown quantities, by puttmg the sum of the remaining terms equal zero, becomes apparent. Substituting the value

B.EPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

so found in the given equations, and thereby changing absolute terms, the liability to error, in our next attempt to find an approximate value for the second unknown quantity, is less. This process will, in turn, furnish approximations for all the unknown quantities, and has to be continued until all absolute terms vanish in the successive substitutions, or until we have carried our approximations to a sufficient degree of accuracy, or to a sufficient number of places of decimals. The closer we follow the rule, to begin always with that quantity which, after consideration, promises the greatest value, the more rapid we will obtain the solution. In normal equations where each unknown quantity necessarily occurs once, with a prepoiiderating co-efficient, there can never arise any doubt as to which equation is to be used for finding the greatef't unknown quantity. The following arrangement will be found convenient. Given the normal equations:

However, only certain normal equations present this advantage, and if we prefer to add a new equation, formed by the sum of the otherR with the signs changed, the same check may be had for any set of eq nations. 6.000K 1 4.319 K 2 -0.763 K 3 0= 6.167 2.663 K 3 77.629 K2 4.319 K 4.20: Normal equations ............. -и-иииииии .. ии 0 _ 1 3.005 K 3 2.663 K 2 0--7.34o - 0. 763 K 1 Auxiliary check equation................. 0 = - 3.024 - ll.55fi K, -84.611 K 2 - 4.905 K:

K 3 = + 2. 365 i A serious difficulty, however, may arise from the circumstance that one of the coefficients of the .quantity to be determined is of insufficient magnitude in comparison with the other co~ efficients in the same normal equation, iP Jnsequence of which the convergence of the successive result~ may become exceedingly small, so that, for instance, the correction applied to the unknown quantity KP counteracts all corrections previously obtained for other quantities Kq and Kr. The fo~Io~in~ method was used by Gerling to overcome this difficulty: during the progress of the elnmnatwn we soon recognise those K's which thus prevent any closer approximation, and they rnay ~considered as forming a group which must be treated by itself.

This process may have to be repeated. A different method will be shown in one of the following examples. In number 523 of the Astronomische Nachrichten, Jacobi has given a metqod of solution of linear equations very similar to that of Garn:1s ; but in the occurrence of other large coefficients, besides the diagonal coefficient, the process becomes lengthy and is not here inserted. A paper by Argelander in number 491 of the same publication, treats on a particular case of this kind. According to Ger ling, Gauss was (in 1843) in possession of other artifices, and the former expresses his desire of seeing them published. 'fhe following examples of indirect elimination are given, r.s solved by Mr. J. \Viessner, of the computing division, principally after methods by Euler and Bezout. Example of the solution of linear equations with preponqerating diagonal coefficients: Retain from the coefficients of the unknown quantities the highest place, and putting the numerical terms equal to the algebraic quantities ab c ..... , establish simple approximate equations, expressing the unknown quantities x y z и.. in terms as simple as possible. For an application of the method I have selected the same equations as above, viz : O= 6.167 6.000 x 4.319 y-0.763 z 0= 4.202 4.319 x 77.629 y + 2.663 z O= - 7.345- 0.763 x + 2.663 Y+ 3.005 z Hence the approximate equations0=a+6 x 4 y - !z 0 b 4x 78 y 2t z O= c...!.!x+ 2ty+3 z And the rough approximations-a -b -c x=2 6 =-1и,y=--irs= - 0.05, z=-s=

By means of the above equations these approximations becomex = - 0. 7 y=-0.09

i::=+2.
The substitution of these values into the original equations changes the absolute terms ab c into+ 0.052, - 0.482, and - 1.041, and we obtain for the next approximation the rough values - 0.009 for x 1 , + 0.006 for y1 , and+ 0.3 for z1 и These rough values are again corrected as before, and the whole process may be brought into the following form:

In the above example the process is about the same as in the preceding solutions, though much shortened, and it will be seen that by means of such approximate equations a solution may frequently be obtained with surprising rapidity. The adjustment of the horizontal angles (directions) at Station Ossipee, in Section I, produced the following six normal equations: O=+l0.9950+53.2143.A..- 7.5523B- 7.8024C-10.2190D- 8.5190E- 9.8357F 0=+12.5032- 7.5i2;).A..+38.9976B- 5.60240- 6.7690D- 6.3524E- 6.8857F 0=-13.6740- 7.8024A- 5.6024B+52.1976C-20.8190D- 5.1190E- 6.3024F O= - 20.1658 -10.2H!O A 6. 7690 B - 20.8190 C + 64.3310 D - 8. 7190 E - 9.0524 F 0=-36.2916- 8.5190 A- 6.3524B - 5.1190 C- 8.7190 D + 44.7810 E - 8.4357 F 0=+19.5516- 9.8357.A..- 6.8857B- 6.30240- 9.0524-D- 8.4357E+49.4643F These and similar equations, originating from the closing of the horizon at any station, can always be brought into the form0

etc.

In the first of the above equations we have the mean coefficient, omitting the diagonal coefficient, equal 9 ; hence by adding 9 A 9B 9C 9D 9E 9 F - 9S O, we find approximately-

Any number of these equations may be solved with facility and without the use of logarithrns, but when side equationa enter into the normal equations, some of the coefficients may become comparatively large.

APPENDIX No. 41.
Letteiи to the Superintendent from Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, wlth description of the apparatus devised/or the mea8urement of preliminary bases at Savannah, Georgia, and Georgetown, South Carolina. (See Sketch No. 53.)
CAMBRIDGE, MASS., September 22, 1855. Srn: I forward herewith a tracing of the apparatus contrived by me for supporting the four-metre wooden measuring bars used in measuring the preliminary bases at Savannah and Georgetown. It appears to me to possess the following advantages for the purpose required, viz : 1. It is cheap-its entire cost being about sixty dollars. 2. It is light, and may be transported by a few men. . 3. It may be used upon rough and uneven ground without digging, the measuring bars being at a low and nearly uniform grade. One end of a box may be as low as the knees, while the other end is as high as the top of the head. 4. It is perfectly firm and steady when in position. 5. It is simple in its construction, and may be made from the drawing by any intell~gent carpenter and blacksmith, with a. little supervision on the pa:rt of the person who ilil to use it.

OF 'l'HE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.AST SURVEY.

'the apparatus consists of four stands or "boxes," the top of each of which (d, figs. 1 and 6Sketch No. 53) is made of white pine twenty-six feet long, six inches wide, and one inch thick, supported and stiffened by two vertical flanches of white pine (e, figs. 1 and 6) of the same length and thickness, but tapering from six inches wide in the centre to four inches at each end. Each box is supported by two Gambey stands, as shown in fig. 1, where two boxes are represented in line. The stands are made like those belonging to Gambey theodolites; (k, fig. 2,) is the plan of the top of one of them. In the centre is a hole (n) an inch and a half in diameter. The legs (h, fig. 3) are of oak or ash, each four feet long, and one and a quarter inches square before splitting through the centre. At the bottom of each leg is an iron ferrule and point. They are secured to the top of the stand by iron bolts, with thumb-screws (fig. 4) passing through the holes (o, fig. 2) in the top of the stand. The boxes are connected with the stands by two pins, (c, figs. 1 and 6,) each moving, in the direction of the box, upon a pin (b, fig. 6) held by two gudgeons or journals (a, figs. 1, 5, and 6) screwed to the under side of the top of the box (d.) The pins (c) are each eighteen inches long, and one and a half inches in diameter, fitting into the hole (n) in the top of each stand,(!:.) The wood-screw (m) was intended to press against the pin (c) in any part of its length, as the box wasиelevated above the stand in crossing hollows. But it does not work well in practice, as the wood swells and shrinks with the atmospheric changes, and I propose to substitute a metallic clamp like that represented in figure 10. Figure 6 is a cross-section of one of the boxes, through the centre of the pin (c); (d) is the top of the box, (e) the flanch, (a) the gudgeons in which rests the bolt (b) upon which the pin (c) turns. A front view of one of the gudgeons is shown in figure 5. The boxes are intended for supporting two wooden bars, each four metres long ; each box is '7.93 metres long, or about three inches less than eight metres or two bars. There is thus a space of about six inches between each box, when in position, so that it may be aligned and levelled without disturbing the adjustment of the box behind it. The wooden bars used by me at Savannah were each four metres long and an inch and a half square, with brass sockets tapering nearly to a point at each end, where are inserted short steel wires of a quarter-inch diameter, one end forming a disk and the other a knife-edge. Figure 8 represents the ends of these bars in contact. At Georgetown I used two iron wires a quarter-inch in diameter. At each end a flat piece of platinum was inlaid, and a line cut across it. The distance betwec:n these lines was nearly four metres at 32░ Fahrenheit, and they formed the termini of the measure. To render these wires convenient for use, I enclosed them in grooves cut in inflexible wooden bars made of white pine, each one and a half inches square, and long enough to allow each end of the wire tu project about an inch. The wires were held in the grooves by small metallic staples, driven in such a manner as to keep the wire steady, while it allowed free expansion and contraction during changes of temperature. They are shown in position on figure 1, box No. 1, A and B. The ends of the two wires are also shown in figure 9, which is a view of the top surface of the wires, e~closed in the wooden bars, as they appear in use, with the terminal lines in contact at (p). 'E1ther kind of measuring bar may be used upon the boxes in the following manner: The boxes are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. In commencing the measure they are aligned in that order, the re~r end of box No. i being placed about six inches ahead of the point selected at the initial point of the baae. In aligning the boxes it is best to have two legs of each stand parallel, and the other on a line perpendicular to the line of the base. An approximate alignment only is n.ec~ssaTy, care being ta.ken that the true line falls somewhere on the top of the box, which is ~inches wide, a.nd also tha.t ~he ends of two contiguous boxes a.re in the same plane. AttenttQn is_a.~ requisite~ the profile of the ground ahead, so as to commence rising to overcome an elevatien, stttlici~n-tly far back to make the angles of inclination as small as possible. The fonr boxes being aligned in the order of their numbers, measuring-bar No. 1 is placed upon bo%. No. 1, the end plumbed over the terminus of the base, and the ba.r aligned with pre34

c1s1on. (The alignment may be carried on by having several signals carefully placed in line along the base l1y a transit instrument, and tl1ese may be kept in one by the eye.) The bar is then clamped firmly to the box by the clamp (/, fig. 7) which I liave not before described. It is of half-inch square iron, and is four inches on a side. A thumb-screw (g) passes through the upper side, and ends in a swivel-plate. The lower side is passed through a hole in the box, made to receive it, (see fig. 1,) and the swivel-plate is pressed firmly down upon the measuringbar by meitns of the screw (g.) Measuring-bar No. 2 is now placed upon the forward end ofbo:s: No. 1 aligned, and the ends brought in contact, when this, too, is clamped to the box. Thc temperature and angle of inclination of the bars to the horizon are now observed and recorded, and these bars are "counted," that is, they are considered as measured and recorded in the note book. I have found the following form of record convenient, viz:

There is here a duplicate check upon errors in counting. The column of whole numbers runs on from one to the end of the measure, but the boxes end with every eight bars measured. The whole number standing opposite box No. 4, bar No. 2, must therefore always be a factor of eight. The record being complete, bar No. 1 is unclamped, carried forward and placed upon box No. 2, where it is aligned, contact is made, and it is then clamped. As the ends of the bars are now on different boxes, the necessity for having the ends of the boxes in the same plane is evident, since otherwise one end of the bar would be either above or below the other. J3ar No. 2 is then unclamped, brought forward, aligned, contact made, and clamped. Temperature and inclination are again observed and recorded, box No. 1 is carried forward and aligned, ready for bar No. 9, and the measure continued in the same manner to the end of the day's work, where stubs are driven and marked with dots upon copper tacks, from which to resnme the measure on the next day. I have usually left the boxes in a line at night, taking off and securing the measuring-bars. In plumbing down from the ends of the bars to mark points, I have used a sector, or theodolite, as we do with the large apparatus. My instrument for measuring the angles of inclination was a cicular finder taken from one of our large astronomical transit instruments. It reads to minutes, and was secured by tacks to 3 piece of two-inch plank, about two feet long and six inches high, the circle being so adjusted that the lower edge of the plank wa"s para1lel to the level, with the verniers at zero. This was placed successively upon each measuring-bar when in position. The angles of inclination were then read off and recorded. In using this apparatus at Georgetown, I was aided by Major Prince and Mr. Huger, with six men. Major Prince, with all the men, aligned and adjusted the boxes and observed the an~Ies of inclination, while :Mr. Huger and myself followed with the meaauring-bara~ We were aollle-

times able to measure, over ordinary ground, at the rate of one bar per minute, and frequently made forty-five per hour. The apparatus might be used to more advantage if the metallic clamp, shown in figure 10, were adapted to it. It would also improve it much if the gudgeons (a) and the pin (b, figs. 5 and 6) were of metal instead of wood. We have also experienced difficulty in keeping the surface (d) of the boxes in a uniform plane, where exposed to the action of the sun and moiSture. This may be remedied by inserting pieces of wood about six inches square, and half an inch thick, into the under side of the top of each box, with the grain of the wood running across the top of the box. The ends of the box will also be better preserved from sagging by making the vertical flanches six inches deep throughout their length, instead of tapering to four inches at each end, as in the drawing.

APPENDIX No. 42.
Report on the Method of determining Longituder; by Occultations of the PleiadcB.

fly

PROFESSOR EENJ'll.MIN PEIRCE,

LL.D.J

OF HARVARD.

1. The determination of longitudes by occultations of the stars appears to be the most accurate of all astronomical methods for such determinations, and deserves, therefore, a very careful examination, in order to ascertain the greatest degree of accuracy of which it is susceptible, and the surest method of securing such accuracy. The sources of error are partly those of observation, and partly of theory. The errors arising from observation are of two classes: first, there are those which are special to the observations of the occultations: and secondly, there are those which are general, and which, from their nature, cannot be discriminated from the t1ieoretical defects. 2. The probable error of the direct observation of an occultation has been investigated by Commander C H. Davis from simultaneous observations, made by different observers at the same place. From his researches, it appears that this probable error is about a fifth of a secornl of time, so that the ultimate probable error of the mean of this class of observations cannot exceed a twentieth of a second of time. If, therefore, the theon~tical defects can be eliminated by proper precautions and a sufficient accumulation of observations, longitudes may be of:>tained b_y this method of which the probable err.or shall be decidedly inferior to a tenth of a seGond of fame. 3. It is obvious that with the present. uncertainty of the lunar theory, isolated occultations cannot approach this degree of accuracy in the determination of longitudes ; but well-determined groups of stars are essential to correct the lunar elements and rectify the places of the stars themselves. The present plan is to carry out the investigations of Walker, 1m1>lished in the R~port of 1851, by combining all the known observations of occultations of the Pleiades and usmg them for correcting the lunar semi-diameter, the mutual positions and changes of position Dfи the stars of this group ' for testinrr and correctinO' the fotmulru of lunar Jlarallax, for deterи 0 0 mining the irregularities of the moon's limb, and,и:finally, for correcting the longitudes of the places of observation . . 4 и ?Бthe various forms of computation which might be auopted, I have selected that which 18 deri;ed. from the stereographic projection of the spl1ere, in which the star ALCYONE is the pole of ~qy~ction. The advantage of the stereographic projection consists in the circularity of the P;oJections of all the spherical circles so that the moon is represented by a circle on the plane 0 1irojeetion. The advantage of pla;ing the pole of ptojection at the star ALCYONE is, that the

268

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT

distances and relative positions of the projected places of the stars are only affected by the differences of their proper motions and the small differential effects of aberration. There may be a doubt whether the somewhat greater simplicity of the formulm in the case in which the pole of projection coincides with that of the celestial equator, should not cause this form of projction to be preferred, and it may be advisable, in order to insure accuracy, to conduct the computations independently by each method. 5. As the basis of computation, the places of the stars have been taken from BESSEL'.s investigations, which are contained in the fourth volume of his "AsTRONOMISCHE DNTERSUCHU:NGEN," in the article entitled "Beobachtungen verschiedener Sterne der Plejaden." The places of the moon are taken from the Nautical Almanac, and the moon's parallax and semi-diameter from the "Tables of the Moon's Parallax constructed from Walker's and .A.dams' Pormiilae" for the use of the

'' .American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac.'' 6. The following are the formulro for the computation of the stereographic projections: Let

и the declination of Alcyone. a 1 = the right ascension of another star or of the moon's centre. fl1 = the declination of the second star or of the moon's centre.

The axes of x and y have their origin at Alcyone ; the axis of y is directed to the north, and that of x to the east. The co-ordinates of the star are given by the formulre, sin2 i A a cos fl cos [31 , A = 1 - sin2 ! A p 11 B sin 1 =sin A a cos fi1 , C sin 111 sin A p 2 sin 2 l A a sin (:i cos f11, B

In computing x.., and'!!... by the formulre ofД 6, the apparent right ascension and declinaion of .Alcyone must be taken for the time from the Nautical Almanac . . The values of x, and Y. must be corrected for proper motion, and also for the change in the direction of the axis of :x, arising from precession and aberration. The formulre for the oomputation of tliese changes are given in the following paper, with their investigations by Dr. Peters.

Relative to the term 0''.115 sin [336'-' 59' (t :I: i J8Y.61) 19░ 20'.5] it is to be remarked, that the year 1840, from which tis reckoned, is about in the middle of that part of the draconistic month when occultations of the Pleiades possibly can takeи place. And as this part does not extend over much more than four years, t ▒ i 18Y.61 will always be between the limits :▒:2 years, consequently the angle under the B'ine between 298░ 18' and 374░ 40'; that is to say, the term depending on the ( 's node cannot exceed 011 .101, and will be in most of the cases nearer to 0.00 as shown here below:

For the other terms, depending on the sun's longitude, similar small tables may be constructed, having the day of the year as argument, so that it may be seen immediately whether the correction is at all sensible or not in the tenth of the second. Also those stars, of which one or both of the co-ordinates are so small, that the correction remains always under the assumed limit of accuracy, may be marked with an asterisk.

APPENDIX No. 43. Report of Professor W. C. Bond, on the numberи nf moon, culminations observed at Cambridge, ]Jfas8., and relatice to the Cltronmneter Expedition for difference <if longitude between Camlwidge and Liverpool.

October 3, 1855. DEAR Srn: Since my last report fort.v-two moon culminatiom, with the requisite number of star transits, and seven occultations of stars by the moon, and one immersion and emersion of the planet Uranus, have been observed at this station. To these may be added between one and two hundred single-wire meridian transits of bright spots, or crater-form circular cavities, which were experimentally observed with the moon's limb, for the purpose of ascertaining the relative value of the two methods, when applied to the determination of longitudes. These observations afford additional evidence that the bisection of the smaller cavities, and the transits of the bright points, may be observed with as great exactness as the transit of a star can be under the most fanlfable circumstances, and much more accurately than it is pm;sible to observe the moon's limb. No insuperable difficulty is encountered in making a favorable selection from objects of this kind, on the moon's surface. It is necessary, however, that the different observers should be provided with trustworthy charts of the moon ; for this purpose large crystalotype copies of the daguerreotype representation of the moon, which was taken by our large equatorial, might be obtained at a small expense and distributed among the observers at the different astronomical stations of the Coast Survey. 'l'he electric method of recording astronomical observations, introduced by the Coast Survey, is perfectly adapted to the rapid succession of time records, which the observed transits of the moon's limb, together with one, two, or three of the better defined 11oints on the lunar surface, at the same culmination, would require. The Chr01wrneter Expedition for the determination of the difference of longitude between the Cawbridge and Greenwich Observatories, has been carried forward this year under very favorable circumstances. The temperature trials of the chronometers to be used on this expedition was commenced early in March, 1855. On the afternoon of the 5th of June the chronometers were placed on board the steam-packet .America, under the charge of Messrs. R. F. Bond and P. S. Coolidge ; the vessel sailed for Liverpool the next day, and arrived at Liverpool on the 17th of the same month. Every facility was afforded by the Liverpool officials for the immediate landing of the chronometers, and l\lr. ~artnup, the director of the Liverpool Observatory~ with his wonted kindness, provided a situation for them, as well as for the Coast Survey electric clock and spring governor apparatus, at the observatory . . Messrs. Coolidge and Bond were detained a month in England, under the necessity of waitmg for a steamer of larger size than the Arrierica, and possessing better accommodations. On th~ ~0th of July the chronometers were placed on bnard the As.fo, and sailed the same day, arnvmg at Boston on the 4th of August. After making the requisite observations and comparisons, the chronometers were replaced on boartl the Asia, in charge of :Messrs. P. S. Coolidge and Charles W. Tuttle, on the 14th of August, and landed at the Liverpool Observatory on the 26 th. Favorable weather intervening for observation, the instruments were put on board the 4frica on the 1st of September, and were received at the Cambridge Observatory on the 12th. The condition of the atmosphere having been again propitious for observing, they were again ;an~ferred t? the Africa, on the afternoon of the.25th of Sept.ember, Messr~. P. S. Coolidge.and J. и ll lagg being charged with the duty of makmg the reqmred observations and compansons. It having been ascertained that there was sufficient accommodation in the state-room of the

steamer for nine more chronometers, that number was accordingly added to the forty-two embarked in the America, making the whole number fifty-one. No untoward accident or delay has as yet occurred. 'rhe mean temperature of 65░ Fahrenheit has been pretty steadily maintained, both at sea and on shore. The thermo-chronometer is very satisfactory in its indications. The weather has been propitious for the determination of local time on both sides of the Atlantic. I propose to terminate the transportation of the chronometers for the season, on the return voyage, about the 25th of the present month. I will add, that the report on the computations of the expeditions of 1849, '50, and '51, by Mr. George P. Bond, is ready for the press, and that the reduction of the present expedition was commenced under his charge immediately after the first temperature experiments were made in March last, and is kept in a good state of forwardness. 'rhe present season's work will yield nearly three hundred separate determinations of longitude. Yours, retipectful ly, W. 0. BOND. Prof. A. D. BACHE,

APPENDIX No. 44.

Letter to tlie S1perintendent from Assistant George W. Dean, communicating description of the zenith telescope made by Mr. Wm. Wiirdemann, D. C., 1855, and used at the astronomical station, Dixmont, JJiaine.
CoAsT SURVEY STATION, DIXMONT, ME., October, 1855. Srn: I respectfully submit the following report upon the zenith telescope (No. 10) recently completed by Mr. William Wiirdemann, ot Washington, D. C. This instrument was finished by Mr. Wiirdemann in June last ; and being in Washington at that time, he 1iroposed to me to take charge of it, and to test the accuracy of its mechanical construction by using it at one of the astronomical stations in the Coast Survey. Mr. W rdemann' s proposal met with your ready approval, and the instrument, with one of the best of a similar kind, made for the Coast Survey by Troughton & Simms, of Ijondon, (C. S. No. 2,) was accordingly taken to this station for trial. This zenith instrument is the largest, and in point of nice mechanical construction and finish far excels all others of a similar kind which have fallen within my notice. The inRtrument is supported by three levelling screws, which are inserted near the ends of three projecting brass arms, each extending eleven and a half inches from the centre, and equidistant from each other, thus forming an equilateral triangle, tlie sides of which are eighteen inches in length. Upon this triangular base is an azimuth circle of fifteen inches in diameter, accurately divided upon silver into equal divisions of fifteen minutes each, which, with the aid of the vernier attached, may be read to thirty seconds. The vertical brass column which covers the vertical steel axis is three inches in diameter at its base, slightly conical in shape, and rises twenty-three and a half inches above the plane of the azimuth circle. To this column is attached a neatly constructed brass frame, which extends across the azimuth circle, and carries at one end tlie vernier and lens for reading tlie circle, while at the other is the tangent clamp and screw, by which a delicate motion of the telescope in azimuth may be communicated. U~on this brass frame is fixed, with adjusting-screws, a circular level, which serves for adjusting approximately the vertical axis. The top of the brass column is furnished with a good bearing-surface, upon which the brasH arm which supports the horizontal axis is firmly secured by two capstan-headed steel screws, DEAR

each one and a half inches in length and one quarter of an inch in diameter. Upon ihe end of this horizontal bar, and nearest the telescope, is attached by screws a vertical brass plate oueeig-hth of an inch in thickness) and having a groove one sixteenth of an inch in depth planed ac~oss it, flush with the upper surface of the brass bar to which it is secured, thus forming a stiff spring. This plate supports the end of the steel cylinder nearest the telescope in which the horizontal axis of the telescope tun:i.-;. The opposite end of this cylinder is supported by two stiff, spiral steel springs, resting upon the horizontal brass bar, and kept in position by a capstan-headed Hteel screw, which is one quarter of an inch in diameter. This mode of n.ttaching the horizontal to the vertical axis is both simple and conYenient, as it admits of easy and ready adjustment of the axes at right-angles to each other. The horizontal axis of the telescope is kept in position within the steel cylinder by means of a milled-headed nut upon the end of the axis, which presses lightly against a metallic spring washer in contact with the end of the steel cylinder. The construction ofthe horizontal axi~ and mode of adjustment are in accordance with the original suggestion of the late R. H. Fauntleroy, assistant United States Coast Survey. He proposed constructing a zenith instrument in which the telescope should move in a vertical plane, eccentric to the vertical axis, and provided with a horizontal axis of sufficient length to make it a reliable transit instrument. The telescope of this instrument is fifty-one inches focal length, with an aperture of three and three-fourths inches. The diaphragm consists of five vertical threads at convenient equidistant intervals for observing transits, and is provided with an adjusting screw for collimation. The limits of the field are equal to fifty revolutions of the micrometer screw, or a little more than thirty minutes of arc; but in using the instrument I would not advise measuring distances greater than twentyfive minutes on account of the great compression of the spiral spring acting against the screw, and for other reasons which suggest themselves in practice, but which need not here be stated. The arrangement for illuminating the field is excellent. A small lamp, so constructed that it will give a strong, steady light from seven to eight hours without trimming, is adjusted upon a brass plate connected with the brass bar which supports the remote end of the telescope axis. The light passing through the axis is reflected upon the diaphra,gm by a mirror one quarter of an inch in diameter, made of silver) and adjusted near the centre of the telescope tube. The eye-piece is provided with a parallactic movement, by which an object passing across any part of the field may be made to pass directly in front of the observer's eye. The eye-tube, which carries the diaphragm, micrometer, and eye-piece, is provided with a clamp and tangent screws, by which the verticality of the threads is comиeniently adjusted and securely kept in position. The pivots, or, perhaps more properly speaking, the bearing-points иfor the riding level upon the horizontal axis are ten inches apart and made of German silver. For pre~erving the equality of diameter and their cylindrical form, they ap11ear tu have been made with great care and nicety. Upon the telescope, at right-auglcs to its axis and twelve inches below it, iR attached a neatly made circle or "finder," of six inches in diameter, graduated upon silver into divisions of fift.ee~ minutes each, and with the verniers may be read to thirty seconds. Moving upon an ~xis m the centre of this circle or " finder " is a brass frame which extends across and beyond it, to w?ich it is attached, by suitable adjusting screws, to the level. Mr. Wiirdemann's mode 0 '. rnakmg his levels is original. He grinds the inside of a cylindrical glass tube of suitable s~ze to the required curvature. The ends are then fitted with brass stoppers, which are kept pressed inwards by means of a brass rod which passes lengthwise through the centre of le tube and into the stoppers both ends of this rod ]iaving threads cut upon it, to which the ::~pers are screwed. To the, rod is ~iven n spiral form, the ~etter t~ adapt it. to changes of perature. At one end of the level is a vacuum chamber, which admits of makrng tho length

of the bubble the same at all temperatures. The levels are filled with rectified ether, heated to its boiling-point (96░ Fah.) and then sealed. The observations at this station show the level upon this instrument to be a very perfect one. The telescope is firmly held at any altitude by means of a simple contrivance. This consists of a friction band with a clamp screw, which moves upon a circular steel plate five inches in diameter attached to the end of the steel cylinder nearest the telescope. To this band is fixed by screws a triangular brass frame eighteen inches in length, to whicn is secured a steel bar spring which bears against a shoulder upon the telescope tube and presses the bra:ss frame against a tangent screw upon the tube opposite. The horizontal axis is almost wholly relieved from the weight of the telescope by means of an ingenious contrivance for attaching the counterpoise weight, devised and made by Mr. ░"'rurdemann. The telescope tube to which the axis is attached is strengthened by a brass band five and a half inches in width, and one quarter of an inch in thickness. Upon this band, directly opposite the steel axis and coincident with its centre of motion, is a projection of one quarter of an inch and one half inch in diameter, thus forming an outside (if we may so call it) axis of the telescope; upon this outer axis is fitted one end of a steel arm or lever which curves around the tube of the telescope, (but entirely free from it, so as to admit of a movement of more than 360░ ,) and secured by screws to a strong brass ring which moves upon friction rollers around the steel cylinder before described. This ring is adjusted directly over the centre of the vertical axis and forms the fulcrum for the steel lever which extends to the opposite end of the steel cylinder, and then receives the counterpoise weight which was carefolly tested by experiment so as to balance the teles~ope and its necessary appendages when in adjustment for observing. All the tangent and adjusting screws upon this instrnment are made of German silver, which is a decided improvement over steel for such purposes in field instruments on account of rapid corrosion of the latter. The design and style of finish of this instrument are highly creditable to the artistic taste and workmanship of Mr. Wurdcmann. Very respectfully submitted by G. W. DEAN. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey, Dixmont, Me.

Comparison of Right Ascension.<i.
The total number of observations in the Greenwich Catalogue for the above 398 stars is 4, 113, and in the Hamburg Oatalogue3,852. The average number of observations upon each star is nearly lO for each Catalogue. The average difference J in Right Ascension, irrespective of sign, is 0'.10, and when reduced to the equatorial value the average LI cos. lJ becomes but 0'.08. The greatest difference noticed is 0-'.58. The number of the positive and negative differences nearly balance. ~r~m an extensive comparison of the Greenwich Twelve-Year Catalogue with the British Association Catalogue, by Prof. Looms, in No. 71 of the Astronomical Journal, it appears that 203 stars Were found in which the differtmce amounts to at least 0'.15 (in the average oи. 28), and there are 23 stars whose equatorial difference amounts to more than a quarter of a second (in lnaximo oи. 72).

Comparison of North Polar Distance8.

~nd 3' 778 ; or, for nearly three observations in the Twelve-Year Catalogue, we have two in Rumker' s
T:mburg Catalogue. The average number of observations in the latter Catalogue is nearly nine. taue average difference irrespective of sign is 1" .2, and the greatest 811 .3. The north polar dis~ces are in the average 0".3 smaller in Riimker's Catalogue; and the proportion of positive ~n negative differenooe is a.a 5 to 3. The comp11.ri11on in No. 'Tl contains a table of 218 st.arR,

The number of observations in the Greenwich and Hamburg Catalogues respectively are 5,900

B.EPOBT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

whose difference in declination in the Twelve-Year and British Association Catalogues amounts to more than 111 .5 (in the average 211 .4), and the greatest 7".3. From the above comparison we can infer that Rumker's Catalogue compares more favorably than that of the British Association with the Twelve-Year Catalogue. Very respectfully, yours, Capt. H. W. BENIIAM, Corps of Engineers, Assutant in charge of Coast Survey Office.

APPENDIX No. 45.

Report of Dr. B. A. Govld, Jr., assistant, on tdegraphic operations for difference of "longuude between Columbia, South Carolina, and Macon, Georgia.
MASS., September 21, 1855. DEAR Srn : The telegraph operations for longitude have been extended during the past year as far as :Macon, Georgia, and arrangements have been made for continuing the work to Montgomery and Mobile, and thus reaching New Orlean'l as speedily as is consistent with due care and precision in the operations. In December last, in pursuance of your instruction , I reoccupied the observatory erected the preceding season in the grounds of the State House in Columbia, South Carolina, for the purpose of connecting this with Macon, Georgia; Mr. Dean taking charge of the other station, as in former years. The temporary observatory at Macon had been built in the grounds of иthe academy during the previous winter, although not then occupied; and the building was found in excellent order-thanks to the care of Mr. Miller, the principal of the academy, to whose courtesy Messrs. Dean and Goodfellow express themselves deeply indebted. After a sojourn of a few weeks, I returned to Washington in conformity with your suggestions, leaving the Columbia station in charge of Mr. Edward Goodfellow. The observations were carried out in conformity with the programme, although impeded by serious obstacles ; and after successful exchanges of signals on three different nights, Messrs. Dean and Goodfellow interchanged stations, as had been previously arranged, and obtained exchanges on three more nights with satisfactory results. The series of astronomical observations extends from December 30 to March 16; in addition to which a series of observations were undertaken and completed by Mr. Dean at Macon, for the determination of the latitude and magnetic constants. The experience of evflry year aids in suggesting improvements in methods and implement.a of observation, and the Columbia-Macon campaign promises to furnish results of great precision. To Messrs. Dowell and Heiss, superintendents of the line north of Macon, our acknowled~ ments are due for the facilities which they have uniformly been ready to afford, and then constant, unfailing courtesy. The stars of the Nautical Almanac follow at such wide intervals as to render it most important that the gaps be filled with a considerable number of equally well determined stars. For the circumpolar list, the catalogue given by Struve in his Expedition Glironometrique entre .Altona et Pulkowa has been made available, by reduction, to the year 1855, and very accurate positions of zenith and equatorial stars for determination of the adjustments of the instruments have been deduced from the combination of other catalogues. Still further ext:nsion is eminently desirable, and I have already taken the preliminary steps for deduci~g an ample catalogue of great precision, availing myself of the published results of the chief observatories of the world through a long series of years. The materials furnished by the Greenwich, Dorpat, Pnlkowa, Bonn, Berlin, and Oxford observations, together with the ob11ervation.s of Groombridge, will, without doubt, prove amply sufficient for the purpoae.
CAMBRIDGE,

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The one catalogue should contain the places of stars within 25░ of the pole, culminating at intervals not exceeding ten minutes ; and the other should consist of a series of stars between the declinations of 10░ south and 40░ north, and so selected that one, at least, should cross the meridian every five minutes. :For the present, so long as the telegraphic field-operations are conducted only between the months of December and May, the latter catalogue need only include the positions of such stars as are easily observable during the winter and early spring months. It may be well to append the circumpolar and time-star catalogues adopted for the past eeason.

The use of the line, when not required by the telegraph company, has been conceded to the Coast Survey by the Hon. Amos Kendall, president of the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company, as had been done by his predecessors in former years. The acknowledgments of the telegraph party are due to him, and to his colleagues in the administration of the company's affairs, Messrs. William M. Swain, of Philadelphia, and Edward J. Hyde, of New York, to whose friendly courtesy we are sincerely indebted. The general plan of the operations will be gathered from the programme of operation!!, which was adhered to as rigorously as possible, and which I have the honor to enclose.

Prograrnme of telegraph campaign, Oolumbia-Maoon, 1854-'55.
I. The observers notify one another daily, not later than six p. m., of the state of the weather, "clear" or "cloudy." Should the weather be uncertain, they will send a message to that effect at six o'clock, and a second message of" clear" or "cloudy/' not later than halfpast eight.

II. Should it; be clear at both stations, and the line promise to be available, the observers will prepare for work. This will consist in1. Having the main battel'y filled and set up previous to half-past nine p. m., the zincs having been previously cleaned and amalgamated in the day-time. 2. Observing at least two well-determined circumpolar stars from the MS. catalogue, with reversals of the transit instrument after the middle thread, or between the third and fourth tallies, and with careful readings of the level in each position. Stars within 5░ of the pole should always be observed by eye and ear, using, however, the magnet-beats, and not the clockticks, to indicate the commencement of the second. 3. Observing a series of zenith or equatorial stars from the Nautical Almanac, or, if this be not possible, from the Greenwich Twelve-Year Catalogue; not less than two such stars being observed in each position of the transit instrument. The level should be read for every star, and, when practicable, without moving the instrument from the corresponding altitude. The clock time of reading the level should always be noted to the nearest minute. III. After the operators have connected the observations and adjusted their magnets, so that the two stations receive each other's writing well, with the least possible pass, the clock of the most easterly station is put on. The observer at the other station will then strike a dot each alternate sec'.)nd, until the observer at the clock station signifies "aye, aye," by double dots each alternate second. The exchange of signals then begins as followil:
Reading of level.

First star.
Reversal of instrument.

Second star.
Reading of level.

Third star.
Reversal of instrument.

}fourth star.

&c., &c.
In general, it is only desirable to observe on the three middle tallies ; when clouds are flying it is best to observe on as many threads as possible, as security against loss. The observer always informs the recorder of the tallies observed, and of any lost or badly-struck threads. When ten stars have been satisfactorily exchanged, the eastern clock is taken off the circuit and the western clock put on; and the exchange of ten stars more completes the telegraph work for the night. A good determination of the instrumental corrections after the close of telegraph work, is far -preferable to any increase of the number of star exchanges above '.;wenty. IV. The entrance of a star into the fie'l.d, and the conclusion of an observation 1 should be intimated by a rattle, i.e., a series of taps in rapid succession.и It is often desirable to communicate by means of the break-circuit key without taking off the clock. The following signals will be found convenient for this purpose : "Star lost;" a series of three or four rattles at intervals of two or three second!!. " Your signal not received ; " a series of breaks, at similar intervals. "Aye, aye ;" double dots every alternate second. "Do you receive my signals?'' double and single dots alternately, like a Morse R. "Take off clock;" dots until complied with. . ~he use of these signals will be found important ; and in case neither an observation nor an intunation of its loss be received when due from the other station, it will be understood that some change of connection, adjustment, or battery arrangement is requisite. TV. After the ex.change of stars for the night is completed, the operators may be dismissed. ~o 1D.ore stars from the circumpolar catalogue are then to be observed with reversals, together ;ith not Iese th&D. two from the catalogue of time-stars. When daylight or extreme fatigue oes not prevent, it is desirable to have two time-stars in each position of the instrument.

VI. \Yhen fifty stars have heen satisfactorily exchanged, and on not less than three nights, tl;e observers exchange stations, leaving t1rn transit instruments and clocks as before; mef!ting, however, on one night to observe for personal equation. Fifty stars are then to be exchanged again on not kss than three nights in the new position of the observers, and a. new Reries of observations made for pensonal equation, which completes the series of t:legraphic longitude oliservations. In observing for peri"onal equation, the name of the star and its estimated (not tabular) magnitude should al ways lie recorded. Yll. A series of transits of slnw-rnoving stars Rhould be taken by each observer;иat each station, for the determination of the tl1read-intervals. 'rl1is series should consist, first-of at least six transits of one of the four polar stars (a, i3 and i. Ursre :Minoris and 51 Cephei), half of them observed at the upper, and half at the lower, culmination by eye and ear, with readings of the level before and after each star-the indication of the internal thermometer being also recorded; and, secoudly, of an equal numl>er of stars, between 80░ and 85░ declination, observed, chronograpr1ically, with the same precautions. Besides these, it will be well to strike the time, starn on all t11C threads whenever time and convenience permit. A series of levellings frir determining the inec1uality of pivots should also be made by each observer at each station as often as once in two weeks. The internal thermometer should be noted at intervals during the continuance of these levellings. The value of the level-qi visions should be determi11cd if the Rtfltion be provided with the zenith telescope. In a<ljm1ting the clock, inecision of beat is of the very highest importance. After the best possible adjustment for verticality has been attained by ear, it is important to test it by measure. ments on the Morse fillet, (which gives the longest second-mark,) and this test should be repeated weekly during the continuance of the campaign, the result being noted in the recordbook. Tlw time-book (red) contains an approximate determination of the clock time, azimuth, and collimation, from the whole series of stars observed for instrumental correction on each night. For this purpose, it will be sufficient to estimate the tenths of seconds from the registershcd by simple inspection, and in most cases the middle tally will be sufficient. vVhene\иer the error of the clock amounts to twenty seconds, or its daily rate to more than a second, or tlie azimuth error of the transit instrument to oи.3, or the level error to more than 5", the adjustment should be corrected. VIII. Each station will have forty Grove's cups for the main circuit. It is very desirable to experiment during the campaign with heavy and with light batteries at each end; also with batteries of unequal strength at the two stations, if this be found feasible. But it will be found most convenient to retain the same etrength of battery during the whole of one night's work, unless external circumstances demand a change. :M~in batteries are not to be used on more than one night without being re-amalgamated and supplied with fresh acids. On the morning after a main battery has been used, the cups shou'.d be re-amalgamated, the old acids removed, and the cupt1 filled with pure water, until again required for use. The uniform rule for the direction of the current is for the zincode of the southern and the platinode of the northern station to communicate with the ground. IX. The OPERATOR will see before telegraph work that the batteries are in proper order, and the connections good; that there is sufficient paper, not before used, on the reel; that the Morse-register is in good recording order; the clocks and signal breaks being as sl1ort as possible, consistently with <listinctness of mar king. The adjustment should never be changed during an observation. Wlien the astronomer at either station announces the appearance of the star, which he does by a rattle, the operator sets his register in motion, and marks in pencil upon the margin of the fillet the number of the star, and the station at which it is observed, as called out by t~e . recorder. When the second rattle announces the completion of the observation, the register stopped and wound up, and a pencil-line drawn a.croas the fillet. Due eaution will prevent the

necessity of ever winding during an observation ; but should this ever happen, the place of winding shou'td be marked by a vV. The operator will also keep the fillet wound up, on the reel provided for the purpose, that it may not be soiled hy falling on the floor. At the beginning and 1md of each night's work-and of each fillet, shoulcl more than one be used on the same night-he will mark the date, place, and the word "Reg-inning'' or "End," as the case may be. The l\forse register ought not to deliver less than one inch per Rcconcl. X. The RECORDER will record in ink in the "record;book'' (hlack) all telegraphic messages received and sent; will note the sidereal time at which the operator arriYes and leaYes; and at the beginning and end of observations, as 11""ell as once an hour during their continuance, will note the barometer and thermometer readings, and the condition of the line. He will look after the chronographic register, ancl see that the pen is kept RnppliC'd with ink. that fresh sheets are put on when needed, and the weights wound up. The <late, place, and number of the register sheets arc to he marked in ink wnen the sheets are put on the cylinder. The name of the star to be written in the margin opposite the observation the next day. (The chronograph should not be touched during observations.) иwhen a star is to enter the field at either station, lie will warn the operator, and call out . tlrn number of the star, and place of obsenation to be inscribed on the fillet. He will kel'p a record of the stars observed and recefred in their regular order, and of the level readings, and will keep the observers informed of the settings of the instrument, the approach of the star, and the proper times for reversal and levelling. Telegraphic longitude observations are reco1 <led on the chronograph in dark ink ; observations for instrumental corrections in red. XI. Meteorological observations (white book) will be kept at all the stations, according to the standard rules prescribed for the purpose. и Accompanying this programme are the following papers: 1.

BATTERY :MEMORANDA.

The Grove's cups should be kept filled with pure water when not in use. To set up the battery, pour out the water and fill the cups with a mixture of one part sulphuric acid, and twelve or thirteen parts water. This proportion may be easily recognised by the taste, having about the acidity of sharp vinegar. The porous cups are to be filled with as much nitric acid as ca~ be poured in without endangering the soldering of the platinums, or being liable to run over' but the least mixture of nitric acid in -the outer cup will blacken the zinc.

OF THE

UNITED

STATES COAST SURVEY.

293

The amalgamation of the zinc should take place on the morning after the battery has been used, the acid having been removed, if possible, immediately upon the close of telegraph operations. It will be found convenient to use two battery tumblers-one filled with the dilute sulphuric acid oftlrn ordinary battery strength, the other about a quarter full of mercury, and filled up as far as possible with a mixture about twice as strong. Then to amalgamat~ the zincs well, dip them in the first tumbler until they show an effervescence ; next scrub in water with a nailbrush, and then dip them into the mercury tumbler, until the whole surface is brightly coated and all effervescence has ceased. It is desirable to provide a little drain for conducting off waste acid, so that the fumes may do no harm to any of the instruments. The soldering of all the platinums should be examined daily, as it is so easily corroded by the fumes from the nitric acid. To guard against this corrosion, the soldering should be kept thoroughly coated with the composition provided for the purpose. Should, by any accident, the zinc become blackened to an extent not easily remediable by this process, they may be brightened by immersion in dilute muriatic acid. In case the battery should cease to act well during telegraph operations, the nitric acid in the porous cups is to be replenished. The local or self-sustaining battery (Mathiot) needs only to be kept well supplied with zinc, and the jars filled with a mixture of eight parts water to one sulphuric acid. The mercury in the troughs may need replenishing from time to time. Six cups are sufficient; eight are ample. The lids of the boxes ought to be kept open while the batteriPs are in action.

TO PUT UP KESSEL'S CLOCK.

1. Lift off board with pendulum fast to it, and place it in a safe horizontal position. 2. Lift out clock by straps. 3. Take off outer case of the clock. 4. Take off brass covers to machinery: 5. Unscrew two screws in bottom of clock part, and lift off clock-face and machinery. 6. Hang back of clock to pier, plumbing very carefully in two directions, and fasten by screws at bottom, adjusting by screws near point of suspeusion. 'i. Hang on pendulum with very great care, keeping hands covered, and not permitting any lateral motion to springs near Y's. The suspension pivots of pendulum fasten on to rod by a pin. 8. Put on clock-face and machinery, passing the pin of pendulum-guide into the lower of two holes in pendulum, and unhooiking the little hook which confines the counterpoise to pendulumguide. 9. Adjust pendulum to secure uniformity of beat-first by motion of large bob, and lastly by small screw in right side of guide. Judge by car when the beats are uniform, then test by chronograph. 10. Hook on weight and set clock in motion. . 11. Adjust for rate by turning capstan-head screw in pendulum bob: (turning screw to right, shortens pendulum, and vice versa.) The clocks used were, as in the previous campaign, those by Hardy and Kessel, belonging to the Coast Survey, and both adapted to the chronographic method of observation by Mr. Saxton. Th: Kessel's clock is an admirable piece of workmanship, and has always performed in a most satisfactory manner. It is worth mentioning that, during a period of three months in the past summer, while this- clock was set at Cloverden, the sum of its daily changes amounted to less than two sidereal seconds. The Hardy clock is a more cumbrous instrument, and its per~ormance has not been so satisfactory. It has been, however, refitted by Mr. Saxton, and much im~roved since the close of the campaign. The new clock by Krille, the successor of Kessel! W~ich you authorized me to bespeak, is now finished at .A.ltona, and at last accounts was undergoing the tests to which Professor Peters, the director of the observatory, has kindly consented

to submit it. The maker has had in its construction especial reference to facility of transportation, and has introduced a number of modifications, all tending to this end. The spring- governor and Kerrison regulator were used for the chronographic registry of the transit observations, owing to the far greater convenience in managing their records, and in recognising the respective observations. But, during the exchange of telegraphic signals, au ordinary Morse register has also been employed at each station, and gives results well comparable in accuracy with either of the former, owing to the greater length of the se~onds as recorded upon the fillet, and to the general uniformity maintained during any change Of rate. The spring-governor was not in good order, and gave much trouble to the astronomers at Columbia, but has since been refitted by Messrs. Bond, the makers. It is now mounted at Cloverden, where it is in use for observations upon personal equation, and graduates the sheets with great beauty. Essential modifications have been introduced by the makers; among others, the much-needed improvement of springs for securing the sheets upon the cylinder. The vane fly-wheel has also been removed, and its place supplied by a governor not dissimilar in principle to that which regnlates the motion of the Munich equatorials. Many of the disadи vantages of the spring-connexion appear thus to be avoided. .A careful comparison of the results by different registers, or some thorough test, will, however, be very desirable, and t11e most searching and trustworthy scrutiny will doubtless be obtained by making use of the suggestion of Professor Peirce, and connecting two circuit-breaking clocks with the instrumentone of these indicating mean, and the other sidereal time. To escape confusion in the record, it would be better if the clock which indicates mean time should give its signa.ls but once in two seconds. Then the several mean-time signals would be successively registered in every part of the sidereal seconds for which the spring-governor is adapted, and any want of uniformity in the movement of the cylinder duri~g the interval between the recorded commencements of two consecutive seconds would thus be made palpable. I hope to find opportunity, during the coming year, to subject the several chronographs to this test. Both the stations were provided with a se1f-susta.inirig battery of six cups of Mr. Mathiot's construction, which have given entire satisfaction, except in the minor details. The variation of the current is but slight; and the battery, if put in proper order, will remain for months ready for immediate use. The material of the cups is not all that could be desired, as they are frequently warped or bent in the making, and liable to leak. But these defects are easily remedied; and I anticipate great advantages from this arrangement of the local batteries. The same main batteries have been used as in former years, though I look forward to the possible future use of magneto-electric machines as a great step in advanee. Circumstances prevented the repetition of the experiments for velo~ity and telegraphic signals during the last winter. Should it be feasible during the ensuing season, I hope to carry out this cherished hope, and to institute experiments with different kinds of иbatteries, and with the magneto-electric machines. The station at Cloverden has been continued in use during the past sea.son, and a series ~f observations for latitude is now making with zenith telescope C. S. No. 5, the previous determination having resulted from measurements with No. 2. The difference of construction aud of finish between the two instruments renders a determination with each quite desirable-No. 2 having been furnished by Mr. Simms, in London, w bile No. 5 is the work of our accomplished mechanic Mr. \Viirdemann, and finished in every part with much greater precision. During the present year the reductions have advanced with great rapidity, those of tile Raleigh-Columbia and the Colurnbia-Mar.:on campaign having been carried along with a near.ly equal rate. I am not aware that any refinement of reduction has been overlooked; and my chief anxiety is, lest it should be impossible to attain for observations in the field, a delicacy comи mensurate in degree with these niceties of reduction. But the chronographic method of observation, suggested and developed as it has been from the beginning by and for the Coast Survey, 8 both as regards implements and methods of recording as well as of observing, is entitled to thorouih and unimpeded opportunity of manifesting the amount of itt superiority.

I have alluded to the observations for 1iersonal equation. These have been made with care, before and after the telegraphic campaign, and at other times. The supply of materials for investigating this most curious prol>lem is augmenting, and the observations are for the most part entirely reduced. For the deduction of inferences, a more extended study is desirable than I have been able to give to the subject <luring the past year, and I will therefore refrain for the .. present from adding anything to the conclusibns which I presented in behalf of the Coast Survey to the American Association at th-,ir mи eting in Cleveland. The telegraphic connection between Columbia and \Vilmington is nearly completed, and it is expected that the line will lie entirely finished along the "\Vilmington and Manchester railroad by the first of Octolier next. I would earnestly suggest the importance of availing ourselves of this opportunity to connect the two stations, (De Rosset and Columbia,) each of which bas been already connected with Seaton through an intermediate station, and whose telegraphic connexion at present, while attended with the advantage that the line is new and constructed with more than usual care, would furnish an extraneous means not hitlierto enjoyed of criticising the precision of a telegraphic connection of distant stations. In concluEion, I would respectfully submit a few slight modifications to be intrnduced into the programme for the coming season, and remain, with the sincerest respect, Most faithfully yours, B. A. GOULD, JR. Prof. A. D. BACHE, LL. D., Superintendent ll. 8. Coast Survey.

APPENDIX No. 47.
Table of magnetic declinat-ions, observed in the Coast Survey, with 1wtes by A. D. Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, and J. E. Hilgwиd, assistant, accompanied by a map. (Slcetch Ko. 56.)

The present table of magnetic declinations is enlarged from that published in the annual report for 1854, by the addition of recent observations, and contains all the observations made during the progress of the survey from 1844 to 1855. The localities are arranged in a natural geographical order, beginning with the northeastern part of the Atlan.tic coast. The latitudes and longitudes are given to the nearest tenth of a minute. Most of these stations are trigonometrical points, and may be found in the list of geographical positions published in the annual reports for 1851 and 1853. , The magnetic meridian has generally been determined with the portable declinometer of Gauss and Weber; in some instances with a variation transit or a magnetic theodolite. Obser~ations were generally made about the time of the day maxima and minima, the mean of which 18 the declination given in the table. In some cases, half-hourly observations, from 6h. a. m. to 6h. p. m., were made; and, in a few instances, the observations were continued for half an liour only. All of these have been reduced to the same mean position by means of the curves of daily variation, derived from observations at the magnetic observatories at the Girard College arnl Toronto . . The astronomical meridian has generally been obtained from the azimuths of the triangulation, or occasionally by special observii.tions of the Sun or Polaris . . At some of the stations where local attraction was suspected, observations have been made at different times and .at different localities not far distant from each other.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

NOTES. l!'rom the observations in the preceding table, it is proposed to deduce the approximate positions of lines of equal declination, or 1'.sogonic lines; and, by means of a graphic representation of the same, to furnish the means of obtaining readily the declination at any point near the range of the observed stations. For this purpose, the observations are divided into three general groups or systems, for separate discussion, viz: those near the Atlantic coast ; those on the shore of the 'Gulf of :Mexico ; and those on the Pacific coast. For each of these groups a system of co-ordinates of position is selected, suited to the intended process of interpolation ; the stations are then grouped in such a manner, as far as practicable, as to give the best co-ordinates for determining the co-efficients expressing the rate of change of declination. Each group furnishes a conditional equation, expressing the difference between the mean observed declination of the group and that at the origin of co-ordinates, in terms of the coordinates of position, multiplied by unknown co-efficients, which are determined by the combination of a sufficient number of equations, treated by the method of least squares when their number exceeds that of the unknown values. Previous to forming the equations, the observed declinations are reduced to the common date of January, 1850, the annual change applied being derived from observations made at some of the stations in different years. After these preliminary statements, we proceed to the discussion of the several systems, beginning with that of the Gulf coast as the most simple.
I. MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.

For the discussion of the stations along the Gulf coast, from Key West to the Rio Grande, the latitudes and longitudes of the stations are convenient co-ordinates of position, and well adapted to the purpose, as we have considerable changes of either co-ordinate, without much change of the other. The observed declinations are reduced to the common date of January, 1850, by an assumed annual decrease of easterly declination of 01.5, or 0░.00S, derived from observations made at Pascagoula in 1847 and 1855, in the absence of any other reliable data. The change is certainly very small, and its influence on the result quite insensible. Without assuming any general law of distribution of magnetism, it is proposed simply to interpolate between the observations, on the supposition that the declination changes in a definite ratio with the co-ordinates, and that the rate of change is also subject to change, amounting to an interpolation by second differences, and leading to conditional equations of the second degree, which may be written thus: dV v x dL ydM zd L dM p d L2 q d M2, where d V =the difference between the observed declination and the assumed declination yr at the origin of co-ordinates. v = the correction to the assumed V 1 и d L, d M =differences of latitude and longitude from origin. x, y, z, p, q, co-efficients to be determined. . This equation containing six unknown quantities, we form of the stations in the Gulf 81 ~ groups, as shown in the subjoined table, favorably situated for the determination of the coefficients. The mean of latitudes and longitudes is assumell as origin of co-ordinates, and the mean observed declination as that belonging to that position subject to the correction v. The solution of the conditional equations gives the following expression for the declination V, at any point having the latitude L and longitude M, within the range of observations, viz:

II. MAGNETIC DECLINATION ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST OF TJIE Ul\"'ITED STATES.

The stations extending along the coast in a narrow belt having a southwesterly direction, it was found most advantageous to refer their positions to an axis of abscissae, extending in the same general direction, and balancing nearly the positive and negative ordinates. This axis is ~ ~reat circle passing through latitude 43░ 261, longitude 70░ 24', and latitude 29░ 07 1, longiT~ e 83░ 03'. The origin of co-ordinates is assumed in the middle between these two positions. g e ~?""ordinates of position are expressed in degrees and decimals of this circle, and were rap Ically obtained by careful plotting on a large sea.le.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The observations in the general table have been reduced to January, 1850, by assuming an annual change of 5' increase of westerly declination for all stations from No. 1 to No. 113, of 4'.5 from No. 114 to No. 11'7, and of 4' from No. 118 to No. 124. A reference to the special discussion of this subject, in Appendix No. 48 of this report, will show that these values correspond, as nearly as the value of our data admits of, to the results derived from recent observations. Declination west is considered positive ; declination east negative. The form of conditional equations is the same as that in the previous discussion, and may here be_written: v = vi + v + x x + y y z x y P x2 + q y2. In order to obtain a better determination of the co-efficients z and q than could be had from the small ordinates of these Coa~t Survey stations along the Atlantic coast, some of the stations in the Gulf of Mexico were also used in this discussion, and the following data obtained from the sources stated; the annual variation being an estimated approximation, by comparison of the known values at Toronto and on the Atlantic coast, viz:

The stations were arranged in thirty-one groups, as shown in the subjoined table; some stations, where a local error was apparent, being omitted. The condition.al equations were satisfied, as nearly as possible, by combining them according to the method of least squares, and the following numerical equation was obtained : v = 0░.44 west+ 0.945 x 0.513 y 0.0211 x y + 0.0344 X 2 _:_ 0.01'7'7 Y2 и On plotting the line of 5░ east, according to this expression, it was found that it coincided very nearly in direction with the same line derived from the Gulf of Mexico system, and that it differed only 0░.16, or 10', in position. An examination of the expression and residuals showed that a change of - 0. 0022 in the co-efficient of X 2 would produce an entire agreement of the two systems at this point, while, on the whole, the residuals would be improved, the more reliable observations being benefited by this minute change. The isogonic lines on the map, from 14░ west to 5░ east, are therefore computed according to the following expression: v = 0░.44 west+ 0.94:5 x 0.513 y + 0.0211 x y 0.0322 X 2 - 0.0177 Y2; and the corresponding residuals of the groups are given in the subjoined table.

The mean residual is ▒ 16'. III. MAGNETIC DECLINATION OX THE PACIFIC COAST OF THE UXITED STATES.

The stations along this coast are referred to an axis of abscissae graphically assumed on the map, and so situated as to give nearly balanced positive and negative ordinates. In the absence of any data for obtaining the annual change, the result of the discussion may be assumed to correspond to the mean date of 1852. Owing to the smallness of the ordinates, we cannot expect to obtain any determination of the r~te of change of their co-efficients, and the conditional equation used in the discussion is simply the following : v = 16░.30 east+ v +xx+ y y + p X 2 и Forming eight conditional equations and ccmbining them by the method of least squares, so as to obtain the values of the unknown quantities, we fi.nd-

V = 16░.88 east+ 0.534 Y + 0.104 X + 0.0022 X 2 ; according to which the residuals in the tables and the lines on the map are computed.

APPENDIX No. 48.

Report to the Sitperintendent of the U. S. Coast Survey f!f a discussion of the secular variation hi the metynetic declination on the Atlantic and part ef the Gulf Coast uf the United States; by Charles A. Schott, chief qf Computing Division U. 8. Coast S1trvey office. (Sketch No. 51.)
\Communirnfrrl tn t.h" ArnP.rican A~Hoci:ttinn for the Aclnmcemcnt of Science, by authority of the Treasury Department.]

DEAR Srn: This investigation was undertaken with a view of deducing the reduction to the srtme epoch of any of the CoaRt Survey observations for magnetic declination, and also with a view of predicting or calculating the declination for positions occupied prior to the present time, as well as to restore from present observations the declination at some earlier date. The extensive use of the compass in the surveys of public landR, renders a knowledge of the law of change in the direction of the needle during this and the latter half of the last century an ol>ject of great importance, the aid of which law is not unfrequently called upon in legal proceedings. Though an investigation of the observations taken during the last decennium would have furnished approximate results for the immediate purposes of the survey, yet it is apparent that no general law could be deduced in this way, and it became necessary at once to include all available material from the earliest time to the present. The discussion is based npon one hundrccl and eighty observations taken at stations distributed over the Atlantic coast and the eastern part of the Gulf coast. In reference to terrestrial magnetism in general, Prof. Hansteen has lately published his investigations on the secular variation of the magnetic inclination, in the Astronomische Nachrichten, Nos. 947, 948, and 954. (See for a short abstract Comptes Rendus, t. xl, No. 15). The appearance of thiti paper, and the necessity of the reduction of our observations for declination, rmhlished in the Superintenclent'R annual report of 1854, gave a new impulRe to this and similar in vcstigations. Beyond the fact of the nearly stationary condition of the direction of the needle about the commencement of this century in the northeastern States, and the observed increase of westerly declination in opposition to the former decrease of the same in the New England States, little was known in reference to the law of the secular change, either as to the precise epoch, or as to the geographical relation. It is to Dr. Bowditch and Prof. Loomis that wc are mostly indebted on this imbject; to the former for having called attention to the phenomenon at the tirue when the change from the direct ~o the retmgrade motion took place; to the latter for a large collection of valuable observations of magnetic declinations in the United States, and also

OF

THE UNITED STATES COAST, SURVEY.

for two charts of isogonic lines for the years 1838 and 1840. l'rof. Loomis state~ that itll the observations indicate a retrograde motion of the needle, which commenced as early as 181(}, arnl in some places, perhaps, as early as 17H3. The pre8cnt (184 0) annual change of the variatiou is ahout two minutes for the southern States, four for the milltllc, and six for the :'.\ew England States. (See Silliman' s Journal of Science and Arts, vol. xxxix, 1840). In the fallowing discussion I have irned nearly all the data I was able to collect: yet there can be no doubt that much valuable information might he obtaiued from the surveyors of pnlilie landH, as their results generally are derived from a numher of obserYations at different pl1H,e1<, and for this reason are more likely to be free from any local <leYiation, thP effects of which are more to be guarded against than errors of observation. Results obtained lJ_v tlie cll'diuary surveyor's compass thus show, at the stations Providence, Hatboro', and others, the liest <tgreement. In order to obtain reliable results fi)r the secular change, it i8 cssn1tia1 that the ol1scrvations should be made at the same spot; but this is seldom the case, and to this circumstance differen~eR, amounting in some instances to half a degree and more, must be attributeu. The observations at stations mentioned in the follmdng pages have been discussed in thn'e different ways, depending on the dates of their commencement and termination. Those primи to the middle of the eighteenth centurr rerp1ire, as will be seen in the discussion, ~t functi.,11 inrnlving an additional term in the expression for the declination: to this class belong the ;:;tations Providence, R. I., Hatboro', Pa., and Philadelphia. Others reacJ1ing as far hack as thlи;;e arr too discordant for use. Observations taken on ship-board are unreliable on account of local attraction, and hence have not been employed in the discmsion. The second class includes o11serrntions made subsequent to the middle of the eighteenth century at the three statiorni, and at seven others prior to that time, and reaching to the present. The third class includes all stations having two or more observations of comparatively recent date, and these, it may br nиmarked, are less important for deducing the secular change than for the construction of the isogonic lines. Throughout the discussion westerly declination has been considered as i1ositivc, and easterly Uii negative. The formulce used being the same for all stations, require but once to be explained, and are given in full in the discussion of the first station of the first and secoml cla8s. All olJservations have been scrutinized, and the references are affixed to the results. The separate heaus into which the subject divides itself are as follows : a. Discussion of the secular change at stati()ns, with reliable observations dating prior to about the year 1740. b. Discussion of the secular change at stations, with rcliahle observations dating after that time. c. Statement of results from comparatively recent observations. d. Establishment of formulre expressing the secular variation of the magnetic declination at any place within the limits indicated on the title-page of this paper. Synopsit> of results and general remarks. We commence with the discussion of the observations comprised under the 11ead n. a. Discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic declination from tlH' oldest reliable set of observations, viz: those recorded at Providence, Rhode Island; Hatboro', Pennsylvania; and at Philadelphia. The first-namecl set includes thirty observationR, made between 1717 and ~S45; the second, commencing with the year 1680, presents eighteen ob~ervations, made at equal inten'als, terminating with the year 1850 ; the thinl contains ten observati()ns, recorded between the years 1701 and 1847.

II. DISCUSSIO~ OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT HATBORO', rA.

The results for declinations of this excellent set were communicated to Prof. A. D. Bache, Snperintendent Coast Survey, by Mr. E. W. Beans, in a letter dated Hatboro', March 1, 1852. This place is a1Jont ten miles north of Philadelphia, in latitude 40░ 07 1 N., longitude 75░ 08' W. Mr. Beans expresses his entire confidence in the accuracy of the data collected, and their agreement sufficiently proves this fact. The observations are as follows: Declination in 1680

DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT PHILADELPHIA, PA.

The latest observations having been made at Girard College, and no particular locality being assigned to the old observations, we may assume for them the position latitude 3~ 0 58' N., and longitude 75░ 10' W. In volume xxiii of Silliman's Journal, 1833, Mr. Gillet give1 the following observations at Philadelphia : In 1701 the declination was 8░ 301 west by Mr. Scull. 1793 " 1 30 " Mr. Brooks. 1802 " 1 30 " Mr. Howell. 1804 " 2 00 " several men of science. 1813 " 2 27 " Mr. иwhitney. In 1770 Cook observed the declination 3░ 08' W. in latitude 40░ 101 N., longitude 75░ 16' W., (see Ency. Metrop.,) but the longitude required a correction of about 25' (from co.mparison of the longitude assigned to Boston and Cambridge.) This observation agrees well with the Hatboro' curve, but being about half a degree to the westward, could not be used in that place. For a similar reason, an observation made by Professor A. D. Bache at Westchester, in 1832, could not be included. In volume xxxiv of Silliman's .Journal we ftnu the following additional observations: In l'TlO the declination was so 30' west by Th. Whitney. 1750 " 5 45 " Kalm's Travels. 1793 " 1 30 " Th. Whitney. 1804 " 2 10 " " 1813 " 2 25 " Dr. McClure. 1837 " 3 52 " W. R. Johnson . . On May 23d, 1846, we have a determination by the U. S. Coast Survey, (see report of 1854,) ~z.: declination 3░ 51 1 W. This result agrees well with a number of observations made in the vicmity of Philadelphia. The observations made at Girard College (see Pub. Doc. 2d session of the 29th Congress) between June, 1840, and June, 1845, by Prof. A. D. Bache, are differential observations. The observed increase during this time was 25' .5, hence the annual increase :::: ~' .1. Assuming this same incre.ase during the following year, 1845-6, would give us the decli;~tion :or May, 1840, 3░ .33. We have, therefore, the following table of declinations for the

.According to the results deduced from the observations made at these three stations, the minimum declination took place in 1804 ▒ 9 years. At this time the needle had approached nearest to the true north, the western declination being greater before arn.l after this time. The maximum variation appears to have occurred in 1679 ▒ ten years. Hence the duration of half an oscillation, if we are allowed to draw the inference, \Yould be one hundred and twenty-five years ▒ 15 ; but this must at present be considered as a mere speculation. The uniformity in the epoch of the minimum for a great geographical extent in a north and south direction, as we will see further on, would lead to the inference of a constant duration of half an oscillation in the geographical direction indicated. At Paris and London the maximum of easterly declination (equivalent to a minimum of western) took place about 1680, aml the maximum of wcstl'rn declination about 1815, with a range of not less than 34░, while the average range at the above three stations is but 6░. The maximum of westerly declination in the northwestern part of Europe, therefore, took place nearly simultaneously with the minimum westerly declination on the eastern coast of the United States. I shall return to this subject after the discussion of the ol)servations comprised under the head l1. The maximum annual variation V took place in 1741 ▒ 10 years; and if, after an equal intenal of time T - T 11 , or sixty-three years, the greater annual change should again take lllace, wc must expect it about the year 1867 ▒ 15 years. Observations made during the present year yet indicate an increasing change, so far supporting this conjecture. The average value of V for the three stations is - 4'.6 showing, at the same time, an increase with an approach to the line of no variation.
b. D1:scussion of the secular i1ariation qf magnetic declination from reliable observation1>, dating subsequent to the year 1740, with rwtice of others made prior to that tiine.

From the preceding discussion it is obvious that all observations after the time T" can be re1)resented by an equation of the second degree, which will give the epoch of the minimum its corresponding and all other declinations between that time (corresponding to the former point of inflexion of the curve) and the present. This formula will only apply up to the time of a second point of inflexion yet to be observed . . Although this class includes observations reaching considerably beyond the middle Jf the eighteenth century, yet, for want of general conformity, such have been omitted in the discussion. For .the purpose of a ready comparison of the co-r,fficienfs of the terms involving the interval of time for the several stations, and for the purpose of ascertaining their change with reference ~o their geographical position, a re-discussion of the preceding three stations becomes necessary, In which the observations after 1740 are alone used. _The stations have been arranged in the order of their geographical position, commencing with the observations in the New England States.

I. DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CIIANGE AT BOSTON, MASS.

In volume xvi of Silliman's Journal a collection of declinations for Boston, Falmouth, :mrl Penobscot has been pulilished under the title "Table exhibiting the variation of the compass in Boston and the parts adjacent from the earliest acc0unts of it to the eighteenth century, agreeable to actual observations, by John Winthrop, Esq." Though the observations were said to be simultaneous, an examination at once shows that the table was formed by interpolation. \Ve are indebted to Professor Loomis for this exposition, who, having obtained a MS. copy, was able to separate the few actual observations from the interpolated results. In distinguishing observations made at or near Boston from others in the vicinity, I was guided by the table given in the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, volume ii, new series, 1846, and have omitted all Cambridge observations for the declination at Boston, and assumed in Silliman' s Journal as Boston observations. The first observation recorded in the "Winthrop table is in 1700, and the declination is put down as 10░ W. The next observation is in 1708, (see Ency. Metrop.,) observer Mathews, 9░ W. This, however, is not to be confounded with the Cambridge observation of the same year, and recorded result. Brattle observed at Cambridge, while M. observed six miles east of Cambridge. Mathews' observation of 17 41 differs half a degree from the Cambridge observation, and was found 7~ 0 \V. In Des Barres' Atlantic Neptune the magnetic declination for Boston harbor is given 7░ 40' W. for the year 1775; and as this is about 1░ too great, it has been omitted in the discussion. Dr. Bowditch, in the first volume of the Mem. of the Academy, gives the declination for 1782, 7░ 0' W.; and in the new series of the Memoirs, volume ii, 1846, we find the mean of 1,644 observations for 1793, 6! 0 W. Bond, in volume xxxix of Silliman's Journal, 1840, finds the declination at Dorchester in lB:rn, 9░ 61 W. Dorchester is in latitude 42░ 19' N., longitude 71░ 41 W., and the observation, when reduced to the State-house (Boston) (in latitude 42░ 21 1 N., longitude 71░ 03'.5 W.) becomes !! 0 .12 W. The nearest Coast Survey station is Dorchester Heights, about a mile and a half to the southward of the State-house. The annual report of the Superintendent for 1854 gives the declination in September, 18'16, 9░ 31'.4 W. The reduction to the State-house is inconsiderable. We have, therefore, the following observations for discussion:

IT. DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT CAMBRIDGE, MASS.

In the Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, new series, volume ii, Cambridge, 1846, we find an account of magnetic declinations observed at the Harvard University observatory, by Professors J. Lovering and W. C. Bond, and a table of declinations from the period of the earliest observations. To the other observations the authorities are affixed.

(For the other results see synopsis.)

This agreement is so close that the introduction of these late observations in the discussion would not alter the formula as deduced above. These observations further indicate that the point of inflexion has probably not been reached ; a circumstance of importance for the other stations, which will permit of the extension of the formula deduced at these stations, at least up to the present time. The above Cambridge observation of 1855, and another at East Pascagoula, Mississippi, also of 1855, are the only late ones I could avail myself of for this extension.

The position of Yale College spire is latitude 41░ 18' north, longitude 72░ 55' west.

De Witt, in Aug.ust, 1818, viz: 5░ 45' W. This is undoubtedly too large, and will not be used in the discuss10n. In the same volume Prof. Fisher gives the declination from hourly observations, be.tween May, 1819, and April, 1820, 4░ 25'.4 \V. In volume xxx, 1836, Prof. Loomis obtatned from hourly observations, between November, 1834, and November, 1835, the mean declination 5░ 40' 3411 W. In volume xxxiv, 1838, Mr. Herrick gives the declination 5░ 50' W. November, 1837. In volume xxxix, 1840, the declination for 1840 is given 6░ 10' W. bhe following two observations were taken from the list of the United States Coast Survey 0 servations, (Annual Report of Superintendent for 1854,) viz: ~ecl~nationat Yale College, September 10, 1845, 6░ 17'.3 \V., J.

V. DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT NEW YORK.

The earliest observations on record are those by Hudson on his third voyage, in 1609. (S~e volume xxxix of Silliman's Journal, 1840.) In August Hudson observed near the coast, rn latitude 39░ 11' N., the declination 11!0 W.; in September, a few miles up the Hudson river, 13░ W.; in September, near the Jersey shore, a little below the mouth of the Hudson, 8░ W. The day before he found not above 2░ W. In October, on the coast, in latitude 39░ 30' :N., 6░ W. These observations were probably made on ship-board, and for nautical purpose1-1, and have an uncertainty of at least half a point. A mean of all, or 8░ W., may be used for a general c?~ parison. In 1686, Mr. Welles observed the declination s0 451 W. (See volume xxxiv Sill~ man's Journal, 1838; also the Encyclopredia Metrop.) In the same place we :find G. Burne~ 8 observations in 1723, viz : 7░ 20' W. In Des Barres' .Atlantic Neptune, published in London, 1 ~ 1 '781, the declination near Sandy Hook is given 7░ W. for 1775: this determination is about 2 . in error, and consequently has not been used. For the discussion we have the following valuesи 38 In 1750, Mr. Alexander observed the declination 6░ 22' W.-Silli~an'sJour., vol. xxxiv, 18 и 1755, Mr. Evans.................................. 5 00 W.-Ibid. 1789, No authority given....................... 4 20 W.-Ency.

VIII. DISCl'.SSION OF TllE SECULAR VARIATION AT CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.

In Des Barres' Atlantic Neptune the declination for 1775 jg given 3░ 48' E., which is probably the same observation as given on a map for 1777 in latitude 32░ 47' north, longitude 79░ 57 1 W. (See Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiv, 1838.) From Blunt' s chart the variation of the compass in 1824 and 1825, by Lieutenant Sherburne, U. S. N., is 3░ 45' E. In 1837, Captain Misroom gives the variation 2░ 54' E. (See Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiv, 1838.) Barnett observed .in May, 1841, the declination 2░ 241 E. in latitude 32░ 41 1 N., longitude 79░ 53 1 W. (See Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., vol. for 184H.) At Breach иinlet, near the entrance to Charleston harbor, in latitude 32░ 46'.3 N., and longitude 7H 0 48'. 7 W., we have the determination by the United States Coast Survey, (Report for 1854,) viz: 2░ 16'.5 E. for April, 1849. This observation, when reduced to Fort Moultrie, in latitude 32░ 45'.5 N ., longitude 19░ 51'.2 W., becomes - 2░ .30, and the Yalues for discussion are0

IX. DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT MOBILE, ALABAMA.

In Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxix, 1840, the declination at Mobile, latiturle 30░ 40' N., longitude 88░ 11' W., is given by l\fr. J. H. иweakly, 8░ 10' E. for 1809. In vol. xxxiv, 1838, also in the Ency. Tirit., 7th edition, the declination in J\fohile bay is given G0 30' E. for 1814. Taking the mean of these two determinations, we find for the discussion- 7░.33 for 1811.5. In vol. xxxix of Silliman's Journal, Mr . иT. H. Weakly gives the declination for 1835, 7░ 12' E. The isogonic lines run nearly parallel with the major axis of l\1obilc bay, and the observations made at Fort Morgan, at the entrance of the bay, need no reduction for difference of latitude. We have for this the determination by the U. S. Coast Survey in May, 1847, (see Report for 1854,) 7░ 041 и l E., latitude 30░ 13'.9 N., longitude 88░ 00'.3 W. In a report of Commander Powell, U. S. N., the magnetic declination for 1\Iobile light-house is given 6░ 56' E. for 1843. At East Pascagoula, a re-determination of the declination was made in 1855, after an interval of eight years, which gave for the annual variation a decrease of easterly declination (equal to an increase of westerly) of about 0'.5. Both observations were made by Assistant J.E. Hilgard, of the U.S. Coast Survey. \Ve can now reduce the above observations in 1847.3 to 1850, and find -7░.05. Tcible of observed declinat,ions.

X. DISCUSSION OF THE SECULAR CHANGE AT HA.V.ANA, CUBA.

REPORT

OF

THE

SUPERINTENDE~T

(see Ency. Met. 1848.) J. Harris observed off Havana, in latitude 23░ 08' N., ]onf!;itude s2░ 32' \Y., in April, 1732, the variation 4~ 0 E., (see Ency. Met. 1848, and Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc., vol. vii (abrid[1ed) 1724-1734.) The 1\loro Castle is in latitude 23░ 09' N., and longitude 82░ 22' \Y. These observations agree, and 'vere therefore used in the discussion; antl althou~h the date is somewhat early, t11e general flatness of the corresponding curve shows their atlmi:<sibility for the discussion. In the Ency. Brit., 7th edition, we find the declination in 1815, 7░ 00' E., and in August, 1816, 5░ 30' E. The mean of these two, or-6░.25,)1asl1cen used. The above data, however, would not suffice to deduce the law of change; I have.therefore made use of the modern observations on the Gulf of Mexico, which have been representeJ within a few minutes by the following formula :

dV= where

This formula exactly represents the observation at Sand key, oPiiosite Havana, and gives for this latter place the declination in 1850, :ic. i2 K, which can only differ from the true declination by the effect of local deviation.

Tbe order in which the stations have 'Leen arrangetl seneR to show the dependence of the coefficients x, y, z, upon the geographical position of the stations; but it is the last two co-efficients which will be innstigated further on, as on these alone de11end the Recnlar change and the time of the minimum. The epoch of the minimum (T) appears to be suldcct to local irregularities, as disclosed by the probable errors (sT), and a general law or dependence on the same cause is strongly rnarketl as affecting every station on the Atlantic seaboard, and even traceable from the southern shore of Hudson's bay to Jamaica. The mean T, without regard to the probable error, is 1796, and wheu we forni the differences, T - mean, the figures at once show that in the raRtcrn States the minimum of magnetic declination took place about a decennium earlier, and about the same number of years later in the eastern gulf States than in the milldle States. In the last chapter this geographical relation of the co-efficients y and z, and of the epoch T, will 1'2 more fully investigated. It is no more surprising to find local deviations in the epoel1 of the minimum than in the declination itself. . 'rhe general flatness of the curves as we approach the Gulf of 1\fexico is remarlrnlile, and inuuced me to collect a few obRervations for declination at Jamaica, \'V. I., latitude 17░ 58' N., longitude '16░ 46' 'VY. Permanent declination at Kingston, Jamaicn, from 1660 to l80~'. 6░ 30' E., (J. Robertson, Phil. Trans. Royal Society, 180fi.) Declination from a plan of Krngston, by ~T. Leard, in 1791 and 1792, 6░ 45' E., and by the same authority in 1789 a~d 1793, 6░ 50' E. On :Minories' map, published in London, 1854, the declination is given 4 40' E., which is probably for 1833. Col. Sabine, in the Phil. Trans. Hoyal Society, P. II, \ 84 9, Cont'n IX, gives the declination -3░.8 and- 4░.2, tl1e mean of which is 4░ E. for 1840 (). The latter two determinations show that there is an end to the permanency in the direc~'.on of the needle since the commencement of this century. Sir John Herschel says: "The : whole mass of West Indian property l1as been saYed from the bottomless pit of endless litigation by th e 1nvana и и b"l" и d ec iи и и J a,ma1ca и an d th e surrounamg 'и и l ity of t h e ma(}"netic rnat10n rn arc l 11~elago during the whole of the las~ century, all surveys of property there having been conucted solely by the compass."

bany, at the southern extremity of Hudson's bay, latitude 52░ 22' N., longitude 82░ 38' W., we :find the declination in 1668, according to Halley, 19░ 15' vV. (See Hansteen's Erdmagnetismus, vol. I). Declination in August, 1730, according to Capt. Middleton, 23░ 001 W.; and by the same authority, declination in September, 1774, 17░ 00' \V. Hansteen's map for 1787 gives 14░ \V., and Barlow's map for 1833, (Phil. Trans.) 3░ W. \Ve may here particularl:и notice the maximum which must have taken place between 1668 and 1730. Hence we see that. the curves for these extreme stations agree well in their general character with the -,previous investigation, which is thereby considerably expanded in the direction of the meridian, and it becomes of interest to examine the same in the direction of the parallel, which, however, does does not come within the compass of this paper.

In Des Barres' Atlantic Neptune the magnetic declination for 1775 is given 6░ 30' \V. This is probably the same as the variation of 177G in Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiv, 1838, Yiz: 6░ 30' w. .

The omission of the first observation would give an equally bad +sult.

At these two stations the observations are as yet too few in number to be submitted to a discussion, but this may be done as soon as a new determination can be had. The same may be said of Baltimore, J\ld., ::\lilledgeville, Ga., Savannah, Ga., and New Orleans. New ohservations al the stations Burlington, Nantucket, Al1>any, and probably Chesterfield, иwill render them available for the general discussion. The early minimum at Nantucket is 1uobably as anomalous as the late minimum at Chesterfield. The preceding discussion, with the exception of the result at Nantucket, tends again to a later minimum for stations to the northward of New York and Boston. The best value at present deducible for the epoch of the minimum, including the whole geographical extent, may be assumed to be the general mean of the T's, which is 17!17.2 ▒ 8.0 years.

variation by v = C'+2C" (t - 1830.) Before concluding this paper it was thought proper to refer to a few circumstances closely related to the preceding discussion, and tending to modify conclusions arrived at by others. 1. In the Phil. Trans. Royal Society, vol. xi (abrid.) from 1755 to 1763, we find the paper on the variations which Prof. Hansteen has made use of in the construction of some his charts of isogonic lines in his "Erdmagnctismus." The following is an abstract of a small part of this paper: " On the variation of the magnetic needle, with a set of tables exhibiting the results of upwards of 50,000 observations in six periodic reviews from the year 1700 to the year 1756, and adapted to every fifth degree of latitude and longitude, by W.

Now we know, from the preceding discussion, that the western declination had been decreasing since 1700, reached a maximum annual decrease in 1744, and. continued decreasing down to about 1797, while the above table (see the last two lines in the above table) gives an irw1иease during that interval of time, and is therefore entirely at variance with the observations take~ on land. From this cause some of the geographical representations in the "Erdmagnetismns, based thereon, require considerable correction. . 2. The rate of secular change used for the construction of the lines of equal magnetic d~ch nation on the Atlantic ocean, by Col. Sabine, (Phil. Trans. Royal Society, 1849,) was derived from comparison with the map of declination for l '787, in Prof. Hansteen's work referred to above. This assumes a uniform progressive rate of the secular change, and though appli~ble for other places, St. Helena for instance, (see Col. Sabine's paper, read May 18th, 1854,) is, as we have seen, entirely inadmissible on our Atlsntic coast, and may even give no rate at all ~r the time of the maximum rate. In consequence. of this, the rates deduced in Ta.ble No. '

Trans. of 1849, are much in error, and affect more or less the resulting isogonic lines depending on it. For latitude 40░ N., longitude 75░ W., the table gives an annual Yariation for 1840 O'.O, when it should be+ 5'.7. 3. In Professor Hansteen's paper on the changes in the magnetic inclination in the north temperate zone, (Astronomische Nachricten, Nos. 947, 948, and 954,). the declination is stated to have a retrograde motion, as inferred from Professor Loomis' table in Silliman' s Journal, volume xxxix, and in consequence of which an easterly motion is assigneu to the pole B, (pages 187 and 192, No. 948.) Agtin, on page 282, No. 954, it is saicl that in North America the western declination decreases and the easterly increases; which, however, is not the caRc, as has been seen, for, since the minimum about the beginning of the present century, the reverse lias taken place, the westerly declination having ever since increased, (or the easterly diminished.) Professor H.'s pole B, therefore, appears to have reached its most easterly position about 1797, and l1as ever since been moving to the westward. After the above paper had been submitted to you, under date of July r,, 1855, I recdved your instructions to proceed to the eastern States and determine the three magnetic elements at a, nurnber of station.~. The results of tliis trip, rnade in .August and September, 1855, are herewith appended, (as far as referring to this investigation,) together with the corrected numerical co-~ffecients in the formula of the preceding discussion, resulting from t!te addition of the newly observed declinations. Confining this appendix to the discussion headed b and d, the following impnwements may be inserted in their respective place : To b.-Commencing with the northernmost station, Burlington Vt., we have tho additional observation 9░ 57' .1 west in August, 1855. This observaJiion proves that of 1837 to have been considerably in error ; and as it was principally upon the testimony of this determination that the result for secular change was not in conformity with other stations, its omission and the substitution of my new observation will at once produce the normal shape in the curve expressing the secular variation.

The next station, Albany, New York, presents a peculiarity in its discussion, arising from the want of observations prior to 1811, of which the new observation in August, 1855, viz: 7░ 54'. 7 W., could not free it. This observation was taken at Greenbush, latitude 42░ 37'.5 N., and longitude 73░ 44 1.0 W., and opposite Albany. In order t~ distribute .the observations, as near as may be, over the time el~sed between 181'7 and 1855, the means of the irst two observations, of the four following, and of the two preceding the last, have severally been taken.

The difference between the observed declinations at New York and Sandy Hook, of the same date, makes in the mean, the latter smaller by 0░.43 . .At Philadelphia, the Girard College station was re-occupied in September, 1855, and the declination found 4░ ~1'. 7 W.; the substitution of this obser;Jation in the former discussion gives 2░.52 0.0595 (t - 1830) 0.001232 ( t - 1830)2 D The last observation is represented with a difference of C. - 0. = 0░.32, mostly due to the errors of former observations. e0 becomes ▒ 21'. For Cape May and vicinity the observations are numerous, but many of them very erroneous, as seen in the following collection . . In Des Barres' .Atlantic Neptune we find the declination 6░ W. for 1775 ; this is quite unreh~ble. In the same place the declination between Cape. May and Cape Henlopen for 1775 is given 6░ 45' W. In Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiv, 1838, we find the declination at Lewistown, latitude 38░ 44' N., longitude 75░ 00' W., 0░ 55' '\V. for the year 1795. The Phil. Trans. Royal Society, 1849, give the declination for Cape Henlopen 4░ 421 W. for May, 1841, as determined by Barnett. The following declinations have been determined by the U. S. Coast 8 nrv~y: At Cape May light-house (old) in June 1 1846, 3░ 05'.1 W., latitude 38░ 55'.8 N., long~tude '14░ 57'.6 W.; Dr. J .иLocke, observer. (See annual Report of1854.)

From the remaining three values we deduce the formulaD= 0░.88 0.0532 (t -1830) 0.000809 (t - 1830)2 The minimum occurs in 1797 .1 with the correspo11.ding d = 1░. 00 At Washington, D. C., the results for declination are greatly affected by local attraction, as seen from the following observations. In Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxiv, 1838, we find King's observation oftl!.809, when the declination was 521 W. In the Senate Documents, 2d S1:.ssion 28th Congress, ii844-45, we find the record of the observations made on Capitol Hill, in latitude 38░'>3' N., longitude 77░ 001 W., by I,ieut. J. M. Gilliss, in 1840-41-42, when the declination was 1░ 20' 1211 и 7 W. for 1840-41, and 1░ 231 5611 .9 W. for 1841-42. Tbe following observations are by the U.S. Coast Survey: Causten, occupied by .Assistant G. W. Dean, in June, 1851, gave as result 1░ 11'.3 vV. In September, 1855, I found 1░ 10'.3; in October, 1855, 1░ 02'.0, and at the old magnetic station, a short distance off, 1░ 06'.0. At the Smithsonian Institution grounds, a few feet to the eastward of the Magnetic Observatory, I found in July, 1855, the declination 5░ 44'.2 W., and greatly varying on the ground, and a back sight from near Gilliss' station on Capitol Hill gave for this latter locality 2░ 24' (within 10', the limit of reading off). We have, therefore, for discussion, the ob~ervations of 1809, of 1841.5, and of 1855.5, from which D 0░ .88 0.0412 (t - 1830) 0.001080 (t - 1830)2 и and the following differences :

Thus, for example, the declination at Boston in 1870 will be found by computing the increase for 20 years (the difference of 1870 and 1850) prior to 1850 and adding the same to the declination for 1850; the declination at Boston for 1870 becomes 9░ .81 + 1░ .48 11░ ]8' ,'V.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

APPENDIX No. 50.
Approximate cotidal lines of the Pacific coast of the United States, from observations in the United States Coast Survey, by A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
[Communicated to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, under authority of the Treasury Department.j

The western coast of the United States, between San Diego, California, and Columbia river, extending through 13░ 35' of latitud~ and 6░ 43' of longitude, is divided into three reaches, (Plate No. 49,) the first from San Diego to Point Conception, the second from this point to Care Memlocino, and the third from that cape to Cape Disappointment at the mouth of the Columbia. The first reach, about ~20 miles in extent, is curved, the general trend being about N. 56░ W. The second, about 430 miles. in extent, is, in general, straight, with moderate indentations only, and its trend is about N. 21░ \V. The third, 370 miles in extent, is also nearly straight, trending nearly N. 5░ E. The Rotmdings on the coaRt generally, except in the harbors, have been for the purpose of general reconnaisance, and are not detailed enough to show the configuration of the bottom.
TIDAL OllSER \" ATIONS.

Tidal stations for long series of observations have been established at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, (Columbia river,) and between these, temporary stations at the points and for the periods stated in the annexed general table. Saxton's self-registering gauge has been employed at the permanent statiom generally, and at some of the temporary stations also. The observations are under the directi~n of Lieutenant \'V. P. Trowbridge, U. S. corp~ of Engineers and assistant in the Coast Survey. They were commenced in 1853, and are still in progress. The very intelligent and careful supervision of this officer is a guaranty for the charи acter of the observations. 'l'he observeиs, too, were especially selected by him for their faithfulness and intelligence. The number of results collected is such as to warrant an approximate deter-ruination of the cotidal lines of thiR coast, to lie checked when further results are obtained. This attem1Jt has the advantage of pointing out deficiencies .in the series which otherwise would not so clearly appear. The following table shows the localities of observation and the duration of each series embracecl in this discussion, the name of the observer, and the kind of gauge employed.

The times of high water are referred to the next 1ireceding transit of the moon, tmmit F of :Mr. Lubbock's nomenclature, the epoch having been found to correspond to that transit. The mean interval between the time of the moon's transit and the time of high water, or the establishment corrected for half-monthly inequality for each station, is given in the following table. A correction to carry the results to deep water is applied in the way described in my paper on the cotidal lines of the Atlantic coast of the United States,* giving the establishment used in obtaining the cotidal hour. The latitude and longitude from Greenwich of each tidal station is gfren in the table to the nearest minute. The cotidal hour, found from the establishment corrected for depth and the longitude from Greenwich, is in the last column of the table. It is not necessary to apply a correction for the different transit~, as the difference between the greatest aml least corrections amounts to but five minutes.

COTIDAL HOURS.

The cotida1 hours thus far obtained between San Diego and Cape Disappointment, Columbia river, are contained between 17h. 20m. and 20li. lOm., increasing as a general rule, but with striking exceptional ca1ms, and not regularly in passing northward. The coti<lal hour of 17h. 20m. characterizes the two stations in the southern reach, referred to in the description of the coast; 18h., 19h., 20h., are found on the middle reach, and 20h. characteri~es the northern.
COTIDAL GROUPS .

li~es of the Atlantic, dividing the stations into natural groups and a1)plying Lloyd's mode of
discussion of magnetic lines to them. The northern group of stations, between Cape Disappointment and Cape :Mendocino, (Plate No. 4~,) is composed of Cape Disappointment, Port Orford, and Humboldt. The mean cotidal hour is 19h. 58m. The mean of the longitudes of the stations is 124░ 12', the mean of latitudes 42░ 15'. Calling the differences between the mean longitude and the longitude of each station when reduced to nautical miles a:, the differences between the latitucle of each sta~ion and the mean y, the difference between the cotidal hour at each station and the mean cod 1 ~al hour z, and assuming .I as the sign of the algebraic sum of the numerical quantities obtained for the co-efficients of the equations furnished by each station, we form and solve the equations0

l' y :o In the case before us, M gives for the co-efficient of the longitude 1.2, and N for that of latiThe tangent of the angle which the coticlal line makes with the meridian - N == J\:I 0.05, aml the a11gle is 2░ 52'. The distance in nautical miles perpendicular to the cotidal line corresponding to one minute of establishment, or M2 N2 , is 1.2 miles, and therefore the progress of the tide-wave in one hour, 50 miles. ' This is a velocity less than the depth would indicate to be correct, and from the small differences in the establishment of the stations, this must be an uncertain datum. We shall see, however, that in the next group, where the eRtablishment varies more considerably, this datum is still less probable than the one here obtained. The direction of the line is nearly coincident with that of th~ tre'nd of the coast, the cotidal angle being 2░ 52', and the general trend of the coast differing .but two degrees from it. The cotidal hours calculated from the separate equations are, for Cape Disappointment 20h .. OOm., Port Orford 19h. 44rn., agreeing precisely with the observed ; and for Humboldt 20h. 09rn., diffe1иing but one minute from the observed. The observations bearing upon thi~ group are extending northward; but the difficulties in the way of maintaining the stations are such on a coast inhabited by aborigines, that I do not venture to count upon speedy results. Lieut. Trowbridge is using his best efforts to establish the necessary stations. I precede the discussion of the middle group of stations by a table giving the results corresponding to several different hypotheses, which will in turn be examined. tude =0.006.

Taking the five stations betwee~ Cape Mendocino and Point Conception as one group, we find from the tablfl the angle of the cotidal line with the meridian N. 35░ 30' W., and the mean cotidal hour 18h. 50m., the difference of establishment for one geographical mile perpendicul~r to the cotidal line 4. 7 minutes. As the observations at Santa Cruz were comparatively fc"'. m number, it may be more proper to leave out that station, which will give for the corresponding results to those just stated, N. 36░ 431 W. for the angle of the cotidal line, 18h. 58m. for the mean cotidal hour, and 3. 9 minutes for the cotidal difference in one geographical mile. Omitting Bodega from this group, we obtain for the cotidal angle N. 37░ 261 W., for the mean cotidal hour 18h 50m., and for the change of hour in one mile 3.9 minutes.

Omitting Bodega and San Francisco from the first group, the three southern stations, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, and Santa Cruz, give for the same values N. 33░ 06' vV., и18h. 18m., and 4.9 minutes. The direction of the cotidal line being nearly the same, its denomination only i& changed. The 18-l- hours would give nearly 18! if carried to the cotidal line of the first hy1wthesis 18h. 50m., which is a good agreement. Omissions at the other end of the group produce the same result. Leaving out San Luis Obispo from 1, we obtain for the cotidal angle N. 36░ 30' W.: cotidal hour 18h. 47m.; change per mile 4.4 minutes. The same result is obtained by other omissions in the series. The introduction of Humboldt into a group with Bodega and San Francisco, gives results materially different from those obtained, reducing the cotidal angle to J8o и05 1 , and increa8ing the velocity to 40 miles 1)er hour. The combination of San Pedro with southern stations also changes the results su rnpiclly as to prove that the group is limited to the south of Point Oonce1Jtion. The proof seems complete that these five stations form a single group. Using the determination in which Santa Cruz is omitted, for reasons already stated, we have for the cotidal angle N. 36░ 43' W., which gives an inclination to the general line of the coast of about ten degrees. The line of nineteen hours meets the coast north of Point A.no Nuevo, and between it and Point San Pedro. The comparison of the observed and computed establishments from either of these hypotheses is very satisfactory; from that of the five stations, Santa Cruz alone stands out with a difference greater than nfteen minutes. For the second list of four stations the greatest difference is twelve minutes, and the mean without regard to signs is but six minutes. The velocity of the tide-wave is less satisfactory from the other <la-ta, rising to but fifteen miles per hour. The depth should give a greater velocity, and the comparison with the northern group would indicate a much greater. . In drawing the chart of cotidal lines, I have not followed the velocities strictly. This group, however, lies favorably for the determination of the rate of motion of the tide-wave, and thiJ results of the various .hypotheses in the table are quite consistent with each other in giving a low velocity. The southern group is imperfect, as l1aving but two stations in it. Further observations are required here, and on the islands which separate Santa Barbara sound from the great ocean. Combining San Luis Obispo with San Diego and San Pedro, would require a retrograde wave, showing that they do not belong to the same group. The computations required in these disc~ssions were generally made by Mr. Heaton, of the tidal division, under my imml'.dia.te dnection, or that of Assistant Pourta1es.
CHART OF CO-TIDAL LINES.

.

From this discussion I have drawn a chart of approximate cotidal lines for the coast of Oregon and California (Plate No. 49.) The chart, on a scale of f<Jo ,~<iii ,,- 0 , the same which was used in 1iresenting ths cotidal lines of the .Atlantic coast of the Unitecl States, s110ws the general configuration of the coast. The cotidal hours are marked near the several tidal stations. The straight lines resulting from the discussion of the northern and middle groups are delineated, for the northern group ~! cotidal lines of XIX and hours, and for the middle group of XVII, XVIII, XIX and ~hours . . The curves representing the approximate cotidal lines of 17, 18, 19 and 20 hours, are drawn in dotted lines, the character of the dots differing for the several lines. h The line of 17! hours would follow the coast nearly from San Diego to Point Conception, t en the line of 18 hours nearly to Point Pinos; north of t~is point the lines of 18 and 19 hours

meet the coaBt obliquely at an angle of about ten degrees, the line of 20 hours appearing near Point Arena, and following the coast generally to Cape Disappointment, the receding iiarts having a little later and the projecting parts a little earlier hour. Throughout the extent of coast examined, the cotidal lines are either sensibly parallel to, or make a small angle with, the general directions of the coast. The angle made with the coast between Point Conception and Cape Mttndocino is greater than is general on the long reaches of Atlantic coast. The successive charts of cotidal lines of the Pacific have been tending towards the representation now given, as more reliable observations have been collected. The last chart, in 1848, of the Master of Trinity, (Rev. W. Whewell*) to whom this subject owes so much of its progress, in comparison with that of Rear Admiral Lutke,t or with his own earlier map,t shows this tendency, the inclinations of the lines to the coast being lessened at each step. .

the United States, on the 23d and 25th Decem-

ber, 1854.
[Communicated to the American Association for the Advancement of SciencP, hy A. D. Bache, Superintendent, under authority of the Treasury Department.]

In February, 1855, I received from Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge, of the Corps of Engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey, in charge of the tidal observation on the Pacific coast, a letter calling my attention to the singular curves traced by the self-registering tide-gauge at San Diego, on the 23d and 25th of December, and remarking that the irregularities of the curve could not be produced by disturbances from storms, as the meteorological records for the whole coast showed a continuance at that time of an ordinary state of weather, and the length of the wave was too great to be explained by such action. "There is every reason to presume (he continues) that the effect was caused by a sub-marine earthquake." No shock, however, has been felt at San Francisco. When the record sheet of the self-registering gauge at San Francisco was received, similar irregularities in the curves for the same days were found upon it. The sheet for Astoria pr.esented little or no special irregularity. These were the only self-registering gauges actually 10 operation at this time. Waves of short period would, of course, escape detection by the ordinary hourly or half-hourly observations. About the 20th of June, we received accounts from Japan of a violent earthquake on the 23d of December, the notice of which was more circumstantial than usual, from the daroage.to the Russian frigate Diana, in the port of Simoda, on the island ot: Niphon, from the excessive and rapid rise and fall of the water. . A detailed account of the phenomena of this earthquake, and of the rise and fall of the sea produced by it in different places on the coasts of the Pacific, is much to be desired, a~d I. }Jav~ thought that by the publication of the results obtained by the Coast Survey, the pubhcat1on official reports of the phenomena might be induced. Perhaps even similar observations ~ay have been made, and these registers of the self-acting tide-gauge will show what observations it is desirable to have for comparison.

Thus far we are left to the public prints for the information obtainen,* and the differen~ac counts are quite discrepant where ther give details, and are usually, as intended merely for general information, too vague in the statements to give sati8factory means of comparison. A correspondent of the New York Herald, writing from Shanghae, gives the following notes, stated to be derived from an officer of the frigate Diana: "At 9 a. m., on the 23d of December, weather clear, thermometer 72░, barometer 30░, a severe shock of an earthquake was felt on board the frigate, shaking the ship most severely. This shock lasted full five minutes, and was followed at quick intervals by rapid and severe shocks for thirty minutes." "At 9.30 a. m. the sea was observed washing into the hay in one immense wave, thirty feet high, with awful velocity ; in an instant the town of Simoda was overwhelmed, and swept from its foundations" * * * * "This advance and recession of the water occurred five times * * * By 2h. 30m. p. m. all was quiet." A communication in the same paper, purporting to give an extract from the log-book of the Diana, states that" At a quarter past nine, without any previous indication, the shock of an earthquake, which lasted two or three minutes, causing the vessel to shake very much, was felt both on deck and in the cabin; at ten o'clock a large wave was observed entering the bay. * * * * The rising and falling of the water were very great, the depth varying from less than eight to more than forty feet; and these changes, at interval>; of about five minutes, continued until noon. * * * * * Scarcely had half an hour elapsed when the rising and falling of the water became more violent than before. Between this time and a quarter past two (when the agitation again became much less) the frigate was left four times on her side, and once while thus, laid in only four feet of water '' "Continuing to decrease in violence and frequency by three p. m., the agitation of the water, and the motion of the vessel consequent thereon, were very slow. * * * * At this time afresh west wind was blowing, the barometer stood at 29.87, and the thermometer was 10.50 degrees R. (about 55.63 degrees F.)" The official report of the disaster to the frigate will probably contain further and more precise particulars of the phenomena. Mr. P. W. Graves gives in the Polynesian, a notice, for which Iam indebted to Mr. Meriam, of an extraordinary rise and fall of the waters at Peel's island, one of the Bonin islands, on the 23d of December. The first rise noticed was fifteen feet above high water, followed by a fall which left the reefs entirely bare. The hour when this occurred is not stated. "'l'he tide continued to rise and fall during the day at intervals of fifteen minutes, gradually lessening r;ntil the evening." At Peel's island, the waters rose, on the evening of the 25th of December, to the height of twelve feet t I have not, however, seen any notice of an earthqmike on that day. I present to the Association a copy of the curves traced by the self-registering gauges at the Coast Survey tidal stations at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, on the 23d and 25th of December, 1854, (Plate No. 50.) The curves, representing tides of short period, being traced upon the falling or rising curve
~n<:e reading this paper I have reeeived, through the kindness of Commodore M. C. Perry, a copy of a letter from Captain H. A. Adams, U. s. N., who visited Japan in the steamer l'owhatan, to exchange ratifications of the treaty bet~een Japan and the United States. Captain Adam~ oayo: ииSimoda has suffered dreadfully since your visit there. On the 2.Bd of December there were Revera! shocks 'of earthquake. The sea rose in a wave five fathoms above its usual height, ?Verflowing the town and carrying houses and temples before it in its retreat. When it foll, it left but four feet of water in the harbor: It rose and sunk this way five or six times, covering the shores of the ha.y with the wrecks of boa.ts, ~unks and buildings. Only sixteen houses were left st.-inding in the whole place. The entire coast of Japan seems Lu t~:: s~ffered by this calamity.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

of \jle rcgu1ar tide, their peculiarities are not so readily seen as when shown in the second diagram, (Plate No. 50) where the regular tidal curve is representetl as a horizontal line. The times of the San Diego curve are reduced to San Francisco time. The curve at San Diego presents many minor irregularities, from the motion of the float not having been sufficiently checked to prevent the recording of the waves caused by the wind. Upon a falling tide the crests of these waves will be met earlier, and the hollows later, than upon a horizontal surface, and the intervals from crest to crest, or from hollow to holl<;>w, will be affected by the change of rate of fall. Upon a rising tide the reverse will occur. There can be no doubt that these extraordinary rises and falls of the water at short intervals were produced by the same cause which determined the extraordinary rise and fall in the harbor of Simoda, in Japan, and at Peel's island. The San Francisco curve presents three sets of waves of short inte.rval. The first begins at about 4h. 12m. and ends at Sh. 52m., the interval being 4h. 40m. The second begins at about 9h 35rn. and ends at 13h. 45., the interval being 4h. IOm. The beginning of the third is about 13fh., and its end is not distinctly traceable. The crest of the first large wave of the three sets occurred at the respective times of 4h. 42m., 9h. 54m., and 1471. 17m., giving interYals of 5h. 12m. and 4h. 23m. The average time of oscillation of one of the first set of waves was 35rn., one of the secoml 31Jn., and of one of the third about the same. The average height of the first set of wave~ was .45 of a foot on a tide which fell two feet, of the second .19 of a foot on a tide which rose three feet, of the third somewhat less than .10 of a foot on a tide which fell some seven feet. The phenomena occurred on a day when the diurnal inequality of the tide was very considerable. The greatest fall of the tide during the occurrence of the first set of waves was. 70 of a foot, and the corresponding rise .60 of a foot. In the second the corresponding quantities were .30 of a foot, and in the third .20 of a foot. These waves would not have attracted general attention. There is a general analogy in the sequence of the waves of the three sets which seems to mark them as belonging to a recurrence of the same series of phenomena. In the Diagram No. 3 A, (Plate No. 50,) the heights of the successive waves of the first set at San Francisco are shown by the dots joined by full lines, and of the second by those joined by the fine dotted line. The full faint lines show the heighti; of the first series at San Diego, and the broken faint lines the heights of the second. The heights in hundredths of a foot are marked at the side of the diagram, and those of the successive waves are placed at regular intervals, the waves being numbered from 0 to 7 at the top of the diagram. The height is the mean of the fall from a crest to a hollow, and of the succeeding rise from the same hollow to the next crest. The times of oscillation from one crest to the next succeeding are placed on the same diagram, the times being written at the right hand, ancl the wave being designated at the lower part of the Diagram No. 3 E, Plate No. 50. Tlie full line represents the times of the first series at San Francisco, and the broken li.ne the tir~es of the second. The full and broken faint lines represent the times of the first and second ser:cs at San Diego. The intervals between the times of occurrence of the crests of the successive waves in the first and second series diminish from 5h. lOm. to 4h. 48m. by irregular difference.s. The effect of the rising or falling tide, upon which these waves occur, is of course greater 10 disturbing the heights than the times. The series itself looks like the result of several impulses, not of a single one, the heights rapidly increasing to the third wave, then diminishing- as if the impulse had ceased; then renewed, then ceasing, leaving the oscillation to extinguish itself. Id If we had a good scientific report of the facts as they occurred at Simoda, the subject wou t lose the conjectural character which must otherwise belong to it. Although we have no accou~ of the place where the earthquake ha,d its origin, the violence of its effects in Japan, and .t e diminished effects at Peel's island, show that Japan was cert~inly not far from the seat"of ~ctwn. Five successive waves of considerable height are spoken of as .having occurred at Sillloda,

while by the gauge we trai::e eight, of which seven are of considerable height. The highest wave at Simoda waR ei;timated at thirty feet, at Peel's island at fifteen feet. At San Francisl'o it was .65 foot, and at San Dif'go in the first series .50 foot. At Sa.n Diego, the same three series of waves are distinctly i,;liuwn. The first begins lh. 22m. later than at San Francisco, f'Orrection having been mane for the difference of longitude, and ends Oh. 52m. later. The interval is 30m. less than at San Francisro, the oscillations being rather shorter than at the last named point. The secnnd begins Oh. 54m. later than at San Francisco, and ends 34m. later. The third begins about 54m. later tlrnn at San Francii<co. The average time of oscillation of the first set of waves is 31m .. and of the ~ccun<l 2Hm., being re~pectively 4m. and 2m. less than of the corresponding series at ~an Franciscn. The average height of the first set of wavefi was .1 i f(~)()t lowt>r than at ~an Francil'co, and the second as much higher. This fact, taken with the diff"'rence in the times of oscillation, leads me to suppose the difference in the two series due to interforence, whicl1 j., al~o snggeRted by the position of San Diego, in reference to the islands separating the Santa Barbara sound from the ocean. The general analogy in the succession of heigl1tf' of the mean of the two series, aR shown in Diagram No. 3 C, and in the tinws as shown in D, of the 1mme diai!:ram, is very satisfactory. The difference in the periods of the tide at which the waves occurred would tend tu cause diAcrepancies. The first series occurre1l on a rising tide of four feet, while at San Fnrnci~c11 it was upon a falling tide of two foet. The secon<l began near high water, and wa;; chidiy npon a falling title of 8even feet, while at ~an Francisco it waR upon a rising tide of four feet. The forms of some of the individual waves in the second serief' at San Francii<co and San Diego accord remarkably, as tbo1;c marke<l 1, 3, 4, 5, and fi, when reduced to the horizontal line. The comparison on the curve where the distortion remains, is also verr instructive. The waveR marked 1, 4, 6, and 7, are not unlike in the first and i<econd i;et;; at San Diego. The observations at San Diego confirm, thwn, in general, the inforences derived from thoRe at San Francisco. The register at Astoria throws no new light upon tlte subject. The bar at the entrance of the Columbia river would explain why the oscillations "иere lost or greatly reduced at Astoria, even if they arrived off the entrance of the river. The disturbance is marked on the register, but in an irregular and confused manner. It was also, apparently, preceded by unusual oscillri,tions of the water. After allowing for the very free action of the float of the San Diego gauge, then' appear to have been indications of disturbance previous to the great earthquake shocks, and following them, occurring at intervalll for several days after the 23d of December. The San .Francisco gauge presents similar indications. No special effect appears to have been produced upon the time or heigllt of high or low water by the earthquake, which merely caused series of oscillations upon the great tidal wave. I now proceed to draw from these results some conclusions as to the progrci>s of tlie ocean wave accompanying the earthquake. The latitudes and longitudes of the places referred to are as follows :

REPORT

OF

THE

SUPERINTENDENT

According to one account, the disturbance began at Simoda at 9 a. m., or 22d. 23h. 44.m. Greenwich mean time, and the first great wave half an hour after. The first disturbance at San Francisco was at 23d. 12h. 22m., or 12h. 38m. after that at Simoda, and the first great wave at 23<l. '171. -12m., giving the same interval. The distance and time from this account give for the rate of motion of the wave 338 miles per hour, or G.O miles per minute. The ~econcl account would give for the time of transmission 12h. 13m., and for the rate of motion ~;70 miles per hour, or 6. ~ miles pPr minute. The San Diego observations give for the time of transm.isRion of the wave from Simoda' to San Diego J:Jh. :>Om. by the first account, which, combined "иith the distance, gives 355 miles per hour, or, sensibly, the same result as derived from the beginning at San Francisco. The first great wave would give identically the same result. :From the results obtained, we may determine the mean depth of the Pacific ocean in the 11ath of the earthquake waves. \Ve have found. for the rate of motion from G.O to G.2 miles per minute, and for the duration of an oscillation 35 minutes at San Francisco, and 31 at San Diego. 'rhi8 would give for the length of the wave on the San Francisco path 210 miles to 217 miles; and on the San Dic>_;o vath, 18G to 192 miles. A wave of 210 miles in length would move with a velocity of 6.0 miles per minnte in a deptl1 of 2,2:30 fathormi, (Airr, Tides and Waves, Encyc. J\Ietrop., p. 291, T11b]e II;) one of 217 miieH, with a Yelocity of !J.2 miles per minute in a depth of 2,500 fathoms. The corresponding depth on the San Diego path is 2,100 fathoms. The disturbance of the 23th of Decem her presents at San Francisco three sets of waves of 5even each, and at San Diego one set of seven, agreeing in their general features with those at San 'Francisco; and then a set of seventeen, in which, at first, intermediate waves seem to be wanting at San Francisco, or which have no analogous oscillations there. The crests of the first set occurred at a mean about 17 minutes earlier at San Diego than at San J<'rancisco; the }1eights on t11e average were nearly the same, being .39 foot at San Diego, and .44 foot at San :Francisco, and the time of oscillation at the two Jllaces the same, namely, 41m. The origin of the disturbance was probably nearer to San Diego than to San Francisco.

APPE.NDIX No. 52.

Notice of the tidal observations made on the coast of the Dnited States on the Gulf ef 1Uexico, and type curves at the several stations, showing their decomposition into tlw curves of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides; by A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
fC"mmunicated to the AmC'rican Association for the Advancement of Sdence, under authority of the Treasury Department.]
ABSTRACT.

'rhe stations are eighteen in .number. At four, hourly observations were made for one year or more, and at the remainder for not less than two lunations, and generally for more. The stations at Cape .Florida, Indian key, Key West, and Tortugas, were intended to trace the tidewave through the Florida channel; those at Egmont key, Tampa, Cedar keys, and St. Mark's, to trace it along the western coast of Florida; at St. George's, Pensacola, Fort Morgan, Cat :island, and East Bayou, (entrance to the Mississippi,) to trace it along the south coas~ of Floriclii, Alabama, Mississippi, and part of Louisiana ; at East Bayou, Derniere Isle, Calcasieu, Bolivar Point, and Galveston, Aransas, and Brazos Santiago, for the coast of Louisiana and Texas. The observations were chiefly made by Mr. Gustavus Wiirdcmann, with different assistants. At a. few stations they were made by Corporal Thompson, of the engineers, Mr. Basset, }fr. Tansill, and Mr. Muhr. The !"eduction! were made in the. tidal division of the Coast Survey by

OF TllE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY и

347

.Assistant Pourtales, Mr. Gordon, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Heaton, and others. The methods used were those pointed out in my 1ireYions papers to the Association; the decomposition being in some cases made graphically, and at a part of the stations, where the semi-diurnal wave i:< considerable, the ~rdiuary method of working being used, as well as those considered peculiarly awlicable to these tides. As it would be tedious to present the results of these elaborate discussions in detail, whell the cotidal lines are introduced, I l1ave t bought it best briefly to refer now to the types of different tides, and to present to the Association the diagrams for the several stations, showing;, upon a uniform scale, the normal curves and their decompositions into the diurnal and semi-diunrnl waves.

APPENDIX No.
Tide tables, fmи tlte use of navigators; preparedfJ"Um the Coast S1trvey obse1иvations by A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
[l'rl.'pare<l hy :rntl1ority of the Treasury Ikpartmcnt, for l'. an<l G. 1\'. Illunt, :Xcиw York]

The following tables will enal)le na,иigators to ascertain the time and ii.eight of high anrl low water in some of the priucipuJ ports of tlie Unite<l States. The results are approximate, tlie

olJRerrntions being still in progress, but they may safel:o-' be used for practical purposes. The number of places of o1iservation, and the time during which man,1-и of thew luwe bceu rnaU.e, an' Rtl':vlily 011 the increase aR thP coast smTey advances. 'l'he tides of the coast of the Unite<l f'tates, on the ..Atlantic, Gnlf of Mexico, arnl Pacific, arc of three different classes. Those of the .Atlantic arc of the moHt ordinary type, ebbing aml flowing twice in twenty-four hours, and having but moderate differences in heig11t between the two successive high waters, or low waters ; one occurring before noon, and the otlier after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during twenty-four hours ; but the morni111{ and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height-so much so, that at. certain periocls a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide, may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The iutcrvalt>, too, between successinи high and successive low watern ma_r be very uneriual. The tides of ports in the Gulf of Mexico west of Cape St. George, ebh and flow, aFI a rule, but once in twenty-four hours, or are single-day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in the twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise ancl fall increases : there are two tides, as a rule, during the twenty-four hours, and the daily inequality, referred to in the Pncific tides, is large. 'rhese peculiarities require a ditforent way of treating the cases, and in some of them separate
tables.

I prop.ose to enable the navigator to :find, from the ~autical Almanac and the following t~b!eB, the time and height of high and low water at any date within the onlinary range of <lifference producell by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divest the inatter of unfamiliar technical expressions as far as practicable, though, for shortness' sake, some such terms may be employed after defining them. The discussion of the Gulf tides has not been c_arried so far as to enable me to present the reiml b:> in as definite a form as the others. As is well known the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's tra~sit) and the tim~ of high water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval varies between moderate limits wliich can be assi<"ned. The interval at full and change of thu ~1000 is known as the establish~ent of the port, a~d is ordinarily marked on the charts. .As it 18 not genera11y the average of the иintervals during a mont ll ' s t1 "cl e, I"t JS и a l ess convemen и tи an d 1 t~Bs accurate quantity for the use of the navigator than the average interval which is used on e Coast Survey charts, and is sometimes called the '' mean '' or '' corrected establishment.''*
"This term was introduced by the Rev. Jllr, Whewell, who has done so much for the investigation of the la.ws of the tides.

REPORT

OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT

The fol1owing table gives the principal tidal q nantities for tlrn <lifferent ports named in the :first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table giveH the nwan interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and the time of high water next after the transit; the fourtl1, the difference between the greatest and least interval, occurring in different parts of the rnuntl1, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this colurnn will show how important it is to determine these changes in many of the ports where they amount to more than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes, for the average interval. The fifth, sixth, and .~eventh cDlumn~ refer to the heigl1t of the tide. The fifth giws in feet the average rise and fall, or avernge difference between high and low water. The sixth g-iY'ci the greatest differeuce, commonl,Y known aH the rise and fa.11 of spring tides; and the Hel'enth t1Hи lea8t difference, known as the rise and fall of the neap tides. The average duration of the flood, nr rising tille, is gil'en in the eighth column; of the ehh or fa.lling title, in the ninth; n.nd of the period dnring which the tide neither ri~es nor fall.~, <1r the "stand,'' in the tcrith. 'l'he durcttiun of flood is measured from the middle of the stand <tt low water to the rni<lcllc of thr stand at high water, RO that the whole duration from one high water to the next, <иr 'from one lnw water to the 11cxt, should Le gil'cn by the sum of numbers in the eigl1th and ninth columns. At most of these 11~cef:\ given in the list, a mark of reforence lias been estahfo1he1l for the height of tl1e tide. I have omitted the dei<cription of these nmrks. (except in special loc<tlitiei, designated and referred to iu a note,) as of no particular intenиst in tl1is connexion.

water is to be taken from the Almanac, and the mean establishment being added, t11e time of high water reimlts. Thus: Example I.-lt is required to find the time of high water at New York on the 5th of Kovember, 18;)4. The American Almanac gives Oh. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for New York, from Table I, column:~, is 8h. 13m., which, as the transit was at Oli., is roughly the time of high water. The moon being full, the height is that of spring tides of column 6, namely, 5.4 feet. If the sound in gs on the chart are re<lnced to spring tides, 5.4 feet is to be added to then; to give the depth at high water. If the sounJings are reduced to mean low water, the rise and foll for mean tides being 1.1 foot less than for springs, the rise or increase of depth will be half of this, or 0.6 of !lffoot less than 5.4 feet, which is 4.8 feet, or nearly 4 feet 10 inches. Example IL-Required the time of high water at Doston on the 23<l of January, 18;")1. From the American Almanac we finJ tl1e time o~и the moon's southing, or transit, on that clay, 5h. 18m. a. m., a.nu from Table l the mean interval at Boston tlry doek is llh. 27m. We have then 5h. 18m. time of transit; to which add 11 27 mean interval from Table I.

45 time of high water, or 4h. 45rn. p. m.

If the Greenwich Nautical Alma nae is used, add 2m. to the time of tramiit of Greenwich for every hour of west longitude, and its proportional part fi)r less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half hour which may be over any number of hours, as the correction for less than this would be leAs than one minute, and need not be taken into account. Thus Boston is 4Ti. ▒4111. W. of Greenwich. The correction to he ap1ilietl to the time of transit of the moon at Greenwich is, for the four hours, eight minutes, and for 44m. one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is 5h. 09m. ; to which aJd nine minutes, the correction just found gives Gh. lSm., as before ascertained from the American Almanac. In using the United States Nautical Almanac, in the astronomical part of which the transits of the moon are given for the meridian of vVashington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the Atlantic coast, be neglected. To find the time of the next following low water, add from Table I the duration of ebb tide; this gives 4h. 45m. p. m., time of high water. fi 13 duration of ebb tide, from Table I.
10 58 p. Ill. By subtracting the duration of flood tide, we obtain the time of the preceding low water, lOh. 32m. a. m., recollecting that 4h. 45m. p. m. is the same as 16lt. 45m. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide corresponding to the transit of 5h. will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and fall, obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. . The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood, from Table I, thus: 10/i. 58m. p. m., time of low water 23d of January. 6 13 duration of flood from Table I. 8um 17 11 or i)h. llm. a. m. on the 24th of January.
Or, having found the time of high water, the time of the next following high water may. b~ found by adding the duration of ftood and of ebb together, and their sum to the time of hig water fountl. Thus : 6h. 13m., duration of ebb tide from rrable I. 5 rn duration of flood.

In these, the variations in the interval between the moon's transit and high water are shown for some of the principal ports contained in Table I. These variations of interval depend upon the age of the moon, and, as they go through their values in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table extends from Oh. 1)f tramiit, midnight of the calendar day, or full of the moon, to 11~ hours. The numbers for "change" of the moon correspond to those for 0 hours, and for 13 hours (or 1 p. m. of the calendar day) to 1 hour, anJ so on, up tv 23 hours. The ports for which the numbers are given are designated by the heading of the columns. The mean interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two da.ys afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. At Key \Vest it occurs more nearly at full and change, aurl at San Francisco still more nearly. The same remark applies to th~ heights; spring tides occur about two days aft.er the full and change of the moon, and neaps two dayR after the first and last quarter. The use of this table of nearer approximation is quite tts simple as that of Table I. Rule to find the time of high water.-Look in the Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time will be found the number to be added to the time of transit. Example UL-Required the time of high water at New York, October 1, 1856. Using the United States Nautical Almanac, we find the time of moon's transit lh. 24m., astronomical l'eckoning, or lh. 24m. p. m., calendar time_ From Table II, we have under the heading of New York, for lh. 30m., (the nearest number to lh. 24m. in the table,) Sh. lOm. Thus to lh. 24m., time of moon's transit, Aud 8 10 interval found from Table ll. The sum,~ p. m., is the time of high wa"ter on the 1st of October, 1856.

If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide would have belonged to October and we mqst have gone ha.ck to the transit of the day before and computed with it, to obtain the tide for October 1st. Rule to find the height of high water.-Enter Table III, column 1, with the time of moon's transit. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked .A, will be found the rise and fall corresponding to the time of transit; in column B, the number to be added to soundings on the chart, where the soundings are given for mean low water; in column C, the number to be added to charts of which the soundings are given for low water, spring tides. In the foregoing example, (lII) the time of transit being between 1 and 2 hours, we find, from Table III, the rise an<l. fall of the tide on the 1st October, 1856, between 4.9 and 4. '1 ; the nurnи ber to be added to soundings given for mean low water 4.5 feet, (column B,) and for low water spring tides, (column C,) 4.9 feet. и . Having found the time of high water, that of low water may be obtained nearly by adding

the duration of the ebb from column 9, Table I. The time of the next preceding low water may be found by subtracting the duration of floocl from C<иlumn 8, Table I. 'l'hc timl' of the next following high water may l>e found by adding the duration of both flood and elib, and (1f the next preceding high water, by su11tracting the r-;ame dnrntiou of the whole tide. Example IV.-To find the next high "~ater following t1rnt of Ex,irnple III. 1st. By united duration of flood and ebb. The duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New York, is 6h. Om.; and of eub, from column 9, is 6h. 25m. ; the sum is 12h. 25m. To 9h. 34m. p. m., October 1, the time of high water found, Add 12 25 duration of flood and ebb. Sum, 21 49, or 9h. 59m. a. m. of October 2, the time vf the next high water.
TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

On tl1e Pacific coast there is, as a general rule, one large and one small title during each day, tl1e heights of two succesRive high waters occurring oue a. m. and the other p. rn. of the same twenty-four hours, and the intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. These inet1ualities depend upon the moon's declination. \Yhen the moon's declination is nothing, they disappear, and when it iR the greatest. eit11er north or south, they are greatest. The inequalitieR for low water are not the same as for high, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same times. When the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two high tides of tlrn twenty-four hours occurs at San Francisco about eleven and a half hon rs after the moon's snnthing, (tram:it;) and when the declination is south, the lowest of the two high tides occurs about this interval. The lowest of the two low waters of the day, is the one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of these tides will probalJly appear more plainly from the annexed diagrams. In them the height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day are at the top. At XII noon, for example, the tideJr I\ gauge marked 6.7 feet. Joining all the heights observed in FT I u lV \IT'и"' '' v:OURS the twenty-four hours, we have a curve like that marked in w1sJ r I 7 the figure. The two high waters are a and c, and the two ! G low waters band d. If a is the high water, which occurs '5 cl!... ' \ about twelve hours after the transit of the moon, when the 4 "'-,..[/ declination is south, the ebb a bis quite small, and the high 1 3 water a is much lower than the next high water c. If the 2 moon's declination is north, it is the large high water a of i 1 the second diagram, which occurs next after the transit, and 0 '-/ about twelve hours from it. d I Tablt1s IV and V give the number to be added to the time al DIA~ANl2 of moon's transit, to find the time of high water almost as ) r~adily as in the former case. It is one of double entry, the time of transit being, as before, placed in the first column. The number of days from the day at which the moon has :; had the greatest declination, are arranged at the top of the 4 ) table. EnterinO" the first column with the time of transit, d 3 u t'l 0 n 1 we come under the column containing the days from the ~ ~reatest declination, we find the number to be added to the j time of transit to give the time of high water. If the moon's y J 0 declination is south, Table IV is to be u~ed ; if north, Table V и 45

If we disregard the daily inequality, the column headed San Francisco, in Table II, would give us,. as in the examples on the Atlantic coast, the means of determining the time of high water. '\Vith this, the column for seven days in the present table agrees, as in between six and seven days from the maximum the declination becomes nothing, and the diurnal inequality also nothing. Example V.-Required the time of high water at Rincon Point, San Francisco, California, on the 7th of February, 1853. 1st. The time of the moon's transit at Greenwich, from the ~autical Almanac, is 11/i. 41m.; : he longitude of San Francisco Sh. lOrn. ; requiring a correction (seep. 350) of 16m. to the time of transit for San Francisco, which is thus found to be llh. 51m. 2d. The moon's declination is south, and at the time of transit about two days from the greatest. Entering Table IV, we find 12h. (or Oh.) of transit, the nearest number to llh. 57m., which the table gives; and following the line horizontally until we come to two days from the greatest declination, we find 13h. 3m. To llh. 57rn. timeoftransitofmoon, February 7, San Francisco, Add 13 3 from column Oh. transit, and two days from greatest declination. The sum is 250 or 1li. Om., February 8, is the time of high water, corresponcling to the transit which we took of February 1. Ifwe desire the tide of February 7, we must go back to the moon's transit of the 6th. The example was purposely assumed to show this case. 11li. 1m. time of transit February 6, 1853. 13 20 number for llh. transit, and one day from greatest declination. Sum 24 21 time of high water Oh. 2lm. a. m., February 7.

The height of high 1.Qttter.-The height of high water is obtained in a similar manner, by the use of Tables VI and VII, entering these in the same way with the time of transit and days from the greatest declination. Tal>le VI is for south declination, and Table VII for north.

OF THE

UNITED

STATES. COAST

SURVEY.

Example VIL-Thus in Exam11le VI, the high water of February 'Ith was found to lie 3.1 feet above mean low water. The <leclination being south, Diagram I applies, ancl this high water is the small one. To obtain the fall of the next low water, or small low water, we enter Table IX with Oh. of moon's transit, and two <lays from greatest declination in the first part of the table, and find 1. 7 feet, which will be the difference in height of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit and day in the Sl,cun<l. part, we find 3.3 foet, which is the rise of the large high water a Love the small low water; the difference between 1.7 foot and 3.5 feet, or 1.8 foot, is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to see how, in this way, the soundings of a cliart can he reuuced to what they woulll be approximately at all the successive high and low waters. A similar set of talJles is in preparation for Key \Vest, and some of the other ports on the Gulf of )foxico, 1v here the tides arc of the same character. The tidal observations now in progress on the Pacific will give the means of extending the tables to all the principal ports there.
TIDES OF TUE Gl:LF OF J\IE.S.ICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida round to St. George's island, near Cape Sau Blas, the tides are of the ordinary kind, but with a large daily inequality, and the data are inserted in the general Tables I and II. From St. George's island, Apalachicola entrance, to Derniere Isle, the tides are usually of the single-day class, ebbing ancl flowing hut once in twenty-four (lunar) hours. At Calcasieu entrance the double tides re-appear, and, except for some days ahout tbc period of the moon'R greatest declination, the tides arc double at Galvestun, Texas. At Aransas and Brazos Santiago the single-day tides arc as perfectly w<,11 marked as at St. George's, Pensacola, Fort Morgan, Cat island, anrl the monthR of the lliississippi. The observations on the Gulf coast are nearly completed, lmt the discnRsions lmve not been carried to the 1mint necessary to present the results in a simple form. For the present, therefore, I merely give a table, (Table X ,) showing the mean rise and fall at the several ports between St. George's island and the Brazos Santiago; the greatest rise and fall which occur when the moon's declination is greatest, and the least, when the moon's declination is very small or nothing. For some three to five days, about the time when the moon's declination is nothing, there. are generally two tides at all these places in the twenty-four hours, the rise and fall being quite small. The highest high, and lowest low waters, occur when the greatest declination of the moon hap11ens at full or change; the ]east tides when the moon's declination is nothing at the first or last quarter . . The rise and fall being so small, the times and heights are both much intiuencedи by the winds, and are thus often rendered quite irregular.

TO DETER.i.'1:INE THE InSE AND FALL OF THE TIDE FOR ANY GIVEN TIME FROl\f IDGH OR LOW WATEU.

It is sometimes desirable to know how far the tide will rise in a given time from low water, or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which has elapsed from low or high water, Ly knowing the rise or fall of the tide in the interval. If the proportion of the rise and fall in a given time were the same in the different ports, this would easily be shown in a single table, giving the proportional rise and fall, which by referring to Table I, showing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give the rise and fall in feet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the same in different ports, nor in the same ports for tides of different heights. The following, Table XI, shows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour, for New York and for Old Point Comfort, and for spring and neap tides at each place. Units express the total rise of high water above low water, and the figures opposite to each half hour denote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example, at New York, three hours after high water, a spring tide has fallen, six-tenths (sixty hundredths) of the whole fall. Suppose the whole rise and fall of that day to be 5.4 feet, (Table I,) then three hours after high water the tide will have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet three inches nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three feet three inches, we may know that high water has passed about three hours.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

APPENDIX No. 53.
Letter from Profer;sor J. W. Railey, U. S. Jl,Jilitary Academy, at TVest Point, relative to !hr characteristics dcdueiblc Jrorn specimens of bottom, brought up in sounding the Florida section of the Gulf Stream. \VEST PoINT, N. Y., October 16, 18:i5. DEAR Sm: As it will still require a long time to complete the microscopic examination of the soundings sent to me from the Coast Survey Office, I can at present only make a bri'ef statement of some of the most striking and important facts afforded hy the study of the Gulf Stream soundings, near Key Biscayne, Florida. The soundings, which vary in depth from 14 7 fathoms to 205 fathoms, agree in their general characters, as well as in their organic contents; they are light greenish grey mud, composed chiefly of Foraminifera, Diatoms, Polycistins, and Geolites, in a 11rofusion hitherto unrivalled in any known deposite of the present oceans, and only surpassed in the fossil state by the polycistinous strata of the island of Barbadoes. The Foramin[fera compose the largest parts of these muds) and among them I found considerable numbers of the Textilaria Americana, lVIarginulina Bachei, and other forms previously noticed in the soundings off Cape Henlopen.* Mingled with tlrnse were many forms not yet noticed in tlrn northern soundings, and particularly a considerable number of species of the group Agathistegues, (Plicatilia of Ehrenberg). These are believed to live only in very moderate depths near shore, but in these soundings they are as abundant at 205 fathoms as in the shallower soundings, rendering it probable that they have been transported from their natural haunts. The silicions shells of Diatoms arc found in large nurn bers in the residue left after the calcareous Foraminifera have been dissolved by means of acids. '.rhe number of known species which are thus found is very great, and there is also present a considerable number of entirely new and very interesting genera, as well as species of this group. The presence of numerous Diatoms, whose well known habitat' is upon Algae, &c., in quite shallow water, proves that a transporting action has taken place, either by currents or by means of animals, which have swallowed these shells with their food. It is probable that both these modes of transportation have been employed in forming the deposite at the bottom of the Gulf Stream. The Polycistinea, with their beautiful silicious frame-works, are remarkably abundant in these soundings. Besides the species which have been noticed by Ehrenberg and myself, in the deep soundings of the Atlantic, the deposites off Key Biscayne contain a great number of quite novel and beautiful forms. Many of these resemble the fossil species occurring so abundantly at Barbadoes; but few of them, however, if any, are identical. The fact that immense deposites, abounding in iiolycistinous forms, are now forming near the coast of .Florida, and at quite modera:e depths, shows that Ehrenberg's supposition that Barbadoes was raised from a very deep sea, 18 not necessarily correct. The Geolitharia, including sponge spicules, gemmules, and various organic silicious bodies of unknown nature, also occur abundantly in these soundings. The inorganic portion of the soundings is chiefly quartz sand, in fine grains, and its proportion is quite small. 1 am now engaged in describing and figuring the new forms above alluded to, and I hope soon to have a corniiderable number of the most interestin<Y Polycistinea and Diatomacere ready for publication. I hope, also, to be able to complete, at ~he same time, a general comparison oftlie soundings of the Gulf Stream and Atlantic ocean, at different localities. J. W. DAILEY". Yours, very respectfully, Prof. A. D. BAcuE, Superintendent ef the Coast Survey.

lJescription of tripod and scoffold constructed and used by jfasistant C. 0. Boutelle, at the stations of the primary triangulation in Section V. (Sketch No. 52.)
COAST S1rnVEY OFFICE, December 5, 1855. Srn: Accompanying this report are drawings of the tripod and scaffold used by me at the primary stations in Section V. The country over which the primary triangulation in Section V extends is fifl.t. The primary sides average about ten miles in length. They pass over water, marsh, and cultivated land, a~d through forest-trees. A venues through woods, varying in length from narrow bdts of fifty or sixty feet in width to four or five miles in unbroken extent of forest growth, occur on some of them. и The stratum of air lying near the surface of the ground is so disturbed by exhalations and by inequalities of temperature and den11ity, as to render accurate or frequent observations through it impossible. It has been found necessary to elevate the theodolite about forty-five feet at each primary station to overcome this radical difficulty. Since I bave been in charge of the primary triangulation in Section V, I have tried various forms of obseHing tripods, and have found that shown in fi.crure 1, Sketch No. 52,и to possess advantages over all others 0 which I have ~The form of the tripod is a.n equilateral triangular pyramid, having a height of forty-three feet, the base of which is a triangle inscribed in the periphery of a circle of eight feet radius from the station point.

diag01.ral braces of the lower tier are of 3 X 2 inch scantling; the rest of the braces being of 3 X 1 inch scantling. Three interior braces, each 3 X 4 inches and twenty feet long, are bolted to each upright and come to the ground midway between the opposite legs of the tripod. The dimensions of the three legs of the tripod are of 6 X 6 inch yellow-pine joists. They meet at the top at a voi11t in the vertical of the station point beneath. Here they are surmountrd by a cap-block, fourteen inches square, and not less than six inches thick, secured to each upright by tree-nails. In the centre of the cap-block and top of the tripod is mortised a hole four inches square, in wl1ich is placed a signal-pole from sixteen to twenty foet long, painted in black and white bands and surmounted by a small tin signal. 'fhe pole where it enters the mortise in the cap-ulock is three inches square, to allow for accurate adjustment over the station point by means of the " Temple" sectors, or portable transit instruments, which, from first to last during the erection of the tripod, and in the use of it afterwards, are const:otntly used to' watch and detect any error in adjustment of tripod, signal or theodolite. The uprights of the surrounding scaffold are 5 X 5 inch yellow-pine joists, and are as high above the ground as the top of the cap-block. Each face has two sets of horizontal braces at the heights of twenty and forty feet respectively. These braces and the sleepers of the floor are of 3 X 4 inch scantling, and are "halved in." Four diagonal braces of 2 X 2 inch scantling are bolted on each face. A railing is also bolted to the top of the uprights. Access is had to the top by two permanent ladders, each having a vertical height of twenty feet. When a heliotroper is stationed at one of these tripods, a board nailed across the railing of the scaffold furnishes a stand, and the Rignal-pole is undisturbed. When the station is occupied for observing, the pole is lifted out and the topи of a Garn bey stand is screwed to the cap-block, its centre being brought carefully over the station point below. The instrument, resting in the Y's of the stand, is in the axis of the station. In erecting one of these tripods, I first set up a single stick, about thirty feet long, secured by four rope guys, with a double-fall tackle as a derrick. Three holes are then dug two and a lialf feet deep, at equal dil:'!tances from each other and from the station point. Plank are laid in the bottom of each hole for a bearing, and care is taken to have them in the same horizontal plane. The three legs of the tripod are each cut to the length of 46.3 feet, which gives them a vertical height of forty-three feet when in position. The tops of them are also cut, as showu in figures 3 and 4, Sketch No. 52, to allow them to meet when Ret up. The bottoms are al~o fiawed to the Rame level as the top (1.0f. inch in (i inches) to allow them to 1иest firmly upon the level bearings in the bottoms of the holes. A double rope guy is secured to each upright, about ten feet below the top, and they are hoisted singly to their positions and secured from. falling by the guys. A nail is driven in the top of each upright before raising at the angle ot 120░, wl1cre.41ll three should meet when in position. The portable transits are then set up and levelled at some two hu'n<lred feet distance from the station 1ioint and nearly at right-an~les with each other, and the cross-hairs brought upon the station point. The telescopes, movrng in a vertical plane, are then raised until the top of the tripod is seen, and each nail is successively brought to the intersection of the cross-hairs of each instrument, by working the g~Y~ which secure the uprights. vVheu the three nails meet in the intersection of two vertica 11lanes pasRing through the station point and at right-angles to each other, the holes at the ?as~ are Бlled up, and the lower tier of braces bolted on. The trussing of each face of the trip~ to the top next proceeds until completed, when the guys and derrick are taken down and t e tackle is secured to the top of the tripod, which serves as a derrick for raising the scaffold. The holes for the uprights of the scaffold are then dug, forming a square eighteen feet upo~ a side, and each 12. 72 feet from the station point. The relation of the f~t of the sca1fo~d an f tripod to each other and to the station pGint is shown in figure 2, Sketch No. 52.

raiRed sufficiently high to bring the feet into the holes dng to receive them. Ternporarr diagonal pieces are nailed to each upright, and the top is pressed outward from the tripod until each upright is 6.3G feet from the centre of the top of the tripod, to which it is temporarily secure<l until the other twu sides of the scaffold are framed iu their 11rnper places and the ladders and floor laid. No part of' tlie scaifuld is allowed tn touch the tripml when it is completed. The cap-block is then fitted to its place, sig-nal en~cted. and the whole strnctnn~ whitewashed. The time necessary for corn1)leting the whole work Yarics fro111 t 11 rep to fi \'1i days, according to the convenience of acces8 to the position cho~e11. The dimensions given are for the height found most convenient in my own work. Of course they may be increased or diminished for largn or smaller tripods, mere]~' preserving the proportions. This kind of tripod is very firm. It does not vibrate, and has less jar than any other I have tried. It can be used on windy days, which is a great point gaine<l, since our best seeing often occurs when the wind is high. ltA great stiffness is due to itR form and the small surface exposed to the action of the wind. The superficial area of each face is ahont 315 Rrpiare foet, while the llolid surface exposed to the action of the wind is hut twenty-five square feet. A model of this scaffold aml tripod, on a Reale of two foet to an inch, was deposited in the office in November, 1853. From it I~ieutenant J. C. Tidball, U. S. Army, in charge of the drawing division, has reduced the very accurate and elegant sketch of the tripod, No. 52. I hope that it may be of service in helping us to overcome the difficulties encountered in the rnuthern sections of our work. Yours respectfully,

Letter of A8sistant John Farley, communicating descripi'ion and drawing of a convenient signal for observing on secondary stations. (Sketch No. 52.)
NEWPORT, RHODE ISLAND,

July 24, 1855.

DEAR SIR: The following is a brief description of a signal which I have been cornpell'ld to adopt in lieu of the old method of elevating the pole upon a tripod for secondary stations ; and the main recommendation I shall give is in the simple fact, that every signal established upon this plan remains now as firm and exact as when first planted, while the others are constantly being affected by storms or other causce . . The plan is very simple and economical, consisting of four stanchions of 3 X 4 inch white Pine scantling, and about seven feet long, sawed at the upper end at an angle of nearly twenty degrees, so that the bevelled side may rest against and support the irnle; the whole being confine~ within about six inches of the top of the stanchions by a strong iron hoop from eight to ten inches diameter. In ?rder to give additional strength and permanency, four cross-ties are <10 nailed across from opposite stanchions as to form a box four inches square, which serves tl1e double purpose of protecting the stone and affording a secure footing for the signal-pole. It is believed that the se~erest storm could thus obtain no hold upon it, and nothing short of force could uproot it, w en well wedged and hooped. The pole should be so made as to fit evenly and well in the ;perture between the stanchions, and gradually be rounded off from thence towards th~ top. he cross-ties should be well secured by nails to the stanchions.

364

REPORT

O,._ THE

SUPERINTENDENT

Great care is necessary in setting this signal; but when once established, and the ground well settled and rammed, the combination possesses great strength and immobility as an observing stand for the theodolite. On approaching a station the wedges and hoop are loosened, the Jiole drawn out, and a cap fitting well to the aperture is inserte<l in its place; any slight motion is easily corrected by wedging. The cross-ties are sawed half and half, so as to let into each other, as shown by the diagram, (Sketch No. 52.) , A side and perspective view is alFm there i:i;iven, together with the necessary dimensions. The iron hoops are required to be strong and substantial, and, although fitting on a rectangular shape, the round hoop is found to be the best. The depth for sinking the stanchions depends upon the height of the ol1Rerver, and in order to irrnure greater permanency it would be advisable to char the foot of the stanchion, or immerse it in asphaltum or tar to prevent rotting below the surface. Still greater strength may he insured by burying horizontal pieces, and spiking them to the lower part of the stanchions. J. FARLEY, Assistant Coastи Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S.

The success of the experiment induced me to place it in the midst of the breakers on Dog Island bar in the same inlet, as a signal to be used in my hydrographic work: and I leave it there to serve as a beacon for vessels naYigating Mississippi sound, as tlie bar is close upon the southern side of the deep channel running alon~ to the northward of ~hip and Horn islands.

DESCRIPTION OF TRIPOD.

1)baene 11.t'v "'tW-. .....

T11e legs are eacb made of two lengths ot' wronght-iron gas-pipe, ten feet long-the lower piece of two inches and a half diameter, the upper a size smaller--coupled together by the screw coupling used in gas fitting, making them as strong as if one piece; an iron ring one inch in diameter, through three eye-bolts of four or five incheB in length, which are inserted into the upper end of th.e leg, and wedged in or confined by a" set screw," keeps them together at the head. They are spread, and kept in that position by an open triangle of four-inch scantling, with scores at the outside of the angles which receive the legs, and these are secured to it by straps of hoop-iron. The triangle is also a" step" for the signal-staff, which is inserted through the ring connecting the heads of the tripod legs. The pole bears a revolving ball of three foet diameter, made of five hogslrnad-hoops, with white and black cotton cloth or camиass stretched ov 1)r the alternate vertical halves of the hoops, so as to keep the ball revolving horizontally, and not presenting too much resistance to the wind. Four of the hoops are placed transversely to each other in pairs, kept in position by a single hoop surrounding them horizontally, and in the upper and lower square places made by their intersection are placed two square pieces of board or sheet iron, with holes large enough to receiYe the staff upon which it is to revolve. A. cap or "truck" is nailed or bolted on the staff over all, to prevent the ball being blown off. The black and white canvass is stretched over the alternate vertical halves of the hoops, reaching nearly to. the axis of the ball, to serve as wings to revolve it and to flash black and w bite. These w~ngs may be made of tin, and contrived to work on pivots like wings of a horizontal wind~ill, heing becalmed or "in the wind" on one side of the ball, while "filled" on the opposite ~nae, thereby offering less resistance to strong winds. ~o make it more conspicuous while observing angles upon it, the tripod was wrapped with strips of cheap white cotton, spirally from the top down to within a third of its height, leaving a 13Pace of -One foot between the turns.

Ja.nuary 11, 1855. DEAR Sm: The enclosed paper was prepared several years ago, for publication in Silliman's Journal; but, from motives which you will readily appreciate, its communication has been deferred since my connection with the Coast Survey, until the present. time. The peculiarity of certain views of wave time recently put forth by an eminent English experimentalist, and my own later deductions in regard to the nature of electricity, based upon the experiment described in the paper, have determined me to present it in its original form. It stands precisely as it was written in 1850, with the addition of the paragraph re1ating to the constancy of tlrn tensions, and; under a sense of duty and respect, it is now submitted to you as the scientific head of the organization to which I am attached. The rmmlt of my experiment points to an important modification of the theories of e1ectricity, and furnishes a clue to account for the different velocities observed in transmitting signals through telegraph wires. Much reflection on the imbject has led me to the formation of a theory respecting the distribution of e1ectricity, which seems to include all the cases heretofore regarded as anomalous. The requisite mathematical demonstration8 will be prepared in due time; and I trust that the theory thus completed will not only bear an important part in settling the question of "contact" or" chemical action," but also furnish a conclusive test applicable to the celebrated demon8tration by Prof_ Ohm. It bas not been deemed necessary to append to the paper any special statement in regard to the date of the experiment, as a drawing illustrative of it, with descriptions, &c., was exhibited in the spring of 1849 to Professor ,Joseph Henry, who entirely coincided with me in the explanation of the phenomenon.

ON A NEW VOLTAIC EXPERIMENT, AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY OF A VOLTAIC CURRENT.

The experiment to be described, proves that a sensible interval of time is employed in raising a galvanic current to its maximum under certain circumstances ; or, in other words, that bef~re a battery can affect any conductor, time is required to generate the quantity of electricity which

will give the tension requisite to produce the maximum intern;ity of current due to the battery with that conductor. In my daily employment with the voltaic batter>', I was led to observe, that at certain times, its force was other tlrnn that due to the s11ecific voltaic arraugement employed. Occasionally the force of the battery on the first moments of completing the circuit through the electrolyte, would be so great as to deposite metal in the amorphous i-;tate, while at other times the same battery with the same electrol_yte, and under precisely similar comlitions, even to that of temperature, would be so feeble, that before sufficient metal coulJ be deposited tu cover tl1e electrode, its face wouhl he corroded by chemical action. The consequences of these variations of the electrical force involved los:ses of tinie and of means employed in the operations. In the process of electro plating, if the decreaJ:Je of power took place, the adhesion of the deposited film was entirely hindered: while in the electrotype operation, if the increa8e took place, the fine lines of the engraved plate to be copied were liable to be choked by a deposite of the powdery metal. In one case the damage thus resulting amounted to over five hundred dollars. This circumstance, and an urgent desire to find some infallible method for producing perfect adhesion in the process of plating and gilding, induced me to experiment, and to watch closely for the conditions which attended these niriations of the battery power. The great force which the galvanometer exhibits as generally prevailing fur the first moments after completing the battery circuit, I at that time attributed to the primt- condition of the platesthe zinc being then unaffected by sulphate, and the conducting plate free from adhering hydrogen. As such a condition of the plates would be equivalent to an increase of the average conducting section, or, what amounts to the same, a diminution of conduction resistance ; this would clearly account for an increase of force above that due to the uniform or general flow of the current. Yet, while it was not clear that an increase of conduction resistance ever took place, I felt satisfied, from observation, that there were moments when tlie power was greatly reduced. In the theory of the distribution of electricity proposed by Dr. G. S. Ohm, and now very generally received, the teusion on the generating surfaces is sup1>osed to be constant, however the ?onductor may be varied ; and consequently, the tension at any part of the conductor will he lllversely proportional to the resistance up to that iiart. Frnm these premises it may be inforred, that when any part of a conductor conveying a current i8 made to change place with reforence to the whole conducting line, such variations of quantity as 1 have noted almve may take plan:. It may also be inferred, that time is required to change the tension in the altered part8. But the great velocity of electrical distribution being well known, it would seem improbable that this interval of time should be appreciable, or that tlie change;; of tension thus occurring could be so great as to affect important electro-metallurgical conditions. These changes of tension, and the time involved in their production, I have ma,Ie sensible by the simple apparatus which is represented in the accompanying sketch, (No. 52, Diagram A.) AB 0 are three Smee's batteries, with their generating and conducting plates ZS, Z S, ZS, joined in consecutive order by the couductons r, r, and connected with a vol ta.meter V, by the conductors R, R. The coii.ductors R, R have each a branch b, b, which are to be so a:ranged that contact may be ma1ie at K by a tap of the finger, in order to complete the circuit through the branches. 1'he electrodes P, N, of the voltameter may be two inches long, by half an inch wide, and should be well platinized, (covered with amorphous platinum); hut other sized electrodes may be used, provided the battery plates arc not more than five time8 as la.rge as the electrode plates. The batteries and voltameter are to be charged with a mixture of ten pa.rts of water to one of sulphuric acid. No other acid than sulphuric should be u1Sed, as the least quantity of any acid capable of combrnir:,,.; with hydrogen, in the batteries or voltallleter, will defeat the experiment. The arrangement being complete, gas will rise freely from the electrodes of the voltameter. Now while the decom1iosition of the acidulatetl water iu the voltarnetcr i:; going ou, let the

368

REPORи:r

contact be sufldenly made at K, and the evolution of gas will instantly cease. If, however, the current be suddenly broken at K, the gas will not immediately rise from the electrodes, but nearly one second may e1a11se before the electrolysis appears. The gas ceases to be evolved from the electrodes when the contact is macle at K, because the P!ectricity passes almost entirely by the metallic branch, though. the circuit through the electrolyte is still compfrle; for, the respective quantities of electricity passing through the branches of a divided circuit will not in such case be inversely as the conduction resiRtances of these branches; the electrolyte requiring for its decomposition a specific tension, which is greater than the tension prevailing at the point of the conductor where the bifurcation takes place. The same would be the case if the bifurcatiom; could be made to arise from the generating surfaces ; the tension of the conducting plate would certainly be lessened, but without affecting the relation of t.he two circuits, unless indeed the metallic branches should be made soи long as to counterbalance by their conduction resistance, the tension required for the decomposition of the e}ectrolyte. Blit here it may be ob8erved, that иif the bifurcations could take place directly from both tli,e generating s!ir/aces, the current ought to pass by botli branches, if Ohm's position respecting tlie constancy of tension cit tliese surfaces be correct. The fact that gas does not immediately arise from the electrodes, on breaking the contact at K, might at first appear referable to conditions requiring an accumulated product of the decomposing agency. But, that no immediate decomposition of the electrolyte takes place may easily be shown, by observing the time required to evolve the gas, after diverting the current from the metallic branch, and then alternately breaking and restoring the contact at K, at intervals somewhat less than this observed time. If now the electrodes of the voltameter be covered in the usual manner, and the current be made to traverse the electrolyte during as many of the observed intef'wals as would amount to hours, no gas will be found under the inverted cups. Let, however, the contact at K remain broken, and then alternately 'trreak and restore the current at very small intervals through the toltaroeter, instead of merely deflecting it through the branch ; and it will be found impossible to prevent the decomposition. If a sufficient number of contacts of the least possible duration be made, the gas cups will at length be filled. I regard the result of this experiment conclusive of the fact, that a specific interval of tim~ does elapse before a current in a conductor attains its maximum. It may be said that the current does not pass at all before the tension required for decomposition is reached; but as water conducts the electricity from a. single voltaic pair without suffering decomposition, the current most probably passes from the Бrat moment the circuit is completed, precisely as by a metallic conductor. But, the time for attaining the maximum intensity l)eing proportional to the resistance, it does not appear in the metal, though in the electrolyte the small quantity of electricity which passes at the tension too low for decomposition, and the g:eat increase in the quantity which suddenly takes place on the attainment of a certain tension, serve to mark the phenomenon very strongly. The experiment I hav<' described above is perhaps not new, but I know of nothing precisel.Y similar. In a philosophical view it is analogous to the charging of a Leyden jar hy the galvanic trough, in the respect that some time must elapse beforeи a second charge can be given. ~t 8 suggests also a recurrence to the well known fact., that if, when the tension of a De Luc column is sufficient to diverge the leaves of a gold-leaf electroscope, the poles should b_e but momentarily connected by a metallic conductor, the leaves instantly collapse., and a. considerable time must pass before the tension is sufficient to make them diverge again.

Letter of George JБathiot, Esq., Electrotypist Coast iS'urvcy qJ!ir:e, communicating an impmved 1nethod for taking entire casts from detached plates !Jy the electrotype process.
OrFrcE, July lG, 1855. DEAR Srn: I have recently devised a very simple and easy method for joining plates to be combined for taking entire casts by the electrotype process ; and as it seems to increase the utility and application of the electrotype art in reproducing the charts of the Coast Survey, some account of the advantages which it presents in practice may not be uuintere8ting. The idea of taking a single cast from Reveral detached pieces (combined for the lrnrpose) was one of the :first suggestions of electro-metallurgy, yet the means hitherto employed have involved much expense and loss of time, as well in the operation of filing the edges of thick lilates for nice adjustment, as in guarding against injury to their engraved surfaces while in the hands of the mechanic. Hence, though the ordinary mode has been in several instances used with advantage, economy has forbidden its general application, except in cases wherein even a tedious :process offered manifest facilities in respect to the time required to reproduce an engraved plate. The plan which I have devised supersedes the mechanical method formerly used, by taking from the plates to be joined electrotype casts weighing not more than three or four ounces to the square foot. These being cut in any required form with a pair of scissors, require merely to be cemented, each in its proper place, on a blank plate coated thinly with shoemaker's wax. Any superfluous wax may be readily removed by a cloth saturated with oil of turpentine, after which the plate is ready for the electrotypist. The adjustment of the parts of a map plate can thus be ma1e or supervised by the engineer, or by the engraver or draughtsman, and entirely without the aid of the mechanic. I have used this method with complete success in remodelling the plate of Salem harbor, decidedly the most complicated operation in joining of all I have yet taken in hand, and the time actually spent on it was less than a day. By the former process it could not have been remodelled in less than a month, if at all. The combination, a few years since, of four plates to form the lower sheet of Delaware bay, required about four weeks of mechanical work, and the operation, tedious as it was, gave satisfaction: the saving of time in restoring the lost sheet being highly important. If it were now necessary to combine these plates, the operation could be performed in a few hours. In cases where parts of a plate require to be changed in position the mode here describeu is peculiarly applicable, whereas the old process, by removing a portion of each by the saw and file, renders the transfer of parts extremely difficult, if not wholly impracticable. Large maps may now be put in detached parts into the hands of any number of engravers for more speedy completion, the thin electrotypes taken from the several pieces serving for the production of entire casts in all respects as well as the thick plates, even when joined by the most elaborate mechanical means . .Electrotypes to be used in the method of joining now communicated, if begun in the morning, will b! the next day be thick enough for the purpose required. The saving in time, and in the material hitherto used for thick plates, becomes, on a comparison of the results of the two methods, very important. Very respectfully, Captain H. BENHAM' U. S.

THE BRANCH CIRCUIT GALVANOMETER.

In the application of electrical currents it is indispensable to have some idea of what is called the qiumtity of the current, for tl1e application of a greater or less quantity affects not only the amount of the product of tlie current, but also its nature. This dependence of the quality or nature of the product on the strength of the current will hold good in every known effect produced by the current. Thus, a current of a certain quantity flowing through a wire will develop magnetism in the wire, but an increased quantity produces heat sufficient to melt or even deflagrate the metal. Again, a solution of metallic salt will yield metal and acid to a certain strength of current, but the product of a greater quantity may be hydrogen and oxygen; and, indeed, a solution of various metallic salts may be all successively decomposed by varying the force of the current. And not only is t11e specific substance produced dependent on the quantity of the current, but in all the derived solids, the state of molecular aggregation is affected by the quantity of the current. The aggregation of gaseous products is perhaps modified in the Rame way, for it is now well ascertained that, in the electrical resolution of water into hydrogen and oxygen, more or less of oxygen is rendered as ozone, according to the intensity of the electrolytic action. This is J>lainly exhibited in thunder showers, the enormous electrical currents even by their inductive action on the drops of falling water, generating sufficient ozone to scent a considerable district. Jn the electro~metallurgic processes, the knowledge of the quantity of the current is of the very first importance, for reductions formed by various quantities of electricity may exhibit opposite qualities. In the reduction of copper the amateur electrotypist finds that, thougl1 he may sometimes obtain a casting which will compare favorably with the best specimens of rolled and hammered copper, in hardness, elasticity, aud every other desirable property, it often happens that some one of the metallic properties is but imperfectly developed, or perhaps greatly in excess, causing the copper to be hard and brittle like cast iron, or soft and flexible like lead, or even as an incoherent mass of small crystals or a layer of mud; and what is here stated in regard to copper, is even more applicable to the electro formation of the other metals; the influence on the state of aggregation is often such as to modify not only the mechanical properties, but also the chemical constitution of the metals. I have deposited thin plates of iron, which seemed to have the same qualities as the purest forms of cast-iron, (unwrought cast steel,) and which had no more tend.ency to oxidation than ordinary iron; yet iron can readily be precipitated of such quality that, shortly after being taken from the decomposing cell and dried, it spontaneously l1eats, takes fire, and undergoes vivid combustion. The preciousи metals are not exceptions to this liability to an apparent transformation of their chemical properties. Filings of silver, or even the minute crystals precipitated by copper from the nitrate, will not dissolve to any considerable extent in a solutioa of cyanide of potassium ; yet I have seen a solid plate of electro-reduced silver dissolwd entirely away in a few hours in the same solution. Even g~Id is seen apparently to acquire the strong affinity of a baser metal. And yet in contrast to increased tendency to chemical combination, pieces of well formed copper lie about the laboratory, or in the damp cellar beneath, for long periods, without becoming tarn'ished-the oxidable copper having a1)parently taken a quality in this respect analogous to that of the precious metals. . From what ha.is been stated concerning the results produced by different forces of current, it will at once &J)pcar that successful operations in electro-metallurgy require even an accura~e lmowledge of every change that takes place in the strength of the current. The want of this

OF THE UNITED ST.ATES COAST SURVEY.

371

knowledge has much retarded the progress of the art of electro-gilding anJ. silvering, and, и though perhaps tD a less extent, the process of electrotyping. None of the e1ectrometers hitherto proposed supply the desideratum of the electro-metallurgist for measuring the large quantity currents employed in precipitating the metals, for these instruments, as constructed, require to be interposed in the circuit and travered by the whole current; and as the circuit is necessarily short, in order that the quantity may be large, the additional resistance produced by the increased length of the circuit, due to the instrument, causes a very great reduction in the quantity of electricity. The amount. of resistance which the measuring instrument will oppose to the current is found to be quite considerable, if the necessities of the arrangement are considered. Putting the voltameter aside for the present, on account of the low tension of the current to be measured, we will consider the suitableness of the galvanometer and electro-magnet, (magnetometer.) Of the galrnnometer it must be observed that it cannot be used in the vicinity of the batteries or decomposition cells, for the current in these parts of the apparatus will affect the magnetic needle; and as the currents are constantly changing in magnitude and in location by the necessary changes of the plate in the cell, the galvanometer must be placed at some distance from the apparatus. V{ith respect to the magnet, it will appear that it is not very easy to form a short helix for cornlucting large currents around the iron core; for the current being great in quantity, necessarily requires a heavy conductor. In the batteries of the Coast Survey laboratory the wire which conveys the current from the batteries to the decomposition cell is one inch in diameter, and a rod of this size, or its equivalent in smaller wire, could not very readily be worked into a helix without employing considerable length. But though the electro-metallurgist might have been aware of the consequences of using too great or too small a current for his work, and however desirable might he a knowledge of its force at any given moment, it is certai.u. that none of the electrometers heretofore offered have served the purposes required. After much investigation, with a view to overcome the difficulties hitherto experienced, I have now the good fortune to present a description of a form of measuring apparatus which seems to be free from all objections. The galvanometer which I have devised adds nothing to the length o: resistance of the circuit, and may be employed at any desirable distance from the batteries and decomposition cells. It is compact in form, costs but little, and may be made of extreme sensibility. The principle of this galvanometer rests on that well-known property of the electrical current, that when several circuits are offered it divides between them, in quantities proportional io the relative conduction resistances of the various branches. On this property it is evident a portion of a current may be led off to any desired distance from the main conductor, and then subjected to the nicest measurement without the least liability of disturbance from the parts of the current in the main conductor, or in the plates of the batteries and decomposition cells. It would be superfluous to discuss the principle on which I have based the new galvanometer, ~s Professor Ohm, in his celebrated mathematical investigation of the galvanic current, deduced it from the phenomena attending conduction through a single circuit. It was afterwards verified by experiment by M. Lenz upon currents generated by the magneto-electric machine, and more recently it has been experimentally verified by Mr. J. Lane for the currents generated by the Voltaic battery. That the current in the branch circuit is always the same proportional, in ~espect to the whole amount flowing, is not to be doubted, and nothing more is here required in relation to the principle of the branch circuit galvanometer, for the name is suggestive to every electrician both of the principle and construction . . The construction of the branch circuit galvanometer employed in the laboratory of this office ~8 e:x::remely simple, yet its performance has been highly satisfactory; and, indeed, I could not imagine anything more desirable for the purpose required. A description of this crude apparatus will include sufficient directions for constructing and using it.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

In the Coast Survey laboratory the batteries and decomposition cells are rn separate roomsJ 1ut are ranged against the partition wall, in order that they may still be as near together as и practicable. Two bars of copper, each one inch in diameter and about four feet long, pass through the wall, and make the electrical connexion between the batteries and decomposition troughs. On the ends of the copper rods, in the battery room, are iron cups containing mercury; these cups receive the currents from the several parts of the battery, and combine them into one in the main conductor. A copper wire a fifth of an inch in diameter is attached to one of the copper bars near the cup, and from thence the wire is let down through and under the floor of the laboratory, to a point above which it is convenient to have the galvanometer. The wire is then brought through the :floor to a table, and, forming a m.ultiplier of six rectangular coils over a magnetic needle five inches long, again descends and passes under the floor to the . main conductor, where it is brought through and attached to the other end of the copper bar. vVhen a current comes on the bar a portion of it is led off into the br:anch and deflects the magnetic needle in the coils of tho multiplier, but the deflection cannot be noted by observing the endR of the needlo-those being hid by the multiplier. To make the deflection visible, the needle has a slender brass wire six inches long, soldered across it near the centre and at right-angles to the axis. The end of the wire moves before a graduated arc which serves for measuring the deflection. It only remains now to note the deflections produced by currents dissolving various weights of copper, and we have a scale of working which points out how many pounds or ounces of copper the butteries are making per hour or day. The scale is soon established, by weighing the electrotype supply plates from day to day, and noting the deflections. A scale may be established in a few days, lJy a set of experiments made for this purpose. It will 1e most convenient to commence withи a large pair of electrodes and strong battery, weighing the electrodes every three or four hours and lessening the number of the battery plates each time, till the needle recedes one or two degrees. In this way a full scale may be had in a few days. It might be thought that the quantity of electricity deflected from the main conductor in some cases may not be enough to affoct the needle, but it must be borne in mind that the indications of the galvanometer arc rclativdy the same in a branch as they would be in the main circuit. The quantity which can be led off will generally be found sufficient to work the ordinary galvanometers, as will appear evident by considering the particular arrangement described above, as em11loyed in the Coast Survey laboratory. Here the arrangement is pur1mscly such, that only a small relative quantity is led off; the main conductor is one inch thick, which is uncommonly heavy, and though the branch wire is one-fifth of an inch in diameter, its section, compared with that of the inch-bar, is only as one to twenty-five. The branch wire is eighty foet long and the hai four feet ; then we have the branch resisting twenty-five times more than the bar by its lesser section; and this is repeated twenty times in its greater length, making the whole resistance of the wires five hundred times greater than the bar. Here, then, for every five hundred and one parts of electricity flowing through the whole circuit, one part will pass through the branch. Now, as the solution of one grain of zinc per twenty-four hours generates enough electricity to affect the ordinary galvanometers, if the electrotype apparatus is making but once ounce of metal per day, the branch circuit galvanometer may be used for measuring the current. Hut it is not necessary that the proportion in the branch should be so very small ; it may conveuiently be a twentieth or more, or it may even be the greater proportion; for when the main coDductor is but small, which is generally the case where but small currents are employed, then the branch wire may greatly exceed the main in thickness. The branch circuit galvanometer may be made portable, and is thus well adapted for general purposes. I have 1md one of them for some time in use for measuring the smaller currents employed for miscellaneous purposeR, such as making electrotypes of single views in a plate, и1 и и и goldи . mak mg t1 ie s1 ver i>lates employed for the negative plates of the batteries, platmlBlng, plating thermometers, experimenting on electro etching, &c., &c., and always with the_sam: 18 degrre of satisfaction. The peculiarity in this instrument is the use of tt metallic bar which

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

373

made part of the circuit; the branch being taken from it, and the same bar being always nsed, the proportional conductivity of the branch and bar is always the same, and consequently the same scale of deflection referred to weights always serves, thus giving the apparatus a universality in application. The portable instrument in use is constuctcd with the usual magnetic needle, graduated circle, and multiplying coil ; but in addition to these there are the bar and two flexible wire cords for conveying the electricity to the compass placed l)eyond the disturbing influence of the current in the other parts of the circuit. The magnetic needle is five inches long, suspended on an agate centre, and provided with a "lifter." 'l'he circle is divided to half degrees, and numbered at every tenth degree east and west from t]ie zero points or magnetic meridian. The needle and ring are placed, as usual, in a brass box provided with a glass cover. The multiplying coil is composed of copJJer ribbon twelve feet long, one inch wide, and one-thirtieth of an inch thick. This is wo11nd into a circle seven inches in diameter. The multiplying coil is placed vertically around the compass-box, and in the magnetic meridian on zero lines. The ends of the coil are brought through the centre of the stand which supports the compass-box to two clamps. So far the construction is similar to the generality of galvanometers, excepting in the multiplier being formed of so heavy a conductor. Two wire cords, each six feet long, and supposed to have the same section as the conductor in the coil, are attached to the clam1is at one extremity, and t]rn other near the ends of a copper bar one foot long and one-fourth of an inch square. At the extremities of the bar are clamps for making connection wit11 the conductors of currents to be measured. When a measurement is made with this instrument, the bar is put in the circuit by means of the clamps, and the deflection noted and referred to the corresponding weight, previously ascertained hy experiment. The supposition here is that the addition of the bar to the circuit does not affect the quantity of the current; but this is not strictly true. 'l'hc amount is unimportant, and may be avoided by having a similar bar always in the circuit when the galvanometer bar is out. In constructing the branch circuit galvanometer it should be borne in mind that the needle cannot be indefinitely affected, as in other galvanometers, by making many turns to the multiplier. The first point to be determined is the distance at which the instrument must be placed from the disturbing influence of the various parts of the circuit; then having determined the length of the wire to convey the electricity from the circuit to the instrument and back, we have the precise length for the conductor in the coil; if the length of the multiplier is eitl1er greater or less than this, the deflection will be less. With any given length of connecting cord ?etween the instrument and main circuit, the deflection can be a maximum only when t~1ere is the same length in the coil as in the connecting cords. By the use of this instrument in the electrotype work of the Coast Survey, the very great advantage has been obtained of being able to ascertain by a mere glance, at what rate the batteries are working and the quality of the reduced metal. The desideratum thus acquired in the apparatus has surpassed even the most ardent wishes entertained within my knowledge in reference to the object which it accomplishes.

APPENDIX No. 64 .
.Abstract of a complete historиical acccount of the progress ef discovery on the western coast of the United States from the earliest period; compiled,, under direction of the Superintendent, b!f J. G. Kohl. WASHINGTON, March lj 1855. DEAR Sm : I am gratified in being able to announce the completion of the work undertaken by your direction. The following short account of it is intended only as preliminary to your critical examination of the work itself, and as such, it is hoped that it may be found acceptable. Your communication mentioned as desirable1. A complete historical account of the progress of discovery, as connected with the hydrography of the western coast, from Coronados island to Cape Scott, the northern point of Vancouver's island. 2. A map to illustrate the historical account, showing in colors the range and limits appertaining to each discoverer and explorer. 3. A collection of maps, reduced copies of originals or duplicates of ancient and modern maps, in further illustration of the history. 4. A list of names of bays, capes, harbors, &c., on the western coast, with critical and historical remarks, settling the orthography of the names. 5. A catalogue of books, maps, manuscripts, etc., relative to discoveries on the western coast. .As intimated in a former letter, the last two particulars seemed to present insuperable difficulties; but in the progress of the others, certain advantages arising therefrom have enabled me to include them also, in accordance with your expressed desire. The hirstorical account is divided into the following periods: 1. From Columbus to Cortez; 2. From Cortez to Drake; 3. From Drake to the Jesuits; 4. From the Jesuits to the Franи ciscan missionaries and their expeditions; 5. From the Franciscans to Vancouver; 6. From Vancouver to Wilkes. The seventh period, which is excluded from the narrative by an explicit understanding, would embrace a notice of the crowning work now in progress under your direction for the development of the hyclrography of the coast of California and Oregon and Washington Territories. Some things relating to early Spanish expeditions of great importance, hitherto overlooked by historians, will be found in this memoir. I may mention as examples the first explorations of Fuca strait, by the three Spanish navigators De Haro, Quimper, and Eliza, prior to Gray and Vancouver. In appendices I have comprised information which may be found both interesting and useful. One of these contains a list of the Spanish governors of Vancouver's island, who, as famous explorers, have their titles and dates of government associated with the geography of the western coast. A list, similar in character, is given of the viceroys of Mexico. The short introduction and index attached to the historical account exhibit its plan of arrangement and the particulars of its contents. The map illustrative of the memoir just noticed, exhibits in colors the extent of coast in~lu~ed in the discoveries of each navigator and traveller, with names, dates, etc. A brief description . which accompanies the map explains the plan adopted in its construction. 1 The collection of historical maps shows the condition of discovery and the limit of geographies knowledge in regard to the western coast at various periods between 1492 and 1841. . It includes, as far as possible, copies from original maps, on which had been marked by succe~siv; explorers the tracks and routes pursued, and which thus serve to show the opinions ent.ertaine of the discovered countries by them and their contemporaries. Others in the collection were copied from manuscripts or from rare prints. The copies taken from more modern and better known maps are not without interest as links in the chain of historical connection.

An explanatory note accompanies each map and sets forth its relative value in the series. The list of geographical names includes the history of nearly three hundred objects, as capes, have assigned a separate sheet, inlets, harbors, etc., on the western coast. To each name at the top of which is written the orthography used in the Coast Survey maps, and for Vancouver's island that found in the charts of the English admiralty. Brief mention is made of the first application, and by whom, of each name to the corresponding object. Changes in the terms employed are accounted for by reasons which would seem to have recurred naturally in the course of progressive explorations, as affording from time to time more definite information. The treatise on each name is concluded with an attempt to settle, as far as possible, its orthograpl1y. Between thirty and forty names yet remain to be discussed in order to form a complete list. The catalogue of printed and manuscript books and maps relating to the western coa.st contains two hundred and thirty titles, exclusive of those of the maps comprised in the collection before mentioned, (which is accompanied by a list separately,) and I have no knowledge of a more complete catalogue of works on this interesting subject. Maps contained in books are referred to specially. To most of the titles short critical notes are added, indicating the value of each book as connected with histot.ical research, or noting parts of it for reference. The arrangement is made in chronological order, and the titles of the most indispensable works are distinguished by the letters N. B. It would seem desirable to append to the foregoing, which includes all that I have now compiled by your direction, a geographical description of the whole coast, its configuration, with details respecting the size, figure, and nature of its various capes, straits, harbors, inlets, bays, river entrances, rocks, banks, shoals, and currents, prevalent winds, and other phenomena of general interest to navigation. This could readily be made up from the records of the Coast Survey, and it would add much to the relative value of early accounts of the western coast. In many cases, while engaged on the work just completed, I was enabled to decide in regard to certain historical doubts only by following your reports, in connection with letters and views and the descriptions given by officers engaged in the work under your superintendence. To give but one instance from many which occurred, I could make out that the old "Ca.ho Galera" of the Spaniards was our Point Conception only by comparing the old descriptions of it with the Coast Survey views and delineations of that cape. The expediency of preparing at this time such a compilation as that suggested, is submitted for your consideration. In the execution of the work, the nature of which is set forth in the short abstract here given, every attainable facility has been afforded in the libraries of the Department of State, the War Department, Navy Department, Topographical Bureau, and National Observatory. In these, and in the valuable collection of Colonel Peter Force, my applications were met by the most prompt and liberal assistance. I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant, J. G. KOHL.

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE MOUNTAIN RAKGES OF CALIFORNIA, ADJOINING THE COAST.
1.
COAST MOUNTAINS.

The re.ariner or traveller who has only frequented the Atlantic coast of the United States, has bnt a slight conception of tlrn great contrast that is presented between it and that. of the Paci tic. The eastern coast is characterizerr hy numerous and deeply indented bays, strPtcl1ing far i11l11,nd, an<l receiving the waters of numerous naYi!?,'ahle streams, producing a broken and serrated coast ~ine. The western is characterized hy it~ renuirkalily regular and unliroken line of coast, affи1rdmg but two secure harbors in a distance of 600 miles, and receiving but at one or two points the wat.ers of any large streams. This great difference is due to the geological structure of the reg10ns. Mountain ranges extend parallel w~th the coast on both sides of the continent; but on the Atlantic side, tho mountains are separated from the shore by a broad slope of sedimentary strata, in which the long and deep bays have been excavated; while on the Pacific side, the mountains rise directly from the ocean like a great wall, and are rarely :flanked by a broad and low slope. These mountains, by their hardness and continuity, pre"ent the formation of inlets and the outlet of interior rivers. The importance of a know ledge of the con figuration and general topography of these mountains to the student of the coast and its hydrography, will be fully recognised when the fact that the mountain ranges, by their composition and position, have determined the present direction and form of the California coast, is duly appreciated, and it is seen that they furnish the true key to a knowledge of its hydrography. IlaThe ranges nea.r the coast, in the latitude of San Francisco, were formerly called the "Coast M nge;" but this name has been gradually giving place to the more general term, Ooa6t

REPORT OF TH..E SUPERINTENDENT

In California this term is generally understood to refer to the several ranges of mountains lying west of the Sierra Nevada, and forming the barrier between the long interior valleys of the Sacramento and San Joaquin, and the Pacific ocean. By some, the same term has been applied to the great ranges south of the junction of the Sierra with the Coast mountains at the head of the Tulare valley, near the parallel of 35░. It will, however, be seen that these southern mountain ranges, although not separated from the coast by continuous and subordinate ridges, are yet more properly the continuation of the great chain of the Sierra Nevada, and that to apply the name Coast mountains to them would lead to misapprehension and be productive of confusion. The term Coast mountains, therefore, in tbiR article will be understood to refer to the mountain ranges which separate the valleys of the Sacramento and the Joaquin, from the Pacific, or to those which extend along, or near, the coast line from Oregon to P-0int Conception. South of this point the mountains are different in character and direction, and will be described under other names. The Coast mountains corniist of a series of parallel ranges separated by long longitudinal valleys. In the latitude of San Francisco, there are three prominent ranges : the first, or most Wt"stern, is called the San Francisco and San Bruno range, and forms the peninsula, which bounds the bay on the west; the second is called Contra Costa; and the third, Diablo range. The last borders the valley of the San Joaquin, and consists chiefly of the peak of Monte Diablo, nearly 4,000 feet l1igh. This J>eak iR visible from the bay, aml in clear weatlrnr from a long distance seaward. It has been reported to be volcanic, but there is no good reason for the opinion. The Golcien Gate, and the channel of the hays and rivers connecting the Pacific with the interior, have the general character of a great fissure through these three ranges, for the adjoining lines of elevation are apparently continuous with the same trend on both sides of the channel, and exhibit the same parallelisms and general elevation. In the latitude of Monterey, we find the same conditions of long parallel ranges. Point Pinos, which extends out into the sea and forms the bulwark of the hay of' Monterey, is the end of' a long and elevated range, formerly called the Sierra de Santa Lnc,1'.a, which extends southward and forms the coast line nearly to San Luis Obispo. 'l'his range is probably composed almost wholly of granite, and it forms a bold rocky shore for nearly its entire length. Beyond this range, towards the interior, we find the long and extensive low valley of the Salinas or San Buenaventura river, which is bounded on its eastern side by another high range, also composed, in part, of hard granitic rocks, with uplifted sandstone strata. This range appears to bet.he southern prolongation of the mountains forming the northeastern shore of the bay of Monterey, extending to San ta Cruz and Point Ano N uevo, where they are known as t~e Santa Cruz range. The road from Monterey to San Francisco crosses this range near the mission of San Juan, and at tliat 11oint it has received the name of 8an Juan range; further south it is sometimes called the Gavilan m the Salinas range. The third range forms the easter~ side of the Benito valley, and divides it from the San Joaquin. The valley of the Salinas 19 about sixty miles in length, and near its northern extremity about twelve wide. The bay of Monterey may be considered as formed by the junction of this valley with the sea. In the latitude of San Luis Obispo, the same characteristic parallelism of ranges prevails. At that point they are bold and elevated, and the topography of the interior is as yet but little kno~n. We have thus seen that the Coast mountains do not form one sin.,.le continuuus ridge bordering the sea, but that they consil'.lt of a series of parallel ra.nges enclosi~g long and extensive v~lleY~и 18 The general direction of the ran(Tes between Sir Francis Drake's bay and Point Conceptwn, N.

one long ridge and the side of another, shows an overlapping character in the ranges in a most distinct manner. This is a characteristic of the California mountain ranges; they appear to be <listribu ted en echelon, and to overlap towards the nortl1west in an ascending order from south to north. This character is visible on a good topographical map of the country, and may be seen on a small scale, on the charts of the bay of San Francisco and San Pablo, where the inner rang-es pass beyond and terminate north vf the outer. With regard to the general or average elevation of the Coast mountains, we are without sufficient data to form an accurate conclusion. Several determinations of altitude have been made in the vicinity of San Francisco, but the observations along the ranges south of that point are very few. Table Hill, north of the entrance to San Francisco bay, is 2,569 feet high, and there are many higher summits beyon<l. South of the entrance, the San Francisco range commences in hills of moderate elevation, increasing in altitude towards the south until, opposite the valley of Jan .Tose, the average elevation of the range is not less than 2,000 feet, and there are many lofty ridgeR between that }JOint and Santa Cruz. "Blue .Mountain," a few miles south west of the city, is 1,097 feet high, and another point a little further south is 1,263. The secoml, or Contra Costa range, opposite Ran Francisco, probably has the average elevation of l ,800 or 2,000 feet. One of the summits nearly opposite the entrance to the bay is reputed t<> be 1,952 feet high. '.l'lie Diablo range chiefiy consists of that mountain, with a long spur of low hills connecting it with the second, or Contra Costa range, nearly opposite the mission of San Jose. The mountain, according to the measurement of Lieut. R. S. \Villiamson, is 3,960 feet high; while the pass through the range, a few miles south of the peak, is only 686 feet in elevation, and the adjoining hills are not over 300 feet higher. The range extending along the coast soutl1wardly from Point Pinos has not been instrumentally explored, but is a continuous lofty chain, it8 average elevation probably being not less than 3, 000 feet. At tho southern end of the Coast mountains, where they unite with the great range of the Sierra Nevada, at the pass called the Canada de las Uvas, the ridges near the junction are over 6,000 foet in height. This is about that of the ranges which at that place constitute the terminatfon of the Sierra Nevada. The summit level of the Canada de las Uvas is 4,256 feet above tide, and the Tejon, a pass about twenty-five miles north, is 5,285; the adjoining ridges rising from 6,500 to 7,000 feet. Between these points and the coast at Santa Barbara there are many lofty and rugged mountains, the topography of which is not yet known, but which compare in altitude with the terminal ridges of the Sierra Nevada.

POINT CONCEPTION AND BERNARDINO SIERRA.

Point Conception is the most prominent feature in the outline of the California coast between San Francisco a.nd the peninsula of California. It has been termed the " Hatteras of the P~cific; " sud the appellation is not inappropriate, as mariners experience a great change of climate and meteorological conditions on riassing it, and though the air to the southward may ~warm and soft, fierce and chilling winds may be met on rounding it towards the north. A climatic change is remarkably sudden and well defined at this place, and a great difference in the temperature of the ocean north and south of the cape is belie1'ed to exist. This would ~aturally be expected from the sudden change in the direction of the mountains and the coasth~e, which commence at this point. The coast, instead of holding the N. W. and S. E. direction, as along the base of the Coast mountains between the cape and San Francisco, de.fleets s~ddenly to the ea.stward and becomes nearly east and west in its direction. This change of ~1 r.ection has been determined. by the trend of the great mountain range which stretches from 01 ~t Conception and its vicinity eastward to the peak of San Benardino in longitude 116░ 45', a '.1istance of over 200 miles. Geologically this chain is composed chiefly of granite, gneiss, lllica slate, and ta.loose or nacreous slates in variuus forms and modifications ; erupted por-

phyries and dikes of igneous rocks are not unfrequent, but there is no evidence of the existence of volcanoes. The rocks and the topography of the chain, and the fact that it joins the Sierra Nevada at the Canada de las Uvas, show that in a geographical point of view it must be regarded as the l!!Outhern prolongation of that chain, and not of the Coast mountains. It forms the southern boundary of the Great Basin, and indeed is the only wall of separation between it and the Pacific. Prior to the recent explorations by the railroad surveying expedition under the command of Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, the topography of the chain was but little known to geographers, and it has been without an appropriate and distinctive appellation. Its peculiar direction being nearly transverse not only to the Sierra Nevada, but to the several ranges of the Coast mountains just described, and the definite geographical limits which are presented by its termination in the bold capes of Conception and Arguila at one end, and the intersection with a north and south chain at the other, in the high peak of San Bernardino, suggests the necessity and propriety of a new name by which it may be known and distinguished from the adj()ining c11ains. In the absence of any other term the name Coast Hange has been used by J,ieutenant \Villiamson and others, but in the most general way, without assigning limits or boundaries. I have proposed the appellation Conception and Beriiardino Sierra, or Bernardino Sierra* for the chain within the boundaries named, in order to facilitate description and avoid the confusion and misconception incident to the use of the general term Coast Range or Coast .ilfonntains. From Point Conception eastward1y to Santa Barbara one of the ranges of this chain rises boldly up from the Pacific, and the beach or shore-line trends exactly with the range in a nearly east and west line. East of Santa Barbara, however, the shore-line deflects towards the south, and beyond San Buenaventura does not follow the base of the mountains but is scparate<l from it by a broad slope with a gentle descent from the foot of the mountains to the beach. This broad slope is most developed to the north and east of San Pedro. The mountain chain rising from the upper portion of this slope, and thus separated from the sea, preserYes very nearly the direction of the portion between Santa: Barbara and Point Conception; it, however, bends slightly to the south until it unites with the peak of Bernardino. This part of the chain is crossed l1y several passes, which are generally in valleys, oblique to the trend of the chain, and not at right-angles with it. The principal paRses, known as the San Francisq11ito, Wi1liamson's, and the Cajon, lead to the surface of t~_e Great Basin, and their summit le\ els are respectively 3,437, 3,164, and 4,676 feet in altitude. The average elevation of the chain may be regarded as about 6,000 foet. When viewed from the slope or from the sea, the outline of this chain appears rugged and broken, and would by some be called volcanic, though the examination of the rocks does n?t warrant this conclusion. The peak of San Bernardino is the most lofty and prominent. It 18 a. well known land-mark, and has been used as one of the initial points in the United States land surveys. It has a bald, rounded summit, which is covered with snow during the greater pa~t of the year. Its altitude has not, to my knowledge, been instrumentally ascertained. It. 18 variously estimated at from 7 ,000 to 9,000 feet, but is probably not over 8,500. Gra~ite appears to be the principal rock of which it is composed, and there is no indication of its berng volcanic, other than several thermal springs which gush out from its flanks near the Morm~n settlement of San Bernardino. The broad slope which separates the eastern part of the ch~in from the ocean a11pears to be composed of tertiary strata and. more recent alluvial deposi~i forming by their admixture a rich and fertile soil, which, with the advantage of & most genia climate, has encouraged numerous settlements. It is on this slope, between the mountain and the sea, that we find the city of Los .An?e1 e:' ' 18 San Bernardino, and several thriving villages. The same lllope flanking the mountains

continued southward to San Diego, the shore-line curving gradually round and conforming with the change in the direction of the mountains, which commences at the peak of San Bernardino. It is worthy of remark that this slope, or plain and va11ey~, lying between the mountains and the beach, is a remarkable exception to the general configuration of the Pacific coast, which, as before remarked, is characterized by its bold and preci1iitous shores. If, however, the region could be depresRed for a thousand feet, or as low as it has been within recent geological periods, we should find that the greater part of all these plains and the slope would l>e submerged, and that the shore-line would be nearly at the base of the mountains, and become coincident with their trend, as is now the case near Santa Barbara. Under these supposed conditions of depression, the topography, or the shore-line of the coast, would exhibit in a very distinct and striking manner the east and west trend ut the Bernardino Sierra, and a remarkably sudden and angular bend of the mountains at the peak of San Bernardino would become evident.

PE!\"'JNSlJLA SIERRA.

At the eastern end of the Bernardino Sierra, just south of the mountain of San Bernardino, there is a remarkable pass in the mountains leading from the coast slope to the interior plain of the Colorado Desert. This is called the Pass of San Gorgonio, or San Bernardino, and is bounded on its southern side by the sharp and rugged peak of San Gorgonio. This peak, like San Bernardino opposite it, is formed of granitic rocks ; they are, ho"иever, more slaty, being chiefly gniessose, and they wear away with sharp angular outlines. From this mountain the chain of heights continuf>s southward, forming the great dividing crest between the Colorado desert and the slope to the Pacific on the western side, upon which San Diego is situated. Further south it separates bc>tween the waters of the Pacific and those of the gulf, bing continuous in a high rugged chain to Cape St. Lucas, at the end of the peninsula. .For this great chain I have proposed the name of Peninsula Sierra. The predominant or general trend of this chain, in its nortlrnrn portions, is south a few degrees east, or nearly southeast, forming an abrupt angle with the Bernardino Sierra. In elevation, its northern 1>ortion, or that part north of the present head of the gulf, will probably average from 5,000 to 6,000 feet; the peak of Gorgonio is probably 7,000, and the ridges south of it are much elevated. The summit level of the San Bernardino pass is 2,808 feet above the sea; but the next well known paRs south of it ("Warner's") is much more elevated, the summit being 3,78G feet above tide. A third pass, still further south, and leading from San Diego over towards the Gila, near or below the boundary line, has about the same elevation. From there to the end of the peninsula the chain appears lofty, rugged, and unbroken by any favorable passes. The aspect of this mountain chain from the sea is peculiar ; it has a singularly rugged and rocky aspect, and many high peaks rise above the general mass of mountains w;th a conical outline, suggestive of volcanoes. 'fhe portion over which my observations have extended, from San Bernardino to the boundary, did not, however, give good evidence of the presence of volcanoes. Many of the peculiarly conical and sharp peaks were found, on examination, to consist wholly of gneiss or mica slate, much upheaved and worn into the sharp points anu peaks by long Weathering. A peculiar blackness and lustre which characterizes these rocks on the desert siJe of ~he range, leads many persons to consider the rocks volcanic, when they, in reality, are ordinary granite or the allied rocks . . The chain from its northern end at the pass of San Bernardino, southward to the boundary hne and beJond it, is flanked on the Pacific side by a continuation of the slope bordering the Bernardiao..Sierra. It is, however, more narrow, and the sloping chara.coor is more distinctly

shown. The streams which descend the mountains traverse this slope and cut canal-like channels, with steep banks on each side, so that they are nearly invisible to the traveller on the genera!" surface when a short distance from their margin. On the eastern side of the chain we find the remarkable desert-region bordering the Colorado. The surface of the country on that side is lower than on the went, affording a striking contrast with the conditions presented on both sides of the Beuardino Sierra, but a few miles further north, where the interior base of the mountains has an elevation of over 3,000 feet, or, nearly 2,000 feet higher than the seaward base. '!'here is also good reason to believe that the interior surface of the desert is lower than the surface of the gulf, and that it was formerly submerged by its waters, the upper end of the gulf having been shut off by the accumulation of silt at the delta of the Colorado. This singular valley is now dry ; but its surface of fine clay, l1ighly charged with shells of fresh-water species, shows that it was for a long time in the condition of a great lake of fresh or brackish water. 'l'he eastern sicle of the chain is singularly devoi.cl of trees and -vegetation, but the high valleys of the western side are wooded with pines and many varieties of the oak, and the foothills at the base of the granitic ridges are covered in the winter and spring with a thick growth of the wild oat, so characteristic of the California hills.

SUB<'l'fARINE MOUNTAIN RANGES BORDERING THE COAST.

Those who are familiar with the charts of the California coast, or with the map published by the Coast Survey in 1853, will not Jail to observe groups of islands risi.ng above the watel'S in liaes nearly parallel with the aujoining shore of the main land. These islands are most numerous, and attain their greatest size between Point Conception and San Diego, but the prolongati1 иn of the group ii!! found to extend far to the south ward of San Diego ; and we find islands skirting the shore of the peninsula, and even further south off the coast of Mexico. We also find a small group of islands, called the Farallones de los Frayles, northward of Point Conception, and nearly opposite the entrance to the bay of San Francisco. All these islands have, as will presently be shown at length, a linear arrangement, extending in long lines parallel with the adjoining coast; and they may be regarded as the crests or culminating points of extended but submerged mountain chaim, nearly co-incident in their direction with those that have been drained by the uprising of the continent. If, however, these Oceanic ranges were not sufficiently lofty to raise their crests above the waves, we should still be able to declare their existence and general trend from a knowledge of the configuration of the ranges of the adjoining coaRts. Their presence, however, is of great importance to the geographer and hydrographer, indicating, as they do, the exact positfon and direction of the ranges, and enabling him to point out the probable position of shoals and rocks, and of great longitudinal valleys beneath the sea. It is, therefore, important to the intere.sts of navigation that these submerged mountain ranges, indicated by the islands, should receive careful cousiderati~n. South of Point Conception we find six large islands, between the parallels of 32u and 34░, at different distances from. the coast. There are also several small islands, a~d numerous rocks and reefs. Santa Rosa, the largest of these islands, is about fifteen miles in length and nine in breadth. . 18 Santa Cruz is about twenty-one miles long and from four to five broad. Santa. Catalina about eight miles long and three br(lad. They are all elongatecl, and the direction of greatest length iti 11arallel with the coai:;t off which they rise. They all have bo)d precipitous shores, and rise intu high veaks and ridges, that have during the summer sea.son a peculiarly barren and forbidding aspect to the traveller who views them from the decks of the steamers as they pass back and forth from San Francisco to Panama.. 'l'he three large islands of San Miguel, Santa Cruz, and Santa Rosa, together with the sm~ler one called Anacapa, form one prominent group. They are dititributed in one continuous line,

their ends being opposed and separated by comparatively narrow channels. The line thus formed is sixty-five miles in length; its direction is nearly east and west; in fact the parallel of 34░ intersects each island parallel with its axis of greatest length. The east and west trend of these islands is exactly that of the opposite coast of the main land, between Point Conception and San Buenaventura, and it ha~ already been noticed as characterizing the mountain ranges of the interior in that latitude. 'I'he relative positions of these three islands and the coast will he seen on the charts of the survey representing the coast from San FranciBco to San Diego. The distance of this line of is1anc1s from the adjoining coast is about tl1irty miles, forming a broad valley or channel known as the t5anta Barbara channel. The peculiar hydrographical conditions indicated by this group will be snbseqnently considered. South of the group just described we find three more islamlA of nearly the same size; they also present the elongated character, but they are not dispo.,.ed i11 one straight line; their direction of greatest length is, however, the same, being parallel with themselves and with the adjoining coast. This direction differs from that of the group just described, being very nearly northwest and southeast; and this is likewise the trend of the coast. A beautiful exhibition of parallelism between the islands, the coaRt, and the interior mountain ranges, is presented here; for, as we have already seen, the mountains south of San Bernardino become nearly northwest and southeast in their direction. Santa Catalina is the nearest of theRe three islands to the main land, and iR twenty-five miles distant from the shores of the bay of San Pedro. It is about senиnteen miles in length, and about five in breadth. San Clemente is about the same length, and lie~ at nearly double the distance from the coast,.and a little further south. The island of San Nicolas lies still further seaward, and is about sixty-five miles from the coast, measure'i'l in a direction transverse to the trend. We thus find the distances of these islands from the coast to be twenty-five, fifty, and sixty-five miles; and they indicate the existence of three parallel ranges skirting the coast at these distances. The island of Santa Catalina, although very much elongated in a nortl1west and southeast direction, and thus having a well marked trend, appears to be nearly isolated, and is without any apparent connexion with the other islands. The line of trend, however, if prolonged far to the southeast, intersects the group of islands called Los Coronados, off San Diego. The island of San Clemente has also a very dititinctly marked trend northwest and southeast; and a.bout forty miles distant from its northern extremity we find the island of Santa Barbara lying directly in the prolongation of the liue of trend, thus indicating the submarine continuation of the range lietween them. A similar submarine prolongation is shown at the island of San :Nicolas, where Begg's rock rises above the water seven miles distant from its northwest end. T11is rock is directly in the line of trend of the ii;land, and is a good index of the direction of the submerged range. This direction is nearly north west and southeast, and a line of soundings to the southeast of the main island would probably detect the prolongation of the range in that direction. I have thus considered these three principal islands as culminating points of as many distinct but ~arallel partly submerged mountain ranges skirting the coast, and I propose to give them P:ov1sionally the names of the principal islands which indicate them. In considering the direction of these oceanic rano-es we should bear in mind the peculiar westward deflection of the ranges of the main l:nd', which commences at the peak of San Bernardino, nearly abreast of the northern extremities of the islands. "\Ne l!'hould expect to find a similar and corresponding deflection impressed upon the marine ranges under consideration; and this is rendett>d more probable by the existence ot' the east and w~st marine range indicated by the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz. It is therefore possible that the islands of Santa Barbara do not belong to the San Clemente range, but that they are on the prolongation of Santa Catali~a; and possibly also the island of San Nicolas is on the contipuation of the San Clemente range. If this be found to be so, the number of ranges would be reduced from three to two, and their direction would. be curvilinear, ur deflected more towards the west as they

S84

REPORT O:r '!'HE SUPEJUNTENDEN"l'

approach the San Miguel and Anacapa range. Indeed, I consider these conditions as extremely probable, and partly indicated by the sou1Hlings between the north end of Santa. Catalina and Santa Barbara; but further soundings in a direct nort-hwest line from Catalina., and from the other isl-ands also, and in a line a few degrees north of west from the Santa Barbara islands, are required to throw further light upon this point. Such soundings would probably result in the discovery of extensive reefs and shoals, separated by longitudinal valleys. Still another marine range is indicated by the bank known as the Cortez shoal, about fortyfive miles lieyond Sau Clemente, and probably twenty-five miles beyond the San Nicolas range, if this be found to extend in the direction of the trend of the island. This shoal is of pec11liar interest, from its supposed volcanic origin. It was found by Captain Cropper, of the steamer Cortez, in March, 1853, who says the water around it was in violent commotion, and thrown up suddenly into columns, at regular intervals of four or five minutes. He at firRt thought he saw breakers, and, at times, the water broke as if on a reef.* The recent observations of Lieutenant McRea have shown that there is a ledge of rocks at this place. They will probably be found to be a part of an extended reef, trending in a northwest and southeast direction, or parallel with the neighboring islands. A line of soundings, northwesterly and southeasterly from the shoal, is very desirable .

HYDROGRAPllICAL INDICATIONS, PRESENTED BY THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE COAST AND THE MARINE RANGES.

и

In deducing the l1ydrography of the coast, from a consideration of the physical and geological features of the land, we are guided principally by the direction and character of the consolidated and rocky frame-work upon which the looser and more modern sedimentary deposits have accumulated. We, however, find that the topography of all the principal valleys of the Coast mountains is considerably modified by sedimentary deposits, formed when they were submerged, and which have since been much changed and modified by degradation and the currents of rivers. The extent and character of these deposits cannot be well determined from a consideration of the topography of the bordering rocky elevations. The marine ranges, which have been descril)ed, doubtless modify, and in some cases determine, the direction of the oceanic currents in their vicinity. Where these c;;rrents are stron~, we must expect great changes to be produced among the loo8e sedimentary materials of the bottom, which would be shifted about and deposited in banks and shoals, and in valleys among the rocks, where, from a consideration of the topography alone, we are led to expect to find deep water. This cause of the modification of the ocean bottom should not be lost sight of in the discussion of the hydrography indicated by the marine ranges. Of the several marine ranges which have been indicated, t11at of San Miguel and Anac~pa, along the parallel of 34░, is the most di11tinctly defined, and clearly marked in its direction, and is sufficient proof of the continuance of the main physical features of the adjoining land under the wat.ersofthe ocean. The broad valley between this range and the main land probably corresponds, in general form 1 with those of the Salinas and the bay of San Francisco. It i!! mere1y a trough or depression between two ranges of mountains, and though now covered by the wat.eTS, the elevation of that region several 'hundred foot would effect its drainage, and we would find it to correspond in configuration with the valleys mentioned. ld In searching for the submerged portions of the bordering range of this broad valley, we 8 011 look in tlie lines of prolongation of the island group. This, on the eastern end, would intersect the coast near Point Duma, and it is possible, and in accordance with the diverging characte~ of the ranges of the interior in that la.titude 1 that this marine range unites with the ~~ near that point. In this case, a line of elevation of submerged hills and roclcs will be fotm sounding between 'Anacapa island and the .shore. The western prolongation of the range w

probably be found by sounding in a line a few degrees north of west of the island of San Mi guc l. It is probable tlrnt the range is not prolonged to a great distance in that direction, and that it either sinks down to low hills, or unites with rangeH having tl1e direction of the coast, north of Point Conception and Arguila. The fact that the western end of the high cliain of the Bernardino Sierra does not project into the sea, in a bold promontory of great elevation, but rather breaks down into low hills and diverges in a series of ridges towHr<ls the north, indicates similar conditions in the marine ranges, and it is not, therefore, improbable that t.he marine range of San Miguel and Anacapa breaks down into subordinate rirlges, anrl soon becomes lost under the waves. For the same reason, it is possible that a westerly submarine prolongation of the Bernardino Sierra will not be found to extend far, or with any considerable altitude, off Point Ooneeption. We may, however, conclude that the hydrography off Point Conception and Arguila is exceedingly complicated, simulating the confusion and complexity of the topograph;~ at the junction of the Coast mountains with the Bernardino Sierra between the south end of the Tulare valley and the coast at Santa Barbara and Point Conception. Shallow places, or submerged rocks and reefs, may be expected northwest and southeast of Santa Catalina, San Clemente and San Nicolas, or along the prolongation of the line of trend of these islands. It is desirable to have a line of soundings from both ends of these islands, in the direction of their trend, and especially between San Clemente and the San tri Barbara islands. The probable direction of the ranges indicated by tlicse islamls has already been considered, and will serve as a guide to the selection of lines for sounding. The soundings already made and recorded by the Survey, indicate that the prolongation of San Clemente is not in the direction of San Nicolas, rendering it more probable that the rnnge extends to Santa Barbara island. Soundings northwest and southeast of the Cortez shoal are also desirable. From topographical indications alone, we are led to expect deep water, and an absence of rocks near the surface in the spaces between the lines of trend of the marine ranges; in other words, in the submerged valleys. The soundings already made, l10wevor, show in some instances a very uniform but not great depth ; as, for example, between Santa Barbara island and Santa Catalina, where the depth does not exceed 90 fathoms. Between San Clemente and ~an Nicolas the depth exceeds 120 fathoms near each island, and about midway is 115. Dcpositr: of scdimontaTy materials among these islands are indicated by tlteRe results. North of Point Conception and Arguila, the coaRt topography leads us to :mspect the existence of submarine ranges parallel with the coast, the first of which is 1irobably within a distance of twenty or twenty-five miles of the shore. It probably conforms in trend with the Santa r~ucia range of the Coast mountains which is remarkably uniform in elevation aml direction. aml terminates at ' of soundings on lines transverse to the trend of the cnast ' Point Pinos. A series in this latitude) between Point Pinos and San Luis Obispo, would probably detect these supposc<l submerged ranges, and show that the bottom is undulated in a series of parallel ridges anrl valleys, corresponding with the valleys of the Coast mountains; as, for example, the Salinas v11lley itud its bordering ranges. The probability of such results, indicated as they are by the topography of the c~ast and by the marine ranges just indicated, is rendered still more certain by the beautiful discovery, under the direction of Professor Bache, of submerged mountain ranges and valleys off the Atlantic coast, conforming in their direction wit.!1 the shore-line and with the current of the Gulf Stream. The section off Charleston, by Lieutenant J. N. Maffitt, has Ahown the presence of two ranges-the first 96 miles, and the second 136 miles from the coast.* The distinct and well-defined range of Santa Lucia passes under the waves at Point Pinos ; but thereis every reason to believe that it is continued in a range of submerged rocky points across the outer portion of the wide bay of Monterey, as far north as the Farallones islands, off

the entrance to San Francisco bay. These se\'en small iBlands are of great hydrographical interest, being disposed in one continuous line exactly parallel with the coast, and about twenty miles distant from it. The probability of their being portions of the prolonged range of Santa Lucia, (Point Pinos,) is not only shown by their being nearly on the line of trend, hut by their similar geological characte~. I have long been inclined to consider them as formed of the same kind of granite which is found at Point Pinos, and this h~s been recently proved 1)y the examination of the isl.ands by Lieutenant Trowbridge. 'l'he line of trend of these islamlH is northwest and southeast, and the exact prolongation southeasterly of this line would intersect the coast line near Point Miramontes, where the central range of the mountains, or main axis of the ranges, is of granite rock. It is, therefore, possible that the submerged range upon which these islands rise are branches from the main land, near or at that point, and that the prolongation of the Santa Lucia range from Point Pinos must be sought for further seaward ; and this is likewise indicated by the fact that tlie exact prolongation of the trend of that range would 11ass to the westward of the Farallones.

GEOLOGY OF THE PRINCIPAL TIAYS AND PORTS FROl\1 POINT REYES TO SA:N" DIEGO.
GEOLOGY OF l'UNTA DE LOS REYES.

The 1old projecting promontory of Point Reyes extends into the sea like an arm, nearly at right angles to the coast. It is a natural breakwater, which forms on its inner side the bay discovered by, aml named from, Sir Fraucis Dnike. The promontory may be regarded as a rocky island, connected with the main coast by a low neck of soft strata of sand and clay, which would become submerged and washed away by the sea if the country were but slightly depressed. The extreme point or head of the promontory is formed of hard sienitic granite, and this is the firm bulwark that preserves the soft and yielding sedimentary strata that connect it with the main land from ra1)id denudation and destruction by the surges of the Pacific. The resistance of this sienite to degradation, as compared with that of the soft strata, is strikingly shown by the form of the head of the promontory, which, as will be seen by inspecting the geological map of the point accompanying the memoir, (Sketch No. 59 ,) is broadest along the granitic portion, and exи tends outwards beyond the sedimentary rocks on each side, and on the inner side, far enough in~o the bay to form a sheltered cove, secure from heavy waves. The granite, in fact, is a narrow st~ip at the end of the promontory, about three and a quarter miles in length, and one third of a mile broad; while the width of the adjoining exposure of sedimentary rock, measured parallel with the . length of the granite, is only one and a half mile. , This granitic strip rises to the height of 597 feet, and its southern side presents a bold bluft to the Pacific. Its base is fringed with hundreds of rocky islets, thickly clustered together, and rising in dark pinnacles among the angry waves which bathe their summits and the foot ?f.the bluff in dense masses of white foam. The general form of this bluff, and the relative positions of the granite and the sedimentary strata, are shown on the geological section which ~cco!ll~ 0 panies the map. It is constructed from the measurements of the survey ; the contour Imes the plane-table sheet serving to give the elevations of the points cut by the line of section. The direction of this line is north, 33░ east, and it is drawn on the map. d The sedimentary strata are unconsolidated, an<l consist chiefly of yellowish clay and s~n having a regular stratification, and resting horizontally upon the rugged surface of the. granitff The wearing action of the surf along the shore of the bay has formed a continuous vertical bl:i of these strata, varying from fifty to eighty feet in height, in which their edges are well e:xpos

to view, and are distinctly seen when entering the bay from the 1rnutli. The ba.'' appears as if surrounded by a white wall, and its rcRernblrrnec to vortions of the cnast of Eng-land is sai<l to have inducecl Sir Francis Drake to give the lancl the rntmc of Xew Alhirm. Tl:e stratification is not perfectly horizontal ; there arc .~light dips of from two to fifteen degrees, producing a gentle wave-like flexure in the lines of stratification. I searched carefully for fossils along the base of the cliff, an'l among the masses of earth that had fallen from above, but did not succeed in finding any. The formation is. however, without doubt, Tertiary, and probably belongR t0 the miocene division. Sen'ral very interesting faults of the strata, from six to fifteen foet in extent, were obr;erved on tl1e face of the blnff as shown in the section, some being in long vertical lines, arnl others ohlique. The heautifully accurate and minute meaRuremcnts arnl top()graphy of the ~nrve~-, aR cxhihiti>d on tlit' plane-table sheet, show that theRe faults are tlw Tesult of local land-slips of small extent; hut when viewed from the beach at the base of the bluff, they appeared to traver~e the strata for great distances. Several isolated patches of sandstone and cong1ornernte of iiehbles were found on the granite near the. top of the bluff. They wPre harder tlmn the materials composing the strata just described, but they are probably upper portions of the same sericfl of deposites. ~~fineraloqical character of the Granite fonning the Point.-Tlie granite of the point is practically interesting, it being the nearest locality of the material to foe city of San Francisco. A quarry has already been opened near the shore, and a consideral1lc quantity of stone has been removed. Some difficulty was ex1wrienced in procuring large dimension-stone near the surface, as there are many cracks and seams resulting from decomposition. There are also "dry seams," which traverse the undecomposed portions and gi 1'e snwoth curved surfaces to the blocks. It is, however, }JOssible to procure good lmilcling-stone from the locality by judicious working, and the selection of favorable l)oints. In quality, rhe stone nm;и lw considered excellent; it has a fine grey color, like t]1c )fassachnsctt.~ r<ienitc .. and i~ free from pyrites or other objectionable minerals. Both hornblendeи and mica are fouml in it-the former being dark green, and not very hard ; the latter is in small and brilliant black scales. The foldRpathic base appears to consist of two varieties: one is of a light yellow color, aml is possibly albite ; the other is hard and glassy, and is disseminated in distinct cr.rntals, vary in~ in size from a fraction of an inch to two inches or more in length, and giving a porp11yritic charncter to the mass. These large crystals resist decomposition exceedingly well, and starnl out in relief upon the weatliered surfaces of the rock. The yellowish spar is not so duralile, and in decomposing assumes a rusty brown color; it forms, however, but an inconsiderable part of the rock in the best locality for quarrying. A distinct lamination or structural arrangement of the minerals is visible in this granite. It is not very distinct on the weathered surfaces, but shows plainly in blocks that have been cut out and "dressed." Tlie direction of these planes of structure, as exhibited in the quarry, is about north 20░ east-a direction almost transverse to the trend of the bluff. It is possible that this direction is local and confined to a portion of the granite, which seems to form a distinct outcrop, like a dyke in the surrounding mass. The trend of the bluff of this point is nearly east and west. Thi8 is peculiar, and would not be expected from a consideration of the trend of the ranges of the coast and of the Fara.Hones, which arc northwest and southeast. It is worthv of remark, that the granite of this point bears a general resemblance to that of Point Pinos: at l\fonter~y, di:lfering chiefly in the presence of the dark green hornblende, and the greater ratio in quantity of the hard feldspar to the other minerals. The bold, rookychara.oter of this point, and its prominence beyond the general line of the coast, render tbe erection of a light-house upon it very desirable and important. It is fortunate that such excellent material for its construction is found upon the spot. Granite is also found ea.st of the low neck of Tertiary strata, and forms the main ridge which bounds Tornales bay, on ~he West. The laminated or gneissos-e rocks are also found, and with them, thick beds of good white limestone, which is qnarrietl and calcined for the San Fmncisco market.

GEOLOGY OF THE ENTRANCE TO THE BAY OF SAN l<'RANCISCO.

The peculiar break or cleft in the outer range of the Coast mountains, called the Golden Gate, and connecting the bay of San ]'rancisco with the Pacific, is not only an interestin~ physical feature, but presents a variety of rock formations and a complex geological structure. Both shores of the entrance are bold and rocky; that on the south is broken into aи, series of projecting points, between which there are sand-beaches; the northern is more bold, and ri~es in some places almost vertically from the water, reaching a height of 1,000 feet only a sl10rt distance back from the shore. The principal points of the southern side, in their order of succeRsion from the Pacific eastwanl, are Point Lobos, Fort Point, San .Josef, Tonquin, anrl North Point. The two latter are within the limits of the city of San Francisco, and are already covered with buildings. The rocks of North -Point, Tonquin Point, and San Josef are continuous southwardly, and form Russian and Telegraph hills. They consist of a fine-grained and very compact sandstone of a dark bluish-green color. It is regularly stratified in beds of varying thickness, ranging from a few inches to many feet, and often separated by thin layers of argillaceous shale. Thick beds of these shales are also found to alternate with the masses of sandstone strata. Wherever this sandstone and the shales are quarried into, the dark color is invariably found in portions below the reach of the atmosphere ; but the outer and exposed portions are very much decomposed, and their color is a rusty brown or drab. The rock appears to contain a large amount of protoxide of iron, which changes to the hydrous sesquioxide on exposure. All these strata are upheaved and thrown into flexures. This may be seen along the shores and in the street cuttings of the city around the base of Telegraph hill. The dips are variable, and range from 15░ to 60░, and in many places there is much contortion and folding of the strata. The extent and localities of this sandstone will be seen on the small geological map of the headlands ~hich accompanies this article, (Sketch No. 58.) It is found to constitute the principal islands of the bay and the projecting points of land around Sancelito,' and the outer point or headland , on the south side of the Golden Gate, (Point Lobos.) It has been quarried for building-stone at several places, the principal openings being at Yerba Buena, State's Prison, Angel island, and Marin island. The stone has a pleasing color, and in dry places is firm and durable, but will probably become rusty and decomposed where exposed to moist air. The geological age of this sandstone formation is not yet determined. It appears to be remarkably free from fossil remains, and, hitherto, with the exception of the fragments of 11lants in the form of lignite, the only fossil found in it near San Francisco is a species of spatangus of the genus Scutella, which was cast up on the beach from a submarine outcrop, and indicates a Tertiary age for the formation. This fossil occurs in a rock of similar mineral character to that of Point Lobos; and although the spatangi have not been found in situ, there is every rc~s?n to consider them as broken from the stril.ta. A group of softer strata are found at Bemcia, which are probably of the same series. They are much uplifted, and ci;mtain sharks' teeth and casts of shells of undoubted Tertiary age. d Metamorphosed roc~.-At several places on the peninsula of San Francisco, a peculiar,. har and flinty rock appears at the surface, and exhibits distinct stratification. It has a var:cty L colors, but a dark reddish brown is most common. It is much traversed by irregular verns or seams of quartz, and has a banded or belted structure, so that it resembles varieties of j.as~er. It is found near the Presidio, (about half way between the ocean and the bay,) near the ~ 1и8810?~ and on the northern shore of the entrance, where it forms the principal bluff, and exhibits it stratified character most distinctly. It is also found at the cinnabar mine of New Almaden, near San Jose.

All the characters of this rock, and its positions, indicate that it is an altered portion of the San Francisco sandstone formation. The stratification of this rock on the north side of the Golden Gate is best seen from the deck of a vessel or boat when passing in or out of the channel, the shores being so precipitous that it is impossible to land except at one or two points in little valleys or coves. The direction of the channel is directly transven;e to the trend of the rocks ; the edges of the strata are therefore exposed, and their dip and flexures are brought to view. This dip appears to be westerly, at an angle of forty degrees; several thick and hard beds form the crest of the highest hills, and outcrop there in long lines. At Lime Point the stratification is beautifully distinct and very uniform; the dip is nearly vertical, and in some places the most intricate plications of the strata are visible within the space of a few feet. Several high needle-shaped pinnacles of this rock rise from the waves at a short distance from the main bluff. Erupted 1иocks and serpentine.-At the base of the bluff of Lime Point, and on the eastern side along the shore of a little cove, a dark line may be observed near the tide-level, caused by the junction of the metamorphosed strata, with a black and hard intrusive rock of the trappean class. This line of junction appears to conform very nearly to the water-level, and indicates that the overlying rocks have been removed by the undermining action of the surf, until the more unyielding formation of crystalline rock was reached. The position of this erupted rock is shown on the map. Fort Point, which projects so boldly into the channel, is formed of a liard serpentinoid rock, containing distinct crystals of augite, and is evidently eru1Jtive. The outcrops of this rock are composed of loose rounded masses of a dark color, and often traversed with seams of amianthus ; a globular structure of the rock is thus indicated, and iR found to exist where deep excavations into the body of the rock arn made. rrhis was well shown in cutting away the bluff at the end of the point preparatory to the erection of fortifications. The whole rock consisted of a mass of spherical or spheroidal masses, incrusted with thin layers of green talcose rock, in a state of partial decomposition, resembling the lamellar portions of the serpentine of Hoboken, N. J., where it has been exposed to the weather. Outcrops of this serpentine are found at the Orphan Asylum and near the Mission. It is also abundant in the mountaius between San Jose and the ocean, (the San Francisco range.) This serpentine ridge is flanked on both sides hy the sandstone strata, and appears to have been intruded among them. A portion of the sandstone formation, consisting of beds of sandstone and shale, about 300 feet thick, are found included or imbedded in the serpentine ridge, and crop out in the bluff along the beach just east of the fort. Theyи do not exhibit any indications of having been heated, as their color is only a little darker than the portions outside of the serpentine; they, however, are a little more hard and compact. Alluvial deposites and sand-dune.s.-It is a curious and interesting fact, that the sand-beach between Fort Point and San Josef has been thrown up by the surf upon an extem;ive alluvial deposite, which has the character of a peat-bog or swamp. When the tide iR very low, the edge of this peat formation may be seen. Large masses of the peat are also broken out during storms, and thrown up on the sand of the beach. This sand, and all the loose round boulders, from three to eight inches or more in diameter rest u1Jon a foundation of the peat, and the . contmuation of the peat is 'found in 'the swamp or' flat meadow-land which lies inside of this belt of sand, and between it and the base of the sandstone hills. It is very difficult to account for the formation of this swamp under conditions like those at present existing. A strong current is constantly setting back and fortl1 through the channel, and the action of the surf constantly undermines and encroaches upon the bea~h, so that the present action is destructive, and the swamp could not possibly have been formed while the Golden Gate was open, as we now ftnd it. A .. similar peat-swamp is .found bordering Mission bay, between Rincon Point and I'oint San

Quentin, and is believed to underlie a part of Happy valley. Artesian borings in Happy valley have shown that the sand-dunes, which cover the surface there, rest upon a substratum of fine blue clay, which has been pierced to a depth of seventy-five feet, without showing any great variation in its composition. An equal thickness of SQft strata of fine clays and sand, with some pebbles, all evidently derived from the surrounding rocks, has been perforated in the borings, to ascertain the nature of the foundations for the new custom-house, outside of the ol<l shore-line of the city, in the cove between Clark's Point and Rincon Point. On the Contra Costa shores of the bay t11ere is a borcler of low fl.at land of alluvial or recent origin, which appears to have been derived in great part from the wash of the adjoining hills. It forms an almost contiimous margin, or shore, to the bay southward11 as far as the mouth of the little creek that drains the valley of San Jose, and empties into the bay at its southern extremity. At this point there is a wide extent of land of alluvial origin, and the shores are very muddy and shelving, so that large areas are left bare at low tide. Higher up the streams the low lands become rneauows, covered with grass, and resemble the broad salt meadows at the mouth of the Hackensack and Passaic rivers, in New Jenmy, and West and Quinnippiac rivers, in Connecticut. Sand-dunes.-The sand-dunes of the San Francisco peninsula are an important feature in its geology. They cover a large space in Happy valley, and, indeed, are found in every sheltered The persistent winds that pour in from the ocean nook in the depressions between the hills. raise the sands of the long beach south of Point Lobos, and carry them inland up the hill-side,; over bushes and dwarf oaks, so that hundreds of acres are covered and rendered desert-like. In Happy valley the dunes appear to be protected from the winds by the mountains, and here have probably attained their greatest elevation, which is believed not to exceed fifty feet. 'l'he hills are now coYered with dwarf oaks and shrubbery; but, where they are cut through to form streets, the lines of stratification produced by the winds are visible. The broad sand-beach, and the desert-like region lying directly east of it, form a conspicuous feature of the coast. The quantity of sand which has been driven inland from this beach is enormous, and its accumulation has greatly modified the topography of the peninsula. Another, but much more limited accumulation of blown sand, is found east of Point San Josef, arnl extends across to the eastern slope of Tonquin Point, over which it pours when the wind is high. This sand appears to be derived from the beach extending eastward from Fort Point. The limits of the principal formations along the entrance are shown on the small geological map. The sandstone strata are believed to extend from the serpentine ridge in a series of wavelike flexures under the bay to Yerba Buena; and beyond it, to the flanks of the Contra Costa range opposite the city. .и и
GEOLOGY OF POINT PINOS AND THE BAY OF MONTEREY.

Point Pinos is the first prominent headland of the coast south of Punta de los Reyes, ~nd, like this, consists of granite rock, which, by the resistance it offers to the surges of the P~cifi~, forms the outer wall or protecting barrier of the bay. It has already been stated that this pomt is the northern termination of a long and high mountain range-the Santa Lucia range-~h~ central axis of which is probably formed of granite rock similar to that of the point. Poin' Pinos has well-marked physical foatures, and is readily recognised on approaching the coas.t by the peculiar outline of its surface and the grey rocks and islets along its shores, differing from the rounded outlines and soft banks of sedimentary clays and sand which border the greater p~rt 8 of the coast further south. It it also characterized by a thick growth of pine trees covering 1'. 1 18 surface, and constituting a remarkable and peculiar feature on that almost treeless coast. ~ from this peculiarity that the point has received its name. These trees abound to the exclusiou of others, except on that portion of the promontory near the bay of San Carlos, where cypress trees are found. The limits within which these evergrefons extend, appear to -0oincide with the

boundaries of the granite formation. The rock formations adjoining the granite of the 1ioint, and underlying the city of Monterey, and forming llw hillH on th() msft<rn side of the bay, are composed of Tertiary strata of c1ay and sarnl. Thi~ formation liupports a growth of oaks, which contrast finely with the more pointed outlines of the pines. Granite.-Tbis rock is well exposed along the beach, between the landing at the custom-house anil the outside of the point. It extends out into the water in long lines of rock, producing numerous islets and It rocky unevi:n hott.om. Further inland it risi:s into low bluffs and isolated knobs, consisting chiefly of large weather-worn masses. The extent of this granite, and the dividing line between it and the Tertiary formation, is shown upon the map accompanying- this memoir. Quarries have been opened at one or two points along the beach ; t11e most extensive excavation иbeing at Point Almeja, or 1\fo~cle Point. The rock 1rns a light grey color, and a fine and even grain, the grey color being given by small crystals of black mica. It is, however, porphyritic, containing numerous large crystals of glas~y feldspar. Feldspathic veinR are also very common, traversing the rock in straight lines in different directions, some of them being nearly horizontal, and others l1ighly inclined. They vary in width from one to six inches or more, and are very coarse grained. These veins <lo not appear to affect the strength of the rock semilily. Wherever <lecomposition has taken place, the rock assumes a brown iron-rust color. Along the beach, where all the decayed parts are removed by the f\Urf, the surface is white and crumbling. After penetrating below the decomposed portiom, fine Rolid blocb can he obtain<:>d for building purposes. Stone is readily shipper] from this point to Ran Francisco, wliere it is usecl in the construction of the fort at Fort Point, nnd for paving the streets of the cit.y. Thi~ granite has al~o been used for the Point Pi nos light-house, and appenrs remarkah1r well. Tertiary strata.-The stratifiecl rockR which adjoin th\' granite of Point Pi nos are of Tertiary age, and present many intereAting peculiarities. The line of junction of the two formations is shown on the map, and cnincilles very nearly with the cnrvcии a small creek which winds along the baRe of the hill on which the fort is built. The Tertiary strata are of different colors, but are generally composed of fine materials, such as clay aml minute grains of sand closely impacted together, so that a rock resembling half-burned. crockery-ware is formed. This rock is sufficiently tough and firm to be wrought into Rrpmre blocks for building purposes. The ~fission church ~s constructed of it, and it appears to resist decomposition very well. The predominant color is a light yellow or <lrab, but some of the rocks are an olive-~reen. The strata rlo not rest horizontally, but have been disturbed, so that they present various degrees of inclination at different points. The angles of <lip, however, are not large: and in the city, where several quarries are Open, the inclination is less than 10░. This formation is remarka.ble at this point fol' the number of fossils it contains. 'l'he casts of ii small Tellina are found covering sr4uare yards of the argillaceous layers as they are broken out from the quarry, antl the same rock is frequently found charged with minute calcareous shells of polythalamia or foraminifera. They may be se:n by th!i naked eye, but the microscope is required to twee out their form and structure. Higher up in the series of beds, and at a point about two miles southeast of the fort, thick white be~s resembling chalk are found cropping out on the side of a hill. This outcrop forms a consp:cuous object in the scenery of the shore-line of the bay ; appearing as a white spot in the midst of a dense growth of green chamisal or dwarf oaks and larrea. It is readily seen from the town and the anchorage in the bay. 'fhese oods are chiefly compoi>ed of fine white cfay and silex, with innumerable silicious skeletons of marine infusoria. ~rnong these microscopic skeletons the genus Coscinodiscus is well represented, and beautiful obJect.s for the m.ieroscope can be readily obtained. According to Professor Bailey, this cleposite <X>nta.ins numerous species only recently found to be living in the Pacific, and some which could Only have g.rown in shallow water.

The total or combined thickness of the white infusorial beds is seventy-five feet, and there are probably many more beds below, which were not measured. This estimate is exclusive of the compact silicious beds, which are also fossiliferous and very curious, several being as compact as semi-opal, and breaking with a conchoidal fracture like glass. On the top of this deposite there is a well-defined accumulation of beach pebbles, and worn fragments of the infusorial beds are found among them. This beach and the fossils are now over 300 feet above the bay, and they show conclusively that great changes in the form of the highlands or mountain ranges of the California coast have taken place since the Tertiary epoch. The comparatively recent action of the sea is also shown on the surfaces of the strata about Monterey ; they are much worn and smoothed, and the round perforations of the boring shells may be found under the beach-sh. .}e and soil.
CYPRESS POINT A.ND BAY OF SAN CARLOS.

l. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.

Cypress Point is about five miles south of Point Pi nos, and is formed of a similar granite rock. The shore-line between the two points is also of granite, forming a bold rocky shore, with an o~ casional small cove, anrl a beach of white sand derived from the abrasion of the granite. Thrn point forms the northern boundary of the small bay of San Carlos, which appears to be merely a re-entering angle in a depression of tl1e granite, this rock being also found on the southern side of the bay. It there rises in bluffs, and is much :fissured and broken, so that several small coYcs arc formed. The position of these outcrops of granite, and the general trend of the range, indicate that the bottom of tl1is bay, or its entrance, is rocky and very uneven. It is probab'.e that, in many places, pinnacles of granite rise near to the surface. On the northern side of t_his bay, east of Cypress Point, strata of a coarse conglomerate are exposed, and rest upon the granite. The inclination of these strata is very slight, and at that place they do not appear t<l have been uplifted by the granite. On the southern side of the bay, however, a similar conglomerate and sandy strata are exposed, and are much hardened and consolidated as if by heat and pressu.re. The conglomerate at this place forms the outermost point of the co1:tst, and is known as Pomt Lobos. It consists entirely of a very thick mass of water-worn boulders, and pebbles from one inch to eight inches in diameter, and remarkably free from finer materials. These boulders arc, however, :firmly cemented together-so firmly, that it is almost impossible to detach one r:~m tl!e mass. The strata are very thick, and dip eastwardly. No granite or erupted rock is yisible .1n the immediate vicinity. This conglomerate is so hard that it resists the action Qf the most vii: lent waves of the Pacific, and it is constantly bathed in a heavy surf. Several small islets of tbi~ 0 rock rise from the water a short distance from the point and are frequented by vast nm:nber~ action . h ' и d sea-1ions, w ose roar may be heard above the noise of the breaking surf The contmue и i! layers of the water has gradually worn caverns in the softer parts of the strata., and the ur111er

project over the waves. Some of these caverns extend into the strata for long distances, and the tumultuous rushing of the waters may be witnesseJ through openings from above. The granite rocks do not appear in connection with the conglomerate: they are further inland. There is, however, reason to believe that the conglomerate of the northern side of the bay is of the same age, and that this granite is newer. No fossils were seen in or near the conglomerate, but I was inclined to consider it of tertiary age. Xear one of the quarries on the south side of the bay, the line of contact between a sandstone and the granite is visible, and, although there is no great alteration or baking of the strata due to heat, the relative position of the two formations indicates that the granite is the most recent and intrusive. I was not, however, able to extend my observations so as to determine this interesting questi(ln to rny satisfaction. The pebbles and rocks of the conglomerate arc chicH~и of the erupted class, being trap and porphyries of various textures and colon;. At the upper end of the bay the shores are low and formed of al1nvial d<>posits. These border a small stream called the Cannella, for two or three miles, and afford broad and very fertile fiel<ls for cultivation. The mission of San Carlos is situated on the hank of this small river.
SAN J,UIS OBISPO AND SANTA BARBARA.

These ports are merely open hays or slight curvatures of the coast line at the base or side of high and ruggeJ ranges of mountains. The shore line at both places is formed by the edges of nearly horit1ontal strata of tertiary or post tertiary age. The erosion of the sea has worn these deposits away by gradually undermining them, so that at some placeR bluff banks from twenty to fifty feet, or mon-, in height are produced. These are generally of a ligl1t color, and the strata are not firmly consolidated. Layers of fossil shells are found about. twenty foct above the tide-level. They ha\иe a littoral aspect, and indicate a comparatively recent elevation of the coast. 'l'hey are, in all respects, similar to the fossils obtained at San Pedro, and presently to be described. The illope which flanks the mountains at Santa Barbara, and extends to the beach, is probably composed of terи tiary strata, covered, especially at the upper portion, by the loose drift or wash from the adjoining mountains. The town is built on this slope, and the observatory of the survey is also npon it; it terminates in front of the town in a broad sandy beach, and its lowest portions are partly occupied by an irregularly shaped pond or laguna, called El Estero, which is bordered by alluvial deposits. The mountains rise abruptly in the rear of the town, and present a rugged, desolate appearance. They are) probably) composed of uplifted strata of sandstone, like that of San Francisco, and are probably of tertiary age. The peculiarly rugged and sharp outlines of these mountains cau 8e them to resemble volcanic r~ks when viewed from a distance, but there is no reason to believe that volcanoes exist there; on the contrary, there is good reason to consider the rocks as sandstone. The mountains, however, bear a great resemblance to those further south, which are found to be entirely of granite and the allied rocks. In that climate the gneiss and laminated rocks of the granitic class become weathered into singularly rugged and sharp outlines, and often form conical peaks, which, seen from a distance, are readily imagined to lm volcanic.
GEOLOGY OF SAN PEDRO AND ITS VICINITY.

~he hay of San Pedro is the most important between Monterey and San Diego. Unlike the ot er bays or coves between these two places, it is formed by a curve in the margin of an ;xt:nded low plain, or gentle slope of the land, and is not rock-bound or protected by the pro;~cting rocks of mountain ranges. The only high ground in the vicinity is a rounded swell of ie s~rface north of the landing. This hill stands isolated from any range, and its base on the '\Vest 18 washed by the Pacific, and on the e~st is bordered l;>y the low and nearly level plain.

It thus stanJs like an island, and a depression of the coast for about fifty feet would cause it to
be surrounded by water. The shore of the bay consists of bluff, precipitous banks from forty to sixty feet high, whicii are constantly being undermined by the action of the waves. They are formed of sedimentary strata, lying in nearly horizontal planes, and greatly cliffering in their mineral characters; some of them are almost wholly formed of clay, others of soft sandstone, and others of a more compact fine ror:k, formed by the mingling of the two materials. With the expeption of some beds at the base of the series they are all light colored, and have a modern appearance. The lower and dark colored bed8 are bituminous, and emit a strong odor of the substance wl1en struck by the hammer. Tl1is bituminous mass is thin] y stratified, and is, in fact, a mass of clayshales, which are soft and plastic where washed by the ticle. They are exposed along the shore, the base of the series being below the surface of the water, but the upper limit rising at places to a height five feet or more above it. The best exposure is found on the projecting point nearly opposite the small island near the shore, called "Dead Man's island." Above the1rn bituminous shales the argillaceous beds are charged in many places with nodular masses, or concretfons of oxide of iron ; thPy are seen to protrude from the face of the bank in long lines. The clay is also much stained by the infiltration of ferruginous waters. Between the point spoken of and the lanJ.ing, the upper part of the beach under the cliff, is strewn with large tabular blocks of sandstone, of a brown color, and evidently derived from the wear of the bank. They lie piled together in considerable quantities, and resist the continued action of the surf very well. These blocks present on their surfaces peculiar markings or reticulations, which are readily recognised as sun-cracks, and are precisely similar in appearance fo those often found on the slabs of red sandstone in the quarries of New Jersey and Connecticut. They also resemble the deep cracks produced in the clay soils of California by the sun and air, after the wet season. It would thus appear, that at the time of the deposition of this stratum of Randstone it was alternate1y a Love and below the surface of tlie water, and it may have been the surface layer of a broad shelving beach. The edges of all these strata, as exposed in the bank, arc slightly bent, and form curved Jines with a large radius; at one place, however, near the point between the landing and the mouth of the Los Angeles river, more abrupt and s1rnr1) f!exurR were seen, and indicated considerable disturbance or lateral pressure of the beds. There iB also evidence of an anti-clinal axis of the strata, the series having a general dip each way from the point. The direct.ion of the axis of the dip or of the flexure is nearly N. 50░ W., and thus conforms with the general direction of the coast and the longer axis of the hill. No igneoUR or erupted rocks were seen, but their presence in the vicinity, or not far below the surface, ~'as suspected. Dead Man's island, which is a mass of rocks a short distance off the shore, rises nearly in the line of trend of this point, and may prove to be of igneous origin, but I was ~ot able to visit it. It is interesting to note the fact of the :rn-esence of these rocks in a line with the axis of disturbance of the sedimentary beds. It becomes an interesting point to determine the character of the rocks forming the summi~ of the hills; from external appearance alone, they would be considered as sedimentary, am not very hard. . 11 The geology and the topography unite here in indicating the existence of a line of elevat10и in the ocean-bed, in the direction of the main axis of the hill forming Puint Fermin. It ~s probable that this will be detected by soundings, if the currents have not so far :filled up t e bay with sand and sediment that the ridge-like character of the elevation is obliterated. 1 1 Near the mouth of the Los Angeles river, and just beyond the tide-register, the banks of\ : coast are lower, and consist chiefly of a coarse sea or river sand in regular layers; nearbtli и 1s are found m . layers from .c и и k . t" sur f:ace, coarser mat.ena wur to six feet thic , cons1s mg of peb " es t and fossil-shells mingled together and mixed with sand; above these, we nnd about three teet of soil, also charged with shells.

deposit, which is, without doubt, Post Tertiary, or Quarternary. Its littoral character is evident from the fossils, many of them being much worn, antl imbedded in a mafls of eomminuted fragments resulting from the action of the surf of fonner ages. The.so foflsils were rcforred to )fr. T. A. Conrad, of Philadelphia, and his description of them~ with the fi;;ures, will be found in the writer's report of a geological reconnaissance in California.* The following are the names of several species obtained at this locality: Tellina pedroana, Venerupis aycladiformis, Saxiaava abrupta, Petricola pedroana, Schizotlza:rus .,.Vutalli, Mytilus pedroanu.s, Penitella spelceum, Fissurella crenulata, Crepidula princcps, Nassa иinterstriata, N. pcdroarm, Strephona pedroana, Littorina pcdroana. Jn addition to these shells the tooth of a mammoth was taken from this bank. It was rrocured by a brother of Capt. Ord, of the Coast Survey, who kinrlly ii laced it in my hands for examination. It is a lower molar of an extinct elephant, (Elephas pri1nogenius ?) and weighs eight pounds. I regard this deposit of sand and shells as more recent than the sandstone and bituminous Rtrata of the bluffs, but these ]aRt are doubtless Tertiary. No fossils were found in them; but in the interior, beyond Los An~eles, similar strata are upheaved and traversed by erupted trappean rocks, and fossils of the tertiary period were found there. The same beds probably underlie the whole broad slope extending from the Bernardino Sierra to the sea, and are the repositories of great quantities of bitumen which exudes from the surface in many places, and forms springs or lakes. These deposits are known as tar springs, and the residents of Los Angeles U'iC large quantities of the material for making roofa and pa Yemen ts. Large masses of bitumen in great black sheets are frequently met with by navigators off San Pedro or its vicinity, and northward in Santa Barbara channel. 'fhis may be derived from Aubmarine springs, or it may float down some of the streams from the interior. I am also informed by Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge, U.S. Engineers, and connected with the survey, that the channel of Santa Barbara is sometimes conred with a film of mineral oil, giving to the surface of the water the beautiful prismatic hues seen when oil is poured on water . . The odor of bitumen, or petroleum, is often perceptible to the mariner along the coast when m the vicinity of the springs, and in places it is so distinct, that if the positions of all the ~}irings were known, it woui<l serve as an excellent land-mark or guide during fogs. The floatи ing masses of bitumen may serve a similar end, but they are liable to be carried to great clistances from their source by the currents, and thus their value as an index. of any precise lc'.cality is lost. The odor of bitumen, however, is only perceptible near the springs, but the distance at which it is distinct will, of course, be determined by the direction and force of the wind.
UEMARKS O.N TH.Io: GEOLOGY OF TUE l3AY OF SAN DIEtlO AND ITS VICIXITY.

'.l'he ~bores of the bay of San Diego offer little of marked interest to the geologist. The only formations present to view are loose and unconsolidated st.rata of clays and sand, forming on tli.e left of the entrance a series of rounded hills, riRing to the elevation of from 200 t,i 400 feet. Like the hill at San Pedro thev stand alone or isolated at the lower edge, or sea-margin, of ~broad and remarkably reg~lar ~lope, which flanks the inland range of mountains, and extends 10 { m them to the sea. In addition to these stratified hills, we find, nearer the town, the alluvial ( epo 5its of the river, and extensive beadies and bars of fine, river and sea sand. ~he strata of the hill which forms Punta Loma are much cut away and undermined by the action of the surf, so that their edges are brought to view, and a slight inclination or dip is ~een.

the old to,,иn and Mission of San Diego, horizontal strata of tertiary age are seen outcropping along the bank of the stream. These strata are nearly horizrmtal, or exhibit but slight flexure~. Numerous fossil shells were obtained near the 1Iissiuu, sufiicient to characterize the depi)8it~ as tertiary; among them are the following species : Cmиdiwn mode8tum, Nucula dccisa, Corbulo Dieqoana, Tell-ina congesta, Macira Diegoana, Ncitica Dfogoana, and Trochita Diegoa.na. Further inland, eit~t and northeast of the mission, outbursts oftrnppean rocks are found, and beyond them the granite formations which compose the mass of mountains between Бan Diego anrl the head of tbe Cnlifornia gulf. The upper layer or surface of the slope from the mountain iH composed in rno~t plnceA of bcach-Ahingle, tl1e pebblet> being well rolled and water-worn. The st.reams whir:h course over t1rn Rlo1Je, or rather which run iri the numerous rnvines wnrE below its general lPvel, bring down large quantities of saml, and de1losit it in the harbor, thuR gradually filling it np. The attempt has been made to turn this riYer into a channel which it formerly occupied, and whiel1 opened into the sea north of the present harbor and Point Ijorna. The broad fiats on the right or f'ast siLle of the entrance to the bay, are formed wholly of sea or beach rnnd thrown np by the waves. This deposit is very deep, and there is no indication of former formatiom;. The little map or general sketch of San Diego bay published by the Survey, exhibits, in a most ueautiful manner, the topography and character of the gurface, and from it the outlines oi' the different geological formations can be readily traced; indeed, by using the topographical signs employed there to represent the geological formations, and Jlroviding an index to them, it would become a 1eautiful gc>ological map, and at the same time retain its topographical value. The geologicid map (Sketch Ko. 60) which accompanies this memoir, represents not only the gecиlogy around San Diego, but of a wide area west of it, a8 far as tbe Colorado river. This region will be fully described in the author's report on the geology _of California,
GEOLOGY OF THE ISLANDS NEAR TUE COAST.

Very little is yet known respecting the nature of the rocks forming the islands lying off the coast from Los Corona<los, at San Diego, to the Farallones, at San Francisco. Not having visited either of them, it is not possible to speak definitely or positively of their geological character, but their appearance leads to the belief that they are composed of metamorphosed sandstones and shales, and of trappean rocks. They all have a most barren, forbidding appearance to t11c mariner; they are nearly treeless, and in the dry season look like masses of mer~ rocks. T11e rocks of the groups south of Point Conception have a dark drab or brownish-yellow color, and show traces of stratification which has been much disturbed. The sketch of the harbor of Santa Catalina by Mr. l\IcMnrtrie, and published l)y the Survey, presents some rcmar~ able appearances, indicating to the geologist the presence of stratified rocks in a higl1ly ~i~ tnrbed state. Indeed, the presence of a great thickness of strata dipping northwest at a high angle is distinctly shown. A difference in the hardness of the strata is also exhibited by the peculiar notched and irregular sky-outline of the hill on the left of the entrance, the elevated points corresponding with the rib-like prominence on the side of the hill. The sketch also shows a distinct and regular dip of the strata, especially at the left or northerly side of the entrance, while on the right or south side, the hill rises much higher, and the outcrops of the rock are not so distinct ; the same general clip or inclination of the strata is, however, observa~ ble. The island ill remarkable for a great transverse break or channel running partly throng it, forming an anchorage. It is probable that this cleft or depression is along the crest of a great fold of the strata, the folding having been carried to such an extent as to bring the beds on both sides of the axis of flexure into parallelism, while they are all turned or pressed _ovd~r . th s JD Jи towards the southeast or south. A lateral riressure or force acting from the north is u he cated, a plicution having been produced exactly similar to that characterizing the ranges oft Apalachians, and so distinctly revealed to geologists by the joint labors of the :Messrs. Rogers.

The great va1ue of accurate sketches of coast scenery, when the topogra1Jhy is given in detail, could scarcely be more clearly shown than in this instance. Aside from the importance of such ~ketcl1es in enabling the navigator, who may l1ave never visited the coast, to recognise his position at once, the sketch under consideration not only authorizes valua1le deductions respecting the rocks, their sedimentary character, and 11eological age, but we are enabled to recognise a grand dynamical result, hitherto unobseTYed west of the Rocky mountains. Cortez shoal.-The probable volcanic character of the Cortez s1rnal has been adverted to, but there is little reason to regard it as a single peak or cone of igneous rocks. It is possible that the phenomena witnessed by Captain Cropper were not volcanic, and that the ap1mrent spouting of' the water at intervals was merely the breaking of the waYes on a reef. He, ho1rcver, was confident that the commotion иwas of a different kind, and that the tlepth of water was reduced from forty-two to nine fathoms. It is, however, not improbable that the phenomena were volcanic, for the adjoining coast is subject to frequent earthquake shocks, and two or more flalses or mud vo1canoes have burst out at different times in the valle;v of the Co1orai1o desert, in almut the same latitude. vVhatever the natnre of the materials producing the disturbance and elevation, (which possibly was only apparent,) whether igneous ~r due to the decomposition of substances contained in the rocks, producing steam and a consequent explosion, it is doubtless the fact, that the outburst was at the summit of a ridge-like elevation, conforming in general direction with the adjoining islands and coast, and composed of similar rocks. This Yiew is strengthened by the recent discoYery of a ledge of rocks near the shoal by Lieutenant J\Ia.cRae. The phenomena attending the discovery of this i:;hoal were not unlike those presented hy the eruption of Graham island in the Mediterranean. The captain of a Sicilian vessel reported that, as he passed near the place in July, 1831, where the island afterwards appeared, he saw a column of water like a water-spout, tiO feet high and 800 yards in circumJeren~e, rising from the sea, and soon afterwards a dense steam in its place. On his return a week after, he found a small island twelve fret high, with a crater in its centre. Thi& island afterwards reached the beight of 200 feet, with a circumference of three miles, but then began to diminish in size by the action of the waves, until, in the latter part of October, no vestige of the crater remained, and the is1and was -nearly levelled with the surface of the ocean. It was reported that, at the commencement of the following year, (1832,) there was a depth of 150 feet where the i:sla.nd had been; but this account was quite erroneous, for in the early part of that year Captain Swinburne found a shoal and discolored water there, and towards the end of 183:~ a dangerous reef existed of an oval figure, about three-fifths of a mile in extent.* The peculiar spouting up of the water in columns observed by Captain Cropper, together with his observation of the change in the form of the bottom, are the only evidences of the vdcanic character of the disturbance. It is, however, possible that the depth has always l>een sligl1t over the Cortez shoal, and that it remained unnoticed up to the time of the eruption, or the breaki~g of the waves. If an eruption did take place, the depth was very probably lessened, but the subsequent action of the sea may have removed all the accumulation, and even produced a greater depth than before.
FARALLONES ISLANDS.

The Farallones are separated from those just under consideration by more than three and a half degrees of latitude, and they border a portion of the coast with a very different trend. V\.,. e have already seen that they are nearly in the line of prolongation of Point Pi nos, and this fact leads to the belief that they are likewise of granite. Point Reyes, nearly abreast of them, being of granite, lends support to this conclusion. These suppositions arn verified by the observati~ns of Lieutenant Trowbridge, who visited the islands last May, by direction of the Sunиey. In his letter to the Superintendent, he describes the South Farallon as an "immense dyke of

398

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

granite, running in the direction of the coast." It rises to the height of three hundred ancl thirty feet, and presents a mass of broken and jagged rocks, so much shattered and softened tlrnt "the whole could be separated into small fragments with a pick and crow-bar." (See Sketch No. 46.) These small rocky islands, rising al>ove the waste of waters so far from the main laud, are certainly a remarkable physical feature. It is probable that the gmnite was originally flanked by stratified rocks, much softer and more yielding to the powerful action of the sea, and which are now washed away. и
GBNERAL REMARKS ON THE ISLANDS SOl"TII OF POINT CONCEPTION.

Most of the islands bordering and south of, the Santa Barbara channel present interesting examples of the wearing action of the sea upon the rocks which compose them. Great cans are hollowed out in the son layers of roe!;:, while the harder beds form arched roofs, and reverberate the thunder-like sounds of the heating surges. Circular openings are frequently forced through their walls of rock, and huge arched gateways are formed for the rush of the waters. The small island of Anacapa bas a fine ar~h of rock at its eastern extremity, a beautiful ancl accurate drawing of which has been made by the SurYcy.* Alcatraz island, on the bay of San Francisco, has a cavern of considerable size in its northern encl, jnst at the water-line, and there are many other examples on the coast. In the absence of positive knowledge of the geology of these islarnls, we may consider that the rocks bear a general resemblance in their mineral characters to those of the ranges, or heights, of the adjoining parallel coasts. Thus, from north of Los Angeles and San Fernando, southward to San Diego, we find ri<lges of trappean rocks in contact with upraised stratified sandstone, flanking the higher and more extended sierras of granite. Between San l'edro and P(lint Conception, thi:s border, or belt, of upbcaved stratified rocks is not found; the granite ranges come down to the very beach, but it is most in accordance with the })henomena. to regard the outlying submerged range as corresponding in general character with those which flank the granite further south. The peculiar rusty-drab color presented by the sandstone of San Francisco, wherever exposed to the action of salt water, is seen on the shores of nearly all the islands of the Santa Barbara channel and it:s vicinity ; and this identity of color in the weathered rocks, together with the evidences of stratification and upheaval, leads me to consider their synchronous origin extremely probable.

There were but twenty-two pounds of steam on when the boiler exploded, although the lisual quantity used, иwhen running, was twenty-eight pounds, anrl it was thought that thirty pounds could have been carried. By this disaster, I regret to say that three l1ersom:: werP scalded to rleatl1, viz: :\Ir. Samuel C. Latimer, third assistant engineer U.S. N., 'Vm. Bulger, first-class fireman, and Bernard l\Ioran, seaman. Six others are ~erions]y injured-some, I fear, fatally-whose names are as follows: vVi1liam Gardner, first-class fireman, Benjamin Yan Horn, second-class fireman, John T. Knight, second-class fireman, David E. Marshall, quartermaster, Coleman vVe1sh, ordinary seaman, Michael Scanlan, ordinary seaman. I was slightly scalded b~- the explosion. Third Assistant Engineer Samuel C. Latimer, whose sudden and unfortubate death I have mentioned above, was a young man of great promiRe, far a hove mediocrity, gentlemanlr, and intelligent, possessing an exalted sense of honor, and the higheRt sense of dnty. His removal from among us on board the Hetzel is sadly and deeply deplored hy his messmates and shipmates. The hurricane-deck, wheel-house, and bulk-beans around the boiler are a perfect wreck, as also the smoke-stack, steam-pipe, and some other parts. I immediately des11atched an officer (Pasi;;ed 1\lidsl1ipman 1\IcGary) to the main land, distant seven miles, with orders to proceed to Cherrystone inlet, and from thence to Norfolk, to make known the condition of the Hetzel to Commodore 1\IcKeever, requesting him to send the steamer Enqineer to our relief, so that the vessel might be towed to Old Point Comfort, where I will await your communications. This afternoon, a fair wind setting in, with the aid of the tide, and boats towing, we were enabled to reach a safe anchorage inside of 8and shoal. The scalded have been removed to houses on shore, w11ere they are receiving every attention from Passed Assistant Surgeon Williamson, of this vesbel, and from a meflical gentleman on shore, who happened to be liere on a visit. Coffins are being made, and other preparations for hurying the dead. I presume that you will address a communication to the Treaimry Department, which will be transmitted to the Navy Department, in regard to the persons killed and wounded. In my next communication, I will state what, in my opinion, can and ought to be done with the Hetzel, and venture some suggestions in regard to the manner of prosecuting the "иork assigned me for this season.

The men, who have thus met an untimely fate, were all e.xcellent in character, l1elmved well, performed their duty faithfully, and were good citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth, where their families reside.

The wind and sea were both setting, as usual on the coast, square on to the shore, but not unusually strong. At 8.10 p. m. the vessel was reported as dragging, wheu the other anchor was immediately let go and additional chain veered out, hut before bringing up, the vmssel wall in the breakers, with her keel striking heavily; and in this manner she rode until 1.30 a. m., when the starboard chain parted, and the vessel commenced setting in towards the beach. We discharged the water, and threw overboard a quantity of sand ballast, to lighten and enable her to beat through the heavy outer breakers. This she did effectually, for by daylight we were high and dry on the beach, about a hundred yards to the east of San Bernard river. Our port anchor-the one first let go-came home, and on heaving it up the stock was found broken. Thus we were left without an anchor to haul off by. As no assistance whatever could be had from San Bernard, an officer was despatched forthwith on foot to Y elasco to procure ground tackle: and on the following day a small schooner with two kedges and hawsers came to our relief. These were led out and a strain brought upon them, but the vessel remained immovable. The anchors being too light, came home, and no others could be procured at Y elasco. Mr. Walker was now despatched by land to Galveston, where he fortunately found the schooner Belle, and, a couple of good anchors having been shipped, she proceeded at once to our relief, and reached us on the morning of the 22d. With much difficulty, owing to the heavy swell, we got the anchors planted, and the end of a strong hawser attached to them on board the Arago, and by keeping a constant and heavy strain upon it the vessel gradually worked her way through the sand, which had by that time formed outside of her. At high water on the 25th I was relieved by finding the Arago once more afloat outside of the breakers, and apparently not injured to any extent. There was still, however) much hard work required to render her efficient. All our material from truck to keelson "Tas on shore, and was yet to be boated off through a dangerous surf. The boats were capsized occasionally, but the alacrity and perseverance of officers and men overcame all difficulties, and the vessel was equipped and under way by the 27th. We anchored at Galveston the same night.

The adaptation to this branch of service, which was shown in your former connection with the survey, has again been strongly marked, with the advantage of increased experien.ce in its 01ierations. The character of service which you have rendered is that which military habits and experience, and strong military bias, would naturally render most acceptable to an officer, and I have not seeu among the accomplished officers of the Coast Survey one who could surpass you, and but two who could rival you, in reconnaissance. It is a source of congratulation to me, that while you have shrunk from no exposure on this 8ervice., your health has steadily improved, and that the disastrous consequences of your wound at the battle of Molino were averted, as I believe, by the character of the duty in which you have been engaged. To your hard-earned reputation as a soldier you have added whatever reputation is to be acquired l>:>' the most successful discharge of Coast Survey duty. This expression of opinion I propose tn place on file in the Treasury Department, under which you have served, and to request the Secretary to communicate it to the Hon.

From its disagreeable, if not ruinous circumstances, Lieutenant Alden felt the importance of succoring the detachment, and, while executing his purpose, he set aside hii:; immediate occupation. lnAtances of like conduct renew the assurance, from time to time, that the chivalrous fame of the Kavy cannot be clouded, and show that the incalculable usefulness and renown of the United States Coast Survey can extend with occasion, while its officers have the capacity to take the highest view of their duty. To the surgeon of the Active, for attention to the sick, and to the other officers for their interest in rendering the detachment comfortable on board a ship not at all intended for a transport, the undersigned presents his unfeigned acknowledgments.

HENRY PRINCE, 11lajor Brevet U. S. Army, Commanding Post.

COAST SURVEY STEAMER HETZEL,

Old Point Comfort, Va., June 18, 1855. Srn: I have received yours of the 14th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Secretary of the Light-house Board, requesting a tracing of York Spit and vicinity, showing the position of the nine-foot spot, and soliciting such other information as I may be able to give upon the practicability of placing a light-house instead of a light-boat at that point. Herewith I transmit the tracing, as requested, upon which the nine-foot spot (at low tide) will be plainly seen. The average rise and fall of tide here is two and a half feet, which will give eleven and a half foet at high water. The character of the bottom is fine light-gray sand, fine white g1иavel, and black specks, in which sand greatly predominates. , It strikes me as being a feasible matter to erect a screw-pile light-house here. I deem it very important that a light of some kind be placed here as soon as practicable; or even a d~y beacon or a lar:Ie buoy to guide vessels in and out of York river. At present there is no g~ide of any kind except the compass and the lead, with a rough estimate of distances. There 18 a great sameness in the appearance of the woods and trees at the mouth of York river, so as to make it extremely difficult to obtain land-marks ; and if they are found and nse1l the present year, they may be gone the next year, as then' ii; so much cutting down and clearing of woods in that vicinity. There is an extensive wood trade from York river. * * * * I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, JOHN J. ALMY, Lieutenant U. S. Navy, Assistant in Coast Survey. Prof. A. D. BACFIR,

Srn: There are several points on the coastиot East Florida which require lights, land-marks,
an<l buoys, as aids to navigation.

1. Beacon about midway between St. Augustine and Cape Canaveral. 2. Beacon-light at Mosquito inlet. 3. Beacon-light at Indian River inlet. 4. Beacon at Hillsboro'. Buoys are required in the channel way between Florida reef and the keys. 1. Buoy on Margot Fish shoals, off Elliott's key. 2. Buoy on "Hen and Chickens," about three miles and a half southwest of Tavernier key. 3. Buoy on seven-foot shoal at the northeast entrance of the channel abreast of Key Vacas. When this channel, from Cape Florida through to the Tortugas, becomes well marked and known, it must in future years be the great thoroughfare of coasting steamers. In connection with the subject 1 will call attention to the light on Cape Canaveral) which is decidedly one of the worst on our coast. The light is hardly visible at six miles, and then only to the careful observer, as the duration of its flash is only about seven seconds, and the periods of eclipse very long. It should be a first-class light, and there is no reason why it should be revolving. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, T. A. CRAVEN, Lie-;;tena.nt U. S. Navy, Assistant in Ooa.st Survey.

Several experienced and intelligent resident pilots concur with me in regard to the necessity for this aid to navigation, and they have suggested, also, that the general navigation of Matagorda bay would be greatly facilitated by a light placed on Half-M:oon reef. " A more minute examination of these localities should be made before deciding upon the character of the lights to be adopted.

REPORT OF THE SUPli1RINTENDENT
OLYMPIA,

W. T., December 21, 1854.

DEAR Sm: I will respectfully call your attention to a letter from Capt. Hunt, of the steamer "Major Tompkins," a copy of which is herewith enclosed, setting forth the importance of a light on Point -W'ilson, at the entrance to the water of the sound, and I will request that should you concur with Capt. Hunt as to the necessity of the light proposed, you will, as early as practicable, report for the information of the secretary of the Light-house Board, so that action in Congress may be had at its present session. Very truly, yours, ISAAC I. STEVENS, Governor of Washington Territo1-y. Lieut. Comg. JAMES ALDEN, U. S. N., Coast Sun:ey Steam.er Active.

Or,YMPIA, December 14, 1854. Sm: Having been engaged for some time past in the navigation of Puget's sound as commander of the steamer "11Iajor Tompkins," my attention has been directed to the want of a light-house, in addition to the two already orclered by government, which would, I think, secure vessels bound into the sound from all the dangers not provided against by the light on Dungeness spit, and that proposed for Smith's island. The two sites just named are most judiciously chosen, as the localities are dangerous at night to vessels bound either into Puget's sound, or through Rosario staits to Bellingham bay, and, at present, ship-masters sailing either way make a wide detour, or heave to until day-light. The most exi)erieuced can make no certain calculations as to their position where the tides are so strong and irregular. The usual course for vessels bound into the sound, from the entrance to the Straits of Fuca, is east half south (magnetic,) which would bring them along (with a leading breeze) on the southern shore as far as Dungeness spit, and with a strong ebb-tide probably inside of it. This the establishment of the light at that point will enable them to avoid. From the spit to the shore is entirely clear, and the course is plain to Point Wilson, at the entrance of the sound, and distant from Dungeness spit sixteen miles. This point is cxceeedingly foul, without any holdingground that can be relied on, and in bad weather it is extremely dangerous. It is here I would respectfully suggest the placing of a light, for the benefit of those trading upon the sound proper. A light of the third magnitude would be, sufficient, as the channel is cornparati~ely narrow. It would greatly benefit all interested in shipping on these waters, as, after passi~g Point Wilson safely, harbors frequently occur in which the ground is good, and where, with the wind from any quarter, vessels may ride in security in a moderate depth of water. The opinion I have taken the liber(y to give is in consonance with that of all nautical men with whom I have conversed on the subject, and I trust it may appear to your Excellency of sufficient importance to make it a matter of correspondence with the authority at WaEthington that may have power in the premises. With great respect, I remain, sir, your obedient servant, JAMES M. HUNT, Commanding Steamer <'Major Tompki'T!S." lsAAC I. STEVENS, Esq., Governor of W Mhinyton Territory.

Sm: I have the honor to enclose, herewith, extracts from a general report recently made by .Assistant George Davidson, containing suggestions relative to the establishment of light-houses and other aids to navigation on the Western Coast. As the conclusions presented are, in each case, the result of personal observation and in.quiry made by Assistant Davidson, while engaged in the regular work of triangulation on that coast, I would respectfully request that the extracts, as bearing upon the important subject of a general system of lights for the coast of California, and Oregon and Washington Territories, may be transmitted to the Light-house Board. Very respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon. JAMES GUTHRIE, Secretary of the Treasury. Extracts from a general report rnade to tho Sup~rintendent of tlie Coast Survey, by Assistant George Davidson. Point Wilson.-" .A light-house is necessary at Point Wilson,* north of Point Hudson. The first named is the northwest point at the entrance of the bay called 'Port Townsend,' Admiralty inlet." Smith's island, Washington Territory.-" There is urgent need for a light-house on this island. [See Appendix No. 83.J It lies south of the entrance to Rosario strait, is quite small, and rises gradually from the eastern side to the western, where it attains a height of about fifty feet, with almost perpendicular bluffs of clay and gravel. The surface is covered with~ growth of bushes ten or twelve feet high, but these could easily be burnt off. The soil sustams a few trees, but none of great thickness or height. Digging to the depth of a very fow feet will bring the builder to a good foundation. There is no water on the island. Good anchorage is found at the norиth side, between Smith's and Minor islands, which, at one point, become connected at very low water." Ediz Point and New Dungeness.-" There should be large and easily recognisable beacons on Ediz Point and New Dungeness, as the spits are long, low, and narrow, and vessels may be almost upon them before they can be aware." Tatoosh island.-" A light-house of the first class should be placed on Tatoosh, which lies a short distance seaward of Cape Flattery, at the southern part of the outer entrance to the straits of ~uau de Fuca. The highest part of the island rises about a hundred feet above low water. A light eighty-five foot high would show on the horizon at a distance of eighteen miles, so that veBBels before rea.ching Flattery rocks would be able to see it from a height of thirty feet above th? water. The angle of visibility from the land south around to the extreme visible western po1tf ' .eame starting point, around and up n Vancouver's island is 131' degrees and from the the Straits of Fuca., 263 de(J';ees. ' of~ The. island is a conglo~erate, rising perpendicularly; but one reef is ?a~alt. is destitute .00d, affords but little water, and that found ie not good; yet the soil is cultivated by the 1 i:dians, W:h-0 resort to the island in summer, about a hundred and fifty strong. The only landg place 18 small, He!! on the inside, and is practicable only in good weather."

REPORT OF THE

SUPERINTENDENT

Point Adams, rrwnth of Columbia rive1и.-" It is my decided opinion that a light on Point Adams would be an important aid to navigation, as it is around this point that all vessels pass on entering or leaving, and the point whence they derive their first ranges. "After a clear night, the fog sweeping down the river in dense masses leaves the top of the cape clear, longer than any other point in the vicinity. At evening the fog comes in as densely from the north, having formed on the shoal water of Gray's and Shoal water bays, and shuts in Cape Disappointment, long before it crosses the entrance to the river." "The light-house at Hurnboldt bay might be discontinued, as, owing to its location and want of elevation, (twenty-five feet above the water,) it is of no use to vessels entering the harbor." "A light on Red Bluff, in lieu of that last named, would always serve as a leading range in and out, a: the flag-staff and ensign placed there are now thus used by pilots. A light on the blu:ff, which is about a hundred feet high, would be distinguished readily at sea, while the present one is frequently obscured by the mist that hangs over the surf on the beach." " The view now expressed has been repeatedly and earnestly urged upon my atfontion by the captains, pilots, and merchants of Humboldt bay." Pmnt Arena.-" A light-house is needed at Point Arena, California. The Golden Gate.-" Numbered buoys, just outside the bar, at the entrance to San Francisco bay, would enable steamers, upon making them in thick weather, to steer into the harbor." "The fog sometimes stands like a wall outside of a line from Fort Point, across the entrance, while the bay inside is clear. As a rule, the fog never reaches the city of San Francisco, from seaward, until the greatest heat of the day is past. "A light should be placed on San .Miguel, (one of the Santa Barbara islands.) This, with the light on Point Conception, would guide to the western entrance of Santa Barbara channel. A light on Anacapa would give a good departure at night to vessels bound south through the islands, though, as the practice of steamers in pas!'ling through them either north or south, is to keep between Santa Rosa and Santa Ciиuz, and close in w,1'.th Pmnt Conceptfon, a light would seem to be requisite on Santa Barbara, or the southwest point of Clemente, and another on the western end of Sanfrt Cruz, or the eastern end of Santa Rosa. "For coast lights on the main, (8anta Barbara channel,) Pmnt Vincent and San Fermin are entitled to some consideration." FEBRUARY 3, 1855.

COAST SURVEY OFFICE, February 22, 1855. Sm: I have the honor to forward extracts from the reports of Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, "CT. S. N., assistant in the Coast Surver, showing the results of examinations made for the se~ection of sites for light-houses at \.Vood island (Small Point harbor) and Kennebunk, :Maine, with a tracing of a topographical survey made in the vicinity of the first named point. 1. Wood island.-" I am of opinion that no light is requisite at Small Point bay. The harbor is small, open to the westward, and has a dangerous ledge in its entrance, which leav(:ls a narrow channel on each side. I did not consider a hydro graphic reconnaissance necessary' as situation, want of capacity, and insecurity, made it apparent to me that no light is needed ~ere, particularly as it is a place of no resort. It may be an occasional place of refuge, but With winds from N. E. to S. E. vessels cannot enter it, and with bad weather from any otb.er quarter can seek better shelter elsewhere." . 2и Kennebunk.-" A small light is very necessary on the pier-head of this port. The entrance 18 и very narrow and the approach is made hazardous by the Fisherman's ledge, nearly S. S. W., distant half a mile from the pier-head. . "Many fine vessels belong to this port, and to those approaching at nib' ht it may be of vital irnportance to save the tide as the loss of it would involve a serious loss of time, which in bad Weather might be disastro~s. At present it is not safe to enter at night, but with a light it lVould be a good harb 9 r of refuge and there is good anchorage outside of the pier, sheltered from N. E. winds. There is a da~gerous rock lying S. E. about half a mile from Fisherman's ~dge, with seven feet on it at low water. A buoy is needed on it." (Appendix No. 63, C. S. eport, 1854.)

Extracts from a report made to the Superintendent by Lieut. Comg. M. Woodhull, U. S. Navy, assistant in the Coast Survey, upon tlie examination of Absecom inlet, coast of New Jersey, for the location of a bell-buoy.
UNITED STATES

ScnooNER GALLATIN, New York, November 15, 1854.

DuRSm: * * * * * * "Absecom inlet is situated about thirty miles to the north of Cape May, and about eight or nine miles to the south of Little Egg harbor. As regards ease of entrance and egress, general good depth of water on the bar, and safe anchorage, it is sufficient at all times for the classes of vessels (coasters and colliers) which make use of it as a harbor of refuge. On either side of the main channel a.re extensive shoals, which have been the cause of much disaster. Between the north shoal and the beach there is a good channel, much used by the coasters at certain seasons, and when the winds are from the eastward, but dangerous with the winds from the southward or westward.'' " The channel between the beach and the south shoal is in some respects similar, but at the best has not more than four feet water, while the north and main channels have ordinarily not less than seven and a half feet water on the bars. This south shoal, judging from the number of wrecks which I was able to count within its limits, (s-0me twenty-five or thirty,) is the most dangerous and least guarded of any portion of the coast between Cape :May and Sandy Hook. To give a correct understanding of the subject, I deem it proper to mention that the fleets of colliers and coasters trading between the waters of the Delaware and the New England States, via New York and Long Island sound, rarely, either in going or returning, make au offing, or even, excepting under stress of weather, lose sight of the land. This is done to insure a quick and certain passage, by taking advantage of the land and sea breezes which, as a genernl thing, prevail close in with the coast, while at the distance of a few miles calms might be encountered. The south shoal becomes in consequence, in the darkness of night and in thick weather, a danger of no inconsiderable importance and a cause of much anxiety, requiring the exercise of the best judgment in order to avoid it." "The advantages of the proposed aid to navigation are: The timely notice it will give t.he navigator of his proximity to the shoals, the good service it will render to the general coastwise trade, and the local purpose it will serve in showing the entrance of the inlet. These are allsu:ffi.ci-ent to demonstrate the necessity it. I would, therefore, earnestly recommend that a bell-buoy be placed on the site marked on the accompanying sketch of reconnaissance of Absecolll inlet, at the earliest time practicable."

Off.Vermilion bay, January 15, 1855. Sm: Agreeably to your instructions of 15th September last, I hnve to report that I have made a careful reconnaissance of the entrance and approaches to Vermilion bay, a sketch of which on a scale of 2 0 ho is herewith enclosed. You will perceive that none but very light-draught vessels can get over the bar, and I learn from the light-house keeper, who has been long a resident here, that about three vessels only a year enter the bay, generally during the winter season, for the sugar made at two plantations in the vicinity. The produce of nearly all the neighboring plantations goes to Atchafalaya bay, which has more water and is easier of access. From this information in regard to the commerce of Vermilion bay, I consider that the amount of trade does not warrant the expense of a light-house, and the result of the survey shows that none but the lightest-draught vessels would attempt its entrance for a harbor, and even such would seek in preference that of Atcha.falaya or under Point au Fer. I, therefore, deew the maintenance of the light at the entrance of Vermilion bay of very doubtful utility, and respectfully recommend that it be discontinued. и Respectfully, &c., your most obedient servant, B. F. SAND8, Lieut. Oomg., and Assistant U. S. Ooast Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey .

Off Calcasieu river, Loui.siana, January 20, 1855. Srn: In pursuance of your instructions of the 10th of October last, I have made an examination of the mouth of Calcasieu river, and enclose herewith a tracing of the reconnaissance on the scale 20 ~00 . The bar has five and a half feet at low water, shoaling gradually to that depth from three fathoms, and deepening on the inside to twelve and fourteen feet in the river. There is no other danger near for which a light-house would be required. The houses mark the entrance sufficiently well for the small craft that can cross the bar, and in a commercial point of view it is of .but little importance ; I therefore cannot see any necessity for erecting a light-house here. Respectfully, &c., your most obedient servant, B. F. SANDS, Lieut. Cmng. and .Assistant U. S. Coast Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent Coast Survey.

Letter from the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Treasury, transmitting a report made by Lieut. Comg. E. J. De Haven, U. S.

The views expressed by that officer, as contained in the enclosed copy of his communication on the subject, seem conclusive against the necessity for a light at Gallinipper Point to serve as a guide to vessels entering the channel of Lavacca bay. I concur with Lieut. Comg.

Galveston, Texa8, April 20, 1855. Srn: In accordance with your instructions of October 10, 1854, I have visited Lavacca bay, with the view of determining as to the utility of placing a light-house on or near Gallinipper Point, as authorized in the light-house bill of 1853-' 54. A light-house on or near Gallinipper Point would be useless for purposes of navigation. It is not probable that any system of lights would enable a vessel to run up to the town of Lavacca by night. The channel, which is both narrow and intricate, is marked by stakes, but vessels of near six feet draught require day-light to enable them to get through, and even then must resort to warping. Vessels bound to Lavacca should attain the safe and convenient anchorage at the entrance of Lavacca bay, between Sand Point and Indian Point, and there await a favorable opportunity for going up the bay. A small light on Sand Point would materially aid them in reaching this anchorage by night. Very respectfully yours, &c., EDWIN J. DE HAVEN, Lieut. Gonig., and .Assistant Coast Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent.

Letter from the Superintendent to the Secretary of the Treasury, reporting the results of e.Taminations for the selection of sites for light-lwuses on the coast of Ga.lifornia, and in Washington Territory. COAST SrnVEY OFFICE, February fl, 1855. Sm: I have the honor to report that examinations for the selection of sites for light-houses on the Western Coast, directed from the Department at the request of the Light-homrn Board, under date August 21st and December 9th, 1854, and in accordance with the letter of the Secretary of the Light-house Board, of August 26th, 1854, have been made by Lit>uts. Comg. James Alden and T. H. Stevens, U. S. N., assistants in the Coast Survey . . The report of Lieut. Stevens upon the island of Anacapa, made under my previous instrncti_ons, was communicated to the Department under date November 1, 1854; anticipating the directions from the Department of August 21st, in regard to the examination of that island. I ~ow transmit extracts from the reports of Lieut. Comg. Stevens upon the sites at Santa Gruz 'Ulland; harbor of Santa Barbara; harbor of San Pedro; and Santa Cruz harbor, California и and froi;i the report of Lieut. Comg. Alden, upon the sites at Point Reyes, California; and Smith's or Blunt's island, Washington Territory. The sketches necessary to illustrate the results of examinations of the points marked 2, 3, and 5, have been forwarded to the Lighthouse Board. 1. Santa Oruz island.-" From the various inquiries which I have made in relation to the necessity for a light upon the island of Santa Cruz, and from my own know ledge of its broken character, I am induced to report against the establishment of a licrht upon it. If the light is d . ~ esigned as a guide to vessels passing through the Santa Barbara channel, I would suggest, as a much more important and accessible point, the sand-beach to the southward of San Buenaventura, which is low a.nd dangerous a.nd lies a considerable distance seaward of the high land. Arigh t erected upon this sand-beach ' would be seen clear of the land by vessels passmg и и either wa~, and would serve the double purpose of marking the entrance to the channel, and of designatmg an exceedingly dangerous point. " If, however, the light is intended to benefit the commerce passing between Santa Rosa and Santa. Cruz, I would recommend it to be placed upon the east side of the first named island, Where good anchorage is to be found during nine months of the year. The means of communication with it. are quite easy as compared with Santa Cruz. In my opinion, it wonlrl be fouml

41B

OF THB SUPERINTENDENT

almost impossible to land building materials for light-house purposes upon any part of the island of Santa Cruz, on account of its expoRure to prevailing winds, and the heavy surf which constantly prevails upon the weather side.'' 2. Harbor c?f Santa Barbara.-" The site selected as the most suitable for the erection of a light-house at Santa Barbara, (marked on the sketch already in the possession of the Light-hoURe Board,) is elevated one hundred and forty-six feet above the level of the sea, and has a firm and solid foundation of mixed clay and sand. A light fifty feet l1igh, erected upon-, this site, would have an angle of visibility of 198 degrees, and could be seen at a distance of eighteen statute miles by vessels coming down the coast after doubling Point Conception, and by those bound up after rounding Point Moga. Wood, water, and building material are convenient to the locality. The land on which the site was selected belongs to the town of Santa Barbara, and, I am informed, could be bought at a fair valuation.'' 3. Harbor of San Pedro.-" The foundation of the site selected, and marked on the sketch (which has been sent to the Light-house Board,) is a conglomerate of clay and sand, and the elevation snch, that a light sixty feet high may be seen over the adjoining land on the bays of San Pedro and San Vincent. The sector of viRilJility of a light at that elevation is 243 degrees, aml it would meet the horizon at a distance of twenty-one statute miles. "In making these examinationR and selections (2, 3) I have endeavored, while keeping within the requirements of the law, to designate as suitable localities, such sites as would combine the purposes of a harbor light in each case with adaptation to the general wants of commerce. To carry out this purpose, considerable additional hydrography was required, which will be found laid down on the sketches. The site at San Pedro is upon land claimed under a Spanish grant by the SEPULVIDA family." 4. Santa Cruz harbor.-" The establishment of a light is desirable, not only as a harbor light, but as a guide to vessels bound further up the bay to the numerous small settlements which are springing up upon its borders, and, as auxiliary to the light at Point Pinos, to the coasting trade generally. I still entertain the opinion expressed in my former report, that if but one light is to be established, it should be placed at Point Ano N uevo instead of Santa Cruz.* "The site selected at Santa Cruz (bay of Monterey) is marked on the accompanying tracing (No. 4). A light, fifty feet high, erected on it, could be seen twelve statute miles, and over the low lands to the westward; and the angle of visibility measured from the bluff, outside of which the light can be seen, to the i1oint in the harbor marked A, is 246 degrees. "The tract which includes the site is owned by Mr. Alexander McLean, under an Alcaldc's grant. "Wood and water are convenient to the site, and bricks of good quality are made in the neighborhood.'' 5. Point Reyes.-" The purposes to be answered by this light, which should be o~ ~he first class, are, that lying soruewhat in the track of coasters, nearly all sailing-vessels arnvm_g from seaward in the summer-time endeavor to make the land thereabouts; and besides, as it is the nearest and most important cape or headland to the northward of San Francisco, it has been not unfrequently, in the night or in thick weather, taken for the entrance to that bayd Occurrences of this kind could be avoided by the erection of the propased light." The site selecte is marked on the chart of Point Reyes which has been sent to the Light-house Board. "l~s height is about four hundred and eighty-five feet, and the elevation of the light above. ~ht need not be over twenty feet to illuminate a sector of 255 degrees. The light would be ~isib_e from the long beach to the northward, a,round to the south face of the point, where the ~iew ~s obstructed by the cliffs, which are much higher in that direction. It will be seen also m t e northern part of Sir Frnncis Drake's bay, over the low land. I have drawn lines on the chart, in the direction of all the principal objects that can be seen from Point Reyes." 6. Blunt's or Smith's island.-" It will be seen by the cha.rt accompanying (No. 6), that

this island is quite small, only about five hundrecl metres across, and very regular in its shape. It is about sixty feet nigh at its western face, with a gradual slope to the eastward, and, excepting on that side, its shore is nearly perpendicular. "A light of the second class wilL I think, answer all the requirements, as there is but one direction looking to'\\'ards the entrance of the straits of Juan de Fuca, where it i8 necessary that it should be seen more than ten or twelve miles. The tower for the light should be placed so that it can be seen in all directions, and need not be more than twenty or twenty-five feet in height. ''"\Vood is plenty on the island, but there is no water. "The large bed of kelp extending out from the west side of the island is a good guide to vessels approaching it from the westward in thick weather." The position of Smith's island is shown on the general sketch marked 6 bis. I concur in the recommendations of the hydrographic officers by whom these examinations were made.

An eligible site on the last-named point, now occupied by a light which for a long time has been kept up by private enterprise, is marked on the enclosed tracing." ''There is no immediate necessity for lights at Umpquah river and Shoalwater bay, as not more than one vessel in a month visits eitheT place. They are entiTely in.accessible at night, and lights could afford no facilities for entering. The points marked on the sketches may be considered as good as an);, for lights.
