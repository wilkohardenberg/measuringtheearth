REPORT
OF THE

DIRECTOR, U. S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY
DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Washington, October 5, 1925. Sm: There is submitted herewith my eleventh annual report. This report is for the fiscal vear ended June 30, 1925, and is the ninety-fourth annual report of this bureau.
INTRODUCTION

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has just closed the one hundred and ninth year of its active exi~tence, and it has been generally a most successful one. The results of our greatest efforts in carrying on the hydrographic work have demonstrated agnin the wisdom of providing modern vessels with up-to-date equipment. This is especially so in connection with our Pticific coast and Alask11 work, where efficiency and large returns have been most marked. The greater strides in completinf" the survey of the Pacific con.st and Alaska waters, much of it o a permanent nature, is gratifying and most marked in comparison with the slow progress of a few yen.rs a~o. Another interesting activity with the bureau was the visit of tne chief of the division of hydrogruphy and topogrnphy to the Philippine Islands, where he made an exhaustive study of the conditions of our hydrographic work. His trip was most helpful in that it has shown, first, that the work in our far-off possession is nearing completion as regards first surveys, and, second, he was able to study a program of a constructive nature looking toward the completion of the hydrographic work in Philippine waters. It is interesting to know that tho demand for our charts and other nautical publications has been the greatest in the history of the bureau. Coupled with this, the income from these sales has reached the greatest figures in dollars and cents since the bureau was organized. Another outstanding effort of the bureau was the progress in instrument design and construction. So much has· been done of an important nature that it has helped to expedite our work and greatly reduce certain unit costs. With the many favorable things that o.re ·outstanding in the bureau's year of effort, which we 'l'eCO<Ynize and fully appreciate, there are still some that should be looked to and provided for in the near future, as they are clearly matters involving economy and when provided will mean money saved to the Government, among which

are new tenders to replace the worn-out and dangerous craft that have been in the service for more than a quarter of a century and a new vessel for the Atlantic coast to replace two worn-out and uneconomic ships that have served the Government for more than 30 years. With the acquisition of this latter vessel the work on the Atlantic coast and Gulf will be expedited as well as the cost reduced. Another important item is the need of a modern building to house our Washington office. The a.dminis tration of the present eight buildings, all unrelated to one another, is a serious waste of Government money, not to mention the fact that the bureau has outgrown the space that it now occupies, and necessarily the public interest will further suffer unless greater accommodations are soon provided. The permanent good that has resulted from the reclassification act, whwh has now had a trial of over a year, has in many ways fulfilled the needs for which it was created, but emphasis should be laid on the fact that it is now time to rectify certam ambiguities in the legislation and so provide without delay certain increase in salaries of positions that so far have not benefited as deserved. The -0ontinuation of this situation is one .of the outstanding causes of the turnover in the Federal service, which is quite the opposite of economy and makes the administrative cost of every bureau higher, as whenever an employee leaves the bureau the services of someone else are needed to train the new employee. It should be pointed out that the additional money needed to provide just and adequate salaries~ which no doubt were intended in the legislation in question, woula more than offset the high cost involved in this repeated turnover. Another reason for tliis large turnover in the bureau, as well as throughout the Government generally, is that the present retirement law is unsatisfactory and not in line with the Rresent idea of good business methods of making the future of sufficient interest to the employees, so that, after having served the Government faithfully, m their old age they may be adequately taken care of. One of the questions that has much to do With our present-day problems is the change in the purchasing value of the dollar during the past 10 years-1915, par; 1920, 0.415; 1925, 0.644-and while our appropriation has increased in 10 ~ears in so far as actual figures are concerned, the J>Urchasing power is so much less that in reality this bureau has had little more actual money to work with than appropriated 10 years ago.· Changes in methods of management, thereby increasing efficiency, are alone responsible for the bureau be~g able to get on as well as it h11:s and to take care of increase in busmess, but ·I frankly see that without more space to house the bureau in Washington and additional personnel we can not take care of even the daily demands made on us and which are increasing each day, a& any healthy business organization should grow. · Too much can not be said of the spirit· in which the personnel have taken hold so that we could, in so far as it is humanly possible, care for the new calls made on us. The care of our mass of heterogeneous buildings and bringing them up to the greatest state of efficiency reflects unusual credit on the chief clerk of the bureau. ·Through his untiring efforts and those of the personnel under h.im, insanitary buildings have been made .fairly livable in spite of a poor assortment of tools, and a saving in funds has been accomplished.

The most striking example of the latter is shown in illustrations Nos. l and 2. Not many years ago all the field notes of this bureau, ·representing a century of work and involving millions of dollars in actua! worth, were pro.tected .only by ordinary care as they rested on dry pme shelves, the worst kind of fire traps. No money was foi'thcommg for vaults to store these records. The necessity of providi..D.g some means of protection became so obvious that this administrative officer worked out an economy plan covering several years whereby enough money would be saved from "office expenses 11 to install steel bookcases· for the bureau's library. He accomplished what he started out to do, and now the valuable example of economy and thrift is a realty. These valuable records of the country are protected as never before. Furthermore, while the bureau now has a library which is fairly well protected from fire, with the changes other protection has been given our records which reflects credit and appreciation. The records are now readily accessible, made so b:y a fine system of reference cards. There are other things that are m kee:Ring with the above saving policy which started before the war, a.na, as I have said before, only such a general attitude throughout the bureau has made it possible to keep abreast of the larger demands . made on us by a fast growing country. I will now take up m this mtroduction in more detail some of the outstanding matters, and then following in Part I will briefly indicate the bureau's greatest needs.
RETIREMENT OF CIVIL-SERVICE EMFLOYEES

The question of a more appropriate retirement for civil-service employees should have serious consideration at this time. The present basis of retirement means but little to the average employee in the Government. The annuity is too low,·and the law does not differentiate between any class of employees or their earning capacities during their period of Government service. It is now quite evident that unless the present law is much improved upon it will not accomplish what it was intended to do. As I have mentioned before, there is a great turnover every year in the Government personnel, which is not only expensive and wasteful but proves conclusively that it lessens the attractiveness of Government positions largely because a .man or a woman who enters the Government service must have more money to live on than is now paid by the Government if they are to be retired on a mere pittance after 30, 40, or 50 years of sernce. It is my belief that an equitable retirement system, based on length of· service and earning capacity during active service in the Government, will irilmediiitely attract th~ ablest people, who will be brought into the service and remain: there to the great advantage of the public welfare. · There are two outstanding factors in the present retirement law that are distinctly unsatisfactory. One is that the retirement agE! is t?o high. The other_i& that e:ve:.Y. ~mploy~e has to·contribute from his salary toward the small, anmnty (maxrmum $60) that ·he ·is to ~eceive upori reaching the l'etire:rnen,t age. While there is som~:merit ll1 the· einpl.oyees contributing' toward this annuity ~und ·the·:retir&ment la:w.should'be more liberal:and provide f<;>r optionid·retireme1}.t on ti' basis similar to the' military· fotces; that is, after ·ao years 'of

service. . As the law now exists, a young man entering .the Govern. ment service at the age ;0f 18 is retired at the age of 70 years, after 52 , years of service on an annuity.of $60 per month, proviqing );lis average annual pay for the preceding 10 years was $1,200 or more. This has the effect of employees generally asking to be continued after they . have reached the age at which they should l;>e legally separated. from the Government service because of their realizmg; that their swall annuity will not nearly pay for the actual necessities of life.
VALUE OF PRINTED MATTER AND OTHER DATA TO THE PUBLIC

The impression which the average man has of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is that of a bureau designed. to serve the mariner· alone. It is true that .the production of charts for the guidance of our own and foreign vessels in our coastal waters is the primary purpose 'of the survey, but in recent years this bureau has found other important ways in which to serve the public. One of the most iinportant of these is in the dissemination of in·formation to county surveyors and local surveyors in every State in the Union. Three years ago a state of extraordinary confusion in the matter of local surveys was brought to the attention of the bureau. Cities and sometimes counties were engaged in dispute.s as to their boundary lines, most of these disputes arising from the inability of city and county engineers to reestablish old lines which had served until the recent rapid growth of our country. Control points were seldom in harmony, boundary monuments had become lost or obliterated, and it was not uncommon for gaps or overlaps to develop between two areas in guestion. This difficulty would have been eliminated had standard data, been used for these surveys. Fortunately, such data were a,~ailable in the shape of Coast and Geodetic fiurvey triangulation stations, magnetic stations, and precise level bench marks. It is strange that the existence of these reference marks should have been known to so few local engineers, but such was the case. In recognition of this situation, the bureau entered into correspondence with local surveyors in the county seats of every State, bringing to their attention the mass of information ready for their use. The method of making this first contact has been by prin,ted digests, one for each State. In each digest the counties are listed alphabetically, with the reference marks which have been established at each point. Accompanying the digests arc base maps of the States, showmg the nature and location of surveys. (See illustration No. 3, opposite p. 6.) These publications have been distributed for the following Stattis: .Alabama, Arkansn.s, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa1 Kansa.S, Kentucky, Maine, Mas~achusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevad,a, North Dakota1 Ohio, Oregon, Rhode IslaQd, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming. Digests .'fpr the relll1lining States wiJI .be, pµbbshed as soon, as possible. , The bureaµ .serves the. ~eneral public in pther ways. .Information on a great variety of supJects,is furnished ponstantly.to,publ.ic and private organi~ations and indiv~duaJs. .Occf\.Sionally important legal.decisions hinge upon some point which is decided by consulta,.. ~ion. of oqr records.

bureau, there has been a steady stream of ioquiries concerning earthquakes and precautions to be taken against them in affected areas. Our special publications, such as The Portable Automatic Tide Gauge, are in regular demand by outside engineers. The bureau has also forged ahead in its service to the maritime public. By means of judimous publicity and by the use of posters at chart sales stations, new charts and inside route pilots liave been widely advertised. The new inside route pilots have in particular been brought tq the attention of tha~ growing class of motor-boat men, for '":"hose special use they were designed. ,
WHAT TWO YEARS OF MODERN VESSELS HAVE MEANT IN MONEY SAVE:p

For years one of the greatest needs of this bureau, to enable it to accomplish the work expected of it, has been modern seaworthy vessels. Three such vessels w.ere acquired from the Navy two years ago, which, with the vessel constructed by this bureau Just prior to tlie war, formed a respectable fleet of ocean-going ships for surveying the waters of the Pacific coast of the United St~tes and Alaska. The performance of these four ships during the la8t two years shows conclusively what the bureau can accomplish with adequate equipment and also how hopelessly it was handicapped by the old, weak, and underpowered vessels with which it was compelled to work prior to that date. These new ships are larger and more powerful; they have larger and more powerful machinery, as well as larger hulls, than the ships which they replaced. Consequently, they are more costly to operate because of the greater quantity of fuel required to drive them, as well as the necessarily greater expense of carmg for larger and more complete equipment. But these ships are able to accomplish so much more work during a working-day and, because of the1r greater seaworthiness, are able to work so many more days during a surveying season, that they can accomplish a job more cheaply than was possible for the older ships. The unit costs of taking a sounding and of surveying a square mile of sea area are less to-day with these ships than they were 10 years ago with the old ships, notwithstanding the higher wages and greater cost of all supplies at present, and if we make due allowances for the smaller purchasing power of the dollar of to-day we find that these ships have very materially reduced the cost of surveying. While the reduced cost of surveying is an im.Portant consideration and one that will naturally appeal to everyone, it is not by any means the only gain that has resulted from replacing obsolete ships by modern ones. A glance at the progress maps m the back of this report will show how the unsurveyed and partly surveyed areas along the coasts of California, Oregon, . and Alaska have been reduced during the last two years. In some of the areas, tinted blue on these lllaps, rrogress was being made with such equipment as we had, but the rate o progress was necessarily slow compared to recent advances, and in some of these areas weather conditions and lack of fuel bases !lnd harbors of ·refuge so handicapped the old '.vessels that very little, if any, progress could be made. It is in such localities that the new ships have made their most pronounced gain over the old.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COA.ST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY

These vessels can carry on hydrographic surveys during conditions of wind and sea which heretofore we have re(J'arded as unfit for work and, due to the fact that they need not seek shelter or sea room at the first indication of an ar,proaching storm, they can hold on and work until the storm has ful y developed. When we consider that heretofore much valuable time has been lost in getting to the working ground and away on the approach of a storm, and that the commanders of the old ships could not afford to take any chance of being caught on a ·lee shore, we understand how the new ships have reduced the cost and speeded up tho progress of work in such areas. · An important factor u.lso is the improved morale of the officers and men who man these ships. They are not only more comfortable than.was possible on the older vessels, but they no longer need have any fear for the safety of themselves or their ships. They feel certain th1,1.t with their own good seamanship and navigation they can take their ships through any storm. This new and favorable situation· all goes to prove the wisdom of wise investment in modern equipment, for it means money saved and the work more quickly ·and better done.
SPECIAL SURVEYS REQUESTED BY ARMY AND NA.VY AND OTHER SOURCES

Surveys in western Alaska, a two-year project, requested by the Navy Department, were completed last fa11 in accordance with the .bureau's estimate. The completion of this job exactly on time is particularly gratifying because new vessels were employed on it, which at the time tho estimate was made had not been tested as surveying tools, and also because the areas surveyed are in remote parts of the country, for which we had little dependable data on which to base the estimate. In the Hawaiian Islands special work for the War Department was in progress throughout the past year and is still in progress. This is rather a large project, measured by the difficulties encountered, precision desired, and the facilities available for the work. It is prooable that work will continue on that project throughout the present fiscal year. . The hydrographic survey of the waters of the Virgin Islands, a necessary correlate to the land survey of those islands, requested by and made for the Navy Department several years ago, was still in progress at the close of the fiscal year. It is expected this survey will be completed during the present fiscal year. In the Philippines con£dential surveys were made for the use of the Navy Department. This work was begun in the latter part of the fiscal year and was nearly completed at its close. However, it seems probable that this work is the forerunner of more extensive work of the same sort for that branch of the Government.

previous year. Marked progress has been m11de by all parties, du9 no small measure to continuity of work, thereby climmating in a large measure reconnaissance and preliminary work which must be done before starting each new project. The' total water urea completely surveyed during this last year was slightly more than double tho area surveyed the year previous with the same vessels and practically the same personnel. . In southeastern Alaska the party on the Surveyor extended the offshore work northward past Sitka Sound and nearly to Cross Sound. Inshore hydrography and topography was carried as far as Sitka Sound, and triangulation for the control of this and next year's Work as far as Dixon Harbor north of Cross Sound, except for about 30 miles between Salisbury Sound and Lisianski Strait. The party on the Explorer wire dragged Gambier Bay and the east shore of tho e~trance to Chatham Strait as far as Port Mnlmesbury, togoth.er with several small arms on both the east and west sides of tho st1'mt. In western Alask11 the surveys of Ikatan Bny, Isanotski Strait, Pavlof Bay, and approaches were completed hjr the pnrty on the Pioneer. The Discoverer's party surveyed Chwnik Bay and the approaches to this and to Wide and Portage fiays aud extended triangulation control along the Alaska Pensinula nearly to a junction with the old work and also out to the Semidi uncl other off-lying islands and rocks. All of the work accomf]ished in Alaska was needed to permit the economic development o the country and to snfegunrd shipping to those regions. This last year we have ho<'n able ~to meet demands better than ever before. The fa.ct thnt the mnrine insurance rates for AJaska have been recently reduced was tho best argument for · having done this work.

Excellent progress has been made on the offshore survoy of the Pacific coast, particularly on the Ore~on coast south of Cape Blanco. Offshore work on the southern Calitornia coast hns been extended northward as for as San Pedro. The submarine valley which extends into Monterey Bay has been fully developed by a close hydrographic survey. All of this work has been carried seaward to a depth of at least 1,000 fa.thorns, which on the extreme southern coast is 150 miles offshore. On the Atlantic coast progress has been made on offshore work on the North Carolina coast, at Cape Fear, and on the Florida coast in the vicinity of Daytona. Much inshore resurveying, including bays and inlets,'has been accomplished on the Georgia and Florida coasts. One party has been employed the 'entire year on a resurvey of Tampa Bay and approach and has nearly completed the survey of the outside coast and entrance to the bay. The survey of Lake Okeechobee Was completed early this summer and will be published soon in the form of a chart of the lake. It is interesting to note that in connection with some of the above activities we were able to furnish other Government bureaus as Well as private institutions by-products of our work, such as samples

of water at great depths and bottom samples, all without extra work or cost.
RECENT RESULTS OF PHILIPPINE ISLANDS SURVEYS

The outstanding ac~omplishment for the year in Philippine waters was the determination of the exact position of each of the islands and rocks which lie north of the island of Luzon and which to some extent block the passage between the Philippines and Formosa. Work in this locality has been regarded as particularly difficult and dangerous because of the prevalence of typhoons during the only season when the sea is otherwise smooth enough to permit landing upon these islands and rocks. All islands, islets, and rocks have now been connected by triangulation with Luzon and can be accurately placed on charts. Excellent progress has been made in the Sulu Archipelago and on the west side of Palawan, where two ship parties have been employed during the year.
PROGRESS IN HAWAIIAN ISLANDS

One boat party has been continuously employed on a survey of the coast of Oahu in minute detail and has made good f.rogress considering the difficulties of the job, particularly from sur . A second boat party surveyed six of the small harbors and anchorages on the islands of Molokai and Maui which are used by interisland steamboats.
PROGRESS IN VIRGIN ISLANDS

Good progress is being made in the hydrographic survey of the waters of the Virgin Islands. One ship party lias been employed there throughout the year. The ship returned to the United States last winter for extensive repairs, but only such personnel accompanied her as was absolutely necessary, the remainder remaining to carry on work from shore bases durin~ the absence of the ship. It is expected all work in these waters will be completed during tlie current fiscal year.
GEODETIC WORK ACCOMPLISHED

The geodetic work done during the fiscal year was almost entirely in the western part of the United States and in Alaska. Probably the most important work undertaken during the year was that along the boundary betweeni the United States and Canada to the westward of Lake Superior. An agreement had been entered into between officials of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Geodetic Survey of Canada for the extension of an arc along the boundary west of Lake Superior; each organization assuming the responsibility of covering half of the line .. Another important piece of work was the triangulation in Dixon Entrance, Alaska, between British Columbia and southeastern Alaska, and the measurement of base lines along the arc of triangulation extending through southeastern Alaska. .The purpose of this Alaskan work was, primarily, to furnish. accurate control for the charts of the region, but another very important use is in the carrying of

North American datum, geographic positions from Puget Sound, Wash., northward to northwest Canada and Alaska. The Geodetic Survey of Canada has extended an arc of triangulation from Puget Sound to Dixon Entrance, and this, with the completed arc from the latter place to Skagway, will make it possible to place all of the charts of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska on the North American datum. First order traverse and triangulation were extended from the 'Vicinity of Salem to the Black Hills in South Dakota. The selection of stations for the entire arc was completed during the fiscal year
1925.

An arc of first-order triangulation was extended from the vicinity of San Antonio to Del Rio, Tex. The selection of stations for this arc had been made prior to the observing. Work was begun late in the fiscal year on an arc of first-order ~riangulation running from the vicinity of Needles, Calif., northward into Utah. · Work was begun on the selection of first-order triangulation stations and their preparation for the observing party along an arc of triangulation which will extend from the vicinity of Umatilla, Oreg., northward to the vicinity of Oroville, Wash., near the Canadian boundary. Longitude determinations for the purpose of furnishing Laplace azimuths at triangulation stations were made in California, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Radio time signals sent from the Naval Observatory in Washington, through the naval radio station at Annapolis, were used by the observers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in determining the longitudes of the field stations. Most efficient cooperation by the sueerintendent and officials of the Naval Observatory made it possible to do this work at a low cost and with great accuracy. A specially designed receiving apparatus for radio signals, designed by Doctor Eckhardt and Doctor Karcher when they were members of the Bureau of Standards, was used in the field for the purP.OSl'l of recording automatically the radio signals. This is anotlier illustration of the practical benefits to be derived from the results of a piece of scientific research. The longitude party determined the astronomic latitude and azimuth at a number of stations. This work was accomplished without any material increase in the cost of operation of the party. The selection of first-order stations and observations on the arc of triangulation extending northward from Cook Inlet, Alaska, was continued during the first half of the fiscal year. This triangulation in the interior of Alaska is greatly needed at present by the General Land Office which wishes to establish land lines for settlement purposes. Without u triangulation extending in a connected system along the valleys in Alaska, it would be necessary to use a separate llleridian and base line for each place where settlement begins. The Governor of Alnsku conferred at W ushington with the officials of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and mo.de the most urgent appeals for the triangulation. The select10n of stutions was mude for traverse and triangulation extending northward from the vicinity of Houston, Tex., to Fort Sniith, Ark. This is a part of the general control system of the

10

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

country. The selection of stations wos olso made near the mouth of the Red River with a view to connecting the triangulation along the Mississippi River and the first-order triangulation of the country. At the request of the city engineer of Rochester, N. Y., engineers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey begun in the spring of 1925 the extension of a first-order horizontal control system· over the area covered by the citv. Triangulation of the second order was executed in Frederick Sound and Chatlrnm Strait in southeastern Alaska. Third-order triangulation was executed in the vicinity of Crescent City, Calif., in connection with surveys of the waters along the coast. Triangulation of the second order was executed in lower San Francisco Bay. This work was made necessary by the destruction by man and nature of the monuments left when the triangulation was first done many years ago. Triangulation und traverse of the second order were executed along the coast of South Carolina from the vicinity of Charleston to Winyah Bay. Two hundred und seven miles of first-order leveling were run from Perth Amboy to Atlantic City, N . · J.; from Pleasantville to Cape May, N. J.; und from Delair, N. J., to Philadelphia. The testing of the stability of the earth in California was continued during the yen.r. The work consisted of a redetermination of the angles at first-order triangulation stations from the vicinity of Los· Angeles, Calif., eastward to the Colorado River, and along the coast in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel. The Coa..c;;t and Geodetic Survey cooperated with the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the extension of first-order triangulation northwestward from the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation toward Ukiah, Calif. The field expenses were paid for by the institution, while the instruments and transportation equipment were loaned to the institution by the bureau. The urgent need for the study of earth movements led the officials of the institution to undertake the work. One hundred and seventy-seven miles of first-order leveling were run in southern California for the purpose of determining whether vertical movements had taken place prior to the running of a line of first-order leveling some years ago and to establish some new leveling that can be repeated after a number of years or after an earthquake has occurred along the line. The Ukiah Observatory for observations concerning the variation oflatitude was kept in operation throughout the year. The records of the observations were sent to Professor Kimura, who is having the computations and reductions of the data made under his direction.
COOPERATION WITH OTHER
ORGA?GZATIO~S

The geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are services rendered the Government and people of this country. While a large part of the results are essential to the accurate charting of our waters, the larger part forms the basis for surveys and maps made by other organizations of the Government and for various engineering and industrial activities of our people. Cooperation can be best carried on by executing geodetic surveys where they are most urgently

Requests from. other Government agencies for first-order triangulation and leveling, by which latitudes, longitudes, and elevations are established for map control, have accumulated to such a point that the condition is most unfortunate.

' Topographic surveying in some areas, even where the States pay half the expenses of the work, is delayed and stopped, because the engineers of the United States Geological Survey, charged with the topographic surveying of the country, refuse to do their work in any region ahead of the control surveys. Much of the topographic sur-

12

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST ·AND GEODETIC SURVEY

veying has in the past preceded the control, but that practice led to much confusion when maps extended from distant centers were finally joined. The General Land Office was forced by necessity to carry on the division of the public lands ahead of the horizontal control. This unfortunate condition is being corrected so far as is practicable by a cooperative plan by which an engineer of the General Land Office accompanies each of the trian~ulat10n parties. Land corners which he recovers are tied into the triangulation, making it possible to give accurate latitudes and longitudes to the corners. Eventually a sufficient number of connections to the land corners will be made to coordinate the public land surveys with maps based on triangulation, but this can not be done now. The survey is cooperating with the Forest Service a.s far a.s possible, although only a small fraction of the work called for can be accomplished. That bureau needs accurate locations of the boundaries of national forest reservations, and these can be made only when the basis of the boundary surveys is triangulation. The work requested of the survey by the United States Geological Survey alone would require an expenditure several times the present annual appropriation. Before planning each year's work officials of the survey and of the Geological Survey confer a.s to where the field operations should be carried on. Invariably the decision is based on the most urgent needs of the Government and the public. Surveying and mapping the interior of the country is not very romantic, nor does it appear necessary to those who have not been fortunate enough as to have been trained in the using of accurate maps. We are not very far in time from the period when the land of this country was scarcely worth the cost of accurate surveys. When the West was a wide-open range, it made no difference to the banker or manufacturer of the financial and industrial centers. They cared not whether the cattle and sheep grazed on prairies or mountain sides. They care now, and they are beginning to demand that the topographic mapping of the country be completed. These maps will show accurately all topographic features such as highways, railroads, bridges, cities, towns, and villages, forests, swamps, and the hills, ridges, and mountains. From the map the exact slope of the ground can be obtained, power and irrigation projects can be accurately planned, and, in fact, any one of many industrial activities can be executed with economy and with a degree of certainty as to costs and output from the completed project which are impossible without the data furnished by the topographic map. The forest area in the Rocky Mountains, the cotton field of Texa.s, the mine in Montana, the drainage projects of Minnesota, the irrigation of California, the power projects of the Atlantic States, have something to do with our daily lives. We use their products and thus pay for their operation and tlie interest on the costs of their installation or development. Our money is invested in their bonds or capital stock. Should we not therefore be interested in where all these activities are, what they cost originally, their cost of upkeep and operation~ We are, and we are also interested in the mapping of the area around such projects in order that they may be run more P.conomically.

To the purchaser of State and county securities, an accurate map of the political unit involved is of importance, for it shows the character of the surface within the bounds of the unit, it gives accurately the size of the unit, and from the data made available may be obtained some idea of the future industrial condition of the area. It is really difficult to overexaggerate the importance and value of the topographic map in the activities of a nation. It is the duty of the officials of a Government bureau, charged with certnin duties, to set forth the true condition in their field to those higher in authority, and it is in carrying out this responsibility that the above analysis of the topographic mapping situation is made. This mapping is dependent on the horizontal and vertical control Work of tliis l:mreau for its framework. The engineering organizations of other countries than the United States are facing acute rnaEJJing problems. In the July (1925) number of the Journal of the Royal Geographic Society of London is a review of the 1924 Annual Report of the Director of Surveys of Sudan. The reviewer calls attention to the small amount of triangulation in the Sudan, and then said in part:
Outside the above-mentioned areas the primary positions in the Sudan rest . on the latitudes and longitudes obtained by the ordinary methods of field astronomy, most excellent and valuable as long as the country remains almost Undeveloped, but liable to produce endless confusion as soon as questions of accurate boundaries arise. The Sudan Government, like so many others, delllands and obtains maps sufficient for its present purposes without appreciating that, as a country develops, no amount of astronomical or other short cuts can replace a proper framework of triangulation, * · · and that to delay the preparation of this control until its need is apparent to the layman, involving as it does innumerable adjustments and complications and much resurvey, is no true economy.

The above is an accurate, forceful, and timely summary of the lllapping situation in each of many countries. While the surveys in the United States are in better shape than in the Sudan, yet as compared with other great countries which are highly developed industrially an!) commercially the United States is about the most backward of them all in so far as its surveys and maps are concerned. This situation should be speedily remedied. Surveying and mapping are now carried on by engineers having large projects to put through, but only such work is done as will meet their immediate needs, and the data secured are not available to the public. In the same general area many private surveys and maps are made, and the cost of each is included in tho capital accounts of ~he companies performing them. Tho public pays for the work in increased price charged for the manufactured goods or services rendered. The necessity for most of the private surveying and mapping will be eliminated when the country is covered by what is known a.s the standard topographic map of the United States Geological Survey. . The Coast and Geodetic Survey- and the Geodetic Survey of .Canada continued their cooperation durmg the year in the establishment of an arc of first-order triangulation a.long the boundary from Lake 81:1Perior to Point Roberts on the west coast. It is expected this arc Will be completed during the fiscal year 1926. The two surveys also c~ntinued their cooperative work on the arc of first-order triangulation which extends from Point Roberts northward along the coast

14

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR,· COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY

of British Columbia and through southeast Alaska to the head of Lynn Canal. This arc will make it possible to coordinate the United States and also the Canadian maps and charts of the vast areas involved in western and northwestern Canada and in southeast Alaska and in Alaska. These operations could only have been accomplished by combined effort. The results will be of great benefit to each of the countries. The Bureau of Standards continued its active cooperation by standardizing base tapes and level rods, as has been customary since the organization of that bureau many years ago. Officials of the Bureau of Standards and of the division of geodesy of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have frequent conferences on geodetic instruments and methods for testing and standardizing them. The United States Naval Observatory at Washington, D. C., has been of great assistance to field parties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in the extension of the longitude net of this country and Alaska. Special time signals sent after midnight have been forwarded from the Naval Observatory through the Annapolis station for the use of the observers of the survey operating in Alaska and in the western part of the United States. During the summer months the regular 10 o'clock time signals from the Naval Observatory are too early for use in the far West. For the best results the time signals by radio and the local time observations in the field should be as near simultaneous as possible. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has cooperated with the engineering department of the city of Rochester, N. Y., in the extension of the first-order horizontal control system over the area of the city. The city of Rochester is paying all expenses connected with the survey except the salaries of the commissioned officers assigned to the work in question. The instrumental equipment, record books, and other forms were furnished by the survey. Close cooperation has been maintained between the officials of this survey and the Committee on Seismology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Conferences have been held by them from time to time looking toward the most effective methods of testing the stability of the earth in regions of seismic activity. The field work connected with the operation consists of first-order trianzulation and leveling. During the year this work was done within the ::;tate of California.
PROGRESS IN MAGNETIC SURVEYS

In 1899 the Coast and Geodetic Survey started a magnetic survey of the United States, with the aim of establishing a well-marked magnetic station at each county seat in the United States where magnetic declinations, dip, and intensity had been carefully measured. This project was practically finished some years ago, though each year there remain about 100 unoccupied county seats, as subdivision of counties goes on just about as fast as the previous unoccupied county seats are reached. As a result we know at each of these places the values of the magnetic elements on a given date. Unfortunately for the possibility of finishing a magnetic survey, the earth's magnetism is continually changing. This does not make the old survey useless if sufficient observat10~s are made each year in various parts of the

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC srRVEY

15

United States, so that the entire area is c~vered by "repeat observations" every five years. Furthermore, the marked sta.tions are subject to many accidents which render them useless for reoccupation, the chief cause being changes due to progress in development of towns and cities where the stations are placed. An important part in keeping the old surveys available is played by the five welldistributed magnetic observatories which are scattered throughout the United States and the regions under its jurisdiction where continuous observations are made. · For the United States, then, it may be said that the first survey has been practically completed, but that this survey will remain useful only by contmued maintenance of observatories and occupation of repeat stations. There is urgent need for replacement of stations which have been rendered useless, and the hitherto unoccupied county seats should be occupied. For Alaska the previous survey is inadequate. Observations have been made along the coast and along the Yukon River, but repeat observations are inadequate, and there are vast regions in the interior without a single usefl:ll observation. The needs of the Aleutian Islands are being met by a party engaged in general reconnaissance. The work of the observatory at Sitka is an important part of this program. For the present the surveys of the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, and the Hawaiian Islands are in good condition, as repeat observations have been made within two years, so that activity outside the United States can be concentrated on Alaska. In both the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico the work of the observatories makes it unnecessary to occupy repeat stations except at long intervals.
SEISMOLOGY TO DATE

Legislation authorizing seismological investigation by the Coast and Geodetic Survey flaced a difficult task upon the bureau because of the inadequacy o previous work. The Weather Bureau had maintained instruments for a period of years and had collected useful reports of felt and visible effects of earthquakes. The Coast and Geodetic Survey had operated seismographs for about 20 years as a part of its magnetic work, inasmuch as earthquakes affect the recording of the earth's magnetism. No special effort had been made to study the earthquake records. Various organizations·such as universities throughout the country had operated seismographs, but with few exceptions the work was treated as a side issue. The great need for earthquake studies for the United States as a whole could obviously be met only by a Government agency with continuous functioning, whose work would proceed without regard to the interest stirred up by earthquakes at any particular time. The application of precise methods was especially needed. There is a great deal of work in seismology which only the Government can do. Accurate reports of visible and felt earthquake effects can he obtnined only by a Governpient agency which has no preju-

dice toward any special theory. This ~as been proved many times in this country. Since the earthquake activity of the present calendar year has stirred up interest, there are numerous organizations taking up different phases of earthquake investigation, but all of this work is local and applied to local problems. Invariably it neglects certain areas. The important function of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in this work is to operate high-grade instruments at its magnetic observatories and do its full share in coordinating all the other activities. The earthquake question has already become such a vital national issue ·that tlie N at10nal Board of Fire Underwriters is giving the matter most serious consideration.
WHAT THE COMPLETED DELAWARE BAY CURRENT AND TIDE SURVEY WILL MEAN TO SHIPPING

The detailed current conditions at different depths along the dock line and over other areas of a port are of vital importnnce to the safe berthing of large, deep-draft vessels in restricted harbors. It is obvious that considerable damage may result in the berthing of a large vessel when an unseen and unknown contrary current at a depth of 25 or 30 feet is running with considerable velocity in the opposite direction from that on the surface, which is the only one seen by the navigator. Such currents, however, do exist in many of our harbors, particularly in those into which largo fresh-water rivers empty. This condition is due to difference in density between the river water and the tidal water entering from the ocean. To bring out these local peculiarities for the guidance and safety of the marmer, a comprehensive current and tide survey of Delaware Bay and tributaries was made during the fiscal year 1925, and definite knowledge of the tidal and current phenomena for those waters is now available. The general information of the current conditions in this waterway obtamed from this survey has been incorporated in the Current 'l'ables, Atlantic Coast, for 1926, recently received from press. For the purely local and detailed information for the berthing of vessels many current stations unessential to a knowledge of the general current flow are required in a practical survey. A considerable number of such stations were occupied in the current survey of Delaware Bay. '!'he data are now being computed, and after they have been correlated with various scattered observations made in previous years the results and conclusions. will be issued for the mariner in a publication similar to those which now cover New York Harbor and Sun Francisco Harbor. From the data in this publication, together with the predictions of the general slack water which are issued each year in tlie current tables, udvu.nce information will be furnished the navigator of the conditions of the current flow at different depths at the time he expects to berth his vessel. It is difficult to estimate the value of such advance information. Aside from the value of such a survey to the mariner, the byproducts, obtained at no increased cost, are of invaluable aid to engineers in and outside the Fodera! Government engaged on marine work, sewage problems, and harbor improvement.

WHAT MODERN INSTRUMENTS HAVE MEANT TO THE BUREAU'S WORK

The great progress of this bureau as a whole is in no small measure due to the dev~lopme~t of new a_nd impr?ved instruments, .as they are the tools with which the basic work 1s performed. Failure to make use of the most modern and efficient equipment and materials would be analogous to a carpenter attempting to build a house with poor lumber and worn-out tools and would be immediately reflected in the effii;iency of the bureau. An accurate instrument in the hands of an unskilled operator may give inaccurate results, but a poor instrument can only give poor results regardless of how skillfully it is handled. The bureau obtains its instruments from the four quarters of the globe, and these are the products of the best minds trained for this type of work. Every effort is made to increase the accuracy and decrease the size and weight of the equipment. As an instance, many _years .ago our triangulation surveys were made with theodolites havmg an 18:-inch circle and which weighed 68 pounds. To-day we have an instrument of much greater accuracy, having a circle but 9 inches in diameter and weighing less than 40 pounds. Many other instruments have been similarly redesigned. Such increases in accuracy and diminution of weight result in a variety of economies. In the first place, fewer observations need be mo.de at a given point, so that more stations can be occupied each season; secondly, decrease in size nnd weight facilitates the carrying of the instrument to the station and its subsequent installation-no mean item where all material must be back packed through dense forests and up steep mountains; and third, transportation charges have been greatly reduced. The survey has always been on the alert to adopt new ideas and material. It was one of the first to make practical use of the Morse telegraph, and in later days has promptly taken up the radio for longitui::l.e determinations and for communication. The observer, 3,000 miles away on the Alaskan Peninsula, can now instantly obtain the exact time from the Annapolis radio station, instead of being compelled to rely upon a delicate chronometer which mny have been carried many miles over rough country and whose failure would result in days or weeks of delay for repair or replacement or, in the more remote regions, might necessitate abandoning the ·work until another season. Adoption of modern materials has resulted in lighter and more rugged instruments, less likely to be damaged or to become out of ad3ustment, and certain substances, such as invar,_ have permitted the construction of instruments of precision having an accuracy far beyond the possibilities of former times. · Instruments have now been designed, built, and perfected in the Coast Survey instrument shop which will measure the angular position of a point on the earth's surface within one second of arc, which means that a point 40 miles distant can be located within the space of 1 foot, which will determine the differencc in elevation between two points 100 iniles apart within three-fourths of an inch, and which Will measure time to the one one-millionth part of a second. The survey's work has increased manytold during the past few decades and especially in the last few years. There are now about

18

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

three times as many field parties as there were 15 years ago. There has, however, been no increase in the instrument shop personnel to handle the increased work necessary to outfit these parties. As a result their efforts are now confined almost wholly to repairs, new instruments being obtained through commercial channels and usually at increased cost. Such instruments have nlso proven almost universally unsatisfactory, either lacking the necesssary accuracy or being of an inefficient design for the type of work to which we put them. . During the past year a number of new instruments were designed and built by the bureau, foremost of which was the soun·ding engraving machine. This machine will take the place of expensive handwork by engraving figures, legends, etc., on plates usea for printing charts. Besides being of permanent economic benefit, it is interesting to note that the cost of designing and construction by the bureau's instrument division was over $4,500 less than a bid from an outside institution, another evidence of the wisdom of doing such work within the bureau.

Part I.-THE BUREAU'S GREATEST NEEDS

CHAPTER I

,rs A .MONEY SAVER It has been mentioned in my previous annual reports that the present quarters of the survey consist of eight separate buildings, only one of which was intended for the use of the bureau. Even to one only slightly familiar with these unsymmetrical, poorly connected structures it must be evident that their replacement by an.especially designed modern building is inevitable. Constant minor alterations must be made to the present quarters in order to keep the work of the survey from falling behind, and these alterations are often both costly and unsatisfactory. It would seem that the continuing of appropriations for the temporary upkeep of these buildings is a direct waste in vi.ew of their ultimate abandonment, an4 that it would be the_part of wisdom to make the reJ?.lacement mentioned as soon as possible. A modern building will be a money saver in more than one way. It will permit the grouping of similar classes of work, so as to conserve the time now spent in transportation of material and travel of personnel between outlying units. An instance of this is found in the method now in use for delivering copper printing plates to the engravers. These plates, weighing 60 pounds each, are now carried by laborers up five flights of stairs from the storeroom to the engraving section. In a building carefully planned for the bureau this extra labor would be eliminated by the installation of an elevator and by placing these sections closer to their supplies. In some of the rooms where accurate work is essential the lighting is poor, which tends to reduce the quality of the work and also to strain the eres of valuable trained personnel. W11ile the bureau is not behind m its work, it is not up to the standard which could be realized under better conditions. Chart production and the manufacture of instruments could be expedited through up-to-date methods which at present are not attainable because of the awkward arrangement of rooms and shops. The elimination of distances between division and section offices would have the effect of reducing the messenger force, inasmuch as half of their time is oonsumed by long journeys to remote sections. Sanitation would be improved, for it would be much easier to keep a new building clean than the timeworn ones now in use. The matter of appearance is also a big factor, for the existence of cheerful and attractive surroundings will unquestionably promote a better morale among the entire personnel, with an attendant increase of efficiency. Every one of the elements I have enumerated will result in a lowering of unit cost by reason of the greater amount of work done. Close cooperation between the various divisions of the bureau is steadily becoming more difficult because of the initial handicap under which we work. In the last 10 years every effort possible has been put forth to make our buildings as durable and efficient as possible, but the limit has been reached, and unless relief is soon forthcoming the public's interest will most certainly suffer, and I therefore urge that early legislation be enacted which will permit the erection of a suitable headquarters for the survey.

CHAPTER II
THREE NEW TENDERS VITALLY NEEDED

The most urgent need for floating equipment on the Pacific coast is for three power tenders for the three largest surveying ships. These are splendid ships for the work in hand, but they can not develop their full potential efficiency unaided by smaller craft to act as tenders. Much of the coast is rugged, broken, and strewn with offiying rocks and other submerged dangers. Hence, the surveyors must exercise the greatest possible care when approaching the coast and when entering and exploring the inlets and bays. But even with such vigilance it is too much to expect that they will not occasionally find a rock with the keel of their surveying ships if they have no means for exploration but these ships and their small boats. Hydrographic surveying is dangerous work at its best, as a surveying ship must go where others have no business. If, however, accompanied by a tender (a small, decked, power vessel of 50 or 60 tons displacement), the surve:yor gets such advance information as will enable him to navigate }us ship with reasonable safety. Furthermore, the operating expenses of such tenders are small compared with the expenses of the ships, and there is much work on the coast which can not be done from open power boats such as arc carried on the deck of surveying ships but can be done as well from these tenders as from the ships. It is a well-established fact that the smaller the craft that can operate continuously on a hydrograph.ic survey the lower will be the cost of that survey. Hence, the only justification for employing large instead of small vessels on such work lies in the condition of the weather and sea that may be expected to prevail during the working season and the facilities, or lack of facilities, for maintenance of personnel and equipment. In other words, the necessary cost of making a hydrograpl1ic survey of any waters is governed by these factors; the actual cost depends largely upon how nearly the surveyor has selected a type and size of vessel that will just permit him "to overcome these obstacles. . Conditions along the coast are favorable for the operation of such tenders, but, except in a few localities, the tenders could not be maintained efficiently apart from the larger ships becaµse of the long distances to supply bases and the absence of local facilities for making repairs. The surveying ships provide for both of these needs. At one time the bureau had three such tenders, but two of them, worn out and dangerous to operate, had to be scrapped, and the third has already outlived its usefulness and should right now follow the others. They proved to be good investments, having paid for themselves many times over in reduced cost of work. They should be replaced as early as possible. Until these three new tenders are available the unit cost of operating our large vessels will be larger than otherwise; also there will always be danger of some disaster coming to the larger ships until such tenders relieve them of the dangerous first exploration of the waters of unknoWI_l inlets and bays.

MODERN VESSELS NEEDED ON ATLANTIC COAST

21

Replacement of old, worn-out, and a.bsolete types of ~hips by modern vessels, such as has been accomplished on the Pacific coast and proven to be a great economy to the Government, has as yet been impossible on the Atlantic. Here we have two small wooden steam vessels which have deteriorated through age and hard service to such extent that they arc uneconomical to repair and are unsafe in heavy Weather. Every effort has been made to keep the maintenance cost . as low as possible and to limit annual repairs to those items absolutely necessary to keep the vessels running, but even so the maintenance cost of these vessels is ste11dily rising, and without extensive repairs, which are unwise, they must soon be retired. It is considered that they do not warrant such an outlay, but they must be kept in ·service or the work on this coast seriously curtailed. What the bureau needs to replace·these two old vessels is one small ·able vessel of modern design and equipment, with ample power to take her anywhere along tlus coast. She need not be as large us the Pacific coast ships, because there are many more harbors and possible supply buses at no great distance from any part of the Atlantic and Gulfcoasts. Hence, she can be of a size and type that can be operated more economically than the larger ships' on the Pacific surveys. A modern steel vessel of about 600 tons disi:lacement, designed especially for low operating cost when surveyrng, could perlorm the work of these two old vessels and at a considerable saving. :Furthermore, this vessel could be employed on work which neither of these old vessels can undertake because of their la.ck of seaworthiness. Such work is being done now by one other vessel, the only one on this coast fit to undertake it, and the quantity of Work needed to keep the charts up to du.te is beyond the capacity of one vessel.

HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY
PRESSING DEMANDS FOR HYDROGRAPHIO WORK

The invention of different instruments for measuring depth by sound will have a great effect on modern navigation. That such instruments are practicable has been proven beyond the question of a doubt, and it is only a matter of time before these instruments will be in general use on all vessels of the world. Their general use in navigation necessitates the early increase in detailed hydrographic work to develop more closely the character of the bottom. As the aviator can tell his approximate location by the terrain over which he is flying, so characteristic submerged valleys, peaks, plateaus, etc., will serve as landmarks for the nav-igator. Increased information on ch1trts became necessary to meet the requirements for safely navigating vessels of increased size, so additional hydrographic work has become necessary to meet the requirements of modern navigation made possible by the use of these instruments for measuring depth by sound in order that a.II the smaller characteristics, such as depressions, elevations, etc., of the bottom, may be accurately determined and located on the chart, instead of a generalization of the ocean bottom. It is not enough to know that there is a submerged peak or valley in the approximate area, but the accurate location of such a characteristic is essential, so the navigator, in using the chart, can determine accurately, when such a characteristic is discovered with the sounding apparatus, the course to be steered to reach his desired destination. The Coast Survey has three of its vessels equipped with these sonic instruments for mellSuring depth, and on the Pacific coast the position of the vessel is being determined by the use of subaqueous sound ranging which recently has been used successfully for a distance of 206 miles.
IMPORTANCE OF COMPLETING WIRE-DRAG SURVEYS ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST, ESPECIALLY THE NEW ENGLAND COAST

The waters of the New England coast are strewn with large bowldertype rocks wbich are extremely difficult to locate by ordinary hydrographic methods using the sounding lead or even by the sound method. The only sure way of determining that a certain water area is free from danger is to drag this area by use of a wire drag. The importance .of this drag work along the New England coast and in the coral areas along the Florida coast has been mentioned repeatedly in my past reports, but with the limited moneys available for surveys it has been impossible during the last two years to continue work on this extremely important project. This method of wire-dragging the waters of New England is largely completed, and with adequate appropriations two seasons' work will complete the survey for all times and furnish charts that will assure the mariner of the safety of these waters.

In order to meet the requirements of navigation, hydrography from the beach to the 100-fathom curve ~ong the entire Atlantic coast sbhould be executed at as early a date as practicable. This work has een in progress for a number of years and will be continued until completed. The entrances to the many bays and inlets along this coast from New York .south to. Florida are continually changing in depth as a result of storms, tides, etc., which necessitates constant revision work so the charts will represent existing conditions.
om,F COAST

The inshore area of almost the entire Gulf coast is changeable, and a great amount of important work in this area is necessary, as most of our present charts are based upon old surveys.
VIRGIN ISLANDS

During the entire fiscal year one of our vessels has been engaged the hydrographic survey of the Virgin Islands. Since these lslands have been procured by the United States this service has made ll. complete topographic survey based upon new control, and the hydrogtaph1c survey now in progress will make available to the public a completed chart of this area meeting all modern requirements. As numerous coral shoals exist, most of the water area has been examined by the wire drag.

IMPORTANCE OF SURVEYS ON PACIFIO COAST

The work along the Pacific coast, so long neglected owing to inadequate vessel equipment, has been executed vigorously during the la.st two years. In 1918 the vast importance of survey~ng this area "vas brought out in the publication The Neglected Waters of the I>acific Coast. Survey of these waters is not only of importance for the safe navigation of vessels, but also, in extension of the work to the l,OOO-fathom curve, all fishing banks will be thoroughly developed and accurately shown on charts.
SURVEYS IN ALASKA

No section of the United States is more dependent for its developll:J.ent upon correct charts than is the Territory of Alaska as it is entirely dependent upon water-borne transportation. The early development of the Territory was retarded by the wrecking and ~randing of many steamers, incurring much loss of life and property . ..i.ne results of modern surveys have been reflected directly by the lack of serious accidents during the last few years and a material l'eduction in the insurance rates of vessels plying the Alaska waters.

use of the wire drag. The ordinary hydrographic method can be compared to an aviator dropping a weight attached to a measuring line from his plane as he flies over a city. It .can readi!y be realize~ that the chances are very small for the weight to hit the top 01 steeples or monuments, such as the Washington Monument, but ii II horizontal wire were towed between two planes at a fixed distance below the planes it would be sure to hit these obstructions if the1 protruded above the wire. Already the main inside passages of south· eastern Alaska have been wire-dragged and permanently made safe for life and property, but there aPe other important channels, bays, and harbors waiting to be dragged.
OUTSIDE COASTS OF SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA

One of the most important survey projects being carried on in the Territory is a survey of the shore to the 1,000-fathom curve on the outside coast of southeastern Alaska. This work has been continued northward from the boundary line and has made available man)' bays and harbors which were shown on previous charts from sketcheS made by very early explorers; also as a great deal of fishing is done in this area the location of all fishing banks by this work is extreme})' important and of commercial value. ·
CHARTING WESTERN ALASKA

The work of this service in western Alaska has the characteristics of exploring as well as surveying, as this country is little known and very inadequately charted. The surveys are necessary for the future development. The period during which survey operations can be carried on is short, but full advantage has been taken of each season·
HAWAIIA~

ISLANDS

Considerable work has already been accomplished in the Hawaiian Islands, but much more is absolutely necessary so that our charts will meet commercial requirements. Some of the surveys along the main steamship routes need supplemental work. Many roadsteads and harbors need detailed surveys, and the trans-Pacific route lying north of numerous islands and shoals west of the Hawaiian group needs development.
REMAINING WORK IN PlllLIPPINE ISLANDS WATERS

Most of the commercially important water areas of the Philippine Islands have been surveyed. The areas remaining unsurveyed are as follows: 1. All islands north of Luzon and the waters from Luzon to Bashi Channel; north shore of Luzon eastward of Buguey; coastal waters of the west coast northward of Currimao. 2. East coast of Luzon from Cape-Engano to the latitude of the northern end of Polillo. 3. West coast of Palawan southward of Malampaya Sound.

GEODESY
DEMANDS FROM OTHER BUREAUS FOR CONTROL SURVEYS

For years the horizontal and vertical control data obtained frorn field operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have been used by a number of other Government organizations for the control of their surveying and mapping operations. The data furnished have been so valuable that frequent written and oral requests by officials of other bureaus have been made on the survey for data in areas not now covered by the control systems. As rapidly as possible the data are printed and made readily available to those wishing to use them. It seems unfortunate that triangulation and leveling which must ultimately be extended over the country should have to wait, while other Government organizations as well as the public are being handicapped by the la.ck of such data. The reguests from the Geological Survey alone for leveling and triangulat10n data made during the past fiscal year would, if complied with, require more money than now appropriated for such work. In fact, the officials of the Geological Survey have announced that they can not undertake topographic surveying in areas which have not been covered by the first order horizontal and vertical control of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A number of the States working with the Geological Surve! on cooperative basis as far as funds are concerned have requestea surveys in certain areas which have been refused by the Geological Survey because of lack of control data. The Forest Service has made requests on the Coe.st and Geodetic Survey for the extension to their forest ar~as of the precise horizontal control system. This has not been possible on account ·of lack of funds. The data are used by the forest officials in the accurate location of the boundaries of the several forests and. also for the control of their highway, grazing, and other maps. Without such control the maps of the forests will not fit into the general map system of the country which will eventually be extended over our whole area. The General Land Office, seeing the advantage of· having geographic positions for land corners, has utilized all of the existing triangulation data in the construction of their State maps, and officials of that bureau have expressed the earnest hope that tbe horizontal control system of the Coast and Geodetic Survey may be completed in the :rmblic-land States in the near future. It was inevitaole that the United States should have la.id out its public lands for settlement prior to the extension of first order triangulation over our area, but this condition should not be allowed in the laying out of the public lands of the Territory of Alaska· Just prior to his being sworn in as Governor of Alaska, Governor Parks, then in charge of the Alaska branch of the Genera.I Land Office, had a conference with officials of the Coast and Geodetic
26

S~rvey in which he pleaded for the rapid extension of a first order triangulation over tnose parts of Alaska which are likely to have Settlers in the near future. If the triangulation is executed ahead of the laying out of land lines,· one .coordinate system can be used f or all of Alaska. This will make the work of the General Land Office much easier and far less expensive, and the deeds to the property Can be handled much easier and more accurately than if there is a sel.lara te system for eacli of the valleys or -portions of vallevs 'in Ala'Ska. Wherever geodetic data are available, they are used by the Bureau of Soil Surveys in connection with their studies of the character of the soil. 'The United States Army, whenever it makes military surveys and lnaps, whether for defense :purposes or purposes of construction, uses the triangulation and leveling data furnished by the survey. It is frequently the case that data requested can not be furnished because the field work has not been done in the area where the operations Were to be executed. The topograp~c branch of the Post Office Depar~ment makes lfSe, ?f the triangulat10n data of the Coast .and Geodetic Survey which · It finds of the greatest benefit in laying down accurately on the postroute maps the State and county boundaries and the post offices of the country. Officials of the topograrhic branch have frequently exPressed the hope that the horizonta control system of the country should be completed at an early date. Outside of the Government service there are innumerable.calls for data by the officials of cities, States, counties, railroads, power comfanies, and individual surveyors and engineers for trian&ulation and eveling data. Their wants are met as far as it is practicable to do sbo, but many areas for which control data are desired have not yet een covered by the first order triangulation and leveling. . . The coasts of continental United States are quite well cared for 1 dllasmuch as horizontal control data are concerned. This, however, oes not apply t.o Alaska, for there are s.tretches of that coast along Which triangtllation has not yet been extended. A study of the situation would seem to indicate that it would be ~wise business policy for the Government to furnish the data needed 1 ll. so many lines of activity by the bureaus of the Government, ~tates; counties, cities, and by private corporations and individuals . .t.he United States Government is not competing with any private ~oncern in the extension of first order control systems over the count l'y. The to~al expense of c~~pleting the first and. s~cond order COJ?.- . rol systems is only a few nnlhons of dollars, and it is sure that this hlnount would be saved the people of the country every year if we ad completed systems. Surely a 100 per cent dividend makes an ~tractive investment. The wisest economy is the one that brings ""} ~argest. return, not the O?e that means mihimum expenditure or ~nimum mvestment of capital.

CHAPTER V
TERRESTRIAL. MAGNETISM AND SEISMOLOGY'
NECESSITY OF ADDITIONAL COMPASS INFORMATION.

Although the first magnetic survey of the United States is practi-, cally complete, there is a great deal of work which must be done each year. Repeat stations must be occupied at five-year interval.; in all parts of the country, and this means practically continuous work by one party. Without this information, and that obtained at the : magnetic observatories, it would be impossible to keep track of the changes in the earth's magnetism and to supply the demand for information for the mariners' charts; also to meet the needs of local , surveyors and others by furnishing correct data would soon become impossible. It should be understood that the·changes in the earth's magnetism are so irregular that it has not been found possible to predict them. It is only by continued observations at the magnetic observatories that it can be finally determfoed whether there is such a possibility. It is now known, by means of reports from local surveyors who have been sufficiently interested to take the trouble to investigate, that at least 500 of the magnetic stations are no longer useful but yet are needed. Many of these stations also have to be replaced to serve as repeat stations. A number of them are along the seacoast, where they should be kept available for mariners to use in connection with the compensation of their magnetic compasses aboard ship. The stations are also being used in connection with magnetic surveys to determine geological formations with which oil is associated. Recently a magnetic survey was made by this bureau in a part of Texas where most of the county seats were heretofore unoccuyied. Within a year an expert found all of thE!se stations useful m a search by magnetic methods for oil formations. With reference to replacement of stations, the ·State of North Carolina was not satisfied with the partial replacement of stations which was the most to be expected from this bureau and provided funds so that all stations could be put in first-class condition, which work was completed during the last fiscal year. The replacement of stations is fairly complete m California, Florida, and Texas. The absolutely essential work is, then, the maintenance of observatories and the occupation of repeat stations. Of almost equal importance is the replacement of stations and the occupation of county seats where no previous observations have been made. In the northwestern Mountain States observations should be made at other :places in addition to the county seats, so that the distributfon of stat10ns shall be sufficiently dense.

THE

During the present year the amount o{ earthquake insurance taken out has been very lnrgc. Neither the companies nor the insured have any clear idea of a proper basis for such insurnnce. The only adequate basis for both parties is to have as definite knowledge of the conditions as possible. Otherwise the insurance is likely to be dropped after a short period of absence of earthquake activity and there is neither profit nor protection. There are severnl things that the Govc.>rnment can do in this connection to benefit the people. One is to collect with great care all the information that is possible and publish it in tho best form for all concerned. Even though earthquake prediction may not be p'ossible, it is certain that various regions can be designated; as, for example, regions dcfini~ely subject t<? severe e~rthquakes, regions of moderate earthquake act1v1ty, and regions practically exempt from earthquakes. When this can be done, construction, fire protection, un<l other importnnt problems can be worked out nccording to the conditons. The outstanding consideration is that pnrts of the United States where former earthquakes did little harm n.re now subject to considerably lar~er guakes. The fast growth of cities und towns is also a factor. Tne Santa Barbara earthquake would have been of no significance in parts of eastern Californiu, but since it occurred directly under a city it did serious damage. Even in Montnna, where the country is comparatively thinly settled, the earthquake of June 27 was felt in a large number of towns, nnd railroad operation was interfered with to some extent. · The future of the study of enrthqunkes, both from the practical · and scientific viewpoints, will be one of steady progress in solving this important problem if this bureau is provided with sufficient funds to enable it to carry out the important part of the Government program-a part which can be taken by no other organization, however cff ective m its operations.

CHAPTER VI
TIDES AND CURRENTS
NEED OF A CURRENT AND TIDE SURVEY IN BOSTON, PORTLAND, AND PORTSMOUTH HARBORS

With the increase in size and cost of the deep-draft vessels of modern commerce it has become more and more necessary for the mariner to have definite knowled~e of the state of the tide and current in our harbors. In the docking of these large vessels an accurate knowledge of the state of the current is of considerable importance. Likewise important is the knowledge of the peculiar local conditions of the tide and current in various portions of these harbors. . To bring out this detailed knowledge, comprehensive tide and current surveys are absolutely necessary, and the cost of such surveys are unusually small in comparison with the return in dollars and cents to shipping and engineerinf, operations in a harbor. Such surveys have recently been made in New York Harbor, San Francisco Bay, Delaware Bay, and at present one is being made in the inside passages of southeastern Alaska. For the coming year it is proposed to take up the comprehensive tide and current survey of the rmJ>ortant harbors of Boston, Portland1 and Portsmouth. These harbors are important not only commercially but also from the civil and military point of view, and it is to be noted, too, that while these surveys are made primarily for the purpose of navigation the information obtained is of very great value to the civil and military engineer engaged in harbor improvement and marine construction of all kinds. In admiralty cases, especially in cases involving the Federal Government, this bureau is constantly being called on for certified statements of tide and current conditions at the time of collisions and strandings. With accurate tide and current ·surveys of a harbor these statements can be furnished for all time to come; without them the bureau can furnish nothing but an approximation. Without data upon which to base the predictions no definite information can be furnished. · In the matter of sewage disposal and sanitation in these centers of population the data from the current and tide surveys is of vital rmportance to the United States Public Health Service m its sanitary surveys for the determination of pollution of the waters of the harbors. In these matters this bureau is furnishing all available data along these lines. At present final data can be furnished for only three harbors-New York, Delaware Bay, and San Francisco Bay. It is planned to extend the surveys to every harbor of importance, so that the information may be at hand when needed; and it must be emphasized again that the data needed in these various lines of work are all derived from a single survey made primarily for navigatbnal purposes.

REPORT OF THE DiRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OURRENT SURVEY, INSIDE PASSAGES OF ALASKA

31

Through the inside route from tho Pacific Northwest to Alaska, used extensively by American shipping, there are many narrow passa~es in which the velocity of the current at strength is of danger to shipping, even to the larger vessels. It is therefore necessary to know the time of slack water in these passages when the vessel can go through safely. If the mariner can know in advance tho time of slack water, he will save valuable time which is otherwise wasted a.waiting the time of slack water on arriving at some unfavorable phase of current; and for smaller craft it IS imperative that the mariner may be able to time his arrival so as not to enter at the strength of current and become dangerously involved. For the fiscal year 1926, therefore, a current.survey is being made of these narrow passages on the inside route to Alaska. The need for the current and tide survey of these narrow passes has been long ielt by shipping, as it will supplement the very meager data at hand now and will permit ver)" close predictions of the time of slack water to be made which will be incorporated in the current tables published annually in advance by this office. This current survey is in line with the current surveys made of our principal waterways which are taken up in the order of importance from both the civil and military standpoint with special reference to the needs of the mariner. The first current survey was made in New York Harbor in 1923 ; this was followed in 1924 by a survey of San Francisco Bay, and in 1925 by a survey of Delaware Bay.

CHAPTER VII
CHARTS
THEIR VALUE

The Coast and Geodetic Survey holds constantly in mind the fact· that its usefulness to the public it was created to serve is measured chiefly by the character of the nautical o)larts which are it.c; principal product and by the extent to which those charts are placed within reach of the people requiring them. In spite of that constant vigilance it is well from time to time to pause in the daily routine for a comprehensive survey of the existing situation in order to make sure that no possible avenue of better service has been overlooked. Such a survey has just been completed, and the picture it reveals deserves more than the brief menti'on which can be given it here. A chart, to be completely adequate to serve its purpose, must be constructed on correct cartographic principles, must be a simple, legible, and absolutely correct picture of the physiography of the urea it portrays, and, finally, must be accessible to the people who have occasion to use it. In the mntter of cartographic practices the Coast and Geodetic Survey has continued to maintain the leadership which has cr.aracterized its entire history. As a single instance of that leadership it may be noted that in consequence of it the map-making bureaus of the Federal Government have recently undertaken a complete recom;truction of all United States and State maps produced for general public use, in order to eliminate certain objectionable details of mathematical cartography to be found in the present series. The constant, painstaking thought and study upon which that leadership is based has been applied to our own products, and in respect to such qualities in the published chart as mathematical framework, accunw.r of compilation, legibility, simplicity of treatment of minute and intricate detail, and quality of drafting and of reproduction we haYe no occasion to fear a comparison of our product with that produced by any' organization in this or any other country. One of the most essential requirements of the chart is that it shall correctly portray conditions as they exist to-day, not as they were half a century ago. The zone included between the deeps of the ocean and the head of tidewater in its tributaries is undergoing a constant and rapid evolution as a result of the operation of natural forces and of the works of man in adapting these waters to his use. Assuming a chart initially correct, its subsequent value is measured in large degree by the extent to which it is kept corrected to show these constant changes. This task, not orily of producing the orio-inal chart but also of constantly revising it, is.a stupendous one. 'The charts of the Coast and Geodetic Survey probably contain more than a hundred thousand miles of shore line. Although the bureau has been at work on the
32

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND G;EODETIC SURVEY

3~

task for a century, the first complete survey is not yet finished, even for some parts of the United States proper.· In another chapter I have told of the situation with respect to our field work, and the story need not be repeated here. The, disparity be.tween the magnitude of the task with. which we 1tre charged u.od the inadequacy of the facilities provided for its execution is so obvious to everyone·who reads .it.that I need offer no apology for the situation. in which find ourselves in this rospect. We also recognize that other Federal, State, and private agencies arc ma.king sur\Teys and otherwise collecting data which can he used in keeping our charts up to ditte, and that to the extent tluit these data can be obtained n.nd prove uccurate enough for our purpose it would be a reprehensible waste of money to send our own parties to duplicate the work. Therefore, lines of communication stretch between our office and every agency doing work of this 'chamcter with which unremitting effort has enabled us to establish contn.ct. So extensive is this contact that more than 50 per cent of the material utilized in chart correction originates with agencies outside this service. The Army Engineers are the principal contributors of this material. They are constantly cn$aged in survey work in connection with their projects for river and harbor improvements, and the result,ing datu are furnished for our use. It is a pleasure to testify to the completeness and cordiality of this cooperation and to the fact that in two such closely related fields, where a duplication of work might readily exist, none can be found. The Bureau of Lighthouses keeps us informed of all chtrngos made in aids to navigation. State and city engineers, port commissions, and harbor boards usually are glad to furnish data in response to a specific request. This last form of cooperation is defective in that in order to secure new information from these sources we must first know that there is something definite to o.sk for. In ttll effort to overcome this difficulLy we have recently requested the chamber of commerce or similar civic organization of each port on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to cooperate with us by sclecting a qualified p('rson to notify us of any change whiclLsl10uld be shown on the clmrts, thus enabling us to to.kc such steps n.s may ho necessary to secure precise data. · The importance and maguitude of this constant task of chart correction can not he overem1Jhasized. It constitutes the largest single problem with which the bureau has to deal. As an indication of its magnitude, whereas in printing an edition of a topographic nrnp it would be appropriate to run off a supply for several years, our charts must be reprinted with much greater 'frequency, 11.nd h<,fol'e ~ch printing all new data received must be applied. Charts of our important ports along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts n.re reprinted from four to six times a year. The average frequency of printing of 111\ charts issued by the bureau is twice J>er annwn. , Even this frequency of printing does not tell the 'whole story. 'I he very day the chart comes off the press wo begin to apply by hand further correcti ms from data. received since the printing was be~un. These hand corrections a.re limited to most imporLant items, suc11 as changes in aids to navigation or new dangers discovered, hut their aggregate is very large. During the fiscal year Hl25, 1,071,152

cor~ections were ma.de by hand to charts issued from this office and each chart so iSsued carried the information that it was corrected up to the very day issued. : · · The result of this combined effort by the survey and its collaborators to keep the charts corrected is prodti('tive of an excellent product with respect to those areas in whi<'.li mah is effecting .improvements. It does not and can not, however, keep us adequ.ately mfornred of the changes which nature makes, with the result that our charts are seriously in arrears in some localities with respect to changes of the latter character. Fortunately, the changes of human origin are made along the pathways of the commerce which utilizes our charts, whereas the changes which nature is permitted to make without interference by man are in areas of minor navigational importance. Adequate care, therefore, on the whole, is taken of the areas of greatest importance. · · No matter what the excellence of tho chart, its practical value to the public depends to some extent on its availability. Mariners who have used the chart for years know how to obtain it, but there is growing up along the eastern seaboard a very extensive group which looks to the sea for recreation. These people need the chart quite as much as the professional mariner but to a surprising extent do not know that such a thing is in existence or how to obtain it. For this reason there has been paticular need within the past few years of a limited advertisement of our product. We have endeavored to meet this need by creating agencies at additional ports, by displaying a copy of the local chart in the post office, yacht club, or other conspicuous place, by distributing posters for Similar display, and by impressing upon our agents the necessity of informing the public that they have charts for sale. As a specific instance of the results of these efforts some complaints reached us Inst winter that yachtsmen and motor boatmen along the New England coast, for some one of the reasons mentioned, had been unable to obtain charts. Last spring, therefore, we carried on an intensive campaign along· this coast to insure that an adequate stock of charts was available at each agency and to educate the public as · to how to obtain them. The result amply justifies the effort. Our record of charts issued shows that during the 1925 motor-boating season the demand for charts of the coast between New York City and Eastport, Me., increased 27 per cent over that for the sam0 period of the preceding year. While I do not say that this selling campaign was the sole cause of this increase, I consider that it was undoubtedly the major factor. In this generalization I am being conservative to an extent which compels me to discount other statistics. During 1925 the issue of all charts published by the bureau increased 131 per cent over that for 1924. B¥ eliminating the 27 per cent increase for the New England States we find that the issue for all the remainder of our coasts ·was practically identical during tho two years. I believe that had it not been for this "selling campaign" the similarity would have extended to include the former group of States. I must conclude, therefore, that this experimental step outside the usual limits of bureaucratic functioning not only resulted. in better service to the

public but also was productive of a direct financial return to the Government of about eight times its cost.
OOAST EROSION AND PROTECTION

I am becoming more impressed each year with the increasing need for a thorough and comprehensive study of the fundamental principles which form the basis of this important subject. The frequent requests which we receive from engineers and others seeking data and advice as to the best means of protecting some particular section of the shore and the conditions which we observe as we carry on our work along the coast compel two conclusions. The first is that the engineering practice of to-day, as applied to the prevention of erosions from im{>roved sections of the coast, is not established on an adequate basis of observed and correlated physiographic fact which permits of such work being undertaken with the same assurance as to the outcome as attends other engineering projects. The second is that the transformation of these beaches from desolate, uninhabited expanses of dunes and underbrush to populous resorts or extensive summer colonies will certainly be followed by a demand for protection from the inroads of the ocean, and that the protection demanded will be of the assured type which the engineer can not now furnish. That transformation has now been in progress for some years, and its rate is a constantly accelerating one. Already the continued encroachment of the sea upon many of the earlier developments has necessitated protective treatment. These treatments have been of every conceivable kind. As we pass from one improved section of beach to another we see structures so radically different in design that we must deduce great variations in the extent to which they accomplish their purpose. Where the structures have been in existence a sufficient length of time to enable the beaches to adapt themselves to their presence, this deduction is confirmed by the visual evidence of their effect upon the strand. Some structures are seen to be functioning admire.lily; others have served no useful purpose or actually have liad a detrimental rather than a beneficial effect. We must not attribute this unfortunate situation simply to a lack of engineering skill. The trouble lies deeper than that. It results in large part from the fact stated in my first conclusion, that the engineer needs a scientific foundation upon w.hich to build, and that if that foundation is inadequate, as it is in this case, his superstructure will be in danger. This scientific foundation can be established only by careful analysis of a mass of data applicable to the shores to be protected. We can profit only in the most general way by what some ~uropean country has accomplished. A structure which worked admirably on the New Jersey coast might fail entirely in Florida or Texas because of differences in the fundamental conditions. The entire coast should be studied, both as a unit and section by section, in order to determine the basic principles ap'{llicable to a coast of this character and the variations from those principles caused by local conditions in different localities. These studies can not be begun too soon. Even if undertaken to-day-, their results would be urgently needed before they were availal!le. In fact, one State, New Jersey, has already been com-

36

REPORT 01'' '.l.'HE DIRJ<~CTOR, COAST AND GEODETI<; SURVEY

pelled to undertake just such studies of its coast and virtually to assume jurisdiction over its protection as the best means of insuring the permanence of one of the State's most valuable assets. This development of the New Jersey water front increased the assessed value of this narrow strip from $57,000,000 in 1899 to almost $400,000,000 in 1924. Comparable <levelopments may be exfected in other States and are already in progress in some of them. I those States will only havo the foresight to profit by New Jersey's experience, they may save themselves the millions of dollars which municipalities and individual property owners of the latter Commonwealth lost through unproductive efforts to,save their beaches during the years before the State finally assumed jurisdiction. Although this problem transcends the boundaries of any State, it is not my thought to urge that its solution should he undertaken by the Federal Government. In its aggregate it consists of a collection of local problems, and from the en~ineering point of view I believe that it can Ee solved most economically by the cooperative effort of State engineering agencies already in existence. I am not, therefore, recommending that the Coast and Geodetic Survey w1dertake these studies. In spite of that fact, two considerations justify reference to the subject in this report. The Coast and Geodetic Survey, by reason of its contact with every part of these coasts and of its constant dealing with problems of navigation closely related to the one under consideration, has somewhat fortuitously gained a comprehensive jicture of the situation, whereas each of those most directlyconcerne sees only his own small fragment. It is only by seeing the problem in its entirety-by getting a sort of bird's-eye view of it-that we can see the way to its solution. This consideration alone justifies me in pointing out what I believe to be the path to an objective for which many are now groping. In additron, however, the Coast and Geodetic Survey is one of a number of Federal bureaus which, in the course of their normal activities, have collected a great deal of data which would be of great value to any studies made. Any agency set up by the States should have the benefit of these data, and, if necessary, congressional authority to that end should be provided.

CHAPTER VIII
ACCOUNTING DIVISION

Funds for the maintenance and support of the bureau having been appropriated by Congress, the uccounting division, through the disbmsing agent, is char~ed with the duty of procuring these funds from the Tre11Sury, making direct payment of all proper claims, or indirectly through chiefs of party in the field, and rendering an account of nll such transactions to the General Accounting Office. The work of the bureau naturally divides itself into two forcosoffice and field. All claims on account of tho office are, after proper exominntion and administmtive approval, immediately paid QY the disbursing agent, while claims incident to field operations ure paid locally by the chief of party who incurred tho indebtedness. Due to the peculiar nature of the survey's field work on both land and sea (it heing distributed to all sections of t.he United Stat.cs proper, as well us its insular and outlying possessions), it is primarily essential thut its organization be such as to expedite its hscal obligations with the least delay, and to do so it has some 60 or 70 duly designated nnd bonded chiefs of party in immediate charge of operntions acting as specinl dis~ursing officers. This system, so different from most other Government activities, secures immediate, direct, and highly satisfactory results in dealing with Government creditors, with no annoying and long delays. For so meeting these expenses, requisitions for funds (based upon previously submitted and approved estimntes for the project in hand) are made, approved by the director, and funds immediately deposited by the disbursing agent under °'pecial authority of Jaw in the Treasury to the credit of the chief of party's checking account. 1'his method of advance produces direct results nnd elimmntes tho tnany and innumeruble customary delays. 'l'he accounts for expenditures made hy these chiefs of party from such ndvances of funds are submitted monthly to the disbursing !I-gent, promptly exumincd, approved by the director for all proper Items, and then credited to the account of the chief of pnrty on account of ndvanccs by the disbursing agent. The expeditious and prompt exomination of these accounts submitted and credit therefor given results in the carrying of minimum balances. Without any doubt the directness of the entire system is productive of more economy in Government expenditures nnd far greater satisfaction on the part of those with whom the bureau hns business ~ransactions tl11m could possibly be ntt11ined by the more usunl and Indirect methods generally employed.

CHAPTER IX
INSTRUMENT DIVISION
VITAL TO THE BUREAU'S PROGRESS AND EFFICIENCY

The Coast Survey has the reputation of being among the world's foremost organizations for the scientific surveymg and mapping of the earth's surface, and its methods and instruments have be.en widely copied. If it is to maintain that reputation, it is essential that 1t be provided with the additional personnel necessary to design and develop new instruments which will embody the latest and best methods and materials of the instrument-making art. Development work in our shops is almost wholly at a standstill, and its effect is being felt most keenly. Various improvements, which we know would result in more accurate and economical observations, can not be taken up. More specifically, several instruments of major importance are to be designed and built as soon as means are available for so doing. For instance, the. necessary data is at hand by which it is proposed to design a new theodolite for first-order triangulation. This instrument will be smaller, lighter, more easy to operate and transport, and the improved design will permit the making of· the necessary observations at a station in less time with equal or greater accuracy than is now possible, and the net result being a saving in time, transportation and installation charges, and reduction of sources of error. An improvement in the tide-predicting machine, which will make it self-recording so that tide tables can be comr.iled directly from the printed record made by the machine itself, will be an important change in our equipment. With the proposed change, the record will be automatically prepared for the prmter and all these errors eliminated, as well as speeding up the work and doing away with the major portion of the checkmg. This type of work, as well as the higher grade of instrument repairing, is much more cheaply and satisfactorily performed in the survey's own shops. It is difficult to get such work done by commercial concerns, as they are not familiar with our special problems nor with the uses to which the instruments are put. Development work in particular needs constant supervision, as improvements are frequently suggested as the instrument is being built. Tho survey can not provide constant factory inspection, nor can contractors be expected to make changes in work they have agreed to perform unless properly reP.aid. Our experience has been that all such construction is done much less expensively by our own force. As an instance, a sounding engraving machine was recently designed and built in our own shop at a cost of $965.58 as compared with a price of $5,500 quoted us for a machine to do similar work. As regards repairing, it can not only be done more cheaply in first cost in our own shop, but losses due

to stop:page of field work while repairs are being made arc cut down or elimmated. Such work can not be done under contract except where there is ample time. The above instances illustrate the need for an adequate force to develop and repair our instrumental equipment. To perform our work efficiently and economically, we should design new apparatus in which is incorporated the best methods and materials and should perform our own re.Pairs to insure high quality and low cost. An mcreased personnel is necessary to bring this about.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR

The organizntion of the Washington office of the bureau is presented by the organization chart opposite. The accomplishments during the fiscal year by divisions and sections follow.
CHIEF CLERK

'l'he principal duties of this division are the care, custody, and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the bureau; the supervision of the expenditures for office expenses, mcluding the purchase of supplies f?r the office, for chart-printin~ _work, a~1d to some extent for the field, the cn,re of most of the or1gmal records of the field surveys, us well as the library of printed publications; the general supervision of nil matters relating to the personnel work, including reports of lenycs of absence; the custody and accounting for the receipts from the sale of charts, publications, etc.; and the direction of the engineer, eleetricinn, wutch, messenger, labor forces, and other employees engaged in the ca.re, maintenance, und protection of the huildmgs occupied hy the bureau in the District of Columbia. 1'he more important accomplishments during the year have been a <'Ontinuation of the thorough renovation of the buildmgs. While this work is still in progress, and it is a lengthy program with the small foreP of employees and funds available, the improvements and sanita~ion that are necessary, the present accomplishments in the way of pamted rooms and modern fixtures offer a very pleasing contrast when compared with conditions and equipment previously existing. During the year the installation of all-metal storage racks in which to place the copper plates from which are printed navigation charts issued by the bureau and racks for one storage room was begun. The material for these racks is on ho,nd. Due to shortage of labor fo1·ce the complete installation will take considerable time. These racks are to replace old wooden racks that eonstitutc a fire hazard, besides having become so weakened by necessary overloading, due to lack of other storage space, that they arc collapsing under the load thev are carrying. . I)uring the year the installation of metal shelving and storage cases in the attic of the chart, instrument, and archives building was practically completed, so that records that are necessarily preserved but us'1d ~omewhat infrequently are stored in space that is useless for any other purpose. Tho moving of these records to the attic has released over 900 square feet of desirable office space which is now being used for office purposes.

So far reports have been made on approximately 50. per cent o the stations established by the bureau of which the_present condition of preservation and usefulness was unknown, Illustration No. 10, opposite page 62, shows graphically what this cooperation has accomplished. In the library and archives 140 hydrographic and 59 topographic:; sheets, each representing n~w surveys made by the bureau, were received .. Other additions were blue prints (mostly showing surveys :made by Army engineers), 2,217; maps, 1,611; charts, 2,171; field, ofi?.ce, and_ observatory. records, .2,778; photographs (negatives and prmts), 456; lantern shdes, 203; books access10ned and catalogued, 702; books catalogued but not accessioned, 110. During the year the expenditures for general expenses of the bureau were $80,274.38. The total number of J>ermanent and temporary employees in the office and field forces, which includes commissioned officers and all employees appointed through civil-se.rvice certification, is: Officp ·force, 225; field force, Hl2; total, 417. These figures do not include ~he persons engaged as rod.men; chainmen, heliotropers, and others in the field parties nor any enlisted men on vessels. The statistics in regard to leave ()f absence during the calendar Year are: Annual leave, 7,302 days; sick leave, 1,356 days; withoutpay leave, 766; and accrued leave, 2,210 days. While the number of omployees naturally varied on account of resi~ations and vacancies, calculated on the number actually in the service on June 30, 1925, as a basis of computation, the average annual leave taken during the ;year hy each employee was approximately 17.51 days and sick leave
3.25.

1'hc receipts from the sale of charts BJ;ld nu.uticnl publications prepared by the bureau amounted to $49,850.02, and the fund~ realized from the sale of old property, work done, and miscellaneous ·sources amounted to $2;088.29.

these units will be relieved- to a considerable extent of the final completion of field records and tlie time thus saved devoted to field production. Considerable time has been given to the special problems of the International Hydrographic Bureau. A new publication, entitled "The Construction and Operation of the Wire Drag and Sweep," was prepared during ·the year. This publication-will supersede the presea:J;t.de,s.cription of the,-w.ire drag and will include changes in the standard wire drag and its operation that have been made and will contain description and details of the wire sweep and light wire drag recently developed by the bureau. The compilation, proof reading, and indexing of Coast Pilot Alaska, Part I, were completed and the volume was in the hands of the printer at the end of the year. The compilations of Coast Pilot, Gulf Coast, and Inside Route Pilot, Key West to the Rio Grande, were started and were well in hand at the end of the year. SupJ?lements to the following coast pilots were prepared and issued: Atlantic Coast, Section A, St. Croix River to Cape Cod; Atlantic Coast, Section B, Cape Cod to Sandy Hook; Atlantic Coast, Section C, Sandy Hook to Cap_e Henry-; Atlantic Coast, Section D, Cape Henry·to Key West; Porto Rico and Virgin Islands; Pacific Coas~ California, Washington, and Oregon; Alaska, Part II; Philippine islands Parts I and II. . The vesseis of the bureau have been maintained in proper repair for carrying on field work. Extensive repair work has been done on the Pathfinder and the Ranger. The cost of this work on the former amounted to one-sixth and on the latter to one-fourth of the entire appropriation for repairs. Improvements in surveying equipment have been effected by the installation of sonic devices for depth sounding on the Lydonia and Pioneer; by the design of a short wire drag which can be compactly stowed aboard ship for use in the examination of dangerous shoals and harbor channels; by the construction of a light submarine cable with high tensile strength for radio acoustic ranging; and by the assembly of a standard drag buoy capable of retaming a 20-pound pressure Preliminary estimates have been made for the construction of new survermg vessels. Inspection has been made of Diesel driven and Diesr electric-driven tenders, and a study has been made of a more suitable type of engine for use on the small hydrographic launches. Specifications have been written for the purchase of special equiprnent needed on the vessels . .Alterations have been made on the Natoma to furnish additional accommodations. A saving of funds has been effected through the transfer of material reported surplus by other Government bureaus. Radio equipment, an electric generator, and four launches have been obtained in this manner at a nominal cost.

.DIVISION OJ<' OHAR'I'S'

During the fisc.a.l year ending June 30, 1925, the division of charts continued its task of furnishing to other branches of the Goveril-:ment and tq the maritime public correct and up-to-date charts, on which were incorporated the data contained in the mass of informa; tion reaching this office in a constant stream from sources both within and without the service. It also made gratifying progress in the production of Iiew charts resulting from the recent completion of surveys by our field parties or from the policy of replacing certain existing charts with others conforming to our present-day standards. The issue of charts shows a gratifying increase. The total issue and condemnation for 1925 was 230,535 as compared with 221,543 for 1924. The number of charts actually sold to the public was 102,011 in 1925 as against 94,699 in 1924. The issue of charts is the principal single factor with which to measure the bureau's service to the public, and the increases noted are a matter of satisfaction to the survey. As explained in previous reports, however, the number of charts issued does not afford an accurate measure of the task incident to their production. The true measure is obtained by consideration of the amount oJ data received in the office to be used in the construction or correction of charts. In this respect also the ;rear has been a gratifying one. A study of the detailed statistics mdicates that 1925 has been the biggest and most productive year in the history of the division. New mformation received, in spite of the increase in its amount and with no increase in personnel to handle it, has been ·ven to the public more promptly than at any other time of which have knowledge. . The program adopted for 1925 was a tentative one, subject to modification as future conditions might warrant. Sixteen new charts were contemplated. Of these, four were laid aside indefinitely to await the receipt of additional field data. Eleven were delivere~ during the year, a.nd one, delayed to a less extent to await field data, was ready for printing on July 6. One additional chart not on the program was completed during the year and seven existing charts were reconstructed.

SJ;>ecial em.Phasis was placed during the year on furnishing informat10n and rmproving instruments and conditions at the observatories as well as activity in preparing publications. The information service to local surveyors was continued upon the same b~is as heretofore. The bureau is now in touch with 2,300 local surveyor$ who use magnetic m·ethods and has obtained information in regard to the usefulness to the local surveyor of about 43 per cent of its magnetic stations. · Special magnetic information has been furnished for the manuals of the Army used in surveying. Information in regard to magnetic' storms has been furnished to the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which is making a special study of this subject. Magnetic declination tables have

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST. AND GEODETIC SURVEY

45

been furnished for the World Almanac. An isogonic map .of New England was trepared for a specinl publication by Doctor Keith, of . · the Geologica Survey. The method of prepamtion of publications has become fully stand~rdized and permits of a very large part of the work being done by Junior mathematicians or computers. Much of the effect of this tnethod has been lost, however, by the fact that these positions have Only been filled temporarily, and the progress in the reduction of observatory results is not satisfactory. The situation can not be reruedied without an increase in personnel. Special attention has been given to the improvement and replacell:l.ent of observatory instruments. The absolute instruments are to be ·improved as rapidly as conditions permit. The instruments remove<l from the Porto Rico observatory arc being put in condition before installation in the new observatory. The experimental work a.~ Cheltenham is paving the way to further improvements which ~11 be adopted. The effective cooperation of the instrument division J.n this matter has already greatly improved the condition of the instruments. Within a few years the equipment will be complete, and that with a very small expenditure of funds. The new buildings of the Porto Rico observatory were designed in Washington, under the immedinte supervision of the division, by the officer in charge of the construction. The design is based on that of ~~her observatories of this bureau and of the Carnegie Institution of vv ashington, which cooperated by furnishing blue prints. Some study has been given to the difficulties at the Honolulu observatory, which later may require a change of site. Members of the division have taken part in the work of the American Geophysical Union and the International Geodetic and GeoP~ysical Union. Some hold positions in these organizations. Contact '"1th the work of other institutions and countries is particularly useful, as all of the work of the division is related to the study of the earth as a whole. Close cooperation has been maintained with the depart~ent of terrestrial magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Wash1ngton. Tho need for more study of the observatory results, with a view to ~ b taining full return from the expenditures made in obtaining them, ls being borne in mind. It is hoped to CaITY on this study each year. ~ll im..,Portant preliminary work was the rewriting of the publication, .i.ne Earth's Magnetism, which appraises the present situation and affords an excellent basis for further progress. The following publications were issued during the year:
t' Magnetic Declination in Florida. (This is the second of the series of publicatona of magnetic data by States.) Magnetic Deoliuation in North Carolin.a. (Third of the series.) Of Observatorv Results for all the observatories for 1921-22. (Permauent record changes in.the earth's magnetism.) · abItesults of Observations made by the bureau in 1923-24.

The conta-ct with local users of magnetic data is no'\\' on a satisfactory basis in 30 States, and another year should complete the first campaign. It may be considered that the work has been completed in six States. PERSONNEL.-The need for an additional mathematician, two computers, and one clerk to carry on the magnetic work is extremelY. urgent. The work is suffering at the present time from lack of personnel, and increased demand for information is rapidly making the situation very serious.
SEISMOLOGY

In previous years all earthquake records from the magnetic observa· tories were analyzed and the phases furnished to the Weather Bureau for publication. The passage of legislation making seismology a definite part of the work of this bureau resulted in immediate ex· pansion of our program in order to meet the demands of the public and insure that the earthquake data accumulated after the dis· continuance of this work by the Weather Bureau should not be lost. Special effort has been given to the study of the observatory records, to accumulation of reports of visible and felt effects of earthquakes, to the elaboration of a system for accomplishing this latter result, and to preparing results for publication. The first publication, which was for the first quarter of 1925, was nearly ready for the printer at the close of the fiscal year. A great deal of time was required to meet the demands.-0f the publio for i:rif ormation in regard to the St. Lawrence Valley earthquake of February 28 and the Montana and Santa Barbara earthquakes near the end of June. Starting a proper program for this work included investigation of earthquake literature and consultation with various organizations. The aim is to coordinate the program of existing work for the benefit of seismology as a whole and to secure proper cooperation of all organizations interested in this subject. There is a very strong demand for information of immediate practical value, such as earthquake maps, which can be made ~ossible only through an increase in personnel. The bureau publication, Earthquake Investigation in tlie United States, sets forth the aims of the survey in taking up seismological work.

t~e following heads: Field work, reductions, datum planes, and pre-

The work of the division of tides and currents is comprised under

dictions. The routine work of all sections is now practically up to date. . Tidal observations were made at nine primary stations on the Atlantlc coast, four on the Gulf coast, six on the Pacific coast, tlu·ee in Alaska, and one at Honolulu, Hawaii. The tidal marigrams as they are received at this office are tabulated as to hourly readings· and·high and low waters for the definition of all tidal planes. As a by-product of the tide work at these stations, these tabulations furnish a longPeriod sea-level datum for the use of engineers locally and for initial or "tie-in" points for the net of precise levels being extended to all Parts of the country. The predictions of the currents for the 1926 Pacific Coast Current ~ables were made in the fiscal year 1925; all other predictions, both tide and current, for the 1926 tables were made the previous fiscal Year. The predictions for all tide tables for the calendar year 1927 Were begun November 1, 1924, and completed March 26, 1925. The ~redictions for all current tables for the calendar year 1927 were egun April. 7,.1925, and completed Jun.e 30, 1925. . The predictions and subnnttal to prmter of all tide and current· table manuscripts have been advanced by degrees each year for the Past five years with the intention of having all tables for any calendar Year ready for issue by July 1 of the preceding calendar year. This schedule has now been attained for the first time, all tables for the Year 1926 having been received from the printer by June 30, 1925. This schedule will be continued without difficulty in the future. . The following table, showing the number of copies of the tide tables Issued each fiscal year for the 10 years 1915-1924, is indicative of the 'Usefulness of these publications:

contained in tho tirle-tnhlo publications.

Heretofore the Current Tables issued by this bureau have given the marim1r the times of slack water only and the mean current. velocity. Due to the diurnal inequality in the currents on the Pacific coast, rt is also of value to the mariner to know the velocity of each flood and ebb current at strength and the time of such maximum strength, since the velocity at strength on one flood or ebb current may differ materially fro'm that of the next. During the past. fiscal year constants have been prc>pared for the tide-predicting machine from all available <latn, and the a<lditionul information rclntive to the predicted time and vc>locity at strcn~th of each flood and ebb current at the principal current stlttions 1or every clay in the year haYe been included in the Current Tnbles, Pacific Coast, 192!). ObserYations of currents i'ere made at three light vessels on the Atlimtic ·coast and one on the Pacific coast. AnRlyses of these observations have been made in such a way as to correlate wind and current for the formulation of general rules on coastal currents for thr aid of the mariner. The first results of this current study appeared in the separate current tables for the calenclnr ye1tr 1923. These tahles arc being enlarged in scope each year. Special Publication No. 98, A Manual of the Harmonic Annlysis and Prediction of Tides, was received from the printer on August 12. 1924. This work is a manual of instruction for the tidal mathcm1ttician and comprises 410 octavo pages, consisting of 170 pages of text. 143 pages of tables, 97 pages of harmonic constants for tho world, and :~4 illustrations. Special Publication No. 111, Tides and Currents in New York Harbor, was received from the printer March 9, 1925. This publication comprises 170 pages and 52 illustrations and constitutes the discussion and interpretation of the results from the current and tide survey made in 1923 in New York Harbor, correlated with scattered observations made at various times in the past. During the year tho manuscript of a special publication, P.ortablc Aut?matic Tide Ga~ge, was pre{>ared._ The page proo~ has been received from the prmter, and delivery 1s ex{'ccted early m the next fiscal year. It is the purpose of this publication to give a description of the portable gauge recently developed by this bw·eau and to. furnish the field engineers of the survey detailed instructions for it? installation and operation. .., . ·The manuscript of a publication on the currents and tides 9f. San. Francisco Hm·hor was prepared during the year, and the gallef: proof was received from the printer June 2, 1925. This publication

eonstitutes the discussion and results from the current and tide survey ?f San Francisco Harl?or made in the f?.scal :year ~924, correl'Q.iM: with scattered observations made at various trmes m the past. · The manuscript of a publication on tidal bench marks in the Bistrict of Columbia has been in preparation at intervals during the Year. It is expected to be ready for press early in the next fiscal year. ·The . manuscript of a publication, Coastal Currents Along the Pacific Coast of the United States, was being prepared during the Past fiscal year and will be ready-for press early in the next fiscal year. The manuscript of ·a publication, Datum' Planes and Their Determinations, was pnrtly prepared. It ,.,,.ill be completed and will b e ready for press near the end of the year. The observations obtained from the current and tide survey of Delaware Bay have been partly analyzed. These analyses will be completed during the next ye1ir, the results discussed and interpreted, ~~d the manuscript of a publication prepared similar to the ones for .1.~ew York Harbor and for San Francisco Bay. In addition, the imProYements to our present current predictions ma.de possible by this survey are beir,ig incorporated in the present cuITent tables for the Use of the mariner. The cooperative arrangement with the British Admiralty in connection with the exchange of tidal predictions has been continued ll.~d extended. This cooperation begim with the exchange of pred11ctions for six American ports for the predictions of six British ports. ~ has since boon extended to the exchange of 16 American predictions for 16 British predictions. Since this constitutes about 20 "Per .cent of our tide predictions, the economy effected for each country Is obvious. The Canadian 1'i<lal and Cun-ent SurYey has cooperated with the Coast and Geodetic Survey with considerable advantage to this bureau. At our request the Canuditm survey recently maintnined an automatic tide gauge at euch end of Seymour Narrows, British Columbia, for a period of three months. The observations from these two stations were furnished the Coast Survey, analyzed at ~hhe W a.shington office, and the constants from this nnalysis used on · e tide-predicting machine for the prediction of tho times of slack :vater. The times and velocities of the cuITent at strength in this 1 lUportant waterway are used by American shipping on the ScattleA~a.skan run. The predictions based on this observational data will appear for the first time in the Current Tables, Pacific Coast, for the <lnlendar year 1926 . . During the year a current diagram larger than heretofore published ~the current tables and printed on heavy chart paper was issued for n_ntucket .and Vi~eyar<l Sounds. This is. the first of a proposed ~eries covermg the mlund waters of the Umted States.
DIVISION OF ACCOUNTS

From July 1, 1924, to June 30, J925, the actual disbursements on nccount of approprjations for the Coast and Geodetic Survey ~n;tounted to $2,133,718.02. It must be understood, however, that yhis docs not represent the actual expenses of the survey for the fiscal . tear 1925, but only the actual disbursements.

men ts from each appropriation and subitems thereof with all detailed information as to tlie character of the expenditure. These expenditures include the accounts of all chiefs of parties in the field located throughout the United States, Ala.ska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, the Philippme Islands, and the Virgin Islands. From 30 ~o 50 chiefs of p~rties were engaged on field duty at various times durmg the year, bemg financed through advances made to them by this division, and. accounts arising under such advances were submitted to an<l through this division to the Treasury Department. The total appropriations for the fiscal year 1925 were $2,327,650.
INSTRUMENT DIVISION

The function of the instrument division is to provide the equipment used by the field parties of the survey, which involves the pur:. chase and inspection of standard and special makes of various kmds of surveying and navigating instruments, numerous articles of general property, and the issuance of such instruments and e9uipment to the parties. The instrument division also designs spec18.l instruments, apparatus, and improvements, compiles specifications, makes drawings and repairs, and adjusts instruments returned after use in the field. It aiso maintains the property-record system which records the transference of equipment to and between the field parties. During the past year a number of new instruments and improvements were designed and built, as follows: SOUNDING ENGRAVING MACHINE.-A machine was designed and built in the instrument division for the purpose of engraving the figures and legends indicating sounding depths on copper electrotype plates used for printing charts. This machine is also adapted to perform the same work on photographic negatives used in tne lithographic process of printing. The machine is much more compact and convenient to handle than the type commonly used for this purpose and is a great deal less expensive, the total cost for its design and construction being $965.58 as compared with the price of $5,500 quoted this bureau for a machine of the usual type, a net saving of $4,.534.42. The ability of this machine to engrave on a photographic negative is a great advantage, doing away with much tedious handwork and facilitating the altering oI existing lithographic plates. PORTABLE AUTOMATIC TIDE GAuoE.-:--Several improvements were made in this instrument during the year, making it easier to adjust; easy to install new· clocks, without sending the gauge back to the office, and an im:J;>ortant change was made in the arrangement of the coyoterpoise sprmg which eliminates rusting and acddental disengagement from the shaft. The changes in design eliminated several parts, thus ma1dng the gauge simpler. A pen was used as a stylus instead of a pencil, giving a clearer and more permanent trace of the tidal curve. · BASE TAPE TREHMOMETERS.-These accurate and exnensive thermometers are used in a small.brass holder, the design of which has been the cause of frequent breakage of the bulb. The holder was redesiimed, so that this fault was eliminated. PLANE TABLE.-The telemeter rods used with the plane-table outfit require a metal brace which is attached by two thumbscrews. Considerable annoyance and delay has been experienced, as these

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETlC SURVEY

51

braces were not interchangeable, and the design has been altered &ch cordingly to remedy this defect. The thumbscrews whereby: the oard is fastened to the tripod are frequently lost. They have been :ade interchangeable, so that replacements can be furnished without elay. · WIRE-DRAG Buoy SPACER.-This instrument has been redesigned, Elo that the two siz~, large and small, are combined into one, thus l'educing the quantity to be carried in stock. GEODETIC LEVEL RoD.-The machine for graduatillg these rods, '\V''l'hich was begun last year, was completed, and operates satisfactorily. his machine applies these graduations in such a manner that the !natter of accurate location, width of mark, and sharpness of line is tnherent in the machine and is not dependent to any marked degree , gn the personal element. Two rods were painted for the Geological ourvey during the year, using this apparatus. PocKET TAPES OF MoNEL METAL.-There has always been a large loss in the ordinary steel pocket tapes, used by the survey for its l'ou_gher measurement, as these tapes rust easily and are also brittle ll.nd easily broken, if kinked. A number of similar tapes were procured of Monel metal, which is a material not readily corroded in ordinary '1se and is also tough and pliable. These tapes, while slightly more 6Jcpensive in :first cost than the steel, are expected to be a real economy bY \'"irtue .of long life.

(e) PunLICATIONs.-Triangulation, coast of North Carolinai Precise Leveling in Oregon; Triangulation Manual; Precise Leveling Manual; Triangulation, Traverse, and Leveling in South Carolin&i Earth Movements in California; Form of the Geoid; Investigation of Earth Tides. DIVISION OF CHARTS

As stated in my preceding annual report, the division of ch'arts1 in its task of constructing new charts or reconstructing existing chart.s based on modern field surveys, is now so nearly caught up with the field work of the survey that the division can not lay out m advance a program of work of this character based on recently completed field work which will be adequate to tax its capacity for the yea.Ti nor can it anticipate the receipt of records of field work in progress with sufficient certainty as to date of receipt and condition of records to justify a general inclusion of such field work in the program for the year. A program of chart production calling for the completioJlf of 14 new charts, reproduction of 14 old charts, and simplifying o 12 old charts has therefore been adopted tentatively. DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM AND SEISMOLOGY The program for 1926 is as follows:
MAGNETIC WORK

Complete the observatory publication for Cheltenham for the printer. Complete the publication for Missouri. Prepare the State publications for California and Texas. If possible, commence work on the publication for Georgia. Prepare for publication magnetic results obtained during 1925. Furnish information to local surveyors and those J>ersons or in· stitutions investigating difficulties in radio, telegraph, and cable communication. Furnish magnetic information for charts. . Supervise investigations at Cheltenham in regard to magnet10 instruments. Carry out the necessary office work in connection with the coJll' pletion of the Porto Rico observatory and placing it in operation .· Take part in the discussion of observatory results in cooperatioll with other organizations in an effort to solve some of the mysteri~ of the earth's magnetism. Execute such work on the preparation o observatory results as the limited personnel permits.
SEISMOLOGY

Secure reports of visible and felt effects of earthquakes and iJJJ.· prove the system of obtaining these and the records themselves. Prepare the quarterly reports on earthquake investigation. . Supervise improvements of instruments and installation of nefl instruments at Tucson, Ariz. Study of earthquake literature and investigation of our results.

It is planned, if practicable to do so, to install a light electric lnotor for operation of the tide-predicting machine and add an ~~tachment for automatically printing the times and heights of the lllgh and low waters, in lieu of the locking of the machine and the %pying of these data by hand, as at present. Should the plan prove · feasible, a considerable saving in time will be accomplished and, in t~dition, an increased accuracy obtained by the elimination of the 'l'\Ullan factor. The observations obtained on the current survey in the passages ()f ~outheastern Alaska will be analyzed as soon as possible upon their receipt from the field, and the improvements to our present ~llrrent predictions, made possible by this survey, will be incorporated ln the ~resent current tables for the use of the mariner. t The foregoing constitutes the outstanding features of the program ~r. the next year in addition to the normal routine work of the ~~yision of tides and currents. In general, the work of the division ".IJ.l be so arranged as to take up immediately the work upon which ~e publication of charts and the prosecution of the general field ~r:Jr of the bureau depend; after that the energies of the division :111 be directed toward keeping the tide and current tabulations and l 0tnputations up to date and to issuing in the form of publications the ;lffe mass of material that has been accumulated in the division and · ch is of considerable value to the navigator, the engineer, the 11 c1entist, and the public generally.

The program for thiS' division will be a continuance of the dutieS incident to disbursing the funds appropriated for the operation of the bureau, including the financing of all chiefs of parties at work ill the field, together with the verification of all accounts arising under such advances. . .
INSTRUMENT DIVISION

The program for the fiscal year 1925-26 will be to maintain the existing stock of instruments .in readiness for use, making. needed repairs and replenishing depleted stocks; to make improvements ill instrumental design and construction and to design and build such new instruments and machines as may be needed; to construct ne",. instruments of special types, including sounding clocks, automatic signal lamplighters, and a measuring device for more easily and accurately reading the sounding tube.

Part III.-IN THE FIELD

CHAPTER I
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE FIELD DURING THE FISCAL YEAR
UYDROORAPIUC WORK'

The field work accomplished during the fiscal year 1925 has been e?Ctremely gratifying as, owing to adequate equipment, appropriar~rons, and personnel, it has been ,possible to undertake tho surveys of extremely difficult areas which hitherto it has been impracticable to 11.ccomplish on the scale warranted by their importance . . On the Atlantic coast two vessels have been continuously employed 1 11 executing surveys. Several detached parties have been doing l'e'Vision work in the field. The survey of Lake Okeechobee was com~ l>leted. On the Gulf coast one vessel has been employed in the survey of Tampa Bay and approaches, and a field party has been engaged in ~aking a coast pilot revision from Key West to the Rio Grancle. .· On the Pacific coast one vessel has been continuously employed in Off~hore soundings: During· the winter two of the survey vessels \\.·l11ch hnve been working in western Alaska during the summer ionths were employed on offshore work ttlong the California coast. etached parties have been doing revision work in the field. A field be~ision of the coast pilot of Cnlifornia, Oregon, and Washington is erng made. The Alaska surveys have been carried on by four "essels, two working in southeastern Alaska and two in western tlaska. In the outlying possessions of the United States one vessel ~ been employed on surveys in the Virgin Islands,· three in the ?hilippine Islands, and one small party in the Hawaiian Islands durrn~ the entire year, ttnd another for about three months during the Wintertime in these islands. 'rhe chief of the division of hydrogruphy and topograp}iy made a Eirsonal inspection of the work being carried on m the Philippine .sands. His report contained tecommendations for the future survey fork in the isla?ds, which prog~am has l!een approved. It provides 0 r the completion of the work m these JSlands at as early a date as llral'cticable with the equipment and RJ?propriations available . . he need has been felt for some time for a modified wire drag b~ta.blc for occasional use by survey vessels, the standard apparatus 1ng too cumbersome for storage in the limited space usually availt 1e, By using inflated canvas buoys and modifying other parts of \'he equipment a light wire dra.g was developed by field parties on the ~sels at Seattle during the winter. This apparatus can be stowed d th.out difficulty and Will result in considerable saving in the cost of 6 '1'eloping shoals found during bydrographic surveys. \\>a lllethod of buoy control of precise dead-reckoning work has been a 0 rked out by a party working on the cast coast and has resulted in considerable increase in accuracy. 67

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC ~URVEY

Several special examinations were made in the field for the purpose of compiling supplements to the various coast pilots. Among these was the inspection voyage of the Ranger from Norfolk, Va., to Beaufort, S. C., via the inside route, to obtain information relative to the new system of aids to navigation in this waterway. Necessary field examinations were made for a new edition of Coast Pilot, Gulf Coast, and a new Inside Route Pilot, Key West to the Ri@ Grande. An examination for a new edition of Coast Pilot, Pacific Coast, was in progress at the end of the fiscal year. DETACHED PARTIEs.-Detached parties made a resurvey of Scituate Harbor, Mass.; Fire Island Inlet, N. Y.; Beach Haven Inlet, N. J.; and completed the survey of Baltimore Harbor commenced during the previous fiscal year. A search was made for rocks reported in Bucks Harbor, Me. Two small detached J?arties were engaged in work in the District of Columbia, for which mstructions were ISsued at the request of thll Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks. This work included the determination of the high-water line of Alexanders Island and the marking of the same and a survey of the Virginia side of the Potomac River from Jones Point, Alexandria, to the northwest boundary of the District of Columbia. A party on the launch Elsie completed the survey of Lake Okeechobee. The topography of this lake was accomplished by the aerial photographic method, actual flying being done by officers working under .the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department. Two resurveys of the bar at the entrance to Willa.pa Bay were made by d"etached parties, the first being made in July and. the. latter examination of the north channel across the bar being made iJJ February. As this bar is continuously changing in depth, these frequent resurveys are valuable in determining the deepest water at the entrance to the bay. A detached party made a survey of the entrance to the Quillayu~e River.

A brief description of the principal field projects on which work. was done during the year is given below. The first order triangulation along the forty-ninth parallel was continued throughout the months. when observations could be made· One party worked in Montana on that project during the early part of the fiscal year, and three parties were put into the field in the spring of 1925 in an effort to finish the triangulation to the Pacific OceaJl during that field season. The high mountain peaks are covered deeplY with snow from early autumn until late spring, making the working season very short, while forest fires in midsummer greatly hinder the progress of the work. In order that a better adjustment of the triangulation along the forty-ninth parallel may be made, a belt of first-order triangulatioJl was begun m the spring of 1925, to extend from the forty-ninth parallel to a connection with the Utah-Washington arc of first-order triangulation along the Columbia River south of Pasco, Wash. lt is expected that this cross link of first-order triangulation will be completed during the field season of 1925. In South Dakota a line of first-order traverse was run from Siou,; Falls to Chamberlain, where first-order triangulation was begun and was extended to the Black Hills and to a connection with the one huD' dred and fourth meridian arc of triangulation in that region. The informal agreement with the Geodetic Survey of Canada for cooperative work in completing the first-order control along th 0 international boundary from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean pro· vided for the Coast and Geodetic Survey to execute the control froxtl the Lake of the Woods to th~ first-order triangulation near La.lee Superior. This was completed the early part of the fiscal year. f In southeast Alaska the task of measuring bases along the arc o first-order triangulation from Dixon Entrance to the head of L~R Canal was carried on by a party- during all the working months. J\J> bases were completed by the end of the fiscal year except one in L~ Canal. This party also observed the large figure spanning DiJ(OJl

Entrance which connects the Canadian first-order arc from Puget Sound with the United States arc in southeast Alaska. Another party in southeast Alaska began in the spring of 1925 to observe second-order triangulation in Chatham Strait and Frederick Sound, connecting to first-order work in Frederick Sound and to third-order triangulation at the north and south ends of Chatham Strait. In western Alaska a party was engaged during the 11tte summer of 1924 in extending the first-order arc of triangulation from Cook Inlet toward Fairbanks, and at the close of the seuson was almost to the south edge of the Tanana Va1ley. No observing was done in western Aluska during the spring of 1925 because of lack of funds, but a reconnaissance was begun to connect the north end of the triangulation with the international boundary triangulation near Eagle on the Yukon River. Several years ago a reconnaissance was made for first-order triangulation from Needles, Calif., to Salt Lake, Utah, to connect the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation with the Texas-California arc. Observations on this project were begun late in the fiscal year. In western Texas a party during the early winter completed a belt of first-order triangulation connecting the mnety-eighth meridian trian[ulation near San Antonio with the Rio Grande arc near Del Uio. The triangulation and leveling executed in earthquake regions to llleasure movements in the crust of the earth included triangulation across the Imperial V allev in California and in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel. The line of levels from Santa Ana to Barstow, Calif., touching upon bench marks established in 1906, was completed during the early part of the year. A belt of triangulation was begun to connect the International Latitude Observatory at Ukiah, Calif., ~ith the first-order triangulation near Sacramento, but the appropriation for that work was exhausted before the connection WR.s completed. For some years the Coast and Geodetic Survey has i:ecommended t~e use of first-order control, or better, for topographic surveys of cities and has acted in an advisory capacity on a number of city surveys. During the winter of 1924-25 a cooperative arrangement Was entered into with the city officials of Rochester, N. Y., whereby extremely accurate first-order triangulation and traverse would be extended over the urban area, the Coast and Geodetic Survey, furnishing the .instruments and observers and the city of Rochester Pa yin~ all field expenses. Not ouly will the points so determined be av-ailat)le for public use in the files and publications of this survey, hut the workhas afforded our engineers an opportunity to test out Certain appli~nces and methods which were especially adapted to V-ery precise city surveys. At the end of the fiscal year the work had . lllfade very satisfactory progress both in quantity and in accuracy 0 the results obtained. \.h A line of first-order leveling was ei:tended from Perth Amboy, 'ti rough Trenton, Camden, and Atlantic City to Cape May, N. J., 0 nnecting with the tidal stations at Atlantic City and Cold Spring ~l~t. A co?nectio~ was also made with the tidal and city bench · a1 ks at Phtladelphm.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

A reconnaissance for first-order triangulation was extended frorn Fairbanks toward Eagle, Alaska, to connect the arc of triangulation from Cooka Inlet northward with the triangulation along the one hundred and forty-first meridian. An astronomic party working through the southwest determined 12 longitudes during the summer and fall of 1924, as follows: 4 in California, 1 in Arizona, 4 in Texas, 1 in Oklahoma, 1 in Kansas, and 1 in Colorado. · Latitude was also determined at three of these stations and azimuth at two. Nearly all of this work was to provide additional Laplace stations for the contemplated readjustment of the triangulation net from the ninety-eighth meridian westward. Near the end of the fiscal year an astronomic party started work in Nebraska and South Dakota and by June 30 had completed fouf longitude, three latitude, and four azimuth determinations. The wireless method for determining longitude was used with continued success during the year, giving on the average somewhat more accurate results than di<l the wire method previously used. A new determination of the overall lag of the reception of time signals was made during the winter at the Naval Observatory and a verY close agreement with the previous values was obtained.
MAG~ETIC

AND SEISMOLOGICAL WORK

~rhc magnetic work accomplished during the year is as follows: 'The magnetic resurvey of North Carolina, made in cooperatioJJ with the geological and economic survey of that State (now tbe department of conservation and development), was completed during the year. . · A large number of stations were occupied in Texas, especially iJJ the northern part, and observations were made at eight county seats where there had been no previous observations. Repeat stations were occur>ied in the Middle Atlantic and Ne"' England States and in the Northwest States. Two new count) seats were occupied in Montana. Magnetic observations were made during the total solar eclipse at Ithaca, N. Y., January 24, 1925, and special observations wer0 also made at the observatories. Repeat stations were occupied in the Hawaiian Islands. With the cooperation of the Philippine Government, repeat star tions were occupied throughout the islands and new stations were established on the islands north of Luzon. , Magnetic observations were made by the survey vessels in Alas1':b· A party engaged in reconnaissance of the A1eutian Islands _o ' tained some much needed observations at points hitherto unoccupiedt Routine observations of the magnetic elements were continued 6e all magnetic observatories, and in addition special work was doJJ as follows: · ' CHELTENHAM. -Investigation of tem_perature control for the ~ variometer was completed. An investigation of earthquake e!f0 ~ on variometers was started, as were numerous minor investigat1°J1~, A very large number of instruments were standardized during year.

SrTKA.-Investigation of auroras in relation to telephone and telegraph disturbances was undertaken. Changes were made ·in the variation building to reduce the temperature chan~e. . PoRTO Rrco.__.:.on November 1, 1924, observations were stopped, the buildings were sold, and the land reverted to the owner. The equiJJment was stor1;1d in Porto Rico and the instruments were shipped to Washington for complete overhauling. An officer proceeded to Porto Rico in November and investigated a large number of possible sites. It was found that a site belonging to the city of San Juan could be used without expense to anyone, and the offer was accepted. Construction of buildings wu.s in progress at the end of the year. HoxOLULU.-A number of sites were investigated, as the· possibility of necessary removal from the present site has arisen.
SEISMOLOGY

The Bosch-Omori seismographs were kept in operation at Tucson, Sitka, and Cheltenham, and at Porto Rico until the observatory was closed. The usual analyses and reports were made, including the reports of important earthquakes. A number of earthquakes Were recorded on the magnetographs. The investigation of earthquake effects on the magnetograph at Cheltenham is of interest to seismologists. In Honolulu the Milne-Shaw instrument was kept in operation and Was improved in several particulars.

Cooperating with the Engineer Corps of the Army a tide statioll was established at Benning Bridge, D. C., and maintained simultane- · ously with the W a.shington station for three months for the determiniv tion of tide planes. The Bureau of Fisheries cooperated with this bureau by establishin~ and maintaining a portable automatic tide gauge on the Pribilo . Islands, Alaska. In July, 1924, an automatic tide gauge station was installed on th 8 ' wharl of the Scripps Institution for Biological Research, at La Jollll-f Calif. This station will be maintained as a primary tide station ~ this survey and as an ocean station similar to the station at Atlant1° f City. .

Bartlett, to whom instruments were loaned in April, 1924. Captain ·Bartlett spent the summer in Alaska on the Coast Guard steamer Bear, obtaming meteorological and other observations for the National Geogr~hic Society. ' In November, 1924, current apparatus was loaned to Dr. Robert Cushman Murj)hy, American Museum ·of, Natural History, New York. Doctor Murphy made current and density observations in connection with his work last winter off the coast of Peru, and turned over to this bureau the data obtained from these observations. A tide station was established in November, 1924, at Washington, D. C., on the lighthouse wharf. Four different types of autolllatic tide gauges were installed at this station for the purpose of lllaking tests and improvements to automatic tide gauges in use in this service. This bureau is cooperating with the State of New Jersey in the study of apparent tidal fluctuations in a well 800 feet deep in connect10n with an investigation of the water supply of Atlantic City. A. portable automatic tide gauge is installed in tb1s well. In April, 1.925, a tide gauge station was esttlblished at Galveston South Jetty Light to furnish tidal control for the open coast of the Gulf of Mexico. For the preservation of tidal planes in San Francisco Bay, defined by long-period tide observations, tidal bench marks in the vicinity '\Vere connected by rrecise· leveling in March, 1925, and additional bench marks established. - · A primary tide station for tidal control along the South Atlantic ~oast of the United Sto,tes was established at Daytona Beuch, Fla., in April, 1925. A current station has been esto,blished on Savannah Light Vessel, and is being operated in connection with coast-erosicfn studies at the lllouth of the So,vo,nno,h River. A primary tide station was established in May, 1925, at Seward, AlasKa. This is intended as a long-period station for the tidal control of that general region and to furnish a long-period mean sea level datum for precise leveling. . . The secondary tide station on the Duwamish River ut Seattle was ~1scontinued on April 30. This station was established a year ago 1ll order to obtain data on tidal conditions in this river. Temperature and density observations, frequently requested of this office by prospecti've builders in connection with cold-storage lllants, by fishing concerns, and especially by investigators in the study of pile-boring limnoria, are being made at the following stations:
tortland, Me. oston, Mass. a.ntucket Shoal Light Vessel. Phtlantic City, N. J. B iladelphia, Pa. '!oltimore, Md. ghamond Shoal Light Vessel. , C arleston, S. C. .,., edar Keys Fla. 4 ensacola, Fla.

In addition, short series of temperature and density observations Were made at 61 stations during tile current and tide survey of Dela~are Bay. All these observations are obtained at no increased cost o the survey.

-CHAPTER II
BRIEF SUMMARY OF HYDROGRAPHIC, GEODETIC, .MAGNETIC, AND TIDE AND CURRENT SURVEYS

The tinted areas on the accompanying chart, C~ndition of Field Operations, United States, indicate where additional surveys are needed on coasts of this country. The Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico . coasts require similar treatment, namely, detailed surveys to the 100-fathom depth, and also wire-drag surveys in several rocky or coral regions. The Pacific is less changeable and requires but one compreliensive survey, carried to the 1,000-fathom depth, which is . comparatively close to the shore. Rapid progress has been made in southeast Alaska, as shown by the accomJ>anying chart. Hydrogra:phic work in Porto Rico and in "the Virgin Islands is nearing complet10n. The most important shores of the Hawaiian Islands have been su~eyed, though some work remains. The islets and shoals westward of Midway should be surveyed. A program for completion of Philippine Island surveys has been drawn up and will expedite that work, which is; however, already in good eondition . . Two cooperative projects with the Geodetic Survey of Canada are almost completed. The first is the international boundary triangulation from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and the second is the connecting of first-Qrder triangulation in the State of Washington with that in British Columbia and Alaska. First-order work was executed in Alaska and on the Nevada-Utah and South Dakota-Montana projects. Some astronomic work was done with the aid of the United States Naval Observatory. The Geological Survey cooperated in the extension of control for the topographic map of the country. The Forest Service rendered important aid to the bureau. Re_. observation from Mount Lola-Round Top on the transcontinental arc, westward to the coast, and thence southward to San Diego, was completed. This is an important contribution to seismological investigation, as was also the running of levels from Santa Ana to Barstow, Calif. · There are now magnetic stations at almo,st all county ·seats. Reoccupation of stations will cover the entire country every five years. In tfie replacement of old stations the bureau is .receiving aid froill local surveyors. Spme magnetic observations have been made by survey vessels in Alaska, but work in the interior is needed. No repeat work will be needed in Hawaiian and Philippine Islan~s for some time nor in Porto Rico. Complete records of magnet10 elements have continued throughout the year and will continue a.~ . the five observatories, except for an interval at Porto Rico while tb.e new observatory is being constructed. Magnetic observations bY the nonmagnetic vessel Carnegie have been utilized b[ the burea.U· Collection of data concerning felt and visible effects o earthquakes has become an important part of the work.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEOV~TIC Sl:RVEY

67

Increased appropriations have permitted the bureau to mnke necessary tide and current surveys in important harbors. A number of others require surveys, but for this year such work will he confined to the narrow passages from Dixon Entrance to Cross Sound, Alaska, "_'here strong currents menace our shipping. For the preservation of tidal planes the bureau has relevelea old bench marks and has established standard disks, the majority of this work being done between Chesapeake Bay and Connecticut and in t.he vicinity of San Francisco Bay. , Lack of funds has kept the bureau from making important investigations in physical oceanogrttphy to obtnin densities and temperntures of sea water, ocean cur!'ents, 1rnd related matters. Sueh work should be done in the Gulf Stream. The tide station in the Duwamish River was discontinued. New. stations were installeq at Cape May, Washington, Daytona, Galveston, La Jolla, Astoria, and Seward. Stations at Sitka, Anchornget Portland, and San Diego will be discontinued this year and those at Galv(>ston and Valdez in 1926.

CHAPTER III
PROGRAM FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IN THE FIELD

IIYDROGRAPIDC AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK ATLANTIC AND GuLF CoAsTs.-The steamships Bache and Lydonia will be employed on offshore work, as follows: Bache off Cape Henry, searching for reported shoals and extending southward an offshore survey from the southern limit of the recent survey. Next fall the Bache will take up similar work on the Gulf coast eastward froJll Pensacola Bay. The Lydonia will endeavor to complete the offshore work between Cape Fear and Winyah Bay. When weather becomes unfavomhle for work in this locality the vessel will take up similar work southward from Daytona. Both parties will also execute inshore hydrography and shore-line revision m these vicinities. The launch Milcawe will comflete the insho1:e hydrography a~dl shore-line revision between Bui and Winyah Bays nnd t11en wil cooperate with the party on the Lydonia in extending similar work northward of Winyah Bay. The steamship Hydrograplter will be employed on the resurvey of Tampa Bay, approach and tributaries, begun during the fiscal ycnr The steamship Ranger will continue sounding and wire dra~ging around the Virgin Islands until all of this work has heen compwted and will then take up work on the Atlantic or Gulf coasts. V\rire-drag surveys will be resumed in northern New England waters and along the Florida Keys if funds are available. Several small harbor resurveys will be accomplished if possible. PACIFIC CoAST AND ALASKA.-The steamship Guide will be cJl'l· ployed in the vicinity of Cape Blanco during the year, except during the ·winter, when the vessel will be operated on the coast of southern California. The steamship Pioneer, upon completing the presef:lt season's work, will take up surveys along the southern Californ1fl, coast, continuing until srring, when work on the Oregon coast froJll Coos Bay northward wil be undertaken. The steamship Discover~r, at the close of the present season in western Alaska, will repair 1n San Francisco, and during the remainder of the winter will be ~v1 · plo!'ed on surveys in the Hawaiian Islands. Early in the spr1llg opero.tions will be taken up along the Washington coast from Cfl,pe Flattery southward. The steamship Survevor will continue on tbe coast of southeastern Alaska until it has been surveyed out to ha depth of 1,000 fathoms and ns far northward ns Icy Point. T .~ Explorer will continue work in the southern part of Ch11tham Strfl,l and in the bays and arms on each side of that strait. Broken bott 0~ areas will also be dragged. The motor ship Natoma will su~ 0 .J Kaigani Strait, two harbors on Tlevak Strait, and will then take inshore work on the west coast of Kruzof Island. At least one vesse will be engaged during the winter in resurveys of Puget Sound . . HAWAIIAN IsLANDS.-As stated, the steamship Discoverer will wo~Ylt in Hawaiian waters during the winter. In addition to this par

~shore party will continue detailed inshore hydrography around the island of Oahu. PIDLIPPINE lsLANDs.-The steamship Pathfinder will work north of Luzon until next fall and then in the southern part of the Sti.lu Sea. The steamships Fathomer and Mal'indugue will work in the southern part of the Siilu Archipolago. One of these vessels will also make a <iurrent survey of San Bernardino Strait. These operations are in <ionformity w1tl1 a- program for the completion of tlie survey of the entire archipelngo, which was drawn up this year after an inspection of the islnnds nnd n study of the wor.K already accomplished.
GEODETIC WORK

TmANOULATION.-The ~ren.ter part of the geodetic work planned for the fiscal year 1926 lics m the western portion of the United States. It consists· in completing the initial development of first-order trianO'ulation west of the ninety-eighth merulian. During the first haft of the fiscal year four parties will be engaged in northern Idaho and in Wnshington, along the forty-ninth parallel and in regions south of the boundary. Another party will complete the belt of triangulation begun last year, which will extend from the ninetyeighth meridian near Sioux Falls, S. Dak., westward to the Black Hills, and thence northwestward to the vicinity of Bozeman, Mont., connecting with the triangulation of both the one hundred and !ourth and the one hundred and eleventh meridians. Another party ls, extending triangulation from the vicinity of Needles, Calif., to Great Salt Lake, connecting at each end with first-order triangulation arcs already in existence. In order to complete the initial scheme in the western portion of the United States, it was necessary to discontinue triangulation in Alaska begun three years ago and also to omit all first order traverse. Indications are that little triangulation will be executed during the second half of the fiscal Year 1926 because the funds available will be more urgently needed on tmverse and leveling. TnAVERSE.-As already stated no traverse will be executed during t~e first half of 1926. It ls probable, however, that one or two parties Will be started in either Minnesot1i or Wisconsin in the spring of the calendar year 1926. PnECISE LEVELINO.-Only three leveling parties will be operating. d Suring the latter pnrt of the field season of 1925. One will work in outh Dakota, running westward from Sioux Falls over the line of ~st order traverse executed in 1924, and extending toward the Black .Qllls where a connection will be made with an existing line of levels. AL second party will be operating in eastern Californiat first between aws and Mojave, and later for a short period in t11e vicinity of Los Angeles. The party will then be transferred to western Arizona ~here a line will be run across country from Yucca by way of Swansea, ?Use, Salome, and Hassayampa to Gila Bend where it will connect '\v~th a lino of levels run by the Geologicnl Survey. The third party "1111 operate in Colorado from Colorado .Springs by way of Pueblo and Salida to Leadville. The party is operating in cooperation with the Geological Survey, which bureau is furnishing the funds for llarty expenses. In the spring of 1926 there will probably be two parties in '\Vest central Texas, and if funds permit perhaps another party in

10

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY

California, both of which w111 be working on projects requested bf the Geological Survey. ASTRONOMIC WoRK.-One astronomic party will observe for longitude and latitude and occasionally for azimuth at triangulation· stations in several western States,' beginning in South Dakota and ending in Washington. It is not likely that any astronomic work will be done in the spring of 1926. No gravity observations are contemplated, although some experimental work· may be done in connection with the testing of new apparatus. RECONNAISSANCE.-A single reconnaissance party will operateduring the summer of 1925 m central Alaska selecting stations fo1· triangulation, from Fairbanks eastward along the Tanana and Goodpaster Rivers to a connection with the -international boundary triangulation in the vicinity of Eagle. MAGNETIC AND SEIS)fOLOGICAL WORK PROPOSED FIELD Womc-Repeatstations will be occupied throughout the northwestern States, in northern New England, and in themiddle Wes tern States. It is hoped to place a party in the interior o( Alaska to carry on needed repeat work and extension of thB' survey. Additional magnetic re;mlts are expected in the Aleutian Islands. The observatories will continue their usual routine work· Special investigations will be made at Cheltenham. The Porto Rico Observatory will be completed and placed in operation. The improvement of instrumental details at the observatories will be continued. TIDE AND CURRENT WOUK During the months of July, August, a:n<l September, 1925, it is proposed to make current observations in the narrow pasises '?( southeastern Alaska from Dixon Entrance to Cross Sound. This work can not be considered comprehensive and final as in the casdeof the imrveys in New York Harbor, San Francisco Harbor, an Delaware Bay. The territory to be covered is too considerable for the funds available for current and tide work. Primary tide stations representative of tide conditions along. .different stretches of the coast will be maintained for the full yc'ai· at the following places:
Boston. Atlantic City. Cape May. Philadelphia. Baltimore. Washington. Charleston, Daytona. Kev West. Cedar Key. Pensacola. Galveston Jetty Light. Los Angeles. La Jolla. San Francisco. Astoria. Seattle. Olympia. Honolulu. Ketchikan. Seward. Valdez.

These stations are for the purpose of determining the tidal planes of mean sea level for the control of precise level nets and also for thB' control of hydrographic work along the consts of the United StateS·

Density and temperature observations will be continued at a numberof these stations.·. : · · ·· · . ,· · ';· c A preeise:.level party will visit the locations of discontinued tldat ~tations along a section of the Atlantic coast for the purpose of leveling to old nonregulation bench marks us they may be recovered~ Sufficient standard disk bench marks will be installed to comply with the present policy of the bureau of maintaining five standard marks a.t all stations having a year of observations and one for each additional year of observations with a maximum of 10 standard marks. 1:'his work is necessary in order to perpetuat~ long series of observat10ns now protected by only a few nonregulat10n bench marks, many ~f which have been destroyed and others in danger of being lost. It ls intended to extend this work over a long period and to bring it up· to.da.te gradu11:lly by doing only as much work each year as the appropriation permits. During the year the bureau will recover, if possible, old tidal bench marks protecting tidal planes obtained from a long series of observations made many years ago at Port Townsend, Wash. Sufficient new standard bench marks will be established to bring thenumber up to standard requirements. Current observations will be continued on the Atlantic coast at Diamond Shoals and Savannah Light Vessels and on the Pacific .coast at Blunts Reef Light Vessel. Instead of hourly observations throughout the entire day observations will be made only at 8 a. m.~ lloon, 4 and 8 p. m.
