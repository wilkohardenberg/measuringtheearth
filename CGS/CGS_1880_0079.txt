REPORT.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY 0FFWE,

Ww1hington, D. 0., December

16~

1880.

Sm: I have the honor to trausmit herewith a detailed report showing the progress made i11 the work of the United States Coast and Geodetic Surve.v <luring the year ending .June 30, 1880. The system pursued during the year in carrying forward the operations of the Survey has been, as heretofore, designed to secure uniform development in the different classes of work. With limited appropriations the progress in each branch can be made to correspond, but, as before stated, the cost; of indfridnal results is increased by limitation in means. The drawing and engraving of charts must be kept eyen with the progress of work iu the field and afloat, else in many cases results would become obsolete b;r changes in shore lines, depths, antl channel courses. In order to furnish points for the topograph:r and bydrograph:r, the triangulation must be duly advanced, and the requisite computations must be made in the office before triangulation points can be available for such uses. The same is trtw of other hranches of the service. Moreover. the scope of the Survey has been enlarged b;v the necessit;v for geodetic work in the interior. Geoiogi.cal surveys in progress in most of the Statf'!il now demaud precise determinations of position for t.he correction of State maps, and this requirement has been met as far as appropriations would allow. In submitting estimates for the ensuing fiscal ~·ear the attention of the department was called to theRe facts, and suggestions were repeated for prosecuting the work on the basis most conducive to economy. Soundings in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea have flernlopetl uew and interesting facts in regard to the physical formation of the basins of those waters and the flow of the Gulf Stream. That work will be noticed under the head of Section YI in the body of this report. Near the close of the fiscal year a part.y was sent to the coast of Alaska to make surveys aud examinations of the shore8 of that 'l'e.rritory, and in particular to gain information in regard to the variation of the compass. This party bas instructions to extend its work along the coast to Point Barrow, in the Arctic Ocean, the most northern point of land of the American continent. It is confidently expected that the results will greatly improve the charts and sailing directions now depended on for navigating the waters itdjacent to that Territory. The constantly growing importance t-0 the country, of the triangulation of the States, the measurement of the arc of' the parallel of thirty-nine degrees between the Atlantic and the Pacilic coasts, and early arrangements for measuring an arc on the meridian of uinety-nine degrees west of Greenwich (the longest available meridian arc on the American continent), require increased facilities to meet the urgent needs of our wondrously developing territory. In the several States geological and other sttrvt'ys are now i11 progress in accordance with their increasing industries, all demanding accurate maps that ea11 be obtained only by triangulation couducted under one sy11tem. The whole, when completed, will form true bases for maps of the se,·eral States as well as for the whole country. For want of appropriations sufficient to keep pace in geodetic work, these geological surveys and other development8 in the States are much in advance of the triangulation, and this relation between public work and Joe.al requirements is greatly t-0 the disadvantage of the States. From State authorities aJlplications are frequent to advance the triangulation more rapidly in order to meet urgent wants, but the appropriations have been insufficient to meet such requisitions. In Great Brita.in and Ireland, with an aggregate area less than one-half the State of Texas, there a.re now employed on the topography alone twenty-two hundred persons, and in Hindosta.n S.Ex.12-1

(Iudia), containing but one-half the area of this country, there are at present employed fifty-seven bnmlred versons on triangulation aml topography alone; but the largest number eYer employed at an;v one time on the triangulation and topography of the Coast and Geodetic 8urYe~- lias been le8s than four hnntlred. It i8 therefore apparent, that the amounts appropriated are inadequate for prosecuting in this country the class of work deemed requisite by enlightened Jleople of other nations. The measurement of the largest possible meridian arc on the North .A.merican continent is imperatfrel~- demanded, not only hy the science of the day, but by ernry material interest of the States thro11gl1 wliich it will pass. This meridian is the ninety-ninth west from Greenwich, and, fortunately for the purpose, passes tlirough the States of Texas, Kansas, Nebraska, Indian Territory, and the Territory of Dakota, including twenty-three degrees of latitude =thirteen hundred and eights geographical and nearly sixteen hundred statute miles, and so lies that it can be extended through the British possessions on the north and J[exico on the south, with a 1iossible length of m'er 500 = tl1ree tl1011sa11d geographical or nearly thirt.y-five hundred statute miles. Striking, as this meridian arc does, through the middle of the am of the thirty-nintb para1lel, the two will form the grandest work of the kind that can be attempted by any single government, and will be the most Yaluable contribution yet made to our knowledge of the form of the earth. I dwell on this snllject with urgency on account. of its importane!e, and because the length of time 11ccessary for the completion of tbe work under the most favorable auspices. Hence, it shonhl be continued with steady energy and sufficient means. The inYestigatiou of the "Gulf Stream" and the laws controlling its action progresses slowly for want of fouds. But this problem invol\·es resear<;hes in regard fo the circulation of nearly the whole :North Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, for its due solution. Only one small steamer can, with our present appropriation, be employed on this work, and for but one-half the ;year. Thus, it is evident that progress must be slow in the collection of facts of every character relating to the physical condition of so vast an area. The facts obtained during the past three years tend greatly to modify the views formerly entertaiued in regard to the Gulf Stream, notably in reference to the quantity of water passing iuto the Uaribbeau hetween Cuba and San Domingo, and the development of the plateau off CharlPston over which the stream runs. No conclusions even of a general nature can be arrived at until all the waters of the Gulf Stream are tract'd from their sources throughout their circulation, and the whole of the sea bottom over which the stream ftows can be de\·eloped. To accornJllish these result<.:: within any reasonable time. would require the use of not less than three steamPrs to be employed during at least nine u.onths in each year. For a due adrnnce in this important problem, 1irobably the most important to the commercial world of all ocean problems, nothing less can be asked. To illustrate the importance of t11e deep-sea soundings with reference to this investigation, it may be stated that during t.he past year, in a portion of the Gulf Stream flowing through the Caribbean Sea, where a depth of not more than one thousand fathoms was expected, an a<!tual depth of thirty-four hundred and fifty fathoms or nearly twenty-one thousand feet was found, and n.Jong our southern Atlantic coast, in a locality where a depth of not less than one thonsaml fathoms was expected, a depth of but two hundred and seventy fathoms was found. The necessity for the rapid prosecution of this important work is most urgent at present on account of the benefits that may be expected to accrue to commerce, not only along our own coasts, but between this country and Europe. Part III of Mr. William Ferrel's Meteorological Researches for the Coast Pilot has been in progress during the year. This will contain a thorough iuvestigation of the bypsometrical formula, t1specially with reference to the effect of temperature and barometric gradients; and also the dism1ssion of various observations obtained for verif_ying the principal constant of the formula. A set of tables in English measure will be given, based upon the most recent and convenient formula, and with constants derived from Regnault's determinations of the densities of mercury and air, and the constant of expansibility of air by beat. Mr. Ferrel has made a full discussion of the six years' observations of tides at Pulpit Cove, coast of Maine, by the harmonic analysis, and also

MISSISSIPPI RIVER SURVEY.

For the uses of the Mississippi Rfrer Commission, the survey of that river was of nece8sity To that end· small sight, and in general triangles were laid ont so as to avoid expense and delay in cutting lines the bends of the river were followed with triangle sides forming 11arts of quadrilaterals. At the same time advantage was taken of openings or clearings back of the levees. Shortening the sides to a range of between one and three miles made it requisite to measure base lines at short intervals iu the triangulation. 1t will be noticed under the head of Section VIII in this report that five lines were measured in the course of the sea.son, and these corresponding in length with the average of the triangle sides, their lengths are assured with an accuracy ordinarily varying betwt.en ~- 1fv 1, and Tofroo of the distances between the stations. To keep in perfect check the direction of the triangulation, astronomical azimuths were measured in connection with each of the base lines; and at well-distributed stations along the courRe of the Mississippi provision was made, in advance, for determining astronomical latitudes awl telegraphic longitudes. In the calculations, if the records of a station show angles of repetition, whatever may be the conditions between resulting angles1 the conditions are satisfied in the Computing Division by simple adjustment. But if the record contains directU>ns, they are treaf;ed in the ordinary way, quadrilaterals or other figures being adjusted by the methotl of least squares, figure after figure. This involrns generally four equations for any one case. Next the triangle sides are computed, starting from one of the measured base lines. On reaching the next base of course a small discrepancy appears between the computed and measured length. So also when computation of the latitu<les, longitudes, and azimuths is carried over the triangulation, a small difference is found between the computed a:nd observed azimuth as each base line is reached. The computer then selects from the quadrilaterals and other figures treated, the triangles that are best conditioned in regard to shape, between the two base lines; establishes two conditional equations, and by one of these he brings into accord the lengths of the base lines; by the other the two astronomical azimuths. Experience has shown that two equations of this kind should go together, else the adjustment may bring into accord base-lengths at the expense of the direction of the triangulatfo11. At the same time the conditions of the sums of the angles of each triangle are kept, so that the number of equations )Ilay rise to forty, fifty, or more, but their solution presents no particular difficulty. The triangles and positions being recomputed, the base lines and azimuths as well as the angleto> of the principal triangles will be found in accord, and the latter will satisfy their theoretical values. The sccondar.v and subordinate points of the tria,ngulation are next computed upon tbti basis of the preceding adjusted values. This process supposes differences of local deflections of the plumb line in azimuth to be small in comparison with errors in observation, or else the triangulation is made to conform to the astronomical azimuth. Should the umnller of co111Utions between any two b~ lines become inconveniently great, the computations may be started from both base lines and join about midway between them, adopting in that case a mean length and mean azimuth for the junction line, and finally making two adjustments, one from each base to the junction. The geodetic latitudes and longitudes are those adopted for the triangulation between Mobile and New Orleans. When the work on the Mississippi is completed it will have the support of an a.stronomical latitudes and all telegraphic longitudes measured in that region. Though the dis·

ASTRO:zrn:mCAL VISION.

Prof. S. P. Langley, director of the Allegheny Obserrntory, near Pittsburgh, Pa., having occa1>ion to visit Europe in December, 1878, made at my request on Mount Etna (Sicily) some observations relative to astronomical vision, for comparison with others taken within the Territories of the United States. The telescope used was furnished from the United States Na>al Observat,ory by the Superintendent, Admiral Jolm Rodgers, U. S. N., and in addition the instru· mental outfit included only a spectroscope from tl1e Allegheny Obser,·ator~·, provided with a Rutherford speculum metal gTati11g of seventeen thousand two humlred and ninety.six lines to the iuch, and with collimating and olmerving telescopes of 1.1 inch aperture. Although bandit ti do not infost the region around Mount Etna as they do the we1.>tcrn end of Sicily, it was deemed advisable by the American minister at l{ome, Hon. George J>. l\farslt, that the obserYer should be provided with an escort. On his application to the prefect of Catania, a native guide and two soldiers were assigned to accompan.Y Professor Langley. · The observing station has an elevation of about forty-two hundred feet, the lmt occupied being on the southeastern side of the mountain. The telescope used has a full aperture of three and a quarter inches, but in experimenting the aperture was reduced, a11d the following is an abstract of the results, taken from the report of Professor J,angleJ·. Respecting Polaris he thus records: Polaris.-The companion (position preYiom;ly unknown) recognized with 1.6 inch aperture. Rigcl.-Tbe companion steadily seen with 1.6 inch aperture; not seen witl! 1.4 inch. fi LepM'is.-Companion (mag11itud0 11) seen with full aperture. Aldebaran.-Companion (magnitude 11.:!) an eas:; object with full aperture. H Orioni11.-Fifth star in Trapezium seen when nebula was about 400 high. l~ull aperture. i Orionis.-Third star (magnitude 11) seen with full aperture, in moonlight. Star pr. u Orionis.-Magnitnde 11, seen with fnll aperture. ''The observations for stars included mauy others, but this short list is selected as fairly typical, with the remark that while obse1Ting the wind was an almost constant obstacle to steady vision. Considering the distinctness with which stars of the 11th and 11.2 magnitude were observed under unfavorable circumstances, a.ml in moouliµht, we shall probably be justified in stating the limit for an aperture emplo~·ed ancl an ordinary eye at this altitude on Etna, t-0 lie near the 11.5 magni· tude of the Bedford Catalogue, or the 10.2 magnitude of Struve.'' At any station in America Professor Langley has been able to see only six stars in Pleiades, but, even while the moon was shining, he rendily recognized nine, from the station at Casa del Bosco, on Etna. His report of observations at that station is quite full in detail. Atter noting that under an apparently clear sky the definition was less clear than that in previous observatious, J1e thus concludes: "Upon the whole, though the ideal station where atmos1iheric tremor does uot exist, and the astronomer pursues his observations in au even, transparent 1.>ky, is not to be found on any part of the earth's surface yet examined, we find within our own territory, in the dry and elcnitcd tablelands of Colorado and New Mexico or CaUornia, every condition which experience points out as favorable, united in a degree which 110 part of the earth, so far as we cau jndgt~, surpasses."

T1pograpliy of Frenchman's Bay, Mf'.-In pre\~ious seasons the plane-table snn·ey of the 11bores of Frenchman's Bay was W("ll adYance<l in the direction of the headwaters. For the extension of the work, Assistant H. G. Ogden took the field, and resumed opemtions on the 22d of July, 1879. Between that date and the close of October the detailed 1:mrrny was advanced from Ash Point, in Flanders Ba.r, northward and westward into Franklin Bay, a few miles above the Narrows. Waukeag Neek appears on the 11hme-table sheet and the surface details of the northwest part of Frenclnnan's Bay, corresponding to the limit reached b~' tbe party in mapping the east shore of Franklin Bay. :Further westward Mr. Ogden filled in details requisite for completing the topographical survey of Skilling's River.

The rock was found au<l its vieiuity de,'elopecl by soundings. On the '.liitlt of July all the partienlars in regard to it were published from the office as a Notice to 1\Iariuers. Soundings were commenced in the approaches to Blue Hill I~a~' on the 7th of July. As heretofore, all means were taken for procuring information in regard to sunken ledges. The lines were run with great care, and close examination was made if tlie depth or character of tlie bottom changed. In the difficult and tedious ltydrograph,y of Blue Hill Bay the party was engaged until the 19th of September. That site of work is open to the sea and has many sunken ledges with deep water around them. For the hydrography of Frenchman\; Bay, Assistant Ogden fnrnisl1ed a tracing from the planetable sheet. The space sounded was between Crabtree Xeck and Starn Island. East of Waukeag Neck, Flanders Bay was sounded. In this quarter the hydrography was completed on the 18th of October, 1879. Tlte steamer then proceeded to Portsmouth, X. II., and in that Yicinity Moore's Ledge was deYeloped.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE:.NT OF THE

Hydrography of the middle part of Blue Hill Bay, jJfr.-Tbe bydrograpbic party of Lieut. Uriel Sebree, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, reached Blue Hill Bay in the schooner Silliman on tlte li:ith of July, 1879, and Ilrosecuted soundings until the close of September. Two projections were filled comprising the waters of the main body of the bay, in. which lines of soundings were run about an eighth of a mile apart, crossed by others about the same distance asunder. Where shoals or ledges were found or suspected additional lines were run for developing the cbamcter of the bottom. Two tidal stations were occupied while soundings were in progress, and as usual the results of the gauges were checked by simultaneous obsen·ations. By a short series of observations the current in the hay at maximum was found to he a little more than one knot. Lieutenant Sebree was assisted in this section by Ensigns J. W. Stewart and J.C. Colwell, U. 8. N., and in the fatter part of the working season by Lieut. Perry Garst, U. S. N. The lastnamed officer has since been assigned to conduct a hydrographic party in the waters of Puget Sound in Section XI. To the report of Lieuteua11t Sebree was appended a list of the dangers to navigation in the waters in which his work was prosecuted, together with mention of suitable anchorages and sailing directions. The work done is represented by the following statistics:

]\files run in sounding ..................................................· 387 Angles measured .. _.......................·....·.....·........··........ 4,511 Number of soundings ................................................·... 16,648 The tides were recorded by upwards of four thousand obserrntiorn;;. Thirty.eight signals were erected for hydrographic purposes, and forty-nine positions were occupied on shore for adjusting the soundings. Hydrograpliy east and west of Jllount Desert Isl.and, coast of Jlfaine.- 'Vith tour projections, Lieut. Commander C. M. Chester, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, reached Southwest Ilarbor at the end of l\fay, 187!!, with his party in the steamer A. D. Bache. The hydrography of the Yicinity of ]\fount Desert Island was immediately resumed and steadily prosecuted until the mid(lle of October, anrl soon after the four sheets were returned to the office with data sufficient to fill them with soundings. In the southeastern approach to Mount Desert Island the work done joins outside witb two hydrographic sheets wh.ich were completed by other 1iarties in previous rears. The seciond bydrogmpltic sheet of Lieutenant.Commander Chester represents soundings made in the development of what is known as Goose Cove, an indentation of the main coast north of Bartlett's Island. The third sheet represents the hydrography of Union River Bay to the northward and westward of Mount Desert, and the fourth continuea the hydrography of the same quarter to the westward of Long Island. In the course of the season the party in the steamer erected one hundred and sixty.five signals, and occupied a hundred and seventy-one stations on shore for verifying the courses of the lines of soundings. Forty.five specimens of bottom were procured and carefully marked with notes of the localities from which they were taken. Lieutenant-Commander Chester was ably assisted by Master T. G. O. Salter, U.S. N., and by Ensigns Henry .Morrell, H. F. Reich, and Charles H . .Amsden, U. S. N. The aggregate statistics of the four hydrographic sheets are: Miles run in sounding ............................................ , . . . . . . 966 Angles measured. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · 13, 206 Number of soundings .................................................. 43, 000 As usual, the tides were recorded in each of the localities while soundings were in progress.

of the obseryer the record of observations has been sent in nearly perfect. The self-registering guage is of the best construction, and is provided with means for heating to protect the action of the apparatus from ice in winter.

Quimhy took the field in the middle of .July, 187f!: for continuing the work of triangulation in the northern part of New Hampshire. Mount l\loriah, in Coos County, was first occupied. Thl-lt summit was reached after trM·ersing a course of seven miles through a heavy growth of timber. Observations were made both for horizontal and yertical angles upon eight outlying stations, two of which are in the State of l\Iaiue. On account of the wild nature of the <~onntry only a limited number of tertiary or subsidiary points e,ould he observed on, but the directions of many summits were recorded approximately. The erection of definite signals in that r(!gion would have entailed much labor and expense. As many of the summits were unknown to Professor Quimby, an eye sketch was taken and marked with numuens, to give means for identif~·ing the mountains in future for mapping that region. Obser<;ations at Mount Moriah wPre completed on the l:!th of September. After removing the camp and instruments from the summit of the mountain, a reconnaissance was made at the expense of the StatB . for the remainder of Northern New Hampshire. The geodetic observations are represented by tlrn following statistics in the field report: Horizontal angles measured . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . · 104 V ertieal angles ........ _...... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Number of obserrntiom; .... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _ 3, 604 Mr. Walter Aiken, resident at Franklin Falls, N. H., aud chiefly int~rested in the tenure of the summit of l\Iount ·washington, while projecting the erection of a tower for g·eneral obsernttions by tourists, obligingly arranged for its construction over the point used by obsen·ers of thl' survey in geodetic measurements. The foundation was so made that instruments may be isolated from the main tower. l<'or this great advantage, the additional outla,\" for which was considerable, Mr. Aiken genel'Ously declined any remuneration. Geodetic operations.-For continuing the triangulation in Yermont, Prof. V. G. Barbour took the field on the 1st of July, 1879, and after consultation with Assistant Richard D. Uutts erected signals at several points 'isible from the 1nimar,v statiour-; which haYe already been occupied. In August the reconnai8sance was continued in the "'l"icinit,v of Brandon, and subsequently uear Goshen and Bethel, in which places additional points were selected so as to be in view from adjacent stations of the primary work. For the triangulation north of Killington, Professor Barbour set up signals on hills at Landon, Goshen, Rochester, and Colton. Proceeding northward other points were examined, and when suitable for geodetic connection sigqals were set up for perfecting the scheme of triangulation. All the points selected are carefully <lescribed in the report on field work. While Assistant Cutts was at Killington and engaged in tlte measurement of horizontal angles, Professor Barbour ,·isited that station and employed ten days in practice with the theodolite, observing, as weather permitted, between the 9th and 18th of September, 1879. The remainder of the season was passed in opening lines when requisite to remler the stations iutervisible. Fourteen in all were selectecl and described in the record. Pri11uiry f)·iangulation.-In the scheme of geodetic operations for connecting the survey of Lake Champlain with the in·imary triangulation of the coast of New England, Killington Peak, near Rutland, Vt., was indicated, and at the opening of the fiscal year that station was occupied by Assistant Hichard D. Cutts. It connects directl,r with several primary points of the Coast and Geodetic Sm·vey, and with numerous positions which will be used by Prof. V. G. Barbour for triangulation on account of the geological survey of Vermont. Assistant Cutts left W ashingtoii late in June, 1879, and in the course of a few days traced out a sled road for transporting instruments and equipage to the summit of Killington. At the same time he suggested the desirability for public usea of a wagon road to enable citizens and sojourners at Rutland to enjoy the magnificent view from Killington Peak. The citizens responded promptly, subscribed a sum sufficient for the work, and, although hands were scarce and the ground very rough, the road to the summit was practieable for wheeled vehicles on the 14th of July. Meanwhile, Mr. 0. H. Sinclair, aid in the party, had aqjusted the signal on Mount Equinox to

the southward aud westward of Killington, and stationed heliotropers at l'rospect ~fountain and Blueberry Hill to the northward and westward. Northeast of Killington the summit of Mount W.ashington was seen on favorable days at a distance of about eig'lity·eight, miles. The plan of work, as laid out in advance, was to connect with and verify the New Hampshire triangulation; t-0 commence observations for the Vermont seriei;;, assisted by Professor Barbour, and to take measures for connecting Lake Champlain with the main triangulation. In pursuance of the general scheme, heliotropers were stationed at Mount Mansfield, Mount Washington, and Gunstock Mountain. When arrangements were complete for the measurement of horizontal angles at Killington, the triangles meeting there as a septagon coyere!l an area of ten tbousand six hundred square miles. The reconnaissance of the southern part of Vermont by Professor Barbour resulted in tl1e selection of many points in sight of Killingtou, arnl hence iL was 1lesirahle that the signals at all such 11tations should be promptly erected so as to be obsened on by Assistant Cutts. This was done to amid the necessity of reoccupying that station (forty.two hundred and thirty.nine feet high) in the field operations of Professor Barbour. After placing the signals he joined :Mr. Cutts and assisted in the observations at Killington for the practice needflll with field instruments. As triangulation adrnnced in the State of New Hampshire, Professor Quimby selected and observed upon stations in the Green :Mountains, and these are included in the scheme laid out by Assistant Cutts. Intermediate points in Vermont, selected by the observer in New Hampshire, will be embra1~ed in the series of triangles laid out by Professor Barbour. At Killington observations with the theodolite were commenced ou the 24th of July, and wez·e completed on the 27th of September. The journal shows that on twenty-four mornings and eighteen afternoons no observations could be recorded. Amongst other obstacles t-0 progress the field report mentions the fog or low clouds present at the high summit generally in the morning. Assistant Outts remarks: "They frequently bang on during the day, while fifteen hundred or two thousand feet below the summit it is all sunshine.'~ An unusual number of stations were observed on from Killington Peak. Of these, eleven were primar~· points at distances varying between fifty and seventy miles, the longest line (88.54 miles) being that to Mount Wa8hington. Elernn signals of the Vermont series were also observed on, and seven bnbsidiary directions were measured on objects in Rutland and in the Adirondacks.

In the latter part of December he dsited and carefully examined a number of elevations in Vermont and ~ew York, and carefully reported on the M·ailability of the positions for purposes of triangulation. · J<~arly in June of the present year (1880) Assistant Cutts again took tl1e field and occupied a primary station to the northward of Killingt-011. At the clmie of the fiscal year the prospects were good for success in his field operations. The station referred to is upwards of four thousand feet high. Magnetw observations.-The plan of operations for the year included a careful study in regard 'to points at which magnetic observations wouJd most effectively supplement our previous knowledge respecting the variation of the compass, and magnetic dip and intensity along the coast of New England and the Middle States. In accordance with that view all positions occupied in recent years have been selected in advance. Fourteen additional points were designated in the prospective operations of the season, and as heretofore Suba.ssistant J. B. Baylor was assigned to make the observations. Before taking the field the instrument.s were tested at the station on Capitol HilJ. The stations were occupied in the order in which they were reached in going northward and eastward, but for the sake of convenience the usual geographical ord!:r will be observed in men-

Honing tlie work. In geneml eacb station was occupied on two consecutfre da~·s. Two sets ot observations for azimuth were recorded at the same place, one set in the morning and one in the :tfternoon. For the dip of the magnetic needle two sets of observations were mad<· each day, and for the declination one set was recorded daily. Detlectiom; and oscillations were obsen·ed by one series of obsermtions daily at each of tlw st~tious. · .Mr. Baylor took_ the field early iu JnlJ·· Iu this 8ectiou he deterrniue<l tL1~ mag11Ptic <ledi11ation, dip, and intensity in August at Eastport a111l Bangor, Me.; at Portsmouth, :X.

Prncecdiug beyond the f10rtheastern boundary in Sept~m ber, .Mr. Baylor occupied a station at Halifax in :N"o\·a Scotia, and in the same month determined the magnetie elements at Quebec and .Montreal in Canada. Other points occupied in the course of the season will he mentioned under the lie.ad of Section II in this report. By the courtesy of the G11itt>1l States comml at, Halifax, l\lr.

A<lmiral Inglefield, of the Royal Xa,·y, took special interest in the obsernitious, and ast'lig1H··l a <lepository in his own quart.m's for the safe keeping of the instruments when tlH'Y were not in use. Tlie mayor of Quebec wais <~1prnlly oLliging when tl1e ol~iect sought was Lrougbt to his notice bJ our consul, )laj. ,John X. \Yas~ou. At Montreal al111eedfnl f'adlitieis were ac1~onled hy tlH' ma,..·or at the instance of onr consulgeneral, Hon. ,John Quincy Smith. Pn;.~errntion <~( 11fafion m111·kR.-Assistant F. II. Gerdes too!r the field in July, 18rn, and h,r tbe close of October personall,Y examined a 11nmher of positiou8 at which ground marks had been phiced when the poiut;, wen; occnpit <l for the primarytriangulation of the coast between Cape Cod and New York. Two of tlle hills oce11pi1'd in former years with the theodolite haYe hcen so washed hy storms as to obliterate the ground marks, hut at all otherf\ the cones were identified. Fourteen stations were found from the oftice dPSCriptions. 'rl1est at the outset of the sun'e~· were occupied without the necessity of cleari11g lines of sight, but all are 1ww sequestered in woods or surrounded by a dense growth of bushes. All the copper holts were found in place at Falmouth station, on Cape Cod peninsula i at Pine Hill, uear Pocasset, Mass.; at Sampson's Hill and Prospect Bill on Martha's Vineyard ; and at Spencer Ifill and Broad Hill near Point .T udith, R. I. The other stations visited being in Section II will he referred to under that head. In that section and also in Section III Mr. Gerdes determined in position several of the i·ecently established lite-saving stations. From data thus gained the stations are marked on the engraved coast charts. Tida.l obserrntions.-The self-registering tide gauge lent to the city authorities of Pro,·idcuce, R. I., in 1872 is still kept in operation by the local engineers for the adjustmeut of surveys which are yet in progress. Records have been received at the office representing six ;years of the series, and these have yielded valuable results. The final discussion will be made when the series is com· plete, for developing the law which governs the tides in Narragansett Bay.

Sea ourrents.-In previom; reports the successful progress made in determining the character of sea currents off the coast. of New England has heen recorded. As therein stated, the. observations were conducted on boar<l a yessel anchored in positions at which a knowledge of the character of the currents was desirable, the depths being in some cases upwards of one hundred fathoms. Tile · satisfactory issue of observations previously made suggested that the methods adopted should be applied in the sea approaches of New York Bay, and arrangements were made accordingly. Lieut. S. M. Ackley, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Suryey, with his party in the schooner Eagre, and pro-rided with -the means for observing and recording currents at sea, pro· eooded on the 6th of August, 1879, and occupied a station about thirty-seven miles south of Martha's Vineyard.. The record at that position was continued during thirty-six hours, in which interval it wa~ observed that the current swung entirely around the compass. To the southward of Montauk

Point, and distant forty-six miles, the same result was found on the 21st of that month by observations continued for twenty-seven hours; and also at a third station to the southward and westward off Fire Island beach, where the currents were observed on the last day of August and during a period of twent~·-six hours. To the southward and eastward of the last-mentioned position a. station was occupied in ninety-nine fathoms during twenty-three l10urs on the 1st of September. There the current was noticed as vibrating between south, east, and west, as was also found at a fifth station in twenty-nine fathoms off the coast of New Jersey, about forty-eight miles southeast of Absecon Inlet. For the work here under notice the weather was very unfavorable previous to the elose of August, but was less so in the following month. After closing the observations off the coast of New Jersey, Lieutenant AckleJ- returned to New York, and after refitting the schooner Eagre sailed to the Gulf of :Mexic~ for service, of which furtl1er mention will be made in Section IX of this report. Ile was assisted in both sections by Lieut. H. T. Mouahon, U.S. N., l\Iaster Frank E. Sawyer, U.S. N., and Ensign \Varner H. Nostrand; U.S. N. Rock off' Sakonnet Point, R. I.- With bis party in the schooner Silliman, Lieut. Uriel Sebree, ·u. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, reached Newport on the 11th of Oct,ober. Bad weather coming on immediately after that date deferred the intended search for. a rock off Sakonnet Point, but the vicinity was carefully examined, and soundings were completed by the 2d of Nowmber, 1879. The rock was found very nearly in its reported JlOSitiou, and bas on it at one point only eight feet at mean low water, but the general depth is twelve feet on the ledge, which is about seventy-fiye yards long and thirt.y yards wide. All particulars in regard to this danger to navigation were published in a Notice to Mariners ou the 15th of Nm-ember. Preservatfon of station rnarks.-As already mentioned unuer the hea!l of Section I, Assistant F. H. Gerdes passed the summer and autumn of 1879 in examining the ground marks placed in former years at the primary stations when they were occupied. with the theodolite for the triangu. lation eastward of New York. In this section he visited Beacon Hill on Block Island; ~Yhiteman's Hill and Watch Hill station in Connecticut; and Osborn, Terry, and Shinnicock in New York. At all, the marks were found undisturued, and where it seemed desirable additional marks were set for identification in future. The station mark at Buttermilk Hill, near Tarrytown on the Hudson, was examined in October and made secure by suitable points of reference. In this section Mr. Gerdes visited the life-saving stations nt vVatch Hill on the coast of Connecticut and at. Short Beach on the coast of Long Island, N. Y. Both were determined in position and marked on the topographical sheet of the vicinity. With as little delay as possible the positions of tht~ life-sayiug stations are marked on the engraved plates of the coast charts. Ti1lnl obserrntions.-As stated in my last annual re1iort, :Mr. C. H. Van Orden made a series of observations at several places on the shores of Buzzard's Bay. In the middle of July, 1879, he established a· self registering tide gauge at the Block Island breakwater, and instructed the observer, M:r. J. :\I. Conley, by whom the record was kept up until the 1st of Deeemher. Topograplly and hydrography of He11tp11tead Bay, Long Island, N. r.-J<rom positions near Far Rockaway the detailed survey of the south side of' Lollg Island has been extended eastward eight miles and inland about four miles from the shore line. Within the limits just described Assistant J. \V. Donn traced the shores of Hempstead Bay, including its numerous islands and the adjacent water passages. In reference to the vicinity, the following remarks are made in the field report: "A very marked change has taken place in the bay of Fa.r Hockaway, and apparently caused by the closing of the small inlet near life.-saving station No. 34. The bay in consequence became very shallow, and near the small inlet was entirely hare at half tide. Excepting at high tide, even light-draft boats could not pass from Far Rockaway to Hempstead Bay. The beach from Far ltockaway to East Rockaway Inlet is rapidly receding, and the conditions that existed during the survey of 1845 are apparently about to be repeated. At that time there was uo outlying beach or island between East Rockaway Inlet and l!'ar Rookaway." Assistant Charles Junken co-operated in the prosecutior1 of plane-table work and bydrograpby. Because of the necessity of sounding at high water, boat work was practicable only three or four boars in the course of the day. At other intervals the topography was advanced, and the unnsua

Tidal obsermttions.-The self-registering tide gauge, started in October, 18i5, at the depot of the New Jersey Southern Railroad on Sandy Hook, has been kept in operation by :Mr. J. W. Banford. Oenerally the cur>es obtained are good, but as the water is often rough there has been considerable friction and wear the working part;.>; of the tidal apparatus. Frequent repairs have been necessary, but considering the impediments due to the exposure of the station t-0 the effect of storms the record has been well maintained. , Topograpl1y of Hutl.wn R-iver, N. 1:-The detailed plane-table SlllTey of tlle east bauk of the Hudson was extendetl in the course of the season ending with November, 1879, by Assistant II. L. \Ylliting to points about two miles aboYe Cold Spring. In i·cyiewing the character of the field work abon1 Croton, Mr. \Vhiting thus remarks: "Back of Verplank's Point, and along the central part of, the region mapped by the party, the country is broken and irregular, and the numerous copses and rows of shade trees made the deter· mination of contour slow and difficult." Throughout, tile detached hills and knolls are represented IJy the mmal signs and contour curves, and these, although the larger features of the Highlands, form striking details on the map. The extenl:!ion of this survey uorthward has necessitated ti.le erection and determination of signals, many of which were Illaced on the highest peaks of th.e Highlands. All the trigonometrical stations were identified, and subsidiary points were determined with special care. Difficulties of unusual character are presented by the surface features, hut these are admirably delineated on the topographical sheets. The statistics of work done in the present season arc:

Assistant Whiting was aided in the work here noticed by Mr. W. C. Hodgkins. Jfagnetic observations.-Under the heacl of Section I, mention has been made of the plan of operations adopted at the outset of the fiscal yea.1· for gaining data in regar(l to the distribution of magnetism along the coast of New England. In this section, and after closing his operations in Se-0tiou I and in Canada, Snuassi,,;taut J. IL Baylor occupied a station at Rouse's Point, N. Y., in September, 187!1, and there determined thP magnetic declination, d!p, and intensity. As usual, the operations were repeated on two consecu tive days, l:lud two sets of observations for azimuth were recorded at the same station. At Albany similar series of observations were made in Oct-0ber. On his way northward at the outset of the season in July, Mr. Ba.ylor determined the magnetic elements at Sandy Hook, N. J., antl at Hartford, Conn. Fourteen stations in all were occupied in the course of the season for work in uorthem sections. Later in the fiscal year determinations were made at points near the 8outberu seaboard, as will be stated under the heads of Sections IV, v, and VI. · Before taking the field the magnetic instruments were carefully tested by observing with them at the standard magnetic station on Capitol Hill, Washington, D. C., arnl after the return of ~Ir. Baylor in ()(ltober the observations were repeated there. Reconuaissance west of Lake Champlain.-ln July, Assistant S. 0. ~IcCorkle conferred with Assistant Cutts, at Rutland, Vt., and then visited Prospect Mountain, one of the primary points in the vicinity of Lake Champlain. That station has a height of twenty-three hundred and S. Ex. 12----.3

sixty feet, and nearly due north of it is .Mount )farcy, a summit about fifty-four hundred feet high. The length of the line joining them is upwards of fifty miles. Proceeding westward from this line as a base, ~Ir. McCorkle passed on to Lake Ontario, and at interTals selected points for continuing a system of triangulation. His reports contain information in regard to the topography of the wild region through which he passed. Assistant McCorkle trayeled alone and relied only for help in climbing mountains or trees on the inhabitants of the cabins nearest to the place of ascent. The project was extended westward to Oswego, bnt on account of many hindrances the interyisihility of some of the points renrnins uucertain. In another season the scheme of triangulation will be perfected. Before entering upon the reconnaisi;ance, Mr. lfcUorkle had a personal conference with the director of the New York State survey, Mr. James T. Gardner, who communicated notes respecting the region. The printed reports of the survey by Mr. Verplanck Colvin were also found useful in traversiug the country westward of the line selected as a base for joining with the primary triangulation of New England. The reconnaissance was elosed at the end of October, 18i9. Pennsyfrania and Xew Ym·k boundary line.-For the determination of additional points desire<! by the Joint Commission on the New York and Pennsylvania boundary, Assistant Edwin Smith resumed field work a.t Waverly, N. Y., on the 2iJth of August, 1879. There an ohi'lerdug station was occupied and connected by measurement with a monument which stands a few hundred feet cast of the sixtieth milestone of the boundary. For the latitude of the station at Waverly, twenty pairs of stars. were observed during four nights cloRing with the 2<1 of September, and fifty-two observations were recorded. At Little Meadows a station was locater! midway between the thirty-ninth and fortieth milestones, arid fifty observations were ma<le between the 3tl and 7th of Septemher. Next, day tlie party moved to J,awrenccville and occupied a station a fow feet north of the ninetieth mileshme. lu observing the same stars for latitude, forty-uine obserrntions were recorded by the middle of the month. At Austiubnrgh the position chosen was a fow feet south of the old fifth-latitude stone of the year 1787, which is between the one hundred and ninth and one hundred and tenth milestones of the boundary. During three nights fifty-eight observations were made for latitude on twenty stars. Near Shongo, in Genesee Valley, a station was occupied adjacent to the one hundred and twentyninth milestone, and, using the same list of stars, fifty-eight observations were recorded for the determination of latitude. On the 23d of September tlie party moved to Ceres and made tbe same number of observations during three nights. In Tnna Yalley a position was chosen near Limestone, arnl after the close of cloudy weather the instrument was set np a few feet north of the old seventhlatitmle station of 1787, which is between the one hundred and sixty-seventli and one hundred and sixty-eighth milestones of the boundary. With duly selected pairs of stars sixty-three observations were made for latitll(le, and on the nights of September 30 and October 1 one hundred and sixty obsen-ations were taken to determine the angular value of one revolution of the micrometer screw of meridian telescope So. 13. At Corydon tbe instrument was set up a few feet north of the one hundred antl eighty-fourth milestone, and the latitude of the place was ascertained by sixty-two ohsen·ations recorded during two nights of the first week of October. The last station occupied by Assistant Smith was at Sugar Grove, nearly midway between the two hundred and third and two hundred and fourth milestones, where fifty-uine observations were recorded for latitude, and work was closed on the night of the 10th of October. At the nine stations an aggregate of five hundred and nine observations were recorded for latitude o.n thirty-one pairs of stars. The field computation gives as the mean probable error of one observation on a pair of stars :!:: 011 .33, a result that would be considered good from rooords of observations with either of the large zenith telescopes. In turning over the reductions of his observations along the forty-second parallel .Assistant Smith thus remarks: "They show a surprising degree of accuracy in the survey of the line by Uittenhouse in 1787. Bis party must have cut their way through the woods. The line was run with a compass, and the instruments used to det-0rmfoe latitudes must have been inferior in construction, as compared with tbose ~ow employed." Of ihe nine latitude statjons 9f 1787, Mr.

Smith's results show that at five the error in position was less than one second. At Tuna Valll:'y the error was about four seconds; and at Genesee Yalley somewhat le11s than two and a half :seconds. At the two other stations occupied tlie error found was less than one second and a half. Assistallt Smith ·was aidecl in the field by Mr. F. H. Parsons. The work was specially facilitated hy tl\e personal co-operation of fi1r. C. M:. Gere, a memher of the Pennsylvania Commission. Ha,·ing previously passed along tl1e boundarj·, that gentleman preceded the J)arty of Mr. Smith, and set up piers and 1loors at all the station!'. The difficultie8, oelays, and expense thus aYoided were ...-ery considerable. Mr. Gere, by reason of weather suitable for the astronomical work, was unable t.o keep more than one station ahead of the obserrnr. Includiug tbe time needful in tlie transfn and adjustment of instruments at the nine stations, all the work was accom1)lished in forty-four (lays. Oeorletic npe1Ydiot18 iii Kew Jersey.-ln }fay, 1819, Prof. Edward A. Bowser readjusted tlie signals at l\Iount Rost>, Pickles, Mount Olive, and Bald Hill, and then resumed the measurement of horizontal angles at Mount Horeb, where lie had closetl for the season at the end of October iu the preceding ;rear. IJ_y the transfer of a heliotrope from one to another of the outlying stations~ the ""ork at Horeb Station was tmccessfully continued. Early in July a tripod was built at .l\Iount Olive, and that station was occupied with the theodolite in the latter part of the month after the completion of augular roe\tsurements at Mount Horeb. At intervals in August and September reconnaissance was extelHled northward and two points of the Blue ~fountain ridge were added to tlw scheme of triangulatiou. One of thPse (High Point) is near ihe northwestern cOrnt'.r of the State, and adjaci:nt to the ~ew York boundary line. In that quarter the scheme was perfected b~ the selection of a third point to the eastward and not far from the State bouudary. From Mount Horeb six primary signals were observed upon, and as many subsidiary points . .At Mount Olive angular measurements were reconled on five outlying primary stations, and on six snbsi<liary objects.

Triangulation of tlte I>elam1re Ri1 1 1~r below Pkiladelpltia.-After the completion of the special survey of the Delaware at Philadelphia, of which mention was made in my last annual report, th(· triangulation of the rirnr was extended below the city, and as far as Chester, by .Assistant R. :M. Bache. His party was employed in that ser,·ice during the autumn of 187f). In prosecuting this work along the Delaware, all the difficulties incident to the occupation of the banks by structures put up in recent years were encountered. Se\en platform signals from forty to fifty feet high were found necessary to hring into view the points needful for defining shore Jines the directions and relations of which have been sensibly changed in the march of improYement. One point only of the original triangulatfon of this part of tile Delaware could be ide.ntified, and with that the work here under notice was only connected. In addition to a system of quadrilaterals restricted to points along the water lines, four stations were occupied at distances averaging a mile and a ha.If from the banks. These positions will serve future uses in topowa,phical surveying, and for such purposes the triangulation is ample, as will be seen by the following synopsis of statistics: Stations occupied ..... , ... _....... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . · · . 2:~ .Angles measured _ ·..·...... _ .. _.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · · · · . . . . . · . . 125 Points determined . . . . · . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 Number of observations .................................................. 11, 484 Pendulum observa.HQns.-The pendulum operations instituted for ascertaining vertical attraction near the Allegheuy Mount:ains, and commenced in 1878 by Assistant C. S. Peirce at Allegheny Observatory, have. been completed by occupying a sta.tiou at Ebensburg in Cambria County, Pennsylvania., and a station at York in the same State. In careful determinations of the difforence of longitnde between Ebensburg and .Allegheny, .Assistant Peirce was aided by an observer who acted at the last-named phice un<ler the supervision of Prof. S. P. Langley, director of the Observatory.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

For the purposes of the pendulum experiments, time was telegraphed daii.r, and thus the observations made for time at Ebensburg were supplemented. The latitude of the station there was determined by observations with a sextant. At that station Mr. Peirce was aided by Messrs. Henr~· ll'arquhar and )farcus Baker. The first-named aid made the observations at York under the supervision of Assistant Peirce. At both of the stations in Pennsylvania extensive series of obserrntions were recorded for the purpose of studying the statical and dynamical flexure of variously mollified pendulum supports, and the influence of these modifications upon the period of oscillation of the pendulum. The results will be given hereafter in a se11arate paper by Assistant Peirce. In the course of tbe season experiments were made by substih1ting for the ordinary knife edge of the pendulum small steel cylinders. This method, proposed in a pre'\ious report by Assistant Peirce, had been independently recom· mended by l\f. Yvon Villerceau, but the trials made h~· l\fr. Peirce prmTed that the friction was increased by that method of swinging the pendulum. · The measurement of the acceleration of gra~it.r made by Assistant l'eirce at Paris, France, revealed a disagreement with the measures obtained by Borda and Biot. Por the investigation of the discrepancy, )fr. Peirce again visited Paris, with the sanction of the honorable Secretary of tlie Treasury, and by theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated from principles not known in their times that the results obtained by the two cefobrated physicists were subject to certain very large corrections. These, when properly applied, brought their ret'lults into perfect accord with results alreatly reported by Assistant Peirce, who read a memoir upon the subject before the Academy of Science of the Institute of France. The paper w<is printed in the Comptes Rendus for the 14th of June, 1880, and on its reference to a committee the conclusions of Assistant Peircci received the approval of the Academy. Operations for the com1mrison of the meter with a wave length of light ba,,e heen provisionally completed, ~'et certain parts of the work require verification-in particular the comparison of decimeters with the meter has beeu only partly made. In connection with this subject Assistant Peirce has published, with my approval, in the American Journal of l\fathematics, a memoir upon certain apparitions which appear in diffraction spectm. These were shown to be consequences of eccentricity in the screw used in ruling the diffraction plates. By another obsel'Yer the subject was treatetl in a paper presented to the American ,'\ssociation for the Adrnncmnent of Science at their lai::t meeting in Boston. · Geodetic operations in Pennsylvania.-Prof. I..ewis M. Haupt at the opening of the fiscal ;rear employed his field party in the erection of signals and in examining and permanently marking the stations to be observed on in the course of the season. Near Reading, in Berks County, a station was occnpied, and from it angular measurements were made on three points previousl~· occupied to the northward. To the southward and west\mrd four other positions were completed in angular measurements so as to extend the work through Lancaster County to the immediate vicinity of the Susquehanna Rh-er. At Uawlinsville, in the lower part of the last-named county, a junction was made with stations of the coast triangulation near the head of Chesapeake Bay. From the records of the field work whieh closed in September, 1849, the Computing Division of the office has added five a.dditional entries ia the register of geographical positions. In J n1y the weather was unf~worable, but was much more satifactory in August and September.

Life-saving stations.-Before taking up duty which has been mentioned under preceding heads, Assistant F. H. Gerdes passed along the coasts of Delaware, :Mar_yland, and Virginia, and determinecl the positions of three life-saving stations. These ha Ye heen recently established, one at Uehoboth Beach, one at Ocean City, and the third at l'ope's faland, on the coast of Virginia. Good observations were recorded at each of the stations, aml their plitces are careful!~· marke<l ou the plane-table sheets. .As heretofore, the positions will be inserted on the engrayed charts. While )fr. Gerdes was ou the roast of Delaware, in July, he made thorough inquiry in regar1l to the point near Ijewe.'! at whiclt the Trausit of Yen us was obserYed in the year 1769. The site probably occupied was iu that ;rna.r au open common, but the ground is now laid out in gardens attached to the dwellings of residents, and a church has been erected within the century, and near the church there is a burial-grouncl. As late as 1842 tradition pointed to this locality as the place at which the Transit was observed, but no one now living at Lewes was able to gi>e definite information in regard to the spot occupied by the observer. Assistant Gerdes kept the fielil until the middle of October, engaged in service in other sections. Hydi·ographi.c i·ecomiai..~sance of Chi1wotengue Inlet and approachCJ!.-lu the vicinity of the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia, a careful hydrographic examination was made by Mr. J. W. Parsons <luring a week in tlle latter part of NoYeni.ber, 1879. Serial lines of soumlings were run across the bar. Descriptin~ notes of the seaward approaches and posit.ions of buo~·s, with correct courses for entering tlie inlet, make parts of the record, and in it attention is called to the excellent shelter afforded during easterly gales or head winds by what is local!.' known as "Chinco· teague anchorage," which is a short 11istanre northeast of the bar, and under the southern side of th~ extensiYe Chincoteague Shoals. The channel leading across Chincoteague Bar was found to be nearly as it wa.':l thirty .Years ago, an apparent permanence that may be due to the closing in that interYal of Geeen Run Inlet, which was formerly a much-used thoroughfare at the northern en1l of Chincoteague Island. l\lr. Parsons, on his return to tlle office, embollied bis notes and ohserrntions in the mannscript of the third volume of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. Soundings in Patapsoo River, .ilfd.-At the request of l\lr. .X. H. Hutt-0n, engineei· to the Harbor Board of Baltimore, the Patapsco was sounded in February last between Lazaretto Puint and HawJdns' Point. This work was done by Assistant Charles ,J unken, aided by 1Iessrs. r. A.Welker and G. F. Bird, and rests on the triangulation made in previous smTers. Five additional points were occupied, after the erection of signals by the party. The shore line of the rh·er was then traced by means of the plane table.

Jiagnetic obseri:ations.-At the standard ol>servatory on Capitol Hill, where observations for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity have been repeated yearly, the customary series was recorded on the 12th, 11th, and 17th of June, 1880. Assistant Charles A. Schott has usually made the ol>servations in person, but this year they were recordcll under his immediate direction by Subassistant J. B. Baylor, mention of whom will be found as concerned in magnetic observations in all the sections of the Atlantic coast. After his return from the south, in April last, be tested, at the 1Yashington station, the instruments used at various places along the coast. Special hydm{Jraphic nperations.-Earl~ in Jnly, 1879, J\laster :Francis '\Yimslow, U. S. N., Assil;tant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, again rbaclied Crisfield, Md. 1 with his party, in the schooner Palinurus. He had previously developed the positions and areas of oyster beds in Tangier Sound and Pocomoke Sound, and in continuing researches the beds in the Nanticoke and Little Annemessex Rivers and in Hooper's Strait and Kedge's Strait were surveyed. The intercourse of Master 'Yinslow last year with persons engaged in the oyster trarle enabled that officer to prepare a list of questions for collecting all the information possible in regard to the subject. Printed copies of queries were judiciously distribute.I, and many have been returned with answers sl10wing that the questions were not new in the minds of the persons to whom the lists were sent. Much information has been gathered in that way in the course of the year. In connection with his surveys Master Winslow gave much attention to the determination of temperatures in the water over oyster beds, and also recorded observations for ascertaining the density. Before leaving the section, hurdles were placed on ijie beds in Tangier Sound and Pocomoke Sound, but most of these could not be found later in the month. (Three only remained; the otherR were doubtless taken away by those who coveted the rope by which .all the hurdles were moored.) Thirteen sections Wt're run across the sounds for the determination of densities . .:\laster Winslow conferred freely with Prof. ,Y. :K. Brookes, of the .Tohns Hopkins University, and interchanged views and suggestions in regard to the object of the researches. The work afloat was suspended by the detachment from sen'ice of l'!faster Winslow in Decem· ber, 1879. The judicious arrangement of details made by that officer for continuing the investiga· tions will greatly facilitate the prosecution of the work herellfter. Until the 10th of December, Master Winslow was assisted hy !I-laster H. H. Barron, U. S. N. Suri1ey of ,Jame.~ Ri1·er, Va.-In previous years the detailed survey of James River had been advanced to stations above City Point by Assistant J. '\"l\r. Donn with a party working in the schooner Scoresby. The work was resumed-in December, 187!}1 and by the close of the first week of March, 1880, the topog-raphical work was completed as far up as the Falls at Richmond and Manchester. A resurvey of the jetties and wing walls erected by the James River Improvement Company was made to include the structures added within the year. Dutch Oap Canal was also retraced to show the result of cutting on the east side since the survey of 1877. To facilitate the hydrographic work, the shore lines of the rh-er from Graveyard Reach to City Point were tra-versed with the plane table, for the pnrpose of locating points to be used by the sounding party. About two hundred signals were set up, and three hundred points were determined in position. In the course of l\farch, April, and part of May the hydrography of the river was pushed from Warwick Bar down to City Point, where a junction was u,.ade with the sheet of soundings previously complet,ed. Above Warwick Bar the soundings will be made by Assistant Engineer H. D. Whitcomb, of the James River Improvement C<>mpa.ny. Data for that work were furnished by Assistant Donn with the understanding that the results should be sent to this office. I~or the bydrography temporary tidal stations were occupied at Falling Creek and at Cori's

Ju accordance, therefore, with previous arrangements, Assistaut A. T. :Mosman organized a J>arty early in July at Gordonsville, and went in camp at the foot of Fork ~fountain. The instruments were taken to the summit, the height of whic!J. is thirt;v-eight hundred aml fifty feet, and by the middle of ,July, 187fl, all preparations were complete for the 111Pasnrement of horizontal angles. The weatller was oft1·Jt nnf:-worable, being alternatdy lwz_y arnl rai11y, lrnt 011 1lie flth of Augni-;t tile record of needful observations was dosed, ancl the instruments were transferred to Humpback J\Ionutain, 1he heig'l1t of which is thirty-six hundred and forty-five feet. Bad weather was frequent, but by occn1\ying all favorable interrnls the work at the summit was completed by the 28th of August. Early in September the instruments were in position at Tobacco Row (twenty-nine hundred and thirty-six feet high), another of the stations pre\'iously occnpied for the triangulation which has been extended southward and westward along the Blue Ridge. In the conrse of four days Assistant Mosman recorded observations on signals to the westward, as at tlie other two stations, for pushing field work in that direction. Thus the chain of triang·Ies in advancing towards the Ohio will be joined on two lines of the excellent triangulation which has been conducted through the Shenandoah Valley and southward to the base line near Atlanta in Georgia. In the middle of September l\Ir. Mosman transferred his party to Bald Mountain, a station about fifty-six miles 1:o the westwa.rd of Tobacco Row, and in the course of a few days following a period of cloudy weather the requisite angular measures were reconled there. Tlte camp equipa.ge and instruments were then stored at Healing Springs, to be in readiness for future operations after perfecting the scheme of triangnlation by further reconnaissance. After forwarding to the office his original records and duplicates of the same, .Assistant Mosman stiarted westward on the 1st of October, and by the 8th of December >isited many summits in pa.rssing through West Virginia. The heights were ascertained approximately by the barometer, and all were kept in geodetic connection with the two western lines of the chain of triangulation going southward. The report from the field was accompanied by a sketch showing a practicable scheme of work as far as the Ohio River. Many of the stations chosen are upwards of three thousand feet in height. Primary triangulation, latituile, and azimuth.-It has long been desirable to extend the time during which in the course of twenty-four hours observations ma.y be recorded for horizontal directions. Genera.lly the period is limited to a short interval after sunrise and another before sunset when exhalations occ~ioned by the sun's action have been sufficiently quieted t-0 allow distinct vimon on lines of .sight ranging from twenty to eighty miles. Since the year 1871, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle has esperimented occasionally u1>on methods for rendering signals ~isible ,at night upon long lines. In my annual report for 1878 mention was made

of his results obtained by means of magnesinm riubou while the primary triangulation was in progress in North Carolina. At Sugar Loaf, a primary station in Montgomery Count~', Maryland, a series of obsen·ations were instituted by :l\Ir. Boutelle, and experiments were continued between July and November, 1879. The results as set forth in his report (Appendix No. 8) seem to promise an extension of three or more hours of successful observation after sunset on each clear night. The experimental observations were made with a twenty-inch theodolite, and with reference to the relative cost of angular measurements by day and at night. While the party was at the station on Sugar Loaf, observations for latitude and local time were made by Assistant F. D. Granger aud Mr. J. B. Boutelle. Azimuth was also determined hy the same observers from obser,·ations on Polaris.

Jllagnetie ob11en,atfons.-lTnder Sections I and II mention has been made of the determination of magnetic elements by Srrbassistant J.B. Baylor at points in "New England and Canada. For continuing that special serviee the requisite instruments an<l outfit were proYided at the end of the year 18iH, and early in ,January following .Mr. Baylor occupied a station at Beaufort, N. C. After determining approximately the latitude, longitude, and azimuth, the iustruments were placed in position in the rear of a lot bounded by Ann street and Front street, an1l observations were recorded for magnetic declination, dip, and intensitJ·. On the completion of the series in the record, :Mr. Uaylor moved southward. 1\Iention of his progress in the work will be made nuder sul>sequent heads in this report. Hydrography, coa~t of Korth Oarolina.-'fbe inshore ,soundings along the coast of North Carolina have been completed within the season at two localities by Lieut. Eugene B. Thomas, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with a part.y working in the steamer Endeavor. One of the projections represents the hydrograpby between Ocracoke Inlet and a point on the coast a short distance abore Cape Lookout. The seeornl sheet contain8 the re8ults of soundings made from New River Inlet southward and westward to Barren Inlet. Both of the sheets join with hydrographic work previously completed, and in conformity with usage depths are shown on them to an a>erage distance of about twelYe miles se.awarcl. The inshore hydrography of the coast of North Caroliua is now continuous from the northern to the southern bouutlary. The steamer Endeavor left New York for this section on the 26th of December, 1870, and again reached that port on the 2!Jth of the following May. Lieutenant Thomas thus refers to the character of the hydrography in his concluding report: "No shoals were discovered, nor any noticeable irregularity in the soundings; but Ocracoke Bar has shifted to the southward several hundred yards since the date of the last suney. A new inlet, called Sadbury's Iulet, has broken ont between Old Inlet and Rich Inlet, with very little water on the bar. "New Topsail Inlet sometimes has as much as eight foet of water at high tide, hut after a . southerly gale it was found to be shoaled up to three feet." "Stump Inlet is closed up, and the bar off it has disappemwl. "New Uiver Inlet is not known to have more than se\'en fet of water. 'l'he general (lepth is about five foet." During the temporary illness of Lieutenant Thomas, the opemtions of the party were conducted with judgment and energy by Lieut. Hugo Osterhans, U. S. N. Master Francis E. Greene, and Ensign William H. Allen, U. S. N., also serred efficiently in tlie hydrographic part~·. The statistics of the work are :

Longitude uf Atlanta, Ga.-'l'he longitude of NashYille, 'l'enn., in Section XIII, basing b~n previously established, it will be noticed u11der that he.ad aud under Section YIU that Assistant8 G. W. Dea11 and Edwin Smith were U8signed in ~oYcmbcr. 1879, to exchange signals between that station and se,·eral points in the South for lougitmle determinations. Betweeu the 26th of December and the l 4U1 of .1 anuary, 11':-iO, obsernttions wen: 1'.<Uecessfully exchanged on five nights between .Assistant Dean at Atlanta, Ga., aud Assistant Smith at NasliYille. As usual, the observers then exchanged I>laces, and 1luring five nights longitude signals were reeorcled between the 20th and 27th of January. For the final determination of longitude at a point in Charleston, S. C., Assistant Dea,n started for that city on the 1st of l\far, 1880, and with the permission of the city authorities marked with two granite blocks a station on the highest part of Citatlel Square. On ten nights, between tbe 13th and 24-th of May, signals were exchanged with A8sistant Smith, who remained at Atlanta. The mayor of Chadcstou Yisited the statiou while observations wert' in progress, and made arrangements for the protection of the granite blocks that mark the station. Observations for latitude were recorded at Atlanta, and tlw computations from them were made h;r C. H. Sinclair, the aitl attached to the part.)· of .Assistant Smith. The two longitmle partfos of Assista11t Dean all(] Assistant Smitll were proYided with astronomical and telegraphic instruments similar in constrnction and so far as possible alike in all essential p1trticu1arn. The trausit telescopes were forty·fl.Ye iul°lH'R focal leul!th. and were used with a mag· nitying power of about 011e lumdred. A thin glass diapuragm having thirteen Yertical hues cut in it was used with the tele.scope. EacL star was generally olJ;;erved iu its passage across the eleYen mi(1tlle liues forming- the three rniddle groups, tlte equa.torial inten'als of a. gronp being about two seconds of time. ''So far as practicable tlrn same twenty 8tars were obsPrved each night by both obseners. The stars were seleett'1l from the stamlard li><t, aud arrauged in four groups with special reforern:e to the stations and times at whiell tlley were to be ollserved. Each group had one circumpolar and four zenith starf:, and after recordiug observations on n group the tlescope was carefultv reversed iu position for obsening 011 a ser·oml group. Tl.ten followed the exdiauge of longitude signals, after which two more 11et8 of starn were obsen-ed, completing operations for the 11igllt. "Arraugemcnts were made for carefully meaRnriug· the armature times of the polarized and Farmer relays, and the following plan was adopted : The polarized relays were first adjusted to the standard tension of the current as indicated upon the scale of a tangent galr-anorneter {forty-eight divisions), ancl the positions of those adjusted were marked upon each relay. For convenience, tbc standard reading on the galvanometer (forty-eight divisions) was made ten or more divisions le~s than the galvanometer would indicate when connected in the ordinary telegraph circuit. "At each station the rclar magnets were arranged to pass the entire current of the main circuit through the Farmer relay, but when the polarized relay was adjusted for exchanging long-itu<le signals (by connecting the rheostat in its omnch c\rc11it) only a portion of the main current was allowed through the polarized r\~la.y. Of course when the rheostat is connected in its hranch circuit witlwut resistance the main current will be uearl~· equall~- diyi1le<l, one-lialf or less passing through the galvanometer and polarized relay, causing the reading of the tangent scale of the galrnnometer to be less than forty-eight diYisions. Hence, by increasing the resistance through the rheostat, the current passing through the polarized relay is adjusted to the standard tension, when the gal van om· eter is rr.ade to indicate forty-eight on the tangent scale." The Farmer relays were made with special reference to the reduction of armature time, and as far as rracticable to insure an equality in the measurements of these times at two or more stations. The results of the season indicate that adrnnce has been made in the right direction. Assistant Dean, umler whose supervision the relays were constructed, says: "The soft iron cores of this relay are tlat bars one and seven eighths inches in length, fifteensixteenllis of an inch in width, and one-eighth of an inch in thickness. The oores were made fiat to secure a prompt response of the armature when making or breaking the main circuit. A similar

effect upon the armature of the main relay may be produced by making a slit lengthwise and to the center of the round iron cores. "Each coil of the llelix is one and three-quarter inclles in length, and made of silk-covered copper wire No. 367 special care being taken to immre the most perfect insulation at each layer of the wire when placed in the coil. l·'or convenience in adjusting one pole of the magnet at the maximum distance from the armature axis, the ends of the helix were placed one above the other upon the movable slide. The armature lever is about three inches in length, the weight of the armature being as little as the stability of the instrument would permit. "To obtain a high tension upon the armature u.r means of sligl1t adjustments of the armature spring, the spring is attached as near to the eutl of the armature lever as practicable. The helix is securerl to a slide, by which it may be conveniently adjusted at any require(l distance from the armature, thereby increasing or diminishing tension upon the armature in accordance with requirement.'' l\fr. F. H. Parsons served as aid in the party of Assistant Dean and made part of the computations for longitude. In the course of the season, between tbe 25th of November, 1879, and the 24th of May, 1880, the passage of each of nine hundred and fifty stars across the meridian was observed upon eleven lines of the transit diaphragm. As in past years, thf'> \Yet-1tern Union Telegraph Company, by its president, Hou. Norvin Green, accorded all facilities requisite for the longitude operations, and all connected with the company along the lines upon which exehanges of signals were made co-operated to secure the results Rought by the observers. In telegraphic exchanges between tlte obsen'ers at Charleston, S. C., and Atlanta, Ga., an aggregate of oue hundred and eighty-nine observ~tions on twenty stars were recorded in the course of fiye nighti;. The latitude of Atlanta was determinetl by ni'nety-three observations ou nineteen pairs of stars recorded in the course of nine nights . .i1lagnetic ob.~crratiou.~.-After completing his observations at Beaufort, N. C., of which mention waR made in the prece(liug section, Snbassistant .T. B. Ba,ylor proceeded to Charleston, S. C. At Breach Iulet, on Sullivan's Island, the rnag11etic iustrunwuts were mounted near the "Truesdale House,'' and as near to the point occupied in 1849 as the drifted sand would allow. 'fbcre the usual series of obsernitions were recorded for magnetic declination, dip, an(l horizontal intensity. The geographical position of the place in respect of latitude and longitude was determined approximately. This station was oecuph·d on the 20th, 21st, and 22d of January, 1880. Without delay :Mr. Baylor went southward to occupy a point in Georgia. Tbe station i.;eledt'd was in Lawton, now known as Du Pont, a village in the southern part of Georgia, and about a hundred and thirty miles from Savannah. Tl1e place of observation is not far from the depot, but as in all other cases care was taken in regard to the possibiJit,y of local attraction. After recording observations on the 28th and 29th of January, the observer proceeded to .Jacksonville. His operations there will be again referred to under the head of Section VI. Atlantic Coast Pilot.-At the close of February last, Lieut. Frederick Collins, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, completed and deposited in the office seven volumes in manuscript containiug r11ltailed descriptions of parts of the southern coast of the United States and adjacent islands, with sailing directions for the harbors and navigable waters. The localities described range from Cape Henry, Va., to Winyah Bay, S. C.; from Wassaw Sound to Altamaha Sound, Ga.; from Saint Simon's Sound, Ga., to Dry Tortugas, Fla.; the Bahama Bank, Siilt Key Bank, and the uorth coast of Cuba; Providence Channel; and the interior waters of North Carolina and Virginia. In forwarding the volumes, Lieutenant Collins remarks: "While preparing thls matter for publication 1 have studied to condense it as much as possible, but nothing is omitted that seems to be calle1l for to carry out tile general plan and SCOJIB of the work as shown in the portions already published." · SECTION VI.

1880, at a station in Clinch Oounty, Georgia, and without dela~· proceeded to JacksonYille, Fla. There he recorded ohservations for the magnetic elements at a station about an eighth of a mile from the water works, on a hill north of the city. This series was closed on the 3d of Febi·uar~·· At Saint Augustine a station was occupied on the government reservation. 'l'lrn magnetometer tent was set up in the grass plot northwest of the old fort and north of tLe old gates. As at other places, the declination, dip, and magnetic intensity werf' determined in the usual wa.;r. The records needful at Saint Augustine were completed on the 11th of February. Proceeding to the southward, the instruments were set up at Enterprisf'. The station is in the rear of the >illage on the road to New Smyrna. Uare was taken, al'\ in all other car.;es, to guard against the effect of local influence on the magnet. After l'l~con1ing the usual series for declination, dip, and intensi(y, Mr. Baylor moved to Ean Gallie, in Ilre>ard County, Floricla. Ohsernitions were recorded there at a station two hundred and sixteen feet north of the old "Agricultural College,'' and the series was completed on the 25th of the month. The next position selected was at Saint Lucie, on Indian Rin·r. Ou tile beach the obse1Ting tent was set up two hundred and ninety-five yards south of Paine's wharf, and there the customary observations were recorded for declination, dip, and intensity . .At Jupiter Inlet, a station was occupied on the sand beach about three-quarters of a mile southeast of ,Jupiter light-homie. The position of the instruments was ten feet from the mean low-water line, and a little castwar<l of the thicket on the north side of the inlet. There the requisite measures for magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were completed on the 8th of l\Iarch. l\[r. Ilaylor then started for New Orleam1. His operations there will be stated under the head of Section VIII. At Saint Angnstiue, all facilities needful in tlw operatiouil of the ohi<Prwr were courteously supplied by Heutenant-Colonel Dent, TT. S. A. Deep-sea c.r-pfora-tion.~ in the vieinity of Cuba.-The steamer Rlake, wit11 tlJP bydrographfo part~· of Commander .J. H. Bartlett, U. S. N., Assistant in the Cm1st anrl Geodetic Surve.>, left. Xmv York on the 20th of Deeember, 187fl, to continue the inn~stigationR which were begun last year iu the waters of the Caribbean Sea. On the north sille of CulJa, lines of soundings were rnn at different point~ across the Bahama Channel, and these were traversed b~· diagonal lines for yerif~·ing the depths. Tlte least water (two hundred and eighty-four fatqoms) was found a!Jreast of Paradise Light, but tlie clepth increases to five hundred fathoms abreast of Lobos Ca.r Light, aIHl going southeasterly to twehe hundre1l and fifty-five fathoms off Maternillos Light. A line run from the coast of Cuba across to Cay Saint Domingo, and from thence by Brmrn Shoal, Mira1>rovos Island, and Cay Verde, gave an average depth of fourteen hundred fathoms, and the same depth was found on a line from Castle Island to lnagna Island. Earnest effort1; were made to procure additional 1mundings for developing the ridge betweeu Cuba and Hayti, but owing t-0 the strength of the trade winds onl~· a few soundings werP snee,es8fnlly recorded 011 the ridge. These, however, accord well with the <lepths foun<l in the preceding season. From a depth of seven hundred fathoms, the dredge brought up a quantity of crust from the bottom composed of coral sandstone; the specimens of life were a few small fiat sea urchins, spiral 11hells, small sponges, and one little fish. The only other haul made directly on the ridge (in sen·n lrn11dred and seventy.two fathoms) brought up the same kiml of coral rock and a large quantity of the shell of Scalpclliim regium 1 a sort of barnacle, apparently Yery old and 1liscolored. Commauder Bartlett noticed that the sea bottom on the south si<le of the ridge yielded more Ptcropod Rbells than the bottom on the 01iposite side. Serial temperatureR were taken, and are in agreement with those recorded in the last cruise of the steamer Blake. In general, the data ohtained tends to establish the theory put forward last year by Commander Bartlett, that mneh of the supply for the Gulf Stream passes near to the eastern end of Cuba. Soundings run by the party, between Hayti and Jamaica, developed an aYerage depth of eight hundred fathoms, except in a remarkably deep channel leading from the main Caribbean south of Saint Domingo, to the waters north of Jamaica. This channel runs close to Hltyti, with a maximum depth of twelve hundred fathoms, but its mean depth is about a thousand fathoms. Its course is northerly along the western end of Hayti, where it does not exceed a width of five or six miles;

thence westerly below :Navass~t Island, with a tongue to the northward, between Navassa and Formigas lfank. Another tongue passe1; to the westward between Forrnigas Bank and ,Jamaica. From Saint Iago de Ou ha a line was ru11 to the east end of Jamaica, where the depth of water wa8 three thou8and fatl10m8 at a position twenty-five miles south of Cuba. B~· subsequent soundings this was found to be the emitern end of an immense valley in the sea bottom, beginning between Cuba aud Jamaica, and extending below the Cayman Islands well into the Ba.y of Hornlnra!'I. The Cayman Islands aud l\Iisteriosa Bank appear to be snrnmib,; lmlongfog to a submarine extension of the ra11g·e nmuing alo11g the southeastern side of Cuba. At its eastern end the valley is quite narrow, but widens between the western end of ,Jamaica and Cape Cruz. On that line the depth was three t.hommml fathoms within fif°tt'en milc8 of Cuba, and twenty-eight lrnndred fathoms within twenty-five miles of ,Jamaica. Xear Grand Cayman the valley narrows again, and within twenty miles of that island a depth was found of thirty-four hundred and twenty-eight fathoms. Deep water was traced westward into the Hay of Honduras as far as a line joining :Misteriosa Bank arnl tl1e Swan Islaiulf.;, with three thousand and ten fathoms within fifteen miles of the islands. On a line betwee11 Misteriosa Bank and Bona~ca Island was found a general depth of twenty-seven lmmlred fatl1oms, and a depth of o\-er two thousand fathoms extended to the westward. 8oundi11gs were regular at twenty-five hundred fathoms between :\Iisteriosa Hank and Chin· chorro Bauk, and the same general depth was found north of -:\fisteriosa and Grand Cayman as far as the l,,;Jp of Pine:-; and Cape Sau Antouio. Between Jamaica and Mosquito Bank a few lines of soundiug·s were ruu by Comma11der Bartlett, and serial temperatures were recorded. Below seven hundred fathoms the temperature at all depths was 302°. At eight hundred fathoms on the ridge in the 'Vimlward Passage between Cuba and lfa~·ti tbe temperature aATeecl with tl1at of the imme c1npth in the Cnrihbean Sea and Gulf of l\Ie:xico. Soundings and serial t.emperatures being special o~jects of the cruise, dredgings were made onl_y for purpo;;eH of comparison. It was fon11d that t.he area ll<!Rsed over this season was not rich in specimenH of animal life, as was the sea bottom under the lee of the Windward Islall(ls, where tbe dredge was m~ed last year. (]onsidered merely as a pb,rsical feature, the developmeut of the submarine valler in the western part of the Caribbean Sea is of much interest. After completing the work prQjected at the outset of the season, Commander Ba,rtlett retumed to the north and reached New York in the steamer Blake on the 19th of l\lay. He was assisted in the work near Cuba by Lieut. W. 0. Sharrar, U. S. N.; by Masters H. M. Jacoh,v and G. ~W. Mentz, U. S. N.; and by l~nsigns G. H. Peters and E. L. Reynol<l8, U. S. N. The lines on which deep-sea soundings were recorded make an aggregate of more thau four thousand nautical miles. Four huJl(lred and sen·nteen depths were determined, and nearly four hundred ohsernitiom; were recorded for estahfo;hing the positious of the soundings. At five positions the depth fouml was greater than three thousand fathoms. Specimens of the sea bottom w<we procured at two hundred and fifty-one positions, and at all, the water densities were observed. On the 1st of Jnne, 1880, tlie Rtf'amer reached Providence, H. I., where the engine an<l boiler were thoroughly repaired, preparatory to a cruise along the axis of the Gulf Stream north of Charleston, S. C. That interesting work i,; fortunately in the hands of an officer of great sagacity, and much may he expected when Commander Bartlett returns from the cruise upon which be will enter in July. Tl1e details will be given in my next annual report. ll.tfdroyra11hy of Oharwttc Harbor and approache11, Fla..-For completing the soundings requisite for the chart of Charlotte Ilarhor, Lieut,. Commander U. M. Chester, U. s. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, with his party in the steamer .A. D. Bache, reached anchorage undPr the lee of Pine Island Shoal on the 30th of .Tannar;y. A. sheet partly done last year was first taken up and completed by filling in soundings in the waters east of Gasparilla Island. For another, soull!l· ings were finished for developing Mattacha Pass. The bydrography of Pine Island Sound was then taken up, and, in connection with it, boat work along the Gnlf sbore of Lacosta Island and Captiva Island. Outside, to the northward and southward of Boca Grande, soundings were earried into the Gulf to distances of about a mile and a half off sllfre. The work inside of Charlotte Har·

Longitude.~ £n Loui11ia11a.-On his arrirnl at ~ew Orleans, on tile 30th of January, 1880, Assistant Edwin Smith noticed that the astronomical station formerly occnpietl in that cit;y was no long(~r desirable, street cars now passing on soft ground witl!in a f('W foet of t'ttP place at which his instrument" must rest. Heuce, with permission of tlie autl1oritie1;, a station was i'iclected in Lafa,wtfr Square, aml, hy reference to a point on Saint Patrick'R d1nrd1, the new statiou was eonnected with the former one on Basin street. Assistant Smith had bt·«n pr('Yimrnly engaged at NashYillP. as will lie mentioned hereafter under the head of Section XI I 1. After the n·qnisite exchanges therr, Assistant G. W. Dean proceeder] to Kash\'ille, aml ou tl1e 11igl1ts of Yebr1rnrj' HL l!l, 21, and'.,?;) excbauged signals for lougitude with Assistant Smitl1 at °XPw Orleans. TltP two obsenerR th1·11 exchanged places, arnl similar ohsenations were recorded for longitude on the 2d, 17th, 2:M. 24th, and 27th of March, dnriug \Yltich mouth the intern~etliate night~ were u11fan1rnble for astronomical work. Between ~ew Orleans aml Atlanta, Ua., signal~ for lougitude "'ere exchanged on the last two days of March and on the 5th and 6th of April, the obseryers changing pla(!es as mmal. In the last week of April, Assistant Smith occnpie<l an a.'ltronomical station at JJaton J:nuge, in the grounds of the United States barracks. The point there selectal for ob!'errntim1s was connecteu hy Assistant :B'. D. Granger with the triangulation of the Mississippi Hi Yer. Signals for longitude were exchanged on the nights of April 24, 26, 2U, and 30, and at the same time observations for latitude were made b;y Mr. Sinclair. Of the relays used in the exchange of signals for lougitu<le, Assistant Smith thus remarks: "The Farmer relays suggested by Assistant Dean are simply Morse reln~'S with flat cores iusteall of round ones, and are for use with the highest aujmitment possiule, the oltject beinl!," to attain a discharge so rapid that discrepancies in observations on different nights shall be insignificant. * * * Both chronometer and arbitrary signals were always well receiYe<l with tlw Farmer relays. ·with the polarized relays arbitrary signals were also well re.ceivecl, but in SPn>ral cases the chronometer signals failed. In such cases the time required for the polarized relay to act was longer than the duration of the signal. * * * TI1e Farmer relays have gh'en superior results, and the manner of using them is so simple that I am in fa,vor of allamloning the plan of permanent adjustment and suhstitutfog Farmer relays or some other rapidly discharging rl'lays for the polarized ones. The rheostats and galvanometers will he used for teRt i11g the circuits, and, if desired, for equalizing currents through the relays at two stations." Assistant Smith closes his report with the suggestion that vrry rapidly discharging relayR can be made of c~·lindrical cores one :ind one-fourth inches in length, with a slot cut the entire length and filled with some insulating material, the resistance of the coih' for such rclayR to he three hundred and fifty to four hundred ohms. J<~or the longitude at Raton Rouge, sixty-seYtm observations were recorded during four nights on twenty stars. ·The latitude was determined by forty-seYen observations on seventeen pairs of

Baylor, after occupying points in six of the Atlantic coast sections, reached New Orleans on tile 21st of l\farch. 1880. Instruments were immediatcl,y set up in the Fair Grounds in tlrn center of what is known as the "wet pasture," and the ordinary series of obser\atious were recorded for magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity. This work was closed on the 25th of March. Subassistant Baylor makes special mention of the courteous offer of facilities made at New Orleans by Mr. G. W. Nott for the furtherance of the magnetic observations. Triangulation of the JJfississippi Rii·er.-At tlie re1piest of the Mississippi River Commission additional parties were detailed in the course of tlie fiscal year for determining points sufficient for the delineation of the riYt>r shore-lines. As stated in my last annual report, one of the parties, in charge of lu;sistant F. "\Y. Perkins, with the schooner' Research, continued at work through the last half of tlw previoufi fisc:1l year, and when the present year opened was engaged at stations above Doual<lsom·ille. The work advauced slowly in that vicinity, owing to the necessity of clearing lines of sight. In the aggregate, one hundred miles were opened by tedious cutting through light growth entangled witb vines and briers. AboYe the limit to which the triangulation was carried by Mr. Perkins, tbe lines were restricted in length, and consequently longer reaches of the river were passed over in the time employed by his party.

On the 28th of Xonm1ber, 18711, the party i11 the sc:hooner ReRearch was transferred at Plaquemiue to tlrn charge of Assistant F. D. Granger. Work was taken np at the last two points selected by Mr. l'erkins~ aml the triangulation was steadily pushed until the 30th of April, 1880. In atlYancing upwards, forty miles of the course of the river were defined by points, generally chosen in the immediate vicinity of the banks. ·when, of necessity, signals were Ret up on or outside of the levees special reference marks were placed on the land side to facilitate future identification. In January, fog and mist prevailed to the delay of obsen·ations, but after tlie close of that month the weather was favorable. "Thile conducting the work in the vicinity of Baton Rouge Assistant Gra11ger connected hiR triangulation with the base line measured there in a previous season. Aboye Baton Houge wooded swamps occur, and as it was found impracticable to continue along tlic hankR the chain of triangl<lR was carried across the western side of the neck to Bellevale. In the aggregate, twenty miles of lines of sight were opened hy entting RO as to admit of observing with the theodoliti'. The statistics of the triangulation are:

Assistant. Vv. H. Dennis commenced field operations on the 3d of December, 1879, aml at the end of March of the following ye.ar effected a junction with the triangulation party which had worked down the river from Natchez. Jn general, the stations were confined to the river shores and so dis· posed as to for.Ql a chain of quadrilaterals throughout. During February and .March the work was impeded by high water in the river, but the weather at the same time was very good.

The party of Assistant C. H. Boyd was organized on board the steamer Baton l~ouge on the 15th of November, 1879, and soon after commenced work in the viciuity of Natchez. Subassistant W. I. Vinal preceded the chief of the party and conducted work from the Vidalia base southward during the temporary illness of Mr. Boyd, who joined the vessel on the 23d of January. The work was pushed southward steadily, and on the 29th of March a junction was made with the triangulation of Assistant Dennis, mention of which has been already ma<le. The triangulation by the party of Assistant Boyd develops about thirty-seven miles of the course of the Mississippi. In the middle of April the party was transferred to Baton Rouge. Topogmphical work was commenced there without delay, and by the 24th of May two sheets were completed as far as the high stage of the river would then allow. These include the city of Baton Rouge and town of West Baton Rouge, and details along the banks are represented to distances of betweeu three and four miles above and below the towns. Of necessity, the sheets remain at present without the lowwater shore line, and are wanting in some details that were covered by back water when the survey was made. Master William Kilburn, U. S ..

The detailed plane-table 'York represents seven miles of the banks of the river, and all featnrPs within a mile and a half of the water lines in the vicinity of Baton Rouge. The revised computations for the latitude of Natchez show very good results from the ohserrntioWI recorded there by Assistant Edwin Smith. By the party of Assistant Charles Hosmer the triangulation of the river was extended from Grand Gull' upwa.rds to Vicksburg. He moved with the steamer Hitchcock on the 13th da,Y of November, 18711, from Saint Louis, but the vessel met with an accident a short dist:mwe below that cit, and was compelled to return for repairs. In consequence, tield work was not lwgnn nntil the lst ill' ~mber. Triangulation was continued in the vicinity of M.illiken's Bend until the 3d of January, when General Gillmore, president of the Mississippi River Commission, requested the .tmDafer of t.he pa.rty for rooonna.i888ince in the neighborhood of Grand Gulf. .After tmcing the

shore lines and sounding at Grand Gulf, in which work Mr. Hosmer was engaged until the 19th of January, he commenced the river triangulation at stations a few miles above that place, and continued up the river until the 17th of April, when a junction was made with the previous work at· Vicksburg. The extreme high water greatlJ· retarded the triangulation. After completing \rnrk to the limit just stated, the steamer Hitchcock was moved to Baton Rouge, and there a topographical Hurve.r was nuule b,v Snbassistant Joseph Hergesheimer, to include the town and rfrer shore and the village on tlie weRt hauk of the river.

Base lineg and azimtith, .il'f.ississippi Rii'er.-For the ndjustment of work done by the several parties whose operations lmve heen already noticed in this section, Assistant H. G. Ogden was assigned to service in November, 1879, provided with means for measuring base lines at intervals in the river triangulation, and also for determining azimuth. His part;v was organized at Cottonwood Point in )'Iissouri, on tbe 8th of December, 1879, at the request of the l'tlississippi River Commission, for the measurement of a line to be connected with the triangulation conducted by the United States l<Jngineers. After the completion of work at the Cottonwood base, Mr. Ogden occupied iu succession stations near Ba~'ou Sara, Baton Rouge, Lum's Point, and Lake Providence, and closed work on the 16th of May, 1880. All the sites for measurement were selected with a view to the least probability of encroachment from the river, and the lines were marked in a substantial manner with stone piers set in concrete. The base lines at Cottonwood Point, Ba.ton Rouge, and Lum's Point are somewhat more than a mile in length. The line measured at Point Coupee, opposite to Bayou Sara, is fourteen hundred and thirty-four meters, and that measured at Lake Providence is fifteen hundred and fifty-six meters in length. All were measured twice. .Azimuth observations at Cottonwood Point, Lum's Point, and Lake Providence were referred directly to stations at the respective bases, but at Bayou Sara and Baton Rouge it was found more convenient to use lines of the triangulation for the determination of azimuth. For reducing the azimuth observations, approximate latitudes were determined by zenith distances. At Cottonwood Point and Bayou Sara time was obtained by observing on two stars near the prime vertical; at other stations by the passage of time stars over a small transit set in the plane of the meridian. In observing for azimuth, the instrument was used in seven positions, two or more sets being recorded iu each, with six to eight pointings on the star in each set. Assistant Ogden was aided in the field by Messrs. Carlisle Terry and Isaac Winston. In measuring the azimuth and observing for time and approximate latitude, nearly one thousand pointings on stars were recorded. For connecting the bases with the adjacent triangulations, seventeen horizontal angles were measured by se,'en hundred and ninety-two repetitions. Good results are reported from the Computing Division from the observations recorded at these five stations.

Missis11ippi Niur le1.·els.-To fortl1er tlte Jiurposes of the Mississippi Hin·r Cornmissiou two parties were sent to tbis .section to rnn lines with the spirit leYel. Snliassistant .Andrew Braid was at New Orleans, La., earl;v in Deeeml er, !Sill. A ftt>r Htti11g out the schooner Quick, he had the ve:,;:,;el towed to Carrollton aud commenced work there on the 27th of tlle same month. Tbe bench-mark established in 187;) on the iron step of the Carrollton Railro:-id depot was ado11ted as the ha:,;i:,; for leyeling operations, hut a:,; tile Hampson bench-mark has been u:,;e.d for l!nited States eugineer sunep; since 1S50, awl is the base of the grades of the town of Carrollton, tlte aclopted beud1-rnark was can;fully refr1Ted, am! pnncell to bP 11'".~0;'J~l higher thau the Ilampsou mark. Concerning that- mark tlie followin,!.!- mformation was comnmnicatcd hy .!\Ir. W. \V. \Villiams, assistant t:'nited States engi1wcr at Carrollton: "Yfl1en the gauge at Hampson wa1; first established the zero was placed as nearl~T as could be judged at the lowest wakr mark, au<l it was fonnd that the bench-mark read 7.92 feet on tbe gauµ·e as set. Tiu· gauge was used for many yPitrs at that adjustment, aml though it \Yas nfterwards found that the zero was not down to the lowest water leYel by seren-tenths of a fool, t lie gauge ha;; been kept unaltered, that fat-er ohserrntioim might he more readily compared with those of earlier date. "There seems to be no well-ascertained relation between the Hampsou bench-mark aud sea level. The supposition that the zero of the gauge was sea h·Yel ltas been disprmTed. Now it is believed that the leYel of the Oulf of J\Iexico is from nine to twdn' inches below the zero of' the gauge, but in that couclnsion the Jeyel of r,ake Poutchartrnin was assumed to lH~ tlw same ai'i tltat of the Gulf.'' The line of hweJs run b,Y 3lr. Hraill follow;; tlie l'ast bank or the :\lissiil8ip1ii from Carrollton to Baton l~ouge; then, crossing to the west hank, tlw line follows the course of the riYer to Red l\frer Landing, wlwre the tlooderl cornlition of the country compi:lled another cros~iug. Along the east bank the line was continued np to Fort, Adams, passing oYer the hills iu that Yicinity. Permanent ben<"h-marks wNe established along tlw limo at intenTals of from three to si:x milel'. and oecasiona1ly at shorter distance:,;. Between the primarJ markc; i-;ubsidiar.v mark~ were placed, but these being temporary probably cannot lrn found after any t·onsirlerable lapse of time. Granite posts were used for the permauent marks after Suhassistant Braid found that lt_ydraulic cement was not suitable for the purpose desired. Thr method of ob:serYing i:,; that 11l~retofore described. Two lines are rnu simultaneousl,y with the rods place(l at different distances from the irnstrumcut,; and alternate sections of the line were run in opposite directions in order to neutralize accumulatiou from any tell(lcnc.r t-0 con:stant error. The report of l\fr. Braid shows that there mts such tendency in the 1·ourse of forty-fire miles. Then the two lines coincide in results and alternately separate and approaeh until, at the twenty-sl~venth bench-mark, the,y differ by onl.r four millimeters; and at the forty-fourth hy onl,y one milliuwtt>r and seven-tenths. As determined hy computation, the probable error for the distance run (upwards of two hundred and three miles) is 18.2 millimet-0rs. During the latter part of the season the progress of work was much retarded by the tlomle1l condition of the countr~-. 1'revailing calm:s also caused delay, as the ·essHl could not. when desir_ able, be moved against the strong current of the river. l\1r. W. O. Ilodgkius was attached to th" party as aid, and served efficiently in the fiel(l and in office work. Forty-nine primary bench·marks were established and one hundred and forty-fonr suhsidiar,Y marks. ')'hf' work was continued until the end of l\Iay. Mr. Braid then reported at the office and engaged in computing the results of field observatious. The proba!Jle error for the entire distance run is less than one inch. Subassistant Braid bad been previousl;y emploJ·etl in Section XIY, and mentiou of' his serdces in the field will be stated nuder that bead. Between J\lilliken's Bend and Greenville, lines of Im·el were run by .Assistant 0. II. Tittma mt and Subassistant .T. B. ·weir. This work was begun in ,Tauuary and closed in 1\la~·, 11-!SO. The distance traversed with the instrument is one hundred and four miles, and in tllat- rnnge one hundred aud eighty-eight bench-marks were set.

Hydroyraphy, coast of Te.ra8.-In December, 18i9. Lieut. Uriel Sehree, U.S. N., AssiHt.aut in the Coast and Geodetic Sur,'ey, took charge of the steamer Gedney, and after refitting the rnssel left New· York iiro,-ided with prctlections for prosecuting ~;oundings along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the vicinity of Corpus Christi. After settfog up siguals the hyrlrograph,y was taken up at a point' teu mih~s west of Cavallo Pass) lJLLt by reason of bad weather sounding·s advance<l slowly. .A.t such intervals signals were erected on the sand hills of Matagorda Island, Saint Joseph:s lslantl, ~1us tang h1aml. arnl Pa.dre Ishrnd; but by the 2:{d of .June the Gulf shore was sounded to a poiut eight mileR t-1onth of Corpus Christi Pass. In general, the signals were YisiJJle at distances of from seven to ten miles oft' shore. He~1 ornl, ancl out to an average distance of fifteen wiles from the beach, tlte lines were run uy eourses aucl disfances. From the three-fathom cun-e inward short lines about three miles apart were rnn iu boatR to tl1e edge of the breakers. .A line parallel to the beach was run h,r the steamer iu from two and a half to three fathoms of water, in·oving, as has been found heretofo1·c, that the bottom slopes grad11ally to a depth of about fifteen fathoms at :fifteen miles from the beach. Two lines of soundings run across the bar at Corpus Christi Pass showed a depth of five feet at mean low water. The channel is about two hundred yards wide. While sounding" were in progre:;;s tl1e tides were recorded at De<;ros }loint, inside of Oava1lo Pass. The ri:-1e and fall is less than one foot, ancl the water level, as at other places on the coast of Tex.as, is greatly afi'ectecl by win<ls. Lieutenant Selm:>A~ says in regard to tl1e currents: "At times the current would oo iu one !lirection close inshore, and three hours afterward, in the opposite direction, at the end of a line of soundings. After a strong northeast or easterly blow the current sometimes sets for days at a time to the southwest at a rate of one to two knots per hour." The statistics of the h,Ydrograpby are :

Early in .fannary, Lieutenant Ackley reaehcfl the Tortugas, and there passed thref' days in recording magnetic ohsernttiow:.. Passing on westwanl, he made similar records at Alacrau Reef, arnl a partial series at Cay Arenas. On read.ting Tampico the weather and coudition of the bar were such tlrnt, the n~ssel could not enter, aud tl1e same uufayorable circumstances made it impracticable t<i reconl ohserrn,tious, a11 intended, at Santander and Tuxp:m.

Tidal observatfons.-With ~1 self.registering tide gauge furnished from the office in 'Yasllingt-On, a series of observations was commenced at l\fazatlan, on the west coast of Mexico, in .Tnly. 1819. The records since that time have been regularly receirnd from 11Ir. Fiacro Quijano~ cidl engineer, by whose aids the results have been tab11lated monthl,r. The records give promise of speeial YalnP. Suri·ey of Sati Nicola,s Island, Cal.-For the survey of this island, the party of ,\Ksistant. Stehman Forney was organized on the 1st of July, 1879, at Santa Barbara. Lieut. E. H. C. J,cutze received the party and instruments on board the steamer }foArtlrnr nnd without delay reached Corral Harbor, a small indentation on the north side of San Nicolas. After landing, Mr. Forney commenced the topographical sun·ey, and prosecuted the supplementary triangulation needful in that work. He also erected and determined in position all the signals required by the hydrographic party, and reset the ground marks at the triangulation points occupied some years ago. In the course of the season, as opportunity offered, angular measurements were reoorded at two stations for determining the position of Begg Rock, which lies about nine miles westward of the island. The roek is frequently obscured by fog, and unfortunately was

so at times when tlw signal on Sanbi Barbara Island came into view; the position of the rock, howe,·er, was well checked by additional measurements in the course of tlie plane-table survey. Tlw detailed topographical work on San Nicolas was completed ou the rnth of September. A few days after thP party was lauded at Santa Barbara by the steamer McArthur. The island is thus rpferred to in the field report: "Sau Xieolas is the most distant of the channel islands from thfl coast. It is nearl,y nine milel' long, averages two and a half miles in widtl1, aud is eight hundred and eighty feet high, flat on top, with precipitous sides composed of coarse sandstone. About two-thirds of the surface is eowred with Raud, and the remainder with wild gTasses like the vegetation of the mainland. Small patches of seruh oak are found in a few remote parts of tl1e island. ''San Nieolas, like San Miguel, is coYered with Indian graveR and shell mounds. It is well supplied with springR of slightly hrackish water. The onl~· good boat landing is at Corral Harbor, a little hasio with sixty feet of water at the northwest en<l of tl1e island.'' .For use in the plane-table sun~ and the adjacent hydrography, Astdstaut Forney erected and determined in position seveaty-seven signals, exclusive of thirteen used in his triangulation.

Of the outlying island8 1 all the appro.lChel-l to Santa Catalina aml the south approach to Sau Clemente were sounded by Commander Cofliu, at state1l in my last annual report. At the opening of the fiscal year the work requisite for completing the b;plrography of the vicinity of the outlying iRlarnh1 was assigned to Lieut. E. H. 0. Leutze, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Sur\·ey.

As soon as practicable, Lieutenant Leutze set up four signals on the north sidP of San Clemente, located two points carefully, and had tidal observations recorded at Catalina Harbor. Soundings along tlle north side of San Clemente were completed by tbe 23ll of Jul.r. The resultiug sheet shows depths ranging from six feet to six hundred and forty-five fathoms. For the adjustment of soundings in the vicinity of &n Nicolas Islaml, the tides were obsen·ed at Corral Harbor while hydrographic operations were in progress. Tbe projection which takes in Begg'is Rock was filled witb soundings by the 18th of September, and the development shows depths rang'ing from two feet to three hundred and forty fathoms. Assistant Forney having completed the plane-table survey, his party was again received on board the l\fcArthur and retumed to the mainland. For the hydrography around Santa Barbara Island seven signals were erecred and as many points determined in geographical position. The tides were observed at a station in Prisoner's Harbor on Santa Cruz faland, and soundings in all tlte approaches to Santa Barbara Island were completed hy the middle of October. On the resulting chart the depths range from thirteen feet to one hundred and seventy-eight fathoirns. Next in orrler of date, work was taken up along the eoast south of San Luis Obispo. Ten signals were set up and determined in position; tides were recorded at Gaviota wharf, and b.r the

PrimAtr.lf trian.qulatio11.-For compll'ting ohservation8 at the t\astcrn lc'tHl of tbe great quarlriJateral which so appropriately bears his name, J>rof.

The route to the la.11t-named station was greatly impeded by snow until late in June. "l\fount J;ola is about tweke mill's north-northeast of Summit Station, on the Central Pacific Railroad, and is not specially di><tinguishahle for ele·ation. It is on the main crest line of the Sierra Nevada, antl ma.,y be n~ached from the ea"tward hy several ways; but going b;y wa.,r of LakP lndependen~ the party had only fourteen miles of teaming in a rise of tweke hundred feet. The summit was reached by packing and sledding fiye miles and a half O\'Cl' sno1v-, with a rise of about
twenty-eight hundred feet.'' Much difficulty was encountered in consequenmi of drift:;;, but the party was thoroughly efti. cient and met all impediments successfully. 'Yhile .Assistant ,l. ,J. Gilbert and Subassista11t E. .F. Dickins advanced towards the 8tation with tbe. instruments and needful equipage, Assistaut B. A. Colonna was detailed hy Professor Davidson t-0 post heliotropers at Mount Helena, Snow .'.\fount. Mount Linn, and Marysville Butte. At the same time, Subassistant J. F. Pratt was Acnt to Atatio11 heliotropers at Mount Diablo, Pine Hill, and faissen's Butte. Near the last-name<l Htation the snow was very deep, but Mr. Pratt succeeded in reaching it and posting the 11and engaµl~11 as heliotroper. Much hardship was incurred in reaching Mount Lola, on account of snow and eold air. ( lflkers, men, and animals sank in the snow to their knees, and all were seyerel,r trie1l in the ascent, which of necessity was done afoot in a rare atmosphere. Assistant. Dan<lson went to the summit on the 9th of June, and then encountered a flurry of snow and found the tcmpemture below the freezing point. As soon as possible, a space was cleared by the remo1al of detached rocks, and a pier was constructed by using cement. This was properly capped to receive the theodolit.e, and

was marked for identifying the station point. Jn lieu of a wooden observatory, Assistant Davidson trusted to his canvas tent, aml protecterl it by a heavy dry wall of stone which broke the force of mauy fierce winds in tlrn course of tlw season. \Vhen the pier was read,y, Suliassistant Dickins was sent to post 11eliotropcrs at, Chm1011 Cone arnl Pah-Rah. Snhassistant Pratt wail detailed to proceed to Hound Top and report upon the best 111eans of reaching that summit and in regard to the subsist(·11ce of tlw party whilt> there. ProfessOl' Drwillson sclecterl an azimuth mark somewhat more th~m frw· miles distant from :Mount Lohl. and in 80 doing guarded as far as possible against the effect of hori:wntal n~fractiou. After mounting the tlrnorlolire, observations for horizontal tlirections were commenced without 1lela.v, am1 while thn:;e "nrP coutlticted by Assistant Davidson hrn piers were built by Assistants Colonna and Gilbert for 1he transit and zenith telescope. The foundations were 9f rock laiu in cement; the superstrueture of lirick capped with a fiat stone. The vertical circle was monnt~d on a very heavy block of pine. and another block was arrangetl to receive the magnetometer.. For horizontal directions alHl :tziumth, the twenty-inch theodolite No.115 was mount,ed 011 tl1e ca8t-iron repeatiug st:md devhwd h,Y A>lsistaut Davidson in 1870. Observations were recorded in twenty. three position:;; of the limb of tl1e in;;trument, and the readings were made by three micrometer microscope;; with eirele, direct aud ren:r:sed, upon two hnndi:ed and seventy-six different g·raduations (of fin: minutes each) npou the limb. Assistant ua,·idson, having stationetl Assifltant Colonna at Mount Shasta, succeeded in measuring two angles in the great triangle J,ola-Shasta-Helena, having sides of one hundred ancl thirtysix, one hnmlred and sixty-niw~, and mw lrnmlred aml ninety-two miles. Under a subsequent heading, mention will be made of tlw operations upon Sha;;ta. On the :!fltlt of ,July, l\Ir. Davidson saw the heliotrope shown from 1hat station, and obse1Tcd npou it in Ji ye po;:;itiom1 of the theodolitf~ at Lola. Vurtlter te1<ts Wc>l'f' rnarle there for the determination of azimuth hy the use of a collimator, but the results sern~d only to establish the conclusion reach eel preyioni;;l~·, and reported by Professor Davidson, "tl1nt the eollima1or, to hP effi>ctin\ m11st he upon the same rock, or upon a pier conneeted in solirlit,v with tl1c> pier· of the tl1em1olit1»'' 'l'hel'\e conditions were impracticable at Mount Lola. For ~Lzimuth, As;;i:;tant I»lYidso11 observed ou tl1e two sbm.;, " L'rsa· .Minoris at miste.rn elongation, and upon 13. A. C. 416i"i at western elongation, in the twenty-three positions of the instrument. The observations were referred to the azimuth mark and also to the eollimntor. 'Vhile this work was in progress Suhassistant Dickins kept tbe record. The latitmfo ohsen·ations, and partly those for time, were made by Assistant Colonna, with zenith telescope No. 3. Twent~·-five 1)airs of stars were obserYed through seven nights, ancl the usual reconl >vas made for determining the value of the micronwter screw, and for measuring the irregularity of each turn. Aft-0r tlie departure of l\fr. Colonna for }fount Shasta, time observations with the transit were continued by l\lr. Gilbert. In the measurement of vertical augles fnll seriel-l were recorded at :Mount Lola upon all the signals in view, one of them being one hundred and sixty· nine miles distant. Jfaguetic observations were made at tlte summit, but, as remarked in the field report, they are to be con8iderell only a tentative for absolute measures. Later in the season, Professor Davidson set up the theodolite magnetometer at I,ake Itulependence, whieh is tweuty.011e hundred feet below the summit of Mount l.1ola, and there l\lr. Dickins observed for the magnetic declination during one da~·, while Assistaut Davidson ohsern·tl for time and azimuth. Dense smoke in the Sacra· ment,o \'alley rntardcd operation:s at l\1ount Lola~ but, pending the delay, a topographical reconnaiKsance of the mountain was made by Subassista.ut Dickins. :For tlte resulting map, Assistant Davidson selected and measured a base, and made sketches of the characteristic features. Subsequently photographic views were semll"ed of important points to the southward and eastward, in which directions smoke 1litl T1ot interfere as it did in other tlirectiomi. :Meteorological observations were recordetl at I1ola in ,July, and in Augn11t and September at Round Toil. As before stated, tlie heliotrope on Mount Shasta was seen on the 29th of July, when all the baggage on Lola was already packed for the transfer to Round Top. There llr. Pratt provided huts by the 9th of August, and had located a wagon road to the lower camp, as also a trail to the observing point

There the 11ier for tlrn large t11eodolite was built by Subassistant l'ratt himself, of loose rocks at th(· ;mrnmit, which he laid in ce1rn~ut. As before, tl1e instrument was motrnteil on Mr. DaYidsou's east-iron '' poRition circle." The litth· wooden observatory, eight feet sqnare, was protected from l1lmri11g away by a hea\). dry wall of rocks, and holes; with iili<les were cut in the li11es leadiu~ to the different RtMions.

In regard to some of tlw details of arrangement in the apparatus, jmlidous s<<ggestious were made by Assi;;ta.nt DaYid!'lon, and these will be adopted in its fabrication. }fr. George Farquhar, long attached to the service, aud iu latter years ou duty in the sub-office at San Francisco, died in that city on the 26th of .April, 1880, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He was entered at the office of the Survey in 18ii0 as hydrographic draughtsman, and the many maum1cript charts completed by him eviuce skill and nicety in details. After serving in a hydro~raphic party on the coast of North Carolina, Mr. l<~arqulrnr wat-1 transferred to the Pacific coa;;t in 1853, and was there in service with several 11arties. He was conscientious in the performance of duty afloat and in the sub-office, fo which, within the last few years, his labors were restricted in consequence of failing health. During his last illness the unselfish care and constant sympathy of Assistant Colonna did all that was possible to mitigate the circumstances that attended the last hours of the 11eccasetl. Reoonnaissance.-In order to perfect the plan of triangulation to go north and south of the llavidson quadrilate.ral, AsRistant L. A. Sengteller was <tssigned to the field early in the fiscal year for examiniug the region south of Mount Diablo ancl Round Top. In succession he visited theftrstnamed statiou, and also l\Iount Hamilton, Mount Macho, and other peaks in that vicinity. Subse. quently l\Ir. Sengteller passed .a day on. the summit of Round Top with a view of identifying points to the southward. Ile reached the summit of l\lount Dana on the morning of the 3d of Angust, 1879,· and imsserl the day iu transmitting signals towards Round Top, but received none in return. His si[,,rnals from Mount Hoffman were seen at Round Top, but the view to the southward and westward was obstructed by high neighboring mountains.

In the middle of .August, l\fr. Sengteller conferred personally with Assistant Davidson at Round Top, and started immediately to post lteliotropers at )fount :Macho and Mount Conness. Signals from the last named station were first seen at Round Top on the 4th of September. A week later Mr. Sengteller conferred with .Assistant Jfonheck, who was then working at a primary station to the eastward, in regard to the connection of Cory's Peak with stations to the southward. It is confidently believe<l that the difficulties met in laying out a 1-lclrnme of triangles with long lines in that direction will soon be overcome. '.l'he work done by Assistant 8engteller after closing the reconnaissance will be stated under a separate head. Sper:ial topof!raphy.-In pursuance of the arraugement me11tioned in my report of last year for procuring types on or near the Pacific coast of the United States for the manual of topography, Assistant Edwin Hergesheimer commenced a plane·table survey of the moraines of :Fallen Leaf Lake on the 20th of .July, 1879. His t-Opographical sheet, completed early in Oetober, shows in elaborate detail about twenty square miles, and is aecompanied by views. Fallen Leaf Lake is iu California, and about two miles south of Lake Tahoe, whicll lies partly in tl1a,t State and iiartly in Nevada. In allusion to the surface contours of tlte region, Mr. Hergesheimer remarks: "Perhaps nowhere on t.he American continent are topographical features determined on so grand a scale by glacial drift as at the south end of Lake Tahoe, which is near the summit of the Sierra Nevada. Here at the confluence of four streams of the glacial period are found lateral and medial moraines four and fi\'C miles in length, a thousand feet lligh, and apparently undisturbed since the- moving ice-streams deposited their cargoes of drift. The conditions tSeem to have been favorable for preserving them in their original forms. Precipitation of moisture is nearly all in winter as snow, which disappears gradually under the action of t11e snn as summer adyauces. Hence no torrents are formed greater than can be readily absorbed by the porous structure of the bowlder-built moraines.'' Ou the completion of the survey before mentioned, Mr. Hergesheimer crossed the Sierra Nevada range by way of Silver Mountain Pass to Tnble J\lou11tai11, ll('ar Sonora, where i8 found orw of the finest samples of deep placer formation known 011 the Pacific slope. Of tl1at he sa;\-s: "By successin.· lam overflow and erosion the entire western slope of the Sierra Nerndas has undergone radical topographical changes. The beds of former streams are 110\Y filled wiU1 lava, which from it~ greater thickness in the deepest Yalleys longest resists erosion; and, finall_r, after the degradation of early summits these beds become the mountain t-0ps. This sho\\s plainly in a basaltic table about thirty miles long (from Columbia to Knight's Ferr~-) known as 'ftthle ~fountain, under the lavn of which is found, in the former river bed, anriferous gravel, often very rich.'' At a point ahont three miles west of Sonora, Mr. Hergeshcimer .selected a section of Tabfo Mountain including about two square miles as characteristic of the deep placer formation, and made a minute survey wit.h a view to accompany the 111ap. ThiR work was completed on the 8th of November. The next locality mapped was the headland of Montara Mountain, on the coast below San Fran cisco, which affords a subject of marine erosion. A view drawn to illustrate the topography of the headland proved that the survey by Assistant A. F. Rodgers truly delineated the characteristics of the place. The tables along the coast near Santa Cruz, supposed t-0 be former sea leYels, were next examined, and views were drawn. "\"Vhile in that vicinity, Mr. Hcrgesheimcr made a careful snrwy of the peculiar aIToyo character of the erosion of the soft sedimentary strata. of that region with accompanying views. Late in Deeember he examined the supposed former sea levels or beaches at Point San Pedro, determined their height, and took views of the locality. In January, 18801 Mr. Hergesheimer returned to Washington to resunw office work upon maps and views for the topographical manual. Tidal observations.-In J<'ebruary, 1877, Prof. George Davidson, .Assistant in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, established at Saucelito the self-registering tide gauge, which has since that date been kept in operation by Mr. E. Gray. The indications are that the series will be one of the best as yet recorded on the Pacific Mast.

Early in Octobex~ 1879, a camp was established about midway in the range of the work, and from that station points were in succesHion determined to perfect the tertiar'J' triangulation bdween Bodega Bay an<l the 11orth limit of the work of tlw ~eason. The junction was effected at W alalla River. On tlw nth of Sonmiher, .Assh;tnnt SengtellN rt>snmeil plane-talJJe work upon the topographieal sheet wlticli he had comrneneed iu the preceding season.

From thl' two statious the distances to Shasta were approximately one hundred anu sixty-nine aml one lmndred and ninet.r-two miles. The liue joining the two stations was one hundred and thirty-six miles in length. The de:;irahle result just 111entio11ed was effectell by the stt·a11y 1·1Hlurauc1~ of Assistant B. A. Colonna, who passed uiue days arnl aights on the summit of Shasta, the eleYatiou of whieh is fourteen thousand four hundred fet>t ahorn the sea lewl. Dnring th(· ascent, and while cin tlw summit, many collateral ohserrntions of interest were reconlml and returned in the field report. At an eleYation of about ten thousand feet, 1mow, white at the surface, was fonnd to he rl'<l at a depth of two inches. The coloring matter ex:tendNl to a depth of three inches, and a haudful of the fungi, after 1n·a.porati11g thP sumY, had a decidedly fruity taste. .From this elcvatiou l\Ir. Colonna, accompanied hy two men, starteil for the top of the mountain on tlie 25th of ,Jnl;r. 187tl. The instruments and requisite provisions were taken up iu parcels h;y Indians hired for tl.ie occ!l· sion. Loose howlrlers that wonlil start down with a mere touch made the steep asce11t somewhat d:mgerous, hut accidents from such causes were carefully aYoHled. Under a steep wall of pumice, called ''Red Bluff," as seen from the \'alley, the party, at the height of thirteen thousaud feet, passed over a snow drift, part of whieh adjacent to the rock had melted, lea,·ing a narrow chasm of which no bottom could be seen. There the rarefied air affected respiration, lmt br frequent halts this part of the journey was passed in safety, and at noon the partj reached the hot springs, two hundred and fifteen feet below the summit of Shasta. All the carriers returned immediately to tlw valley. The two men retained by Assistant Colonna aided him in pitching a tent, but before night one of the men was taken ill and next morning went down the mountain and did not return. Tile record sliows that after dark tl1e thermomlc'ter stood at 30°. As described by l\fr. Colonna, the summit of Shasta consists of two peaks, about two hn11dre1l yards apart, one of them towards the northeast 1Jeing ·about fifty feet higher than the other. Tlw hot springs are in the valley between the two peaks, dotted over an area of nearl,\· twpnty ,Ynnhi square, and they constantly emit steam impregnated with sulphnrete.d hydrogen and other gases. Assistant Colonna found the tempera.ture of the water 1840, which, considering th(· C'lcrntioni i8 perhaps equal t-0 the normal boiling point at sea level. The adjacent surface is a crust made up of loose earth and small stones cemented with sulphur, alum, and other substances. At one Jllaee the crust when broken through disclosed a cavern from which steam came out iu great rnlumes; and from another break the steam was emitted as a small jet with a hissing sound like that cau;;etl by a locomotive. It was noticed that, although the temperature did not cha11ge, itll the springs were ::::J.ore active on some days than on others. Assistant Davidson had arranged for showing heliotropes, from the two stations Helena and Lola, of the great quadrilateral, but inteneniug smoke hid them from view at Shasta until the 29th of July, when, at 5h 45m a. m., Mr. Colonna "saw the Lola heliotrope for a secoud or tvo dark red,

44

but it went before a pointing could be recorded. Helena was not seen until the 1st of August, and then four sets of six repetitious were measured. The same measures were repeated next day, but on the 3d Helena was not visible.'' The line from Helena to Shasta (one hundred and ninety-two miles) is the longest yet included in geodet,ic work. As before stated, Assistant Davidson observed on the Shasta heliotrope both from Mount Lola and Helena. 'rhe experience of many tourists who have ascended Mount Shasta proves that few men could endure even the temporary sqjourn of nine days and nights at SUl'.h elevation. Assistant Colonna retained bis appetite and wa>: amply supplied with provisions, yet ltis weight was lessened fifteen pounds hy the sta,v on the mountain. He experienced no difficuh;y in breathing, but noticed that by a little exertiou tl1e pulse rapidly increased, going as high as one hundred anrl twenty, though in repose at the summit it ranged from ninety to one hundred. During his stay the highest temperature olJser\'ed was fi7°, when at the same time the thermometer in tlic valley marked 1000 in the shade. At four o'clock in the afternoon ice would form in the sun, anrl at sundown the thermometer was generally at 250. The coldest temperature recorded at the summit wai; 180. With strong winds the temperature inmeaserl as though warm air bad been thereby forced up the side of the mountain. After visiting the Whitney glacier and making many collateral obserrntions at other points on Shasta, Assistant Colonna left the station and reached San Francisco on the 9th of August. Tidal observations.-The series of tidal observations commenced in .June, 1877, near the entrance to the harbor of Honolulu, urnler the direction of Mr. W. D. Alexander, superintendent of the surrny of tlie Sand wicb I.~lands~ has been conti11ued. Records from the beginning aml 1lown to the 18th of February, J8SO, have bt>en received and filed at the office in \Vashiugtou. As ht>retofore mentioned, the gauge in use at Elouolulu was lent from this office on condition that the registers should be furnished for comparison between the tides there and the tides of the Pacific coast of the United States.

'1.'opograpli,IJ of Columlifr1 River.-At the opening of the fiscal year, Assistant Cleveland Rockwell was again assigned to continue th(· Rnrvey of the banks of the Columbia. The sheet projected includes the course of the river between Kalama and Columbia City, and as returned to the office shows more than tlic usual proportion of intricate details within a sketch of rather more than eight miles. Both banks of the river were carefully mapped in contour, and an the islands are represented, as well as the streams that make into the Columbia . .Field work by this party was continued until the 8th of December, 1879, when the sloop Kincheloe, which had served for transportation and quarters, was moored for the winter at the mouth of Kalama River in a position secure from floating ice. The party was then discharged and Mr. Rockwell engaged in office work. A synopsis appended to the field report shows in statistics:

Triangulation mid topography, Puget Bound, W. T.-At the opening of the fiscal year, Subassistant Eugene Ellicott entered u1·on the triangulation of Hamrnersley's Inlet, and completed that work early in August, 1879. In August, the shore lines were traced of the lower part of Hart. stein's Island, the shores of Squaxin Island, part of the shores of Totten Inlet, and the cast side of the north end of Case's Inlet. The shores of llammersley's Inlet and Skookum Inlet were surveyed in September, and l\Ir. Ellicott furnished tracings of the sheets to Lieuoonant Wyckoff, whose party was then engaged in sounding the upper waters of Puget Sound. The topographical work was much retarded by high tides.

Base line near Louisril/11, liy.-Beforn retiriug· from U1e charge of geodetie operations in Ken-

Prof. Wm. Byrd Page selected a site for a base line, the north en<l of which is abont four miles southwe8t, of Loni:wille. From that euJ the liIJe extends southward, and, as marked in the reconnaissance, was about six miles iu length. From Cumberland Gap the triangulation had been previously extended across the State of Kentucks towards Louis,·me, and in Indiana a scllerne has been since laid out t-0 pa8:s :southward towards the same point. The base line and triangles in immetliate connection with it were therefore adjusted so as to meet geodetic requirements in the two States. At the opening of the present fiscal year Assistant G. A. !<'airfield was directed to proceed to Louisville and measure the. base line. After full examination it was found that better connections could he made h~· shortening the site, and as Ihuch of it passed over cultivated ground, Mr. Fairfielll arnided the expense aml labor of grading the site by using trestles for sustaining the measuring bars. As shortened, the line is rather more than five miles long, the final record of measurement giving for its length 8,188.055 meters. Jn measuring, the tripods belonging t.-0 the apparatus were employed where the ground was nearly level, hnt on approaching a slope trestles were brought into requisition. These were placed four feet apart, and were continued down the slope until they were high enough from the ground to admit of the bars being run from them again to tlie ordinary tripods used with the measuring bars. The trestles were made by planks sixteen feet long resting on stubs driven firmly into the ground and adjusted in height so as to maintain continuity in the slope. Ditches and small creeks were crossed by driving in and bracing longer stubs to secure their stability, but in no case was it found necessary to use more than four of the plank trestles in succession. The mea.~urement of the line was begun on the 15th of September, 1879, and was completed in ten consecutive working days. Remeasurement of the line early in October proved to be in close accord with the result first obtained. After erecting signals in geodetic connection with the base, Assistant Fairfield occupied the stations at both ends of the base line. He was aided during the season by Messrs. Carlisle Terry, jr., and Isaac Winst.-Ou. At the opening of the season the geodetic work was placed in charge of Prof. J. B. Hoeing1

but that obsen·er was constrained by illness to leave the field early iu July, 1879. His knowledge of tlie region in the vicinity of Iiouisville had been previously communicated t-0 Assistant Fairfield. At all favorable intenalR between the 2;111 of October and the 2801 of Novem her, the measurement of horizontal and Yertical angles was carried on, rt':;;ulting in tlie completion of the first quadrilateral connecting with the base line, and partial ohservation:;; in the Sf>(·.ornl and third quadrilaterals. On the 1st of September, 1879, l\ir. Carl Schenk reported to Assistaut Fairfield to take the place made vacant by the resignation of Professor Hoeing·. ~fr.

Assistant Edwin Smith, 011the18th of that month, started for Washington, and as soon as practicable estahlished au astronomical station at Louis\'ille, Ky. At the two stations details were adjusted as soon as possible, and longitude signals were exchanged between the observers on the night of the 29th of November. Signals were repeated on the 1st and on the 6th of December, intervening nights not being favorable for the exchanges. In order to eliminate personal errors of observation as far as possible, Messrs. Dean and Smith then exchanged places, the first passing fa) J,ouisville and the latter to NashYille. Between the 11th and 15th of December longitude signals were passed between the observers for completing the observations requisite for dete.rmining tlw Iongi tude of l1ouisville. Two days after closing at that station, Assistant Dean transferred his party to Atlanta, Ga., and there received signals from Assistant tlmith, who remained at NashYille. Successful observations were recorded on five nights lwtween the :!6th of December and the 1-!th of January. The subsequent operations of the party haYe been mentioned under the head::; of Section V and Section VIII. Observations for latitude were made by Mr. C.H. Sinclair, aid iu the part,Y of Assistant Smith, at the astronomical station in the grounds of the Louisville Unfrersitr. For longitude, sixty observations were recorded on 20 stars during the course of three nights, and at Nashville fifty-nine ohservat.ions in three nights in exchanges with Louisville, and eighty· six observations in exchangi11g with the observer at Athmta. Two sets of obserYations were recorder'! at Louisville for value of the micromet.er, and for latitude Rixty-two observations were recorded on seventeen pairs of stars in the course of six nights. At Louisville, in exchanging signals with the observer at Nashville, sixty observations were lnade on twenty stars during three nights, and in the same period fifty-nine observations were recorded at Nashville. Computations for the longitude of the station in that citr were made by

Mr. F. R. Parsons.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Geodetic operaiion.~.-In coutiuuatiou of the triangulation of Tennessee, Prof. A. H. Buchanan took the field at tlie opening of the fiscal year, and in July, 1879, occupied a station six miles south of the Lebanon base line. The position was chosen so as to admit of angular measurements on nine out-l~·ing stations. Northwartl of the base another station was occupied in the same month and from it horizoutal angles were measured on six other signals. In August an additional point was oceupied fo the westward of the base, and in connection with stations predously eccnpied and also with the capitol at Nashville. Twelve signals were observed on in the course of that month. A station on the State capitol was occupied in September, and angular measurements were recorded to connect that point with others in the vicinity of Lebanon base. About six: miles eastward of the line a station was occupied in October and during part of November. In the month last mentioned Professor Buchanan moved to a point a few miles westward of Lebanon, and continuecl the measurement of horizontal angles until the 29th of December. He resumed field work on the 14th of June, 1880, at the northern end of the Lehanon base, and when the :fiscal year closed he was engagt·d in perfecting the connection of the line with well chosen quadrilaterals. An abstract of the sfatistics is here given, as taken from the field report:

Geodetic levels.-The line of geodetic levels going westward in the vicinity of the thirty-ninth parallel was extended last season to a bench-mark at Athens, in Ohio, and there the work was resumed at the opening of the fiscal year by Subassistant Andrew Braiu. Following the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad to Cincinnati, and then the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, the party reaclled Mitchell, in Indiana, b~' the 10th of Novemher, and was there dh;banded. After his return to the office Mr. Braid was assigned t<J duty, of which mention will be made under the head of Section VIII in this report. In advancing the work to Athens, two lines were run simultaneously with the same instrument by observing on two sets of rods placed at different distances from the instrument. The two lines were brought together at each bench.mark so as to afford frequent comparison of results. In the operations of the present year the method was slight!J· changed. Instead of two lines observed at very nearly the same time and consequently under the same atmospheric conditions, alternate sections of the work were rnn by two lines in a forward or westerly direction, the intermediate sections being run also by two lines in the opposite direction. In this way two hundred and ninety miles of double line were run in the course of the present season, closing on a benci1-mark at l\litchell, similar to bench-marks placed at Athens, Chillicotlle, Loveland, Cincinnati, in Ohio, and at Lawrenceburg and Medora, in Indiana. At these places the marks were set with special care, and in all cases where practicable were placed on government or other public buildings. The secondary beucll-marks are more numerous, hut are also well marked, aud in addition many temporary bench-marks were set. All are described in the records turned in by Subassistant Braid. The notes of the field work of this season are comprised in thirty.four volumeio. Geodetfo operntiomJ iii Ohio.-Uooonnaissance for triangulation statiom1 in Ohio was resumed by Prof. It. S. Devol on the 1st of July, 18\9, and was prosecuted continuously until the 4th of October. The scheme of last year was first reviewed, resulting in improvement by the substitution of several points for others which had l>een provisionally selected. After careful examination it was found that in order to obtain lines averaging twelve miles in length tripods for elevating the theodolite would be requisite at eleven stations, and that in some instances lines of sight could not be had without cutting avenues through timber on hill tops or ridges near the stations most available for the extension of geodetic work. The scheme of work presented by Professor Devol

Primar.11 triw1gulatio11.-For continuing the primary triangulation in Colorado, .Assistant 0. II. Tit,trnann took tl.Je fiPld :1t tl.Je opening of the fiscal ~-ear, and, as soon as practicable, established his party near the eastern entl of the site seleeted for a base line. Until August 5, the time was occupied in tracing the proposed base line on the ground between the eastern and western ends, and in making prelimiuary measurements with a wire of known length. The contour of the ground was determined by meaus of the spirit-level, and ~nonuments were set up at the termini finally tlccidell upon. The line thus marked for measurement is somewhat more than seven miles in length. ". ork at the base site was completed on the 5th of September. In order to lessen the i1wouye11ie11ce arising from changes of temperature in the course of the day, Mr. Tittmann experimented hy measuring at uight, hut, after trial with the hands on two consecutive nights, he found no advantage as compared with tlw measurements by daylight. The length of the base was determined hy steel rods, and in their use due account was taken of temperature. Two measurements were made tmdPr dift'ereut conditions, yet tlie difference in length as thus determined proved to be Yery little more tlmn one inch. After completing the base measurement, signals were erected at the outlying stations on the plains by .Assistant Tittmaun, aided by Mr. J.B. Weir. At the eastern end of the Colorado base observations were recordell for latitude and azimuth. The astronomical station at Colorado Springs, and also the station at which the obserrntions were made b~' the United States Engineers, were connected with the triangulation previously laid out by l\lr. Tittmann. Later in the seasou the we.stem end of the base was occupied, and in November the station Corral Blu:tf in immediate connection from the southwar(l with the base. Two signals were erected west of Colorado Springs for connecting the astronomical station with the work now in progress..

The subsidiary obserrntions i11elnde all the principal mountain peaks in Yiew, and theRe lie within a belt about one hundred and fifty miles wide along the thirty-ninth parallel. In the comse of the season .Mount DaYidson, near Yirginia City, was determined in positio11, having been obseryed on in the previous season at Pal1-Rah, a primary statio11 to the northward of Genoa Corn.

DEAR Srn: In eomplia1we with your direction1-J of September, 1878, placing the computations of telegraphic longitudes in charge of the Computing Division of the office, I ha>e the honor to present a report 011 the present state of the computations and the aecnrary of the work, togrtl1er witl.t a tabular statement of tlH· results. As a fit'st step, it llecarue necessary to collect aud scrutinize the existing computations and talmlate tlie rrsnlts, rnnking, wliere necessary or desiraLle, new comhiuatious, and supplying as

far as possible any neetlfnl i11formaliou for greater completeue;;s of statement which the ca::ie srcrnetl to demand. Next, complete ahstracts of the indiYidual results of each determinatiou were made. 'fltes(, are lH'Cl·ss:trily din·1·,.;iliPd iu Uwir statements, depending maiul;y on the tt>legrapbic method employ et.I and tlte greater or lei>S refinements introduced by th<.'. observers. The1'e a hstracts were, for the sake of convenienre, dh-ided into two groups: the first comprising tl1e more important, the second the subordinate. stl1tions. Of the former there are SO, antl of the latter 47, determinations of differences of longitnde, nlltaiued hy means of the electric telegraph. The following will serve as a specimen of abstract of the tirst class, though man~~ are of a more elahoratP character:

These abstracts may lte made the hasis for a future publication of our i·es111ts, but they are too bulky to be appended t-0 this report; therefore the results onl,r of the determinations are herewith gi\reu. They are arrauged in cllrouological order. It has been tl10ught best, for a complete understanding and as a matt<>r of inten-,st from a historical point of view, to preface the table of resulting longitudes with a brief review of certain facts bearing on the gradual de,·elopment in our survey of tlrn use of tht· telegraph for purposes of lougitudes, and to indicate under whose charge the work has been carried on since its first conception and the demonstration of' its practical feasilJillty. fo the autumn of 184h, Hnperintendent Alexander l>. Bache issued instructions to Assistant Sears C. \\'alker for the purpose of determining geographical longitudes by means of the electric telegraph. Tlw first published notice bJ· the Supt>rinteudent for the use of the electric telegraph for gemletic pmposes is found in Coast Survey Report of 18461 p. 32; also in Appendix No. 11, p. 72. The first. difference of longitude actually determined, and comparing in accuracy with astronomical methods then in use, was on October 10, 1840, between \Yashington and Philadelphia. The co-operation of tht· Supnintendent of thr United Stat.es Naval Observatory having been secured, the Coast Survey built a telegraphic line connecting the telegraph office in thil'! city with the Naval OLservatory; also caused a connection to be made at Philadelphia with the (old) High School Obserrntorr. I·'or the histor.' of the .'luhject, see Astronomische Nachrichteu, No. 632, letter by A. D. Bache, of }'t:ibruary 7, 1848, pp. 119-12fi, and No. 666, letter by A. D. Bache, of December 26, 1848, pp. 27:~27tl. The field antl office work connectt-d with the determination of longitudes hy the electric telegraph was placed by Snperintt>ndeut A. D. Bache under the especial charge of Prof. S. C. Walker, Assistant in tlw Coast Survey from 1845 t-0 1852, when illness compelled him to 1·etire from active work· (see Coast Survey H<jport of 18.J:~, p. IHG, also earlier reports). In Decemher, 1852, Dr. Benjamin A. Gould, jr., assistant, was appointed to take charge of the telegraphic Iongitmles, and continued till 18ffi, when he resigned {Sf>e Coast Survey Report of 18537 p. 86, and of 1867, Appendix No. 6, pp. 57-133).

LoYering, l\Iemoirs of the American Academy, January, 1873. A complete exposition of our telegraphic uwthod, as practiced at the time, is contained in Ohau1enet's Manual of Spherical and Practical Astronom~-, Vol. r, Pl1iladel1)hia, 1863. In preparing the abstract of results, the above publications ha Ye been consulted. Respecting the r;pecial methods employed in the tdegrapbic longitude work and the combina· tion of results, I beg leave to Eoinhmit the following remarks: In bis report to the Superintendent, of November 10, 1847, Professor Walker points out that the alternation of obse1Ters 1ft, the stationfi would eliminate from the result the effect of their personal equation (provirled the same remained constant during the operation). This important suggestion, however, was not put in practirn until 1854. This apparent tardiuesR may he explained by the fact that in the t·ar1ier years of the application of the telegraph t-0 longitudes the difficulties to he oYercome in exehangi11g signal" wpre very great, the length of time required for completing a difte.rence of longitude was gn'at and extremely uncertain, and the cost proportionally large; hence the dirPct determiuation of the 1wrsonal equation betwern the observers was preferred to their exchauge of stations. lit the infancy of the telegraphic method the chief difficulty and consequent loss of time had its origin in thP nry imperfect insulation of the line-wires, combined with a hwk of scnsitfrenesR of the telegraphic receiving iustruments. We -can also readily aecount for the circumstance that in tbe earlier operations for telegraphic longitudes there are so fow independent checks. At that period, when t!tc purel;\· astronomical nontelegraphic longitudes, eYen of principal placeis, were wry uueertain, it was ohYiously of more

J\lodifications and weightH were introduced to snit Hpecial circmuHtauces. In many instances tlw resulting probable error rests necessaril~- (either from the want of sufticient <lata, or in unimportant cases even from want of any) on a ver~· slender basis. Tlte theoreticall_v perfect but practically hea\·y metlwtl, both as regards obseniug awl com· puti11g, of t·xchange of indhidnal star transits, which was used almost from the begiuuing, was ~mp· plemente1l in April, 1860, by the equally precise and short method of automatic exchangeis of clock· beatH (hreak,.;): this ekgant method t soon supplanted the older methodR, a.nd bas only of late (in 187!1) uuderg'OlH' a further simplification hJ· lesse11il1p; the number of threads or, rather, lines on the transit telescopf', gfass diaphragms of 11 lines being now cousiilen·d as eftectin1 as the 25 (and more receutl,Y Li) threads of former ;yea.rs. This nrnteria11~· diminis}ws tlw lahor of reading off the chronograph sheets an<l of the computation. lH prPseuting the table of results, indeed throughout this pa]ler, the differences of longitude are given i11 the se.rnw of western minm; ea.~tern station; hence the JJumhers expressing- this differencP requirr no special sign, they being all positive, and the mere naming of the stations carries this informatiou with it, the one first named being always tlie icestern one. The exact point of reference 1 a yery important matter, is carefully attended to, a special column having been introduced in the accompanying table of resnlts. Generally the reference is to the transit instrument (tr.), but at iixe1l olmerrntories, where, not unfrequently, difierent localities (sometimes in the building, sometimes i11 th~· grounds surrounding it) were used at difiemnt times, all positions and results were reforr<·d to the meridian passing through the center of the dome, the transit circlP, or other speeial local merhliau, as the case may be. .A star prefixed to any tnbular result indicates that a note referring- to it is appeutled to the table. In general where in the first table no probable errors are gh-en, the result depends on a first or field computation alone, and consequently is not final. The names of the obserYers are given; persons in special charge of' the \\'Ork or directors of obserya. tories, if not jftnally taking part in the obsen'ations, have their names i11closed within [ ].

Of the nearly 100 results, which at present may be accepted as final, there ma;y be somc> which it would seem desirable to re-examine or re-deduce, yet the clurnge "-oulrl 1wobalJly be so small that we would hanll,Y lw wanan tcd in 1·xpendi11g the labor.

For the direct and imnwdiatP use of the Surn·y we rwctl to combine the preceding results, and to disperse hy the method ofleast. 11quares all discrepancies existing between the results by Yarious eombinations. Two different solutions are open for mm, t leading· of course to the same results. "Whether one or the other is more a<lvantageous will mainly depe]l(l on the relatiYe proportion of tLr numberii of differences of longitude, arnl the number of combinations or conditions between them. Let l =number of determinations of differences of longitude; .~ = 1rnmher of longitmle statious i1n-oh'etl; c = uumher of conditional equatiorn; lletween them, then

The fin;1 nsr of all intensified light for geodPtic purposes occurred, so far as I can tliscon·r, in the progrrss of tlw ordnanet> surny oYer Ireland, when a" Drummmul'' or calcium light was use1l hy Colonel Cnlh,L llut his predecessor, Colonel Mudge, had used 10-iuch reflectors for tfo1taHces of :!4 statute miles (3:-1.fi lm11'.) as early as lrni. Colonel :Mudge says: "It was by the assistaHce of the white Jig·ht;-; on!~· that the most distant stations coulcl be rendr1·cd Yisible, and tliere cannot be n (loubt that in g-rcat operation::; of this sort tliey will be universally adopted hereafter." 8igwlls of arti1i<'ial light were large!~· used iu the trigonometrical survey of ludia, after 1s:m, and it is of interest to note the experience gainetl there in comparison \dth our own. LieutenantColouel EYeresL 1 who was snp11lied by 'l'roughton and Si.mms with two dozen reverberatory lamps, Arg:m11 humers (,;ee engraYing;-;, Plate 21, of volume of plates), makes tl1e following statement (p.

'From the conuncnccmcnt of the primary triangulation of the Coast Survey, up to he death of Mr. F. R. Hassler, the first Superintendent, in 1843, the Gauss heliotrope was used in primary tri. angulatio~ upon all long lines. Gradually, under the administration of his successor, Prof. A. D. Bache, the simpler forms of heliotrope, devised by officers and others of this Survey, were substituted arnl used extensh·ely, as the scope of the primary triangulation was gradually enlarged. In 1846, Professor Bache used, at Blue Hill, near Boston, an "optical collimator," conRislillg of a 10-inch object-lens, fitted in a sheet-iron tube, with a focus of about 3 feet. The lamp placed in its focus was made, if I remember rightly, of the Argand form, burning sperm-oil. It was placed at" Great Meadow" station, distaut 23.6 miles (38 kms.) from Blue Hill, and was intended for use in connection with azimuthal observations. But difficulties occurred in the way of rightly directing it and keeping it properly attended to, and the experiment was abandoned after a short trial. In the season of 1871 I occupied Rull n,nn Mountain, in .Fauquier Uounty, Yirginia, and was kept there more than twice the time usually required at a primar,y station, by the persistent ''smoke" or haze which prevented vision upon long lines. This "smoke" remained during a range of the thermometer of 50°, and nearly two inches difference of barometric Jffessnre, with the wirnl blowing from every quarter, and was specially dense and persistent with a cloudless sky. But I noticed that during westerly wind1-1 the haze or "smoke" settled at sunset, and before twilight ended our stations upon the mountain peaks of the Blue Ridge would appear in sharp and bold relief against the western horizon. It naturally occurred to me that by the use of night signals the time lost from the day might be redeemed at night. On bringing the matter to the notiee of the Superintendent (Prof. Benjamin Peirce), I wal'I authorized to inquire into and report upon some suitable form of night signals for use in the Coast Snrzey. In 1872 and 1873 I laid out, graclcd, and measured three times the Atlanta base, and occu11icd seven stations of the hase connections. These labors absorbed my whole time. In the fall of 1874 I tried the use of two 11 German student lamps," fitted to burn kerosene oil in the focus of an 8-incb paraboloid reflector. Owing, as I now think, to some failure in obtaining the right direction, the experiment did not then appear to succeed, and I came t~ the conclusion that an intensified light must be used. Of these there were three, all well known, Yiz, (1) the electric light, (2) the calcium or oxy-hyclrogen light, (3) the magnesium light. The necessary conditions of the problem I was trying to solve in finding a light for use in Coast Survey geodetic operations were: 1. That it should be cheap enough to be within our means. 2. That it should be capable of manipulation by uneducated persons of ordinary intelligence, like the mountaineers, of whom we usually made heliotropers. 3. That it should be light and small enough to be easily carried to the tops of high mountains, and should have simple adjustment. The sec.,"Ond and third of these conditions threw out both the electric and calcium lights, each of which requires a trained ancl educated person to manage it. The electric light also necessitates a battery and motive power of some sort, as well as a free use of water, not always easy of accesi; on mountains. The calcium light requires the transportation of apparatus for generation of the gases needed in its use, but may be managed and used with greater ease and at less e.xpense than the other. In February, 1875, I found for sale in New York an apparatus for burning two magnesium tapes in the focus of an eight-inch reflector, the tape being \lelivered by clockwork. It was of English make, bearing the name of J. Solomons, Ued Lion Square, London, and its price was $35. Its weight was only 5 pounds, and it could be readily carried in one hand. I saw that it contained the elementary conditions of what was wanted, and purchased it to experiment with. The drawback to its use was in the cost of the magnesium tape. This, at retai~ was $3 per ounce of 40 yards. -

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Experiment satis1ied me that one tube, burning one tape, gave all needed intensity, and, from correspondence with tl1e American :Magnesium Company, of Boston, I learned that it could be purchased by the pound for $36 or $2.25 per ounce of 40 yards. Continued experiment proved that a consumption of from 12 to 18 inches per minute of the tape, or an average of 15 inches, wouru. be required to maintain a brilliant and steady light. This at the above rate would make the lig11t cost 2k cents per minute, or $1.40 per hour, -to burn it steadily, Going back over my record of geodetic observations for two ;years, I fomid that the arnrage time for good seeing, when the atmosphere was snfficiently stead~' to admit of obserrntion, was, for morning and evening observations, rather less than two hours per day, wl1Pre the liues of bight averaged 25 miles (40.2 kms.) in length. Supposing the period after dark suitable for observation to be a8 long, each signal would cost about $3 per night, and if :five were ohRerYed, the cost would be $15 per night, au expense well worth incurring to insure two hours of steady observing. As regarded intensity, I had formPrly a large ex:perience of the intensity of the calcium light, during the time it was nightly burned on board the iron-clad frigate Nnw Ironsides, off Charleston, during the war. So far as I could compare the two, the magnesium light appeared equally bright. Feeling sure that the thing sought for had been found I so reported, and four more of tlie same lights were ordered by your direction. Delays occurred and they were not received and altered to adapt them for our use until too late in 1876 to enable me to test them during that season. On resuming wor~ in June, 1877, at. King's Mountain, in North Carolina, the 1irst practical test was made of the power of the light, and of the working of the machinery for deliYering the tape· '.l'he apparatus then appeared with the clockwork and reflector as purchased, and only changed by adding the reel and foot-screw, and a pointer under the middle of the reflector, to enable us to direct it properly. The light was shown by my assistant, "Mr. H. W. Blair, from the tower of Wofford College, in Spartanburg, S. C. 1 distant 39.1 miles (6~ kms.). The night was clear and the moon about one. quarter full. The magnesium light shown by Mr. Blair was at once visible t-0 the naked eye, showing nearly as large as the planet Jupiter. Our light at King's Mountain was also seen at once by Mr. Blair, who thereupon left for Paris Mountain, South Carolina, about 65 miles distant (1041 kms.), where he again showed bis light to us at King's )fouut~iin. It was again visible to the naked eye, while our light shown in return to )fr. Blair, anrl probably not so wp,ll din·cted, was plainly visible in the small telescope which he had with him. These experiments upon three nights satisfied me as to the degree of intensity attainable, which I felt sure would render the light visible in the telescope o\·cr the longest side of any triangle which the character of the country would permit m; to obtam. It was not until Ocwber of the same year that I was able to carry out arrungements for observation upon these light;:;, and then only for three snccrn>sive nights. I was then at Poore's Mountain, in North Carolina. One light was placed at King's Mountain, distant 58.4 miles (94 kms.), and another at Young's Mountain, distant 35.4 miles (57 kms.). My "initial point" or "reference mark" for all observations, at Poore's Mountain, was the spire of a church in Wilkesboro, distant 5 miles (8 kms.), nearly. Here I placed for night observation a bull's-eye lantern, showing through an anger hole Om.02 in diameter. The light at King's Mountain was in charge of Mr. C. A. Ives, and that at Young's Mountain in charge of Mr. J. M. Hill. :Each of these gentlemen had a resident of the locality with him, to work the light under his direction, and t.o have the capacity of that person tested for attending to it alone. I also arranged to burn the lights by a time-table, one after the other, each light being supplied with a clock for the purpose, and the co1Tect time being given to each by a signal from the observer before commencing the evening's observation. The time signal was made by showing a light t.o each in turn, stopping at a certain prearranged instant, to which each clock was set. This time-table was very successful and saved a great deal of the costly magnesium tape. The observations began at 6h 3om p. m. and continued to IOh 40"1 p. m.,

or 4h iow ; but each lamp was only lmrned for P 2om of this time, at a cost of $2.40 for each light instead of $i.50 each, if they had IJeen steadily burned. ; The obr.;errntions were made on the nights of October 9, 10, and 11, 18i7. All three nights were clear, with a hright moo11, more tltan half full. Coast Surn\y theodolite No. 3 (20-inclt) was used. There was a defect iu the oqject-glass of the telescope of this i11strumeut, causing a bright object like a heliotrope or a star to show with "taih;," remleri11g accurate pointing difficult. The microscope~ of the theodolite were read with a lantern burning a candle, and haYing lilaue-glass sides. The method of ohser-vation in 8erier-; war-; similar to that in regular use b~- day. Three seri£\S were ohserYe<l in Pach positiou, iu the order, telescope direct, (1) Mark, (2) Young, (3) King; then, after re\·ersiug telescope, (4) King, (ii) Young, (u) Mark, completing a series. Young, being in the midrlle of a series, 8howPd '.!~ miuntes; King showed 5 minute1<, in order to give time to reverse the telescope mul point again. Each light showed 5 minutei:; in turn at the end of each position, to permit correction of don btful observations. I make the following extract8 from notes made at the time:

The showing by time-ta,ble 011 the three nights has hcen sati:;factory, but the lights are too large and the 8ize of the reflector must be reduced on clear nights."
The result of tltis trial was highly satisfactoQ'· Owing to tl1e defect in the telescope used, to which I have reft>rrcd, and to the nnexpededly great irradiation of the signals, increasing largely their appar.ent diameter~ the test of relative precision as between day and night obser-vations was not a gootl one. The reflectors used were each 0'".'.!03 diameter and subten<led at Young's Mountain, distant :55.-1 miles (57 luns. ), 0 11 .7~~, and at King's :Mountain, diistant 58.-1 miles (9-1 kms.), 0".441 while their apparent diameter on the !Jth was estimated at 10" and· was ,-ery large on each night. This was susceptible of an ear-;y rt'medy iu future by graduating the amount of reflecting surface exposed to view, according to the length of the line and the clearness of the atmosphere. Messrs. h-es and Hill reported that the hcliotropers at both stations had been easily taught to manage the apparatus. Each upon the second night had taken the instrument from its box, pointing it carefully upon the stand, winding np the clockwork regularly, and lighting and stopping it at the times indicated by the time-tables. This last matter was very important on account of its large reduction of expense. But the great point ascertained, likely to be of so much futnre service, was that, on three succesHive nights, thB :;lrnl·p, cli>ar, ancl steady outline of tl1e horizon, only experienci>d h;r day-light at or near sunset, continued uuhrokcn up to l 1 p. m. 1 or for five hours longer. On each night the record of observation for l'ach signal was "distinct," "steady," up to the

100

REPORT OF THE SUPEDINTENDENT OF THE

end of my programme at 10.40 p. m., except that on one night my reference mark was obscured by mist rising from the Yadkin Hfrer about·9 p. m. It was also eddent by moonlight that mist from the streams which our lines crossed was rising each night about the time of our close of observation. I shall havl' occasion to refer again to this matter. .At your suggestion, I llirected Mr. Ives at the close of eacl1 night';; prograHime to remo\'e the reflector and to show the magnesium light direct for a certain specified five minutes. He did so, and at the time fixed I carefolly watched its appearance iu the telescope. It was only visible in a dark field and would uot bear illumination of the x hairs. Th's at first surprised me greatly, having se{·n it \"\itl10ut a telescope shortly before, but a little considm'ation satisfied me that the light without the reflector, being little more than a plc'ucil of rap; ha dug little or no phase, was dispersed upon a line of 94 kms. I remembered also a "case in point." In 18±6 I placed upon the dome of Cambridge observatory a hollow glass hemisphere (i inches in diameter, silvered ou the inside. But ouly a brilliant pencil of mys proceeded from it, m1<l I was unable to observe it with precii-;ion from the principal stations of tlrn secornlary triangulation of Boston Harbor and Yieinit~· which I was then executing. The mys were dispersed in the atmosphere. Bnt at a later period a similar hemisplrnre, liaving tli~ i11sille cast in facets, each about the size of a half dollar, and silrnred, presented a brilliant light, as the ra;vs from each facet in turn came tu the proper angle. The phase or reflecting surface caused the difference in this case, as it did with the magnesium light, nearly invisible without, but intensely brilliant with, the reflector. It was evident, as the result of the running of the clockwork of the lamps for three nights, that, as recefred from the maker, it was too weak for its object. All defects were carefully noted for future currectiou. But in all its main features the magnesium reflector light had i'nliiHed the conditions required for a geodesic night signal. It had1. Suffieient intensity for the longest lines. :.!. 1t was of light weight and simple in adjustment. :J. It was capable of sufiicientlJ'· accurate pointiug. 4. It. 1·011lrl be managed h~· men of ordinary intelligence without education. t). By the use of time-tables the expense was hrought within a limit very small in proportion to the time ;;aved. l\Iy party left the field shortly after the close of these experiments. The necei:;sity which arose for my i-;peuding the season of 1878 in Alabama prernnted their continuauce until, b.Y .mm· directiou, .I eunamped at Sugar Loaf Mountain, Maryland, in July, 1879, for tile special purposes named iu your instructions, and specified at the beginning- of thh; report. I have given here a history of all that had hef\n done by me from the beginning of inquiry into the matter iu the winter of 1871-'72 up to the first regular series of experiments, continued oYer ;;e\'eral months. }fany details arc omitt-0d. lt was only in the intervals of coHtiuuous labor that I had beeu able to giYe attention to the matter, but it was never out of my thoughts, and I embraced eYery opportunity of adding to my experience. I experimented upon the produetion of oxygen and hydrogen in rubber bags, with refereuce to the use of the calcium or oxy-hydrogen light, and at the close of the Uenteunial Exhibitiou in 18i6 I spent part of a night with Professor Farmer, watching the operation of two electric automatic l~gbt.s burning- upon the t.op of "Machinery Hall." Being eYt'l'ywhere met by the necessity for trained labor, it became nccessar.v to concentrate my whole attntion on magnesium, as the only kind of intensified light possible for our purpose. I now take up the operations at Sugar Loaf Mountain in 187il. Assistant F. D. Granger reported to me in person at Washington on the 14th July, a.ml Mr. J. B. Boutelle, aid, with camp equipage, arriYed at Barnesville, Md., near Sugar Loaf Mountain, on the 17th. The rest of the month was spent by the party in repairing the mountain road up Sugar Loaf Mountain, in pitching camp, and p1·eparing for observations. The weather was intensely hot, and only one day was at all tit for obserYing bet'ifeeu the time of our arrival at Sugar Loaf Mountain, July 15, and the end of the month. This was the beginning, a month earlier than usual, of a season of very thick and smoky atmosphere.

On the first week in August I sent out a party to ereet signals at station;; of the primary triangulation from which Sugar Loaf Mountain had been observed, wbilP I put up a small build· -ing, nine feet square, for a geodetic observatory. An insulated brick pier was laid in cement around the station point, and the 20-inch theodolite, C. S., No. 113, was mounted upon it. Another insulated pier was set up inside the building for Rnpporting an artificial horizon. The magnesium light had been fitted at the office with new and strong clockwork, and the "Hipp spring" bad been attached as a regulator in delivering the tape. Firn pounds of magnesium tape bad been supplied hy the American Magne.-;ium Company of Boston. This was put UJ) in tin reels of two ounces, about eighty yards of tap1· upon each reel. The improvements ~mggested by our experiments of 1877 had heen made, and I had firn magnesium reflector lamps in order for work. They are in good order now for immediate use. Oue of them is represented in illustration No. 37, except that in the experiments at Sugar Loaf the reel for deli\'ering the tape wa.s attached to the handle.

The following- translation is gin·n of a 1lescriptio11 of these "optfoal culli111:1tors.'· in a p:1per by M.

"By the illumination of the oltject-glass of this apparatus signals are outained which in good weather are visible to the naked eye as far as a distance of 80 kms. The images seen in a telescope of a geodetic instrument appear most frequently of a red color, hut are round, of limited coutour, and a uniform tint, and they afford when they become steady an easy and sure bisection, like that Ul)Oil stars of the first or second magnitude. "After sunset the signals soon become visible and show the same phenomena of dilation and of jumping which affect signals from heliotropes before sunset. By degrees, howe\'er, tlw imagl's become stationary, their diameter is reduced to a convenient size, and by an hour after sunset we enter upon a period of calm of a variable length, but often prolonged to midnight." This last paragraph conforms to my description of our experience in North Carolina in 1877, It will be further corroborated as I go on. It was not until the 18th August that we obtained a view of the distant llorizon north of us. Meanwhile many experiments at Sugar Loaf Mountain gave an estimated relatiYe intensity of the French lights barning kerosene oil to the magnesium reflectors of two to five. These were continued in various ways so long as we kept the lights together. Pasteboard caps, with apelltures of om.land om.15, were fitted to cover the magnesium reflectors, diminishing the aperture. Of these the smaller aperture of om.1 was afterward found sufficient, and was used e,·erywhere, except at Mount Marshall, in hazy weather.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Our view of the horizon upon the 18th of August only lasted for a fow hours, the next morning being thick al:l ever, but we had data for a reconnaissance, which was made by Assistant Granger. I desired to place a magnesium and a Ji'rench light neiir each other, at distances of 60 to 70 kms: from Sugar Loaf, that 1 might ob;;erve them under the same physical and atmospheric conditions. I also wished to place the other I~rench light at some point upon the Potomac near Washington. Asi,;istant Granger made several attempts to select a point, being baffled by the thick weather, hut on the 28t1h Augm;t succeeded in finding a suitable place near the house of Mr. A. Strecker, on the Maryland side of the Potomac opposite Alexandria, from which it is distantabout3.1 miles (5 kms.). It could be easily reached also b~' driving about 7.5 miles ( 12 kms.) from ·washington. The distance from Sugar Loaf was fouud to be 38.8 miles (62.4 kms.), and the line of sight would run near the sn~'face, giring me the diversified profiles which I desired. The station was. adopted and a French light placerl there on the 1st of September. Tim month of August had giYen us only parts of two days with a clear horizon. But it had not been lost. B1\:perimeuts at camp ha(l deYeloped difficulties in the running of the new clockwork of the magnesium lamps. AssiHtant Hilgard had kindly detailed from the office Mr. Weruer Suess, to whom I was greatlJ· indebted for skillfnl antl ingenious alterations of various parts of the machinery, as also for aid in trials of the relative intensitJ· of the lights, and in posting the lights at Streeker aud ~lount Marshall. In September there were a few intermittent intervals of clear weather bet.ween the 3cl Septem· her and the 25th, at which elate a season of clear weather set in, lasting for five days and enabling us U) make i>rogress. A French light was 11osted by Assistaut Gra.uger on Granite Hill, in Gett:_rsbnrg, ahont ;~u miles (6 kms.) east northeast of that place and-!~.!) milPs (69 kms.) from Sugar Loaf Mountain. A nrngnesinm light was ;1lso poste1l upon \Volt' Ilill, abont 1.2 miles (2 krns.) southeast of Gettysburg, au<l 39.8 mileR (64 lims.) from 8ugar Loaf: The lines of sight to Wolf and Granite hills passed over a rolling country, nowhere approach. iug very cloRe t{) the surface. So far as I could see, both lines had the same physical conditions and were likely to be a1focted equally by any atmospheric <listLirbances. Our preparations for observation wPre now complete. I had e15tablished a reference mark near the railroad station at I3arnesYille, distant a.82 miles (6.14 knu;.) from Sugar Loaf. It was the usual azimuth mark of my part,y, which had been used at the experimental observations at Poon,'s J\.fouutaiu, in North Carolina, in 1877. It consists of a box perforated with holes for supplying air and closed by a slide. Iti:i front is a. hoard 31 inches (Om.8) long and 16 inches (Om.4) wide, painted white, with a vertical black stripe 0.H8 inch (0'".025) hroarl in its center for a day mark, and an auger hole 0. 75 inch (O'''.OHI in diameter) in the center of the stripe, through which a bull's-eye lantern in the hox shows at night.. It was solidly secured, with a mark in the ground to refer to in case of possible disturbance. The other two of my five points of comparison by .day and night were Bull Run Mountain, in Fauquier County, Virginia, disfant 31.1 miles (50 kms.), and Mount Marshall, in Rappahannock Uounty, Virginia, distant 55.0 miles (88.5 kms.). These were stations of the primary triangulation, and Sugar Loaf' had been observed from them. Heliotropes and magnesium lamps were placed at these stations, which are respecth'el~- 1,375 feet (419m) and 3,376 feet (l,029m) high. Besides the five stations for day and night comparison, I also observed upon the stations Stahler, Soldieri,;' Home, Peach Grove, and Maryland Heights, in order to close the triangles upon these stations from whence Su~ar Loaf Mountain had been observed. I also observed upon the C:lpitol at \'\Tashington and the Theological Seminary near Alexandria, as secondary points. These constituted an entirely distinct aml separate series of observations, called the "short series" by wa;r of 1lif1tinction. All were upon signal poles except at two secondary points. The distrilmtion and relatiYe positions of all points observed upon will be seen in sketch ~(). 36. Observations upon the "short series" began on the 18th August, and were continued at times wlien the more distant points could 1wt be soon. They were completed on the 19th October. I have mentioned that an interval of clear weather began on the 25th September. Bull Run

and Mount Marshall were ready and at once began sllowing· heliotropes by day and magnesinm light at night, the latter hy a prearranged time-tahlt·. Bull Run being only 31.1 miles (50 knu;.) distant, exposed only the central 3.9 inches (0 .1) of the diameter of the reflector, but was always visible to the naked eye. 1\fount Marshall also showed wit.11 U.e cap and was seen well on clear nights, but being ;;;; miles (88 kms.) distant, the full surface of the reflector wa8 required on hazy nights. Between September 25 and October 1, ten out of elenn positions were ob1-;en'ed at night, two positions on each for five nights. l migl1t ea1-;ily have completed the other position, but preferred in experimental observations to observe but two po8itions, or six series, on any one night. During the same time eight positions were obserYed by ua~. Neither Bull Run nor Mount Marshall were 8een from October 1 to 20 and 2.), when obsenations upon them were completed. Strecker did not begin to show until September :30, and Granite Hill on the next uig-ht; but another season of smoke set in, lasting "nearl~· three weeks, and never giYing us perfectly clear weather until just as we had wrung the observations out of the pPrsistent haze, ahout the middle ofNo"Vember. By dint of close watching, all observations were closrll hy the 311 November, excl'pt a fow hy day upon Wolf and Granite. These detained us until the 19th November.

Wolf was ready, but through some mistake did not show at the right time on Octohl:'r 1. '" e saw neither \Volf nor Granite between October 1 aml 20. These two stations showed the umnense a<h-autage which the magnesium light hail ovpr th<> French apparatus in hazy weather. ·while the maguesinm light at \\olf Hill w:18 clearly Yisihle, sometimes t.o the naked eye and always in the telescove, when wt· could not make out the outline at sunset of either Wolf or Granite, the French light at Granite Hill could barely be seen in the telescope with all light cut off, and it would uot bear light enough upou the cross-hairs to enable us to observe it. It was showing with full size of the objective of the collimator, 7.9 inches (Om·.'.!), Wolf showing with only 3.9-incbes (Om.I) diameter of reflector, or, in inches, the French light was showing with 50 square iuches of reflecting' 1mrfa.ce, and the mag11esium light with but 12 square inches of effective reflecting power. The French lights on clear nights made very pretty marks to point upon. The light was generally tinged with red, and had not intensity enough to trouble us with irradiation, while the white light of the magnesium would sometimes appear t-Oo large for delicate pointing, even when showiug with a cap. On all the lines and with all the lights, but Strecker, during the whole season, the same steadiness and clearness of outline was found that we had obsened in North Carolina. The line to Strecker ran near the surface, and crossed the Potomac twice. Exhalations from the surface and from the river caused greater irregularity in the observations upon this signal, both by day and night, than upon any other. But the irregular motion or dancing by night never equalled that of the same signal b~' day. I feel now sure that we may depend upon the hours from sunset t-0 midnight, on ever.r clear night, as good for observing; and I now fear lateral refraction at night so little that I should advise observation to be made as rapidly as possible, closing un the ohservations in as short a time as the weather will allow, instead of distributing the observations over a certain length of time to get rid of possible lateral refraction at any one time, as has been the general practice.

104

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Lateral refmction, as a chief source of error in geodetic observations, was not suspected, so far as I can discover, until early iu the present century. Delambre writes (Bal'ie Metrique, vol. 1, p. lOfi), "S'il existe une refraction laterale, comme J'ai ete parfois, tente de le croire," &c. I take !ateral refraction to be due to unequal heating, causing unequal density, of the diflerent media through which geodetic lines of sight pass. If I am right, it follows that it is likely he greatest during the day and least at night. ·with the introduction of position-instruments with fixed circles of graduation, the signal could be followed, and iti; variation from its natural position noted by its different readings upon the limb, while, also, the phenomenon seems to be one occurring more during the day than during the night. Tbe French geometers adhered to the repeating circles long after American observers had given them up. English observers never used repeating circles. As late as 185:3, Colonel Peytier, in an elaborate description of different geodetic instruments then in use, gives the preference over position-instruments to repeating circles, (Memorial Du Depot General de la Guerre, vol. 9, pp. 398-401). I have used too many repeating circles successfully to say one word against them. With care and constant attention, no better instruments can be found of a size from 6 to 12 inches (0 111 .15 to orn.30) diameter, but the successful use of them depends entirely upon the power of the clamps and tangent-screws to maintain immovable the relation of the verniers to the graduations during a series of repetitions. I do not believe this fixity of tenure can be maintained with instruments of greater diameter than 12 inches, and even with these the most vigilant care is necessary. Position-instruments, of a size from 16 to 20 inches (Om.40 to 0'".50) diameter, must take their place in all great geodetic operations. Also, while the French circles by Gambey and others are admirably gra(luatPd and constnH'ted, t11eir tt>h·scopes are always too small, and have 1wt sufficient space-pe11etrating power. :M;v methods of ob:-;erving were those usual in my party for the vast twelve years. They are all directed to the i;olution of the problem" ~What are the most probable directions of certain lines'" which iR the question we ha'''"' to solve with all" direction" or "position'' instruments. All observations are referred to the "initial point" or "reference mark," which enters into eYery series obserTed. I 11:we found hr the experience of many yearn that eleven positions, with three series in each p()sition, gfres a resulting relation of the station observed t-0 the mark, with a precision having a mean probable error of less than 0".2 to the mean, aud less than 111 for any single result. The 20-inch (Om.5) theodolite, No. 113, used by me has three microscopes and micrometers, reading to seconds. As each series consists of a pointing, telescope direct, and a pointing, telescope reversed, upon each signal in the series and upon the mark, twelve different graduations are read upon in each case. In the first position, the microscopes are set to read oo, 120°, 24-00, nearly, upon the· reference mark, when three series are observed, and the reading upon each signal recorded. Then the microscopes are set to read Jl.?f- 320 43'.6, nearly, from the first reading, and three series are again observed in Position II. Position III and the others follow, the microscope being set at 2 (.a.l1J1.0 ), &c., upon the mark in each new position. Eleven positions are taken because it is a prime number and is not a factor of two or of three (tiro positions of the telescope direct or reversed and three microscopes). It follows that the final direction is the mean of thirty-three series, read upon one hundred and thirty-two different graduations, and that it has not been possible that the same graduated division shall have entered twice into the result. This method was pursued with the day and night observations, which were kept as distinct as if made at separate stations. The only difference was that at night the cross-hairs of the telescope were illuminated by a small lamp attached to one of the pillars supporting the theodolite, with a counterpoise weight attached to the other pillar, and the microseopes were read by a lantern with three square sides of plane glass anti a melial slide or door upon the fourth side. The method of reading with this form of lantern WM practiced by Professor Boohe aft.er 18«,

It throws a square light upon the reflector attached to the microscope aud giYe8 a minimum of heat, arnl no opportunity for possible side lights and shadows at irregularly cut divisions, while it has the merit of tlie greatest simplicity.

in which r' and H/ represent the probable errors of the mean of a position and of eleven positions The indiscriminate mean best represents the obserYations, but I give both for the purpose of comparison. The discrepancies in the resulting directions of Bull Hun and Wolf stations by the day and night observations seem to be accidental at °"Volf, but at Bull Hun eight out of eleven positions give a larger angle with the mark by night thau by day. I am wholly unable to give any reason for this difference. So far as the observations are concerned, tlley are all of equal value and all appear good. The night results fill all triangles better than the others, but there is no other reason for giving them preference. It will be seen that the probable errors incline slightly to the side of the night obserrntions, but the difference is so small th1tt I am inclined to give them equal weight and to consider the relative precision as equal. I desire in this connection to repeat and emphasize the statement, that each series obser,·ed bJ· day has been simpl;r a duplicate of another, series ooscrved at night. The instrument, the observers, the methods of reading and pointing, and all conditions dependent upon the modes of observing have been absolutely identical. The only differences have been in the character of the signals observed and in the times of observation. At Granite and Strecker the heliotrope by day was also the light at night. At tlte other stations the utmost care was taken that the light at night should be in the identical line of the heliotrope a.nd an eccentricity exceeding 0.39 inch (Orn.Ol) was impossible. I have mentioned, on page 97, that in 1874 I had fitted up two "student lamps" with refiectS. Ex.12-14

ors, but that my partial trial with them was not successful. These had been set up at Sugar Loat Mountain for illuminatiou of our camp in observing nights. The degree of intensity of light from them compared so favoral1ly with that of the French apparatus that I '\Yas led to believe the trial in 187 4 to lrnYe been not altogether a fair one. On tlie 10th ~ovember, \Yl1en all obsenations were nearly completed, I sent Mr. J.B. Boutelle, with one of the1>e lights, to Bull Run Mountain, distant 31.1 miles (50 kms.), to test it. He arrirnd at the mountain 011 the 11th, at Runset. I, looking southwest, was barely able to make out the faiutest possible outline of Bull Hun .:\fountain, and Mr. Boutelle, looking Hortheast, could not see anything of Sugar Loaf. Ifat lie placed hil:l light upon the heliotrope stand aud pointed it at the raug·e-mark used in heliotroping. 'I'o my gwat sur1>rise aml delight, it was at once visible in the telescope at Sugar Loaf, showing clear~ bright, srnall, rou11d, aud steady, bearing the full illumination of the cross-hairs, which 11eithe1· of the French lights would bear. lfa'> brightness was about that of a fourth-magnitude star in the same telescope. Like the magnesium, or any other reflector lamp, the front must. be closed hy a plane-glass co\-er on wintly nights. A meniscus lens is best, but a box with a pane of glass in frout: answers ver,"1- well. H is elieap, simple, and easily carried. It is capable of manipulation by any person of fair iutelligeuce. That it can be correctl;r pointed is shown in this case. I think it max be used to a<lrnutage wherever the French light cm1 be, or for all distances up to 40.ri miles (70 krns.). Beyonu that, it will he safest and cheapest to use the magnesium reflector. Tlie experience of the season enables me to state with some precision the cost of the magnesium light, so much superior to every otller yet tried. The success, iu two instances, of burning the Hght by a time-table 7 establisl1ed that method as perfectly practicable. It 1·educes the time of burning it to 20 minutes per hour, or to 80 minutes for 4 l10urs of observati9n. \Yith a delivery of ribbon of 15 inches per miimte, the cost will - ' \ -=~"--, he $2 per night for each light /-~r ~ used.

Of course, an attendant must be paid for where any form of night-signal is used. We have usually paid our heliotropers $1 1wr day, without subsistence. I found no difficulty last season iu erriploying the same men for night duty at au additional pay of fifty cents i)er night, or $3 for six stations. The cost of putting Ull small huts at each station, like that here shown, and providing material needed, may be estimated at $'.!0 each.

To offset this additional party expense there will be1. The shortening of time required in occupation of each station by the addition of four observing hours after sunset on e:u~h clear day. The a·erngc time of ohsen-ation by day being two hours, this time will be tripled on each clear day and night. 2. Necessity for encamping at many stations may he a>oided, where now the prohahilitics of a long detention and the lack of any decent quarters within a reasonable distance require the transportation and use of equipage. 3. Assuming the present aYerage cost of each primary station to be $1,000, the occupation of only one more station in a season where uight si1wals are mwll would pay the a1Witional expens·~, lmt it is probable that at least three more stations will be occupied, and time, which iR money, sa·ed. l\luch of tl1is must be matter of estimate and conjecture, but I hope to demonstrate all I assert if I ha·e three more seasons of obsen-atious, and am supported by yon ~ith the sam(· generous confidence that yon gave me last year. Under any circumstances, more time is now spent at every primary station in 'l>aiting than in ohserYing. H is probable thi8 must ahrnys be the case. Colonel Peytier says (m~morial du Depot de la Guerre, Vol. 9, p. 38fl): "·with series observed under bad couditions, we risk altering the mean instead of bettering it. Geodetic stations being usnall~- in high })laces, often far from villages affording an;y resources, one can understand in such circumstances the impatience of obsen-ers and their desire to finish their stations promptly. Nevertheless, if there is any 011e q 11ality esseutial to au ohsen-er it is patience. With it and a good instrument he will always succeed in obtaining good results.'' I am obliged to <lifter -with M. }f. Perrier and Bossot iu their condemnation of reflectors and their substitution of ''optical collimators." They say, tts I han· quoted on page 101: "For uight signals we have given up the use of·refiectors, which could not always he exactly pointed, are difficult to keep in adjuo;tment, arnl mui,;t hm·e considerable dimensious when the sides of triangles are from 40 to 50 kms. (25 to ;31 miles) long, and we ham adopted the use of optical collimators." These eminent obserrnrs state in reference to reflectors: 1. They cannot always be correctly pointed; 2. The;y are difficult to keep in adjustment; 3. They require large dimensions when showing upon sides of 40 to 50 kms. These statements are erroneous, as my experience tends to disprove them. I will, howm-er, take the statement in detail and give e·irlence tl1at reflectors can be corn·ctly and easily pointed; that they ha Ye few and simple adJustments, not easy to put out of order, and that the,y are vil"ihle to t11e naked eye at 37.3 miles (60 km<;.) with a diamet.er of 3.9 inch (Om.I) when the light of l\L Perrier's ''01)tical collimator" with a diameter of 7.9 inches (Om.2) could not be seen in the telescope. Examining the drawing of the magnesium lamp, a pointer will he noticed under the mi~ldle of the reflector. A line is drawn upon tl1e top of the stand placed o\·er the station point in the vertical plane IMssing through that point and the station to which the lamp is to he shown. The foot·screw behind the clockwork and the pointer under tlw reflector are placed in this line, and the front face of the reflector is made vertical by the foot-screw. This is all the pointing ucccssary, and it has not failed to direct the light :wcnratcly and rernler it Yisible at distances from :.n.1 to 65.2 miles (50 kms. to 105 kms.). None of the reflectors used are true paraboloid!'; all ha ye more or less di\-ergence of rays. So great is this divergence tltat the lieliotroper at Bull R.un complained that he saw the timl'-t<ig-11al flashed from Sugar Loaf to Mount Marshall and was coufused b~- it. Looking at the dirPctious on page 105, it will be seen that the angle at Sugar Loaf between Bull Run an(l l\:Iarshall is onr :!(P. Exact pointing with it is not, therefore, as necessary as it is with the French optical collinmtor. The other reflector with the "student lamp" is pointed in mi equally simple manner. That it is effective is shown in the account of our experiment with it preYionsl,,· gi>en. The only adjustments of the magnesium reflector light arc to keep it won ml up, occasionally to adjust the spring shown at tlrn top of the clockwork, to keep the deliven- of the tape at 15 inches (0.38) per minute (which is done by the otlieer posting the lteliotroper), and to keep correctly pointed the direction of the line upon the stand in which the foot-screw and pointer are placed. This can be tested on e·rnry clear day with a couple of pins. Also, to keep the time-piece wound up and to tiet it every night by the time-signal given from the obserrnr's station. The person in

charge has then simply to sit by his light and extinguish it at the time given in the time-table for him to "begin" and "stop." All tlds has been succ<>ssfully done at Bull Run, 1\fount Marshall, and Wolf Stations by uneducated me11 of onlinan· intelligence after a >ery short. training. The apparatus is packed in a box 16 b~- 14 by 16 inches, with clock, lantern, and other needed accessories, the whole weighing, when packed comJllete, 4.0 pounds. The "student lamp" has still simpler adjustments. It is aligned by placing one foot-screw and a pointer under the center of the instrument upon the line on the top of the stand representing the line of sigM. The front edge of the reflector is set parallel to the support,ing rod and perpendicular to the line of ~ight, and it is levelled by the footscrews. It is inclosed in a box haying a plane-glass front to keep the flame steady in windy weather, and, being lighted at sunset, rarely requires any further attention up to midnight. Packed in its box for transportation, the whole weighs 25 pounds. From our test of it in very thick weather, at 31.1 miles (50 kms.) distance, I think we may rely upon it in clear weather up to 43.5 miles (70 kms.). "\Yith regard to larger dimensions of reflectors, at distances from 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50 kms.), I have already stated that the magnesium reflector of the same size as the o~ject-glass of the collimator, 7.9 iuches or (Om.2), was visible to the naked eye in June, 1877, at distances of 39.l and 65.2 miles (63 and 105 kms.) in the moonlight. Again, in October, 18771 it was olnmrvecl for three successive nights at 35.4 and !i8.4 miles (fi7 and 9+ kms.), being always visible to the naked eye. From Sugar Loaf Mountain to Bull Run and "\Volf Stations the distances are 31.1 and 40.4 miles (50 and (i5 kms.). At these stations the aperture of the reflector was diminished to om.1, but the lights were always visible in the telescope, and often t-0 the naked eye, when the smoke was so deuse that the outline of tlw distant station could not be seen M sunset. 'fhe "student lamp," with a reflector 0"'.'.211iameter, was visible in the telescope at 31.1 miles (50 kms.) distant, when tlie outline of the mountain was invisible at sunset, and the smoke continued all night. The French lights as received from France weiglied each, packed for transportation in two boxes, 280 pounds. I have already described these lights and their power as I used them. Alterations are now being made by which I hope largely to increase their effective power, while reducing the weight to about 100 pouuds, and rernlnring the:µ1 more convenient for tranl'lportation and use. I hope after the experience of the coming season to be able to make a decisive report on their mm. Any lamp burning coal-oil steadily, with cffoctive power upon long sides, whether reflector or collimator, will be a gain upon the magnesium in point of cost and convenience, but I very much doubt if it can he obtained. But some other and cheaper form of intensified light, equally capable of management by uneducated persons, and equally simple in its details 7 may very possibly be discovered. The conclusions to which the experiments and results at Sugar Loaf 1\fountain have led me may be generally summed up as follows : 1. That night observations are a little more accurate than those by day, but the difference is slight thus far. · · 2. That the cost of apparatus is less than that of good heliotropes. 3. That the ap11aratus can he manipulated by the same class of men as those who~ we employ as heliotropers; tliat is, ordinary residents of t.he locality, of fair intelligence without education. 4. That the aYerage time of observing in clear weather may be more than doubled by observing at nig·ht, and thus the time of occupation of a station proportionately shortened; "clear-cloudy" weather when heliotropes cannot show may be utilized at night. 5. That reflector lamps, or optical collimators, burning coal-oil, as already described, may be used to advantage 011 lines of 43.5 miles (70 kms.) and under. But for longer lines the magnesium light will be best and cheapest, as being most certain. 6. That for the present we should keep up both classes of observations, both by day and night, and that the observers in charge of the various triangulations should be informed of the progress already made, and encouraged and stimulated to improve on the methods and materials thus far employed in night observations.

COMPARISON OF THE SURVEYS OF DELAWARE RIVER IN FRO'\T OF PHILADELPHIA, 1843 AND 1878.
BY H. L. J\1:ARINDIN, Assistant.

LNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

Boston, 1lfass., November 15, 1880. DEAR Sm: In accordance with ~-our instructions, I have made a comparison of the surveys of the Delaware River in front of Philadelphia, one executed in 1843 by Lieut. G. S. make, U.S. N., and the other in 1878, by a party un<ler ill,\- cliarg-o, in steamer Fatliorner. The comparison extends from Bridesburg to Fort l\Iiftlin, and is contained in tlte four charts accompantjng this report. These charts haYe been reduce<l from the original scale of the :-mrvey of 1878-1-4800, to a scale of 1-10000. Tracing No. 1 repreRonts the 1.:hanges iu the Delaware Uiver between Brideslmrg and Kensington; No. 2, from Kensington to Kaighn's Point; No. 3, from Kaig·lm's I>oiut to the Ilorseslioe; and No. 4, from the Horseshoe to Fort .l\Iiffiiu. (See di.arts accompanying this report numbered 38, 3fl, 40, aml 41). The charts contain the following data: 1. The position of tbC' shore, wharf, aml low-water lines of 184-3, 2. The position of the same lines in 1878. 3. The differences in depth, 1843 to 1878, with the corresponding volumes shoaled or deepened. 4. The position of the line of mid-area, which diYide8 the stream into two parts of equal cross. section. 5. The position of the lines of maximum depth. This comparison is basrd on tlH\ divisions of 30" latitude hy 30 11 longitude; these were again subdh'ided into ~miall rectangular figures, 2".5 longitude hy 211 .0 latitude, containing 3ll,426 square feet.:.._something lt·ss than one acre. 'l'he mean of all the soundings within each small square was obtained for both surveys, and the difference noted, together with the correspomli11g volume in cubic yards. The examination of chart No. 1 shows marked changes, the most important of which is the extmision of the o;hoal from the north channel of Petty's Island up river to l·'ive-mile Point, where it connect8 with the 8hore, forming a bulkhead, with only 7 feet of water at mean low tide. Taking the (i.foot curve a8 a limit for the shoal, I find the extension to have been 4,740 feet in thirtyfive years; over this distance, which, in 1843, nearly represented the entrance info Petty's Island (north) Channel from the eastward, there was a series of depths from 6 feet, increasing to 18 and 20 feet-this last depth where now the !Hoot limit of the shoal exists. There are doubtless many causes which combined to effect this change, hut I would suggest, as a rem;o11able one, the encroachments on the channel-way, at the lower end especially, an<l along Petty's Island (north) Channel. The current obsflrvatiom; of 1878 show this to be a fiood-elmnnel mainly; therefoni any diminution of the cross-sectfon, obstructing the free admission of the flood current, will have a tendency to effect the change ohscrYed. In sketch A (No. 42) ifl given the mean amount of shoaling or deepening over short reaches of the river. It will be seen that a large amount of shoaling has taken place in the eastern half of the north channel, and indeed as far as Five-mile Point, whereas the western half of this 1mme channel shows an increasP in depth; this is again the effect of the diminution of section by encroachments. The tendency of the current io; to restore the cross-section to its just area by deepening the channel; and the power of the flood current, instead of being unimpaired to keep the channel free in its entire length, is now spent in restoring the section to its proper dimensions in the vicinity of the encroachments. The south channel shows an increase in depth throughout, although not large. Probably the

gradual closing of the pasrsage into the north channel for the ebb stream must account for part of this amelioration of the south channel. The blind channel-way between the north and south ehanncl, elose fo thP poiut of marsh at the eastern extremity of l'etty's Island, hal'< increased both in depth aud iu width, and may in time lmcome the best outlet of the north channel to the east\yanl. Chart ~o. 2 (numbered 3!1) shows also l'iome change/'\, Shoaling hal'i taken place aloug the south side of Petty's faland, between the low-water line and the 1~-foot. eurve, an~rag-ing 1.5 feet over this area; hut the (keper parts of thi:-; half of the south elrnnnel luiYe tleepcnc(l su much as to give a mean· increase of depth over the whole of O.IJ!;) foot. ' There is a decided decrease of depth o,-er the shoal oft' the north fl1d of Smith's Islaml, with an extension of this :shoal trrn-anls Cooper's Point. 'l'hi:s seeim;, in a great meatoiure, a repetition of the working of the Five-mile l'oiut Shoal. The northern extremity of the Smit.h\; Island shoal, as limited b:r the 6-foot curve, was 8, 100 foet north of the i:>land in 18-h\; in 1878 1 found the north em extremity of this shoal :3,GOO feet from the island-au extem;iou of 500 teet in thirty five yeart>. The channel over the bulkhead at Cooper's Poiut has bePu m1luced iu consequenee from 840 feet in width and 11~ feet of water at mean low tide to 230 feet in w-illtll and 8 feet depth of water-a decrease of both width and depth. The mean change, howeYer, over this part of the river a:s far as Kaighn'1; Point has ueeu a general increase in depth varying from 0.-!li foot to ~.10 feet, as :,;hown iu sketch ..:\.. The changes to be noted over the shoal off the south end of '\Yindmill Island show an e:rneption to what seemed to he a rule so far; here I find a 1ledrled increase of dPpth, awragiug ~L 7.'i ft>et within the 12-foot, carve as it, now stands; the maximum iuemase on~r· all,\ n11e :wm of area bdug 9.4 feet and the minimum 0.5 foot. This shoal seems tD be effectually weariug away. The Jersey shore shows some shoaling for a distance off the wharf line as it now exists; hen:, also, I find the greatest artificial advance of the shore line into the stream, iu some cases as nmcll as 1,160 feet. This encroachment on the stream has probably been the meam; of deepening the channel-way along· its entire front from Cooper's l'oint to Kaighu's· J>oint. Chart No. ;) (numbered 40), from Kaiglrn's Point to the Horseshoe, containing nearly the whole of the last-named shoal, shows change1; over the Greem..-icl1 Point middle ground. 'l'here is now 17 feet of water at mean low tide ou the shoalest part of the gronml, where one sounding of I~ feet occurs in the survey of 18.!3. Taking the :!±-foot cun-e as the limiting line of this shoal, I find a mean increase of depth of 0.37 foot over the area iuclosed, with a maximum shoaliug of U.ti foot ou au_y oue :.wre of surface, a.nd a maximum <leepm1ing of:! t~et O\'PI' a similar arPa. The ahovementioued increase is deduced from a comparison of (k~ soundings found within the ~-i-foot curve. The shoal shows a slight elongation up and down 8tream with a decrea,se in it:s width. The changes on t.he Horseshoe Shoal are more marked in its shoalest parts. Taking the 6-foot curve as the limit, with its upper end terminating at the northern extremity of the sloug·h channel, I find a mean shoaling of ~.GI feet over the entire surface inclosed within the limiting currn, with a maximum shoaling of (i.3 feet in au~· oue acre of surface. The slough channel back of the Ilorneshoe has deepened materially, with a maximum deepening of 5.1 feet iu any one acre of surface. At the lower end of the Horseshoe the shoaling is decided, and extends nearly acros:s the rirnr in the .direction of Eagle Point. Chart No. 4 (numbered 41 ), from Horseshoe to Fort l\iifiiin, gives the changes at the westeru Pllll of the Horseshoe, spoken of above, and such changes as ha.Ye obtained along the water-front of r~eague fa]and and at the mouth oft.lie Sclmylkill River. An increase of depth can be shown along the larger part of the south side of League Island, but the depths on the Jersey :>hore seem to have decreased, extending over the shoalest part of the shoal on which .Fort l\Iiftiiu light-house stands; in examining the depth:s within the 6-foot curve, I find an average shoaling of;) feet over the area inclosed. At the mouth of the Schuylkill River the differences in depth are Yery large, reaching in some .few cases 19 and 22 feet increase. These very large differences must be attributed mainly 1:-0 the dredging which has been resorted to, to improve this outlet. In sketch A ilcl given the average shoaling or deepening over .limitoo spaces of the river.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

While explaining this sketch I will give some results taken out of tables 1and2, in which is given the average change in the dPpths in a uelt 400 feet wide, situated along the line of mid-area (200 feet on each side of the line), and along the lines of maximum depth. The position of these lines is given on the chart8 1 to 4, a8 al8o the }JOint of intersection witli the cross-sections, which points are noted in the tables for purposes of location. Beginning at Five-mile Point, sketch A shows an average decrease in depth of 0.993 foot as far llS the upper end of Petty's Islaml. Within this space section a, the belt along the line of midarea, shows an increase of depth of 5.3 feet, and along the line of maximum depth, in the Fivemile Point channel, a decrease in depth of 1.02 feet, while the maximum depth belt i11 the ,Jersey shore channel gives au increase of 4.86 feet. Going down the north chaunel, section b shows an average shoaling of 1.017 feet in the upper half of this channel, the mid-area belt gives an increase of 1.2:) feet, ancl the maximum depth belt no changes. The western half of the north channel, section c, gives an average increase of 0.504 foot, the mid-area belt an increase of 1.05 feet, aml the maximum depth belt an average deepening of 1.53 feet. 'l'he south Petty's fa land channel gfres for its upper half, section d, au average increase of 0.136 foot, for mid-area belt au increase of 0.84 foot, aml for maximum depth belt an average deepening of 0.50 foot. The lower half of the channel, section e, gives au average deepening_ of 0.945 foot, for mid-area belt 2.3 feet increase, and for maximum depth belt an average deepening of 1.45 feet. Off tlle western end of Petty's Island, sketch A shows a small triangular i-;ection, f, with an average increase in depth equal to 1.153 feet. This section was cntofffrmn section g, the Cooper's Point section, in order to embrace iu t!Je latter more specifically the changes which have taken place at Cooper's Point and immediate Yicinity. The mid-area belt in section f shows an increase in depth of 2.5;'J feet, and the maximum depth belt an increase of 1.46 feet. Sectio11 g, at Cooper'g Point, gives an average increase of 0.468 foot, the mid-area belt one of 1.76 feet, while the maximum depth belt on the Philadelphia si1le givns a large increase of 2.34 feet, and the maxi11111111 de11tl1 helt oYer the bulkhead at Cooper's Point an inurease of only 0.18 foot. Below thi:,;, in :,;ectiou h, as far as Smith'8 faland, I find the largest average deepening of any sectiou of the river, equal to 2.255. fret; the mid-area oelt also gives the largest amount of change, equal to an aYerage deepeniug of 7.31 feet, whereas the maximum depth belt on the Philadelphia side shows an average i-;hoaling of 1.16 feet, and 011 tl1e Jersey side a large increase of 4.51 feet, so that, of the two clrn1mel-ways, the one on the Jense.r shore side has had the greatest amelioration ·· I haYe mentioned pre\'ion8ly the marked shoaling on the Smith's Island shoal, within this section. The east an<l west Windmill Island channels 8how a decided average increase of depth, respectively, l. li'i5 feet and 1.808 feet. In the western clmuuel the mill-area helt haH deepened 2.3 feet, aml the 11iaximum depth belt 3.44 feet. In the eastern channel the mid-area belt has deepened 4.1 foet, and the maximum depth belt 4.72 feet. l<'rom the south end of \Viudmill Island to Kaighn's Point, section l, the average deepening has been larg·e, equal to 2.141 feet. Nearly the entire width of the river shows an improvement. In t!Jis section is situated the shoal off the south en<l of \Vin<lmill Island previously mentioned. The mid-area belt shows au increase of 4. 7 feet in deptli, and the maximum depth-belt on the Philadelphia side girng a dnepening of 5.10 feet, and on the Jersey 8ide a similar change of ~.26 feet. The next section below Kaiglrn78 Point, 1n of sketch A, shows a falling off in the amount of change. This shows an incrcaseof 0.i17 foot, with a mid-area belt 3.50 feet deeper, and an increase in the maximum depth-lJelt 011 the PenusylYania side of 1.75 feet, and on the Jersey side an increase of 1.37 feet. Section n is the secolld section, which shows an average shoaling in the main stream. This shoaling augments as the river becomes narrower, until Gloucester is reached, when it changes again to an increase in the widest part of the river yet observed. In section nan average shoaling of 0.215 foot is obtained, while the mid-area belt still shows an increase of depth of 1.96 feet, with a maximum depth belt increase of 1.55 feet on the .Pennsylvania side and of 1;84 feet on the Jersey side. These differences show the shoaling to have taken place more particularly on the face of the banks of both shores, reaching in two cases a maximum change of 11.5 feet and 18.8 feet·

In section owe have a larger average shoaling, equal to 0.992 foot; the mid-area belt shows scarcely any change, while the maximum depth belt on the Penrrnylvania side haN au anmtge shoaling of 1.30 feet, and on the Jersey side an increase of de1)th of O.M foot. Section p, off Gloucester, shows a still larger average shoaling, equal tA:J 1.563 feet, with a shoaling in the mid-area belt equal to 0.23 foot; here the maximum depth lines, which han· ht:'en · separate from the starting-place at Five-mile Point, unite, and give an average shoaling of 1.:3::! feet in this section, so that the shoaling may be said to have been very general across the bell of the river. We now come to tlre widest part of the river, section q, witll an average increase of deptlr of 0.543 foot; the mid-area belt, however, still gives a shoaling of 0.61 foot, and the maximum de.pthbelt also a decrease of 0.13 foot. These lines nearly coincide in tJ1is section, and run about in the middJe of the 24-foot channel; the shoaling within these belts, with a general increase oYer the whole section, shows that the channel-way has lost what the sllore depths have gained. The eaRtern half of the Horseshoe shoal lies in this section. The next section, r, as far as League Island, indicates an aYerage shoaling of 0.524 foot; the mid-area belt gives a very l~rge shoaling of 4.5 feet, and the maximum depth beU a decrease of 1.17 feet. The mid-area line, owing to the extensive flats on the ,Jersey shore, runs almost on the edge of the Horseshoe shoal, where greater changes are found than obtain in the bed occupied by tho belt of maximum de11th. The next section, s, embraces about"one-third of tl1e League Island shore, and shows an anwage increase of 0.299 foot, while the mid-area belt gives a decrease of 1.75 feet, and the maximum depth belt a shoaling of 0. 77 foot. The section off the middle of League Island gives a larger increase of depth than the previous one, equal to 0.491 foot, wilh a corresponding increase in the mid-area belt of 1.05 feet, and also in the maximum depth belt equal to 0.66 foot. Section 1i, the last division off the western end of League Island, once more changes fo a general shoaling of 0.233 foot,. with a 0.95-foot shoaling in the mid-area belt, and a similar cliange of 0.35 foot in the maximum depth belt. This section includes a la.rge pill't of the shoal on which Fort Miffiin Light-house stands, which has previously been shown to have shoaled extensivelr. The average change along the entire mid.area belt, from Five-mile Point to the mouth of the Schuylkill River, by way of Petty's Island (north) channel and Windmill Island (west) channel, is an increase of depth of 1.642 feet. The change in the same belt by way of Petty's Island (south) channel and Windmill Island (east) channel is an increase of 1,759 feet. The changes in the maximum depth lines from Five-mile Point along the Philadelphia shoro to section p, in sketch A, where a junction takes place, is an increase of 1.12 feet. For the belt along the Jersey shore, ru:i far as section p in sketeh A, there is an increase of 2.33 feet. From Gloucester, section p, the average change in the maximum depth belt, as far as the Schuylkill, shows aii average shoaling of 0.29 foot. The change in the maximum depth belt for the entire distance-Five-mile Point to the mouth of the Schuylkill River, on the Philadelphia shore-is an increase of depth of 0.68 foot, and br war of the Jersey side of the stream, an increase of depth of 1.54: feet. · In the foregoing comparisons I have confined myself to the present limits of the river, as defined by its present shore and wharf lines. All of which is respectfully submitted. HENRY L . .MARINDIN, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

SUPPLEMENT TO REPORT DATED NOVEMBER 15, 1880, ON THE CHANGES IN THE DELAWARE RIVER IN FRONT OF PHILADELPHIA. BOSTON, MASS., December 9, 1880. In the accompanying tables, Nos. 3 t.o 10, are given, :first, in Table 3, the widths of the stream at high and low water for the years 18:!3 and 1878. These widths are measured on the cross-sections on which current obscrvatiorni were made in 1878, and the positions of which are accurately descril1ml in Professor Mitchell's report, printed in Appendix No. 9 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1878. Fifty-six of these cross-sections were measured between Five-mile Point and the mouth of the Schuylkill l{,iver, distributed as follows: Tliirty.seven sections in the main stream, six in Petty's Island (north) channel, seven in the south channel, and three in each of the Windmill Island channels.· Tlie mean changes in the width in certain reaches of the river, from. Table 3, and the c11rresponding changes of superficial area, from Table 4, are as follows-(it may be here stated that the areaioi giYen in Table 4 were not derived from the measurements given in Table 3 1 but were measured wit.h a planimet.er on the original sheets of the two sun'eys): The three cross-sections between Five-mile Point and Petty's Island give an increase of width at high-water of 43 feet, and a mean increase of the same at low. water of 287 feet. This large increase at low-wafa:1r is mainly due to the measurement on section 1, which happens to pass over a spur of the low-water strand. The areas from Table 4 do not show so large an increase as the above measurements would call for~ the high-water stage has increased 449,600 square feet, or li per cent., and the low-wa!Rr only 246,400 square feet, or three-fourths of one per cent. In Petty's Island (north) channel there has been a diminution of width for both high and low water stages, respectively, 362 feet and 254 feet. The high-water area shows a loss of 11935,2011 square feet, or 7~ per cent., and the low-water a decrease of 228,600 square feet, or Slightly in excess of one per cent. In the south channel of Petty's Island a decrease is given for both stages; 202 feet for high,

*for position of tb.ll!W crose-11eotions1 see Sketch B (No. 43) ·.

UNITED ST.ATES CO.AST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

117

and 44 feet for low water width. This is deri>ed from the measurements of ten crosR-Rections. The high· water area has diminished 431,120 square feet, or 1~ per cent., but the low-water area i:iliows an increase of 36,000 square feet, or one-tenth of one per cent.; the seeming disagreement he. tween the measurements of the sections aud the areas as given in table 4 is owing t-0 the fact that the cross-sections are few in umnber, and fall, in the last case, just where a decrease of wicltll occurs at low-water. From Petty's Island to Smith's Island, the diminution of width is large and general, rnrying from 55 feet on cross-section 17 to 1,010 feet on cross-section ll'i, no case giving an incn·ase of width. Tbe a>erage from nine cross-sections gives :H5 feet decrease for high-water and ;{91 feet for low-water. The areas in this reach of the river show a loss for each stage--for high-water, 2,24-7,200 squa,re feet, or 8~ per cent. of the original area, and for low-water, 1 1911,400 <1quare feet, or 7.6 per cent.; the encroachment ha8 heeu made chiefly along the New Jersey shore, at and l>elow Cooper's Point. In the west channel of Windmill Island the high-water stage shows a diminution of width of 120 feet, with a loss of area of 208,000 square feet, or 6~ per cent. The low-water cross-sections give a decrease of width of 74 feet, with a loss of area of 22 7400 square feet, or seven-tenths of one per cent. of the superficial area of 1843. In the east channel of Windmill Island the decrease of width, from the measurement of three cross-sections, is 557 feet for high-water stage, with a loss of superficial area of 1,200,400 square feet, or 17ft per cent. The measuremeut of the same sections for low-watr stage girns a decrease of width of 450 feet, with a loss of superficial area of 897,:WO square foet, or 15~ per cent. From the south end of Windmill Island t-0 crosfl·section No. :n, at GloncPster, the mean width shows a decrease of 594 feet for high-water, and a loss of i,:;uperfkial area of 7,118,880 square feet, or 10¥ per cent. .At low-water the decrease in width is 280 feet, with a loss of area of 4,170,680 square feet, or Si per cent. From Gloucester to the east end of League Island, comprising the whole of the Horseshoe shoal, aml the widest part of the river yet examined, there has not been any marked change in width at high-water, the area showing an increase of 407 7520* square feet, or about one-half of one per cent. The low-water width has increased considerably, the measurements on cross-sections 38 to 42 giving an average of 284 feet, and the superficial area an increase of 1,272,320 square feet, or 2i per cent. .Along the frontage of League Island the width has decreased 33 feet for high-water stage and 71 feet for low-water; this is derived from the measurement of fi're cross-sections. The area at high-water shows a loss of 54,400 square feet or seven-tenths of one per cent., and at low-water the loss is 409,280 square feet or 1.3 per cent. These last measurements bring the examination to the mouth of the Schuylkill River at cross-section No. 47 of 1878. The general change over the entire distance from Five-mile Point to the mouth of the Sehu_ylkill, embracing the channels around Petty's and Windmill Islands, as de.riYed from fifty-six cros::;sections, is a diminution of width of 312 feet at high·water and a similar change of 155 feet at lowwater. The change in superficial area is a lo8s of 12,337,080 square feet or slightly in excess of -!} per cent., and for low-water aJso a loss of 61079,840 square feet, or slightly in excess of 2!} per cent. In Table 5 will be found the changes in the volume of the tidal prism for certain diYisions of the river. In making the computation the strand between high and low water was regarded as an inclined plane with a mean depth of 3 feet, but the depth over the low.water are.a was the full rise of tide equal to 6 feet. The loss in the tidal prism between Five-mile Point and the mouth of the Schuylkill is 56,1901760 cubic feet, or 3~ per cent. Tables 6 to 10 gi\'e comparisons of cross-sections at five points between Brideslmrg and Smith's Island. They conta41 the area of cross-section in 1843 and 1878 with the position of the line of mid-urea. In the cross:section off Bridesburg, Table 6, the mid-are~· line indicates a, shift of the whole stream towards t,he Peunsylvania shore. In the Five-mile Point 1mction, 61500 feet below the former, the mid-area line indicates a movement of the stream in the opposite direction towards the New Jersey shore.
·This area i11 a. close a.pproxima.tion, as the high-water shore-line is missing for a short distance on the Jersey shore, near Big Timber Creek, survey of 1843.

RBPOBT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

In Table 8 is a crosR-section on a bar in the north channel of Petty's Island off Richmond; the mid-area line inclkates a shift of the stream towards Petty's Island. Table 9 coutaim1 a cross-section in the south channel, also, over a bar oft' the western end of Petty's Island; in this section the mid-area line indicates a movement of the stream of .210 foot towards the Camden shore. Table 10 givm; a cross-section between Cooper's Point and Smith's Island; bere the mid-area line indicates a shift of the stream of 108 foet towards the New Jersey shore. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, HENRY L. MARINDIN, Assistant, Coast ana Geodetic Survey.

REPORT OK Co:'.llPARISON OF SCRVEYS OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN THE VICINITY OF CUBITT'S GAP BY II. L. MARINDIN, ASSISTANT.

BOSTON, MASS., Ap1·il 22, 1880. Sm: A comparison of surrn~·s of that part of the Mississippi Hiver lying between the head of tlie l'm;se:-;, hmisiaua, aud a lin6 acrnss the rfrer ahont 4,000 feet above the north point of" Cubitt':-; Gap,'' has just been completed, and I have tl1e lt011or to forward it in :wcOl'dance with rour call of April 12, 1880. Begiuning at a lilw 4,000 feet above the north point of "Cubitt's Gap," to a line acros.'> the rh·er at the south poiut, we have two 111irveys for cornparisou, both by the Coast SurYey-one in 1l'i2, h,Y Assistant Granger, and the other iu 18iG by a party m1der my charge. · This <'.Omparisou showri a shoaling· on both banki'i of the stream and a marked deepening along the center of the river aud toward;.; the right bank (wmit shore). Taking the whole area under consideration there has hePH a <leepening of 1.i feet in the four years, or OA foot per ;vear, in that part of the rivf\r a hove the "Gap," aud a mean shoaling of tl..'i foot in the same time, or 0.12 foot per year, iu that part of tlw river directly in frout of the "Gap.'' A noticeable foatnre in front of the "Gap,'' and one which, in a great measure, must be traced to it as its cause, is the formation of a fiat on the west hank, a;; showu by the deep contours-the 2±-foot curve more especially-starting at a point on tlle west shore, 0,000 feet above the ''Gap/' where all the curves run parallel to the shore, and where the 24--foot cune is 260 feeL from the :1-foot cnr>e, which I haYe taken as thereference, for convenience, being smoother than the shoreline, although running parallel to 'it. The 24-foot curve abruptly juts out towards the center of the river, till, opposite the north point of the ''Gap,'' it is 820 feet from the 3-foot cmve; then, follow. ing down stream, and opposite the south point, it is 920 feet; then, after passing the opening of "Cubitt's Gap,'' it retreats towards the ;;l1ore-li11e, so that ahout ~,000 feet below the south point it is 760 foet, 4,000 feet below it is 7:20 feet off, alHl 8,000 feet below the "Gap" it is only 500 feet off, 11otwithritamli11g tile gradual expansion of the .Mississippi, which at the upper limit is 3,7!.lO feet in width, and at the lower limit, 8,000 feet below th~ '' Gap," it is 4,815 feet in width, as measured lJetween the ;).foot coutour of each bank. :From the south point, for a distance of about 1,300 feet down stream, the two surve~'S compared are one of l86ti and the otller of 18i(i, which give a mean shoaling of 1.6 feet in ten years, or o.rn foot per year. From the above-mentioned limit, 1,800 feet below the south point of "Gap," to Oubitt's house, we haYe two imrveys for compa.ris011, one executed by Assistant Gerdes, and the other by my part~ in H!77, giving an interrnl of eleven years; over this space there has been a mean shoaling of :rn feet, or 0.3:l foot per year. From C11hitt'11 house to the Head of' the Passes, including all the sp~e now covered by the works for the imprevement of the channel-way into South Pass, we have two surveys again-one of 186t>, by Assistant Gerdet-;, and one done under my direction in 18rn, hy Subassistant Braid; these smTeys show a decrease in depth of a.G feet in nine ;\'ears, or 0.4 foot each year. Where, however, the present jettietl channel into South Pass is located, there has been a. decided deepening. The accompanying Table 1 gfres the comparison of the different surveys in detail, by dividing tlw surface of the river into squares of 10" latitude by 10" longitude, and giving the mean depth in that area as obtained by the sum of all the Roundings over this space. Tahlc 2 gives the position of the flat in front of "Cubitt's Gap," as delineated by the 24-foot contour, with a reference also to the width of the river at that place. Table:~ gives a cross.flection of the rh'Pr at the south point of "Cnbitt's Gap." This section

begins at the west shore and follows one of the sounding-lines of the survey of 18GG, aml is com. pared with the survey of 1876. It lies somewhat diagonally across the stream. Tlw comparison sbows an a>erage shoaling of 1.2 feet in teu years, or 0.12 foot irnr ~-ear, a decrease iu depth of 3 per cent. Table 4 gives a cross-section of the river about l~ miles below "Cnbitt's Gap.'' This shows a mean shoaling between 1866 and 1877 of ~3.4 feet, or 0.31 foot per year, a decrease of 10 per cent. Table 5 gives another sedion across the wide part of the river at the Head of Passes, at a point below "Cubitt's house." It begins at the west shore and runs on a line of soundings of the survey of 18GG, and is compared with the survey of 1875; the section ends at the east shore, uear tlw south end of the Mississippi Base. This section shows a decrease in depth of 4.4 feet iu uiue year;.;, or 0.4.3 foot per year, a decrease of nearly 1 'i per ceut. There is no change in the width of the river between "Cnbitt's Gap" and the PasseR, as shown b.r the 3-foot and ti-foot cnrYm1, although the bml of the stream shows a sligl1t bodily shift to tl1e eastward. In all cases, dnriug this comparison, where the souudings of the earlier surveys-which arc not as numerous as in the more recent smTeys-fe!l between elose liues of soundings, the cornpamtin' depth was obtained by grouping the surrounding somHlings of tile later surve,v. A sketch of the locality, showing the area8 covered by the comparison, iis ·appended. Respectfully suhmitte<l. HENHY L. l'tfARINDIN, A11sistant, Coa11t a.iul Geodetic Burvc:y.

REPORT ON GEODESIC LEVELING ON THE MISRiflfHPPI RTYEH.
BY ANDREW BRAID, ASSISTANT.
UNITED STATES COAST AND GF.ODF.TIC SURVEY OFFICE,

Wa,sltington, D. C., .'1pril G, 1881. DEAR SIR: In accordance with your instructions of Septemher '.!8, 1880, I proceeded to Batuu Rouge, where the schooner Quick was fitted out and a party organized. The previous season's work terminated at Fort Adams, Miss., but on account of the unsatisfac. tory results of the river crossing at Red River Landing, it was deemed adYisable to re-ruu the portion of the. work between those two places. Work was therefore commenced at Red River Landing Xovember 10, but instead of following the same course as last year, the line was continued along the west bank of the river until nearly opposite Fort Adams, where a hetter place for the crossing wa8 fountl. The width of the river at this point was 790 meters instead of 1,370 meters, as in the previous crossing. The lower stage of the river, moreover, giving the line of sight an elevation of O\'Pl' 1.5 feet above the surface of the water was highly advantageous, as was also the cloudy weather with wbich we were favored. Simultaneous observations were made in oppositk directions b~- l\fr. Isaae 'Yinstou and myself, and then the observers exchanged stations and repeated obsenatious. The following tabulation of results I quote from lllJ November (1880) report. Stations A aud B (in the accompanying illustration) are the positions of the instruments, tlw former on the west bank and the latter on tbe east bank:

"The tide-gauge method on the contrary, assuming tlw water t-0 h:we tlte same level on \10th sides, would indicate R. 1\f. l!i7 to lm Uie l1iglter hy om.0297, a 1lifforp11ee 01' ii~ CPHtinwters from Ow result by spirit-leveling-. The spirit leveling result is in this case undoubted!~· correct, and the discrepancy, therefore, is due to the differt>.uce of lt>vel of tlte surfaces of the water at T aud T 1 · This hecomes evident when we examine the currents and find them ro1111ing iu opposit-e directions, there being a strong eddy on tlie eastern side. The surface of the wat-er on that side must therefore be the higher. An inequality of the same kind must lmve exh;ted at the erossing of la.st Ma~· , at Red River Landing, for upon connecting "·ith the terminal B . .M. (XT,IX) of last s<·ason, I fiud its height to be nearly 9 f',entimeter!'i (0. 111 0893) less than then computed." (A revision of computations with corre~tion for inequality of pivots applied give!'! 0"'.0907, which is practically the same.) "The former computation depends entirely on the tide·gauge result8 of the :May crossing, tbe spiritleveling observations being rejected on account of tlieir wide range.'' l now find, however, tltat tbe latrer, notwithstanding their discordance, give a me.an result nearer the truth than the adopted one. If we take the observations of May 8, 10, and 11 (days on which observations in both dirertions were obtained), we will lia\·e four !«'ts in eac11 direction, eaeh set r,ousisting of IO to 12 repe· titions.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF TI!E

This makes the result at the terminal B. M. (XLIX) agree very clearly with this se.ason's result, but under the circmustances I consider such close agreement acci<lental, as the means fur the different days are all different, and have a range of 15 centimeters. . . . . "The benchmarks of the east side of the river, from Red River to Fort Adams, can be corrected by subtracting +om.0907 from their computed heights, as we know their relation to B. M. XLIX, the height of which bas been re-determined. "The following is a list of the bench-marks thus aff!'cted, with their heights (as per office computation) and corrections applied thereto:
B. M. XLVI = +13m.6412 - Om.0907 = +13m.5505. B. l\L XLVII = +i2m.3812 - om.0907 = +12m.2905. B. M. XLVIII = +21m.2670 - Om.0907 = +2lmJ76:':.

B. M.

XLIX = +1sm.1017 - om.0907 = +lsm.0110, result as re-determined.

As these bench-marks now form no part of the main line, they may be treated as a branch line or discarded entirely." This subject was fully treated in my November report, but for ccinveniencP of reference I have reproduced the essential portions here. The weather during the season was unusually ball, and the roach; consequently very had also, which made the progress of the work both slow and laboriom;;. A junction was r1focted with l\Ir. Weir at a point about 4 miles south of Sriint JwwpL":-:i, Tensas Parish, Louisiana, January HI, after which, in accordance with instructions, the vessel was taken t,o Algien; and laid up. .Mr. C. A. Snow was left on board as ship-keept>r, he hadng sened iu the same capacity when the ve8se1 was laid up at Baton Rouge. The distance surveyed during the sea~;uu, including tl1E> branch to the Fort Adams benchmark, is 1701 kilometers (lOG miles), aull tlte total distance ot' tlte junction B. l'tl. (LXXUJ) (exclu· .~foe of branch to Fort. Adams), from Carrollton, is 470.7 kilometer;.;, or 2!1'.! miles. Hs heigLt ahm·e B. l'tl. I at Carrollton is 181".8'.!tiO, and the final diRagrerrnent of liUPfl A au<l B = .'J.4m111 · A completP list of the· ben<>h-markR of thif4 !4eaflon, with their relative height>: arnl distauces, . will a-0company this report. The permanent or "primary'' be11e11-m:uks an~ indicate<] by the Boman numerals, aud the temporary ones by the Arabic. The primary marks are usually granite or nmrhle posts set in the ground, with their tops projecting tbret' or four inches abon· the surface and beariug the inscription-

The instmment used is the samr as l1eretofore used· hy me on the Mississippi Rh·er work, and also on the trans-continental linP of levels, viz, Geodesic Micrometer-level, No. 1. This im1tmment, originally made by W urdemanu, bas been much improved at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. The accornpa11ying illustrations (NOR. 4G and 47) will render clear the following brief' description: Tlw t:clescope is mounted in ri.ngs, and can be turne,<l ahont it~ optical axis. A vertical micrometer-s<m'W is mounted !W t11at the eye-end of telescope can he elevated or depressed, thus measuring the small angle betwt-en the horizon and target. 'fhe center of motion is below the object end Y of inl'ltrument. 1'he 1·ccentricity thus produced would prevent the use of the micrometer for· thP measurement of angles of any eonsiderable size, on acuount of the variable value of a turn, but in pra-0tice. the angle measured seldom exceeds five to ten divisions (22" to 44") of the screw, so "that the effect of the eccentricity is inappreciable. The striding lt>vel is loose and reversible, thus admitting of elimination of level adjustment error. One division of level= 511 .29; one division of micrometer screw = 4" .43; magnifying power

::lfE'I'HOD OF OB:,>EHYING.

Various methods ha\·e heen tried, such as running the liue forward aml theu ba,ckward, reading the bubble oflewl instead of micrometer bead, using the latter simply as a pointer, &c.; but the method finally adopted all combining the greatest accuracy with the least outlay of time is ail follows: '.l'wo lines are run si111ulta11t>ouHl~·, witli tlu· rods usually at different distances from the instrument, aml to pl'event the gradual acnmmlation of error, supposed to be due to runuing constantly in one directiou, alternat,e sections are run in oppoi-lite directions. Each statiou of the instrument therefore contains two backsights and two for1\;;ights. In station:; 1, 3, 5, &c., rod A, backsight, is invariably read firnt, then rod B, bacbight, thPll rod A, foresight, and, fiually, rod B, foresight. Jn stations 2, 41 6, rod B takes precedellce of A i11 hoth hack and fore sights. If 4 rods !'Ould be used the mean time of obserrntiou of hacksights coultl lie 1uacle to agree with that of foresights by observing one back:sig11t, tlieu both foresights, a11d, finally, seeond back;;ight ; and at the next station t11e order could reversed so as to begin aml eud with a foresight. This would U11doubtedly he the most perfect system: it would necessitate two extra i·odmen, hut sona>thing would be gained in accnracy aml also iu time. To attempt to carry this method out with 0111.'· 2 rods would involve a great lrn,;s of time, as the rodme11 would baye to walk over the whole distam·e seY · eral times. Moreover, the changes in refraction during the extra. time cornmmed at a lltatiou would probably introduce sufficient enur t.o 1110rP than counterbalance any benefits derived from the system. Each fore and back sight. contains four readings of" horizon," and four of "t.m·get," which S. Ex. 12-18

are derived. as follows, the instrument, of course, being first adjusted and leveled, and the target placed approximately in the horizontal plane of the telescope: 1st. The eye end of bubble is brought to a given scale division (the selection of which depends on length of bubble, which :should be nearly central) hy means of micrometer screw, and the micrometer reading is recorded in column "horizon.~ 2d. By means of micrometer, bisect central white line of target and record micrometer reading in column " target." 3d. Reverse level. Repoint on target and record as before in "target" column. 4th. By means of micrometer screw bring object end of bubble to the same scale division a!! before, al1d record micrometer reading in column "horizon." 5th. Invert telescope about its optical axis and repeat step 4th. 6th. Bisect target and record reading in "target" column. 7th. Reverse level to original positi(Jll and repoint on target, recording as before in "target" column. 8tl1. Repeat step 1st and record in "horizon" column.

The distance is derived hy observing the number of scale divisions of rod included between the middle and outer cross-hairs, the angular distance of said cross-hairs being known. The height of the target on the rod is read lly the rodman from the brass and ivory scales before mentioned, and bis reading checketl by tlrn obsernir or bis aid. The temperature is also noted. The mean of the four "target'' reading:s, minus the rneau "horizon" reading 1 gives the value iu terms of the micrometer screw of the inclination or deviation of the target from the true horizontal line. This is reduced to linear measurement and appliecl as a correction to the rod reading. The other corrections to he applied are for inequality of pivots, curvature, and refraction and temperature. Resulting heights are, of course, derived by the usual formulae Backsigh~foresight.

The history of the Mississippi l{iyer affords an epitome of the history of that portion of the continent embraced within the United States. Its headwaters rise in the oldest Azoic rocks, near the line of Driti1:1h America, frorn the springs and lakes of Minnesota, and its affluents drnin the wcsteru slope of tile Appalachian water-shed as well as the eastern side of the Rocky }\fountains. It 11as excarnted its bed through the Paleozoic rocks of' Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Kl'11tucky. Its uau"ks ill these States arc mostly composed of sandstone and limestone, which liaw confilwrl the waters to a comparatively narrow channel. But, below the mouth of the Ohio, in latitude 3fiO ~8 , and ill(leed above, at Cape Girardeau, in latitude 370 20', softer material allows the stream greater latitude, and we fiud that as soon as the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks begin tu appear, the ri\·cr bas at dift't>rent times spread out over much wider area. From Cairo, in latitude 370 00', to the Gulf of l\1exico, in latitude ~9° 00', tlie successive elevations of tile continent have brought to the surface the rocks of different periods in Mesozoic and Caenozoic times in rt>gular arrangement, with the mouth of the Mississippi River as a. center, in approxi· matel;v coucentric circles, or perhaps more accurately stated as the sides of a triangle whose apex is near Cairo, in latitude 37° 00', and whose base is the Gulf shore, in about latitude·29° 00'. Thus we find the Ci·etaceous rocks extending from the vicinity of Cairo, southeastward to Alabama all(l Georgia, wiiere tlit-;y terminate on the east side of tlie Mississippi, and through Arkansas to aud through Texas on the west side. The Tertiary rncks extend next to these on both sides of the river, and border the Mississippi bottom or lands snhject now to overflow as far south as Chicot, La., iu latitude 33° 00' on the west, arul Fort Adams, Miss., in latitude ;no O.J' on the east side of the river. The Quaternary clays bor!ler the Gnlf from these points southward, and are said to extend some distance beneath the waters of the Gulf as sea bottom before the deep wate1· sets in. Immediatelr beneath these clays, but overlying the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, we find an extensive deposit of sand and :pebbles, extending from Cairo to the Gulf, which corresponds in geological time with the great Drift period of the States north of the Ohio, and which probably resulted from the melting of the g·laciers which strewed the bowlders and deposited the cla;ys and sands over the surface of the Northern States. The rounded forms of these pebbles a11d sand grai11s indicate their removal by a rapidly fl.owi11g current. By their griHcling aetion, as ·well as the force of the current which bore tliem along, a deep 1msil1 11as been cut out in the rocks of Cretaceous and Tertiary age, from Cairo to th"' Gulf, and this basin has afterwards been filled above the gravel and pebbles which coveretl its bottom b~ two distinct materials-the lower ouc a stiff clay formed in still water, the upper a fine silt, which shows no eYidence of stratification, and must have been deposited from water free from any appre· ciable current. \Vhile the clay has only been recognized as far north as Uolumlms, Ky., in latitude 360 47', the silt or loess has been traced as far as Sioux City, Ia., in latitude 420 33', and nearly to Fort Pierre, I>ak., in latitude 440 23', of uniform texture aml chemical composition, and with physical features so similar, that specimens from Sioux City cannot be distinguished by theeye from those found in the bluff at Fort Adams, in latitude 31° Oi:i', or Baton Rouge, in latitude 300 27', where this stratum terminates to the southward.

·while the Mississippi Ri·er was filling up with calcareous silt, the wide hed er<1tletl by tht> glacial stream, there was forming around the coast of the Gulf a marshy deposit of blue cla~T' wliid1 is now exposed at Port Hudson, on the Mississippi I:hTer, in latitude :wo 40': a]J(l eastwanl to l\fobile, aud west\\Tard from Chicot to Victoria, Tex. Thesi1 seem to ha>e been clost'ly relatP<l, though succeRsive deposits, from the fact tlrnt, at the charaeterii\tic outcrop at rnrt, Hndson, ilw ealcarcous silt is rcpla<·ed by a yellowish, sandy hardpan, with no 1wrceptiule liue of separation, while lower down, at Garig's ferry, on the Amite Hiver, near the junction of tltc Oomite, the hardpan becomes whifoih and more clayey, and lower down agaiu passes gradually into a light blue, sandy cla~-, which represents the blue clay found in the banks of tlw l\Iississippi, and as far eastward as 'roodyille, about twenty mileR from Fort .Adams. ]n the sections made between Lake Borgne and the )Iississippi Hiwr an alternation of sa1Hls ;111d cla;ys takes place, jm1t Ruch as we see now during a single season of high and low water 011 the rh'er; sands and clays deposited alternately, according to the rapidity or slowne,.;s of th(· current. A suhsequent elevation of the southern portion of the )fissh;sippi Yalley lla:> l'ani\ed the rin'r to make a new bed, en tting down into the silt, and in the cours;e of ages it ha,.; n·mon~d again th i,; light material, excepting a narrow strip along the bluff 11ow bonlering- tl1f' ''bottom" from )fem phis, in latitude 3iP O!l', along the edge of the Yazoo" bottom" to Yiek~bnrg-, ~atchez. arnl Baton B< mgl', in latitude :~oo 27' on the west, ancl Crowley's Hidge from the )Iissouri line, in latitude ;me 0()1 to Helena, in latitude 34° 32', aIJ(l some isolated spots, suf'h as Sicily J,.;larnl, ia Louisiana. The riYer has diminished in vohune. until at present it only occupies a betl about one rnilP iu witltli, which i::; constantly changing, and nrny haYe moYed its location from one side to tl1e otlwr of it;; ba;;in, ori).\"inally forty miles in width at Memphis. The melting of the 81lOW on the It!wk,r )lmrntaiu~. togNher with the accumulated water from the win terrains, cause,~ it to oYerfiow its pre1'eut ha11ks, :1 wl tl1er" is an annual deposit of allu>ium extending from the banks across to the bluffs or hig:hlilmls, which border what is known as the" J\Iississippi Bottom.'' This allm·ial dqlosit Yaries with the rnatPrial' brought down by tlie current, but is generally sand or cla~T· The day is some.t.imes hlne, s0111eti1111·K green, and again, as along Hell Hiver and bt:low, it is red. Although there is so great a difference i11 the tenaeit~· of the clay arnl tlH' s:m1L the pti\\·er ol th1· current of the river is such that it seems to cnt them with equal easc, in cl1anging irs hP1l, h,\ w:1~l1ing out the lower strata of sand, and undermining the ha ah, so that acres often fall into th<> stream at once. Within the last twenty years, under my own obscr-vation, the rin1r has cut away a milt· of oue bank, and made a deposit of a mile on the opposite side, uow oYergrown with willow au!l poplar. At lfodne;r, in latitude 310 52 1, wl1ere I lautled from a steamPr hy ;1 plauk into a ,;tort> m lS<iO, a sand har has formed, making the lan!ling two miles from tlm ,.;ame stort~ i11 1880. ~ot man,\T ~·e;u·s have passed since boats landed at the foot of the bluff on which Vicksburg stands; last .n·;n tlw city had two miles' travel between it and the riYer landing, awl a hatture formed in front of tht· olll landing fully a mile in width. At another point I lrnve seen a small ditch dng l!cross a narrow neek of land half a mill' wide. which connected the points at which the river had ap11roaelled itself at tlte extremt·s of a heud 27 miles in length, and during one ornrfiow the current lwgan passing through this ditd1, and before the river fell again a passage had been forme<l large enough to carr~- the largest stPamers. This is now the main bed of the river, while the two euds of the bed haYc been silted np so as to form a. lake 25 miles in length and crescent-shaped. Similar changes haYe happened repeatedly within the recollection of those now liYing, so that we may easily believe tliat if tile bed bas been changed 9 miles from west to east in ten years it may h:we moved 40 in any half century, auu thus passed from one side of the "bottom" to the other. The materials of the banks from :l\Iemphis sonthwar<l are mostly the clays and marls of the Tertiary until we reach Vicksburg, ou the cast.em side, where a bed of Tertiary limestone has checked the current; and again at, Grand Gulf, in latitutle 320 02 1 , we find a Grand Gulf sandstone, which has camictl another curve in th<' course of the river. At Fort Adams, in latitude 310 05', a claystone has again offered an obstacle to its free flow and turned it westward. On the west side it has had free course, uuless tLe limestone outliers of the Cretaceoqs ridge extendmg from Northern Louisiana to the Five Islands on the Gulf may have

'L'lie largest of the pebbles rarely exceed four inches in diameter. Occasionally ronmled fragments of tlie sandstone of the coal measures may be detected, and, in a f1'W in8taueel4, l ha,·e found 11ieees of thP millstone grit much.larger tban _the pebbles. Hut the most interesting portiou of tlH'se materials consists in the cherty pebbles, ha\'ing an oolitic struct· lll'e, that )!i\·e intelli}t'miel' of the origin of the beds in wl1ich the,y are contained. I haYe stated that in tl1e lowc·r group of ('arltonifero11s roeks there are hells of chert that are in structure oolitic. It i.s the ruins of thc:-w that l1an fumisllt'd the oolitic pebbles. Ilornstoue aurl agate also occur i11 these hc<ls, a]l(l are 1loulitless tlw origin of the pebbles of tliesc miuerals. The <legradatitlll of the conglomerate of the rnillsto11\' .!!.Tit of the Yallcy has also eontrilJutetl quartz and other siliciou,; materials. But w<e nn· iiot left altogether to infer from identity of mineral composition that tlw loo:,;c materials that coYPr the surface around Tuscaloosa have travelled from north to south from 100 to l;iO miles, for we can trace the ,-ery path they travelled by the monuments they han lr·ft behiud thorn on their journe~-. Along .Tones's Yalley beds of pebbles ma;r he traced in spots beyornl the influence of au:r c1rnse now iu operation that could place t,hem there. Auel almo"t i11 the strt>ets of Elyto11 Dr. Earle directed my attention to a low and narrow ridge composed of these materials; iHld to this that I have found at Tuscaloosa in these beds fossil corals, ancl amon)! tlll~m a Rpt,eie:,; of strombodc.~, a earboniferons fossil, anrl I think there can be but little l'isk in sbtting that tJI(~ umteri;l\,.; of thPse beds ha\·e tnrnilrnl at least from the lower edge of Blount County, a (listanct' of 70 miles. Within a very few years tlH·y haYe again taken up their line of march and are flrnt hastening· on their downward course from Tuscaloosa. Tons are transported 1o the riyer by C\'ery shower of rain, and the only wonder is, that the navigation of the · 'Warrior has not long ago bN'll impeded by this Yast accumulation that is taking place in its bed. " · " 1 am obliged to condude that the beds aronud Tuscaloosa are newer than the Eoceue Tert ial'y of the State." Again, iu his second report, p. 144, 18,)8, he says: "They are round on the hif,!:ltest ele.nitiom;, aml are strewell along the valleys. Across the middle of the State awl 11orth of the Yerge of the Cretaceous rocks they are found in greatest force. Tuscaloosa stands upou these beds, as <lo the cities of Columbia, S. O., Peter1ilmrg and Richmond, Ya. Washington and Baltimore have also their foundations on these &trafa."

The deposits everywhere show the action of water; they are often ollliqucly laminated, and sometimes beds of clay occur between the strata of sand and pebbles, indicating a short J·criotl of repose in the agitated waters. North of the paper.mill at Tuscaloosa, a bed of swamp-mull J feet thick outcrops at the lmse of a hank, in a raxi11e coYeretl hy a stratum 20 or 30 feet in thickness, of the usual material of these lleds. The remains of grass, charred wood, compressed stems of woody plants, and the elytne of insects, are found abundantly. I ltave elsewhere mentioned that these are umong the newest beds of the State, excepting the alluvial, now in process of formation, lint I hesitated about referring them to any particular period. I now think tltat the~- belong to the dr~ft, although having but few points of resemblance to that formation at. the north. There, cou. sitlerahle deposits are thrown together containing large, augular, and roun1led masses of rock that could scarcely have resultetl from the actio11 of water alone: here, the largest of the rounded fragments seldom, if ever, exceed 6 inches iu diameter, and there nrc llo angular masses, excepting in the instances that I haYe mentioned, and the action of water in motion is ever,ywhere impressecl upon one as tlte sole transporting force. A re111arkallle feature in the tlistrilmtion of this formation is its appearing in greatest force parallel with tltc Tertiary plane of the Cnited States, and crossing t11e ri\ers at their fall:-;. These IJeds are indeed scattered farther south, but their greatest accumulation takes place herr, the thicknes11 being oftm 100 feet. If the southern drift be at all connected with that of tlie north, it may be explained by sup. posing that the northern glaciers suddenly melte!l, and that the water thus liberated in immense ,-olume took a southern direction, carr~·ing with it the d1;bris torn from the surface oYer which it passed, until it met the Tertiary sea, upon the shores of which its burden was deposited. It is tlifficult to suppose that any force acting upon harll silicious fragments for so short a time as that necessary for t,heir transportation from north to south would so completely round and polish them, and if we suppose these materials to haw~ heeu alrea<ly water-worn and scattered over the surface, and that they were merely brought together by thi:-; force, still one would suppose that a very considerable quantity of angular fragments would also be torn up and transported with the rest, which is not the case. But after all, we know too little of tlie grinding force that ma~- be exert('d u.r a mass of loosli materials 100 feet i11 tlticknesli', when in motion. This theor,Y would sufficiently well account for that enormously long ridge of drift exteiiding parallel with the Atlantic coast; for, the moment the current entered the Tertiary sea, its wlocity would he checked, and the grnatcr part of the transported detritus deposited. It eau be dernonstratetl that this accumulation took place at a time when, if our southern riYers existetl at all, they did not occupy their present beds, for they haTe almost all cut through the drift, after its tleposition. In supposing that the drift wal' 11Pposited on the margin of the Terti.ir,y Rea, tl1e difficulty meets us that in the southern drift we have no marine remains, nor in truth organic remains of any sort beyond the silicified woo1l already mentioned, and yet beds of clay and fine sand are deposited in a manner that indicated a period of repose, and conditions favorable to the preserrntion of organic remains, if any organi::im existed in the sea. The only way by which I can account for this absence of every vestige of life i1.1. a sea that once teemed with life, is bl- supposing that, before the drift period, the bottom of this sea had heen elevated aml converted into dr~· land, and that at the commencement of tlw drift period a depression of the land took place; that the time between the influx of the sea aml the deposition of the drift was too short for marine animals even to have commenced a coloniza· tion; and that the land was again elevated into its present position and sn~jected to long-continued denudation, which produced its present configuration; that after this elevation the rivers excavated their })resent channels. It must obviously he very difficult to assign the limits of thP southern drift, for it is found scattered over the States, the materials becoming flmaller a:-; we proceed south, till they mingle with the sands on the coast, from which they cannot he distinguished. The remains of the mastodon are found on the surface, or are washed out b;r the streams.

Prof. G. U. Swallow, in Geological Survey of Missomi, p. GO, say;;: "The geological position of this formation in the series of .:\Iisisouri rocks is easily determined. That it is newer than the drift is satisfactorily proved by the faet that it rests upon the latfa~r for-

mation, when both are present and ~ndisturbed. It caps nearly all the hluffs of Hie Missouri and )lississippi within our State, forming the very highest deposits skirting their valleys. Thus while the bottom prairie occupies a higher geological horizon, the bluff is usually several hundred feet alJoye it in the topographical. "This formation when well developed usually presents a fine, pnlverulent, obsolit-0ly stratified mass of light grayish buff, siliciou:-1, and slightly indurated marl. Its color is usually variegated with deeper lJrown stains of oxide of iron. 'l'he bluff formation is often penetrated by numerous tubes or cylinder1:1, about the size or thickness of pipe stems, some larger and others smaller. They are composed of cl:t,\", carbonate of lime, and oxide of iron, being argillo-calcareous oxide of iron, or calcareous clay ironstone.''

" These anal~·ses show a striking coincidence in the composition of these widely separated formations." David Dale Owen, in .Arkansas Geological Report of 1860, p. 412, in the description of Phillips County, says: "Crowley's Ridge, which runs throngb Greene, Craighead~ Poinsett, and Saint Francia Counties, forming the divide between the waters of the Sa.int Francis and Whioo Rivers, oorminates in Phillips County, just below the city of Helena. The top of this ridge, throughout its entire ext.ent in Arkansas, is composed for the most part of silicions clay and marl of Quaternary date, usually resting on a bed of water-worn gravel." The counterplkt of Crowley's Ridge may be seen on the opposite side of the Mississippi River, at Memphis, thence running northward through the State of Tennessee and a part of Kentucky, crossing the Ohio River at Caledonia, in Illinois. In Tennessee this ridge reaches the river at the firet, second, third, and fourth Chickasaw Bluffs. In Kentucky, at Hickman, Columbus, and

It is this mern ber, cemented into a harll ferruginous conglomerate, "Which crosses the Ollio Riyer at New Caledonia, in Illinois, and forms the Grand and Little chain on that stream. Prof. Il. L. C. Wailes, in his Ueport on the Geology of ~fii::sissippi in 185 !, page 213, describe>s the Loe11s or loam. "A prominent and interesting feature, which distinguishes the counties bordering upon the Mississippi below the Yazoo, is fomul in that corniiderable deposit superimposed on the diluyial gravel, and which enters into the more easterly range of counties only along the margins of the Homochitto, Big Black, and Yazoo Hivers. Its awrage width, on the east side of the Mississippi, does not exceed 12 miles, and it is not met with at all on the western side, at least below the high lands of Arkansas. In tbe escarpment of the 1\Iississippi bluffs, and in other natural sections, it is seen frequently of the thickness of 50 or 60 feet, thinning out as ~-ou recede from the riwr, until it is lost, and the red sands and pebbles on which it rests appear upon the surface. European geologists describe it, under the name of Loess or Lehm, as an' alluvial, tertiary, sedi mcntary deposit, consisting of very fine, well-washed, yellow, calcareous loam, occurring over considerable tracts, and found reposing on every rock from the granite of Heidelberg to the gravel on the plains of the Rhine.' Here it has not the character of a local alluvium, and is probabl,Y due to tlw same causes that have spread the gravel aml pebble deposits so widely over our surface. "In March, 1846, being desirous of drawing the attention of ::'II. L;rnll, then 011 a visit to tlti:;; State (Mississippi), to this peculiar and interesting ueposit, he accompanied me on an excursiou to one of the large ravines in Adams County, where it is exposed to the depth of at least 50 fret. Speaking of the result of this examination, in his traYels, subsequently published, he remarks that the 'resemblance between this loam and the fluviatile silt of the valley of the Rhine, generally called loess, is most perfect.' Its embedded fossils are chiefly bleached helices or snail-shell" together with mammalian remains. At eYery bluff on the )lississippi, from Fort .Adams to tl1e Yazoo, and in the hills in the rear, this loam i'l> seen, and the roads leading into the interior cut jnto it deeply, and expose it on every hand." Again, on page 283, he remarks : "In the lake-marl, which occupies the lacustrine beds of the Drift period, -we find a few fossil Testacea, such as lymnea, succinea, cyclas, two species of planorbis, and a very small paludina. One species 0£ the planorbis, a very minute one, aml the paludina mentioned, are not now

found living in our waters; the others belong to existing species. The Testacea of the loess, or loam, referred to the same period, are, on the contrary, all terrestrial, embracing several species of helices or snails, all of which, it is. believed, are yet found living in different parts of the continent, although some of them seem to have diRappeared, or to have now no living reprcsentati>e in the fauna of this region. Among the species most numerous may be enumerated the Helix albolabris, alternata, ·concara, elernta, fraterna, perspectiva, prof1ou7a, thyro·ides, tridentata, &c. The great bone-bed of the Mississippi, or the depository of the extinct mammalia, is also found in the loess, the limits of which ha.-e already been defined. Throughout its extent the remains of the mastodon haYe been disco>ered." Mastodon bones haye been obtained in Bayou Sara, near Pinckneyville, in Wilkinson County; in various localities in Adams County; in Jefferson County, uear the former town of Greenville; and in '\Yarren County, in the deer) cut of the railroad at Vicksburg; and in the vicinity of Big Black Uh-er, near the eastern line of the county. In a few localities, such as the accompanying Testacea woul<l indicate to have been the bedR of fresh-water ponds or marshes, considerable portions of the skelet-011 have been found together, as if the animal may have perished there, and iu such cal'ms the bones are frequently in contact with considerable masses of a black, fatty earth, entirely dissimilar from the surrounding marl, and which ma~- rea1;onably be supposed to haYe resulted from the decomposition of the viscera and thP othl'r perishable animal matter; but most usually the bones appear detached, as if drifted into their present position, and consequently it is not unusual to fin<l a tusk, or a molar, a hone of tl1e IPg, or a joint of the vertebra, where no other vestiges an> S!~en. The most prolific localit~- of these remains is in Adams County, on Pine Ridge, in townflhips 7 and 8, range 3 west, about 6 miles north of ~atchez, where a large and deep rminc has extended its ramifications oyer an area of several miles, and which, iu its undermining progress of denudation, has heen constantly exposing these remains for more than forty years, or from a period coeYal with the first cultivation of the country through which it has its course. The hones generally lie from 10 to 20 feet below the general surface, and in the rayiue on Pine l{idg·e, tlrn remains of other animals haYe been found with them. Among these ma~- he euumeraterl those of the mcgalonyx and the tapir. Besides tllese the teeth of the fossil horse and ox are frequently fonml. Those of the bos are referred by Dr. Leidy to the Bison latifrons (fifth volume Smithsonian ContrilJ. ). I am iudehted to Dr. Leidy for the following list of mammalia:
Felis atrox. Ursu~ americanus (fossiU8). Ursus amplidens. Equus americanus. Cermi.s virginianwi. Bootherium cavijron8. Elephas primigenius. Tapir amerfoanus andfossilis. Megalonyx jefferson ii. 1lfagalony:c dissimilis. Jlfylodon harlanii. Erepted-0n priseus; JJfastodon giganteus.

Ju the report of Captain .:Vlarcy of exploration of tlle Hed Rinff in 1852, Appendix D, page 183, the statement is made that "Dr. Shumard fonnd on the Red ltiYer, 26 miles from Fort Washita, a deposit of ash-l'olored loa.m, '.!5 feet thick, containing terrestrial and fluviatile shells of the genera Vgmnea, I'T1]1sa, Planorbis, Pupa, aud Heli:r, the whole resembling species found in the loam at New Harmony, Indiana, and elsewhere in the l\Iississippi Valley. This formation along the Mississippi constitutes what are known as the 1' Bluffs," and is a flu via tile accumulation laid down by the river when the l'egion was at a lower level. In other words, it is an ancient allm·ion. Its thickness and known extent along tile :Mississippi render it very probable that it will be found along most of the principal tributaries of that ri''er. A si;nilar deposit is found along the valley of the Rhine. Its thickness is from 200 to 300 feet, and it is a yellowish gray loam, consisting chiefly of clay, combined with sand and carbonate of lime. The same deposit is found along most of the principal valleys or tributaries of the Hhine, it evidently having been contemporaneously deposited. It is known in Germany under the name of loess. The occurrence of a formation along the Red RiYer similar t-0 those described leads me to believe that it will be found along most of the rivers

.Much of the area is cowred with Hwamps awl lakes; nmeb, too, is willl and dark with heavy forests, even yet the retreat of the deer and other wild animals. Other portions, confined for the most part to a belt bonleriug the river, are iu a good istate of eultivation. The undeveloped agricultural resources of the diYiision (of Urn State) m; a whole are great, and, in proportion to its area, may make it, some <lay when itii lands shall han been reclaimed, the wealthiest part of the State. This magnificent valley plain (or bottom Yalley) is altogether, including the delta of the river, which io; but the extension of the plain into the Gulf of '.\lexico, about 600 miles loug. :Mr. G. W. R. Bayley, a ci\·il engineer of Louisiana, thrn; defines it,; limits. ''The head of the alluYial plain or delta of the Mississippi may lw assumpd as occ1uTiug wberP rock in Nitu forms both shores, or at a point some 30 milPs abme the month of the Ohio, k11mn1 aR '·The Chains.'' Tlie entire alluvion, extending theuce to the sea, comprises an area of ahout 40,000 square miles, and presents a front upon the Gulf of '.\lexico of 360 miles, 8ii miles north, and 17.'i milrs west of the rin~is mouth. Sir Charles Lyell says of the valley plain, it is \er~· niriable in width from east to west, being near its northern extremit~·, or at the month of the Ohio, 50 miles wide, at Memphis 30, at the mouth of Wllitc UiYer so, and coutraetiug again farther ;;uuth, as at Grand Gulf, to 33 mile;;. Taking high-watt·r lenl as that of the great plain, the latter attains at the mouth of the Ohio an elevation of a:.io feet above the G1llf. Considering the 1listance, the slope seaward is, there· fore, very gradual. The valley plain proper i1; bounded on thl' cast aud west respectiYely b~· t.wo ranges of highlands, approximately parallel and rising· from ;;o to 200 feet abon: the plain. These highlands generally present steep slopes or faces towards the plain, but JH't'Sel'\"(', for t11e uw;:;t part, their elevation in the opposite directiou, extending off as tahle lauds. The :l'llississippi has probably during past ages occupied snc1·essin~ly all parts of the area. At 011e day it may ha,-e washed the hase of Crowlr,Y 1s Hidge.

found a description of blue clay on the Chickasawkay Rfrer, near \\inchester, referred by him to the Tertiary, which contained roots and trunks of Cnpuliferac, Coniferae: ancl l'almea. On examination of this stratum, and making further exploratiom; in southwest Mississippi, in which the same clay was found on Buffalo Creek and other creeks in that regi@, ('t111tai11iug bones and teetl! of the l\lastodon, and on comparing these deposits again with the expo:;ure at Port Hudson and its clays, I came to tlie conclusion that ther were all of the same age, aud formed a group wl1icl1 was intermediate between the bluff and the drift, aud that there lrnd heen a more 01· less continuous stratum oYer t11e whole Mississippi bottom, and iu the ya\lt',\'S of some of the riYen; which had been remoYed in parts of the bottom b~· the action of the river. Dr. E . .A. Smith, at that time my assistant in the Mississippi survey, was diredetl to examine the Yazoo bottom, and his observations showed that in digging well,.,, after passing through the alluvium, a blue clay stratum, as much as 40 feet in thickness in places, wus uniformly penetrated before reaching water, which was found in the underl~·ing sands and pehlJles of the drift. The obseI"Yations made during the last year confirm the opinion that this stratum ltas been continuou); from Memphis to New Orleans, but has in many portions of 1he hottom lwe11 remffrnd by the river, and its place supplied by the newer alluvial deposits which now, as a general thing, form the banks of the river, and are being constantly removed, so that the lerees, which hani been built at enormous expense, require constant care for their preRerYation or frequent renewal.
PORT HFDSON.

In a paper reatl before tl!e American Association for the .Advaneement of ~cience, at Indiau. apolis, in !Mil, and published in the proceedings for th::it year, Dr. E. W. Hilgard speaks thus of the Port Hudson group, as laid down on the accompanying map (illustratiou So. 48): ''The next formation laid down on the map is the Port lludson group, of which, ho-wenr, tlle outcropping littoral portion only ifl here represented. Properly speaking, it should be showu as occupying also most of the space colored as allu-vial, since it uuderlies e>erywhere not only the marine alluyium and a portion of the Gulf itself, but also that of the 3fo;sissippi aud its chief tributaries, at least a8 high up as Memvhis, and on Reel Ri\·er nearlr, if not quite, up to Shreveport. It seems to exist equally in tbe -valleys of other large rin·rs trilmiar,r to the fTulf, notably in that of the Pascagoula, u11 to 100 miles, in a direct line, from the coast. "Ha Ying discussed this formation somewhat in detail in papers recently published, I will merely state that it. embraces a group of partly littoral aud e>ituarian, part]~- swamp, lagoon, aud fluviatile depositi;, 'rl10i;P thickness arnl location are manift·stly 111·1w111le11t npou the topographical foatures of the co11tiue11t, then (during the' Clmmplain 1 period) in progn·,.::s of slow depressiou-as shown by the nature of the deposits, and the numerous superimpost'<l gt>11eratio11s of larg1: CJ-press stumps, embedded in laminated clays, exhillit.ing the yearly fall of leavet;. These beds ornrlie those of the orange saud, or st.ratified drift, while they thcmsch·es are oYerlaiJ hy not only the riyer alluvium, but also by the loess or liluffs ilt, or its eqniYalents, al'3 well as, where this is abHent, by the yellow loam of the surface. It would se.em that here, also, tluriug the latter pl)l·tiou of tht> drift period, most of the larger river-channels WPre alrea.tl,y impressed upon the surfact>, though not always coincident with the present immediat valley, as Ne1ruerry lias obsen-ed in relation to some of the northern 1-i>ers. A depression of the land would gradually transform thest· ehannd:-; into inlets filled with more or less stagnant fresh water down to a greater or less distance from the then-existing coast-line, and thus opportunity would be afforded for the formation of the swamp and lagoon deposits, into which both the :Mississippi and Reil Rivers haYe subsequently cut their channels. The banks of the Red River, as well as-0utside the present alluvial area-those of the many JakeH antl bayous which border that Rtream, exhibit strata absolutel.r ideutical in clrnract(·r with those obse1Ted near the coast, yet, of course, totally diftereut from either the al!uyial deposits of the present time or the adjoining Tertiaries. The same holds trur, more or less, of the l\Iississippi and its migl1ty 'bayous.' According to the ollseryations of Dr. E. A. Smith, iu the Yazoo bottom, and my own in that of the Tensas, not only do the clays with cakareons concretions (as characteristic of the Port Hudson age as they are foreign to the aJluyinm of to-da,y) frequently crop out in the beds of the streams, but much of the bestlamls of the 'buckshot' kind, now situated

"These results folly confirm. therefore, the statement made by General Humphreys, that the Mississippi does not, as a rule, flow in a bed formed from its own deposits, but has excavated it in an older geological formation. ~Wells exceeding Hi or 20 feet ordinarily strike these clays throughout tl1e bottom as they do in the delta, and the analogy has been completed by the repetition of the phenomena, observed in driven wells at New Orleans, at a point ,about 50 miles above Yickshnrg (General 'Ya<le Hampton's plantation), wl1ere a tube well has furnished a copious flow of comhustiLle gas undiminiished for man~: mouths. The swamp clays form, however, only the lower 1>ortio11 of l!he Port Hudson beds. Higher up, as shown at the Port Hudson bluff, there lie yellow or whitish silts, ancl 'hard pans.' These form also a level terrace some miles in wicltl1 bordering the Tensas bottom, while high above it on the hill-tops of Sicily Island, on the Washita, lie the remnants of the Loess formation, the main body of which has succumbed to the erosive influence of the Terrace C'poeh elevation. It lias, howeYer, left a belt a few miles wide on the eastern side or the nlley, a1; 8l1orn1 1m the map. It would tlrns Reem that during· the latter portion of the period of dt'lll'Pssion the rate of sinking became at times too rapid to allow of the accumulation of swamp deposit. The i1Hluratc silts are mostly deYoid of fossils of any kind, hut are occasionally traYersed h~- ftm·iatilP beds witlt pebbles, driftwood, &c. Then there is a recurrence of the swamp deposits; tlten, again, silts; aucl finally, the calcan;ons, silty loam of the bluff formation, with its numerous terrestrial fossils and 'loess puppets' ends the deposits clearly referable to the epoch of depression. "Tl1e loerss 11ift'ers little from its eqnivaJe,nt fort her north, saYe in being utterly devoid of stratifieatiou as wt'll as of any ffnYiatile org·:rnisms. It is not easy to imagine the modus operandi by which a <leposit of this kiucl, sometimt>s 70 feet. tltick, and of (lead uniformity from top to bottom, could l,e produced. Its equivalents farther north exhibit Yery distinctly the structure resulting when deposition takes place in (gently) flowing water; at the south it was probably substantially stagnant, sa,·e as regards the tidal flow. Perhaps the latter may serYe to explain both the absence of fiuviatile aN well as mari ue life, and the uniform intermixture without any semblance of arrange· ment of material varying from the tiuPst silt to pebbles half an incli in diameter. A strong tidal waw rnnuiug np a deep inlet of thi>1 kind would naturally isweep away in its periodical rnshes many mernben; of the terrestrial fauna, whoise remains are in a marked degree the more abundant the nearer we approach to the edge of the formation. Overlying the loess we find, wherever op11ortnnit.) is afforded, a stratum of yellow loam or brick clay, which, near the larger valleys, is often as mucl1 as 15 or ~O feet in thickness. It is altogether devoid of stratified structure, as well as of fossils, and forms the isurface layer, and in most cast's the subsoil, of the Gulf States. If, as I am inclined to ht>lieve, its presence, as a connected thougl1 Yery undulating sheet on all but the most elevate1l uplands of these States, necessitates the asi-:umption of submergence, however brief, to Jhe highest level at which it occurs7 the changes of level heretofore alluded to would be shown to have exceeded by GOO to 700 feet tl1e estimate given above. "The succeeding (Terrace) epoch of elevation has not, so far as I am aware, left any marks in the way of beach lines or terraceR, unlesR the second bottoms or 'hommocks' be accounted as such. They, 110wewr, belong to a very modern epoch: for they occur on streams 110 larger than what is usually called a 'creek,' and are most marked on the smaller rivers while apparently absent from those of the largest size, such as tlie Misi-;issippi, Red, and Arkansas rivers. The elevation at which, on the very Gulf shorn, we find deposit<i of the Port Iludson age (180 feet at the Five Islands on Vermilion Ba~-) shows nevertlle1cs;; that a stnpcndons amount of erosion was accomplished during the time that the 1Iis8issippi occupied in scooping out its channel to a depth which even below the northern boundar_.,- of Louisiana cannot be estimated at less than 500 feet. As regards the modern epoch, I will remark that while in the axis of the ancient embayment the Mississippi River, through the singular instrumentality of mudlumps npheaYal, i8 rapidly pushing out the land into the Gulf waters, the latter arP neverthelPss gaining grooncl on almost the entire coast of Mississippi and Alabama, and the same is true of a portion of Vermilion Bay.

ness of the water, even where encroachme11t does take place, will necessaril;y restrict the latter within narrow limits hereafter.'' At the same meeting of the association Dr. E. A. Smith, assistant in the ~Iissisi:;ippi geologieal survey, read the following paper: "It has generally lieen assumed that the formation underlyiug tht> l\lissis,.;ippi bottom was exclusi>ely of alluYial character. (S0e Lyell's Principles of Geology, tenth Puitiou, eh. XIX, ml. 1.) On the other hand, it has been snggeskd by Geucral Humphreys (Report ou the :\lississippi lti\er, p. 9tl), that the rh'er is flowing through it (the delta region) iu a channel belonging to a geological. epoch antecedent to the present. On page SJ: 'From l\Ic5 utt, in latitude ;3;p JO', to Sunflower Ri 1rnr, iu latitude 3JO 22', underlying the Yegetahle mohl and allnYion is a stratum of dark, beaYy clay, whicli, where exposed, is called ''buckshot" land by tlie settlers trom its fancietl n·semblanct' to leaden balls wl1en it has been baked and cracked by the sun.' "Dr. Hilgard remarks (American Journal of Science, January, l.SG!J), 'The 8tHm]J :-;tratum No. 1 (Port Hudson profile), howeYer, as appears from numerous 1lata collected b_y myself, or co11tained in Humphrey's and Abbot's Report, exists at alJout tlie same level (i. e., near that of tide wate1·), not onl~- oYer all the so-called delta plain of the Mississippi, but also higher up. perliaps as far as Memphis.' ''Observations made by myself iu the Yazoo l1ottom during the last ;year le:ul to t!Je co11dnsiou tl1at the true river deposits of any considerable thickness are mostly confiueil to narrow strips of land, lying on each side of the .Mississippi, and of the bayous aml creeks that form a 11etwork of streams throughout the bottom, and to ancient channels since filled up, while a large proportion of the superficial area of the bottom, including some of the most fertile lands, is derin·d from the clays of older formations, i11to which the beds of these streams have been excan1teu. "The high or 'front land,' on the immediate banks of the streams, is at presellt ran·J?- on~r flowed. It is usua11,r a sandy loam of \'arious colors, and of rnrious degrees of fertilit~-. It supports a growth of sweet gum, honey locust, swnmp cbe:;;tnut, oak, water-oak, pecan, and cane. The growth varies with the locality and (·haracter of the loam, as may be seen better here.aft.er iu the remarks preceding the aual~·ses. Tht>ise 11 iglt lands seem to represent the true river allu ,-in m. From the ·front land' there ii' a gradual slope down towards the swamp. The soil imdl'rgoes a transition from the sand.r loam into the tenacious clays of the middle or 'back land.' Tlw latter is often overflowed during the wet season, and it supports a growth of sweet gum, oHr-cup oak, willows, and water-oak, hackbcrr_y, pecan, and cane. "The clays of the 'back larnl' doubtless belong, for the greater 1iart, to the Port Ilud.-;on age as is iudicated by the abundance of ferrugiuom; and calcareous concretions found in tllem, unlike any found in the true rh·er alluvium, as well as by the great thickness of continuons clay d1\posits. "These chlys are generall~- of a dark gray color, sometimes nearly black; again, light gra,\. traversed by cracks, and full of streaks and dots of forrnginous matter. They are Yery sticky and tenacious, aml when exposed in large masses to the atmosphere becomc covered on the surface wit!J a dull red coating of bydratc1l ferric oxide. When broken up by the plow or spade the.r crum· ble on drying into small angular blocks, of the size of a buckshot and under, giving riHc t-0 what is known throughout the bottom as 'buckshot soil.' Although t!Jese clays, as Hhown by aualysis. are generally very rich in lime, yet caleareons concretionR, so chamcteristic of the Port Hudson strata, are not always to be fouml in them. Thus I haw not observed them further south t Jiau t!Je latitude 320 52' of Yazoo City. North of that point. l1owever, the~· are of constant occnrrencl'. "The uniformity of level in the bottom may very well account for the failure to ob.~errn tlicl'<> concretions, for anything like a fair profile iH very rarely sel~ll. Tue hanks of the creeks aiul liayonR are usually of such a gentle slope, and so covered with detritus in their lower parts, that littll' of interest can be observed without much digging. As we go from the 'haC'k laud' to tl1P cnirPss swamp there is frequently very little change in the nature of the clay; arnl it. is difficult, if not impossilJle, to distinguish between the 'buckshot' clay of tlie older formations and that of the recent swamp, except where the calcareom· concretions above-mentioned collie to our aid. The clays of both formations are usually dark gray, traverserl with cracks, and full of ferruginous matter; both crumble into' buckshot;' both sup11ort a similar vegetation, except where the presence

of more or less standing water affects it. As the swamp is under water for a large part of each year, there is one alternation in its deposits between clay, leaves, and sand. One of the most characteristic sections of the J>ort Hntlsou strata observed, is on the bank of Tchula Lake, at the head of Honey l!Sland. The three uppermost strata represent the allnYium, while those below are of the true T>ort Hndsou character (see section). On the banks of the Yazoo Rh-er, not far from where the aboYe section was taken, the succession of the strata was essentially the same; but the buckshot clays, corresponding with :Sos. 4 and (i, supra,, were entire]~- full of calcareous concretions, while the ferruginous eoncretions oceurred at a lower lernl, uearl~- down to the water's edge, as ie the ease of Port Hudson. "On Lakt> BeulaJ1, latitude 33° 4D1, in Bolfrar County, the same strata appear; the clays, Nos. 4 arnl G, being full of calcart>ou::; concretions. On Panther Creek, above Yazoo City, and on a ::mrnll bayou which empties into the river at the cit~·, the same facts may be observed. "Of the stump stratum, No. 1 of Dr. Hilgard's profile, I 11:we not seen any outcrop on the banks or bayous, &c., on account of the difficulties rnentiou~d above. Logs, however, have fre q uently been struck in digging wells, though the introduction of tube or driven wells has very much impaired this source of information regarding the strata in the bottom. "For instancP, in General 'Yade Hampton's Walnut Grove plantation, near Lake Washington, in latitude 33° 05', at a depth of about 30 feet in the blue clay, which underlies the dark-gray 'buckshot' clay, a fragment of wood was found. On the same plantation, while driving a tube for obtaining \rnter, a stream of inflammable gas was observed to issue from the tube. At the time of m.'· visit there, the gas ltatl been burning uninterruptedly for three months. It escapes with considerable forl'e, and might easily be utilized on the plantation.

Below the stratum of blue clay, in which sticks, logs, &c., are found, there is a stratum of pehbles and sand, of the Orange Sand (Stratified Drift) formation. This pebble bed ii-; ver~- often reached in digg·ing wells. The depth varies Yery greatly; thus, at the mouth of a small bayou which emptiN1 into Lake Washington, on the west side, there is a bed of pebbles, as is also the case at Proffit's lslarnl, near Port Hudson, while in 8ome wells it il'i not reacl1ed at a depth of 1'.!0 feet."
WATER.

Througlwut the bottom, water is obtained either from shallow dug wells, 1fi to 30 feet deep, or by means of iron tubes driven into the ground, as deep sometimes as 100 feet or more. The water always rises in the tubes to within 30 feet of the surface of the ground-in most cases to a le\'el higher than that of" the river and streams in the neighborhood, and i11 one instance, known to me, of a well on I udian Bayou, the water stood permanently in the tube 2 feet above the surface. Generally, the water is of a decidedly mineral character, especially in the very deep wells. When the tubes have been driven no deeper than 25 or 30 feet, the water is frequently as free from a mineral taste a!'! river water, though always hard. I have made numerous analyses of the water from these driven wells, from various localities from Lower Deer Creek, in latitude 32° 401, to tlie latitude 340 23' of Friar's Point, in Coahoma County, and the composition appears to be nearl~· the same in all. The following is an analysis of the water from Governor Alcorn's place, near Jonestown, Coa· homa County. The well is 119 feet deep. The water, when first drawn, is clear and sparkling, but

SOILS.

The soils of the Yazoo bottom ma~· be arranged in fiye classes, which differ materially from each other in fertility as well as in genern1 physical properties. Their differences in the chewical composition are >erJ· strikmg, as may be seen hy :i:eference to the table. First. A light-colored sandy clay, of close texture, with a few yPllow spots. The growth upon this soil is swamp chestnut-oak chiefly, with s"·et·t gum, ash, nrnple, willow oak, and an undergrowth of cane. This Roil forms the white lands, whici1 are l'onsidcrell n'ry fertile. It occurs on Silver Creek, east of Sunflower Riwr, and on Indian Bayou, west of tlie same, and is commou in the vicinity of the Sunflower on lloth sirlPs, and forms most of the rnltinttcd lands on the ba11ks of the bayous that han~ their courses at right angles to the 81111tlowcr.

Hopkins smm; up his deductio11s from ;,bsen·atious made in Louisiana, as f(Jllows, Third Report, 1872, p. 189: 1. During a long period after the deposition of the drift, the land stood at about its present level, allowing the valleys to be cut in the drift that we now find covered by blufl" deposits, and the earth they once contained to be restratified as the foundation for the delta. This foundation reaches abo1·e the surface of the water in Catahoula and at Port Hudson, as far south as the Fh·e Islands, and was coYerecl "itlt a forest of cypress and other trees. After a time sufficient for the accumulation of four feet of shady leaf-bed about the roots of these trees, a depression began aml continued until the water leYel stood at least sixty-eight feet above its present height at Port Hudson. This would carry the area of "dead water" 272 miles up the river valley, allowing three inches to the mile as the present slope of the water in the river. So small a depression left tlie Mississippi very much such a stream as it now is, to deposit sands and clays throughout the Port Hudson period, as at present. There occurred a further movement which left the head waters of the riYer ver,r much lower than now, while apparently not sinking Louisiana more than twenty-finfeet further. The upper waters of the river then expanded into a lake-like estuary, almost without current as far as Fort Pierre, in Dakota, in latitude 44P 23', and the northwest corner of Illinois. The plains of the Mississippi, far and near, became the swampy homes of innumerable snails, and the loess was deposited. Finally, a further depression of twenty-five feet in our latitude at least, and as far as Northeru Mississippi, spread the area of dead water over all these swamps, and so tliminished the already small current that only clayey silt could be carried by the flood. This forms our yellow loam; a reverse motion then began, which restored the height of the continent above the ocean. The rivers contracted to narrow channels, and began the work of cutting out their beds and forming anew their flood-plains and deltas-work by no means completed. The remnants of the olu tlood-plains remain-a fringe of bluffs on either side, a.-. monuments of this ''eventful history." Again, in regard to the alhIYium he says, p. 167: The alluYial deposits of the Mississippi River are already classic ground for the geologist. Hastily as Sir Charles Lyell examined them in 1845, he gathe1·ed facts sufficient to form the basis of a calculation of the number of years that it must have taken the river to make its present delta.

As the number was too high to suit the preconceived notions of man,\"', there ha>e been various efforts to reduce iL 1,'oremost among these is that by General A. A. Humphreys in his report on the Mississippi Ri,·er (p. !19), in which he states that the river flows, even in the delta region, "in a channel belonging to a geological epoch antecedent to the present." As this would greatly diminish the 1lepth tlwt he had assigned to the alluvium, Sir Charles Lyell appealeu to the testimony of the specimens taken from the artesian well at New Orleans in 1856. 'l'hese specimens were submitted to Prof. E. Hilgard, of Mississippi, for examination, and his report 11pon them appeared in the fall of 1870. The professor therein takes the view that the alluvium proper beneath New Orleans is but 31 feet thick, arguing that the marine deposits below, to a depth of mm feet, are of the Port Hudson group. I followed him last year in this idea, and quoteu his list of shells under the head of the !Huff fonnation. :My obserrntious this season oblige me to modify this conclusion somewhat. Wishing to ascertain as accurately as possible the actual depth of the alluvium, I instituted a scrie;;; of experimen j s upon the wat.ers of wells dug in the Port Hudson formation and in the bott.om lands, respectively. I haYefouud (as indeed Professor Hilgard had told me that he should expect) that the former contain a considerable proportion of sulphates and carbonates, while the latter show au excess of chlorides. This result is uniform, excepting where the wells happen to strike eom;iderable beds of sand, when the waters are too pure to be distinguished. It is e-vident, there_ fore, tliat b~- testing the water of the deepest wells dug in the alluvium it is possible to tell whether tbey pass through it into the underlying- Port Hudson groups or uot. The patent wells that are made by 8imply driving a tube into the ground offer great facilities for this research, as the water that tlH'Y fnrnish comes necessarily from the bottom of the well only. On a trip that I took from H:1to11 llonge to the Arkansas line, I analyzed the water of yarious wells of from seventy to one lmnclred feet in depth, and in not a single instance found any other than the alluvial characteristics. The allnviurn, then, upon the upper part of the river heing deeper, as a rule, than from seventy to ont> hundred feet, it i;s highly improbable that it is no deeper than thirty-one at the city of New 01foai1s. lt is true that the art-0siau well passed at that depth from swamp deposits into mariue; the <pwstion to l~P dt>citlt><l i><, whether such a changP is in this case a paHsage from one geological forrnntion to another. It is not necessarily su. The term alJuyium is indeed so g-cnerally confined to river formations that we are :ipt to forget that these are but a small part of the strata that are forming in the present era. The fine blue clay of the Mediterranean, the chalk of the "Telegraphic Platea11" of the :Xortli Atlantic, and the deposits now settling in tbe Gulf of Mexico from the long brown line pro.it~Ct(·d into it by tl1e migl1ty l\Iississippi, are but marine equivalents of the alluvium proper. A vast lMl of 1mch marine equivalents nrrn· lie!-! i11 front of our present delta, rendering the water shallow for a tlistance of 10 miles from the Passes. Ilere occur1i a sudden slope that might be regarded as the prnprr continental slope of tl1e present era, so greatly does it exceed that at the shore of the <ldta itself. The whole sea bottom including this shallow margin is covered with living beings, and the recent beds, alluvial equivalents though they be, are full of their exnvire. Brnry advance that th·· delta makes iu its progr<'ss towards the sea is 11ecessarily based upon these recent beds. ·when, therefore, we dig through tbe river deposits and come to strata with marine shell1<, it does not follo"· that we have reaclwd an antecedent geological formation, unless the fossils are those of PXiin<>t Rpecies. Xow, the shells obtained beueath New Orleans are all of recent species, as far as known. There is 110 inoof whatever, therefore, that the whole series of deposits may not be equiv-. alcuts of t11e alluYium iustead of belonging to the Port Huclson group. There are some reasons that lea11 to the supposition that tlwy are very recent. The first of these has been already given, -riz, that as I ha-ve prornd the rin'r allm·ium to be over 100 feet in depth at various points between 11aton Houge and Arkansas, it ought to be even deeper at :Kew Orleans, because that city is nearer the fuot of the slope of the river valley. If we grant this, we are obliged to claim some of tlie upper marine beds as recent delta deposits, and Professor Hilgard bas himself declared that no line can be drawn between these and t.he others. The depth of 650 feet offers no difficulty t-0 this supposition, hut rather aids the argument by completing the analogy between the.Bluff period and the present. I ha,"e already alludecl to the continental slope that occurs 10 miles south of the Pnsi-:es. T11is slope' follows the trrml of the Gulf shore almoRt irrespective of the protrusion of the

"r·

163

delta. It owes its formation, no doubt, to the opposition offered by the waves of the Gulf to the outflowing cnrre11t of the river. The sediment is not allowed to spread far over the Gulf bottAnn, but is beaten back near1J' to the short·. Now, this cause was in full operation during the Bluff period ; only, as that was the time when the riYer was broader than now, owing to the depression of the land, its current was less than at present, and the continental slope of that period ought to follow the general cnrn' of the Gulf shore 8\'en more accuratel.v than does the modern one. T11e land has been raised since then, and the southern edge of the prairie region and the northern shores of Lakei-i ::\laurepas and Pontchartrain lie in about the anticipated direction. Tht> chain of the Five Island;.;, howen'r, protmdes bt'yond this line, so that the slope may lie nearer the city, out most probably abore it. If so, and if the Gulf of that day was as deep near the slope as at preo;ent, New Orleans may rest upon receut deposits as thick as the Gulf is dt>ep. (The Port Hudson group.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
SlJMMARY.

The southern drift corresponds exactly in time and cause with the northern drift. The Drift succeeded immediately the Tertiary, and overlies almost its entire area, as well as that of the Cretaceous, in the Atlantic and Gulf States. Its heaviest gravel beds border the Metamorphic rocks, on the Atlantic slope, and ai:; far south as ·wetumpka, Ala., and from there to the mouth of the Ohio border the Carboniferous. On the west side of the Mississippi they border the Carboniferous in Arkans'ts and extend to the Colorado Rfrer in Texas. There are other large deposits near the present bed of the l\Iississippi River extending to the mouth of the Atchafalaya, which was probably the original course of the river. The Drift was covered at one time in the whole delta, at least as high as Memphis, by a stratum of clay of Port Hudson age, which is generally blue, and is also found in riYerrs and creeks tributar,y to the Mississippi, in Mississippi and Louisiana. This has been to a large extent removed by the present .Mississippi River, at aud near its pres· ent course, and may have been removed over a large portion of the bottom and its place supplied by the alluvial deposits of the present river. The evideuce furnished by General Humphreys of its formiug the present bed of the river is not at all satisfactor,v or convindng, and does not agree with my oh1IBrrntions. In his report he speaks of blue clay of no les.s thau seve11 clistinet geolog· ieal periods, and classes them as one and the same. The observations of Dr. Hopkins were continued for yearn over the whole of Louisiana, and his deductions seem to accord more nearly with the facts, certainly as to the thickness of the alluvium, which as far as I have seen, with a few exceptions, to be mentioned hereafter, is not less than 100 feet thick along tlte banks of the river from Memphis to New Orleans, as can be readily seen in a hundred places where the levees have been built, and in a few years have caved into the river frequently, as on th·e .A.fohafalaya, near Simmsport, acres of land having disappeared at once, leaving a >ertical wall 100 feet deep, from the bottom of which trees and logs that had been buried or ages were uncovered. There are a few points on the river where the Port Hudson chlyshan' resisted all the efforts of t lie current to dislodge them. At Wilton Landing.At a point opposite Grand Lake, near the line of .Arkansas and LouisianaAt the mouth of Red RiverAt I:Argent plantationAt Bonnet Carre~t ~ew Texas Landing. I have given above extracts from those who have made a study of these Quaternary formations, which I think contain substantially everything valuable that bas been written upon them having any bearing on the question at issue. The sections which follow ha\·e been taken with care over the whole area .involved, and from them you will see what value to attach to the various views ex1n·pssPrl hy the different distinguished scientists who han~ theorized upon this subject of such Yital importance, not only to the residents of the overflowed lands, but to the whole nation. They all agree that the loess has occupied in a past age the whole valley now covered by alluvium. The~· all attribute the erosion of the valley to a swiftly flowing current of the Drift period, which has left a continuous stratum of gravel aml pel.Jbles beneath the loess. All the later observers concur in the opinion first expressed b,y myself in 1867, that between the drift and the loess there has been a continuous deposit of clay, similar t,o that described by Sir Charles Lyell at Port Hudson, not only in the Mississippi Valley, but in the smaller tributaries. All agree that the pres· ent river deposits annually allu\'ium ornr the whole bott,om, where it is not kept within its banks by le;ees, and that this alluvium is in a large part of the bottom as thick as the river is deep, say 100 feet. My observatfons lead me to believe that neither the banks rwr the bed of the river consist of the blue clay of the Port Hudson period, but of clays and sand of allut·ial origin. The admirable work of General Humphreys has been a credit to the nation, and the only lack in it is the want of such goological surveys as would have shown the true age and relations of the

blue clay, which is the subject of this report. Lat.er inn11tigations hy admirable observers would have been rendered more valuable if they had been allowed sufficient time to stud,\· the present course and the recent and continual changes in the current of the river. I have gi1·en you the most reliable data on record, and yet this is, I fear, not what you desired, an exhaustive report ou the "blue clay." I have studied its relations at intervals for twenty years, and girn you the re>'nlts of all that I han~ heen able to gather from scientific records, or my own personal obsern1tion.

A TREATISE OX THE PLANE-TABLE ,\ND ITS USE IN TOPOGRAPHICAL Sl"RYEYING.
By E.
HE~RG-ESHEil\IER,

The representation of any portion of tbe surface of the earth in horizontal plan, as it would app1>ar Yit,wed from a yertical position over each pomt, is the modern form of a map, which may be considt·red ai> consisting of an infinite number of points, the establiishment of the iiositiohs and relations of so many of which as may he necessar.r to define the feature!' rm1 uired constituting the instrumental work of the sur·eyor. A point in Rpace iH the prime element of position, but is indefinite position; the addition, of anot11er point introduces the definite elements of direction and tfa1tance. Direction, as applied to terrestrial surve:l'ing, is azimuth, or deflection from tbe true north and south line; or compass bearing, deflection from the magnetic north and south line; or the amount of deflection from any giren line. The amount of deflection of one line from another is measured by the angle formed at tlieir intersection as a center. Distance is mea8med by any unit conventioualls cHhtblished; the most definite of which, in preiwut use, are tlw yard and the ID('ter. The, addition of a third }lOint intrndulles trigonometric functions, b;Y whieh m1y giYcn three elements of a triangle, except the three angle~, serrn to determine all the others; thi:-i with the planetablP, in topographical surveying, is gravhically perform,ed. In a topographical map each l>Oint, besides being projected upon a lwrizoutal plane, has its height, either within, abon·, or below a Im-el surface, iu some way indicated. The representation of details between tbe determined point,; completes tlte surw;v, and draws upon the arfo;tie skill, perception, and judgment of tbe sm·n~~·or. ln surve;ys of such limited arna as arr generally made with the plilUe-tal.Jle, q uestious of ge-odcsy ma~· bt>. disregarded, except the conn·xity of the earth's surface and refraction a1' affo<iting heights. Our int}uiries will, therefore, he <lirected to the instrumental and personal processes necessary for a precise an<l intelligible representation of nature, and especially to those processes peculiar to the vlauc-table, and which constitute its special power, as well as to indicate, step h,v step, the proceedings a11d manipulations in the use of thiR instrument, wl1ich ham generally 11eret-Ofore been acquired through personal in:-itructiun. J?or conyenicnce of deseription the 11lane-table may he dfrided into three parts: 1. Tripod he<td a1Hl legs. 2. Monments. 3. Tahle-top or board. The fogs arc made of wood as lig·ht as i11 consistent with requii>ite strength, shod with ln··.i,ss, awl at th(>ir jtmction with the tripod head of sufficient width to reduce the chauces of lateral mo· tion to tl1e minimum. The tripod head is sonwtimPs made of wood, hut in the latest instruments is made of brass. The movements of the, tH hies in usr hy Uu· Coai-;t aml Geodetic Snrvey are of different llOnstrllCtion, but all are of brass, and look to the same ei:;seutials, viz, sufficient strength for solidity, and horizontal revoh·ing faces of large enough diameter and accurate fit to prevent vertfoal motion when clamped together, as well as sufficient room for lateral play of the axis of revolution of the upper plate, necessary in the different relations between the planes of the tripod head and the revolYing faces of tlle movements, which llltter are always required to be in a horizontal plane, and meami. for clamping the axis of reYolntion to t,he tripod head when the revolving faces have been made horizontal with the leveling screws; there being attached to the clamp of the revolv. ing plate the usual tangent screw for fine motiou. The table-top or board should Lte made of well seasoned wood: panelled with the grain at right angles, to counteract as much as possible the tendency to warp; its upper surface finished a-s nearly

as possible in a plane and attached to the prqjecting arms of the monments with firmuesH: great care being taken that i1,s upper surface shall be parallel t<1tlw plane of revolution of the mornments so that the two planes shall remain parallel in all poBitionR of the board. As much lightness as is consi8tcut with re<1uisite strength should be sought in the cow;trnetio11 of all the parts. The accompanying illustrations (Nos. 49 allll .ill, Figs. 1, 2, and 3) of what is considered tht· most approY&l instrument will he sufficient,, it is hoped, to show its construction without an,Y minute deooription of details. The most, approved alidade (see illustration) oonsists of a brass or steel 11de (12 ilwhes long hy 21inches wide), nickel-plated underneath, from and perpt>ndicular to which rises a brass column(;) incheR high), surmounted by Ys~ receiving the tran;;;n·rse axis of tl1·~ telescope, to one end of which axis is firmly attached a graduated arc of 30°, eaeh !:iidc of a central O, au accom1mnying Yernier being attacl1erl to the lower part of the Y support. The telescope is fitted accurately near its center of j!.'rnYity within a clo,.el~- titting l'~·lindP1\ to which is Mlidl;v attached the transrnrse axi..,. The telei·wope revokes within thii- eylin1ler 180°, stops being fitted for that range. Thi;;; affords au ea·"Y mocle of ad,iuRting the crol's-wPhR to the axis of revolution, and for correction, with a 1'triding lm el, of the error:; of kwl and collimation and of revolution of the tele1>cope. Upon the tube of the telesroope are turned two ishouldt>r1<, 011 which rt>i;t;; a striding· spirit-level, which can readily be rewrseil or remm·e<l at pleaRnre. Tlw usnal eye- pieee and diaphrn!-(m an' used, but it is usual to atfach to the diaphragm a thiu glaRs plate ha,·ing two finelJ· e111.:-raved horizontal lines, the distance hetween whieh rPmains a eoustant chord for the 111easurPmP11t, upon a tlidderl staff'7 of distance; or, to attach to the e~-e-pie1~e a micrometer with one of' th(· horizontal wires moYahle, for meiumring the angular distance of a fixetl le11gth, on a l'O!l, which remain" a constant chord. To the rule of the alidade are attached two Rpirit levels, oue in the lougitutliual 1lirectio11 of the rnle and the other at right :rngles to it. · A decliuatoire accompanies the alida1le and is carrit·tl in its hox. It was fornwrly attadied to the rule of the alidade with the north anrl 1South line of tlic arcs parallel to the edgt> of the rnlc.

The telescope itself has the usnal cross.hairs aml means of focal adjustment. A transverse level is fastened to the ell gt· of the upper of 1he two plates at the t·lp of the standard by means of adjnsting screws. The telP,scope is so placed that its line of collimation is aboYe and in the same ,·ertical plaue with the :fiducial edge of the rule. A vertical arc with a tangent 8crew ard clamp is attached to the telesco11ic sitle of the lower brass plate, and, with a vernier which moves in are as the telescopP iR raised or depressed, is used in the measnrement of vertical angles for heights.

REJ'ORT OF THE SUPERTNTBNDENT OF THE

table i;; often nooessaril,y subjected to rough usage, aml there is a constant liability to a llisturh ance of tbc adjustment><; i;till, in careful hands, a. well· made instrument may he used under ver:.· nnfavorabh· conditions for a long time without heing peroeptiblr affected. One should not fail, howp,·er, to make occaHional examinations, and whifo at work, if any difficulty be encountered which cannot otherwi8e he accounted for, it should lead directly to a ;;crutiny of the adjnstments. 1. 1'lte Jidudal ei{,_qe <!f the rule.-This should be a true, 8traig-l1t etlg·e. Place the rule upon a flmooth i-;urface and draw a line along the edge, marking all'o the line;; at, the ends of the rule. Heven;e the rul!', an11 place the oppm1ite t>nds upon the marked points, antl again draw the line. lf the two lines ('Oincide, uo adj11stment is nece&'1ar,v; if not, the edge mul't be made true. There i;; m1P de,·iation froru a straight line, which, by a ver;v rare possibility, the edge of the ruler might assume, and .vet not be shown by the aboYe test; it is when a pa.rt is couYex, and a part similarl.r situated at the other eud conca,'e, in exactly the same !legree and proportion. In tllis case, on reversal, a line drawn along the e<lge of the rule would be coincident with the other, though not a true right line; this. can be tested b:v an exact straight edge. 2. The lei·el a.tft.tched to tlie rule.-PlaeA3 the instrument in the middle of the table and hring the lmhule to the center uy means of the leveling screws of the table; draw line8 along the edge and ends of the rule upon the board to show its exact position, then reverse 180°. If the bubble remain central, it is in adjustment; if not, correct it one.half by means of the leveling screws of the table, and the otber half uy the acljustiug screws attached to the Iernl. This should be repeated until the lmbble keeps iti; central position, whichever way the rule may be placetl upon the table. This presupposes the plane of the board to be tru(;). If two levels are on the mle, they are examined an<l a.djnst~d in a like mauner. Great care sbould bt> exercised in manipulatiou, lest the table be disturbed. 3. Parallax.-1IonJ the eye-glass until the cross-hairs are perttictly distinct, and then direct the tPlrseope to some distant. well·defined object. If the contact remain perfect when the position of thf' eye is chang-eil in an:r way, ther<' ii:i no parallax; but if i.t does not, t.lieu the focus of the o~ject glasi; must he chai1ged until there is no di:-\l>lacement of the contact. ·when this is the caRe, the cross-hairs are in the common focus of th(· ol~ject and e~·e gla;;ses. It may occur that the true focus of the cross-hairs ii-\ not obfained at first, iu which case a readjustment is necessary, in order to see both them and the ol~ject with equal distinctness and without parallax. 4. To make tltc line of collima,f.ion perpendicular to the a.ris of 1·erolution '!t' the tde.,cope, and tlw a.ri.~ of revolution parallel to the pla.ne of the rule.-The instrument is set up ancl carefully leveled, and the eross·hairs lli1·ecte<l to a plumb or other vertical line. If the cross-hairs cover the line when the telei:;oope i..; elevated and depressed, the adjustments are perfect; should thes devia.te, howe\·er, from the Yertical line, this error may b'3 attributable to two canses: 1st, the line of collimation is uot 1wrpentlicular to the horizontal axis; or, 2<1, the axis is not horizontal, autl commquentl~· uot parallel to tl1e plane of the rule. In the first case the motion of the cross· hairs will be in a curn., and UJJ011 being made to cover the vertical line when the telt>,scope is horizontal, will deviate from it to the same side hoth upon 1.1levation and de}Jression. In t,be second case the movement of the cross·llairs will be in a straight line oblique to the horizon, aml when made to oover the ,·ertical line wht'11 the telescope is borizontal, t.he:v will, upon being elevated and depressed, appear upon d(Uin:11t si~lt·s of the vertical line. These two cases will be coni;iiderecl separately. When the construction of tbe folescope admits of it, the perpendicularit;r of the line of collimntiou to the transverse axiN may be examined ai,i follows: Direct t.be cross.hairs to a well,defined, distant o~ject, as nearl,y upou a level with the telescope a.s may be, draw a line along the fiducial edge; then n·verse the rule 180°, again placing the edge along this line, revolve the telescope upon its axis aml again obsene the objoot; if tlm cross-hairs cover it, the adjustment is perfect; if not, one· half the error must he (~orrecred hy moving the cross· hairs by means of the adjusting screws of the diaphragm, an·l the other half with the tangent screw of the fable, and the operation should be rt'peat;ed until the adjustment is complefo. Iu using th~ method just given, it may he t;a.ken for granted tha.t t,he liue of collimation revoh·es in the Yertical plane of the fiducial edge, as any error arising from this not being the case would be ina1>preciable. After this adjustment the horizontality of the a.xis should be examined. Direct the cross-hairs

to a distant, well-defined, elevated or depressed o~ject, liaving tbe table carefully lt·Yt>led; draw a line along the fiducial edge, reverse the rule, and again direct toward the objed; if the c·ror<s-l1airreover it, the axis is horizontal; if they do not, one-half of the deviation should be corrPcterl h,\· means of the screws attaching the upper plate to the top of the standard, or b~- rneami of the screws attaclling the standard to the rule. Tim level attaclu~d to the axis Hbonl<l tlwn hf' 1mull' central. In the alidadet\, as recently improYed, the bearings of the axis being unchang·eahle, r;aw by such violence <ts would destroy the instrument. for all practical pm·poses, the foregoing adjnHt. ment and the succeeding one are, of em1rse, unnecessnr~-, as the im;truuwnt is to he considrrNl aR in constant adjustment in these respecti>. 5. To make the line of collimation parallel t-0 tlte i·ertiMl platie of the .fidttcial edgc.-The exact parallefom1 of these is not necessary, hut it is essential that tlie deviation should remain cou11taut. . This adjustment may be examined by means of two needles stuck in tl1e table. Tl1e table il'l turned so that the noodles Hight exactly to some distant olJject; the fidueial edg(l' is then pl:tl'.ed again1>t them and the teleseope directed to the o~ject. If the cross-hairs biseet it, the adjustment is <~orrect; but if they do not, it can he corrected by means of the screws attaching the standard to the rule. 6. ZM·o of the vertical arc.-Whe.n the line of sight is borizonbtl, U1e \'ernier of the vertical an'. should read o:i, or the index: error should be known. Thi13 may be examinetl hy means of the distant sea horizon, or by setting up the alidade so that the center of the telescope is in the line of sight of an accurately adjustt'd leveling instrument, anq then clirecting both instruments, while level, to a distant object; if any er1·or be discovered, it ma~· be corrected by setting the vernier at o0 , and adjusting the horizontal wire to the sea horizon or object. ..When the. above means are not aTailable, thf' following method may be used: :::let up the instrument at a point, measure the angle of ele>ation or depression of a distant object, remove the instrument to that object, and measure the angle of depression or elevation of tl1e first point. These angles should be equal if the adjustment be correct; and if not equal, the iudex enor will be one-half the difference of the two readings. The followiug methou of making this adjustment, where you haye ueitlter a Se]larnte Je,·el, a sea horizon, m· an elevation, may he employed: Set np t.lte table and len~I it carefully on ans levd piece of ground between two equidistant pointl3 A and B, say 600 or 800 meters apart. Det.ermine with the table the difforc11ce of level of these two points, and remoYe the tahle to A. Measure carefully the distance from the ground to the center of the axis of the telescope, and a<lrl or subtract this from the difference of leYel of the point B, according as it is lower or higher than A. Set up a target <W distinct point at this height at B, direct the cross-hairs upon it, and correct the vernier acconlinglr.
FIELD WORK.

As in all plane-table surye~·s it is important that suflicient points shilll he determine1l from a measured base, at such distances from each otlier that, wheu plotted on the scale of the surn~y, they may be reached by the rulr of the alidade from the intervening spaces, it will be presumed that this has heeu done, as is usually the case in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, a11d that tile sheet to he used mt the table lt:ts these points aceurately plotted, so that they bear tllr sauw relation to one another as the corresponding points i.lf nature. The first proceeding is to secure the sheet to the tahle, so that it will be held finnl,\- aml eYcnl~ and not he disturbed in its position by tl1e frict.ion of thti alidade, nor by ordinary winds. As the longest side of the board is usually made e<1ual to the width of the sheet, an<l the Hhect is nsuall~' longer than this width, the excess of length is rolled up inward, turned uuden1eath the siill's of the table and fastened with a metal Hpriag-elamp, biting from the t~1p of the shed on tile table to 1he inside of the roll beneatll. One clamp at eaeh end of tlie roll serws to hold th1· roll-micls securelJ. The sides of the sheet are sometimes held tu the ta.hie h~, similar hut shorter clamps; but it is preferable for the free movement of the alidade, and more secure against strong winds, tllat a metal strip, the length of the side between the end clamps, with spring clamps fastened to the outer edge, and biting the under side of the table, be used for ltoltling down tlte edges of tlte paper. These strips have another important value-that seales of equal parts of the proportion of the survey can be maxked upon them, and thus dispense with the l!cale usually carried separately. It is

best to have all metal that comes in contact with the paper nickel-plated, as this dl)es not corrode, and consequently does not soil the paper.

'I'he tahle ltadng hee11 ~mt accuratel,v over the point and carefully le,·eled arnl 8et in approximate poRition, set the rnle edge of the alidade on tl1P line connecting the point ocCHIJied "ith any other determined point, nnclam11 and 1·evolve the table until the latter point is within the field of the telescope, when the table should be clamped aml the point lns··cted hy the vertical web witlt tlie tangent sere~ ; tlle11 take hold of the edge of the board. and appl~- a gentle forcf.\ in the c1irectio11 of the ren>lution to determine if all is well clamprd.

The table will the11 he iu position, or, as it is 80metimes called, "oriented." Then set the f'dge of the alidade rnle upon the lines joining- each plott.ed point an<l the point. ot·cupied, 8ucce:sKi \·ely. Each corresponding signal or o~ject should l.ie bisected hy the vertical web of the telescope. The failure to do so iudicating error of plotting or change of dimensions of the paper, which must be examined aml corrected. If, boweYer, the extension of the line tll each point of the Rheet. cuts the corresponding point of nature, the points of the sheet are correctly plotted in the directions ohsPrvetl, and the table is in position. The chief and controlling condition in work with tl1c planc·tahle, and witl1ont which no accurafr work can lie done, ii'! that the table shall bP hi positio11; that is, that all lineR joining points on thr sheet shall lie parallel to the < orres11oudi11g lines of nature. Let T, T 1, T", T 111 (lllnstrat.ion iH, Fig. 4), represent the board of the plane.table, upon which is spread the sheet; tlw plotted triangulation point a upon tllf' sheet representing the signal A npon tl1e ground; b, tla~ spirP. 1~; c, the sig11al U; and p, the statio11 P; the Rmall letters 011 tlte sheet represeutiug tlw centers of the Rignals 011 the ground, whic·h an· referred to hy correRpomling ca.pita! letter1:1.

Thell plumb the point p over the station I', fixing tlm ]pgs of the table firmly in the grouwl; phce the alidade upon the tahle so that the rule sl1all extcrnl across aml parallel with the line joining two of the }e,·eling serew1>; loosen the large clam}) screw nuder the tripod head, and with the leveling RcrewR hring the bnbhles of tlw t;,.) levels 011 the rule to the center; clamp the screw under the tripod head, and the tahle h.; h·\·el. Now, unclamp the reYolving plate, place the edge of the rule upon t.he plotte.d poinb.; p arnl li,_tbe telescope lwil1g directed toward the snire B, as shown by the arrmv.Jwad of the figure, and revolve tl1e tahle until B iH sef'u in the field of the telescope; clamp the revolving plate, and witb the tangent screw of the nwvement,fl bisect the top or center of the spire H with ·the Yertical web of the telescope. The table is now ·in 11osition, if the points l1ave been eorrectly plotted and the proper objects sighted. To Yerify thiR, place the rule upon the point p again, and upon the points a. arnl c, consecutively, aml if the two signals A and C are !Jiseded by the vertical weh of the telescope, the position is assured, and the lines connecting points of the sheet are parallel with the corresponding lines 011 the ground. The next proceeding is to 4lraw the line to tbe next point which it is desirable to occupy or determine, either some natuml ol~j(·1~t whicl1 can be occupied, or a tPmporary signal placed for that purpose, as the signal n. The edge of the rule is placed upon the point p, and mo\'e(l about that poiut as a center unti1 the signal D is bisected 11y the n:wt1cal Wl'b 1 and then a line, f, is drawn along the edge of the rule from p far enough to reach the t'stimated position on tl1e sheet of the point d, and at each end of the rule the short check·lines n n are drawn.

In the same iwmner, lines to he afterward intersected should he drawn to such objects as it is 1Jesired to tletermint'. Tangent lines to prominent objects, natural and artificial, and lines to objects comparatin~ly near, the distances to which arf' t{1 he measured, such as frurf'-corners, houses, roadangles, and turns in creeks, &c., should be drawn. If the heig·ht of the station be important, this 8honld he <lt'termined, both ar; a g·uirle for the lines of equal elerntion in the immediate \'icinity, aud as a JJOint of reforence for determination of heights from other stations. The drawing of detaihi is now to lw completed, it being always desirable that the work at a station he completed when it is first oc1~npied, so that, if possible, no return to it shall be necessary. "-'ork being completed at a station, the alidade is placed in its box, the table clamped and removed. tlw signal re-erected, and the uext station occupied. ·while at a station the table it> shaded hy a large umbrella t<> soften the glun~ of the snn on the white surface, anll to ur.utralize, fts far as possible, itB effert i11 rontrncting- t!Je dimensions of the paper. The taJJle having been moved to the point observed upo1do put it in its first position, and having been accurate!.\· set up and leveled, set the alidade on the line connecting this point \\ith the first point occnpied, and rernlve the table until the signal at the first point occupied is within tlw field of the telescope, when clamp the movements and with the tangent screw bisect the signal with the vertical web. Tlle table is then in position, and the observation of each plotted point from this point in the same manner as at the first station will determine if each point is plotted correct I~- i11 direction from this point. If the two obserwd directions of eacL signal from the two points oocnpied intersect in the corresponding- plotted point, the point i:s correctly plotted on the sheet. It is best, howe\'er, to occupy a third point, repeating the same proceeding; when the inter sf\ctiou of tl1P three 1lirert.ions in any plotte<l point prows its position and relation to the other points correct beyond doubt. "'hen the table is in position at an.\' determined point, an~· object in Yiew ma~· be observed through the telescope, and the edge of the rule being kept sharply on tile point occupied, a line drawn along its edge will be the direction of the ol~ject ohserrnd; and as this determines only the one clement of <lirection, it will b(' necessary to determint' its distanee from the point occupied either by mertsurf' or hy inter;;ection of this direction by u direction frorn flome other fixed point, which iutersects the first direction at an angle not less than 3(F' nor morr than 15fP; all acutr intersections should be verified by a. direction from a third point. (Fig. ;;, ) The table is remoYed to the station A and placed oYer tile poinL put in approximate position, leveled, and the axis of re>olution clamped as at station P. The rule is then set urlOn the line a p, the telescope directed toward the signal P, and the table put in position in the manner <lescribed. Then, keeping the edge of the rule upon a, direct the telescope to the signal D and draw the line a d, intersecting f, and determining the position of the point d upon the sheet, correspond· ing to D,and bearing the same relation in directions and distances from the points p, a, b, anll c as the signal D does from P, A, B, and C. All lines to other objects whicll wHe drawn from p, and which ol1jecb1 can be seen from A, are intersected and determined in the same manner. When a direction has been drawn from a station to any undetermined point. that ma.r IJe occupied, the position of the point may be determined by occup~;ing it with the table, and putting the table in position by the line drawn to it, and resecting upon a signal whose corresponding point is plotted npon the sheet. (Fig. 6.) The table is placed over the point D, put in approximate position, leveled, &c., as at the previous stations. The edge of the l'llle is then placed upon the line d p, passing through the point p, so that the checks n n are just Yisible along the edge, and thP ti>lescope directed toward tlw signal P, and the table pnt in position. The rule is then placed with its edge bisecting one of the plotted points, such as b, which will give a good intersection (the nearer 900 the better) with the line f, and is moved about that point as a center until the spire B is bisected by the rnrtical web. A line is now drawn along the edge of the rule accuratBly through b, crossing the lilw f. 1f tllis line intersects the line fat the point a., the position of the latter is assured, and a delicate holP with 8.

The snrn-;r then proceeds as usual.

'l'hc manner of doing this is elsewhel'C described. Before fiaislling the field work, it is important, when the sheet has no projection, to provide rlata for drawing a true north and soutb'linc. This is done by drawing from a point upon the sheet, when the table is in positiou, a line in the vertical plane through P-0laris and the point occupied and recording the time of observation. The azimuth of the star at that time being known, a true north and south line can accordingly be set off. If a small transit instrument is at haml and carefully adjustecl for movement in Yertical plane, an assist.ant with a lantern can be locatetl where the vertical plane tl.Jrough Polaris and the point occupied intersects the ground, at as great a distance from the point as the ground will admit of, within the limit of communication b;v light signals. 1Yhen. the assistant is in position, a stake is there driYen, the direction to which, from the point occupied, may be determined by daylight. If, in the absence of a transit., the alidade has n-0t vertical mnge Stlflicient to reach Polaris, an illuminated plumb-line ma;r be used for the alignment.

For this purpose a small auxiliary plane-table, the working with which will not require more than two hands in addition to tl1e aid in eharge, affords the best facilit;v. For, with compasi', the deflections of the traYcri-;e will be ouly approximate, and with a transit instrument thr necessity arises for plotting with protrador on a sketch with less aecurac~· and facility than the table affords.

The first mode possesses the virtue of making no linear measurement, and demonstrates iu a very satisfactory manner the power of the table in determining position by resection. (Figs. 35, 36, 37, and 38.)-Two points, A and B, not conyeniently accesf'ilJle, heing given, by their pn~jections a and b, to pnt the pla.ne-tahle in position iit a third poiut, C. (Tl1e capital letter."! refer to points on the ground, and the small ones to their con'e8J)()ndiug prqjectious.) Select a fourth point, D, such that the intersections from U and D upon A and B make sufficiently large angles for good determinations. Put the table approximate]~· in position at D, by estimation or by compass, and draw the lines .Aa Bb, intersecting in d; through d draw a line directed to C. Then set up at C, and assuming the point con the line dC, at an estimated distance from d, anrl putting the table in a position parallel to that which is occupied at D, by means of the line cc1, draw the liues from c to A and from c to Il. These will intersect the lines dA dB at pointA a' and b', which form wHh c and d a quadrilateral similar to the true one, bnt erroneous in size and position. The angles which the lines ah and a'b' make with each other is the error in position. By con· structing now through ca line cd', making the same angle with cd as that which ab makes with a'll, and directing this line cd' to D, the table .will be brought into position, and the true point c can be found by the intersections of a.A. and bB. Instead of transferring the angle of enor by construction, we may conveniently proeeed as follows, observing that the angle which the line a'b' makes with ab is the error in the position of the · table. As the table now stands, a'b' is parallel with .AB, but we want to turn it so that ab shall be parallel to the same. If we, therefore, place the alidade on a'b' and set up a mark in that direction, then place the alidade on ab and turn the table until it again points to the mark, then ab will be parallel to AB, and the table is in position. Another method is as follows (Fig. 39): '.l'wo points, A and B, not conveniently accessible, being gh·en by their projections a aud b, to put the plane-table in position at a third (undetermined) point, C. Set up the table at the IJOint sought as nearly in position as can be done with the eye, aud resect upon A and B, intersecting the line be at c'. The angle ac'b is the true angle at the point occupied, subtended by .A.B, being the· angle of nature actually drawn; therefore, the true point must be on the circumference of the circle passing through ab<''. Construct this circle. Measure off a base, CD, at least half the length of UB, at right angles, 01· neal'ly so, to be, in either direction most convenient. Set up a·signal at D, and with the alidade draw the line c'd. Remm·e the table to D, and, by means of a signal at C (the point sought), and the line de', bring the table into a position parallel to that which is occupied at C. 1Yith the alidade centering on d, observe the signal B, and draw the line db' interse()ting vb at b'. c'l/ is the distanee of the point C from B, and this distance laid off on the circle ac'b as a chord from b will give c", the true posit:on of the point C . .A fourth point may then be occu1)ied, and by resection upon A, B, aml C tlie accuracy of the determination of C verified. Where it is possible to get the two signals .A and B in range, it is easy t.o determine the posi· tion ()f a third point by a mode long practiced by topographers. Set up the.table anywhere on the range line, and, baving i;et up a signal at the poiut sought, resect upon it, intersecting the range line anywhere, and by means of the range signal and the line to it·the table may be set in parallel position to that occupied in the range, whiPli is the true position, and the point sought may be determinetl lly l'esection upon the two fixed pointl'I and their projections.
REPRESENTATION OF THE TERRENE.

Since no topographical map can be complete without some systematic representation of the undulations and changes of slope of the surface of the ground-" terrene," as the French term itcaused by the oscillations of the earth's crust, erosion, abrasion, or artificial works, various modes have been devised for such representation. · The earliest maps gave rude views of hills, mountains, &c., in elerniion, with their bases in position on~, in the same manner as trees were representen. · Near the end of the eighteenth century Major von Muller, of the Pruslilian army, l'epresented

with approximate normal hachures with distinct shadings, slopes, which he called "gentle, less inclined, inclined, steep, precipitous, and perpendicular." .A.bout 1815, the admirable system by Major von Lehman, of the Saxon army, was publis!Jed; by which hills were shaded by normals based upon the amount of reflected vertical light from planes inclined to the horizon, by successive steps of 5° of slope, and which, with some modifications in the highQr and lower slopes, remains the most approved system of to-day. .A. most important st~p, whose origin does not seem to be well established, but which probably resulted as a necessary consequence from attempts t.o represent hills in plan, had regard to the drawing of the lines formed by the prominent changes of slope, termed "contours," which Colonel Olsen, of the Danish Generalquarteermesterstab, in 1833, defines as indicating "the general form of the locality, the most striking changes in declivities, tops, slopes, and bases of hills, &c.,17 and which are always the lines controlling a topographical sketch. They may be described as the lines bounding areas of approximately equal slope, or as lines through points where the surface changes in any marked degree its inclination to the horizon. Since the introduction in 1744, by the French geographer, Philip Buache, of the method ·of representiug hills by successive lines of equal elevation, the true contour system bas been ofteu lost sight of, and sometimes to the exclusion of the most characteristic elements of the terreue. Often these lines are the outcrop of rock, or the top or base of a precipitous ledge, which, in the directions of strike and dip, incline to the horizon, and which are but feebly represented by lines of equal elevation instead of contours; more attention being given to the continuity of the level element than to the striking changes of form and character of surface. It is, in fact, at this point where the perception of fonn and facility of drawing the same become important factors in the power of the topographer for accurate and characteristic representation of the peculiar type of form which constitutes his subject. As to the modes of determining and drawing Jines of equal elevation, each case will present some peculiarities which must be met, as they are presented, by the topographer's own resources; and as on the ordinary scales of topographical surveys a limit of minuteness of detail must be fixed, a sound management of work, established by experience, will find its strength resting upon a discrimination between important and trifling features, and a read~- decision of what to omit as well as what to include. Labor may be spent in the development of small individual features which are comparatively lost on the scale of the work, while the features characteristic of the forms by oscillation, erosion, or abrasion, indicative of the forces producing the same, and which give dis tinctive character to the terrene, may he lost sight of in the too careful attention to minute details. The characteristic features of a terrene are, perhaps, best observed from a point nearly on the same level, but as between drawing features from above or below for a reasonable range, drawing from below is probably the better, as features viewed from any considerable height above am apt to appear flattened and much detail of undulation lost sight of. It is for this reason that the views of a mountainous region, from points between base and summit, are usually grander than tl10se from the extreme summit. But, since a precise representation of the teITene requires stations for positions at int(lrvals not too far apart, the necessity will not arise for ohsen·ing form of surface much above or below the point of observation. In the location and drawing of cur\Tes of equal elevation, the alidade is used both as a.level for the observation of objects the same height as t!Je instrument and for measuring angles of elevation and depression to points whose distances from the instrument are known, for the dete1·mination of their heights. Except for the questions of refraction and cur'\"ature of the earth, we have then the base ancl three angles of a right-angled triangle to find the perpendicular. The true level continuity of a curve of equal ele>ation should always be maintained and not deflected either above or below to include any special feature or accident of ground that may be found in any zone between two curves, but. touched by neither. In this case intermediate curves should be used in ground of regular form, and in ledges of rock and artificial works the actual contours should be drawn and heights determined. The vertical intervals at which curves should be drawn must be determined by the object and necessities of each case, and, in a measure, by the gentleness or abruptness of the slope. .A.s a

rule, with such features as prevail on the eastern coast of the United States, intervals of 20 feet are found to develop the form with sufficient detail on Toho scale, but, for purposes of construction, intervals of 5 feet or ernn Jess are often found desirable on larger scales. ·when the slopes are gentle, and little difference in height makes marked change in horizontal position, the use of the spirit Ie,·eling instrument is important and almost indispensable in locating curws accurately. In abruptly mountainous and comparatfrely inaccessible regions, where sketching must be relied upon, prevailing contours and 100-foot curves may silffioe to develop all necessary features. A level surface, having each point the same distance from the center of attraction (the center of the eartl1), is a spherical surface parallel to the surface of the sea. As the radii of such a surface are all vertical, a horizontal surface at any point ir.; tangent to the same, and while every level line is a curve in the spherical i;;urface 1 every horizontal line is a right line in the tangent horizontal plane. Since a ra~· of' ligl1t from any object to au obsen-er does not come to the eye in a right line, but is refracted by the atmosphere into a curved line, with its concavity tovrnrds the earth, the object appears above its true position, and requires for the true height a correction of the apparent height. This we term refraction, which varies in amount under different conditions of the atmosphere; but for topographical purposes it is sufficiently exact to consider it 1 h of the angle formed by the two \'erticals of tl.ie. point observed and the point occupied. Two Yerticals forming an angle of 1 second at the center of the earth include a distance of about 30 meters on the earth's surface. The deviations of the earth's curvature and refraction from the hol'izontal being in opposite directions, for short llistances may be regarded as compensating one another, but for accurate de· termination of difference of height between two points b~- le,·eling, the instrument should be placed equidistant between them, so that the amount of deviation from the lewl is equal on each side, and therefore compensated. For convenience, a table of heights for different. distances aud angles is used in tbe work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, in which correction is made for curvature and refraction.

Formula for determining heights by a 1~ertical angle antl distance.-The difference of len~l eonsists of two parts, that which arisei,.; from the angle of eleYation above the horizontal plane of the station, and that which is dne to the cnrnture of the earth. The former depends upon the angle and dis· tance, the latter upon the distance and the earth's ra<liu:-1. if a.' be the angle of elevation in minutes of arc, d the distance, h the height, then, as the tangent of 1' is 3 Ts-7, we have for the first part h = 34~17 a 1 d, if h and dare both expressed in the i;;ame units of length; but if d is expressed in meters and h in feet, one meter lJeing 3.28 feet, we get h = nha a'1l. For the fraction T!hs we may conveniently and with suffieient accuracy put 10100 less ·i-o of 1 a1-6 0 , and thus firnl the nile: .Multiply the distance in meters with the number of minutes of m·c, point off tl1e thousandth part, and subtract the t1centieth part of the number thus obtained. This will give the first portion of difference of height, whether elevation or depression. The second term, depending on the curvature, varies as the square of the distance, and amounts to 0.22 foot in 1,000 meters, including the effect of ordinary refraction. As with the instruments under consideration extreme accuracy is not attainable, it is plain that for distances under 1,000

l'robably the best reference for heights of points on the earth\; smfaee is to thr mean lernl ot the sea, since the mean of any rise and fall of the tides is approximate\~- this h'vel. In practice, however, mean high water.is usually taken, as this includes all laud not coYmwl hy tlw tide rauge, aud is the line dividing land from water. It is well, in commencing the survey of a region hor<leriug on tide-water, to erect a ~igna1 at the assumed high water line, carefully noting the height of the t-0p of the tlag abO\·e the same, to he used for observing angles of depression for heights from JlOints occupied during the progress of the survey. As the heights of other points are determined in the course of the snrYtW, and verified h;y ohservations from or to two or three points, these in turn may be use-1 for the same purpose. It must not be forgotten, however, that the beds of rh'ers slope toward the sea, and that there is a gentle fall of the surface even of appa1·ent tide-le,·els towards the ocean. It is best, therefore, to make the O for heights at a 1>oint nearest the ocean. As the progress of topographical work is usually from the sJ1ore-line inward, this aft'orrhi the most favorable direction for drawing the curves of equal e]evatiou, and a8 it is deRirab\e that all work at a station shall be completed when it is first occupied, so as to aYoi1l the uecessit~· of retarni11g to it, the curves should be drawn by the eye from the shore-liue to the points sighted and detPrmined for position and height, to be checked by reverse drawing from those points when in turn occupied; and so from station t-0 station, drawing to and from in reverse will check and ,·erifY, between stations not too far apart, such comparativels small errorR of position as an accuratf' t\YC will soon learn to estimate. The heights of sufficientl.r close points must he determined to guard against any wide range of estimate of height by the eye. In abrupt slopes of considerable extent the use of a pocket cliuomekr is of mtwll value to de· termine the degree of slope, and to draw accordingly the curves by the widths of their zones (the cosines of angles of slope) from a paper scale prepared for the purpose. (See Fig. 46.) Illustration 61. The use of the alidade as a level for observing determined objects of the same height as the insnument is a valuable aid in locating curves, as is also the nse of a rod showing marks the same distance apart as the nrtieaJ dista.noo between the curves, for the purpose of locating with the alidade, as a level, the curve or curves immediately below the station occupied.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The two methods of surveying curves of equal .el1wation are known as the Regular and the Irregular methods. The &gular methods include1. Surveying and leveling the skeleton and its traverses. 2. Surveying and le,·eling the profile lines. 3. Surveying and leveling the base of each level section. 4. Surveying and leveling the parts of several level sections from one Rtation. 5. The division of the terrene into squares, triangles, or parallelograms. The profile is a traverse line on which are determined the heights of the points at which the surface changes slope. The points where this line is intersected by the succcssin· level e(juidistances are with the level and rod easily determinable. To determine the base of each level section the table is set up in position where this level intersects the profile, and using the alidade as a leveling instrument, with the target fixed on the staff at the height of the optical axis of the telescope, the line is traced by locating the aid by successive steps at characteristic points of the terrene, when the target comes in the horizontal plane of the 6ptical axis, direction and distance of the rod being determined and drawn in each case. A line drawn through these points, recognizing features between the stations, locates the curve. In this opera"tion allowance should be made for cun-ature and refraction, when the distance becomes sufficiently great to make it a factor. When parts of several level sections are run from one station, set np the table at a point in an equidistance curve, and observe on the staff the height of the optical axis of the alidade. Set the target on the staff above this height as many equidistances as its length will include. The aid carries the staff below the instrument and is signaled to stop when the target comes in the horizontal plane of the optical axis, and at successive steps traverses the lowel' curve. The target i~ then lowered on the staff one equidistance and the next curve above is in the same manner traced, continuing the proceeding until the level of the instrument is reached, when the table is moved to a.n upper station and the proceeding continued until the summit is reached. By the mode of regular division of the surface into squares, triangles, or parallelograms, pegs are clriven at regular intervals, and their heights determined by level in the way that may be most co11ve11ient, a spirit-leveling instrument being the most accurate. The Irregulcrr method consists in determining the positions arnl heights of a number of characterifitic points of the terrene, and in determining from these the tract's of tho curves. This is the method generally used in surveys embracing such areas as the sheets of the Coast ancl Geodetic Suney on scales of Toho arnl 20t,--.:rn· It lrns the merit that the dernlopment of the terrene proceeds with the surrny of the skeleton, and does not necessitate a return t-0 a station when once occupied. In connection with the determination of position by resection it works harmoniously and economically, since points that would be selected for position as having tlie best outlook are likely to be the characteristic ones of the terrene.
ADJ[JSTJIEKT OF THE XEW .ALIDA.DE FOR THE OBSERVATTOY OF ALTITUDES.

The telescope can be turned about itself within the short tube on the transit-axis through which it passes. Two stops define the poflitions in which the wire is horizontal. In order to adjust the horizontal wire to the level (i.e., to have it point horizontally when the striding-level in<licates that the collars on which it rests are level), proceed thus: 1. .Adjust the striding-level by reversing it end for ernl and correcting its error-half the difference by its own adjustment, half by the tangent-screw of the telescope. 2. Point the telescope to a target and note the reading, or make a mark where the wire points when the bubble is in the mid(Ue. 3. Revolve the telescope about itself, put the level on again, aud note the reading, or mark the place where the telescope now points when the bubble is in the middle. 4. The mean of the two pointings is the true level line, upon which tl.te wire is to be adjusted, which may be done in this way : point the wire to the mean of the two observations by the tangentecrew; then, by means of the adjusting-screws, bring it to point on the lower reading, if the second

reading has been higlt, and viee versa. If now brought back to the mean by the tangent screw, tl1e bubble should be in its place; and, when the telescope is turned back iuto its first position, tlle adjnstment_should verify. 5. If it is now desired to make the vernier read zero on the vertical arc, the table nurnt Le carefully leveled; all<l in order to do this more perfectly than can be done with the circular lew~l, it may be done by observing the striding-level; the telescope remaining clamped, the striding-level should read the same in every position of the alidade wlieu the table is perfect!~- level. (In general, tl1is will be found too delicate a test, as the table is not sufficiently even for so sensitiYe a level to be employed.) The table being leveled, move the telescope vdth the tangent-screw until tbe bubble is in the middle, and then set the vernier to read zero; the screw-holes in it are oblong·, so that it admits of being pushed either way. 6. lt is easy to have tlie adjustmeuts near enough to serve for running curn$ of equal elention, bnt in determining the heights of stations, it is best to make the oliservations complete, with reversals, hoth of level aml of telescope, taking the mean of the observations, by which the errors of adjustment are eliminated. This, in fact, is always doue with the theodolite, and should be equally done with the alidade when precision is required. The following may serYe m; an example:

It will be seen, from analyzing this observation, that the level was one-half minute out of adjustment, t,he horizontal wire one and one-half minutes, and that rernlving the telescope about itself' changed its relatfon to the index on the vernier by 1'. '!'he mean is free from all errors of adjustment.
DU:lTAN~E.

Distance is measured eitlter directly by successin1 contiguous units of auy conventional standard, or by some instrumental process of triangulation upou a dfrided or marked staft', or from the two ends of a measured base, known as parallax. In the first case the essentials are that the measurement shall be made horizontally, or the inclination observed and reduced to the horizon; that a right line of direction shall be followed, or the deflections eurefnlly observed ancl reduced to a right line between the extreme poiuts, aIHl that the contact of the extremities of the successive units shall be as exact as possible. For precise measurement, temperature should be observed, antl all lengths reduced to one temperature, usually 60° Fahr. The instrumental methods in plane-table surveys are either witl:i two ltorizontal fixed lines on glass or webs in the .diaphragm of the alidade telescope, which subtend variable lengths on a

In practice it l1as been found that an extension-rod, with targets 6 meters apart, may be used for details, to 800 meters, without important graphic error, on the usual scales of topographical snrvess, with a micrometer, whose unit of division= 2".31 of arc (see illustration 58). By these methods 400 meters may be measured within 1 meter, which on the usual scales of plane-table work is inappreciable, and within the probable changes of the dimensions of the paper liy l1ygrometric iuflueuces. l:ly the method of fixed l!nes in the diaphragm the angle remains constant and the cbortl variable, and hy the micrometer method the chonl remains constant and the .angle variable.

Sometimes one. of these targets is fixed at the top of the staff. We will first consider the use of a staff with two movable targets, and afterwards indicate the modifications necessary in using a staff with one fixed target. The face of the target is ordinarily didded into four equal rectangles. Two of these. ou the same diagonal, are white; the others are red. The line 1'' F' (fiducial line), resulting from the ·opposition of colors, is visible with great distinctness. The distance between the fiducial lines of the targets is read on the back of the staff. 2. A telescope to which is attached a vertical arc, for measuring the angle of the optical axis with the horizon, and which is supported on a tripod. (Illustration 59, Fig. 40.) The telescope is composed of two double convex lenses, inserted in a cylindrical tube blackened iusiue. The lens directed to the object is called the "object-glass"; it receives the rays of light coming from the object. These rays, refracted within the tube, form an inverted image "ab'' of the object A:B at the focus, where the diaphragm carrying the cross-hairs is inserted. The diaphragm, whieh is perpendicular to the optical axis, is fixed in cylinder sliding in the principal tube with a gentle friction. It has two very fine threads crossing-at right angles, the point of intersection being in the optical axis. For measuring distance a third line (horizontal) is inserted, aud sometinws a fourth one (l10rizontal). It is only in this particular that ordinary telescopes differ. The eye-glass serves to magnify the image of the object. It is a magnifying glass placed bet\"l'eeu the eye and tl1e image on the diaphragm, and is adjustable according to the eye of the observer. The cylinder carrying the eye.glass has a small opening for the eye of the observer. To sight an ol\ject it is ftrst necessary to.set the eye-piece-to bring the eye-glass nearer to or removed from the diaphragm-until the cross-hairs are distinctly visible. Unless this is done the ohject sighted will be an illusive one. To verify the adjustment, let the image be viewed as obliquel;y as possible. It must always appear to coincide with the web8, wliatever the 1msition of the eye may be. The extent of the eye-piece being thus regulated, the telescope is in adjustment and· the diaphragm in the focus. The distance t1 from the image of an object to the object-glass is called the focal distance. It depends upon the remoteness, D, of this object. If D is infinite, it is a minimum, and is then named "the principal focal distance.'' Tl1cre (·xists between dD and the principal focal distance/ the relation

The distance/ can be determined experimentally for each object-glass. In topographical telescopes it never exceeds 30 to 40 centimeters. The reach of these telescopes is about 700 to 800 meters. Adopting for f the "alue Qm,35, we compute "d" by the above formula, and substituting for D different values, we find that within the usual limits of observation, from 20 to 800 meters, the focal variation does not attain one centimeter, and that it is more sensible in short than in long distances. · The relations between D and d are found to be as follows :
D= 20m
D=lOOm

d=Om.35623 d=Om.35123
d=Om.35120

D=l02W D=200W B=300m D=400m D=410m D=700ID D=715rn

d=Om.35061
d=Om.35041

d=0 00 .35031
d=Om.35030 d=Om.35017 d=Om.35017

The.se results prove besides, that beginning with 100 meters, the focal variation for distances above 100 meters amounts only to few tenths of a millimeter, a quantit~· inappreciable in the telesco}le, however delicate the mechanical contrivance for setting the eye-piece. It is only by a mere accident that the diaphragm is at the exact focus, because its position is the result of approximations by which we judge whether it is in the focus, but it will still seem to be so if it is moYed slightly either way the fraction of a millimeter. We are setting the same not to measure the focal distance, but simply to view the staff distinctly, so as to set with facility and certainty the targets to the intended height. We insist.on this observation, because it does justice to the idea of measuring the focal distance d, corresponding to the remoteness D, on the tube of the telescope, and of computing D by the formula 1 1 1

n+II=J

the quantity "!" having previously been determined with great precision. It is proposed to measure the distance D of the object-glass from the staft· by the height" H" intercepted on this staff between two fixed threads of the diaphragm. Or, supposing the statf parallel to the plane of the diaphragm, if we re1n>esent by h the interval between the two threads S andL. · (Fig. 41.) It follows from the similarity of the triangles FOF' and SOI D : d : : H : h, or

D=Hxh
the fundamental relation of the theory of the relem~ter.

d

H is read on the staff, but the ratio~ cannot, as previously shown, be obtained with precision.
So the problem is not susceptible of an exact mathematical solution. The interval h being known, if we take from a table of distances, computed for a certain telescope, the value of d corresponding to an estimated distance, D, we obtain a Yery approximate solution, even if the estimate of D should contain an error of 100 meters. But this manner of proceeding, a very tedious one, because it would necessitate for each distance to be measured a computation of the ratio-:, would not give an idea of the obtained approximatfon, and would, besides, present the inconvenience of requiring the previous determination of h. The practical way to avoid the direct measurement of "h ", and the necessity of determining an approximate value of

i

for each of the distances D to be observed, is as follows:

corresponding to a known distance, D'. We arrive at the same supposition by substituting in the

formula D = H x ~ for the quantity multiplying H, a constant

f = C.

Assuming this hypothesis, we conclude that the values. obtained for the distances to be measured are the products of a constant coefficient, c, and the heights of the rod intercepted between the threads of the diaphragm called "read distances"; we designate them by 6 to distingnish them from the true distances, D. Before commencing operations with the telemeter we determine the constant coefficient, C, by an experimental standard reference. For this purpose we measure with a chain or rod on level ground a distance AB=D'. (Fig. 42.) Place the telescope on station A, its object-glass in the vertical plane of this poi11t, iiR optical axis directed horizontally to the staff held vertically by an aid in B. Having set the same with the utmost care, let the fiducial lines F and F' of· both targets come successiYely under the threads L and S of the diaphragm. N-0te the interval FF 1 =H', separating both targets, viz, the height of the rod, and from the proportion D' : d' : : H' : h follows

d' D' li=C=H

Supposing D'=140 meters and ll'=Om.so, the constant coefficient will be
1 C= 0.80 ~=175.

Repeat this operation several times, and if the values found for C differ only very little, adopt the arithmetical mean for the value of the coe1Hcient. The coefficient of the telemeter being thus known, we get the reduction to the horizon of any desired distance as follows: Establish the telescope on station P (Fig. 43), the object-gla&s in tbe vertical of tbis point, its optical axis directed to the staff kept vertically in Q; bring it carefully in the focus, and bring suc~vely the fiducial lines F and F' under the threads L al\(i S of the dia· phragm, and record the interval H=FF 1· We find that the distance A for the distance D of the object·glass from the staff Li=HxO If H=2m.415 and 0=175, we have 6 =2m.415x175=422"'.625. 2d.

therefore, hence, we have in this case the real distance, D, equal the read distance minus 1m,401, or 5oom-1m,~01=498"1.599. Making the experimental standard reference for a distance, D', equal to or in excess of thl' mean between the greatest and least distances to be measured, we may neglect in topographical surveys, without an appreciable graphical error, the correction 1: and take the read distance t:::. for the true distance D. In reality, the relation (2) shows that D' having been chosen in such a manner, the numerical value of Z will in all cases be smaller than J, because J never exceeds from 35 t-0 40 centimeters,

It is well understood that in case of subsequent computations the smallest correction of J: should be considered. But in this case, to avoid the computation of the focal distance IJ corresponding to ea.eh observation, we replaee in equation (2) the variable b by the constant repre:>enting the focal distance of the s~ndard reference by trial. The error resulting from this substitution is entirely insensible in practice, especially if the distance D' is taken between the indicated limits. If the line of sight is not horizontal, which happens in measuring distances on a slope, thl~ station is ma.de at one end of the slope and the manner of proceeding should be slightly modifte1l. This does net necessitate a. change in the standard reference, because the topographer can select the ground for this trial.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The constant coefficient C of the telemeter being thus known, let the reduction to the horizon of the distance PQ be determined from the point P. (Fig. 43.) Station the telescope in P, the object-glass in the vertical of this point and the optical axis directed to the fiducial line of the upper target, fixed at a convenient height. Then bring the fiducial line F' under the upper thread and note, first, the angle a which the telescope makes with the horizon, and, second, the height of the rod FF' =Il. This makes, as in the general case, the read distance = L'.\ II x U. It remains to determine OB=D, the reduced distance. The staff held perpendicularly is not parallel to the diaphragm, which, as before mentioned, is perpendicular to the optical axis; so that the fundamental proportion cannot be furnished by the triangles FOF 1 and SOI. From F' draw the perpendicular F'N on the optical axis; the two triangles F'ON and SOI being similar, we are brought back to the general case, and we obtain · 1 ON=NF xc+.r, designating by I the focal correction. But, NF'=H cos NF'F=H cos therefore, because

a,

rom which and OB=OF COS a= 6 COS 2 a+I cos a+H sin a cos a. This is the formula for the reduction to th: horizon of distances observed with the telemeter. If we work on a small scale and have chosen the distance for standard reference, as before mentioned, we may neglect the last terms :E cos a and H sin a cos a. This is done in the war department of Belgium, where, in work projected ona scale hho is adopted for the read distance 6 =H x C, and for the reduced distance D= 6 cos 2a. It must not be forgotten that a is the ang1e which the optical axis makes with the horizon, and not the inclination /1 of the straight line pa8sing through the extreme ends of the distance PQ. To determine 6 cos 2a 7 6 and a being known, a simple computation with logarithms is suffi. cient, but this determination is facilitated by a table giving from degree to tlegree the reduced · I distance for 6 =10, 20, 30-90 meters.

All said in regard to the operation with two movable targets applies in the use of a staff whose upper target is fixed. To measure, for instance, the reduced distance of PQ (Fig. 43), select the station either at the foot or at the top of the slope. Suppose we station in P; establish the object-glass vertically over this point, direct the optical a.xis to the fiducial line F of the fixed target of the staff, kept vertically in Q. Let the fiducial line F' of the movable target come under the upper thread S of the diaphragm. The vertical position of the staff could be assured by means of a plumb-line attached to the top of the sta.ff, but this is accomplished in a more complete way through adaptation of a circular level, placed under the eye of the aid, who is thus enabled to correct instantly the lateral deviations and deviations within the plane of vision. Note ftNt the angle a which the optical axis makes with the horizon. Second, the height of the staff FF' = H, and t:!J.e computation OB is made in the same way as explained in the preceding. A so.called telling staff is very often used, because its division turned towards the observer is visible with such distinctness that the observer is enabled to read directly the height of the fixed target above the vision line. It is apparent that this staff does not need a movahle target. The work with a staff with one fixed target is done more rapidly than with a staff whose both targets are movable. If we try the standard reference on level grouml with the former one, we ought to consider iil the computation for the constant coefficient C1 the inclination a of the optical axis; but we avoid this complication by operating thus: Station the instrument, the telescope horizontal, on ground slightly inclined; the aid descend:> the slope and is stopped at a point where the upper target is under the thread L of the diaphragm ; the distance D', separating this point from the station point, is then measured by the chain horizontally, and the height of the staff H, intercepted between the threads L and s, determined and we

PQ =OF= H x cos a + l: - H sin a We·ha.ve enjoined, as a general rule, that the thread L be directed to the upper target and not the thread S', or, in other words, to use the threads Land 8 in preference to those of S and S'. One of the reasons by which we have boon guided is as follows: If we intersect the uppel" target by the threadLwhich meets the optical axis in I, we obtain besides Hand a the height at which the axis passes above the observed point, and we have thus all the necessary elements for the computation of the difference of the height of the extreme ends of the line to be measured. If we do not require this difference of height, we employ the threads S and 8'. Enlarging thus h we diminish C, which is an advantage, considering the precision, but an inconvenience considering the rapidity of operation, because the greater h is1 the shorter must be the distances to be obserYed.11
PROJECTIONS FOB FIELD SHEETS.

It is presumed that determination has been made, by triangulation, of points most suitable for the use of the topographer who follows with the plane-table work, and that a sketch of the same is at hand, giving an approximate skeleton map of the area to be surveyed. The location or orientation (as it is sometimes called) of the sheet is then based upon several important considerations. It may be taken as a rule that the intervisibility of the points extends .across valleys, from summit to snmmit, or across rivers, bays, and other bodies of water. So that generally the line of greatest depression of the valley (Thalweg) should follow as nearly as practicable the middle of the sheet, regard being had for any abrupt change of direction or importance of lateral features; or, in other words, the subjects to be surveyed should be divided as far as possible into water basins, extending from divide to divide, and not center upon a ridge forming portions of two basins. The reason for this being, that from either slope of the basin points are visible on the opposite summits which will be common to the sheets which include the adjoining valleys, while from the middle of the valley points will be visible on both summits. From the written descriptions of the points determined, discrimination should be made in regard to their temporary or permanent character. A flag in a tree is likely to have disappeared soon after its ·aetiermination, and the usual cut of a triangle in its bark may have disappeared before the lumberman's ue, while a church spire, a light-house, a house chimney, a copper bolt in a rock, or a bottle buried beneath the surface of the ground, is more likely tA> be reeovered and to be of service to the topographer. Two intervisible points, one of which may be occupied, or three ina.ccessible points, &re all that are absolutely necessary upon a sheet for the commencement of work, for from, or upon these, al1 other points required may be determined, and it is oftener more important, from considerations of economy of time and facility for work, to have more regard for comprising the topogra.phical subject in its entirety, where points may be determined at convenience, than to fnrnish a ltLrg8 number of determined points at the expense of the best orientation of the sheet in regard to topogra.phical details. In flat sections where the vertical question is scarcely a factor, the main question. i8 generally a plan that will comprise the area with the fewest sheets compatible with a suflieient overlap of common points; and where the object is a. survey of one side of a river or ether body of water, points on the opposite shore should be included where pogsible. Where it is possible, the sheet should be located by one familiar with the peculiar t.opogra,phy of the region to be surveyed, and with some knowledge from observation of the relative value of the points between which there may be any necesaity for discrimination. Where the surface is broken without any marked basins of large area, and when the sheet, on the scale determined upon, will comprise several successive baains&nddividing ridges, the consideration of reach from higher to highe~ summits should control as in the reach over one valley; thereby affording the best means for determintng position and any de.sira.ble anxilia.ry points in the lower i~edia.te summits and in the vCllleys. Points at the jwtetion of continent streams have MualJy large arcs of visibility, and are conse·

quently of great value for purposes of orientation. If, therefore, such a point should be near but off tbe edge of a sheet of regular dimensions, and from the necessities at the opposite edge cannot be included by it, it is often well to extend the length of the sheet so as t;o include the point, even though there may be no intention to complete topographical details upon the additional piece. Light-houses are often of this character, the reasons governing the selection of their positions for light purposes having equal weight in the selection of such positions for survey signals. The question of the mode of seasoning paper for use on the plane-table is an important one. It is well known that by the exposure on the table in the :field of the usual linen paper (What· man's) backed with muslin, the result in most cases is a permanent contraction of its dimensions. The sheet while in use in the field, although shaded when the table is set up at a station, is fre· quently exposed t;o the direct rays of the sun while the table is m<n·ed from station to station This, probably, has the effect of evaporlting much of the moisture in the paper and producing permanent contraction. It would, therefore, seem a reasonable proceeding to subject the paper for some time before the projection is made to the same conditions it is compelled to meet in tlie field, so as to reach as nea.T1y as possible the minimum dimension now produced by field use. Seasoning by exposure to the sun in the open air would, therefore, seem to afford the conditions for the desired result. A sketch giving the triangulation points and the approximate shore-line comprised in the area to be surveyed, being before the draughtsman, he proceeds as follows : The limits of the sheet having been determined, the middle meridian A (see illustration 60) is located and drawn, and its intersect.ion with the most central parallel determined, at which point the perpendicular B is erected. The number of minutes of latitude on the central meridian, above and below the central parallel, being known, take the corresponding distance from Table VI, "Projection Tables," C. S. Report, 1853, Appendix No. 39, from under the head "Meridional Arcs," and lay it off (C) above and below the central parallel; and with the same distance as radios, strike arcs D D D D above and below from near the extremities of the perpendicular B. With a well-tested straight edge draw lines EE through the north and south minutes on the central meridian, and tangent to the two ares DD, t;o the right and left. This gives three parallel lines perpendicular to the central meridian. From the same Table VI, from under the heads "Lengths of Ares of the Parallels," take out the value corresponding to the number of minutes of lcmgitude, east and west of the central merid. ian, and lay off the whole distance FF'F" on each perpendicular, taking each distance from its appropriate latitude. Subdivide these into minutes GG'G". For the areas usually covered by plane·table sheets the corrections X, for determining the abscissas from the arcs of parallels (Table VI, head "Co.ordinates of Curvature.") are inapprecia· ble, and may be disregarded; the ordinates Y only being used. These give the distances to be set off from the lines B and E, perpendicularly toward the pole, for each minute of longitude counting from the central meridian. For ordinary field projections of scale 1 -otn the ordinate of the extreme minut;e only need be used, and tbe parallel drawn a right line from the point so found t;o the central meridian. This ordinate H being set off on each of the parallels, the meridians are all drawn in with a, fine ruling pen, then subdivided into minutes, and the parallels carefully ruled in through the points of subdivision. The projection is verified by applying the measure of a number of minutes of latitude and longitude, and by a comparison of diagonal measurements on different parts of the sheet. All measurements should be carefully taken from the scale with a keenly pointed beam-compass, and the marks pricked in the paper should be as light as possible to be seen, so as to insure the grea.~t possible aoouracy. The draugbt;sman is supplied with a list of triangulation points, which gives their relative dis. tances, their latitudes and longitudes, and also the equivalents in meters of the seoonds of latitude and longitude, according to which the points are n.ow plotted on the sheet by measuring from the corresponding minutes. Thus in the diagram the distance J represents the seconds of latitude ; K, the seconds oflongitude oHhe trigonometrical point. The aeeu.racy of the plotting is tested by a measurement of the respective distances between

200

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

the points with a beam-compass, these distances being also given. The latitude and longitude are then plainly marked, usually on the north and east sides of the sheet, at one extremity of each parallel and meridian, and the pencil marks erased. It sometimes becomes necessary to base t-0p-0graphical work upon a detached scheme of triangulation, before the usual astronomical observations have been made. In this case the only elements given are the distances from the points to two projected arcs of rectangular co-ordinates (which are assumed) aud the distances between the points. The projection for plotting these consists simply of axes of ordinates and abscissas so laid on the sheet that it will embrace all the points required hy the surveyor, and in the manner most convenient for his work; and the points are plotted from these by the intersection of two arcs with the distances of the points from the axes as radii, either north or south, east or west of the axes, as the plus or minus signs given ma.y indicate. The only test is by the distances between the f>oints, and there should be at least two from each. If the work be correctly done, a regular projection can be constructed on the sheet after it is finished and the required astronomical work is completed. In case it so happens that for some special purpose it becomes urgent to undertake a piece ·of topography, when neither the data for projections nor co-ordinates are at hand, plotting by distances is the only resource left, and, of course, great care is necessary. When a sheet has no projection it is advisable to draw squares of 1,000 or any specified number of meters on it, by means of which the projection can ultimately be laid down correctly.

In the annnal reports of the Superintendent of the Coast Snffey for lSGG, 18G8, and 18i2, there appeared certain papers on the determination of time, latitud(', an(l azimuth, originally intended to form part of a proposed Coast Sun·e~· manual of field operations. Their o~ject was to facilitate the fielcl and office work IJ,y presenting in a concise style, methods and formnhe, references to instruments, forms of record and arrangement of redudiuns. These papers are, therefore, of an entirely practical character, intended to asl5ist the obsen"er and computer and to secure as grPat. uniformity as possible in the treatment of the al'.'tronomical work.

The demand for this edition by those officially connected with the Survey, as well as by others engaged on work of this character, made it desirable to issue a new edition, advantage of which was taken to introduce the telegraphic determination of longitude, and such additional matter and improvements ail had suggested themselves from experience during the past years; also to replace iu part older form3 of instruments by illustrations exhioiting some of more modern construct.ion. The separate papers on each subject are now consolidated and the whole is presented subdivided into four parts. The subject-matter of the following pages ~-ill be 8trictly confined to the expo1'ition and use of portable instruments, namely, the transit instrument for the determination of time and longi· tude, the zenith telescope for latitude, and the theodolite for azimuth, and will include the use of the combination or meridian tt>lescope for the first two operations, also of the transit, in an~, of its forms, for the last.named or azimuthal determination.

(l) General remark.~ on the u.~e of the transit instrument.-Tllis paper exclusi.-eJ~- refers to tile portable transit instrnment, in any of itR forms, as used in tlie Coast and Geotletic SnrYer and when mounted in the plane of the meridian for the purpose of obtaining local time from obsen·atiorn; of transits of' stars o\·er its threads or lines, in con11Pdion with an astronomical c loek or a chronometer regulated to sidereal time. The use of the instrument when mounted iu the wrtical plane of a close circumpolar star out of the meridian has not r;~comnwn rlcd itself on ae<'ount of its greatt'r complexity, both in field and office work, as compared witli the usual metl10d, espeeiall~· when coni:;idering the ea~e with which a transit may be placed approximately in the meridian, thf' chronometer <;orrection being generally roughly known, or may readil,y be kncnn1 in ath-am·e of placing the instrument. Nor is the instmment used Oil the Snrn'y with its telescope in the iirime Ycrticalfor latitude purposes. The obscr'\"ations are either made by the method of" eye and ear," or hy chron{\graphic registration-the former for nearly all purposes, excepting for tc·legraphic longitude work, for which latt~:ir au automatic record is always preferred. Iu using the first method the observer will of course mark his owu time; that is, he will pick up the beats of the chronometer and carr,v them forward mentally up to the time of transit of the star which he will estimate to the nearest tenth of a second. This method is alwa;\'S used for slow-mo,·i11g stars. (2) Description of the transit instrument.-'l'wo sizes of portable transits arc employed on the SnrYey-the larger and ohler ones made by 'froughtou antl Simms of London, almoilt exclusively used for the telegraphic determination of astronomical longitudes and generally for moon culminations before 184u, in which J·ear the telegraphic methotl came iuto rnse; the srnalle1· ones, marl.e by Wiifllemann and others, of "Washington, to sene for the determination of the local time needed for astronomical azimuths, or latitudes, or other minor purposes. In the hands of skillful obserYers these two classes of instrument giYc almost equally good rc·sults, and the~· compare favorably with the mnch larger transits usually employe(l at astrouomical observatories, whert> special difficulties are encountered in consequence of the greater difficulty of reversal of axis, and the more serious eft'ect of :fleirure. In case of necessity, and when an approximate degree of accuracy suffices, auy ordinary astronomical theodolite or altazimuth instrument may he converted temporarily into aml used as a transit. The larger-sized transits ha,-e a telescope of ahont 117crn or forty-six inches focal length, with a clear aperture of ahout 7cm or 2~ inches, an<l magnifying powers, as generally used in connection with prismatic eye-pieces, Yaryiug between 80and120 diameters. An instrument of this kind is shown on the first of the accompanying plates. (Illustration (i2). Originally they had no reversing apparatus. All of them ha,·e since b<>en proyidPd with reYersing apparatus, which raises, turns, and lowers tlie telm;cope by means of an eccentric cam, renderin~ tile former clnmRyand risky reYersal by haucl now an operation a8 expeditious as it is safe. Of late these instruments have also been supplied ":ith a delicate ether level and a larger circh' in the 1ilace of one of the old finders, for the purpose of latitude determination, and their eyP-piece micrometer can now be turned 90 degrees, so as to answer equally for horizontal and Yertieal differential measures. They also have glass diaphragms. Thus equipped, these instrumPnts can be made to do service for time, longitude, la.titn<le, and azimuth ohserYations, as will be shown further on. One of the srnallersized transit iustrnments is shown on illnstratiou No. !i3. Its clrnracteristic featm-e is the folding frame, which renders it exceedingly portable and handy for immediate use.

Instruments of this kind are reYersed hy han!l. The corn hi nation iwitrumcnt shown in illustration G4, known as David:son's tran:sit and equal altitndl· instrument, was deYised b~- AssiRtant George Davidson in 185~~· to answer ·both for determination of time arnl latitnde (and if need be for longitude and azimuth). Its chief peculiarity is its re\·ersing frame of hroa1l hasiR, with scale and micrnmdPr attached to facilitate setting the telesc·ope quickly in the plaue of the meridian, arnl an improwd clamp not liable to disturb the horizontal axis of the telescope when the azimuth screw usually attached to oue of the y· is slightly mo\·ed for pnrpo.~e;; of atljm;tment.t It has all tile needed attaclunent,; for nse as a zenith telescope. This iustrumeut will be further referred to under the article LatitudP, or in Part II of this paper. In Po1111Pctio11 with this instrument Assistant Da.-idsou prepared a table gidng azimuth a11d apparent altitude of Polaris for field use in placing the meridian instrument in the plane nfthe meridian, which spe iu Coast Surwy lfoport for 1870, Appendix No. 2:!. This instrument carries a telescope of about i"W 111 Pl! inches) focal length, of an aperture of about (icm,7 (2~ inches), which hears a magnifying power of J 00 diameters, aud will permit the observation of stars of the seventh magnitude. Illustration (i;"i show" a prismatic transit of tlie Steinl1eil pat.tern (as proposed b~- him iu August, 18491 in the :\stronornische N;whrichteu, Yol. XXJX, p. 177, with plate). It is, moreover, completely fitted for latitude work on tl1e princiJlle of the zenith telescope. The details of the con!ltrnction, as made by the firm Fauth arnl !'.o., of Wm1hi11gtou, were designed by Mr. H. N. Saegmnller, mechanician to the Coast and Geodetic 8nrvey. Instruments of tliis form possess great portability, and are, thereforP, specially suited for use in monntainouR (·onntries. 'l'he horizontal axis of the instrument, for transits in tl1e nwritlian and for latitude work on tbe principle of the zenith telescope, is adjusted to the phrne of the prime vertical so that by rotating it to point to the proper zeuith distance an;r star in the meridian may he macle to transit over the threads or lines of the diaphragm. This axis ii'i s1wcially gnardecl against flexure, and is really a donhle tuhe; the pivots, of 5cm diameter, are of phosphor-bronze. At one entl it carries the prism with which the objective is almost in contact; the prism by complete iutemal reflection bends the rays of light coming from the star and directs tllem to the focns of' the eye-lens fixed at the opposite en<l of' the axis. It has three sets of' double a-Ojnsting aml holding scrcwR for adjustment, and two other screws for fastening it in its cell. 'l'he aperture is 6°"' for the larger and 5cm for the smaller size; focal leugth, about 64cm (25 iuches). A small l10k in the hiwk of the cell of the prism admits of tlrn usual illumination of the field, which has sen!n vertical fixetl li1ws, and one movable line at right angles connected with the micrometer for latitude work. Tbe diameter of the wrtical circle is 15cm, and carries a delicate ether le.-el as well as a small rough lewl to SPTTe, when the circle is nF>Pd, as finder. A striding-level is proi;ided for the horizonfal; axis also a rernrsing apparatus, as shown in the plate. The clamp is applied at the middlt' of the axiH. l:'.°!iiuall,y the transit instruments are litted in their fot~al plane with 5 or i threads or lines, single or don hie, ruled on glass and placed vertically for the observations of tl1e transit of stars. Hesilles these the diaphragm generally has two close horizontal threads or lines, between which the star is m:ttfo to traverse Uw fiC'l<l during transit. For telegraphic· operatious and in connection with a l'lironograph there were formerly used diaphragms of not less than 25 threads, arranged in 5 tallies of ti\·e tbrnnds eaeh; these wer<' soon snpphrnted by gla8s diaphragms, hy which greater permanency of the liucs a11d of the intl'rvals was 1mcnrcd.

is limited by a slide with a circular opening, which is moved by the obsetTer successiwl.1 over thP lines as traversed u,y the star. The instruments arc supplied with prismatic p~·e-pieces, cx<'cpt those of the Steiubeil form, which do not require them. The finders of these instruments are usually about 10<"' (4 inches) in diameter. and rarely less tlian about!!""' (;~~inches). They can be read hy 11wam; of verniers to Hingle miuuteR, arnl if the telescope bas two finders one may he graduated to read zenith distances, the other to read altitudes: otherwise the olJsener's convenience may be suited .. The striding-level is filled with ethn, hermetically closed, and su11plied with a chamber to regulate the length of the bubble at all temperatures. The sensitiveness of the level ma~· he such that a change of one second of arc is represented by a motion of the bubble of 011e millimeter. 'When the portable transit is used with the sole object of obtaiuiug local time it is 11ot customary to make au,y use of a mercurial or artificial horizon, nor is there any azimuth mark put up, though the latter may be conYenieut to quickly replace the instru· ment in the meridian in case of any disturbance. If a mercurial horizon i;; used, and the reflected images of stars arc observed, one of the most simple and effoeti \'e wa~·s to shelter the mercury from tlte direct force of the wind is to place the mercury trough at the bottom of the junction of two tubes, one pointed a short distance upwards towards the instrument, the other passing through a hole in the side of the o!J:serrntory, and protected with an outside covering of a piece of mosquito bar or lace. The mercurial film horizon,· in which Yibrations are speedily extinguishe(l, innlnted by J\lr. ·T. H. Lane, of the --weights and :Measures Office, was found to require delicate handling, tlie film;; heing liable to fracture. (3) .Adjustment of the instrument.-The stone, brick or cement pier, block of woo<l, frame starnl or other support for the transit may lJe set approximatel,y in position with regard to the meridian h.Y means of a compass-needle, the magnetic declination being known and allowed for. The top of the pier is leveled and the frame of the instrument pla-ced in position, so that the transit axis coiucid1·,; as near as may be with the plane of the prime vertical; the adjusting-screws of the Y's, both for horizontal and wrti<ml motion, are place(l nearly in the middle of their position; the stri<ling-lrn~I is carefully adjusted, and the transit axis of the t{lleseope leveled. The threads are then placed in the focm; of the eye-piece and set vertical. The telescope is adjusted to sidereal focus with tlw diaphragm in the focus of the eye-piece. The adjustment for collimation may be effected by means of a distant object or by means of a collimating telescope, the axis being reYersed in its Y's during· the operation. This method suffices for the portable instrument, and gives a first approximation, to be afterward tested and perfected b;y means of transits of stars. If not otherwise known the local time may readily be obtained by the use of a sextant, with an accuracy within a fraction of a minute, and the latitude may be found either by a map or h~- the same i11strmne1it, the nearest minute of arc being 1mfficient. For the purpose of placing the transit in position, a small altitude and azimuth instrument may also very advantageously he used for ascer. taining with sufficient approximation the local time, latitude, and direction of the meridian. To point the telescope to a star when culminating, and supposing the finder t-0 read zenith distance!', we have for a star { ~ of tlle zenith : =

tions. When the frame of the instrument is in satisfactory adjustment its position on a stone or brick pier may be secured by embeddiug the foot-screws or bed-plate in plaster of Paris. (4) ltlethod of obsen:ation.-Generally, a series of observations commences with transits of stars selected to furnish instrumental corrections, then follow transits of so-called time-stars; and the night's work is concluded by again observing stars of the character first named. The deviation from horizontality of the transit axis is determined by level readings for each star, if possible, and the inequalit~· of pivots is to he allowed for. The Yalue of a division of the striding.level is ascertained b~- any of the methods explained iu connection with the zenith telescope and the effect of 1emperature is to be allowed for, if sensible. The collimation is ascertained by observing one-half of the number of stars with clamp east [or west]; then reversing the telescope and observing the remaining half, clamp west [or east]; or we may specially observe for collimation, noting the transits of a close circumpolar star over one-half of the threads, then reversing the telescope and noting the remaining transits over the same threads now presented in the reverse order; it is well to note the state of the level during each transit. The deyiation in azimuth is obtained from observations of stars differing considerably in declination (sometimes called high and low stars), but little in right ascension, or from observations of two close circumpolar stars, one culminating above the other below the pole, aud having a difterence of right ascension not differing much from 13 hours. It iR not safe to rely on the stability of the iJJstrumeut and the constancy of the rate of the chronometer hy obse1Ting the same star at upper and lower culminations next following. Knowing the reading of the azimuth-screw for any two states of the instrument in whiclt the azimuthal deviation has been determined, the value of one division of its micrometer-head becomes known. It is desirable that the sum of the azimuthal corrections for the circnmzenith stars nearly balance, and that for a11;r t.wo zenith stars the mean of' the tangents of their declinations equal the taug@t of' the latitude, or ~ (tan ,J +tan t')=tan cp, the deduced cltronometer-correction will then be free from any error in azimuth. In making up his observing programme, the observer, in the first place, may select his stars from the I,ist of Standard l\Iean places of Circumpolar and Time Stars, prepared for the use of the United States Coast Snrvey by Dr. B. A. Gould (seeond edition, Washington, 1866), or, more conveniently, he will take them from the collections girnn in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac (or from the English Nautical Almanac); should more stars be desirable, they may be selected from the fi\·e Greenwich catalogues, but, in preference to others, from the Field Catalogue of tl83 Transit Stars (mean places for 1870) prepared by Assistant G. Davidson in 1874; of this z

eatalogue printed co11fr·s can be supplied to observers. Hespecting the selection of circumpolar stars for instrmnental de\·iation, it is desirable that they should not be too close to the pole; that is, thc·ir motion should not be inconveniently slow. If more than one observer eng-ages in the same series of observations, their relative personal. NJ nation must be ascertained by methods explained in the telegraphic determination of longitudes.

Correction for inequality of pivots.

Tlle correction for inequalitJ' of pivots, supposing them eircular, applies directly to the level constant. If the same V girns level reading too great (is high) both before and after reversal of ustrnment, half the difference of the level correction is the effect due to the difference of diameters of the pivots; but if the east V shows high { baeh:e } and the west V high { ba~~i~e } reversal, half the sum of the level corrections gives the effect. The half of the effect is the correction to the level constant for ine<1uality of iiivots (the transit axis passing through the centers of the pivots),

The factor A is tabulated for various values for o aud ;. A will thus be found positive, except for stars between tlw zenith and pole. To find tlte azJnrnthal deviation from the transit of two stari-;, which differ considerably in declination: Let the observed times of transit hr- corrected for rnt1', iucli1mti1m, i111·11nalit,v of pi\·ots and collimation error; thena=(a'-a)=(t'=t) A'-A where a, t, A and «, t', A 1 arc the apparent right ascensions, times of trausit and azimuth factors respectively for the preceding and following star. It will he seen that A is {

culminates { ~~~~~~ } of the zenith and at the lower culmination it is also posith'e. For lower cnlminatious, the star's right ascension is to be increased o;v 1211 · It is desirable that the low star Rhonld diffor ornr ;,oo in declination from the high star and if two close circumpolar stars are observed, thefr right ascensions should differ 12 hours nearly.

Cori·eetion for diurnal aberration.
\Vhen great precision is rPquired, apply to the star's apparent right ascension the effect of the diurnal aberration = { ~ } 0·.021 cos <p sec

o for { ~~:: } culmination.

Ordinarily the correction for diurnal aberration may be include<l in that for collimation.

Personal equation.
Let the transits of a star over the first series of threa1ls, including or excluding the mid1lle thread, be noted by one observer and tlte remaining transits by the second obsen'er; reduce the observations of each to the mean thread by aid of the known equatorial inten·als, the difforence in the results will lie the personal equation. A number of stars may lie observed in this manner, with the obBervers leading alternately and the mean of all reisults should finally be taken. It is dcsira· ble that not less than twenty stars be observed. The method as described ahoYe is one of the hest known. Personal equation machines for either absolute or relative values may be em11loyed, provided the reliability of their indications has previously been established.

It is es,;ential for the pmper use of these formulre that the instrumental deviations should not l!ave changed tluri11g the interrnl of ohservation of the grou1). If the equations are specially used for the uetermination of the instrumental constants, the stars entering into the group should differ widely in declination and the axis shoul<l be rernrsed near the middle of the group; stars observed at their lower cuhniuation answer the same purpose as a reversal and should, if possible, lle included. If there is w~ason to think thttt tlie azimuth of tlie instrument has changed by reversal, an additioual unknown azimuthal deviation a' mu~t l>e introduced into the system of equations. In general it is not desiraule to increase the number of unknown quantities and equations for the purpose of finding from foein a most probable valne for tbe rate of the time-keeper, but to deduce it otherwise. Stars observed near and on both sides of the zenith, or between it and the equat-Or and with the transit axis in a direct and reversed position, may give the most accurate determination of the chronometer correction. If the eollirnation error is already known and the observed times are corrected for it, a and OT only require to he found; in t]lis case, the aboYe equations become-

He will do well to start the clock at such a time as to· imlicate, as nearly as may be, sidereal time all!l to regulate the rate, in order to make it as small as possible.

Value of 1 division of

Mean value ofp=-Od.337 ± Od,013 =-o·.024 ± o·.001 '.l.'o allow for inequality of pivots for position clamp west, the value + /3, as found by the level, must therefore be diminished numerically and for position clamp east, it must be numerically increased. Irregularities in the figure of the pivots will appear by successive level readings for every 10° of zenith distance north and south ancl, hy comparing with the mean of all readings, a correction can be deduced for any given position of the telescope and clamp. When the transit instruments are accompanie(l by a hanging level (as in the meridian telescope), the pivots may be tested for any zenith distance; instruments not provided with such a level may sometimes be tested by unscrew. ing the tubes car~'ing the object- and eye-lenses, after which the usual observations can be made as above. Specimen of record for value of one division of level by means of a level-trier.

The above level is evidently irregular, its curvature being different at different parts and flattest near the marked eml. For the portion of the scale near the middle, which is ordinarily used, we obtain the value l".08, derived from the four central differences corresponding to 10 whence 40 diYiRions of trier= 36.75 div. The observations should bf\ made at different and extreme temperatures, in order to ascertain any possible effect of temperature on the curvature or level value. \Yheu the level is furnished with a chamber, the bubble, during ordinary observations, should he kept at nearly the same length that was given to it in the experiments for value of level scale.
To (6.) Tabulation of factors.

The reduction of transits will be facilitated by a tabulation of the factors A, B, C (for which see appended tables), and it will be noted that A will be + except for stars between the zenith and pole, B will be + except for stars at lower culmination and C will be + except for stars at lower culmination; or Il and 0 will have the same sign. In 187 4 the Coast Survey published, in pamphlet form, more extended tables (the star factors .A., B, O, for reducing transit observations) than those appended; they are given t-0 three places of decimals. These tables were arranged by Assistant George Davidson.

Respecting time dder111inatio11 but little needs to h(· added to what has been giYen; the instrumental coustants are to be earcfo!ly detl>r111i11etl. the transit iustrnments are to be kept in close ad,iustmcnt, the stars are to he carefully selecte1l witl1 reference to position on the sphere as well as to aecurac~· of catalogue place, the transit!' arl" recorded automatically hy the chro11ograph and tu:o sets of time determinations are made, in the interval of which the exchauges of local times take phw.e between the two localitie~.

Ordinarily a set of time 1lett·nuinations consists of ohserYations of a circumpolar an1l of fonr circnmzcnith star,; (hrn north and two south of it); the transit axis is then reYcrsell aud four mor;· time stars and one polar star are ohserYed. Iu case of any defect additional starn ar<> ol·serw·l. Two :rnch 1<ets are taken <'ach night with tlie telegraphic exchange of signals bf't1reen thPm. "Titl1 respect to relative weights to be gfren to the individual results for longitml<' it 11ill lH· obsPrn~d that thP'1P nrn8t depend primarily on thP prolmhle errors of tl1e local ti111c·8 a,; 1lden11i111·1l at the two statio111<, next on the intenTal elapsed between these epochs of transit ohsnn1tiorn< m11l that of tlie nxchange of the longitude signals-that is, on the performance of the chronometers b~ which the times arc carried forward.

On any one workiug night two set,; of tra11s111issions ol' arbitrary signals or exchanges take place; the eastern station will transmit, say, 30 signals at irrf[Ju1a·r iBtern1ls of average d11ration of two seconds, and this is followed hy an eqnal unmher aml similar signals trarnnnitted from the western station. (2.) l'er.~onal eq11atio11.-As stated above, it is tl1e practice of the Surwy to try to eliminate the personal equation from the resulting longitude through the exchange of places of tlrn ohseiTPrs. mther than use ans of thP many forms of personal equation apparaLns.· 'Vhcrt' tlw PXt:hange is impracticable, pt>rhaps tl1e 111ost, sati8factoQT way of obtaining the personal equation is that of tapping transits of a star b~- the first observer over one-half of the lines of the diaphragm, and hy tlw secoud oh8erYer over the ren1aining half, aud to continue to obserYe a number of time stars (cirenmzenitL stars), the observers leading alternately, in which case ai1y error in tlw li11e interrnls is eliminated. Such obsenations sbonld be made before beginning the lougitmle work :proper, :tilll again after its completion. If we write down the personal equation between two obsen·ern, E aml W, in tlw sense that E- \Y =e imlicat.eR for a positi,,e e that observer E it'> later than observer \Yin other wort ls, that, B giYes for his estimate of the happening of an eYeut. more cbronomet<'l' 1inw than observer W, and for a negative e that)<} gh'es less time or is earlier than 'Y-we ham statt·d tbe fact, in it':l most simple form,t an<l we haYe a convenient rnlc to correct a resulting l011gitud1· for personal equation, viz: state the personal equation for eastern minus \Wstern oh~ern·r aml apply the corresponding yalne of e, with its algehraic sign to 1 or the re1mlti11g llifforenee of longi tmle, considered as essentially poiiitfre.

A second formation of the numeri1·al 1111a11titics of the conditional equation;;; and solution of tlle normal equations will girn the final results for iustrumeutal deviations and for local time. Iu this method, the apparent right ascensious of tl1e starti are made to refer to the equinox belouging to the fundamental star;;. For the rerluction of a set of transits by application of tlle nwtlirnl of leai:;t squares (for which ,.;ee part 1 of this paper), it if' recommernletl to introtlrice, iu the conditional equations, two azimnthal de\·ia.tiorn;: one to apply to the state of the inl'ltrumeut uefore, the other after, reYersal. It lllay ali,;o lwcome desirable to introduce a correction to the assumed honrl~· rate of the time.keeper, PSJH'l'i:tll~- if the ohscn-ations in a set are greatly cxtcndetl. The following example, showiug- the arrangemPnt of the r<'du<·tion of transit obsen·atious when wei;:d1b are applied, is given for the sake of completeness. The notation is the same as tlrnt previonsl,r used iu part I. It will gN1erall~- be found preferable, ou account of the lahorio11t< 1n·occss of forming aud solvi11g four normal equations, determining the co:Iimatiou, two azinmtlial deYiatio11s and tlw clock correct ion, to diYide the labor into two sets of t1rn 11ormal equation,:, one for damp eal'lt and the other for clamp west, proYided au indepeude11t azimuth cau he tinrn1l for eacl1. This treatment ii:; due to ~Ir. James J\'faiu, astronomical computer iu the ( 'oas! Surn·y. The field eompntation, or a first rongl1 reduction, will fnrnisl1 au approximate rn.lne for the collimation and of the homly rate of the clock for which the ohserrnd times of the tram;itH arc c01T1·cted, lea Ying the azimuthal deYi· atiou and the clock correction to be determined by two normal 1~quatious; for the seeonrl se.t, there result hrn similar normal equations, and the criterion for tlie cOJTPctuess of the reduction will br\ the tqnalify of the clock corrections, which apply to the epoch of tlw rerenwl of the in.~trumcnt.

Arrangement V: Circuits while exchanging chronometer signals. Circuits tltc same at both stati-0ns.-Tlle chronometer hreaks circuit A, the armature of tlte cl.Jronometer relay breaks the main circuit and the armatures of tile polarized relays [now-, in preference, the Farmer relays] break the circuits H at both stations; thus a record of chronometer signals sent and receirnd is made 011 the chronographs at hotll 1'tatious. [Unless a hreak-circnit chronometer of a rate greatl.v tlifleriug from sidereal time, say gaining or losing one secoud in one minute, is provided, such ordinary chrollometer signals are now little usecl for longitude work proper, as they repeat nearly the snnw fraetion of a second. Still they are usefnl for identification of the minute of difference of longitmle. J Arrangement \~1: Circuits while e:rdwngin(J arliitrary .~ignul,~. Circuit,s tlte same at both Ma tion8.-The rer·m·1l of the chronometer is made as iu ngure IY, causing breaks in circuits A and H Arhitrar.1 signals are mad1·, b,r breaking the main circuit with the signal or talking key and tlie armatures of the polarized [or oft.he Farmer] relays break circuits B at both stations. :X OTR.-The two polarized [or Farmer) relays are to be experimentally adjust~d so as to record Ycry nearly alike when the galnmometers haYe deflecti01u1 of a certain number of divisions on the tangent i'icale. The galrnuorneters placed in branch circuits in cases V and YI are to be adjusted to t11i.s clctlectiuu l>y regulating the resistance in the branch D U Y br means of the rheostat. It is 11rop0Red to m;e each set of instrumeuh; at eaeh station during one-half the work [before exchange of ohRerver and thus eliminate an,y consta111 tlifference in the records made hy the two polarized for Farmcrj relays. In the extensive longitude work of 1881 a new signal relay waH intr0tluee11, an irn;trument which pro\·ed superior to either the Jlolarizcd" or the Farmer relays ns<'<l i11 the precerli11g season. Its quickness of action depends mainly on the hollow and islit. cylinders which form its cmT·, on tlie shortiwss of the core au<l tbe distance of coils from the armature. ~Witlt these signal relays the matter of e11ualizing the currents was found to be of less importance and the halancing of the current.s was not. alwass insisted on when the time during whieh tlll' line wires were at the disposal of the party was short; it was l1owe··er attended to when tltP gah:wometer irnlicatious clilfored more from their normal indication than wai:; desirable. The arrangement of the telegraphic apparatus in the ohsernitories of 1881 is shown on the second Jllate accompanying this article, t·ide tlgnres VII and VIIr, which took the place of figures Y and VI of the old arrangement. (5.) Conclur1fog i·emarl~s.-'I'he oldest chronograpl1, kuown as Bond's spl'ing governor, thougli still or service, has been rirnle11 by the more portable Hipp fillet- or lmrrel·chronograph, regulate1l by a vibrating spring.t The uoise rnade hy these instruments is, however, \'ery ol~jectiouable. The new cylinder chrouograph of great accuracy, constructed by Fauth & Co., of \Yashingt.on, snpplied with a noil'lcless regulator, has imwed of great etticieue.y; it can be adjustetl for various speeds. Or<liu:1ril~", for records of transits a space of 9 millimeters(~ of an inch) represents one second of time, and during exchanges of signals, a double speed is given t;o the c;rlindcr, making 18 millimeters to one :-;econ<l. These chronographs use but one, pen; tlle marking fluid is the carmi11e ink manufactured by Thad. Davids & Co. of New York. This im;trument is illustrated on the secornl plate. Tlw chronograph sheet is read off to hundredths of a second.

The telescope is then uirectPd to that si1le of the .zenith wliere the first star will culminate and tl1e hnbhle of the ltwe] iH made to pla_y Yery nearly in the middle. As soon as t11e star enters the fiPld an<l when transiting on one of the vertical wires, or at any convenient number of seconds hefore the culmination, th(· ob,.;ernr will piek up the heat of the ehronometer and bisect t11e star with the micrometer thread aml kePping it 1ih·;ecte<l up to the instant of culmination; the lt>Yel and micrometer are thc11 read, the instrument i1' re\·olved 180° and the second star is ohse1-ved in the same manner. During· these obiwnations, the tangent screw of the vertical circle must not be toucbed, though the tangent screw whicu gives a slow motion to the telescope (and consequently also to the level) may be used after the re\'ersal of the instrument in the exceptional case when the yertical axis of the instrument is 11ot well adjusted. (7.) If for some reasons the meridian obserYation fails, the star may be bisected off the meridian and the time noted. This may be done in twq w·ays, cit.her by mo\'iug the telescope in azimuth and bisecting in the line of collimation, or by obsen·ing the star off the middle of the field, lea,ing the tele1icope undistnrbe1l in the plan~ of the meridiau. The latter method is generally the preferable one, particularly when the star culminates near the zenith. If, bowC\'er, the tueridionnl distance of the star be considerable, the first method had better be followed.

Though the star may be bisecte(l several times while passing throug-h the fh>ltl, in our Pxprrience little is gaiued in multipl.Ying obsen-ations upon the same star nudrr the Sflmc l'irc11msta11ce.~. The relative accuracy of a Ringle obsernttion, and of tlie position of a Rtar assig-11ed hy t!H· <·:1t:1lognes, points to the multiplication of stars rather than to that of repeated pointing;; on the s;rn1c star. It is not advisable to combine more than one north star with more than one south star, for thP rna;mn that greater accurac;v is gained by observing pairs on different nights and in case of an imperfection in the position assigned to any of tlte stars thus combined it wonl<l h(difficnlt to detect the faulty one. It is i>reforable, therefore, to break up combinations into pairs. \\' e han, however, m~n.r cases where ,me star enters as a component of a pair with different stars. Each pair is generally observed on five ors.ix nights; a greater uumhe1· of ohserrntioni:; wonM add hut very little to the \'alue of the mean result, as will be seen in the <liscm;sion of the relatirn weights. (d.) Genel'al expression {01· the latitude.-Let ~ and ~'equal the trne meridional zeuith distance of the i;outhcrn and northern star and o and o' the declination of the sanw, respecti,-ely; then the expression for the latitude is
<p=Ho+o')+~(~-;')

Now, if z, z' denote the observed zenith distance of the south and tl1e north star; n, s the north and the south readiug of the le>el for the south star and n', s' the same for the. north star; b the value of one division of level; 1- aml r' the refraction correction and in and 111 1 the retludiou to the meridian for the south and the north star, respectin~I,r, then

~(z-z')=1(:l'II-l\I')R

If the micrometer reads t-0tr:ard the zenith (the direction appears, of course, iifferte<l in the astronomical telescope), change 1I-l\I,.into JW-1\f antl it may he remarked here that during half of the obserrntious at the station the instrument may be used in the reversed position of the telcoicope with regard to the vertical axis, thus varying the circumstances under which measures are taken. (!l_) Determination of the valur of a dhii.~ion of the micromcter.-Differcnt methods have been u:-;ed for this purpose; the one formerly most, frequently employed vrns by turning tlie rnicl'ometer at right angles to the position in which it is used for makiug latitude ohserrntious and noting the times of the passage of a close circumpolar star near culmination over tlie micrometer thread placed successively before the star for each turn or half-turn of the screw; now, let r=iute1Tal (connfft.ed into seconds of arc) from culmination, and o=the star's declination, tlwu the sine of the angular distance from the meridian= Hin r cos o and the differences of quantitie:-; thus computed, divide(l by the corresponding differences in the screw-readings, give tlw Yalue of oue <lh-ision. The treatment of a set of observations by application of the method of least isqnan·s is ginm by J.E. Hilgard, assistant in the United States Coast Survey, in Gould's Astrononiic,ll Journal, So. 3<i (Cambridge, March 13, 1852). Another method, formerl,y employed, was to measure the angular space covered by a well-defined distant terrestrial object by !lleans of a suitable theodolite and also by means of the micrometer-screw, from whielJ. tue value of the latter will readily result. The method, however, introduced in 184;' by C. 0. Boutelle, assistant. in the United States Coast SmTe,r, aml uow almost exclusively used, consists of observing a close circumpolar star 11e<1r its elongation when rapidly rising or falling, accompanied with but a slight motion in azimntl1; thi;i method avoids the risk of a disturbance in the focal adjustments; it requires the reading of the le\'cl in order to allow for possible changes, and necessitates a correction for differential l'efr:wt.iollBy cos t.,=cot o tan <p and cos r0 =cosec o sin <p we find tLe star';i honr :rngle t0 and zenith distance (. at elongation; and if a= star's right ascension and .dT=chrouomcter correction, then ~ Chronometer time of elongation =a - JT :I: t,, where + _ } for f western eai,;teru f elongation.

After tliese two correction.".! lawe been ll!Jplied to tlie obsen·ed time8 of noting, we haYe in one column the readings of tht· micrometer aud in another the corresponding times, such as would have hPl'll observed if the star had moYed uniforml;y in a Ycrtical line, leaYing out of consideration, for the present, the change in refraction. Various methods of combination might be adopted for the determination of the turn of the screw; that followed in the example, where we subtract the values rt'i:inltingfrom the first ol>8errntion from those of the middle one, next those of the second from those of the middle one plmi <ine, mid 1,;o 011, recommends itself for its simplicity and is probably ouly il1t't-rior to that which employs 1he metliod of least squares. '\Ve thus obtaiu a number of valneis for tbe time of a giYcn mnnhu of turns, half, or quart\'r-tnrns, from which we deduce the value of 011e turn by the formula g-iYeu above; the correction for refraction (in seconds of arc) is negath"e for cit her eastern or west er11 elo11gatio11 and equals the change of refraction for the space equal to one tm·n=value of one turu times dil!erenee of refraction for 1' at star's altitude diYided by 60. The probable error of the resulting Yalne of one turn is readil,r found; see example appended to this papn. If we wish to proct'<>d witJ1 the ut,most rigor, the rnethotl of least squares should he ap11lied, a development of which is gi\'ell in Chanv('net's article on the zenith telescope, aboYe cited, page 363. It is sufficiently explained hy the following statement and the example. Let Mu= the unknown

(10.) Determination of tile i1al11e uf one dil"ision <~/'the lael.-The yalue of one division of the level may be found in different ways, according to tlic meanR available. Tim temperature shou11l Le noted, since the result may clrnugc with a change of temperature. The value may he fonrn1 rlirectly with a level-trier or by attaching tlw IM·el to a well-divided Yertical circle and measuring directly the angular ,-aJne passed ornr·by a chauge of iuclination of a gi,·en number of cliYisions in tlte position of the lmbhle; a distant object may be siµ:hted a:-; a mark or, lictter,.a second instrument ma;,- be used as ~1 collimator and in comwclion with it; the augular space is measured with tile micrometer screw, the value of which is alrca<ly kumn1. To employ a ,-;tar for a mark renders tl1e determination unnecessarily complex. I.n tlte example :1p11endetl, tlle \·alne of a di,·i:sion of lcYel is found in terms of the micrometer screw, the bnl1ble is ma<fo to tran'rst~ the wl1ok length of graduation an cl the micrometer differences co1Tespondiug to the displa!'.etnents of the lmhulc uy a change of inclination are measured b~- pointing on a collimator; such ousen·ations, in particular, sltould iuclrnlc those di-visions of the leYel which come most commouly into use during the observations for latitude. (11.) Correction for d{fferential refraction.-The difference of refraction for any pair of stars is so small that we can ueglect the variation iu the state of the atmosphere at the time of the ohserrntion from that mean state Ru1iposed in the refraction tables. The refraction lming nearly proportional to the tangent of the zenith distance, tile differe11ce of' refraction for the two stars will be given by r-r' = 57".7 siu (z- z') sec 2 z
1\Io

= M1 + µ

and since the difference of zenith distance11 is measured by the micrometer, the following fable of correction to the latitude for differential refraction has been pre1mred for tlie argument t difference of zenith distance 01· ~ difference of micronwtl'r rea<ling at. thp, side and the argument ·'Zenith
"In case no special ohscn·ations for value of micrometer lrnYP hN'll nrnd<', we may st.ill fintl it from th1· latit1ul" observations themselves.

which gives the normal equations for finding dR and d<p

U.EPORT OF THE

~UPEHINTENDENT

OF THE

For the mefm places of stars to be used in the computation the computer consults all catalogues of precision and in addition to those already mentioned in§ (.'>)the following: United States Northern Boundary Commission; Declination of Fixed Stars, by Assistant Lewis Boss, director of Dm1lPy Ol>servatOQ"; 1877. Heale Accademia dei Lincei; Catalogo delle Declinazioni medie pel 1875; Homa, 1880. Catalogue of 618 stars observed at the astronomical observatory of Harvard College; Cam bridge, 1880. Catalogue of 1098 sta11dard clock and zodiacal stars; Simon Newcomb, i~rof. U. S. N., Supt. Amer. Ephem. (pnhlishe<l in 1881) and other catalogues. The ·alues of a star's declination from all catalogues arnilable are tabulated and the most probable value is selected according to the weigltt to be attached to each result. The question of the effect of proper motion enters conspicuously into the judgment for assigning relative weights. (l.'i.) Discus.~ion of the results.-The weights of the result8 by each pair differ with the number of observations upon each pair, with the numbt'r of times a star enters into any such combinations and with the accuracy of the star11:1 po;;ition as found from the catalogues. To fiml the WEigllt due to tlie number of obserYations or the probable error of obseryation, let n =number of ob8ervations upon a pair, p =number of pairs, L1 =difference of latitude between each obserrnd re8ult and tbe mean result deduced for the respective Jlair (see example to Art. 14), [L1 2J =sum of all the L12's for an;y one pair and 21.::PJ the sum-total from all the pairs; then, if e = probable error of obscrn1tiou,

n-p On the a Ycr,1ge, the Yalue of e from many determinations is rather less than ± 0" .4 :uul oceasiona lly reaches ± 0".3 and even less; the corrm;pomli11g probable error of an observed zenith distance equals e v!J or ± Ql'.3G To find the probable error eq, of a resulting lat~tndP hy auy oue pair aud the probable error e8 of the mean of two decliuations or of ~(o+o'), ore., , we must consider separately the errors of

and the ·alue of t1- is found by

E2= p~1[;]
The ,-alue of e6 being thus known, the probable error of a single declination becomes E0 =c8 ..FJ and our weights will be found to differ for difforeut catalogues. If but one catalogue is used, its declinations may be considered as affected with the same probable error, provided the authorities and number of observations from which the declinations were derirnd are the same; but if different eatalogues are emplo:ved, the probable error and weight of any declination may be taken as fonrnl for the same authority by our previous experience. The aYerage probable e.rror of an;y si11glc declination from the older catalogues ruay be taken as less than ± 011 .5, but with the catalogues at present ayailable (1&~1) if may be a8 low as ±0 11 .4 (lG.) Gombillation of tlte results by weights.-If <a and <s1=probable errors of the declinations of tbc stars of a puir', and n the number of observations on the pair, then

It sometimes happens that, instead of the ordinary combination, one or more south stars are combined with one or more north stars. In this case the mean of tlw decliuations of the south stars may be combined wita the mean of the declinations of the north stars, the corresponding mean of tlie micrometer and lerel readings being also used; or else we may combine each south star, for instance, with each of the north stars and tlie mean of these separate results of the latter metho(l must equal the result by the entire combination. In general, the formation of sb1,rs into pairs is preferable, as defects of observation or of catalogue-place are more rea,ct'ily detected. Snpposc the ~imple cases of one star entering into combiuation with two others, forming doublets or entering into com biuation with three others,form:il1g triplets, etc., and supposing the weig·ht of an ordinary pair =1 and disregardfog tlie observing error, the weight of each doublet will he~. and of each triplet= ~'etc., according to the form - 2 , and our former weights w must fh'st be multiplied hv this fracc+l · tion before using them in the combination for cpo.

The metlwd of obsen·ing seyeral north with several south stars is not· now practiced, as observation b,y pairs is far preferable and doublets or triplets generallr enter now only in such cases where a south (or north) star is combined with a certain north (or south) star, say for a number of nights, but with another north (or south) star on some following nights aml perhaps with still another star at a later period.

DETERMINATION OF THE "\STROROMTCAij AZI.'.\IUTH OF A DIHECTIOR.
(With four plates.)

(1.) Gencrril remarks.-The metl1ods employed iu tl1e Coast aml Geodetic Sm'V('Y for 4letermiuing; astronomicallr, the azimuth of a triangnla.tion-line or wfait is tlw same thing, the direcfom of a lirw witl1 res1wct to the meridian of the place, arc Yer~- ,-arionl' and tl1ere an·, perltapll, uo other gemletic operations iu which tile choice of tlie method, the perfi.~ction of tlw iustrumeut and the skill of the ohiwrw~r entel' so directl;v into thf' Yalue of the result. It is iutcudcd to ~.d,-e lwre i11 a. concise form an account of tlie S(Weral mPtllocls in m~e, to present the formulm as well as specimens of record and cxample8 of cornpntatiou. If it is IffOJlOSPil to measure a priuiar.r or subordi. nafo aximnth, the observer will generally haYe the choice of the mdhod most suitabli:\ aml ade11nate for the purpose and accordingly proYide ltimself with the proper instruuwut, yet 11ot uufrequentl,Y he may tlnd ltinuwlf already proYidell with an instrument, in wl1icL case that method will have to be selected which is com11atible with the mechanical means on liaml and at the same time i1rnures the greatest accuracy. The astronomical azimuth 01· the angh· which the plane of the meridian make:'< with tlie Yer· tical plane passing through the o~jcct' whose direction is to be tletermined, is generallr reckoned f'mm the south and in the direction southwest, ete.; however, when circumpolar stars are observed, it will he found more com·euieut to reckon from tl1e north meridian and eastward-that i;;, in tlw same direction as before. The geodetic azimuth differs from the astronomical azimuth. The former is suppmsed free from local detlections of the plnmh-litw or vertical, it, being the mean of 8eYeral astronomical azimntltR, all referred geo<letically to one station and it may be supposed tbat in this normal aximntl1 tlw seyeral local deflections will Jrn,-e neutralized eaell ntlier. The astronomical azimnth is, of eourst.., suhject to an,y displacement of the zenith due to local attraction or deflection. '\\re may distinguisl1 between primary and secondary azimuths-the one fixing tbe direction of a side in the primary triangulation, the other having reference to sides of secondary or tertiary triangulations or to tlirections in connection with the measure of the magnetic declination. Por foe determination of a primary azimuth the local time (sidereal) must either be known 1 as for instance, when a telegraphic longitude was at the same time determined or special obserYations must he made for it. }'or Sllbordinate azimtltlis time and azimuth obsenations may sometimes be made together1 as with the alt-azimuth instrnment for magnetic i1urposes, in which case tl1e sun's limbs are usually observed. In refined work }tnd for certain methods we need the transit instrument to furnish the chronometer correction; in other cases or for second-class azimuthll, lof,al time may be found by means of vertical circles, sextants or alt-azimuth instruments.* . (2.) Instruments.-First-ciass azimuths are generall,y observed with an astronomical tlwodvliteof' the best workmanship and of the largest portable size. In tlte practice of tlw Coast a nil Geodetic Survey theodolites having circles of 76 and of 5ocm diameter (or of 30 and 20 inches respectively), also repeating circles of 46<m (or 18 inches), and others of smaller size, arc employed, and in ca,ses where no greater accuracy than a quarter of a minute is needed, as in magnetic work, even a lOcm
*That very bandy little instrument known as the chronodeik (S. C. Chandler in Science ObHerver, Vol. III, No. 3 : Boston, Sept. 1880) may be of service in azimuth work as woll as in latitude work with zenith telescope. In principle it is an equal altitude instrument. With it the nearest whole second may be secured.

(or 4 inch) tlieodolite or alt-azimuth instrument will answer the purpose. The first plate appended to tlJis part exhil>it.~ the largest and oldest theodolite much used on tlle survey during the period from 1844 to 18i3; the second plate shows one of the later· tlleodolite8 of the largest size now considered desirable and of the best pattern; it has been frequent]~- in use since 1874. The aperture of these telescopes is 7:le"' (nearl.r 3 inches), their foc;tl length about 10-!< 1" (or 41 inches) aml tliey hehr a ll1agnifyi11g power of A :30cni (or 1'..3-inch) astronomical theodolite is illnstrnte1l Oll the third plate. These instruments carry either 2 or 3 micrometer rnicro11cope:-.; their aperture is between 6 and i ~""' (or :2~ arnl :J inches). wit}! a focal distance of U1 au<l il cm (or 24 and 28 ind1es) and they carr,v a rnag-ui(riJJg" JHnver of 50 (or more). The telescope can be tnrned throug-h tlw Yertical without taking itR axis off the V's. In this as well as in the preceding instrument t11e horizontal or azimuth circles a.re fnll platcl'i ( i. c.: they ha Ye no spokes), supported b~- rihR nmlpmeath and they mas he free.ly placed in nny position with regard to the zero of the gradnatiou. Their circles are free from any clamping and l'>low-rnotion screw, in fact they are only to be looked at through the reading 14icroscopel'I, hut may be Ret to a11y position and then tightened. These irn.;trurll(·nts may carry a vertical cirnle 01· a fi1111er. The last plat (fourth) exhibits the small alt-azimuth, so nReful i11 a rnriety of ways.

This plafo shows also a conn~nie11t form of an a1.i11mth mark aml a simple lldiotrope. Tmusit instrmueiits and meridian teleRcopcs art' llkfd lcRs frt·11nently for azimuth. Transits are mounted either in the plane of the meridian or iu the verti1·al plane of a circumpolar star when at or near elongation.

For the purpose of reference to the triangulation a11 azi111ntl1 mark is <>Stahlis!Wcl as nettr l1fl may be in the Same horizontal level aR the observing station, hnt if elevated aborn or depressed below the horizon tlie angular amount must he measured. The tliRtance of the mark ii-; generally determined by the configuration of the ground snrronnding the station, hut on no ar·emmt should it he placed any nearer than about 1~km or say a igtatute mile, in order that the siden:al focm; of the telescope may not mquirf\ changing wlte11 poiutin~ from tlw uiark to tlw i:;tm 01· rite Nna, si11ee any such change i.s likely to disturb the li1w of collimation.

The azimuth mark is usually a square hox about 30C"' cube (about~ cubic foot), ha,·ing in its front face a round hole or a,pertnre of suitable and adjustable size, through which the light of a bull's-eye lantern can be shown at 11ig·l1t and can he made to appear of about the apparent brilliancy and size of the star obser,·ed upon for azimuth. .For day observations a narrow v.erticaJ black 8tripe is painter} ou the white wand centrally llf\low the aperture and above it two black stri1>es on both si<leR of it.

Collimators in the place of marks are rarely used, but wltcr0 no suitable plurc for a mark can be found, as, for instance, on some of the isolated peaks of the Siena Ne\·ad:t in California, thp~· cannot well be dispensed witll. Their aperture should lie as large as .that of the collimati11g tt'lescope and the greatest precaution should bf' used to gin~ tltelll the firmest gronnd con11Pdior1 :iml shelter them from cllanges of temperature. J\farks or collimators slionhl be counecte1l with poiuh of tile triangulations by horizontal angles. Rciipectiug reflex oh~wrnttions the reader 111ay lw referred to tL.e end of Part I, art. 2. A glass roof oYer tlie mercur,y sL.onlc1 IJe\'er he ernployl'll. since reversal of it does not sufficiently correct for error by refraction. (:.!.) General considei-ations.-Let tlie time (t), declination ( o), and latitudp (qiJ lu· slightly iu e1Tor by the quantities dt, do and drp aml let dA equal their effect upon the azimuth (A); then, i11 f!"PllPral, it will be seen that, all other circumstances being-equal, dA increaseii as the zenith distauce (~)de· creases; for a star near the pole and for a latitude not too high a small error iu time and in latitu1lc has but a slight effect upon the azimuth, aml in the ease of a circumpolar star at the elongation (when the parallactic angle is 900) a small error in time, dt, will not affect the azimuth; but small errors in declination, do and in latitude, d<p, then attain nea.rl,r their maximum effect upon the azimuth. If observations are m;ule upon n circnmpular star (o>rp) at the eastern and at the welitern elon&ration, effects of do and dcp will disappear in the combination of the two results; this, therefore, is the most favoraule condition for observing. lu general, efieets of drS aml drp disappear in mean results of observations of equal and opposite azimuths. In obser\·ations of a circumpolar star in the meridian, the effect of a small error in time and in right asl.'emiiou may be eliminated by a emubination of results from upper and lower cnlminationi;;; for a Rti:tr in the mcri1lian the quantities d() and drp do not enter in the azimuth. If the object to be ohsmTed, star (or sun). ioi of great polar distance (also a< q;), and if a is positi,-e, tlte be1'1t time for obserdug is hefon· tlw eastern trm1sit, or, after the western transit over the prime vertical, when the change ii! azimuth with respect to time is a maximum; but the altitude of the star (or sun) should not approach too 1war tlle zP11itlt nor he so low as to be affected by changes of refractfon; if o is negative, the star (or s1111) Rlrnnld be observed some distance from the merillian. The circumpolar stars a, o, A Ursre Minoris and. 51 Oe.phei are those almost cxdnsiwl>- used; their position is most accurately given in the second edition of Dr. Gould's StalHlar1l l'lacPs of Fundamental Stars (Washingt-011, 1866), specially preparell for the use of the Saf\"(',Y, and still adhered to; the apparent places may be taken from the American Ephemeris.

proposed and used for azimuth \rnrk h.r Assistant G. Davidson. The apparent precessional motion of the pole in 100 years is indicated by the direction and length of the arrow. The sun is employed only to determine azimuths of inferior accuracy, generally in connection with the determination of the mag-netic declination. For a satisfactor~- dekrmination of the azimuth from a high star, it is essential that the horizontal axis of the instrument be long aml its inclination be accurately measurable by a delicate level; a dl'forrninatiuu of the iucqnalit.r of the pivots is essential. This inclim1tion of the trnnsitaxis slwul<l be measured in the position when the telescope is })Oiuted to the star and again w!Jen pointed to the mark, unless the latter be in the horizon; the best results, however, are obtained by ob;.;erviug the star direct and also its image reflected from the surface of still mercury ; the mean result is free from the effect of any incliuatinn of the transit axis. The collimation error is eliminated from the mean msult by combining ohserrntious with telescope direct and with telescope reversed, the horizontal axis ha\-i11g· been turned 180° in azimuth and the telescope again pointed to the star (during this process tbe pivots of the transit axis remain otherwise undisturbed in their Y's). If the Y's are too sliort to permit the telescope to be turned through the vertical, it may lie carefully lifted out, swung through twice the zenith or nadir distance, aud let down again, the pirnts resting on the ,9ame Y's as before; tlte. azimuth circle is then turned through 1soo. The collimation ma,r he a(ljnstetl in the first place by reversal of the axis in the Y's as in the transit instrument. J<}rrors of graduation are sought to be eliminated by observing in different positious of the mstrument, the circle being shifted after each set of observations an equal amount of augular space, depending upun tbe number of positions intended to cover 8G0°, anll upou the nmuber of equidistant micl'oscopes or verniers, so that no one shall occupy a position previously occu11ied b~· another. \Vith the large theodolites, supplied witli three reading microscopes, the m1mhur of positions adoptc1l may he one of the 8maller prime numbers 7, 11, 13, 17, rn, 23 and for less perfect graduation one of the larger numbers should be taken. ObserYations for azimuth are gem1rally made in sets, commencing, after the instrument is leveled, with a number of readings on the mark (about six for primary and from t1tree tu oue for secondary azimuths), followed by about an equal number of readings on the star, also preceded and

A- sin p sec ( cp±p) sin t

= b B and the azimuth of the

star

} for { ;~~~:I~ culmination.

}

(11.) Azimuths for tertiary triangulation, or azimuths in connection with the magnetic declination, where an accuracy of a fraction of a minute suffices, may coll'veniently be obtained from observations of the sun with a small altazimuth instrument (say of five or even three inches diameter). Sup. posing the latitude given, but the time onl.v approximately known, the sun's zenith distance and azimuth may be observed. as follows: reading of mark, three readings, noting the chronometer time at contacts of the sun's upper aml first limb; instrument reversed, three readings of the sun's lower and second limb, reading of mark. J,et h =altitude, corrected for refraction, parallax (semi-diameter an1l dip, if necessary) and P= the sun's or star's polar dh;tance, then counting the azimuth A from the 1wrtli · tan· in which expressions= M<p + h + p).
(s-cp) sin (s-lt) zA = sin --cos-8-cos(s:.::..p) . .

If the time should also be desired, it may be computed by

cosssin(s-h) 2 tan ~t=,;Iii (s..:..:cp) cos (8'...:.p)

To connect the direction of a side of the triangulation with that of the meriomn, the theodolite employed for the measure of the horizontal angle subtended between the mark and signal must be exactly centered over the intersection of the vertical planes passing through the optical and the horizontal axes of the transit. This may be effected in several ways, to suit the peculiari-

8EPTE1IRER 15, 1875. In accordance with your direction it is proposed to present here those supposed considerations which appear to have led to the adoption, in the Sul'Vey, of the polycnnic projection in preference to other pr~je.ctions more or less adapted to the same purpm;e. To d-0 this satisfactorily it will be desirable to review briefly the various leading projections in use and to advert to their principal properties and practical advantages or com·enience8. It will be noticed that thi8 ground has already been gone over by the late Maj. E. B. IInnt, United States Engineers and Assistant Coast Survey, who gaYe an exposition of the 8nhject in Appendix No. 39, Coast Survey Report for 1853; but the length of time elapsed and the cm1Ref]ne11t. increasing difficulty of ready reference to this article renders it desirable to restate the Rn hject, at. the i;ame time taking a<lYantag-e of the opportunity of intnHlncing additional remarks aml athert· ing briefly to a historical notice of the pol;\·conic projediou. I have also thought it desirable to change the classification. The principal artifices a!loptccl hy geographers and uavigators of representing on plane maps and charts the whole or portions of the surface of the gfolie or of the spheroid han~ been so often described as to requirf, in this placf, no further detailed uotice heyoud tlw few references giYen below,* where the reader may find fuller descriptious, amplifications and theoretical expositionsi oth1w references will be given further on. The object of maps aml charts is to exhibit to the eye, by Rnitable representation, on a reduced scale aml on a plane surface, with all i!OSsible accuracy, the relatil·e position of points, lines, or o~jects on the earth's surface and, since such positions art~ usually defi'ned by spherical co·ordinatt·H, the primary object of the so.called projections is the delineation of these circles of reference accord· ing to certain assumed or fixed geometrical laws. Any point, line, or o~ject intended for represen· tation may then be laid down hy means of its known CO·ordiuates and, conYcrsely, tlte co·ordiuatc.~ of any plotted point may be aBcertained. Owi11g to the geometrical impossibility of dm'eloping a spherical or 8pheroidal surface in a plane, it follows that such prnjections may be as Yaried in 1heir furulamental principleR aH tlwre are distinct purposes for which representation may lw 11eeded.

Especiall;v in an east and west direction dishtnceK and area.'\ become grossl;r exaggerated, though for an elementar!/ l'illrface the true proportion or a figure ii' vn·isen·ed. lt is occasionally used for representing small surfaces near the equator. 'The rectaugnliir projection, a less detective delineation than the square prQjectiun, consists in presenting the length of dt-grees of longitude along tl1e rnfr1'lfo parallel of tlte chart iu tlwir true relation tu the corresponding degrees on the sphere; they will, therefore, appear ;;maller than tlw lengtl! of the degrees of latitude iu the proportion 1: cos rp. lu an ea.st and west direction the chart is unduly exp,amled a!Jove and unduly contracted below the midulc parallel. The rectangular equal-sw:face projection differ1S from the first in tliis, tlmt tlte distances of tlw parallels, instead of being equal, are now drawn parallel to the equator at distances proportional to the sine of the latitude. This gives it the <listiuctive property of the areas of rectangle1S·or zoues ou the pr(\jection, being proportional to the areas of correspouding figures ou the sphere. The distortion, however, becomes quite excessive in the higher latitudes. Gaxsini'x Jlr<?jcction.-Tl!is pr(\jectiou makes no use of the parallels of latitude, but substitutes for them a second syst.em of co-ordinates, namel.r, one at right angles to the priucipal or central meridian. It is couseqnently convenient in connection with rectangular spherical co-<;mlinates hay· ing their origin in the middle of the chart. The projection of Uassini's chart of France consisted of squares," aud hatl ueitlter mf1ridians (excepting oue) nor parallels. It would seem, howeYer, that in t!Jis simple form it is not the prqjcct10n generally distinguished by this name. It has been described as follows: t Suppose a cylindrical surface with its geuerating line at right angles to the central meridian and enveloping the sphere along this meridian. ThiR cylindric surface is supposed inter<1ected by Jllane<1 pa.rallcl to that of the central meridian and these intersections 1wocluce on the cliart, after development of the cylinder, the straigllt rcpresentati,·es of meridians, but are in reality small circles on the sphere. '.l'heir distance from each other is defined by passing them through equal dhisions of the prime vertical dmwn through the center of the cl!art. The central meridian having heen equally divided, the equidistant straight lines passing through these diYisions form tlio prime vertical system. This .projection is not now employed, as it offers no facilitit>s for 11lotti11g pm1itio11s hy latitude and longitude; moreov·er, the clistortion rapidly increases witlt distance from the center meridian of the chart. Projection with coiwerging meridians.-This is a modification of tlie square projection designed to conform nearly to the condition that arns of longitude shall appear p1:01wrtional to the cosines of their respective latitudes. The straight line representing the central meridian being properly graduated-that is, the true lengtli, by scale, of an arc of a d1·gree of latitude (or of a minute or a multiple thereof, as the case may be) liaving been laid off according to the scale adopted-two straight lines are drawu at right a11glc1S to tlie meridian to represent parallels, one near the bottom and the other near the top of the chart. The8e parallel,,; are next graduated, thr arcs representing degrees (multiples or subdidsimrn) of longitude on eacli having, by scale, the true length belonging to the latitmle. The corresponding points of equal nominal angular distance from the middle meridian thus marked on the parallels, when connected hy straight lines will produce the system of co11Yergent meridians. The disadrnntages of this projection are the fact<1 that but two of the parallels exliibit the length of arcs of longitude in their true proportion and that tlie central meridian alone is at right angles to the parallels. This projection is suitable for the repretieutation of tolerably large areas, the aboYe defects not being of a serious nature within ordinary limits. It also recommends itself by the ease with which points can be projected or taken off tlie chart by reference to latitude and longitude. Projection by dei,elopment of an intersecting cyU1idcr.-The cylinder with its axis perpewlicular to the plane of the equator is supposed to intersect the middle parallel of the chart. On the c,rlindric surface the arcs of the meridian and of the middle parallel are duly represented in their proper length and the parallels and meridians are straight lines int,ersecting each other at right angles. Charts of this construction answer best low latitudes. The projection is the same as the "rectaugnlar," though it may be changed by putting the sine,~ for the arcs of the degrees on the meridian. Its use was superseded hy the following one.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

1lfercator's projection is generally employed for the purposes of navigation. The axis of a cylinrler tangent at the equator i1' coincident with the axis of the sphere; and in developing the cylinder the projected meridians become parallel and equidistant Rtraigltt lines. These arP intersected at right angles hy straight lines representing parallels so dmwn tlrnt at e\-ery point of the chart the ratio oftl1e degree (or rather of an infinitely small part of it) of longitude to the degree of latitude (or infinitely small part of it) is preserved the same as on the correr;ponding point of the sphere. G-reat circles on the sphere will not generally appear on the diweloped cylinder as straight lines, but any straight !inn 011 thP chart represents a rhum h line and indicates a particular mutual hearing of t";o pla<"es so connected. On the sphere sud1 a line is known as a loxodromic curve arnl it posResses the property of cutting the meridians at equal angleR. The proportionality of the parts of infinitely small figures on the sphere and on the projection is preserved. In the higlier latitudes, in consequence of enormous exaggeration, the projection loses its value. Its want of uniformity of scale ot distances is its great defoet arnl renders it useless for any other than the special nautical purpose· for -which it was deo.igned. The following projections present hnt one flystem of' straight lines: Flamsteed's prf?je.etion.-The parallels of latitude on the sphere are here represented hy straight lines. Perpendicular to these is the central meridian divided into degrees (multiples or imrts of degrees) of latitude. The paralIPls pasAing through these points are divided, each in like manner as_ the corresponding parallels on the sphere; through these latter points curves are drawn, which represent the meridians. Its prinClipal defect is the obliquity of intersection of the project.e,d parallels and meridians, especiaHy in the higher latitudes and at some distance from the central meridian. It preserves, however, the proportionality of areas of zones in the prQjection and on the sphere. It is moM effectively Pmployed in ma])piug equatorial countries. I>e Lorgna's projection.t-It prescITes the proportionality of corresponding surfaces on the sphere aml projection. It is mostly used as a polar prQjection, in which case the parallels of latitude ap11ear as concentric circles ancl the meridians a& straigl1t lines dividing the circumferences of the circles equally. The radius of the projection for any spherical segment is a mean proportional between the diameter of the sphere and the height of the spherical segment.t If the projectfon be made not on the plane of the equator, but on that of the horizon of any place on the spliere, azimuths and altitudes will take the place of the former system of longitudes and latitudes. Babinet's eqMl surfa-ee or homalograpkie projection.-The distinctive character of this important projection§ is, as its name implies, a proportionality of areas on the sphere with the corresponding areas of the projection. The equator is deYeloped iuto a straight line and graduated equally from 0° to 180° either way from the central meridian, which is perpendicular to it, and of half the length of the representative line of thl' equator. The parallels of latitude are all Rtraight lines, on each of which the degrees of longitude a"re equal, but do not bear their true proportion iu length to those on the sphere. Their distance from the equator is determined by the law of' equal surfaces)) and
* It may he remarked Umt eveu as a sailing chart the coun;e iudicate.i by a straight liue betweeu two gi veu poi uts is not generally t11e one the navigator ougbt to follow, since it j.g neither the shortest line nor a groat circlo (the two being practically identical in length). Fur track-charts it seems de~irable to have constructed a series of ch/;\rts on the f1no11unric projection, which presents all great circles as straight lines. Taking from these the latitudes and longitudes of a nmnlJer of points, theRe great arcs may be transferred to any other projootfon from which bearings or distances may be obtainable. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that in practice it is not so much the shortest course which is desired, hut that along wl1ich tbe sh<>rtest passage can be made, thus making the minimum duration the criterion. Tho problem of finding the most advantageous course becomes complicated, since it must take into account the effect of set and ·lrift of currents and of direction and strength of wind most probably to be expected at the time and place. The resolution of it, however, must set out wit.h the great circle or a number of great circles drawn from one objective point to the next. On the chart of Northwestern America, showing the territory ceded by Russia to the United States and published in May, 1867, by the Coast Survey, Prof. Benjamin Puirce, Superintendent, thertl is a sub-sketch on the gnomonic proj11ction, showing the great circle hetweon San Francisco aud Ha.koda.di. We refer to this chart simply to show t.bat the value of this }>rojection, especially for steam navigation, is duly recognized. t l'rincipi di Geogra.fia; Verona, 1789.

the numbers have been talmlated between the limits 0 at the equator to l for tlte pole. Tim meridian of 900 on each side of the centml meridian appears in the projection as a cirde arnl by intersection detennines the length of degrees on the paritllels; all other meridians are part,; of elliptical arcs. Extending the projection to embrace the whole surface of a sphere, the bom1cli11g liue of the projection Lecomes an dlipse, the area of the circle iucluded by the meritl}~tns of 90'.) equal" that of the hemisphere and the crescent-shaped areas l~ing out1;ide of this circle between ::!:: loug·itudes 900 and 1soo are together equal to that of the circle; also the area of the projection b'etween the parallels of ::!:: 30° is equal to the same. The degrees of latitude near the equator appear exaggemted and infinitely small surfaces on the sphere and projection are dissimilar in form, yet the distortion is not excessi\'e. Its chief use is fm graphical illustrations relating to area, such as the (listribution and den1;ity of population or the extent of forests, area covered uy coal-measures and the like. I>e l'lsle's oonie projeetion.-lf we imagine a conical surface with its apex in the axis (produced) of the sphere and tangent to its surface along a parallel, that parallel by development of the conical surface will become an arc of a circle having for its radius the slant side of the cone, which is equal to the cotanp;eut of the latitude. A IHUt of thii; developed arc of a circle, sufficient in length to include tlrn desired number of degrees of longitude, is conceived drawn through the middle point of the straight central meridian and parallel therewith, or from the same center other arcs are stn10k, passing through the points marking the degrees of la1itnde on the central meridian. To denne the meridians two of the parallels, one near the bottom the other near the top of the chart (generally at one-fourth and at three-fourths the height of the chart), are graduated-that is, the true length (by scale) of a degree of longitude is repeatedly laid off on each and through the cor· responding vair of points straight lines are drawn which represent the meridians. They interRect at different points and do not reter to the center from which the parallels were Rtruck. The central meridian and two paraliels only present their reRpeetiYe arcs of a length proportional to the corre11ponding arcs on the Rphere. The i;implc conic p1"</jcction.-It differs from the above in this, that tbe developed arc of the middle latitude (of a chart) a.lone is emplo;yed in the place of the. two extreme arcs for the graduation of longitudes. .All meridians are straight lines and intersect at the center from which the concentric parallels were swept. On the central meridian and on tile middle iiarallel the degrees of latitude and of longitude, respectively, are laid off according to scale and proportional to those -on the sphere. Parallels and meridians intersect at right angles and infinitely small parts on the sphere and projection are similar in figure. The length of degrees on all the parallels, excepting the middle one, is but slightl.r difterent from what it would be if they were of their true length proportional to those on the sphe1·e. This very valuabfo pr<:\jection was specially investigated by L. Euler (Petersb. Comment., 1777). It may be remarked that when the planes of the parallels are supposed produced to intersect the cone, the resulting divisions on the meridian would become unequal. This source of defect is avoided by developing the meridional arc on the side of the cone, as stated above. Mwrdocli's projection"' was designed to improve a defect of the conic projection with respect to area and to render tile same more nearly proportional to that corresponding to it on the sphere. He supposed an int.ersecting cone to 11ass through points of the central meridian somewhere between the middle latitude and the extreme parallels of the chart, its side remaining parallel to the tangent at the middle latitude, while the points where the cone intersects the meridian are so selected as to make the whole included conic surface exactly equal to the spherical surface which it represents. Otherwise the construction is similar to that of the first nametl conic prqjection. It also follows by principle that the degrees of longitu1le on the two parallels passiug through the intersecting points appear of their true length. For the parallels between these the distances and areas are all too small; and for the parallels outside of these the distances and areas are too great when compared with the corresponding parts on the sphere. The meridians are straight lines perpendicular to the parallels, yet corresponding areas on the sphere and projection are not equal except for the whole zone, as by construction.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE
A further modification is rnentione<l by l\fayer* to extend the proportionality of the whole also to parts of tlw zone, which, howe,'er, necessitates unequal meridional distances of the parallels and throws the distances further ont. The following pr!1jections are of the third class, i. e., have both s,ystcms of co-ordinates represented hy curved line;:;. Lambert'.~ projection preserves the proportionality of its areas with those on the SJlhere, but neither its meridians nor its parallels are equally divided, and these curves must be constructed by the aid of tables. In the projection of a hemisphere the central meridian appears as a straight line and the bonn<ling meridian as a circle,-which latter is the only line equally divided. ~tarting from the center, the length of the degrees on the central meridian ~nd on the equator are in proportion of' the sine of half the arc and they crowd consequently towards the circumference of the cliart. It has been but little used.t Bonne's pr~jection.-This most nsefu1 and extensively used 1ir11jection and which is also known as Flamsteed's modifietl projection,t differs from the simp1e conic develor1ment in this, that. each of the concentric p:ua11els of latitude is divided the same as on the sphere; through these points of intersection the curved meridians are passed. The curvature of' tlle arcs of parallels is given as before. It is the same as that of the middle latitude of the chart, the radius being equal to the cotangent uf this latitude. We thns have the straig·ht central meridian, as well as every parallel of latitude, divided on the projection the same as on the sphere respectiwly; all the meridians cut a parallel near the middle latitude at right angles; outlines on the sphere appear in nearly similar outlines on the projection, and the same scale of length may be used fur all parts of tl1e chart if not exceeding a few degrees in extent. It also preserves the proportionate equality of the areaR on the s11bere and on the projection. If the middle parallel of the chart coincidel:l with the equator, the projection merges into that of Flamsteed. The step from the pure conic to the Bonne projection waR a simple yet important one. The propriety of aiwtlJer modification, however, becomes npparent when it is notiePd that for very large areas an<l particularly in the higher latitudes, the mr.ri<lians and 1iarallels intersect quite obliquely. Tl1is dcfoct is in a great measure removed in the following projection. Bonne's projection was adopted by the Dep6t de la Guerre of France about 1803. 'l'he polyconic§ projection employs not only one tangent cone for the development of its middle parallel, but also a tangent cone for every parallel (and theoretically uses an infinite number of them). Each parallel of latitude, therefore, is independently developed. This has the effect of gradu:illy increasing the length of the degrees of latitude in Jlroportiou as we recede from the central meridian, upon which only they are correct. On the other hand, the angles of intersection of me1'idians and parallels approach to and nowhere differ extravagantly from right angles; but those fadng the pole and central meridian are always in excess of it. Ou charts representing the whole surface of a sphere this angle when greatest is about 1200; for a hemisphere, when greatest, it is about 10()0 ; for smaller clrnrts the intersections are everywlrere sensibly .'tt right angles. Thus, on the chart representing the whole of North .America ju Const Survey Report of 1805, p. 177, tl1e unaided eye can barely perceive an;y defect in these intersections.I\ It foUows that the similarity of tlrn fig·ures on the sphere an<l the corresponding ones on the projection is very close. The exact proportionality of tile corresponding areas on the sphere and the projection is sacrificed. Thi8, however, becomes only apparent for charts of large extent. Thus, for a hemisphere (+ and - 900 from the central meridian) the area becomes enlarged in proportion of 1 to 11 nearly. For all charts

of limited extent the same linear scale can be applied to all parts, the same as on B01rne'8 im~jec tion-in fact, for all ordinary charts published hy tht>. Coast SurYey (see catalo;ruc of 1875), there iH no appreciable difference whatever lJetween the Bonne alld tl1e pol:n~onie pr~jr.etions. It is onlr when they are compared on Yery lar;;e surfaces that. the dio;tiuguii:<liing fraturcs of the two lieeo1m· apparent. On the accompanying comparatiYe diagram these projections are sl1own for the whole splten·, the Bonne projection becoming transformed into a flamsteed projection. Besides this then' is shown a Bonne projection for middle latitude+ 300. The outline of the pol,rnonic pr(~jection appears as two lobes wit,h a cusp at each pole, noticed in Coast Surn'y Report for 18;33, p. 99, and exhibited in Coast Survey Heports for 1856, plate No. 65, and for 1859, plat<' No. 38. Respecting· the history of the Coast Sun'ey projections, I ha\'e but a fe1v remarks to offer. 'flie polyconic projection appears to have originated in conception -with Snperintemleut }'. H. Hassler, between 1816 and 1820, as may be inferred from the fol101Ying extract, taken from a series of papers co1mected with the early history of the united States Coast Survey and commtmicated hy him to the American Philosopl1ical Society, of Philadelphia, l\Iarell 3, 18:!0. On pages 406, 407 awl 40:-1 of an article "On the mechanical organization of a large survey, etc.," in Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. II, new series, .Philadelphia, IS:n, he sa~'S: ''The projection which I iutende1l to use was the development of a part of the earth's surface upon a cone, either a tangent to a certain latitude, or cutting two gfren parallels and two mcri(lians equidistant from the middle rneI"idian." This either refers to a simple conic, or to De l'Islc's or }lurdoch's projections. Further on (p. 407) he seems to refer to Bonne's prqjection. "The central meri1lian alone should become a straight line and all the other meridians and parallels broken lines, nearest the cmTe to which the.)' belong." The laist paragraph, hnt one, of the article refors directly, but somewhat vaguely, to the polycouic pr~jectio11. "This distrihntion of the prqjection in an assemblag·e of sections of surfaces of successive cones, tangents to or cutting a rt\\;nlar Hnccession of parallels and upon regularly changing central meridians, appeared to me the ouls one appli<-ahle to the coast ot tl1e Unit~d States. Its direction, nearly diagonal through meridian aud parallel, wonld not a!lmit of any other mode founded upon a single meridian and parallel without great tledations from the actual magnitudes and shapes, which would have considerable disadvantages in use.'' Thl're can be no room to doubt that the "successive cones" refer to the parallels 011 each particular ehart aud not to the mi(ldle parallels of a succession of charts. The first detailed account of the polyconie projection was puhlished h~- lllaj. E. B. Hunt, United States Engineers and Asssistaut CoaHt Suncy, in Coast Survey Heport of 185:l, Appemlix
No. 39, p. 99.

The first large chart published by the SurYey Office is that of Xew York ha~- and harbor (since superseded). It is in six sheets, scale :r<i\-00· It has simpl,\' (and nece;;sarily) a rectangnlar pl'qjection. It originated with Superintendent F. R. Hassler. His successor, Prof. A. D. Ilncl1e, in 181,1, carrie<l out the design of tlie chart of Long Island Sound, in three sheets,* scale ""J"" 0 ; also in 1844-'45, that of Delaware Bay and River, likewise in three sheets, t and on the same scak: these lrnYe conic prqjectious. The parallels of latitude are sensibly curved, but owing to their small latitudinal extent the meridians appear necessarily as straight lines aud consequently tl1e eharacter of the parti<'ular conic projection is not reYealed. There is, howeYer, reason to suppose that it was Bonnc's. 'l'he computations wl1ich hml been made for these charts -were exteude(i in 1BJ8t from latitude 4:..J~o to latitude 500, and from latitude 350 to 250. These tables wilh ml1litio11s applicable both to charts of large aml small ext,eut and with explanation of construd.ion (also accmupanied by some small tables useful for the draughtsman), were published in Uoast SmTey Report for 1853, pp. 96-16.3, and it should be remarked that these, as well as more extended tables, subB<'quently pnhlished, answer equally well for all kinds of conic projections. These tables take read~ account of the spheroidal shape of the earth. In the report of 18.'i6, pp. ~flll-:l07, Ai-isistant .1. E. Hilgard gave tables chiefly for charts of large extent.

iR also given by him for the same purpose, in the report of 1859, pp. 328-3ri8. More recently taules for facilitating the corn-1truction of .Mercator's and of the pol.yconic projections were pulJlished in book form by the Buri>an of Navig·ation, :Kavy Dt,partment, vVashingtou, 1869. On the g·cneral coast chart series,* seak 400l,10 " (catalogue Nos. 6 to21), the meridians are still senRibly straight, bnt on the most cxternkd cliartR (less than 7° in latitnde and 100 in longitude, exee1Jting one) issued 11.v the ofiice, the sailing charts t of the catalogue (Nos. 1 to 5), on a scale of TTob-000 , the cunature of the parallels and meridians becomes well marked, though that of the latter is yet extre11wly slight. On these charts the difference between the Bonne and the polyconic projections just heenmeR perceptible in Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 (although it may be obscured by unequal shrinkage of the paper) and is well marked on No. 5, embracing the Gulf of l\Iexieo, extending over 150 of' longitudes. In the ordinary Coast Survey practice of making projections for the use of topographic and hydrographic surTe,vs it is absolutely the same whether the polyconic or tlie Bonne projection be m;pd, si11ee the curvature of the meridians never becomes sensible and that of the parallels only rarely. Indeed, the two almost merge into the rectangular projection on our plane table and hydrographie sheets, scale To1u 0 -0 or 201uo0 , their ordinary actual size being three-quarter by one and a third meter, :j: and at most one and a half meter square. The trigonometrical stations are plotted by latitudP and longitude and verified b~- means of the computed and measured distances, the scale being perfoet.ly applicable. The preceding brief review of' various pn~jections and of those depending on conic development in particular, makes it sufficiently clear that the projection used for the Coast Suryey charts is one well adapted to topographical as well as to haruor and coast charts in general and that it also fully meets the wants of the navigator in the Coast Sur,·ey salling charts.§ These last charts (scale T-rrot.)<>o) I propo;;e to submit to a closer scrutinywith respect to amount of distortion and for direct comparison with Mercator's charts. For this purpose three lines have been selected, on chart No. 79, each of a length greater than an average day's run of a first-class ocean steamer and bearing (true) nearly east and west, southea;.;t aud northwest, and south and north respectively. The di;;tances and azimuths of these lines have bern computed aud comparisons hav.e been made between the corresponding results for the great circle of the sphere, for the rhumb line on l\Iercator's pr~jee tion and for the straight line ou Bonne's and on the polyeonie projections, II passing through the i-;ame given terminal point<>.

For so short a distance as three or four hundred ruile.s alHl in lat.itndes helow +50 7 the error in distance, as compared with the arc of a great circle, is generally le8s than two-tenths of a mile, or about -,., 1fi1,. of the length and is tlwrefore of no eonsequence to the uayigator. Ou Mercator's charts tl1f, diRtances (generally too great) can he measured very roughl.Y, but on Bonne's and 011 tlm polyconic cbarts it cau be done more accurately. In general, Bonne's projection gives the distance a little too short and the pol_yconic a little too long. These two projections also have the 1n·operty of presenting very nearl;.r within the limits of our charts arcs of great circles as straigl1t ]iJl(·s; thus the loxodromic curve (sPe chart, on which it is laid down by computation) or the rhumh to onr line I is fully 41 south of the great circle and of the sttaight line of our projection; for line 11 tl.Je distance is still 2!f miles, measured near the middle of each line.

Since 1871, when I began to carr~· on the work of the SmTey in Alaskan water:;;;, eYery opportunity has been used for adding to tlle knowledge of the cmTe11ts of the sea i11 tlwt and :uljacm1t regions, both by directing constant observations by the party uwle1· my charge, an<l also hy obtaining a record of observations made b;\- others, either from the logs of vessels cmployell iu the waters of .Alaska or from other sources. Only ver~· recently has tile accuumlation of !"ads lwt'11 sufiicient to form a sound foundation for any theory of the current.'> which was entitled to eo11si<leration, allll even now much remains to be done; hut the material aYailahle ba,o; seemecl s11tHd1,11t to dear awa;v much uncertainty, and to indicate witlt some probability tlte chief Ji~·drulogical characteristics of the region. The ohservations made by our party in 1880, taken in connection with the predom;ly pu !Jlished clata obtained by OnatseYich, in the western part of Bering Sea, for tlle first time brought into a clear light sundry marked discrepancies between the commonly receiYed theory of tlle cum~nts and the facts ob,o;ened. 1 \Vith a view of digesting all acces..,iblc material, tlle literature ha1' ht.~en carefully examine<l aml the results of previous observations collated with morP mod1·ru data. 1t has heen generally held that a branch of the J apancse stream or Knro Siwo pasRPd north, betwPen the western end of the .Aleutian chain antl the eoirnt of Kamcltat kn. c~xteuding· northwarcl and pastward through Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean. A polar e111n·11t was "uppo8ed to extend fro!Jl the Arctic Ocean, in a son th weRterly direction, lietween tlw :i h0Ye-111entio11ed liram:h of tile Kuro Siwo and the Asiatic shore. Another iiolar stream has lil·t·11 ,;tatcd to C'xtcml from the strait southward, east of Saint Lawrence and Saint l\Iatl1ew h;la111ls, aml then southwest, toward the Aleutians. This has been called tlie Bering current/ while the fornw1· wa8 termed the Kamchatka current. 3 Such are in brief' the views expressed in most works 011 the navigation of tlte Pacific and Bering ~ea; such as" Pilots" and "Directories," as well a:s 1110re pretentious treati:se..; on general hydrology. Before procediug to discuss the observations, it may be well to Rtate the chief sources from which information- has been derived. They are as follows: The voyag1·~· of King and l'lerke (of Cook's expedition), in 1778-'794 ; of Krusensteru, in 1803-1806", and Kotzel.ne: in 1816-'lR all(l 18!.W -----------------

ON '.rIIE TE:\fPERATURE OF THE S"GRFACE OF THE SEA. 1

AR 1he rnotiou of oceanic waters is partly detnmined by their temperature. Ro their patl1s may often be traeed out li~· isothermal ctuves of the snrface of the sea. .As tllc motion is rnmally less nie}lStuable witli aecuracy, when normal, than tlw temperature, and is mud1 more rapidl,v lo~t, it often liappcns that tlt(l distribution of current-water' can l.Jp mnd1 more accurately determined hy study of its temperature tl1an in any other way, and tliat the effects of a 8pecial eurrcnt ma)· lw determined with certainty to exi8t oYer an area far exct·edinp; that iu which it can lie proved to haye a pl'rceptible constant motion in any given direction. Conven:ely, if a large body of water be shown to lrn ve a n<'arly uniform i-;ummer temperature, corresponding in general with the normal of the latitude and with the local eircumstancct" in its particular portions, this ill, of itself, eYide11ce that no large liody of water intrmles \Yithin its borders from a region of a different normal temperature. In other -words, in the general oceanic circulation a stI·pam of water with a temperature normal to one latitu<le eanuot moYe to a region where another temperature is normal without exhibiting its presence by deflection of the isotltenw;. A study of the sea temperatures of the Okhotsk aud Hering Sea basins develo11s the following facts: In shallow water><, that is in depths of ten fathoms or kss, during tlie long days and under the seorclling sun of the .Arctic summer, a higher degree of temperature i~ found thau that which obtains in adjacent deeper water. CJ011:-1NJIH'Utly, in the sounds, g-nlfa, arnl bass, es1wcially on the eastern or shoalt~r side of Bering Sea, we find a midsummer temperature which would only he normal to a mnch more southern latitude. The same is true of the Arctic basin, and when, moved by wiud, tide, and ot1H~r influences, tl1is warm water (as in the Yiciuity of Bering Strait) is transported into the midst of bodies of water of a lower tem11crature, it, for the time a11d area within "·hid1 the <'hange takes place, has an intluence as great and of the 8ame nature as that which might be exPrcisPtl by u similar lwtl;- of water whid1, iu the course of occauic circulation, had lwe11 brought to the same locality from China or Japall. These bodies of warm water are necessaril_y rather small, and from their superficial character ~-idd to the changeR of the :snaRon and weather much more rapitUy ti.tau the coui;t:rntly re-enforced :supply of a great ocean current. ITence the time of their maximum of temperature al ways accords witl1 tliat of the aerial maximum of their local region, while the correspomling maximum of cnrreutwa.ter fretprnntly occurs in cold regions some time after tlw local seasonal maximum has passed. The presence of ice after the warm season commp11crs in the seas mentioned has less influence in keepiug down the surface temperature tlian miglit be expected. It is surprising, iu many Cltses, to note how the water retains nearly its norm,11 temperature up to v;ithin a Yery short distance from a large field of' ice. The use of tlle thermollleter in dense fogs is a widely-extended practice among those naYigators who have reason to think tlwnrneln:s in the vicinity of ice, and desire to guard against collisions. IJowm·er, iu sea1·chiug· for currents, etc., by the sea temperatures, espeeiall~- in the Arctic, where ice is abnndant, the 1wigliborhornl of the ice must be taken into account, or the concltrnious will lw imtrnstworthy. For the same reasons obseryations taken in Bering Sea aft.er the ice is wholly gone arc more satisfactory as a basis of discussion, and ha<;c iu this paper alone been used, except where otherwise stated. Another factor contrilmtl':,; to the condition of tlie shallows. 'When the large ifrers which PJttcr Bering Sea arnl the Arctic tir:st !weak up in t!Jc spring, they carry with them large quantities of fresh-water ice, and hence for a fow tlays arc uot unrnh warmer than the sea into w!iielt they fall. Very r11pi<lly, however, their temperature rh;es, and under the continuous lmams of the hot Ar·ctic sun their waters become much warmer than the adjacent sea, 'vhich is yet, in most cai,;es, hardly free from its lioud;; of ice. In 01ieni11g passages between J.!Jc ice awl the shore, the important influence of the large rirnrs hits been recoguizecl by most stmleuts of the .Arctic regions, and iu cases of large rivers heading far to the southward of their month1', such ~s the Lena, the l\facIn this report all bcariugs am lr;w; all mks in knots and tl'nllu< p~r hour; all distances in nautical miles; all depths in six-foot fathoms; all temporatnres in the text are Fahrenheit seal<·, tliose in parentheses or tabulated in broad-faced type are of centigrade scale; all latit.ude~ are Horth; all longitudes west of Greenwich; except where other1

The course of September 17 was run from the south and west, the otliers from the northwest. The temperature in Norton Sound, July 7 to 10; varied from 52° to 58° (lF.1 to lF.4) latet in the season, September 1,1 to 17, it was nearly uniformly 44° (fJ0.7). 'l'be temperatUI'(· at Cliami:-;so Island, Kotzebue Sound. July rn, 17, varied from 440 to 480 (G 0 .7 to s::i.£1). Having SePn that the diurnal variation in the same locality may amount to eight or more degrees of l<'abren1 eit~ the variation in any one place <'luring the year ma;y be considered. 'l'his may be <hw to either of two causes, or to a combination of both of them. The first cause i;,; the normal change of the seasons. Tlte second is the intrusion of a current, with a temperature not normal to the sea-basin wltic h it t>nteni, and wllich temperature may fluctuate from the operation of causes existing in the region whern·e the current comes, but not existing in that region which it enters. The sea-trmperature record of any locality not affected by currents as aboYe should agree in general as to range and times of maxima and minima with the thermal characters of the ad,iacent terrestrial climate, and the differences should be cbiefiy differences of retardation and more limited rauge. Thi>' follows from the obvious fact that the sea water recciYes and parts with iti; beat more slowl;-.- than the air, an(l seldom to the same extent. Tile following table shows the annual range of sea-temperature in a few localities ahout Bering Sea, and indicates in a general way the fluctuations and times of maximum aud mi1.imum temperature. Except when marked with an asterisk the figures are from continuous <laily ollserrntions -with standard iustru JJents.

Thh tablP was cleriYed from the above-mentioned annual means and parts of other broken series, and has neces;;arily a merely approximate character. The corrections often reduced to agreeal)lt' nui,;on, ohserYations taken on different yoyages iu adjacent spots, and the table especially for the opeu sPa, was of much use; it was eYident, ltowever, that it did not take into account 1mfficiently the di1fonmces which gh-e a different sunmu.>r temperature to the shallows and de_eper portions of the sea, and that one table could not be applied over latiturleR extending from 45° to c:;o without Yergiug iuto extremes in the higher and lower latitudes, which tlid not agree with the facts. Soine general ideas were :--:·nined from tile attempt, howeYer, and the discrepancies between Yarious spaso11s which 11ad hefore hl·eu noticed were more clearly brought out. It is <·vident from the following Pxarnples that different seasons <lifter widely in their aqueous as well as in their aerial temperatures, if such expressions ma~- be permitted. In running from U ualashka to Sa int Paul lslaml, in 187 4 (.July 21, 22), the temperatures varied from 48° to ;;40 (SO.!) to 120.2). In 1880 (August 3-.'i), o\·er the same line, they 'varied from 440 to 430 ((P.7 to 8 8 .H), when liy theory they should haYe been warmer tllan the first series. Bnt 1880 wa11 a cold and cloudy ;;eason, everywhern a month late, while 1874 was a warm and sunn,r season. Again, in maki11g the passage from the coast of Kamchatka toward the western end of the Al<·utian chain in July, 1873, Captain Belknap obtained temperatures varying from 42°.6 (fi 0 .!l) to -!i 8 .2 (8°.4). These observations agree with those of Onatsevich a year or two later. Ou the other liaml, the ol1servations of Du Petit 'l'honars on the Venus, in September, 1837, a little more soutl1erly hut in the same general region, varied from 51 o (10°.6) to 530 ( 11°.7), ~1greeing with tlrnse made eai·lier by Beechey. These observers all worked with standard instruments, aud the !lifference is explained when, on referring to their logs, we find that the Venus and Blos;;om had fine surmy weather, while Bel}\nap and Onatsevich, for the most part, bad very cloudy or foggy weather. It is evideut, therefore, that uo system except ouc based upon a much larger series ef local and other obser\·atiorns can repre11ent the summer temperature of tliis region within a range of seYeral degrees Fahrenheit. Severtheless, the mass of observations accumulated is sufficient to giYC us a good general idea of the tem11eratures, subject to the uneertainty above mentioned. 1finter teinperatnres.-The minimum sea-temperatures of the year seem to occur toward the end of .l\farch. At that time the ice attai11s its greatest-· extension, and exercises its maximum l'll\·d upon the temperature of the sea. The grn1eral oceanic circulation is then at its minimum. The Okhotsk Sea, from the best eyidence we can obtain, seems ordinaril,y at this time everywhere it1t;om111oded hy ice, either in extensi\·e solid :(ields, or more or less moving smaller floes drifted by the wiud.

In my discussion of this snl\ject in tlie )feteorological Appendix to the Coast Pilot of ldaska (pp. 4;)....4fi), I showPd tliat 1iaYip;ation opens on tl1c northern shore abont .June 5 aml dost>:,; about October 17, tltPre hPing- an annaYig·able period of some 2~)() <la:y>;; 011 tlie southern aru1 'n·stt>1·11 shores it opens almut ,Jnne 11 and doses about NoYemlwr ;10, a))(l for thP <>asten1 ,.J1orc 110 data are obtain:1ble. 'flw. l'in·rs ut>nally break up in ~Iay, and close in Nm·ember, river lWYigatiou beiup; practicable for a somewhat longer period than tLat of the sea. The ice in Beri11g Sea nuiP:-; in different :p~ars in it;, exknt, <lepemling nrnd1 upon the <lire<·tion and force of the \Yinds, aml upon the t<·mperature of the paitienlar whiter ;;1~n;;on. Tl1e h1ttPr itself depends greatly upon th:~ wiIHl;,, bf'illg much lower in those season,; when th<' wind>' preYail from the nortu for loug perhds and h1·ing loose tloc ice from the north, wlliclt i8 preYented (by tl1e formation of new ice north of it) from returning to its original station wlleu tlw wirnlH cli:rnµ\· to the south. It is noteworthy that a stuuy of the remark-books of nirious whalers shows tliat the ice break,.; up and dis1tppears much more rapidly when the wind and current pass from it thau it doe,.; wllen they tend toward it, if tlrn temperature be ab<ffe that re<p1ired for the formation of new ice. Since the first work of the wh:iler;; on arriving in Ileting Sea i8 to cruise along the e<lgc of the paek, seeking to get to the northward, I liave been able to tletenuh1e for each of 1-'ix or rwxen years, from 1870 to 1~78, the aYerage, southern limits of the pack iu April l\rnl :\ta,,.-, between the meridians of 1G9° and 190° west of Greenwich. T!Ie remainder is toleraoly well uwlerstood from reports of winter cruises by the fur.traders of the region, and from report.s a1< to tlw opt>niug and dosing of uavig·ation at variouR ports on thi:-; ;,ca. }'rom these sources we learn that the t>rlge of the ice extends from a point in about latitude 57° OH Aliaska Pcnirnmla. cnniug to the northwanl and westward toward the Prihiloff falands, a!Hl generally passing at least a degree to the north from tllem, t.\it'n curYi11g again to the S{)ntllward it genernlly vr~·sents a hrn:11l tongue in lougitnde al1out 174°, often reaching south to the Yicinity of latitude ;J(iO, and tlien <:xtm11ling in au ·irregular line 1Yestwanl, mmalls between latitrnfos ;)(jO arnl ;)SC!, towarrl tla· coast of K:irncliatka, off which it forms a lwlt lJ to 30 miles in widtll, which is often cutirt·l~· !lisi;ipalt>tl for short periods b,Y wn;tPl'l,Y wiIHls. This ice disappears for the se1u;o11'usnally about tile middle or end of May, ancl begin:-; to form anywhere from tile entl of October to tl1e middle of Decemlier, according to the se~ts011. The following nott>s, taken from the whale1·:-;' rPmark hoolrn, will illustrate the rate of decay iu the ice, and progress iu opc11i11g to na\'igatio11 the waters of Dering Sea and Strait and tlic Arc ti<:. AJH'opos of this, attention ma~- be called to the fact, elsewhere 1'hown by me, that the sea opens to the westward of Saint Lawrence l8lantl first, it freqnentlr being navigable there allll north of the islanrl into Norton Sound, at a time in the season when the passage lwtween Nnnirnk falaml and Saint Lawrence is still blocked with decaying ice. It is noticeable that the water opens iirst where the i;outherly cold set away from the. i~e is strongest, according to all authoritic;;, and where OnatseYieh declares his co1wictfon that no warm current exists. · 8hip Uonrost, Jnne n, 1871, re:iched Cape Chaplin; .Tune 14, was abreast of the Dionwrles; June lli, passed East Cape; August ti, passed Icy Cape; September 14, beset off Waillluight Inlet without an.r clrnnce of escape and was abandoned.

To the wefltward tl1ey reached 11earl.r to Herald Island by October 7, and left tbe Arctic October 20, after the hardest SNIHOJl Captain 0Wt'll !Jarl CYCr experiencell.

In nearly all these cases it is to be understood that the vessels were following up the open . water and advanced as fast as the breaking up of the ice would allow.The time of breaking np of the ice hetweeu Cape Navarin and Plover Bay varies so much witlt the season tuat no general rnlP can be laid do\\·11. Yessels have reached Cape Thaddemi in April; on other occasions thc~- ha\-e n@t gotten east, of lougitur1e 1soo in that vicinity until nearly the end of ,June. The whalers nm·er pass to the eastward of Saint :Mathew au<l Saint Lawrence Islaud8, as the ice stays d1ere later; in 1880 the Corwin found a narrow lane along the mainland shore b,\· which she reaehed Norton Sound .Tune 18. The earliest time at wbich Nort-0n Sound has heen known t-0 be accessible to vessel8 is }\fay 25 (in 1874)1 the latest, June 22. Tbe average-is ahout .lune 10. The Yukon breaks up in freshets Ia.sting two weeks, beginning from l\lay 15 to _June 5, the awrage being about .May 23. The 11igh water arising from the melting snows lasts rnm1y wl"ek" after the freshet wllich carries awa.\' the river ice. Tlte northwesterly current thus generated canies away the rotten field ice toward Bering Strait when it bas not previously dll;appeared. Captaiu Hooper of the Corwin saw a field of it drifting into the strait July 5 which he ba<l to go to the west side to avoid; but this wits a very unusually late season in all resriects. The southern portion of Bering Sea along the Aleutians is rarely if ever troubled by ice, and the northern border of the Pacific is practically always free from ice except possibly a rare fragment formed in some narrow passage or drifted south by some severe winter gale. The sea temperature is probabl_y about 40° (40.4) in winter, varying from 36° to 44° (20.2 to 6°.7) according to weather. None lower than 36° (20.2) has actually heen ohserved so far as is known. Summer temperatures.-The remarks previously made in c01111ection with the correction tallfo for summer temperatures indicate its merely approximate character; it will, however, be intere8ting to compare an actual reduction of ohser;-atious taken with the mean resulting from a computatiou of the theoretically corrected figures. The Oklrotsk Sea is practically a closed basin partaking of a continental climate, and couseq nently might be expected to present us with a higher summer and lower winter temperature than an equal area of open sea in the same latitude, which being unconfined would be operat,ed upon h;-1- tbe general oceanic circulation. Again, the temperatnres taken being mostly on soundings of less than 100 fathoms, tl10 factors which deter-mine a greater summer temperature for shallow waters might be expected to result in

a more than normal warmth for the localities tested; winter ohsern1tious when tlte 1:1ea is ice uonnd being, of course, ;rct to be made. The fact agrees with the h;rpothcsi1:1, whet It er the latter be or he uot ('Orrect, sim·c the oli::;c1Tatio118 of one humlred and twenty different localities (due to Erman1 and Onatse.-icl1), r;mgi11g on·r nearly the whole summer season (July to September), theoretically correctf'd, giH'. us a mr:m maximum 1:1nmmer temperature for thiH sea 50°.5G (10°.31 ). The meau of the olisen-ations as th Py were taken is 490.26 (90,59), a difference of less than a de;...rre(· and a half. Loealizing the obserrnhons, those of the east shore, uncorrected, taken in the earl~- part of .Tilly, average 46°.1 (1°.8), those of the north !'lhore, ,July and Angust, 4B0.88 (9°.38), aml thot<l' of tl1e west shore, taken i11 S(·ptemher mostly on the shallows east :tl:om Sakalin Island, 500.4-5 (l00.2~~). If Hie temperature,.; of the deeper central and southern parts of the sea liad been at< thoroughly teste!l we shouhl prohahl,\- find that the theoretical mean summer sea-snrfac-e temperature of ahout 45°.0 (70.2) was uot far from the trutl1. It is true that some current passei,; through La Perouse Strait into the Okhotsk, especially toward tile end of summer; but, from Onatsevich's obsern1tions, the resulting effect on the tt·mperatnre of the i,;ea near the strait would seem to he of a very insignificant cbaraet<Jr. If, then, a sea free from great oceanic warm currents rea~hes a summer rnaximmn of aliont :;oo.o (lOO.O), should we not expect greater things from one in the same latitude iuto which a great. warm current h; said to llring borrowed heat in addition to itr-; normal tem1>eratun· ? Bering Sea may be divided for consideration of its temperature into thr·ee di,·isions: 1. The shallows, snch as Bristol Bay and vicinity, Nort-0n Somul, and the region off the coast of the maiuland wbere the depth is less than twenty-five fathoms. !.l. The moderate depths extending from the southern entrance of Bering Strait west of the line bouu1ling the shallows and t·xternling soutlt to a liue drawn from Cape Thaddeus toward Saint Mathew, the Prihiloff falands, and the peninsula of Ali~Jrn, following as uearl,v as we may the sevent,y-five-fathom curve. I,astl,\-, the deep watN:s 8outh an<l west from tliis line to Kamchatka and the Aleutian Islands. Taking up these regions successively, we find the sliallows of Bristol Jfay and Yicinit,v ha dug a theoretical meau summer maximum of 540.0 (l20.2), and an obserYed maximum of 5u 0 .2 (130.4), during the unusual!,\· warm season of 1874. The shallow8 of Sorton Sound from actual obserYatious, by Hiedell, ha,·e for .July and August an average temperature of 5(lo .Oti ( 130 .36), with a maximum of 620 .0 (mo .7 ), and, including September, haYe a mean temperature for the three summer months of 530.!l (l20.2), at least for 1812. These ohsen·ations were made with a sta1ulard instrument, fnrnishe!l b,\· the T;nitetl States Coast Hur,·ey. Captain Hooper'is observations made in a less favorable season, and covering only a ii.'w days, indicate a similar relation between the deeper waters and those of the sound. The temperature of the area of moderate depths is considerably less. Taken as a whole, they present a theoretical mean summer maximum of 460,2 (7°.9), and an average summer temperature of 400.2 (4°.G). This is somewhat too high for the northern portion and too low for the southern portion, but agrees very fairly with the mean of actual observations .rno.s (S0.2) aml 420.1 (5°.u) respectivel;r, and the conclusions from more meager evidence, published iu Appemli~ I to the Alaska Coast Pilot. These means are deriYell from observations taken in the open sea aml appear low when compared with the observations taken at Unalai,;lika, with a summer meau of 51°.1 (too. G), and at Saint Paul Island 47°.3 Falu. or 8°.5 C.; but it must be remembered that tllc>;e 'rere taken in shallow water, near the shore, aml do not adequately re1)I'esent the off-shore temperatures. The high temperatures of Norton Sound are only comparable for tlte three months opeu-~rntPr period, with temperature taken farther south, for if tlle ice-bonml months of .May alHl June, a]](l the cold October were included (as tlie~· might be at Unalashka), the. temperature would he reduced to 440.s (70.1 C.) for the seaBon. For these reasons I ha\'e only considered tlie three months of .July, August, and September in these comparisons. The deep area of .Bering Sea is also a southern area, and might therefore he expected to have a higher temperature than the rest, even if it were uot the part which by popular hypothesis shoul!l receive a bo!ly of warm water from the .Japan Stream. A reduction of the aetual obserYations from one hundred and twenty-two different locali · ties, each representing, in general, the mean of a day's obsen·ations, shows that the maximum and mean summer temperatures are hut little highm· than those of the area of moderate depths,

IV fire such a distrilmtion iutlientetl l>y the facts in this rl'gion, it1' tliscm;sion would have been the first thing in order; since that is not the <'.ase, a discnsi\ion of that part of the problem will appear later, in connection with a reYiew of the facts ki1own in regard to the Japanese Stream arnl its extension north and west. Since the Arctic lmsin is constantly more or less obstructed by ice, it is impracticable to apply <lll,Y theoretical corredioirn to irnn·s:pH'hronous ohxenations, and I hare therefore attempte<l to ohtain a mean summer temperature on tlrn ba;;is of the observations as they stawl. ](otr.ehnc Sound, wlte11 free from i<'e, hears the same relation to the rest of tlle hasin as does Xorton Ronnd or Bri;.;tol Bay to the basin of Bering Sea. I find from the mea11 of all acc1·ssiblP obsPnations (n·dnccd according to their weights), that tlie nwan temperature of Kotzebue Sonllll for .Tul,v and .Aul.!ust is 4!J0.8 (9C.9); for .Tnly, August, and SPptember (iuclnding one \"ery cold Septeml1er), tl.te rnea11 tcmpcrnttire is 440,s (18.1 ). Tlw mean temperature for the Arctic basin from July to September (being tLe time when the st'a i.- m01·e or Jes;; opeu or free from ice), rednce<l in the same way, for the regions between \\'rangdl Island and .Amerka, Pxclusive of Kotzebue Som11l and Bering Strait, is ·!0°.23 (! 8 .3t'\ ).

THE KURO SIWO AND ITS EXTENSIONS.

The q nest ion of llistrilmtion of temperature in the sea is so iut.imately uni tell with that of the character of its curreuts, that it is impraetieal1le t-0 separate them entirel:·. Consequently, as soon as one Jca\·es the general 11nestion of mean tem1wrature of a given area, and desires tu decide whetller that temperature is uol'J11al, and if uot, from whence aud how it is tle1·iyeiJ, the features of oceanic circulation must at once make part of tl1e 1liseussio11. To reach the root of the matter it is necessary to inquire into tlle origiu, duration, aml extent of the Kuro Siwo, out.side of the Bering Sea region. The datlt fnrnisbc'l hy Ur. Antisell enable me to tlo this in a more satisfactory manner than wonlll otherwise be possible. It is true they relat6

The latter enters a deep ocean without obstructions and about seYent,v degrees of longitude in width. The Kuro Siwo, at its Yery outset, is obliged to force its wa~· through the barrier of the r,oochoo Islands, and a little later through that chain of rocks, shoals, and islets extending from Yokohama to the Bonin Islands. It then l1as near1~- one hundred degrees of longitude to trawrse hefol'e r<'aclli11g the opposite sllore of the l'acitie. \Vheu to these barriers i8 added the Rtrength of the northeast monsoon from the enu of September to the end of Februar~-, blowing right in the teeth of the cmT1·nt (which is not, like the Gulf Stream, prcveukd h~· an unbroken line of coast from escapinp: i11 :1 westerly dirt>ction), it is not a matter of surprise that its force should be checked, and iti' <'OH· tinuity as an eastward current be for the time almost obliterated.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

The course of the Knro Siwo, as indicated by >arious authorities, when in its greatest strength, is from 1he >icinity of Yokohama in an easterly and northerly direction toward the northwest coast of' America, which it reaches in about latitude 50°. For our purposes, the character < f that part of the stream lietween the meridians of 2200 and 1850 west from Greenwich is of more hwce. Liitke observes· that, in six Yoyages between Kamchatka and the south, while 11ctween latitude 30° and 42° and longitude 214° and rns 0 , a steady current, flowing eastward, eYen with easterly winds, was noted. Ju one southward vo;rnge, it was first met with in latitude 330, on a oocond at 40°. "North from the parallel of 420 in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, we chanced to have almost constant easterl.v winds, and with them westerly currents which, when the winds were Yery strong, amounted sometimes to 20 miles a day, and which, when it became calm, disappeared entirely. In some cases, on the contrary, when the wind blew from the northwest the t>nrrent then turned to tlle southeast, the direct influence of the wind herein being evident'' (Liitke, I. c., p. HIO). Tl1ough Llitkc reports that Mertens took observations of sea tcm11eratun·s, it docs not appear thlit they have anywhere been published, and the observations of Beechey are so much generalized in his appendix as to be untrustworthy for close comparisons. Du Petit 'L'houars, during the vo~"agc of the Yemu;, took hourly temperatures, which have been admirably worked up iu tlw published records of the voyage. In latitude 30° longitude 180°, he fonml the temperature of the axis of the Kuro Siwo to be 81° (27°.5). The normal temperature of the Paeitic Ocean about latitmle 400 to 45° is about G0°.0 (15°.G). He found that the temperatures rapidly deereased northward, falling from 7iP (23.0) to 53° (11°.7) in only three degrees of latitude; hut of thi8 change twel"vc degrees (71 o to 590 l·'ahr.) ocm1rred upou one day (August 17, 1837), between latitude 400 and 410, which would place the northern edge of the Kuro Siwo at the period of its greatest strength about latitude 410 in longitude 197°. The observations of Belknap, taken in .lune, show that the isotherm of 500.0 (l.50.6) does not pass much nortll of 42° north latitude, anrl that the temperature then wry rapi<lly decreases northward, falling 15° Fahrenheit in 150 111iles. Tlie ohservations of Onatsevil\h in the same rPgion, taken at di1forent periods of the year, agree with those of l~elkuap. "\Vith reganl to tlie propagation of temperature (an<l inferentially of motion) in the waters, forming the supposed hed of the Knro Siwo, the data obtaiue(l by Antisell are of high importancC', aurl go far toward sustaining the view that the current is dependent for its existence, east of Yokohama, upon the southwest monsoon. In other words, that it is turned in a southeast direction or obliterated by the northeast rnonsoou. The track of the Pacific Mail Steamships, in the Yoyages referred to (leaving out of' consitlcration a few tlegrees at the San Francisco end) lies almost wholly between the parallels of 30° antl :1.10. Between the meridians of 220° aml 190°, it cuts obliquely across the current,, an<l if it he true, as there is 1·eason to suspect, that tlie current has, in general, a consitlerabl.r ruore southern course than has been supposed, the track woultl lie in its trough for a nnwh greater tlistance. The northeast monsoon hegins to disappear in February. In March the North Pacific appears to ht~ in its most homogeneous condition. The means of' six or eight daily observations continued throughout the voyage (4, 750 miles), the diurnal fluctuations being eliminated, show extreme differences of only four degrees Fahrenheit. From longitude 217° to 136°, in the mean latitude 3;$0 03', the sea 0111~, rnried from Goo to 6-1° (15°.6 to 17°.8). It is quite evident there is no warm cmTent here. In April: over a course averaging a degree anti a half further nortli, t.he t~m1pcrature was somewhat lower and the variation a little larger (57° to 63° Fahr.), but still remarkably l1omogeneous. In May the warm water begins to creep north, along the Japanese coast. In records of three voyages, amid some seasonal differences tl1is change is clear. From longitude 217° to 2oso, in these three years the temperature has risen in the last week in May to between 64° and 68° (17°.8 and 200.0). Thence eastward it still retains a lower and pretty uniform temperature, which is in tlie mean latitude 3()0 12', from 57° to 63°; fifteen days lat.er, in mean latitude 330 29', 530 to Goo, ancl in mean latitude 360 16', from 58° to 640 Fahrenheit. Iu .June the Kuro Siwo is putting forth its strength. From Yokohama eastwarcl to longitude

The ('lllploy11wut of Celsim;' scale, as T hail at, first intt·ndecl, with its c·mnbersome nml ine,·itable fractions of dPgTees, \Yonltl have increased the size of the table (alreacl~· too larg·e for com·euieut printing) uearl~- one-tliird. The date of arri>al or dPp:irture from Yokohama aml San Frau<'isco is gi,·e11 mHlt~r its :1ppropriat9 heacl at either elHl of the table, with a ('olnnm ;;howiug the temperatnrc of the wakr in tlic harhor at the time of arriYal or departure. It "·ill be ohserwcl that this is almost inYariahl~· colder than the sea water outside ot' thP haruor, except umler the inflneuce of au Angm;t sun at Yokohama. The columns of mean temperatures follow m11.lcr their appropriate meridians. A few peculiar single ohscrYatiollS (denoting, perhaps, cool bands of surface water) are inclose<l in parentheses, as wortl1.r of attention, im;teatl of being iswampecl in the general mcaus. A hea,·y line separates tlw obserYations of the lm.;t <lay of a11~· month from those of the following da~·, so that the data relating to particular mouths ma~- be singled out if desired. The mean latitude of till' principal part of tlw <·om·se, givl'IL at the right of tlte tahle, is that between meridians 1400 and 210°. This was mmally run 011 a nearly east all(l west. line, and the means show the relatiV{' latitmle of the seYeral voj·ag·es. Two voyages hy the '' northeru route" are marked with an asterisk, and are not included in the mean for the year or the other general means. The means for the ~·ear and for ''June-Kov." and "Dec.-M:ay" show the average annual temperature of the North Pacific in the mean latitude for eyery second meridian, as far as it can be deduced from the material in hantl; also the same fC)r the 11eriods when the favorable (southwest) mo11soon and the (northeai'\t) anti·monsoon winds are blowhig.

The last column i11 tl1P hi hk shmYS ihc mcH11 temperatnre of thP north Padfic for tlll' lllf'llll latitude and season of each Yoyage. It must be borne in mind, in consid1'ring the table and tlle sultject to which it relatPs, that the Pacific, like Bering Sea and other bodies of water, as well as the atmospllere at any lonllity 011 land, varies in different ~·ears, so that in a relatiycly small series like the present tllere ma~- 111", and probably are, some anomali(·s due to this cause. A Yery much Iarg·er series would be re11uirP1l to eliminate these and other sourceR of enor; but, notwithRtanding all this, the gl'ncral conc1nsiom; afforded may be safely taken m; relatfrcly correct, though the" beneh-mark'' of the series wigl1t he changed in absolute leYel hy the discussion of a greater amount of material. The general accuracy of the obsen-ations iR attested hy their agreement with thosl' takc11 hy the Challenger in the same region a1frl nt the same time of the year. It is hardly necessary to point out that the anomalies of temperature 1lne to enrre11t in :rny particular voyage are almost, lost in the general meaus for the ;year or half' ;rear. foformatiou on these points must be sought in the recor1hi of single Yoyages. The cooler area ahout tl1e meridian of liOO I take to he due, perhap:<, 11ot e11tirely to cold water from the north, lmt also in part. to the fact that here in the gfre11 latitude the axis of the Kuro Siwo passes nor.th of the usual track of the steamers. This, howen~r. requires further observation. The fact that in the two most northern yoyag·t·s, the eoolcr area, occurs further to the westward (1880) tend:s rather to show that it is due t-0 the Kamchatka stream, and that that has it more or less· easterly tendency as it progresses southward.

Tlw totals ahm·e are the resnltants of the whole nm. It will he observed that the drift, except that preceding Station III, is in alternate directions, and the seYcral drifts so compensate each othl·r that only the easter!,\· current is left. I believe tllat we met the falling Asiatfo tide at it;; greakst strength at East Cape; that opposit\» tho Diomec:les we encountered an edd;y (Station IY); tbat we then encountered the falliug tide (nearly done rnnniug) from the American sitle (Station V); that at Station YI, or thcrcahouts, tlw rising title drifted us 11ortheastward; while, Oil appronchi11g tlw slioal wa(Pr near Station vn, we CllCotl1ltl·red anotlwr e1l1l.r; aml ti.mt the >iet encountered hetw1·eu YlI a11d Ylll W<ls tlue to the rising title coming around Cape Priuce of \Vale;;;. Too much stress must not he laid on thel'c obscrnltioBl'i, for it is e\·irlcnt, considering the short distance;;; run and the strong breeze, tlrnt they are liable to error both in amount and direction, arni consequently in rate.

'.l'he preceding note:;; and quotations show~ howev-er, that opposing cnrre11ts exist in the strait at difierent times; that. there is a gradual derrease in warmtll of watt'!' from 1war the American side OYer toward Asia; that the YPl'ticality of the hmtherm;;. as slwwn iu the section, apart from other concurring circmnstauces, iutlicafo there is 110 reason to ,.;u.-ppet a uy sul1111ari11e cnrreut of cold water; the strong norther!,\· m1tl sout}ierl~· eurrents l1ai-e hee11 experimwl·d on hot h sides of the strait h.r various mtvigators; and tlwrefore, without further 11roof, it is nusafc to assume, in opposition to the present evi<lenee, that a cold current rnnH iioutll on one side while a warm one runs north on the other. \Yhat, then, is the explanation of theHe facts! l\Iy own opinion

REPOH'l' OF THE SUPBRINTENDENT OF THE

of tlH~m, subject to modifi·:ation with greater knowledge, is about as follmrn: A glance at the chart shows that the eastern coast of Asia, horderi11g on the i:;trait, is dee11ly indented by bays, tit .. headlands of which arP bold and projecting. The American coast, on the contrary, is smooth, aull the aetio11 of the <'HITPnt has ne:irly eloi;ed tlte siugle indeutatiou at Port Clarence by the formation of a long· and narrow gravel spit, along which the tides nm as if the em1st were cuntinuons. Tue opening would donhtle8S long since have been close(l were it 11ot that a considerable riwr discharges itself into Grantley Harbor at the head of Port Ularen<:e. Th Pre are no rivers of any t·ousequem·e on the Asiatic shore, antl the rocks :ire or a mnch harder nature, aml the currents are nJtwl1 weaker; hence the i-;pits formed on that siJe are small a111l insig-niticaut. 'l'lie still mttPr bdwee11 the headlands of the Asiatic si1le remains iee-homul lo11g- after the ceuter aml Arnerinm Hide of the strait.~ an· dear, a.s there is 110 enrrent to carry away the ice, and it is sheltered from 11eayy winds. Even after the ict· has melted, if au.y iR brought into the strait from north of East Cape by northerly winds and h.Y the title, it is carrie(l into tl1esP, hays, antl may remain thc>re (lnring- the rnmainder of the seas01i. Tlie water iu tltest· lmys aml their Yicinity is thn,; ke11t cool; the air from tltc ice cools the immediately atlja1:eut :shun·; the warm water from the Anwrieau side, heing (as J suppose) nwYetl d1ietl.Y by the tides, ntn·ly lias pp1·si8te11<'l' e11ongh in rnotiou westwanl to reach these recesse8, and is repelled autl Jimiteil (as '"".']>recl1t has slwwn to be the case elsewliere) h.r tlie stagnant ice; the great freshets of the Yukon arnl other American river,: (thei-;e lasting al.lout three week:-:), which strew all these coast>' with drift-wood, are in most cases loug past before the ice barrier is melted, so that on this Asiatic coa8t, as compareu \rith the American coast ninety miles awa~·, the climate is colder, the vc~etatiou le;;s luxmiant (this also partl.Y ou account of difterence in soil), and tlic drift-wood is prt>nmtetl from larnliug, mul carried farther north or south-being found almndantly in either direction. "-"ham seen that the tides ou UH· American .side 111arcl1 1101tlt :tlJ(l west; that the curre111 of tlie \:ukou, ohse1Ted by Hooper aml othm·,., rum; in a N. l~P w·. tlircdio11; we know that the form of the earth and the prcYalent southerly winds of suuuncr com biue to make the northerly tendency stroug-er than that iu the n·vcrse direction; we know that on certain oecat;io11s the tidal How hat; be1·11 tlii-;t iiwtly uote·l in the strait, and that emTent8 in opposite 1lirections liave lieen there obt;crved liy tlitlereut navig-ators. 1 condudc from this that the current, tl1rong!J the st,rait is a resultant from these forces, aud that its tem1wrature. i11 its warmest i1art is due to the mo\·emm1t of Jhe warm watcr.s of the Yukou, of Norton and of Kotzelme Sounds oscillating back ai1d forth with the title. \Ve lrnYP shown definitely that the warm water camwt be traced into the hell of Bel'iug- S('a, lmt exist,; only in the 8hallow8, aml that it grows nq1idl.r cooler as wn pass northward, so tlrnt. <tt Point Beldwr we lian~, nuder or<linary circumstances, ouly the ordinar;\- Ard ii' Oel':m temperatures fur th1· partit-nlar season of the year. l e.ousi1ler, therefore, tl1at this tem1wrature of tlw w:1ter (like tlw l1igl1 rnidsmmuer temperature of tlw lower Yukon Valley) i8 a strietl,r lo<'al J>beuomenon, thougl1 it lt:i.-;, a.-; n-as obse1Ted in the Appendix I to tl1e Alaska Coast, l'ilot, as mucl1 eifoct upon the vit:iuity of its location while it lasts a8 if it had been gathered in the China Seas an<l transportetl thither. To descend to <il·tails, it is 8Upposablt~ that the rising tide and Yukon current, wheu not other· wise <li8tnrbetl, would 8trike the Asiatic coai<t after passing Saint Lawrenm· 18la,ntl, south autl west of Cap(J Chaplin, and a:,; far as <:hukotskoi X oss, and would be by that laud tume(l to the northeastward, thus produdng the notabJe current so otkn olJsen·ed just, off Cape Uhaplin, hut whose for<·e, as we ourseh·es ob8erved, does not extend Yery far from tJiat ·'ape. 'l'he main part of tlrn current uortherly through the strait is produeetl by tliat part of tbe tirle which hugs the shore of the prn1iusula north of Norton Sound, a;; hal'< been so mauy times obl'lerved. This run8 very strong oft Cape Prince of 'Vales, an<l follows the shore arouml into Kotzebue Sound, arnl reappears for a short distance with a Rtrong Ret off nearly eYery prominent headland on the American 8ide, such as Cape KrusenRtern, Point Hope, Ca1le LiRburue, etc., at each of which a spit formation drifted two wa,n; (b.Y the tl11x and reflux) is ohNerntble, either abcn-e or below water. On tbe Asiatie side the fal1iug tide rmihes with great force SE., past East Ca11e. As has been pointed out, the form of the land interferes with the exist-0nc<' of much current SW. from that promontory.

Bnt we know also that while the tendency of the fiow is g'l't'ater nortlnnml, it does uot tlow through uniformly in one 11irection, nor always with the highest rate obsernll; hence if we allow t1rnl hinls of the time for tl1e northerly flow, and assume that this is all at the highest rate, arnl tlmt 1101w of thl' warm water flows baek with the fole and that it loses no heat by rndiatiou into the atmosphere, we get as the probabk maximum of ice melted a percentage of three and fou1·.tentlis, e1pml to an area of 5,100 square geographical miles, 'Or a S·]tmrc 71.4 miles ou each side, or, roughl,,-, an area somewhat less than half that of Kotzebue Sound." This is, of course, when the other circumstances are considered, almost inappreciable, and leaves Uil to conclude that, under an,v circumstances at all probable, the amount of warm water which conlcl pasi< tl1e throat of the strait is so small that it would have practically no effect on the Ar.ctic basin into which it might entPr. It seem;; somewhat singular that no one has l1itherto computed the capabilities of the i-;trait with assnuwll data; for the publication of the figures would seem of itself to be sufficient to quench most of the theo. rics based upon the supposed· influx of warm water l1y this entrance. "-e may sn111 up the results of the investigation as follows: The Kuro Siwo compan·d with the Gulf Stream is cooler, hat'! a much smaller 1·olnme, and is suhject to serious fluctuations, which appear to be <lne to the monsoons. The Kuro Siwo ;;ends no recognizable branch northward, between the Aleutians antl Kamchatka, nor from any other direction into Bering Sea. The chief current of Bering Sea is a motion of cold water southward. This bas a superficial stratum ab<H"e it, which has, in summer when not interrupte<l by winds: a northel"l,r motion of translation, hut is not snfficfont, either in mass, motion, or consistency of direction, to be Pntitled to take rank as an ocean current. The surface cnrreutl'! of Bering Sea are formed by or chiefly dependent on tides, winds, river flows, the southerly motion of cold water, the distribution of floating ice, anll the northerly motion of' slightly warmer ;;nrface water, which are em~ctfre about in the order namecl. Xo warm current from Bering Sea enters Bering Strait., with the exception of water from the neigbhoring rh'ers or the TMljacent soun<ls. This water owes its heat directly to the local action of the stm's rays. The strait is incapable of carrying a current of warm water of sufficient magnitude tu han~ any marked effect on the comlition of the Polar ha.sin just north of it. ·
'Ice ha~ lie1·n frn1111ent.l~· n'port··d ashore in fo111teen fathoms water. Jt. is always aground on Herald 8lwal, where there are not le88 thau seven fathoms. The average height of the pack above the sea-le vol is from six to thirt~· feet., which is usually estimated as equal to one-seventh of its snhmerge·l ma88, bnt, is really somewhat ks.~. 8e.c sttbse!]uent foot-note. iJf the thickness here ussurued for the iee he con.,i1lerc1l l'XC<"S1<iYe, let it. be assu111e<l to lie only one-half that thickne88, or seven fathom~ thick, or one-qnarll·r of t,he content,; of the b11>1i11, \Vuich can hardly bu takeu exception to.

Ikfore the return of the Yukon party to headqnartt·rs, tl1e SnperiutemlPnt of the l'nite1l States Coast anil Geo1ldic Snrr<'y thonght he!'lt to puhlisl1 1 a portion of m~· preliminary re11ort ('Oiliaiui11g some of the generalizations drawn from the factis herein enumerated. As some time must neces1mrily elapise after our return h1·fore the data eouhl ::t· )Hthli>ihetl in tluc official f',onrse,-4t was thought best to publish a portion of the data liefore that time fo1· the information of h.ydrogmpl1ers, tlte >iuhject being of considerable interefit. Ry the authority of the Superintendent, and the kind concmTence of the distingui>ihcll editm·, Dr. E. Behm, a large part of the foregoing matter was macfo public in the chief geographical journal o!' l~urorw, l'etermann'1-1 l\littheilungen, in a German translation, accompa11ied hy a map and l'lf'ction.2 Since this was published, a number of interesting data haYc come to band, a f(·w of wl1iclt haYe been incorporated in tbe preceding text, wbile som<> of 11uite recent date find a place iu tl1iis note. It is beliernd that whether the conclusions reached hy me are considered wortl1y of adoption or not, at least the fact" collected show a sufficient deviation from the e-0mmonl.'- rPcefretl J1n)()thcsis to render the latter no longer acceptable without question by scientific li,nlrograpJ1ers. To the complacent ignorance wl1ich declinefl to be movetl hy any accession of knowledge this 1Iocnnwnt is not addres8ed, uor is it expected to find farnr among the few remaining enthmdaets who still cherish a belief in an open polar sea. Additional obsen:atiom in. th.e Arctic Sea.-On OctolJer 10, 1879, the whaleships l\fount ·wo!lm;. ton, Captain Nye, aml Vigilant, Captain Smithers, were l:18t seen h,\- Captain Banldry, of the Ilekn }\far, in latitude 71° 50', longitude 1 i3° 4:>', in a narrow channel of open water. The lll'len J\Iar barely escaped being frozen iu hy crowding all sail and forcing lier way through the rapidl,r forming new ice. In all human probability the two vessels which did not escnpe were froze11 iu theu aud there antl.uever got out of the pack. 1\fore than a month earlier the exploring steamer Jeannette, Lieutenant, De Long commamliug, was last seen (September 2, 1879) by Captain Barnes, of the whaler Sea Breeze, about 80 miles ;;onth of Herald falancl. The next day her smoke is reported to have lJecn 8Cen 50 or 60 111i!1~s farther north, but the accuracy of this observation rcmaius to he cstabfo;hed. In Novemher, 1880, one of the whale.ships came ashore on the norU1em Siberian coa.st in the ''iciuit.y of Ca.pe N urth (Swruoi), st-Ove, and only prevente1l from sinking by the kl~ which still cncircle,d her. Her c1·ew had tlisappeared, exce}lt a few who lay where they hall peri,.;l1l·d, aml it il'l probable that. the wreck was that of .the Vigilant. .Another wreck was reported hy uatiwR to have come ashore farther west on the same coast, hut this report does uot appt·ar to ham hce11 definitely confirmed.

'Ve do not know, of course, ·what had been tlw waialt·ri11gs of thi8 hulk l>ei'ln·c she was but tlie resnlta11t of her drift. for one yrar was about '.!00 miles in a southwest (true) direction. This is in accorrlance with the !lirection of the prern]eut winds (NE.) of this region, which, as has been preYious]~- pointe1l out, gon·rn the rnotio11 of the ict· mnd1 more than the currents; Jmt it is also eYident that 110 such overma:>tt'ring northerly cnrreut a:> has bt'en claimed for this region could have been experiencell b,Y this n·ssel. The Jeannette appears, from tlt1· fo\\- \ro1'ds ;ref tmusruittc<l from Irkutsk, to hare go11e i11lo tlw ice in the ,-iduit.r of \Yraugell falawl soon aftl'r slrn was last seen, a11Ll to haye drifted at tlw mercy of wind and tide, solidly beset, until the mhldle of June, 1881, "-hen, in latitude 770 autl longitude '.!O;~o, she was crushed and abandoned. 1 It iR uncertain whether she passed north or south of "'raugell l1<land; tl1e reRultaut oftlle whole drift in either case would have been about northwest .'iOO miles in twenty-one months-the rate not greatly differing from that of the Vigilant, and tile direction partly according with the more easterly winds prevailing iu the higher latitude traversed hy the Jea11nettc. 'l'his would also lw in accortlance with data as to currents about Herald Island, which are 11ercinbeforc mallc public. The prol>abilit.Y is that, as in the case of the Tegethoff, of the Polaris ice-party, and the floe-party of the second German Polar expedition, the rate and direction of her course rnried considerably from tinw to time, and her track, if platted, would show an cxtremcl,y irregular line. A fow additional observations ham come to hand at the lm.;t. moment, coutirmator~- of the po>1ilio11 herein taken that the intluencc of the tides is the most import;mt factor i11 determining the direction ot' tltc current in this part of tl.Je .Arctic Sea, aIHl slwwiug the t:wil of too hm-1ty gem~ral izatious. "A loug laue of open water, ('Xtending at least 100 miles northward from Herald Islaml, loo),. iug like an open river between the banks of ice, which was frozen to the ishallow lJottom. This 1:1trca.m sets northerly at about two knots." (John Muir, in New York Herald, October'.!:!, llIBl). "l\Ir. l\luir l:lays that off the eastern side of \Vrange!l 1.and, and e,-idently lying het1'1'een it aud another undiscovered shore, is, <luring the open season, an open lane of water leatliug to the 11orth as far as the eye can rpaclt, through which a cmrent flows stPadily north at the rate of 20 or :.!5 miles a day. This cmrent flows like a rh-er between two iee-honrnl hanks, the shore-ice on either :;ide appearing not to hase b1\en distmued for ~-cars, arnl possibly for ages. The coast-1ine of \Vnrngell l1and was visible as far as the e~·e could reach." (San :Francisco Bu1Ietin, Octollcr 21, 1881 ). "The floe outside of us (the Corwin, when at w·raugell Land) was drifting along shore to the northeast with a powerful current, at a speed of 50 miles a day, the majestic movement being made strikingl,r nianifost by large bergs that 1n~re aground in water 60 feet deep, standing like islamls, while the main mass of t.lm 1iack went grating past them.'' (John ~Iuir, letter of August 17, 1881, in San Francisco Weekly Bulletin of October :w, 1881 ). In the same letter, the writer speaks of ice a hunure<l feet thick near Wrangell Islaml "The ice (near Point Barrow) is of tremendous thickness, 100 feet or more.'' (Same, in letter of August 18, 1881, same paper.) The preceding obsen·ations were made and published before it was known that 'Vrangell I,and was a compamti\·cly small is laud, aml the danger of drawi11g generalizations from too Jim ited experience is. illustrated hy a comparison of them with the following notes of investigatioms by Lieut. Uobt. BeITy, U. S. X., commaudiug the U. S. S. Rodgers, a little later in the same season: "Ensign Hunt's 11arty were · · · instructed to encircle the island if possible, for be (Lieutenant Berry) felt pretty certain of its insular character since making our observations from Herald Island of the variable changes of currents an<l ice," &c. "Your eorresponllcnt says it was surprising to see the ice moving constantly to westward along the shore. · · · These rapid changes arc most confnRing to navigators," &c. (New York Herald, November 8, 1881. Also re11cated by Doctor lfosse in letter of September 121 New York Ilerald of November 18, 1881). "After cruising along the pack · · · we stcame1l toward Herald _Island for the purpose of making obseivations upon the cnrrent rnportell to flow in a northwesterly direction · · ·.

Of the 6-knot nortlnresterly current disco>ered (according- to statement of Captain .Jacohson, lmhlishPd in New York Herald of No\·ember 5, 1881), hy Lieutenant Herr)·, near 'Vnmgrll Land. nothing is saitl (of any such current) in his otticial report, and the statemc>11t doubtless armw from some misapprehension. As an instance of anomalies of temperature met with in the shallows of the seas of this regio11, the following extract from a letter of the Ifrrald correspondent on the Corwin, datPd Septemller 7, 1881, and published in the Herald of Non"m her :..:i, 181'il~ is of interest, "SonH· anomalies in the kmperature of tl1e water were notiCP(l; for instance, near Hnaltl falalHl, on July 30 it was 4SC-' (at the surface) and 4!)0 at tl1e bottom. A few days later, off the SilJerian coast, 100 miles southward, it measured 370, while later, in Bering Sea, over .600 mih,s to the southward, it frll to 3;;0, Similar olise1Tatious lta\e lJeeu made b,'\ seYt'ral nayigators. The following remarks by Captain Fisher, of the Sea Breeze (Dail~- Alta Ualiforuia, San J?raucisco, September 28, 1881), ha-ve had a somewhat externled publication, and may be comparPd with the preYiousJ~· mentioned detail!; extractetl from the "remark-books'' of sewral whale sl1ips, which relate to obseITations made and recorded at tlrn time of occurrence, an<l with the conclusions of Liitke anu Kellett. "All summer long n strong cnrrrnt sweeps northward through tlds (Bering-) Strait, and it is only in September or October that sh'ong northerly winds affect it. I, myself. have been swept many miles northward in October. · · · Oft' Point Barrow a 3 or 4 knot c111·rent sets regularly along the laud northea8twar1l, which does uot t>xte11d 50 miles off shm·c. ln 187:! the Sea Breeze, while becalmed, drifted 20 miles off shore, entirely out of !light." It is needless to obsene that Captain Fisher llPYer 1;pe11t ''all 1;u111mer long'' in the strait, nor is it probabfo that he ever spent twenty-four consecutive hours in the same spot in the strait Don ht less lie has obsened on '·arious occasions a current similar to that experienced b,Y many otl1(·r nadgators in the strait. and at Point Barrow, bat there h; no doubt that he has oYerestimated tlw rate at tln' lattl'r point, arnl that his conclusions as to the regularity at both places are based 011 insufficient eyidence. In thi:-;, as in man~· other cases, when ohservations are recorded b.r pt'rsons tmfarniliar with tlw need of exactitude in such matters, it is probable that currents were noticP1l only when tlwy forced themsPlves on the navigator',.; attention b~- interfering materiall~- with llis reckoning or progress, while the (for our purposes) Pqnall.r important, but feebler, eounter curre11ts passed witlwut notice. I have called attention to tlie circumstanceR of this Jlarticular ;;;tale· ment, not because it is more remarkable or more erroneous than man~- otlters, but because upou it and similar slipshod statements persons unfamiliar with the suh,iect have seen fit to base disquisitions on the currents of Bering Strait, aml to call in question the result of olJservations, which, however limited their scope, were made with care, and an· entitled, so far as they go, to thP confidence and 1lne consideration of 11ydrogrnphers. The following extracts from the report. of l\Ir. Marcus Baker, astronomer of the lluiteil States Coast and Geodetic Survey party on the U. S. S. Yukon, unuer my charge, will gfre a fair itlea oi the value of the determination, and the manner in which it was made. The full aeconnt, hr permission of the Superintendent of the Survey, was puLlished in the Bulletin of thl' Philosophical Society of Washington, vol. IV, pp. 1:!3-133, 1881, with a map. As noted imwiousJ,,-, the longitude of the maps aecompanying the article in the American ,Journal of Sl'iPIH'f', a111l that in Pd('rmaun's ::Uitthcilungen, was necessarily dependent upon the results b,y one chrononwter, the computatious not being finished then, and therefore requires a plus correction of ahont 11 w1·sterly: Bot1ntlaru liti.e betweett the terriwry of tlte United States and of Russia, pas,~ing tlmncglt Bel'ing Strait.

In t li<' ('UI'<' of the two determinations marked with a · the two Diometl<' Islands are Ro rPJHC· seutPd 011 the chart ti.tat the boundary Iiue is tangent to each island. During the 1mrnmcr of lSSO an attempt was made by the party on board the Unitetl States Coast nllll Cleo<letfr SnrYey schooner Yukon to make a mor:e careful determination of the longitude or this meridian than bad been attempted hitherto. For longitude purposes the party had one pocket an<l six box cbronometen1. For determining time the sextant wits used, r!'conrse heing hatl to (·11ual altitudes wbeneYer possible. Plover Hay iu Eastern Siberia is about lGO miles to the southward atl(l westward from the Hionwde Jslamls in Bering Strait. This bay was visited by Prof. Asaph Hall, of the Fnited States Narnl Ol>serratory, in J809, for tl1e J>nrpose of observing the total solar eclipse of that ,re:1r, :111d, in connection with the eclipse work, Professor Hall ma<le a careful determination of the longi· tmlt· of bis station. After a careful examination of all the longitude determinations known to <>xist, aml l1ecausc th{· facilities for determining the longitude of this place by the Yukon party W(·re not sufficient to im1irove upon the determination by J>rofessor Hall, his results have b('{'n adopted, and the longitude of the boundary meridian 111a1lc to depend npon his determina· tion. · · · Previous to 1818, Plover Bay, ti.tough an extensive arm of' the sea running inlancl some 20 to 25 miles, appPars not to have been known. It is not shown npon any map before 1850. In thP period from 1845 to 18-18 it seems t-0 haYe been Yisitetl by the whalers. The first information touch· iug it upon which we can lay our hamls is the report of CommancleY Moore to the Admfralty, 1rnblishetl in the Nautical Magazine, Marcli: 18a0. l?rom thi8 it appears that Uommander Moore first anchored in PloYer Ba;\· October 11, 1848. I,ater.he moved his vessel, the Plover, farther iu, ancl winten·d in the lrnrbor named b,v him :Brnma HarLor. He remaine1l in Emma Harbor until Jnne 2J, 18..!!l. C'ouceruing the scientific or snne;yiug work accomplished in this i)eriod of eight months he says: "At interrnls Mr. Martin, assiste1l by J\lr. Hooper, made a survey of the plaee in wl1ich I had secured the ship for the winter; which, connected with :Mr. Martin's aml my own obserrn· tions on the coast to the westward, will, I l1ope, gfrc a tolerably correct representation of these shores, and when associated witlt magnetic obs<·r,·ation~ on e\·ery attainable point, will, I trust., meet their lordships' approbatiou."

From the e11ual altitudes, the time of local mean noon b~· tlie chrouomet<"r was Uh 18m 13.!I·, and from the double altitmles it was llh ism 14.2·, a very satisfactory agreement.

THE CO:\TACT-SLIDE BASE APPAUATCS USED IN TIIE COAST

AND GEODETIC Slill\'EY.
By J. E. HILGARD, Assistant.

'.l'hc Coast Survey He ports for 185R, 1857, and 1870 contain acconnts of a base measnri11 g· apparatus, designed h;\- Assistant J. E. Hilgard and .l\Ir. ,Joseph Saxton, in consultation with Superintendent Bache, and intended originally for \YOrk of se1:0111lary accuracy. The results obtained by its use in the fiPl<l haw surpassed the expectations entertained of irs merits, and h::we shown that the degree of cxn,ctness of distances measured with it is as gmat as can be maintained in any system of triangulation has<'<l upon them. In illnstrntion, t.!ic rPccnt measurement made with liars of this constrnetion, hut G mcter:s iu lPllgth, hy AssiRta11t O. II. Tittmann, of the "El Paso" base, Color.Hlo, ma;r lm citf'<L The base line, 11.3 kilometers long-, was measured twice, in opposite directions, in t\wnty-thrC'C' working rla~-s. It, was diYidml iuto fifry-fonr i,;ections, and from compnrisons hdween the two 111Pasures of each section a probable error of less than ffre millimeters has hPell tfodnced for t!Jc wl1ole length of the !Ja~e line, as that due to tbe uncertainty of nwmmri11g only. Taki11g iuto account a1so the uncertainty of the temperature COITectiou, the probable error assigned to the leugtL of the base is 1G.5mrn. As showing the capacity of Uie apparatus to oyercome grndcs, it ma:y be mentioned that the ditl'erence of elerntion between tl.te termini of this base is 172 meters. The apparatus consists of two measuring bars 4 meters long·, exact]~- alike, supported on trestles. The measurement is made by bringing these bars successiYely into contact. Tliis 1s effecte<l by means of a continuous screw motion, autl defined by the coincidence of lines on the ro<l and contact-slide. The simplicity, ease, and rapidity of this morle of making the contact left nothing to be desired, and was found to introduce much smaller errors tlian were caused by our imperfect knowledge of the temperature of the hars on which their absolute length depends. Ju the form of the apparatus hitherto used, the temperature was at first indicatl'd by a ml'rc11rial thermometer, the bulh of which touched the rod, let into the wood encasing the latter, on one side of the bar. Afterwards another thermometer was inserted on the oppm;ite side, hut it was found that the indications of the two differed considerably, particularly in the early part of the day, and when the direction of the measurement was such that the sun shonu on one side of the apparatus only. In order to make our knowledge of the absolute lengths of the bars conform more nearly to the measuring power of the ap1laratus, it was decided hJ· Assistant Hilgard to combine the measuring rod with two zinc tubes, one on each side of the rod, into a metallic differential thermometer. It is the object of this paper tu show how this has been aceomplishecl without materiallr increasing the weight _of the apparatus, and to give an account of a new device fur ali~ning the bars and to describe the apparatus as now perfected by him. Originally a bar carried at each of its ends an aligning pin, and it was intended that the alignment should be made by s~·hting with the eye along the pins, but this method was found insufficient because the two bars were not always at the same inclination, uor were they nearl;y enough level when placed on the trestles to insure the verticality of the pins. It was, therefore, customary to station an obsernr behind a theodolite mounted in the line of measurement, at a. convenient distance in front or behind the bars. To simplify the procedure, a small aligning telescope has been attached to the forward en<l of the bar. The accompanying plate shows tlw 1letails of the a1iparatus.

342

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

Fig. 1 shows a cross-section of one of the 4-meter bars. The wooden bar is 8 centimeters wide and 14 centimeters deep, and is composml of two pieces firml~- held together by loug screws passing from the top through the upper piece into the lower. Encased in this bar is a brass frame calTying tltree rollers, on the central one of which rests the steel rod, whinh is 8mm in <liamet,er. On each side is seen a zinc tube !),5mm in diameter. A brass plate extends across.the rod and tubes, holding them in place, but not in contact with them. The rod and tubes are supported throughout their length on 8imilar systems of rollers, at distances apart of about om.34, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 2 shows the rear bar on the left in contact with the forward bar on the right. It should be borne in mind that what will be said about the forward or rear end of one bar, applies equally to the corresponding ends of the other, as they are exactly alike in construction. In the figure the tops of the wooden bars have been taken oft' to show the details of the arrangement of the rod and tubes. Looking at the rear eml of the forward bar we see one of the zinc tnl.Jes soldered to the rod, as indicated by the discontinuation of the broken lines on the millimeter scale. This scale is screwed to the united end of the tube and the rod. The other zinc tube is left free to cxpaud at this end, and carries a vernier corresponding to the scale· .At the other end of the bar the arrangement is reversed, as shown on the left at the forward end of the rear har. To avoid a vertical disphcement of the vernier and scale plates, they are held in place by a bridle fastened to the vernier and overlying the scale, and carrying a spring which presses the latter against the former. The upper portion of the har is perforated from two sides, and the perforations are cl9sed by lenses having their foci in the plane of the scales. By this convenient arrangement one of the lenses concentrates light on the graduation, while it may be read through the other. This arrangement is not shown in detail in the drawing, but the position of the lenses is shown in Fig. 5 by the little squares, near the ends of the bars. It ueed hardly be explained that the absolute length of the bar must be determined for any particular reading of the scales by comparison with a standard, and that the difference in the coefficients of expansion of the steel rods and tite zinc tubes will cause different scale readings, for differences of length due to changes of temperature. A mercurial thermometer is retained near the middle of the bar, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, for comparisons of the bar with the standard. The thermometer can be read while it remains in position, by merely withdrawing a wooden slide which co-vers it. The tubular form was chosen for the zinc because of the inelasticity and brittleness of that metal. "re re\'ert to the figure. The rod and tubes fixedly united are movable lengthwise on the rollers by means of a milled head nut, working in threads cut on the steel rod which passes through a circular opening in the brass plate screwed to the wooden bar, and against which the nut presses. This motion is counteracted by two strong springs at the forward end of the bar, which are fastened at one end to the wood and at the other to a cross-piece which is firmly clamped to the rod, and by means of which the tension of the springs can be regulated. To prevent the twisting of the rod when the milled nut is turned, a brass piece is clamped to the rod and slides horizontally on two guide plates. The amount by which the rod may be screwed in or out is limited by four srops on the guide plates, between which the cross-piece slides, as shown in the figure. The rear encl of each rod carries the contact-slide, which has on its extremit.y an agate with a horizontal knife-edge. The contact-slide is a short tube which slides over the end of the rod and is pushed outward hy means of a spiral spring, rather more than sufficient to overcome its friction (see Fig. 3). .A slot in the tube shows au index plate with a line ruled on it, fastened ro the rod. The coincidence of these lines defines that po8ition of the slide in which the knife-edge is at a known distance from the plane of the agate at the other end of the rod. This plane agate i8 shown in the figure as the abutting surface of the rear bar. The contact-slide and rod are perforated with a small hole and supplied with a pin, not shown in the drawing, by means of which the guide lines can be fixed at coincidence for the purpose of making comparisons with the standard bar, or of transferring a point on the ground to the end of the bar.

When the whole bar is nice!:;· adjush~d on trm;tles or stands in elevation and alignment, aml within a few millimeters in distance eitlier way, the exact adjustment i;; effected hy turning the milled head nut which slitles tlw rotl within the bar until the lines on the index plate all(l contactslide coincide; the knife-edge on the latter abutting meanwhile a,gainst the agate Rurface plane ot' the preceding bar, which suffers no pressure, exr,ept that due to the small spiral spring within the abutting-slide. In judging of the coincidence of lineR, a magnifier is made use of, which can be carried by the operator or be attached to the bar, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows the general appearance of the bar when on the trestles. Tlie bar is pain tetl a hlaish gray color, and has on it a designating umneral (not shown in the drawing). Two black bands a.re painted on it at a distance of one-fourth of the length of the bar from each. end, to show where it should be supported by tlic trestles. The level sector is also shown. By its means tile bar is made horizontal, or it-. incli1rntion can be read off on its scale, whieh is graduated to minutes. On the forward ernl the aligning telescope is shown, a side and front yiew of which is gi\·en lJy Figs. 6 and 7. The telescopro rests in wyes, in wl1ich it is rnYersible, and is mounted on a stiff Rpring, oue eutl of which is 1ixB4 to tlH~ bar, the other to a tangent screw, by meaus of which the axis of the telescope can be made horizontal, as indicated by a small Jeye] ciirried between the wye standards. As the bar is made very nearly horizontal IJy means of the level on the trestles, the ecccntrieity of the t.elescope caused by the final a(ljustment with tlte t<ingent screw i8 hllt au insignificant quantity. Fig. 8 shows the trestle. On :i. tripod stand witll douhle legs of the ustlal construction is screwed a frame cnrrying two upright guides for the two w-oocleu eross-l:!lides, Rhown in the drawing as sepan1ted by a wedge,, Ea.ch cross-slide is composed of two pieces of -wood, on opposite sides of the guides, held together b~- a clamp at each end, by means of which it can be fi.xed at any elevation on the guides. A sp1·i11g, whieli reacts ngainst the clamps, is introduced between the two pieces of wood and throwi:; them apart when the clamping screws arc looseuet1, to admit of an easy vertical mo,·ement along tl!e guides. For this purpose, fnrthermore, friction roller,,; are inserted in the ends of the crosR-slides mo\·ing between the guides. The design secures an cai;;y mo\·eme11t under all changes of heat and moisture. Tile parallelism of the two cross-slides is insured b~- their contact with the wcd~e, and their horizontal position is indicated by a small level affixc(l t-0 either the lower or, as in this instance, to the upper slide. "\Yhen the lower ont1 is fixed and the wetlgc in its :ffemge position between them, the upper one can be moved about 2 centimeters up or down parallel to tlie lower. An equable motion witlioutjarring and with certain bearing is secured for the wedge by causing it t-0 move between friction rollers. As the wedge moves with great ease on the rollers and];:; liable to fiy out when under the pressure of the, bttr, fiat spring is introduced betwoon the sidP of the wedge and the side of the cross-slide, which presses tile wedge against the guides aud cunses a uniform friction independent of the weight of the bar. The trestles are alike in construction, with the exception that the upper slide of the trestl1· intended for the forward end of the bar carries a, roller on which the bar rests, w-liile the otiler ha;; a fixed semi-cylindrical surface for tbe support of the bar. Befort\ beginning the measurement of a base line the itligning- telescope shoulll bB co1lirnatcll, the milled head nut giving the sliding motion to the rocll'! in the bars should be put at its mean position, and the level of the sector should be adjnsted to the zero of the arc wben the bar is horizontal. This is done by putting the bars on the trestles, and bringing the kuife-edge at oue eud and the middle of the agate at the other, into a horizontn,l plane described hy a leveling i11strurnent or theodolite, set up equidistant from the two ends of the bar. As thiR adjustmpnt i8 liable to a slight derangement, during mea,mrements, it is eustomary to test it at tbe end as well as at, the beginning of a day's work, and when such a derangement has occurred its ttmount as shown liy the arc must he recorded and a correction ap]llied to the ohscn'c<l inclinations. In making the measurement, the hars being- four metNs in h·11gth, tllf' Rtawls are srt up at distancel'l of two meters, each bar being snpporte1l at 011e fonrt 11 it~ lc11gt Ii frolil thr PJHh:, :t>' iwlicated hy the black hin1ds.

H,EPORT OF THE

SUPEBINTENDE~T

OF THE

The tripod legs are so placed tliat one of each stand is in the direction of the line towards the milllllc of the bar. The height of tlle ;;tands is approximately adjust£d b,\· the spreading of the legs. The proper distance for the stands is ascertained by a light rod of two meters laitl on the ground. The wedge is placell at its midway position, between tLe two cross-slides, which are clamped at a suitable height. This is ascertained by sighting across the tops of the slides to a bar already in })Osition. At the same time they are kept horizontal by means of the attadied level, which should be kept on the forward si1k, so as to be undt'r the eye of the person adjusting the height. The bar is next placed on the trm::tles in approximate alignment, for which the space between the uprights makes ample allowance, if the stauds are set with moderate care. n· is then adjusted in elevation by means of the wedges, and t·itl1er placed level or at a slight inclination, which is read on the sector scale. The alignment is now perfected hy means of the telescope on the top of the bar. The liar is Rhifted hy hand, as it is in no way clamped to its support, its weight heing sufficient to insure stability. At the Rame time its distance in reference to the preceding bar is.adjusted to tl!e range of the screw motion. In launching the hars backward or forward by hand, the operator should lift the contact end slightly off the trestle, while the assistant at the forward end, with his hand placed under the har, merely takes some of the weight of the bar off the trestle, leaving the operator free move it either -way, in whiel1 he ma~· be assiste1l hr a slight swinging mornment of the hand. \Vhile it is alwa,ys preferalile to use the hars nearly level, consideraule irregularities in the ground may be overcome b.Y rneaus of the trestles. A verti\_:al offset with a theorlolite may he i·csorted to in overcoming a sudden chn11~e of grade in preference to using the bars at a considerable inclination. 'fhe apparatus is prm·i<lPd with tliree vairs of stands, cme of.which is alwa,Ys ke1)t in position in advance of the two which support the bms. Two men are required to carry forward the trestles to set them and to adjust the cross.slides approximately. Two others are required to carry forward the bars and to assist the operator who makes the contact in manipulating the har for its nice adjustment. Two more for carrying forward tools and other appliances and nec1·somries, and a recorder whose dut.Y includes check readings of the temperature scale and sector arc. It is requisite that a standard shonltl accompany the hars into the field for the purpose of making comparisons between the former aucl the latter, since the scale readings depend, aside from the changes due to temperature, on the unalterable relation between the zinc and steel, and it is desirable to verify this frequently. A series of comparisonR between the standard and the measuriug bars will then enable the computer to arrange a table in which the absolute length of the hars corresponding to the ohsen·ed scale readiug-s will he gh·en irrespective of our knowledge of the tempemture of the h11rs. The knowledge of the length of the standard, liowever, de1rnnds on the iwlications of men·urial thcrmometerR, but the time and circumstances under which the comparisons are 1mule may !Jc so chosen as to afford very much more favorahle conditions, as regards stabUit.1J of teiuperature, than could be expected during the measurement of a base-line. The mercurial thermometer retained in the measuring bars should, however, l.Je rea,(l not only as a check against gross mbreadings of the scales against which the fact that two scales must ue read already provides, but also to complete the record by furnishing information in regard to the vary iug temperatures of the day. The scale rl:'adings should be recorded at equal intervals of time, or if the measurement is pl'ogn:ssing at a nearly uniform rate of spee1l, for, say, e\-ery ten bars. But the frequency should d<·pernl 011 the rate at which the smile readings change as shown b,Y the record. A form of record is appended.

INTRODL"CTJON.

The <liSCO\('ry of America by Christopher Colnmbns is, perhaps, the most important e\-ent recorded in secular history. Aucient philosophers had suggested the spltericity of the earth, the zone of water, and the theoretical possibility of reaching the Indies by sailing west; and Colmnbus recalled these suggestions before the great councils that ridiculed and rejected his proposal. The art of navigation is as old as civilization, and the practice of it must have begun when bartering commenced. Its early development in .European waters was, probitbly, in the eastern part of the l\le!literraneau, witlJ open boats, such as Homer mentions. Vessels of this character coul<l not make a commercial nation like that which throye in Pluenicia. Therefore we find that her ships were large and that tbcy msed both sails and oars.(1) More than three thousand years ago the sailor:s of this little state had passed ont of' the Mediterranean, had founded Oadiz, aud were trafficking aloug the Atlantic shores of Europe aml Africa. The maritime spirit of the l'hrenicians descended upon the Oarthagenians, the Italians, and the Portuguese. The last named began that golden age of' geographical discovery which characterized the fifteenth century. All navigators antecedent to Columbus followed the same way in sea.rcl1i11g for new countries. They crept along the shores of contiguous lands making no disco\Teries beyond unless by chance, through the stress of storms, or by the letting loose of birds. The Vikings tribe of Xorway were an exception. The area of sheltered fior«ls in their fretted coast exceeds all the arable land in the country. Hardy ventureSQme seamen grew here from the law of enYironment, a11d their Yessels also were evolvt·d in a tempestuous ocean and by means of a business very clifferent from trade. In shape these resembled the present whale-l>oats,( 2 ) which are proved to be tJrn best type for rough seas. A well-preserved Rpecimen, supposed to have been made about the tenth century, was dug out of a tumulus at Gl·g·stad, :Sorway, in the epring of 1880.(3) It is 72 feet long, 17_ wide, and it probably drew 5 feet of' water. There are twenty benches for rowers. Near the middle is a wooden step for a mast, and indications that this might have been lowered at will. The vessels of the Northmen were ob\·iously good sea-boats and from their light draft and the alternative of oars, they must ham been ,-ery handy in the neighborhood of laml, but under canvas they could make no headway unless hy ''sailing large." The Phrenician:s nsctl the Pole Star in navigating and the ancient mariners of Ceylon regulated their track throngh the ocean by observing the flight of the birds which they set free at intervals.(') In this modr, anll also from being force'1 to scud iit gales, the Nortlnnen extentlml

Tliere is a sequence of larnl across, which points out tile suecessi\-e step;; they took. 'West 180 miles from Norwa,y, are the Slletlan!ls; thence west-northwest 110, to the F<ll'Ot»"; :!!O miles farther, on the same course, lies keland; and uortl1wcsterly, lG.'.i more, i:-; GrePularnl. Tlw louge8t distance is from thi:-; to Labrador, 500 miles, whence the coast-line is continuous. It is indisputalJle that the Xorthmen were tlw a l.Jlest seamen and boldest mwigaton; of ancient times; but tliey were neitlwr traders nor colouizers. 'l'he lands which they rliscm·ere(l in the west were supposed to be an extension of the :European Continent. They derh·ed no advantage from them, neither did the world. In the graceful language of \Vashi11gto11 Irvi11g, "If the :!'lorsemen saw the New vYorld, it was but a trausieut glimpse, leadi11g to no certai11 or permanent knowledge, and in a little time lost again to mankin<l.(I) Columbus was an efficient seaman and he was also a religious enthusiast-a rare combination. In his correspondence with Toscanelli, in HI±, is tile first meution of his decision to seek the Indies by sailing west. Three yeitrs afterwards he Yisitetl the northern regions, foelaml probably, where he must ha\"e found the tradition of we:-;tcm discoveries, although the secret of the Sagas was not published until the last half of the sixtec>nth centm'.'"· \Vhatever he learued there had no influence upon his preYions resolution. He did iwt propose to hnut after the lands which the Northmen had discarded. Hi.;; purpose was to open a wa,v, hy water, to the rich anll llOpulous countries spoken of hy Marco Polo, for this was linked in his mind with the propagation of the Uhristian faith and tl1r re;;;c1ie of the HoJ,,- Sepulcher from the Infideh:. Everything essential to such a Yoyage had been ready for a long time throug·h the growth of navigation. In the iire\'ious centnr.r, Edward III, of England, had good, stout sailing ships and plenty of seamen. The marinl'r's compass was iu use as early as 1100-1'.!-iO A. D.(2) Latitude hy ohsef\'atfon vrns familiar to sailor.;; (see Appendix D) and dea1l reckoning of some kind llad always been practiced. Parallels aml meridians \Tere applied in the second century. Columlms himself made maps, and globes are mentioned in his jourual. 'l'his plan, and the re1tsoning hy which }re 1mpported it, seem clear enough nO\Y; hut th·eu e>ery council n;jected it. In his lettfc'r to the King :tnd Queen of Spain, narrating hi.;; fourth vosage, the Admiral wrote: ';For se,-en _years was I at your royal court, where c\-er,r one to whom tl1e enterprise was mentione1l treated it as ridiculous; but now there is not a man, down to the Yery tailors, who does not beg to be allowed to become a discoverer."(3) Bis first proposal was to the Ki11g of Portugal, to steer west from Usbou. Tl1i1< would hare taken him to Anwrica, at a Jioiut fh-e miles south of Capp Henlopeu; dista11cP, 8,0!J5 miles. Japan is 9,801 miles west from Lisbon; but along the great circle, which goes through Em·o1)e and Siberia, it is only 5,168 miles. · Columbus giYes no rea8on for i::-oiug t.o the Canar,r Islands to take his final departure. lrYing i:;ays it was the damaged state of the Piuta'" rudder that led him to go there to exchange it;(') bnt on the Yer.r day lie sailed from Spain, August 3, lJ02, lie entere<l in lris journal that he was steering for the Canaries,( 5 ) arnl the mislrnp to the J>inta was not till tlie uth of Augu.;;t.( 6 ) l'tlartm Behem's gloue aml Toscanelli's map agreed in placing Ci pan go (Japan) due \H'st from the Camtries.

Jn hii-; first log across the Atlantic, he likened the weather to that of Andalusia in April. It hi.eked 11othi11g1 he said, except the soug;; of the 11ightingales.

In recent years small boats from the l;uited States have anive<l safe in .England, in spite -0f bad weather and faulty obt'ernition1'. The unfolding of physieal laws has dissipated the artificial terrors of the ocean; bnt in the time of Columbus superstition and ignorance l:roolkd there, makiug it trul,Y a'' sea of darkness," whwh the imagination only ha<l pierced. 'l'lw world is not in de ht eel to the wisdom of the learned for the en>ntfnl voyage that opened the oceans to commerce, and continents to trade and settlement. To Columbus belongs the merit of this inestnnable boon. lie i11spired the wise and go()(l Queen Isabella(1) eqnall~· with the bumble sailors of Palos to put their trnt-1t in his seheme. He was as persistent in maintaining it through the rnbnffs of eighteen ;years as he was ste;ulfasL in holding to his predetermined course across the Atlantic. It takes not a jot from the glm·.r of liis discover.)· that he underestimated the size of the earth; or that he died in ignorance of the transcendent importance of his deed; or that the N orthrnen had preceded him. The fulfilment of his design, to steer west until he reached the Indies or found intervening land, was thti triumph of human reasoning; it was the soul's work, into which neither chance nor the fickle winds intruded. The aim of this monograph is to try to solve the problem of the first landing-place of Columbus iu the New 'Vorld. It is founded, as all others are, upon Las Casas's (abridged) copy of the "log-book'', or journal, of Columbus. Xothing has been raked from the arcana of the past to impeach this; and it will continue to be used until the original journal is produced or this copy is shown to be F>purious. It is manifest th;1t no landfall, or track, can stand which is supported by assertions tl1at are in OJ>position to Las Casas's narrative. Knowing this to l>e true I have tested in the following pages every track, by placing paragra1>hs from each author and from the journal in juxtaposition so that any one, with the help of the correct appendix chart, shall discern the contradictions. The selection of a new landfall, aud track through the Bahamas, different from all hitherto ascribed to Uolmnbns, is the natural result of this sifting. The track which I l1ave laid down was chosen because it appears to be the only one that can be made to fit the courses, distances, and descriptions in the log-book. · " 'ASIIINGTO:N", D.

He considers that the itlentifieation of ,the.i<l' four, as well as the other six, innikes the whole question of the landfall, and he is so .certain of it tllat he puts Senhor de Yar11liage11 ''out of court·, (p. 208), because his ~larignana appears on the old maps u:it11 Gnanabani · .Major does not furnish the eYideuce to enable us to see that (~nanalmui is \Yatling. He refers to Herrera's map of HHH, with the expectation that we shall be as easiI~· satisfied a>; he was. Looking at this map I notice three little islauds marked triangula, and northwest of them is Guauahani.

This i1> remarkable, as showing a eo1111c1·!ioll lwtwr~en them at au early date. A great part of the mapR of the sixteenth arnl sc,·euteenth centuries haYe Gnanima and :Mayag-n:rna as outside islamls, with Gnanahnui l,\·ing between; antl inside of these is place(l Sarnana. Triangulo or triango appears, but not so othm. All thi10 indkates tliat the information tmusmittell to tlH· early map-makers ineltvled th<· fact that Gnauahani or San Sah·ador was an island distinct from !l:mmima fCat), l\fa,ragnaua plnrignana], Tria11gulo [Watling], and Sa1mrna.

The Yalnable map of La Co,..a, \Yhielt I shall remark upon, fixed the position of Guanahani aliout the middle of the nortlieast sitle of the Bahamas. Herrera and otlins copy it.

About 1790, :Xa·rnrrell·, a civil ofii<'er of the marine department of Sp[1iu, found in the archives of the Duke del lnf'antatlo a rnaunseript narrative of the first nJyagP of Columbus, ahri1lgecl from tlw original. It proYed to he in tlte hamhuiting of Bislrnp Las Casas, a contemporary and companion of Columbus, who had dsited the new world sercrnl times. He wrote a general history of the In<lies, in three volumes, from the <liscovery in 14.92 to 1520, which exists 011ly in manuscript, hnt it hm1 been, and is, acMs;,;ible to scholars. Las Casm:: was engaged u11on tllii.; history from 1527 to 155H, arnl he had before him the original journals of Colnmbus, his map of the first discovery, and uum~- letters aurl clomuneuts, now lm-;t. In the year 1825 the Spani:.;h Government publi~hed this precious narratire, together with othei; valuable papers relating to Columbus. It is a matter of Rincere regTd tl1at I.as Casas abridged, in any degTee, the'' log-book" of such an eventful voyage, hut we are thankful that lte transcribed Columbus's words literally, from the hmtlfall at Guan~hani to Urn '.!t)tlt of (ktober, becmum it is this part only that is essential to proye the true landing-place.

I sent the ship's lJoat to the shore for water, and they willingly showed my men where the water was aml they themselves brought the casks filled to the boat, and were yerr glad to be able to oblige us. This island is exceedingly large and I have determined to go around it, because as I can nnderstaud on it or near it, there is a mine of gold. This island lies at a distance from that of Santa :Maria of eigllt leagues almost east [and] west; aud this cape to which I have come, and all this coast, runt-i north·northwcst and south-southeast, and I saw fully twent,y leagues of it, bnt this was not the ernl. Soon after writing tltis I set sail witlt a south wind, inteudi11g to go around the whole island, and work until I should find Sainaot, which is tlw ii;;land or eity where the gold is, as all tlwse say wlw have come with us iu tlie ships, and as was bpfore asserted by those of the island of Sau Salvador and Santa l\Iaria. The people here are like those of tl!e said i.slamls, and speak the same language and have the same customs, but these look to me as somewhat more gentle, of better manners, and of keener intelligence, for I notice that in bartering cotton and other little things they knoiv how to trade, which the others neYer dicl; ancl also on this island I saw cotton cloth made like mantles, and the people more intelligent, and the women wear in front a small piece of cotton stuff which scarcely covers what decency requires. The island is ver,v green level and exceedingly fertile, and I donbt not that they sow aud gather paui,,,o( 1} and all other things, at all seasons of the year; and I saw many tre,es whose shape was very different from ours, and many of them which had brancbes of many kinds although growing from one trunk, and one branch is of one kind an(l another of another kind, and so different that the diversity of the kinds is the greatest wonder of the world, for instance, one branch bad leaves like those of ca.ue and another like those of a mastic; and thus on a Ringle tree

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERIN'rENDENT OF TIIE and was to the other: so I sailed to the nortllnorth west, and when I was near the end of the island, two leagues off, I found a very marvellous port with an entrance, altlwugh it may be said that there are two entrances, because it bas a rocky islet in the middle, and both are very narrow, but within it there is ample room for one hundred ships, if it bad sufficient depth of water, and was clear, and had also a deep entrance: I thought it worth while to examine and sound it, and so I anchored outside of jt,, and went in with all the boats of the ships, and saw that there was not bottom. Aud because I thought when I saw it that it was the mouth of some river I had the casks sent on shore for water, and on shore I fountl eight or ten men who soon approa-0hed us, and showed us the village near by, to which I sent my men for water, some armed, and others with the casks, and thus they got it; and because it was rather far I was detained for the space of two homs. During this time I walked among those trees, which were the most beautiful things that were ever seen; so much verdure being visible and in as high a degree as in the month of l\fay in Andalncia, and all these trees as different from ours as day is from night; the same was the case with the fruits, grass stones and all things. It is true that some trees were of the same family as others in Castile, however there was a very great difference, and the other trees of other kinds were so many that there is no person that can compare them to others in Castile. The people were all like those aforementioned, they have the same dispositions, go about naked and are of tbe same size, and gave of what they had for anything that was given to them ; and here I saw that some young men of the vessels obtained spears from them for some little pieces of broken crockery and glass, the men I sent for water told us that the houses which they had entered were well swept and perfectly clean, and that their be<ls and coverings looked like cotton nets:( 1) the houses are like tents, very high and have good chimneys ;(2 ) but among the many villages which I saw none had over twelve or fifteen houses.

Priday October 26th. He was on the southern side of said islands, all was shallow for five or six leagues, he anchored there. The Indians he had with him told him that to reach Cuba with their canoes from those islands would take them a day and half, these canoes are small vessels of one piece of wood and have no sail. These are the canoes. He sailed thence for Cuba, because from the signs which the Indians gave him of the size and of its gold and pearls he thought that was the one, that is to say Oipango. Saturdfl,y October 27th. At sunrise he weighed anchor from those islands, which he called las is"las de Arena [Sand Islands] on account of the little bottom they had for six leagues to the south. He ran south· southwest at. the rate of eight miles an hour until one o'clock in the afternoon, making about forty miles, and up to nightfall they had made about twenty-eight miles on the same course, and before night they saw the land. They were on the lookout during the night with much rain which it rained. They ran on Saturda,y until sunset seventeen leagues south-southwest.

THE TR.A.CK OF NA y .A.RRETE.

Navarrete said, 1st: Columlms sigbted the east side of the Grand Tnrk while steering a course ~ S. awl from there ht· weut around by the north, to the west side of the island. ANSWEH. The journal of October 11 says that at suns('t-on that day the sun set at 51t '11 01 apparent time-Colnmhns RtPercd west and made tlie laml at 2 a. m. the next day. On the 13th Columbus wrote: "I determined to wait until to morrow evening, anu then to sail for the southWPst." On the 14th he wrote that lie went with the boats ''along the island in a north-northeasterly direction, to sec the ot11er 8ide," * * * 11 an<l afterwards 1 returned to the 11ltip( 1) and set sail." Navarrete Raid, 2d; From the west side of tlw Grand Turk Columbus sailed w. by~. 2- N. rn miles to the Caicos falands which, to_gcther, forme<l the second, to which he gave the name of Santa Jforia rle la Concepcion. (Narari·ete, p. 21i, note I.) ANS\VER. Conceding that Colnmbus went to the north of west when be said, ou the 13th, that be would sail "for the southwe,;t," arnl admitting tlie prohaJ1ilit.Y that in 1492 the Caicos group was one island, yet it does not agree with the description of the second island lie came to, of which he wrote 011 the 15th: "And I foun<l that that side which is towards the islancl of San Salvador runs nortL [aud] south, and is five leagues [15.U nautical miles] in length, and the other whieh I followed ran east [and) west, and contains over ten leagues [31.8 nautical miles]. And as from this one I saw another larger one to the west, I clewed up the sails · * * and about sunset I anchored near saitl cape [the western cape]." The e;1st side of the Caicos is north and south 13 miles, which corresponds with the journal; but the north shore is N. W. hy "\V. ! W. 38 miles and then S. "\V. } W. 38 miles. Or, if the N. E. side of the Caicos group be designated as the east and west side that Columbus followed, it agrees near euough in distance, but varies 2t points in direction ; aud if we assume the journal tQ be in error in giving "east [and] west," there is still the insurmountable fact th~tt Columbus wrote thrne 1imeR on the 15th, and twice on the 16th, that the third islan<l bore west from the seconu. A Yessel anchored at the west cape of the N. E. side of the Caicos group has no land visible. Tl.te island of Mariguana is the nearest, and this is N. W. by W. i W. 43 miles distant. Navarrete said, 3d: From the second island Columbn-'l sailed to the southward and westward to Little Inagua, the third island, which he named Fernantlina. (Navarrete, p. 28, note I.) ANSWER. If we take Navarrete's course as it is laid down on the chart, from the west cape of tlle N. E. Ride of the Caicos, the course and distance to Little Iuagua are S. W. t W. 60 miles. If we measure from the S. vV. Caicos to Little lnagua-S. E. side-it is about W. S. W. 25 miles. On the 15th of October Columbus was at the west cape of his second island and he wrote in rf'garcl to the third island, "I saw another larger one to the west · · · and so I departed at about te.n o'clock witl1 a S. E. wind, inclining to the soutb, for the otlwr island, a >ery large one." · * · Aud when he came to the thirtl island he said: "All this portion of the island runs N. W. [and] S. E., ancl it appears that there are on this coast more than 28 leagues [89.1 nautical miles]." On the 16th, after a i:nore careful examination, he wrote: "And this cape to which I have come and all this coast runs N. N. W. and S. S.

This il:l the description of Ferdinaud Island. It cannot be Little Inagua, as Sayarrete assertli, because this is ouly 7:! miles east arnl west, and the same~. N. Kand S.S. \Y.

(Navarrete, p. 33, note I.)

ANSWER. Such courses and distances cannot be found in Columlmf;' journal. He left the fourth island on the 24th of October and wrote: "At mi<l11ight(2) I weighed auchor from the i8larnl of IsalJelhi, * * "' in order to go to the il'iland of Uulia. * * * Aud they told me that I should go to it by the W. S. \V., and so I think. * * * .Aud thus I sailed nutil day to the W. S. W., and at dawn the wincl calmed. * * * Aud I rernaiued with little wind until after midday and then the wind begau to blow vPry lon~ly. * * * I followed mr conro;e until nightfall, and the Caho V crde of the island of Fernamlina bore N. \V. 7 leagueH ['.!'.:.:J nautical mileii ]."( 3 ) On the :.!5th, still steering ~W. S. \V., Columhn" disco\'cred "scYcn or ei1.d1t i8lands, all extending from north to south, db;tant from them tirn leagues [15.9 nautical mill'8].'' Ou the '..Wth the journal rP:uls: "He was on the southern side of said islands, all was shallow for firn or six leagues, he anchored there. · * * He sailed thence for Cuba." The jonmal sa,ys, Oetobcr 27: "At sunrise he weighed anchor from those islands, 'Yhich he called Saud islands, m1 account of the little bottom they had for six league8 [Hl uantical miles l to the south.'' X antrrete wrote, in a note, pp. 3!)-40, that Col um bus anchored on the 2Gth of OctolJer on the eastern and southern shoal of tlIC "Grand Hauk of Baliama," and left there for Cuba. .Although ~avarrete's track, on the chart, docs not rflach thi8 hank, we must admit, from t.11is note, that. he intended it. Bnt there is no part of "Columbus Bank" which bears ,V. S. W. from Grnat Inagua. Domiugo Cay, the most southern part, is \V. 2 N. from the most northeastern part of Great Inagua; and the south Hagged islan1l, south of which he :mcl10red, bears -w. by N. 2 N. 155 miles from the X. E. end of Great Inagua, aucl N. ·w. by W. ! w·. rn.:1 miles from the S. W. end. The .ionmal e,·idently omits some of the distances run from Isabella to the Santi Islands; but 011 the 24th Columbus giws the bearing antl ·distance of the S. W. Cape of Fernandina, and this "departure'' is put on the chart. Afterward he logs 16 leagues W. S. \V., then he saw the Saud Islands 5 leaguPs cfoitant, making a total of 21 leagues, 6(i.8 nautical miles. The true course and distance from his ''departure" to South Hagged are W. S. W. (i5 miles. This close agreement may he accidental; but if we omit all distances g;iYen, yet the course8 found in the journal are irreconcilable with any from Great Inagua to tht\ soutl1eastern Bahama Bank. In respect to Port Nipe, which Navarrete and Captain Be.dwr adopt for Columbm;'s first anchoring-place in Cuba, see the discussion of Captain Beeher's track. By selecting Turk for the first landfall, an extreme S.

THE TRACK OF

Vamhagen said, 1st: Columbus made the island of l\Iarignana steering west; he roundPd the east end and anchored on the northeast shore. Heuce he steered W. ! N. 40 miles for Creek Point on Acklin Island; followed the north and south shore for 13 miles, and the east anu west shore 29 miles, and so over to t.he south cape of I.1ong Island.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE:NT OF THE

ANSWER. Varnhagen, like Nannrete, ignores the assertion of Columbus of October 13: "I determined to wait until to-morrow evening and then to sail for the south west." He has even omitted tlii!; weighty sentence from bis Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckung. Conceding that he steered to the westward from Guanahani, yet Columbus said, on the 15th of October, that the second island he steered for was ti over 5 leagues distant, rather 7 [l.!2.3 nautical miles]" but Varnhagen's second island is 40 miles from the first. A difference of 79.4 per cent. in such a short run, actually gone ovei' 1 is not possible with so experienced a navigator. In crossing the Atlantic, a distance of more than 3,000 miles, be overran his log Ht per cent. only. In going from MMiguana to Acklin, Columbus went within 5 miles of two islands, each 70 feet high. According to Yarnhageu, Columbus does not mention them. It is not characteristic of his journal to omit all notice of the first islands lie came to in the New World. He wrote on the 15th of October: ,; Nevertheless it was m~- desire not to pass an.r island without taking possession of it, as one taken possession of the same may he said of all; and I anchored and remained until to-day .11 Col um bu;i did not go along tlrn shore of the second island which runs north and south. He wrote on the 15th of October, "I found that that side which is towards the island of San Salvador runs north land J south, and is fl. ve leagues in length, and the other which 1 foll-Owed( 1) ran east [and] west." Varnhagen said, 2d: Columlms went from the south cape, around Long Island and returned to tlie south carie. ~'1NSWEH. On the lGth Columbus -wrote: "This island is exceedingl,y large and I liaYe deter· mined to go around it · *' *' [agaiu ]. I set sail with a south wind intending to go around the whole island." .. · .. Ou the 17th he wrote: ''The wind then ceased, and then sprang up from the ·w. N. ·w., which was contrary to our course, and so I turned around and sailed all the past night. · · · And we [are] at the S. K cape of tlie islaw.l where I ho1>e to anchor until it gets clear." 1n addition to these decisive words, there is the fact, shown by the chart, that between Exuma and Long Island the water is too shoal for such vessels ati Columbus used. This will be spoken of again in discussing Irving's track. Varnhagen said, 3d: Columbus sailed from the south cape of Long Island .to the N. W. end of Crooked Island, then across the ''Columbus bank" to Port Gibara, in Cuba. ANSWER. This part of Varnhagen's track comes near t-0 Captain Becher's and the writer's, aud tberefore need not be considered here except in regard to the harbor of Gibara. In the journal of Oetober 28th we read: "He went thence in search of the island of' Cuba, · · · and entered a Yery beautiful river · · · the mouth of the river had twelve fatlwms."( 2 ) The port of Gibara is n small basin, exposed to northerly winds, and has three fathoms, only, at the entrance.
1\7 ASHINGTON IRVING'S TRACK.

The track of vVashington Irving is laid down from his description of the "Route of Columbus in his first voyage." ( frlling's Columbus, revised edition, vol. iii, appendix, pp. 366-380.) Irving wrote, 1st: "From Guanabani Co1nmbus saw so many islands that he was at a loss wbich next to visit. · · · He determined to go to the largest in sight. · · · The isla.nd thus selected, it is presumed, was the present island of Conception; and that the others were that singular belt of small islands known as La Cardena (or the chain) stretching past the island of San Salvador in a S. E. and N. W. direction; the nearest of the group being nearer thau Concepcion, while the rest are more distant. · · · We know that in all this neighborhood tbe current sets strongly to the W. N. W.; an<l since Columbus had the current against him he must have been sailing in an opposite direction, or to the E. S. E. · · · Hence it is rendered eertain that Columbus ditl not sail westward in going from San Salvador to Conception; for from the opposition of the wind, as there could be no other cause, he could not sail toward that quarter. · · · Uonccption situated E. S. E. from San Salvador, and at a corresponding distance of 5 leagues ( 15.9 nautical miles]."

Colnmlms wrote: "Aud from t11i1; iislaud of Santa }faria to the other vne tli(·ri· me U leagues [:28.G nautical miles] east [and) west." On the 16tl1, after arriving at Feruarnlina, he wrote: "This islaud lies at a distance from that of Sauta ~[aria 8 leagues [:2.j.5 nautical miles] almost east [and] west.'' He could not hare e11tered aml s:1iled out of this mar·ellous port hy the opposite entrance, becausl; on the 17th of October he said: "I found a very marvellous port. · · · \Vi thin it there is ample room for 100 ships if it had snfticient depth of water and was clear, aml also had a <leep entrance. I thought it worth while to examine and Rouml it, and so I anchored outside of it, and weut in with all the boats of the ships and saw there was not bottom." Neither could he ha Ye discovereu that part of Exnma \l"liicli runs east and west, because no part of it does. Nor could he ham anchoreu oppositl' the extremity of l<'ernamliua, because there is not sufficient depth of

Here they f0u11u a little island surrounded h,y rocks, with another reef of rock8 lying hetwePn it and Samoet. To Samoet Columbus gaYe the name of faahdla, and to tbe point of it opprnsite the little island., tJ1at of Cabo del Isleo; the cape of the S. \Y. point of Samoet Columbns calkd Cabo de La~una, and off tliis last his ships were brought to anchor. '.l'he islarnl Ja;v in the <lirection from :Fernandina to Isabella, east and west.

ANSWER. This is the description of that part of the Bahamas which the lVest India Pilot, vol. ii, p. 4H, describes thus: "The west sitle of Long lslm1<l is only navigable fOr boats and very small consfrrs, who manage to pick their wa~· across to the Jumento cays." The blank space 011 this ebart from Exnma to Long Island was pnrposely left so by the English surveyors, because it is 1rnmffigahle. There is no gronwl for lmlie\·ing tLat the water was dee11er in 1492, for the wasting of these islantll'l and ca~-s tentl~ to the opposite result. Irving rnakes Uolumhus leave Exnma [Fernandina] in searcb of Samoet, wbicl1, he says, is Long faland. l\ow whc11 (;olumbus was at Conception he had Loug Island plainly in sight, for it is 0111.v 14 miles from therP. In fact, to g·o from Conception to Exuma, an island he could not see, lie had to herul llis conrse to the nortl1ward and westward to avoid an island that was visible at l1is start and fur whirh ue was ;:marching. lITi11g wrote, 4th: "lla\·ing resoked to visit the island which the natiles called Cuba, and described as beariug v\'. :S.

After he had e:xamiuetl the island in the boats on the 14th, he wrote: "And afterward I returned to the ship and set sail." Captain Becher writes, 2ll (page 345, note, appendix) : "Rum Cay is the name of the small island first steered for hy Columbus after leaYing Guanalmni, and on which he not only did not consider it worth while to land, but eYcu not to bestow a name." rages 111, 112: "The distance of Rum Cay corres11onds with that given by Columbus, but lie was miHtaken in respect of its size, and no doubt baffled and deceived from the effects of the current.

These extracts from Columhn:s aml Captain Becher are contradictor,y. Captain Becher's 1:-traiu at an agreement is at the expense of Columbus, and his surmises show the immrrnom1ta ble ol1staele of selecting Rum Ca,rfor the second ishmd. The substance of Columbmi' journal is this: he s,tiled oYer 31-/" miles along shore of the secoml island, which ran east aud west: tlll'n lw saw a largp1· islautl to the west; he took in sail; he named the secoml isla11d aull he a11el10red at tile west cape of it, and the next day he went on shore there. Captain Becher, Appendix, p. 3±5, note xxix, tram;latPs '·Cargtw las Yelas"-cro1cds all sail; the true 111<~a11ing is, I clmoed up the sail8. On p. llH Captain ]1<·cher again recognize;; the Jll'rplexit,r of his situ:ition, for after saying that Columbus did not hest<rn, a name on the secoml isl:rnd lie writes: "B11t why sl10uld 'II-nm Ca,v' be thus left uameh·ss ~ '' Awl t11er1·npo11 he lll'OJlose:< this tampering- with the names girnu hy Columbus (p. 118). "The long appellation of Sau ta .Nuria dP la Coucepciou is, therefore, diYided behrt>.eu Rum C:L,r :tllll hmg: lslarnl; tlw name. Co11rn·pciou lH·iug assigned to the former, an<l to the latter, I.i011g Island, Santa, .l\fari<t, or St. :\lary." On pag-e :l'i(i he recalls this extraordinary dirision, and suggests that the whole of Long Island should be called Concepcion, and the northwest cape, Santa .l\lnria. Capt:iin Becher asks how Uolumhn:::; eonl<l have. lleterrniued the length of the side of the island next to Gu:mahani, as the cnrrerrt Jll'e\·eutell his going to tlie southward, aml he remarks that it must haYe been mere. "guet<swork.'' On the 15th of October Columbus speaks of being late in arridng at the seeoml islapd, becan1<e .: tlw Lid1~ detained me." He says nothing about the "current" preYenting his course to the south. Of the two sides of the island he saw, he chose to follow the one t'um1ing cast and west, without g-i · iu~ an.r reason therefor. His estimate of the Je11gtl1 of tlte side he did not follow was " g·uesswork.'' Navigators of the present day Hecessari!J· enter upon their log.hooks a great deal of guei,:.~work, espeeiall;y in regard to new lands, and the~· will continue h.1 do so. Captain Becher writes, 3d (p. 118): "Columbus pas8ed along the northern shorn of Hum C:iy without landing on it, and coutimic.d to the west under all the sail he conl<l set for OaJie Sau ta Maria de la U0Bce11cion."

ANSWER. On tlw rnth of Ortolwr Uolnmbns was at the western cape of an island which he ca1letl Santa J\lariit de la Concepciou, con1;idered b~, Captain Becher to be the north euu of Long Islam!. Then, aud on that date, Colnmhm; wrote: "From thit-1 iRlaml I saw another larg·er one to the went." * * * "AlHl Roon after I Ret Rail for the other large island that appeared at the west." * * * "And so I left, at about ten o'clock, with a southeast wind i11clining to the south for the other island." * * · "And from this island of Santa lifaria to the other one there are nine leagues [28.li Jlautical milPsJ east nml west." Ou the Hith he wrote: ':.Abont noon I left the falluuls of Santa .iJiaria de lei Co11ceprion for the island '!l .Penwndina, which appears to be w~ry large to the west, and I sai]e(l all that day with calm weather.'' On tlrn same date, haYing arrived at Fernandina, he writes: ''This h;land lies at a distance from that of Santa J\faria of eight leagues (25.5 nautical miles] almost east [aud] west.71 Assumiug tliat the mastlwad lookout of' the flag-8hip was 60 feet above the sea, the range of Yisibility for the horizon is 8.85 nautical milf's. There is no part of Gwat Ex11nrn O\'er 100 feet J1igb, tlie range of Yisihility of which i:- 11.42 nautical miles, total 20.27 miles.(1) The land whieh bears west from the north end of Long Island is the northwest end of Exuma, dfotant :3s miles, and it is, of course, inyisible. The entrance of Exuma harbor, to which Captain Becher takes Colnmlms (PP· 132-1:33), is S. ·w. by ·w. 24 miles from C~ipe Santa Maria, and the islarni about 2 milt'8 farther. At the distance of 26 miles it is l1clow the horizon, but sometimes, es1iecially at nightfall, clouds form which make a strong re8emblance to land. Had Colmnbus meimt to go from l:-lanta ~faria to the southwartl and westward, he might be· licvc that he saw land there. But he did not sail in that direction; he tlid not ;, edge" to the south; lie <lid not "look along the western shore"; he reiterates that he saw land to the 11'C8t, and be went tl1Pre.. Captaiu Becher easily satisfies himself in respect to the views he holds in contradiction to Colnmhns, by sa_yiug that he "deceived himself"; wa:s lmftiing investigation, an<l "puzzling et: fectnally the ingenuity of all geographers." Captain Becher· writes 4th, pages 132-133, that Colnmbus sailed from Exnma harbor, "where Jw Jia<l now obtained water, "" * "" about noon of "\Vedncstlay, the 17th of October," and "the sliips all make sail on a north.northwest course.'' Pages 134-rn5: "vVhen they were about two leagues from the cape, or extreme of the island, he observes what he supposes to be the mouth of a river, and is iuducetl to anchor his ships off it. * · · Instead of a ri\'er they find what would be a harbor large enough to conta.in all the ships of Christendom (a favorite expression of Columbus), if it were not deficient in depth, a no less (·ssential qualit;r, indeed, than superficial exteut for the formatiou of a harbor. It is described as liaviug two entrances formed by au island, yet very narrow aQ<l with little water in them. 'l'be harbor, from this descriptiou, seems to correspond with a part of the sho1·e of the island about ten miles to the N.

A~SWER. \\'hen Columbus left 8anta 1\laria for Fernandina. ou tile lGth of October, he \HOte: "I could not arriYe iu time to see the bottom in order to get a clear :mchorage, a tlling- i·cr1uiri11g· the greatest care in order not to lose the anchors; in conse<JtHmce I \rnited until da~·light whPn I auchored uear a village." * * * "Aml this cape to which I lrnye come, and all this coast rnus northwest and southeast." October 17th he wrote: "At midday I left the village wliere I Lall anchored and taken iu water, in .order to sail around this isla11d of Fernandina, * · * I sailed to the north-northwest, and when I was near the end of the island. two leagnes off rG.4 nautical miles], I found a Yer;r marrnllons port with an entrance; although it ma~- he said that there are two entrances, hecan:-;c it has a rncky islet iu the rnitlillP, and hoth are ver.y narrow, bnt witllin it there is ample room for one hundred ships if it had sufficieut depth of water and was clear, and also luul a deep entmnce: I thought it worth while to examine and smmd it, and so I aucliored outside of it, and went in with all the boats of the ships, and saw· that there was uot bottom.

Captain Becher auehors Columbus off Exnrna harbor, where his vessels take in some "\Yater. Ile does not say which entrance, but from his track it appears to be the southeatit one. Tbe series of connected harbors formed by ]J;lizabeth aud Stocking islands aud the atljaceut cays, on the iwrtheast sirle of Bxuma, are the best in the Bahamas. They are from ! to~ a mile wide, and han~ two entrances, 7~ miles apart. The southeast one has 18 fpet at low water and the northwest one 21 feet. The tide rises 2~ feet. Beg'inning at the R011theast is Elizahctlt harbor, with from 21 to 23 feet; Stoeking with rn; Conch 15 to 24, and at the northwest Exnma with ~U. Thest' harbors are gcuerall,y known b~- the name of "Exuma," aud they will be so called iu this imper. Captain Becl1er had the Admiralty plans, and the deseriptiou of each, in his office. :m!l therefore knew tliat Exuma coultl not he the "man·ellom; port" which Columbus exami11ed and found too shoal. Hitherto Columbus had been casting anchor 011 the rPefs smTomHling the islands, and his anxiet,y therefrom found expression in his journal of the Lith a nil Hlth of October. Uan anyone be made to cc>mprehend, that when he had "voyaged the unreal, vast, uubounde<l deep,'' and arriwd off a series of sheltered harbors, lte did not go in aml rrn<'lim·; did not even mention them in his jonmal; but sailed awa~' from these, whicl1 had sufficient depth, to the northwest 10 miles, where he found a "marvellom1 port which had nmple room for 100 sl1ips''not "all the ships of Christeudom," as Captain Becher translates it-but was too shallow; and that this ''marvellous port" described so minutely by Columbus-because a lmrbQr deep enough for his vessels to enter was the necessity of bis situation-Captain Becher dismis1ms by saying that it eorrespoll(ls "with a part of the shore about ten miles to t,he northwest of the former harlJor [Exum a], hut i1o1 really nothing more than the low shelving shore of the island coYeretl to tlle depth of a fow feet l1y the sea." If Columbus's track had been along the shore of Exuma, as laid down by Captain Beeher, he could not have found a port with ,insuffi<Yient water to enter; he would have discm·ered thotie excellent harbors ample for his needs, which may be seen on the British .Admiralt.y cltarti-;-" Special pla11s of the Ballama Bauk" and" Harbori; of Great Exuma, uumber 3!.lO"-aud he would certaiuly have anchored therein. Captain Becher writes, 5th (pp. 13i-140): "But trouble is at hand. Colnrnbm; says, he had experienced rain every day more or less since he had been amoug the islands. He was now to endure the discomforts of a heavy gale, the first he had met with in the ~ew World. * * · The breeze before wl1ich the Admiral bore up soon freshens, aml he runs before it to the E. S.

This mistake of the Admiral iu believing tliat he was now at anchor off the southeast end of Exmna, which he had named Fernanc1iua, when he wa8 really off Long Island, is thus quite admissible. He had mHll'rgorn· the ordeal of a gale accompanied br heayy rain, and in the obscuritr of this and tlw dal'knm;s of nigllt he must frerpiently kwe lost sight of tlte laud, anxious as he was to keep it on board, a]](l at the same time fearful of get.ting· too near it. His coudnsiou was formed on fair gromt<ll-l, hut under circumstances which rendered him very liable to be deceiYcd as lie was; for he was now at n11cl10r 81mgly slieltered from the sea with his fleet under the sout!Jemit end of Long Island, or, as he snpposed, Fernandina, to which island the name Santa Maria has been assigned, as gh-en by himself to the northwest cape of it, that of Fernandina ueing left for l~xnma, on which isfaml it was undoubtedly lJestowed by the Admiral." ANSWER. The liubstancc of these extracts is, that from t.lw northwest cud of Great Exnma Colmnlms made good an E. tS. E. conrse to clear Uape Santa .Maria, before a wind which fresh_ ene(l into a gale; that during the night of October 11-18 there was a heavy gale accompanie!l lJy rain; that tlie sllipH rounded tlw capt> :mu "hound along· before the gale at uo great cli,.;tance from the outer sl1ore of Ijong lslaud ;" that sometimes the land was obscured by the storm and the darkness of the night.; and that tiuall~ lw anived safe at, the soutlieast ellll of tlie isht11fl, hut, for reason:,; given, he believed he was at anclwr at the southeast end of Exuma. Col11111lms, uudel' date of October 1"i, but obviously written on the 18th, said: "And so I turned around and sailed all tlie past 11ight to tl1(j cast-southeast, and sometimes wholly east arnl s011wtimcs to the sontl1east; this I did in order to ke('P off the land for the atmosphere was very mhity and the wmtther thrnatening: it ftlw wind] ir:r111 light and did not permit me to reach the lm1d in order to anc11or. So that this night it rained very hard after midnight until almost da;r, and is still cloudy in order to rain; and we [are] at the southeast cape of the iRland where I hope to auchor until it gets clear in order to see the other islarnl:,; wliere I have to go." On the 18th, co11ti1rning· these remarks, be.wrote, "After it cleaned up I followed the wind, an<l went al'onud the islarnl as much as I could, and I anchored w!Jen lt wa;.; no longer possible to sail." From the northwest end of Great l~xnma to the northwest end of Long Island it is east 38 miles, 11rww about S. B. b;y S. t S. 51 to the southeast cape aml 5 more to the s011th end; total 100 miles. The sun rose October 17 at 6 11 20m and set at 5h 40 apparent time; twilight lasted 1h J9m, so that tl1e darkness of that night was very little more thmi 10 hours. It is essential to Captain Bechcr's case tliat the rnssels of Columbus slrnll be gotteu to tbe south ca1ie of Lo11g Island, but he cannot take them the sbortest way, between Long Island and Jo~xnma, as Irving did, because the surveys made since he examined the subject show this to be impo88ihle. Therefore he seeks to extricate hi111Relf from the dilemma by inventing a storm for the night of October 17-18. 'fhere is not, a wor<l in the journal to authorize Captain Bechcr's assert.ion in regard to the wentlt<'r of this night. KettPil's translation, p. 51, is this: ''The weather being cloudy and thick it rained violently from midnight till near day, and the sky still remains cloudy." :Major, journal of the Iwyal Geographical Society1 volume xli, p. 200: "There was little wind and it di<l not allow me to put in to ancl1or. So it rained Yery heavily from midnight, till near daybreak." Irving, reYised edition, Life of Co1um hns, volume iii, avpendix: " For the we:tther threatened a storm, which, lioweYer, <lissipatc<l it;;,elf in rain." Columbus says of the wind," el era poco," it waF; li9ltt. All his otl11:1r words, and his actions, sltow the truth of this. He was among islands which he l1ad observed were surrounded by reefs, and at "two lomhard shots" no bottom; he had felt the influence of the tide;;, and no1r, at night, witl1 thick weather, bnt li.!Jht winit8, his anxiety "to reach the land in order

to anchor," and thus maintain his position rather than drift, was what might bf~ expected of a prudent aud skilful seaman. If Columbus had "'made good" a course E. S. E. from the northwest end of Exuma he would have nm on shore about 12 miles south of the northwest eud of Long Islarnl. Little Exmna, con sidered by Captain Becher to he also Exuma-and so allowed in this discu;.:sion-lies ,...-est-northwp,;t and cast-soutbeaRt, while the south piirt of Long Island is uorth-nortbwest and south-soutbea;-;t. In Captain Becher1s track from Rum Cay to Exuma he anchors Columbus, on the e\·cuiu~- of October 15, at the uorthwest end of Long Island. The next morning tbe Admiral went on shore, hut returned aud sailed on or hefon~ 110011. During this short Yisit lie bad no opportunitJ· to inspect the shore line of the island, neither could be possibly know the direction of that part whiclt lay beyond tbe range of visibility from his masthead, a distance only of 8.85 miles (ante, p. 3ii2). Although at this time Columbus had bee11 but four days among thR Bahamas, he noted iu his journal the dangers of the navigation and tbe care which he took to shun thew. Captain Becher ought to bave reaclied the conviction that such a seaman and Illffigator as Columbus would not start his squadron from the northwest eml of Great Exurna and steer between l{nm Cay and Conception on the one side, and Loug Island on tbe other, and then coast the wlioll' Jeugth of the latter 60 miles, 50of1chich were 11nknown to hi in, in a dark night, during a ga1e (~f irirul~ in thicl: rainy weather, and so near the coral reefli circling the ii;land that he .wm· the latte1· in tltc inter-

vals of the storm.
This night had ahout ten houri,; of darkness (ante, p. 384), and the distance rnn along Captain Becher's track is 100 nautical miles, equal to 10 nautical, or about e Italian miles, en·rr hour, au unprecedented speed. This might be conceded, but in no circumstances such as Captain Becher mentions shonl<l a seaman attempt to steer for and theu haul around Long Island, except there was a light on the northwest end. ::\either would n seamau coast the sho1'e of w1know11 land d1tring da1'kness and storm, no matter what the urgency might be. The fruit. of blundering seamanship like this can be found in the record of shipwrecks along the Bahama reefs.(!) In uaYigating among such islands a commander is sometimes cornpelled to take tlie 11reseut risk in order to escape an impending disaster. But Captain Becher laid no such streisl' upon Columbus. He "bounds him along" the reef of this coral island and into the unknown darkness~ as if it was :is easJ- to do as to \Hite al.lout. He makes him straddle a strange island during a stormy night, and anchor witlessly at the end of the wrong· one iu the moming. Tlw cireumstances in which St. Paul's ship approached au unknown island (luring a storm and darkness were difforent from those which Uolumbus found in the Bahama;;, bnt the narrative of St. Luke, in the twenty-seventh chapfor of the Acts, is instructi\·e, because it shows au excellent. piece of seamanship performed at land under great strain, by whicll, although the ship wat-1 lost, all hands were saved.(2) These ancient se:tmen had not learned to "bound along" the shores of unknown lauds in a storm~- night. Tlieir thoughts at such a time wen· bent upon saving, not risking. Captain Becher writes, Gtl1; That on the l!lth of October Columbus went from the south ernl of r,ong Island to the northwest end of Crooked and remained on the west side of that a1Hl Fortune, until the 24th, when he sailed to the 'V. S. 'y ., and on the 25U1 anchored, according to Captain Becher's chart, on the edge of "Columbus Bank," 19 miles E. ;z N. from the Sontl1 Hagg·ed. Hence, on the 27th, he left for Cnha, steering S.S. W., au<l on the !!8th hronght his vesseli-; to in the harbor ofNipe. Page 131: Captain Becher speaks of the efforts which Irving aud llmnholdt madt· to eistahlish Cat Isla.ml as the first landfall, in this way: "In reality they are so many JH'Oofs of the want of that patient and discrimi11ate perusal of the journal which it really required.''

A~Rw.1m. From the sonth eud of Long Island to Crookeu and Fortune islamls, hence toward the 8an1l Islands, Captain Becher's track is near to mine and will be referred to subsequently. Columbus dill not anchor HI miles E. if::-<. of the Sand Islamfo (Ragged). His journal of Octoher :!6 reads: "He was on the southern side (1) of said islands; all was shallow for fi or G leagues (lfi.9 to 19.1 nautical mileR]. He anchorec1 therc.''( 1 ) I beliern he did not go to port Nipe for the following reasons: From the month to one mile inside are these soundings in mi<l-chanuel, 3!} fathoms, 3u, 17, 28, :l3, 17 and 18. See a Spanish plrrn published b,y tlie British .Admiralty, October 25, 1826; corrected to 18ii5. The journal of October :.!8 reads: "The mouth of the river had 12 fathoms." The course from the southern side of Saud Islands to port Nipe, is S. !I: E. If the" two points of westerly variation," supposed by Captain Recher, be applied to the S. S. W. course steered by Columbus from the Sand Islands to Cuba, he would not have fetched it by three-quarters of a point, and there is a westerly current also to overcome. The entrance to port Nipe look.s east; it cannot be seen on a .southerly course until one gets to it. A seaman would not nm into a lee bight unless he was pressed, or acquainted with the land and knew of a harbor at the bottom. Columbus was probably running before the :N. E. trades which maile this bight a lee shore. His journal tells us that he went "to the land nearest to it" [him]. Such would be the act of a discoverer now. There are two harbors west of Nipe that come nearer to the words of Oolmnhus's journal: Naranjo, with 13 fathoms at the entrance, and Padre witlt 14.. Captain Hech01· might bctt~r have taken either. The British Admiralty have begnn to adopt the co1'iectnres of Captain Becher ou their chart<I', even to dividiug the name of "Santa Maria de la Concepcion," which was given by Columbus. It must haye come to pass from tlie positiveness of his assertions and not on account of his argumentation. This method of applying Columbus's words in detail to refute each of the alleged tracks, and the study tl1at I gave to the sul~Ject in the winter of 1878-'79 in the Bahamas, which had been familiar cruising ground to me, has resulted in the selection of Samana or Atwood Cay for the first landingplace. It is a little island 8.8 miles east and west; 1.6 extreme breadth, and averaging 1.2 north and south. It lu1s 8.6 square miles. Tlte east end is in latitude 23° 05' N.; longitude 730

Tl1osP who were admonished by the admiral to 1:e.ep a sharp lookout from the forecastle were, of course, looking alwad-west-and the moon, then uearl,y at the thinl <Jnarter, was partl_y behind them aml shone tlirectl.\- upm1 the white bluff. 'This was most favorable for seeing the land at night, and it is a memorable fact that Columbus first t>aw the New \Yorld tlHongh tbe light of the moon. In the journal of the 14th of October the Admiral wrote that he "went along the island, in a north-northeasterly direction, to see the other side, which was on the otlter r-;ide of the east." The same date he said that iu going along in tlw boats he "foum1 a piel'.e of land, likf' an island, although it was not om', with six hou:ses on it, which in two days could easily he cut off and conYerted into au island." The first quotation is the languag·e of a scama11 who had mrnhored under a jutting point of land which stretched to the eastward and was in sigllt; he could see oue side as far as the east Pn1l, but he desired to Sl'e the 'other side of the ea8t end. Columbus was at anchor on an opeu coast; each vessel had but one boat, sec Appendix E 1 and he took all the boats for his e.x ploration of the I-1th. For this reason, aeconling to tlte usagr, of the sea, lie ought not to withdraw far from his ships. The second quotation coufirms the first, as to hi~ being in the neighborhood of a peninsula. l3otl! agree well with the east end of Samairn. The point of lantl that Columbus said could easil,\· lw cut off has beeu separated already by the erosion of the waYes. See sub.sketch of Sama11a. It seems a weighty ol~jection to Samana, that this name appears on the noted map of Juan de la Cosa, together 1tith Guanalrnni. La Oosa was the t·ornpanion of Colnmlms-seaman~ diartmaker, pilot, master, and he made six rnyages t-0 the New \V orld. It is said of him in Disquisi· eio11es _Sauticus, pnr el Capitan, Ile ll'ario, Ge1wreo Fernandez lJuro, Madrid, 1876, Tom. I, p. 59: "In the first voyage of Christopher Columbus, La Cosa went as master of his vessel, the same on which that otlicer se1Terl until it was wrecked in the Antilles: on the second he went likewise on hoflnl the caraYcl .Sina styling himself master of chart.making, and in returning from this latter he was obligl'd to undertake in the port of Santa Maria the long and mim1te labor of making the chart whieh wa" tinislu·d in the year 1500." In 1832 Barou de Humboldt aud M. Yalcknaer, found in the library of Baron de \Vakkenaer, an illuminated map skilfully drawn on an ox·hide.

An im1niry iu· 1·rganl to thic; rn1rne would be worth pursuing, but it tloes uot belong to a tliscusisimt of the fin;t landfall. On the 1.'ltli of October, the day before the Admiral left Gnanalmni, lie wrote: ''I determined to wait until to-morrow eveniug, and then to sail for the southwest.'' 'fhiR is all the illfol'uiation the journal giyes in respect to the course steered f1·om the first island. The infercrn~e iR that Le went as he said Le should go, because he uwlerstood that gold could be gotttr1 in that diri'clfon. J~nt the woof sliall be supplied by tlw sul>sequent agreements between the journal and the 11hysical faetR. After lie liad left Gu:mahani he saw so many islands that he was undeeid!'Ll wllich to sail for first, hut he determined to make fol' tlte largest. A vessel that lea\'es tlte east part of Samaua aud steers to the southward 'Yi th Ronie wt·sting comes into view of the hillis of Plana Uays, Acklin, am1 Crooked, on bearings from soutl1-southeast to west by south, and to a stranger these hills wonlrl appear like so many islands. .After Columbus anchored at the secoud island he wrote that it was tin~ leagues: rather senm-1.J.f) or :!~.3 nautienl miles-from the first. The northeast eud of Acklin hears S. TL hJ- S.;} S., 23 nautical miles from the east part of Sanrnna. For thi8 discussion l cousider Acklin aud Crooked to be one island, under the name of Crooked. The chnnnel wl1ich Sl'parates them is of modern origiu, no donhL H has the appearance of lun-ing heen made h.Y erosion; it is so shallow that it can be waded across, even at high water, and it is invisible to a passing Yessel. Sec chart and sub-sketch. Columbus wrote that the second island had a north-and-south side 15.U, and one cast and west over 31.8 miles long. Crooked has a north-and-south side 13, ~md another which runs west by nOl'th aml east h_y south 29 miles. A uayigator of to-day could not come nearer to the truth, in describing the island in like circumstances; but Columbus kept liis time with a sand-glass, and n·cko11ed his Rpeed by the eye. I wish the reader to take }iced that it is the second 'island, ancZ ·no otltei-, of wbicll the journal records th~ length and trend of two separate sides; and that Crooked is the onl]/ one in the Bahamas which conforllls to this description. A seeming objection to Crooked arises from the lauguage in the joumal of the 15th of Odober, that the side of the second island toward San SalYador ran uorth and south, whereas the side of Crooked which is in the direction of Samana runs easi aml w1~Rt. Columbus could not note this fact. at tile first island, because Crooked is not visible from bis anchorage there. .After lmning Gnanahani he saw mau~- islands, and mmle for the largest. As he stoOll off and on all uight, and the tide detained him on the 15th till about noon, he might have noted the side he then came to. 't'l1is is the understaudiug of H. H. Major, who, iu the Journal of the Royal Geograp/1 ical Society, yoJ. xli, 11. 198, franslateR the passage thus: "I found that tbe face of it, on the side toward San Salrn<lor [or rather, I would suggest, ou tl1e side approache(l by the ships in coming from Sau Sah'adol'J, ran north and south five leagues, and tile other side which I coaiited ran east and west ten leagues." I·roru the data kindly supplied by the officers of the Naval Obsen·atory in \Ya8hingtou, I learn that the moon crossed the meridian of Crooketl Island ou the 14th of October, 14U2, at 6h 3()rn a. m., Cid! time. The British Admiralty Tide Tables for 1881 give YII o'clock for tile "Establishment of tlw Port " at Crooked.· Thereforn it \\'a.S high water there on the 14th of October at 1h 3()m p. m.; low at 71' 48"', high at 2 a. m. on the 15th; low at Sh 12'" and high at 21o 24"' p. m. Tbe suu set at [ih 40"' and twilight laste,d about 11i 19'". The journal does not giw. the win(l at Guauahani, nor until the 16tli, at the second isla.nd, wllen it is entered as 8. E. I believe I have proyed on 1'· 388 that Columbus made the land on the 12th of October with a strong N.

the 16th. During the regular" trades" the current between Samana and Crooked flow,;\\. ~. \V. a knot an hour; but at other times the set and drift are uncertain. On the north si<lt· of Crooked the flood tide runs always to the eastward and the ebb contrarily. \Yheu Columlms neared the second island he estimated it to be 15.9 miles from the first; but the next day he called it :!'.!.:l. In tl1e mean time he was detained bJ' the tide l"O that he did not reach it again until about noon. Captain Bed1t·r (pp. 111-:Hii) siti<l that thiH detention was "set of the current''; bnt Colnml1us m;ed the word maria, not corr-iente; the former siguifies ti<le, tlnx mHl l'etlux; the latter c111Tcnt, progressirn motion of the water; a distinction lwld iu both laugnages and especial!~, amoug ;;ca. men, and one of importance here. These facts, in connection with the journal, enable me to offer a rcasonallle theory as to the moyements of his Yessels 011 the 14th arnl liith of October. He left the south sicle of the Past part of Samana on the 14th, undoubtedly after noon; and steered to the sontlnrnr<l .and we,.;tward, with light easterly winds, for Crooked. itlid wa.r he found the usual westerl;\' current, arnl on the other side he ran into a stronger one 11etting in the same direction; but this was i11e ebb tirfr which fioweu west, along the north shore of Crooked, from 111 36"' to 711 48'" p. m. He did not reach the lautl in time to see .bis anchoring.ground before dark, and the night was moonl('SS. ln consequence, he began, about sunset, (·i 11 40m), to stand oft' and on; that is, he beat to the ea;;tward to overcome this westerly set and keep his pla.ce until morning, when he intended to rnn in and nnehor. At 711 43m p. m. the tide turned aml flowed east until 2 a. m. 011 the ltith. 80 that in the darkness of the night he lmd, unknowingly, six hours and twelYe minutes of current, contrarJI to that for which lie was allowing. In this way he got so far to the eastward that it was noon before lie reached the island again; wlien he coasted the north shore and near sunset anchored at tlie west end. On the follo"-ing day, the lGth, he wrote his .iournal of the l:ith, by which time lie had obscr\'ed the di1:1tinction between the currents and tides in the neigh borl10od of Crooked, and he uot-0d the one whieh caused his detention. The second island of Columlms has bee,11 such a, stumbling-block to in>estigators that mauy of them assert that he sighted it, but passed on without stopping. See translation from Muuoz. a,nfc, p. 879, and discussion with Captain Beeher, ante, p. 380 and on. l\Iajor (p. 1\.IS) wrote: "Here I beg to call yoLir attention to the fact that Columbus neither lands upon nor giYes an~ name to the first island which he reaches after leaying Guanahani, a fact which argues its unimportance and sanctions our assuming it to be Rum Cay." The weight of these anthoritie:o; ma kPs it necessar~· for me to tr;y to answer them before I go on. The following paragrapl1 from the S1iauish text of tl1e journal is the authority upon which .Major and Captain IJecher fouud their assertion that Columbus did not land upon the second island (XaYarrete, 1st edition, p. 25, October 15, and ante, p. 358): "Y como dcsta isla vide otra mayor al Oneste, cargue las relas por andai· torlo . aquel dia fasta la 1wchc, porque aun no pudicrn haber andado al ca.bo de/ Oue8te.'' Major's translation (p. 198) is: "And as from this island 1 saw another larger one to the we:st, I started for the purpose of sailing the whole of that da.r until night, for otherwise I could not ha,·e reached the westernmost cape.'' Captain Recher (p. 109) renders it: ''And as from thi8 island l saw another larger one to the '1'estward, I made sail, continuing on until night; for a1' ;n~t I had not arriYed at the western cape." l\fr. Thomas's translation, which T haYe adopted, is: '' And as from this island I saw another larger one to the west, I c/cU"cd up tlte »ails, for I had gmw all that day until 11igbt, because I could not yet have gone to the western cape." The esse11tial diiil·rp11ce i,; with: ca.rgue hh~ velns. 1\Iajor makes it, "I started"; Captain Becher," I mad<' sail··: aml Thomas, "I clewed up the sails.'' In Dfol'ionario llfaritimo Espaiiol, etc., por D. ,To.~e de Loren::o, D. flon::alo de Murga, y D. Mnrtin Fcrrciro, Emplcado8 en la J>ireccion de Hidrogra;tiii, l\fadrid, 18ii.J., tlw dclinition agrees with that giren by l\Ir. Thomas. So of all other Spanish dictionaries wliiclt I can find. I have also submitted the phrase to Spanish officers with like result. The signification is, to clew up, or brail up; that is, take in sail. A similar expression occurs in the first part of the journal of .October 15: ''I had been standing off and on this night fearing to approach the shore for anchorage hefore morning not knowing whether the coa!lt would be clear of slioals, and intending t-0 clew up-cargar velas-at dawn." If he had been hove to all night he migl1t have written "I will make sail in the morning"; but its lte was standing off and on, the two clarnws-'' Fearing

to approach the shore for anchorage before morning," and "Intending to clew up at dawn", are connected, aucl the meaning of cargar velas in the latter is obviously to take in, not to make Rail. The proof that he stopped at the second island does not depend upon the signification of any one phrase, but upon the concord existing between the journal and the cartop;raphic facts. Col nm bus promised in bis Prologue (see Appendix D) that he would mark "each night my progress <lnring the day and eal'h da~· the rnn made during the night."' But it can b(' readily un<forst.ood that he ha<l no regular time for writing- his journal among the Bahamas, where tlrn rnrrigatiou is lliflicnlt and wJ1ern the ludians thronged upon him as coming fror:;1 heaven. This appears upon reading tlie remarks under October 11, the day before 1:1eeing Gnanahani. .All the journal of that da~- with the exception of thl~ first forty-seven lines-refers to transactions which took place on the 12th, a date omitted from the journal. From the closing paragraph of tlte 13th it seems that most of his Guauahaui log "llas written near sunset of that day. He says: "At this moment it is dark and all went on shore iu their canoes.'' The 14th waR written in the afternoon, during the leisure which came to him from bein~· at sea, clear of the laud and the inhabitant~. He wrote then: "I looked for the largest one and determined to make for it, a 11rl I am ,qo rloi11g.'' (1) It is important that 1 should call attention to the fact that all the journal of the 15th was certainl;y written on tlle Hith. He entered no remarks on the 15th. ruder this date, which was Monday, he wrote: "l anchored and rernained until to-rlay Tuesilaye) when at dawn I went on shore with the boats armed." Same date, farther on, 15th, he writes: "And soon after I stt sail for the other large island.'' He could not haYe done so except 011 the 16th, the day he wrote this. His stor.r in the journal of the 15th is certainly the experience of the 16th. .For example: near the close of the remarks of the 15th he writes: "And beiug in the Gulf midwa;y between these two islands rntmely that of Santa Maria and this large one, to wbich I giYe the name of la Fernandina." No one can fail to see that this circumstance, and tho8e irnme<liatel.r precediug it, belong to tlte Hitb, although fouud under date of tlie 15th. His journal of the 16th begins with tlte statement that he left Santa }faria for l<'ernandina about noon, an assertion repeated twice on the 15th, but which could not haYe been put into execution until the 16th. .A study of the jonrnal of the 15th and lGth shows that his first leisure was the afternoon of the 16th, in the calm weather lJetween the two islands, and then he wrote the journal of the rnth. That of tlie 16th wa8 not written until the lith, for he writes under the former date abont sending the ship's boat on shore for water at !) a. m.-certainly ou the 17th. A little later in the journal of the 16th he says: ''Soon after writing this I set sail with a south wind." .As he did not arrive at the island to which this refers until the morniug of the 17th, see first part of the journal of this day, it is obvious that it was of the llth-uot the 16th-that be was speaking. The stnd~nt who is attentive to the journal will notice that Columbus wrote it when he could ftnd time-to all appearance at one sitting· as a yery bmw sailor would do. This led him to set down often the matter of several days under one date, and he seems not to have oYerhauled his log to see whether it was at variance with itself. ltemembcring, then, that all the things done on the liith were recorded on the Hith-aftcr he had foft the second island-they might be put into a concise and truthful statement as follows: Columbus explorf·d Gnanahani in the boats before noon of the 14th, and sailed after noon to the southward aml we8twarcl, the direction of the gold. Many islands coming shortly into 8ight, he made for thf' largest, bnt did not reach it in time t-0 see the anchoring-ground before dark. 'I'he wind being light from the eastward, and a strong current running west, he Llecided to staml off and 011, beat to the eastward, to hold bis position during the night, that lte might anchor in the morning at that part of tlie island which lte had seen befot·e dark. The next forenoon, the 15th, lHJ found himself so far to the eastward U1at it was noon before he got bacli. Be ob:s:erved l wo sides of the island, one nortJ1 and south, five leagues; the other, east and west, over ten. He avproached the first, lmt a8 it was a lee-sltore he followed the other all the afternoon, arriving at the westem cape about sunset, whence he saw another large island to the west. Not wishing to be under weigh again at night, among the tides and currents, and the wind having canted to the southward an(l eastward, which gave him a weather shore to anchor under, he clewed up his sails and came. to. On the morning of the next day, the 16th, be went on shore to explore the island, but, as the wind increased from the S. E., and his ships were riding to ~ weather tide, they were liable to be set

He must bave llad a gale of wincl all the afternoon of the l:ith to have been driven at such extraordiuar_y speed; but there is no meutiou of it m tlie journal. His log across tbe Atlantic was I05t nautical miles a day, equal to 4.4 miles eYery hour. The hest day's run was October 4, .:W0.5 nautical miles, an aYerage of 8.4 each hour. Oolmnlms wrote on the Htlt of Oct~1ber, in respect to the second islaml: ·· I looked for the largeist one am1 determined to make for it, aml I am so doing."

Colmn lms wrote that one iisland taken possessiou ot~ the same may lJe said of all; but it was ltis dt·sire uot to pass any without taking posser<sion, and he 1lid uot. At'ter sailiny: from thiN island he wrote: ".And being· i11 th1· gulf mi1lway between these two islar111.~ uamely tllat of Santa Maria 11nd tl1is larg·e one, fo which I gave the name of f<'rrn11nrli11a.'' be found a man in a canoe who had couw '' fr()ln the island of San Salvador, had passed tu Hauta l\laria, aud was now going to la Fernandina,'' the very se11ne11ce he wais doing. All who arc mi11dfnl of tlrese facts fi'om the journal of tl1e 14tl1, lflth, an<l 16th of October, may group them better tltau this to suit their own mind, hut in every aspect they will outweigh the assertion that he did not stop at that stieond island which lw made for on the l4tl1, and strove for on t1ie 15th. Uolumhus andtored at tlw nortlrwtist cape of Orookell (Santa Maria), at sunset, Octoher 15, and remained until the followiug forenoon. He wrote: "An<l as from this island [ siiw another larger oue to the wei-;t, I clewed up the sails." It would appear from this paragrapl1 tl111t tlie island referred to came into view when he reached the west cape, near sunset. \Yriting of what took place the following fon·noon, he :said: " 1 set sail for the other large islaud that appearnd at tl1e west." He begins the 16th with, "About noon I left the i11lands of 8mita Jforia di' la Cmu·ep<'ion for the island <!t' Jilernanditta, which appears to hever;\· large to the west." l1oug lslau!l liet; :!5 miles west of Crooked, arnl the range of bills upon it, marked 150 feet higl1, are two miles fartlwr. The distance of visibility for 150 feet is H miles, aud for Columbus's lookout, of 60 feet, it is 8.8 miles; total, 22.8 miles. I u consequence l1011g Island cannot be seen from Crooked. I have alluded, on page 387, to probable physical changes among the 13ahamas in the past, but I shall not appeal to t.111,se here. Heamen understand very wPll that, in favorahlP circumstances, the appearance of land is very striking O\'er coral islands which are below the range of visibility from the observer. This is especially noticeable in the Bahamas, because all the necessary conditions are there: low islands of white coral; not enough trees or· uud.ergrnwth to hinder radiation; a lligli degree <>f heat,- ancl the air loadell with moisture. Wheu a faH of tempemtme l1appeus this is precipitated into a cloud cap which often covers the island like a l>lanket, and outlines it. It is this and S. Ex.12-50

the blending of cloud and land that makes the latter appear, frequently, to he above the lwrizon when truly lwlow it. (1) Columbus sailed from the northwest end of Crooked, October 167 eitl1er at 10 a. m. or noon, for he gin'8 hoth times, toward the isla11d wltic11 appeared in thP \\est. Calm weatl1er retanled him uutil daylight of the 17th, when he anchored at a cape of au island, which he named Femandina. Here, he said; the coai:;t ran north-northwest and south-southeast. On the way owr he estimated the distmwe from the se1·ond to tllc third island at nine league8. After he had arriycd he called it eight league8-:!ii.5 nautical mileR. A course from Crooked \V. 1 N. :!i> miles strikes a cape of J,oug Island where the coast line nmf' as given by Colnmhus. See chart and the sub-sketch of Long Islaml, the latter on a larger scale, which shows the mwe aud trend of laud more diRtiuctly. The appearance of Long falaud (Fernandina) from Crooked (Santa Maria), the cours11 and dis· . tance hetwee11 them, the southeast cape and the trend of the coast of Long Island (:Fernandina), all eouforrn a<·cnratel,v to the facti; and we need not linger upon them. At noon of the 17th of October, Columbus sailed from tl1is southeast cawi, steering along tlte shore tH t lw N. N. \\'.,"the wi111l being S. W. aml 8." V\'hen ht> was 1war tb11 end of the islaml "two leagm~s off" he fournl a marwllous port with two entrances formed by a rock~- islet in the rnid1lle. Both wer1' narrow, but within was ample room for 100 isbips, if there had been sufficient depth free from ohRtructioui,;, with a deep entrance. He was so much impressed with this 1imrvellous port that llf\ anchored outside of it and went in with all the boab; and sounded it and saw that it wa,; too shoal. This wa.s the ftrst opening into the land that he had met with and he thought it 11etokened a freish-water river, therefore he took in the water casks. His former visit to a tropical conntr.r was to Guinea (Africa) where all the openings into the shore am made hy fresh-water strearnR . . The wind was off the land, and he remained in this harbor with the boats, getting water, for two honn;, wlien be returned to the vessels anrl sailed. Colnmhns wrote that the eutrauce of this marvellous port was two leagues from the end of the island. The reader will observe how often the journal uses leagues and miles in such a wa~' that an interehange of them was possible on the Admiral's part and ver~- probable witl1 tlie copyist.( 2 ) If the two leagne8 of the journal were a clerical error for two Italian miles, it corre8ponds with the chart. See sub-8ketcb of Clarence Harbor, where tlw southeast entrance is two Italian mile8 (1.6 nautical mileis) from Booby Cay, the Yiflihle extremity of the island; and the course to the latter is X. W. He wrote that lie sailed on this coursP until µe discovered that part of the island which ran east and west; and afterward the Indians 1wrRuaderl lti111 to go back, aml because the wind ceased and then sprang up from the \\', X. \Y., which was contrary' t,o his course, he turned around. This aurl tlw subse<111eut courses point out that lie was following this east-and-west 8hore on a likely course of \V. N. \V. when the willd came on t aliead. After turning around be sailed all night, E. S. E., Hornet.iines H. and also S. E. to clear the Janel. He wrote that the atmosj)here was very misty and the weather threatening, but that tlw wind was li9ht and it did not permit bim to reach the land to anchor, and that it rained hard after midnight until almost day. He adds, "·We [are] at tbe soutlieast cape of the island where I hope to anchor until it gets clear." Ile closes the journal of the 17th with general remarks, wl1ich was l1i:o; fr<x1uent habit. It iR evident that be wrote thi8 paragraph, and the last observatious of tlie 17th, 011 the morniug of the 18th, at the southeast cape of the island, where, as he was Pxposed to rain,r weather and light winds, 'he desired to anchor.

These wonls imply. that be was at the cape from which be bad sailed the day befo1\>. Iu other words, that he had retraced his step8 as he wag advised to do, and getting hack tu a familim· and1orage, with unfavorallle conditions for coasting such shores, he wished to anchor and wait for clear weather. On page 3~)2 I have asked the student to take hred in adapting the dates i11 ('nlnmlms'R journal. The caution is necessary here. The log of the 18th of October opens with a clause which belongs to the remarks quoted above; for be sa~·s: ".After it cleared up I followed the wind"; the last of this date is, ".At dawn l set sail.'' It is enough to read the journal of the l!lth, which wm.; written hi the evening of this da_y, after a.rrii·ing at the rocky islet, to see that getting under way at tlawn of the l8tl1 rf'ferred to the Ramt' act done at dawn of the Hltl1. What he did or1 the lf\th ic; Hot obscure; shitting tides and i!lconstant winds hindered him from following the coast to a faxorahle anchorage. ThiR appears from· his remark on the 18th, I "went around the island as much at; l could, and I anchored when it was no longer possible to sail.'' 'Ve find recorded iu tht· journal certain physical characteristics concerning the second islaml wliich belong· tu Crooked oulJ'; aud in like manner is the tllird island estahhsllcd. This is so important that I brietly recapitulate. Col nm bus ancl1ore1l at a cape of the third "'·lwre thl' coast liue was north-northwe~t and south-southeast. He followed it N.

"\Yhen he enters the course ste\'rnd, the dt'pth of wat.er, the trend of the coast, and the speed of his vessel, these are fa.cf.ti which his daily duty calls for, and the safety of bis ship ma~· turn upon the accuracy of the record. Columbus';,; description of the Rhore-liues and harbor of the third island relate to ph;n·ical fads which lie oh· 8ervctl. The~· are his log, au cl they cannot he ignored. Jt, is essential, therntilre, that a I hird isla11d shall be found answering to this ile;;criptfon. The sub-skekh on the chart shmrn at a glance that the southeast part of Long Island is the only land and water that will fit. See uarratin of <:aptaiu Becher 17th and 18th of October, ant.e, for the entauglemeut arising from using auotlwr islarnl for the track of tl1esc two days. There is an ele1mmt of time· here whieh is iin11ort1i11t as it limits the ground pas:sl\ll on~r on the afternoon of the 17th. '!.'he Admiral left the southeast cape at noon and turned around while heading "\V. N. W., arnl then he steered an opposite courRe during the night, t-0 clear thl' land. It is fair to tit~lect snnset, 511 ·tom, as the. time. of his turniug. AR long as he 1~onld Ree tlw land and reefs he might, keep on, hnt not aft<:r dark. He would choose thP day only to explore new shores. In the uight he might retrace bis stl.'ps steering well off, or anchor, or heave to, or stand off and on, uot.hi11g else.

north end of Fortune llsland. See chart and sub-sketch of Crooked Island aucl10rages. The Admiral givf's no diRtances in sailing across. If he was fairl,v under way at 511 ~0"' and a11chored at lP 30", the time was 6 hours, half of which ht· steernd S. E. and half E., making E. 8. E. if ca.ch three hours was equal speed. Vrom the south end of Long Island to the uorth end of Fortune the course and distance are E. h;r S. ~ S. 32 nautical miles. This gives a little more than 5.3 miles an hour, which is fair sailing for his vessels. Oolumlms wrote on the e\'ening of the 19th that ihis rocky islet "lay from the island of Fernandina, whence I had come east [and] west, and the coast afterwards ran from the rocky islet to the westward, and therp was in it twelve leagues.'' If the last clause is an error for 12 Italian miles, it agrees with the chart, as the coast inclines from here two points to the west aml measures 10.5 nautical mile8, or rn.2 lta\ian mile8. Long faland is iuvisihle from the rocky islet, and the line between them is not east aml west. In steering from I,'ernandina Columbus spread his wssels from an E. to a S.S. E. coursr, to l,!Ct hold of the land; then lie drew them together on one course and afterward anchored. A hearing entered at this time with reference to an island no longer in sight, and from which they had arrived by steering several eonrses, might easily he 11 pointl' in error. J1'ortmrn is the fourth island of Columbus'R visitation, the one he 11amed aftPr that manful aml lovable queen, habela, who sent him on his way when kings and councils nijectecl him. ]t, will he noticed that the journal mak(·s the third islautl lie west of the se1~oml, ancl the fourt.h east of tlie third. This brings the second an<l fourth adjacent to eacl1 otJier, a8 tlicy arc found upon the chart. If a landsman thinks that tlw Admiral ought to have known that the land now north of him was the same which lay south on tl1c ernning of the 15th, it can he arniwereil trul~', that oue of the most perplexing things in the Yocatiou of the sea is tl1e recoguitiou of lauds or is lauds that have uo co11spicuous marks. Light-houseR, beacou11, and pilotage grew out of this difficult~" Columhm; sees the opposite side of CrookC'd, after an interval during whicb he was Jiarasl'!ed by navigating the shores of the third islaml. He comes in sight of it for the io;econd time, while skeriug a course opposite to that which he 1o1tured at first; and of all islandH to distinguii;h, one from the other, or th11 different sides, the Bahamas are the most puzzling, owing to their similarity. Irving, vol. i, p. 43;1, wrote of the Admiral: "On his second voyage returning from Ouha, he coastecl the southern side of his favorite island of Haiti without recognizing it until a ca.cique came off a.url addressed him hr his title and used several words of Castiliau. The news sprrarl joy throughout the ships.'' The mountains of Haiti are 9,000 feet higl1 and are easily recognized 11ow, for we know their height and have excellent maps; hnt Oolumlms was making discoveries where the islands seemed to be innumerable; he was not surveying, nor had he any instrument;; hy which he could lay down accurately the relative bearings of the lands. The first part of the journal of October 20 remark8 upon the failure of the vessels to get to the eastward of Isabella, either by the northeast or south, on account ofNhallow water. This agrees with the present eHrtography of Fortune Island. My position here derives strength from a statement in the journal of Non~m ber 20. NaV<irrete, p. 61: On this day the Admiral was 25 leagues-79.6 nautical miles-N. E. ~ S. from Puerto del Principe, a<lmitted to be the present Cuban port of Tanamo. The appendix chart has the 20th of November laid down at 75 miles only, arisiug from the use of 3 as a multiplier for leaguef.\ 1 instead of 3.1818. The Admiral said that on this day he was 12 leagues-38.2 uantical miles-from Isabella. From 11ere to Fortune Island, which I call Isabella, the distance is a6 miles; hut to Great Jnagua, Navarrete's Isabella, there are 60 miles; to Long Island, Irving's lsahdla, 67, and to Crooked, selected by Captain Becher, 53. The journal adds that he could have anchored at Isabella, but did not wish to, for fear that the Indians he had brought from Guanahani migh.t!-escape, a.s the distance between these two islands was but eight lea.gues-25.5 nautical miles. Fortune is 36 miles from Samana; Crooked and Watling, the Isabella and Gnanahani of Captain Becher, are 68 miles apart; Grand Turk and Great Inagua, the Isabella of Navarrete, are 101. At the beginning of October 24 Columbus sailed from the rock_y islet, at the north end of :E'ortune, on a predetermined W. S. W. course. The day was eharaet.erized by rain, calms, little wind, and then a ''lovely" breeze. At nightfall, 5h 36m, the southwest cape of Fernandina (Long Island) bore N. W. distant 22.3 miles. This is known at sea as "departure." The night of the 24th-25th he had strong winds with rain, and being on unknown ground he first reduced, then took in all sail. He said he had made much headway, of which he was doubtful, but he estimated. that he

At ~ p. m. th<' Admiral saw land. "There were 8even or eight island,;, all extending- from north to sontl1 ; distant, from them five leagues," 15.9 nautical miles. He anchored on the :!6th of Octoher in the shallow water south of these, which he called Sand Islands. The conr·Re and distant from the rocky islet to the south Rand island are vY. 8. W. 82 miles. Tlw same from the "departur«~''-night-fall of Octoher 24th-V{. S. W. Wi miles. The journal gives tlw following <listanct·s between ''departure" and Sarni falands: Xight of the 24th-21jtJ1, not t\rn lcag1ws. Fi Ye leagues to !la. m. on tlle 25tll.

The strain of a sea-faring lifo, from so tender au age, i;; not cmulucin- to literary exactrn·sR. Still, for thC' very reason of this i;ea t>xperience, the "log"' slwnlcl lH· 1·01TP4't.

SUM)1ARY.

Fir8t. Thrm iR no objection to Samana in I'f\speet to Rize, pm~itiou, or shape. Thnt it i>< a little iRlaud, lying east and west, is iu iti-; favor. The erosion at the eaRt eud hy which islets h:n-1· heen formed, recalls the assertion of Columbus that there it could lw cnt off iu two da~·s arnl ma<fo into an island. The Nassau vessels still fiud a snug anchorage here during the N. E. rradPI'. '.l'heRe blew lialf a gale of wind at tile time of tl1e land-fall; yPt :XaYarrete, \'amhal-!·en, arnl <~aptain Bee her unchorNl the isquadrou on the windward sides of tlw coral 1·e(·fo of their J'('liJ1t'diYt' islands, a ''lee shore." (See 01e eh art.) '.l'he absence of permanent lag-00118 at Sanmna r Im n' tried to explain on p. a87. Second. The course from Samana to Crooked is to the sontliwel't, which is the dirP,ctio11 t lrat the Admiral said be sLould steer "to-morrow eveuiug." The distance gh·eu hy him correspornls with the chart. Third. The second iisland, Santa Maria, is described as having two sides which made a rig;ltt, angle, and the length of each is given. 'I'!Lis points directly to Crooked and Acklin. Hoth form one island, so fitted to the words of the journal as cannot be done with any other larnl of tlw Bahamas. Fourth. Tlie course and di,;bmce from Crooked to Long Island is that wl1ich tlie Admiral giws from Santa Maria t<> Fernandina. Fifth. Long Island, the third, i,:; accurately described. The trentl of the i;hores "11ortli11orthwest and soutlt·southeast"; the" marvellous port" and" the coast which runi< east [aml] Wl'l't," can nowhere be fomHl except at the southeast part of Long Island. Sixth. The journal is obscure in regard t-0 the fourth island. 'l'he 1.Jest wa.r to foul it, is to "plot" the courses foru·ard from t.be third island, and the courses and distances b1(ckward from tlw · fifth. These lead to Fortune for tiie fourth. Seventh. The Ragged Islands are the fifth. These he named las is las d<> A rena-8a111I lslarnls. They lie 'V· S. W. from the fourth, and thhi is the course the Admiral adhered to. Ht> did not" log" all the run made between these islands; in consequence the "log" falls short of the triw clistauce, as it ought to. These "seven or eight islandfi, all extending from uorth to sontli,'' am! having shoal water "six leagues to the south" of them are seen on the chart at a glance.

The westerl.r cnrnmt, tile deptll of wat~ll' at tlrn entrance of Padre, arnl tlle general description, are free of 11ilticultiei,;. The true distance is greater than the "logged'' because Columbus again omits part of hil-l nm. It would he awkward if the true distances from the fourth to the fiftl1 islamls, and from the latter to Padre, had fallen short of the "log," since it would make the uncx:plaiuable situation which o(·.curs iu lrviug"s course and distance from Mucaras Heef to Boca de CaraYela (<tnfo, p. 3i:J ).

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

I notice that, writers multiply f.he leagues of Columbus by 3 and call the product a geographical mile. :Hy search for accuracy, and to see where the multiplier 3 was obtained, is not conclusive. Hear-Admiral ,Jolm Hodgers, superintendellt of the United States Naval Observatory, after gidug tht.' !'lnl~ject some investigation, is of OJ)inion that the ancient J{oman or Italian mile was 1,GU English ;rnnls. An article in the Penny Cyclopedia (Mile and League) written by Augustus De :Morgan, lat!' professor of mathematics in University College, London, calls the ancient Italian mile 1,GH Engfo;h yards. llnrnholdt discns;,;es the subject of leagues, miles, and degrees in his Histor.11 of the "Kew Continent (note, vol. ii, p. 216) without bringing their leugtli tn any malispntP1l measnre. So with P1gafettn (1h1atise oii lfa~·igation, 1>· 21f>). 1\fartin Cortes, Brevl' Compcnilio ile la "-"1J1iera, d:c., Seville, 1551, English translations, 15Gl, folio xix, has this table: 4 grains of barley make a fiH{!.'er. 4 fingers a 11aml or palm. 4 hauds a foot.. 5 feet a geometrical paRRU8. 2 steps makP a passus. 12ti pa;;Rus a fnrlong, Ol' stadium (ol<l English furlongs long)(1). 8 forlong1-; one mile. 1 mile is 1,000 lJaSSUS. 3 miles one league; in Germany longer leagues; France, 1."i leagues to one degree; Spain, lGi leagues and 17~ fi1r a degree of the Great Circle. Pedr() Ile l\fedina, Llrte ite Ravcga, Valladolid, 1545, prefers 4 miles to a league. l'igafatta says, " shore leagnef\ .'.) miles; nautical, 4.''
011 the Hth of December, 14!J2, Columbus was at the present Bay of Acul, Hayti. The journal read1' (Xararretc, Yo!. i, p. 84): Estc piterto t'iene en la boca mil pa~ws, ques un cuarto de legua" 'l'be harbor here iR about a thousand paces, or a quarter of a league wide at the rnontb." It is 1wident that with Las Casas 4,000 "pasos" was a nautical league. By using the table above and tlw not<· below, this league is found to he 20000.64 En~liali feet. Smee the Italian mile of Admiral Rodgers and Professor De Morgan is 1,614 yards, or 4,842 feet, a]l(l Columbus called four of these a league, this war; l!J,368 English feet, which differs 63~.64

fed only from that derived from Las Casas's remark and Martin Cortes's table. In the computations of this paper I call the mile of Columbus 11614 yards or 4,842 English fe(·t, and his league G,45G yards or 10,368 Eng]islt feet. For the geographical or na11tical mile or lrnot, I have adopted Clarke's stimate of one minute of arc on the equator, rejecting a small decimal. Tltis ilS '..!,O'..!!l yards or 6,087 English feet. Wherever I have omitted to designate the kind of mile this is the one meant. I haYe tried to prove these measures by comparing them with some of the dista11ee1:1 given in the journal, hut the result is unsatisfactory. .Allowing 3 leagues departure frorn St. Se\Jastian (Gomera), he sailed, according to his log, 1,111 leagues to Guanahani, = 1178.;)g of Clarke's leagues, or 3,535 nautical miles, 3,458 on a straight course. Cat Island is the farthest landing ascribed to him. It is 3,141 miles from Gomera, an overrun of 317 miles. The Grand Turk is the nearest, 2,834 miles; a difference of 624. In Dr. Chanca's narrative of the second voyage of Columbus (Navarrete, vol. i, p. 200) 1 the distanee sailed from Ferro t-0 the first land, Dominica, h; called 800 leagues, 2545.5 nautical miles. The true distance is 2,520. He remarks that it is 300 more between Ferro and Cadiz, equal to 954.G nautical miles, but the true distance is 774.

December 5, 1492, the journal has 120 leagues-381.8 miles-for the distance lie coasted C11ha. From Boca de Gull;jaba, where he probably turned, to Cape Maysi, the coai;t line is :.!H miles. In giving a summary of his first voyage to Luis de Santangel, Navarrete, vol. i, p. ms,< 'olurnbm< wro1(· that he followed the coast of Cuba for 107 leagues-340.5 miles-and the coast of la Espaitola for 178 "grandes leguas." If these are like the other leagues they equal 5G6.~) miles. The trur 1lista11cP, along the coast-line of Hayti, between St. Nicolas Mole and Samana Ba_y, is 38G miles. Arnlres Berna.Ides, ]}fuss. Hist. Col., vol. viii, 3d series, p. 6, said that Columbus went 8P. leagnet-i-280 mile;:;in a straight line from west to east, along Ha.yti. The na\'igator of these shores still fi11ds the same currents and baffiing winds; but he is spared such crron; of distance, because of the pertecti'ou of chronometers and of nautical instruments. Uolumbus wns very correct in estimating the sl10rt runs. He called it ten leagues from Navidad to Isabella, on the north side of Hayti. This is the true distance. Considering tbc guesswork in the distances among the Bahamas, he was surprisingly accurat,e. aic; I have show11 in the discussion. 'l'aking the mile of Columbus at 4,842 feet, his estimate of the circumference of the globe was Hl227.3 nautical miles. Clarke's circumforcnce, at the equator, is 21,uOO nautical milt·R, {~acl1 6087.11 English feet. The earth was larger around by 33 per ceut. than Columbnti l1diPn·11.

VARIA'.l'ION OF THE CO)IPASS IN 1492.

Iu Captain Becher's La1idfall of Columbus, A ppcndix, ll· 331, is this: "In laying dmrn tlie track of Columbus from the Crooked Island group, named in the chart the Fragraut Isles, from tlu· journal of the .Admiral, it becomes eYident from llis courses and distances, run as far as Cuba, that it was necesHary to allow a considerable amount of Yariation. Iu his first n1.vage he meutiouel1 iu his journal tbat lte found aboye a point of wester}~· yariation, 011 a meridian a lrnudretl kagneH west of the .Azores, and in his third voyage, when he is on the coast of I>aria, he also meutiom; having fouud, to the surprise of the pilots, aboye a point and a halt A.11d now that his <·om·ses aml distances run tu an anchorage in the bank specified as being at the distaueP of fh-e leagues from the Arena isles, and from thence to Cuba, it may be safelJ said that the rnriatiou which Ile found there in 14\12 amounted to little 8hort of two points wester!~·.'' .All that Columbus wrote in re8pect to the deviation of the needles referred to his obserrntions on the Atlantic duriug his first Yoyage.

In an Euglish trmml~ition ( CoUectioii of Voyages and Trav<1l.~ l1y CkurekiU; I,ondon, 1732, vol. ii, p. iiR7) is tl1is: "Yet t.bc Admiral says he could not from thiR tinw give such an account ar,; he would wish, because through overmuch watching his eyes were inflamed awl therefore he was forced to t.ake most of his obserYations from the sailors aucl pilot8.

mouth only, and that their sea day begins at noon of the eivil day. Until 1847 the English and United States naval service kept the usual civil day in port, but at sea the day began at noon, twelYe hours before the civil day. It is not dear what day Columbus used. His prologue seems to refer to the ancient sacred !lay of the ,Jews, or that of the Church, beginning at sunset. The Athenians, Chinese, Italians, and others reckone<l by this. Reading, carefully, all his log, I find days which might furnish arguments for his use of the present ciYil day, or that he might have counted either from noon to noon or sunset to sum;et. In this paper I shall consider that he used the present, wa;y, midnight to mid· nig-ht. The island of Gomera, from which Oolumbns sailed, is 14 by 11 miles, nearl;1- a round mass of mountain, rising to 4,400 feet. The harbor of St. Sebastian lies a little south of the east end, and hy "Bowditch's N avigato1'" is placed in latitude ~so 6' north, longitude i 70 8' west from Greenwich. After he had len this port he was becalmed until Saturday night, when the first course "loggwl" is 'W, Since some departure must be allowed to clear the land, I have put down 3 leagues S. ·w. ;! \V., barely enough to enable him to begin a 'IV. course. I do not know whether he went south or north of Gomem; I make his course south, because the prevailing winds there are from the northward and eastward. Tlte most western island of the Canaries is the one called Hierro by the Spanish, and Ferro hy the Portugllcse. The parallel of 210 44' north, and the meridian of 180 west from Greenwich, pass through the middle of the island. This latter was the " prime meridian" from Ptolemy until the last century. Hierro is 34. miles S. \V. by "\V. ~ W. from Gomera. Columbus left St. Sebastian 'l'lmrsda;y morning, Septem her 6, 1492.

Allowing for the detention by calms in the Canaries, departure, and difference of time, he was 33~ days from Gomera to Guanahani. In the above log I have not copied his daily remarks during the Yoyagc, for they have no bearing upon this discussion. I have, however, noted that he neYer deviated from his Ilreddermincd west course, unless constrained by head winds, baffling winds, or the strong appearance of land to the southward and westward. And the student will take 11otice that, notwithstanding the observations in regard to the westerly variation, on tlie 13th, the 17th, and the 30th of September, t11e Admiral did not alter his courses in order to make true west, but that he held firmly to 1f'est by <~01111Ja SS.

A law to be established for tounag·e admeasurct1te11t would have reference only to cargo, and that iu its simplest consideratiou, name!,\·, the greatt·st weight which a YCflRd could safol:-;· carry." l\Ioorsom says that the first official measurements of l.'essels were of those carrying coal, and the <late 14'.!:!; that in 16!14 a government official marked the draft with nails 011 tlw stern aml Rtern, h:-· first loading to those marks by a dead weight or tin or lead. Iu 17::!0 the Eug·lish Parliament. urnkr the influence of competition of tltc tounage dues being e\aded by small \essel::; bringing SJ>irit::; into the kingdom, passed this general law for tonnage: "The length of tbe keel (so much as sl1P trends on the ground) is to be multiplied hy the inside midship breadth and the wbole divided h~· 114: the quotient is to be considered the true contents of the tonnage." B~- acts of 1773 the extrenw or external breadth was substituted for the internal breadth; the leHgtlt of tht> kt>el to be tbreefifths of the extremP breadth, deducted from the length from the fro11t of thr stc>m to the aft Ride of the stem post. This law remained in force until the admeasurement of the cubic contentR was substituted, by England in 183::i-18;)5, and the United States in 1864. In the fifth volume of Pepys' }lfiscellany, p. 57, date 1652, the dimeusions of the Gre~Jiound are giYen: Length ofkeel,60 feet; breadth, 20 feet 3 inches; deptb,10 feet; burthen, l~ll tons; me11, 80; gnus, 18. This ve8sel was in the old wai· which began in :1652 7 and in Pep~·s' Memoirs relating to the state of the rm...-y in 1688, this Yessel was then at sea. If we apply the act of Parliament of 1 i20 t.o the dimensions of this vessel, subtractiug J .li5 foet from breadth as au allowance for thickness of sides, to obtain inside breadth, tlte n'sult is l:!O tons, which shows that the act of 1720 !mly cotiji1·meil the usage of 1652. Applying this act t-0 .Ja1's ··essel of 27"' 77c length, aml 8"' 12< hreadtlt, we liave a Yessel 91 foot long, 75 feet. keel, 20~f-2 beam, and 1:1 feet hold, mea.suring 2:-1-1 tmrn, manifestly too largl· for Columbus's flag sliip. Spain exported wine in the fifteenth ce11tury, as now, and the old English expression of a tuu of wine meant two pipes, 252 gallons, each g-allon=231 cubic inches. Taking- a gallon of wint' at 8.3.3 pounds, this makes a ton only :?,orn1 pounds, but the difference to reach :!,240 \"l"a8 probabl,y au allown.nce for tbe interstiees of the casks. If the ship used by Columbus on his first Yoyage waR called either hy him or his contemporaries, in round numbers, 100 tons, it was iirohably the expression of the dimensions of Ycssf'ls which tm<lcll to England with wine and paid tonnage dues there, which wa8 a specifk sum for every tun of wine imported into the kingdom.

1652, which agree, are used to find the dimensions of the hundred-ton vessel a1;;cribed t-0 Columbrn1, we get: length on deck, li3 feet; length of keel, 51 feet; extreme breadth, 20 feet; inside hreadth for tonnage, 18 feet 6 inches: depth of hold, 10 feet, and draft of water, 10 feet 6 inches. These make a yessel of lOOH tons. Tlw rig of the Santa Maria is mentioned in the journal of October 24 (,Yal!arretc; p. 3!1, arnl ante, p. :n1) and this i,; all tht· information I can find hearing upon the subject. Oolum bus wrote : "I carried all the sails of t!IP ship, the main sail, and two bonnets, the fore sail, and sprit-sail, and the mizen, and the main top Rail." Tilis omission of a foretop sail seems strange to our nautical ideas, but vessels similarly rigged arc to be seen on the map-Ortelius, Tlieatrmn Orbis Terraruin, 1570. Sprit-sails have been dispensed with in modern times, only since the steeve of bowsprits has heen lesilcned and the size of jibil increased. I finished a cruise around the world in the United State8 brigantine Dolphin, which had a length from front of thP 8tem, under bowsprit, to inside of stem post of 88 feet; breadth of beam outside, 25 feet; inside, 23; depth of hold, 10 feet; draft aft, 10 feet; forward 8 feet, including the keel, which was 1 foot() inches. B_y Pep~'s' dimensions and the act of 1720, the Dolphin woulu be :J05 tons. Her armament was two 9-pounders and eight 24-pound carronades. Officers and crew, 70. Foretop masthead 71 feet fi inches above the water, and maintop masthead 81 feet 6 ind1es. I assume for the mastbeail lookout of the admiral's ship a height of 60 feet above the sea. His vessel probably carried four anchors and they all used hemp ca.bles. February 20, at the Azores, returning from his first voyage, he mentions that the cables were chafed off by the rocks and be put to sea. Fourth voyage-Major, p. 194: "l anchored at an island where I lost at one stroke three anchors. * * * The single(1) anchor that remained to me." They had pumps-M~jor, p, 195: "With three pumps, and the use of pots and kettles, we could scarcely, with all hands, clear the water that came into the ship." Rudderfi.-The ancient way to steer was with two large paddles, one thrust through a port, on cacil quarter. 'l'hc hinged rudder had come into use in Oolum bus's time. (See figure of a shi11 with both, in Peregrinatio ad Terram Sanotam, of Breydenbach, Mentz, 1486.) Boat.s.-From a careful study of the narrative and words of Columbus I infer that his vessel and also the caravels each had but one boat. Oct,ober 14 (ante, p. 357): 11 At dawn I ordered the boat of the ship." " 7 hen his \S8el was wrecked, on Christmas eve, 1492, the journal of December :!5 says that the boat was got out to lay an anchor astern, but deserted to the Nina, whose commander sent it back with his own to render assistance. It appears from the journal of January 2 that the Admiral left to the colony of Navidad, among other things from the Santa Maria, "the boat of the ship." In the narrative of Diego Mendez-Major, p. 220-Mendez wrote with respect to the capture oi' the boats of the caravels in a river in Veragua, that the three vessels of thll Admiral were at sea without boats, which would have been unlikely if any one had carried a spare boat, On his fourth voyage-Jfojor, p. 177: "The ship which we had the greatest fear for had put out to sea for safety and rcacl1cd the island of Gallega, having lost her boat and a greater part of her provisions." "\Vhen he was at the Azores, February 19, on bis return voyage, the Portuguese governor seized the boat and half the crew of the ~ifia, who were on shore at their devotions, and the Admiral got under way in his vessel to open a view of the town, to see what had become of it. There is a decided difference of opinion in enumerating the number of persons with Columbus on hiR first voyage. Ferdinand Columbus wrote that 90 went in the three vessels; Peter Martyr and Guistiniani, 120; ,Jal, p. 228, that he left at Bohio 55 men, and returned to Spain with about 125, making 180 in all; Las Casas, Nai·arrete, vol. i, pp. 121-122, that he left in the island of Espanola, which the Indians called Bohio, thirty-nine men; Diego de Arana, Pedro Gutierrez, Rodrigo Escovedo, "with all the powers he held from their Highnesses." A notary and constable, carpenter and caulker, gunner and machinist, cooper, physician, and tailor, "and all, he said, that men of the sea." This enumeration makes 48; but the true one is probably given in Navarrete (vol. 2, p. 19): 40 men and the 3 lieutenants, or 43 in all. In the journal of December 26, 1492, we notice that after the shipwreck many of the crew asked the Admiral for permission to remain until his return

from Spain, and on tlie 2d of January it is recorded tliat he left with them all the goods sent for trafficking, and everything belonging to the wrecked vessel, besides biscuit and wine for a year, and provisions. ·we learn from Jl{ajor, p. 82, that his stores comprised biRcuit, corn, wine, pork, and isalt beef. Bernaldez says he took ten Imlians with him to 8paiu. l\lartin Alonso Pinzon had deserted witl1 the Pinta before the shipwreck, and, since ColnmlluB belieYed him to be on his wa~· to 8pairh he acted as though be bad only the little Xiila with which tu fiuish the vo.rnge. In these circumstances it is a reasonable belief that, on account of space, if for no other reason, he rnust June left at Kavidad at least as many persons as composetl the crew of the wrecked vessel. February l!J, at the Azores, he sent half of the crew of the ~iifa on shore to perform a YOW in a churc!J; one boat from tlris vessel, which was the smallest of his s1prnuron, took all. This implies tl!at the crew must have been few. These facts versuaue me to ado1lt tlu· euumeratio11 of Ferdiuantl Columbus, 90 persons for the three wissels. 'rhe i11scriptio11 iu tlte pavement of the cathedral of Seville is: " Con tres galeras y 90 persona8." Neither Spain nor America has founded any enduring memorial to Christ-0plter Columbus.

dfrections and at the request of the Hou. G. Y, Fox, I Jiaw exami1w(l i1fto the 1mbject of tlie probable amount of tile magnetic declination (comm011ly ealle<l "yariatiou of ctmipa..,;;'') off the eastern coast of the Bahama Islamb, at the time of Columlms' approach in LHJ:!. Tbe im·cstigatiou iH based upon such extracts from Columlms' journal ar; were furni;;hml me hy l\Ir. Fox and iuclmle8 whatever ot1er information I could obtaiu bearing upon the sul\icct. In,, lnfof' interview I had with :\Ir. Fox (:\larch 31), I took occasion to expres8 my conviction of the impoHsillilitJ· of llrriYing at any yery definite conelu8ion, partly on account of the extremely srnnty material aR to facts and partly ill comwquellce of the want of a1;sistance derfrable from pnrel~- theoretical grounds; the cause of the phenomenon of the secular change of t,hc rnag;1mtfo dl~clination being <]ltit1· 11nkno\Yll and the time comparntivel;y 8hort dur.ing whic1 to trace the law of clmuge as hitberto observed. It will therefore not be surprising to find my couclu;:;ion giYen iu tile form of a reasonable conjecture rather than as a definite result. The pret:Jent state of our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism (loes uot appear to admit of a definite answer; be1;itle1J, there are diflicultics in the admission of certaiu evidence gi.-eu lJy Feruamlo Colon. Before eJJtering upon the subject proper I beg to submit a fow remarks iu repl,r to a question hl·ariug_ upon tlie early use of the compas8 and upou navigation towards t1e close of tlie fifteenth ce11tury. ltespecting the ancient use of the magnetic needle or compass, on land and at sea, among tJ.w Chinese, with wlwrn the practice originated, accounts will be found iu Humlloldt's Cosmos, vol. ii (Trarnslatiou L.r Otte, Londou, 1849), and ill the Encyclopmdia Britannica (9th edition) Yo!. vi, IS77, art. Compa;;s; tuern is also an extended account in the E11c,yclop:edia of Experimental Pltilosopl1y, Loudon, 1848 (part of the Encycl. J\fetrop'a.). B. F. De Costa, in a paper read Lefore the Anwr. Geographical Society (l\Iay, 1880), aPJicars to ham made certain extracts from the al1ove wmks, Yiz., p. U: ·':Secker (probabl,y the same as Alexander Neckam-Sch.) abbot of Cireucester, who llie<l in Ul 7, was acquainted with the u8e of t1e compass. Are J<1rode, in 1068, speaking of the Yisit paid to Iceland b,y Flocke Vilgerderson, says in those times seamen had no loadstone in tl1e northern countries. ln the fourteenth century Barber (Rarllour) says of the party accompanying King 1'ollt\rt of S1·otland from Arrau to Carrick, 'they na nedil hatl na stane/ showing that these aidl'l to wi,·igation were then familiar to seafaring men." '.1.'he curious story about oue Peter A<18iger, of 1:.!6H, is satisfactorily disposed of in 'Yalkcr'8 'l'errestrial au<l (;osmical :Magnetism, Caml1ridge (Euglanrl ), 1866. lie shows that no such person lived. The works quoted aboYe ahm coni ain historical accounts of the compass during the middle ages. Flavio tlic~ja, a Neapolitan, in 1302, mounted liiH needles on a pivot an<l diYided his compass iuto oetautR; l10wever, needles placed on a piYot and carried on board ship were already referred to in tlH· twelft1 century (Alex. Seckam). In the sixteenth century compasses were divided into degree/'! and 1mn-i<led witlt sights (remarks of the Portuguese pilot, Alexis da l\fotta, alJont 1575), arnl before 1525 l·'elipe Guillen, an ingenious apotliecary of Seville, constructed tbe fust variatiou compa8s (Cosmo:,;, vol. ii). Beferring to the times of Columbus, his compasRes were probably divided into 11oi11ts of 111° and half poiutii (quarters could be estimated). T1e distances sailed ornr were most probably esti· mated by hirn, since, recording to Humboldt, the Aclmiral did not employ tl1e Jog-line; time he 111easnrt~d by menus of 11alf-hour sancl-glasses, and for his determination of position of the ship he probably u.~e<l the astrolalJe, just improved by Martin Be1aim (who live<l at Lisbon, between 14-80

Humboldt asserts that the Admiral certainly carried with him Tosrnmelli's <.'.hart, sent him in 1477. Tl1e following information and remarks I received from l\lr. Fox, um1er date of April 1, 1881 : "Personal Karrath'e of the first yo~·age of Coluwhus to America, tra1111lated by Samuel Kettell. Published b;y Thomas B. 'Vail & Sou, Boston; G. C. Car.-ill, K. Y. and Carey & Lea, l'hila., 1827. "Pages 18, 19: 'September 13, 149:!. At the flrnt of the evening of this day the needles rnried to tlte N. vV., and the next morning about as much in the same direction. '"September 17: The pilots took the sun's amplitude and found that the needles varied to tlw N.

"'It seems incomprehensible that the obsen·ations of the next morning slwwed no dedi11ati011, uules:-; Columbus tampered with the card as he did in 1459-'63. (See lrYing's Columbus, nwised edition, 1854, vol. 1, p. 30.) "On tbe 13th of September he was 224 leagues (672 geographical miles) west of Gomera, one of tlrn Canaries, which Bowditch places in latitude 28° 06' north, longitude 17° 08' "·est. On the 17tl1 be had gone 300 leagues west of Gomera, or 1 080 geographical miles. Thence he went to the Balrnmas, uortheast coast of Cuba, north shore of Sau Domingo (Haiti) and home without again mentioning the declination of the compass. "Thougb bt· made three more voyages to the vVest Indies, the seeoml from 14U3 to 149G, thir<l from 1491-i to L'iOO and last from 1502 to 1504, 11t· writes of the dt>clination of tbe compa"s 011 the thinl YOJ·ag·1~ only, as follows-Select letters of Uolnmbus, 2d edition, translated and editt>d 11~· H. H. Ma,ior, Loudon, 1870; printed for the Haklu~·t Societ~-, p. 131-' I remarked that from north to soutl1 i11 trarnrsing· these hundred leagues (300 geographical miles) from the said islandc; (~\.zorcs) tlle ueedle of the compass which hitherto had turned toward,; tlie ~.

"In the I1andfall of Columbus, by A. B. Becher, captain R. ~., London, 185G, Ap,pendix, pp. 330-337, are extended remarks about the declination. Captain BechPr claims 2 points westerly declination iu 149~ for the Bahama Islands. Columbus' remarks on the declination in his third voyage do not refer to the coast of Paria but t-0 the route west of the line of 100 leagues west of the Azores.'' Under date of April 2, Mr. Fox writes: "I have found Captain Becher's authority for saying that Columbus discovered 1~ points westerly variation on the 16tl1 of ~~ngust, 1498. In Collection of Voyages and Travels, by Churchill, London, 1732, vol. ii, p. 587, is the following extract from Ferdinand Columbus' life of his father: '"Yet the Admiral saJ'S he could not from this time give such an account of it as he would wish, because through overmuch watchiug his eyes were inflamed, and tlwrefore he was forced to take most of his observations from the sailors and pilots. He also sa~·s that this same night, hcing Thursday, the 16th of Aug11st, 1498, the compasses which till now had not \'aried, did at thi;.: time at least a point and a half aml some of them two points, wherein there could be no mistake because several persons had always watched to observe it. Admiring at this and grieved that he liad uot the opportunity of followiug the course of the continent, he held on ~. ·w. till on MomlaJ· the ::!Otli of Aug. he came to anchor between Beaca and Hispauiola.' "This declination seems to have been determined, August 16, the da;y after he left thP coast of Paria, at a place where the island of Margarita bore west. The east poiut of tllat island lly

Bowditch is in latitude mo [)9 1 north, longitude G4° 30' west. Ferdinand has been accused of many misstatements and errors of date. His history has never been found. All translation!'! are from an Italian cop;y. Colu111lnrn, as I luwe quotecl to ;you from his third voyage, refers, in 1-lpeaking of the deelination, to what lw discovered 100 leagues west of the Azores in his .find voyage. I think, therefore, that Ferdinand wrote from memor~~, uot lrn,\'ing hi8 father'R letter before him, which we have. Be was not a sailor. He sa.rs, until nmr the compasses had not varied. Uolumlms was about Paria from the ht of August, and yet he says they did not vary until the Hith. AR we lmve Colmnlms' own letters of this voyage wherein he speak;; of the declination, I thiuk we cannot sa,v that there was 11 pointK ("~.) declination on the coast of Paria in 1498." Returning to the Admiral's remarks in his first YO~'age, we rna,r he eertain of the fact that on September 13, 1492, he had reached far enough to the westward to come from a previously eastern dedinatio11 within a region of westerly declination and that on September 17 it amounted to a whole point (llio). 'l'his constitutes his well-known discovery of a part of a line of no-declination. Two hundred and twenty-four leagues, or near enough for our purpose, 672 nautical miles west of the island of Gomera would place him on September 13, in latitude 28° OW north and in longitude 130 J2 1 +170 08'=;29° 50', according to Rowditch, or if we take the position of the harbor of Sebastian near the eastern point of Gomera Islaml, according to admiralty chart No. 1873, viz, la~itude 21.;o 05'.5 and longitude 11° 06' ..3 and considering that 11° 12' correspond to 12° J2' of differeuce of longitude in that latitude, we have for a point in the line of no-declination the latitude 230 05' and longitude 2!l0 18'. In E. 11\alker's treatise on Terrestrial and Cosmical Magnethsm, Cambridge (Eugland), 186G, }). 300, we read: ·'The history of this line dates from the 13th of September, IJ9:.!, wlrnn Columbus obsen·ed the needle pass from the east to the west of the meri<lian iu latitude 28° N., longitude 28° W." (probably roughly adding 11° of difforeuce of longitude to 170 for lougitude of Gomcra). According to my computation of the daily position of the .t.dmiral's tlagship and based upou his log-hook, he was on Septewber 13 in latitude 28° 21', longitude 290 lG'. It is evident that the extrad from thP third voyage is hut an amplification of his first account and expresses his condction that west of the Azores, where the declination was a little easterly it changed to the westward, being nearly zero at Corvo and gradually increasing to one point or 11o W. at a distance of 300 nautical miles ·w. of the longitude of Corvo. Tlw po8ition of Rosario on the S. E. part of the island of Corvo is, according to the Carta Esfcrica de las Islas Azores, "Iadrid, 1855, in latitude 390 41' and longituue 240 53' we8t of San Fernando, or in 310 07' west of Greeuwich (acconliug tu the Couu. de;; Temps), 100 leagne8 or 800 nautical miles west of this longitude would correspond (in btitude 28°) to 50 40' and would bring the Columbus line in longitude 36° 47' \V. According to my computation of the daily track, Columbus was on Septem!Jer 17, 1492; in latitude 27°"38' and in longitude 3G 0 30', when he noted 11° west declination. The staterueut of Humboldt, in Cosmos, Yol. ii (Otte editiou) p. G57, is that 2~0 east of Corvo the variation changed from E. to ·w. on September 13, 1492, he thus appears to take the longitude uf Corvo as 310 and that of Columbus' position as 28~ 0 . Though the accounts transmitted may admit of different interpretations there can be no question as to the fact of the discovery of a part of the line of no.declination passing towards the close of the fifteenth century from the vicinity of the Azores southward. At that time there was east declination at I>alos, Spain, also at the Canaries and the eastern Azores. There was at that time but a slight westerly (not more than about 1~0 ) declinatiou at Paris, France, as may he seen from m,y discussion of the observations made at Paris between 15!1 ancl 1869 (see" Secular ehange of the rnaguetie declination," Appentlix No. 9, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report of 1879, which is illustrated by a diagram herewith reproduceµ). Thus, the aguuic line of 14!)2 must have passed a short dii;tauce to the south of Paris, France. ln the Cosmos, as quoted a!Jove, Humboldt remarks: "The great Spanish navigator has not only the merit of having discovered a region in the Atlantic Ocean where, at that period, the magnetic meridian coincided with the geographical, but also that of having maJ].e the ingenious observation that mag· uetic ,-ariatiou might likewise serve to determine the ship's place with respect to longitude. In the journal of the second voyage, April, 149G (on his home voyage), we ftndltirn trying to determine his position by tl1e observed declination.'' Such au idea might well be entertained in an age when but the rudest means were available to the navigat-0r for finding his longitude and when the course of the itiogonic lines was but little underst-0od; this idea is well known to have been revived in later times.

The course of the agonic line of 1492 towards the southwest is very uncertain, aR it nm st entirely rest on the value we assume for Paria; and whether we accept the. above circumstantial ~ccount given hy Fernando in connection with Columbus' third Yoyage, or whetLer we re:ied it as .-rigne and nnrelfable, our conclusion as fotbe declination in the West India lslands must in a great measure depeu<l on it. .Mr. Fox disposes of tlle matter in a very summary manner aud while I reach the sauH' conclusion, Yiz 1 that in all prohability tliere waR no west declination in that part of South America in 1492, I Teach it on different grounds. If we accept tlie Paria observations it would 1wcessitate a declination of not less thau '.! poinh w1·st for the Bahama Islands. Heferring to the accompanying chart of the N ortb At.lautic, showing the more or less probable vositiont; of the agonic line for different eaTly centuries. that for li>OO (answering equall:;· well for 1-Hl2) ha.., heen laid down from the evidence cited in this paper, but its southwesterl,Y conrse wouhl eitlier pass into the region between the Orinoco and Amazon Uivers, if Fernando'8 account waR trnstworth~·, otherwise it would pass towar1ll' the Greater Antilles, as I conjecture it did. Looking oycr the records and deunctions for the secular change of the declillation iu tl1P \Yest Iudies, iu the fonrth edition of my paper-Appendix :So. 9, Coast and Geodetic Survey Heport of 1879-we find there the earliest records for HaYana, Cuba, 6° E. in 1100 and 42° E. iu 17:!0 and at Kingston, ,Jamaica, Gk E. in 1()60 ano the same in l'iOO. The agonic line for HiOO, afl originally givell, I have taken from Hansteen's Erdmagnetismus (1819). This line of 1600 mainl~· depends on Kircher's Ars l\fagnetiea and on Purc·has' Pilgrims, hut in accordance with abO\-e facts I have ><hifted it towards the north, so as to traverse the northern part of the Caribbean Sea. It \rnuld set>m to me that the line for 1500 requires a similar correction. Considering that the analytical expressions established by me in the secu1ar change paper referred to, for all fltations in this region haw a limited range of change, not exceeding 50 from a supposed average position, it will be seen from the early ollliervatioms dted aho-re that the limit of Yariation may have approached nearly to zero and that, unless a total change in the law of the secular progression of the de.dinatiou took place in tlwse early times, the statement by Fernando Colon as to west declination off the island of Trinidad must be regarded as spurious. Yet, in a matter of such extreme diffieult.r in the present state of our knowledge of the changes in the distribution of the earth's magnetism and while admitting that no certain or llefmite conclusion can be reached, I may, nevertheless, state as my opinion that at the time of Columbu;;;' first landfall on one of the Bahama Islands the declination was i1ay .~mall and probably less than 1 point west .. RcYerting ag·ain to the chart of the positions of the agonic line of the North Atlantic, Humboldt, in his Examen Critique, refers to Gilbert's Pbysiologia Norn to show that in lGOO the line of no· declination still passed through the Azores; and it may be noted that Sir Walter Raleigh's o!Jscrvation · on October 28, 16li, in latitude 70 N., longitude 28zo W., viz, 70, and he thinks east, fa1ls in well with the corrected curve on the chart. In the Azores, at Funehal Bay, the deeliMtion was observed 3° 05' E. in 1589 and at Santa M:aria 10 40' E. in 1610. At the Cape de Yerde Islands the declination was observed 3° 30' E. in 1610 (see Encyclopredia of Experimental Philoso· pity, London, 184B, p. 836). Tl1e line for 1700 is well founded and is taken from Halley's magnetic chart (Tabula Nautiea, \~ariationum Magneticarurn index, juxta observationes, anno 1100), reproduced iu the Greenwich observations for 1869. Respecting the position of the lines for 1800 and 1880, no further remarks are required in this place. The motion of an agonic liJie may be regarded as typical for tbe motion of other isomagnetie lines in itR Yicinit.,r and wl1ich mar he takeu as running parallel to it within certain limits. Between 1600 and 18RO the agonic line turned in the direction of the handR of a watch through fully a right. angle, but between 1:--00 and 1600 the motion appears to have been partly retrograde. To obtain some idea as to·a scale of change for distance from the earlier -agonic lines, we may use the American obserYations made on our coast, (}Il or near the Gulf of Maine, by Hudson and Champlain, between 1604 and 1612; their average result is nearly iso W. \Ve can do no better than suppose the scale also to apply to distance:; from the agonic line of liiOO, corresponding to and, for intermediate values of west declination, proportional to tLe distance of our coast from the line of 1600; hut at bc1<t this would be & very rough proceeding. In response to a second inquiry, respecting the track of Uolumbus between Gomera and his

R.EPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE

first landfall, I would remark that the computed latitude of the landfall depends almost entirely on the as~umed declination along his track (de facto, the problem might be inverted and from a known position of the landfaH the distribution of the magnetic declination might be inferred). In strict adherence to the conclusion I came to respecting the magnetic declination, I have adopted the daily values as given in the accompan~'ing table of resulting positions. The courses were corrected Ao as to represent trne conrses. The magnetic courses and distances in leagues are those gh'en in Columbus' log.book; the latter were converted into nautical miles roughly by taking one league equal to three nautical miles, or three minutes of arc of a great circle of the earth's surface considered as a sphere. According to Clarke's fig·urc of the earth, a nautical mile is nearly 1 855.3 meters, or 6 080.3 feet. Fortunately the actual length of the Columbus league-that is, the league of his time, and, wha,t is more important, his practical conception of it, that isr his and his pilots' estimate.~ of its length....... dues not seriously affect tl1e resnlt of our problem, as will appear from the consideration that the total distance must land him somewhere on the eastern line bounding the Bahama Islands; and if we find his distances to overrun this limit, which I found to be the case, all we have to do is to diminish them by a suitable percentage. Accepting the length of the Columbus league as given by !\fr. Fox, vi:z, 6 456 yards and computing the track across the Atlantic, I found it ueeessaQ', in accortlance with the above indispensable condition, first to reduce the dista11ce8 hy one-tenth and then by one-hundredth more, which lands me just inside the line of keys. Columbus, when departing from Gomera, apparently took a northorly course in clearing it, so as to elude more easily the Portuguese, who were on the lookout for him at Hierro.*
