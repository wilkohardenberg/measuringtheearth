REPORT.
COAST 8lJRVEY STATJO:Y,

1\lear West Clusliire, Connecticut, J:i7occmber 7, 1862. SIR: I have the 110nor to submit my repQrt for the surveying year ending November 1. 1862, as required by law and the regulations of the 'l'rcasury Department. With it i;; an engraved map showing the general progress of _the survey, and a manuscript map prepared at the Coast Survey office, in accordance with the act of CJongress of Masch 3, 1853. The BUl'vey has been in progress, in its field or office WOI'k, in all the States of our coast-Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific, though upon the diminished scale rel1uircd by the diminisl1(,d appropriations fmи the fiscal year. The officers and the work have rendered es~ential service to tho fleetf' and annies of the Union. A brief and general statement of both these classeH of opera.tions will he given in the prefatory chapter (Part I) of this report, and a more detailed account in Part II. The estimates for the next fiscal year, upon the same reduced 8cale as those of the past yea:r, arc contained in Part I. 'l'he expeTieuce of the nsefulne8B of the survey in tl1e variouR war and blockade operations of the coast was liardly needed, to show that it ought to be pushed f01иward as rapidly as the means of the government will permit, if we would be prepared in those sections wl1cre danger may at any moment be imminent. The flows and ebbs of public feeling on that subject during the past year demonstrate the necessity of such preparation. I have taken the opportunity, presented by the visits of iu~pection of the chief engineer, General Joseph G. Totten, to inform myself personally, through the kindly official aud personal relations between us, of the progress and direction of the phms for defences on the coast, with a view to special 1иeference thereto in the progress of tl1e surveys. I was much gtиatified to find that as far as we had advimced the progJ1Css was in the right direction, though I could not but recognize that the information obtained would cnalilc me in the future to make the connexion even more intimate than in the past, when no such exigencies as are now probable seemed to be among the poBBibilitie8 of the times. I would be glad to make rapid provi8iou for these exigencies, could adequate means be furnished. Perhaps some opportunity may yet oceur to carry out such a purpose. It is certain that accurate maps must form the basis of wcll-cond11ctcd military operations, and that the best time to procure them is not when an attack is impending, or when the army waits, but when there is no hindrance to, or pressure upon. the surveyors. That no coast can be effectively attack~d, defended, or blockaded without accurate maps and charts, has been fully proved by the events of the last two years, if, indeed, such a proposition required practical proof. 'l'he p1;1иsonR employed upon the v11rious coasts beiug in the service of the government, their personal experience has been availaLlc in the various and complica,ted duties of pilotage, for lighting, for p1adug beacons, buoys, &c., in time1> of exigency, aud during the derm1gement of regular modes of supply and inspection. The honorable Secretary of the Navy has mentioned in his report the services of the Superintendent nf the Coast Survey, as a member of the commission, in reference to plans of blockade, &c., and has since, with your approval, placed him on an important commission for selecting a site for a navy yard for iron clads and iron vessels, in order to lay the foundation of an iron navy. 'l'he indispensable nsefolne~s of' the Coast Survey iиesult.s to these two commissions was'' gcnerouslyиaekuowledgcd by votes of each without dis~er1t. The resolution passed by the second board, transmitted to me by its pre~iilent, AJmirnl Stringham, will be fou11d in the Appendix: No. 37. The communication from the president of the iir.;t board, Admiral Dal'ont, was given in t.he Appendix of my last annual report. It will he observed that though general publication13 of maps and charts arиc made, the government has always more advanced and fresher information than other parties, whether domestic or foreign, and that due

The zeal with wliich tlie Coast SurvPv dfi('Cl'I' have thrown themsehиes into such service as the government nиquired is truly eommeudnble, and h~1s prn('ured for them the praise of the distinguished army and navy officers und<:r whose immediate direction they have served.
GE~ERAL

STATEME.'>T OF PROGRESS.

The general sketch of progress (No. 45) shows that the triangulation, primary or secondary, of the Atlantic coast iR coutinnous from our northeastern boundary to south of the line between North and South Caroliua, and, with an interval of about sixty miles, from 'Yinyah bay, S. C., to l\Iatanzas inlet, Eouth of St. Augustine, }'la. - Thi:< year t1nee triangulation, Bix topogrnpl1ieal, auc1 two hydrographic partieR lmve worked upon the coast of Maine. The trian1:,>Ulation (Sketch No. 2) includes Eastport harbor, and that of the sea-coast is complete from Machias bay to ]\fount Desert, and from tlie entrance and approaches of Isle au Haut bay, including Penobscot bay. to Kittery, l\le. 'l'he topography is about two seasons behind the triangulation, and the l1ydrography i8 proportionately advanced. This season's topographic.al work on the coast of Maine has been in the neighborhood of Eastport, at Frenchma11'8 bay, below Rockland har1or, along the water passages which connect the Sheepscot and the Kennebec, in the upper part of Casco bay, and near Portland, (a reconnai>'sauce for defeusivc purposes.) The hydrogrnphy has been that of the water connexions between the ShePpscot and Kennebec river,;, including also Wiscasset bay, the upper part of Casco bay, including Yarmouth ancl lи'reeport river8, and supplementary work near Portland. 'l'he work on the coast of New Hamp8hire and MassachuscttE (Sketch Ko. 3) is nearly completed. ])uriug the past Beason a hydrographic pmиty lms added to the previous work. The sp<:cial surveys in Boston harbor have been continuecl. 'l'wo topographical and one hydrographic party lwve worked on the coast of Rhode Island, one of each class co-operating in the examination by the navy yard commission. The tidal aud magnetic observations have bet'n kept up at EaBtport, and the tidal ob~ervations at Boston. Two triangulation partie8, one alllo making astronomical observations, have been working on the coast of Connecticut lSketch No. 3) near New Haven, and on the Connecticut river below the head of tide. Two tria11gulation, one topogrnphieal, and one topographical and hydrographic pany have worked on the coast of New York and New ,Jersey; on Hudson riYer, (Sketch No. 11,) near Rhinebeck and Poughkeepsie, aud above Tivoli; near the western enc1 of Long Island, and on the ocean shore of :New Jersey, (verification survey.) Tidal observations have bec11 kept up at Brooklyn, New York. Examinations of bydrogra11hic changes have been made in the Delaware river, near Fort Delaware, and near the mouth of the Schuylkill, in Delaware, New Jereey, a11d Pennsylvania. .Magnetic observations for tl1e secular cl1ange of the declination aud inleusity have been made in New York and Penn~ylvania, (Sketch No. 47.) The rate of progress on the coast of Sections I aud II, (Maine to Maryland,) has quite equalled the estimates mac1e in my reports for 1857 and 1850. :Five parties t1-iangulating and sketching iu sho1иe-line and the topography of the banks of the Potomac, (Sketch No. 13, \ and co operating through one chief, have finished the preliminary survey of that rinr from Blakistone i8land up to Georgetown. 'l'hese, while at work, were in part protected by the Potomac flotilla, in part by the army detachments on the banks, anc1 in part worked freely without uec'd of protection. A hydrogrnphic party is still engaged and will complete the soundings of the Potomac below Indian Head. The same party had p1иeviously rendered good service in tl1e North Atlantic blockading squadron, in the York, I'tununkey, and :Mattaponi rivers. An additional hydrographic party has sounded the Potomac between Alexandria and Georgetown, 'there being great need for a chart of the river near '" ashington. Two topographical parties have mapped tl1e environs of Williamsport, Maryland, for the use of the anny; another was fo1и a ~hort period employed in the topograpl1y of military defences near :Fort Lincoln ; one is now engaged in the vicinity <>f the District line near Bladensburg in plane-table work for military purposes; a survey was made by another of the rebel position and works at Manassa8; a fifth party is now eugaged in mapping the western npproaches of }'ort Marcy, in Fairfax county; another party surveyed the north bank of the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg, and skfиtcbed the roads leading to the Potomac; and a. seventh made reconnaissances and surveys on the I>cninsula, between the York and James rivers. These parties worked under the immediate direction of the chief topographical engineers of the armies of the Potomac and Rappahannock.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SUHVEY.

Two topographical parties with the anny of Maryland worked on the eastern f'hore of Yirginia, nmr Drummondtown and Norfolk, and one of them made a hyclrographic resurvey of :\Ietomkin inlet. There 1ue now ( ::'.'\ oveml>er 7) four topngrapbical parfa:H surwying- with tlw diffonиut eoiиp~ nf tlw army nuder General :;\foClellan along the line uf the Potnnmc. Ob~crrntionF han: bcPn mad<' at tLe \Ya~binglon magnetic station, :md tlH: ti cl al ou:;erva ti nus have l1ecn contiuuecl at Old Point Comfort, Va. On the coast of North Carolina (Sketch Ko. ~l) a rc~urvey was made of Hatteras inlet at the opcuiug of the prPRent surveying year, and it was in part re-exmnined suLf'equently, and service in marking hy buoys and stakes rnudered there, in connexion with the Korth Atlantic blockading squadron, by a second Coat't Survey party. Oregon inlet was completely surveyed by a third party, which ah;o made examination of the tides and currents and of their action upon the site of :Fort Hatteras. The same parties, last named, made a reconnaissa.nce of the ::;.,euse river to a poiut above Kewbern, and placed channel stakeH ancl bnoy~ on the middle ground. Service.was rendered in the attack upon Hoanoke islaud. As soon as Beaufort, K. C., wa8 taken by our forces, a hydrogra1иhic pa1иty was sent there and rn>icle a resurvey, tracing anew portions of the shore line, and sounding the bar, the entrance, and the interior of the harbor. Some useful observations were communicated to us, by permio~ion of the ;.\:n-y De1mrtme11t, by one of the officer8 of the blockading Hcprndron, who had been supplied with instruments from the Coa~t Survey office. These pmts of the coai;t had been recognized as changeable in our operations of previous years. On the coast, of South Carolin.'!, (Sketch Ko. 25,) G1~orgia, and Floriila, acting under the immediate direction of the ffag officer of the South Atl:tntic blockading squadron, were four pa.rtie8, ouc <иf which had officers for all the surveying operations and a steam ve~sel; another for topngrnplty anrl hyrlrogral'hy, :mil two for topography, which were led. by officern of experience upon this part of the coast-co-operating with each othc1и through one chief and under the orders of Flag Officer DuPont. The operations of the~c partie:<, wl1ich reeeive.1 much comml'IHfation, will be given iu ddail nrnJer the head 11f Section V, only the surveying service being referred to here. Stono inlet aud riYer, and parts of Folly and Ki,nnth river:< were sounded out, the bar having entirdy clmnged. The banks of those streams were traced and mapped. l'art of Nor th Edisto river was resurveyed; part of St. Helena sound, and part of Port Royal sound, including Broad and Beaufort rivers and their tributaries, and also Skull creek aud Calibogue sound; lrnrt of Tybee Iloads, Ga.; part of \Yassa1v som1d; part of St. Simon's ~ntrnt1, and tlw bar at }~enrnrn1irn1, Fla. Buoys were placed ancl sailiug directions furnished to tlte flag officer. In connexion \dth the hydrography, the shore-lines were also traced of parts of Joh n's, James', Cole's, Kiawah, and Folly if laud ; of the inside of l'ort Royal islautl, arnl of parts of Broad liver, S. C., and its tributaries. Officers were furnished to reconnoitring expeditions afloat and ashore. The survey of the Florida reef (Sketch No. 32) was contimwr1 by a hyclrogmpl1ic party with a steamer> one triangulation, and one topographical party; and magnetic obtiervations by photography were kept np at Key West. On the coast, from ::\Iohile entrance to New Orleans, (Alabama, Ilfississippi, and Loui,;iana-Sketelt No. 3:-i,) a very strong party with a steam vessel lent by the Kavy Department, including assistants familiar with the different opPrations of the survey and wi1l1 this part of the coaRt, nmde reconnai8sances; detenni1H'd the best channels of the mouths of the Mi~sissippi, and buoyed that of the Southwest Pass; gave positions and distances for stationing the mortar boats near Fort ,Jackson, and other u~eful services which have been acknowledged by the flag officer uf the western Gulf blockading squadron, and by Commmlore D. D. Portt'r, uudcr whose immediate direction they acted. The same party made examinations of localities designated by General Butler, U. S. A. One of the surveying officers was immediately connected, for some time, with }<'lag Officer Farragut in the Hartford. Two topographical parties were detailed, at the request of General Halleck, and under orders of his aide-de-camp, Colonel R. D. Cut.ts, Assistant in the Coast Snnиey, to milkc military surveys of the ground occupied and commanded by the defensive works erected at St. Louis in 1861. These surveys are nearly completed. Arrangements are now making for the detail of parties to accompany the expedition of General Banks to the coa.st of Texas, and Commod'!!re Porter's to the Missiseippi. On the Pacific coast, in Sections X and XI, (Sketches Nos. 37, 38, and 42,) oue tri:mgul11tion party, one triangulation, topographical, and bydrographic, two topographical, one of them a douhfo p:ut;r. and one hydrographic party, liave been employed. The triangnlation of San Clemente i~land (one nf tlw Santa Barbara islands) and of the main between San Pedro. and Point Dnrna, hns been com1ileted. 'I'hc topogra11hy of Bodega bay has been completed in connexion with the coast adjacf'nt south t-0 'l'omalcs, and 8 evcrnl miles north of B-0dega entrance. Soundings for verification have been ma.de in Karquines strnit, OPliosite to Mar-

Tbc B<'rviccs at Port Royal and in the Lower Mississippi, where the survl'y gained so much c1иedit, were only a fractional part of those rendered. Three Coast Survey steamers have been kept at work during neaTly the wl1ole season-tlie Corwin, the Bibb, and the Vixen-bting, wfien not actt,rnlly employed by the survey, med by the Nnvy Dc1lartment. The services of the Vixen, under command of Assistant 0. 0. Boutelle, weie acknowledg1иrl by Admiral DuPont in his official -report of the action at l'ort Royal. Tbe familiarity of lier commander with that part of the coast made his personal services of the greatest importance.

Six of the civil officers of the survey liave, under your Ruthority, received furloughs, witl10ut pay, to join the volunteer service, and have shown great capacity in their several positions. Another, formerly an officer of the corps of engineers, hm; been absent from the office temporarily, and is yet under the orders of the chief engineer. l::lixtcen officers of the survey, of different grades, have been detailed for service, chi~иfly topograpl1ical, with the army of the Potomac, near \Vaohington, in the Peninsula, and on the F pper Potomac; with the army of the Ra1>pahannock, nea1и Fredericksburg and at Manassas; with the army of Maryland and Virginia, on the Eastern Shore and at Xorfolk; and with the army of North Carolina, at Hntteras, Roanoke island, Kewbern, and Beaufort, N.

Of 8eventcen assistante, fourteen sub-a8sistants, and eighteen aidB, serving in the field or aflo:it, fifteen assistant,., eleven sub-assistants, and fifteen aids have deYoted the whole or a part of the year to the regular progress of the s1irvPy; and eight assistants, ten su1-assii;tunts, and fourteen aids (thirty-two officers) ha\'e rendered service in connection with tbc operations of the army and na\7, generally iu adtlition to their regular duties. This last-named service was, of coursB, not witl10ut its s1iecial dangers. Sub-Assistant Dorr narrowly e~capf'd wl1en the larnentf'd \Vaguer and a soldier of :Mr. Dorr's plane-table party were mortally wounded in front of Yorktown. The plaiw-table which Mr. Dorr was uRing иwaR shattered to pieces. Sub-Assistant Oltmanns was ha<lly wounded in the hreast 1y a Minic ball during the reconnaisance of Pearl river, while attad1ed to tlrn steamer Sachem, which was then under command of Assistant F. IL Gerdes, and serving with the flotilla of Commodore (now Admiral) D. D. l'orter. The bravery of .Mr. J. S. Bradford, ~Ir. C. H. B.Jyd, and their comrades, of the party of ARsistant Bnutelle, alone saved them from capture on James island, S. 0., and put in their hands several prisoners, who were delivered to thc custody of the flag-officer of the squadron. Of the officers who have thu8 served, the chicfa of imrties-Assistant Charles 0. Boutelle, under Admiral DuPont, ancl Assistant :F. IL Gcrde8, under Admiral D. D. Porter-have made themselves especially useful, and lu1ve won t11e special commendations of the gallant officers nuder whom they l!erved. A more satiofaetory view of the p 1sonncl of the service alluded to will Le found in the Appendix, (X os. 28 and 29,) showing the detail:> made dnring the year when the changes were the greatest, as in the mouths previous to June, eomparell wich those between J uuc and Novem1er.
MAPS AND CHARTS.

In my general rPports for 1856, 1857, and 1858, I gave au account of the several series of l:lheets intended to show the topography and hydrography of the Atlantic and Gulf coast. These were one hundred and tl1irteen coast or in-s1wre maps and charts, in forty-two ~cries, on a scale of -80 ~ 00 ; sixteen general OT off-slwrc charts, on a scale of 4001000 ; and liarbor maps and charts on various scales, from do<r to 6 tJi011 и In advance of these was a prcliruinmиy series, thirty-three in number, upon a scale of 200\ 00 , intended to provide for the publication of the coast hydrography as soon as po1:1sible, when the number of soUilding partiefl was at the maxi.rnunf, and witl1ont tlie addition of the details of topography. Sevet"al .of these were imhfo;hed in previous years; but of late it has been fouud more expedient to issue charts on either of the scales, as preliminary, or with only the shore-line, it not being in all cases practica1fo to continue the bydrography with strict reference to the completion of sheets which might be in progress in the drawing and engraving divisiollll.

Of the series first mentioned (in-shore maps and c111nts) twenty-five 1mve been published, iиepresf'nting tl1 c most important part~ of the coast, and fourteen are yet in the hands of the engravers. Thl' same topograpliy and hydrograph3-, reduced to one-fifth and generalized in detail,,;, arc u~ed for the gcnernl coa"t charts, four of which arc now in progress and advancing towards completion as the material applicable to the localities wliich they represent comes in. The whole number of charts which have been engraved upon copper for publication, and which are now in nl"e, is three hundred and eight. '!'his is exclusive of twenty-three copperplates, containiug the proE,иTess sketches, and thirty-two 11lates of diagrams. 'l'hP number of maps, charts, and sketches lithographed in the office, in addition to the engraved ones, is onБ' hundred and twenty-nine. In the Drawing Divi8ion seveuty-one ~lieets have heen work,-,d on witl1in the year whicl1 ended on tl1e 31st of October. In the classification which !ms been rpfcrrell to, ten of thcioe were rnap8 and charts intend('d to be in full detail, and seventeen otlu:rs of the same kiurl, but not connPctcd witl1 the coast Re1ies, thPir scales being vmиious. Ten others arc preliminary charts, and twenty maps and sketches for litlwgraphic trandPr. Be~ides twelve of the progress sketches to which additions were made, and two sheets of diagmms, thirtyfive of the drawings have been completed and twenty-two are now in hand. In the Engraving Dh-ision six first-class maps and charts have been brought to complPtion within the year, and supplementary work lias 11een added to four others which had been pnblished. Five second-class charts and sketches have also been engraved, and three diagrams for my last anuual repmиt. Twenty-eight plutes are now in progTcs", of whicli thirteeu were cornmencf'd within the JlrP>'ent year. This gi,-es a total of forty-six platrs worked on, the details of eightePn of which were com11leted. There rue, in ad(lition to these, in the divisiou, the plates of seven chartF in Yarious df'grees of forwardness. Several of tlwm have received all thP material which the field-work has as yet furnished, and others, engraYed in parts, are about to be joined and put in lmnd for completion. In order to supply new maps and charts as rapidly as they WPre wanted for military and naval use, W(', last year, establiohed litlwgrnphic roomH in the office for ordinary lithography, engraving on stone, and trmrnfrr printing. The dPmand liaYing greatly increaFed, all the persons attaclwd to this branch of the office have been very cloi'cly employed. Two lithographic presses are yet kept in use. Color printing has been introduced for maps of the seat of war, and has proved ve1y acceptable, the sale of the maps more than reimbursing tbe cost of tl1cir production. Of tlw charts printed within the year, which liavc greatly exceetfod in numl1er tlw issue of previous years, 25,925 have hecn furnished to the active superintendent of the Hyrlrographic office of the Na\-y D<'partment to be distributed to our naval YesRcls. Two hundred and twPnty-three captains and pilots of Vf'Hsds in government service, who have nrnde applica.tion in person at the Coast Survey office, have received in the aggregate 1,863 copies of ,-arious chart8. It will be seen by the report from the Miscdlaneous Division, (Appendix No. 11,) that a total of 44,19f> copies ha~ bePn distributed during the year, of which by far the greater part were for the use of the navy and tbe army. In addition to the ten memoirs descriptive of the cm1st, meutioued in my report of last year as lithographed and bound up with chartf', and di~tributed to officers of the navy and of the army in command of expeditions, two other memoirs have been completed, and copiel' issued in likP manner. Of the twelve which were prepared by tbi; Supe1иintcndent and A8si~tantf' 8pecially for the u:<e of naval and military commanders, an aggregate of three hundred and <иighty-five copies have been furnished since August, 18Gl, wl1e11 the first was ready f<ir i:>sue. All the detail~ in r;,gard to the diRtributiou of map:;, charts, memoirs of the coast, &c., will be found in the Appendix before rcfrrrcd to. The following list contains the titles of the maps, charts, and skctehes wl1ieh accompany this report.

NoTE.-Those of the nl>ove maps and charts which represent portions of tbe cowit under blockade a.t the time of publiи lication of this report will not appear. ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1863-'64.

The estimates now submitted are intended to provide for the usual progress on the coast from Passamaquoildy to the capes of Virginia, and the prngres8 which seems most probable from thence to the Rio Grande. They also provide for parties to aid the fleets and armies operating on the coast, in pursuance of the plan which you have fully approved, a11d which lias, unrler your direction, proved s0 useful. Flexibility, in a work like this, is a most im1rnrtant feature, and that you have successfully impressed upon it. If I have erred in the estimates, it is in restricting them too much, the safest side upon which to err under the circumiltances.

I suppose that one more appropriation, of about the amount now aske<l, will enable us to complete tne survey of the .Florida reefs and keys. 'There is now a gap in tl1c hydrography of thi.; dangeron~ part of the coast, which I expect to be uble to have completed this 8Cason. It may require the application of the smdl appropriation for the triangulation ao:;rosR the peninsula, which cannot be used, under present circumstance~, for completing the work for which it was designed, for this purpose. All these matters of detail will be set forth in my annual report. The estimates include, as usual, separate items for the Atlantic and Gulf coast, Florida reefa, and western coast of the United States, without, however, the facilities f01иmeily extended by the 'Var and I\avy Departments by the detail of officers.

DEVELOPMENTS .AND DISCO\ERIES.

Tlie general list of ilC'velopmC'nts and ili~coverie~, contnining the itrms arranged in gi>ographieal onlC'r, is given in Appendix No. 4. Those connected with the work of the present year arc here appendetl, and will hereafter take their places in the general list. The difficulty of finding rocks, of which we lrnve hail so many inFtances, cannot he hettPr illustmted than by the fact that two should have been discovered in and near the entrance of so well surveyed and EO well known a harbor as that of Newport. The particulars in regard to position, &c., of these, which stand first in the appended li8t, are stated in Appendix No. 6. For the notice given in Appendix No. 7, in reference to a shoal spot supposed to exist to the eastward of the "\\'inter Quarter shoal, (coast of Maryland,) I am indebted to G. \V. Blunt, esq., of Kew York city. 1. Two rocks discoverecl in the approaches to Newport harbor, R. I; one with fourteen and a quarter feet of water on it at mean low tide, the other with seventeen feet at mean low water. Ten other rocks in the vicinity (previously known) were determined in position. 2. The shifting of the bar of l\letomkin inlet, Va., and changes of shore-line, but without alteration of depth on the bar. 3. Determination, by close soundings, of the best line of water for crossing the Kettlebottom shoals, Potomac river, there being no well defined channel over the shoals. 4. Changes in depth aud outline at On~gon inlet, N. 0. 5. Special examination of the tirles and currents, with reference to the hydrographic and shore-line changes at Hatteras inlet, N. 0. 6. Development of the alteration in outline and ileptl1 at tl1e entrance of Tieanfort liarbor, N. C. 7. Re-examination, by soundings, of the Rattlesnake shoal, coast of South Carolina. 8. Stono entrance, S. C., sounded, and channel found half a mile to westward of its former position, with slight increaRe of depth. 9. The shoaling of North Edisto entrance from its former depth, giving now only nine feet of watf'r. 10. St. Helena entrance, S. C., examiuecl, and a new channel from the eaetwarcl found, giving sixteen feet at mean low water. 11. The south channel of Port Royal sound developed, and nineteen and a half feet found to be the least depth in it. 12. 'l'he channel of the inland passage thoroughly sounded, leading from Port Royal sound into Tybee roads, through 8kull creek and Calibogur sound. 13. The bar and entrance of St. Simon's sound, Ga., examined, showing no material change of dc1ith within the past two years. 14. The shiftiug to southward, and shoaling by several feet, of the channel into Fernandina lmrbur, Fla., having now only eleven feet at mean low water. 15. The further encroachment of the sand 8pit at the confluence of Karquines and ]fare faland straits, n1ion the cliannels which branch towards the n1ffy yard and Benicia.
SPECIAL SURVEYS.

The maps and charts for the United States commissioners on the harbor of Bo8ton, called for bv the city in the study of means for the pre8ervation of tlrn harbor, have mRde good progress in l\lr. Boschke's hands, and it is expected will be finished Boon after the opening of the new year. Special surveys of the shore-line of P1иudence !Eland, of Taylor's cove, Connanicut, Dyer's Island harbor, and of Dutch hland harbor, in Narragansett bay, were promptly made for the navy yard commission by Assistants A. M. Harrison and Henry :Mitchell and their parties, and the maps needed for the mie of the commission were rapidly drawn apd furui8hed. A special survey, also, of Coasters' Harbor island and of the adjacent shore was made by Assistant Heriry L. Wliiting, and tlie drawing promptly returned. Tl1is is on a large scale, and upon it the study of the suitableness of tlie island as a !lite for the Naval AcadP1ny may readily he made. Mention of these surveys will Le found under tbe head of Section I. 'I'he levellings required by the navy yard commis~ion at League i1:1land, and Hed l:fank, opposite to it, in New Jersey, were made by Assistant George Davidson, and notice of his work iu tl1at vicinity will be given under Section II.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

One of the naval officers, who has in former years served acceptably in the work of the Coast SurveyLicut. Commander D. L. Brainc, U.S. K.-ad<lr<'ssed me, last summer, offering, if means wern supplied from t11e office, to lletermine the condition anll capacity of the western elmnnd at the Cape Fear entrance. This was to be incidental to hi~ dnticil in command of the L. S. steamer l\fonticello, then, as now, in service on t11e blockade of the com;t of Korth Carulina. Aftnи con;;ulti11g the Navy Department, the instruments and pr,dtиctiou needed were furni~hed, aud tlie promi~e of Lieut. Commander Brainc as promptly fulfilled. In tl1e ehanrll'l over the bar of the we~tl'r11 entrance he found some improvement in de11th. This channel had but nine feet at mean low water in 1856. In reference to tlie examination wl1ich he made in September of the prl'sent year, Lieut. Commau<ler Braine 8tates that he "is led to believe that there is a depth of fifteen feet at high water, which would give in tlrn channel ten and a half feet at mean low water." This f'mиvey wm;, of conrf'e, rnacle nncler many disarlvantages, anrl will he further pusherl by the commander of the l\fonticello as opportunity occurs. Its difficulty and Clanger are apparent from the fact that tlie souudings were made at night, and almost immediately under tl1e guns of the enemy's batteries. In allu~ion to thi:<, it is remarked in the report that" the sentry's hail on his post could be distinctly heard on the dC'ek of the Monticello." On l1earing of the raid into Penn~yh-ania, in October last, I volunteered the services of Coast Survey officer<' (the Sec1иetary of the Trcarnry approving) for auy military reconnaissances which might be desired, and for making the rnapg which I thought might be dcsirnble. The p~esence of Assistant George Davidson near the city of Philaclel phia would have remlered immediate service practicable. This offer was communicated to the. committee of couneil8 on defence by the mayor, Alexander Henry, esq.
TIDE TABLES FOR ::lfAltIKERS-TIDES AND CURRENTS.

An edition of the tide tables, revised by Assfatant L. P. Pourta1es, is printed in Appendix No. 8. In it a few errors which had heretofore escaped detection have been corrected. The tidal stations, with two exceptions on the Atlantic coast, and all those upon the W estem coast, have been k('pt up; but it has been necessary to abandon, for the present, thofle on the Gulf of Mexico. The self-regiRtering gauge left by J\lr. Donegm1 at New Orleans, in the summer of 18Gl, has been recovered; that at Fernandina, :Fla., is believtиd to have been destroyed by the rebels. The one which was formerly nsed near Pensacola was, in all probability, destroyed by the burning of the navy yard. Nothing has yet been heard of the self~registering gauge which was on hoard of the schooner Twiligl1t at the time of her seizure at Aransas.
TABLE OF DEPTHS.

The tablP contai11ing a Rtatement of the deptl1 of water at tl1c entranceR of all t11e considerable harbors and inlets of the United StateE, whicl1 was pnL!i~hed in my annual report for 18f)9, has been revised in the Hydrogrnpliic Di\-ision of the office, and will be found in Appendix No ..S. 'l'he table contains several entries which were not given at the previous date.
INFORMATION FURNISHED.

The information furniehed under authority of the Treasury Department during the past year is stated in the form of a list, in Appendix No. 2, to wl1ich are also added the tracings from the orginal sheets needed by the military and naval officers in command of expeditions. 'l'he liet does not contain a large amount of information communicated for their use Ly other modes, as the compilation of geographical data for parts of t11e coast not regularly surveyed, and the preparation and di,;tribution of special notes and photographs of special surveys. Great care has been taken to discriminate in regard to the applications for tracings, &c., for the purposes of civil life.
STATISTICS.

The table of statistics has been added to, so as to bring it up to the present surveying year, and is given in Appendix No. 3. Up to 1861, inclusive, the triangulation had embraced an area of nearly fifty-four thousand two hundred square miles, within an area of nearly sixty-two thousand square miles covered by reconnaissance; and had

developed a general extent of coast of over four thousand five hunared miles, and a shore-line of about twenty-three thomиand miles, determining nine thousand four lrnndr<иd :rnd fifty-two geographical po~ition~. }'or lougitude determinations, eighty-five statious had been occupied; for latitude, one hundred and twenty-seven, and for azimuth, eighty-four statio11s. The topogra11hy had extended over an area of ncmиly scYcnteen thousrmd ~quare miles, having a general coast line of four thousand miles, and over forty-two thousand two hllll<lre<l miles of shore-liue, measuring the indentations. The hydrograpl1y extended over an area estimated at forty-six tl1ousand square miles, in which one hundred and ninety-six tLouR:md mileR werf' 1иun in sounding; six million three hundred and ninety-eight thousand soundings were made, and over eight thousand four lmndred specimens of the bottom obtained. The number of manuscript maps aud charts coustrud.ed wa~ two thouRaud one hundred and eighty-one, and of engraved maps, charts, and sketches there had been produced four hundred and ninety-three plates.
DJSTRIBlTTJON OF ANXUAL REPORTS AND MAPS.

It has been judged expedient during tlie past year to 110ld still in abeyance the usual foreign dfatribution of the printed annual reports througl1 the Smithsonian Institution, as was done during the year which ended with October, 1861, as was stated in my last annual iиeport. During the past year 4,028 copies of reports of various year~ have been distributed to in~titutions and individuals in the loyal States of the C nion, leaving on Land a limited number of copier for the years from 185L to 1860, inclusive. Of tl10se remaining on the 1st. of Novrmbmи there w<>re of the report for 1851 two hundred and twenty copies; of that for 1855, four hundred and twenty copies, and of that for 1857, three lmndred and twenty-eight copies left. Of the dates 1853, 1856, 18;i!), and 1860, the copies disposable for general distribution is larger. This decidlиdly unequal number of copies of the reportfi of various back years makes it necessary to discriminate carefully in their issue. It is also to be remembered that for the years 1859 au<l 1860 no copies have been sent to the States which now di~avow their allegiancp, to the government of the Union, but which will at some foture day feel interested, in common with the others, in the informae tion which they embody. To proYide for the best issue of these remaiuing reports ( 1851 to 1860) a circular has been sent to the priucipal libraries in tl1c more important cities of the nmth, and to tl1ose of uuivcroitiesи colleges, and other institutions, to ascertain what reports may be needed in order to complete their series, so tliat entfre sets may in future be within reach for purposes of reference in all the States to which thPy are now sent. As already stated under the head of maps and charts, upwards of forty-four thousand copies of printed maps, cliart8, and sketches have been Rent from the office since the date of my laRt report-a numhf'r more than double the distribution in the year lBGl, and upwards of five times the a.verage annual di~tribution of former years. This large and increa8ing issue of charts wit.liin the pa8t two year8 has bt~en due to tlie constant demands of the Navy and '\Var Departments, every effort to supply which still continues to be made. Besides the printing of charts by the tran8fer process, the prnduction of the bydrograpl1ic memoirs of the coast with facility offers further proof of the advantage of establi~hing a lithographic division at the office, though induced as it was by the emergency of last year for copies of charts. The couri;e taken in the prnparation of tbe hydrographic note8 was mc11tioned in my rPport of last year, and has al8o been alluded to in this, under the head of maps and charts. The testimonials from the different commanding officers as to their value have been numerous and emphatic. A summary of the details of distributioll' of the annual reports, maps, charts, &c., is contained in the report frnm the miscellaneous division of the office, Appendix No. 11.
RECORDS .A.ND RESULTS.

I call attention again to the fact that this publication is postponed for more auspicious times, as I have repeated applications for copies. The ':Present appropriation merely enables us to prepare the materials for publication, but not to publish.
LONGITUDES.

The hi8tory of the determination of longitudes in connexion witli the smиvc>y of the coast, from tl1e law and plan of reorganization of 1844 to 1858, was given in my report for 1858, incln<ling the mf'thods by astronomical observations, by the transportation of chronometers, and by the electrical telegraph. The

16

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

problem of longitudes by occultations of the Pleiades is described in the appendix of my report for 1856. Profe~sor Peirce haR been engaged Rince 1854 in 8timulating observers to a new series of obRcrvations, by preparing predictions and chartil of t11e oecultations, as explained in my report for tlie year 1858. These obsei-vations were coll<>ctl'd during t11e period from 1857 to 1861, or uutil the moon'8 path ceased to pass among those stars. 1V11ile tl1is new series of observatione was in progrrss with modern instruments and methous, Professor Peirce was occupied in recomputing the older seri<>s, for the period 1838 to 1842, by the aid of the new lunar tables. 'l'ht: results are given in his report, which was printed as Appendix No. 17 in my report of last year. "The conformity of the observations with theory is quite remarkable, and shows that this, the most delicate of all the ob:,;ervatious of the moon, demands and justifies the utmost precision of calcula.tion. The final determination of the longitude will, undoubtedly, surj:>ass all others in precision." Some of the partieulmиs of this interesting series of results are stated i.n the professor's report, Appendix: No. 12. Certain of the occultations which were observed both in Europe and America will serve to determine the errors of the tables, and hence to compute with suitable corrections tho&e which were observed only in A;merica, and to obtain a seccmd uetcrmination of the lougitude. Professor Peirce remarks that "the various observations will also Bt~rve the subsiuiary purpose of determining the relative longitudes of the di:fferent places which are upon the same continent either of Europe or America, and also to correct the places of the stars, and, finally, to determine the valne of the lunar semi-diameter, and the necessity of haviug regard to the protuberances of the moon in the complete solution of the problem." Profossor Peirce has addressed to me a special letter in relation to the tables of the moon used in the reduction of the observations of the Pleiades, (Appendix No. 13.) 'J'he Profossor gives his reasons for m;ing Hansen's tables in the computations, and, referring to the " full and generous" statements of :Mr. Lubbock, in the thirtieth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, in praise of the American tables pr<'pared by l'rofeesor Peirce for the Nautical Almanac under the direction of Captain Davis, U. S. N., corrects some historical statements in reference to the labors of mathematicians who have been occupied with the important task of improving the lunar tables. и 'The observations made by telcgrapl1 for the difference of longitude between Macon, Ga., and Eufaula, Ala., in the working season of 1859-'60, have been discussed by Dr. B. A. Gould. He reports tliat the difference in time between the astrouomical stations is, Eufaula 6m. 3.02.Y. west of Macon; which result, he adds, cannot be erroneous by more than five-lmndredtLs of a second of time. The detailed report on the results of the obi;erv>itious made in Georgia and Alabama is in course of preparation. I have placed in the Appcnuix No. 14 Dr. Gould's report on the progress which has been made in computing the results for all the stations between Calais and New Orleans.
MAGNETISM.

The publication of the results of a discussion of the Girard College observations, from. the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, commenced in my reports of 1859 and 1860, is continued in this, embracing the discussion of the observations of horizontal magnetic force. The difficulty which stands at the threshold of the discussion of these observations is the correction for temperature, the magnetic bars chauging in their own intensity of force with changes of temperature. The attempts to obtain the value of this correction are fully stated, and their application is showu and verified in various ways, in Part IV of the memoir, (Appendix No. 15.) 'l'ahles of the results, reduced to a standard temperature of 530 Fahrenheit, are then obtained, and corrected for the progressive change in the readings of the magnets. Tl1e observations are next separated into regular and di:!turbed reauings by the aid of Peirce's criterion, and the disturbances.being taken out, there remain the normal results for the hour, day, and year. These show the same period of ten or eleven years in number and extent of di~turbances which was deduced from the declination observations, corresponding with the period of change in the solar spots. The results agree very well with thQse obtained at Toronto, Canada. The curves of daily change of hotizontal force come QUt very perfectly in each year's result, the eurvee showing two maxima and two minima ill the course of the day, and the day changes being much more considerable than those of the night. The next part of the memoir, Part V, (Appendix No. 16,) contains t.he investigati-0n of the diurnru and annual variations of the horizont:ll magnetic force, from the means of the results for the five years of observation. The normal value of the horizontal intensity for the several hours of the day and months of the year of the five years is deduced, applying all the required corrections. Tho summer and winter results are compared in formulre, and by curves, with the mean for the whole year. At(; a. m. there is scarcely a.ny change

THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURYEY.

17

of horizontal force throughout the year, and at 11 ~ a. m. it is also nearly constant. Two other points of the same sort occur at 7.~ p. m. and at 11 p. m. }'rom this discussion results a scrieR of curves (Sk<'tch No. 48) whid1 sl1ow the horizontal fnrc<' at ev<'ry hour of the day of every month of the year. Thc8e corresponcl to the curves of declination referred to in my report of 1860. Both have been beautifully represented, b.r modelling, by ::'!Ir. F. Engel, of the Coast Surnиy office. Part VI of the memoir (Appendix No. 17) shows the influence of the moon on the magnetic horizontal force. 'J'he magnetic tide, so to speak, has two ebbs and flows in the lunar day. The times of maxima are two hours, and of the minima seven and a half hours after the culminations. 'l'he influence of the relative positious of the sun and moon on tl;ie horizontal magnetic force, though small, is distinctly perceptible, and the same i8 true of the moon's declination clrnnges. When the moon is nearest the earth the horizontal magnetic force is decidedly lessened, and when at the greatest distance from the earth is increased. At Eastport, .Me., the nrngnetic observations intended chiefly to furnish result>< bearing on the study of the secular change have been continued. Besides the change of the three magnetic components, thcl'e ob&crvations will al8o give the means of tracing the connexion of the diurnal range of the dPclination with the relative frequency of 8olar s11ots, and fumi~h. in addition, standard annual means for tlie. general discussion of magnetic observations which have been made along the entire northeastern coast of the United States. At Key \Vest the obserYations, both differential and absolute, have beeu continued, and t11e former now present an unbroken series of daily records. The photographic records of the three clements are revieed regularly at the office, and have been tabulated with a view to their general discus,;ion in a form somewhat similar to that used in the treatment of the Girard College o;eries, of which mention has bf'l~ll aheady madt>. Though strictly scientific in clmraetcr, these inve~tigations will give ready means for tracing the secular changes that. are now going on in the eastern part of the Gulf of l\fexico. In the years 1840 and 1841 I made a detailed magnetic survey of the State of Pennsylvania and of at1jacent parts of New York, Ohio, and )faryland, to which other observations were added in 1843, while on a tour through 'Yestern New York, Canada, New Jer~ey, and .Pennsylvania. Tl1ese observation~ have recently been worked up and prepared for the press, ha\иing been made with the best instruments tl,cn available. Au abstract of the discussion of them is given in .Appendix No. 19. The declination was determined at sixteen stations, and tlw dip and intensity at forty-eight. In July and August, 1862, six of the stations in my series were reoccupied by Assistant Chnrles A. Schott, (Appendix No. 18.) 'I'he expenRe incmred for tl1e tl1ree which fell out<'ide of' the limits of' CoasL Survey operations was defrayed by the Smith::ionian Institution, and this co-operation has added greatly to the expected Yalue of the results. This is believed to bl' one of the earliest systemntic surveys, tl1at includes the three magnetic elements, aR y<>t macle in any of the States. Its oldeet is intimately comwcted with an important part of the operations of the Coa;;t Survey. In Appemlix ::-lo. 19 I give an abstract of the individual results, as well as a general account of the discussion aud of tlie expressions dedueed for the distribution of magnetism over the area surveyed. The suldect is further illustrated by Sketch No. 47, which shows the isomagnetic curves for the epochs 1842 and 1862. 'l'he nиgnlar biennial publication of results found for the magnetic declination, dip, and jntensity, at stations which have been occupied by Coast Survey parties within the last two years, is contained in Appendix No. 20. This comprise~ twenty-two stations, numbered in continuation of those given in Appendix No. 28 of my annual report for 1860.
SOLAR SPOTS,

The record of solar 11pots which was kept at the Coast Si.Jryey office by Assietant Schott with conside1иable regularity until the close of the year 1861 has since been only partially kept up, in con~equenee of the pre11sure of routine duties. Appem1ix No. 21 gives a continuation of the records which were publislied iu 1860 and 1861 as Appendix No. 25 in my repprts for those years. J<~uropean observations, made regularly and published every year, will supply the place of the omitted records in the discussion of magnetic obserrntions.
EARTHQUAKE WAVES.

The renewed interest awakened on this subject by the presence "in our country of Captain Lessoff~ky, of the Russian navy, who wa.s in command of the flag-ship Diana, Admiral l'ontiatine, wrecked by the effocts of the earthquake of December 23, 18.54, in the harbor of Simoda, Japan, has called my attention to errors, cs3

some of them typographical, in the printing of my paper on eartbquake waves, and the depth of the ocean as deduced tl1crcfrom, in the Coast Snrvcy report for 1855. As tlie best mode of correction, I have included the paper for iиeprini with the appendix matter of this report. It will be found in the Appendix, No. 24.
FLORIDA REEF.

Captain E. B. Hunt, of the corps of Pngiueers, has contributed for this report an interesting paper on the origin, growth, substructure, and clironology of the Florida Teef, which will be found in the Appendix, No. 25. Its eonclu~ions will me1~t with examination and criticism from those wl10 lmve been occu11ied in these and similar studies. The pmctical part Teferring to soundings, currents, winds, &c., is of decided interest to navigators.
HEIGHTS.

The collection of data, from all available sources, for heights over the continent of North America has been continued during the past year; and the preparation of a map to form a basis for the projection of contour lines Jias been carried on as far as the time of the Assistant charged with this subject would иallow from oilier pre88ing call~. '!'his collection of heights has been placed at the disposal of the chief topographical engineer of the army of 1''asltington.
EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRIES.

'The experiments for determining the length and expansion by heat of the standard bar, referred to in my rep01t for 1860 as being in progress, were completed early in 1861, under the direction of Assistant J. E. Hilgmd, liy Mr. vV. L. Nichol~ou, ai<led by :Mr. J. R Gilliss and Mr. Thomas McDonnell; but, owing to the preSHlrC of bu8inr~s in the officf', a complete <liHCUFBion of re8Ult8 was not m:ule until tlw present year.

The lists which have appeared in my previous annual reports, givmg the recommendations of the Assistants of the Coai-t Survey for aids to navigation in special localities in which the need for them was open to observation, are this year almost entirely rPprespnted by one, (Appendix No. 36,) showing the nul)lber of buoys set by the working parties at the port and harbor entrances of the southern States for the use of tl1e blockading l'l}Uachons. All of the sailing marks seem to have been taken up and destroyed or secreted early in 1861. In some cases the buoys belonging to a channel were found at the nearest town, but in other instances new ones were required. They were all replaced with reference to the hydrographic changes which have occurred since they were :first put in place.
DIRECTORY OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

fhave availed myself of the convenient access which A1<sistaut George Davidson at present has to the office, having returned two years since from the Western coast, to invite him to prepro:e a second edition of the Directory of the Pacific coast, which was published in my annual report for 18;')8. It is to be understood that this embodies tlie information collected in our archives by the labors of the Assistants in the Coast Survey since 1849, as well as the researches into historical and other matter by the author, and his personal experience and observation. 'Dhus are embraced the astronomical determinations of Assistants R. D. Cutts aud George Davidson, and Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson ; those from triangulation by Assistants Cutts, Davidson, Rodgers, 6reenwell, and Lawson; the topographical by Assistants Cutts, Harrison, Rodgers, and Johnson; and the hydrographic by Lieut. Com'g W. P. McArthur, the pioneer of the hydrography; by

OJ<'}'ICERS OF THE ARMY AND NAVY.

The very acceptable aid which we have in former years received from the officers of tl1e army and navy, and which was returned to the government by the experience acquired in the various operations of the survey, has necessarily been withdrawn from us, the war placing us in the position of giving aid instead of receiving it. Lieutenant Commander J>helps is at this time the only officer of the navy left with us, and we have not a single army officer on full duty with us. Captain Elliot, of the corps of engineers, is still, however, permitted to examine and send to us the tidal obse1иvations from the "\Vestem coast.
OBITUARIES.

Assistant Alexander S. ""\Vadsworth died, suddenly, in the city of Washington, on the 9th of' August, 1862. He joined the"1mrv<'y in 1848, and, oppmiunity and his merit concurring, rapidly ro~e to the position of Assistant, whicli he occupied at the time of 11is death. His tria11gulation and plane-table work on the coast of N ortl1 Carolina were among the most rapid and successful works of their dass. Sub-As8i~tant "\Vyllyf' S.

General haac I.

J>a]ruer, U. S. topographical engineers, brevet lieutenant colond {_;. S. army, remained on 1<ervice in the Coast Survey while aid to 111ajor Genernl :McClellan, until the army moved forward into Virginia last spriug, when it was necessary to accom11any the genernl's staff. The same zeal whieh made him so serviceable in the office displayed itself in the field; arnl tLe hardships of the Peniurnlar emnpaig11, acting upon a somewbat delicate constitution, laiJ 11im open to tlw attack of typhoid fever of which he <lied, on the 18th of June. He was aLle to return home to the care of his devoted wife, but so much eufoebled by disea8e as uot to rally, and on the day after his arrival in \Y a'5hi11gtou he breathed hi8 la8t, mourned by a large fomily circle to whom he had been always deeply attached, and regretted hy numerons friends who had sliared his hol'pitality and good offices. The officers of the Coast Survey ex1ire1'3~ed their nиgret in the resoи lntions given in Appendix No. 40. l\fy own relations to Major Palmer were such as are due tJ a proved, true, and life-long friend. Captain John R. Smead had left the Coast Survey office, on the breaking out of the war, to c.ornmrmd the Wa.shington Rit!es, and after the campaign, in which they were so much di8tinguished for discipline and readiness of service, had returned to his position in the fifth regiment of U. S. artillery. He perished in the bloody fight near Mauassru;, on Saturday, August 30, leaving a young and helpless family to the care of his country, for which he had laid down his life. The A11pcndix already referred to contains the resolution passed by hiB recent associates in the office on the occasion of his death. Brigadier General William R. 'l'errill, of Virginia, was in charge of a Coast Survey party on the. we~tern coast of the peninsula of Florida when the rebellion broke out. Ile promptly disentangled his party and the government property from the hands of the rebels, when seizure became imminent, and, returning nortli, ranged himself unflinchingly on the side of the whole country, seeking at once service of the mo~t active kind with the army.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

In the summer campaign he was in service with the army of Kentucky, under General Buell, and was mortally wounded in the battle which was fought at Perryville on the 8th of October. The genial memories which his name would have elicited at all times amongst his former associates in the work of the surrey are turned to sadness by the early death of this truly up1иight and patriotic officer. By an accident at the l\fare Island navy yard, on the night of April 2, which caused the death, by drowning, of William F. Sands, the survey has lost the only hydrogrnpl1ic aid then attached to the work. His naturally good abilities had been developed to a promise of great usefulness by his father, Commander B. F. Sands, L. S. N., with whom the cleceased bad served from early boyhood in the practical details of hydrography. Remarkable for an amiable and teachable disposition, he had gained proficiency in hydrographic drawing, and was fully qualified to make return for the high expectations which had been formed in his training. At the time of his death Mr. Sands was acting master in the hydrographic party, and was engaged in the prosecution of the survey in Section X.

P. Vr ebber, from l\fount Desert islancl to the northward and eastward along the coa-st of Maine. Tbe secondary and tertiary work is kept in close connexion with tbe primary triangulation, as may be seen by referencf' to Sketcl1es Kos. 1 and 2. The triangulation of this year was taken np on the 8tl1 of August, previous to which date )fr. "'"" ebber bad been employed in Section Ill. From the entrance to Little Machias bay signals were set np to the southward and westward in positions proper f'or defining the numerous indentations of tl1e coast. 'I'l1e angular mca~urements made at them in September ~nd October furnieh points for the topographical rnrvt>y of Machias bay, Howard's bay, Little Kennebec river, Englishman's hay, Chandler's River bay, and Moose-a-bee reach, and of the i~lancls which lie off their entrances. At eight of the stations vertical angle:> were measured on t11irty-six signal,; by three hundred and ninety observations. ::\Ir. Webber used the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, No. 63, and the ~ix-inch Brunner, No. 52, in the determination of angles. His party worked with the schooner Hassler until the l>Pginning of N ovembe1" when operations clo8ed for the season in this section.

The ~omputations of the work have also been finished and turned in. Triangulation ef Eggemoggin reach, 11-Ie.-I~ continuation of his work of last year which connected stations in Penobscot bay with others to the Pastward in Great Blue Hill bay, Assistant G. A. Fairfield resumed work on the 7th of August at Dlake's Point. A signal wa8 erected there, and in the course of the month points were selected and signals set for the triangulation of Eggemoggin reach, the location of which may be seen by reference to Sketch No. 2. Observations with the theodolite (tcn~inch, No. 91, by Blunt) were commenced on the .3d of September and closed at the end of that month, when Mr. Fairfield proce<Jded to Blue Hill primary station and observed on such of the signals of his triangulation as were within view from it.

The three sheets which he has returned contain tl1e we~tern Fhore-lint' of Campobello island, from East Quoddy Light to a point opposite to иwest Q.uo<ld:и Head; the western s110re of \Vest Quo<ldy bay, includiug the Head; tl1c peninsula of J,ubec, and in connexion with it the t'horcs of J olmsou's bay; the eutire shore-line of l\foose il'land, inclu<ling tl1c town of Eastport ; the soutl1 end of Deer i~lm1d, and the numerous small i~lamh; lying between it and Campobello. Taken together the plane-table sheets give the outlines in connexion of West Quoddy bay, E,t:>tport harbor or Friar road, and both ~hore8 of the St. Croix river to Pleasant Point. Part of tbc details were tracvd in t11e work of la'3t season. The limits comprii!ecl in this y<car's survey (Sketch No. 2) folly provide for the liydrography of Ealltport lrn.rhor and itR approaches. Sixty-four miles of 8hore-line were traced, exclusive of thirteen mill's of low-water ~horP-line which required to be surveyed separately. Details were filled in to cover an area. of three and a half square miles. Sub-A~~istant Dennis had passed the winter and spring in topographical serYice connected with the naval expedition of Commodore (now Admiral) Du Pont on th{~ eoast of South Carnlina.

I.-Af'sistant Henry L. \Yhiting commenced a special i1lanc-taLie survey of Coaster's Haiиbor island and its vicinity on the 26th of June. Its surface was carefully contoured, and that of the ndjacPnt part of lthode Island, from Coddington co\иe nearly to tlw environs of Newport., and eastward, to include J\iiantonomy Hill. This isurvey was executed at the request of the Navy Department, and in order to furniHl1 d:1ta for deciding the question at issue, Mr. \Vhiting made close soundings between the southwest face of Coaster's Harbor island and the Gull rocks. The work was closed on. the 12th of July. A8sistant 1Vhiting then took up topographical duty in Section IL He had, before taking up duty in Narragansett bay, made several surveys in t11e vicinity of Wa8hington city, in Section III. The plane-table work in Narragansett bay was contiuued, between the 16th of August and the 1st of November, by tbc party of Assistant A. M. Harrison, who had also been, during spring and summer, engaged in field duty in Section III. For the special use of the United States board which was appointed to examine and report on sites for navy yards, and which met in Narragansett bay early in September, a survey had been directed of pai-ts of Connanicut island, including Taylor's cove, Dutch island, and Dutch Island harbor. This was executed by Mr. Harrison, on the scale of roi\- 00 , and met all the requirements of the commission. The other topogrnpliical duty of the party was confined to the dete1иmination of sl1oreи line and of the p1иincipal points needed for the correct plotting of the hydrographic work of the present season. These results were supplied to the party under Assistant Mitchell. During tbe entire working season in Nanиagansett bay, Assistant Harrison was aided by Mr. IL IY. Bache, and during part of it by Mr. F. A. Lueber.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Besides the special localities already referred to, tlie additions tliis year to the regular survey of the shores of Narragansett bay comprise the shore-line of I>rudence, I>atience, Dyer's, Gould, and other i~lande, and the we~tern side of Rhurle Island, from a pciint opposite to Coaster's islanu and northwanl, to limits of previous work. Only a few of the smaller islands in the bay rC'main to be traced in outline. Hydrograplty betu,.een TV:iscos.YPt a11J Bath, li:fe.-'T'he water passnges which intersPet tl1e '\Voolwic11 peninsula, and which connect the Sbeepscot and Kcnnr;bec rivers, have been sounded out by a party in charge of Assistant }~. H. Gerdes. Must of tlie shore-li1rn har1 been previously traced. The coucludiug portion was supplied for the use of the party by Sub-Assistant fordella. Mr. Gerdes took up tl1e l1ydrography at Wiscasset (Sketch No. 2) on the 23il of August, and in sounding .. Wiscasset bay connected his w01иk with the survey of the Sheepscot made in 1858 by Lieutenant Commandingи Moore. Thence in a direction southward and westward he sounded Back river, Montseag hay, Hrmkomonk bay, and Little river, which, taken together, afford a continuous water _passage between the Sheepscot river at Wiscasf'et and the Kl'nnelwc at a point about seven miles below Bath. 'l'be character of the other passage between tlw two rivers, made up of Upper Hurl Gate, the lfapids, and Great Hurl Gate, was also developed. These connect the Kennebec at Bath with the Sheepscot opposite to lrfahan's islanrl. и lfemmnиd togetl1er, and including Robin Hood's cove, which was also souuded, these channels make an aggregate of thirty-four mileR in length. 'l'he peninsula traversed by them is from five to ten miles in breadth. Sub-Assistant Clarence Fendall assisted ]\fr. Gerdes. Mr. 'I'. C. Bowie and Mr. F. H. Gerdes, jr., were attached to his party as aids. 'l'he schooner G. M:. Bache was used for transportation. Tidal observations were commenced at '\Viscasset when the hydrography was taken up, and were continued at that i>tation until the end of September, when the work was completed. During each day the state of the tide was noted every ten minutes, as were also the high and low waters that occurred at night. Observationt> for shorter periods were in like manner made on the tides in Little river and in Upp er and Great Hurl Gates. The party of Assistant Gerdes determined about seventy points for 11ydrographic purposes, and used above twenty others which were furni8hed by Sub-Assistant Iardella. The general statistics of the иwork are as follows : J\Iiles run in sounding ....ии.....и........... _...иии....ии...и. _.и.. _ . _ ..... 160 .Angles measured ....... ___ ..... _ . _.... _.... _.. __ . _ . _. _ии __ . __ ..и ___ . _ . ___ _ 1,167 Cash> of the lead .....ииии.и.....ии...и.и... __ . _ и...и......и....и.и.и.и... 11,uoo Both of the passages referred to in this notice are navigable. A steamer passes scemi-weekly from Bath to Boothbay through Upper and Great Hurl Gates.и Excepting Little i:iver at low tide, the water is quite deep in all the passages between the Sheepscot and the Kennebec. и .After the completion of tlie service assigned, the. schooner was laid up at Wiscasset. The soundings were plotted by M:r. A. Strausz, and the sheet containing them is now on file in the office . .A;isistaut Gerdes and bis aid, Mr. Bowie, had been previously engaged in Section VIII. Mention will be made of their employment there under tho corresponding head of this report. In October Mr. Bowie was detailed for plane-tahle duty in Section III. IIydrography ef Casco bay, Me -Bydrographic operations.were resumed in the upper part of Casco bay on the 3d of .August by a party in the surveying 8chooner Caswell. Tl1e charge of the work was given to Mr. Edward Cordell, of laiиge experience and qualification as a hydro~raphic clraughtsman, who IWMI. previously served with a number of the regular hydrographic parties on all parts of the .Atlantic coast. The soundings made were in continuation of the work of last year by .Assistant Schott, which had stopped on a line running cast from the north end of Cousin's island to Harpswell Neck, (Sketch No. 2,) and, south of the Neck, on a line from the lower end of Jewell's island eastward to include Drunken Dick ledge. North of the first-mentioned line l\fr. Cordell sounded Yarmouth river, Cousin's river, and ]'reeport river, and from their entrances the body of Casco bay eastward to Harpswell. He completed also the hydrography nortl1 of the line last mentioned, comprising that part of the bay which lies between Bailey's island and Crotch island. This survey includes Mericonig sound, Harpswell harbor, and the channel between Harpswell N eek and Great Whaleboat island. On the tides, day and night observations were macle at three stations, one of which was at South Freeport, where the record was continued until the 13th of October: Those at Harpswell and at Little Moges island were kept up until the end of September. Six current stations were occupied in different parts of the bay while soundings were in progress.

In the ,;cinity of Portland harbor Mr. Cordell made supplementary sounding~ near Trundy'& reef, and others in a resurw-y of \\yhite Head passa!:!'.e, between Peak's anrl Bangs's islands. He also determinerl in position a rock off the southeast end of Little J ebeig island. This rock has only nine feet of water on it at mean low tide. The elmnnel which has been artificially made across the Middle Ground 1>iuce the date of tl1e snrvey of Portland harbor was sounded out by theи party of :Ur. Cordell, and will be represented on a new edition of the engraved chart. и.rhe soundings made in the upper part of Casco bay this season show depths of from one to forty fathoms.

Mr. Cordell has plotted and sent to tl1e office the sheets containing the hydrograpl1ic work of the seaBon, together with the records of ang1e11, soun<lings, and tidal and current obi-;ervations, in <luplicate. He was aided in duty afloat by Messrs. L. L. Nicholson, L. A. Sengteller, and J. A. Sample, and make~ special mention in his report of the ready and intelligent service rendered by them. Physical survey ef Cape Cod ba.IJ, ,,"l'[ass.-In die early part of the present year I directed Assistant Henry 1ifitche11 to make some experiments in Cape Cod bay, witl1 a view of furnishing information r<'quircd by the committee on the Cape Cod can:al appointed by the J\Iassachusetts legi~lature. This committee had under discuesion tlie question whether the proposed canal and artificial harbor would be obBtrnckd by ice during the winter months. During a previous season's work we had discovered that a sub-current from the deeper portion of Cape Cod bay cropped out in thf' neighborhood of Scussett at one of the propos8d sites for the breakwater and -basin. In this region the tPmperatures were quite at variance with those of the surface of the sea elscwl1ere; they were very uniform, and corresponded with the thermal conditiona observed at the depth of fifteen fathoms wider out in the bay. Our obsenиations had been made in the summer, and could not, tl1erefore, furnish more than a guess as to the conditions which should obtain in winter. On the 9th of February Mr. Mitchell reported upon a new ~et of experiments made during a cold pcr:od earlier in the Brune month, and I sent his manuscript immediately to the committee. In tlie course of this report it is stated that a specimen of the Cape Cod hay water began to freeze at 28l;░ Fahrenheit, and that, after being for eleven liours exposed in air at 16░, om'-third of its bulk became a spongy ice, the residue still remaining in a liquid state at 27~. This ice, though quite fre>5h its<'l_f, held some salt water suspended in its cells. At each attempt to freeze tlie residuum water there was obtained a lower temperature and a higher specific gravity for that still remaining liquid. The water off Scussett was observed to fall as low as 32░-that is, within about four degrees of its freezing point-and this at tlie end of a period of severe cold. Mr. Mitchell concludes from bis study that, while the natural circulation of the currents is unobstructed, no sea-water ke can actually form in the particular district off Scm18ett, although he believes that bottom ice may be found in localities where fresh springs are welling from the sands. Hydrography ef B_arnst.able harbor, 11-faB.t.-In October the party of As~istant Henry Mitchell made supplementary soundings in the vicinity of :Barnstable, and completed the hydrograpllic sheet which иwas turned in last winter. The engraved chart, in preliminary form, accompa,nicd my annual report for 1861. Hydrograpliy ef Narragansett hay, R. L-In continuation of the work of last year, Assistant l\IitclH'll, with a party in the schooner Bancroft, took up soundings at the south end of Prudence island, (Sketch No. 3,) and extended the hydrography of N a1Taganl!ett bay southward in tlie l\[iddle Passage to a point about a quarter of a mile below Goat Island light. Soundings comprised within an area of about a square mile were made also in the Western Passage, in the immediate vicinity of Dutch ig]and. This party resumed the work on the 1st of August and continued duty afloat until the end of September, when the vessel was returned to New York. She had previously been in use hy the party of .Assistant Mitchell in Section IV, under wl1ich head mention will be made of otlier service.

In the course of this season's work J.Ir. ?llitchell develo1lCd th~ 11ositions of teu hidden rock8, and fouml in the approaches to Newport harhor two others, the existence of which wa8 unkrnrnиn. These arc all 1rnJTked on the hydrograpl1ic sheet which is now in prиcparation, and which will be turned in bPfore the close of the year. In AJlpendix No. 6 a copy is given of the notice issued to mariners at the time of the discovery. Messrs. C. L. Bixby, C. I'. Dillaway, and J>ersifer Ji'razer, jr., were attached as aids to this party. The work done hy AssiRtant 1\likhell waR dirf'cted with a viPw to the requirements of the navy yard commiesion which met in ::\ arrngansett bay in the first week of September. l\!lagnetic obserrations.-The observations near the middle of eacl1 month of the year have been continued at the Eastport station, in :Maine, without intcrmption. These now furnish a well-conductetl series of tleterminations of tlw magmиtic df'cli1rntion, dip, and iutens:ty, extending over a period of nearly three years. ::\fr. Samuel \Valker had charge of the instruments at Eastport until .March of the 1n;escnt year. His services being then needed at Key "\Vest, the station was put, and still remains, in charp;e of Mr. H. H. Talcott. Before leaving EaRtport :Mr. \Valker determined the Yalne of the coefficient of tempemture, and the moment of inertia for the magnets A and C. Early in November Mr. Talcott was relieved by Assistant Edward Goodfellow, and was attached to the topogmphical party of Sub-AssiRtant "\Y. II. Dennis, to work in Section V. Tidal olwTcation8_-The tidal otation at EMtport, Mc., rrmиlinecl in cliarge of JI.Ir. Samuel vYalker until :Mal'eh last, when tlw observations were int.rusted to l'llr. R. H.

A 8Hbstantial staff-gauge has been set np at Eastport fell" comparing rPsults with the self-registering tidegaugf', th!' tllpc or hand heretofore used ha-ving provr.d unreliable from irregular ииxpansion. Mr. Talcott nlrn continued the magnetic an(l mcteoroloi;ical observations at Eastport until November. At the Charlestown navy yard, Mass., tl1e tidal observations have been k<'pt up by JI.Ir. T. E. Ucady with hii; accustomed punctuality. The Iloston harhor commissioner~ having put in his charge a self-registering gauge for an indqienclcnt series of observations, and provided a huilding for its protection, the occasion liaR been improved by setting up in the same a substantial box-gauge, from both of which observations arc recorded, in addition to those at the permanent ~tat.ion.

Statements of the work <lone in this section will be noticed in the following order~ 1. Geutletic, astronomical, and magnetic observations at primary 8tations in Massaclmsetts and Connecticut. The trиiangulation work is for connecting the primary base on Epping l'laim1, .Me., with that on Ji'ire foland, N. Y. 2. Triangulation continued along the course of the Connecticut, between Goodspeed's Landing and Higganam. _ 3. Triangulation on the eastern side of Hudson river, near Rhinebeck and Poughkeepsie. 4. Supplementary triangulation for revising work on the coast of New Jersey, near Shark river and Manasquam river. 5. A detailed topographical survey east of Brooklyn and between Flushing and Jamaica. This work completes the material needed for finishing the new chart of New York harbor. 6. 'l'he plane-table survey of Hudson rivef, continued from Tarrytown to Croton river, embracing the eastern shore of 'l'appan bay, the village of Sing-Sing, and other -villages. 7. Shore-line survPy from Tivoli npwards to Coxsackie, and hydrography of the Hudison river extended from Tivoli to Four-Mile Point. s. Hydrographic examination of the vicinity of Pea Patch island, in the Delaware river.

Gwdetic observatio71s at lJiount Torn and Samiford, ( JYiass. and Conn. )-Tl1e party under my imn1L~ diat.e direction was organized early in J unc,, to continue the primary triangulation on the coast of New England, for connecting tl1e Fire islancl and Epping bases. The prelirninarites required in the erection of signals and posting the heliotropers WC'rc attEmdcd to hy Assistant G. "'и Dean and Sllh-Assi~tant R. E. Halter, while the prq>arations rec1uired for occupying the stations were made, as usual, by l\ir. Thomas 1\lc Donnell. Station Mount Tom, in the towuslii11 of Northampton, Hampshire county, MaFsachusette, was firf't occnpic>d. The meaFmиement of l10rizontal angle8 at this point was commenced on the 11tl1 of July, but the atmosphere during the mouths of July and August proving unmmally hazy, and thP di~t:mcef\ to seve1иal of tlie signah being more than fifty miles, tl1ese observations were not completed until t.lw 16th of AuguFt. J\franwhile the requisite latitude and magnetic observations were made liy Assistant Edward Goodfollow, aiJed by Mr. S. II. Lyman. On cum1ileting the observations at llfount Tom, tl1e instruments and camp C"quipmcnts were transferred to Station Sanford, in the northwestern part of the tuwn~hip of Hain1Jdcn, Xew Haven l'.OUHty, UomH:c.ticut. The operations at this station were eimilar to those at J\Iount Tom. The mcasurcnwnt uf ho1иizontal angles at S:mfon1 w:1s LPgun on t11e 9th of Septcml1er, !mt tlie wcathC'r during that and the following month prnving still less favoral1k for geodctie operations than July and Augutit, the ol.iservations were not compll'tecl until the lltl1 of November. At Station ]\:fount Tom eight hundred and twent.v-six ob6ervatious we1иc mack with the thirty-inch thcodolite C. S. ?\o. 1, upon five signals and an elongation mark. The hi:ights of tlic several stations were determined from three hundred and ninety measurements of vertical angles, with the eight-inch Gambc-y ve1иtieal cirelc C. S. No. 57. At Station Sanford twelve hundred and seventy-nine oLscrvations were made иwith the thirty-ind1 tl1codolitc, upon eight signals and an elongation mark, aud the elcvatious of the s\'veral trigonometrical points were ascl'rtained from five lmudred and twenty-eight mca8urerneut~ of the vertical m1glt,s, with the \"ertieal circle No. 57. At ]\fount Oarmcl the angle between Stations TaRlma and Sandford was mea~med with tl1e Gambey theodolite C. S. No. 57. The most distant signals whieh were olisPrvetl on during the Reason were tl10se at 1\fount Tom anc1 Station Sanford, being about fifty-six milc-8 from each other in a dirrct line. Two other Bignal'3 were more tlmn fifty miles distant, and two were al.iout forty-three miles from the point of ol.iscrvation. The rclati>'e positions of the several stations may he seen by reforeuce to Sketch No. 1. The area witl1iu the limits of the triaugulation completed during the sea:;on-estimated in the usrn1l manner-is thirteen hundred ancl seventy-five square miles. The geodetic ol.iservatious were chiefly made by Assistant G. W. Dean and Sub-Assistant IL E. Halter. Latiturlc.-At .Mount 'l'om one hundnиd and E<evcnt.y-two obsc-rvations were made with the zenith telescope C. S. No. 5, upon thirty-six sets of stars, and tl1e arc value of the micrometer was obtained from one hundred and twenty-two observations upon Polaris, near its eastern elongation. 'l'he local time wa>< obtained from one hundred and thirty-two observations upon twenty-four zenith and circumpolar stars, with the twcutyfour-inch transit 0. S. No. 10. At Station Sanford the latitude was ascertained from one lmnd1иed and 8ixty-onc observations with the eqnal altitude instrument C. S.

from the telescope. The local time was ascertained from one hundred and twenty-two observations upon ninete~n zenith and circumpolnr stars with the twenty-four inch transit C. S. N(). 10. The observations for latitude and time we1иe made by A8~i~tant Edward Goo<lfellow, aided by Mr. S. H. Lvman. и Azimuth.-Thc astronomical meridian and benri11gs of the trigonometrical lines from Stations Mount Tom and Sandford were determined with the thirty-inch thcorlolite by the usual methods of the survey. At Mount Tom eighty-fonr oliRervat.ionR were made upon (; Ursre Minoris, near its upper culmination, and eighty obser_ vation~ upon Polaris, neu,r its eastern elongation, in connexion with one hundred and fifty readings on the elongation mark, which was established in a favorable locality nea1и the summit of Mount Holyoke, about four and a l1alf miles from the geodetic station at Mount Tom. At Station Sandford the azimuth obeervation8 consfated of ninety readings upon Polaris, near its caetern elongation, aud eighty-two readings upon~ Urs:e "llfinoris, near ito; uprиer eulminat.ion, in comwxion with one hundred and sixty-two observations upon the elongation mark, which was favorably located upon tl1e summit of a small hill, about one and a half milef' in a westerly direction from the station-point at Sandford. These observations were made by Assistant Dean, who was aMisted by Sub-Assistant Halter. The field operations were closed on t.he 11th of NoVf~mber. - JJlagnetie obsenations.-The geological formation of )fount Torn being chiefly of trap rock, (green stone,) no reliable magnetic results could be obtainБ!l. near the geodetic station, although, by wny of experiment, the magnetic declination and dip were approximately ascertained at 8everal localitie8 near the summit. For this purpose four complete set:i of observations were made Ly As,;istant Goodfellow with the dip circle C. S. No 4, at two points, the re1>ults of which differed ten degrees. 'l'he results obtained for declination were still less sati;;factory than thMc for dip, as it wa,;:; soon ascertained that the needle of a land eurveyor's compass would take any in<licated direction by changing the position of tl1e instrument only a few inches. 'l'he same phenomenon waH ahio oL~erved by :Mr. Dean at tl1c summit of Mount Holyoke, the geologic;il forumtion of that mountain being similar to that of Mount Tom. Experimental ouservationR for ascertaining the magnetic declination and dip were made within the rnrlo8Pd grounds of \Yilliston Seminary, near the centre of the village of Easthampton, about two and a half miles in a northwesterly direction from the station at Mount Tom. No unusual loeal dh;turbances were noticed at this locality; and .Mr. "\Yillistcm, with the other gentlemen connected with the seminary, kindly offoring to extend to the Coast Survey every rcr1uircd facilit.y, a complete set of magnetic observations was made near the seminary buildings. 'l'hese consisted of <me hundred and sixty-five observations, on three days, for ascertaining the declination, and four sets for determining the dip of the needle. The horizontal intensity and mament of inertia were deduced, from three sets of vibrations and deflections, on two days. At Station Saudforr1 expииrimental observations were made at several points in the immediate vicinity of t]1e geodetic station, but no indications of local attraction were dis..:overed; accordingly, a complete series of magnetic observations were made near the summit of the hill. For this pmpose, one hundred and seventyfinl ob~errations wc>re made, on three days, for determining the declination, and four sets, with three needles, were observed for ascertaining tho inclination of the needle at two points. The horizontal intensity and momrnt of iue1иtia were obtained from three set,; of vibrations and deflection~, on two day~. The magnetic ob~ervations were made by Assistant Edward Goodfellow and Mr. Lyman. JJleteorological obseriиations.-The usual meteorological journals were kept by Mr. H. M. Dewees, who wag attached, as geodetic recOTder, to my party during the season. Two hundred and ninety reading11 of the barometer, and the wet bulb arnl dry bulb thermometers, in com1exion with the direction and force of the wind, were noted in t11e journals. ]\fr. C. P. Bowdit.ch was attached as volunteer aid in my party during the five weeks of his college vacation in July and August, and his efficient services were appropriately aekuowledge<l by Assistant Dean. All the original records were duplicated, and the reductions of the latitude, azimuth, and magnetic observations were completed before the party left the field. 'l'be number of volumes of records and reductions deposited in the archives at the close of the s-eason was forty-nine. Triangulation ef Conn1иcticut riuer.-This work was again taken up at Goodspeed's I..anding, and has been xtended northward and westward to include the course of the river to t.he vicinity of Higganam. Sketch No. 10 shows the extent of the river embraced in the work of this and the previous s-eason. SubAssistant W. S. Edwards resumed the triangulation soon after his return from Section V, his service in whfo:h will be stated in another place in this report.

Sub-Assistant l\Ieclian and ::\Ir. Harding were soon after assigned to topographical service for the 6th army corps in Section III. The schooner Arago was laicl up at Poughkeepsie. Hydrograpliic examination in Delaware river.--In March last instructions were given to Assistant George Davidson to make a special and detailed examination of the vicinity of the l'ea Patch, in Delaware river, for purposes of defence, and to proceed in that duty under the direction of Captain 0. F. Pendergrast, U. S. N., commandant of the navy yard at Philaclclphia. From l1i8 examirnttions of the preYions year l\lr. Davidson was cnalJfod to determine immediately the locality which required examination. The wnrk was reduced at once, and tracings from the sheet were иplaced in the hands of the r.ommandant. The original sheets and traced copies were also forwarded to the office. In fitting out his party for senice at very short notice, Assistant Davidson acknowledges the aid cheerfully rendered by Captain T. Turner, U. S. N., at the navy yard. 'l'raeings also of parts of the survey made last year were furnished to Captain A. A. Gibson, U. S. A., commanding at :Fort Delaware, and duplicates of all the sl1ects of wurk from Newcastle to Reedy Point were Rent to General Totten, chief of the corps of engineers, who has specially acknowledged the importance of the developments. The original sheet of 18Gl and duplicates of the sounding and tidal registers haYe been filed in the office. .A comparatiYe chart of the Delaware river, between Newcastle and Reecly Point, was made in the office last spring, to represent, tngether, the hydrographic surveys of 1841 and 1861. This sheet exl1ibits great and important changes that have occurred within the space of twenty years. Tlieir nature was clearly stated in a special report made by Assistant Davidson soon aft.er closing his survey. The changes appeared of such moment to the commerce of Philadelphia that I placed the map before the Board of Trade, and, at their

request, }fr. Davidson gave t11e members full and clear oral explanations in regard to the alterations that had taken place, and of the im11ortance of the developments which arc yet in progress. Resolutions were pa~scd by the board thanking him for the statements. Assi,;t:mt Davidson was occupiecl uuriug the summer with a party in Section VI, to the operations of which allusion will be made further on in this report. In the autumn he executed lcvellings at League island and Red Bank for the use of the navy yard commission, and macle himself useful, besides, by his spec:ial knowledge of localities. lrlagnetic observatirms.-ln some of my previous annual reports charts have been given showing approximately the direction of the lines of equal magnetic V!ll'iation traced seaward and inland from stations along the coast at which the fllements have been from time to time well determined. Those alluded to may be found in the report for 18.~6, Sketcl1 No. 61, and in that for 1861, Sketch No. 30, and they show the present state of our knowledge on the subject. '\Vi th a view to greater precision in the direction of the lines given for the coast of the middle States, in whiel1 I had personally determined the magnetic elements in 1840-'41, Assistant C. A. Schott wae directed to reoccupy Beven of the stations in July and August of the present year. The observations at the coast stations were made at the expeme of the Coast Survey, and those of the interior ones at the cost of the Smitl1sonian I11stit11tion. :Mr. Schott commenced at Harrisburх;, Pa., and on the 28th aud 29th of July determined the declin~tion, dip, and 110rizontal intensity of the magnetic needle in the grounds of the State capitol. Proceeding westward be made similar observations on the 31st at the position which I had previon,.ly used, on the national road, about five miles e:ist of BrownEvill<i, in Fayette county. At Erie, Pa., the demnts were <leternilned in like manm,r, on the 6th and 7th of August, on Seventh stiиeet near French. At Hath, N. Y., the station in the public park, opposite to the postиoffice, was occupi0d in the Bame way on the 11th; and on the 13th of August the }JOsition near Dickinson scmin:1ry, in the borough of i:Yilliamsport, Lycoming county, Pa. 'l'wo stations in the grnunds of the Girard college, Philadelphia, were occupied on the 15th and 16th of August. 'l'he observations at each .of the plnces comprised: for dc,dination, three Bets to ascertain the time and azimuth, of six readings each, and frequent readings of the scale of the declination magnet, continued for several hours. For the magnetic dip two sets of observations were recorded from two needles, and the same number with the polarity reversed. The intensity was ascertained by two sets of vibrations and two sets of deflections. Six sets of observations were made in determining the time of one hundrecl and fifty vibrations. For all three of the magnetic elements the various processes, either in full or in part, were repeated, so as to have one tSet of observations recorded in the forenoon and tl1e second set in the afternoon. The instruments used were magnetometer, No. 3; the Barr~w Dip Circle, Ko. 8; and mean time chmи nomctcr, Hutton 211. Determinations of the instrumental constants and also of the magnetic elements were made at Washington, further notice of which will be seen nuder the head of Section III. Taking into account the interval of time between the series of observations in 1840-'41 and that of the present season, it is reasonable to expect that. comparison of the results will give much information in rega1иd to the secular change of the magnetic elemente. The discussion of the observations is nearly completed, at my own expense, and will probably be publi13hed in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge . .Assistant Schott was accompanied by Mr. P. H. Donegan, who recorded the observations and duplicated the registers. Both sets, as well as the detailed computations, have been placed in the office. The reBulta found are given, in tabular form, in Appendix No. 18. Tidal observations.-The pe.rmanent self-registering tide-gauge at Governor's island, in New York harbor, has continued in operation during the year, under the charge of Mr. R. T. Bassett. Observations for comparison have also been made at the dock of the Atlantic Ferry Company, in Brooklyn. I am indebted to the courte~y of the superintendent of the U uion Ferry Company, who has replaced the small building which covered the tide-gauge at Brooklyn by a better one, after it had become necessary to remove the old structure for repairs to the wharf. и c. s. 5

Triangulation ef tli,e Potomac rii>er.-.At the end of the 1mrvcying season of 1860 this work had reached Blackistonc bland, (Ree Skdch Xo. 1:1.) whf'rc itи fnrtl1cr progress from the entranct' of the river was stopp<'d for a yrnr by the hMtilitics whiel1 hmkt> o:it in the spring of 1861. In order to mrct t11e demand erm8erp1cnt upon the war, a rapid hydrogrnphic rPconnaissnnce was ordered at once, the pnrticulars of which Wl'rc stated in my rcport of la~t year. Tim res11lting slrntd1 wns much in dPmand during tbe ensuing twelve months, nnd was lnrgPly distribntNl for the use of the navy. On the opening of tlie BJlring campnign of 1862 spf'cial requeFt was made hy tlw 1\avy DepRrtment for a minute hydrographic survl'y of the I'otomac, and ~tPps were at once taken for resuming tl1e tri:mg-ulntion at Blackistone island. By the authority of the Hon. Secretary of the Treasury, Profe~sor Fairman Rogers, of Philadelphia, was made acting Assistflnt in the Coast Survey, and was put in charge of t1w general field and office arrangements of this survey. Sub-Assistants F. P. 'Vebber and Charle~ Ferguson were n~signed to assist in the preliminary work, and competent topographers were detaill'd to make the plane-table survey, as will be stated at more length preRently . .A reconnaissance was made by I'rofessor Rogers early in May, and a preliminary base line of 1.188 metres measured 1,y him at the west side of the moutl1 of Port Tobacco river, with the slide contact wires Nos. 5 and 6. From the stations at the ends of the base the triangulation was extended down the river to Blackistone Island light, and from the base up the rinr as far as Occoquan, hy thP 19th of June, when Professor Rogers was called away by other duties and r'linquished the service, which, it is here in place to remark, he luid undertaken to prosecut<' for a limited prriod as a volunteer. At the date mentioned the very considerable stretch of sixty milEs of the course of the Potomac had bPen triangulated, and the topographical survey, whicl1 was commencl'd soon after the triangulation, was in progress. On the 19th of Ju y the triangulation was resumed at Occoqu.m by Mr. Charles Hosmer, and in the following thirty days was pushed quite up to Georgetown, and to a connexion with the trfangulation of part of the District of Columbia, made by him~clf and by Sub-Assistant Ferguson in the winter of 1861-'62. In the me surc>ment of the preliminai-y base Professor Roger8 was assisted by Messrs. Longfellow and IIalter, of the topogmpl1ic.'ll party. The statistics of the triangulation of the river from Bluckistone island to Georgetown are as follows :

In the work below Occoqmm thrQe theodolites were used, viz: the Gamhey ten-inc11, No. 82; t110 Wiirdemann eight-inch, No. 86; and the six-inch Brunner, No. 64. The angles above Occoquan were measured with the six-inch Gambey, :N"o 65. Professor Rogers bearJ:! testimony to the cordial disposition manifested by the officers on duty at the W a8bington navy yard to assist bim iu the work by all means in their power. }'or the reconnai!lsance the steamer Powell was lent by Lieutenant Commander W ymap. Sub-Assistants Webber and Ferguson, who had worked assiduously in the triangulation of the Potomac, took up field duty in Section I early in July. 'l'he theodolite stations used for the survey of the Potomac were marked by small wooden posts, and those below Occoquan were set in hydraulic ct>ment. Topography ef tlie Potomac rit1er.-The foll provision made for this work has been referred to in a previous notice in this chapter. .Four experienced topographers-Assistants H. L. \Vhiting and A. W. Longи fellow, with Sub-Assistants John Meehan and R. E. Halter-were a8signed for the survey. Two schooners were furnished for the use of the parties. Soon after the work commenced Mr. Charles Hosmer replaced Sub-Assistant Halter, who had been taken i11. The topography was begun on the 19th of May. Eleven plane.table sheets were turned in by the 25th of June. Of tlwse one was executed by !Ir. "Whiting, showiug the Virginia shore of the l'otomac from Persimmon Point to Metomkin Point, and, on the J\!arylan<l side OJiposite, the shores of J>ort Tobacco river. Four sheets were turned in Ly Mr. Longfellowи, containing surveys of the Marylaml shore from Swan J>oiut to the "Trunk," above l'asquel1anna crePk; abo from Upper Cedar Point to Smith '8 Point, and from Uudd's Ferry to Indian ll'arl. Mr. J\fecl111n returned three sheet1<, giving the Virginia lllwre from Lone Locu8t Point to }>cr~immon Point; also from ~Ietomkin Point to Aquia creek, an<l from Quantico creek to High Point, including also the moutl1 of the Occoquan river. A

36

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

fourth sheet sent in by him contains the s11ore-lino survey of Nanjemoy river, on the Maryland side. Mr. Hosmer traced the Maryland shore from Cob Point to Swan Point, and, on a second sheet, the Virginia side from A<]uia creek to Quantico creek. The length of river-course included in the sheets above rt>frrred to is about sixty miles, and the aggr<'ga.te of shore-line tmced was one hundred and twenty-nine miles. The mouths of tl1c principal creeks which empty into the Potomac were followed, and careful rnrveys were made of the immediate sites of all the rebel batteries that lrnd been erected on the Virginia shore of the river dnring the year 1 SGI. lfr. Hosmer, after completing the triangulation of the Potomac between Indian Head and Georgetown, as mentioned in a previous notice, took up and completed the survey of the remaining thirty miles of shoreline, closing the topography on the 30th of August, on the plan adopted for the sheets below Occoquan. The lateness of the season and nиstridion iu time making it impra.cticable to take in the usual breaclth of shore, i'\O ai'I to pPnnit the issue of a full chart of the river tliis year, the plane-table survey of the immediate shores only was executed. The total of sho1иe-line traced by the parties is one hundred and fifty-nine miles. }fr. Hosmer's closing work in .August joins near Mount Vernon with a reconnaissance made in the previous year by Sub-Assistant Meehan. On the Marylanu side he traced twenty-one miles of sl10re above Indian Head. Before the close of .August a cl1art of the Potomac was issued in three sheets, showing the banks and channel, the buoys and ligl1ts, and the eailing lines, from the entrance of the river to the mouth of the Occoquan. The fourth sl1eet, making the c11art of the river complete to GPorgetown, was issued in September. These contain the preliminary soundings determined by the reconnaissance macle in 1861. I will state further on, the details of hydrography, done on the basis of the recent plane-table surveys. The topographers who worked on the lower part of the Potomac were in June assigned to duty in Sections I and II. Plane-table surreys at Williamsport, . JJd.-Tl1is work was done at the reque1:1t of Major General Franklin, who occupied the vicinity of 'Villiamt<port in October with the sixth corps of the army of the Potomac. l\lr. Charles Hosmer was detailed to execute the required topography on tlie 2d of OetobPr, ancl on the 15th was joined by ::\fr. F. A. Lueber. The p1иincipal roads leading out of the town towards Hancock, Hagerstown, and Sharpsburg were, respectivl:ly, traced to the distance of thrl'e miles. At the end of the m-Jnth the imrty was further increased by tlie a8signment of Sub-Assistant John Median and .M:r. ,V. '\V. Harding, and in the course of the first week of November the ground around Williamspmt was survPyed in detail. The working sheets show the general contom of surface of about fifteen square miles, with about five miles of the course and banks of the Potomac at 'Yilliamsport. Mr. Hosmer moved at the end of October with the corps of General Franklin into Virginia, and continued reconnaissance duty. He has since received instructions to report to.Major General Banks for special topographical service on the eoast of Texas, for which his local knowledge promises great usefulness. The previous duty of the parties employed with the sixth corps will be stated in other parts of this chapter. Mr. Harding ha~l p~ssel the gre.lter part of the working season in Sectio11 V, as will be mentioned under that head. Sub-Assistant Meehan remained near Williamsport until the 14th of November, and completed the survey of the environs. He forwarded the topographical sheet to the office, and then was placed under orders for duty with the army division of General Franklin. Topograpltical .~un;ey near Bladensburg, )}Irl.-A map of the country lying just outside of the District of Columbia, and north aud east of Bladenflburg, was commenced in the middle of Octobeiи by Sub-AEsistant C. l\I. Bache. This, like similar work done last year, was nuder the immediate direction of I~ieutenant Colonel J. N. Ma(',omb, of the topographical engineers. Details of hands and means of transportation were furnished by the military department. Mr. Bache is still engaged with the plane-table in the vicinity of the northeastern comer of the District, and has already mapped about five square miles of area, within which over twentv-five miles of roads have been traced and nearly four miles of water-course. The tract on which he is empioyedи wt1l probably occupy the party until the end of November. His map, like others of tl1e environs of Washи ington of which mention will be made, shows the contour of the ground and the surface details generally. Mr. T. 0. Bowie has been assigned to duty in this party. Topography near tltc military difence8 ef Wasltinglon.-At fhe request of General Barnard, U. 8. Engineers, 8ub-Assistant .J. G.

He was, howrver, soon compelled to close field duty, not having sufficiently recovered from the effects of a rifhи-"hot by which he was wounded in the lung" whi:e cniraged in Section VIII. Being still anxionH fmи suel1 fip]J service as he might find practicable in a climate milder tlian that of this section, he has been diiиected to report for g<'nnal duty on the southwestern coa~t, iu the perfonnance o( which he will be under the immediate orders of 1\fojor General Banks. Topograpl1y ef Fa,;ifax cnunty, Ya.-Thi~ work waR ailaitiona1 to extensiv<> plane-tal:ile smиv<-yR made last year of the entire ground which was occupied by the army of the Potomac. As statpd in my lal't annual report, the topography was executed under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel J. K. Macomb, then chief topographical engineer of that army. 'I'hc map~ made and photographed last summer at the office Фbowed a vacant epace of scYeral square miles, corrc~ponding to ground which was then occupied by the enemy, to the north and eru-t of Fall~ Church. The topography along the Potom>tc Hhows on the same sh<иets a breadth of only a mile and a half between Fort Marcy and Bailey's Cross-roads. On the 4th of October, and after the cnmpletio11 of much Sl'rYice of the rnme kind, wliich will be stated in geographical order in this sectiou, the suryey of the ground alluded to was commenced by Mr. 'I'. \V.

The SUITC'Y was b<'gun on the 27th of I.farcl1, and embraced tlie contour of a Lclt a mile in breadth, mostly on the l"outh side of the Orange and Alexandria railroad. Three miles of the track to Alexandria, and nearly as much of the branch lcadiug from the junction towmds Ccutrcville, with tlie wagon 1иoads and numerous intersecting tracks, were traced and carefully mapped. 'l'he contour linPs were drmvn in for s11cc<'ssive elevations of ten foet. All the iutrenc11ments were eketc1H'rl in position, including an exteneive detachec1 work. al:out two miles east of the junction; also the pol'<itions of the ruined structure8 at the junction, and the exteusive Larrncks found at three points on the south side of the railroad. ' 'l'he map of the locality was drawn on a large scale, and was at once photographed at the office, so as to meet pogsible requirements. 'This work occupied tJ1c party until tlie 6t]1 of l\fay. J\Ir. 1\'!titing left J\Ianassas a few days before, for field service on the shores of the Potomac, and was afterwarde employed in Sections I and II. Sub-Assistant Bache at once took up topngrnphical duty for the army of the Rappahannock. Topograpkical .иernice on the Rnppalwmwck rfrer, Va.-The advantagP, for transportation and other military uses, of correct maps of tlie ground occupied by Lis army had been fully appreciated by Major General McDowell in tl1e campaign of 1861. At his request, which was made known to me through Colonel J. N. Macomb, A. D. 0. and chief of topographical eugine('rs in the army of tbc Rappahannock, the services of Coast Survey topographns were continued after the arrival of the staff at .Fredericksburg, Va. SnbAssistant 0. M. Bael1e and Mr. T. W. Uobbins, being assigned to duty, read1ed headquarters on the 9th of May, and reported to Colonel Macomb. On' the 12th a general topographical reconnaissance was made; tlie stations used in the survey of the Rappahannock in 1853 were vil'itcd, and means were taken for conncctiug the new work with the points then determined. The centre line and grades, requisite as data in the reconstruction of tl1e railroad bridge across tl1C river, were furnished by the party, as were also the points for locating a side track to lead from tl1e main line to the foundry, near the middle of the city of Fredericksburg. -On the 26th, direction Wit!! given by Colonel Macomb for a survey from the right bank of the Rappaliannock below the city, the topographers to report to Brigadier General King, the sta1f officers haviug been

The parties were accordingly r('ruoved to the north L:mk, and commenc<><l work, one opposite to .Fnиcleriek~burg and the other near :Falmouth, on the :!cl of June. }'ield-work with the planetable, compass, and chain was continued by both parties until the 7th of July. 'l'he eon tour of' the gruuml and all details, as roads, streams, &c., of impOTtance for defenr<ive purposes, on the left bank of the; ltappaи bannock, were mapped on two Bl1eets, which Bhow the country from :Falmouth to a point nearly a mile below the railroad bridge, and seVl'ral miles back from tlie river, towards Aquia creek and Potomac creek. On a third ;;heet Mr. Robbins trnet~d in from nиconuais~ance the line and topography of the main road from Fredc1иirksburg to Jielle Plain, at the mouth of Potomac creek, and, from a point higher up that stream, the J<'redericksburg railroad and the main wagon road to a junction with the survey of Sub-.Assistant _Bache, near the head of Claiborne'8 creek. 'l'he details of men required for this work were furnished by Brigadier General .Augur, from the 24th regiment New York volunteers. As soon as practicable after their completion the plane-table sheets were inked and turned in at the office iu 'Vashington. The results were t11ere reduced in scale and combined at once into a single map, of which, at the rpquest of Colonel Macomb. copies were made by the photographic prncess and furnished to him for tl1e use of the army. An area of about ten Rquare miles i;. r<'f>rPsented by the map, exclusive of the lines of road which connect the environs of Frederick~burg with tl1e waters of the Potomac. After inking his sheet Sub-Assistant Bache was assigned to plane-table duty in Section II ; but, a call having reached me very soon after for topographical service in another divi;,ion of the army, himl!elf and Mr. Robbins were recalled, and held subject for duty in any emergency that might arise. Tor graph.ica1 seniice between l'f;rk and Janus rivers, Va.-Mention was made in my last annual report of the connexion of Coast Survcиy parties with the army of tl1e Potomac, in the summer of 1861, in the Yicinity of 1IBl1ington. 'rhe high teRtimony then given by the military authorities a~ to their usefulness led to the assignment of Sub-Asgistant :F. ,Y. Dorr and Mr. J. W. Donn for special field duty in the campaign which was begun in 1\larch laet by Major General McClellan. In order to secure conformity to all the requirements of the milita1-y department, the services of Mr. Durr aud ll1r. Donn were placed at tlrn disposal of Brigadier General A. A. Humphreys, chief of topographical engineers in the army of the Potomac, to whom the two topographers reported for duty on the ;!0th of :March. On tbe way to Fortress Monroe the party engaged in the compilation of a map of the peninsula between York and James rivers, and completed it several days after their arrival at the fortress on the Sth of' April. The next duty assigned and executed was a plane-table survPy of the road and adjoining counu-y fro;n Half-way House to headquarters, or within five miles of Yorktowu. Subsequently the Rurvey was extended to the outer liues of the army when distant only about three-quarters of a mile from the rebel intrenchments. The positions of important points were determined from a base of which one end rested at the building known ae the ""-hite House," the ot.her end being the fort beet point reached in the survey of the main road. Bcside.s these, determinations were made of prominent houses lower down, on the river shore. The positions thus ascertained sufficed for connecting the work with the topographical survey of the shore of York river made in J 857 hy Assi::1tant Seib. On tl1e 16th and 16th of April, Messrs. Dorr and Donn surveyed the Warwick road, from Harward'e mill to Warwick Court-House, and connected their work with a plane-table survey, made from the OourtHouse to Lee's mill, by Sub-Assi8tant P. C. l<'. West, who was then on furlough from the Coast Survey and serving as aid to Brigadier General W. F. Smith. On the following day, while Mr. Dorr was connecting Mrи 'Vest's survey with that of the main road, his plane-table was struck by a shell from a rebel battery near Wynn's mill and entirely destroyed, together with a part of the working sheet. The part, however, on wliich were represented the positions of the lи1tteries and the desired connexion was fortunately uninjured. Lieutenant Orlando G. 'Wagner, of tl1e topogmphical e11giuee1иs, standing near by at the time, was mortally wounded, as was also one of the soldiers, Prhиate J eny Luther, of the second Rhode Island regiment, attached to the imrveying party. One of the pickets was killed outright and several were wounded. The alhidade was blown from Mr. Don's hand and the sleeve of hi~ coat torn away, but he received no personal iujury

except a slight scratch on the hand. He r<>sumed tl1e s1irvey at once иwith a compass rmd chain, and completed it from Y<>rk rivc>r to Lee's mill arul 1Yarwick Court-I-IonRe on the 18th of April. Another plane-table, to supply the place of the one destroyed, lrnvi1Jg bctиu promptly forwarded from the office by rt>quest of General J\1cUlellan, J\1r. Dorr cart>fully surv<>yed иw orml1иy 'i; cret'k and itR brandies, making a junction with the survey of Mr. Seib, previously referred to, as well as with his own surv(7s. That work was closecl jnRt previous to the evacuation of Yorktown. A short interval before had been em. ployed in making tracings from the completed surveys, for military use. After the retreat of the enemy up tlie peninsula, Sub-Assistant Dorr surveyed the works which had been erected by the ini<nrgentR between the main road and Lee's mill, imd that service was not quite complete when the party was ordered to move on after the army. Sub-Assi~tant 1\-est had made a can~ful plane-table snrvey of the battle field of "\Villiamsburg, to accompany a report of t11f' battle, by Jjrigadier General Smith. '.l'hree miles west of the town that survey was again taken up on the 10th of 1\fay, and continued by tlm party uninterruptedly to New Kent Court-House, ineluding also the rnad leading theuce nearly to Eltham, and that to Cumberland on the Pamuukey iиiver. lllr. Dorr reached "\\'bite House," on the Pamunkey, ou the 16th of l\lay. l\1r. Uorm next day surveyed the wagon road and line of railroad leading out from that point westward, as far as Tunstall's Station. On the 18th a general reconnaissance was ordered by >arium; routи s to the Chickahominy river. The line of railroad and country adjacent to it were allotted to the party of lllr. Dorr. By nightfall he had aclvancerl si;ven miles. and had sketched a belt of about a mile in breadth. '.l'be reconnaissance was pushed forward to the railroad bridge across the Chickaliominy, and its coudition was reported. Itcturniug, the road was run which leads from Turner's mill eouthward to Baltimore Crossroads, a point on tl1e main road passillg from New Kent Court.-Houee to Bottom's bridge. ImmediatPly after the movement of the army to the Cbickabominy, wliich took place on the 2ht and and 2:!d of :May, :Mr. Dorr surveyed the road from Dee-patch Station to Coal Harbor, sketel1ing:._iu tlie topograpl1ical features between the road and tl1e river, am! making careful examinations with reference to suitable positions fur bridges. His survey was then connected near Dr. Gaines's homrn with plane-table work by Sub-Assistant West, which took in details between the aame road and the river, but higher up, and to a point within three milt's ot l\fecbanicsville. All the rmids divergiug from Mechai1icsvme, l'XC<'pting the one whid1 leads to Meadows'!' bridge, were run by Messrs. Dorr and Donn, and contour lines of twenty feet elevation were traced around tlic village and to the distance of several miles in all directions. Sub-Assist;rnt Dorr mapped the vicinity of the railrnml, frmn the Cliickalwminy to Fair Oaks Station, on the 28th of May, anrl then imn-<>yed the 1Villiam~lrnr;; roaJ fonu Savage Station westward to the outer line of pickets. 1\Ir. "\Yest at the same time made a plane-table curny of the west bank of the Chickahominy, between Sum11e1и's uppe1и bndge and the up1ler trestlP bridge. Contour line,; al,;u were ruu wit.Ii great care Ly the party for each ten foet of elevation of most of the ground in front of General Sumner':< position. The ro~d from Tyler's house to Savage Station, across Sumuer's lower Lridge, was traced and mapped by ~Ir. Donn. South of the railroad and west of the Chickal10mi11y the ground generally, including the minor roads near :Fa.ir Oaks and the various roads kadiug to the "White Ouk Swamp, were examined and tmced by the party of .Mr. Dorr\Vhen the flank movement of the army had been decided on in the latter part of June, the party was 01иdered to examine all the roads branching from the \\'illiarnsburg stage road in the direction of the swamp. This was promptly done, and of a numbE~r examined and reported 011, one practicable route, in addition to the one in previous use, was found. Near midnight of the 28th of June, Messrs. Dorr and Donn were detailed as guides for General Sykes'i< division, which had been ordered to pa8R through to the James river. The intenee darkne~s and heavy rain made the service somewhat difficult, but the cntmnce of tlie road wtio soon found, and the division reached Woodbury's :Ford early on the following morning. Mr. Donn returned to the Ooast Survey office on the 3d of July, and Y.ear the end of that month joined the party of Assistant Whiting in Section II. Suh-.A.1<sistaut Dorr remained with the army and made a survey" of the ground of occupation in the vicinity of Harrison's Landing, on the James river. He was detached from duty with tlie army on tlic 14th of July, and reporter! at the office on the following day. During the aut.umn he executed a firld rPconnaissance and made a map of the envfrons of Portlaud, Me., for military defonc, which l1as bl'en more fully referred to under the head of t:'ection I. He is now under orders for duty iu Section YI. Verification of t~o8rapk_y.-Assistant A. M.

after the completion of work which will be referred to further on in this chapter. "'fhe line was started at Snead Station on Ohincotcagu<' b11y, (see Sketeh ~o. 13,) w th two other trim1gnlation points, for obtaining a COITect position, and tlwn a series of eourse8 was run in the same general direction with the plane-table and chain for a distance of 15.41 miks, tu the heacl of Pocomoke sound, which had been surveyed by A,.;~i><tant Seib." Tlie number of courl'es was forty, the longPst being nearly a mile and the shorte~t about a hundnиd and fifty yards in length. The station marks on the Chesapeake sirfo being lost, made it impracticable to connect the two surveys at any intermediate point, without tifangulation, or to verify the topographical survey which had been carried nearly across the head of the peninsula in the vicinity of the boundary line, in the surveying season of 1859-'GO. On closing with the Chesapeake shore-line, J\ssiBtant Ha1Tison found a difference of fifty metres, which may properly be regarded as due to the error of the plane-table, when worked without occasional iиeference to points of tritrngulation as checks . .Mr. Chitrl!'-s Ho~me1и, who liad completed an extensive survC'y for military purposes, aided Mr. Harrison in this duty. Mr. ll. \Y. Bache was attached to his party as aid, aucl was employed in ,this and other duty iu tl1t' H'ction. Topography ef Accomac county, Va.-At the rf'qucst of ~fajor General Dix, a party, in c11arge of Mr. Charfos Hoemer, was assigned in Dccernbt,r, 1861, for the survey of tl1c vicinity of Drummondtown. that part of Accomac county bei11g then occupied by United States fore''" undl'r Brigadier General Lockwood, as was stated in my last annual report. Mr. Ho10mcr, aided by ML F. A. Lueber, comnwnced, on the 17th of Dcc1иmber, a survey (see Sketch l\o. 13) which joins on the ea:>t with one of tlic topographical sheets of the Atlantic coast, and on the, we:;t with a sheet of the snrvpy of Chesapeake bay.

For thi;; survey General Lockwood made clet.ail::i of men from tLe second Delaware regiment, and, towards the clo~e of the season, from the second regiment of Maryland volunteers. Means ancl facilities for transportation were l'Upplied by Captain Tyler, brigade quartermaster, to whose courtesy and obliging disposition the working parties were much indehted. Although generally level the country around Drummoncltown is much intersected by roads, and these, with ot11er foaturc,i', pre8ent a large amount of detailed work on the topographical sheet. After completing this survey, Mr. lloemer assisted Mr. Harrison in revising the topography at the head of the penimmla, near the Virginia boundary line. The parties returned to the office in the latter part of May, and made immediate preparation for other field dut.y. During the summer Mr. Hosmer was employed on the shores of the Potomac. Plane-taUe surveys near Nor:folk and Pwtsmouth, Va;-An early opportunity was taken, after the possession of Norfolk was rPgaincd to the government, in May last, to trace on the original plane-table sheets of t.he Coast Survey the numerous b11t.tcries whicl1 had been en~ctecl in its vicinity by insurgents during the course of the previous year. This service wns performed by Assistant A. M. Harrison, in June, the requiaite facilities for working having been furnished by .Major General "\Vool ancl Brigadier General Viele. In the immediate vicinity of Elizabeth river the rebel forts and the entrenched ea.mp on Sewell's Point were surveyed and mapped, as were aho the fortifications on Craney island, besides thirteen, mostly of small size, at various points along the shores, and the Gosport navy yard, with a battery directly opposite to it on the river bank. The survey of the navy yard wa11 made on a large scale, to show its condition after the destruction of the buildings and shipping by the insurgents. Mr. Harmon says : " It presented a aad picture of devasta-

tion. Excepting the officers' quarters and one or two other buildings, all the edifices were burnt. The dry dock and the g auite lumber dock were not mate1-ially injured, though an attempt had been made to blow up the masomy which held the gate hinges of the dry dock. The gates were de:;troyed." Bc1stious which had been ercctcrl near the wall, to comm1md the approaches to the navy yard from the sout11, were also smveyed, and the positions dete1mi~ed of the remainH of several ve:<sels of the navy which had been burnt in the harbor. General Vif'le furnisl1ed a ste11m i ng and hands to aid in making the surveys. Mr. Harrison mentions, also, his indebtedness to Lieut. S. Lee Perkins, 2d regiment New York volunteers, acting engineer to General Viele, for sketches of several of the batteries on Elizabeth river. The positions of two other intrenched camps, designed to grni.rd the approaches .to Norfolk from north or south, were marked on an engmved tiketch, so as to admit of being transferred to the topographical sheets. Mr. H. W. Bache and Mr. F. A. J,ueher assisted in field duty in this i<ection, and also accompanied .Assistant Harrison when he resumed topog aphical work in Section I, in the latter pa t of July. 'I'he spt>,cial surveys made by the pa ty in the vicinity of Norfolk are on two sheets containing the details of the numerous intrenchments. Their positions have been laid down on the -original topographical sheets of the survey of 1854. All of these are now on file in the office. Hgdrography ef th.- Potomac river.-1'he hydrng apliic reconnaissance which was made last year in order to meet the exigencies of the naval and military Be1 vice, and which was then reported on, has been replaced by a tl1orongh su1 vey of the greater part of the Potomac below Georgetown. Lieutenant Commander T. S. Phelps, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, wiih a party in tlie steamer Corwin, took up the regular hydrogиaphy on the 29th of July-_ Abreast of Britton's bay and St. 'Jlcmcnt's bay (Sketch No. 13) he joined wo1k with the soundings which l1ad been mane in 18GO, and thence upwards extended the hydrography towards Indian Head. At the Kettlcbottom sl1011ls the soundings were made more than usually dose, no p oper channel having been developed by sounding in the ordinary way. The triangulation and plane-table survey on which the hydrogI'aphy of the Potomac was based has been noticed al1 eady in the beginning of this chapter. Lieut. Commander Phelps is still at work, and expects to complete the hydrography up to Indian Head by the elo:;e of the year.

Special servke in which the party in the Corwin was employed dmfog the spring will be referred to presently. Mr. Chailes Juuken aided in the hydrngraphy, and plotted the cha1t of the lower Potomac. The results will be transferred to the sheets of the preliminary chart which was at first issued with the soundings given by the reconnaissance. During such intervals as the duties of the office would permit, the Potomac, between Alexandria and the aqueduct at Georgetown, was carefully eonnded by Captain C. P. Patterson, chief of the Hydrographic Division. He Wal!! aided, until the 11th of July, by .1\1.r. L. Karcher, hav-ing commenced work on the 27th of May.

of Yorktown, in which the Corwin engaged as one of the flotilla, it was pTceived, on the morning of the 4th of May, that the intrenchments Lad been abandoued by tl1e enemy. Lieut. Comdr. Phelps at once rep01ted the fact to the flag-ship, and was directed to start up York river in company with the steamer Currituck. Near Queen's creek a company of rebel cavalry was dispersed by sl1ells from the COJ'win, and a schooner, a sloop, and a launch were captured within a run of thirteen miles above Yorktown, with military stores and personal effects of officers. Being so directed, the steamer joined the United Statf's gunboat Chocura, which was then passing up, on a reconnaissance towards the head of the river. иwest Point was found unoccupied, though fifty prisoners :&om civil life had been left there by the enemy, in 'wretched condition and without necessary subsietence. Efforts had been made to burn the lumber stored tl1He, and tlrn Corwin, in consequence, remained to prevent further destruction. A few hours before reacl1ing 'Vest Point the party had captured a second schooner, above Bigler's wharf, and next day took possession of a third, and of the sloop иWater Witch, which had bem abandoned in the Pamunkey river. Much info1mation was gab.ed by Lieut. Comdr. PLelps respecting.the movements of the rebel forces, and at once transmittf'd to the proper quarter. At this time the hostile garrison which had occupied Gloucester Point was known to be retreating up the east side of York river. To cover the po8sibility of an attempt to pass through "\Vest Point, Lieutи Comdr. Phelps, under di1 ection of the naval authorities, anchored uear the sl1ip-yard, ou the night of the 6th, so as to command the approaches to the town. Leaming, next morning, that previous measures had diverted the retreat to the east side of the Mattaponi, the Corwin started up that river, and by 3 p. m. had gone thhиty-six miles above West Point, learning on the way, however, that the rebel force had crossed during the night. In the evening the steamer returned to her anchorage at the sl1ip-yard, and by throwing shells during the night prevented the burning of the timber there by a party which had destroyed all the other public property in store. Under permfasion of the senior naval officer, the party of the Corwin disabled Trice's mill, in King and Queen county, which was at work for the rebel army, leaving it, however, capable of being run for the 11se of the neighboring inhabitants. The party took, at the same time, three teams laden with flour, which were on their way to the rebel troops at Dunkirk. On the drparture of the senior naval officer, Commander William Smith, on the 15th of May, for the James river, Lieut. Comdr. Phelps was left in charge to protect the government property which was then aceumulating at \'\'est Point and in the Pamunkey river. During this period of duty the Corwin retook several items of government property, amongst others twelve mail bags which had been the property of the -Cnitcd States Post Office Dc>partment, and recovered the gun of a rebel boat that had been burnt by her crew, on the 4th of May, to escape capture by the steamer. On the 14th of June the schooner Starlight was seized by a party from the Corwin, in the Potopotank river, and sent to the fleet, the fact being made clear that her owner was then serving as lieutenant in the insurgent army at Richmond. Others had been detained, and, after due process, released. The Corwin had, just previously, made another trip up the Mattapoui, in which all was found quiet. In the afternoon of the 21st of June the third officer of the Corwin, Mr. E. L. 'l'aylor, was sent, with a boat's crew, to King and Queen county, and found, in mail matter which was taken in its passage between Caroline county and Richmond, intimation that strong re-enfoi:cements had reached the rebel army on the 11th of that month. The letter containing it was immediately sent to General McClellan. Lieut. Comdr. Phelps remained at \\'est Point until the evening of the 1st of July, and then, in conи formity with orders, dropped down to Yorktown. Before doing so, he turned back the steam tra.nspmt Phila delJlhia, which, having passed up the river in the night with horBefl, had so mU!sed notice of the evacuation of the depot on the Pamunkey. In the course of liis service in the vicinity of West Point, Lieut. Comdr. Phelps made and sent to the office a' reconnaissance map of the Mattaponi river as far up as the junction of the Mantapike, and also of the course of the l'umunkey iиiver, from Wt-st Point to the military station at White House. On the 13th of July orders were received from the Holl. Secretary of the Navy, in accordance with whieh the Corwin returned to W aahington, and was afterwards employed in the duty wиhich has been referred to under the previous head. ' Hydrograp'liy ef Metomkin inlet and bay, Va.-'l'his work was ordered for the llSe <>f Brigadier General Lockwood, the depth and position of the bar and 9ourse o~ the channel from tl:ie inlet to the public wharf on Folly creek being necessary in the water communication with his command at Drmnmondtown. The inlet

had been surveyed in 1852, but, the character of the changes being unknown, commissary stores for the troops had been landed at Pnngoteague afrer its occupation, and from thence carted fifteen miles. After the survey by Assistant Harrison, which will now be iиeferred to, the stores were taken by the most direct way to the military station. Mr. Harrison commenced the resurvey in January, and met with unusually stormy weather, which much retarded the work. He found no noticeable chang~ in depth at Metomkin inlet, though the bar itself had shifted. Considerable changes had taken place in the shore-line. In reference to tlie alterations he says : "The beach just inside of the northern point at the entrance of the inlet has washed away as much as one hundred and fifty m<>tres; the entrance has widened; and the outer 8hore below the entrance has at one point been swept away for a breadth of more than three hundred metl'es." Details of men from the 2d Delaware and 2d Maryland regiments, and means for transportation, were furnished by General Lockwood. On the 6th of April Mr. Ilarrif!on placed a can buoy on the bar, with such means for security as were then available, but this was swept away a few days after by an unusually severe northeast storm. Two others, with sufficient chain, were afterwards procured at Chincotengue island. One of them, "a spar buoy, thirty feet long, painted red," was placed on the bar about a mile seaward from the entrance; and the other, "a second class can buoy, painted black and white," near mid-channel, about half a mile outside of the month of the inlet, and as much inside of the bar. After completing the hydrography Mr. Harrison's party joined that of Mr. Hosmer, and assisted iu the plane-table survC'y near Drnmmondtow n. A tracing combining the results of both surveys has been furnished to General Lockwood. Mr. II. W. Bache served as aid in the party of Assistant Harrison. After the completion of the hydrographic sheet the party was assigned to topographical duty in the vicinity of the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia, of which notice has been taken in this chapter, and, later in иthe summer, in the neighborhood of Xorfolk. l\fr. Hanison has been subsequently eugaged in Section I, and now h11S charge of the Drawing Division, at the office in "\Y ashington. Magnetic ohseri,ati01l8.-Before taking the field for the series of observations which bas been described under the head of Section II, Assistant C. A. Schott determined at the station near the Comit Survey office the constants of the instruments intended to be used. After his return to Washington Mr. Schott observed, as at the other stations of the present season, for the magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity at the station near the office. 'l'he results found are included with those of Section II in Appendix :So. 18. The instruments employed and general order pursued in regard to the observations have been referred to in the preceding chapter. Tidal ohseri,ations.-'I'he tidal observations at Old Point Comfort have been continued successfully by Mr. M. C. King throughout the year, notwithstanding the great liability to interruption last spring. A few intervals in the series, but of no great importance, were occasioned by the jarring of numerous transport steamers in bringing up at the wharf. SECTION IV.

FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING THE COAST OF PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PART OF NORTH CAROLINA..-(SKKT<JH D, No. 21.)
The surveys made in 8ection IV ;were for the use and chiefly undeT orders from the chief of the military department of North Carolina and the flag-officer of the north Atlantic blockading squadron. They comprise the following : 1. Hydrographic snrvey and development of Oregon inlet, N. C., and buoying of the channel into Pamplico sound. Buoys placed to mark the Middle Ground, and reconnaissance for marking the channel of the Neuse river to a point above Newbern. 2. Physical survey of Hatteral'! inlet, N. 0. This was directed by the commander-in-chief of the army, and was pro;iecuted with reference to the cause of encroachment on, and the devising of means for preserving, the site of the forts from further action by the waves of the sea. 3. Hydr-0graphic rel'Urvey of Beaufort harbor, N. 0., determining important changes in deptl1 and in the direction of' the channels. 'l'he same party traced t1ie altered shore-line of the entrance at Beaufort. This Sllt"V'ey was made by special request of the Navy Department.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

OFFict:-woRK.-The engraving of coast chart No. 37, Atlantic coast from Cape Henry to Currituck sound, Las been commenced; and preliminary charts of Hatteras inlet (resurvey of 1861) and of Beaufort harbor N. C., (resurvey of 1862,) have Leen drawn and lithographed. Hydrograplty ef Hatteras and Oregon inlets, lv-. U., and ''Pf'cial service in Pamplico sound.-My report of last year contained a notice of the hydrographic resurvey of Hatteras inlet aud examination of the currents, intended to facilitate the naval operations whicl1 were in progress in the fall of 1861. Tim result was that the new chart of the inlet only made more apparent the natural difficulties of the passage. Tracings from it were furnished fort.he use of the second ex11edition, which was preparing in the winter, under the command of Major General Burnside and Commodore (now Admiral) Goldsborough, to move in the waters of Pamplico and Albemarle sounds; and, as intimated in my last report, a party, well acquai11ted with the localities, was assigned to accompany the expedition, in crder to render such further service as might be needed. Assistant A. S. Wadsworth joined die military expedition of Major General Burnside at Annapolis on the 8th of January, and reported at once to Brigadier General .Foster. 1Vhen tl1e fleet arrived off Hatteras inlet the weather was bad; yet the local knowle<lge of Mr. Wads worth was made effective in verifying the recorded soundings, and in piloting vessels of the expedition througl1 the intricate channel of Hatteras inlet, and in keeping the channel buoyed. Though subject to rapid changes, the shoals near the entrance were found to haYe only slightly altered in contour since the careful survey made by Lieutenant Commander Phelps, in November, 1861. Tracings from all the plane-table sheets of the vicinity of Roanoke island and other quarters on this part of the coast had been made at the office on the full scale, and supplied for the use of the military and naval commanders. Mr. 1Vadsworth accompanied the joint expedition in the Ruccessful attack whicl1 was made early in February on the rebel forts and in trenched lines on Roanoke island, and after its occupation supplied tracings of the environs of the forts from the topographical l!hects. Fortunatdy, the minute topographical survey of the island was almost complete when tl1e war commenced, the instruments with which Sub-AssiRtant Meehan was workiug at its south end, to close the survey, being sei2ed in the spring of 1861. Having intimate local knowledge of the shores иof Albemarle sound, Mr. 'Vadsworth also attended the detacbment sent to Elizabetb City and to other points on its north side, and returned to Hatteras on the 11th of March. Ile accompanied the army in the expedition to Newbern, and there took eharge of the schooner Bancroft, whicb had arriYed on the 24th of March, with facilities for executing any special bydrography that might be needed in the military operations. The party in the schooner was employed until the 5th of April in setting stakes to mark the channel above Newbern, and on completingи that service returned to Hatteras, where preparations were at once made for joining the party of Assistant Henry Mitchell, who had been l'pecially assigned in March for the survey of Oregon inlet. This work waf! undertaken in the hope that a practicable channel might be found to shorten and facilitate the passage of small transports to Roanoke island. As8istant 1Vadsworth erected the signals and assisted in measuring the requisite angles. Returning with the party to Hatteras inlet in the latter part of May, lie went with it again to Newbern, and assisted in sounding the MiJdle Ground and in setting buoys. This service having been completed he returned to the inlet soon after, and reached Philadelphia with the Banc1иoft on the 14th of June. Jn his report (Appendix: No. 30) Assistant Mitchell gives details of his own operations, and refers to special work performed for the military authorities, which, however, lay quite within the scope of his instructions. Tl1ii,; embraced a reconnaissance of a portion of the Neuse river and the buoying out of the Middle Ground. Sailing directions were furnished for the use of the military department as soon as Oregon inlet was buoyed, which was done under die direction of Mr. Mitchell a few days after the arrival of his party. Tracings of the finished chart were sent at once to Major General Burnside and Commodore Goldi!borough, the service being completed on the 20th of May. The sounding out of the bar and seaward approaches of Oregon inlet was the work of only four days; but the survey of the Swash, where the winding channels are narrow and traversed by strong tidal drifts, proved a very slow and arduous undertaking. Assistant Mitchell says : . "Oregon inlet has worked to the southward since the plane-table survey of 1849, and as an avenue fur commerce it hat! greatly deteriorated. The chart shows only six feet and a quarter over the bar at mean low tide, and the channel lies so close along the north beach that it can scarcely be regarded as safe for sailing vessels, even in the best weather." The currents of this as of all other inlets connecting o'nr inland sounds with the ooean are -0Б the half.

tidal class ; that is, slack water occurs two or three l10urs before ancl after the high water stand, and the maximum Hood and ebb drifts oecnr, r<'spectively, at high and low waters. 'I'he shallowest bulkheads of tbe Swash, as shown on the chart, are. by one channel, four and a quarter feet; by the other, three feet. Vessels, especially steamers, whБ,n under good headway, may force through these sand ridges with, perhaps, a foot greater draught. The recent continual passing of steamers over the Hatteras Swa~h has, I am informed, deepened its channel materially. The steamer Alb(иlllarle, for the use of wl1ich Mr. .Mitchell received an order from Commodore Goldsborough, having met with an accident just before his party reached Newbern, arrang{'ments were made with Assistant Wadsworth by which tl111 two parties were combined, as already stated, on board the schooner Banc1иoft. Special allusion is made by Assistant 1\litchell to the cordial co-operation of Mr. 'Vadsworth. )Ir. Edward Cordell was attacl1ed to this party as l1ydrographic draughtsman, and was prompt and efficient in plotting the work and preparing the chart. 1\lr. 0. P. Dillaway served as aid, and Messrs. Ames and Sengtellcr as obsrrven;. Assistant Mitchell returned to the office at the end of May, leaving Mr. Wadsworth in charge of the vessel. He was subsequently employed in hydrographic duty in Section I. Assistant \Vadsworth remained at the office after his return in June. He died in 'Vashington on the 9th of August. In a letter addreseed to me, dated "Headquarters Department of North Carolina, !tfay 31, 1862," Major General Burnside says : "I beg leave to express to you my high appreciation of the services of Mr. Henry Mitchell and party, of your department, at Oregon inlet and in the Neuse river. They have worked most faithfully, and given us very valuable charts, s11iling directions, and general information." Physical survey ef Hattera.Y inlet, 1V. C.-In my report of last year I rrferred to the faet that I had, at the request of :Major General McClellan, sent 011e of my assistants, Mr. Henry Mitchell, to inquire into the nature and causes of the encroachments of the sea upon Fort Hatteras, and the changes in the form of the in1et. Mr . .Mitchell remained at and near .Fort Hatteras until the 9th of J annary, wheu, having completed his observations and compiled his notes, he returned to the office. .A short time after he furnished a full report npon the subjects of his mission, which I communicated to the W'ar Department. It may not be out of place to refer here to some of the more general inductions which this report contains. The long, narrow strip of sound which separates Pamplico sound from the ocean is spoken of as "a ridge made by the waves of the sea, which have <lisintcgrntcd the borders of shallow flats and gradually elevated or he,aped up that portion of the material which could not be dissolved or carried off hy currents." "The waves upon a beach are obt1crvcd to make a selection among the earths with which they come in contact. The vegetable mould and light soils are washed out aud borne away in the recoil of the eea and by littoral currents, while the gravel and coarse sands are left rolled up ill ridges, near the higl1est reach of the rollers." Examinations about Hatteras inlet seemed to show that at the depth of fifteen to eighteen feet below the low water p1ane the action of waves is not traceable, and that here the antecedent soil of tlte country may be found. The report is very full upon the causes of inlets, aud shows how dependent the depths of these avenues are upon the amount of outflow and the angle at wkich thitl ou~jlow encounters tke waiиes ef the sea. The tides and currents were carefully studied. "In small harbors and bays upon our cumit the epochs of the tides and currente are coincident: that is, slack current occurs at the stand of the tide, at liigh water a.nd at low water. But where the tide wave enters a narrow inlet, connecting with a great inland basin, the r.aae is different. The ba1<in, being nearly tideless, has its surface lying at about the mean level of the scathat is at the half-tide plane-and it is upon t11is p1auc that the currents of the inlet must t~ike the initiative. Flond currents can only commence to ruu in at the inlet when the surface of the ocean has ri1mu above tliat of the basin; and ebb current must commence when the swиface of the former falls below that of the latter. Moreover, the maximum velocities must occur when the greatest contrasts of heights between the ocean and sound obtain; that is at kigh -water for the flood and at low -wate-r for the ebh. At Hatteras inlet the conditions de11cribed a.re in a great degree realized, although it would appear that the laud waters wl1ich have accumulated in Pamplico l!ound have raised its surface a-0mewhat above the half tide plami of the ocean, so that the flood current does not commence until three and a half hours after 1ow water, and gives place to the outflow in less than thre.i hours after high water. "It is a well known paradox of Hatteras harbor that if a tight ves1el gror.nds on tlie Bulkhead at high

water, during the strengtl1 of the.flood curn-nt, she will 'cut off,' at low water, during the strengtlt eftlte ebb drifl." An opportunity was offered Mr. 1\litchell to l'XRmine into the character of quic'ksands of various kinds. He attributes the formation of the deeper cla~s of quick~and:< to the "drifting of fine silicious dust into lagoons and slues during the prevalence of dry winds." The slues, which have been occasioned by violent storms, soon become hOJ"dered by dangerous quicbands as the wind-drifts encroach upon them. "Sloughs are somfltil)l!'S caused by the escape of gases from the sands on tl1e rise of the tide." Among the diagrams accompanying this report there is one showing the variations of density and temperature of the water which occur at different stages of the tide. It was observed that dming tlte ebb or и, outflowing current the water was continually fre~l1euing and falling in temperature, the least density and lowei:;t temperature being recorded on tbe slack of the ri~ing tide. Ou the other hand, the waters of the flood cunent came in warmer and demier, reaching their maxima on the Flack of the falling tide. 'l'his wann water was evidently from the Gulf Stream. "I observed," says the report, "that the state of the atmo~phere was much affected, especially at spriug tides, by the currents ; that it was sensibly more humid and mild during tlrn -i'l!fluw than during the ou~flow. .A. thermometer hanging on the outside of my quarters indicated the chanf{es of the currents at the inlf,t. The report contain~ epecifications for building dikPR and caueeways, and some of the plans are new. In a locality like Hatteras, where mnterial is limited both in quantity and varidy, original methods of construction must be resorted to. Instead of using baskets of stones to protect the exterior slope of a dike, as in Holland, it is proposed to place a large number of cedar trees iuclined against the fore shore slope, their butts to be loaded with pig iron, aud to lie six or eight feet apart in a trench. These trees are to be conи nect!иd by two parallel rows of chains, the lower chain sccuriag the trunks, and the upper passing among the branches; tlrns a continuous matting may Le formed wbich cannot be torn asunder by the breakers, bnt on the contrary may cause the sands to collect in pmmanent masses. Emry facility was offered Mr. Mitchell by the commander of Hatteras, the late :Brigadier General Thomas \Villiamil, and in a letter from the latter, dated February 4, the return of my assistant is solicited with flattering comments. El9drngrapliic retmrney ef Beaufort harbor, N. C.-Tbe chart of Beaufort harbor wal! published in 1857, but, like all other harbors on tl1e South Atlantic coast, its bar aud channels are known to be subject to changes of very serious consequence to navigation, if not from time to time pointed out. The capture of Beaufort and the reduction of Fort Macon by Major General Burnside, having restored the ha1bor to the poBse8sion of the govermncnt, a resurvey was ordered in May, so that the port might be made as available as the capacity of the channel:s would allow for the purposes of the Navy Department. The duty of making the examination and sounding& was intrusted to Mr. Albert Bo.,cLke, and the schooner Joseph Henry was assigned for the use of his party. 'The vessel reached Beaufort on the 28th of May. Hy natural or aitificial changes mo~t of the triangulation marks had been lost, and it was found necessary to determine thirteen stations anew. Nine of these required the erection of forge bi.pods for observing with the tl1eodolite. Mr. Boschke occupied eleven of the stations and observed eleven hundred and eighty angles. Mr. :E. H. Courtenay servHd as recorder, and the work was drawn by Mr. Charles Heyne as the observations were completed at the several stations: The triangulation was completed on the 13th of June and the soundings commenced next day. For this last duty assistance was furnished by the commander of the United States gunboat Daylight. 'l'he changes in outline noticed at Beaufort entrance made it necessary to resurvey ten miles of the shore, whicl1 was done in the usual way, with the plane-table. The nature of the changes will be again nlferred to. A summary given in the report of Mr. Bosehke contains the following as statistics of the hydrography:

Seven current stations were occupied, each during one full ebb and flood. A tide staff was set up at the government wharf, }~ort Macon Point, from which the tides between the 8th of June and the 26th of July were recorded hy Mr. 'l'homas Thompson. As the hydrography advanced the plotting of the chart wal! pushed or, the sailing lines were drawn, and new positions assigned for buoys, so as to conform to the actual alterations in the proper courses. The

United States quartermaster at Beaufort furnished a steam-tug, and the engineer of the Daylight procured the temporary moori11gs for the buoys. The buoys belonging to the port were found in tl1e city, where tl1cy had been deposited by t11e parties who removed them at the outset of the war. '.l'he following remarks on the changes whicl1 have taken placeи in Beaufort harbor are extracted from the report of }Ir. Boschke : " Considerable changes have occurred on the sliores of Bogue and Shackleford banks. '.l'he west end of Shackleford bank has made out three hundred and sixty yards; and from Bogue bank, at Fort 3facon Point, sixty yards have washed away. 'l'o the westward of .Fort Macon Point, on the St>aside, and to the eastward of Shackleford Point, the shores have grown from one hundred to one hundred and fifty yards seaward. "The present channel and bar are about a third of a mile further west than they "\\'ere in 1857. The depth on the bar at mean low water has slightly improved. The former channel is obstructed and now gives only seven feet at low water, or no more than the we!'tern slue. "The southwest breakers have changed considerably, there being now a shoal bare at low water in their plnce. A epot is also bare at low tide on the l\liddle Ground, and both shoal,; are at present increasing in size. The channels and ehoals of the inner l1arbor have not materially changed." The results of the examination made by l\fr. Boschke render it probable hat the bar of l3eaufort entr:mce will continue to move westward for some time in the direction of the main ship channel, and that the depth of water on it may further improve. From a reduction furnished by Mr. Boschke, a new preliminary chart of Beaufort harbor was lithogra1ihed at the office in August and digtributed for the use of the navy and of the a1иmy transports. 'I'he sc.:hooner Joseph Henry returned nmth at the end of ,July, rPaching Boston ou tlie 12th of Augustи She was at once assigned for use to the party of Assistant Harri~on, in Section I. The records of observations, the duplicates, and the original chart of the resurvey of Beaufort harbor, are now at the office in Washington. SECTION V.

Additions liave been maile to the progress skett-h of the section. The following preliminary charts have been drawn and lithographed for immediate use,. viz : sea-coast of South Carolina; sea-coast of Georgia ancl Florida to St. Augustine; Port Royal entrance, with Beaufort, Broad. and Cheehcssec riverE; Caliboguc sound ancl Skull creek; W assaw bar; St. Helena sound; the addition of James' island and Stono river to the chart of Charledton harbor; and a chart of Stono inlet, with parts of Stouo, Folly, and Kiawah rivers, from tl1e survey of the present year. Coast Sunиey operations on -the roast f![ i">outl; Carolina, Georgia, and part ef Florida.-As stated in my last annual report, the party of As:'liRtant C. 0. Hnutel!f~, at the end of the year 186L, was in active service with the naval and military expeditions which moved in several direction:> from the naval station in Port Royal sound, S. C. Two surveying steamers for a short period, but ultimately only one, (the Bibb being seut to replace the Vixen wl1en disabled,) and two schooners, the Arago and the Caswell, were assigned to the charge of llir. Boutelle. Several of the most active sub-assistants and aids ha<l been attached to his party, their selection being made so as to inrnre the most thorough efficiency. Under the mders of Commodore (now Admiral) DuPont, the first duty performed by the party was the temporary buoyage of the south channel into Port Royal 1muucl, and pilotiug the fleet and army transports over the bar, as stated in my previous report. After the successful naval attack of the 7th of November, by Admiral DuPont, which restored the waters of l'ort Royal sound to the possession of the government, the several members ()f the party were occupied in local surv<'ys until tl1e 24th of that month, or a little beyond the close of the surveying year, at which time my annual n~port. is made up. In noticing the fnrtber operations of the party of A&sistant Boutelle reference will be made to the localiи ties in geogra11hical order, in accordance with the plan nf previous reports, though tl1is will, in some cases, invert tl1e order of dates at "-hich-the work was executed. '!'he parties proceeded from Port Royal as a centre, and worked north and south of it, but I will notice first the most northern locality of operations, and proceerl with the others in the nsual order, going southward. The surveyors were repeatedly under the fire of the enemy, either while co-operating with the naval or military forces by reconnaissance, or when employed in usual fielcl-duty in this t<ection. Rattlesnake 11/wal.-It having come to the knowledge of the flag-officer that most of the vessels which ran the blockade of Charleston had taken the advantage of local knowledge to cross the Rattlesnake shoalи Mr. Boutelle was directed to examine it, and to place buoys so that the movements of our blockading ve:Mels might be free from danger. This was promptly done, the buoys being set on the 10th and 11th of May. The steamer Ribb was used in runninf!," the necessary lines of 8om1di11gs, and the buoy vessel, which was then serving as her tender, in placing the buoyil. Two first-class buoys were fixed in position, one at each end of the shoal. The result of the examination was made known to the squadron, and that, with the marks which had been set, had much effect in checking the evasions of the blockade that had become quite frequent in thut quater. Triangulation, topogra71hy, and hydrograph.1J ef Sjono entrance and bar, and if Stono, Folly, and Kiawali rivers, S. C.-On the 18th of May Mr. Boutelle received orders to transfer his party to Stono inlet, to exllIDine the bar, to buoy tlrn channel, and, if practicable, to pilot in the gunboats which had been sent there as the preliminary to an attack on the fortifications of that vicinity. On the morning of the 19th the Stano bar was examined, and a channel found giving seven feet at low water. 'l'his was temporarily buoyed by the party at once, and permanently marked on the following morning. Assistant Boutelle, aided by Mr. J. S. Bradford, piloted in the gunboats Unadilla, Ottawa, and Pembina. The reconnaissance was extended up the Stono, above Legareville, to a fortification known llil " Old :Battery," on James' island. When the gunboats were anchored for the night Mr. Boutelle and Mr. Bradford returned to the bar, the steamer Bibb, owing to her draught, being as yet obliged to anchor outside. Some days were occupied in sounding the lower part of the Stouo in the vicinity of Bird key, and the remaiuing part of May and the month of June in hydrographic duty,- and in the preliminary work requisite for it. In that interval As~iHant Boutelle made two slrnrt visits to Port Royal on public j!ervice. At Stono he was rejoinedи by Bub-.Assil:'tant W. S. Edwards, in the sunиeying schooner Arago, and by Mr. Cleveland Rockwell, these parties having completed extensive surveys for military purposes noo,r Port Roy:il. Mrи

Edwards rendered able assistance in the survey of the rivers connected with Stono inlet, and Mr. Rockwell by tracing the shore-line of the adjacent i:3lands. The resurvey of Stono bar and inlet revealed great changes which had occurred in the direction of the channel. and in the depth of water. All of the hydrography was, of necessity, done in boats, though the heat of the weather was extreme. The Stono, Folly, and Kiawah rivers were sounded. Mr. Edwards, taking the upper part of the Stono, extended the soundiags to Newtown Cut, above wh:ch his progress was stopped by a i;trong rebel battery. By the untiring industry of 1\lr. Hockwell the shore-line survey of Coles, Folly, Kiawah, and .James's islands, and that of Bird Key, was ready for the use of the hydrographic party when called for. The triangulation of this part of the coast of South Carolina was executed in 1855. Some of the stations then used being necessary for the topography and hydrography, thP duty of re;;toring thP signals, a work attended with danger, was assigned to J\fr. C. H. Boyd. This was done in armed boats, and in one instance, (Big Sandy Pt. station,) it was necc!"sary to have aid from one of the gunboats Etationed in the river. Captain J. B. Creighton, of the Ottawa, kindly sent his first cutter, in charge of 1\1aster R. K. Duer, to accompany the cutter of the Bibb, which was in charge of Mr. Brndfonl. No reconnui~sance had been made previouRly. Jtir. Bradford reset the Rignal, and his party returned in the afternoon. Other signals were in like manner set up, and the positions of the buoys and hydrogra1lhic points were determined from them. The position of Fort Pemberton, a rebel intrenchmcnt on "'appoo creek, and of' other batteries, and of lookout stations erected by the enemy in the neighborhood of " SecessionYille," was determined in the same way. The exact distance from them to given points, being in each case deduced and stated, proved of great advantage tfl the gunboats in ranging their guns. и It is proper to remark that during the stay of the Coast Survey party at Stono the bufly vessel was in service as the tender of the steamer Bibb, and, in charge of members of the party of 1\Ir. Boutelle, she piloterl in from time to time from the outer bar buoy the gunboats and transports as they were assigned to service in the river. Mr. Boutelle was for the most part personally engaged, under Commander Drayton, senior naval officer at Stono, in reconnaissance, for which hiB intimate local knowledge fitted him. He accompanied and piloted the expedition up Folly island river, as also the reconnaissance of .Fort Pemberton, made with the gunboat Ellen, and another, made with the steamer Bibb, up the Kin,wah river. The Coast Survey party lt'ft Stouo inlet on the 23d of Jnne, the Bibb being then much out of repair, and the time of most of her crew having expired. She had been in service witlt the party afloat dnring six: consecutive months. On the 1st of July she left Charleston bar, having pasi<<>d the intervening week at Port Royal, and, after touching on her way north at }'ortress 1\1ouroe, returned to New York. The Caswell reached New York on the 12th of that month, and the Arago on the d,ty following. Among the incidents while theи party was at work in the vicinity of Stono inlet wиas the capture of six: out of a company of outlying rebel pickets belonging to the twenty-fifth иSouth Carolina r<>gimcnt, one of whom was about to fire on Mr. Boyd when he was taken. This was effected by Messrs. Boyd and Bradford, who had landed from their boats with four men opposite to Legareville, to examine the we8tern side of James's island. The prisoners were brought in by the party and delivered to Captain Godon, who ww, at that time (May 21) the senior naval officer at Stono. Nortlt Edisto entrance, S. C.-A partial examination of this harbor was made in December, 1861, with -tl1e steamer Vixen, when Aesistant Boutelle pilotedиinto the river the naval expedition under Captain Percival Drciyton, U. S. N. No attempt was then made to buoy tl1e channel, nor until the 11th of the following .l<'ebruary, after General Sherman had decided to occupy Edisto and the adjacent i8lands. At that date, and under the orders of Commodore DuPont, Mr. Boutelle, with the RteamPr Bibb, convoyed the army transport Ben Deford, with the forty-se,иeuth rt>giment New York volunteers, and, in company with the gunboat Crusader, protected the troops for somi;. time after their landing on Edisto island from night attack, tlw enemy being then in force only a few miles from Rockville. Daylight was employed by the party in sounding the bar, and the boats of the Bibb returned each night to the vicinity of "Point of Pines Honse" to guard the approaches to the military station. The l1ydrogrnphic work was made very difficult by stormy weather, but the labors of the party were succe1<p,fn]. A new channel was found to the southward of the old one, aud with more water. 'l.'be bar was thorougbly s;mnded, and temporary buoyA were laid, from thP boat~. и Commodo~e DuPont requfring the services of the party in Port Royal BOtmd, the ~tenm<иии Hibli left North Edisto on the 23d of February, and did not return until near the ernl of .April. ln the last "-eek of that month both channels were permanently buoyed, and a foиst-class buoy was placed at the point where the cs 7

channels meet; the sailing lines were plotted; and the sailing directions were drawn out and communicated to the flag-officer. '!'he triangulation work done at N01th Edisto was auxiliary to tho hydrography, and wns execntи~d hy Mr. Boyd. Rome of the uhl poi11t8 were restored, and those, as well as the hydrogrnphic signals and the new buoys, were determined in position. The survey wa~ completed hy the end of ApTil, and on the 1st of May the vessel returned to Port Royal. During both of her visits to North Edisto the Bibb had been constantly employed in the protection of the shores, and in service incidental to the objects of the military and naval expedition. St. Helena aqund, S. C.-Assistant Boutelle's party went with the naval expedition which vi~it<иd St. Helena sound on the 24th of November, and at that time made a preliminary examination of the bar and plact'd some temporary buoys. As the different vessels of the squadron passed to the bar, they were piloted by members of the Coast Survey party. Drawings and plaus of the rebel works were also furnished, the intrenchments there being strong and elaborate. JHr. Bontelle's local knowledge was again made effective, and under his direction the sloop-ot~war Dale was piloted through Parrot creek to her a11c110rage off Otter island. Soundings were made through the tortuous channels of Morgan river and the creek just mentioned, a sen-ice rendered hazardous by the narrowness of the streams, as the pilotage was made difficult by tlw fact that the Dale drew fourteen feet of water. After dosing this preliminary seivice the party left for another station, and did not return to St. Helena until the 5th of April, for the survey of the bar and entrance. Commodore DuPont having special duty for tbe steamer Bibb, Mr. Boutelle, with one of her officers, went to work with the buoy tender, partially sounded the channels, placed large iron buoys in one, determined their position, and took measures for restoring the triangulation pointR. On the 19th the Bil1h, 11aving been relieved, returned with the party, and by the 23tl the bar and channeh; \\'Cre thoroughly sounded and buoyed. Port Royal sound, Beavfort anrl Rroad riner,Y, Slcull creek, ~., S. C.-As already stated in the beginning of this chapter, the party of Mr. Boutelle was employed in local surveys in the vicinity of Port Royal between the 7th and tl1e 24111 of NovemlJf~r, 1861, and had in use the steamer Vixen and the schooner Arago. During that interval obt<truetions in Port Hoyal harbor were buoyed ; a hydrographie survey cf Skull creek was commenced ; and some of the party were occupied in restoring the triangulation points, in setting up Rignals, and in observing with the theodolite, so as to give data for extending the shore-line survey beyond the limits of the publi~hed chitrts. Sub-Assistant IY. II. Dennis and Mr. Cleveland RockweU arrived on the 1st of December in the steamer Bienville, and at once reported for duty. l\Ir. Hackwell was directed to take up for military purposes the topography of the inside shore of Port Hoyal island, and that of the adjacent inside islands. This service he steadily prosecuterl, under the orders of Brigadier General I. I. Stevens, to tlrn extent rr'quirerl inland, and his zeal and activity were warmly commended in a communication addressed to me by that commander. Mr. C. L. Bixby airled in thi~ plane-table work. 'l'o Sub-Assist.:mt Dennis was at tlie same time assigned the topographical ~urvey of t11e shores of Broad and Beaufort riven' and that of Arcl1er's creek, and the outside shore-line of Port lloyal island. 'l'he work was commenced immediately, an.I will be again referred to in the course of this notice. Sub-Assistant 'vY. S. Edwards reported for duty on the 21st of December, and with him returned Mr. Bradford, of the party in the Vixen, who had been sent from Port Royal with official despatches after the naval attack of the preceding month. l\fr. Edward8 at once took charge of the schooner Arago, and hegan the sounding of Skull creek. He was aided lty l\fr. W. W. Harding. Mr. Bradford returned to his former position on board of the Vixen. 'l'he party in the steamer proceeded on the 22d to tbe important lahor of surveying and permanently buoying the south and southeast channels into Port Royal sound, and by the end of December ten first-class iron buoys had been fixed in position in both passages. A change in the direction of the channels was ohserved, and an increased depth. In the south channel was found nineteen and a half' feet of water, and in the southeast channel twenty-one feet. 'l'he hydrogrsphy of Skull creek was finished by Mr. Edwards on the 3d of January, and t11at of Broad river at once taken up. .About a week afterwards the light-vessel for Port Royal which had been sent out и by the Light-House Board waa taken to her station and safely moored in the position indieated by Mr. Boutelle. Sailing directions for Port Royal sound were t11en made out, and, after being approved by the flag-officer, were published for the use of the navy and of the army transports. The arrival of the steamer Bibb on the 12th of January relieved the Vixen, which had become unfit for service. By an arrangement with the chief quartermaster, Captain Rufus Saxton, U. S. A., the disabled

vessd was shortly after taken in tow by the steamer Baltic as far north as Cape Henry, and thence made her way unaidPd to X PW York. и During the month of Janm1ry the fi<иld-work and l1ydrograp}1~и "'ere vigorouBly carried on. The Bibh wits elsewlwre cm11loy(;d. l\le~srs. Denni~ and Rockwell were sm-v<иying the shore8 of Broad river and Port Royal islancl. By the end of February the hJdrography of Broad river was extended up a~ far as Hogg's Neck, but it waR found impracticable to continue soundings throug11 1Vbalc llranch to Port Uoyal ferry, as had been intended when the work waR taken up. As already mentioned, the Bibb had been some time on :"ervice at Korth Edi8to. She was detained after her return to Port Royal to act as :m armed vesi<el in <?oncert with the Varmm, the greater part-of the flpet having gone southwatиd to repossess certain point~ on the <?oast of Florida. l\Ir. Boutelle was alFo directed to sound and buoy an anchorage proper for the United States shi1i-of-thc-line Vermont, then daily expected at l'ort Royal. His party executed that duty early in March. On the 2d of March tlie steam transport Mi:-<sissippi, having on board Major General 1fatlr~r and fourteen hundred soldiers, destined for the coast of Louisiana, reacl1ed Port Royal in distress, the vessel ha~иing _struck on the Frying Pan shoals. She was then kaking badly. Commander Boggs, senior naval officer ut Port Royal, assigued the charge ~f the repairs fo the iia1иty in. the Bibb, and, by the unremitting labors of Sailingmaster Platt and Chief Engineer French, the transport in the course of' a week was declared seaworthy. At the request of General Butler Mr. lloutellc detached Sailing-master A. 0. :\Iitchell from the Arago, with direction to proceed with the expedition to the Gulf of Mexico, his local kuowieclge of its northern coast being extensiYe and accurate. Commodore DuPont detailed the steamer Bibb on the 5th of April to make special vi~iti' at the naval stations between Port Royal arid :Mosquito inlet. Assistant Boutelle beiug then engaged at St. Helena sound, the vessel went in charge of Mr. Platt, and returned on the 11th. The flag-officer came on board, vi8ited .Fort ]~ulaski, which bad just surrendered, and then proceeded in her to Port Royal, where she was returned to tlw charge of Mr. Hontellc on the J 8th. The Enited States frigate Savannah having in the absence.ff the pa.rty strnck on a shoal point near t11c southeast channel, a spar buoy was set to mark the position. This was done after the return of tl1e party from the survey of North Edisto. Mr. H. W. Longfellow, one of the aids in the party of Mr. Boutelle, was detached on the 10th of l\Iay and Teturned to the north, in coni'c>quence of mness. The hydrography of Beaufort river, Archer's creek, J erid10 creek, and Cowan creek was reported by Sub-Assistant Edwards complete on the 23d of May. Mr. Rockwell at the same date had completed the topography between the shores of tl1e Beaufort and Ooosaw rivers, and was then under orders to report at Stono inlet. Mr. Dennis finished the shore-line survey of Beaufort river and of Archer's and Cowan creeks near the end of May. He returned to tho north soon after and engaged in other plane.table duty, as I have stated under the head of Section I. Tybee roads, Calibogue sound, and Savanna/; rfrer, S. C. and Ga.-In accordance with orders from Flag-Officer DuPont, the surveying party proceeded about the middle of January to examine and buoy the cliannels into Tybee roads and Calibogue sound, and notwithstanding the extremely stormy Wdather at that period, the entrance of the Savannah (Tybee bar) wa8 marked with iron buoys, and the sound with spar buoys, by the end of the same month. Other duty, which has been mentioned under several preceding heads, was performed in the succeeding three months. On the 1st of May, Mr. Boutelle made a careful examination of the lower part of the Savannah river between Fort Pulaski and Square Beacon. 'l'hrec large hulks had been sunk there by the enemy, and it was found that they had deepened the channel by as much as nearly six feet. It was, moreover, found that the obstructions could be easily removed. Sub-Assistant Edwards Lad taken up the hydrography of Ualibogue sound on the 8th of March. Ht~ completed that work by the 23d, and then returned to Beaufort river. One of the buoys set at the entrance of Calihogue sound having been carried away by the colli~ion of a vessel, the working party placed larger buoys in May, and slightly changed the sailing lines, so as to give the best water across the bulkhead. 'l'he facts ascertained in regard to the channel into Savannah river were promptly communicated to the llag-ofiicer. Sailing directions to accord with the changes observed were reported without delay. Wasaa'W tJOund, Ga.-Immediately after cloeing his first examination of Tybee e11trauce and Calibogue sound, .Assistant Boutelle sou.nded and buoyed the Wa.ssaw bar, and the channel leading into 'Vassaw sound. This work he finished on the 8th of February, and on the next day furnished sailing directions for the sonnd

in a report to the flag-officer. He also forwarded a preliminary chart of W assaw sound to the office in Washington, copies of which were at once made by lithograph, and distributed from the Naval Observatory for the South Atlantic squadron. The survey of W assaw entrance, as mentioned in my report of last year, was provided for by instructions issued for the surveying season of 1860-'61. 'l'he instructions were not then carried out, for reasons given in the same report. St. Simon's bar and sound, Ga.-The surveying party reached St. Simon's entrance on the 23d of Marcl1, and at once proceeded to set buoys in place. The examination made then showed that the bar bad decreasefl in depth since the Htrvey of 1857, the ehart of that year showing seventeen feet. Mr. Boutelle found only fifteen feet on the bar at low water. The light-house at i::lt. Simon's having been destroyed by the rebels, the party set a laTge signal on the ruins, :md maiиkcd it as a conspicuous object for the use of vessels of the squadron, as a range, when they might have need to run into the sound. This survey was finished on the 27th of March. Sailing lines proper for entering were at once reported to the flag-officer. Fernandina bar and Cumberland sound, Fla.-On the 13th of Marchи the surveying steamer Bibb arrived at :B'ernanclina, and at once commenced the examination of the bar. 'rhe fact was soon established that the clepth of water had changed for the worse, and also that the bar had shifted to the southward. Only twelve feet depth was found on it at low water. The channel was buoyed by the party with the old buoys, which had been removed and hidden by the enemy. Mr. Boutelle, on the occasion of a vi8it of General Sherman, whom he accompanied to ,Tackwnville, found thirteen buoys and a lot of mooring chain which had been provided by the Light-house Board. The property was brought away and put to its pro11er use on other parts of the coast of this section. In all of the nine haiиbors examined this year by Assistant Boutelle, the triangulation done was merely auxiliary to the plane-table surveys and hydrography, and was effected by restoring the station points which had been u~ed in the regular progress of ~11' Coast Survey. иwithout such data the buoys set in position, fifty-four in all, could not have been properly marked on the charts. I give, in conclusion, a summary of statistics from the field-books of the topographical parties, and from the jonrnals of the hydrographic parties :

It has been stated already, in the notice of work done at Stono inlet, that the steamer Bibb and schooners Arago and Caswell returned to New York iu July. The party in these three vesseltl had.been nine months uninterruptedly employed in their several spheres of duty. SECTION VI.
FROM ST. MARY'S RIVER TO ST..JOSEPH'S BAY, (SOUTH,) INCLUDING THE EASTERN AND PART OF THE WESTERN COAST OF FLORIDA, WITH THE REEFS AND KEYS.-(SKEICH F, No. 32.

The only party available for continuing t11e survey of this section was prepared to co-operate by reconnaissancee., or hydrographic duty, in any military or naval service which might be deemed expedient by the commanders of the department of Florida. None of the harbors of the peninaula below St. A11gustine and Cedar Keys having been occupied by the forces of the government during the working season, the pllrty took up and continued the hydrography of the Florida reef This important work will be completed by a party which is now preparing to return to the seetion.

THE UNITED STATES COASTи SFRVEY.

'l'he magnetic observations liave been continued at Key 'VY est. 0FFICE-WORK.-The drawing and engraving of tlw chart of St. Augustine harbor, and the engraving of St. Mary's river aud Fernandina harbor, have been completed. Progref:s has Leen made in the drawing and engraving of general coast chart No. X, Floridn reef, from Key Bi:scayue to Marquesas keys, and coast chart No. 71, Newfound-harbor key to Boca Grande; the engraving of coast chart Ko. 70, Garden ](i:':f to Lower Matacumbe, has been commenced; and the annual additions to the progress sketches of the section have been made. A preliminary chart of the vicinity of the Tortngas, Fla., bas been lithographed. Hydrograp!ty r:f tlte Florida Reef-Being advised by General Brannan that in the spring of the i1resent year such arrangements would be in progress in his department as might render it desirable that Coast Survey parties should be detailed for work on the coast of l<'lorida, instructions were issued in April, in accordance with which Assistant George DaYidson organized a party in the surveying steamer Yixen and schooner James Hall. As in other cases, on the coast below Cape Henlopen, he was directed to co-operate, a~ far as possible, with any military operations that might be devised. To that end the Vixen was furnished '11'ith two Parrott guns, and was well iirovided with otlwr means for makiug or resisting attack. Some delay occurred in fittiqg out the Vixen, the call, at that time, for iron-elad gunboats having pre-engHged all the suitable mechanics. The vessel did not reach Key \Vest until the 14th of .l\Iay, having touched at Port Royal to deliver despatches from the blockading s'piadron off Charle8ton and to take in coal. Admiral l>ul'nnt, at Port Royal, promptly ordered imch facilities as furthered the wishcB of Assistant lJ11vidson to he at }1i8 de.~ tination. Upon consulting with General Brannan, at Key \Vest, it was found that operation8 by the laud forces were not contemplated. The bays on the western coast of Florida, moreover, were all in possession of the enemy, so that the unfinished work could not be profitably taken up. In accordance with the discretionary instructions which hatl been given, Assistant Daviuson transferred his. party to the Florida reef, ou which a stretch of twenty-five miles remained to be sounued iu order to comи plete the chart. The parties of Assistant G. A. Fairfield and Sub-Assistant C. 'l'. Iardella being under his gene1иal direction were likewise moved to that locality in the schooner James Hall, and signals wenи erected for tbe prosecution of the outRidt~ hydrogr,.phy. The weather provca unfaYorahle, being marked by excessive rains and heavy squalls.

A tidal station was occupied. on Indian Key, at which nearly a thousand observations were recorded in the space of. twenty-six days. The zero of the tide-staff was referred to the bench-mark previously used, aud which was more distiuctly marked by ~Ir. Davidson. He also reported on the condition of the lettered beaи cons on the .Florida reef~ some of which had been displaced. In the interest of navigation, tl1e following remark occurs in his report: " A.s seen from seaward, Indian Key is so well anrl so peculiarly marked hy the houses and cocoa trees that a sketch of it was taken from the erlge of the Gulf Stream, on the line of best water for crossing the reef to the anchorage in soft b-ottom about six hundred yards off the key, and also to give .Alligator reef on the starboard hand a good berth." This sketch will be engraved for the finished chart of the Florida reef. Sub-.Assistant C. Fendall was attached to the party of .Assistant Davidson. Messrs. A. T. Mosman, L. L. Nicholson, and A. R. Fauntleroy served as aids. Assistant Fairfield and Sub-Assii;t.иtnt Iardella 11eartily co-operated in prosecuting the hydrography. During a heavy blow on the 4th of June the schooner Hall dragged her anchors and was driven ou the coral rocks of Indian K(y. After three days of severe labor she was hauled off by tlie steamer Vixen. Assistant Davidson acknowledges the valuable assistance of .Acting Master Wm. Richardson, U. S. N., in his etforts to get the vessel off.

REPORT OJ<' THE SL'PERINTENDENT OF

Late in June-the two ve8sels repaired to Key West, where the needful facilities for coaling and watering hacl been on different oeeasious suppliecl by General Brannan. The season for active operations in this section being past, both partic:s returned to X ew York. Assistant Daviclsou reported to me personally at Washington, and then took up the reduction of the season's work. The other members of the parties have, since the middle of July, been employed at various localities in Sections I and II. The steamer Vixen, with her armament, was transferred to the Navy Department on the 12th of July. At the end of October she was returned to the Coast Survey, and is now fitting out for the completion of the hydrogmpl1y outside of the Florida reef. JJiagnetic Observations.-Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns remained in charge of tl1e magnetic instruments ' at Key '.Vest until near the end of March of the present year, when he was detailed for duty near the month;; of the Mississippi, of which notice will he taken in a succeeding chapter. The regular photograpLic and differential observation8 were continued by Sub-Assi8t,wt F. F. Nes, itided by Mr. G. I<'. Ferguson, until l\fay, when Mr. Samuel '\Valker was left in charge, and Sub-Assi,tant Nes assigned to duty in Section II. In May of the present year magnetometer No. 6 was sent to replace the instrument which was stolen from the temporary obscrvato1-y at Key \Vest in the midst of the public troubles, and which has not yet been traced. The nиc.,.rU8 from Key '\VeRt have lrnen regularly rnceived from Mr. Walker since April. Tidal Ohsernations.-The series of observations which had been conducted at 1''ort Clinch was stopped soon after the breaking out of the present war, as stated in my last annual report. After the port of Fernandina had been regained to the authority of the government, steps were taken for the recovery of the self-registering tide-gauge, but so far witl1out success. According to the most direct information yet obtained the instruments were de~troyed at an early date in the war. SECTION VII.
]'ROM ST. JOSEPH'S BAY (NEAR TAMPA) TO MOBILE BAY, INCLUDING PART OF THE WESTERN COAST OF FL<)RIDA, AND THE COA~T Ob' ALABAMA.

Of the most important liarbor in t11is section (Pensacola) the survey is nearly complete, and the chart published several yearn ago is sufficient to n;cct all the present requirements of the naval and transport i<ervice. The work yet needed is chiefly in the upper part of the dependencies of the bay, in localities now held by the enemy. J'.Iy regret that no party was available fm continuing the survey of the western side of the Florida peninsula is lessened by the consideration that none of the unsurvcyed p11.rts have been occupied hy the government forces. For the ports Ti8ited by our hluckaJing ves~cls, the prelimirn1ry charts have sufficed. Those already pnbli~hc;d give the sounJings in Waccasassa bay, in Cedar Keys harbor, Ocilla river entrance, St. 1Iark's harbor, the passes of St. GPorgc's "onnd, ~\palachicola bay and harbor, and St. Andrew's bay. The hydrography most pres<:Jing, and for wbich preparation has been made by preliminary work, is that of St. Joseph's bay at the lower ernl of the section, (near Tamp~i,) and the coast soundings northward from it in the approaches to Bayport, Chassnhowitzka bay, Homosassa bay, Crystal bay, and Wc-thlocco-chee bay. 'l'lrnse include St. Martin's reef. The party last employc<l in St. George's souud, aud which, but for tbe outb1иeak of the rebellion, would have completed hyd1 ography for the full chart by souiuliugs fr.om Royal Blu:lf westward to Apalachicola entrance, has been conBtantly on duty afloat near the seat of war in Virginia and North Carolina. Of other hydrographic work which might be taken np, if means and the requisite parties were available, may be mentioned that to the eastward of, aud between St. George's. sound aml St. Mark's lrn.rbor, and that of St. Joseph's bay near Cape Sau Blas. 'l'he triangulation which was commenced in the working s<'a~on of 1860-'61 for the survey of the latter, and the completed topography of the first named locality, furnish ample preliminaries for the soundings 'l'hc double party which has usually divided its field-work between this section and Section VIII passed the entire season in active service at the delta of the Mississippi, of which further mention will b~ made in the next cl1apter. Besides this and the single hydrographic party alluded to, the only assistant heretofore connected with the section, and who has usually worked on the western coast of Florida in winter and spring, has been employed in Section I. Though all due interest has been shown by the blockading officers to whom the inventories were referred, none of the property of the survey which was forcibly takeu by rebel citizens from the custody of the topographical party while working last year near Bayport, as stated in my report for 1861, has yet .been. recoveredи

'1 he issue of the labors of tlrn p'1rty sent t1l thi8 section sl10ws in a strong ligl1t the smm<luess of the policy which provi<led means for their supply_ The steamer which had been used for the hydrographic work was lost at sea in 1860, and had not been replace I wlwn the war broke out, though I have requested an appropriat:on for the pur11ose. Neither of the few vessels left to us by the emergency of the spring of 186 l, capable of standing a long s:иa voyage, was available for the accommodation of the part_i.". 'l'he difficulty thus presented was overcome by the liberality of the Hon. Secretary of the Navy, to which further allusion will be made in the detailed notice of the work dnne. OFFICE-WORK.-The engraving of coast chart ~o. 93, Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, has been commenceil_ Additions have been made on com<t clrnrt Nn. 92, wcstnn p11rt of Mi;;si;;sippi sonnrl, anrl to tlie progress sketch of the section; aud a hydrograpliic sketch of die southwest" pass of the :Mississippi has b~n lithographed.

Farragut, U. S. N., Sub-Assistsnt R_ E. Halter was detailed as topographical assistant to accompany him in the ffog-Ehip Hartford. SubsC'qucntly a complete topographical and hydrographical party was organized to accompany the western gulf blockading squa<lron of Admiral Farragut, and to be especially attached to the mortar fleet of Commodore (now Rear Admiral) David n. Porter, U_ S. N_ .Assistant F_ H. Gerdes was placed in charge of this party, his personal knowledge of the Gulf coast, its harbors, inlete, and anchorages being extensive and precise, from a service of many years in this quarter. Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns and .Mr. T. C. Bowie were attached to this party, and some time after Sub.Assistant Halter also joined it. Mr. Oltmanns and "Mr. Halter had both 13erved for several years with )fr. Gerdes on the Gu1f coast_ In a ready spirit of co-01}eration in the government serviC, the Commissioner of the Northwestern Boundary Survey, Archibald Campbell, esq., placed at my disposal for the i:mme duty, the services of Mr. Joseph S. Harris, who l1ad previously bet>n 1-1ttached to a Coast Survey party in this section, and who was also well acquainted with the localities in which the equadron was to operate_ His intelligence and characteristic energy fully met tlie expectations which 1 had formed in organizing the party. и Sub Assistant Halter preceded the othe1и members assigned to this section, having in accordance with my instnv=tions reported to Uommodore Farragut on the 17th of January at Philadelphia. He reached Ship island in the flag-ship Hartford, and, under the orders of the commodore, a few days after took up the 1>ound_ iug and buoying of the channel of the southwest pass of the Mississippi. l!'or this sen-ice, which was completed on the 11th of March, the schooner Wilner was detailed for liis use, by the flag-officer, with a working crew_ On the 14th Mr_ Halter piloted the sloop-of-war Brooklyn over the bar, and on the 16th took in the flag-ship. Other vessels of tlie squadron intended for the reduction of New Orleans were furnished with sailing directions for entering the Mississippi by the Southwest Pass. At the end of March the party in the Wilder, which was then provided with a twelve-pound gun and a well-armed crew, made a reconna.issance to the rear of Fort St. Philip, the object of the commodore beingto ascertain the depth that could he carried towards Raccoon Point. It was found that the water approach to the fort afforded only seven feet in depth at a distance of rather more than three miles. Sub-ABsistant Halter returned to the head of the passes on the .5th of April, arnl rciransferred the Wilder to the naval 11uthorities. When not employed in surveying or reconnaissance, the schooner bad served as a tender to the larger vessels of the fleet, a.nd in that way had rendered much general service while in cliarge of .Mr. Halter. On the 10th he reported to Al!sistant Gerdes, who had arrived in the Mississippi

a short time bd'ore, hy way of Ship Island, in one of the naval transports. Sub-As:;.istant Oltmanns rpacl1ed the Section in the same vc?sd, from K<>y West, where lie had been employed on otlier duty, to which I have rcfcn-ed under the head of Section VI. Both had rendered assistance in parning vessels of the squadron over the bar of the Southwest P,.ss, as ::Ur. Halt.er had done in the case of the fiag-ship and others . .For the use of the Coast Survey party, when it was organized in }~cbruary, the honorable Secretary of the Navy temporarily transferred to the Treasury Department the steamer Uncas, with a suitable annament. That vcssd left New Ycirk on the 27th of February, in charge of Mr. Han-is, but f'tormy weather on the run to Hampton Roads ~hawed dearly that she could not mnke the passage to tl1e Delta without extensive repair8. With as little delay as possiLle, the steamer Sachem, of the same class, was there substituted by the Navy Dt>partmcnt, and, in charge of Mr. HmTis, after n tedious pa~sage, reached the mouth of the )iississippi on the 10th of April, whPrc shP was joi11crl by Assistm1t (ierr1Ps and the other mcm bcrs of his pnrty. By previous arrangement with the tlag-nfficcr thtиir services were placed at the r1iPposal of Commander D. D1~orter, who was then about rnoYing with the lJornh flotilla of thP sr1uadron to attack Fort Jackson In the season previous to the Lreakiug out of the rebellion, the triaugulation of the Missi;,;8i}ipi delta liad been extended up to the vicinity of the lowc1и dPfenccs of the river. The points then determined, and the computed di~tanroes between tlwm, gave the means for assignilig exact distances from either of the forts, by the aid of ~orne n<l<litioual ob~ervations. l\lr. Gercles took up this wol'k on the 12th. Next day all tl1e members of the party were employe<l in it, and by the morning of the 18th, when the mortar vessels, twenty-one in number, were in po~ition, the exact distance of each of tliem from Fort ,Jackson, and the precise direction, had been made kuown to the officers in charge. Thi,; hazardous and difficult service, the river being at that time over its bank~, was maiuly performed Ly Mr. Harri~ and Sub-Assistant. Oltm;tnns, nirltod by NCr. Bowie. While ml!"asuriug with the theodolite, :Mr. Oltmanns was, in one instance, fired on by riflemen from the bushes on the river Lank, but, though at short range, only the oars of his boat were struck. In nearing the forts, on the last day em11loycd in making observations, the party of l\lr. Harri" came under the fire of the enemy's gunboats, but no casualty occmTed, though the distance was inconeiderable. The bombardment of Fort Jackson opened immediately after the completion of the measurement of distances to tl1e several po!!itions occupied by the mortar vessel~. Fol' the next three days Messrs. Harris and Oltrnann~ remained with the flotilla, and when, from various causes, any of the vessel8 11ad to shift their Lertl1, the di8tancc~ to otl1er positions were computed for them anew. The rest of the pa1иty 1Vcre meanwhile engaged in furni~hing manuscript charts of the Mississippi in tlrn neighborhood of the defences, for the use of the :f:leet, the reg11lar hyilrograpby of the river not having extenclecl, previously, above the passes. At the r('rp1est of Uommodore Porter, the Sachem droppecl down tlrn river on the 22d, to await the return of a detachment which he had sent to reconnoitre in the rear of Fort Jackson. Mr. Oltmanns, having charge of the vessel, then completecl an examination which had been commenced the day before by Mr. Harri~, ~fr. Halte1-, a11d l1imo1clf, of the channels which start neaiи Fort Jackson and connect the Missi~sippi with the Gulf. Next day the Sachem took the wounded men of Commodore :Farragut's fleet to the hospital at Pilot Town. On the 24th of April Assistant Gerdes accompanied Major General Butler into the waters north of Fort St. l'l1ilip, and piloted his boats to the quarantine ground on the east bank of the Mississippi, the intention of the general being to turn the forts, which had not, at that date, surrendered. Sub-Assistant Halter piloted the army tran8ports to the anchorage nearest to the intended landing place, and marked the way fqr boats to pass up into the quarantine bayou. In performing this duty his party necessarily came within range of the guns of Fort St. J>hiJip, but received no injury. Several days after, when the Sachem reached the anchorage of the army transports, soundings to the northward of the fort were begun, to ascertain whether the lightdraught vessels coulcl approach near enough to attack from that side, but the surrender of all the defences of the Mississippi, on the afternoon of the 28th, made it- unnecessary to continue the operations. '.rhe party tl1eref\,re rejoined the flotilla of Commodore Porter in the vicinity of :Fort Jackson. As a matter of interest a map was made, at his request, by }fr. Han-is, to show the condition of the fort at the time of surrender, with marks corresponding in position to the places in which solid shot and shells had struck during the bombardment; the parts burnt, and the portion of the site overflowed by the effect of shot on the levee, that, llntil so damaged, had always kept out the water of the river at itB highest level. A reduction of the drawing here refetTed to appeared in a printed report from the Navy Department to Congress in June last. Sub-ARsistant Halter was detached from th~ party on the 30th of April, and soon after reporting at the office in W ashingtou was a:isigned to field duty in my party in Section I. On the 6th of May the party in the Sachem accompanied the bomb fi(\tilla to Mobile entrance, and on

The purpose being merely a reconnaissance of the defr-nces at the 1иntrance of J\I oLilc hay, the steamer rcttfrned with thP fleet, on the 9th, to the anchorngP at Ship !eland.

'I'hi:; wa""s <lone on the 15th. At a point auout fifteen rni]c8 abonи the mouth, the riYcr being then' so nanow and crooked that the largf'r vesscle could not pa~s the b<иnds, Lieutenant Commantlcl's Rrnsbaw and Baldwin came on hoarrl thi\ SachPm, and that vessel proceeded aloue towards Gainesville, where it was &npposed that a small armed vessel of the enemy was lying.

'The breadth thue and at i<ome 1)lacc~ below wai' barely <>qua! to th<> length of the vessel. Suddenly a voL Icy of musketry was fired on her from the wooded Ehore, and that, though instan1ly returned, '''as followed by n second volley. Suh-Assistant Oltmanns, C'Xecutive officer of the Sachem, being at that moment in an exposed poBition, was severdy wounded by a bullet "Which pierced his rigl1t breast. "\Vit11 this exception, all the officers on board, aud the crew, were uniujured, though 11cnrly twenty sl1ot8 had struck the vessel. 'l'o disperse the enemy the Sachem fired round shot an<l grap(и into the wood~, and wa" not furtl1er molested. "\Vhere this occurred the river was not over :fifty yard~ wide, and the hu~he~ were so thick on Loth banks that the c>nPmy conlrl not hf' seen. Lieutenant Commander Renfha\r deeming it m1arl,иi,.aLlc to proceed further up, the steamer was swung aroind with difficulty and passed down the stream. After receiving surgical treatment, Mr. OltmmmH was ;;~nt to New York. Ile recovered in }Htrr from his hurt, and has since been engaged in field duty in Section III, hut is Ftill Rnffering from tlw efi(иct of the wound. "Mr. Gerdes had meanwhile collected the buoys belonging to the Delta, all of which had been takPn np and see,reted by the insurgents, and had towed them to the Southwest Pass. After making the requisite soundings, six buoys were set in place in the channel. A thorough l1ydrographic 1иcconnaissancc of the bar was made, nnd materials collected for the isime of a chart of the pass. Thi~ work ocl'.npied the 1m1иt_r iu the Sachem until the 7th of June, when the vessel was ordered to accompany the flotilla to Vicksburg. The healtl1 of Mr. Gerdes ha1riug declined, he wa.s obliged to give up the charge of tho party aft.er it had reached New Orleans. Mr. H1Lrri3 again took command of tlie steamer, but at his request Commamlcr Porter detailed Acting .!\laster E.

Mr. Harris started up the l\Iissis~ippi ou tl1e 13th of J nnc, hut nc>ar Baton llougc tl1e rnacl1incry of the propeller was disabled by a snag, and the pnrty returned to New Orleans. The Sachem was there transferred to Commodore Farragut, to be put in order for naval service, which he then had in view west of the Mississippi. The work for which he had been assigned to the western gulf blockading sq m1drou ha\'ing been completed, Assistant Gerdes left New Orleans on the 18th of June aucl re11ortPd at tlw office in \Vashington. llfr.

He is now preparing for duty under the orders of l\lajor General Banks, and is speeially quali:fied for rendering assistance in reconnaissances or special surveys by his local knowletlge of the most important parts of the southwestern coast, over which he has passl'd in prosecuting the shore topography in previous years. ln audition to the active a~Aistancl', tlie expedition has been furnished with copies of the coast memoir relating to Texas, and copies of all the charts which have been issued for the western part of the Gnlf of Mexico. Several effort~ have been made, but thus fii.r wit1iout avail, for the recovery of the schooner Twilight, which, together with the property on boal'd, in April, 1861, was seized by the insurgents at Aramms, and for the property supposed to have been detained at Corpus Christi. 'l'he particulars of these seizures were stated in my last annual report. Inventories of the lost articles have been furnished to officers of the blockading squadron. whose comictions of the usefnlne8s of the survey, and interest for its success, were well known.

In the latter part of April the party commenced the topograpliy of the ~hores of Bodega hay, and furnisl1ed slwre-line for the hydrographic sheet of this season, the particulars of which will beи mentioned presently. The plane-table survey was extended to a point about four miles north of the mouth of Bodt'ga bay, and from that point southward the topography is continuom; to the Golclcn Gatf:. It has througl10ut a breadth of about a mile and a half. Assistant Hodgers was aided by Mr. David Kerr.

Hydrograpliie resur!'ey& in E ..arquines strait, JYiare Islan,d Strait, and '!fl Point TVilson, San Pablo bay, Ca1.-These localities were examined by Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, soon after the great flood of I<'ebruary, l BG2, and the results have been reported on after comparisonи with the soundings made in 185G-'57. In reference to Karquines strait, between Benicia and l\I.artinez, Commander Sands remarks: "The water on the three fath:.m bank, off the ferry wharf at Benici1i, l1as dccpent'd to four fathoms, and we now find four fathoms on the lump off the Pacific Company'R wha..f~ which in 1856-'57 had ouly three fathoms on it, but around the wharf itself the water has shoaled in some places five iwd in others as much as fifteen fePt. On the south side of the strait the six and twelve feet curve~ have made out. considerably from the sliore." "At the conflupnce of Kanp1ineR anr1 l\farn Island straits an jmportant change has taken place. The spit of the shoal which stretches out from the north shore, at tl1e meeting of tlrn straits, has been cut off and shifted to the southward and westward since the survey of 1856. This encroachment has matc1иially narrowed at its entrance the channel which passes up to the navy yard." Commander Sands prom11tly C('mmunicatcd to the light-houge inspector of the di8trict the fact concerning the lessened width of the channel into l\:lare faland strait, and recommended the marking of the f'pit by a buoy. He thus continues, in alluRion to the "liar" or shoal water in San Paulo bay off Point vVilson: и "At the bar, or shoalPst water through Sau Pablo bay, in pasHing towards the navy yaril uhreast nf Point Penole and Point 'Vibon, tl1c depth seems to have changed ~omcwhat. The four fathom cnrve of the rr)SUrv<'y is different from that shown by the sur\'ey of 1Sii6, and the bar has shoaled about a foot. The six feet curve also has made out from a quarter to a half a mile from the eastern shore of the bay, in the bights between the several points which arr' r!'pnиsented on the chart." The finished chart of San Pablo bay, the engraving of which is now nearly completed, will contain the results gfren in the three hydrographic sheet8 forwarded by Commander Sands.

REPORT OF THE ffCPERINTENDENT OF

The party in thP brig Fauntleroy sailed for San Francisco on the 22d of October, and returned to Koos bay alиont tlHи middle of April. During t!H' winter t]1p computations of the season's work were made>, the topograp]1ical ,}]{'et;; were inkicd, and thc~c, witl1 dnplic:1te~ of tlie records of oliscrn1tions, were forwarded to tl1P office. 'l'l1e pnиlimi11ary chart of tl1e entranee of Koo~ bay which accompanied my previous annual report containP the shore-line traced during the working searnn. Hydrogj'apliic rernnnaissancc ef I{oos bay.-Tlrn soundings iu the channel arnl approaches and on the bar of Koos hay, as sho1''11 by the preliminary chart referred to in tlie preceding notice of work, were made in October, ] 8Gl. Su h-A1'sistant Law~on 11sed fill" this s.ervice thf~ steflm-tng :Fearle~R, the sailing veARcl employetl g('Berally hy hi~ party not being suitn.Lkи for the purpose. The work inside of the entrance was done with ouc of tl1e lwati< of the brig Fauntleroy. Tidal observations wern made while tl1c party was engaged in sounding.

The sheet containing the soundings is now at the office, with duplicates of the journals of obserYations. }Ir. :;Ho~man, one of the aids of the party, was detached on the 1st of November, and has been on duty in the Atlantic sections. }Ir. Horace Anderson al~o aide<l .Mr. Lawson at Koos Lay and in the execution of hi~ ofl}cp-work during the winter. In April the party in the Fauntleroy agflin proceeded to Koos bay, and made a reconnaissance of its up11cr i;!tmиet", with a vi('W of com1lleti11g thБи entire hydrography of the bay, if practicablf), in the early part of the searnn. Some of th<: rPqnieite signals were erected, but it was found, as the party advanced, that natural di:ffi("ultie,- there would make it imprncticable to take up work in another locality which was also included in my in~tructions for the searnn. The inside soundings have been for that reason deferred, bnt will bt~ reournccl :tlHl compldt'd at an early date. I-l:1rlrograpliy r:f Gray's liarbor, lV. 1'.-In July the party with the surveying brig Fauntleroy proceeded northward, the i11kntion Lc.:ing to tak<> np :mr1 pro,;ecute to completion the soundings necessary for a chart of Gray'~ ltaiиbor, provi8iou having been made for tliat work Ly the triangulation, and by the topography which wa~ concluded la~t year. Suli-Assistant Lawrnn, after providing what was necessary for the service, took pa~sagp from San :Francisco nud n:joincd hh; Vef\sel at Port vVilliam, in Shoal "Tater bay. Three days Lad b{:Cll s11Pnt by the crew of tlic brig in attPmptiug to pass_into Gray's hnrbor. No one belonging to the Yieinity would con~ent to take the Yessd in, the belief being general that no definite channel existed to leaJ acrns,~ tlw bar. Bdorc ~Ir. Lawson's arrival, l1is aid, Mr. Anderson, had taken up stores and had commenced work with a boat and er<иw. A tidl'-gange wnH set up, and a rcgi~tcr kept of eacl1 high and low water. The signals required l1:ul b.,eu erected. Soundings were commenced immcdiatcly, but frequent interruptions occurred, in conscquetH'c of Lnd weather. Mr. J~awson met hindrances also in tlie currents, which are naturally very stroug in tl1at 1иieinity. Close watch was kept for opportunity to work~ the bar, but during his Rtay of nemly two months he reportH that only three days offered in which a boat could be risked for sounding, and t11at during 011e of them tluиre was a Lreak until the flood tide had run a considerable time. Arrangements had been made for <letermiuing the positions of the boat while on the har by simultaneous angular measurements at three 8tatiom< on the sl10rPs, wliich wern to he occupied, respectively, by Mr. Lawson, ]\fr. Anderson, and Captain Uharlf's F. 'Vimиor, of the qu11rtermastcr'I' department, who had kindly offered his asHistance, and who seconded all the effort5 of Suh-As8ixtaut Lawson during the entire working season. At this juncture tlie sailing-master iиefused to do duty, and Mr. Lawson was constrained to take charge of the boat, leaving his shore Htation unoccupi1,d. The hydrography wa& continued until the middle of September, when it !tad embraced about four miles of the inside of the harbor, the anchorage in South bay, and part of the north channel, as will be seen by reference to the resulting chart {Sketch Ko. 44,) which accompanies this report.

Two lnmdred and eighty-five observations were made with theodolites in detC'rmining the poRitirms of the boat when sounding- on the bmи. The party <>f )fr. L:1w~o11 rcturuell to their vcf'sel at Shoal \Yat<.:r hay, and went tn f'f'a on 111fи 2Stl1 of Septemlier, his purporn \,(;inf!" to ,:top at Koo,: hny. A very hemиy an<l long-continued g-ale m,Hk it irnprncticable to do ~o. 'I'lie Fauntl.,roy wиachhl San Trauci~co on tl1e Rth of October, and was thenи lai<l up for the winter. After discharging bis crew :!'\Ir. Law8on and bis aid took up their office-wmk. The embarrassment before referred to in connexion with the charge of the hoat was reliPYrиd by the continued kindness of Captain \Yinsor. Under the terms of a loave of absence from the rpmrtennaeter at Gray's harbor, he acted as saifo1g-master of the Fauntleroy and conducted the ,иessel to San Frand~eo. His unremitting disposition to oblige is specially mentioned by Sub-Assistant Lawson a~ having furthered the work of the party. :Mr. Lawsou's report contains the following remarks in allwиion to tl1e character of Grny'~ barbor: "The results of tbe work confirm my previous estimation of the n<tturc of the entrance. ThPrc scPms to be no well-defined clmnnel acrnss the bar, and thP bar is very uneven and lumpy. Iu one place I found nine foct of water on it. Nor is the channel as ~traight as I supposed; it takes a curve to the northward." "According to my expe1ie11ce on tlie bar the coan current ahcaps sets to the nortliward. The flood tide sets in across the South sands, and iwt in tlie d1a1111el across the bar. The strong ebb tide strike~ thio off-shore current and is deflected to the north, thn:;, pn,lmbly, causing the eurve in the channel. 1 estimate the off-shore current that rum; acroHf\ the bar to hanи. an av<'rage rate of about thre" knotB per hour." :Mr. Anderson was detached from the party of Sub-Assistant LawHon on the ;;)1st of October, and has since reported in person at the office in 'Washington. He had served in this section from ]\fay, lSGO. Tidal ohs<'rvations.-Mr. L. \Vil8on has continued, um1cr the general supenиision of Lieutenant G. H. Elliot, U. S. Engineers, to keep in operation the self-registering tid(;-gauge at Astoria, in Oregon. He has also furnished a very complete series of meteorological ob:iervations.

COAST SURVEY OFFICE.
J.tlajor rv: R. Palmer, s. Topograpltical Engineers, Assistant Coast Surve:_;', n'tained the charge of the office until the 11th of April, taking occasional supervision of the division det11ils, while at the same time attaehecl to the Btaff of Major Gt0neral ]\f cClellan, aud at interv11ls performing actiYe wilitury duty in the army of the Potomac. Since that date the office operations have been directed liy A.,s1stant .T. E. Ililgard, the permanent charge having devolved upon him by tlw deatb of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel ]'almer in June. The duties of general assistant were performed until Jun<> by A.~sistant Edward Go(J{!fd!ow; since that time in turn by Mr. TV. L ..Nlchol.wn and .1l1r . иT. 8. Brar{ford, of whom the last-named had passed the fire.t half of the working year in fiel<l service in Section V, which he is now about to iиesurne. He has been replaced by J.tlr. C. H. Boyd, who was also of the field party which worked until Jnue on tlw eoast of South Carolina. The report of Assistant Hilgard, (.Appendix Ko. 11,) and tlie sub-report8 accompanying it from the chiPfs of the several divisions, give a general view of tlie occu1iation in each. Though the force of the office has been materially reduced since the outbreak of the waiи, it will be seen by the statistics given in the subreport1:1 that the average of work heretofore done has not been remitted. Ko cl1a11ge in the charge of eitlwr branch has occurred within the year excepting in the Drawing division, the charge of which was nиsigncd by Captain T. J. Lee on the 8th of April, his services having been requested by the Bureau of Topographical Engineers. I proceed to review here briefly tl1e report of the assistant in charge, referring for further details to the Appendix. 'l'he office divisions will be mentioned in tlicir usual order. и Hydrographic division.-The details of offiee-work, arrangements in regard to veesels for the parties assigned to duty afloat, and an emergency requiring liis personal services for tlrn hydrography of tlie Potomac river, have fully tried the energy of Captain C. P. Patterson, the able chief of this branch of the office. At certain junctures during the year the requisites for service in connexion with the hlockading squadrons, to which reference has been made under the heads of sections, have called for more than usual addrei's and promptitude in action. As the instances occurred, the difficulties lmve been met and oYercome with the sound judgment that ha:! also directed the ordinary details of his division. 'l'hese have been executed, U:l heretofore, chiefly by two draughtsmen. Mr. Artliur Balback, principal hydrographic draughtsman, has veri!ied the reductions prepared for

Of 8pecial topogrnpliical sheets of the vicinity of Washington, which for obvious reasons liave not been either engraved or lithographed, about a hundred photographic copies have been furnished from the office for the use of tlie corps of engineers and 11rincipal commanders of the army. The superYision of hydrog-raphic details in the office, and the anm1gcment8 in regard to the vessels of the survey, have been, as last yeaiи, under the able charge of Captain C. P. Patterson, hydrographic inspector, whose unremitting .:_,xe1иtions in the public service are worthy of all praise. The 8ervices of tlw go1eral disbuniing agent, Samuel Hein, esq., have been continued with his usual zeal and fidelity. и 'l'he ckrical services in the office of the superintendent have been acceptably discharged, as heretofore, under the dirPction of TV.

THE COAST SFRYRY OBSERYATIONS, BY A. D. BACHE, SUPEIUNTENDENT.

[Furnished by authority of the Treasury Department to E. anrl G. W. lllunt, New York, and r0vised October, 1862 ]

'l'hc following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water in some of the priucipal ports of ihe United StatcR. The result8 are approximate, the observation~ being ~till in p1иogress, but they may safely be u8ed fo1и 1nиactical purposes. 'I'he number of places of observation, :rnd tlie time during which many of them have Leen made, are steadily on the increase a" the Cou~t Surny advances. The tides on the coast of the United States, on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Paeific, arc of tlll'Pe different classes. 'I'hosc of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, el1Ling and flowing twice in twentyfour hours, and l1aving but moderate differences in height between the two succcsilive high waters or low waters, one occurring before noon, the other after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb aud flow twice during twenty-four houri::, but th<> morniHg' :mil afternoon tides differ very considerably in height, so much so that at certain p1'riods a rock whieh has tl1re1' feet and a half water upon it at low tide may be awash on the next succeeding low wat.er.

.i.Yote.-The mean interval in column 3 has been increased by 12h. 26m. (half a ~an lunar day) for some of the ports in Delaware river and Chesapeake bay, so as to show the suece:;ision of times from the mouth. Thenиforc 12h. 26m. ought to be subtractPd from the establishments which are greater than that quantity before using them. 'l'he foregoing Table I gins the means of determining, roughly, thC' time and heiglit of high water at the several ports named. The hour of transit of the moon preceding the time of high wиatcr is to be taken from the Almanac, and the mean establishment being added, the time of high water results. Thus: Example I.-It is required'to find the time of high water at New York on November 5, 1854. The American Almanac gives O/t. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for New York, from.'l'able I, column 3, is Blt. l3m., which, as th) transit was at Ok, is, rough1y, the time of high water. The moon bciug full, the height is that of spring tides of column G, viz : 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart are reduced to low watei' tiitring tides, 5.4 fed arc to be aclrlell lo thl'm to give the depth at high water. If the soundings arc reduced to mcau low water, the rise and fall of mean tides being 1.1 foot less than for springs, the rise or increase of depth will be half of this, or O.G of' a foot less than 5.4 feet, which is 4.8 feet, or neady four feet ten inches. Example IL-Required the time of l1igl1 water at no:;tun on January 23, lj51. From the American Almanac we find the time of the moon's southing or transit on that clay 5li. 18m. a. m., arnl from Table I the mean interval at Boston dry clock is llh. 27m. We have then 5/i. lBm. time of transit. To which add 11 27 mean interval from Table I. 16 45 time of high water, or 4k. 45m. p. m. If the Greenwich Nautical Almanac is used, add 2m. to tl1e time of tra.nsit. of GrPcnwich for every hour of west longitude, and its proportional part for less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half hour wl1ich may be over any number of hours, as the correction for less than tliis would be lc:3s than one minute, and cs 13

need not be taken into account. Thus, Boston is 4h. 44m. west of Greenwich. The correction to be applied to the time of trnnsit of the moon iR, for the four hours, eight minutes, an<l for the forty-four minutei;, one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is 177i. 9m. of the 22d, or 5h. 9m. a. m. of the 23d, to which add nine minutes; the correction just found give:; 51t. 18m., as before asccTtahrnd from the American Almanac. In using the l'nited States Kautical Almanac, in the astronomical part of which t11e transits of the moon are given for the meridian of 1Yasbington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the Atlantic coast, be neglected. To :find the time of the next following low water, add, from Table I, the duration of ebb tide. This gives '1lt. 45m. p. m. time of high water. 6 13 duration of ebb tide from Table I. 10 58 p. m. By subtracting the duration of flood tide we obtain the time of the preceding low water, lO!t. 32m. a. m., reco1lecting that 41;. 45m. p. m. iB the same as 1611. 4;"1Ji. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide, corresponding to the transit of 51t., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and foll obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. The next following high watr may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood from Table I, thus : lOk. 5Sm. p. m. time of low water January 23. 6 13 duration of :flood from Table I. Sum 17 11 or51t,,llm.onJannary24. Or, havirig found the time of l1igh water, the time of the next following high water may be found by adding the duration of flood and ebb together, and their sum to the time of high water found, thus: 6li. 13m. duration of ebb tide from TaLle I. 6 13 duration of :flood. Sum 12 4 26 45 duration of whole i!tl.c. p. m., ,January 23, time of high water.

Sum 17 11 or 5h,, 11 in. a. rn., January 24, time of the next succeeding high water. Subtracting t.he same quantity will give the time of the preceding high water, thus; 4h. 45m. p. m., or 1611. 45rn. from midnight, is the time of high water. 12 26 duration of flood and ebb tide. 4 19 a. m. of the 23d for the preceding high water. The duration of the flood and the ebb being reckoned from the middle of one stand or slack water to the m;ddle of the next, the time of beginning of stand of ebb or flood will be found by rnhtracting half the dun.tion of stand or slack water given by column 10, Table I, from the time of high or low water, and the time of the end of the stand of c1b or flood by adding the same. A nearer approximation to the times and heights of high water may be obtained by the use of Tables IT and III.

In these the variationR in the interval between the moon's transit and high water arc shown for some of tl1e, principal port8 c01itaincd in Table I. These variations of intervals depend upon the age of the moon, and, as they gn tl1rnugl1 tlwir valu.:s in half a lunar mont.h, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table cxti:nds from the Oh. of transit, midnight of the calendar day, or full of the moon, 11;\- hours. The numbers for change of the moon correspond to those of Oli., and for 13 hours (or lap. m. of ;he calendar day) to 1 hom-,иand so on up to-23hours. The ports for which the numbers are given are dei'ignated by the hcat1ing of thr, columns. Tb' m(иan interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two days afterwards, on the Atlantic coast. At Key '\Vest it occurs more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more ne.arhи. The s~me remark applies to the heights. Spring tides occm- about two days after the full and change of the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarters. The use of this table of nearer approximation i~ quite as simple as that of Table I. Rule to finrZ tlw time ef higli water.-Look in tl1e Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing) for the date r('qnired. In the table conesponding to that time will be found the number to be added to the tim(' of tmnsit. E:rample JJJ.-Requircd the time of high water at New York October 1, 1856. Thing tl1e United States Nnutical Almanac, we find the time of moon's transit lh. 24m. astronomical reckoning, or lk. 24m. Jlи m. eaknda1и time. From Table II we have, unt1er the heading of New York, for lk. 30m. (the nearest number to lk. 24m. in the table) Sh. lOm. 'J'lrns, to 171. 24in., time of moon's transit, Add S 10 interval fouml in Table III.

и

to

The sum 9 34 p. m. is the time of higl1 water on the 1st of October, 18.56. If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide would have belonged to October 2, and we must ham gone back to the transit of the day before and computed with it to obtain.the tide of October 1. Rule to find tl1e lwigl1t ef high water.-Enter Table III, column 1, with the time of moon's transit. In tl1e column headed with the name of the place, and marked A, will be found the rise and fall corresponding to the time of transit; in column B, the number to be added to soundings on the chart, where the soundings are given for mean loVI: wat:er; in column 0, the number to be added to cl1arts of which the soundings are given for low water sprmg tides. In. the foregoing example, (III,) the time of transit being 1 and 2 hours, we find from 'T:ble III the rise and fall of tides on the 1st of October, 1856, between 4.9 and 4.7; the number to be added to soundings given for mean low water 4.5 feet, (column B,) and for low water spring tides (column C) 4.9 feet. Having found the time of high water, that of low water be obtained, nearly, by adding the duration of ebb from column 9, Table I. 'l'he time of the next preceding low water may be found by subtracting the duration of flood from column 8, Table I. The time of the next following high water may be found by

adding the duration of both flood and ebb, and of the next preceding high water by subtracting the same duration of the whole tide. E.-r;ample Jl~-To find the next high water following that of Example III. The.duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New Tork, is Glt. Om.; and of ebb, from column 9, is 6h.. 25m.; the sum is 12/t. 25m. To 971. 34m. p. m., October 1, time of high water found, Add 12 25 duration of flood and ebb. Sum 21 59 or !Jlt. 59m. a. m. of October 2, the time of the ne::s::t high water.

TIDES OF THE PACIFIC CO.AST AND Ol' PART OF THE COAST OF FLOHIDA. On t11e Pacific coast there are, as a general rule, one laiиge and one small tide during t11e day, the height of the two successive high waters occurring one a. m. the other p. m. q,f the 8ame twenty-four hour.~, and the intervals from the next }H"ecediug transit of the moon are very different. The inequalities depend upon the moon's declination; they disappear near tlw time of the moon's declination being 1iotl1i11g, and are greatest about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water are not the same as for liigh, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the ~aIT.e times. 'l'he tide!' of the 8outheru part of Florida and of the western coast of that peninsula, as far as St. !lark's, arE> of the same character. In Puget's sound the inequalities foT the intenиal of l1igl1 water and for t11e height of low water follow this rule; but those for the interval of low water and height of l1igh water disappear about one day hefore the moon's declination is greatest, and are greatest about four or fivp day~ before the grca.te;.:t cleclination. When the- moon's declination is north, the highest of the two tide:-; of the twenty-four hours occurs at San Francisco about eleven and a lialf hourB afkr the moon's soutliing, (tmusit ;) a.nd when the declination is south, tlu~ lowest of tl1e two high tides occurs about that interYal. The lowest of tlrn two low waters of the day is one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of. these tides will prnbably appear more plainly from the am1e::s::ed diagrams. In tl1em tlie height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the cfay are at the top. At 12 noon, for example, the tide-gauge marked 6.7 feet. ,Joining all the heights obserYed in the twenty-four hours, we have a curve like that marked in the figure. The two high waters arc a ::md c; the two low waters b aud d. If a ii' the high water which occurs about twelve hours after the tramit of the moon, when the declination is south, the ebb ti b is quite small, and the 1 high water, a, is much lower than the next high water, i:. If the moon's declination is north, it is the la1иge high water, a, of the secoud diagram which occurs next after the transit, and about twelve hours from it. At Key "\Vest the contrary obtains, diagram 1 applying when the moon's declination is north, and diagram 2 when south. 'l'ables IV and V give the number to be added to the time of moon's II transit to find the time of high water almost as l"eadily ru; in the 7 former case. They are of double entry, the time of transit bciug, 6 as before, placed in the firat column. The number of days from the day at which thA moon lmd the g1иeatest declination is arranged at the top of the table. Entering the fir~t column with the time of transit, and following the line horizontally until we come under the column containing the c'lays from the greatest declination, we find the number to be added to the time of the transit to give tl1e. time of high water. If the moon's declination is iooutb, 'l'ablc IV is to be 0 used; if north, Table V. Tables- IV tD IX, inclusive, have been recomputed, using more complete data for the inequalities aborn и referred to, and to those for San Francisco similar tables have been added for Sau Diego, As1oria, Port Townshend, and Key West, }~la. }'or the other places on the Western Coast given in Table I the following rules will give sufficiently close approximations.

REPORT OF THE SGPERINTENDENT OF

'l'o obtain the times of high or low water for San Pedro, Cuyler's harbor, and San Luis Obispo, compute first the time for San Diego hy Tab1eR IV, V, 01' VIII ; then add to the time thus obtained 30 minutes to obtain the time for Sr1n Luis Obispo, and subtract 13 minutes for Cuyler's harbor. At San Pedro the time of high or low water is sensibly the rnme as at San Diego. }'01' l\Iontercy, South l'arrallone, J\Iarc i8land, .Benicia, Havenswood, and Bodega, compute first the time for San Francisco ; then subtract from the time thus obtained Iii. 44m. for :Monterey, llt. 29m. for the South Farallonc, and 49m. for Bolkga; and mhl 34m. for l\1are i~land, lh. 4m. for Benicia, and 30m. for Ravenswood. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, compute first the time for Astoria; then rnbtract from it 40m. for Humboldt bay, llt. 16m. for Port Orford, and 9m. for Neeah harbor. }'or Steilacoom and Scmiahmoo bay, compute first the time for l'ort 'l'ownshend, and add to it 57m. for Steilacoom and lit. for Semiahmoo. The approximation will be only a rough one for Steilacoom. For the heights, Table8 YI, YII, and IX for San Diego can be n~ed witlrnnt change for San Pedro, Cuyler's harbor, and San Luis Obispo. These tables for San :E'raneisco are also applicable to J\Ionterey, South }~arrallonc, and Bodega. For J'.lare island add 1.2 foot, for Benicia 0.9 foot, and for Ravenswood 2. 7 feet, to the и1uantities for San Francisco. For Humboldt bny, Port Orford, and KePah liarL1or, the tables for Astoriиt may be used, suutracting 1.7 foot fo1и Humboldt bay, and 1.0 foot for Port OrfOl'd. For Neeah hmbor the tables will give app1иoximate results without change. For Semfal1moo bay, add one foot to the quantities in Hie tables for Port Townshend. For Steilacoom, a rough approximation may be obtained by adding 4.6 feet to them. For the coast of Florida, compute the times of l1igh or low water for Key \Yest, and subtract lh. 7m. for Indian k<иy, and add 2Gm. for Tortugas and lll. 5lm. for Egmont key, 3li. 45m. for Cedar keys, and 4h.. Sm. fur SL Mark's. For tlrn height~, add half a foot for Indian key, and use the tahles without change for Tortugas and Egmont key. :E'or Cedar keys and St. ::\Iark's, t11c results could not be obtained with much accuracy in this way; special tables will be prepared for those places.

To obtain the fall of the next low water or small low water, we enter 'l'able IX, for San Prancisco, with Oh.. of moon's transit, and two days after the greatest declination in the first part of the table, and find 1.9 foot, which will be the difference in the height of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit ancJ day in the second part, we find 3.0 feet, which is th'e rise of the large high above the small low water; the difference between 1.9 and 3.0, or 1.l foot, ia the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to see how, in this way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to what they wouM be approximately at all the successive high and low waters.

REPORT OP TIIE SUPERINTENDENT 01' TIDES OF THE Gl:LF OF .l\IEXICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida around the peninsula to St. Mark's, the tides are of the ordiuary kind, but with a daily inequality whieh, small at Cape Florilla, goes on increasing as we proceed westwanl to Tortugas. From the Tortugas to St. Mark's the daily inequality is large and sensibly the same, giving tlie tides a great resemblance to those of the Pacific coast, though the rise and fall is much smaller. Between St. l\lark's and St. George's i~land, Apalacl1icola entrance, the tides change to the single day class, ebbing and flowing hut once in the twenty-four (lunar) bonrs. At St. George',; isli:md there are two tides a day, for three or four day8, about the time of the moon's declination being zero. At other times there is but one tide a day, иwith a long stand at high Water of from six to nine l1oms. Yrorn Cape St. Blas to and inclurliug t1rи mouth of the Mississippi, the single day tides are very regular. and the small and irregular double tide~ appear only for two or three days, (and frequently even not at all,) about the time of zero declination of the moon. The stand at high and low water i~ cornparativcI~ии short, seldom exceeding au hour. To the west of the month of the }fisf'issippi the double tides reappear. At Isle Dernicre they are distinct, though a little irregular for three or four days near the time of the moon's zero declination. At all other timPs th<' single day type prevail~. the double tide~ modifying it, however, in the Rhape of a long stand of from six to ten hours at high water. This st:md is shortest at the time of the moon's greatest declination, sometimes l1cing reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tides arc dif:'tinctly double, but with a large daily incqmtlit,r. 'l'bc rise and fall being small, thC'y would often present to the ordinary observer the same appearance as at lele Dernfrrc. At Galveston the double tides are plainly perceptible, though ,;mall, for five or six clays at the time of the moon's zero declination. At other times they present the single day type, with the peculiarity that, after standing at high water for a sl1ort time, the water falls a small distance, and stands again at tliat heigl1t for several hours, tl1en continues to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following high water, and then acquire~ a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas Pass aud Brazos 8antiago 1lie E<ingle day tides prevail. Small, irregular, double tides are only perceived for two or tl1ree days at the moon's zero declination. At all other times there is but one high water in tl1e day, with a long :-tand of from six to nine hours, during which tlrnre arc oft.-m 1<mall, irregular fluctnutiomi or a very slow fall. In the following table the mean rise and fall of tides at the abon stntionB am given. The highest high and the lowest low waters occur when the greate,;t declination of the moon happens at full or change; the least tide when the rnoon'H declination is nothing at the first or lll.St quarter. The rise and fall being BO small, the times and heights are both much influenced by the winds, and are thus rendered quite irregular.

TO DETERMINE THE RfSE A:\'J) FALL OF THE TIDES FOR A:\'Y GIYEN TD!E FROM Jucm

on

LOW \Y"nER.

It is sometimes desirable to know l1ow far the tide will rise in a given time from low water, or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which has clapeed from low or liigh water, by knowing the rise and fall of the tide in the interval. If the proportion of' the rioe and fall in a giwn time were the same in the different ports, this would easily be 8hown in a ~iuglP tablf', giving tl1e proportional riFc and fall, which, by rcferri11g to Table 1, sbowiu.g the ri~e and fall of the tidl' at the port, would give the rise and fall, in foet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the same in differc11t ports, nor in tl1e samtи ports for tides of different height~. The following table Xl drnws the relation between the h<'ights above low water for each half hour for Rew York aucl Old Point Comfort, and for ~pring a11J neai) tidef' at each place. Units express tlm total rise of high water above low water, and the figures op1io~iteиto each lwlf hour denote the proportional fall of the tide from high water om1иar<l to low water. For example, at ~cw York, three hours aftc1и high water. a spring tide ha;. fallen six-tenth8 (sixty-hnndredthc) of the wholP fall. Suppose the whole ri,;e and foll of that day to be 5..1 foet, (TaLltи I;) then, tlm:e l1our,; after high water, the tid1и will have fallen 3.24 foct, or three feet three inc11es, ncaTly. Converndy, if we have obscrnиd that a sining tide has fa1len tlmиe feet three inches, we may know that high water has 1rnssed alwut three lrnnr~.

TIDES IN COASTING.
By obsei"Ving the time of high water and low water along the coast we find tl1e plaecиs at which th<'y arc the same. 'l'he map of co-tidal lines (Sketch Xo. 65, C. S. Hep., 18.57) shows that it ie hig-11 watrr nearly at the same hour all along the coast frnm Sandy Hook to Cape Caii11veml; of counsc not in Layo aMd hmLors and up the rivers, but on th~ outer coast. . и и It is high water exact~" at the Mme hour all along tlie line marked X fl, seen on the drnrt, n<':tr 8nnily Hook, a.ud north and south' of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions at Cape Lookout and Cnpc Fenr, all the way to near Cape Oaiiavernl. 'l'l1is same line extends eastward to near Block i~land, aml ~onth of .11;иantucket, and then pusses away from our coast. At full and change of the moon, along thi:; line, (ap11roximately,) it is high water at twelve o'clock, Grcemvicli time, the local tiwe of liigh water depending upon the 1()11gitude 16 cs '

It follows, then, as a general thing-, from these two tnbll'S, that the coa8ter,, iu pa~siug- fn.иrn Randy Hook to tlrn Rt. John's, would have the ti<ll'8 the Rarne, within ~ome fifteen minute~. as if lH' rcnrni11fиc1 :it Handy Hook; so that leaving, for cxamplи', at high water, he would, nccortling to the elnpscJ tiuw. han: the: d1l1 anJ flood alternating every six hours an<l ll 11uarter, nuarly, as if he had remained near S.wc1y Honk. As the flood tide setR in generally to the nortlnnu-d and on share, and tlie ebb to the Routh wan! aml off shore,' lie would know by tlic time that elapsed from his departure antl the period of the_ tide at which lie started what tidal currents he might expect to meet as lie passed along the coast. Thi:J, of course, i:i not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for any of the entr1mcei> given iu ihc table, takirrg care not to mistake the time of ticles within for that at the entrance. By referring to George ,V. Blunt, e!lq., I have obtained the trackR of sailing :rnd 8team vessels passing from New York to ports to the south of it, as shown Ly the lines on the chart accompanying thi;:; paper. (Sec Sketch N'o. 65, C. S. Rep., 1657.) Tracing these on tl1c map of co-tidal Hues, I have tletPrmined how the navigator woulrl find the tides as lie passes from port to port. The re:;ult:; are ╗howu in the anncx<иd table, (C,) in which the port between which anti Sanely Hook the mariner pas8es i8 at tlrn hC'ad of the table, and, at the side, the place oft' which the co-tidul hours will be fonnd, as stated in the table.

'l'hns, from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with 12 hours 5 minutes, off Barnegat there would Le, at the same instant, 11 hours 57 minutes, aml off Capp May 12 hourn 10 minutes, so that the navigator woulil han~ the Harne snccc~sion of tides whet.her he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware Lay, or whPthcr lie came from Delaware bay to Samly Hook. So from Sanrly Hook to Charleston he will find, at tllf' same inst:mt, 12 hours 5 minutes at SaucJy llook, 11 hourB 57 minutes off Barnegat, 11 hours 4.:; minute~ off Cape :;\lay, and i'O onwarcJ upou the parallels of latitude for the several points. For all pract:cal purposes, tlten, rif coasting, tlie succession ef tlte tides, anrl, ef course, qf tke tidal currents ef ffood and ehb tci1l he tlu: same as if t11s 1uwigator remained stationary. Leaving at low water lie will meet the flood for 6 hours 10 minutes, and then the ebb for another G hours 15 minutes, and so on. It is the simplest of :111 rnle~ that has thus come out of this investigation. That remarkable change of the temperature between the waters of the in-Ehore cold current and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream occurring in so short a distanel' that Lieutenant l3ache called it the "cold wall," takes place at distances off the coast of from 170 to 2fl mile", (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape Canaveral, measured, from the several points named in the table, at iиight angles to the direction of the course, or measured along the parallels of latitude of ihe pointB, at distances, from 19;) to 28 miles, between Assatcague and Cape Canaveral, (Table D.) The points where the imrnllel~ nmth of Assateague meet thi~ uivhiion line have not been accumtely determined.

REPORT OF THE srPERINTENDENT OF

In paseing from Xew York to nu eastern port the nrst great change in the tides and tidal currents is between the East river aml Long Island sounrl. 'l'he diffonиuce bdween Governor's i::'lm1d aml Negro Point, on \Yard's island, at the eaEtcrn entrance to II(иll Gnte, is two hours and fmty-fi\иc minutes. Betw(иen this pointr:md Throg'B J>oint tl1e drnng<и is small. The marinC'r is now in t11c full tide of t11c sound, and lietwecиn 'l'hrog'~ Point and Pi~her's islarnl there is a Jiflerencc of time of but two hours an<l. t\1иcnty minute8, the greate8t part of which b at the heat1 of the sound and at. its entrance, tlmt i~, near Thro~и'>< Point aml Fisher's island. .From off ::\ew London to off Sand's Point the difference is bnt one hour and forty minutes; so th:1t. if the mariucr, imitead of remaining at Throg',; l)oint, passes onward to Fishcr\3 iiilm1d he woul<l loee but half a tide in the whole pafsage. In other words, he would have the same succession of rise and fall, ' according to the time clap~cd, whether stationary or pa~,;ing onwmd, иwithin two liour~ am1 a lialf, or less tlrnn half a tide. The ti<lnl current lines slww that even a kss allowance is to be made for the change of current than for the change of tide, the difference in the clurnge of current between Throi!"'s Point and }'i,d1er's ii'laud, along the rni<ldle of tlw sound, Ll!ing of no practicable im1rnrtancc. P,u,;ing out of Long Isbnd ~ound the tidal hours grow mrlier, until off l>lock island tlmt of l:laudy Hook is again reached. The co-tidal line of Sandy Hook and Dlock i'3land being the same, it is the Btrugglc of the same tide through JI\ mv York hay and the narrow Ba;;t river, and ob~tructcd Hell Gate, and thrnugh Fi8her's i,;laud and Long l8land sound, and to 'l'hrog's Point. The tidal currents meet near 'l'hrog's l'oiut. The l1ni-~r part of' Narragansett Lay has the co-tidal hour 12 hours nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at 11carly the eame time all around the bay. It would Le impossible to give in a small com1>ass a minute account of the tides of Martha's Vineyard and Xantnekct sound. In general, it may be said that as far as Holmes's Hole and 'Vood's Hole they re;<emble those of Block Island sound, and afterwards thoBe of .:\Ionomoy, at the eastern entrance; but this generalization i8 unsatisfactory without more details than there is P]Jacc here to give. In these sounds takes placeи tl1e remarkable change of between three and four hour~, the greatest change of our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of 11igh '\\-ater at places rnuth and west and cast. and north of Kantucket .. The whole of this change takes place between the eastern entrance of Xantucket sound and the western of 1\iartha's Yi1wyar<l, giviug rise t11 quite a crnn1>lex condition of both tides and currents, whid1 it has occupir.id much time to unravel. The dornirnmt co-tidal line of our coaRt, from I~lock i,-larn1 to Cape Canaveral, is that of 12 hour~ of Greenwich time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to Passamaquod<ly, is, in general, 15 hours. Passing out of ]'\ antuckct sound coaster~ carry nearly the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, mi cl tlwncP vary their time nbout half an hour in pas~ing to Bo~ton, to Portsmouth, to Portlm1ct, or to lJassamaquoddy. It ha~ long been known tl1at the tidnl almanac fm Boston migиht practically be used for eastern port~. Yes eels from X cw York to Halifax, and N cw York to Europe, which keep outside, and shoul1l keep well off the N antuckct shrntls, and off St. George's, as shown by the track on the chart, vary their co-tidal liour but little, kc<>ping between the lines of 12 and 11! until quite well on tlieir course, and beyond C.ipe Sable. The Raine rule will apply to their case as has been given for vessels between New York and a southern irnrt.

ON TllE CO-TIDAL LINES OF THE GULF OF MEXICO, BY A. D. BACHE, St:PJ<:r.I!ll"-TENDENT.-(SKmcH No. 46.)

In the Coast Surv<.'y Report for 18;)6 I publi8hed a paper on the approximate co-tidal lines of the Gulf of Mexico. This paper was hasctl on observations made at numerous stations during the progress of die survey. But with the exception of four stations where the observations were extended over more than a year, the stations were seldom occupied more than two montl1s. Corrections for the amount of variation derived from the nearest complete station were applied to the means; still, it was tho~ght that better observations carried over longer periods wou!a clear up many of the doubtful points. Accordingly, a systematic plan of observations was laid out, involving tl1e occupation of four stations simultruieously, with self-registering tide-gauges during one year uniutenuptedly. 'l'he execution of this plan was begun by c11tn.Llishing the stations of Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West, and Tortugas. Mter tl.ic

Some particulars formerly suppo~e<l to be due tu errorR nf oh,;ervation are con firmeu; thus, for instance, the earlier co-tidal hom of the semi-diurnal tidC' at Indian Key than at Cape Floritla. The question uf tlie interference of the tidal waves coming through tlw Florida c1iannel and through the Caribbean sea ]rns not made any progress, nor is it likely to do so until the features of the tides at the weflt end of Cuba and the extremity of' Yucatan are better known.

SLR\'E\' OFFICE,

иoctober 1, 1862.

Srn: I ha.-e the honor to submit the fo1lowing n'port on the field and office work perfornlf"d by the tidal party under my charge during the past year. Fidd-work .-The tidal obse1иvations made under the direction of thiH division have been confined altogether to the permanent ~tations at J,;astport, )fr.; Hoston, l\fass.; N cw York; Old Point Comfort, Va.; San Diego a111l San Francisco, Cal.; and Astoria, Oregon. No tem1JOrary Etations wem occupied except those connected with the by<lrogra11hic 1rnrtie:;. The station at Eastport remained in charge of Mr. Samuel vValkcr until l\Iarcl1, when he was ordered to go to Key 1Yest, to take charge of the magnetical station. Mr. R. H. Talcott took his place. As in former years, magnetical observations form a part of the observer's duties at this station. At the other stations notbing has occurred worthy of particular remark. Of the self-registering tide-gauges seized by the rebels last year, on1y one has thus far been recovered. It iH tl1e one userl by Mr. Donegan at Calcasieu entrance, which, when he was imprisoned at New Orleans, he had deposited with the Briti~h consul, from wl10rn it was obtained after the capture of the city. 'J,;wo sheets from the tide-gange formerly at Last island, La., were received last .Tune with the X ew Orleans post office mark, but without letter stating by whom they were forwarded. They contain the observatior!s for April and part of J\Jay, 1861, ending on the 13th of that last i11onth, when a note on the sheet informs us tlrn,t the observations were stopped "by order of the governor of Louisiana." The other gauges are in plaees not yet brought back under the control of the government, except Fort Clineh. Prom information obtained at tlrnt place by Assista:nt Boutelle, it appears that the gauge was de8troyecl by tl1e inhabitants previous to the eaptnre nf the town. The following table gives a recapitulation of the observations received at the office during the yea1. with the exception of tho13e taken by the hyclrograpl1ica} parties for the reduction of their soundings.

DEAR SIR:

8rRVEY OFFICE,

TVash.ingtnn, 1Vnvcmher 1, 1862.

The operations of this office, which I took charfc of in April last, wl1cn Licuternmt Colonel Palmer joined the army of the Pot, .mac, have been continued with uninterrupted activity during the past year. 'While the regular progre~~ of the work ha8 been steadily kept up, the energies of several bmnches of tlie office have been atverdy taxed to meet. the demands arising out of the naval and military operations in which the nation has been engaged. It -will be seen from the detailed reports of the cl1icfa of office divisions, that beside the issue of the extraordinary number of over forty-seven thousand printed maps and charts, the hydrographic, drawing, lithographic, and photographic forces have prepared a great deal of special information for the Navy and \Var Departments from the archives of the office, which for obvious reasons has not been published_ The facilities of this offief' for multiplying maimscript maps, either by photograph or lithograph, have afao been placed at the disposal of the topographical engineer officers of the army engaged in the preparation of military ma.p11, and have provP-d of much service.

OFFICE,

TVa:;/rington, October l, 18G2.

During the past yc;u the hydrographic dnties of this office have consisted of a more miBcellaneous and lal1orfou!' character l han usual, iu con~Eи11uence of the nPw and inunPnse demand for charts of all parts of our southe1иn coast for the use of' tbe gr<'ntly incren~e<l number of our naval vessels and the vast fleet of transports in the employ both of the army and navy along the whole extent of that coast. These duties consist, in the main, in the examination and verification of original hy<lrogrnphic sl1ects, together with the original records of sounding~ anrl angl(и-books belonging to those soundings. duplicating these records in some caseH by fair copi<'f'; tlH' re<lueti:m of some and the examination and verification of all reduced sheets for publication; the plotti11g of ligl1t-houses, light-YeFBelB, beacorn1, and buoys, as determined hy our own parties in tlie field or from data furnislwd by the Light-H ousf' Board; making, revising, and plotting of sailing directions and sailing lines; 1he description of tlm1i!'ers; t11e plotting nf tidal and current ;;tat ion~; mak i11g prnjediom; for tlm use of by1li-ogrnphic partie~ in tlw fi<'lil; nntl comparative tracings of localities of wllich two or more surveys haYe been made. In addition to thcl3c there has been a very large amount of smaller detail, occupying much timeи but impo~2iblc to "pccify. ~llr. Artltur BaTbacl has had principal charge as draugptsmau, and in consequence of his long erpericnce, gre'at a('curncy in the minutrиst detail, and remarkable memory in regard to tl1em, he has been subject to constant rail~ to rnpply information required from several divisions of the office, and to corn~et inaccuracies.

Yet his fidelity has caused him to work many days in the office under great suffering, and at all times to perform l1is duty in or out of the office hours, with the utmost cheerfulness. Mr. L. Karcher, draughtsman, has been tbe only assistant to Mr. Ba!Lach.

Electrotype and Photographic Division.

COAST SvRVEV OFFICE, TVasltington, October 1. 1862. present the followir1g report of the operations of the Electrotype and Photographic DiYision sincr October 1. 1861. By the electrotype proc.ess we have made forty-three plates. Of this number twenty-seven were "altos," OT moulrl~. and ~ix!Pen were "l1assos," or duplicates of engraved plates. The efoctrotype work in this office is now conducted with so much facility, certainty, and regularity, by mr:rnR of the im11roved apparatus which has been introduced from time to time, keeping pace with tlie progress of physical 13cience, tliat there now remains but little experimental intereE<t in the work. Improvement iu the proce~s hus ceased to be made, from the perfection attained ; but experiment lrns, nevertheles~, continued. The' great. impro,иpment in the carlJOu plate8 employed for telegraphic batteries has induced me to te~t the prncti<"ability of employing these plates for the negative plates of our galvanic batteries. The experiment ha~ slwwu that the imbBtitutiou would be practicable, though not advantageous. - I find a cmиbon J>latc possP>ses ahout om:-half the energy of a silver plate of the same extent of imrface, but that it has several "working" advantagPs OYt'r the latter. Tlic first of thc8e is in the exemption of the carbon from that liability of the silnиr to get amalgamated by the mercury on tbe zinc platt>B, which is not only a cauBc of great expense and annoyance, but completely prostrateli the electrical action of the plate. 'l'l1e carbon appears also to be free from the deposit~ of copper and other hase metals incidentally present in the batteries, which sometimes coat the silver 11late8 anrl decrPase their action. This last peculiar advantage of the carbon is probably owing to the porosity of the plate, by which the deposited metal is dissipated over a very large surface, and its action thus destroyed. But that the deposition really takes place, though rendered inactive by its great distribution, ii> shown by the fact that, with a Btrong metallic solution and long-continued action, the deposited metal at length appear:3 on the ~nrfaee. In tltis way I completdy silver-plated a carbon plate; the silver was, however, all dissol vcd off again in the course of a couple of days by the action of the cyanogen retained iu the pores of the plate. I also find that tlie carbon plates, as well as the silver plates, can have their action advantage.onsly incr~aied by platinizing.

During the y<'ar occasion has been taken to renew entirely the l)]atinizcd 8i1Yer a~ well as the zinc plates of the batteries, and to put the electrotype apparatus in complete order ; it is now more effectiw than it has been at m1y former time. Tl1c photographic rt:'d~1ction of the plane-table sheets of the tmr\'f'}' lias continued in succcs,ful opcrntion, and maintaius that high importance and utility wl1ich I am10u11e1.ed for it in m~, la~t annual rqiorL The number of sl1cet~ rcducPd has inchиed fallen off, from the cffcl't of the current war on the operations of tl1e survey, bnt this falliug off in our own ap1iropriatc wol'k has been more than m~tdc up liy 11l10togra1ihs for our army, That facility which photography present~ fo1и rapidly copying has caused tl1i~ divi~ion to be Lusy in multiplying important plans, maps, ancl reconnaissances connected witl1 the operation:' of our armic;; in the field. During the year we have photogr:q1hecl forty-four sepltratc miEtary map,;, ancl furni~hed fhиe hundred and sixty-two copiPs of the same. Of the value of these maps, and their aid in the prosecuticиu of the war, my position or information docs uot enable me to judge. I (fo know, howPYer, that if these iihotographe were of aid to our commanding generals, tltP country is indehtecl for that aid particularly to tlll' Huиvey; for it is only by the J>erfrction of tlw 1ihotographicc apparatus and method~ of tl1i~ office tliat those large and detailed military maps could have heen photographed as re(1uired. Tlie photogn111liic art has lately been enriched liy thP production of a 1ww form of lens b~- our countryman, !lr. C. C. Harrison, the well-known working optician of New York. I have LPen so fortunate as to procure from Mr. Harrison the very first le1rn of thi,; manufacture, but theи fow week~ that I ha\-e had it in hand have not sufficed for me to test all its qualities as I coulcl wi:<h for a definite statement to aceornpany this report. I ts superiority, however, over all other forms of lent<es I find to be eompicuoui', and immediatdy strikes the observer. Its angle of visi011 is rnrprisingly great, with a very flat field; it also bear:" more light and has a better defining power than other lenses. 1Yith this improved lens I expect to greatly increase the utility of our iihotogra11hic operations, hy Leiug able to make single pl10togra11h,; of thirty indies square, if not greater. During the year I have paid much attention to the new art callC'd photo-lithograph:r- The result of all my observations has been to confirm me in the opinion which I formerly expressed, tliat t11i,-. proces~, as at present known, is too coar~c and mechanical in its nature and uncertain in practice to be of practiced sen:icc in copying maps or drawings possessing any fineness of ontli1w 01и cldicacy of finish .и The UC\I' lens of which I have spoken al1ove will, howe\'er, enable us to obtain such negati\-cS a~ will do away with much of the uncertainty which attends the process. I will, therefore, again endeavor to apply 11hoto-lithography to the coarser maps aud drawings of the survey. During the year I have been assi~ted by Mr. D. Hinkle, with his usual industry and fidelity. 'l'ables of the electrotypes and photographs"Produccd during the year are appended:

18Gl, to mef't the increa~erl calls made for chart~ arising out of the exigencies of the war, Las Leen continued in active operatiou, cmpl(>yiug- two }ll'esses in printing trnnRfors from some of the copper-plate engravings of the surwT, and a largeи number of original drawing~ engraved or drawn on stone, or trnnsforred to stone from prPpared tracing~ or drawings . .lllr. C. G. Xrebs has been engnged in part as printer, but for the greater portion of his time in engraving or drawing on stone aud making t1m1sfe1иs . .1'l1r. IL Lindi 11kolt! ha~ bee11 during tlie greater part of the year detailed from the Drawing Division and employed in engraving and drawing on stone, in which his experience and skill as a draughtsman have been

of much service.

JYlr. D. B. l1lorga11, as~i~ted by 111r. lVilliam 2\.Iorgan, and recently, since his resignation, by 1'1r. JV.

Tl1ese mcrnoir8 l1ave Leen l)Ouml UIJ b~, JJlr. JJI. T. Jolmstone, befme and since hi~ assignment from thi:; div-ision to the care of the map room, in Augu~t la~t. In accordance witlt the uniform practice of this office in offering evny aicl practicaLlr in assisting the other departments of the public ~etTicc, Sl'Vcral maps pr<иpanиd L.r topograpl1ieal eugiucers attached to the army and othPrn for tlic n"e of thP quartermaster'"' department han: bee11 pnt on stonf'., and copie>' printed and furufohed with a rapidity and l'conomy 11ot to be easily obtained in euch surlden calls for work; i11 some cases many copies of important maps of surn:rs have been fo a condition to be iorncd on the same dny, in a few hours after being handed to us for multiplication. In addition to the printing of our charts proper, a map rqlresenting the :-;rиat. of' war in Yiiиginia was, at the suggestion of the Superintendent, compikd by mysp!f during the past yem-, and printed in colors, partly as an experiment in that class of work, aud i1artly to ID<'Pt the popular demand for information on tl1e movements of our armies. Tl1is map lw~ met with llll<'Xpected succe~:s, aurl ha~ lie<'n rnud1 called for, and copies quite freely di~trilrnt.ed; but, in order to cover the c'.xpen~<'~ of irs g-etti11g np anrl printing, a nnmher of co11ies have been placed in the harn1~ of our Hnlc agent~, the pro~eeds of whidt banи more than covered expenses; in nll, some five thousand fi,-e lrnndn'd copies haYe been printed, over tweuty-fiYe huncJred sold, and nearly tliree tl10u~and copie~ g-ratuitou~ly distrilmte<l. Our cxpPril'tJC<' with this color-printing hao been of scrvir,t> in the proposed treatment of eornc of our rrgular preliminary charts and sketches l1y rcpreeenting g-radations of wundi11g~. land, sand-bank,~, &c., by a system of light coloring. Tlii~ method will be prosecuted as the pressure of work rnny p0rrnit. In conclusion, I would bear testimony to the as~idnity of all the cmpfoyt~ in thi8 <livi,ion during the past year of incessant demands upon our care a;1d attPntion.

The distribution of the Superintendent's report of ISGO has, as in the case of that of 1859, been confined to inrlividuals aud institutions in tl1e loyal Stat.es of the Union. The usual foreign distribution of reports through the Smithsonian Institution has been su,;pended for the present.

DF.ATt Srn ; During the last year the Coast Snnиf'y operations under my dirHtion have consisted Pxelusively of compntation~ and r<'dnctions, the field-work being suspended in consc1p1ence of thP war. The ~arne cause hat< acted to retard the progrcs8 of t}ie reductions to a con~idmиal>le cxtrcnt, and but for the diminution of my party wliich it has occasioned, I might at present enjoy the ~;1tisfaction of mporting the whol1и of tlll' l01igitudc work as complt>t.-ly nиdueetl. Nn l'mall prngre.~.~ hai', lrnwPvcr, been made, and the work ha" been completed upon four of the campaigns, viz: Ualais-Bangor; Apalachicola-Eufaula; 1llaco11-Eufoula; l'rnrnC'ola-.Jiobile. The di,;cu;;fion of these ob~ecrntions, although extended and minute, has elicited few results of general ~eiP.nt ilic interest which have not l)(wn hrnugl1t to light by the computat.irm of former longitude measurements. The pheuom(иn:1 attenrlh1g th<' transrn.isRion of signals have been similar in these and in former campaigns, Bhowing in :tll a]>proximat<'ly tl1<' same velocity of tmnsmission, andи the same dependence upon the position and l'tr<'ti;;th of the l>atfr>иi<'f'.

Indeed, their variability is so d('cidecl 118 to lead rnP, in the di~cm8inn of the oLservations, to aim always at their climin11tio11, mt.her than at their cletermination, contrary to the course ori~inally pursued.

Among the observations of the Macon-Eufanla and Pensacola-)[obile campaigns are several series of clock signals, or Eimultancou$ records of the beats of tl1c clocks at both stations, recorded on all the registers. 'l'he~e doek ~iguab wen' made alternately with serie~ of ob~e1-vations for time, in the hope that some method miglit yet proYe equal iu accurncy lo that of star signals, which should be at the same time less tedious, laborious, and expensfre. 'l'he experimBnt hrrn been thns again fairly tried, but, I regn:t to say, found wanting. At least, with the portable instiиuments wl1ich from the very natmиe of the case we most use, the error and rate of tlw clock~ cannot Le dettermined dosdy enough to give clifferences of longitude equal in accuracy to those 0Ltai1wd by the method of ~tar signab. The accordance of results during any one eeries _ fa admirable and scductin:; but the comparison of the results of different seric" and on different dates unmasks the delusion, and drnw~ ilwt tlie clock rates cauuot- l1(' rdicd u11011 a~ 1mflicicntly constant, although the clocks are of tlte Lest workma1rnhip of K(иoseb, Hanly, :mrl Krille. During tb<> pa,_t yc:ar th(и circmnpol:u arnl time ~tar lists to whicl1 l have frequently alluded in former report,,, and whid1 had Leen impron<l from time to time dnring the pa~t eight years, have been adopted by the Na\иal Ob~ervmory and Ly the );autical Almanac as >'taudards of right ascension, and have been printed together with tables of mean places of each of tlic one hundred and seYenty-E>ix st;trs for the bPginning of the thirteen years 1851-1SG3. и The methods aud detail~ of their formation, togethPr with tlie dii;cuesion of the syslf'matie Lliflercиuces of tlic seYeral c::italogues an.series of oh,.,en'ations employed, are prepared in full detail for publication with the "IlccordB and Itcsults" of the Coast Survey. The equinoctial point,,.corresponding to Argl'lander's "IJ,,LX Stl'llarum Fixaruin Posztioncs ilfedim" was selected as the fundamental zero. for both catalogues, and all the materials cm11lnyed were subjected to tlw correetions requisite illi. refening them to tl1is zero LC'forc th<'y were introduced illto the equation!' of condition. All obscnиations~nce the time of Bradley whid1 seemed likely to add to the precision of resultant value& were incorporated in the determinations, and I think W<' may be ju~tified in nиgarding the positions and proper-motions of tl1e~e lists aR commens11ratE~ in accurnry with the prcocnt con<lition uf 1wactieal astronomy, and thcreforn not unworthy of the title "stauclan1 right asccn~iorn,." Tlw Lq;иi1millg of tlu, ypar 18;;;, waE d10~e11 as tltc epoch of the two shu li"ts, primarily becau~e it was a date m:ar to, yet in adYance of, the time at which their preparation was begun, viz: 1852; but there seemed an ad<litiornil appropriateues~, ina:'much as this epoch is prnciscly on century later than that to which lhadltиy'~ ob~crYations are rf'f'rиrred in the Funtlamcnla Astumomi,e. The rigl1t asceIJsions d(;ducible from the fidd olJservatious of the telegraph parties, although made with rnrn11 portable in~trurncnts and a magnifying power never exceeding one hundred, have, to my astonishment and ddigl1t, hcl'll proved by tl1(:f'l' computations to surpas>l in accuracy a majo1иity of the observations upon which the deteiиmination of the "standard phces" was necessarily based. I have, therefore, taken steps towanh col1ecting the ob~ervations of' tl1e stars of our list>; from the records of the several camp!tigns, with the imrposc of fиrnployi11g th!'m in the llf,xt revision to which the increase of observations aml the lap"e of time may render it de~irahle to ~ubject them. Moreover, as each rncce~~fre longitude campaign has been computed, the right ascensions of the signal stars ernvloyecl have lwrn r11'tlu.,rиrl and placed on record; and I hope before long t() submit a catalogue of the rigl1t aHtиen~ion~ of l)l'tWePn fiye and six hundrc(l of these signal stars, as an incidental fruit of the careful zeal of tlw ol)s╗rvn>', e;;peciall y of .Messrs.

'l'hc care bestowed on the cxperimcnt8 to ascertain tl1e effect of tl1c temperature on the instrument, and tl1e persevern11cl' with whieh tlHи_y wen: carriBd out, were not rewarde<l with a correFpouding 11Pgnиo of agreement in tlw result~ obtained by the various proces~P~ <>mployec1. 'I'his, it will be recollccter1, was also tl1e case at other obsc1иvatorics. The s11hject of the coefficient of temperature for the bifilar magnet is fully treated in the preface to th(; three volumes containing the recor<l, and it will, therefore, in tl1is place only be necessary to recapitulate in general Llie result~, aud t<J state the nature of the experiments tl1ere dc,seribccl. The first olislиrvationg for tl1P tPm11eratme codlil'in1t were made on July lG, 18-!0, Oscillations wrxe observed alteruately at the ordinary tcmpcTatuw and near the freezing point, obtained by surrounding tlie box containing the nrnguet with ice; at the l'ame thr1c', comparative oscillations of a bar in another building were observed to forniHh the neclиssary data to cm..-cet the Lifilar re8ults for any cliangc in the Lori.:nntal force during the progrc,;s of the Pxperiment~. The value deduced was 2.8 scale ilivit!ions for a chm1gc of 1░ :Fahrenheit. Ko reliance wa>< placed on this r<.'sult, on account of the comparatively 1иude indications of the i<ub~idiary instrument, and al~o on accuunt of an irregularity at a certain i10int in the curve representing the connexion of cliange of force with ehange of temperature. The method of deflections was triec1 and aban<lone<l on aecount of the small amount of deflection at a distance sufficiently great to prcveut the chance of permaucut chmigcs from the mutual action of the bars. On the 22d of February, IS.fl, comparisons by vibrations were again re.-ortcd to, hut with no better succes8, the correction fur change of force during the interval being unsati::ofactory. The result deduced was 3.0 :o;calf' divisions for 1o Fahrenheit. A111,Jying tlic res11lts to the readings of tbe bar when mounted on the bifilar SllFpcnFion wires in the ohHcrvatory, they were so little 8atisfaetory tlmt it wa8 determinc<l to get the change of intensity of the bar by heating aud cooling the observatory wl1ile tbe bar remained in situ. In J1m11ary and Ycbruary, 1842, a continuous sc1иi<иs of obscrvatiom; was made by allowing the observatory to attain the winter temperature on om~ day, and obtaining thus a result by compari~on with the preceding and succeeding da:p, when the room was artificially warmed. 'fl1e value founrl was LG/; Rca1e divisions fur 1░ Fahrenheit. At this time the observatory was warme<l by a soapstone stove with copper fixtures. About. the close of the year 1842 an efficient set of subsidiary instruments was mounted in one of the coll pg" buildings, the uifilar magnet being about nine inches in length. After the relative value of the scale:> of the in~trnmcnt8 had been ascertained, comparative ob~ervations were made, six each rla.y, in the morning arnl afternoon. Thlи~e olll;crvations and results are given in o. taLle extending over eleven months in 1843, an<l over eleven month:; in 1844. The 1иesults were fluctuating, and tlw discrepancies proved, conclusivelyи that other c:mscs were at work which would not lie aecounted for. '.!'lie changes in the force were generally small. In the course of these experiments I found, beyond a doubt, that instruments of the same <lirnensions were rer1uired to give comparative results. During an aurora the small instrument in the college gave by no means the same results as the large instrument in the observatory. There were numerous comparisons determining this. I had reason aho to believe that the large bar liad its induced magnetism easily disturbedи and not regularly renewing itself, so that the correction for temperature may be supposed compound, one part pennancnt and one Jmrt temporary. The following results were obtained : Observations between :February and June, 1843, 2..'iO scale divisions. " July anil December, 184:1, 2.28 January and .Tune, 1844, l.94 " July and December, 1844, 2.00 " " for 1░ FahrPnl1eit. It may al~o be ~tated tlmt no reasonable supposition in regard to differences of temperature between the indications of t11P- thermomc>ter and magnetic liar, or to changes in the coefficient varying with the temperature, will explain o.ll tlie cases of diecrepancieB. In thc~e comparisons, always near each other in time, small differences in intensity, as shown by the subsidiary inetrument, were allowed for, but the corrections for temperature of this latter instrument were neglected, as the changes of temperature in the building where it was placed were small.

.Adding +3.5 scale divi~ion to the mean value of Bm the above differcnccs will balance. According to the above results, the annual progressive cliangc is + 17.6 x 12=211.2 Fcale divisious, nnd the change in magnetic moment of tLe bar for a clmngc of 1 o Fuhr. in the tcmpcrninre, or q = + 1.G2 X O.OOOO:W5= 0.0000591. This agrees with the best direct determination, licing the onc in which the observatory wa~ alternately heated and cooled. To test these result~, a combination of the six warmest months with the six coldPst moutl1s, liy alternate means, furnished several values for q depending merely on the assumption of a gradual r('gular progressive change during each year and a half, for which separate results W('re deduced; this sPries commcnC('S witl1 May, 1841, and {-,Dds with April, 1845, aud contains, therefore, tl1c same number of months as the first combination, excluding at the same time the two defective portions noticed above.

The re~ult from this combination + 1.3 confirms the preceding value. The result according to weight Or" scale divif'ions, or q = 0.0000548 in parts of the horizontal force, has, therefore, been adopted in the reduction of the bifilar readings to a standard temperature, for which +G3o.o Fahrenheit has been determined upon as the mean tempcrature of the magnetic bar during the fi,-e years' series of ob,-lcrvations. The difference in the resulting value for q, when obtained from ddlections or vibrations, and from combinations of the hifilar readings themselves, has been remarked before, aud no satisfactory explanation has as y<'t been given of it. Tims, for instance, at Toronto, the two respective valnes were 2.69 and 1.63 scale divisim1s, as shown in General 8abine's remarks (Yol. 11 I.) 'l'hc existence of a similar di~crepancy in the case of the Makerstown bifilar has been detected by ?.fr. Broun. 'Yhatevcr may be the cause of the differenee, tl1ere can Le no hesitation in sayii1g that the result derived from the bifilar observations themselves is the one to be prefo1Ted. At St. Helena, (Yol. II, London, 1860,) the two values were 1.45 and 0.98. The half-yearly compnriHonf\ at thi,; ~tation even show a les8 value, viz., 0.88 ~cale division!'; 0.98 (for convenience 1.0) was adopted in the reduction. Dr. Lamont, in his Handbook of Terrestrial l\lagnetism, (p. 206, edition of 184~),) s:iys : "It ileserYC8 to be remarked that the nJt1e olitained by comparing monthly mean readings of the bifilar at higlt and low temperatures is smaller than that obtained by direct observation."

It will be Feen from these values that the I'hiladclphia bifilar magnetometer was very sensitive; its scale valnP in parts of the horizontal force is but four-tenths of the Toronto value, and only two-tenths of that of tlie St. Helena instrument. In the computations which follow the tenths of scale readings have been omitted, (keeping only the nearest unit,) a.R contrilmtiug nothing to th(' accuracy of the results, and merely increasing the labor of reduction. The uucertaiuty in the rea<li11gs arising from the uncertainty in the value of q probably affects the units, and the same may be said of the declination changes, so that in extreme ( in<liviclual) cases the next higher figure may be affected. 'l'he next step of the reduction consi,;ted in trarn;cribing the wl1ole body of the observations after coITecting them individually for differences of temperature; the adopted standard temperature being 63░ Fal1renheit. '['he following table contains the monthly means of the hifila.r readings reduced to the standard temperature ; the series has been made continuous by the application of certain co~ections explained Lefore. '!'he readiugs arc in scale divisions of 0.0000365 parts of horizontal force; increasing numbers denote decrease of force. The time is Observatory mean time, counted to twenty-four hours for convenience sake.

o The, actual mean of 17 days was 293; to reduce this to the m~an of 27 dn,-s, 19 scale divi"ions were subtracted, rcsulti1Jg from an interpolation between January 1 and January 12 ; the metin of 7 days preceding and following the !':aP was made use of. t Owing to causeи :tlready explaine<.l, lhe means of May and June diff~1и so much as to affoct the continuity of the serico; the same is to be said of the differences between June and July, 1840, and bet.wi;en Dccrml;er, 1840, and .Jamrnry, 1~41: the corresponding differences bdween the same months in the other four years furnish us with the mea.ns of correcting the H'TiPs for the first year, as will be ~ecn hereafter; it also appeared advisable to omit tbe readings in June, 18▒0, altogetlwr, the instrument not having been in stable adjustment. t The numbers in table II have been slightly changed, to refer the mean of the hour of observation to the mean rrmlling from observation of 12 hours o day. Comparing the mean at 14h. 22m. in each month with the reиpective monthly means in the other four ye!lrs the above corrections hec..me -5, -5 and O for January, l<'chruary, and March. The bar between Septem'ber and October, 1843, separates the means from the bi- honrly and the hourly series. In the application of the reduction for temperature no attempt. whatever has been made at interpolation in the magmиtk series, but whenever a temperatttre reading was acci<lenta.lly omitted, it bas been supplied by comparison with the ol'senиetl temperature immediately precediug and following. No magnetic reading can be snrplicd by interpo:atinn, howernr short the interya.l, as long as the law of the occurrence of tbe dU.turbances remains unknown.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

of 77; and betwC'en May and June, 1841, a diffc1иcncc of 103 divisions. They require separate treatment, as For tl1e ccnTPct ion of tl1e progressi,иe changes the mean reading from one month's series waf' made out for the first, midule, and last of each month. By this 11roccss of taking the mean from 14 uays preceuing anu 1-! days following C'ach of the epochs the lunar e:ffcct 011 the solar variation is practically eliminated from the re~ulting mean value.* These means corresponding in time to the b<>ginning, the middle, and the end of each month, furnii.;]1 t],,. raft: of cliang1~ for tlie fint and second half of the month, and by simplC' interpolation give the concction for progressivP change for each day. If tlie rates for the first and second half of the mouth arc different, the monthly rneanB of eacl1 hour (from the blue figures) will di:ffer by a small but r:oTutanl quantity from tl1c former monthly mean~. Thus, for instance, for the mouth of June, 1842, the montlily mean is 651 divi~ions, corresponding in timC' to the middle of the month; the mean of the readi11gs (at 630) for the second half of :Thfay and the foиst half of June is 641, corre,;poarling in time to the first of June; and the mean of the readinge (at G30) of the second half of .T unc and the firnt half of' July iH 67~, corrc~ponding in time to the last of J unc; the correction ap1)licd to the Li-hourly readings (at 63░) on June 1 was + 10, and to the reading,; on Jmw :rn waR -22 divi'3ions. At the middle of the month the correction is zero, aud for the intermediate days it is i11 pn,portion to their TP>'pPdfrc distances from the middle. The algebraic sum of the daily corrections divided hy the number of days of observation is -3, which gives the new monthly mean 648, as corrected for irregularity in the prog1иe><sive change. In the exceptional case of a break, or lll'ginning and termination, tl19 required rate of change for half the month was found by a Eimilar process, using lialf-monthly and quarterly means. The following table, No. IV, contains the monthly mC'ans of the bi-l1ourly and hourly readings of tl1e Lifi!ar magnetometer rC'ferred to a uniform tempcraturC' ((i3::i Fahrenheit,) and corrected for irregulmity in the 1irogrn,;:-;ive change. It is here inserted for the purpose of comparing it with the monthly normalR, showing the clmngC' prodnccd by the exclul"ion of the di,;turbances. 'l'he means in the month of June, 1840, are suppressed, and the readings between June 1 and June 5, 1841, were not used.

" In connexion with this subject, the first part of an interesting paper by Mr. Broun may be conmlteu, viz : "On the lunar diurnal variation of the magnetic declination at the magnetic equator." -Proceedingи Royal Sociity, Vol. X, No. 3n, 1860.

In connexion witl1 the operations of t11c L nited States Coast SurvPy, Assistant Scl1ott has inv<'stigated* tlie secular change of the horizontal intensity at a number of ~tations on the Atlautic and l'aeifie eoast~. .At several sta~ious the results were subsequently improved 11y a discussini of my observations for inkn~ity, made in part in connexion with a magnetic survey of Pennsylvania, and also cxtPnding into adjoining StrrtP~, and, in one of the journeys, into Canada. .From the cornpkte mafrrial the values iu tl1e followil1g tll hie of observed horizontal and total intensities have been collected.

(>Added while tuis paper

pasoing through the press.

The first thre<' ob~ervations were not made at the Girard Colleg<' grounds; and it appears from Professor I,oomis'R ob8ervation, wh('n compmed with Dr. Locke'~. that a correction of 0.023 in the value of X shou!J be added to tliese. To the twelfth observation I have assigned only half WPight. It was, probablJ'и made during a distmLance. From the gPneral discussion an annual diminution in the horizontal force of 0.0011 parts was c1educed for a number of stations on the Atbntic coast. At Toronto (vol. II I of General Sal.iine's Discussion) the annual dr.crease was found 0.0010 in part8 of the liorizontal force. l:king somewhat guided by tl1ese results, aftPr several trials, tlie followilig comliination of tbe results in tho tablP has been adopted, as perhaps l1e~t Tepre~enting tli<' valrn:8 for tl1e time during wliich the Girard College observations weTe made, th<'~e fatter 111,ing merely of a differential c.harncter:

4.191 4.174 4.145

Tl1<' annunl diminution of X is 0.0030, or, when expressed in parts of the horizontal force,= 0.0007; it;: e11uivaleut in scale divisions is 19.2. 'l'he totRl annual change was found to bi: 220 scale divisions; hence, 200.8 scale divisions of annual change is due to loss of magneti~m of the bar. The mean PIиoch iB 18H.0, and the corresponding mean X = 4.170; the mean epoch of the observation taken at thC' Giranl College is January, 1843, for which, theref,ire, the mean value of X = 4.173. This value has Leen adopted whenever it was desirable to introduce the horizontal force in absolute measure.

/Srl'aration ef tl1e larger disturbances.-Tlrn observations having been referred to a uniform temperaи tmиe, and correch,d for progressive chang:e, Peirce's eritcrion was applied separately to each month. For this purposr., a sy~tи~matic appli..,ation was made extending over the whole series of observations, coinmendng with the hour 0 anrl the month of July, next wilh the hour 2 and August, followed by hour 4. and September, and so on ia regular 1mиgression. This process eliminates from tl1e result the diurnal variation and the annual va1иiation of the dititurbanccs themselves. 'I'he -value for Oh in July, 184.0, was omitte<l as affected hy t-wo very large t1istnrbances. The following table shows the limiting value of difference from the mean (the monthly mean for the respective hour,) also the number of observations in each year subjected to the process:

The limiting value derived from 11c1uly 1,500 olJFervationF is 39 scale divisions, and the separate annual values show plainly the effect of the cknиn (ten'!) rear period, tl1c :rcnr 184:3-4 being a minimum year. Certain limits in the a<loptirm of a sl'1rnmting value are allowa1lf╗ and upon trial a~ to the actual number of distmbauces Feparatccl, the value 3::l ;:cale di,-i,jcms was finally adopted. Auy olJservation differing 33 diииisions or more from its rcspccti>e monthly mean was, therefore, marked and excluded from the mean. 33 divisions er1ual 0.0012 parts of the horizontal force, :mc1 in the value of tl1e absolute scale it amounts to 0.005 . .At Toronto the limiting- value was 14 divisions,= 0.0012 parts of the horizontal forcr,, equal to 0.004 in the absolute sc:ile.-l Vol. III of the Toronto Ohservatiom.)

Forcc.-In 'l'uLl<e YI tl1e nnmher of disturbances in each month has been given as found from the obse1иvations;

these numb('ro al'c, however, not. clircdly comparable with one auotlier-first, on account of some omissions in the recor<l; mul S<"comlly, on account of the change from a bi-hourly to an hourly series. For any incomplete mouth the numlиet of <li8tmbancc,; for tlHи whole month is obtaineJ by simple proportion from t11e number during the part of the month recorded; fol' January, 1841, the total number becomes 35; for June, 1841, the total numLer i8 18. l'mи January, February, and :March, 1843, the mean total number of the disturbances, us fonncl in the same mont11~ in thro prececling and following year, was substituted; this mc:m gave 8, 20, and 20, r0Fpedinиl;-. TL" number of distmbauces after October, 1843, were halved to make them comparable with the hi-hourly scriee. There were two auomalous montl1s, July and December, 1840, in which the disturhances amount to 1G5 and 120, with an annual m\иan of 64, whereas in the same months in the following year they only amount to 2G and 2G respectinиly, with an annual mean of 27; the mean annual difference 37 was applied to t11e numbers found in 1841, which give fl3 and G3 as a substitute for the anomalous values in July and Uccernber, 1840. This anomaly docs not exist in the J>henomcnon itself, but is unquestionably due to the irregularity in the progressive change. Table IX contains the number of disturbances as distributed over the several years and month.-, all referred to a uniform series of bi-hourly obMervalions. To this table the monthly means and their ratio, when compared with the annual mean, have been added; also for c0mpmиif'on, the corresponding ratios found in Part I of tbe di8cus;;ion of the t1isturlrnnceи of tlie declination.

Maxima and minima in tl1e columns of ratios are marked with an asterisk. 'The inequality in the mean amount of tlie horizontal force disturbances in each year, indicates the year 1843-'44 ~;,; the minimum year. From the preceding results, we may assume the month of N ovembcr, 1843, as the epoch for the minimum of tlrn eleven (ten?) year inequality, as far as indicated by the differential observations of' the l10rizontal force. Furtlter Analysis ef t1i.c Disturbances ef the I-Бorizontal Force.-The di;;tribution of t11e disturbances in number and mean amount over the several months of the year has been given in Tables IX and X. }'rom Table IX we learn that the disturbances are greatest in number in Sepkm1JPr and March or A1}l'il, or about the time of the equinoxes, and least in number about January and June, or about the time of' the solstices. At tlic autumnal equinox the numbers exceed tliose of tho Yornal equinox; the same la.w was found at Toronto; alAo the num1ers are smaller at the summer solstice thau at the winter solstice, in perfect accordance with the re:-u11 found at Toronto. Thet<e results are shown grapl1ica1ly on Diagram B of l'art IV, (Sketch No. 50,) which <'ontains also the ratio of the disturbances for the declination in which the same law is apparent. Table X shows that, in reference to the average magnitude of the disturbances, the same law holds good, to wit: tl1e greatest relative magnitude occurring about tho time of the equinoxes; the greater amount corresponding to the autumnal ccp1inox, and the least to about the time of tlrn so1sticcs, the smaller amount occurring near the l'urnmcr solstice. The average magnitude of the disturbances of the declination was found tmbject to the same law. If we separate the disturbances which increase the force from those which decrease it, we may fonn the two following tables of tl1e distribution of the disturbances in number and average amount over the several months of the years.

The Jisturbanccs increasing and those decreasing the horizontal force evidently follow different law"; at 'l'oronto they were found completely 011posct1; they rne IP~.~ so at Philarklphia. Tiuи principal maximum of increasing di~turbances (at noon) se0m to Le cotemporaneom' with a secondary minimum of thP tll'crea>"iug disturbances; again the principal maximum of the dccrca-'ing dioturLanccP (at 8 p. m.) corn:qiondo to n Eecomlary minimum of the increasing disturbance:<. In reference to the main feature, the maximum di:<turbancc of tbo8e increasing tlie force and of those d<,crcit,;ing thr: forceи, the l'hiladl'lpltia ratios show c"cn a grnater r<'SPmblance to the results at St. Helena and the Cape of Goo cl Hope than to tlwsc at 'l\Jronto. At the two rnutlicrn stations tl1c maximum in t1e disturbauees which iuere~tce oecnrs nt ] 1 a. ru. and the maximum in the di6turLances which decrease occurs aLout 6 or 7 p. m.-(.See vol.

Tl1.-, RYl'rage amount l1y which tlie rlistnrbtmef'R tend to df'rrrnl"f' rlw cliurnal n1ri:ition of thrи lиorizontal force is 1.4 scale divisions, OT 0.00021 in the alJrnlute ~cale. Tlw maxinmrn effect take~ pluce at 8 p. m., at exactly the same hour when the declination di5turbancff reach their greawst effect. In the preceding tables, XIII, XIV, and XV, to thP hours indicated 21:'Б minutes ~lwuld be addt:d, the observations being made so much later than the even l1ours. 'l'he p1иeceding discussion sho-ws that for two station8, C'.Ycn at a comparatively sl1ort r1istm1c<', a;; for Philadelphia anJ Toronto, there are, generally s1icaking, some close coincidences i11 the laws derin;J from independent observations; but there are also certain differenct's in other results; yet it mn~t not be forgotten that for a strict comparability we reguire, if not simultaneons olи$ervations, at least obse1Tati011f! extPnding onиr similar parts or the whole of an eleven-year period. The Philadelphia Reri<иs includes a minimum year of that inequality, with the greater extent of observations before tliat epoch, whereas at Toronto the se1иief begins after the minimum epoch, and barely extends to a maximum year. For the purpose of obtaining a better view of the absolute amount of the disturhanees anrl their frcqueney of occurrence,и they were classified in nine groups of e11ual differences of 20 scafo divi~ions; the number of disturbances in eaeli was found as follow8 :

The numbers in t11e last column cannot be considered as entirely independent of the eleven-year period, and in attempting to apply the tlll'ory of prnlrn hilitirno; in reference to the number of disturbances which ought to occur between the assigned limits, it became apparent that the laiиger disturbances greatly preponderate-a fact no doulit intimately connected with the difficulty in correctly allowing for the progressive change during the fit-st year of oLservation.

APPENDIX No. lG.
DISCUSSION OF TEE MAGNETIC AND METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS MADE AT THE GIRA.RD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY, PHILADELPHIA, IN 1840, 1841, 1842, 1843, 1844, AND 1845.-PART Y.

Investigation ef the Solar-Diurnal Variation, and of" tlu Annual Inequality qf the Horizontal Component the Magnetic Force. By A. D. Bache, LL. D., Superintendent United State8 Coast Survey.

ef

The discussion of tl1e diurnal and annual variations of the horizontal forcp iR based on the resulting montlily normal values for each observation hour as given in the preceding part (IV,) in which t11e horiv,ntal force haR lJeen discussed in relation to the ten or eleven year period, and which also contains the investigation of thl' tli8turbanccs; in the same part all necessary statements are given relating to the instrumental data and the uli~olute values of the horizontal force. The normals, as has been shown, arc referred to a uniform standard temperature; they are corrected for irregularity in the progressive change, and are necessarily freed from all the larger disturbances. The use of the normals im<leail of the simple means of the readings (corrected for difference of temperature) will insure greater regularity in the variations of the horizontal force, now under consideration. 'l'he diurnal variation rcquil'es an arrangement of the five-year series of monthly normals according to the months of tl1c year and hours of the day. In general, the method of interpolation for an occasional omission in either a month or l10nr, iH the same as that used in Part II of thl' lliscussion of the Girard College observations; there is, however, tl1is difference in the tabulation of the monthly values, that in the present case the results are consolidated in a five years' arrangement, and in consequence the year commences with the month of July. Thiti arrangement was p1иefcrred, particularly since it was found desirable to make no use of the observations in the first mouth of the series. Tabulation of monthly normals for each observing hour, and each observing year, beginning and ending with ,July. 'l'he individual values are taken from 'l'able VII of the preceding part, (IV.) After applying the corrections of-19 scale divisions to the normals for January, 1841, and of +s scale divi:sions to those of June, 1841, to allow for defective number of observations in these months, a further correction of +68 scale diYisions W:IB applied to all values between .July, 1840, and May, 1841, incl~sivc, and

of +60 to all values between .July, 18,iO, and December, 1840, inclmive, to allow for defects in the regularity of the progressive change, thus making the total correction for the latter month;; =128 f'enlrи di.-i~ion,. 1'111и. above corrections, when divided by 5, in order to give the correction to the means derived from five y(иars, become, therefore: for monthe between July and December inclusiYe, + 26; for ,January, + 10; for F..J,rllary, :March, April, and ~lay, + 14; for J uue, + 2. 'l'liese correction;; are con~taut. for each hour of tlw <lay in any one month, and conecquently do not affrct the dinrnal variation; but they have nevcrthdes8 heen a11plied at onec to facilitate sub~elptent <le<luctious. Their origin has abo Leeu ex11lai11ed in the remarks aecoml'auying '!'able v of the vreceding part. 'l'he following example uf the proces8 of int<'rpolation for tlie or1tl honr value~ will ~nffice for all ~imilar caseE: Required the mean normal from tho five-year sc1иies for 511. 2l~m. a. m., in.Tune, ( ~ee talrnlar values ancl results below,) '!'he mean nornmldor the two last year~ at 4/1. 212m., D/1. 2l:!m., and Glt. 21,!m., are 1176, 117:!, and 1169, respectively; the mean at 511. 2l~m. is therefore 3 dhиision.'i less than the mean at 4lt. 2qm .; anr1 ~ince the mean of the five-year eeries at 4/1. 2l~m. is 853, the result for 5/i. 21 ;!nz. becomes 84!.i. Again, adding 4 dfri~ ions to 847, the mean at 6/i. 21;lm., we fiml 851; the mean of the two Yalues, or 850, is tliat gin!11 in the table, to which +2 haR been added, making the final result 8D2. The nwan:o of the odtl houff, thus found from tlte adjacent even lwu1иR, in gc1wn1l, du not r1iffer by nR mueh a8 a ~l".alc diYi~ion. The time given in the tables of the normals i~ mean local time, eonntinp: from midnight to mid1iigl1t to twenty-four hours. 'I'he observations WPre taken (on the aиnиrage) 211 minutes after the full hours, ai< imlicated in the tables. Increase of Fcale readin~s indicates decrea"e of horizontal fore(и; the Yalue of a scale division <'qnals 0.0000365 parts of the horizontal fore(', or 0.0001.')23 in ab~olute rncasnrc, the nu;an horizontal force being 4.173 (in ab!"olute mca~ure.) Proper 11иeights have been given to tl1e mirmals of tiи<' C'Vl'n aud odd hours, in proportion to the number of ol1.,crv11tions, as will be seen hereafter. Other special rem~Lrk~ will be found at the end of the month to which they refer. Tabulation of the hourly normals for each month and the mean of the five-year series, expressed in scale <livision rnadings and reduced to the standard temperature of 63::i, (.J<'ahrenheit's scale,) also corrected for all irregularities in the progressive change. The regular progressiYe aud secular change, therefore, remains iu tl1e tabular rp1antities.

It exhibits in the annual rrnran, as its characteristic type, a maximum vahw ahour, G It, rn, a minimum valup ahont 11 a. rn., a seconflary maximum value about 3~ p. m., and It ~pcon<lary minimum about fl p. rn. }'or the lialf year when the ~un has north declination, the morning minimum lwcomt"~ small!'r and tlw afternoon maximum larger, thus increaRing the diurnal range; the converBe takeR plnee in the other lialf of the yemи. wl1cn the sun hits south deelination. The 6 a. m. maximum remains nearly uncha11gcd throughout the year. The 1werage summer range (.April to September inclusive) is 0.0046, and tlw average winter range (October to J\Iarch inclusive) is 0.0025, both expressed in abwlutc measure. Tim rangl' between the morning maximum and the morning minimum is 0.0045 in summer and 0.0036 in winter, a,; will he explained further on.-(Sc>e diagrnm A of Part V, Sketch No. 48.) Thi:;. semi-annual change in the diurnal amplitude is more conspicuously represented in diagramB, (derived frmn diagrnm A,) by strnightening out the annual Clll've, and using it as an axis of abscissre for laying off the tlifftиrences bctwern the annual value" and the summer and winter values at the same respective hours of the day. This diagram (B) may, with ad\-antage, be Colllparcd with the analogous one repreE<enting the annual change of the diurnal ,иariation of the declination, as given in Part II of this discussion. The construction is the riamf' in t>it1rnr caflf'.

The extreme Yariation in the epoch of the a. m. maximum i8 therefore 2h. Him.; the variation for the 11. m. minimum is IA . .55m.; for the p. m. ma xi mum it iR 2h. 30m.; and for the secondary afternoon minim urn between 3 and 4 hours. In all cases, the earlier hours occur in the summer season. '!'able IX el1ows the diurnal range, expresRcd in scale diviRions, parts of the horizontal force and in 11bsolute mPa~urc. In thr~ Rfиcrmrl column the range between the a. m. maximum and minimum is given; in the thi1иd column tl1at betwpcn the a. m. minimum and t11e p. m. maximum. Tl1ese two amplitudes for a. m. and for a. m. and p. m., are further illustrated in diagram }<', (of Part V, Sketch No. 48,) which shows the curve to be double crested, with maxima near the time of the equinoxes, and the greater of these near the autumnal equinox.
o The same is the case at Prague; in !\far, June, and July, tlie afternoon maximum wru; the greater of the two. Karl Kreil, in vol VIII Proceedings of tbe Academy of Sciences of Vienna, 1855: "Result.ate aus den magnetiechen De<llmchtungen zu Prag.''

\Yith the exception of the montl1 of X ov('rnber, the values binn above for t11c annual variation are tolerably rPgular in their progrffsion, and con8idning the dclic:wy of the tC"st appliPd to the cиli;:prvatious in deducing the annual variation, this exceptional irrcgufority in tl1c ~ ovembcr value will not affect the g-eucrnl conclusion. \Ye have :is the genPral result: a grmter hmиizontal force in summer (from April to Angu~t) :rnd a ~mallcr horizontal force in winter (from Scptonbcr to :March) than the avnage annual vnhw. The maximum occurs in July, (at Toronto in June,) and tl1c minimum in J::mnary, (at Toronto in Deceml1er.) For Toronto we ha-,;e the cxprr>~sion for the annual variation: 3.531 +0.002 sin (0 +312:-i.) Pm Philadelphia (omitting the No\иerulwr niluo>:) 4.176 +0.001 sin (0 +306░;) the angle 0 in both eqnations counting from Januru-y 15. The annual range is 0.0021 (in absolute measure.)

the JJiagnetic I-Iorizontal Force.

The method purBued in the invc-stigation of the lunar effect on the horizontal force is, in general, the same a8 tlwt explained in !'mиt III of the di~cussions of the Giraru College observations. 'The prncess may be bridl:и recapitulated as follows: Each l10Tizontal force ob,;erYation, after it had been corrected for the effect of diffC'rcncc from the standard temperature and for i1rogn-'ssivC' change, the disturbed readings being omitted, (a~ folly explaiIH'<l in Part l V ,) wa~ marked with its co1-re~1ionding lunar lwur. The observation nearest o the tinw of thP moon's upper transit o\иer the true meridian of tl1c oliservatory was marked Oh, that nearest to the lowl'r t.rnr1sit wa~ markecl 12 1 ', and tlw ob8ervations between, for Wl'stern and eastern hour angles of the moon, were rnarkPd with the proper lunar hour by interpolation. In the hourly series where thirteen obserиvationi' me nиcordeu in twPlve lunnr hour&, that obHиrvation which is nearest midway between any two confecutiYe lunnr hour~ "иa~ omitted. Each oliserrntion and reduced reading tlrns marked with its corresponding lunar lwur wa~ suhtracteu from the monthly normal lidongiug to its respective hour, and these differences were set- down in tabuh1r form, mrnngcd ac~иmding to lunar hours and keeping each monthly result separate for fnturc combination. I,et n = any normal belonging to any red ncell Teading r, the following tables contf1in the' mean montlily Yalmиs of the l1ifferenee~ n-r; a 11ositive sign, therefore, indicates greater force, a negative sign less force than the normal. It need hardly lie repeated that in tlrn original record of the horizontal force increasing numbers dPnnlP a U<'nrnse of the force. 'The gr('atest possible difference is 33, the number of scale divisions, which, according to tlic criterion, separates a disturbed from an uudi~turbcd observation. For t11c formation of tlwse dift'erencl's, whic11 amount to more than 22,000, the manuscript tables of the reduced record were used. Tl1ese tables havc> alrt>atly Leen refencd to in tl1c preceding Part IV. 'l'hc units in which the differcuces n -r arc <:xpnиssc-u are scale divi&ions, one division being equal to 0.0000365 parts of the horizontal forn', or equal to 0.00015:2 in aL~olute measure, the mean X being= 4.173 (in units of grains and feet.) The lunar effect on terrestrial magnetism l1eing exceedingly minute, the process required for its elucidation is pNportionally delicate; all the regular and irregular deviations arising from other sources must first be

lf we give weight to the amrnal means according to the number of obserYations, they would be, one for the first and second year, three-fourths for the third year, one and three-fourths for the next year, and two for the last year. A general examination, however, shows that, owing to the disturbing effect of the progressive change, the monthly means are very nearly of equal value, derived either from the bi-hourly or the hourly series. It will also be shown in the scqucиl that the lunar diurnal variation is nearly the same in the f'Ummcr and winter seallOns. The means of Table V and the final means of 'l'ahle VIII have, therpfore, hcen adopted without reference to combinations or weights. A comparison of the values of 'l'ablo YIU among themselves shows them to he very irr<'gnlar, a1thoug-h derived from many tl1ousand observations. A five-year series of observations seems barely sufficient to exhibit a tolerably regular progression. In the following table two groups have been formed, one of results from three years, 1840 to 1843, comprising 8,797 observations, tl1e other from the remaining two years eornprising 13,248 observations. .From these it appears that the lunar diurnal variation during these two periods exhihitR the same general character.

The results are exl1ibited in Diagram A of Part YI, Sketch Ko. 48. The number of observations (aliout 11,000 for each gro111)) iR cvirlently tGo small to climinatf> the greater irrcgulariticE. If there is any marked difference in the lunar-diurnal variation in the summer and winter seaEon, tl1c summer range h; elightly greater than the winter range. As to the epoch, there is no doubt tlwt in wiuuиr tl1c lunar 1n:txima aucl miuima arc earlier than in 8UmmL'r. It is a n,1narkalilc fact that we haYc found th(: same feature~ in the lunar effect on the declination, Yiz: a greater mnplitucl" in ~ummer aud an earlier occm-re11cc of the maxima and minima in winter. 'l'he amount of the shifting of the two curves appears to b0 nParly the same. :From the ten-year series of observations at Prague (i840-'M1) Mr. K,ul Krcil fouucl a larger lunar effect in the summer months than in the wiuter months. Recurring to the final valuPs of the lunar-diurnal variation of tlic horizontal force as given in TalJlc VIII, they can be represented liy the usual Bessclian form of periodic functiom. The angle (J counts from the moon's upper culmination weFtwarcl at the' rnte Qf 150 to an hour; a + ~igu indicatecl greater, a - sign less force tlrnn the average normal.

At Prague all extremes appear from two to three hours later. Mr. Karl Kreil (Dcukschriften of tl1e Imperial Academy of' Sciences, at Vienna, vol.

It seernA probable that the greatest effect takes place rather a day after than on the day of the moon's greatE'st declination. Taking means, as indicated in the above table, we find about the time of the maximum north declination an inerca8e of horizontal force of 1.1 scale clivisions (or 0.000040 partfи of the hmizontal forcr.. ) At tl1c time of the moon's crose<ing the equator tl1e force is decreased 1.2 scale divisions (or O.OOOOH parts of the horizontal force.) The horizontal force al8o appears decreased about the tinw of the moon'B greatest south declination. 'l'he amount i:> alJout half that of the other two cases, and is somewhat doubtful, from an apparently excessive value on the preceding day. According to Ilrrmn, there is at 1\Iakerstown a maximum horizontal force at the time of the moon';: greatest north and south declination, with a minimum fo1иcc at the time of her crossing the <'quator. In two c:1ses therefine, viz: for north declination and no declination, tlw :Uakcrstown anil PhihrJPlphia results agree, while in the third case they disagree or remain doubtful. Kreil's results, from the Prague observations, do not appear to me sufficiently decisiYc and regular to admit of comparison. lnjlucnce ef the moon's iиariation in distaru:c on the horizontal force.-By a process of reduetic;n that fol lowed in the preceding investigation we find:

The probable error of any one result is about the same as in the preceding rernlts (Tables XI and XII.) The l'Csults for variation in the moon's distance are more consistent and satisfo.ctorv than those depending on the phases and declination changes. The lunar effect is to diminish the horizontal .force by its 0.000066 part in perigee, and to increase it by its 0.000088 part when e11e is in apogee.

212

REPORT OF Tlrn SUPERINTENDENT OF

The Prngue resulrn are the same, viz : a greater horizontal force at and after the moon's apogee tlian at and after her perigee.

APPENDIX Nu. 19.
ABSTRACT OF RK-:ULTS OF A ~IAGNETIC SURVEY OF PENNSYLVANIA AND PARTS OF ADJACENT STATES TN 1840 AND 184,1, WITH smm ADDITIONAL RESULTS OF 1843 AND 1862.-BY A. D. BACHE, SUPERINTENDE~T "C~ITED STATES COAST SURVEY. (RKL"TCII 4i.)

In the )'Cars 1Sc10 and 1841 I made a detailed magnetic survey of Penn~ylvania and adjacent parts of

::S cw Y 01иk, Ohio, and Maryland, determining, at a number of stations, suitably selected with regaro to the coursf; of the isomagnetic lines, the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity. To these I added some obser. vations for dip and intensity in 1843, while on a tour through western New York and Canada.
The total number of declination stations is 16, and of dip and intensity stations 48. After asirnming the duties of Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey in 1843, I could not find the necessary leisure to work up these observittions, alt110ugh ]\fr. J. S. Ruth and Mr. G. Uavidson had commenced preparing, under my direction, a partial abstract, confined to dip and intensity observations, and to relative results. In the sp1иing of 1802 I availed myself of the services of Charles A. Schott, t Assistant in the United States Coast Survey, who reduced, under my direction, the obscrvation8, discussed the distribution of the three magnetic elemcntR, presenting the latter results, also, graphically, and prepared this report for the press.

t This work WllB done by Mr.

Schott out of office hourи, a.nd at my own el.pense.

THE L"::UTED STATES COAST SCRYEY.

213

In the summer of 1862 Mr. Schott visited six of the f'tations previously occu11ie<l by me, and ret!Pterminerl the magnetic elements. 'I'luwи of these 8tations, falling within the scope of t11e operntions of the United States Coast Survpy, werp at the expense of the Coa~t Rurv<>y. The observatirms at tl1e tlm,e western stations were Sf'enrf'r1 by thr, libPnilit,y of tllfи S1'.(']'etar:и of th" SrnithHOninn lnstirution, wl10 at tl1e same time offered to pub!itih the observations aml rf'Rnlts in the Smith~onian ContributionF to KnowlerlgP. Tlw obse1иvntions of 1862 grnn.tly P.nhmHиe the valuP of my old,,r 01wrations, nm1 furni,h tlw ml'.1111s of presenting results for two epochs about twenty year8 apart, thus not only giving the most modem values, 1ut also deterrniuing, by the known secular change of the three dcments, any intermediate results. The fruit of these laliors, undertaken for this continent at a comparatively early period, and cornprii;ing tl1e three elements, and the whole conducted 6ysternatically, with instruments well constructed for the time, will no doubt afforil adequate means of watchingи hereafter the secular changca of tcrrc&trial magnetism within the geographical extent of this 8urvey. 'l'he declinatious were determined with a new Gambey declinometer 1e1onging to the Girard College. The astronomicnl ob:'e1Tatiorn; were matle with n sextant antl vertical circle and clironometer, (Grant, Ko. 3,SGJ.) The dip wa;; determinecl with a portal>le circle, hy Hobinson, and a magnetic !Jar and cyliud<:r, according to the mctlwd <lescribed by me in the American Phil. Trans., vol. Y, 1637, in which tl1e vibr:iti.ms are made in a rarificJ m"dium. The full 1iaper, with records, will shortly 1e }Hinted iu the Smitlisonian Contrihutiom to Knowl<,dge.

'I'hese observations were made with a Gambey declinorncter belonging to Girard Col1ege. One diYi~ion (small) of tlie sealc was found equal to 14."5i. as determined in 1844, at Sandy Hook, by Lieut.

The small extent of t11c survey, as well as the comparatively small number of observations, will not permit the introduction of curn1ture in the isoganic lines; they are therefore treated as straight lines. This assumption also serves for the recognition of any local disturbances, as indicated by the di:lferences of observed and computed values. Let D = + 2D_os + x d L +yd M cos. L, where d L = Lat. - 40░ .98 d M =Long. - 77.95.

'l'l1c lG conditional equations have been formed, and the values of x y D found from the normal equations are as follows: x = + 0 ..'>102 y = - 1.206 D = 20.os + O.ul02 d L - 1.206 d l\f cos. L. A comparison of the observed and computed declinations shows the necessity of introducing a term involving d L d llf cos. L. This has been done, and the solution of the normal P-quations gives us the following expression : D = + 20.14 + 0.513 d I, - 1.2.'31 d 111 cos. L - 0.203 d L d :Llf cos. L.

By comparing the differences in latitude and the corresponding differences in dip for each place with the mean values of the group their general accord:rnce was ascertained. None of the differences were large enough to require an exclusion from the series. It need hardly be remarked that a slight consideration shows that the dip depends almost exclusively upon the latitude; the longitude factors will therefore necessarily be very small. JJietlwrl r!f rl;sr-u.и.и;on.-The interpolation formula, proposed by the Rev. II. Lloyd in 1838, (see the 8th report of the British Association, vol. VII, p. 91,) will be used here in a slightly altered fonn,.to allow for the convergence of the meridians. I~et I = resulting dip or inclination. I 0 =assumed mean dip for the epoch m1opted, ( 1842.0,) and tl1e mean latitude am11ongitm1e; 1: its correction. d ;r... = difference of latitude, rl Jl,1 = difference of longitude. x, y, z, p. q_, as well as i, are to be determined by application of the :method of least squares from the observations themselves.

Correction to epoch.-The mean epoch of the six group~ is November, 1841, for which we can substitute without material loss of accuracy, January, 1842, (or 18'12.0.) Comparing the observations made by Assistant Schott in July and August, 1862, with tho corresponding observations about the epoch 1842, we have the following table of differences of results for an interval of nearly twenty years :

Mean t.ntal change in 21 yPars = 3'.8. The increase of tl1e dip is therefore very slight; and if we consider that according to Mr. Schott's investiga tion (Appendix No. 32, Coast Survey Report for 185G) the dip near the Atlantic coast, about the year 1841 to 1844, was at its minimum value, and hence could not have cl1anged sensibly for several years, we can witl1out any sacrilice of accuracy in our reduction, use our results as jf all belonged to the mean epoch 1842.0. No reduction to epoch has therefore been applied. It is probable that the present annual increase amounts t<> about 1'. At Toronto, between 1844 and 1855, (sec vol. III,) the annual increase was 0'.8. In the formula

The proba.ble er.rnr of any single observation is▒ 0'.12 = ▒ 7'.2.

This shows tbnt the incgularitics in the ob.served dip arc due Lo local attractiom ratl1er than to imperfcctious in the needles employed. It is proper, therefore, to assign eq_ual weights to results l1y the direct and indirect mathod of observing.

The maximum difference in the preceding table is 25'; lienee no observation i., excluded. General Sabine's resulting i8oclinal lines, in his seventh contribution to terrestrial magnetism, (Phil.

Hl~PORT

OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The average annual decrease in the value of X between 1840 and 1862 is therefore 0.0030, or, when ex:prcesed in parts of X, equal to 0.00076. 'l'his reimlt. agrees tolerably well with that tlecluced by Assistant Cliarles A. Schott in the Coast Survey Report of 1861, where 0.00110 was found. Supposing the dip to increase at the rate of l' a year, and the total intensity to remain constant, t11e corresponding clecrcaRe of the horizontal intensity would amount to nearly the quantity found above. We cannot, therefore, as yet clcci<l<' whether the total intensity remains stationary or is slightly changing. At Toronto (see vol. III) the :u11111al clcc1иcase of X between 184,5 and 1852 inclusive was 0.0037, (in absolute measure,) or, when expressed in parts of X, 0.00105.

DEVELOPMENT OF BESSEL'S FU:S-CTIOC'T FOR THE EFFECI' m' PERIODIC FOR'::Es, FOR DURATIONS OF PERIODS FBEQUENTLY OCCURRING IN METEOROLOGICAL AND MAGNETICAL INVESTIGATIOXS; WITH EXAMPLES.CO~MUNICATED BY CHARLES A. SCHOTr, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The effect of the action of periodic forces can be expressed analytically by a function of the form: If''= A + B 1 sin (f1 + C 1 ) + B 2 sin (2 e + C 2 ) + B3 sin ( 3 e + C,) + - - - - where A representi'l tlrn mean amount. B 1 B 2 B:i - - - the parameter of it8 fluctuations in the principal and subordinate periods ; the period involving 2 H, being of half the duration of the first; that involving 3 &, of one-third the duration, &c. H rcprc:oents an arc proportional to the time, and inversely proportional to the length of the period; which is represented by 360'0. C 1 C 2 C:; - - - are angular constants, determining the epochs of their respective fluctuations. 'l'he frequent and easy application of this function, especially in meteorologieal and magnetical investigation;., a1so in tidal discussions, rcnc1e1иs it convenient to have a collection of the forms, which the general expression assumes for such numbers of observations in a cycle, as most frequently occur. 'I'he general expression for tl1c la\\' of the formation of the quantities A B 1 C 1 B 2 C 2 B 3 C3 - - -, as well as a more complete cx1i0Rition of the function, will be found in Sir John F. ,'\T, Herschel's article, "Meteorology," in the Encyclopredia Britannica, (8th edition.) 'l'hc m:1Xima and minima of the function are ohtained by differentiation, and the finding of the roots of the equation, 0 = B1 cos. (A C1) + 2 Bi cos. (2 p + C,) + 3 BJ COB.

Bache, the diurnal variation of the horizontal component of the magnetic force, during the years 1840 to 1845, is expressed by the following scale readings. Increasing numbers denote decrease of force, and one diYision of the scale equals 0.0000365 parts of the force. 700 has been omitted from each number:

DESCRIPTJO~

m' A NEW 1\IODE OF CONSTRUCTING THE AXLE m' A MAGNETIC DIPPING NEEDLE -BY
.A88IST.AN'l' J. E. HILGARD.

In observationR of the magnetic dip the mean result is cleared of the effects of collimation, lmlancing, and inllcx c1Torn, liy the invernion of the needle in its bearings, the rcvcrrnl of rolarity and the reversal of the circle. Tl1c eff<'ct of tlrn error~ in the figure of tho i1ivots alone iиcrnains uncompcusatcd, except so far as the supporting on four different parts of the pivots lrns that effect. Kor can t11c agreement of the indications of the nePdli' in itB different po,;irioui' illcrcaRc ottr confillc1wn in 1hc absence of errors of tlrnt class, because they would be cornpcnsateil in the adjustment for reilucing the other errors to a minimum. The necessity for repeating observation~, with the uecillc resting on different portions of the pivots, has always liecn frиli, not only in order to dirninate original enor~ in the figure of the pivot~, but also in order to recognize auil avoid the effects of minute partides of rm;t which mиe liable to be found, especially when the needles arc exposed to tlie >"ea air. Tlw method of cffl~cting this, proposed by J\IAYER, of balancing the nC'ei.llc liy means of weights, so a~ to asRurnc various inclinations, has the disadvantage not only of the directive force being dirniui~hcd, :иrnd tllf' vibrations sluggish in certain positions, but also of the absolute "trcngtlt of nwg11l'tizatio1J entering into tl1c re~ult, rendering it, IIPl"'""ary tliat tlie magne!i~rn of the neeille shouh1 be the same before :mil nf'tcr revcr~ing its polarity-a conilition difficult to accomplish. The other modes in frequent Uoi', of observing at difforent azirnut11s, fails in part, in high magnetic latiilude, where only a small range of the circnmfcreucc of' the }Jivots lx:comes availaLle, Gince all dips so ob:иe1иvec1 must be bctwcell the trui' dip a]](l 0o:i. In the report on the magnetic ~urwиy of the Britisl1 islanils, 1839, ~Iajor SABINE states that some needles were used, in whicl1 tl1c axle, instead of hcing perma11ent1y fixed to the neeillc, was Bccured in its place merely hy strong friction, and could h(; taken out, tnnwd a portion of a circle on its own centre of rotation, and rcplacecl, 1lms enabling the points of the eircumforencc of tl1e axle, in contact with the supporting planes, to be varied in auccessive trial2. The plan seems to have worked wdl, but appears not to have been subsequently used. \Vhethcr this was owing to tl1c more perfect figure aftcrwanh given to tl1c pivots of ordinary needles, by Gambey and Darrow, or to some defoct in the construction of tlic revolving axles, is not uuilerstood. That principle of construction has, l1owcvcr, lately liecn revived, in, p<'rhaps, a somewhat novel form, by Assistant J. E. Hilgard, and has been successfully executed by :J\fr. Wm. \<Viirdemann, on needles Nos. 1 and 3 of the dip circle Ko. 10. The axle admitR of being turned ahont itself (without being rcmovcil) in tlie brass collar or arbor, by meauf' of which it is attachcil to the needle. In this manner the needle may be mnde to rest on any portion of tlw ])ivot~, and by means of au index on the square shoulder, by which the axle is turned, and a graduation on tl1c braRs collar, observations may be made in symmetrically arranged positions of the pivots. The axles fit elosely into these arbors, and turn smoothly, yet with very sufficient friction. In the pair of nc(,dles fir~t furnisl1C"d with tl1ese axles, the pivots arc not perfectly concentric with the axles, as is appmcnt from the suLjoined observations; but tl1at defect should disappear for each position in the nW"an or the revC'rsals. 'The positions markecl O upon O are those in which the balance of the needles was adjusted.

The above observations are so arranged, that ju each position we liave two results virtually deared of collimation, balance, and index errors, the circle having been reversed, as well as the needle inverted, for each state of polarity. These separate results are brought out in the column of "crossed means." "'e 8ee, in fact, in general, a very close agreement of the two values, while, in a few case;<, tl1crc is a considerable difference. This is, doubtless, to be looked upon as arising from some accidental cause, as the attachment of some mote to the needle, and indicates that these observations ought to be repeated. On ea.eh day the observations were made in three positions of the axle, and the mean, therefore, depends

upou twelve different portions of the cylindrical surfaces of the pivots. The individual results show wider differences than we should have looked for, and we believe that a more perfectly cylindrical figure of pivots can be attained. The close agrepment of the means by both needles, nevertheless, points to a compensation of errors, and in~pires confidence in the result.

APPE:NDIX No. 24.
NOTICE OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES ON THE WESTERN COAST OF THE UN'ITED STATES, ON THE 23d AND 25th DECEMBEll, 1854. [Communicated to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, by .A. D. Bache, S11pcrintendcnt, under authority of the Treasury Department.]

In February, 1855, I received from Lieut. W. P. '.rrowbridge, of the Corps of Engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey, in charge of the tidal observation on the Pacific coast, a letter calling my attention to the singular curvel-l traced by t11e Relf-registering tidio-gaugc at San Diego, on the 23rl and 25th of DPeernber, and remarking that the irregularities of the curve could not be produced by disturbances from storms, as the meteorological records for the whole coast showed a continuance at that time of an ordinary state of weather, and the length of the wave was too great to be explained by such action. "There is every reason to presume (he continues) that the effect was caused by a sub-marine earthquake." No shock, however, has been felt at San Francisco. "\Vhen the record sheet of the self-registering gauge at San Francisco was received, similar irregularities in the curves for the same days were found upon it. The sheet for Astoria presented little or no special irregularity. '.rhese were the only self-registering gauges actually in operation at this time. Waves of short period would, of course, escape detection by the ordinary hourly or half-hourly observations. About the 20th of June, we received accounts from Japan of a violent earthquake on the 23d of December, the notice of which was more circumstantial than usual, from the damage to ihe Russian frigate Diana, in the port of Simoda, on the island of Niphon, from the excessive and rapid rise and fall of the water. A detailed account of the phenomena of this earthquake, and of the rise and fall of the sea produced by it in different places on the coasts of the Pacific, is much to be desired, and I have thought that by the publication of the results obtained by the Coast Survey, the publication of official reports of the phenomena might be induced. Perhaps even similar observations may have been made, and these iиegisters of the selfacting tide-gauge will show what observations it is desirable to have for comparison. 'l'hus far we are left to the public 1irintR for the information obtained,* and the different accounts are quite discrepant where they give details, and are usually, as intended merely for general information, too vague in the statements to give satisfactory means of comparison. A corresponjlcnt of the New York Herald, writing from Shanghae, gives the following notes, stated to be derived from an officeT of the frigate Diana: "At 9 a. m. on the 23d of December, weather clear, thermometer 720, barometer 300, a severe shock of an earthquake was felt on board the frigate, shaking the ship most severely. This shock lasted fnll five minutes, and was followed at quick intervals by rapid and severe shocks for thirty minutes."
o Since reading this paper I have rnceiveu, through the kindness of Commodore M. C. Perry, a copy of a letter from Capt.a.in H . .A. A.dams, U. S. N., who visited Japan in the steamer Powhatan, to exchange ratifications of the tre&ty between Japan and the United States. Captuin Adams says: "Simvda has suffered dreadfully since your visit there. On the 23d of December there were several shocks of earthquake. The sea rose in a. wave live fathoms above Ue usual height, overflowing the town and carrying houses and temples before it in its retreat. When it fell, it lef~ but four feet of water in the harbor. It rose and sunk this way five or six times, covering the shores of the bay with the wrecks of boats, junks, an<l buildings. Only sixteen houses were Jen standing in the whole place. The entire coaat of .Japan seems to have suffered by this calamity. Yedo itself was injured, and the fine city of Osaka entirely destroyed." Captain Adams then gives an account of the disaster t<i the RUl!8ian frigate Diana, .A.dmira.l Pontiatine commanding, which was so injured in the harbor of Slmoda as to lead finally to her entire loss.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

"At 9.30 a. m. the sea was observed washing into the bay in one immense wave, thii-ty feet high, иwith awful velocity; in an instant the town of Simoda was overwhelmed, and swept from its foundations." ii и ii ii "This advance and recession of the water occurred five times. и и * By._21t. 30m. p. mи all was quiet." A communication in the l'amc paper, purporting to give an f~xtract from the log-book of the. :Diana, states that" At a quarter past nine, without any pTeviouR indication, the shock of an eartl1quakP, which lasted two or three minutes, causing the vessel to shake HTY much, was felt both on deck and in the cabin; at ten o'clock a laTge wave was observed entering the bay. и * ii и The 1иising and falling of the water were very great, the depth varying from less than eight to more than forty foet ; and these changes, at intervals o about five minutes, continuecl nutil noon. * "' и "' и Sc11reely had half an honr elapsed when the rising and falling of the water became more violent than before. Between this time and a quarter past two (when the agitation again became much less) the frigate was left four times on her sicle, and once while thus, laid in only four feet of water." "Continuing to decrease in violence and frequency, by three p. m. the agitation of the waier, and the motion of the vessel consequent thereon, were very slow. "' "' * * At this time a fresh wen wind was blowing, the barometer stood at 29.87, and the thermometer was 10.50 degree~ U., (about 55.63 degrees F.") The official report of the disaster to tl1e frigate will prolmbly contain further and more precise particulars of the phenomena. Mr. P. -VY. Graves gives in the Polynutian a notice, for wl1ich I am indebted to Mr. l\Icriam, of an extraordinary rise and fall of the waters at Peel's island, one of the Bonin islands, on the 23d of DPeemberи The first Tise noticed was fifteen feet above l1igh water, followed by a fall which left the red"s entirely bare. The hour when this occurred is not stated. " The tide continued to rise and fall duri11g the day at intervals of fifteen minutes, gradually lessening until the evening." At Peel's island the waters rose, on the evening of tlie 25th of December, to the heigl1t of twelve feet I have not, however, seen any notice of an emthquakc on tlmt day. I present to the association a copy of the curves traced by the self-registering gauges at the CoaBt Survey tidal stations at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astmia, on thf' 23d and 25th of December, 1854, (Plate No. 50.) The curves, representing tides of slrnrt period, being traced upon the falling or ri8ing curve of the iиegular tide, their peculiarities are not so readily seen as when shown in the seeoml diagram, (l1latc -So. 50,) where the regnlar tidal curve iR rf'present.ed as a horizontal line. The times of the San DiPgo cmve are iиeduced to San Francisco time. The curve at San Diego presents many minor irregularities, from the motion of the float not having been sufficiently checked to prevent the iиeeording of the waves caused by the wind. Upon a falling tide the crests of these waves will be met earlier, and the hollows later, than upon a horizontal surface, and the intervals from cTest to creRt, or from hollow to hollow, will be affected by the change of rate of fall. Upon a rising tide the reverse will occur. There can be no doubt that these extraonlinary rises and fall.i of the water at short intervals were produced by the same cause which determined the extraordinary rise and fall in the haiиbor of Sirnoda, ~n .Japan, and at Peel's island. The San }'rancisco curve presents three sets of waves of short interval. The first begins about 4h. 12m., and ends at 8h. 52m., the interval being 4k. 40m. The second begi111< at about 9lt. 35m., and ends at 13h. 45m., the interval being 471. lOm. The beginning of the third is about 13ih., arid its end is not distinctly traceable. The crest of the first large wave of the three sets occurred at the respective times of 4h. 42m., 9lt. 54m., and 14h. 17m .. giving intervals of 5h. l2m. and 41t. 23m. The average time of oscillation of one of the first set of waves was 35m., one of the second 3lm., and of one of the third about the same. The average height of tlie first set of waves was .45 of a foot on a tide which fell two feet, of the second .19 of a foot. ou a tide whicl1 rose three feet, of the third somewliat less than .10 of a foot on a tide which fell some seven feet. 'The phenomena occurred on a day wl1en the dinrnal inequality of the tide was very considerable. The great.est fall of the tide dnring the occurrииuce of the first set of waves was .70 of a foot, and the corresponding rise .60 of a foot. In the second the corresponding quantities were .30 of a foot, and in the third .20 of a foot. Tlie8e waves would not have attracted general attention.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

There is a general analogy in the sequence of the waves of the three sets which seems to mark them as helouging to a recunPnef' of the same series of phenomena. In the Diagram No. 3 A, (Plate X o. ;;o,) the heights of the rneccssive waves of the first set at San :Francisco arc shown by the dots joined by full lines, and of the second by those joined by the fine dotted line. The fu11 faint linc"1 show the heights of the first series at San Diego, and the broken faint lines the heights of the sccoucl. The heights in huudret1ths of a foot are marked at the side of the diagrurn, and those of the successive waves are placcll at regular intcrvalB, the waves being numbered from 0 to 7 at the top of the diagram. The height is the mean of the' fall from a crest to a hollow, and of the succeeding Tise from the same hollow t<l the next crest. The timer< of oscillation from one crc10t to the next succeeding arc placed on the same diagram, the times beiug иwritten at the right hand, alHl the wave being designated at the lower part of the Diagram No. 3 B, Plate Nu. liO. The foll liuc represents the times of the firnt series at San Francisco, and the broken line the times of tlw second. The foll and broken faint lines n~prescnt the times of the first and second seriea at San l>iego. The intervals between the timH of occurrence of the crests of the successive иwaYes in theи first and second ~nies dimini~h from 51t. lOm. to 41i. 48m. by irrcguhr diffuc)1ces. The effect of th{' risi11g or falling tide, upon whic.-h these waves occm, is, of course', greater in disturbing the heights than the times. The series itself looks like the result of several impulses, not of a single one, the heights rapidly increasing to tl1c thirll wave, then dimini~hing as if the impulse had ceased; then renewed, then ceasing, Icavi11g the oecillation to extingui~h itself. If we had a good scientific report of the facts as tllcy occurTcd at Simoda, the suldect would lose the conjectura1 clmracter which must otherwise bdong to it. Although we have no account of the place where the earthrp1ake bad its origin, the Yiolence of it~ effects in Japan, and the diminished effects at Peel's island, show that Japan was certainly not far from the seat of action. Five successive waves of considerable height m-e spoken of as having occurred at Simoda, while by the gauge we trace eight, of which seven arc of considerable height. The highest wave at Simoda was estimated at tl1irty feet, at Peel's island at fifteen fcиet. At San Francisco it was .6[) foot, and at Sau Diego in the first series .50 foot. At San Diego, the same three i:'Cries of waves arc distinctly shown. The first begins 171,. 22ni. later than at 8an Franci~co, correction having been made for the difforcnce of longitmk, and ends Oli,. 52m. later. '!'he inte1Tal is 30m. less tlmn at San l!'rnnci~cn, tl1e 0Rcillatim1 1J.,ii1g rather shorter than at the last named iioint. The second begin~ 011. [J4m. late1и than at San l!'ranciseo, and ends 34ni. later. The third begins about .54m. later tlmn at San l!'mncisco. 'l'hc average time of oecillation of the first set of waves is 31m., and of the secoml 29m., being re8pcctivcly 4m. and 2rn. le8s than of the correspomling series at San Francisco. The average height of the first waves was .17 foot lower than at San Francisco, and the second as muc11 higher. This fact, taken with the diflercnce in the times of oscillation, leads me to suppose the difference in tl1c two series due to interference, which is also suggested by tlw position of San Diego, in reference to the islands sq>arating the Santa Barbara sound from the ocean. 'l'l1e general arrn1ogy in tl1e succession of heights of the mean of the two series, as shown in Diagmm No. 3 C, and in the timcH as showu in D, of the same diagram, is very satisfactory. The difference in the veriods of tl1e tide at which the waves occuned would tend to cause discrepancies. The first >'eries occurrca on a risiug tide of four feet, while at San Francisco it WM upon a falling tide of two fePt. 'l'IH' second lwgan near l1igh water, and was chiefly upon a falling tide of seven feet, while at San Franci~co it wflR upon a rising tide of four feet. . The forms of some of the indivitlual wa\и1\b iu the second series at San }"'rancisco and San Diego accord remarkably, as tl1or>c marked 1, 3, 4, .5, and 6, when reduced to the horizontal line. 'I'hc comparison on the cuTve where the distortion remain!!, i,i also very instructive. The waYeB marked 1, 4, 6, and 7, are not unlike in the first and second set~ at San Diego. The observations at Snn Diego confirm, then, in general, the inferences 1kiived from those at San Francisco. 'l'he register nt Astoria throws no new light upon the subject. The bar at the entrance of the Columbia river would CXIJ!ain wl1y tl1e oscillations were lost or greatly reduced at Astoria, even if they arrived off the. entrance of the river. The disturLancc is marked on the rngister, but in an irregular and confused manner. It was also, apparently, p~~~d by unusual oscillations of the water. After allowing for'the very~ action of the float of the San Diego gauge, there appear to have been

No special effect appear8 to have been produced upon the time or heigltt of l1igh or low water by th<J earthquake, which mercly caused seriei:l of oscillations upon tlic great tidal wave.

The distance from San Diego to Simoda, from theEc data, is 4,911 nautirnl miles; and from Sau Francii:oco to Simoda, 4,526 nautical miles. According to one account, the disturbance began at Sim0da at 9 a. m., or 23d llh. 44m. Greenwich mean time, and tl1e first great waYe half an hour after. The first disturbaucc at San :Francisco waB at 23d Oh. 22m., or 12k. 38m. after that at Simoda, and the first great wave at 23d 071. f52m., giving the same interval.* The distance and time from this account give for the rate of mntion of the wave 358 miles per hour, or 6.0 milee per minute. The second account would give for the time of transmisBion 1211. l lltn., and for tl1e rate of motion 370 miles per hour, or 6.2 miles per minute. The San Diego observations give for tl1e time of transmission of the wave from Simoda to San Diego l4h. Om. by the first account, and 13/,.. 45m. by the second account, which combined with the clistance, gi,иe 354 miles per hour for tl1c mean result, or, ~enRibly, the same r('sult as derived from the beginning at Sau Francisco. The first g;reat wave would give identi~ally the same rPrnlt. From the results obtained, we may determiue tl1e mean depth of the Pacific ocean in the i1ath of the eartlu1uake waves. 'Ve have fom1d for the rate of moti<>n from 6.0 to 6.2 mile:" i1er minute, and for the duration of au oscillation 35 minutes at San Francisco, aml 31 at San Diego. 'l'hi8 would give for the ]pngth of the wave on the San Francisco path 209 miles to 216 miles; and on tl1e San Diego path, 18:.l mile.i. A wave of 212 miles in length would moYe with a velocity of 6.1 miles per minute in a depth of 1,887 fathoms, (Airy, Tides and lVarcs, Encyc. l\fotrop., p. 291. Table II;) the second acc(lnnt would give a depth of 2,005 fathoms. The corresponding depth on thlи San Diego path is 1,8,13 fathoms. 'l'he disturbance of the 25th of December presentsи at San Francisco three F<etf' of waves of seven each, aud at San Diego one set of seven, agreeing in their general features with tl1ose at San Francioco; and then a set of seventeen, in which, at first, intermediate w11vcs seem to b<' wanting at San Francisco, or which haYe no analogous oscillations there.

amиpices, waR amply ju~tified hy the fad tlwt tne иFlorida reef is the great American danger to navigation. One of the bP1<f aid8 in avoiding rrcf risks is n dear i11sight into the structure of tlie reefa and keys, and this can ouly n''ult from scic11tiiic re~ean!H,s, aided by the Ooa~t Survf'y ddailr~il l1ydrography, now well advanced. The millions of property wrecked on the reef arc in great part sacrificed to a needless ignorance of hydrogra11hy, reef structure, currents, winds, and even lights and beacons. Itcef pilots are not employed, and shipmaster8 are so poorly supplied with precise knowled~e of the kind needetl for insuring snfo navigation amid these dangers, that many Wrf'ck6 reRult solely from their ignorance. Dnring the five seasons (1857-'62) in which I was charged with the construction of Fort Taylor, at Key "\Vest, I had good opportnnitieB for knowing the hi~tory of the wrceks, occurring about at the avernge rate of one a week. I am now of the opiniou tlrnt the lo~K of propf'rty in \\TeckA, wl1ich wnul<l he i1reve11t11ble by such accuratr, knnwfodgP ns can be fumbhed to navigators wl1en the Coast Surn'Y sliall have irnliliehed the complete reef hydrography, and its full scientific di~cus~ions of reef etructm(и, ti<lPP, currents, and wi11Js, has regularly exceeded the annual expense of thlи rиntire surnиy. Many ohipma~ters iue incorrigibly ignorant, and several \l'l'ecks have, to my knowledge, occurr('<l by maskrn not kuowing new lights which liar1 bl'en for many months conspicuously advcrti~ed in all the cmtom-lrnupes and in commercial papers. Should shi11ping rnerdiants insist on having none hut intelligent captains, and then furnish thPm with tLe very best information concerning tlw reef neigbborhooa, a largp portion of the wrecks would be prcvente<l. I think the ~tuay of currents, and csprcialJy of airrent i:ariati.ons, in and nrnr tl1e Flmida channel, is now peculiarly needed for preventing "lHecks in this 1иegion. Tlw fluctuations of currents from their rnpposed normal type, certainly cause numerous disasters. The lack of distinct ideas a8 to the relatious between the reef and the keys, and igumance of the manifrst signs of proximity to tlie reef; are the real causes of many disasters. The Coast SurvC'y has <lone Eo much to disarm the reef of its terrors and to make known its true character, that, aside from my own connexion with the Coast Survey organization, it seems appropriate for me to present to you some Yiews on the o~igin, growth, rnbstrncture, mid chronology of the reef, which have resхlted from my obsc1-vatious wbihи at I~ort Taylor, ai1d which may prove a needful supplement to Prof. Agassiz's rnport. The grand curve of our AtlaiHic coast terminates in tl1e remarkable crc8cent of keys and rcefa which bPgi11s some miles 11orth of Ca1ie Floricln, and extends in a well-defined curve some two hundred and forty statute miles to Turtugas lrnuk. At Cape Florida its axis is north and south. In moving down the reef this direction revohces with tlw snn, until at 'l'ortngas it bears about 5░ N. of \V. This crescent consists of a line of lrnyP :rnd a paralld outer liue of reds which are separated on an average between five and six miles by a m1viga lJle d11111nel ob8tructeil by coral bead:i. The reef terminates about opposite tlrn Marquesas, some fifty miles cast of Tortugas bank. Between the line of keys and the mainland of }'lorida is a body of shoal water, shaped much like a cornucopia, which embraces Key Biscayne bay, Card's sound, Barnes's sound, and the bay of Florida. The lirn~ from Tortugns to Cape Romano, which may be taken as the mouth of this cornucopia, is one hundred and twenty miles long, the deepest water on it being twenty fathoms, and all within or cast of it lwing ::<till "hoah~r and characte1иized Ly singnlar ei-ermcEs of bottom. The straits of }'loricla, between the reef and the Cuban coast, are about a lrnndred miles wi<le, and the bottom slopes from the reef down to eight hundred fathom~. jn"t off the submc1иgcd cliffs of Culia. 'The one hundred fathom curve of the bottom is about seven mill's out from Cape :J<'loridu, and from thence to Tortugas it gradually separates further from the klиys, being there over twenty miles out. 'l'he wellиtraced curve along w l1iclt this grand Ji'lorida bank thrusts itself out into the deep water of the . Gulf, is strikingly significant of Rome contiuuous and regular ageucy in its production. 'l'he adjacent flow of the Gulf Stream would, rnost. naturally, be nBsumto to govern in some way the production of this curve. It, hO\\"OYPr, runs ill the wroug <1i1Tction to H:rve tlii~ l'X planatory use, and it is, in fact, rarely found to run close in u1w11 the reef. There i,, however, an eddy counter current, intermittivg in cl1aracter and of variable rate; but, on the whole, a positive aud prevailing current.и At Cape FlOl'ida it is narrow and precarious; but it widens as it swlиeps to tJ1., west"иard, occasionally becoming over ten miles wide at Key "\Vest, and twenty miles off Tortngas. It ;;ometimcs rnns over two knotR, and is a great help to ves8els bound west. when their masters know the reef well enough to venturn so near. There is much need of more precise observationti to make out the clrnrncteri~tics of this current; hut its existence and its intermitting and sometimes powerful set areи facts att!'~tcd by all who know these waters thoroughly.

After careful consiJeration, I am led to a8cribe the peculiar sl1aping and growth of the Florida bank, including tlie keys, iиeefs, and r<ubstrncture, mainly to the sweeps of thi~ eddy counter current. Darwin, Dana, and Agassiz, lmv!' so fully sta1ed the zooloi!'i1иal :md 01l1<иr orilinary d"m1и11t" of n:Pf arn1 k<'y i!'rowth, that l need only refer to their \Yorks for ddaib.* f'p1иcial circnmstancPs, lrnwcYPr, so far modify the structure of tlw Florida reef that it fa not fully embraced in the priucipl('S laid down by the~c writers. It is not an atoll, a fringing reef, or a lmrrier reef, in the accq1ted s~~u~cи of the"e dcsig1rntio11<0; lmt it fo a reef, or bank, sl10oting out independently by its eud into the deqi Gulf' wat<:ri'. Such, at least, i~ tl1e Yicw to which I have been led by simply considering the existing agencies as actually working. The reef proper is the main field of coral grnwtl1. This growth is not in one compact mass, but in diversified coral ht'!ads, or detached masses. 'l'he bolcl slo]1C of the reef, towards the Gulf Stream, to the proper depth of t,rrowing coral, wliich here docs not exceed a hundred feet, and the broad top surface of the reef Rectinn are teeming with wli<l coralR and ~lll'll:<. The brane11ing eornh grow whrиrevPr the violence of the sea Joes not prohibit, and where moving sand does not forbid a secure foundation for coral colonies. In general, wherevcer there are solid smfaces frl'e from sand and weed, and which are wai'hed by warm moving salt water, the coral eggs, diffused tlirnughout the reef waters, attacl1 tl1emsdn:s and grow to the limit of their capacity. Thus, the stones of the Fort Taylor breakwater and foundation~, palmetto 11iles, iron bars lost overboard, &c., have become coated with branching and solid corals, "иhose growth, between the date of immersionи and that of diving up, gi,-e a me11sure of coral increase. Throughout the sand-covered bottom, between the reefs and keys, along the sand-faced south beach slope, towards the reef, and over the mud botiom nortl1 of the keys, there are no living corals, except on such accidental bases 11s may occur, 11nd in the coral heads which have grown upon these bases. Thus, com! masses are mainly produced where the action of storms is most violent, and thl'y are constantly giving way before the assaults of the wanos and the corrosions of the numerous and active boring 8hclls. A coral maes, once broken loose, undergoes active attrition and disinlt:grn.tion into calcareous :sand of varying fineness. This sarnl and the accompanying detritus of E<hells and 'echinoderms which abounc1 intermixed witl1 the liYing coral, arc, by dcgrePs borne on by the waYcs towards the south beaches of the keys, where some of the sand is thrown u11on the slope of the beach ridge. A coral mas1<, or shell once cast loose is killed, and i.~ henceforth untiringly triturated by the waYes until it escapes their action, or is reduced to irnpal1mlile 11mnler. Evc1иy wave agitation of sand pulverizes it yet further, and brings it nearer to the consistency of the white mud which so largely prevails on the bank towards its northern side. There is, thus, a constant coral and shell growth, and a8 constant disintegration in progrc-ss. All tl1is action, however, takes place in the limited range of depth of less than a hundred feet, within which only can the reef-lmilding coral grow. To account for the vast underlying mass between this limit of depth and the deep original sea-floor, is a problem hitherto unsolved, and one which I hope to elucidate. The tidal currents set strongly across the reef, and through the channels, between the kt:ys, the flood running to the nortl1 anil the ebb to the south side of the key crescent. "\\'hen storms occnr th.c agitation (lf the wavP.s extends to the bottom over the shallower portions of t11e grand bank and stirs np the sand violently, 'l'his causes the water to take up and maintain in mechanical suspension such finely comminuted p:irticlcs as have too little sinking force, rapidly to reach the bottom again. '!'he finer the particles the longer will they remain ms pended" and the very coarse grain" will hardly be lifted from the bottom. Between the coarsest and finest are grains of all intermediate sizes, and whether they will be suspended, o:r Uflt, depends on the violence of tl1e storm, and their interval of suspension varies wit11 their size and the violence of tl1e waves. It results that,11& all storms of much violence, the water over the :Florida bank becomes white with the bottom и deposits. In long and severe northers or gales, the water becomes almost milk white across the whole hank. This "white water'' is a familiar appearance, and is one of the sure signs of proximity to the reef. As storms subside the white sand mud is gradually thrown down, and the water clears, after a day or two, to its peculiarly delicate transparency. During the "white water" periods the flood tidal currents set the white water over the north side of the bank into the bay of Florida, where, by reaEon of the greater depth, the process of deposition goes on, and thus the floor of tbis hay has become covered with white mud, and has been brought up with a singular

The entire lack of any bottoms, in the slightl'st dPgrcc tinctured with }Ii~"issippi mud, is a pcrfoct refutation of the viC'w presc11tm1 by Prof. Jos. Le Conte,* that the substructure of tl1e rt'ef, up to the depth where coral growth can begin, is a result of the deposition of llississippi sediment, carried across the Gulf by the Gulf cunent. I venture the assertion tliat thesr' liot.loms arc inconsistent with any Yiew which docs not derive them from the living coral to the cast of their present localities. Should it be said that these bottoms only indicate the mere surface character of the sea lied, it m:ay be replied that the great mass of the Lank substructure, shooting out to the west into the Gulf, and rising above the Gulf bottom on both side~, as is am11ly Rl1own by the HJ, 20, and 100 fathom cu1-ves around the west encl of the bank, is unmistakably a special formation rnbsPquent to the general shaping of the Gulf bed. The actual causes nnw at work in producing coral or shell materiul, and in grindiug and tran~portiug it, must necessarily result in a building up from tlw bottom along the line of the eddy cunent to the westward. Combine with thi8 tlie fact, that the moE<t effoctivro wimh aud wavros, botl1 nf trade nm] hurricane origin, come in upon the reef from the soutlieast, and must, tlierefore, help to transport detritus to the westward and northwest. :Moreover, the heavy waves which wear the front focc of the reef must work down along the rnuth 8lope some of the cletritus, and must thus aid in fo1иming the actual double slope in which the bottom expands towarcls tlie Cuban cliff coat<t. It is unlikely tl1at t11e waveиactions extend with appreciable effect lwlow, from fifty to a hundred feet, and detritus, once 1ilaced below their extreme range, becomes permanently fixed. h is to be observed that the ve1иy zone of coral growth is that of wave agitation, and that thiR must prC'Vl'nt the lodgment of sand and mud on the growing coral, as, after storms, the swell will always last here until the waters are cleared of white mud. This may, perhaps, be quite as effective a cause as increased inиcsRm<', in limiting the deptl1 of coral growth to about the same range as that of wave actions . .A careful consideration of such facts as are now asce1tained, leads me to the supposition that the growth of th~ line of keys and th~ line of reefii is simultaneous by their western cxtremitimi. Th!ifreef now ends и opposit<' tlw Marque!!as, while tl1e quicksands, Rebecca and L!a.ae ahaals. the Tortugas keys allil the Tortugas Lank, indicate tl1<' extension of the line of keys beyond the line of reefs to the west. It is remarkable that the Tortugas kcиys arc entfrely without the soli<lificatiun so prominent at Key West. Fort Jefferson, resting wholly on sand foundations has settled in all it~ circuit, nnd in some portions it has gone down nearly a foot, showing that a deep sand bed has yielded thus much to compression. In tlie slieltered waters among these keys, there is an active growth of branching corals, &c., on sand foundations, which arc torn up by storms, and tossed on the beacl1es by the waves to such an extent as to afford the vast mass of concrete materials used in the masonry of Fort Jefferson. There are, however, no extended rock masRes, and the fierce vitality of the comls is shown in an active renewal of growth on dead co1иal sprigs. It is my impression that the mass of materials forming the Tortugas keys and bank bas been

That tl1e finely comminuted white mud or mud solidifies into oolite on Key lY est, is, I think, fully slio"иn by the fossil traces of a peculiar YcgetaL];, scum which forms in the lagoon;;. 'l'hi,; scum, as the lagoon~ dry up, forms a leathery sheet, which is, Ly drying, split into piecPR, which roll up at the edg.,H, :<oml'tinw,.: with thn,c or four turns.

Whether n cnJcarcous rnnd heap, wholly nbnvc the water, can "nlidi(y into :rn oolit.e, if' a qncstion hard to answer; but it is only by such agency that I can Pxplain tlw solid mound of nearly a mik in di.imeter, whicl1 forrn8 the wei;t part of Key vV est, and iH whnlly eorn1wRed of oolitc. 'I'hP summit of this mound is about fifteen foC't above high water, and is belienиd to be the higl1cst point 011 the whole line of keys. Tho gale of 184G raised the water to within seven feet of the a11ex, and we can rmdily conc<иiye th:Lt, before tlw reef lmrrier protectt,d it, a lrnrricane might have carried up sancl to over fift~en feet above orilinary high water. The oolite, as shown in the wells of Key WeФt, becomes coarf'Pr grained mu1 soft0r in t'l<'scending-. It is so open that the water level of the 'Yells, even in the heart of tlw key, or Jialf a mile from the sea, fJuctnates with the tides, following them at internils, varying n,rcnrrling to position; lmt. av<иrnging, m; nParly a:' I could ascertain, about three hours. The whole rocky mass of Kt>y 'Vest is of this oolite, tlwre being on the weathered rnrfi1c0s, and occasionally in thP mass, a yellowish brown crust, liard enougJ1 to receive a poliHh, all(l wmally ks~ than a quarter of an inch thick. Tl](' granite foundations of :Fort 'l'aylor, located 1n water of eleven fo<'t., or hи<'~, were laid wholly on rock which was dressed to form the U(иds by tlie use of a diving bell. The suL1rnnine rock thus examined was mucl1 like the shore rock, cxcqit that the muterialR were coar~p1и, rather less compact, and more brecciated. Occasional shell and coral brecci11ted mosses arc found on e!torc, Lut. sud1 trncPs are quite rare. In removing the beach S;tnd ridge which skirted the who!" ~011tl1 shore, I found a. limited stratum of about six inches t11iek and a fow rods long, composed wholly of imperfoetly comrninuted J>ieces of !'mall branching corals, averaging about an inch long aud a third of an inch thiek. Otl1cn.visc, tbis w110lc ri<lge of about ninety feet wide, and from five to eight feet. thick above high water, was composed wholly of sand, much of which was somewhat blackened by vegetable loam from the ridge sand growth. It is observable that this calcareous sand is scarcely at all blown about Ly the winds. Once packed, it resists the blasts of northers and hurricanes so completely, tlrnt at a fow feet from the reverse slope of the beach ridge, we find only marl and rock. It pre8cnts a marked contrmиt in this point, with siliciou8 Lmch 8ands, which may, as in I~rovincetown, Cape Cod, build up hill;; of a hundred feet high, or be carried for miles in the interior. When dry, and freshly turned up, it Llows freely; hut it seems never to be moverl Ly winds from the pl11ce where the sea deposited it. It is obvious that tlie sea is wasltiug away the rock along the south side of Key 'V\Test, while the north mud slope is being augmented. Several hunrlred fo1иt of tlie original south beach rock have probably been cut away. I am indebted to Mr. Clias. Howe, now collector at Key West, for some accou11t of an artesian wdl, which, in 1839-'40, he sunk to a total depth of one hundred and tliirty feet, on Indian kP,')', about eighty miles 1101иtheast of Key West.

there began to be unsound, tl1e drill occasiona1Iy going down three or four feet at once. At forty-five feet a gravel bed of about five feet wa~ found, below 'd1ich tlie rnck l1Pcarne harder, ancl continued very solid, with a few interruptions of nnsomHlncss, to ninety-one feet, when another gravel bed of several feet was struck, whicl~ gave much trouble. l1elow thi~ the roek became exceedingly hmиcl, and wa~ "tinged with yellow specks." This continued to ornи lnm<lred am1 thirty feet, with 8everal interruptions, by "breaking through," the drill once going down five feet at on<и jump. 'l'he water injede<l to dear the lwle brought up pieces the size of pigeon cgg"; hut, unfortunately, tl1e specimens arc now lost. l SUJipMe, from ~h-. Howe'~ verbal account that all this rock was purely calcareous, and that the very bard variety, which was taken to be quartz, was a compact limestone, sud1 as Dana frequemly found in the l'ncific coral formations. 'l'he unsoundness would seem to be due to the intcn-npted nature of coral beds, whether iиn situ, or formed of coral boulders and sand. In general, the actual atructure of the. reef rncms to result mainly from three grand activities. 1st. The ceaseless and persistent growth of cornl animals and she lb, on every appropriate site within their proper range of <leptl1, temperature, and water supply, wliicl1 growth, hy secretion, separates tlrn _carbonate of lime from the mass of the ocean and gulf water. 2d. The untiringи action of the winds, tides, and currcntf, (aide<l by horing shells,) in lirPaking up, trituratiug, trauspo1 ting, and depositing the calcareous protlucts of tlie zoological procese. 3d. Solidification by time, prcsrnre, segregation, and, possibly, by chemical transformation. It is a complex prol1lem to trace the pn'cise oreratiou of these agencie8 as now at work, and from the p1-e~ent to pass back over tl1e past, until that time when the Florida bank did not exist, and when the shore, from Cape Sable to Fort Dallas, was tlie open ocean front of south Florida. It seems, however, not too audacious to say, that ihe agencies now at work present a genernl type of operation wl1icli require8 but unlimited time to realize results no lesl' than the formation, not only of tlw line of keys and recfs, but of that immense substmctme which riReR from tlie great original plane of the gulf bed. This plane, along the Cuban coast, was over eight hundrc<l fathoms deep, audit could liardly liave been less than three hundre<l fathoms under the present Tortugas group. The evidence that South Florida and the base of the bank have recently urnforgone neither elevation nor depres~ion, to any considcrnblc extent, is quite convincing. Thern is a remarkable coincidence of general lcиvcl along t11e crescent of keys, and no reliable eYidence of vertical movement is found on any of them. Prat Tuomey fancied he saw evidence of elevation through several feet at Key Vaccas."' .Believing that he had mi~takcn boulders for masses in sБtu, I inquired of Assistant Hilgard, whose observations on the keys, during bis eurveying lubors, Lave been extensive, and he replied, that helms" never seen any coral beds rais(~d in situ above the water." He paid some attention to the subject, and remembers those at Key YaccaR, particularly, where he satisfied himself, by u8ing a crowbar, that they were boulder.s bedded in sand." l'rof. .Agassiz and Prof. Le Conte report the same impression. During the growth of' two lmn<lrecl and forty mile~ of k<'ys, there has been, then, no observable cl1ange of level. 'l'here is a dead fringing reef forming tlrn Punta, or weRtern angle of the entrance to Havana, which seems to have been elevated some six feet, and thiR is the only case of recPnt elevation in this vicinity with which I am acquainted. l'rof. Tuome and I>rof. Agassiz fully identify tlie formations at Fort Dallas with the rocks of the keys. 'l'l1e former rrиports tl1e deRceut from t1rn everglades, along the Miami river to title-water, at six to eigl1t feet,t and estimates the height of the ridge,_ where cut by the Miami, at twenty to thirty feet. Prof. Agassiz eRtimates the highest ~hore bluff in this 'иicinity as not above thirteen feet. 'l'he silicious sand which caps tlie bearh rirlge around to Cape Sable was probably transported by the waves down the eastern coast. There seems ample Teason ti) suppose that the crescent from Cape Sable, through the Mangrove swamp and Hunting Grournh, to Fort Dallas, and thence uorth along the coast ridge, is an older reef curve, and that the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee were the interior Hats, analogous to Key Biscayne bay, Barnes's sound, and the bay of Florida. The everglades, which cover about 4,000 square miles, have a substratum of coralline limestone of VP,ry rough and irregular surface, which is covered by sand, silicious in part, at least, and soft mud of from three to ten feet d;:;ep, which covers all but a few points of tl1e limestone, and is o-vergrow~ with rank sawgrass. The water overlying this mud is about three feet deep in dry seasons, and rises after rains from two to

three feet. Lake Okeechobee is but a deeper extemion of the Enrgladcs, itf' depth averaging about tweln fo<'t, mill its area bviug uenrly ] ,200 t<иprnn' milrиs. 'l'hrи ~light ehиrnti:m of the Evrrglaae region increaoef' gradually to the north, and the Kissimmee riYer, which ernptiPs in tl1e north margin of Lake Okev.cholwe, ba" n southPrly course of near a hundred miles, with a current of half a mile to three milPs. There fa thus n very gentle rise throughout the peninsula, and in the general slope sweeping the uorth margin of the Gulf and the south Atlantic. 'l'he exietenee of abundant coral f'o~t<ils in tl1e tertiary limestone Ftrnta of 200 to 300 feet thick, 8preading from the Mississippi river around to the Cape Fear river iu Xorth C:trolina, indicates an ancient coral or1gm. Prof. TuomPy was led by tl1ern evidences to a special examination of the Florida reef, from which he concluded that a continuous process of coral growth, through geologic ages, may lrnve produced this immense coral limestone area. Ile agrees with Mr. Conra(l in calliug the Tampa lime8tonel" tertiary. In all this space of limestone strata, there is no point whose altitude approaehes to <'quality with the dqith of near a mile, found off tlrn Cuban coast. The whole view of tliis suhject leaTes a strong imprc13sion that no great changes of level have occurred during the formation period, not only of the present crescent of reefa and keys, and the Cape Sahle and Fort Dallas .crf'>'t><иnt, bnt even in the ancient coral ages, which produced the,. north peninsula and the coral limestones of the great Gulf and Atlantic slope. Confirmatory eYidence is found in the Bal1amas, Salt ke~и, Cnbn, and Yucatan reefa, wliich have attained great expansion, with but slight evidence of disturbance. There arc nowhere indications of atoll formation by sinking; hut Darwin (AJlpcnc1ix, p. 18G) appeals only to l'krntion, and meet~ the fact of the Fingul:ir coincidence of level over many disconncckd lmnks of great area in the \Yest Indies, by suppo~ing that the elevated rnaePes of the Lanks were uniformly washed away l>y the sea d1aing their elevation. It is very evident that the remarkable evenne1<s of sotrndings over these hanks is a measure of the depth to whid1 the destroying action of the waves extemls in tlieir senиral localitiPs. 'l'he enormous accnmulatim1i- 011 the Florida side of the Gulf Strf'um make it quite rational to suppo!'e that Salt Key Lank, for instance, may have resulted from a single m1elcal peak, now worn away lly the sea, which lias affonlcиd a ba8is for tlll' growth of a fringing mef, and for a wasting action by the waves, whence an outward expansion may lrn,иe resultctl, which, in the course of ages, has accumulated the larger portion of the great trunc,'ltcd cone, now rising from near four hundred fathoms. To what extent tlw type of action which I have supposed instrumental in producing the Florida bank may be applied in the explanation of othl'r cases of corn] rcefo, I am not fl ualifi<'tl to decide. It can hardly be supposeu that snch acute au<l philosopl1ical mind~ as Darwiu'~ :wd Dann'~ 1rnuhl fail to perceive or give proper weight to this familar action of a1trition, transportation, and depositiи1n. Da11a is very explicit in stating it, and I must, therefo1иe, suppose that a satisfactory explanation of the ~rowth of the Pacific coral islands demand8 vCTtical movements unlike- any exhibited iu the \Yest lndics.

If the views presC'nted are eorrect, the cl1ronology of the reef becom<'s stnpl'ndous. Thl' most rapid instance of coral growth which I found on the breakwater and foundations of I<'ort Tay !or was a ;\Icandrina of about six inches nuliuR, whid1 was produc('il within twelve years; or the rnte wa;; a l111lf ineh iиer annum. Numerous specimens, derived from stones or piles, whose date~ of imm<'rsion were known, and whose surfaces were so rapidly coated by vegetation and corrallines that we can safely aesume the coral colonies to haYe been planted soon after immcrson, all indicate for the vicinity of Fort Taylor a general rate of growth le~s thau the above. There is no obvious reason why this rate should uot. lie ir1Pntica1 with that. on the reef proper, as the tidal currents supply ample moving waters, and the temperature io much the ;,ame.
Bearing in mind that the living reef belt hardly averages a mile in width, and that thiR is rnud1 interrupted, while the shoal part of the bank averages between fifteen and twenty miles broad, and that this is but a small part of the breadth of the base of this bank on the original bottom, uside from the marl and sancl, contributed to the bay of Florida, we are overwhelmed with tl1e immense demand for time. \Ye ongl1t iiot to suppose less than three hundred fathoms of detritus built upon an average. Moreover, much of this calcareous material is likely to have been more than once used by the coral animals, and some must have been swept into the ocean waters. Taking the !i'ving reef at one-twentieth the breadth of the total hank, the depth of the bank at iluec lm11dreil fathoms, and the rate of growth at half an inch per aunum, we find, aside from other elements of protraction, 864,000 years as the time for building the Lank, when consiclered in cross-:5ectio11. Cont'idcиri11g the growth as being by the west end from Cupe }<'lorida to Tortugas bank, a great increase of time i.i et.ill d<'m:mded, so that we can hardly on these data diminish the chrouology of the growth of tlw present }'lorida bank even to a million years. Appalling as tbis estimate of time for building appears, it seems impossihlc honestly

to reduce it. If to this be added t11c time coneumcd in building the Cape Sable and Fort Dallas crescent, arnl, again, the inconceivable periods demanded in the gl'Owth of the main peninsula, and the limestone strata of the grnwl slo1'e of the Gulf and South At.lantic, tlw imagi11ation j, appallctl, and can only rest on limitless infinities. "'\Y c can, indeed, readily make an arithmetical ~pproximation to thi::; iuconceivable total. The nature of coral reef~ limits the grnwi11g portion to the outer reef line, and it is a liberal a!lowance if' we ooupposc a zone of one mile bro11d, r('gularly covered with growing surfaces. The S()lidified masses derived from this zone, v. herever llepusited, cannot pos:iibly increase in the whole more rapiilly than thi5 zone can supply the materials. If we assume these ma6ses at two hundred and fifty teet thick on thi;ir northern margin in Alabama, arnl eighteen lrnndrcd foet thick on the present .southern boundary, we can safely as~umc an average thickness of nillf: lmnd1иC'c1 feet. The length of the general line of average cross-sections of the growing front cannot be less than two hundred am1 fifty to three huudred miles, or, at the minimum, a l10rizontal growth of two 1nmdnиd aud fifty tiuu:,; th<: growiug zuue can be assumed. Taking the rate as before, at twenty-four years to the foot, we shall ba;иe for the total time 24 X 250 X 900 on the data as stated; or, we find tl1e total period of 5,400,000 years as that required for the growth of the entire coral lirrnestonc foundation of .Florida. 'l'hP. rate of corn] growth is #lecessarily a rigid one, scarcely subject to fluctuation in auy suppornLlc pe1иioc1 of time, and the limitation of growth to an outer reef of narrow section i,. all<o a neccs~ity of organic habits. If, then, it lie a fact that all the limestone mass now considered is of coral origin, the time of corai growth Cllllll()t be rc<luccd below tl1e result given above. It is likely to be mucb greater, as all the element" liave been as:mmed on the side of a minimum chronology, and no allowance is made for growth by the west end, instead of by the front. The derivation of the substructurc of the bauk from coral growth makes the seemingly fonnidable dironology deduced hy Pro▒'.

This metre is of iron, and was one of the twelve original bars used in the construction of the staudard metre by comparison with the toise, which had served as unit of length in the meaRurenwnt of the meridional arcs in France and Peru. It posseses all the authenticity of any original metre extant, bearing not only the stamp of the committee, but also the original mark ( и: ) by which it was distiuguished from the othe1и bars during the operation of standarding. I~ is always designntcd as tl1e committee metre. A translation by Mr. Hassler of a paper by 'l'RA LLBS, detailing the process of construction, is to be found in House Doc.

In order to attain a greater degree of accurn<'y it wa8 proposed to eompar<> directly the l,.ngth of six single metres abutted together, wit.It the stanclanl bar, hy nwam nf tl1cи Saxton i1yrometer.

It may be essPntially rlf'scrilKиd as follows: \Yhile onc end of the rod to be compared rests against a fixecl abutting smface, tl1e other is in contact witl1 a Bliding picc0, urged against it by a spiral spring; a clelicatC' chain attacherl to the t'Ii<fo pm;ses around a small llmm on the axle of a mirror, mounted in pivots, which reflects into a tPlC>f'cope 11laced at a diHancP oppMite to it, the graduations of a long scale :placed immediately liclow tl1e telescope. :Any differencp in th(' 1Pngth of the rod C<lusc;;; n motion of the slide, which occasions a turning of the mirror, and a corre~poncling change of scale reading, in the ratio of the radius of the drum to twice the dietance of the scale from tlH' mirror. Thu~. if that diotancc i,; two hundred inches, and the effective radius of drnru and chain one-fifth of an inch, any change in the position of the slide will be reproduced two thousand fold on tlie scale. 'l'lw value of tlie scale divi6ions are determined by moving the slide by means of a micrometer screw, the value of which ha,; been accurately comp:m:d with the standard scale, and noting the corrct<ponding change of t<calc readings. In thP experiment~ next described the scale was so graduated that one division corricsponded to one twenty-five thousandth part of au inch in the length of the rnd. Four additional iron metres were made by Mr. Saxton of tI1e same figure as t11e committee metre, except that at the ends shoulders were cut, so as to present only a square of the thickness of the bar as abuttiug surfaces. These four bars, as well as the Lenoir metre, were compared with the committee metre Ly mean:; of the pyrometer, at temperatures ranging from 31░.8 to 52░.1, hy lifr. Saxton in December, 1862. .All the mctres being of iron, and having very nearly the same expansion, no differences depending upon tPmpcrnturc were apparent in the results. The observations, being combined in such a manner as to eliminate the chauge of temperature during the times of comparisons, give the following results in scale divisionR:

It if' :ipparent from an examination of the above results that the differences arc not owing to temperature, but t-0 t11e cl1anges in the order of arrangement. Taking the mean of the five sets, without regard to the number of observatiDn8 taken in each, иwe finc1 the standard 50.3и scale divisions shorter than tLe six metres, with a i1rnbable error of :!: 2 scale divisions ; anc\ using the values previ-0usly stated we have: Stnudard = 6 ~l\F - om.0000697 :l:: 0.0000021. '.rhe cxperim<?nts were made by l\Ir. Saxton, and discussed by Mr. Hilgard, under the immediate direction of the Su11erintendent. The wide range of the results of different combinations, far exceeding the uncertainties of the instntments of comparison, and of the probable irregularity of the abutting surfaces, is to be ascribed to tl1e insufficient meanR of seeuring the contacts, (by means ofa spring at the top of the Lars,) which would admit a slight shifting of the ends consequent upon the jarring to which the boxes mиc exposed in being lifted to and from tl1e positions in the comparing apparatus. It wa8 determim:d, therefore, to make still further comparisons, in which the contact of the six metres was !lecurcd by clarn1is, ns shown in fig. 1, plate 49. The clamping screws being of iron, no sensible difference in the strain could arise from changes of temperature. Two new metres, Nos. 5 and 6, with more highly finil:!bed square ends, like t11oec of tl1e first four ar1ditioual ones, were substituted for the committee and Lenoir metres. Tliieir comparison with the committee metre in 1859 and 1860 gives the following result, in scale divisions of the pyrometer, whicl~ si?cc 185.6, repre11en.t one :fifteen-thousandth part of 8<,ll inch: JSo.

In order to expedite the comparison~, Mr. Saxton contrived a rocking:frame (fig 2) as wpport for the boxes containing the bars, which peTinitted them to he alternately brought into the i1yronwter-li1w with great facility, hy being swung or rocked on the su11porting pointE hetwcen stops so adju~te<l aE to cccure at once the required position. 1'he experiments, which extemkd from January 18 to ?ifarch 28, 1860, Wfи1иe marlr- uml<иr th<и i1mmи<liat<' direction of Assistant J_ E_ Hilgard b;- '"и L 1\icholwn, esq., assif'ted lJy :'\Ir.

'l'he pro1ialilc crTor aiocrib<,J to it is but one t11irty _ thousanclth part of an inch, a11J we are safe in assumiug that it is not -actually in error by one ten-thousandth 1iart of an inch. This conclusion i~ folly borne out l1y other experiments about to lw <letaikd. That the standard is app1ue11tly louger than indicated by former experiments i;; .probably tlic re cult of the more effectual p1anner of making the contact of the six metnиs, aud SCC'uri11g the straightness and rigidity of the combined bar. In all tliese experiments the standard bar was in its own Lox, auJ in every respect precisely under the s:nne conditions as when used in c01nparisonf\ with thf' base apparatus. As it Lecame n<'CPssary from time to time to take the standard bar into the field for comparison with the base apparatus, a copy of the same was made in February, 1855, for preservation at tlie office. This copy, or ~tan<lard Ko. :?, iB in every respect similar to the original, ('XC('pt that it wa:< snbj0cted to a moderate process of an11eali11g, after being liarnnwrcd and JlLmcc1, to guard against any permanent change of ltngth from variations of tem1wrature; it-has therefore a lilnish color, wliile the origim1l is of the metallic color of iron . .At that time the two bars were both placed in the box of tltc copy, and clamped together at onc eml, rc~ting on the samP rnllere. On the I.5th of Fehrunry, ] 8fi5, fifteen eomparisons were thus obtained, agreeing WPll with Pach other, at temperatures rnnging from 34░.5 to 41░.4, which gave standard Ko. 1 shorter than ~ta11c1anl i'\ o. 2 Ly 0"1.0000323. 'l'lw olisenиations axe sufficiently accol'Clant, but as the bars were not entirely under the same conditions as whrn used with the base apparatus, it waE subsequently thought best to make furtlwr comparisons. Standaxd No, 2 was therefore eompmиr,d in Maxeh, 1858, with the six metres combined, in the same manner as above dtи~erib\иd. am1 subHeqncntlyиwith ~tandard No. 1, in April, 1860. The former compariF011 s, con~if'ting of eighteen sets, in three different arrangements of the single metres, ut n mean temperature of 85░.G, giYe: Standard No. 2 = I (1.2.3.4.5.6) - 10.4 div.:▒ 0.4 The cornparirnns of standard No. 2 with Ko. 1, comprising sixteen sets, each of six comparisons, made at dilforent times, but nt the comparatively high mean temperature of 48░.2, give: Stamla.rd No. 2 =Standard No. l 2G.6 div. ▒ 0.:35, which, combined with the aho\иe, give~ for the difforence between tlie standard No. 1 and the six metres joined 37.0 ;:calc divisions, while direct comparisons gave us 38.7.

StiJI, as there is a difference of 12и~ in the tempPratunи of the comparisons, a very slight variation in the exp:mи 11ion of the two bars would account for the difference, and it seems better for the present to adopt the results of the direct comparisons with the six metres, wl1ich give: Standard No. 1 = 6 I\1C - om.ooOO.'.i9:!9 ▒ om.ooooooss Standard No. 2 = 6 M" - om .00001767 :▒ 0 111.00000096

On thPse rna.rhlr~ ,;labs, alJOnt twenty foet apart., the two blocks for the support of tlw abutting screw and the mirror piece of the 11yromctcr were placed. Tlu-y were eigl1t inehef' high and twelve inchc,; "'l1Ull'C on the base, laid in a very thin layer of hyclrnnlic cement. The plates of the almtting screw and mirror piece were fastened by Ecrews to iilug;. of lcatl in the top of the stone block~. In order to control the tcrnpe1иatnre of tl1e bnr, and to measurn it by means of thermonwtcrs, it wns immersed in sperm oil, contained within a woockn box of ~even by eig11t indH'f in cro;o~-sPctinn, with its walls two inches thick, and heatecl or coolcиcl by means of hot or cold water circulating through iron pipesи disposed in the box as shown in fig. 0. The ~amc diagram i;hows the iиelativc positions of the 8tandarcl bar and the thermometers, whifo fig 5 cxhil1its tlw general arrangement of the nppnratnB. Thrи heating pipeR pass out at the side of the box, and are councch:cl lly piecPs of fkxi1ilrи tu lie~ with otl1cr pip<>~. well covered with felt, that pass into an adjoining room, whcr<' the water contained in them c:au lie hcatcиcl uy means of a row of gas-burners, or cooled by means of ice, or salt aml snow, in a tub, with whid1 tlwy eomrnunieatl'. Connected with the ~ystem of pipes is also a haucl pump, for promoting a Rtcady circuhtiou of the water. The connexion by flexible tubes prevents any strain on the box from expansion of thv pipe'" outRit1e, am1 the inside system of pipes is su8pended b:y swinging hooks, so as to movP freely under the influence of .temperature. All these precautions to inRnn' ;;t;1l1ility Wt're attcnderl with a very RlltiRfactmy result. As seen iu the plate, there were five' tlwrmometers inserted in thP top of the hox, with the stems am!

The contact betwecиn tlu' emh uf tl1e baT alld the pyronwter was effected by means of >'mall Bteel llistons, one-fifth of au inch in diameter nnd three inches long, slic1ing freely in a. packiug box. aB Feen in ii:.; 4.

This estimation is the lc11st satisfactory part of thPse experiments, ancl altl1011gh the uncertainty in the results arising from that cause is very small, y<'t it wa~ thought wdl to devirn a method by which it could le entirely removed. This consistf in r<'pcating thP PXp<'riment;: on tlw pi~tnns alone, iu contact with each other, in a sl1ort box, by whicl1 the actual efflиct upon their length of the changes of temperature of the oil would he aSC('rtained, and could lie clednctecl from tl1e observed effect upon bar aud pistons combined. The plans for these experiments were devised by Assistant Hilgard, and the obse1Tations were made undc>r his immediate direction by l\Ir. иw. L. Nicholson, assisted nt times by lieEsrs. J. It.

was found to require no c01Tection, and the fact being known that in its construction the uniformity of its calibre had lwen astиertainf'<l by micrometric measurement, it wai" adopted as the standard of compari::<on for the table of corrections to the five thermometers in oil. These corrections vary but about a fluartCT of a degree, and are the snmf' nt tlin extremes of the temperatures used; henee they liuve only a very slight influence on the rernlting rate of expansion. The coune of tl1e experiments was this: Afte1и reeonliug the indications of the mirror scrC\\', and the nine thermometers, five in the oil, two attad1et1 to piBt0118, and two on the stone blocks, the oil being at the natural temperatur<и of the npartment, the gas-burners were lighted under tlw pipe in the adjoining room, and t11e pump started. By this means t11e oil could he heatcrl about six1y dPgrc<'s in ten hour~, readings of the pyrometer and thermometen" being taken every half hour. After a high temperature of from 90░ to 100░ lrnd Leen reached, and maintaincil for some Lime, the apparatus was allowed to cool ~lowly, aud tlie readings were taken less frequently. \Vhen cooled down to the temperature of the room, about 46░, which rer1uired thirty-six hours, ice was introduced into tl1e tub, and the cold wateT cnused to circulat<' in thP pipes. ]twas found, however, tl1at the temperature could not be reduced below 39░ by thi>! means. On one iiight, therefore, ~larch 14, 15, the windows were open!'d to allow the whole space to cool, Ly which means the indication,; of the pyrometer were temporarily disturbed, vitiating the obsern1tions from 1.Harch 13th to 16th. Snow and salt were subsequently used for cooling the water, and a minimum of 34░ иwas thus reacl1Cd in the temperature of the oil. Upon the ob~crvations being graphically represented, it was seen that in the process of heating the thermometers went al1ead of the bar in tcrnpemture liy about half a degree in the maximum, while in the slow coolillg the mo~t perlecL correspondence was observed in hnth, witl1in the limits of the instrumental indications. The TeRults of the cooling only have, therefore, been made nsc of in deriving the rate of expansion. The use of tlie ascending series would not change the result, but would make it appear less certain than it really is. The diagram, fig. G, shows the several series of observatione:, from w l1ich the following results arc derived. Series A, B, C, D, .February 22 to February 25, expansion for 1 ░ Fahr ....... _ .. _ и. _ .. __ 24.54 :February 27 to llfarch 2, expansion for 1 ░ Fahr .. _ ............. _ .... 24.44 1\farch l 6 to l\farch 20, expansion for 1 c Fahr ............. - .. - .. _. - . 24.45 .Ap1иil 3 to April G, expansion for 1░ .Fahr. _ ................. _. _ .. _ -24.42 scale scale scale scale div. div. div. div.

In the mean we have for the expansion of the six-metre standartl bar for 1░ l'al1r. 24.46 scale divisions 0.00003846 metres, with a probable error of about ::!:: 0.00000010 metres from all somces. Hence the resulting co-efficient of expansion for 1░ Falu. is 0.00000641 ::!:: 0.00000002. In the computation of thP- foregoing results the following supposition has been made in regarrl to the tempcrntnre of the pistons : The average tcmpcratnre of the exposed fifth part of each pi:ston has been assumed tn lie the mean hetween the attached and external thermometers, and the average of the other four-fifths the mrnm of tbe attached and interior thermometers. This supposition may be elightly too low, but any other probable Rsrnmpr.ion would not sensibly vary tl1e above results. Thu:; it I1as been estimated that if we were assign to the pistons temperatures higl1cr by one-half the difference between the adopted ones, and those of the bar, a supposition certainly too higl1, the resulting change would be within tl1e pmbable error above assigned. The plan of measuring the expansion of the pistons indepenclcntly, above marked out, has as yet been only partially executed. It is designed to push it to the same degree of accuracy as the preceding experiments, in connexion with those on the expansion of standard No. 2, which still remain to be made. In order to show the stability of the apparatus, the mean readings in the scale in the several series have been reduced to the same temperature, with the following result:

showing an average variation of only 1.2 Acale divisions, or n-koo part of an inch, during six weeks, which may be conceived as representing an uncertainty of one-twentieth part of a degree of the thermometer in the temperature a~signed.

THE UNITED STATES COAST 8UHVEY.

In concluBion it may be stated. that from the experiments related, the length of the 1-!taudanl six-metre bar, at any temperature between 32░ and 100░, ean be assigned in terms of the committee metre, with an uncertainty of less than .sic ten-thousandth part of an inch, tl1e following being the valuef' : Standard bar= 6 l\IC - om.0000;;929, at 32░ },ahr. Co-efficient of expansion = 0.00000641 for each tlegree of .Fahr. It will be observed tl1at this rate of expansion is slightly lesf' than that mmally foum1 from cxpLиrimentA between 32u and 212░, which iil generally given as 0.0000067. It is posoiblc that such differences may be found in different pieces of iron, but the less value for the low r:rngc of temperature is quite consi~tent with the fact that the rate of expansion increasee with the temperature.

COMPARISON Ob, THE EFFECT OF
AT~iOSPHEHIC

MObTURE ON THE DDIENSIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF DllA\\'lNG PAPER.

In the Coast Survey report for 18Gl, the result of rnme cxpCTiments were giYen, showing tliat a new preparation of paper, called "parchment paper," rccommemled as a substitute for common drawing ]mpcr for maps, on account of its great ~trcngth and tlurnbility, i::; not pn;fcrable for that irnrposc, being greatly more affected in dimensions by atmospheric clmnges. New samples of parchment lrnper having been submitted, which were considered an improvement on the former, similar experiments were again ma(le, the details being attended to, as before, by ~lr. E. llergt'~hcimer, of the drawing divi8ion. The papers com1mrcd were common antiquarian drawing, thick r1arehment and thin parchment paper; each kind was cut into strips, lengthwise aud transversely, two nwtn'" in lellgth. The greatest change~ observed during six months are given in the following table:

It will be seen that the parchment papers cliange more than the backed dra.wing paper, under the same atmospheric influences, and unequally, while the drawing paper is acted upon nearly the saIDc in both directions-an important advantage, since the proportions of the map arc at least preserved, although the dimensions are subject to change и.

REPORT OF ASSISTA.l"T HKSitY :'.11ITCHELL ON HYDHOG:RAPH!t' l-iUitVIи:Y~ AT onEGON INLET A-SD IN RIYEH, JlllLITAitY DEPAlffMENT OF NORTH CAHOLINA.

BosTo:->, l\IA,.,s., .'fune 9, 1Sli2.
DEAR Sm: 'l'he iustrudion~ which I rect>iveJ. from yon on thLи 25th of March last directed me to

report to Commodore L. l\L Goldsborough, U. S. N., and ~iajor General A. E. Burnside, L'. S. A., for thP execution of certain hydrographi.c surwys in the military department of Xorth Carolina. 1 accordingly proceeded to Hampton roads and communicated with the flag-officer, from whom I received an ori1e1и on Captain Rowan, commanding the naYal fleet in that department, for the captured steamer Albemarle, to be used for hydrographic purposes at Oregon inlet. By the first transport I left for Hatteras inlet, and thence went directly to Newbern. whPr<>, 'llиitl10t1t delay, I reported to the commanding general, and pre5ented my order to Captain Rowan. Greatly to my disnppointment, I fom1d that the steamer .Albemarle lay at the bottom of the 1'tCtMe river, having been run down by a large vessel a tew days before my arrival. I wa~, however, assured that. after several days' delay, I could be furnished with another Fteamer suitable for my work, but that circmnи i!tances prevented her immediate delivery into my l1ands. 33 cs

REPORT OF THE SLPERINTENDENT OF

Against all delays I had been eRpecially cautioned by yourself and the flag-officer. I therefore lmd recourse to other expedients suggested in your instructions. I went on board of the Coast Survey schooner l3:mcroft, then in charge of Assi~tant A. S. ,,~adsworth, and requested the use of his vessel and his own co-operation in our enterpl'i;;e. l\lr. ads worth, with his wonted zeal and spirit. at once assented, and united liis party "'ith my own. T fouud tl1c l:hncroft in good order, aud as wdl allapted for my work as any sailing vessel. Her boats, however, wc1иe quite unsuited for sounding among breakern, and I was obliged to apply to Brigadier General Foster, military govl'rnor of Newbern, for the use of one of the life-boats. The cheerfulness with which the governor rnpvlieil this and other wants of my party convinced me tlmt he still retained that lively interest in the Coast Survey иwhich characterized his cm1rRe while attached to our service year;; ago. Thus, ha11pily sped by fortune, we left Newbern for the scene of our work, without delay. Ou our way up the sound, we nm in over the Hatteras swash and loaded up the schooner wit11 spar buoys and sinkers, in order tl1at we might possess the means of marking out all the channels and shoals as fast as we rnrveyed them. On reaching Oregon inlet, April 14, our first care wns to make a hasty examination of the whole ground and write out a sketch of the inlet and swash, setting forth such prominent facts relative to the depths of the channels and the dangers of the bar as should enable tl1e military and uaval authorities to decide upon the usicfulness of tllis aven uc. Having sent off several copies of this sketch, we at once applied ourselves to the systematic survey of tl1c outer bar and approaches. By the 27th of the month we had sounded out the bar and lower clrnnnels of the inlet, anrl placed tlJTee buoys in prnpeT positions for guiding vessels in from sea. 'V c had also set up ranges on s]wre, which were unmistakable, and sent to the commanding general full and complete sailing directions for entering the basin from the ocean. For the swash no sailing dirpctions could possibly be written; the channel being some five miles in length, and very tortuous. This portion of our survey was exceedingly slow and tedious. We could work, accurately, only about the time of slack water, and even at such times the gusts of wind and tho frec1uent grounding of the boat caused us to lose many lines. Among such rapid tidal currents a nanow channel can only be developed by running a multitude of short lines and coming to anchor, for the determination of position, at each change of course. Stakes had been placed upon the swaRh by one of the goYemment pilots before our arrival; but their number and po~itions had to be changed somewhat, as our survey defined the course of the ch1tnnels. We placed a striped buoy to mark the approach to the swash from the sound side, and erected a conspicuous tripod at the entrance to the slue-way. In forwarding 1he chart of Oregon inlet, I must call your attention to the movements of the beaclH1s aud shoals, whicl1 have taken place since our previous survey. Wl1ile, upon the one hand, the opening through tlic beach of Bodie's island has 8hifted to the southward, you will observe, upon the other, that the channel over the bar has moved in the opposite direction ; that it now opens to the northward, instead of leading out to the southeast, as formmиly. 'l'he reason why thi:1 channel is uow more shallow than fonnmиly is obviously to be found in this unfayorable cliange of the course. From considerable experience in the study of waves upon the open coast, I have come' to the conclusion that there is everywhere a prc1:all'nt, if not a permanent, angle at which the larger class of swells or rollers strike the general shore-line. I have observed, also, that the current flowing from an inlet is broken up or turned aside by coming in direct collision with the waves of the oc<ian, so that the stream inclines to escape along the trough of the sea, or in its wake. In the bend below Cape Hatteras, where the "ground swell," propagated from the northeastward, drives obliquely upon the coast, the outflowing stream from an inlet may pursue almo8t a direct path, and yet find jts way along the trough of the sea, ".eceiving no sudden check from the waves; but preserving for a gradual decline its scouring power, it may sweep its burden of sand far out from the coast, and distribute it uniformly over a great area.и The conditions at Hatteras inlet are favorable for the maintenance of a good bar, while those at Oregon inlet are quite opposed to this advantage.

'V

At Bodic'o is1and the swell stiиikcs the coast from the nort11east. This direction, l1owever, if, n<lt so nearly normal to the sl1orc-line, but tl1at a channel, leading out along the south beach, may have a deci<le<l adnmtage over that in any other dirrection. Our work i11 the vicinity of Bodie'~ i1'lalH1 waf' Pom1ilctcil on the 14tl1 of ~hy, and, by the 20th, the cluirt was brougl1t up, so that tracing,; wenи made an<l prc.;ented to ::\Iajor G1иneral Burnside and (.;ommodore Howan. A copy was aleo prepared and sent through your hand:' to Flag-Officer Goldsborough. In the course of this rnrvey, :'\Ir. "'adsworth eet up and determined the numerous signals, and made an interesting sketch of Fort Oregon, a fine earthwork built by the enemy on the south side of the inlet, and of other olijects. 'l'hc accornplishcd draughtsman of the piuty, l\Ir. Edward Cordell, of the Coast Survey, occupied one of the deserted houses on Budie's islarnl, where he plotted eacl1 day's work do11r liy me in the boats. As the plotting kept up with the field-work, we were al.tie to watch our devclnpmcnt of the channel;;, and the better fill in the dctaih1. Several blind channels had to Le followed up with sourn1ings till their bn1kheads were found and located on our map. Messrs. T. E. ArneR mu1 C. P. Dill away were principally employed with tlie f'<'Xtant; the former accompanied me in the boat, while tlw latter deveiopt;d the shore-line. Mr. Sengtellcr accompanied the party as tidal ohsrrn;r. llis conscicntiousnes:< of character gives value to the remarkably neat records which he kept. I sl1ould han been better satisfied if I could have furnished l1im witl1 an assistant, so that the observat.iom< C'ould h:ff(' heP11 kqlt up night and day; but tliis was impossihlP. Comparative tidal observations for the determination of the indined plane '!f refcrcnr,c were made by Mr. Dillaway at different. points on the swash. I plotted these, and ascertained that. the tide wave enters Oregon inlet witl1 a mean range of two foct; that it suffers a gradual drgradation its it advances towards the Rour1d, so that it becomes insensible u1wn a gauge at the outer edge of the swash. I found, from a study of the current epochs, that I could assume, without auy c<msiderable error, that the surface of the sound lay at the mean lecel ef tlie sea. I therefore decided to Tcfer my soundingB to an inclined plane, extending west.ward from the bal' and risiug one foot in five miles. The foot of this plane mean low water at tli.e inlet, was computed from the observations made during a semi-lunation; its position was referred by levellings to the bottom or floor of the nPw light-house cistern, (the most permanent object we could find,) and ascertained to be 2.10 feet below this bench. The mean level of the sea, whicl1 may be so easily and accurately determined from a few days' observations, and which i8 a plane common to all places upon the coast, would eeem to be the most natural plane of reference for a hydrographic survey; but the use of this upon our charts would leave to the inexperienced navigator the taek of making the very calculations which we would avoid; fo1и he desires to know the low water depths along the channel ways, aud possesses but a vague notion of the motion and character of the tide waYe. Before quitting the subject of Oregon inlet, I would mention that we found the Bodie's island light tower in ruins; it waR blown up by the enemy. For what pur1wse this wanton act was committed it is hard to dhrine. The pilots testify that this light 11ad often misguided coasters, who mistook it for Ihttems. By special request, I detained the schooner Bancroft and party for about a week, in 01иdcr to examine the Neuse river middle ground-a bad shoal, :five to nine miles Lelow Newbern, upon which 8everal gunboats and transports had grounded. Upon this shoal we placed three heavy i<par buoys, within sight from each other, marking the upper end, middle, and lower eud of the bank, aloug the southern side. 'l'he least water found by ns, in our rapid reconnaissance, was five feet upon the upper lobe, and eighteen and a quarter feet upon the lower knoll. There are several slues which cross the bank, connecting the channels on either side. At the time of our examination the river was high ; the least water along the thread of the southern channel being eleven feet. 'Ve furnished, for the use of the military department, sketches showiug the positions of our buoys and the soundings we had made. Major General Burnside has done me the honor to make me bearnr of a lt:tter to yourself, commending our services. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY ::\UTOHELL, A~st. U. 8. Coa11t Sunwy.

Surl'Cy.

t:". S. STEAMER HARRIET LAXE, Ship Island, ,Ua!J 16, 1SG2. SIR: I forward to you by the Baltic a plan of Fort Jackeon, (or the remains of it,) faithfully drawn, under the direction of Mr. Gerdes, by :'.lfessrs. Hal'l'is and Oltmanns, Assistants of the Coast Survey. It i~ a ~triking specimen of the effects of mortar practice, showing what can be done when di~tanccs are accurately determined, as they were in this ca~e, by the gentlemen belonging to tlw Cm1Pt Survf'y. If you can afford the expense it would be worth while to have the plan lithographed and kept as part of the history of tlii~ hideous war. I regret to eay that :Mr. Oltmann~. of the Sadtem. haB lwen severely wounded in the left brca~t by a rebel rifle ball. I sent the Sachem, in company with tliree of the mortar steamers, to show them the "'ay up Pearl river, in hopes of finding some of the enemy's gunboats, which have mysteriously disappeared, (now most likely burnt,) and while trying alone to push up the river the Sachem was attacked by a body of riffornPu . .!'11r. Oltmanns foll while directing the movements of the vessel. The battery of the Sachf'm was soon brougltt, to bear and the rebels driven away, one of them being shot deild on the branch of a tree. Everything lia,; been done to make :Mr. Oltmanns comfortabk. I intend to send him to the hospital at Southwest l'a:<~, where he can be properly attended to. I reg1иet his loss very mnch, as he has made himself vcr:' pl'Omincnt throughout the operations here, in performing the various duties he was callee! u11on to do, aK incleecl all the members of the Coast Survey party have. I have not spared tbe Sachem, but haYe treated her like the n!Ht of the vessels, putting her under fire when it was necesmry. On the 8th of this month, off )louile entrance, the steamer Clifton went aRltore on S.E. t'hoal, under the guns of :Fort :l\Iorgan, and neither of the larger steamers could get near enough to help hrr witlwu\ 11'rnger of grounding. I ordered the Sachem to go in and help her by carrying out anchors and line~. and though the shot from the fort were flying over and around the Clifton they wPnt at it cliecrfolly and intelligently. The Clifton got off just as they got their lines ready aud anchors down to heave hPr off, but Lfout. Com'g Baldwin felt as much indebted to the party on the Sachem as if th<иy had lwPn tlll' mea11~ of reliflиi11g him from his perilous position. I look upon the Sachem in the ~ame light as I would upon a topographical party in the armJи, ancl if I lose her in such employment she '\\иill have well paid for heriиe]f. Mr. Gerdes will be employed, for the present, in looking up the numerou~ lmoys whid1 tl1t'se people ha,иe stowed away or wantonly destroyed, as they have nearly enrything else. 1Ylwn found he will put them all down in their proper places. * и * * и и и Very respectfully, your obcuient servant, DAVID n.

Off Ship Island, Ill"!! 16, 186~. Sm: Having received yomи verbal imtructions to arcompany the gunboats of your flotilla to Lake Pontchartrnin and Pearl river, I got under way on the 13th instant, at 5 o'clock a. m., nnd was followed by the W eatfield, Captain Renshaw ; Clifton, Captain Bald win; and .Jackson, Ca11tain Woou worth, I led them south of Cat island to St Joseph's light-hou8e, they following close iu my wake. \rtи carried, for tlic least, nine feet, and no stoppages occurred. Near Grande island, your senior ofllcer, C:i1иtain Uemdiaw, requested me to overhaul a vessel to the southward, as I drew the least water. Uetnrniug I led thtи course again, and went through the Rigolets, and over the middle ground, with eiglit foet, and thence directly to Mandeville and the mouth of the Chcfuncta river, on which Madison is ::oituated. 1 lironglit two morn

The former intending to go next day into the river and visit Madi8011, Captain ftpn~haw concluder1 to return to Pearl river, and sParch in Pearlington and <+ainesdlle for vessels, and I took the lead again. On the middle grmmd, near Point aux Berbes, the J ackwn ran agrom1d, but the otlwr ves8els got over without; touching. The senior officer requested me to relieve her if possible, the Sachem not drawing over six and a half feet, bl'!t it was found impossible. An arrangement was made with the steamer \Vhiteman to come alo11gside next day, lighten the ,Jnckeon, and tow her off. I anchored near the light-house of the Rigolets, close to the IV estfield, ha.Ying previously run ten miles further to the eastward and back to communicate with Captnin Baldwin, and to briug him Captain ltenshaw'.s directions. On the l.Sth in:ltant we startetl early. and I took the lead into Peflrl 1inиr. 'Ye passed Pearlingto"n, and went 11p some thirteen milec, where, tlw river becoming so narrow that the "\Vestficld and Clifton could not make the abrupt turns, hotl1 of tho~e vc,-.~ds came to. Their captains came on board the Saclwm, and we went further up. Aboat three miles from Gainesville we were fired upon with musketry, several balls striking the ve~.иd, and one severely wounding my executive officer aud assistant, :Mr. Oltmanns, of the Coast Survey. The bullet hit him iu tl1e left breast, ju~t over tl1e lungs. He was cmriecl clown at once, and placed iu tlie <>abin, where he was a$ well attcndell to as cil'cumstance8 would permit. \\' e returned the fire, di8chargil1g 1ierhaps some fifty or sixty musket shots, and finally grape and canister from the 32-poun<lcr, which ~cattcrccl the enemy. The difficulty consi~ted in gettin~ the Sachem turned, as the river had hardly the wi<lth of her length. The fir8t cutter of tlH, Sachem wrrs !<Jot, aud Captain 11altlwiu lost his gig, lJOth lieing cnrn11ed between the wood~ and the propelier in turni11g, aud my Lrnuch was :filleJ, and llC'arly Inst too. The Sachem also lost her flag-staff, but the i:Otar~ and ~tripes 'vcre hoitited Jircctly on the mrtin gaff. She now carries the marks of teu or twehe rifle or rnnBkd ballB. The ll1Utrterrnaster at the whL~d narrowly e:5caped, a bullet baving passed through liis clothes, and several other persons on board had very narrow escapes from injury. "\Vhen we rcturcd Lo the Clifton and \Vestfidcl, ;\fr. Oltmanns was transfonecl to the former vessel, and nиerything that the great kindnes~ of Captain Baldwin could suggest was done for him. The doctor probed l1i8 wound, hut did not fiud tlic ball. At 8even o'clock "иe anchored near Grassy island, in Lake Bo1иgne. \Ye arc <lN'ply indebted to Captains Henshaw and Balclwin, uoth of whom ably direeted affairs dmиing the attack. The loss of }fr. Oltmanns from the party is very great, as he had learned to manage the Sachem for any SCI'Yiee. }:Yen if he recovers, he will Le unfit for duty this season, and will have to take the fir8t opportunity to return north. Late at nigl1t I vitiited the Clifton, and was told by the doctor that the wound wa~ nиry R{~Verl'; lmt that 1.Ir. Oltmanus, with care, might 1иec0Tcr. This morning, the 16th May, we got under way, and stood fo1и Cat and Ship islands. l\Ir. Harris takes the J;lO~t of executive officer on the Sachem. VPry res1lectfully,

I:XTRODUCTION.

The directory furnished by Assiotant Davidson, and first published in the Goa.st Survey Report for 1558, now in its revi~ed form, preceded by a brief sketch of the commencement and progress of the survey of the western coaRt. California was ceded to the United States by the treaty which was ratified with Mexico on the 30th of May, 1848. In that same year the march of improvement, l1aving already gained the shores of Oregon, prompted applications to the 'l'reasury Department that the Coast Survey organization, which had been working several years on tl1e Atlantic side, might be made to include also t.he Pacific coast.. In accordance with directions from the department, the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, iu the autumn of 1848. organized a surveying party, assigning for the field work, in Oregon, James S. Williams, one of the mo:>t experienced of the civil assistants in reconnai~sance, and, for the hydrography, Lieut. Oom'g W. P. McArthur, U. S. N., of tried service in the survey of the Atlantic section!'!. Sub-Assistant Jos. S. Ruth was detailed as topographer. For the general 11ses of the party, the schooner Ewiug was despatched from New York on the 10th of January, 1849, under command of Lieut. '\V. A. Jfartlett, U. S. N., and the party followed on tho l,;t of February in tl1e stc11mcr Falcon, by way of the Isthmus of Darien. '.l.'he Ewing, after a long a11d dangerous passage, passed the straits of Magellan, and finally reached San Francisco on the 1st of August, her time from Callao being fifty-one days. The opening of' gold deposits near San Francisco had, months hefore, concentrated all the means of coastwise tra.n~port there, leaving Mr. '\Villiams unable to reach the month of tl1e Columbia rin~r. He occupied the tim::-. aftc>r liis nrn;'al in April, by a general reeonllllissance

of the north shores of San }'rancisco bay. Lieut. Com'g l\icArthnr joinecl the party in the Ewing, at the end of .August, to find that the retention of any part of her crew, whilP golcl wa;; to be picked up. wonl<l b(и a matter of extreme difficulty. The high rate of wages, moreover, and the lateness of the season, made it expedient to defer special opPratimw till the next year. Xotwithstauding the clrawlmck;; a1lu<lPd to, a general reconnaissance of the coast was made by this party from :Monterey northward to the mouth of the Columbia river, and a preliminary survey of the entrance of that river. \Yith full knowlcclgc of the difficultit>H. to be overcome in pushing the desired WOl'k further, four of the younger officers, who had been engaged on the Atlantic coast-George Davidson, .A. l'\I. lfarrirnn, .James S. Lawson, and .John Rockwell-pledged t.llf' assurance of their exertions, and were seut out in May, 1850. 'l'hese were followed in October by Assistant R. D. Cutts and by A. F. Rodgers, the result of whose labors ha, been the elaborate topographical survey of the sl10res of San }'rancisco bay, and of the coast northward to Bodega bay. The party first detailed for duty left the Pacific coast in the following autumn, having added the Bnrvey of :Mare Island strait, and a large amount of general information relating to the coast, its harbors, and river entrances, and to the island;;. Lieut. Com'g McArthur and Lieut. Bartlett had giYen spccial attention to the lighting and marks needed for safer navigation, aml fumished the sailing directions then requisite for passing up the coast and through the straits of Fuca. .Assi8tant Davi<l~on, of th.-: party, which, in IS.JO, so fully met my expectations, determined the geographical position of Point Conception, a service of tlw first consequence at that time for the rapidly increasing transit by sailing vessel8 along tluи, coaRt of California. 'l'o thi~ 8Ucceedecl the determination of geographical positiorn'I, and of the magnetic \'ariations at prominent point8 and headlandi<, and the topographical survey of various localities in California a11c1 Oregon, hy the untiriug energy of J'\lr. Daviihion and the assistants who took up work during the same season. Their names are associated with most of the mape. and charts of tl1e western coast, whicl1 have since b('eu published, and with cleKcri11tiom< of tluc fidd work in the annual rereports of the Superintenclent,. 'l'he 8lll"YPJ of the sl10re>! of the Santa Barham chaunl'l was furthC'r extended by the <lc>tail for duty of Captain (now Brigadier General) :F~. O. C. Ord, U.S. A., and Sub-Assistant"'. l\I. Johnson, iu the summer of 1853, and by Assistant ,V. E. Grtc'enwell, since February, lS.55. Assistant G. A. Fairfield, in the rnme 8eason, re1ilaced Mr. Cutts in tlrn triangulation which be ha<l canicd from ?.ionterey to the north of San Fraucisco, and was in turn succeeded Ly .Assistant Davidson, who lmd, in the interval, den~loped the geographical peculiarities of \Vashington Territory liy the triaugnlation of Admiiиalty inlet, Puget's sound, and the numerous inclentationfl of both, and by determinations of l11tit.ude, longitucle, and the magnetic elements, at many points of the shores of the Territory, as he had previously done on tl1e shores of California 11.nd Oregon. .At hi~ iиeturn to the .Atlantic coast, in December, 1860, the continuance of the work in '\Yashington Tenitory devolved on Sub-assistant Lawson. Commander .Tames Alden, U. S. N., took charge of th to Lydrographic operations in .August, 1851; revised the early reconnaissance of the entire western coast of the United States, and in the course of the nine years following brought the local l1ydrography up even with the data which had been snp11lied by the field parties. Working part of the time with two vessels, he was assisted in thc command at intervals by Lieuts. Com'g 'l'hos. H. Stevens, J. S. Kennarcl, R. M. Cuyler, and Arch'd l\iacRue. A~ chief of the hydrographic party, tl1e name of Commander .Alden is connected with nearly all thc cha1иtt< which are referred to in tl1e directory of the Pacific coast. .For the tides, to which speci~l attention has been given from an early period in the history of the survey, as to one of its most important adjnncte, the requisite observations, at point8 selected by the Superintendent, were first directed by Lieut. \V. I'. 'l'rowbridge, and, for a short period after, иby Lieut. N. F. Alexander; but since .July, 1857, by Lieut. G. H. Elliot, severally of the Corps of Engineers. The results worked out in the office for tlie tides, and for latitude and longitude, the sailing directions furnfahed by the bydrograpl1ic officerll for the charts, the distances bet\\'een points as measured on them, the dangers of the coast, and additional particulars wиithin the rwrsonal knowledge or obscrn1tion of AsBistant Davidson, will be found embodied in his directory.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

GERMAi\'TOWN, PA., December I, 1862. DEAR Srn: In my answer 1.o your letter of inquiry of November 10, it was stated that since writing the directory I haJ accumulated much valuable material. This having been incorporated, it is proper to mention that the principal sources of information were the reports of the progress of the Coast Survey in Santa Barbara channel and Monterey bay ; your discussion of the mass of tidal observations ; the establishment of new light-houses and changes in old ones ; the work иupon the approaches to San Francisco bay; the detailed survey of Crescent City harbor; the examinations of the approaches, entrances, and extent of Koos aud Gray's bays; the continuation of the work in the Gulf of Georgia; and two years' aduitional personal experience. In that time I made special examinations of the seaboard, from Half-moon bay to the W alalla river, embracing the first accurate determination of tho position and extent of tbe middle and north Farallones. It will, perhaps, be gratifying to you to learn that, beyond the typographical en-ors in the first publication, it has not been found necessary to expunge a dozen lines, and that the few changes made have resulted from giving details where investigation had solYed generalities. Many portions hare been rearranged to bri1:g each item consecutively before the eye. Very respectfully, yours, GEORGE DAVIDSON, .Ass't U. S. Coast Suriиey. Prof. A. D. liACHE, Superintendent U. 8. Coast Surcey, rVasl1,ington, D. C.

KENSING'l'ON, PA., .August 29, 1858. DEAR Sm: In offering for your acceptance the following Directory for the Pacific Coast of the United States, it may not be arni8s to state the circumstances under which it was undertaken. For nearly eight years the duties which you assigned to me in California, and in Oregon and Washington 'l'erritories, kept me moving continually along the seaboard in every manner of conveyance, and familiarized me with almost every mile of the coadt, along which my Yarious trips and explorations have amounted to an aggregate of between fifty and sixty thousand miles. I early felt the want of reliable information in tangible form, instead of trustiug to memory, and, upon assuming the charge of the coast surveying b1иig R.H. Fauntleroy, I determined to embody for publication the information acquired, but several years of failing health ]1revented the execution of more than regular duties, until the growing desire to leave the Pacific coast forced me to occupy the remaining leisure moments in arranging the matter while yet freshly photographed upon the mind. A small part was published in San l<'rancisco, and altliough abounding in typographical errors, the avidity with which it was sought wa~ a strong incentive to continue the self-imposed task. The result is now placed at your disposal, and having examined all the courses, distances, and po~itions, I trust that no essential errors have been overlooked; but whatever have, fall upon my own ehoulders . .My duties having been especially geodetic and astronomical, we naturally preceded the hydrography, and, working in comparatively unknown waters, l1ave had constant occasion to use the lead. When seeking for an anchorage, drifting with currents, or on boat duty, I have almost invariably kept it going from my own ha.nd. SeveraJ cli,,.cnveries have rewarded our efforts. 'J.'he historical notices of previous discoveries will be found few and short, as hardly coming within the scope of tlic present undertaking. 'l'he descriptions may reconcile some of the discordances of the early navigators. Very respectfully, yours, GEORGE DAVIDSON, Assistant Coa1t Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Suruy, Wusl1ington, D. C.

INTROll1TCTOR Y.

Before the reeent conquest of California and the discovery and development of its vast mineral wealth, comparatively little was known of tl1e hydrography and geography of its coast, except by the few navigators trading along its seaboard, or the daring otter hunter, familiar with every cove, rock, and headland. All that had berm accomplishcrl forcibly showed that a great work hnrl yet to he plannf'd and executed. It would take u~ far from OUl' pre13cribcd path to trace the extent, bearing, and importance of the successive di~coveries made during a period of more than three hundred years, between 1539, when Francisco de Ulloa first determined Lower California to be a peninrnla, and 1 S,53, when the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey firnt de~patehed a party to give definite shape to onr shores. If the early adventurers and discoverers made their explorations in small crazy vessels, witl1 wretched and untrustworthy imtruments and methods, it is no less true that the first Coast Survey partie~ made theirs with inadequate funds, and under difficulties and privations that the well-housed Californian of to-day can never fully appn~ciate. The task we have proposed to ourselves before leaving this glorious El Dorado, whose Golden Gate has admitted in ten years the commerce of every nation, and given egrcRs to products worth five hundred millions of dollars, will be, to state all that is known at the present time of the hydrography and geography of the Pacific coast of the United State';; from the southern bonnclary in J20 32' to the northern boundary in 49░, embracing an ocean sh01иe-line of over 3,120 miles, divided as follows: California, including the islands of the Santa Barbara channel, 1,097 miles; Oregon 285 miles; "\Yashington Territory, including the soutl1 side of the Strait of J nan de Fuea, Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, the Archipelago de Haro, &c., 1,738 miles. 'l'he descriptions of ports, bays, anchorages, reefa, capes, islands, &c., will be given generally from personal observation made during an examination of the coast, extending through nearly eight years. Whatever has not come directly under our own criticfam will be taken from the published reports and maps of the Coast Survey. The names adopted will be those most reliable. Where any changes have taken place, they will be stated if known. With these few worad of introduction, we may be pardoned in ex1irrssing a conviction tl1at the knowledge herein conveyed will be of advantage to our extended commerce, and in asиmring the navigator approaching the bold outline of our coast, of the accuracy of the geographical positions. No work of the kind lias heretofore been undertaken; and should it possess no other merit than serving as a nuclf'us for aggregating future discoveries and developments, we shall feel that our labor has not been wholly in vain.
EXPLANATORY Rl!:MARKS.

The longitudes of nine stations on the coast have been determined by the Coast Survey, by means of moon culminations, occultations, and solar eclipses. 'I'he observations of moon culminations at each station generally extended through three lunations. The latitudes were determined according to the most approved methods and with the most delicate instruments. 'l'hese stations and twenty-four intermediate ones have been connected by means of a large number of chronometers, (from fourteen to twenty-one,) trani<ported by steamer, for the determination of the longitudes of the intermediate ones, of which the latitudes were also accurately determined in the same manner as the principal onei::. Other points, including light-houses, have been determined by triangulation. Where any position is given to the nearest minute only, it has been taken from the latest chart of the Coast Survey. The longitude is reckoned west from Greenwich. The prediction ef tlie tides superMedes the crude approximations of previous explorers. Tables and examples will be introduced to show the manner of predicting the times and heights of higl1 and low waters at San Francisco and other harbors. S~ndings are given for mean low water. Bearinga are magnetic. DiBtances are expressed in geographical (nautical) miles. Magnetic declinations (variations) were determined with delicate and reliable instruments, and precautions were always taken to avoid the influence of local attraction. Ducriptions qf light-ltOU8es, fog-bells, buoys, &c., are from the published notices of tlie Light-house Board.

REPORT OF THE SCPBTIINTE:NDENT Ol'

COAST DIRECTORY, MEXICO.
LOS COROXADOS. These islands belong to ~Iexico; lie about seven miles off the coast, and nearly eight miles south of tl1e boundary between Mexico and the United States. They form a group of high, bold, and abrupt rocks and islets, of which the largest is 15 miles S. 11░ F.. from l'oint Loma, about l~ mile in length by one-third of a mile in breadth, and lying in a NW. and SE. direction. It is a wedge-shapp,d mass, about 575 foet above the sea, the surface having some earth upon it, but entirely destitute of trees. A few small shrubs exist, and during the rainy season the soil is covered with grass, and a great abundance of gaudily colored wild flowers showing in patches of orang<', purple, and yellow, when ecen from the water. During the dry season everything is withered and the i~let presents a sterile appearance. Cacti and other plants grow among the rocks. There ii:' an anchorage about one-quarter of a mile to the eastward of the islet, and but one laniling place; even there the ascent is difficult for fifty feet, and thence easy to the crest, about half a mile distant. 'l'he geographical position of the highest point, as determined by the Coast Survey, is :

CALIFORNIA. The name California is first found in the worthless romance of "Sergus, of Esplandian," the son of Amadis of Gtrnl, written by Garcia Ordonez de Montalvo, the translator of the Amadis. It was first printed in 1510, with editions in 1519, 1521, 1525, 1526, (two,) 1575, 1587, and the recent reprint of 1857. The name appears in numerous passages, of which the following are given. f:::fr'rgus, ch. 157. "Know that, on the right hand of the Indies, very near to the 'l'errestrial Paradise, there is an island called California, which was peopled with black women, without any men among them, because they were accustomed to live after the fashion of Amaz;ons." "In tl1is island called California, are many Griffins, on account of the great savageness of the country and the immense quantity of the wild game found there." "Now, in the time that those great men of the Pagans sailed fagainst Constantinople] with those great fleets of which I have told you, there reigned in this land of California a queen, large of body, very beautiful, in the prime of her years," &c., &c. The name California next occurs in the memoirs of the conquistador, Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who served with Cortes in the conquest of Mexico. He writes that "Cortes again set sail from Santa Cruz and discovered the coast of California." Here Cortes rem11ined for some time, disheartened at the want of success .of liis various expeditions. The viceroy, Meudo~, despatched a vessel under the command of Ulloa with letters to Cortes. "Ulloa had a most favorable voyage, and soon arrived in the harbor where Cortes lay at

anchor. 'l'he letters of his wife and those of his children and of the viceroy had so much effect upon him tliat he gave the command of his vessel to Ulloa, embarked for Acapnfoo, and, when he had arrivetl here, he hastened to Qnauhnahuac, where his wife resided. и и и Shortly after, also, the troops arrived which had been left behind in California." After a few months' repose Cortes sent out a more considerable expedition, under command of Vlloaи "This armament left the harbor de la Natividad in the month of Juue of one thousand five hundred and thirty, and so many years-I forget tl1e exact year." The California referred to above is the peninsula of that name, generally known as Lower California.. and the date 1535. They are the only times in which Diaz uses the name. (Cap. CC.) In 1539 Francisco de lJlloa determined Lower California to Le a peninsula; this fact appears to have been subsequently forgot.ten, for it was called Ilas Carolinas, in honor of Charlcf' II of Spain. 'l'he name California was gradually used to designate the region from the Gulf of California to the mythical "Straits of Anian." 'l'he country was called New Albion by Sir Francis Drake in 1579. In recent times the region north of San Di .. go wa~ called Alta California. :From the southern boundary, in latitude 32░ 32', longitude 117░ 06', to Point Arguello, in latitude 34 ░ 34', longitude 120░ 381, the coast runs ,V.N,V. 2~5 miles; from Point Arguello to Cape )fcndocino, in latitude 40░ 25', longitude 124░ 22', .NW. fi25 miles; from Cape Mendocino to Cape Flattery, in latitude 48░ 23', longitude 124░ 44!, N.NW. 480 miles. The monument marking the western initial poiut of the boundary between Mexico and the united States is on the table bluff rigiug from the low land south of San Diego bay. It is un obdisk of wl1ite marbleи about twenty feet in height, and resting upon a pedestal.

This is the sout11ern part of the western boundary of San Diego bay, and the termination of a remarkable narrow spur of coan;e, crumbling sandstone, which rise11 south of Puerto Falso, or Palse bay, and west of the town of San Diego, to the height of 300 feet, and after stiиetching south for about miles, gradually increasing in height to 422 feet, terminates very abruptly. It is covered with coar"e grass, cacti, wild sage, and low bushes.

SAN DIKGO BAY.

Next to that of San Francisco, no harbor on the Pacific coai:.t of the United States approximates in excellence that of the bay of San Diego. It is l'('adily distinguished, easily approached, and a depth of 2~ feet can be carried over the bar, which is three-quarters of a mile east of the southern extremity of Point Loma, and between it and the tail of the Zuniga shoal. The bar is about 650 yarde. across from the outer to the inner five-fathom lines. Vessels coming from the northwest make the ridge of Point Loma 11.s a long, flat-topped i8land, when about 25 miles distant. This appearance is occasioned by the bay to the southwest, by the low l:md to the northeast, and by the Puerto Falso at the north. A thick field of kelp lies 11.long the western shore of Point Loma, the inner edge being about one mile off-shore, and having a breadth of half a mile. The outer edge marks the line where the depth of water suddenly changes from l/O to 10 fathoms. 'l'he field commences off the bar at the entrance to :False bay, and stretches southward 2i miles south of Point Loma. Apprnaching the south end of Loma, along the

As soon as the point is passed, a long, low beach of shingle is opened, making out from the east side of the point am1 forming a natural breakwater, forme1иly called Punta de Guiranas* by the Spaniards, but now ilesignated as B1tllast Point.

Between Point Loma and this sl1oal runs the channel, which is le~s than half a mile wide within the three-fat110m lines. \Vith tl1e least swell tl1e breakers show the position and extC'nt of the shoal, and at low tides part of it is bare. It has been said that a rock, having but five or six feet of wnter upon it, lies in the channel; its position being marked by a patch of kf'.!p. whieh is, however, tom mvay in heavy wcath;;r. The pilot-boat Fanny reported being upon it in 18{,l, but the examinations of the Coast Surn-y have developed no such clanger, -and the report ha;i been generally discredited.

After passing BallaRt Point steer for La Pla;'t'fl. and anchor anywlu~re in from 4 to 10 fathoms, with good holding-ground. In~ide the point, and about :<50 yards X. by W, from it, is a shoal having only 12 feet water upon it, in a line from Ballast Point to the westernmost house at La Playa. It is a quarter of a mile long. The shoals on the starboard hand, after enterjng, am plainly in sight, except at very high water.

The eastern side of the entrance to San Diego bay is low and flat, eovcreil with thick bushe~ and gra~s. It is called "The Island," although a peninsula, being very low and narrow towards the head of the bay. On Ballast Point, at the base of the Point Loma ridge, are visible the min~ of the old S1mnish fortifications, &e. From Ballast Point the bay runs about nortl1 for a mile and a half; thence curves gradually to the eastward for three miles to New San Diego; t11ence to the head of the bay, southeast, seven miles. ThP a\иerage width of the bay after passing La Playa is a mile and a half, but at New San Diego, after contracting to a trifle over half a mile, it again expands to about a mile and a half, with low shores and cxtimsive marshes and fiats. Many years since tl1e San Diego river changed its conrRe during a freshet, and emptied into San Diego bay instead of Puerto Falso to the northwest.

the old town of San Diego. An appropriation was made by Congress to tum the channel of the river to its original bed. 'l'his was done a few yearR ago, but the works have not proved of sufficient strength. The great drawback in San Diego bay is the want of fre~h water, which has to be brought from the river. An effort was made in 1851 to obtain a supply at La Playa by sinking an artesian well, but after boring 63.5 feet the attempt was abandoned. A similar attempt. with like results, was made at New Town, both continuing the previously expressed opinion of geologists. The same amount of money would have brought it in earthen pipes from the river. During the long dry season the river loses itsdf in the sand, and the inhabitants arc compelled to dig in its bed to obtain their supplies. Fresh provisious are readily procured here. "\.Yood ii" scarce and not good. The land in the region of San Diego bay is, with tl1e excPption of a small portion, well adapted to grazing. '111erc are numerous tracts, of limited extent, which produce well, but they are favorably situated for irrigation, the want of rain being very much felt in every section. Back in the mountainous districts is found abundance of timber of many varieties, such :rn oak, pine, cedar, fir, ash, sycamore, elm, &c. Gold, silver, lead, copper, &c., arP fouud, but tl1e produd is not remunerative. A vein ofи coal (lignite) has lиcen dil'covcred near San Diego, is reported of excellent quality, and interested parties are erecting rn11chinery to work the lead, but the f'xperiment must prove a failure, because no gc11uine coal is to be f'onnd upon the coast, and in 18.51 a report was made against this very deposit. иwhen fi~hery as:mmeR a practfral shape on this coast tl1e 11arbor of San Diego will become a position of importance. ~~!ready several Fmall companies arc engaged in the whaling business. The waters in this viC'inity abound with the "California Greys," which are very troublesome to deal with, unless the bomblance is llRed in killing them. Communication with San Yrnncisco and th<:l northern or windward ports is maintained every week by steamer, arn] by regular lines of sailing veRsels. San Diego bay was discovered by J nan Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese in the service of Spain, in September, 1542; called Port San Miguel, and placed by him in latitude 34░ 20 1 N., showing the imperfection of the instruments and the modes of observi11g in those days. He found great numbers of Indians here, "иho rr;ceiverl him hospitably, Lut witl1 cautiou:Jncss. It received its present name from Sebastian Vizcaino, who ~urvPycd it in November, 1G02. In his time there existed a fon;st of tall, straight oak and other trees bordering the NW. side of the bay. Thi,; forest was said to be three leagues in length and half a league in breadt11, and that to the northwest of it wae a good harbor, nuw known as Puerto Falso. La l'erouse (in 1787) gives a copy of an English map of San Diego, of 1782, (Dalrym11le'~,) on which no nnme is aso;igned to the Zuniga shoal, but t11e shoal inside Balla8t Point and under the eastern shore is called "i::'hoal of Zuniga." Ballast Point is called "Point Guisarros," and J>oint Loma, "Hill Point" At the north end uf the ridge of Point Loma is nn extensive shoal bay called Puerto Falso, or False B иYи The bar at its entrance lies N. by W. !! '\Y., dist.wt 5z miles from the southern ntremity of Point Loma; anu having but three feet of water, it can be crossed only in the smoothest weather. The entrance jn~t inside the line of heavy breakers i~ about a quarter of a mile in widtl1, but rapidly contracts to less than an eightli. The 110rtbern point of this bay is about two miles in length, very narrow, and covered with low sand dunes.

A view of False bay and the surrounding country was given on the Coast Survey reconnai11sance chart of 1853.
To the no .. th and west of this the shore becomes compaet and unbroken, except by the valleys of San Luis Rey and San .Tuan Capistrano. The waters off this stretch of the coast Vizcaino called the bay of Santa Catalina. The latest chart of San Diego bay is that accompanying the Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey for 1857. From the southern extremity of Point Loma the coast runs N. by W. for 22 miles; thence to Point Lausen, (of Vancouver, 1793,) forming the cast point of San Pedro bay, NW. by W. t W. nearly 60 miles.
SAN" LUIS REY.

The mission of San Luis Rey is tlie largest in California, and the number of domesticnted Indians formerly in its neighborhood gave it the appearance of a large and thriving settlement.

SAN PEDRO BAY.

This bay is well protected in every direction, excevt agaimt the winter gales from tl1e southeast round to the soutl1west. During the spring, summer, and autumn, it is an excellent roadstead. From Point Fermin,и which is the southeast point of high land west of the bay, the line of bluff runs exactly north and south for abont two miles, being bold, and averaging 60 feet iu height. Vessels coming from the westward through the Santa Barbara channel make San Pedro bill, (1,GOO feet in height,) forming the west side of the bay, as an iBland projected against the mountains to the southward and eastward. Approaching Point Vincente, which is the southweRt point of the hill, vessels can keep it close aboard, there being from 50 to 80 fathoms within a mile of the shore; round Poi11t Fermin within half a mile, in from 6 to 10 fathoms, and open the small island called El l\foro,t run for that island, and when abreast of the landing, (readily recognized by the houses on the bluff,) about. one mile north of Point Fermin, anchor in three fathoms, hard bottom, and half a mile off shore. Vessela must anchor a mile off t.o get five fathoms. Coming from the south with northwest winds, beat in boldly until abreast of the landing; keep the lead going and anchor anywhere in its vicinity. Do not approach the low shore, to the north and cast of El l-Iuro, closer than one mile, at which limit four fathoms water will be found. In winter, anchor further out, and more to the southward, in order to be able to Blip the cable and go to sea should a heavy s~utheaster spring up. In 1852 we saw a vessel ride out a very heavy southeast gale of three days' duration. In March, 1863, the steamer Senator was lost in entering San Pedro in a fog. The waters of the lagoon, inside of the low sandy beach, and a mile or more northward of El }foro, find their principal outlet between that island and the bluff point half a mile west of it. 'l'he entrance is very narrow and crooked, and 11as two buoys, about 200 yards apart, to mark it. In 18.59 it is statl'dt that the "bar at the entrance to the creek remains about the same, (as it did in 1852.) .At mean low wat('r, throwing out the half tides, only two feet of water can be carried over it." A small tow-boat is now used for taking vesi;1els to New San Pedro, situated about three miles inside tbe bar.

The mean iise and fall of tides is 3.7 feet, of spring tides 4.7 feet, and of nc>ap tides 2.2 foet. The mean duration of the flood is 61t. 18m .и of the ebb Glt. 5m., and of the staud Oft. 30m. The average difference between tl1e corrected establishments of the a. m. and p. rn. tides of the same Jay is J h. 1 Om. for bigh water, 1md lk. 4m. for low water. The differences, when the moon's Jecliuation is greatest, are lh. [Jfim. and llt. 38m., respectively. The average difference in height of thcee two tides is 1.5 feet fo1и the high waters and 2.0 for the low waters. When the moon's declination i~ greatest, those differences are 2.3 feet and 3.1 feet, res pee ti vely. The average difference of the higher l1igh and lower low waters of the same day is 5.6 feet, and when the moon's declination is grcatrиst 6.G feet. 'l'hc higher high tide in the twen1y-four hours occurs about 9h. IOm. after the moon's upper transit (southing) when the moon's declination is north, and about 3lt. 16m. before when soutl1. The lower of the low waters occurs about seven hours after t11e higher high tide. The greatest observed difforence between the two low waters of one day was 3.9 feet, and the greatest difference between the higl1er l1igh aml lower low waters of one <lay 8.4 feet. To find the times aud }wights of high and low waters, compute them for San Diego, the times and heights being sensibly the same for both places. The town of Los Augeles is 2~ miliиs north Ly 1l1e road, from San Pedro, and is the centre of an extensiYe grazing, agricultural, and grape-growing country. 'I'l1c 'luantity of grapes, aml fruit generally, shipped to San Francisco during the proper season is already enormous, being not Jess than 2,000,000 pounds. At all seasons one steamer finde a profitable trade. The coa~ting trade of this place is now greater than the aggregate trade of all the other ports south of San Franci~co. In nine months of 1856-' .')7 the number of vessels entering tl1e port was 8:.!, with an aggregate tonnage of 26,971 tons. Uegular commuuication is maintained witl1 San J<'rancisco and other ports by steamcro and ;;ailing vessels. Over 100,000 gallons of wine, and 5,000 gallons of brandy, were produced in 1854, and the culture of the grape bids fair to outstrip all others. 'l'he quantity of wine produced from the vintage of 18.57 was 350,000 gallons ; of brandies 5,000 gallons. 'There is no doubt that in 1862 the yield jg more than double these quantitit>~. Cotton, sng;ar c:me, tobacco, flax, and the cereals, yield productive cropll, and the olive grows in abundance. Salt works have been c~tahli~hed within a few miles of Los Angele!!, but the pond from which the salt water i;; obtained wvers 011ly an area of 600 yards in length by 200 in width. The yearly product is about five tons. The country at the foot of the back hills is as productive as any in California, but its distance from a large market is a great hindrance to investment and improvement. The vast plains are literally covered with cattlP, and many of the rancheros count their yearly increa.se by thousands. These cattle are driven to the mining districts aud San :Francisco, but during the not unusual droughts of summer grp,at suffering is experienced, aиnd large numbers of tl1cm perish. 'l'he Bay of San Pedro was diseovered by Cabrillo in 1642, and was called the Bay of Smoke, (Fnmos.) When Vancouver was seeking for San Pedro bay he found such deep water off Point Vincente that he thought this could not be near the place ; but after getting to the south and east he had a full view of the anchorage. He did not, however, enter it.

A view of San Pedro bay an<l San Pedro 11ill was given on the Coast Survey olwct of 1853. In 18Gl a preliminary examination was ma<le of the lagoon, situatct1 E. S., about 1;3 or lG miles from San l'cdro, and which receives the waters of the Sanli1 A:rna rinиr. It was found to l>e sonw five mih,~ long, :mcl si>paratrиcl from the ocean by a nanow strip of low i":mrl hrneh, over whid1 wash"~ tlw luиa\'Y swdl from the northwest and southeast storms. The lagoon lta~ a hr.,111lth of only a fow hundred yards, and a mouth aLont 50 yard>' in wiLlth, with a uarrow bar, upon whieh it i:-; snpposecl 10 or 12 feet of water might be found at l1igh tide. On thi1' liar tl1ere is a very heavy break at all ~tages of the tide, rendering it dangerous to cross in boats of any kind. Tl1ere is said to beи 110 :;afo anclwrnge off the entrance, alld tlt<' lO\'" straight beach, with a trend nearly cast and west, affords no protection whatever. The San l'('dro wind gap liC>s hetwecn S,rn l'eclro hill and tl1(' Sierra San .Jllirn, to tl1P soutl1east uf the Santa Anna, and the summer winds draw dirl.'ctly on the land, causing th(, northwest swell to roll upon tl1e beach with g-rmt force. In winter the southeast and sonthweot, swell breaks square upon this whole liuc of coast, and would prevent any ves1<el pas;;:ing into or out of the lagoon, or riding at ancl10r near it. In snmmrr tlw Sant.a Anna is said to frequently clry up before rP;1eliinf\" the higoon. From Point Vincente* the coast trends X. by 'TIT. it 1Y. for 11 miles; tl1ence 1Y. by 8. to Point Humr, in latitudl.' 34) OD' north, and longitude 118░ 41' west; t11encr' to ]'oint ilfugn, 1Y. ~ X. for 17 mili;s. The last point lies NE. by E. ~ E., distant 14 miles from the eastern end of Auacapa. Thi& 1011g cmTc in tl1c coast is known as the Bahia Ona. Point Dume"' ril'es iuto a dome-like form 202 fePt hi~d1. The fand immediatd_v behind it falls away, so that in making it from the wcl't it ril'es into view as an i>llanil close under the high mountains. EaHl\nu<l of Dume the mountains spring directly from the water. A view of Point Dume is given on the Com't Survey Bhcet of 1853. From Poиint Jl[ugu to San Buenartиntura, distant 17 mileR, the coast lrns a general trend K\\~. by 1\T.; but, about midway, it curves southwestward of this course 2~ miles towards Anacapa, thus contracting the eastern ent.rani"e to the Santa Barbara channel. 'l'wo milPs west of Point ~fugu is Laguna Point, elo~e under which is very deep water, the 10-fathom line running within 250 yards of the shore. B0tween ~Iugu aud Buenavpntura tlw coa~t is low, flat, ancl sandy, being thf' opening of tlw Yallrиy of Santa Clara, through which flows thP Santa Clara river. This stream i8 nearly dry during the summrr, and termiuatPs in fagoons and rnarsheR, hut in. the rainy season a volume of water i~ hTought down ha Ying suJlicient force to hrPnk through the narrow sand beach and flow into the ocean. The confiх:uration of the shore, ancl its rdatiou to Anacapa aud Santa Cruz island, are shown upon the preliminary chart of the eastern entraneP to the Banta Barbara channel, publish<'d by the Coast Survey in 1857. The eastern entrance to the Santa Barbara cliannel lies between tl1e eastern encl of Anacapa island and Point Hueneme, whicl1 is about halfway hr tween lfugu and Buenaventura. From Anac:i1m, Point Hueneme bears NE. by N. & N., distant 9Б miles. Directly off tl1is point is found a remarkaLIи example of a submarine Vftlh'y, commencing with a depth of 10 fat.horns, 400 yards from the hPach, incrc:ising to 50 fat.homR iu fivc-eightlrn of a mile, and to 113 in less than two miles.

Santa Barbara is a town of considerable size, lying in t11e middle of an agricultural tract, running east and west, at the southern baRe of the Sierra Concepcion, bnt of limited breadth. 'l'be trade with Sau :t'ranci~co is not extensive; but this being one of the greatetlt ~tock-raising districts on the coast, vast drovcfi of cattle pass thrrmgl1 and are sent to Sa.11 Francisco arul the rnini11g rli,,trids. The mission, founded December 4-, 1786, is 011c of the largest and beet establi:shment~ of the kind in California, and in the gardens attached to it the grape and olive were cultivated with rncces~. In the t<iwn of Santa Barbara 1here is a single grapevine which yielded during tl1e year ] 858 onиr two thousauJ 11nmHlo of grapes. A single stem rises from the ground a height of five f<~et, aud its branches, supported Ly poll:~, cover a very large area. At tl1c bas"' the trunk measures two feet in circumfcrcncc.-(Califoruia Stnt.c Register, 1859.) A large bitumen pit, about ei~ht miles west of Santa Barbara, emptie:: directly into thE' ocean, and tl1e bitumen, floating on the water, works against tl1e summer or northwest. winds even beyond Point C011cPpcio11. Very frequently, in calm weather, a great extent of the surface of tl1e clrnnnel become~ iridescent from the thin film of bitumen spread over it. 'l'l1e rock.s along the slwre, even to tl1e westwanl of Poim Co11ce11eion, arc covered with it, and when encamped at El Uoxo, in 1850, we gathered it to start our fires. 'l'lw lnclinnK l1ave always used it to pay the scams of their canoe::. Sulphur, in large beds and of superior quality, exists along the seaboard, and manifests itF<иlf in all tlie warm springs. 'Vood and provisions in aburrdancf' can be ea8ily obtained here. "' atcr is plenty, but not sr1 nиaclily procured. A very short llistance back from the coast line i;.1 a range of rugg<'d hills, over 2,000 fret high, forming part of the Sierra Concepcion, (sometimes called the Siena San Inez,) \Yhosc si(1es ano spaffl'ly conи.rPll with timber, and through some of whose gullies and gorges pass small streams abounding in the finest trout. :From others i8sue warm springs having a temperature of about 117░ Fahrenh<'it., and highly imprL'gnatPd with snlphuretted hydrogen. The height of the springR by barom:>tric ID'.;asurcment i;; about 1.200 feet. They lie behind the village of :Montecito, ea~twanl of Santa Barbara. 'l'he coast trail to San Francisco paescs aloug the 8hore for a distance of 15 01и 20 miles to the Gaviota pass; thence inland to the Santa Inez vall('y, wl1id1 1иuns 1warly pnrallel witl1 tLe coa~t. Regular communication Ly steamers and sailing vessels is maintained with Sau FrnnciRco and otlu,r ports. In L.542 Cabrillo Yi8ited this place and found great numbers of Indians, who camp off to his ships in large canoes, and were quite hospitable. Close to shore he found an Indian town with "casas grarules." To it he gave the name r~ueblo de lo:; Can<las.

'J.'lte simoom.-The only instance of the simoom on this coast, mentioned either in its histOl"y or traditions, was that occurring at Santa Ba1иbara, on Friday, the 17th of June, .1 S59. The temperature during the morning was between 750 and 80░, and gradually and regularly increar;cd until about one o'clock p. m., when a blast of hot air from the northwest swept suddenly over the town and struck the inhabitants with terror. It was quickly followed by others. At two o'clock the thermometer expo8ted to tlw air rose to 1330, and continued not lower than that point for nearly three hours, whill't the burning winc1 raised dense cloudR of impalpable dust. No human being ccиuld withstand the heat. .All betook themselves to their dwellings and caJ"efully closed every door and window. 'The thick adobe wall~ would have rcq uired days to han become warmed, and were consequently an admirable protection. Calves, rabbits, Lirds, &c., weiиe killed; trees were blighted; fruit was blasted and fell to the ground, burned only on one side; and gardens were ruined и .At five o'clock tlie thermometer fell to 122░, and at seven it stood at 77░. A fidherman, in th" channel in a.n open boat, came back with his arms badly blistered. It is recorded that on the 23d of June there was a remarkable 110t day over Stanislaus connty. The thermometer stood at 113░ in the sl1ade, and the wiud actually burned as from a hot oven. Binle dropped dead from the trees. At the entrance of the valley of El Coxo, ne11r Point.

This characteristic and remmkable headland, about 220 feet in height, lies at the weFtem entrance to the Santa Barbara channel. Ouce iieen, it wiH never be forgotten. "\Yhen made from the northward, or from the eastward, it rises as an island, but, upon ap1noach, is found to be a Ligh vromontory, stretching boldly into the ocean, and terminating abruptly. Tlw land behind it sinks comparatively low, and at first gradually, but soon rapidly rises to the mountains, which attain an elevation of about 2,500 feet. llt>tween three and four lrnrnhecl yanh ~nuth of tlie foce of tlie cape is a large rock nearly awash, upon which some of the California steamers lrnvc struck in very foggy weather.

of the ocean, northwest and east of the cape, would be highly instructivfl, as some charactcristi~s would naturally be expected from the abrupt change in the direction of the mountains and coast line. We have frequently seen vessels coming from the eastward with all sail set, and light airs from th" 11ortl1, in a Vt'ry little time reduced to Rlrnrt canv>1s upon approaching the ca1w, aud vessels from the northwest coming bcforn a spanking breeze lose it within a few miles after passing the cape into the channel. These la&t woulu be fortunate in reaching Santa Barbara in a day. v;и c have known a vessel to be three days working from San lluenaventura to Santa Barbara, whilst a tPn-knot breeze was blowiug west of Point Concepcion. During some summer seasons the fog is almost interminable, but more particularly amoug the island~. For the space of six weeks, with clear days and nights at the cape, the islands have been invisible; risiug, 11owever, to an elevation of 1,000 or 1,500 feet, the observer plainly sees the summits of the islands over the sea of fog which envelops them. ,,.,.hen the fog8 prevail, they generally roll in from seawaru at sunset, and clear away about ten o'clock next. morning. Point Concepcion was discovered by Cabrillo in 1542, and called Cape Galera. He placed it in latitude 36i!" N. It was afterwards named I'untci. de la Lirnpia Concq1cim1. The extent of shore-line from the southe1иn boundary to Point Concepcion is about 250 miles.
EL COXO.

Two miles east of Point Concepcion is tl1e anchorage of El Coxo, off thc entrance to the vallrиy of that name. This anchorage is a better one than that of Santrr Barbara, aml the kelp i& not so compact. After passing the point from the westward, at a distance of about three-quarters of a mil!>, run E. by K., and gradually rnund the bluff one mile distant from the cape, giving it a berth of half a mile; run on ;1 N.NE. course for three-quarters of a mile, wh"n the valley will open with a sand bi>ach off it. Anchor outside or inside the kelp. according to the choice of depth ; five fathoms 1eing obtained within a quarter of a mile of the shore, with haru, sandy bottom. Ten fathoms water will be found hnlf a mile from shore . .A hydrographic sketch of the anchorage was issued from the Const Survey Office in 1852. There is a large rancho at El Coxo, and it is one of the ve1иy best tracts for grazing. The beef ha;; a finer flavor and more delicacy than any we have met. wit.It on tl1e l'.oa"t.

The name El Canal de Santa Barbara was given hy Vizcaino, in December, 1602, to the narrowest part of the channel lying east and west, and about 24 leagues in length. Until the Coast Survey first -examined in detail the islands lying off the main, between San Diego and Point Concepcion, nothing aceumte was known of their number, peculiarities, extent, or position. Upon all maps, of as recent date as 1850, an island called San Juan was laid down, and upon a map of the republic of :Mexico, compiled in the United States, and dated 1847, we Бnil no less than twelve large islands, the positions and extent of which are most grotesquely erroneous. The island of San .!Higuel, the most western of the Santa Barbara group, is placed 70 miles SE. of Point Concepcion, instead of 23 miles SE. by S. ~ S. 'l'he same general remarks will apply tu the coast line as thereon represented. 'l'liree large rivers are made to fiow into the sea between Santa Barbara and San Diego bay, wl1ich is increased in size to 20 miles by l 5, and running north, whilst two others rival it in extent. A Russian chart pulilished in 1848 has a bay and

river on tl1c cast side of Point Dume. The geographical positions given previous to the Co11st Survey operations 11re remarkably erroncous. \Ye n'collrd wdl, иwl1en corning upon tl1is cna~t. nf finding in good nautical authority Point Concepcion over six miles distant from the latest determination in latitude; and we ha~c heard of more than one vessel reaching California with only a school atlas for a chart. In Fin<llay's Directory for 1he Pacific Ocean, published late in 1851, we find a description of tl1e already mentionecl San Juan island, but it does not give it a very definite location. It may not he uninteresting to state lww the error lws hPcn l"'rpP1m1ted. The first notice we can find of this island is its discovery by l\Iartinez, in 1789, on his passage from Monterey to San Blas. The next time it turns up is in Vancouver, vol. II, page 474, wherA the following account ie given: "~.\t the distance of about eigl1t 1eaguPs, somewhere alwut N. 55░ W., or K. 60░ "\Y. from Point de la Loma, by a very u1,1certain estimation, is situated an islancl called .St. John's, between which and the coast we pmised without seeing it, [although he previously states l1aving seen San Clemente and Santa Catalina,] nor did we oh><ern' it while we remained at anchor, excepting on one very clear evening, when it was seen from the l'residio [of Ran DiPgo] at a time when l was nnprovitled with a compass or a0y other means of ascertaining its direction, and was therefore only able to guess at its situation. "It apjleared to !Je low and flat; is hut seldom seen from the Presidio of San Diego, and was undiscovered until recn by Martinez, a frw years before, in one of his excursions along the coast." Ao Yancouver lrns 1ilotted tl1iF island on the line from Point Loma to Ran Clernrmte, and as it i8 generally so plact><l, we have no hesitation in m<suming that, during peculiar states of the atmosphere, the top of San Clemente or of Santa Catalina has been mistaken fOI" another and intermediate island. Having visited and examinecl San Clemente, Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, Santa Cruz, and San Miguel, иweи found them efferiug no inducements for agrieulture, and "\'ery few, indeed, for raising stock, while there are so many advautugc's ou tlw main. In :i fow words, we may characterize their disadvantages as want of water, all(! w:mt of futи], wi1h high, bold, and n1gged sides, which in mauy places bt>eome precipitous. The rnrfuce of San :Miguel nnd Santa Itosa is rolli11g, and covered with graBs and bushes; the mountains of Santa Catali11a almost inaccessible, and San Nicolas, mid San ClPmente, corn1rnser1 of coarse samhtone, presenting a clry, 8andy, aud ~tcrilc nspect. . On tluи chnrt of tl1e Nl:JFt from San Dicиgo to San Francisco, published by the United States Coast Sarvey in 1853, a remarkable ancl beautiful exhibition of the paralIPlism between the islands and the adjacent coust is presented. The fonr islands, Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Ilol"a, and Sati Miguel, with tlrn rocks seven miles W. by N. from tlw latler, lying broad off the coaEt between Ran Buenaventura and Point Concepcirm, lrnYe their longer axes Jiarallel to the trend of tlie shore-line, which is the general direction of !he Sierra Conception immediately behind it. In Yizcaino's voyage, this paralleli8m was noted west of Santa Catalina, "whenи a regular row of islands exist, five or six leagues distant from each otht>r, all populous, ancl the inhabitants trailing with each other and the main, and the islands following each other in the same direction a~ the main land." Corte~ sl1oal, the islands of Santa Catalina, San Clemente, San Nicolas, with John Begg's rock, seven miles from its northern extremity, have their longRr axes N"rи Ly ,Ц., aml parallel to each other, wl1ilst the sland of Santa Barbara iH on tlie prolongation of the longer axis of San Clemente. In the third parallel the direction become8 perpendicular to the first described, for from latitude 33░ 05 1 N. the trend of the coast and hills southward. through the longer axis of Point Loma, will pass through Los Coronados, although the islands lie NvV. witli respect to each other. Navigators, in making the Srrnta Barbara channel from tlie northwest, readily e~timate their approach in thick foggy weather hy the peculiar odmи of the bitumen which, issuing from a large pit on the shore about eiglit mil"~ west of Santa Barbara and floating upon the water, works agai1;st the summer winds far beyond l'oint ConcPpcion. This set to the we8tward is found to exist for about four miles off shore, and ru11s at a maximum veloci1y of a mile and a half per hour. Further out the current is variable, but even there its greatest velocity is attained when running to the westward. J<'rom Point Concepcion it strikes to tl1e southward and westward, being doubtless influenced by a current from the upper col\Bt, Vancouver is the first who calls attention to the bitumen, in the following language, vol. II, page 449: "The surface of the sea, which was perfectly smooth and tranquil, was covered with a thick slimy substance, wliicb, when separated or dieturbed by any little agitation, becaBJe very luminous, whilst the light breeze that came principally from the shore brougl1t with it a strong smell of tar, or of some such resinous substance. The next morning the sea had the appearance of diPsolved tar floating upon its surface, which covered the

ocean in all dirPctions within tl1e limits of our view, and indicated that in the neighborhood it waE' not rnlijPct to much agitation." 'l'he following remarks of Sir Edward Belcher, in October, 1839, are taken from tl1e Voyage of tlte Rulphur, vol. I, pagf' 320: "Off tliis part of the coast to the westward fof Santa Barbara] we experienced a very extraordinary E<ensation, as if the ship was on fire, and afrer a very clo1<e investigation attributed it to a scent from the shore, it being more sensible on deck than below; and the land breeze confirming thi~. it occurred to me that it might arise from naphtha on the surface."-See remarks, ]Jage Santa R1rhara. Among thre isla111l~, as far"" San Nicolas, the current ruus to the southwar<l, and there remains little doubt that tl1e steamship "\Yinfield Scott wns set out of her cmusc, and upon Auacapa, by tlii~ current. On the Cortes ~hoal it freq1wnllJи runs ag-ainet the K"\\'. wind 11t t IH' rate of nrnrly two miles per hour. At otluиr times it lias been found to run in an oppo'4ite direction nearly a8 ftrnug. A prdiminary c11art of the eastern entrance to the Sm1ta Harl.mm channel accompanied the annual report of the SuperintemlPnt of the Coast Survey for 1857. It may not be here amiss to call attention to the abundance of mackerel found in the clrnnn..I. \Ye have seen the water fairly alive with them, and have canght them by hundreds. Crayfi~h of a very large size are found in giиeat numbers along the 8hores. The rainy season comrn<>nces in tl1e r-a.rly pmиt of Xovr-mlie1и. au<l contitrnPs until the middle of l\Iarch. The quantity of rain that fall~ rlors not avernge over Hi indll'~, but some seasons are marked by exces~ive drought. During the winter SE. gales prevail, and sometimee during the summer months southerly weatl1cr will bring up heavy rain.
CORTES SHOAL.

Commencing 11t the southward, the Бrst object that claims our atlf>ntinn is thr d11ngerous bank and rock called the Cortes Bhoal, bearing S\V. i W. from the southenst end of the i~land of Sau Clemente, and <listant 46 mile,s. 'l'he extent of this bauk has been sounded out carefully. and found much greater tlum the early examinations led us to snppose. 'Vithru t!1e limit~ of the 50-fiithorn curw tl1e general trend is p:irallel with the island~ of Santa Catalina, San Clemente, and San Xicolas, a111l it streEches about 17 miles, from latitude 32░ 24' N., longitude 118░ 59f "\\'.,to latitu<le 32░ 32' N., longitude 119░ 17:1' "-Tии hut curves slightly to the southwest. It has an avem~e and nearly uniform width of 3:1 miles. 'l'he nature of tlm bottom is hard, composed of white sand, broken ~hells, and fine coral at the southeast portion;; and Band, with broken shells, at the northwest. The shoalest and most dangerous part is that knvwn as the, Bishop rock, lying five miles from the southeast tail of the bank, and having but 22' fathoms of wa:er upon it. Around this danger the depth increases gradually, aud iu an extent of 22' miles in the general direction of the bank reaches but 15 fathoms. The geographical position of these rocks is, approximately: .,.,

To th.- northwestward of tl1is latter shoal spot the depth is nearly uniform at 49 fatlwms for mile~. and between it and the Bishop rock the depth is uniform at about 43 fatltoms. Upon this bank the current is variable, frequently setting against the strong N\Y. winds ll-ith a velocity (If nearly two miles per hour, and producing at all times a heavy swell, and even in moderate weather breaking heavily upon the rocks. In passing over the bank at night we have been sensible of our proximity to it by the 1ncrea.sed swell. In the detailed examination of 18.56 it was found that the general set of the current was to the southward and eastward, and the greatest velocity a mile and a half per hour; but no statement' il!I made concerning the prevailing wind.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The existence of this bank had been reported several times, and the following positions assigned to it: S1dft's island, latitude 33░ OS'; longitude 119░ 06', as seen by Captain Aulick, U.S. N. Rock, latitude 32░ 30 1 ; longitude 119░ 06'; no authority. nauk, latitude 32░ 28'; longitude LIS 0 42'; no aut110rity. It lies in the direct route urrnи followed by the P:mruna and San Francisco steamships, and was discovered by Captain Cropper, of tlic ~tcam~bip Cortes, in .March, IS53. His- position was determined by bearings upon San Nicola8 aud San Clem\Oute, and wa~ very close, being within a mile of the latest and best assigned place. Ile says that the water around it was in violent commotiou, and thrnwn up su<ldenly in columns at regular intervals of four or five minutes. At iirst he thought he saw breakers; and occasionally the water broke as on a reef, but he became confident that the disturbance was owing to submarine volcanic agency. 'l'he ~pecinwus of the bottom uegatiYe this idea. Ile found his depth of water reduced from 42 fathoms иto 9. which convinces us that he was on the shoal spot, about the middle of the bank, and saw the water breaking upon the Bishop rock, the same appearance that he witnessed having been seen many times since by others, and the nature of the rocky bottom and clepth of water supporting the assumption. The position of the hank was afterwards more closely determined by the commander of the steamship Pacific; but in the Coast SurvC'y operations the IO-fathom spot was found, and the surveying schooner used in that duty was anchored on it fiYC <lays. Attention was snbsequently called to a more extended examination of the vicinity by the clipper ship S. 8. Bishop, (now Grey Eagle,) of J>hiladclphia, striking upon the rock, siuce called by her name, (I855,) and, under unfavorable circumstances, two points of rock were supposed to exist, to which a11proximate positions were assigned. In 1856 the bank was sounded out to the extent of 130 square miles; ancl from a consideration of the highly favorable circumstances under which this last survey was made, confidence is expre,;sed that the iioint ()f rock ahove mcntionc<l is the only one existing; but as it is Yery difficult to find detached single points of rock below the surface in a sea-way, we shall not be surprised if others be eventually found. At all events the prudent navigator will givr~ tl1is bank a good berth. Its existence forcibly suggests the probability that other submarine ridges lie parallel to the coast.

ISLA~D

OF SAN CLEMENTE.

Tl1is, like all the islm1ds of the Santa Barbara channel, is high and bold, the southern end being the higher, and gradually falling to the northward. The general trend of the island is N'W. by '\V.; its length 22 miles, with an average breadth of two miles, and .50 miles in circuit. . The southwest point of the island bears '\V. ~ S. from Point Loma, distant 60 miles. At the northwest end iH a small indentation of the shore-line forming an anchorage, haYing a width of three-quarters ofa mile, by half a mile in depth, with soundings decreasing from 12 fathoms, on the line of a large rocky islet at the side to a point E. by S., to four and five fathoms close in shore. Kelp will be found in 10 fathom3, hut tlie bottom is tolerably regular and hard. It is anything but a pleasant or safe anchorage in bad NW. weather, an<l even in heavy 8outherly weather the swell must roll in disagreeably. A hydrographic 1iketch of it was issucrl from the Coast Survey Office in 1852. Under the SE. cud of the island anchorage may be had in the deepest part of the indentation, but the bottom is rocky and irregular. The SE. point is a vast sandstone pyramid; and when it is brought to bear north, and the shore three-quarters of 11 mile distant, the anchorage will lie W. by N. ~ N., one and three q narter mile inside the kelp, in 10 to 15 fathoms, and one-third of a mile from the narrow sand beach at the foot of the cliffs. Outside of the kelp the depth ranges from 10 to 30 fathoms. This anchorage will afford protection in lieavy northwest weather. .A hydrographic sketch and view of it accompanies tl1e annual Coast Survey report for 1856. 'l'he soundings around the iElland show a depth of from 36 to 130 fathoms close in shore, except off the northwest point, from which a reef makes out about a mile. The Coast Survey secondary astronomical station was at the northwest anchorEge, on the grassy rise. just inside of the high-water line, and horn S. 17░ E. from the north point of the rock islet before mentioned. Its geographical position is :

Very few trees arc found, and the aspect is stcTile. 'l'his island was discovered by CaLrillo in 1542, and called by him San Salvador, after one of his two vessels. The present name was given by Vizcaino in 1602.
ISLAND OF SANTA CATALINA.

This island rises to a height of about 3,000 fpet, and is remarkable for the great transverse break or depression, five mileR from t11e northern en!. running partly tlirough it, and forming an anchorage or cove at each side. The land connecting these is Ye1иy low, say not over 30 feet; but the hilh risp up on each siclc two or three thou&and feet, and, when sighted from the north or eouth, the whole appears like two very high islands. The view on the Coast Survey chart of 1852 shows this very beautifully, and is highly characteristic. The general trend of the island is \V. by K. if :K.; its length 17:\ rnilee, with an avewge breadth of four miles to the southern part, aud two miles to the uortLern, while the shore-line amounts to about 42 miles. The depression in the island bears S.S\Y. from Point Fermin, and is di:<tant IS! miles. 'l'he harbor or cove on the southern side, five miles from the northern end, is only about one-third of a mile in width, but its approaches are bold, and, so for a8 knowu, free frnrn 11id1lLиn dnngers. 'To find it, run along the S\Y. sicle of the island and make the depression; then i'taud in for the opening, keepiug a little left of mid-channel until a third of a mile iusicle nf the heads. Frnm thence keep in mid-channel until abreast of tl1e long, low point on the riglit, and anchor in five fathomf', rnft bottom. 'fliere is a depth of three fatlwrns inside of tl1e luw point, with lmrd bottom, but not room (и11ongl1 for a vessel to swillg. If tLe wind is blowing from the NW., vessels will lose it at the l1eads, aud perhaps nиquhe to be towecl in. 'l'hc anchornge on tht> nodh Fide of tht> dPpression iF also small, with a reef in the CPntre and two large outlying rocks. A steamer could run in on the west side of the rocks, and anchor off the low beach in 10 fathoms, when the Teef would lie N. by E. from her, diFtant an eighth of a mile. Small craft will l1ere find protrmtion from the prevailing wid10, but experience difficulty in getting out, as tl1crc is always a swell setting in, and the wind blows in flaws and eddies on account of the high hills. Between the two points forming the anchorage the distance. is half a mile, and the dPpth one third. Tlie soundings around the iRlanrl show bold water, from 19 to 7 5 fathoms, clm<e in slrnre, with no outlying rocks except off the north cove. 'l'he sLores are rocky, and on tlrn southern side fearfully abrupt, but on the northern shore there are several inclentations, where boats may laucl at almost nny season. Deep arnl precipitous gulches are formed by the riclges of rock running diagonally across tlie island from NE. to S\Y., and occasionally a small Yallcy varies tl1e scene. Four or five settlers cultivate theFe spots, but their inconsidernble extent prf'cludes tlJC realizing of anything beyond a bare 8nstenance. About rnid\rny between tlie NW. extremity of the island and the great break there is a. spring of good water, aud at the SE. point good water has been obtained by sinking wells to a depth of fifty feet or more, but in the intermccliate places water found at the same depth is brackil'h. There is a large pom1 on the low land hetwcen the anchorages, but the water is very brackish. Sl"!'ub-oak is obtained for firewood, and a growth of tlrnrny bushes covers the whole island, rendering travelling very difficult, The island was partially stocked with cattl'l and sheep, and at one time vast numbers of wild goats abounded, but they have helped to supply the California market with fresh meat. In l 863 soll,)e. old lead mines were J'ediscovcred; the ore is described as argentiferous g11lenn.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

This island was discovered by GaLrillo in 154-2, 1tnd called by liim La Victoria, after one of his two Yessels. It received its pres<>ut name from Yizcnino in Deeem Ler, 1602, when it was thickly inhabited by a people reported to be vuy iugcnions, particnlarly in pilfering and concealing; some examples of which accom11lisl11nrnts thr;y gave the Spaniards. Padre de la Ascension, who accompanied this expedition, gives very particular descriptions of a kind of temple to the sun, with images and idols, found near the two coves. Hydrographic sketches of the anchorages have been pnbliBhed by the Coast Survey.
ISLA.ND OF SANTA BARBARA.

This is one of the only two small islands of the Santa BarLara gmup. It lies on t111; line between the north end of San Clemente and the east end of Santa Cruz, ancl almost exactly half way between them. Trom the north end of Santa Catalina it bears Vt'. by S., distant 23 miles. The extent of the island would not exceed two miles of ~hore-line; its elevation at the highest part is about 500 foet, and the top has an area of about thirty acres c~vercd with soil, but no water is found, and not a vestige of wood. The Hlmre~ are rocky and abrupt, presenting on the northe~st and south side;; perpendicular cliffs exposed to the full force of tl1e ocean swell. Landing is at all times difficult and dangerous. The water around it is deep, and there are no outlying rocks. It is said to be much more enveloped in fogs than the neighboring islands.

OF' S;\N NICOL.AS.

Of the channel islands this is the most distant from the coast, as well as the driest and most sterile. It is about 600 feet l1igb, ab1иupt, and, like San Clemente, comparatively flat-topped, but falling to the southern end. The sides are bold and precipitous, and composed of coarse sandstone. Its general direction is W.Kt\'.; its length is eight miles, with an average and nearly uniform width of 3J! miles, whilst the extent of shore-line iH about 22 miles. The north 1)(1i11t of the island lJPars SE. by E. from Point Fe1иmin, distant G7 miles; the line passing one mile south of tl1e island of Santa Barbara . .At the north end of San Nicolas heavy breakers make out two miles and a half, and the soundings towards tl1e Brgg rock show irregular and rncky bottom. Breakers also extend from the southern point to the distance of a mile and three-quarters, according to Kellet. This i11 doubtless the case in heavy weather. The soundings around the island show depths varying from 10 to 48 fathoms. Off the southeast point, which is low and sandy, vessels may anchor in 10 fathoms, hard bottom, with a Clirrent running steadily to the southward, which makes the landing bad, as the surf cuts the beach at an
acut~ angh~.

It was named after the ship John Begg, which struck upon a reef neaiи it, September 20, 1824, and was nearly lost. The foul bottom is covered with kelp. The position of the rock relative to the island of Sau Nicolas is shown on the general chart of reconnaissance published by the Coast Survey in 1852.
ISLAND OF
A~ACAPA.

This is, in fact, a curiously formed group of three islands, extendiug in a nearly E.XE. direction, their entire length being Бve miles. The west end of Anacapa is a peak 930 feet in 11cight, with a base of over two miles by three-quarters of a mile. This is separated from the middle island by a gap ten feet wide, through which boats can pase. The middle i:>land is nearly two miles long by 500 yards wide, whilst the eastern ii-lland i8 little over a mile long by 500 yards wide. 'I'he gap separating the middle and eastern islands is over 200 yards wide, but so completely filled with rocks as to be impassable for boats, which can, however, land on the north side of the island. . The west end of .Anacapa is 4t miles from the eastern point of the island of Santa Cruz, and bears E. ! N. from it. Tl1e deptl1 of water hetweC'n thC'se islands is 30 fathoms, with a very regular bottom composed of grey sand, coral, and shells. The eastern end of the island bears SE. {i E. from the Santa Barbara light, distant 28 miles, and from Point Hueneme or Conversion, the ncarnst point of the mainland, StV. by S. k S., distant 9! miles. Anaeapa is in latitude 34░ 01 1 N., and l1etween longitndes 119░ 19' and 119░ 24' ,V. l:pou it the site for a ligltt-lwuse has been recommended by the Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey. 'l'he island is composed of coarse, dark grey sandstone, very rotten and crumbling. Tlie sides are perpendicular, and from 250 to 300 feet high. The main peak is marked on the north side hy Hevcral deep gnlcl1es, with almost vertical sides runniug from the smnmit to the bluff. The w lwle formation is filled with innumerable cavities, giving it the appearance of an enormous blackened honeycomb. At the eastern extremity is found a very beautiful arch in one of the outlying rocks. This is well shown in the view accompanying the Coast Survey chart of the vicinity of the island of Anacapa publi~herl in 18ii5. 'T'he soil is loose and thin, producing only a few dwarfed species of cactus and a thick-leaved succulent plant common to the sea-coast in dry sandy localities. Not a drop of water is to be found on the island. Anacapa is a place of great resort for the seal, sea lion, and formerly of the otter, but the latter have been nearly all killed off. It was on this island that the steamship 'Yinfield Scott ran ashore during a dense fog at midnigl1t, December 2, 1853, in calm weather. The vessel was <"teaming at full speed, ancl ran between and n11on the rocks with such force that she remained fast by the bow until heavy weather broke her up. 'I'hP course of the steamer had been taken from Point Concepcion, but without a knowledge of the currents. Vancouver, in his narrative, calls this island Enneeapah, am1 repeatedly mentions it l1y that name; but upon the chart of his survey and explorations it is engraved Enecapah, which has given 1иit1e to every variety of spelling. Old Indiaus at the present time pronounce it En-nce-ah-pagh', with a very strong guttural intonation. A chart of Anacapa and the eastern end of Sauta Crnz was published by the Coast Survey in 1856, and a preliminary map 8howing its relation to the mainland in 18{;7.
ISLAND OF SANTA CRUZ.

This island is the largest of the ch:mncl group, and lies broad off the coast opposite the town of Santa Barbara, at a distance of 20 miles. Its general direction is east and west, witl1 a length of 2 l miles and an average width of four miles, while the extent of its shore-line is not less than 53 miles. On the northern side of the island, and near the middle, tlw shore makes a moilerately dePp curve, forming a roadstead called Prisoner's ltarhor, at the opening of a valley, wliere plenty of wood and water can be obtained. Anchorage may be had a quarter of a mile off the middle of the beach in 15 fathoms, sandy bottom; but there is no protection from the hcaYy swell setting in with a northwester. lt mmt, however, aiford excellent refuge in southeast weather. A hydrographic sketch of the liarbor was puhlishcd by the Coast Survey in 1852. The soundings around the island show deep water cloec to the sl1ore; but there arc rockP. showing r1uitc plainly one mile from the southwest point. A cliart 8howing the l1ydrography of the enbtcrn end of the island was published by the Coast Survey in 1855.

Its eastern part is extremely irregular, barren, and destitute of water; and the surface of the northeastern portion is thickly strewn with large angular pieces of stone, broken as if with a liammer. Several species of cactus and some of the coarse grasses flourish. The only wild animal found here is a small gray fox, of which there are great numbers.

'.l'his island was called Juan Rodriguez by Fcrrclo, who commanded the ships of Cabrillo after his death, which took place either in Prisoner's harbor, or in Cuyler's harbor (island of San Miguel.) '.l'he greater probability rests with the former, a:< tlwre they could obtain water, and oak wood for repairs, &c., while neither is to be had in the last-mentioned harbor, except water, during the rainy season. The group comprising Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel, was discovered and called San Lucas by Cabrillo in 1542.
ISLAND OF SANTA ROSA.

This is the middle island of the group off the coast between Santa Barbara and Point Concepcion. Its general shape is that of a parallelogram, with the direction of the longer axis almost exactly east and west, and fifteen miles in length ; and the shorter north and south, giving it a width of ten miles. The extent of shore-line is about 42 miles. On the northwest side of the islam], and midway between the north and west points, a reef extends out for a distance of a mile and a quarter. There is a good passage between Santa Cruz and Santa Hosa, with a width of fiye miles, and one between it and San .l'tliglilel of four miles. Both passages are frequently used by the California and Panama steamships. The soundings around the island do not show as deep water as around the others. On the northwest and northeast sides from fifteen to twenty fathoms are found two miles from shore, but on the southeast and southwest sides the water is much deeper. The outline of the island is bold, but not so high as Santa Cruz. The hills are rolling, and covered with coarse grass and bushes. No harbors exist around its shores, which are steep and broken. The relative position of Santa Rosa in the group of the Santa Barbara islands is shown on the reconnaissance chart of the Coast Survey published in 18!i2.

ISLAND OF SAN MIGUEL.

'rl1is is t11e western of tl1e Santa Barbara Cl1annel island&, its longer axis lying E. ~ N., and 7~ miles in length, with an average breadth of 2z miles. The extent of shore-line is 21 miles. Its western extremity is bold and narrow, gradually increasing in breadth until it attainP 3~ mileA. As seen from the wuthwestward, tl1is end of the island appears to be several hundred feet in heigl1t, and composed of sand rlunPR, tliercin differing from all thr other islands. The eastern face is nearly straight for two miles; the southern face is nearly straight along its whole length, with high, abrupt shores; and from 30 to 37 fathoms water are found close in shore. On the NE. side of the island is the small bay called Cuylcr's harbor, off which lies a rock or islet more than a fourth of a mile long, and several hundred feet high. From this islet to the deepest part of the harbor the distance is a mile and a quarter, a11d the coarse S\V. Close under the western side of the harbor is anchorage iu six fathoms, secure from every wind except the north, which rarely blows here. The eastern part of the bay is full of rocks and reefs, and ought to be avoided. The reef in the middle of the bay bears S"W. from the west end of the islet, and is distant half a mile. It is the same distance from the west point of the bay, near the anchorage, ancl bear~ J<J. l1y S. SW. by S. S. from the west encl of the i~let is a rock, and rocky bottom, distant a third of a mile; and on the same line another, half a mile distant. The southern part of the islet is about half a mile from the east shore of the bay. The bay shores arc high, steep, and rolliug, and covered with coarse grass and bushes. 'J'here is no water here in rnmmer, but during the winter water drains down the gully at the beach in the middle and southern part of the harbor. A hydrographic sketch of Cuyler's harbor was published by the Coast Survey in 1852. The western point of the island bears S. by E. i E., distant 25 miles, from Point Concepcion, and SE by S. t S., distant 35 miles. from Pnint Arguello. A sea-coast ligltt has been reported upon for this point of the island, and the subject referred to the Light-house board. Sheep and some stock have been plaeed upon San Miguel, lmt tl1e succes8 of the experiment has been doubtful-certainly unremunerative. A peculiar bobtail fox is found l1e1иe. The Coast Survey secondary astronomical station is on the S'\Y. part of Cuyler's harbor, about forty feet up, on the side-hill. Its geographical position is:

'Vhcn the moon's declination is greatest these differences are 2.6 feet and 3.6 feet, respectively. 'l'he average difference of tl1c highest high and lowest low waters of the same day is 5.8 feet, and when the moon's declination is greatest, 6.8 feet.

To :find the times of high and low waters :first compute them for San Diego, and, from the numberf' thus obtained, subtract 19m. for Cuyler's liarbor. San Miguel was discovered by Cabrillo in 1542, and Cnyler's harbor is supposed hy some to bl' the bay in which he wintered. He died January 5, 1543, liaving directed Bartolome .F'errelo, his pilr>t, to asrnme the command of the expedition and continue the exploration as far north a~ possible. J<'errelo aftenvards named the island in whose harbor his commander had wintered, Juan Rodriguez. It is sometimes called San Bernardo. Cuyler's harbor wa.<1 named by the U.S. Coast SmTey in 18.52.

Two rocks, showing themselves well above water, lie KW. by W. from the western extremity of San Miguel, the larger bei11g distant five miles. It hPars R. E., distant 22 miles, from Point Concepcion, and S.SE., distant 30 miles, from Point Arguello. Off the inner and smaller rock a reef extends a short distance to the southward and westward. Veep water is found around the rocks, and vessels may pass between them. The total extent of shore-line of the Santa Barbara islands is about 2::12 miles.

FROM POINT CONCEPCION, NOR'l'HWARD.

The first headland to the northward of I'oint Concepcion is Point Arguello,"' distant 12 miles, and bearing KW. by \V. \V. The shore i~ bold and compact, curving slightly to the eastward between the two points, and the mountains immediately behind are not less than 3,000 feet in height. Two or three hundred yards off Point .Arguello are some detached rocks, upon which the steamship Yankee Blade struck and was lost on the 1st of October, 1854, and 415 persons perished. From this point the trend of the coast is N"V. to Point Reyes, 240 miles distant, passing tangent to Point Sur in latitude 36░ 19t' :N"., and inside the South }'arallon. Eight miles north of Point Arguello a small stream empties into the ocean. It was considered by Vancouver the largest he had seen south of the Columbia, but it is insignificant and unimportant. He states tlmt on the old Spanish chart~ it is called the Rio de San Balardo. On a French chart of 1841 it is called the San Geraldo ; on a recent Russian chart we find it called the river Henardo ; on the Coast Survey charts it is designated La Pu.rissima, from the mission La Purissima Concepcion, situated a few miles inland. On the State map of California it is called the San Ines. It rises in longitude 119░ 20', about 15 miles from the coast, and runs parallel therewith behind the Sierra Concepcion. The first point northward of Point Arguello is Point Purissima, off which makes a reef about a fourth of a mile to the S.SW. This is known on the coast as Point. Pedernales, signifying Point of l<'lints, but now generally and erroneously printed Pedro Nalcs. Formerly it was called San l'edro Nolasco. Near thi8 point the steamship E<lith was lost in 1849. 'The State survey of California places l'edernales only two miles to the northward of .Arguello. Between Points Sal and Purissima a small stream called the Guyamas opens. From Point .Arguello N. by \V. %\V., and distant 19 miles, is Point Sal,"' which is marked by streaks of yellow sand, except at the extreme point. The extmmity is formed hy high, round, black rocks, off which are several sunken rocks, extending half a mile to the southward and westward. This stretch of the coast is very similar to that behind Concepcion aud .A1иguello, but, after passing Point Sal, the mountains fa!} back, aud the shore is formed of sand-hills. The general bend hence is north, until the shore commences sweeping westward to form the bay of San Luis Obispo, and the shores become l1igh and abrupt. The line of equal magnetic иiиariation of 140 east cuts the coast line in latitude 35░ 01' N., and crosses the meridian of 121░ 30' W. in latitude 33░ 6-52' N. It moves annually southward about a mile and a half

z

SAN LUIS OBISPO.

This bay is an open roadstead, exposed to the southward, and even during heavy northwest weather a bad swell rolls in, rendering it an uncomfortable anchorage. The landing is frequently very bad, and often impracticable, but the best place is in the mouth of the creek, keeping the rocks at its mouth on the starboard hand. Fresh water may be obtained at a small stream opening on the beach half a mile west of the creek. In the coarse sandstone bluff between tlicse two places are found gigantic fossil remains. Off Point San L11is, which forms the SW. part of the bay, are some rocks, and in making the anchorage vessels should give this point a berth of half a mile, passing in six or eight fathoms; nm on a N. by E. course, and ancl1or three-fourths of a mile from shore in six fathoms, sticky bottom; four fathoms can be got about a fourth of a mile from the beach. In winter, anchor far enough out to clear Point San Luis if a southea;;1ter 8hould come up. During southerly weather landing is frequently effected at the watering place, when impracticable at tl1e creek.

The magnetic variation, 14░ 17' east, in February, 1854; yearly increase, 1'. Tides.-The corrected establishment, or mean interval between the time of the moon'R transit and the time of high water, is Xii. VIIIm. The mean rise and fall of tides is 3.6 feet; of spring tides, 4.8 feet; and of neap tides, 2.4 feet. The mean duration of tl1e flood is 6/t. 2f1m., and of the el1b 5h. 58m. The average difference between the corrected establishments of the a. m. and p. m. tides of the same day is lh. 24m. for liiA"h water, and lh. Om. for low water. The differences when the moon's declination is greatest are 2h. Om., and lli. 28m., respectively. The average difference in height of these two tides i~ 1.5 foot for the high waters, and 2.0 feet for the low waters. When the moon's declination is greatest, those differences are 2.0 feet and 3.1 feet, respectively. The average difference of the higher high and lower low waters of the same day is 5.4 feet, and when tl1e moon's declination is greatest 6.1 feet. The higher high tide in the twenty-four hours occurs about 9/i. 32m. after the moon's upper transit, (southing,) when the moon's declination is north, ancl alwnt 2/i. 54m. before, wheu south. The lowe1и of the low waters occurs about sev-en hours after the higber high tide. 'l'he greatest observed difference between the two low waters of one day was 4.0 feet, and the greatest difference between the higher high and lowt:r low waters of one day was 8.3 feet. To find the times of high and low waters, first compute them for San Diego, and to the times thus obtained add 30m. for San Luis Obispo. The town of San Luis Obispo, which takes its name from the mission of that name, founded September 1, 1772, is not on the bay, but is situated about ten miles in the interior, in tlie middle of an extensive and excellent grazing country. Communication is maintained with San Franci8ca and other ports by regular steamers and lines of sailing packets. The bay was discovered by Cabrillo in 1542, and called by him Todos Santos. A preliminary chart of tl1f' harbor of San Luis Obispo waR iesued from the Coast Survey Office in 1852, 'l'o the northwest of the Bay of San Luis Obispo rises to a great height the Jllonte de Buchon, whicl1 is readily distinguished in coming from the northward or southward. We have been informed by old otter hunters on this coast that there exists a sunken rock about cigl1t miles S.SW. from Point San Luis, and furthermore that tl]('y had found kelp upon it in four fatl10ms. On the old Spanish charts an island appears laid down in that direction, but distant about eight leagues. One of the Pacific mail steamships laid to in a southeast gale and thick fog off Point Coneepcion, and drifting to the northward cnme unexpectedly npon a sunken rock, upon which the sea was breakh1g heavily. The commander supposed the vessel to be then off Point Sal, and had so plotted tl1e rock upon his cl1art; but upon being informed of the alleged existence of a rock off San Luis Obispo, he was satisfied that he had been near it, but unfortunately had no opportunity of determining liis position. This locality demands a thorough examination, as it is in the dhиect track of the whole California trade from San Francisco. From Point San Luis the coast trends in a straight line W.N\V., for a distance of eight miles, and close along the shore of this stretch are several large rocks. Thence the coast trends abruptly to the north, running to the high conical rock called El 1\!loro, distant eight miles-these two shores forming the seaward base of Mount Buchan. From El Moro the shore-line gradually trendll to the westward, thns forming a deep indentation or bay, called Los Esteros on the olcl Spanish charts, but designated as the Estero bay on the Coast Survey chart. It was discovered by Cabrillo in 1542, and here he obtained wood and water. Behind El 1\Joro arc several lagoons or streams, a:nd the high land retreats for some distance, leaving tJ1e shore low and sandy, while the north shore is rugged, and guarded by rocks. The NW. point of the bay is called Punta de los Esteros on

A view of El Moro is giYcn on the Coast Survey sheet for 1853. l~rorn Point Arguello, l'unta de los Esteros bears N"Tи by X., distant 53 miles. From Point Los Esteros to tlie western point of the anchorage of San Simeon the coast runs nearly straight N1V. by "\\'. for a <listance of 15 miles. 'l'he shores are not so bold as to the southward or northwar<l, and tlie mountains fall well back, leaving a fine rolling country of no great elevation, and well suited to agriculture. We have seen wild oats growing here over six feet in height-not one or two stalks, but in acres.
BAY OF SAN SIMEON.

This is a small expose<l roadstead, but affords tolerably good anchorage during northwest winds. The southwest point of the bay bears N1Y. by 1Y. from Point Esteros, and is distant 15 miles. The indentation of thf' slt0re-line forming th1и bay trends between N.N1V. to K. for half a mile, and tl1en swee11s away to the westward about a mile and a half, gradually taking a southeast direction. The land bchiml the bay is . comparatively low and gently rolling, the high hills retiring well inland. Vessels coming from the northward may run boldly round the S"\V. point, within a few hundred yards of the shore in eight or nine fathoms, round up to north and anchor anywhere off the sand beach, in five fathoms, hard bottom, and a little more than a quarter of a mile from shore. The beach is half a mile long, stretching well out, and rendering the landing disagreeable with any swell; but in such cases it is usual to land at the western part of thP beac11. Eastward of the sand beach the shore-line is bluff and guarded with rocks. Vessels .from the southward must make t'hort tacks dose in shore, or tlrny will assuredly miss it. The only sure marks for it are the Piedras Blancas, as will be hereafter shown. It was in this bay that the eteamship Pioneer put in leaking badly; was driven or dragged upon the beach, and after being abandoned by t11e underwriters was got off and carried to San Francisco. The bay affords not the slightest refuge in southerly weather. A hydrographic sketch of it "\ms published by the Coast Survey in 1852. In making this harbor from the northward vessels must sight the Piedras Blancas, (White Rocks,) four miles W. !l; N. of the SW. point of San Simeon. They arc two large white sharp-topped rocks, and nothing else like them is found on this part of the coa8t. 'l'he geographi~I position of the outer and larger rock is, approximately :

At a distance of 18 miles from these rocks the above-mentioned bearing cuts a bold bluff and rounded point called Punta Gorda, off which, and for two or three miles along the shore northward, there arc many rocks. This point is the Gape San lviartin of Cabrillo. He placed it in Jatitude 37░ 30' N.; but applying the correction obtained from his erroneous determination of San Diego, we obtain 35░ 501 N. as the position of San Martin, wl1icl1 is very nearly its proper latitude. As there is one p-0int under Cape Mendocino, more genemlly known as Punta Gorda, it is recommended that this point retain the name given to it by Cabrillo, especially as all his names have been cast aside.

Vancouver, in pas~ing down tl1e coast in 1793, thought this "small, high, rocky lump of land, lying nearly half a mile from the shore," was det<1.ch10d, and that it formed an island. The highest peak of the range bordering the coast lies six miles square in from Point Sur, and attains an elevation of 4,414 feet. A view of the point is given on the Coast Survey sheet of 1853. Still continuing on the same bearing, 57 miles from Piedras Blancas and 71-miles from Point Sur, another slightly projecting point is passed, about a mile to the eastward of the course. Thence the coast trends more to the eastward, running N.NW. for eight miles, to Point Cypress, and passing Point Carmel, the south point of Carmel bay. }'rom Point Arguello to Point Sur the bearing is N. 44 ░ \Y-, and the distance 120 miles. :From Point Sur to Punta de los Reyes the bearing is N. 43░ \V., ancl distance 118 miles. The mountains, which had fallen back behind Los Esteros, gradually approach the shore-line north of San Simeon, and about 10 miles north of Picdras Blancas they come down abruptly to the coa~t, and nm parallel with it to Point Carmel, forming the boldest anll most compact shore that we have yet passed, and attaining a uniform elevation of nearly 4,000 feet. These mountains were called by Cabrillo tl1e "Sierras Altas," but at present the range is known as the Sierra de Santa Lucia. From their abrupt faces we have seen cascades falling from a height of forty or fifty feet directly into the 8ca.
CARMEL BAY.

Between Point Cannel and Point Cypress, which are about three miles apart, lies the small, rocky and unsafe bay of Carmel. At the southern extremity is a small cove, sufficiently lanil-lockml and protectetl for small vessels. In the vicinity there is an extensive quarry of granite. and several small coasting vessels arc employed for its transportation to San Francisco; but there is so little space that they arc compelled to warp in and out by buoys placed at t11e entrance. Point CypTess, the north point of the Lay, is low, and covered with cypress to the water, and is the first wooded point met with in coming from the southward. The nppcr branches of the trees are spread out by the influence of the strong prevailing winds, and prefcnt a flat or umbrella-like appearance. The Mission del Carmelo is situated but a short distance from t11n ;;lioreR of the hay, aml can be seen from the water in certain directions. After the abolisl1ment of the Society of Jesus, in Lower California, by the emperor Charles III of Spain, with the transfer of the administration of the missions to the Dominican monks, and of the }lroperty to the Franciscan ordnr, the Visatador, Don Josef de Galves, of the latter order, in July, 1768, vhiited San Diego and Monterey, for the purpose of establishing mi,;siomи. Gn the 3d of June, 1770, he founded that of San Carlos de Monterey, now usm~lly called the Carmel mission. The name Rio Carmel was applied to the small !Stream emptying into Carmel bay, by Vizcaino, in December, 1602. From Point Cypress to Point Pinos the general direction of the shore is N. ! E., and the distance four miles.
POINT PINOS

makes out ::is a low rounding point, bringing the pines, with which it is covered, within a ~uarter of a mile of the shore, off which the rocks make out a quarter of a mile, and the line of three fathoms nearly half a mile, when the depth suddenly increases to 10 or 15 fathoms, and at a mile reaches 40 or 45 fathoms. The three-fathom line follows the shore within a third or half a mile into Monterey, whilst outside of that line the depth increases as suddenly as off the point.

BAY OF MONTEREY.

Point Pinos forms the southwest point of this bay, and Punta de la Santa Cruz, (forming the western Rhore of th<> anchorage of Santa Cmz,) the northwest point. A line joining these two points runs N. 27░ W., 19f miles, and the greatest wiclth of the bay, near the mouth of the Salinas river, is 9i} miles. From Point Pinos to the anchorage off the town of :Monterey, tlie course is E. Ly S. i S., and the distance three miles. The shore towards the town is rugged, composed of granite, and covered with a heavy growth of fir; but to the eastward of the town is a long, saudy beach, backed by sand dunes of slight elevation. l!'or a distance of 10 miles along this beach the line of three fathoms lies at a distance of 150 yards off shore, the water deepening rapidly beyond that, and the bottom almost everywhere hard. VeBsels coming from thll northward, bound to Monterey, follow the coast from Point Ano Nuel'o to Point Santa Cruz, then run well into tlie bay, but not too far, for fear of losing the wind, and to avoid the set of the heavy swell rolling towards th" beaeh. Leaving Point Santa Cruz and keeping on a SE. by E. courKe about lfl miles, will bring vessels into 25 fathoms, and nearly two miles from the beach; thence a south course for eight miles will bring them to the anchorage in 10 fathoms, and half a mile from the landing. These precautions arn necessary, because Point Pinos, with the whole bay, is almost continually enveloped in a dense fog. Very frequently the coasting steamers have to run for the beach, and then be guided by the rote to the anchorage . .A direct course from Point Ano Nuevo to the anchorage is SE . .g. E., and the distance 36~ miles. From Point Pinos to l'oint Afio Kuevo the bearing is N. 4"/ 0 W., and the distance 34 miles. By anchoring weU in at the western side of the anchorage vessels will avoid much of the swell that comes in with the heavy northwest winds, but never sufficient to make any berth there dangerous. In heavy southerly weather Point Pinos breaks the swell, but the wind draws very strong over the anchorage. The water shoals from 15 to 3 fathoms in a distance of 300 yards, and the lead should be used to avoid running in too far. When the California mail steamships stopped at Monterey they frequently ran outside of Point Pinos, or in very dangerous proximity to it. This led to their firing a gun when approaching the harbor during foggy or dark weather, and upon the report being heard at the fort a gun was fired in answer, and the

This waste extends to the Sali-nas rfrer, of which we reach the great bend at about 9:\- miles from :Monterey, aml only one hundred yanls from the beacl1. From Point Pinos it bears N. 30░ E., dist.ant 82 miles. From this bend the river follows the line of the beach, just inside of tl1e low sand dunes, for a distance of 4:\- miles, and t11cn disembogues. From Point J>iuos it bears N. 18░ E., and is distant 12~ miles. This river has been designated by a variety of namr~-as Bncmaventura, Monterey, and Salinas; but it is now generally known by the latter. It rises in the latitude of the l'iedras Blancas ; one branch about 20 and the other 33 miles from thl' com;t. The~e branches m1иet at San Miguel, and tl1ence thl' stream runs parallel with the coast and behind the Sierra Santa Lucia. From its mouth, which is onl_y GO yards wide at low water, to the entrance to the Rio tlr!l Pajaro, or San Antonio, the <listance is 2-▒ mile~; the shore trending to the N.NW.

The general direction of the valley for the next two miles is SW. rr W., where we find a depth of' 117 fathoms, and the 50-fathom lines lie about five-eighths of a mile apart; thence the valley run~ about west, reaching a depth of 170 fathoms in a mile, and 240 fathoms in 3! miles, with 42 fathoms, less than a mile to the north of this. The soundings are not numerous enough to trace its outlines in deep water; hut the indications are that, for 10 miles of its length, it runs S. GO" ,V., with no bottom at 315 fathorrn1. The only available boat landing upon the beach of the bay shores is at the head of this sub-marine valley. There are no indications on the land of this peculiar formation, except that at its head the bay very gradually reaches its greatest easting. An extenBive valley, called tlie Salinas plains, through which comes the Salinas river, extends inland from the eaHt1m1 pmt of Monterey bay, nearly to the mission of San Miguel, situated on a plateau of .the San Bruno mountains. This valley is said to be nearly 90 miles in length, and in hrcadth varying from two to ten. It contains some 200,000 acres of good agricultural lands, and the remainder affords excellent pasturage for horned stock, horses, and sheep. 'l'lw hay of l\Inntcn'Y was discovered by Oabrillo in 1542, and called the Bay of Pines. It was surveyed by 8ebastian Vizcaino in 1602, and the name was changed to Puerto de Monte-rey, in honor of tlrn Spanish viceroy of Mexico, Don Gaspar de Zuniga, Count de Monte-rey, who despatched the expediton. It was nscd by the Spanish galleons on their return from Manilla to Mexico. и A preliminary chart of .l\lontercy bay was published by the Coast Survey in 1857. 'l'he line of equal magnetic variation of 15░ east cuts the coast line of }fontcrey bay in latitude 36░ 45' N., about half way between the great bend and mouth of the Salinas river, and crosses the meridian of 123░ 0' ,V., in latitude 36░ 36' N.

HARBOR.

This harbor or anchorage is at the northwest part of the bay of Monterey, and is of very limited extent. It is protected from all tLe winds from the northward, but exposed to the full sweep of southerly gales, and many coasters have been driven ashore during the winter season. It is about three-quarters of a mile in depth northward, by lk mile cast and west. Ve~sels coming from the northward, after leaving Point Aiio N uevo, follow the coast-line on a general course E.SE. for about 18 miles. 'l'he shore for thiR distance is abrupt, jaggm1, and moderately elevated, with a range of high hills, or mountains whose summits in summer are almost continually enveloped in fog. Skirting the shore at a distance of l1alf a mile a depth of 6 to 10 fathoms can be carried, and upen making Point Santa Cruz, the top of which is moderately level for eome distance back, four fathoms are obtained within a quarter of a mile of it; round up and run along in five fathoms until abreast of the beach, where good anchorage will be found lialf a mile from shore. VesRels from the south in summer keep well into Monterey bay, to eecape the full force of the northwesters and the heavy head sea. During the winter months anchor well out, so as to be able to clear the shore westward of Point Santa Cruz in case a southeaster springs up. Landing on the beach is gcneral1y disagreeable, as it extends out some distance, but boats nsually land at the embarcadero, at thll foot of the bluff in the NW. part of the harbor. The beach is over half a mile in length, and between its eastern extremity and the bluff point empties the San Loren1<10 river, a email stream running past the town and mission, which is situated a mile inland. A chart of the harbor a!ld vicinity was published in the Coast Survey report for 1854. The country ahout Santa Cruz is exceedingly productive, and now thickly settled. A steamer runs regularly in the trade between this place and San Francisco, and numerous coasters find abundant freight from here and the Pajaro country to San Francisco. Regular stage communication is maintained with San l!'rancisco and Monterey. The secondary astronomical station of the Coast Survey was at the top of the bluff at the embarcadero.

An examination for the location of a 1wrb9r light has been made, and the site recommended to the Light-house Hoard by the Superintendent of the Coast Rurvey. The high mountain, N. 25░ E., 12~ miles from Santa Cruz, is named Mount Bache, and attains au elevation of 3, 791 feet. Tides.-The corrected establishment, or mean interval between the time of the moon's transit and the time of high water, is Xli. XYIIIm. The mean riec and fall of tides is 4.1 feet ; of spring tide~. 5 5 feet ; and of neap tides, 2.9 feet. The mean duration of the flood i;; 6lt. 4 7m.; of the ebb, 5lt. 45m.; and of the st.and, Oh. 20m. The average difference between the corrected establishment of the a. m. and p. m. tides of the same day is lli. 44m. for high water, and Vi. 2m. for low water. The differencl╗~, when the moon's declination is greatest, are 2h. 40m. and lh. 28m., respectively. The average difference in height of thef<e two tides is 1.4 feet for the high waters, and 2.4 feet for the low waters. '\"hen the moon's declination is greatest these differences are 2.2 foet and ::l.7 feet, rPspectively. 'l'he average difference of the higher high and lower low waters of the same day is 6.0 feet, and wl1en the moon's declination is greatest, 7.0 feet. The higher high tide in the twent.y-fonr l10urs occurs aliout 9h. 32m. after the moon's upper transit, (southing,) when the moon's declination is north, and about 2h. 541n. before, when south. 'l'he lower of the low waters occurs about 7h. after the higher high tide. It was off Point Santa Cruz that Cabrillo is supposed to have anchored on the 17th of No\иemher, 1542, upon his return from the northward. From Point Santa Cruz to Point .Ano A~uevo the distancP is 18 miles, and thP gennal direct.ion ,V. by N. j! N., at first curving to the southwestward of that course, and t11cn to the northward, until within three miles of the rock of Point Ano Nuevo, when the shore curves well to westward, (for the last mile to the southwest,) forming an anchorage protected somewhat against tl1n heavy rt\\иc~ll from tlie northweHt, :md having a depth of five fathoms within less than half a mile of the shore, and from 10 to 15 fathoms at th<> distance of a mile. At a quarter of a mile from the point lie~ a black jagged islet, consisting of a sloping ledge of rocks covered with a stratum of yellow clay abont four feet thick, and this again covered witli a mound of ~and about 30 foet high. Upon thiR a Zigltt-ltousc i;; to be built. 'I'he point itRelf is compoRed of rolling l1ills of shifting sand, varying from 20 to 100 feet in height, while behind them rises the Santa Cruz range of mountains. The eoast trail, which followed the beaeh from the southward, here strikes up the hills behind the sand dunes. Steamers coming upon the coast from the southward in thick weather, always endeavor to make the hncl near Point Aiio Nuevo, and then follow the coast to the San Francisco bar. On accoun: of it8 importance in this respect a light-house was recommended by the Superintendent of the Coast Snrvey. A map of the anchorage, with a view of' the point, was published by the Uoast Survey in 18D4. From Point Afio Nuevo the coast runs N,V. ~ N. for about 10 miles, to the rocky point eallcrl the Punta de la Bolsa, but designated Point Miramontes on the Coast Survey rcconnaiss11nce sheet, from Mexico to San Francisco, in 18.53. Tbe bigl1 mountain square in from La Bolsa, hearing N. 53░ E., and distant 13 milee, named Black mountain, attains an elevation of 2,809 feet. 'l'wo miles north of La Bolsa empties tlrn Piscador, a small stream running through a valley of inconsiderable extent. For foe foregoing 12 miles the general formation of the immediate seaboard is that of a table land of' three terraces, the lowest gradually sloping from the base of the second to the coast, which is exeeediugly rocky and fo1иbidding; the underlying stratum is sandstone. From Point Aiio Nuevo to Pillar Point, or Punta de Corral Tierrn, forming the south and western point of Ilalf-moon bay, the general direction is NW. by N. i N., and the distance 25 miles. 'l'hree and a third miles above the Piscador opens the San Gregorio, another small stream, and 2~ miles still furtl1er openR the Tunitail. The seaboard between the valley of the Pi Read or and that of the San Gregorio undeTgo is a striking change both in the character of its topography and its geology. Instead of the table land we meet with u spur of the coast mount11ins running into the sea, and having an elevation of 600 feet within a mile of it. The shore-line and the coast gene1иally presents a very broken and rugged appearance, occa~ioned by the deep gulches cut through to the ocean.
HALFиl100:'!il BAY.

de Tierra, 325 yards south of which stretches a number of black rocks, which show as one when seen coming up the coast, but as three or four when approached from the northwest. The largest is nearly as high as the bluff, and locally known as Sail rock, or Pillar rock. The point is known as Pillar Point, and from its ~outheastern extremity rocky and foul-bottom, marked by kelp, extends SE. )\ E., seven-eighths of a mile, dropping mddenly from 14 feet to 5 fathoms. This is tho inner reef, and makes the bay available as a summer anchorage. One mile and tl1re1H1uarters southeast from the same part of tl1e point a narrow ledge of rocky bottom, one-third of a mile long, and marked by kelp, stretches in the same general direction. The passage between this outer and tl1e inner reef is three-quarters of a mile wide, with rocky and uneven bottom, from 3f to lOf fathoms. These ledges lie parallel with the coast mountains, and with the shore-line from which the outer one iR distant q mile. From the eastern extremity of the point the shore runs N\Y. by N. for a quarter of a mile; then NE. for three quartern of a mile, curving to the eastward and southeastward .in a long hf,nd, for miles to the mouth of the Arroyo de Ios Pi!larcitos, down which comes the only road crossing the peninsula of San Francisco, between the Laguna de Mercedes and Santa Cruz 'l'he highest part of thi8 road, which crosses a depression of the peninsula, is near the Coast Survey station "Ridge," which is l,O!J3 feet above the occ11n, and but a few feet higher than the mad. The outer reef is nearly abreast of the I>illarcitos, from which the coast runs south four miles to JJiirumonte.и point, which is S. 48'' E., tive miles from I'illar Point; thence t.o tlw mouth of tbe 'l'unitas the distance rs four miles SE. The greatest extent of tl1e lmy may be said to be between Pillar and l\iiramontes Points, but the part near the former only is available. The soundings between the rocky ledges and the shorn are q nite regular, decreasing from nine fathoms to three fathoms at lc8R tlian a quarter of a mile from tlm hea.ch, with sandy bottom. The passage to the anchorage is between the inner and outer reef, with the high, bare-topped mountain bearing a little north of east, and Pillar Point open to the westward. This mountain is steep, with straggling redwoods on its flanks, and the summit bare. It is locally known as Bald Pate; but, on the Spanish grants, as Cum bra de las Auras. When inside the reefs beat up until Pillar Point be1trs about S,V., distant half a mile, and anchor in fathoms, hard sand. \Yith southerly light winds a heavy swell sets in; but upon the approach of heavy southeast weather it is necessary to go to sea. TJw mass of redwoods cresting the mountains of the peninsula cease ahrupt1y abreast of Mirnmrmtes, aml only stragglers are seen to the northward. 'l'hey are a good mark for recognizing this part of the coast when coming in from sea. Around Half-moon bay is a limited extent of agricultural country at the seaward base of the mountain~, and small coasters carry tl1c produce to San Francisco. About one mile along the coast to the uorthwestw.arcl is a sm.all ho.at harbor, 100 yards wide, formed and protected by outlying rocks, and having 32" fathoms in it. In the autumn months it is used as a wl1aling station. .About a thousand barrels of humpback oil were obtained in the fall of 18G3. Point San Pedro lies NW. by N. ;f N., 30 miles from Point Ano Nuevo, anrl S. 12░ E. from Point Lobos, at the eutrance to the Golden Gate. It is a black, bold, rocky promontory, over 500 feet bigh, having a l1igh, l:trge, jagged rock at the northern part, and is a prominent and excellent mark for making the entrance to San l<'rnncisco. The principal rock is uearly a hundred feet high. Its south face is white, and shows the line of stratification plainly. From the west the dip of the strata shows about 60 degrees to t11e northward. It is connected with t.he main by some low rocks. Half a mile to tl1e northeast of the point is the valley of San Pec1ro, from which tbe point takes its name. }~rom Point San Pedro the bell-boat off the bar of San Francisco is distant 12 miles, and from Point Aiio Nuevo it is 40 miles upon a X"\V. by N. course. The range of mountains f01иming the northeastern shore of Monterey bay, and extending to Sauta Cruz and Point Ano Nucvo, is called Santa Cruz, Thence nortbward to the Golden Gate, and forming the peniusnla of San Francisco, by bounding the bay on the west, the mountains arc known as the San Francisco or San Bruno range. The extent of shore-line from Point Concepcion to Point Boneta is about 286 miles.

and bold shores, the Sacramento and tributaries, draining the rich agricultural vallt'JR and aurifernns slop<'R of the Sierra Nevada, the magic city upon its shores, and the salubrity of its climate, have conspired to make it emphatically the port of tht Pacific. Tlie Go1den (fate is t1!1' entrance to the l1ay, and presents the character of a great cleft <H" fi~rnre in tl1c sea-coast range of mountains, thereby connecting the liay of San Francisco with the P1wifie occиan. On approaching, it is difficult to imagine that a deep channel lies ahead, so clear is the atmosphere, and so well defined the Contra Costa mountains, behind the bay. Both shores arc bold, broken into points, and r'lcky; but the northe1иn is much the bolder, rising almost perpendicularly from the water, attaining an elevation of about 1,000 feet, but a short distance back, and in seven miles rising to 2,600 feet. On tlw sontl1 Ride, lmtwPcn the points, arc stretches of low beach; the hills arc undulating and of moderate elevation, increa~ing very gradually in altitude to the southward, and reaching a height of 1,250 feet in about six or eigl1t mile,;. Tl1e chart of San Franci~co entrance, which accompanies the annual Coast Survey Report for 1856, shows tl1e bold and chara.cteristic topogra11hy of the vicinity of the Golden GatP. Point Boneta.-The north head of the entr:mce iR formed by tl1is point; a narrow, precipitous, rocky cape, nearly 300 feet high, and stretching from the Jig-ht-house about half a mile to the SE. Behind it the mountains rise rapidly to an elevation of 1,500 feet. During the dry season the deposit of eca birds accumulates in such quantities on the ridge outside of Boneta light-house, as to make the bluff show white, but tlte fir~t heavy rain carries it off, and then, throughout the rainy season, the point exhibit~ its natural color and appearance. 'I'here are no dangers off the point, the line of thrf'C fathomR rarely cxtrmding 300 yards from auy portion of it. ':n1en the clipper ship San .Francisco was lost on this head, we arc told that she first struck the bluff inside the heads; was carried by the currents armmr1 tl1e point, and then east aRhore on the outside. 'l'he reef, or line of sunken rocks, stretching out three-quarters of a mihи npon some maps, has no existence, and only serves to mislead those unacquainted with the locality. :From five to six fathoms can be found on every side within a :fifth of a mile. One mile and seven-eighths K,V. of tlw point the steamsl1ip 'l'ennessee went ashore whilst endeavoring to find the entrance in a thick fog, (calm weather,) aud was lost. The Cortes had got in just before her, aud as the fog was shutting down over the entrance.

It enabled ves:;el:;, beforn reacl1ing the bar, to get the bearing of l'oint Boneta, and, by the loudness of the report, or better, by the soundings, to form an estimate of their distance from it.-(Scc rcma1иks, imge 296, J\Ionterey kiy.) "\Ve advocated this plan strougly soon after our arrival upon the coast, and it met with the hearty support aud conmendution of officers of the navy and comnrnnrlPrs of il1e steamships, clippers, and coasters. Continuing to urge its adoption until the spring of 1855, we had the satisfaetion of seeing it tried in August of that yuar. \.Ve have since learned, by British newspapers, that the Board of 'l'rade and Liverpool Corporation Lave placed a gun of large calibre on Holyhead, to be finid during foggy weather, for the benefii: of mail steamers pas~ing up thu Jrj;;h channel. Point Lobos.-The south head of the entrance to San Francisco bay is formud by this point, 375и feet high, upon which Congress authorized tlie erection of a secondary sea-coast light, where a light has been regularly shown, and a fog-bell k<'pt in operation by private enterprise. U11on the round-toppeil hill buhinil the point is erected a large frame building for a telegraph station, whence the electric.wires run to the city of San FraneiRco. Tlie first telegraphic message transmitted on tlie Pacific coa8t was over these wires. Southward of the ]wad the sand dunes are conspicuous and easily recognized features in approaching the entrance. The strong northwest summer winds, drawing in ove1и the land, raise the white saml from the three miles of broad beach, and carrying it inland over the l1illtops, bury grass, bushes, and scrub oak. Tlw quantity of sand driYen in from this beach is enormous, and its accumulation lias greatly modified the topograpl1y of the peninsula.

Off the western face of Point Lobos lie a number of black jagged rocks about 50 feet high, but all within the fin~иfathom line, and close in shore. They arc called the Seal rocks, and one of them shows a large arch from particular directions. The outer one bears from Point Boneta SE. by S. S., and is distant 2~ miles. From it the general trend of the ~l1ore runs in a line to :Fort Point for nearly a mile, to a sl1ort jutting high point, off which lie the JJiile rock,~. From this point the shore runs well to the eastward for a rnile, gmdually trendi11g to the north for a mile and a lmlf to Fort Point. ln the deepest part of this bend the shore i~ low, with small hillocks rising from the general surface and slo11e of the hills, and fronted by a long sand beach. 1\:Iile rocks.-These two rocks lie off Point Lobo~, a short distance within the limit of the entrance of thr Golden Gate. They are small, near each other, and have a height of 15 feet above water, with a good depth of water all around and close to tl1em ; but the current swirls and eddies about them in such a manner as to render a near approach anything but agreeable or safe with a light wind. The inner and smaller rock is one-third of a mile to the northward of the small jutting point inside of Point Lobos, and very nearly two miles S\\~. ~ S. from Fort Point. V cssels running in on the 1ine of Fort Point and Alcatraz island pass less than half a mile from the outer and larger rock. The rocks bear almost SE. from Boneta lif:;ht, and distant lf mile. They were called "One Mile Rocks" by Beechy, in November, 1826. Fort Point.-This was formerly a bold, narrow, jutting promontory of hard serpentine rock, 107 feet above high water, and surmounted by a small Mexican fortification. called Fort Blanco. The view from the point was one of the finest in the harbor; but the whole headland has been cut down to within a few feet of high water, and iuereased in area to form a large fortification, which will he mounted with guns of the largest range and calibre. Upon the hillside rising behind it arc houses for the accommodation of the commandant, officers, soldiers, and workmen. Eastward of the point is a long substantial wharf, constructed for receiving stores, ordnance, &c. Several large vessels have been lost on .Fort Point by venturing too close during light airs and st1иong in-egular currents.

BELL-BOAT OL"TSTDE OF SAN FRANCISCO BAR.

A bell-boat is placed just outside of the liar, in 1;) fathoms at mean low water, on the range of the Fort I'uint and Alcatraz Island light-houses. It is 30 feet long, painted red, and furnished with a Jay-mark of 32 feet by four, elevnted eight feet above the water. The bell weighs 500 pounds, is eleYatecl 15 foet above the water, is rung by the action of the sea, and, under ordinary circumstances of wind and sea, should be hear<l. from one to three miles. Mariners are cautioned not to run into or damage this aid to navigation. The fog-gun signal at Point Boueta wa8 discoutiumиt1 with tl1e placing of this bell-boa!., Mardi 18, 1858, as already stated; and the bar buoy on the same range was also removed. The approximate geograpliical position of the bell-boat is :

The bearings and distances of prominent object~ from it are as follows : South Farallon Island light-house, SW. by W. 2 W., 16:\ miles. Punta de Los Reyes, (lig11t-house site,) :S-W. by иw. и~ W., 22! miles. Duxbury Point, NW. by N. 2 N., 82 miles. Point Boneta light-house, NE.! N., 7! miles. l!'ort Point light-house, NE.

'!'he course to enter the bay from it is NE. ~ E., and it will be seen that it lies almost in the line from the S. FaraUon light to the proposed Point Lobos light. From the bell-boat, Fort Point (two miles inside the south head fonned by Point Lobos) is on "IYitlt .Alcatraz island, inside of the harbor. Fort Point and Alcatraz island have harbor lights upon them, and arc the fair way line for crossing the bar. The bell-boat was upset about April 1, 18/i!), as seen from Table mountain. It was subsequently replaced, and again carried away. When we came out in November, 1860, it was not on the bar.
SAN FRANCISCO BAR.

The bar off the entrance to the bay of San Francisco has a depth of :five fatlmms at the lowest tides. Its general form is that of a l1orse-shoe, commencing four miles southward, stretching out gradually to six miles abreast of Point Lobos; and when nearly up to the parallel of Point Boneta, rmu!iug in elwrc towards

that point and forming the "four-fathom bank," from a distance of four miles down to one. 'l1 he average breadth of the bar within the limits of the six-fathom curve is about one mile. It falls off outsicle to 10 fathoms in half a mile, ancl ueepen8 gm dually iu~iJe. Not less than five fathoms exist over the bar when Point Boneta light bears between NK by E. .Z E., and X. by \V. ;! \>V. No vessel sl1ould anchor upon the bar if she can possibly avoid it; frequently a heavy swell sets in without wind, and if tl1e current is running strong ebb, it allows little chance of e8caping from an uncomfortable berth. 'l'he flood tide makes on the bar about 61 minutes earlier than at San Francisco. It has been given as a rule for steumers approaching in thick weather to run for the bar as nearly as they can estimate, keeping the lead going until they strike five fathoms, and run on until the depth is increaseu, when the armed lead slwuld bring up gray sand with red specks, :mcl they may conclude themselves within t11c bar. Recently it has been intimated that these peeuliaritie~ of bottom exist also outside of tlie bar. A line of large buoys, properly marked, outside the bar in 10 fathoms is the next best expedient after a large fog-gun_ Prom them the position of the bell-boat. coulll be known; and numbered buoys from it across the bar would enable steamers in thick weather to feel their way in, and be independent of guessing about the velocity and direction of the current. The fog sometimes stands like a wall outside of a line from Fort Point ~ross the entrance, while the bay inside is beautifully clear. After the greatest heat of the day is passeu this fog creep in and envelopes land and water. Buoy on tl1c fuur:fatlwm bank.-A first class can buoy, with red and black horizontal stripes, is placed in four fathoms at mean low water near the western and seaward end of tl1e "four-fathom bank," lying off Point Boneta. 'l'hc following bearings and distances will give its position : It i,; 011 the prolongation of the line from Fort Point ligl1t to the extreme point of Boneta. Point Boneta light bears E. 13░ ::\f., distant 3:\" miles. Outer telegraph station on Point Lobos hears E. 13░ 8., distant 5i miles. 'l'he highest part of the western riuge of 'l'ahle mountain bears N. 13░ W. There is a spot having but 3~ fathoms upon it outside this buoy, bearing S. 34░ W. and distant seveneighths of a mile. The shores ef tlte Golden Gatc.-On the north side of the Golden G:ite the shores arc very precipitous, -with an occasional short stretch of sand beach at the base of the bluffs, affording a boat landing. Point Diablo is the first point insille Boneta, and bears NE. by E. E., distant l~ mile from it; between these the shore is indented about three-quarters of a mile, affording a boat landing during smooth weather for the light-l1ouse people. In the vicinity of Diablo the facrs of the cliffs show of a reddisl1 purple color. 'l'hc rock i,; very hard and flinty, "traversed by seams of quartz, and has a banded or belted structure, so that it rr8emhleR varieties of ja~per. * и и * и It exhibits its stratified character most distinctly. It is aLio found at tl1e cinnabar mine of New Almaden." The red ~pecks found on the bar are doubtle8s derived from the disintegration of these reddish cliffs. иFrom Diablo the shore is jagged and irregular to Lime Point Bluff, 495 feet high, distant one mile, and bearing KE. !j E. Off this point are several high rocks, but they are so close to the bluff as to he clistingni~hnhlc only from certain directions. Iи'rom Lime Point Bluff to Fort Point the distance is barely a mile, anu the hearing S. hy E. Jt E. This is the narrowest part of the Golden Gate. Thence the bay begins to open well to tl1e northeast. On the south side, eastward from .Fort Point, the shore is low, flat, and marshy to Point San JQse, distant 2d miles, and bearing E. by X. 'l'his point is moderately ltigb, with a few houses clustering upon it, and is locally known aR Inack JlOint. Off this reach was the "outer anchorage" of former navigators, and the Presidio of San Francisco fa seen a short distance bel1ind it. "It is a curious and interesting fact that the sand beach between .Fort Point and Point San Josef has been thrown up by the surf u11on an extemive alluvial deposit, which has the character of a peat bog or swamp. '\Yhen the tide iB very low the edge of this peat formation may he seen. Large masses of the peat are alBo broken out during storms, and thrown up on the sand of the beach. This sand and all the loose round boulders, from three to eight inclws, or more, in diameter, rest upon a foundation of the peat; and the continuation of the peat is found in the swamp or flat meadow land which lies inside the belt of sand, and between it and the base of tl1e sand11tone hillR. It is very difficult to account for the formation of this swamp under conditions like.those at present existing."

SAILING DIREGTIO:SS FOR Ar?RO.\.GHI"G AND ENTERING SAN FUANCISCO BAY.

In approaching the coast every opportunity sl1onld he seized for determining the ves~Pl':; iio~ition, as fogs and tl1ick weather prevail near the fond. Vessels coming from the soutlnrard make thии coast about Point Afio Nuevo, (lat. 37░ 07 1 N.,) and follow it at a distance of four or five miles up to tlic bar. StPm'.icrs keep dose under the land for fear of losing it in foggy weather.

the island has not yet been surveyed in cletail. From the Soutl1 Farrallon light-house the Point Boneta light bears _KE. hy E., 23Д miles; and the bell-hoat outsicle the bar bears NE. liy E. ~ E., lGz miles. Coming from the nortlnnиBtm1rd they make I)uuta cle los Reye~. 597 feet high, in latitude ::JS 0 00' N., longitrn]p 1230 00 1 "\V., and pass within two or three mill's of it, l ;) fothomg being found within a quart<'r of a mile from it, but Vl'.SBcb are apt to lose the wind by getting too close under it. .Frnm the western extremity of this point tlie J>oint Boneta light bears E. it S., distant 25'i miles, the line passing over the tail of Duxhmy rcиpf, at a distance of 17:j; miles from Los lh'.)'CS. To the bell-boat oIT the bar the bearing is sg_ hy E. f{ E., and cliw111ce 22} miles. Th<и hdl-boat, 1~ mile outsitle of tlte bar, is placed on th(' prolongation of the range from Alcatraz island to Fort J>oint, giving a course NE. ~ E. for vessels enteriug the Golden Gctte, and clesignated hy Belcher the "fair way ]ill(.," :unl he calls the blancl ancl fort the "fair way m;irks." But with a heavy swell on the bar thi~ rnngc l'houlr1 he u:;et1 merely as a line of rcиfrrence, hecause on the bar it pasRes over a sma11 five-fathom spot, wl1ik half a fathom more crm be obtained for a distance of tivo miles Loth north and south of it. In clear wc~athPr and with a favorah le wiud a vessel can cross the bar in not less than five fathoms from the line, lmving tlu- north encl of Alcatrnz island just open by l'oiut Boueta, (~ E. by E. iJ E.,) round to the slwre south of Point Lobos, (X. by IV. i\- IV.) Northward of the former line the four-fathom bank (having :;;j fotliorn~ on it) commencLиs one mi IP west of Boneta, and stretches out over three miles, with a hreadth of one mile. rpon this bank the clipper Goldeu Fleece struck in 1857, and came into port with seven or eight feet of water in Ler hold. She was the second of hc1и name that was unfortunate in entering the harbor, the first haviIJg been totally lost on :Fort l'oint. Between the ea8tcrn extremity of the "four-fathom bank" and the shore, the distance is seven-eighths of a mile, and within this Fpace can be found the ileepest water for entering the harbor, but it would be dangerous for a rniling ve~sd to attempt it with a flood tide and light wirn1s. IVhile it is breaking on the bauk only a heavy swell is found through this S~-fat.hom channel, and small sailboats have passed in safety when they dared not try tlic bar. "\Ve entered by it in the brig Wyandot, in June, 1854, and the steamship Columbia frequently us<,d it in l{,aving the harbor for tlie upper coast when the heavy wcat1wr on the bar woultl otl1crwi~e have delayed her in port. Clo~e in under the cliffs, two or three miles above Boneta, we anchored in eight fot110ms, with muddy bottom. During clear, moderate weather any vessel cau cross the bar, within the limits we have mentioned, without running until 8he has got on the "fair way line," wLereliy she might lose her i;lant of wind. Should the wiud fail, or be ligl1t, and tlie current acl\'erse, anchor onlside the bar in 1.5 fathoms, mud and fine sand; or, after crossing the bar, in 6 to 10 fathom,;, fine grey sanu, with red specks in some places. Run in midcbannl'l l)('twAcn the heads; avoid too close proximity to the northern shore, not only in entering, but in kavinf!'; the high, bold bluffs causing calms and baffling airs, even with a southeaster blowing out. On the last of ,January, 1864, during a southeaster, three vessels were at one time becalmed under the northern ~horc, and bafilecl with variable airs and strong current ecldies for several hours. One of them, the harkentine .Tmmy Ford, was canied on Point Dinblo and tot.ally wrecked. Between Fort Point and the opposite shore, take s11ccial care not to approach }'ort l'oint too close, because the currents set around it irregularly and with great rn1>i<1ity, and the bottom is uneven and rocky. A depth of 69 fathoms is given in the centre of the cl1anncl. In tlw Golden Gate we Lave measured an ebb current running ahont six miles per hour. As n general rule, the winds increase within the heads, drawing in very strongly abreaet of Fort Point. "\Vhen off this point ~tc<:r for .Alcatraz light-houБe until the north point of Telegraph hill bears E. by S., then 10tcer to give it a berth of a quarter of a mile, running through among the shipping. In makiug the port at 11ight it is customary to run for tl1e bell-boat, and cross the bar with Fort Point light on with Alcatraz islancl light, or better, the latter a little open to the northward. But this practice frequently involves much delay and annoyance when the wind will not permit a vessel to attain this position without a tack. With Boneta ligl1t bearing from N. by ЦV. to NE. by E. a vessel may boldly run on within those limits, and, unless there be a heavy swell, safely cross the four-fathom bank. Give Boneta a berth of a mile, and when within the head8, and Boneta abeam, gradually open .Alcatraz light north of Fort Point, until abeam of the latter; then run for Alcatraz until the lights of the shipping show the vessel's position. Hauling up for them, anchor off the north beach in 10 fa.thorns, or off the northeast front of the city in 10 fathoms, soft mud. In coming upon the coast in thick foggy weather, sailing vessels should not run into less than 50 fathoms because the water around the South Farallon, and off Point Sau 1~cdro and Punta de los Reyes, is very

bolil. It is believed, however, that a 30-fatliom bauk exists at a conHiileraLle distance to the westwartl of the last. Southwest of the line passing through the Farallones and Noonday rock, the 100-fathom curve is only four mile8 distant, aud the 50-fathm:n curve only two miles, with a very irreguhr bottom. If the Farallones be made, a course can be easily laid for the bar, but it woulil be unadvi'3ablc to run into le;-s than 10 fathoms, soft mud, if the bdl-boat be not hcarcl, as the Rd aml Rlrcng-th of the currcnb off thи~ bay are yet undetermined. Belcher says that, Leing caught in a fog, he anchoretl in 15 fathoms, to the southward of the bar, and determined" tl1at southerly of tlw fair way linP thf, ehl1 tide set );.NE., flood S.S'I\._" ~Ye suppose he means from the N.NE., and from the S.S'.V. During the season of freshets in the Sacramento aud tributaries the di~colorcd water outside the bar will frequently point out the po~ition of t11e cnirancc. Steamers iu thick weather were accustomed to run close along the coast, and endeavored to make the lancl north of Point San l'cdro, running in until they got about 15 fathoms, aud then laying a course for the Lar, shoaling upon it to about five fat11oms, and then gradually deepening, while the fog-gun gave the direction of Boneta light. Before the establishment of the fog-gun the steam.-hip "Tcnne~E<ec" was wnиcked two miles north of Boneta, when seeking for the entrance in a dense fog;; the steamship S. S. Lewi,,, just north of Duxbury reef; and the U. b. revenue brig Lawrence, between poiuts Lobos arnl Sau Pedro. Steamers and clippers are afraid to approach the bar in thick weather. W c have entered in a dense fog without hearing the bell, and the general opinion is that it is ineffective. As it has Leen frequently statetl that Becchy did not intend to adopt the range, Fort Point and Alcatraz island as a fair way over tl1e bar to the entrance, we here quote his directions, as puLli~hed under autl1orit.y of the Lords of tl1e Admiralty. "In crossing the bar it is well to give the> northern shore a good berth, and bring the small white island, Alcatrasses, in one with the fort or south bluff, if it cau be conveniently done, as they may then insure six fathoms; hut if ships get to the northward so as to brin;_!: the south bluff in one with the islnnd of Ycrba Buena, they will :find but 4:\;; и и * и to the northward of this bearing the water is more shallow." "Approaching the entrance, the island of Alcatrasses may be opened with the fort, and the best directions are to keep mid-channel, or the wr:atlwr side," In his narrative he says; "The best part for crossiug is "иith t11e i~land of Alcatrass('s in one witl1 the fort."-(Vol. 1, page 345.) \Yhen approaching tlie harbor he steered directly into it, and in cros~ing the bar the depth of water gradually dirnini~he<l to five fatl10mo; "this would have been of no con<"eqnence liad it not been for a swell which iиollecl so heavily over the bank that it continually broke; and, thou~h our depth of water was never less than 4~ fathoms, the ship on two or three occasiom disturbed thf' sand with her keel. The tide wa~, unfortunately, against ns, aud the swell propelled the ship ju8t rnflicicutly fast for her to steer without gaining any ground, so that we remained in tl1is }JOsitinn sc\'eral hours."-(Yol. 1, page 345.) 'The U. S. sloop-of-war Vincennes, dming tl1e cruise of the Exploring Expcilition, anclwreil on the bar in a calm, ancl, when the flood tide made it brought up a swell that broke over her. In heating 01Lt, vessels start on the last quarter of the flood, make the first tnck to the northward of the Blossom rock, and weather it on the second; thence they keep between .Alcatraz and the south shore, avoiding Bird rock, one mile west of the south end of the island, and giving a good Lcrth to Fort Point, past which the ebbи current will carry them rnpidly, (with a strong tendency towards tl1e south shore,) and a coup1e more tacks can-y them clear of the heads. If the vessel Le bound to the northward, and the weather shut in thick, with the wind to the nort11west, Bhe makes a tack off shore to tl1e southward of the Farallonc~; if the weather be clear short tacks are made off shore until she works up to Los Reyes, because the sea to the leeward of that headland is much smoother and the current less; then st>mds off until a course can be made for her port. Tlte winds.-It has been advised to work close along shore to northern ports during the summer northwest winds, and take the chances of land breezes to make latitude, but the attempt will donlile tlic length of any voyage: Baffling light airs and calms frequently exist along the coast, while vessels several hundred miles off have strong N,Y. winds. Moreover, along the coast we know that the current frequently sets two miles per hour from the northward, except very close under tl1e sl10res. In our experienre we never yet have met a wind off t11e land north of San Francisco, and very rarely, indeed, south of it, except in the region of the Santa Barbara channel. As a general rule, it may be safely stated that tl1P rnmrner winds follow the line of the coast, nearly, and gradually draw towards and over the land In winter, with winds from the southward, this is not so marked.

THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

From April to October, inclusive, the prevailing wind is from the northwest, changing to west in valloy3 opening upon tho coast, but in no case so strongly as through the Golden Gate. During the summer the wind sets in strong about 10 a. m., incre;ising until nearly sunset, when it begins to die away. During its height it almost nиgularly brings in a dcnpe fog, which, working its way over the peninsula, meets that already advanced through the Golden Gate, and cnvelo11c~ Sau Francioco and tl1c bay by sunset. As a rule, the lHceze docs not dispPI the fog. If a fog exist; outside, t11e wind is sure to bring it in, but the heatDd earth dissipates it for a time. Frnrn NovPmlier to ~fareh the winrl is fre<jlH'ntly from the soutl1cast, blowing hea\иily, working rournl to the soutliwe.'t, with n large and broken swell from the SIV., weather thick, rainy, and Rqually; the wind not unfrer1ncnt !y ending at .N \\'., with an ugly cross sea. During heavy southeasters the sea breaks upon the San .Franci;co bar, clmn across the cntrauce, presenting tl fearful sight. The sound can be heard at the anchorage in front of the cit}"и During some winters a han1 "nortl1er" will Rpriu3' up and hlow steadily and strongly from one to five dnyB, with a clcnr Linc sky, and cold bracing weather. 'WindB rarely blo;v from points between north, round liy tlw ea,t, to southeast. The further north we advance, the heavier blow the gales in the winter. 'L'he northwest wind~ are not lll"edictt'd by the barometer, but, from the southeast, almost inYariably; the mercury falling one inch from its uBnal height of about thirty inches. ''"hen it begins to rise, the wind may be looked upon as soon to shift round liy the west, and to decrease. Only in one in,otance during our experience has this failed, and that waB off the Strait of Juan de :Fuca. On the tops of the mountains bordering tlie coast, light variable and easterly airs arc frequently expeTienecd whil"t tl1<' northweRt. winds an' hlowing frcsltly along the sea.hoard. Upon Sulphur Peak, in latitude 38~ 46 1 , and 26 miles from the coast, we have had fre~h breezes from the E .KE., whilst the usual northwest. winds were prevailing off shore. On Ross mountain, only three mileR from the sea, and rising 2,197 foct from the right bank of the Sluvianska river, we fouml Yariablc nirs when strong summer windB were Llo1ring belollи.
TIDES AT UX FUAKCJSCO и

.As a general rule. tliere are upon the Pacific coast of the U nitcd States one larg" and one s:nall tide during each day, th(' height.A of two successive high watcro-oecurring one, n. m., and the other, p. m. of the same twenty-four hours-and the interval8 from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different, so nnH:h so that at certain 1ieriods a rock which has 3~ feet upon it at low tide may be awash on the 11Pxt succeeding low water. T1iese inequalities depend upon the moon's declination. They disappear near the time of the moon's dPeliuation being nothiug, am1 are greatest about the time of its being greatest. 'l'he inequalitif~B for low water are not the same as for high, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same tiIDt"R. \Yhcn tlic moon'B declination is north, the higher of the two high tides of the twenty-four hours occurs at San }-rauciRco about t'lcven and a half hours after tlie moon's transit; and when the declinntion is south, tlw lower of the two high tides occurs at about that interval. The lower of the two low waters of the day is the one which follows next tl1и; higher high water. The correctetl. establishment., or mean interval between the moon's transit and the time of high water at San Franci8co, is XIIh. V Im. The mean rioe and fall of tides is 3.6 feet; of spring tides, 4.3 feet; and of neap tideto, 2.S feet. The mean duration of tl1c flood is 6h. 39m.; of the ebb, 5lt. 5lm.; and of the stand, 34ni. The average difference between the correctcd_:e~ta1li~hmcnt of the a. m. and p. m. tides of the same dny is lit. 28111.. for high water. and 07<. 38m. for low water. The differences when the moon's declination is greatest :ire 2h. 30m. 1md Olz. 48m. The average difference iu height of these two tides is 1.1 foot for the high waters, and 2.2 feet for the lmT" waters. иwhen the moon's dcclinntion is greatest those differences a.re 1.5 foot and 3.7 feet, respecti>"ely. The average difference of the higher high and lower low waters of the same day iR 5.2 foet, and when the moon's declination is greatest, G. l feet. The higher high tide in the twenty-four 110urs occurs about llh. 22rn. after t.l1c moon'~ upper trau8it, (southing,) when the moon's declination is north, anrl about lh. 2m. before, when south. The lower of the low waters, about 7k. after the higher high tide.

Example.-Rcquired the time of high water at Korth Beach, San Francisco, on the 7th of Pebruary, 18.53. lot. The time of the moon's trnusit at Grecnwicl1, from the British Nautical Almanac, is 11/i. 4lm.; the longitude of f\an lи'ranci~co, Sh. 1 Om., nиquiring a correction of 16m. to the time of transit at San l'rnnci~co, which is thus fom1d to be llh. 57m. 2cl. The moon'8 declination jg ~oul.11, aml at the time of transit about two days after the grcatc~t. Entering Tahl(' I, we find 12lt. (or Oh.) of transit, the nearest number to llli. 57m., which tl1c table give~; and following the liue lrnrizontally until come 1o two Jays after tl1e greatcet declination we find 13/i. 14m. To l llt. 57m. time of transit of moon, :February 7, San :Francisco, Add 1:3 le! from column Oft. transit, and two day8 after greatest declination.

иrn

Sum 25 11, or lh. llm., }'eliruary 8, is the time of high water coITesponding to the trausit which we took of :February 7. ] f we deEire the tide of February 7, we must go back to the moon's transit of the 6th. 'The 0xamplc was pnrpoHely assunwd to show this case. To 1171. 01 m., time of transit, February 6, 1853, Add 13 31, number for lllt. transit, and one day from greatest declination. Bum 24 32, time of high water Oli. 32m., a. rn., February 7. The approximate times of the successive low and l1igh waters of the day will be fouml by adding tlie numbers in Table 111 to the time of the first high water already determined by Tables I and II.
TABLE III.

'l'he days from the greatest declination arc written in the first and last columns of the table. The secoud, third, and fourth columna refer to south decimation, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh to north. The second cxilumn gives the number wl1ich is to be added according to the declination to the time of high water obtained by means of Tables I and II, to give the next low water, which is a small low water. The third

Example.-To obtain the height of the tide on February 7, 1853, the declination being south, we enter Tal1le I II, with Oli. of transit, and two days after greatest declination, and find that the tide will be 4.5 feet above the mean of the lower low waters, or that 4..'i feet arc to be addecl to the soundings of a chart reduced to thfl mean of the lower low waters of each day. If the :soundings of tl1e chart were given for mean low water, then 1.2 foot ought to be subtracted from the Tables Ill and IV; thus, iu tl1is example, it woulcl be 3.3 feet. The rise :mrl fall of t11e same successirn tides may lrn obtained by irn<pcction from Tables VI and VII, in which tl1c :first column, at the side, contains the time of transit, and the rnccessive columns the numbers corresponding to that time, and to tl1e number of days from greatest declination.
TAP.LES VI AND VII.

'l'hc arangement of these tables is similar to that ah-eady given. In Table YI tl1c numbers for the small ebb title are given, and tl1en those for the rise from small low water to the larger high water. In Table VII the numbers for the large ebb tide are given, and then those for tho rise from tho large low water to the small l1igh water.

Example.-Thus, in the preceding example the high water of Fel.iruary 7 "иas founu to li<' 3.3 fret above mean low water. The declination being ~outh, tliis l1igh water ie the small one. To oLtain the fall of the next low water, or small low water, we enter 'I'able YT, with 071. of moon's transit, and t"иo days after greatest declination, in the first part of the table, and find 1.9 foot, which will lie the diffcrpnce in h<'ight of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit and day in the eecond part, we :find ::l.~ feet, which is the rise of tl1e large high water above the small low water; t.hc <lifference between 1.9 foot and 3.0 feet, or 1.1 foot, is the Jifference of height of tl1e two successive high waters. It is ea~y to spe how, in this way, the sounclings of a chart can be reduced to what they woulil be approximately at all the eucccsи sive high and low waters. 'l'IIE SEASONS.-Thcrc mиe bnt two 8eaRons on the Pacific eoaRt, U8nally dcnorninatc<l the dry and rainy seasons; the former con-esponding to the Atlantic summer, the latter to the winter; but rnnd1 <>rror exists in regard to them, c;,pccially as to the amount of rain falling dmiug the rainy Fea,011. Tl11и following totals of rain that fell at San Francisco during each wet season, from 1850 to 1862, will i;liow that tlw yearly amount is not great: During the wet season of 1850-'51 there foll 7 .0 inches. 1851-'.52 19.0 " 1852-'53 32.7 18.53-'.54 21.9 1854-'.55 " " " 24.3 20.7 1855-'56 18.'\G-'57 20.2 ] 857-'58 " 21.7 1858-'59 22.0 " 1859-'60 22.0 lSG0-'61 19.4 1861-'62 to the middle of April.

Average of twelve wet seasons._._ 23.3 The wet season of 1861-'62 was remarkable for the disastrous effects of the great rainP in D1'ceml1cr and January. In the latter half of December, 6.3 inches fell ; in the first half of Jan nary, 15.!J ind1es; and in the latter half of January, 8.5 inches. At Sonora, Tuolumne county, no le"" than 72 i11ches werии registered between November 11, 1861, and January 14, 1862. Millions of dollars' worth of pmpcrty were acBtroyecl in the Sacramento valley.

REPORT OF THE SCPERIKTENDENT OF

'l'he following table will slrnw how the foregoing yearly amounts were di;<tributcd each montl1, from "November, 18;)0, to the mi<ldlc of April, 18G2: :Mean monthly rain for January, 1.90 inches.

There is a Yery notable abatement from tho middle of January to the middle of February. In 18&1 we noticed t11i14 particularly when stationed at Point Pinos, because the above period was much prolonged. In 1SD2, while observing nea1и the Presidio of San Franci~co, \VC found this period to extend from the early pait of January to near the end of February. In 1858-'60, a11d '61, and the exceptional part of 1862, we founJ this ccsrntion marked. During the latter part of l\Inrch heavy rains occur, and about the middle of April. The southerly winds generally b1-ing the rain. During the seasons we passed about San .Pranci~co, we never heard thunder or saw lightning, aud never but once sa\v suow fall, and then only at an clcyation of 400 feet; the iiue being distinctly markc<l, and the elerntion b"iug well determiue<l by a knowledge of the height of the hills. On the mountains of the seaboard snow frequently falls, but with tiиifiiug depth. 'I'he fogs that prevail n pon the eoa;;t J nring the dry season have an elevation of 1,300 to 1, 700 foet; generally the fomwr, and only upon one occasion have we determined the latter. Through this dense cloud the mountain tops pierce as islands. 'l'he following statement will gi:иe a general idea of the temperature of the sc;aboarcl. The 'interior is much warmer, buT ou account of tlw dryness of the atmosphere the effect is not so enervating to the system W' u lower temperature on the Atlantic.

The average passage of all American vcsecls that arrived from Atlantic ports was 187 days. In 1851 only two clippers made the passage iu less than 100 days-the Surprise in 9G, aud the Flying Cloud in 90, botl1 from K cw York.

Tlic shortc8t pa~sage made from Kew York to San Fmnrisco by steamship, via th0 I~thmus of l'anama, was by the l\Ioses Taylor on tlie eastern side, and the Golden AgP ou tl1e we,tern; their actual running time Hi days 23 hours; total time from dock to wharf 21 day~, 2 hours, 13 minutes, arriving at San Francisco February 26, 1856. The clipper Northern Light, of Bo~ton, is nиported to have made the run from San }'ranci~co to New York, in ballast, in 75l; days, and the Trade \Vind, with cargo, in 84 days. ииnw average time of passage is about 100 dap.

Statistics.-I'n:vious to the discovery of gold in California, San Francisco bay furnished few inducements for traders or whalers to visit. Cattle were cheap, but about the only provisions to he obtained, and these were valuable solely for tlieir hide and tallow ; "fine fat bullocks, weighing from 400 to 500 pounds,_ liide indmleJ, were purchased aL $;) each, and sheep at $2."-(Belcher, Vol. 1, page 135.) "All the forts' were in rnius, and uot even a single gun rnounterl" at the time of his visit in 1837, and Wilkes's description of the few misPrablc adobe buildings at Tcrba B11ena, the site of San Franci~co, fully proves how fast the country was driving to wreck. In 1848 the resources, the population, and geography of the 'state were almost unknown; hut since then she has comm::mded the attention of the world. She stands alone as an example of all past time of a country emerging so suddenly from obscurity, and at one gigantic stride a~snming the importance and complicated relations of a large empire. In less than fifteen years she has acquire<l a population of over 1ialf a million, and has developed the wonderful resources comprised within her limited boundaries. On the site of half a dozen adobe buildings has riBen a city of 90,000 inhabitants, in whose streets is SC'en the dress aud heard the tongue of every nation. The la~t census represents the taxable property of San Francisco at S36,96"/,499, and that of the entire State at 8148,198,540. Over oOO ships, under every known flag, lmve been anchored at one time in the harbor of San Frandsco. 'l'he commercial enterpri~e cleveloped has given birth to a new era of naval architecture; the old-fashioned full, clumsy-bowecl sl1ips, that canied the early adventurers round Cape Horn, and made their passages in sometlling less than a year, have played out their part, and have been succeeded. by the famed clippers. In 1860 not one of the old cleserteil hulks disfigured the harbor. In the :first three quarter:< of 1849 no lesR than 509 large vessels ente1иed the bay; at the end of August of that year there were 62,000 tons of sliippiug at anclrnr, exclusive of vessels running on the Sacramento, San Joachim, the adjacent hays, and in the coasting trnJc. On th!" 24th of September over 11,000 tons of shipping entered the Golden Gate, and at the end of September there were 94,500 tons in the harbor. For a city one year old, and ] 7,500 mile,; from tl1e nearest. eastern ports, this may well be viewed as rnarvellou8.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
The difference noticeable between the vessels entered from and cleared for American ports is owing to

the fact that these vessels arc not I'e<p1irer1 to clear at the custom-house, and therefore many departures arc
not noticed. For the year 1860 the reported tonnage of vessels entered was 538,081, and cleared, 393,355. Table showillg the total tonnage entired from eastern States and from foreign ports, with tlie amount <ff freights pair111pon the cargoi,s.

It would be doing injustice to the State not to give a few facts relating to her principal mineral wealth. The average amount of gold taken from the country during the nine years 1850-'59 has been fully $55,000,000 per annum; the average value of the exported cotton crop of the United States for the same period was $105,908,327, aud of the breadstuffa and provisions $46,022,165.

The following figures will exhibit the marked influencP which t11e gol<l product of California lrns liacl upon the coinage of the United States. For the 57 year~ prPvio1rn to l 850 the total gold, silver, and copper coim1ge was $162,161,731; of thi~ $"\:l,340,107 waA gold. Prnm .January 1. 18~0, to .June 30. 1S61, the gold coinage was $583,698,592; the silve1-, $53,146,SU ; the copper, $1,395,7 40; or a total of $638,211,146 in eleven and a half years. The entire deposit of domestic gold, eince tl1e organization of the mint, has been $523,529,409, of which California produced $50] ,2\l0,998. California placer gold has a dark color from its light coating of oxide of iron; but, when fused, its light color indicates a large per-centage of silver. The average fineness of California gold, as cletermined by some thousand assays at the Unitecl States mint, Philadelphia, is 885 thousandths, or 88~ per cent. pure gold, and l 1.5 thousandths, or lln per cent.. of silvf'r. The quantity of platinoid metals found in the gold il'l small, about l~ pound of iridosrnin liaving been obtained from about 25 tons of the golcl ( 10 03uoo ), but the greater part had, of course, prli>Sed into the coin, tl1e coarse grains only being left. The recent developments of the silver mines of Nevada Territory, on the eastern boundary of California, lead to the conclusion that not less than $12,000.0000 of silver will be produced from them in 1862. Agriculturc.-The amount of land in California adapted to the purposes of agriculture is estimated at 41,622,400 acres, exclusive of the swamp and oYcrflowe<1 lands, estimated at 5,000,000; which, when reclaimed, will produce every variety of crop. On tlw Sacramf'nto the CX}lf'riment is being made to cultivate rice with Chinese labor. The amount of grazing land is estimated at 30,000,000 acres. The amount of l:md under cultivation in 1856 was 578,963 acrce; and of that enclosed for the 1rnrposcs of agriculture, abont 120,000. The amount in wheat was 176,869 acres, and the product 3,979,03:2 bushels; in barley 154,67.J. acres, and the product 4,639,678 bushels; in oats 37 ,602 acres, and the product 1,:263,309 bushels. Part of this season was characterized by a severe drought. Irr 1858 the amount of land umlcr cultiva6on was 7fi6,734 acres. The amount in wheat was 186,464 acres, yielding 3,568,669 busl1cls. Napa county was the l1caviest whratиgrowing district; lG,000 acres yielcled an average of 3lk bushels to the acre. The presidf'l1t of tlw State Agricultural Society, in l1is address of 1856, before that body, snys: "It it is now a well-ascertained fact, established by several years' experience, that California stands without a rival in respect to her capacity for producing wheat and other small grairm. She produces it in larger quantities to the acre, of better quality, with more certainty, and with less labor, than any other country in the known world." In 1858 the number of acres under cultivation for barley was 237 ,692, producing li,382,718 bushels, exceeding the aggregate of the crops of the united States in 1850. Dr. Trask, in the "Geology of the State," says: "Toward the foot-hills of the mountains on the west of the San Joachim valley is a low table of the valley, apparently destitute of water, either for the support of vegetation or animal life; in some parts this land has a slight gravelly appearnuee, but thi~ is uot general. On one rancho, situated on tl1is plateau, tliere have bcФ:n two full crops of badcy harvested from the same piece of ground, and when I visited this place, iu October, the thinl crop was Leiu;,;и then harrowed iu, the whole having occurred within the term of 273 [ con~ccutivc) clays."-( Page 54.) The following extract from the report of the visiting committee for 1856 will best illustrate the extra ordinary capacity of the soil for the culture of this important grain: "Near Ah-itio, Santa Clara county, there is a field of barley, fifty acres in extent, which has averaged the present season forty-three bushels to the acre This is the fifth crop from a single sowing; it has received no special care, and may be regarded as a memorable example of a succession of volunteer crops." In 18.58 the number of acres under cultivation for oats was 44,616, and the produce 1,322,221 busbcfa. Crops of this grain have frequently averaged 75 bushels to the acre, and one crop from 32 acres, in Alameda county, averaged 134 bushels in 1856. In Del Norte county, during the year of 1858, two crops of oats yielded au average of 125 and 157 bushels, respectively, and a cTOp of barley J 00 bushels to the acre. The cultivation of the grape, and its manufacture into wines and brandies, is rapidly assnmiug a degree of importance, and increasing to such an extent that these products muRt soon become one of the most reliable and lucrative branches of the resources of the State. The experience of the last fe"' years has proved conclusively that this country produces this fruit in the greatest variety and abundance, and in a few years will surpass the most extensive wine-producing countries of the world. 'J'he number of vines in cultivation in 1856 was 1,532,224, and the average yield over fifteen pounds of fruit. The number of all kinds of fruit trees that year was 1,296,783, and the fruit far superior to any on the Atlantic or Gulf seaboard.

In 1857 the number of vines was 3,954,548, and the average yield 14 prmnds. The number of all kinds of fruit trC'PS was l,D63,349. The partial returns for 1858 indicated an increase of seventy-five per cent. over 1857. The two great staples, cotton and flax, will render the country independent of other places for her manufactures, whibt the procluctiou of silk bids fair to go liand in hand with both. 'l'he true wealth of the country has bnt commenced its development, and in a short period she will successfully compete with the Atlantic States and Europe for the markets of tlie Pacific. Regular mail communication is maintained by steam8hips witl1 the Atlantic and the Gulf States twiceи a month, crossing the Isthmu8 of l'anama by 47z miles of railroad; tl1e transit from steamer to steamer' occupying four hours. l'or the year ending June 30, 1856, th(.; number of letters conveyed by this route was 2,3G;3,902, and newspapers 3,453,817; the number of letters and newspapern exchanged between the United States and Grmt Britain, in British mails by tl1e Collins, Cunard, Bremen, and Havre lines, for tl1e same time, was 3,909,128 (letters,) and 3,196,014 (newspapers.) The comparison speaks well for the modern El Dorado. The entrance to San Francisco bay is supposed to have been first seen by Bartolome Fcrrelo, pilot and successor to Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who, running llown the coast with a gale strong from the north, on the 3d of March, 1;343, descried what he supposed to be the mouth of a great river, having every appearance of draining a large extent of country; and steering SE. imd E.SE. he soon after sighted Point PinoR, and on the 5th the port in tl1e Island of J nan Rodriguez, where Cabrillo is supposed to have died. If this account is correct, he was the first European that beheld the Golden Gate. Sir Francis Drake visited California, which he named New Albion, in 1579, and we arc of opinion tliat in this bay he overliauled and repaired his vessel; "it having pleased God to send him into a fair and good bay, 11иith a good wind to enter tl1e same." Curiously enough, we find the statement that "there is 'no paTt of the earth here to be taken up wherein there is not some probable Bhow of gold and silver." In this harbor he remained over a month "trimming " his ships and taking possession of the country. A land discovery of the bay was made in 1769 by Gaspar de Portola, who left San Diego to establish a Jesuit colony at Monterey; but by travelling along the eastern slope of the Coast mountains lie passed Monterey, and towards the close of October came unexpectedly upon tlie shores of a great bay, which they supposed to be the Port St. :Francisco of the old navigators. Having no supplies, the party returned to San Diego. Vancouver visited the bay in 1792 and 1793, and gives a good general map of the entrance. The presidia of San Francisco was then occupied by SpaniRh troops. 'l'he first accurate hydrograpbic survey was made by Capt. Fred. W. Beechy, in the Blossom, in N ovemluor, 1826, he carrying his work to the Strait of Karquines. In October, 1837, Capt. Sir Edward Belcher ascended the Sacramento with the boats of the Sulphur, anil starting from the "Fork" carried the survey down the river to connect with Beecliy's survey. The "l<'ork" he calls Point Victoria, and places in latitude ::JSD 46' 47 11 , and 0░ 47' 31''.5 east of the observatory on Y erba Buena. This point is formed by the confluence of the Rio de las Plumas, or Feather river, with the Sacramento, about 20 miles above Sacramento city. The river, but a short distance above his starting point, was fordab1c, and thence to its mouth traversed in its meanderings 150 miles. The head of steamboat navigation is at Reu :Bluffs, in latitude 400 10 1 и The Coast Surny charts of 1857 furniEh all that can be desired in regard to the lower part of the bay of San Franci~co, the upper bay1, and the waters approaching the mouth of the Sacramento.
DUXBURY POINT AND REEF.

From Point Boneta to Duxbury Point, forming the west side of Ballenas bay, the course is W. by N. i N ., and the distance 9i miles. The point, sometimes called Ballenas, is a table land about 100 feet high, which stretcl1es along the coast for a mile or more, and gradually rises to a narrow, nearly treeless иridge, 1,389 feet high at its greatest elevation, and running in a straight line 25t miles NW. f W. to Tamales Point. The old Californians expressively call it the Cuchilla Grande. Parallel to this ridge on the east, and starting from the west end of the great cross ridge of Table mountain, rnns another to the northwestward, and the depression between them, abreast of Duxbury Point, forms the Ballcnas bay, as it does the Tomalcs bay further

up the coast. This depression forms a long narrow valley, well watered and timbered, and in many places cultivated. Two streams running into each bay, have their sourcea nearer the bay from which each runs. Duxbury reef makes out li mile SE. i S. from the southern extremity of the point, and ~tretching towards Point Boneta, forms a safe anchorage in northerly weather. From the tail of the reef to the rocky point E.KE. from it, the distance is three miles, and from this line to the greatest bend of the bay the distance is Iii mile. In this btty the three-fathom linD makes off three-quarters of a mile from the southeast face of Duxbury Point, but approaching the low sand "Leach cast of the; rntrrow entrance to the lagoon. l!'rom four to eight fathoms of water, with a regular bottom of' sand and mud, arc formed in the bay, and six fathoms quite cloee to the reef. From Duxbury Point to the bluff, at the entrance to the lagoon, the distance is l::!: mile XE. by N. In June, 1860, the British barque Camilla, from San Francisco to lllelbourne, drifted in a dead calm near Duxbury reef; and let go her anchors in six fatlwms. When she swung to the i;well and current her stern struck, and she thumped for four hours. Quite close to Duxbury Point the steamship S. S. Lewis went ashore, April 9, 1853, in a thick fog and calm, while running at her ordinary speed. She was Lacke(l off aud ran ashore again within a fow hundred yards to the 110rthward, and was totally lost in the breakers. The lagoon north of the bay is at the foot of the mountains, and, except small crooked channels, is bare at low tides, and filled with small islets. The south ~idc of this lagoon is bounded by a long;, narrow sand spit, stretching so nearly across it as to leave au entrance of but 100 yards wide at the southwest part of it. Only a few small vessels run between this place and San FranciFco. The shore north of Boneta is bold and high, presenting a mmиked aml peculiar undulating surface at right angles to the sea front. This characteristic is well delineated on the Coast Survey map of the approaches and entrance to San .Francisco bay, published in 1857. North of' Duxbury the hard rocky shore continues hold and high, but gradually merges into cliffs, consisting chiefly of yellowish clay and sand resting upon granite, and, aE the surface is rc-gularly undulating, with the direction of the alternate ridges and vallcyc; at right angles to the shore, the wearing action of the surf forms a continuous series of round-topped, bright, vertical Lluffs, averaging nearly 100 feet 11igh, and presenting a very noticeable feature from the sea. Its rCRembl1mco to portions of the coast of Englaml was one of' the reasons which induced Drake to apply the name New Albion to the country in June, 157!.l. 'l'he mountains in tlrn lmck grnullll riRe over 2,000 fol't, all(l the "Tahle mountain" of Beechy attnins an elevation of' 2,604 feet, stretches nearly two miles inland at right angles to the coast, and forms a promi11f'nt mark from seaward and from the bay of San Francisco. A few large trees are seen along the top of the main ridge running parallel with the coast and lid1irnl the valley, connecting BalknaR arnl Tomal"s hay~. Tahle mountain is a very sharp rirlge, showing flat-to11pcd only iu two directions.

The Tamai, Numpal, and Suysum tribes tatooed themselves and spoke the same language ; the first lived in the northwest, and the last two in the north.
SIR FRANCIS DRAKE'S BA.Y.

From the tail of Duxbury reef to the west end of Los Reyes the cour~e is W. fl N., and distance 17 ~ miles. To the east end the course is W. by N., ilistance 14~ miles. From Duxbury the sl1orc is bold and compact, running nearly NW. by \V. for about 10 miles, then curving regulnrly to the we~tward, changing to a low shore, until it reaches its greatest latitude at the Estern de Limantour, which hears N. by E. t E. &om the east end of Los Reyes, distant three miles; thence the line curves to the soutlnvard arid southwest, one mile west of the point, leaving a long, bigh, narrow point stretching to the east, and off which the

breakers extend half a mile. This curving shore-line forms Sir Francis Drake's bay, which affords a large and admirable anchorage in heavy northwest weather; and by anchoring close in under the north side of the point, in four or five fatlwnrn, hard bottom, good but contracted andwrage is obtained in southeast gales, as the swdl rolling in from the S"'- is broken by the reef.

Several e~tern.и or lagoons open into the north side of the bay, but their entrances arc very narrow and shoal. 'l'he largest is the Estr>ro de Limantour, which Ftretches to the northward over three miles, and one of its numerous arms :ipproacl1es within a mile of the ocean beach, five mileH nortl1 of Point Reyes head. The entrance to thi~ lagoon has eight feet of water, and is generally marked by breakers on either hand. Coasters can enter with the prevailing northwest wind. It is called Drake's Estero on t]ie Coast Survey chart of Sir Francis Drake's bay, publi~l1etl in 18GO. It was named after Limantour, notorious for his attempted great land claim fraud in California. He was a Frenchman, but a citizen of Mexico, and asserted that in trading upon this coast in 184 l he lost the Mexican vessel Ayaclrnco at the entrance to this estero. Drake's bay is the Port Francisco of the Spaniards, of about 15fl5. It was certainly known before the time of Vizcaino, who, liaving separated from his tender, sought her in Port Francisco, and, according to Vem'ga's account, "to ~ce if anything was to be found of the San Augustine, which, in the year 1595, had, l1y onler of his majesty and the viceroy, been sent frorn the Philippines by tl1e governor to survey the coast of California, under the direction of Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeiion, a pilot of known abilities, but was driven ashore iu this harbor by the violence of the wind; and among others on board the San Augustine was the pilot Francisco Volanos, -who was also chief pilot of the squadron." '!'his pilot iecognized the bay as being that where lw was wrecked.
POINT REYES.

This is the most prominl'nt and remarkable llC'adlnnd north of Point Concepcion. It is distinctly visible from tbe entrance to San Frauci~co hay, and the summit qf the ridge presentB an irregular jagged outline, with the highest part about one-fourth of its length from tlie western extremity. It" southern face is a precipitous wall of liard sienitic granite, rising boldly from the ocean, attaining an elevation of 597 feet in 300 yarils, auil stretching nearly in a straight line E. by N. and иw. by S. for threll miles. This direction is ptиcnli:u on the coast, mHl would not be expected from a consideration of the trend of the coast m&mtains and of the Faralloues, which arc in line N\V. and SE. On tl1e north side the cape falls away regularly to a low undulating neck of land, cut up by esteros making in from Drake's bay. "\Yhcn made from the southward it is rni;-;ed as a long, high i8land; bnt on approaching it from the westward it is projected upon the mountainH rur111i11g north from Tahle monntain, and its characte1иistics arc not. r;o rearlily recognized. Its base is very broken and rocky, and bordered by crags and hundreds of rocks. but may be boldly approached, aud eight fathoms, lrnrd bottom, obtained within less than a quarter of a mile. Off the eastern extremity a reef makes out half a mile in continuation of the point. U110n this reef it, brcakR heavily in bad southerly weather, but nine fathom~ can he had close to the breakers. Off the western head a depth of 12 fathoms is found quite near to the rocks. V cssels bound to San }'rancisco from the northward ah,иays make Los Reyes, and, when up to it, sight t.wo mountains on the southern peninsula of Sein Francisco as falands. One of these is Blue mountain, 1,100 foet high, and the other, AbbPy l1ill, 1,2,'iO feet. In 1859, while occupying tlie Coast Survey station on Point Reyes liill, l,389 feet in altitude, and 8} miles NE. ~ N. from Point Rl'yes head, we observed a barque, during a perfect cairn, having no steerage way, and turning round several times, drift to the northward past Point Reyes head, at the rate of one mile per hour. She was two miles to the westward of the head. On this and subsequent occasions we noticed the discolored water of the Sacramento from San :Francisco bay close in shore, and extending to the northward

In this region Crtbrillo found the mountains covered with snow. There can be little doubt that he also saw the Farallones. The present name was given by Viscaino, who anchored under the head in January, 1G03, whilst searching for the wreck of the San Augustine.
SOUTH FARALLON.

The southern and principal one of the six rocky islets known as the :Farallone~ de los Frayles, lies off the Golden Gate at a distance of 23z miles; the whole group is diFposcd in a nearly staight line running NW. from the southern one. This is the largest and highest, extending nearly a mile cast and west, attaining an elevation of about 340 feet abo,'C the sea, and presenting to the eye a marn of broken, jagged rocks, upon which no vegetation cxistF, except a fc-w stunted weeds. The f(lcks nrc sharp, m1gular m<1oses, which, becoming detached by the operations of natural cm1~ei.;, roll down u11on tl1c more kw! parti- of the islet and cover it with irregular boulders. :!:\ otwithsta11c1ing that it is the outcrop of au immense dy kc of granite, the condition of the rnperficial portion is such thM it could be separated into small fragments b,;- a pick or crowbar. A morn desolate au<l barren place can hardly be imagined. From the hill:; about the Golden Gate the South Farallon is plainly visible, rising in regular pyramidal form. Vessels from ihe westward, running for the Golden Gate, should keep to the sontlnntrd of the South Farallon, especially in thick weather and at night. 'l'o the westward of it a clepth of 50 fathoms i.i obtained at a distance of tliree miles, shoaling to 20 fathoms in two rnilPs; whereas, inside of it, the bottom is very regular at 30 fathoms for ten miles, and then decreases regnlarly to the bell-boat. On the SE. side of t11e island thtirc is said to be good holding-ground in 15 fathoms. 'l'he San Francisco pilot-boats cruise off the island. An extended and detailed examination around the island has not yet been puLlishcd. Tides.-The con-ected establishment, or mean interval between the time of the moon's transit and the time of high water, is Xh. XXXYIIm., and the lliffercncc between the greatest and least intervals Ill. l6m. The mean rise and fall of tides is 3.G feet; of spring tides, 4A feet; and of neap tides, 2.8 feet. The mean duration of the flood is 6h.. 18m., and of the ebb Git. 09m. To find the times of high and ]ow waters, first compute them for San Ji~raneisco, and from the numbers thus obtained subtract !ft. 29m. for the South Farallon. The ship Lucas was wrecked on this islet in a fog, November 9, 1858, and 23 lives were lost.
SOlHH FARALLON LIGHT.

The tower stands on the highest peak of the principal island. It ie built of brick, 17 feet in height, and is surmounted by a lantern and illuminating apparatus of the first order of thr ~ystcm of Fresnel. It is a re 1иolrh1g white light, showing a Jlrolonged.flash ef 10 seconds every minute throughout the horizon. The time of the flash varies on dllfcrent nights.

It is ercctecl over a natural hole, in the roof of a subterranean passage, connected with ancl open to the ocean, and fa blown by tlle rush of air through the passage, caused by the sea breaking into its mouth. The sound should be heard in the vicinity at all times, (its loudness clepending upon the height of the tide and the waves,) except about an hour and a half before and after low water, when the sea does not enter the mouth of the passageи It is said to have been heard at a distance of seven or eight miles .

.THE MIDDLE FARALLON
is a single rock, between 50 and 60 yards in diameter, and rising 20 or 30 feet above the water. It lies N. 56░ ,V,, distant 2! miles from the light-house on the South l!~arallon. Its geographical positiQn is, latitude 37░ 43' 31.6 11 north, and longitude, 123░ 00' 54.9'' west.

POINT TOUALES AND TOM ALES BAY.

Northward of I'unta de 1os Reyes we find a long reach of broad white sand beach, backed by sand dunes, an<l extending in a N. i E. direction about 12 miles, curving to the northwest, and changing to a high precipitous coast running to Point Tomall's, which bears N. by ,Y. 15 miles from Los Reyes. Threeи Б1uarter~ of a mile before reaching the point, a rocky islet 80 feet in height is seen close in shore. Eight miles aboYe Point R('yps is the opening to an estero, the north point of which is low an<l sandy. The wirlr,r arm runs one mile towards tl1e hl'ad of the western branch of the Estem de Limantour, and little more than that distance from it. The other arm runs nearly a mile and a half to the northwestward. The ridge forming 'Tomalcs Point and the western shore of Tamales bay is the northen1 extremity of that starting from Duxbury Point. About 4;j: miles from the point the ridge is 673 feet high, with slightly lower ground a few miles south. It is where tlie sand dunes strike this ridge tliat the coast cl1auges its character; thence to the point it is bold and rocky, with breakers about one-tl1ird of a mile off the point, and on the prolongation of the ridge, which averages less than tliree-quartern of a mile in Lreauth for the last four miles. The b.ay of Tomales extends from Tamales Point SE. if E. for 12i miles, with an everage width of scven-eigl1ths of a mile. The entrance is narrow, and obstructed by a bar having a depth of 10 feet, between sandy lumps of sevren feet. '!'he bar lies nearly half a mile east of the extreme point, and 400 yards from the bluffs. It is exposed to thl' full force of the northwest swell, and with the least swell from seaward it breaks acro&s the whole entrance. For two or three miles this bay is contracted, but has a narrow, deep channel close under the western shore. :Four miles within the point lies a small i8land near the middle of tl1e bay; beyond it tli(' i1q1t.h of water becomes more regular. Its shores are becoming thickly settlec], and trade in agricultural products has increased so much that a small .steamer has been put upon the route to San Francisco. In 1852 the ship Oxford, after getting on the rocks outside of Tamales ridge, was deserted, floated off, drifted into the bay over the bar with the flood tide, grounded on the flats, and at the following high water :floated off again; but no onp being aboard, she again drifted on the flats and lay inside of Sand Point for some years.. In February, 1857, the waters of the bay cl1anged to a deep purple color, and the fish died in such great numbers that the beacheR aml water were covered with them. This bay was known as Port Juan Francisco by the Spaniards when Vancouver visited the coast in 1792. In old Mexican grants it is called Tamales, and sometimes Tomales. The old Californians invariably pronounce it like the former. Be1cher enoneously designates it as a part of Bodega bay.

It has been frequently held out as a warning not to miRtake Bodega Head for Punta de los Heyes, but there exists no reasonable ground for raising a question on this subject, although navigators, who have lost or jeopmиdized vessels, offer as an excuse the great similarity of the coast and headlands to those near the Golden Gate. \Ye have never been ablc> to tletect it. The highest part of thP head is about 265 fret above the ocean. From an examination of this section we believe that it is the continuation of the Tomales ridge.

BODEGA BAY.

From Tamales Point to Bodega Head thl' course is X\\'. ~ \V., and the distance 4]l miles. The averagl' width of the lmy to the eaRhrnrd of thP above line is lif mile, with the shore running nearly a parallel course. It is bordered by numerous rocks, is abrupt, and reacbcR a height of 594 fret 1L'8S than a mill' inland. The anchorage lies between the head and the mouth of the Estero Americano, (cnllL'<l Avatclrn hy thl' H1rnsiaus,) which lies E. 16░ N., ::!;} miles from the hmd. One milt' wt~st of the estcro a low, narrow rnn<l Fpit 1! mile long, and covered with bushes, stretches towards the head, within onP hundr('d yards of it, where a passage exists for the waters of the extensive lagoon north of the sa.nd spit, haviug small and intricate eha11nels, but almost destitute of water at low tides. 'l'hc anchorage is half a mile outside of tl1is passag1╗ and about N. E. of t11c rocky islet, in five or six fathoms, hard bottom of coarse sand and small patches of day. It is protected hy the head and the low rocky islet and reef, about thrce-qnartcrF of a mile off the sontl11?ast facp, from the foll force of the northwest swell, which genc:rnlly rolls in dis'l.greeably in the open 1mrt of tl1e bay if the weather is heavy. The reef is densely covered with kelp. and the breakers usually indicate its poi<ition. Between the islet ancl the head there is a narrow 4~-fatliom JHlR~agc opl'ning dirPc-tly upon the anchorageи In coming from the northwest in rnmmer thi~ chanuel is available; but in beating out it is too contraettиd to be safe. During the winter season it is necessary to anchor well out, to be ready to slip and run, as the sea-room is very contracted and the swell heavy. Some vessels have ridden out hea\иy southea,;ters, but several have been lost. In beating out, the only danger is the reef off the head. On account of the general depression of the coast hillR behind Bodega bay, to abont .500 or 600 fort elevation, and the valley in which the Estero Americano lies being perpendicular to the eoast line. the summer winds draw in towards the Petaluma valley with great force. The trunks of tl1c oak tre<иs rise straitrht for about 10 feet, then bend almost at right angles, without a branch for 10 or 15 feet, and t('rminate in a clump of branches all dragged out by the force of the wind. Fogs am found drawing in eooncr and more frequently than upon any other part of the coast.

To find the times of higl1 and low waters, fir:;t compute them for San Francisco, anrl from the numbers thus obtained subtract 49 minutes for Bodega bay. Bodega bay was discovered l1y Hcccta and Bodega in 1775, and place<l in latitude 38░ 18' north.' It was partially exami1wd l1y l\fr. Vnget, umler Vancouver's direction, in 1792. In 1812, by permission of the Spanish go╗ernor of California, it was occupied by the Russian American Company, who aftcrwanls refused to give it up, and retained i1ossession until 1841. They erected two large wooden house~ under the bluff, at the entrance to the lagoon ; hut these buildings were in ruins at the time of our visit in 1853. A n:cPnt Hussian work ( 1848) says: '"l'l1c bay of Bodega (Tuliatrelivo) was fully described in 1819, by Captain llagemeister. It is similar to the port of Trinidad, in being convenient only during the summer, when the northwest wind~ blow along the coast; at any other season it is dangerous. Both its indentations within the N"\Y. and SE. headlands arc shallow and contracted, and therefore it is necessary to anchor in tlie open rualhitP:ul." In 183!.l, under Bclcher's orders, Kellett commenced the survey of Bodega, in the schooner Starling, and was soon after joined by the Sulphur. T1ic lirw rif cqital magnetic variation of 1G 0 east crosses the coast line of Bodega bay in latitude 38░ 15', and in latitude 38░ 06' crosses tlw 1:2.tth degree of longitude. This is for January, 1859. The line moves southward about a mile and a half annually. Fort Ross.-'l'he rocky, contracted, and unsafe anchorage off this place is .N\V. ~ N. from Los Reyes, distance :J:! rnill'f', and 15 miles from Bullt-ga Head. The large white buildings of the Russians on the rising ground, and about 100 feet above the sea, arc the only marks for making it, and the shore is so steep and guar<lr~a hy rocks and reef,; as to render approach dangerous.

On some charts it is erroneously plac!,d in Bodrga bay, with a large river runniug from the northward into the bay. Belcher Elates it to be 30 miles north of Bodega. The ,;hore lwtween Bod<'ga lfoail and Fort Uo;,1s cnrves slightly to the eastward of the line joining the two places. Sane.I dunes commence 1 ~ mile from the soutl1crn point of the liead, anrl extend 2~ miles to the mouth of a small stream called Salmon creek; these duues are bordered by a broad sand beach. Nine and a half miles from the bead the S,1m:ia11sl"a of the Hussians empties into the sea, breaking through the coast hills that here reach an elevation of 2,200 feet. During the summer months a dry bar f'urms completely across the mouth of the river, so tbat the travel along the coast passes over it. It requires heavy rains to break through it, and :forms again after a few weeks of dry weather. During the summer the lied is dry above Healdsburg, 30 miles from the mouth, and can be forded in several places in that distance. Before breaking through the coast hills it comes from the northward through a broad, fertile valley. The

Nortl1ward of this river again commence tl1e higl1 coast hillR, eon:red with timber, which gradually approaches the coast, and reaches it about half way to Fort Hoss. The Hussian vessels used this as a distinctive mark for making that anchorage. "\Yhere the timber commences to skirt the coast a bold B)lUl' of the mountains comes directly upon the Rea. .At Fort ItosR there is a small extf'.nt of opPn, cultivated ground, morlerately low, but backed by the high wooded country. The coast and coast hills to the northward are mostly coven'<l with den~e fore8ts of immense redwood, pine, and a tl1ick undergrowth.

A reeommendatiou has been made for a ligltt-hou,.c u11on this point, because it is much needed by thl' mail arnl co&sting st╗amer~ and sailing vessels. The appearance of this and other parts of the coast induced Sir Francis Drake to call the laud New Albion, whilst the same appearance and sandy line to the northward of it doubtlesA led the Spaniards to designate it La Punta de Arena. It suggests au inquiry concerning the numerous Cape Blancas tliat arc found in tl1eir voyages arnl maps. A view of Punta de Arena is given on the Coast Survey sheet of 1853. 'l'en miles above Point Arena is a small stream called the Nevarro, upon which is a lumber mill. Articles floating from this river are found on the coast to tl1e northward of it. Albi011 river.-}'rom Point Arena the first point to the northwestward is 24 miles distant, and bearing N"\Y. by N. ~. After passing Arena the coast trends to the eastwaiиd of north, and for six miles presents a low shore-line with sand beach, changing suddenly to a straight, high bluff shore with a few trees, and hacked within lialf a mile by hilb of 2,000 feet, covered to their summits with wood. Sixteen and a half miles from Arena iE the mouth oftlie Albion river. a very small stream, with the barest apology for 11 harbor at its mouth. A R:rw-mill upon this strf'am inducPR coastern to obtain freigl1ts here, hut a grt'.at rnnny of those tradiug have been lost. In 1853 the Coast Surveying steamer Active passed in, but broke her anchor on the rocky hottom. 1ffcndocino bay.-'I'weuty and a half miles from Arena, nnd four above Albion river, is a contracted inilcntation called )lendocino bay, avaiiable for a few vessels in summer, but dangerous in winter. The northern and !'Outhern points are about thr<>e-qnarters of a mile apart, and the eastern l'hore retreats nearly lmlf a mile. At the southern head are several small rocks, and one large islet surrounded by rocks, off which arc heavy hrmkers. 1\Iidway lictween the 11eads is a small reef upon >vhich the fea breaks heavily, with very litt k swell. I )eep water iR found close around this reef. Off the northern head is very bold water close to it. Into the northeast part of the bay enters the river ]\'oyon, or Rio Grande, between two and three hundred yard~ widl', with a good cbann1,J on the soutl1ern side, a broad sand flat on the northern, and a bar at the mouth with hut a fow feet of water, and upon which it always breaks. The eastern shore is bold and rocky. In the Foutlwa~thu p:ut i~ a sand beach, иwith a reef extending from ito centre. 'l'lw Lay form;; ~o sliglit an indentation in the coast-line that it is difficult to find without acquaintance with ib minutest peCllliarities, as there arc no prominent marks by which to determine it. The north head is a tablr> bluff about 60 foet high, and c1e~titute of trees to the northward and some distance inshore. The south bluff is likcwioe lleotituk of trees, but more irregular in outline than the other. V cssels bound for it in Bummer work a littl;и to windward; tl1en nm boldly in towards the north point, upon which the houses become recognized, keep a~ close :rn 1iosRible along the shore, gradually decreasing the distance to 100 yards just off the south end of the point in G fatl10111~, run on about 150 yards past the point, head np handsomeJy, and anchor in 5 or 6 fathoms hard bottom. It is a bad berth in summer, and in winter a ve~sel must anchor far enough out to be able to slip her cable and go to sea upon the first appearance of a eoutheaster. Several vessels have been driven ashore liere. An exten8ive saw-mill i~ located on the north side of the river, some distance up; formerly (1853) it was on the north head, and a stationary engine was placed near the mouth of the river to draw loaded cars up the inclined plane, whence they were drawn to the mill.

From the point ju~t north of l\lendocino bay, (the first one made from Arena,) the f'hore runs nearly straight for 28 miles N. by "\V. 1 "\V., being- low and bounded by rocks for 12 miles, when the back hilhi reach the water and present au almof't vertical front 2,000 feet in height. :Frnru the deepest part of the bight the general trend of the coast to Cape llfendocino is Kl\'. if IY., and distance 45 miles, and for the whole of tl1is distancP it is particularly bold and forbidding, the range of hills runningи parallel to the shore and ri8ing dirPctly from it. It. has lieen found impos~ible to travel along thiis stretch of seaboard; and the trail turns well into the interior vallPys. }'or J anua.ry, 1859, the liue of equal magnetic Yariat.iou of 17░ east cros8e~ the coast-line in latitude 39 ░ 58', and in latitude 39░ 48' crosses the 125░ of longitude. This line moves southward about a mile and a half annually.

From tlie compact shore above described a plateau, destitute of wood, and being from GO to 300 feet in height, makes ~quare out just above latitude 40" N. for a distance of half a mile, affording an anchorage from northwest winds, and may, perliaps, be regarded as a harbor of refuge for small coasters which have experienced heavy weatl1er off C:ipe J\frndocino, and are shorL of wood arnl water, both of which may Le obtained here from one or two gulches opening upon the sea. From Point Arena it bears N"\Y. by N. 1" :X., distant 65 miles. The whole sea-face of the bluff is bounded by thousands of rocks above and below water, and ves:>els corning from tl1e north for shdtr'r rnu~L give it a wide berth, rounding it within one-third of a mile, and anchoring in 5 fathoms, hard bottom, about one-third of a mile from shore. In this position fresh water comes down a ravine bearing about north, and an Indian village existed in 1853 at the bottom of the wooded ravine, a little further to the eastwanl. 'l'here is always a swell here, and boat landiug may not be very easy. The secondary astronomical station of the Coast Survey was on the soutbeaot part of tl1e bluff, about 60 feet above tl1e sea.

CAPE MENDOCINO

Is 93 miles NIY. HX. from Punta de Arena. Here the range of coast 11ills from the southward appears to meet a range coming from the ea.-tward, forming a mountainons headland of about 3,000 feet high, whic11 is the weHtern limit of the northwest trend of this section of the coast. The approximate geogra1Jhical J>Of'ition of the cape is:

A primary sea-coast light is especially nec<lecl at this cape, because it jg the point wliere tl1e coast takes its great change of direction from northwest to nearly north. About t!Hec miles broad off the cape lies a reef, just under water, kno-wn as Blu11t's rocl.:.s, or reef, upon which the ~ca gl~ncrally brPaks. Thi:; reef was noticed by Vancouver as being about one league off shore.-(\" ol. 1. page 1 !!::>.) Half way between it and the cape, ancl a little to the southward, is a sunken rock whiclи has been t1i8coverccl within the la~t two or three years, but not yet accurately located. It is called Fauntleroy's rock. Steamers have passecl dangerously near it, aucl in 1857 it was distinctly seen almost under tbe wheel of the steamship Commodore. Vessels can, perhap~. paRR over it in smooth weatl1er, but with a heavy sea the water must break. Such was our description of this rock in 1858. In ,January, lSGO, the steamship Kortherner struck upon it. 'The w0ather was slightly hazy; long, large groun<l-;;well from the northwest, no wind, ancl low tide. She was bomul up the coast, and going over 10 knots per hour. As her bo"' sunk in tl1e h'ough of the; sea a very slight j:ir was folt fmиward, exciting no alarm among the uninitiated. The pumps were immediately Eounded, and the sl1ip found to be making water very fast. She heatlet1 for llurnbolclt, hut was beached uorth of Cape Fortunas, and went to pieces in a heavy southw<'Rt blow that sprang up. To the southwanl, and imrne<liately off the pitch of the cape, lie numerous rocks and rocky islets, the latter being large nncl high, with a peculiar pyramidal or sugar-loaf appearance. None of them seem to be morl' tl1a11 half a mile from tlw Hliorc, ,_.bich i1' almo~t I"'''l'PIH1icul:tr arnl cle"titutc of a Lead1. The face of the cape i~ very stPPp, rock;', and worn. Above this the general aJ>pcarnuce is rolling, and the surface covered with tim her. The pyramidal islets off it are very readily distinguished iu approaching from the north or south. A view of the cape is given on the Coast Survey rcconnaiRsance sheet of 1853. }'rom Cape Mendocino the following aiиe the bearings and distances to headlands to the northward : Trinidad Head, north, 30 miles. Ite<lding's rock, K !I W ., 56 miles. Cre~cc11t City ligl1t-house, N. by IV., 70,! miles. Capl' Orforcl, or Blanco, N. by IV. ~ IV., 14;) miles. The extent of shore-line from Point Boneta to Cape l\Iendocino is about 224 miles. 1t i:.; х;encrnlly stated that Juan Rodriguez Cahrillo named tl1is cape in honor of Dou Antonio de l\lemloza, the vic<иroy of l\lcxicn; but the highest latitude he reached was l'nnta de lot1 RcyeH, to which he in reality applied that name. It iH quite probable t11at unde1и the lee of the rocks off this cape }'errelo, the pilot am] succcswr of Cabrillo, anclwrccl on the last of February, 154:3, and named it Caho de :Fortnnas, (Cape of Peril:.:,) although he plan~s hiH position in latitude 430. The next day lie may have been off Trini<lad He:ul cxpcrhиueing heavy northerly weather, and his observations might have placed him in latitt1<lc 4"1░, but with hi,i YC>:<>1e1~. acl v1иr;,p currents, and a dead beat to windward, he coulcl not have made a degreP of latitude in n clay. Herc lie turned Lack, passed the Golden Gate on l\farc.h 3, and reached the island of Santa Cruz on thP 5tl1. It iH utterly impo;,sible that with hi:; small crazy vessels he could make 800 miles (the distance from latitude 440 to Santa Cruz) in four days. Seven miles soutl1 of .l\Iendocino a small stream called the )fattole empties. Upon the sides of the bills in lower lfattolc, and not above a mik from the l'acific, coal oil spTings were discovered in 18G1. Along the course of this stream arc numerous bottom lantls under cultivation.

During the day the white buildi1igs woulcl be a capital mark ag:tinst the green l1ill:; and trees in the background. This vfow, now and formerly expre~setl, has been repeatedly and earnestly urged upon our attention by many captains, merchants, and tlw pilofa of Humboldt bay. A view of Red Bluff and tlH: hack hills is given ou the Coast Survey sheet of 1853.

This, the most dangerons of the roadi;tea<ls rnrnally resortea to on the coast, has acquired much irnportanc<' on account of the town (C1иescent City) being the depot for the supplic~ of miners working tlie gold r1iggingA on the Klamath, Trinity, nnc1 flalmrm rivers. It iK fillnr1 wiLh RunkPn nwks aml re<'f~, and lm8 a goodly nmnher showing a hove water. No vessel shoul<l think of gaining an anchorage lwre without a pilot, or iierfed knowledge of the bicldcиn dangers. Xo sunken rock.A arc now known to cxiRt outside of tl1e line of vi~ibk mieH, except one uwnsh, EnV. ~ \'V., and a little more than half a mill" distant from the light-house. A dq1th of 10 fathoms exiRts all aronncl it, ancl seven or eight fathoms outsi.11' of thr, viRihle rockK. 'J'l1c usual anchorage i~ on n line between the light-hou~e aur.1 the north o.ide of thr' large i8let three-;:prnrters of a mile east of it, in 3::\; fathoms, hard bottom. 'To Teach this 1iosition run for tl1e ~mall, ronnd rock ]waring S. 55░ E., sPvcn-eighths of a mile from thr> light-l10nse; pass it on the east side, giving it a berth of 100 yards; steer N. by \V. :i W. for three-eighths of a mile, liassing 100 yards rm the uast of Fmmtlnoy rock, which is covercil at three-quarters flDod. If this rock Le covered, its position i,; generally marked by a brl'akcr. It is neceBsary to keep it close aLoard, because there is a sharp bayonf't rcick having only two feet of water upon it, and :!00 yards to the eastward. Head up for the town and ancl10r in 3;f fatl10mi5. To enter or leave it at night, a~ is done by the mail ancl coaoting ftcamen;, requirce a perfoct local knnwfoilge of the dangers and peculiarities of the landmarks. Coasting steamers, in fine wcthcr, usually anchor close inshore to discharge freight, which is roeeivecl in lighters. A wharf has been built ont from Battery Point, and landiHg is now car;ily cfi'ecte<l in good wcathe1'. In southeasters the breakers wa:ih oYer it. 'I'hi8 bay was :fir.-t ,;urvcyeil in 1853, nnd again in 18;i9, from which our directions are in part drawn up, but principally from our examination in 1857. The following report (1859) will show clearly tl1e c1angerous character of the roadsteacl, an<l the knowledge re<juired to enter it: "During the progress of the rcsm-Yt'y of Crescent City harbor, we found stwcral new, dangerou;, rocks ; but as they are not in tl1e clumnels followed by steamers, anrl do not interfere with the anchorage in nse, it docs not Reem necc~sary to notice them further in advance of the publication of the chart, as every one trading here knows that VP~>wl~ drn wi11g OYer nine feet should ho very ea11t ious in veutming out of the bPaten track. 'The rocki< at. that pl:u:c are of a peculiar character, standing isolated like lmyonets, with their points just below the surface, and 1иeac1y to pierce any unlucky craft that may encounter them_ After we :finished the survey, anc1 a fair way hail been selecte<l for a sailing Jiu<,, we diHcovered a very sharp rock almost directly in the passage, with it~ point only tl1ree fopt from the surface, and deep water nll around it. Thill i~ mentioned to show that, alt.hough tlte greatest care was taken in the survcиy, the character of the points of rocks is ench that it cannot be surprising if new ones 1Je found for several seasons to come." Iu 1mmmer there i<' always some swell hPre, but in winter it rolls in fearfu1!y, and vessels must choose a position t.n be ready to rim to sea at the approach of a southeast.er. Communication is maintained with San FranciRco ancl other port.s by mail and coasting steamers, which generally carry as many passengers and as much freight for this place aR they carry to the Columbia river. The town lies NtV. from the anchorage, immediately on the fow shore; old drift-logs, in some iustancP~. forming the foundation for wooden l1ouses. In August, 1853, there were. about 135 houses of all descriptions. In 1860 the population was 553, and the number of hou~cs 176.

On the day preceding, Antonio Florc,;, hi8 pilot, in the smaller vessel, supposed himself in latitude 43░ N., when~ the land fo1иmed a cape or J>oint, which he called Cape Blanco, and from that point the land ran N\V. Near the point he cli8l~overcd a large and rapid river, which he endeavored to enter, hut couh1 not from the force of the cnrrent. \\' c are inclined to believe th11t both names refer to the same cape. Vizcaino, in January, 1603, gave t11e name Caho Blanco de San Sebastian to a cape which he place~ near latitude 42░. The present name was given to the cape liy Vancouver in 1792.

In stating the di~t:mces abo~иe, we should rn<>ntion that Broughton give~ the cournc from Disappointment to Adams as SE:. by E. and the di8t.anec ahnut 4 miles. wb1иTi>aH it j,; really .5 miles. Making t.hi6 change in liis base, and all other poeitions in proportion, we find that Tongue Point comes within half a mil<' of the dctermim1tion by the triangulation f1f the coast survey, proYing Bronghton's work right, but the base wrong. From the for<>goi11g description we deduce the following facts: That but. fmc chanmиl exiot.d at the entrance to the ColumLia river in 1792; its general dir('Cti1m aerorn the bar wa8 E. by N". !J: N., passing 11 mile south of Cape Disappointme11t; it was G rnileR Ling from the outer fin~-fathom lim~ to a line joini11g Point Adams and the cape; it was I~ mile wide, and liad 11ot Jess than 4 fatlrnms in it; tlrnt the Spit Bank stretclwd nearly strnigl1t from about a mile cast of the ca11c to Chinook Point. In tl1e space bounded hy the thn~e lines joiuing (fape Disappointment, Chinook Point, and Point Adam<, .'i fathoms water wa-.; the lea.st found. The deepest channel after getting in was close under the north siile of the river eastward of Chinook Poiut, and that, between the river side of I'oint Adams and the shoal stretching from Gray'.,; Point towards it, a narrow channel cxioted with 3 fathoms in it. Broughton say,;: "The di>ocovery of this river, we were gиivcn to underetand, is claimed by the Spaniards, who call it Entra<lo de Ueta, nfter the commauder of tlw vessel, who ioi said to be its first di:scovcrer, but who never entered it; he places it in 4.G 0 ." After completing t11e rnrvey he could not get out for several dayo, and the Jenny had been unable to cross the bar during tlw entire time he was up the river. In 1813, when the English sloop-of-war Raccoon arrived in the Columbia shc found the ehoals off the entrance had considerably changed in extent and position frum the time of Broughton.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

SURVEY OF 1850.

Tl1iB, the fird examination l>y the Coast Survey, was undertaken under peculiar difficulties which were successfully overcome. In thi~ survey we :find tlie formation of a new south entrance, but eviikntly of so recent date that tlie bar at the entrance canuot be said to have onr 16 feet upon it, although two very nanow passages on either siue of tlw mid<llc grounrl of the bar give tlnиer fathoms. l'n1ru Point Adams this liar hmr S\V., distant 3Jr, miles, being S.SE. ;J,l miles from Gape Disappoiutmrnt light-house. Inside tl1e entrnnce, within the threefathom curve, th" width of the channf'l was half a mile, increasing to over a milA, and tlie deptl1 of water regularly incre:rning to 14 fathoms off Clatsop spit, lQ mile from Point Adams, on a line to Cape Di~appofot ment.

The extent of the north bar had so much increased that it is difficult to describe, for it had an arell of over two square miles, with from 4 to fiД fathoms upon it, and the bottom varying from lmrd sarn1 to soft mud. 'l'he middle of it by south 31 miles from the higl1est part of the cape. \Vithin the tl1ree-fathom liue the entrance was 1 :! mile wide, and in ordinary weatl1er was marked by a line of breakers on either side. The cours<~ was nearly straight to th,-, inner point of the cape, with tl1e depth of water increasing to 11 fatl10ms abreast of it, where the channel was a little over a third of a mile wide, with the Sulr>lrnr ~pit on the east i>ide. Pa~sing tl1e cape, and turning ea,twan1 and then }:.SE., tlie three-fathom channel was crooke<l, and iu one place only 400 yards wide. 'l'IH' north and Huuth bar" lmre from each otl1er SE. anu KW., distant 3z miles apart, with the seaward face of the middle bank making a diTect line on that course. This bank ha<l chauged its contour, and was very irregular. 1V.S\V. of Sulphur spit a tliree-fathom cl1annrl Jiau nearly cut through the north sancfo. Should a cl1annel open here it woulu doulitlcs:; remain a reliable one. From Cape Di8appointment it bore S\V. ~ \V., I! mile distant. San<ly island bore E. by S. it S., tluec miles from tl1e cape, an<l N"Tи ! N., two miles from Point Adams. The western tail of the great middle bank bore KE. by K. 2- N., a mile from Point Adams. At the time of this survey the channels were buoyed out, but subsequent gales <lisplaccd the buoys. \\Tc note the following changes since the survey of 1800, a little over two years: That the new soutl1 c11annel had been devclope<l, and the bar moved three-quarters of a mile eastward, with half a fathom more water and the entrance wider. 'l'hat the north channel harl contracted to lialf its wirltl1 at the bar, with its northern line upon the line of 1850; the depth of water not quite eo great, but still l1aviug a fathom more than the south bar, the charnuиl not as straight, and the formation <ff a swash channel S,V, of the cape across the north sands. 'J'hat tho Spit bank of 179:.! was being redeveloped. и That. 1he midrllc hauk l1ail increased iu size, au<l Sandy island moved over a quarter of a mile W.N\.V., giving eight fat.homs of water where the beacon of 1850 stood, and the bifurcation of the bank, bare at low water, west of it. Compared with tlie surveys of 1839 and 1841, we find that one part of Sandy irlland has retained the same position, but that a mile, stretching E. by S. ~ S., has been completely cut away, and is now crosserl by the south channel. That the Clatsop spit has changed its shape, trending more to the westward . .And that the werltern tail of the great middle bank, east of Point .Adams, occupies the position of 1839 and 1841: No survey has been made subsequent to that of 1852, but we can state, from personal obsrrvation, that .in October, l 8fi7, the south bar wmi within lcFs than a mile of the beach south of Point Adams, and that the channel ran nearly para11d with, nnd not distant more than three-quarters of a mile from the sl1orc. It и was unavailable with a very heavy sea on, a.~ a vessel hail to 1иun it in tlie trough of the sea, and for sailing with a N,V. wind it was a dead beat. \Ve entered the north channel in May, 1857, aud found it wide and straight. It was reported to have one fathom more water on the bar than the south. Those of the old buoys that remained were of no use, on account of having been carried from their proper stations.

Conclusions.-From all these examinations, aided by plotting the outlines upon the same sheet arn1 to the Eame scale, from corroboratiYe evidence, and from personal oh~crvation, 1n find that the rnutli point of the north sands stretching out from Cape DisRppointm<иnt liaf' remaiiH'd mиaTly the same :;incc 18:39, lH:aring S. Ц IV. from the light house, <li:Jtant 21 miles; has not variecl its pnsition half a mik; lrn:J rn:ver rcadte<l the southern shoal of 1792; and that thtc bar has never liad les:i than fonr fathorn:J upun it, thp1иeLy iadicating that thi~ entrance and channel is the less changraLlc, am] has a fathom more water than the otl1cr, and tbnt, with well-appointed buoys off its entrance, and range; beacon,: on Sandy i:Jlancl aud Chinook l'oiut or Scarborough llill, it will alway~ prove the rnfor and better for the intcre~t<' of tlw country. The pm;ition of the south entrance is continually chanr,ing, and the same cau:ie:; that closed it between 1339 anrl 1841 will again close it. Tlie great micldle bank, str<:tching from Point Ellis ncaTly to Point Adams, remains almost the same since its first <letern1ination. The formation of Sanely is1anc1 prcclnclci' the probability of the channel iиetuming to the capacity whiel1 existed at the period of Broughton's surny in 17~):2.
In 1859 we puLli,;hcd tlie fullowing remarks in relation to riYcr and bay deposit,;, and <'Bpccially those forming Sandy island: "A large clrit't tree, wlwsc roots embrace a mass of 11ard elny or stones snffiФicnt to give the whole mass a slightly grcatt-r Fpecific gravity than water may Yery rcaclily Le C<LlTicd outward by the strong eftiuent current of the Clllumbia, auil l'Sp(1cially in tl1c t:eaf'on of fre><hNf'; hut when thl' currem slacked the root of the tree would rPmain upon tlit'. l1ottum, ~ink into thl' Ranrh, arn1 continue ~tationary wl1iht tl1c remaining movement of the current would be alilc to shift the loose Band aud deposit it mиouud the roots, where it would remain during slack-water.

During the heuyy frcd1ets, late in 1861, immense trees floatcil down the river in a 11early perpendicular position, their roots holding among~i tl1em large tprnntitie~ of earth and stone tom away when t11e bluff banks were unilcrmiued by the rush of the currents.

Astor Point, on the southern side of the river, lies E. !t N., distant 5k miles from Point Adams. It is low at the river bank, but has moderately high wooded land behind it.

The l1ead between Ellis Point and O>lpC Broughton was namecl Chatl1am Ilead in 1839. Gray'.~ bay lies to the KE. of Cape Brougl1trm, and was named, in 1792, in ho1wr of Captuiu Gray. rmn1g's bay liiиs bEиtweииn thE, eastern part of the Clati'OJl 1H'ach (calkd Tan~tи~- Point) and Point George. Into it empty Youug'., rircr, di~coverf'd, cxnmined, and n;imEиrl by Brought.on; LPwi,; and Clark<"s ri\'er, cxaminecl by them in 1805; and one or two rmmll Etreams or slonglio. Bal.:a's bm; lit:~ lietween Cape Disappointment and Chinook J'oint. It rum: 2~ miles to t11e northward of the capL', and recPivc;; the wall-rB of the small streams which hf'ar1 toward Slwalwatcr hay, and connect with them by a 8mall portage. The western and largest stream is the"\\' al-la-khut; the eastern, half-way between tl1e cape and Chinook Point, is the "\Vap-pa-lon-chc. Two or thrPe honS('.8 on tl1c shore of the bay, aud a saw-mill, are all tlntt r!'maiu of t11e settlement onee designated as "I'acific City." The bay was named in honor of Captain Baker, whom llronghtou found anchored here in the schooner Jenny, of l~ristol, when he entered. The Columbia rin~r was calll'd the "Oregon" from the mere mention of tlrnt name by CaI"Ycr in l 7G6. Mucl1 doubt exists as to the origin of the name. In 1775 it was called "Asrnmption Inlet" by Heccta, but afterwards the Rio de San Ilog_ue, from his naming the northern cape San Roq ne; and also the Euscflada de Heccta. In 1789 Meares called it" Deception b.1y." и In 17U:J it was named the "Columbia river" by Gray. Clarke says 1hat, in 1805, the Inclim1s knew it ae the Sl1neati1cum, and another n:1me obtained from another body of tbe natives was Chockalilum; the two being eYidently tbe same worcl diffPrently pronounced; the accent 8honld be on tlu~ penult. \Yhen the name given by Gray was :first changed we cannot state. It vrns, pcrhap~. L1one by YancotJYer or Broughton. Lewii< and Cfa1иkp, in noticing tlw grnwth of trees on the Columbia, mention a fir 1war Ai<toria tliat was 230 feet high, and l~O feet of that hPight witl1out a branch. Jts circumfrrPnce wa1< 27 f,иct. Thi~ same tree is doubtless rcfoncd to in the narratiYe of the united States Exploring Expedition, where the dimen~ions are given as follows: 39~ feet in circumference at eight feet al1ove tlw ground; liai-k, 11 ine11es thick; height of ihc tree 250 feet, and perfectly strnight. Visitors used to Le shown "the big tree" as one of the notable sights of t11c locality. BPlcher says that "the timber of the Columbia, either for sparR or plank, cannot be compared to that of higher latitudes; for topmasts aud topgallant masts it is probably as tough, but heavier. и " и и Probably no part of '\Ve:;tern America can produce timber of t11e dimmsions grown in tLe rrgion~ of the Columbia and the northern co11fines of California. Amongst the drift trees, on the banks of llie c,,Jumbia, we measured one 17 4 fret long by 20 feet in circumference, and many liiO feet by 1 :J to 18. 'l'hefc, of course, were wa~bed from the bank~, and therefore not the largest, which grow imиa1-iably iu the thickest part of t11e wood."-(Vol. ], Jlи 300.) In Bakel"e hay, in 18,51, we nwarnred a drift. trcf' which lrnrl lwen thrmn1 upon the beach. It waR 267 feet long, 27 feet in circumfenиncc with the bark pct:leu off, and wlwnи l1rok<'n at t11e small end 20 inches in diameter. Very freqn<'ntly, when trees are fe1kиd for cutting into lnrnlwr, the first 30 or 40 feet of the trunks are found too large for the SUWиIllili, anU }1ave to be CUt off amJ ]eft OU tJie ground.
GENERAL COURSE OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER.

From the entrance to the mouth of the Cowlitz river the general cour~e of tl1c Columbia is E. by N., and the distance in a straight line 4G miles from the bar, and by the windings of the river about 52 milPs. The Cowlitz runs N.N\V. for 24 miles; thence NE. to its headwaters in the Cascades; it is naYigated l1y cano;,,; aliout 28 miles to the Cowlitz landing. The stream. i~ very rapid, and lioats liave to be poled the greater part of the way; at high stages of the water th<'y are pulled up by lianling upon the buBhes growing upon itg banks. At the Cowlitz lauding travellers take mules <ir horses through to Puget's sound, a trip of 5:2 mile,;. On the west bank of the Cowlitz, five miles aboYe its mouth, are a fow small houses, locally known as the town of Monticello. On the south bank of the Columbia, opposite the (Jowlitz, is another small <;ettlemcnt, called Rainier.

Six miles lower <lown on the \Yillamett<' is the rapidly improYing town of Portland, situated at the head "f ship m1vigntion, with a population of nearly 5,000. The valley of the 'Yillamctte is well settled, contains sernral thriving towns, and is remarkably productive. The river takes its rise on the western slope of t11c Cascade range, about latitude 43r, between t~e snow p<)aks of 21.Iount Jefferson and Mount Laughlin ; then runs westward to within 50 miles of the coast, and nearly in the latitude of Cape Perpetua, turning sharply to the northward, and very slowly leaving the coast. From the mouth of the 'Yillamcttc the general course of the Columbia to Fort "\Yalla-1\ralla is KE. by E. ~ E., 170 miles. }'ive miles above t11e 1\rillamette, on the north side, is the military post of Fort Vancouver, which, with the town of Vancouver, coverg part of the grounds formerly иoccupied by the Hudson Bay Company as a mercantile station, but then designated as Fort Vanc~uver. The Hudson Bay Company still have a trading ~tat.ion here, but tlwir farm:> and grazing lands have been occupied by settlers. The 8ite for a town is one of the most beautiful on the river, and capitally located for increasing trade. ALout 30 miles furt11er np the river we reaeh tlie foot of the Caseades, which arc a series of mpids four miles long, where the river bnrets tlirongh the eastern part of the Cascade range of mountains, whose basaltic walb rise precipitously over 3,000 feet on either oide, presenting a magnifltent sight. Below tl1e rapids the current rushes by with great velocity am] depth, but small steamboats ply regularly from Portland and Vancouver to the foot of the nipids; tbeuce passe11gиers are carrie<l by st11gc's to the head, where one or two fine steamboats conYcy them 50 miles to the Dalles. The Hudson Bay Compnny carried their large tradiug boats up the rapids by a system called eon1tиlling. Steamboats have gone up one or two miles, ancl, in one instance, a brig, with every sail set and a moderate gale astern, was carried safely to the foot of tl1e railroad, whicl1 runs from the 11cad to within a mile and a half of the lower cud. At each extremity of the rapids are rn1all military 1msts.

Half a mile of the cape i~ low, sandy, and <lestitute of trees, but some tolerably high land covered with wood rises immediately liehiud it, bciug the ouly elcvatctl ground between Cape Disappointment and Point GrenYille that approaches the l"h1m,-line. On account of this formation of the point it has been said that the entrance resembles that of Colum1ii;L river. vV e have been unable to detect any resemblance after passing near it several times. The isolated position of Cape Disappointment and the seawar<l face of its bold cliffs without trees form a 11eculiar feature. Thi~, with Scarhllrongh Hill, part1y bare, lying- five or "ix mile~ east of' it, the high mountains inland, and in clear weather the beautiful snow-peak of ~fount St. Helens, have 110 counter1iarts at Cape Slwalwater, am1 ~hould remove all doubt in Tcgard to general resemblance.

Thero hiwing been no survey of Shoal water bay previous to t11e preliminary one of the Coast Snrvcy in 1852, and the completion of it in 1855, it is impossible to state what clrnngcs have taken place. Judging by the changes of the Humboldt, "[" rnpqual1, and Columbia bars, we should conclude that similar effects take place l1ere. In less heavy weatl1er than would causr the Rea to break ou the Columbia river bars, it breaks here with fury quite acroM the entrance. 'l'his description npplies to 1852.

From thence a cour8e KE. by N. for two miles will lead to 18 fathoms, and OYer a mile insicle the line joiniug Leaclbctter Point and Cape Shoal water, the westl'rn trees on Leadbetter Point bearing S. i E., 3J milcH dbtm1t. If thl' tide is low, sanc1 liars anc1 fiats will show on both l1ands, one directly ahead; the broad Jeep clmnnel to the southeast distinctly marked by bare patches on either side, 1md 11 narrow dee11 cliannd to the northwest running into tlie uortli channel. }'rom the last position the western tretиR on J,lo;icllwttcr Point. hear snnth, distant four miles. 'l'he greater liody of water passes through this channel, and the cunent runs very strong. In summer, with a northwester blowing, it is a dead beat after passing the bar, and in some places the channel is less than half a mile wide between the three-fathom lines. Coasters do not enter it except with a southerly wind, and always pick out the cl1annel from aloft. In summer tlHиy have a leading wirnl out, and start on tl1e first of the ebb. The bar at the nortlt charmd has about 3;i fathoms upon it, and bears S,V. by S. ! S., three miles from thP soutl1ern extremity of Cape Sl10alwater. It. iB about a mile in extent within the three-fathom line. ln making the bay from the soutlnvarcl in summer, work to tl1e northward of Cape Sl1oaJwater, t11en run in and follow the 8lwre out~idtи of the breakers in six or seven fatl10ms, gradually approaching them, and dpcreasing tlHи clPpth to 42 aml 4 fathoms, when tlie southPrn side of the elevated ground of the cape bears NE. by N. n- N.

Keep nuder the breakers on the north side in from 5 to 7 fotl10ms, luml bottom, and increase the depth to twelve well inside the point, when its l'outhern extiиemity should bear N\Y. 2 1'1 l., di8tant IQ mile. If it is low water, siind banks will oihow in different directions, and the channels will be tolerably well marked. The present invariable practice of vessels entering is to seek out the cliannel from the mast-head. In calm weather the channelB must be known, or a i1ilot employed, if one is to be found. The north bar bears .l\ W. by N. ~ N ., dhitant five miles. 'l'hl' middle sands lie between t]ie two clrnnuels. 'l'he southern tail is S"\V. l~ mile from Leadbetter Point, rum; N\V. by N. ~ N. for 2t miles, then N.NE. 2! miles, aml E.NE. 12 mile, with an average width of l~ mile. Oue mile ouh;idc of it soundings arc found in 7 fatl10ms. This bay, as its name im1ilics, is so full of shoals that at low tides about one-half of its area is laid bare. Gom1 lint narrow chanrn.:l:,i are found throughout its extent, but no direction can be given for running t11em \Vithout a kuowledgc of thPm, or witl10ut a pilot, follow them only at low water. 'l'he currents then run with great Yelocity, and it is very difficult and frequently impossible to keep a course against them. The arm stretching southward toward Baker's l1ay is 15 miles long from Leadbetter Point, with an average width of not les:; than 3:\ mileR, whilst the upper portion stretches to the NE. fo1и nine miles to the north of the \Vhila-pah river, reckoning from the middle of the line joining Crtpc Shoal water and Leadbetter Point. The principal stream cmptyiug into th~ bay is the 1Vhil-a-pah, at its nortl1east part. At about nine miles from Uape Sl1oalwatt~r it is lrss tlian a quarter of a mile wide, with low swampy banks and steep bluffs on each siJe about a mile and a half apart. The moutl1 of the Palux, or Copalnx, lies five miles NE. i E. from Leadbetter Point. It is half a mile wide at its mouth, contracts very much in two miles, and is bordered by marshes, with numerous sloughs runniug througl1 them. The .-.'\Tdsal enters about eleven miles south from the Palux, and abreast of the middle of J..ong island. It lias over 20 feet water at its mouth, with bluff banks for some dilltance, until it begins to expand, when it is bordered by flats. Several streams 011en from the north side of the bay. One of these, the Nccomanehe, near the "\Vhil-a-pa.h, lm>< ~ix feet in the main channel, and shows 1~ mile wide at l1igh tide.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

GRAY'S HATIDOR.

Ju our description of thiR bny we can ;;tate nothing from pPrsonal experience. It is dmwn np from the reports accompanying the recent sm-veys of lSGO, '61, ancl 'l.i:t, aucl accounts received from persons who have examined it. The entrance to the bay is formed by Point IIanwn on tl1c ~outl1, and thc southern point of Eld island on the nortl1. Thf' northern end of this i8laud i8 connected with the outer part of Point Brown at low water, but at high tide the beaches are one-quarter of a mile apart. The south encl of tlw island liPH N. 59~ 1Y., 1~ mile from Point Haneon; its lengtl1 is 1~ mile, and dirPction :'\. 50" IV., wit.ha hrPadth of two to four hundred yards. Halt~way between Point Hanson and tl1e i~la111l lieH t11e northeast eud of a shoal or middle ground, Lare at low water, and Rtretching S. 15░ 1V. for 1~ mile, with an aver11ge brc>11(lt11 of thrPf'eightlis of a mile. Between the northeast end of this slwal and the sonth cud of Eld island pas,;es the channel, with a width of lees than five-eighths of a mile and a depth of 16 fathoms. \Ve cannot state th<' position of the bar with relation to any of the above pointR. In 1860 the surv<'ying brig Fauntleroy, drawing ten feet of water. laid off the bar sev~ral d1:y~. the heavy breakers along the whole shoal allowing no clue to the bar, and tl1P <lepth of water upon it unknown. At a comparatively smooth time the bar was soun<led with a b(lat иrnd the ves:sel followerl, c1"'""i11g on the last quarter of the ebb with 22 fathoms. In 1861 the euirance waH reportPd tolerably good, and comp:iring favorably with the other bar harl1ors north of San Francisco. In June, 1862, the same ves~el lu1d off th<' bar severnl days, and finding no possibility of crossing, ran into Shoahrntcr bay, aud the 11arty b<'ing 11nal1le to lll'ocun' a pilot that could carry her into Gray's harl>or, had to work from tlie former bay. 'l'henи \H'm only thr<'e days during the season wl1en w01иk could be executed on the har, and tl1P result sl10w<>il tlrnt no welldcfined channel then existed acro~s the bar, wl1it"l1 was Yery UJlfl'('Il, hlm1iy, aud iu one place liacl ouly nine feet u11on it. The cbmmel was not straigl1t, as anticipated, lmt the scawmиd encl curved well to the northwardи 'l'he Coast Survey chart of thc entrance is about to be published. At the time of \Vhidbey's survey, under the orders of Vancouver, a bar existed off the entrance, Laving the following position: From J>oint Hanson, SIV. by\\'. 2 vY., 3~ miles distant, ancl from Point Brown, S1V. by S. S., four miles distant. He does not give the depth of water on tl1e bmи in his chart, lmt in the narrative states it to be three fathom:'<. }'rom t'l1is bar tl1e cliannel was a rn:le wide, and straight to t:1(' , ncrance between the points, was well marked hy tlie breakers, aud had from 4 to 10 fathoms in it until uemly abreast of the points, where it was contracted to half a mile, and the depth increased to 14 fathom!'!. 'l'hen it opened suddenly to both points, with from three to six fathoms between tl1em. The course in, over thP bar and through mid-channel, was NE. ! X., f01и 3:1 miles to between the points, with two low sand islands in range on the course, and 61 miles from the bar. A narrow channel existed on either side of thc~c ishnds towards the Chehnlis; the southern channel having from three to four fathoms, and that on the nortl1 side five or six. 1Vhidbey believed the bar to be shifting, tl1ere being a very apparent difference in the channel ht'twecn the timf'H of his arrival and departure, when it seemed to be wider and shoaler. A dry sand bank which , lay bnre near t11eir anchorage on the first cvrning. on the north side of the channel, was, at his departurn, entirely washed away by the violence of the sea, which had broken inecsMntly upon the shoals and bar. In the incfontation southeast of Point HanRon lay an island with a channel on either side, but that on the west was the better. lfoth led to the mouth of a sm11ll stream comiug in from the east. He also gives a four-fathom channd on the east side of Point Brown peninsula, and surveyed two miles up. In 1841, in the survey by the United States Exploring Expedition, we find no island in the middle of the bay, nor any east of 1,oint HanstJn, but a large one lif mih' long by half a mile wide in the middle of the eutrauce, and eonnect<иd hy a ehoal with Point 13rown, whilst the channel ran between the island and the sontlwrn point. The bar bore SIY. 2l mile;i from Point Brown, and west 2~ miles from Point llanBou, with a depth of about tliree fathoms. This position shows that tlre bar had moved to the N. Ly E. no less than two miles. According to that survey, the course for crossing the bar was to bring Point Hanson to bPar east and nm for it, the channel being straight. From a study of the map of that sunиcy, we are satisfied that the soundings were carried outward to the inner edge of the bar, and not across it, the lines being probably sto11pecl by tlie breake1иs. The foregoing examinations verify our Rtatement fo 1858, that tl1e changes are so g1иeat that the direct.im1R of one season for entning cannot be reliell upou for the next. \Ye lmve been off the har, but never ;iu w a foh cliamиp fo1и entering.

'The Supe1иintcndent of tlH' Coast Survey has recommended to the Ligl1t-hous<' Hoard t11e placin;c: of buoys to mark tl1e channel, and espeeial1y of one on the ~eaward extremity of tlaи ~outh ~ands, w}n,rc thf, water probably breaks during heffvy weather iu winter, rn much as four or fiye milt.:s off shoiиe. This buoy would be of great servic(и to the coasting steamern. In 18GO. wl1ile the surveying vcsoel was lying off tht: bar, a current running to the northward at tl1e rate of 11" ~ile i1er hom was diotinctly noticfиd. An experieuce of two yenrR lrns proved the ~<'t of tlw current along the coast to lw always to the uortl1ward. lmnwdiat<,ly off the lmrbor tl1is current strikes the ehb cuneut of the bay arnl deflects thtc mass of water to t.hc northward, and carriPs tl1c channl'l tl1[1t way \Yith the flood cиnrrcnt the mass of water srts nYcr the Routh sands.

Another circumstance tct1ds to rcncler tliis anchon1ge unsafe: between Point Hanson am1 Eld ioland lies the middle sl1oal, which, being Lare at 101\и water, confines tl1e waters to a narrow rPgular chamwl; but when the tide rises sufficiently to coYcr this shoal the couflictiug currents cause a heaYy oYerfoll, e8pccially on the large tides, strong cnongh to tear a yes~el from lier anchors.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

To the K."N'W. of the line joining Points New ana Brown lies Kortli bay, com1isting of an immense mud flat, bare at low water, and having an area of 22 square miles. At the head of it lies Saddle l1ilL In the stretch of four miles nort11wcst of l'oint Kew arc three small etrenms, callecl tl1c Typw, Uhiuois, and llumtolapy, emptying into N ortb bay. 'They work narrow crooked channels through the mucl flats, but at low water there is not suffident depth to carry a whaleboat through them. By measurement we find tliat more than nine-tenths of Grny'K harbor is hare at low water. I msicle of the entrance tl1e area of the surface of the wate1и, bounded by the fiats, bare at low tide, is only 4,! square miles. 'l'his will give a fair idea -0f the limited extent of the harbor. Through the fiats lying between this, available sparf.' and the Chehali:i run two contracted channclR. 'l'lrn northern commences at a point two mile~ K. 67░ E. from Point Brown, is the only available one, and would require bouyi11g out for its entire length. .For about six milee it is thrPe-cightl1& of a mile wiac, with a depth of four fathoms. '.rl1e south channel commence~ just inside Point Hanson, and is very contracted and shallow. The flats arc so extensive, and the mud so soft in place;;, that it is impossible to reach the shore, except at high tides. This fact has retarded the development of the trade in lurnbe1-, although the shores arc heavily timbered. The trade of the bay amounts to carrying tl1e supplies needed by a few settlers, and by tlrn small mili, tary pot<t on the Chehalis. During seven months in -1860 this reached one lmnrlred and twenty-five tpns. The Chehalis rii,rr has been navigated by a &mall steamboat for 20 miles, to the mouth of the Latsop, which comes from the northward. Thisи is the head of tide-water; but enterprise would render the river navigable much higher. Boats have come from the bend of the Cbelialis, at the mrmth of the S kookumchuck, nf'ar the road 1ms8ing from the Cowlitz river to 1'ugl'l."s sound. The country behind the bay appears low and flat, and well watered by tl1e Clwhalis and tributaries, which drain a section well timbcrecl and dotted with many small prairies and bottom lands. In the winter of 1852-'53 the brig \Villimantic was d1иiven ashore upon Eld island, having mistaken this for Shoalwater bay. After vainly attempting to laund1 her toward the sea she was dragged across tlrn island and launched on tl1e bay side. Then tl1e island was a mere bank of sand, bare at all tides, and covered wit11 Jogs and drift-wood. 'l'he bay was discovered by Gray in J\Iay, 1792, and named Dulfinch harbor, after one of the owners of l1is vessd. He placed it in latitude 4G 0 ;'.i8' north. It was surveyed by Lieutenant \Yhiclhey, in the storeship Drcclalu_s, October, 1792, under the directions ofVanconver. He fir>"t sent in liis boats, and tl1(on cros~cd the bar in .tl1ree fathoms, with the ebb current ruuuing so strong that, although the ship was making nearly five knots an hour, little actual progress was made. Ile applied the present name, Gray's l1arbor, in compliment to its discoverer. On some old maps иwe have found it called \Vhiabey's harbor. He named Point Hanson after the commander of the Dxdalus, and the northern point he called Point Brown, placing it in latitude 4G 0 li9k' north. 'I'l1e Routl1ern point was called Point Chickedes by the United States Exploringи Expedition in 1841, and placed in latitude 46░ 5.51 30 11 ; and the same name was applied to the river. In the first maps of the Coast Survey the southern point is termed Point Hal'rison-a cle1-ical error. Among the few settlers in thi~ nиgion it is called Point Arrnstrm1g. 'l'hc name of the river is derived from the Indian tribe inhabiting the bay and river. They pronounce it Tch1',-lrn:-fo or 'l'~i-h::e-lis, signifying sand. :For January, 185!), the line ef equal magnetic 1;ariation of 21 ░ east crosses the coast line in lntitude 47░ 08', and in latitude 4fi 0 58 1 it crosses the 125░ иof longitude. This line moves annually a mile and a l1alf to the soutl1wanl.
COPALIS RIVER.

We know nothing of this stream except from Sf'tt1ers who have passed it in travelling nlong the shore. l<'rom Point Brown the shorP-line trend~ about N .N\'Tи for ten miles to the mouth of the Oopalis. The barren waste of Point l~rown continues alo11g thiti shore, commencing with a breadth of over one mile, stretching from the ocean to a dense for~st of fir, aml growing narrower as it approaches the Oopalis, whe1иe the timber comes to the watcr'.1< eclge. This stream is about 100 yards wide, but the mouth is. almost clo1<ed by a bar. upon its banks reside t1H' Copalis b"ibe of Indians, from whom the river 1lerive8 its name. eLike all the streams on this coast it abounds in salmon, but tho~e caught here arr celebrated for t11eir richness of flavor.

is similar to those of the Columbia river, but this variety rarely exceeds two feet in length. They weigh from five to ten pounds. In or about October. 1854, there "иas discovered one mile north of the Copalis the whole stern frame of the pro pr lier General \Yurren, w hieh lmll 1een wrecked ou Clat"''P spit, at the mouth of the Columbia river, more than two years previou~ly, liaving thus been carried liy cuncnt~ at lcaft GO miles from its original posltlon. \Vhen the hydrogrnpl1ic survey of the entrance to the Colnmliia wns made by the Coast Surnиy partic8 in 1852 thi:,; wreck was found and its position deterrniued. From Cape Disappointml'nt it bore SE. by E. almost four miles distant, and was consequently littlto mon'. than a'milP from l'oi11t Adams. lt then rested on t11e north eclgC' of the Clatsop s1)it. This shows a direction of the currrnt., corroborating Yaucouver's account when anchored off Destruction i~land, ancl agrPPing with our expr-riPJtt'C.
POINT GllENVILLE.

}'rom tll(' Copalis to this point the shore runs N""-Tи 1 S. about 16 miles, and con1inues low, nearly ~trnig-l1t, anrl bordered hy sa11d beach, which changes to shingle, di~posed in long rows parallel to tl1e coa~t. 'I'htиHe ridges of shingle dam the moutl1s of many small streams and form pondR, abou11cli11gin tront, mul well stockecl with beaver and otter, ;iccording to the aceouuts of the Indians. ThP high land also approaches much nearer" the beach, and forms sandstone cliffo, with rocky ledges projecting into the ocean. Point Grenville is a bluff, rocky promontory, stretching west.ward about a mile, and then southward about a quarter, fonniug a very contracted and exposecl roadstead; with tlie thrce-fatl1om curve exteudiug half a mile from the beach, compelling veescls, excPpt of vrry light draught, to anchor so far out that the point and the rocks off it afford but little protection from the northwest winds. It is useless during the winter rnontl1s. 'l'he point lias high hills lying hehind it, and many rockR immediately off it. 'l'wo of these, about 75 feet high, lie E. by S., 400 yards distant; another lies S\Y. ~ S., half a mile distant. ThiA, we believe, is the one that shows a large perforation through it when viewed from the southeast or northwC'st. It has five and s1x fathoms all around it. Others stretch along thP coast to the northwest, one of them showing from the south as a leg-of-mutton sail. The bluff itself is composed of fine santlstone, is very steep, and may be ascended by a difficult trail, which is used by the Indians. It is said to be a great resort for sea otters, which are hunted by the natives. Its approximate geographical position is:

From Cape Disappointment light it l1cars N\V. by N. 2 N ., distant 62 miles, and from the cape soundings may be had in from l::l to 15 fathoms, three or four miles from the shore. This point is said to be the Punta de :M:artires of Heceta and Bodega, because in latitude 4 7░ 20' seven of the crew of Bodega's Yessel, the Senora. were massacred by the uative8. It received its present name in 1792, from Vancouver, who placed it in latitude 47░ 22', and describes as lying off it "three rocky islets, one of which, like that at Cape Lookout, is perforated." North of Grnnville to Cape Flattery tl1e shore is bold and rocky, with occasional short reaches of sand beach. The timber comes down to t11e water; moderately high Mils approech the coast, through wl1ich empty numerous small streams, whilst the irregular Olympus range looms up far in the interior. In winter these mountains arc co.vcred with snow, v.hich lies in the gorges and valleys nearly the whole Fnn11n!'r. lJfount Olympus is the highest peak of the range. It attains an elevation of 8,138 feet, according to determinations made in 1841 by the United States Exploring Expedition, which placed it in latitude 47░ 45' N., and longitude 122░ 37' It is said to have been first seen by Perez, in 1774, wl10 placecl it in 4.7░ 47' K., and called it La Sierra Santa Rosalia, but the account of his voyage was not published until many ycиmиs after that date, 1180:!.)'

In hi:; sketch it is marked quite close to the shore, in latitude 47░ 15' N. He called it Mount Olympus, the only uamcи lJy which it is now known. In 1792 Vancouver determined its position approximately, and gave the latitude as 47░ 50' N.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Que-ni--ittl rwcr. The mouth of this small Btream is between three and four miles NW. by W. from Point Grenville, and is almost closed by the shingle and gravel thrown up by the surf; there is, however, a contracted opening for the passage of canoes in calm weather. The closing of the entrance has so dammed the river as to form a small lake inside, u1ion tlte banks of which is situated a village of the Queniutls, a race of Indians hostile to all other tribrs. Combined with others to the northward they have ever been notorious for their hostility aucl villllictivcucss to the whites. Several Spanish, English, and Russian vessels and their crews were, in fomwr times, taken and destroyed. Hence we m'=et with the names Destruction Island, Isla de Dolores, Punta de l\Iartires, &c., in this immediate vicinity. The river is said to head in a lake at the foot of the mountains. 'l'he name of thi~ river is usually known by the olcl settlers as Qne-noith, but the Indians are said to pronounce it as if spelled Q1te-ni-i"1tl, accenting the first syllable strongly, and the last so softly that many persons consider they l'all the1melvcs simply Que-uai. A tribe still further north is called the Qite-nait1 -sath. The Mukkaws call it the Quin-aitl. De l\Iofras calls it "Kiniat."-(See remarks, page 377, Destruction island.) These Indians, when trnvelling by canoes along the low sandy beach south of Point Grenville, push иout into tl1e rollerФ, keep between the line of two seas that have broken, anrl pole tlie canoe through the surf. Thi8 peculiar mode iF ratl1cr apt to excite the fears of tho,;e ignorant of what~ canoe can be made to do when skilfully handled. :For four miles above the Qucniutl the coast trends in the same direction, N\V. by W., is composed of sandstone cliffe, an(! bounded by many precipitous rocks, the height and direction of which are generally that of the diff. In the Ooast Survey reconnaissance of 1852, one is placed 2~ miles off shore in latitmle 47░ 27', and the vessel';; track is laid down inside of it. A great many large rocky islets lie close in sl1ore in this vicinity, but northward the coast is nearly clear to Destruction island. It makes a slight curve eastward, and alternates with bold yellow cliffa and low shores.
DESTRUCTION ISLAND.

This iF<land iA the only one found deserving the appellation after leaving the Farallones. It is about 150 feet high, quite flat on the top, covered with gra8s, but destitute of trees, and has high perpendicular sides of the same height as tl1e cliffs on the_ main. It is said that there are some remarkable perforations through a rock near it, but these are, uoubtless, only seen in particular <lirectious, for, in passing close to it, we have never noticed them. On the eastern end wcr-e formerly some rude Indian huts. In Vancouver's time he found two or three dwarf tree~ at either end. In running along the coast, 10 miles off, it is very difficult to make out this island, because, being witl1in mile of the main, it is projected against the coast cliff11 and cannot be di:>tinguished from them until clof'e upon it. It is narrow, but about 1! mile long in a N.N"\-V. direction, running parallel with the coast, aud ha" rnckR for a mile off its southern end. A reef and sand bank is represented as stretching thence W.NW. three miles to broken water, and from there running nearly straight to the northern end. A detailed examination of this locality might prove that good refuge could be had under the island during heavy soutlamst aml southwet>t weather. No winter 11arbor of refuge exists between Point Reyes and Ned-ah bay, unless this be such, in wl1ich case it is of very great importance. Between it and the main the sotmdiugs range from 7 to 12 fathoms, and to the northward from 10 to 14. The approximate geographical position of the north end is:

From Cape Disappointment it bears NW. by N. 84 miles. This island is called hla de Dolores upon old Spanish maps. It received its present name, by which it is only known on the coast, in 1787, from Captain Berkely, who sent a long-boat from King George's sound to explore as far Routh as latitude 4 7c. The crew of a smaller boat entered a sh.allow river and rowed up some distance, where they were attacked and murdered by the Indians. Jn April, 1792, while Vancouver was at anchor in 21 fathoms, 3! miles S.SW. of this island, he "had calms, and found a constant current, without intermission, settiug in the line of the coast to the northward." After passing Cape Orfo1иd he bad been regularly thus affected, and carried to the north 10 to 12' miles per day further than was expected. He give8 the latitude of, tl1e i8land as 470 37' north.

At tlll' f'ntmnce to the Strait of .Juan d<' Jl'uca, l[i miles, by estimation, "\'\'.K\.Y. from Cape Flattery, we have been infonmиd tliat a lmllk Lиxists having 18 fathom:; upon it, and, morPover, that during a calm om; informant fisher] npou it from his -vessel. anJ caught a large number of codfish. His attention was called to it by a number of canoes fiehing. "'Lile we were cncarnperl in KeL'-ah bay, in l8;'i2, the Indians frequently went out upon 8onie bank off the strait to fi~l1 for cod, lmt WI' looked upon their as~PTtions with distrust, and beliend tlHJ- caught the fish imиide of the strait. Each season in passing, as we wi~hcJ incidentally to seek for thiB hank, wP encountered southcai:'t gales, wl1ich rendered the examination impracticable.

STRAIT OF .JUAN DE FUCA.
The entrance to this ~trait from the Pacific lies between Cape Ji'lattery and Cupe Bonilla, on Vancouver island, which forms thrи northern shore. Its width is about 14 miles, and the bearing from Flattery to Bonilla ::\IY. ~ :X. From this line the strait runs cast for 40 miles, with a uniform width of 11 miles. lt gradually contracts to 8 rn'ilel' hetweeu Beachy Head on the 11ortb and Striped Peak on the :South; changes its direetio11 to l:~. hy ::\. ~ X. for 16 mile~; then expands to the northward, attaining a wi1lth of l 8 to 20 miles, and divides into two ship clmnnels, the Canal de Haro nnd llosario strait, learling through the Arcliipelugo de Haro northward to tlie (;u!f of Gcmgia. It i.< terminaterl on the east by \Vhidbey island; at the southea~t it passes into Arlmiralty inltt, aud is boundul on the wuth by the main land of \.Vashington Territory, which forms the eminи oouthc:rn shore of tlw strnit. From the ocean to "\Yhidbcy i~land ~he midehannel distance is 84 mile~. Tlw dq1th of water througиhont tlice strait i~ remarkably great, no bottom beiug found in its ch,Ppest parts with 150 fathoms of line. It is tlie main artery for the waters of ~\rlmfralty inlet, l'ugrt's rnnnrl, l'osscssion sound, Hood'~ canal, Canal de Haro, Rosario strait, Bellingham bay, and the vast Gulf of Georgia, extending between Yancouve1и island and British Columbi11 for 120 miles, with an average width of 20. I ts currents run with an average velocity of not less tlian three miles per hour, and off the Race islarnl and Beachy Head over six mile~ an hour. I !8 shon,,; are bold, aLrupt, and covered with a heavy growth of varied timber and dense unrlcrhrusl1. On the north the mountains rise rapidly from the water, and many attain an elevation of not less than G,000 or 7,000 foet. '.l'hese arc covered with fir to their summits. On the south, for :>0 miles from the entrance, the shore is bounded by hills of 2,000 foct height, backed by the jagged Olympus range of 8,200 feet. :For the next 50 miles the ~l10rc is generally a steep cliff, from 50 to 200 foret l1ig-!1, with a flat country extencling nearly to the foot-bi;ls of Olympus, au<l stretching further south as wc move eastward. On the cast the face of \.\'hidbcy island is YCTY steep; it is about 250 foct hi1d1, and appean Hat, as ilocs the whole country eastward to the sharp-cut outline of the Cascade range, stretching its SL~rrateJ ridge northward, where the snow-peak of .i\Iount Baker"' is distinctly seen, ancl to the 8out1ward, wherP tl1e liiglieor peak of )lount Itaiuier"' attracts the eye. Humboldt calls this l\Iount Uegnicr, depending upon the narrative of J<'rcmont, who saw it in aetive operation, Xovember 13, !Sn. \Ve Lelieve it is over 15,000 feet in height. At the tinw of our first vi,it the southern shore of the strait was inhabited by large numbers of Indians, living in l1cavily stockaderl villages. They were tolernLly expert in the use of fire-arms, of which they seemed to have a good supply. Tluиy lived mo;itly hy fishing, but raised a fair sup11ly of remarkably good potatoes from the stock seed of the Hudson Day Company. l>uring dry snrnmer..i the Imlian~ and settlers set fire to the forests in every direction, and the country soon becomes enveloped in a vast smoke that lasts for two or three months. At such times it is frequently impossible to make out the shore at lrnlf a mile distance. The strong westerly win-ls coming up the strait disperse it for awhile, but only to fan the fires and give them renewed force and activity. In summer the prevailing wiuJ draws into the strait, increasing towards evening, and frequently blowing a ten-knot breeze before midnight; but unless the wind is strong outside little is felt in the strait, and

Vaucouver noted the indentation of the coast here in 1792. It was next called "Scarborough harbor," by the United States Exploring Expedition in 1841. The Indian name is that now adopted, and the only one by which it is known on the coast. In 1852, the :ilfukkawil abont Flattr>ry could muster 300 or 400 warriors, mostly amred with muskets and kniYes. They liad several large stockaded villages and hundreds of canoes. 'Ve have counted over 70 at one time fishing for salmon in the bay. They were brave and fearless; made voyages to Nitinat, Clayoquot, and X ootka sounds, and pursued the whale and black fish successfully. In three months they sold over 7,500 gallons of oil to the traders. They maintain trade with the Indians on the west of Vanи couver, forcing them to dispose of their oil and skins to themselves directly, and not to the traders. By this means they make a large profit as intermediate traders. They estimate their wP.alth by the number of

NEW DUNGENESS BAY.

The shore from Point Angelos grad1rnlly curves to the nort.lieast, and about eight or nine miles from Ediz Hook another long, low, narrow sarnl spit, covenиd with grass, leaves the bluff shore ancl l"tretches in a general ~.XE. direction for 3} mile~, forming the northwestern shore of the roadstead of N cw Dungene~s. On the inиdd(~, on<>. mile from the ea~tern extremity, another narrow sand spit m;1kes 1! mile southward towards the m:tin shore, forming a large inner Bhcml l>:iy, with a narrow opening, through which the water passes, a8 over a ra11id at low tide. Abrea'lt of this point is a small stream, affording au abundance of freRh water but hoats rnu~t nhtain thr;ir supply at low tirle, and come out when t1w tirle has sufficiently risen. The western Hide of thi" ~tream is a bluff 60 feet liigh, and upon it is a large village of the Clallums. The eastern shore of the stream i~ low, swampy, aml covered with trees and bmsh. It forms the southern or main sl10re of the road~tcad, and off it lie extensive mud flats, which are bare at low water for five-eighths of a mile, aud run a" far a" 'Ym;hington, or Budd's harbor. Shoal water exists some distance outside of these flat~. A lwut 20 fathoms am found a quarter of a mile south of the I.ight-house Point, the depth regularly decreasing across the bay, with a soft, terwciouR, muddy Lot.tom.

WASHINGTON,

on

BDDD'S BARBOR.

From New Dnngeness roadstead to the entrance to this harbor the immediate E110re is low, flnt, covcrPd with trees, a11d bordered bv ;in extensive mud flat; but behind it, at a very short distance, rises a level p1ateau. The bluff at the NE. 1rni11t of tl1c harbor is seen from llungeness l'oint. 'l'he entraucc to the lmrho1и is nearly do><Pd hy a low sanr1 spit st1и('(cl1ing acrnss it from the cast, almost to the western part, where a narrow cham1el way exists having two fathoms through it. This cannot be seen from DungeueEs Point, which is G~ miles N \Y., on account of the outward curvin1t of the intermeJiate ~hore. Inside of tl~c l1adrnr WC found 17 fathoms. Its width is a little onr a mile, and regular, its length about three miles, ana the genernl direction SE. by S. One mile outside of the Rand spit a depth of 10 :mJ 12 fathoms exi8t~и deepening: rnpidly to 30 and 35, with a hottom of stiff mud. '.l'his harbor was surveyed first by the L"nitcd States Exploring Expedition, and called Budd's harbor; but there being a sheet of water in I'ugl't'8 sound bearing a similar name, we have adopted Kellctt's appellation. The Indian name of the bay is S'quim, by which it is generally known to the settlers. и Qnimper in 1790 explored the liarbors in this vicinity, as did Galiano anJ Valdes in 1791.
P}tQTJ<;cno.-; ISLAND.

The western extremity of this island lies E. lf S., distant miles from Dungeness light-house, aud externls Iii mile NE. :! E., licing narrow, curved outward to the strait., and having a low point at each end, witl1 shoal water stretcbing from the western. Its sides are very steep, and about 200 fee.t l1igh, the sea.ward part eovcnиd with timber, arnl that toward8 l'ort Di;.;eovery undulating mal covneil with fern. It lies two miks directly off (~W-.) the: entrance to Port Discovc1иy. On th{' inside is found very deep water, but upon the outside a line of kelp, aLout frnlf a mile out, marks the four-fathom curve, and from thi8 a bank runs ou'.j N ..t-nV. for three miles, having from live to fifteen fatlJoruB upon it, with a shoal spot of three and four fathoms two miles from the itland. It affor<lB a good :mchoragc, with light airs and strong adverse currents. The bottom i,; irrq;-ular aud falls off Rnddenly. This shoal has been narned the Dallas bank by the United States Coast Survey. This i;,;ian<l, with Port Angeles aud Kew Dungeucs~, afford the first exam11les of tlw peculiar feature of lo>r, sandy, and gravelly points covcn'd with coarse grass and bushes, making out from the high cliffs, wbcre the tendency of strong currents wonk! Eeem to be to cut them off. It was called Protection island by Yancouver in 1792, and on account of its position in relation to Port Discovery iR Ycry aptly named.

From Dungcness ligl1t the wc~t side of the entrance to Port Discovery, called Challam Point, bears E. by S. ~ S., distant nine miles. From 1\rashington lmrbor the distance is four miles. The intermediate shore is compo~pJ of liig11 ~tt'Pp cliffs. Cape Georg<', the ca,<tern point of tl1e entrance, bears NE. i E.] ~mile from Cliallam I'oint, auJ i<' 11 stcqi bluff, rising directly from the water. The average width of the bay is nearly lit mile for nine mik'o of its lc11gth, and tl1e11 decreases mpidly to the Salmon river. It makes four general courses from tluo Clltrance to thP head, as follow;<: l~ mile south, four miles E. by s. s., 2~ miles s. by E., and 1!]: mile sиw. l 1y S. The ~hores are al1rupt, and covered ~иith wood to tlieir edges, and tbe projecting parts are all terminated by hw pointe stret<:hing out short distances. On the second point~ on the eastern side, were (ISD6) the remains of an extensive stockaded village of the Clallums. Mount Cliathamи lies off the southwestern part of the bay, and rmclws a height of 2,100 feet. "\Vhen well in this bay Protection island so completely shuts up tl1e entrance as to make it appear as a large lake. '1'11e great drawback to this port is the depth of water, which in mid-channel is not less in any place than 2D fathoms, and in some is 40. Under the second low point on the east we could not find less than 25 fathoms a few ship's lengtl1s from the beach, lmt found good anchorage in 20 fathoms, soft bottom, on the western shore, two rniles S.SE. from Challam Point, and abreast of a low swampy beacl1. At the J1cad of the hay it rontracts in widtl1, the иwater ~110als, a large mud flat exists for the last mile, and the shores become l1igher, but in places the liills retreat, and give a scanty space for a few settlers' cabins. For a few years after the settliug of S:m Prancisco many vessels came here for piles and spaiиs; but a saw-mill has been built 11ei:e.

In entning Esquimalt from till' eastward the light should not be steered for until it showR bright, which is the mark for clearing llrotcl1y ledge off Yictoria, and Scrogy rocks off Esquimalt. "\Vhen the light elianges from red to bright it le11ds clear of the Scrogy rocks about 12() yarch.

ARCHIPELAGO DE HARO.
'l'his extensive group of islands was first eeen by Lopez Gonzales de Haro, in 1789; next by QuimpPr, in 1790; and first circumnavigated by Don Francisco Eliza, in 1791. Vancouver, in 1792, passed through the Rosario strait from the south, and gives a good representation of the channel and islands, his boats evidently working among them. Galiano and Valdes, in 1792, about a month later than Vancouve1-. passed through one of the straits from the north, and represented tlic maes of islande as one which tlwy dcsignakd Isla de San Juan. The agents and factors of the Hudson Bay Company, doubtless, knew most of tlie channels and islands subsequently; still, up to 1853, they exhibited only eyc-sketchc:i of the Canal cl<' Haro, north and cast of Sidney island. In 1841 the United States }~xploring Expedition made tlw rcиcolmai,;~ancc of the archipelago, but did not lay down the islauds on the western eidP of the Canal dr Haro. The Rosario strait was surveyed, and called Ringgold's clianncl. :\lost of the i~land~. channel~. pniut", &c., were named after officers and vessels of the navy, and it is said to have been int.ended to call the whole group the Navy archipelago. The Canal de Haro is erroneously eailed the Canal de Arro. The Canal de Haro and Rosario strait were surveyed by the United States Coast Survey in 1853 and 1854, and the archipelago called Washington sound.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
CANAL DE HARO.

The E\ontlH~rn entrance to this strait may be said to lie between Discovery island and the point of Bellevue or San Juan island,* nearly nOl'thwest and seven miles distant. Starting from this line and about t.hree miles from Discovery, a course N,V. by N. for 16 miles will ruu through the first stretch of the strait; thence an aliru1Jt turn i~ n111de towards the eastward, and the w11y out can be readily sC>en between the islands. The uext course is NE. E. for 11 miles; finally, N.N\V. 2z miles, and a run of seven miles on that course will carry a ves8el into the middle of the Gulf of Georgia. Commencing at the starting point, we have Bellevue faland on the eastward, and pass it at the distance of mile. Its mountains rise to 1,070 foet, a111l some of them are only partially covered with wood. 'l'he bluffs arc very precipitous and inaccessible, and the depth of water close to them is as much as 150 fathoms. The greater extent of the strait is to the westward, stretching off into bays and passages among the islands. Cordai-a bayt is the only availaL!e miehmage itLout this entrance. It commences at Gordon Head, {i~ miles N\V. Ly \Y. :;J; \V. from Discovery island; then stretches westward for two miles, anil gradually curves to the JS'.JS',V., with a long high bluff, broken and bright, at Cowic!tin Hcad.t liack of the southwest part of the bay rises a bold rocky-topped hill, (named JJ[ount Douglas,t) which reaches a height of 690 feet. }'resh water is obtainable on the southern shores of the bay. The northern limit of the bay is Darcy island,t N. ! \V. four miles from Gordon Head, and on this course and lif; mile from the head is Zero rocl.:,t a small white rock, showing a few feet above water, with plenty of water around it, but foul bottom and a patch of kelp a few hundred yards N.N\V. of it. A mile and a quarter west of it is a wnken rock. In the bay a depth of not over 20 fathoms is found, decreasing irregularly in advancing, but in the southern portion affording capital holding ground in 10 fathoms. .A mile and a half E.SE. from Gordon Head are patches of kelp and foul bottom. \Vhen miles witLin the entrance the width of the strait decreases to 3:f miles, having Darey island (low and wooded) on the west, with a small islet off its NE. face, and very large fields of kelp stretching far off the southeast point into the Canal. In one of these fields we discovered in 1854 a sharp-pointed rock, which has l1ec11 named Unit rock,(l) lying S. 72░ E. from the SE. point of Darcy island, and distant from it three-quarters of a mile. The small, sharp apex of this iиock rises about three feet above the very lowest tides. In recent charts deep water is placed around it, and when the coast surveying brig Fauntleroy heat tlirough the field the existence of this danger was unknown. Since itB discovery several rock8 coveriug a space of half a mile square, and bearing S. 72░ E. from the SE. point of Darcy island, have been found. They are marked by a field of kelp, and one point uncovers at tl1e lowest tides. Near mid-channel a depth of 155 fathoms is found. The island to the eastward, nearly abreast of Darcy, with a small cove at its southern end, is Tlenry island,(2) having a high, rocky precipitous fron.t, and a swirling current around it. :Further on and to the westward is the southeast end of Sidney island,(3) l:_t mile northward of Darcy, with the Dot rocks between them, but nearer Sidney. This island is not high like those on the other side of the channel, and a lauding i~ easily made at any point. 'l'he channel here, 10 miles from the entrance, is 2l miles wide. To the ea~tward it op1,ns beyond the north end of Henry island, with high mountainous islands bounding the view. 'l'o the westward lie a couple of long, narrow islands a mile from Sidney, and between them and the latter is good anchorage anrl capital fishing ground for halibut; tl1at near the canal is named Halibut island.(1) The moderately low wooded islands, three or four miles ahead, and on the western side of the channel, have not been named. Between them runs the inside channel for steamers to the NahnymoL coal mines. 'l'hc background of the view is occupied by woo<led islands, overlapping each other and appearing like a continuous

through it from the ea,;tward. It is the Boca de Flon of Eliza, 1791, but is now known on1y by the ginn above. Vaucouver called it Dr'ception Pas~ in 1792; Galiano aml Valdez enlled it Boca de Flan, thinking with :Eliza tliat it was the strait of that name seen by Quimper in 1790. It was named Deception Pass by the lT uikd States Exploring Ex1rndition in 1841. ln the middle of the entrance to Hosario strnit Vancover auchored in 37 fathoms, black muddy bottom, in 1792. When at the entrance, and 1~ mile from the western side, a line will pass clear of everything from OI\e end of the strait to the other. This course is N. by Vi'.:! "\V., and the distance 19;.\-rniles to the north entrance'. It passes between Bird and Belle rocks, and almost tangent to Point Lawrence, on Orcas island. 'l'aking tlie course;; through the mid-channel we should have the following: ~"\Y. by N. it N. for ll:i miles; N: by E. ii E. for 31 miles; and NW. W. for 6~ miles-making a total of 211 miles. The shore for the first two miles on the western side is moderately high, declining to a point, a q nartcr of a mile df which lies Kellett's lcdge,(1) bare at the lowest tides, and having deep water all aF0tmd it. 'l'he lcdgl' i~ marked by a masR of kelp. 'l'hence the 8horn makeR a deep bend for a mile to the wt~Rtwan], with a low beach and marsh, over which Lopez baJ;(2) can be seen. This bend is called Slwal bigl;t,(3) aml !urn from G to 10 fathoms for a mile out, with level sandy bottom. In mi<l-channel rise the Bircl Rod.;8,( 4) about 40 foet high, consisting of three small rocky islets very close together, and running in a north direction. They are somewhat pyramidal in form, and cluring the summer show yellowi:ih, on account of the parched gra:;;; and the color of the rocks. Abreast of them, on the western side, is a narrow opcning between two low rocky heads of Lop('z and Deratur islands.( 4) Inside is a line of islets ranging from tlw north head, and making the channel run towards the south. This barrier is called the Lopez Uhaiu,( 1) and the entrance tlie Lop<~z Pass.(l) Several large islands are found inside. Vrmcouver'8 boats evidently were in this bay, as his chart gives a good general idea of it. The anchorage of Shoal bight continues some distance 11ortl1ward of tlds opeuiag, and abreast of some moderately high white bluffB. N.~E. threeи<1narters of a mile from Bird rock8 lieH Belle rork, di,.ectly in mid-c11aunel, making a vt:ry rlangcrmrn 110Rition. It slrnws 4 feet above the very lowest tides, and is covered. by a patch of kPlp, which is, however, generally run under by the strength of the currents. The ri1J upon it can sometimes be seen wlrnn the water ifl smooth, but with light winds and. high tides its existence would n0t be suspected. On all sides of it the water is very deep. The extent of rock above water i:; about 20 feet s<1uare. \\" e di8covered and named thi:; danger in 1854, and while placing a signal upon it noticed tliat the tide rose nearly l~ foot while the current was yet running ebb at the rate of 3 miles an hour. Between it aurl the Bird rocks there is a submarine ridge with plenty of water, but marked by strong eddies. The steamship Itepublic lately ran upon this rock, and more recently the pilot-boat l'otter. After paosing Deception island on tlie east side of the entrance, the face of Fidalgo island jg high, precipitous, and bare for two or tluee miles in a northwest direction. This is called Sarcs Head.* It then swPeps to the uortl1, clrnnging tu the westward until abreast of and two mile!! from Belle rock. In this deep bay, and lying well off shore, are, first, JVilliamson's rocks,"' a cluster of rocky islets about 40 feet high, with deep water close around them. From Deception island they bear N"\V. W. 3 miles distant, and from Southwest i8land off "-atmongh Head, NE. 5 miles. Half a mile northward of them is Allan island,"' which is about three-qna1иters" of a mile in extent, and about 200 feet high, with its southern face partly bare. A quarter of a mile off its S,V, face lies the Denis rock."' 'l'his is never bare, but its position is marked by a patch of kelp. X orth of Allan island, and separated from it by a channel a quarter of a mile wide, is Burrows' s island,и 1 mile long SE. and N"\V. by half a mile in breadth.

James's island consists of' two healls a mile apart, and 250 feet high, but connected by a narro\\' ridge. 'The southern 11ead is the higher, and not very heavily timbered. Close to the weBt of the ridge lies another head, connected with Decatur i8land by a low sand beach. Just, below .Janws's island iR an opening on tl1e wf'st hf'tween Decalnr island and Illakely island,* with 25 fathoms in it, but a rock, covered at a quarter flood, exactly in the middle of the entrance.

Around thill locality extends a large body of kelp. The southern face of Cypress island consists of alternate perpendicular white clifis, and sloping grouncl covered with fom or trees. On its western side, and let mile from the rnntlnvest 1ioint, is found a snug little harbor called Strauиbcrry liay,:j: which is formed by the retreating of the shore-line, anu an outlying rocky islet called Strawberry or IIaut1oy island.* In thi,; bay excdll'nt anchoragL' is fouud in from G to 10 fathorm;, muddy bottom.

These peaks are Yery noticeable from tl1e Strait of Fuca, aml being connected by comparatively low ridges with other hills on the i~land, they iwesent a saddle-like appearance from the southward and westward. Abreast of Strawberry island the channel contracts to a width of 1~ mile, wllC'rc the bold rocky face of Blakely island rises to a height of between 900 and 1,000 feet. The greatest elevation of the northern part of the i8land is 1,044 feet. Nearly half a mile SE. from its east face lies a very small low rock called Black rock,(l) ancl half way between it and the south end of tho island is a uoliite roclи,(l) a quarter of a mile from tbe shore. In this narrow p~rt of the strait tlie depth of' water is about 60 fathoms, ai;d the current goes through with a roar like the sound of a gale of wind through a forest. \Yhen at anchor in 10 fathom~, under the low point 12- mile north of Strawberry island, we found the current four miles per hour, and swiTling so much that the vessel had to be steered to prevent her breaking lH'r ;;;hoer. Thence the ~trait widens northward, and at tho north cud of Blakely, two miles above Strawberry island, two clmnnPls lead to the westward around Obstruction islaud,(2) which lies between Blakely and Orcas islands.

South of this position it shoals gradually for oYer half a mile to 12 feet, with sticky bottom. The approaches to the bay do nut show over 5 fatlwms at a dist:mce of a mile from the shore, and tlie same depth is found on gradually nearing the end of the low point. The southeast shore of the harbor is flat and marshy, and is not separated by much more than a mile from Birch bay. In tl1is harbor the linitcd States and British steamers attached to the Northwestern Boundary Survey were accustomed to anchor ( 1857.) The American commissioner encamped on the bluff about a mile north of the boundary, the site having l1een selected on account of fresh water, but it has an extensive flat in front. Drayton harbor was examiued by the llnited States Exploring Expedition in IS.tl. A map of it was publisl1cd by the United Statrs Coast Survey in 1858. Semi-ali-moo bay.-This extensive bay stretches three or four miles to the westward of Drayton harbor, auJ is bounded on the north by a blnff from .100 to 400 feet high, covcmd with fir. The bottom is very regular, and the Jqith ranges from 10 fathoms soft, about two miles south of the bluffs, to 3 fathoms within lialf a mik of them.

That part of the bank south of tlw rinr is now called Robert,;':; bank, and to that northward is retained the name Sturgeon bank, given to the whole by Yancouvc1и in 17~):2. The current of the river is said to have a velocity from 5 to 8 miles in some part~. Throughout its navigable extent it is very uanow and crooked. Since the discovery of gold in thi~ region a large traffic has arisen, and several steamboats run upon the river. The southern point of the entrance to the river is named Pelly Point; and the northern, Garry Point. 'l'he following official notice in relation to the buoys through the Sturgeon bank is all that we IHIY(' to present.

NANAIMO BAY.

This bay lies on Yanconvcr island beyond the 49th parallel, and we refer to it because sn11plieR of coal (lignite) arc thp1иe obtained by many steamcni. 'l'hc outer entrance to the harbor i8 in latitude 49░ 12' north, longitude 123" 51 1 west, and bears 1V. t N. 33 miles from Point Roberts. From the entrance the mid-channel course runs S. ~ \V. five miles, passing a small island on the northwest at the distance of a mile, and a large island, witl1 falets off its north. point, three-rpunters of a mik on the ea~t. This conrse gradually approaches Douglas i"land- on the wrest, abnea:<t of a wide channel to th<и cast, and is rounded quite close. Tlw mineB will then lie about ,V.S,V. a mile dfataut, with a small iskt in front of them. The bottom is uneven; some sunken rocks occur, and tlw anchorage near the rivers i5 ;;o contracted that ves~el;; mnst moor. Pilot<" will be found hern to take vessds in. The price of the coal per ton is about six dollars, but it is light; occupies one-fifth more :;pace than '\V elsh coal; bnms rapidly with flame and much smoke; disengages a great deal of gas, and produces clinker in abundance. It i.s, however, >'nperior to the coal of Bellingham Lay. The nwal Epelling of this name is Xanaimo, but that best representing the sound is Nah-ny'-moh. Of the western sl10res of the Gulf of Georgia we can say but little. The currents rush past itf' precipitous shores with great velocity, and quite recently the coast surveying brig drifted, with 38 fathoms of chain at her hows, in a calm, for miles along and within 80 yards of the rocks before she brought up. In one or two instanccti preceding this the lead indicated bottom in 10 fathoms, the next cast showing 40 or 50 fathoms.

ARCHIPELAGO DE HARO.
THE TWO STitAITS.

T1w cxpcri<>nc<0 of t.hrne seaRons' surveying in this immedia.te locality has not increased our relish for navigating these channels in sailing ves~els. With plenty of wind no navigation could be better, but in a cnlm vessels will frequently be jammed close to rocks, with only a few fathoms inside of tlieir positions, hut 40 or 50 outRidc, and a swirling current that renders towing with boats utterly impossible. Frequently, too, boatB have been nearly swamped by the tide rips that exist through them. Off East Point, a.s an instance, a five-oared whale-boat eutire1y failed in trying to hold he1и own against the current, which we judged to be ruslting (the ouly term applicabfo) at the rate of seven miles per hour. Throughout the Canal de Haro the roar of the conflicting current8 can be heard for miles, and the main current runs frequently six miles per hour. No nnchorages exist in this channel, except at Cordowa bay, but it is free of known hidden dangers, except Unit roclc, and the continuation of the reef off Darcy island. It is 10 miles longer than the ltosario strait, ancl makes a right angle in its course, hut is a mile wider, and ha8 much deeper water. Rosario strait is less curved, has several anchorages and known dangerous rocks, and a current of about 1~ mile less per hour. For steamers, either cliannel, or even some of the narrow intermediate channels, may be used; but for a sailiug vessel the Rociario passage is preferable, although the total distance from the middle of the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the middle of the Gulf of Georgia is five miles longer. The winds are apt to fail in both channels, and duriug summer frequent calms prevail.

ADMIRALTY INLET.

the grad nal wearing action of tl1e water, and their tops covered with trees and t11ick undergrowtlt to their very e<lges. There is so much sameness in the sl1ores that it require~ some acquaintance with the different points to recognize them liy their trifling peculiarities. The depth of water in the channels is remarkably great, perhaps averagingи 100 fathoms, and it is sometimes dit!icult to :find anchorage i;ufficiently far from the shore to afford room for getting under way. Many superior harbors are found in every direction, and small settlements arc gradually springing up in favorable localities. Admiralty inlet, Hood's cairn!, and Puget's sc>Und, have an aggregate shore-line of not less than 803 miles, yet the number of dangers known to exist in them is remarkably few. One of the inlets or arms of Puget's sound reaches within two miles of the hrad of Hood's canal, and Letwcen them lies a large lake. The southern waters of this sound are also within 65 miles, in a direct line, of the Columbia river, at the mouth of the Cowlitz, which is 52 miles from Cape Disappointment; and witliin 20 miles of tlw upper waters of the Chehalis river, wl1ich runs into Grny's bay. At present the route travelled from the Columbia is by canoes, for 28 miles, up the Cowlitz to the settlement at "Cowlitz Landing," (or by horse over a SOIT,lewhat bad path,) and then by horses or mules to Olympia, 52 miles, over a tolerably level country, and lиy a road moderately good in sumuwr but bad in winter. The distance can be made in one day with a good horse. From where the road strikes the Chehalis the river is said to be navigable for large Loats to Gray's harbor. 1Ve judged the stream to be about 100 yards wide. It had apparently plenty of water and a slow current. The Cowlitz has a rapid current, and. at a low ~tage of the water canoes arP poled up its channel; during freshets they are dragged up, the crews clinging to the brancl1cs of the trees upon its banks. Two days of labor are then required for the trip, but in summer it is mad.e in one. The importance of these close relationR of the waters of the Columbia river, Puget's sound, Admiralty inlet, Gray'11 harbor, and Shoalwater bay, in view of the prosperity of the two Territories, must be manifest without entering into details of the feasibility of their connection by railroadR and canals. The i11let was discovered by Quimper, in 1790, and called the Canal de Caamano. It waR first explored and ma.11и kno1rn, in 1792, by Yancouvcr, who applied the present name to it. A reconnaissance sketcl1 of Admiralty inld was 1ml1lished by the Coast Survey in 18li4. 1Ye shall not att.tиmpt to give in full and explicit detail all the peculiarities of this vast area of waters, hut, following tl1e mid-clianud courses, "иill only note generally the objects as they come under the ey<' ofи the navigator. 'I'he entrance to the illlet lie11 Letween Point Partridge, on Whidbey island, and Point 'Vilson, on the main, at the ('ntrance to Port Townshend. The bearing of the latter point from the former is SE. by S. 2 S., 4:! mile8; aud the blt1ff head lying two or three miles to the east of this line, and destitute of trees and marked by a light-house is Admiralty head, around which the ebb current, and an ebb eddy on the flood, s weepH with force. The first course inside of the entrance of the inlet is E.SE. 6:! miles, passing Port. 'l'ownshend on the rnuth, Admiralty head on the north, and changing the course abreast of Marrowstone Point on the W.S'\Y. Point Partridge is the western point of Whidbcy island, ancl directly faces the Strait uf Juan de Fnca.

Thi8 harbor i:o favor11bly situated at the termination of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, at the outlet of the waters of Admiralty inlet, Puget's sound, &c., and in proximity to the great inland wate1иs of BritH1 Columbia. The entrance lies between Point 'V-ilrnn" and l\farro\\'Stone Point," tlie latter bearing E.SE. 3; miles from the former. lJpon this line, and l'Yen outsi<l(и of it. lies a bank extending two-third<' of the distance from l\farrowstone, and having from 6 to 1Бi fathom~. with hard, sandy bottom. Inside of l'oint Wilson, which is composed of low, sandy hillocks, as heretofore described, lies auother low point called Point Hndrnn,t distant 1~ mile, SE. by 8. ~ S. Starting from the entrance line, about 1~ mile from }larrowstone, the mid-channel course of the bay if' S.S\V., three miles, with an average width of two; thence SE. 1f S. for 3:1 miles, with an average widtl1 of li. The depth of water througl1out is very regular, and ranges from 8 to 1Бi fathoms, with soft, muddy bottom inside of l'oint Hudson. Vessels coming from the strait steer for Point Hud;;on, as ~oon a~ it iR opened by Point 'Yilt'on, passing the latter close, as 20 fathom~ are found 100 or 200 yards off it. Upon approaching Point Hudson, and when within half a mile of it, gradually keep away about a quarter of 1t mile in from 5 to 10 fathoms, and, as it opens, run quite close, with the summer wind off shore, to save making a tack; keC'p along half a mifo to the town situated under the Prairie bluff, and anchor anywhere off the end of the wharf, in 10 to 12 fathoms, about a quarter of a mile from shore. In winter anchor further out, to clear Point Hudson in getting under way with a southeaster. 'Vl'hen coming down the inlet, bound into the bay, with the current cl1h, pass ~Iarrowstonc nearly tlm~e quarters of a mile before heading in for the town, and so avoid a very strnng eddy which comes out of tl1c bay along the bluff shore west of this point. If the wind be light and the current strong, pas~ the point quite close by; run along the outside of the rip, and try to get upon the bank as soon ae practicable. In summer vessels frequently drift about the entrance for days, without a breadth of wind, and in vPry strong currents. Tides.-The corrected establislunent or mean interval bctwren the time of the moon's transit and thr time of liigh water is IIIh. XLIXm. The mean rise and fall of tides is 4.6 feet, of spring tid.-s 5.5 feet, and of neap tides 4.0 feet. Tbe mmn duration of the flood i~ 6h. 34m., and of the ebb 5h. 52m..

The town of Port Townshend haR increased very much since the discovery of gold on l<'raser river. Xo fresh water is to be had, but vessels can obtain a small supply near the military post. Some fine farms, lie near the town, and vegetables are 1ilenty at reasonable prices. 'l'he place was noted for the rough character of its "beach combers." A military post has been established on the bluff, 22 miles S. by ""\Y. from the town, and on a site which commands one of the most beautiful Yiews in these waters, having the bluff and varied shores of the bay on either hancl ; Admiralty Head, 6 miles distant, in the middle ground; several distant, wooded ridges, awl in the back ground the snow-coveretl, double summit of Mount Baker, 10,900 foet iu height, with the mouth of tlic crater clistinctly visible between the peaks, and at times emitting vast volumes of smoke. The elevation of the line of perpetual snow upon this mountain is 3,145 feet. Humboldt is wrong in his description. On the enst side of the Lay, abreast of thf' town, lie;; a long sancl spit, nearly closing the north entrance to Kilisut harbor, which runs parallel to the inlet, and iB separated by an island a mile wide and G miles long. At high tide this harbor communicates, by a crooked boat chanuel, with Oak cove, at the south end. At tlie Lead of Port 'I'ownshend is a narrow cliannel opening into a large flat, bounded by a low, sandy bPneh, SPparating it from Oak cove. The Indians frequently use this as a portage. 'l'he shores arc genPrally bluffи, abl)nt 120 feet high, and covered with wood, except behind the town. Bet.ween the town and Fo1иt Townshend are two low pieces of grass and sand beach, backed by marsh and _ponds. Tl1e 5-fathom curve extends hut a few hundred yards from any part of the shores. A small patch of kelp lies off the southern point of Prairie Bluff, and another off the north face of Marrowstone Bluff. Port Townshend was surveyed and :first made known in 1792, by Vancouver, who gave it the present name, by which it is always known. A chart of it was published by the Coast Survey in 1858. In 1855-'56 a law was passed appropriating a sum for building a light-house upon "Red Bluff," but the recommendations of seafaring men had fixed generally upon Point \Vilson as the most suitable location. Red Bluff, or Admiralty Head, has the advantage of being seen further up the inlet, but is shut out from l-imitli's hland light, while Point Wilson commands both it and Dungeness light. Around Point WilHon ull the naYigation and commerce of the inlet and sound turn, and from it vesHels take their departure when going out in foggy or smoky weather. A vessel entering Port Towm;hend at night could easily know lier po~ition with the light on l'oint "\Vilson, and could enter it witl1 certainty. Coming out of the inlrt and liound into the bay she would have a good course to run by, when the light was opened by l\farrowstone ]'oint. lllarrowst1me Point is a low sandy point stretching 300 yards eastward from the base of the bluff, and forming an indentation on its southern face, where anchorage may be had in 12 fathoms, with a current or e<1dy invariably running ebb. Small craft coming out of the inlet with a head wind can easily take advantage of this for 2 or 3 miles above the point. It received its present иname from Vancouver in 1792.
ADMIRALTY HE.!.D,

Abreast of the entrance to Port Townsheutl, is a perpendicular cliff 80 feet high, falling on the eastem side to a low, pebbly ehorc, which runs 2 miles to the E.NE. and 8trikes the higl1 cliffil on the eastern side of the inlet. Behind this beach is a large fogoon, and off it is .Admiralty bay, with hard, sandy bottom, in irregular ridges, and a depth of 15 to 25 fathoms of water. A strong current always makes out of the bayи and it is exposed to the full sweep of southeasters. 'l'he current is so strong that a vessel rides to it, aud eonRPqnently lies in the trough of t.he sea.

Vancouver makes mention of tlw Ehoal, aml states that heating into tl1e inlet he stood on the bank until he got 5 fathoms, but want of time pnиcludcd his examining it. On th(' ;1restn11 side of the last midиcha.nnel course we passed Fowlweathcr bluff, wliich is perpendicular on it8 N.~vV. face, aud about 225 foet high, with heavy :firs upon its summit.

The low ~oint 4 miles cast of it is Point ~\~o Point,Д making well out, and destitute of trees or bushes. Between it and Foulweather is a derp bight, and il1e distance across tl1e neck to Hoocl's Canal is only a quarter of a mile in one part, marked by the track of a recent tornado that has twisted off and uprooted fhs of 3 and 4 feet diameter. On the south side of Point No Point i~ goorl anchorage in 10 fathoms; and thence the western shore runs nearly straight SE. hy S. for ten miles. At the enrl of' the last comse, whi~h carried us 3 miles beyond Point No Point, the inlet expands to a width of 7 miles. A course E.KE. for 3~ miles carril's us to the entrance of Possession sound, the first 6 mil(~B of which run X. g \V., with a wi<lth of 2 milcB ancl bluff shores.

'I'he next, or fourtl1, mid-ebanmиI course up the inlet is S.SE. for 21 miles to Allen's bank, which lies a mile off the north end of Vashon's itilnnd. .FiYc miles on this courBc, or seven from Point No Point, hrings us to an excellent little harbor on tl1e westem si<le of the inlet, called Apple Tree core.и having a low point on the north eide, with a soft mucl flat extemling several hundred yards up the inlet. From 5 to 12 fathoms water and 8ticky bottom are found off it and in the cove. There is no fresh water in the vicinity, but very good timber may be procured rnitable for boa.t spars and booms. On tlw eastern sliore of the inlet, abreast of thi,; cove, are two low points, a mile apart, making out from the bluff. The indentation between them forms a good though emall anchornge; and the chances are good for fresh water at high tide. The southern point is named Poi1tt TVclls, * the northern Point Edmund.и 'l'he inlet is here only 3 miles wide, and continues so to Point J<jferson, * two miles soutl1ward of Apple Tree cove.

Through the centre of the bay the dPpth ranges from 88 to 40 fathoms. On the north side of Battery Point a Yessd anchoring in 20 fathoms cannot have a grr,ater scope of chain than 35 fathom:; without being too close to the shore. "\Vhen we a11cl10rerl there in 13 fathoms and \'eercd to 25 fathom8 uf cliain tl1e vessel's stem was in 2~ fathoms. The beach is smooth anil very regular, Leing composed of sand and gravel. On this side of Batteq Point is the deserted town of Alki, (the Indian phrase fur" Ly and by.") The town has had several names, but there is notl1ing about it to command trade. The bluff head within the bay, 2 miles K.NE. of Battery Point, is Duwamish Hcad.:j: It i" steep, about 150 feet high, covered with timber, and the beach at lo"' wakr stretches out over a quarter of a mile 1\.:\""\V. from it. The head of thP bay receive~ tln~ Dnwamish rivPr, and for one or two miles i~ an extensiYc flat, bare at low water. The town of Seattle is on a small point at the NE. part of the bay, a little over 5 mile~ in~ide of '.Vest Point. It consists of a few houses and stores, a church, and a small saw -mill; and a number of university buildings are to be erected, ( 1S62.) It has but little trade. Seattle has been proposed as the terminus of the northern trans-contim'ntal rnilrnad, penetrating th<: Uascade mountains by the Yakima Pass, and thereby making the line l 40 mile~ shortC'r than by the Columbia RiYer Pass, which is remarkably favorable, whilst the former is only possibly pmcticable. The usual anchorage is directly off the wharf in 10 to 15 fathoms water, with the large white house on the extreme point bearing about E. or E. by S. and at a distance from the beach about 500 yards. This position will enable a vessel to work out well by making th<' first tack to the s.,uthward towards the fiat. If it. be high water this fiat cannot be distinguished, and the lead must be kept goiug. When a depth of 1 <'i fathoms is struck go about, for it shoals to 3 fatlwms very suddenly, and keeping on wo11ld soon bring up a vessel on the flat. If the current be ebb, vessels bonnd out should stand well into the inlet; and if bound up. work close under and around Duwamish llead to Battery Point. If the current br flood, ves~els bound out should work under the north shore, and close to West Point; if bound up, work under the north shore about 31 miles to Maguolia bluff, beyond a low marshy indentation iu the shore, or until they can fetch well ckiu of :Battery Point.

RESTORATION POINT.

From the SE. point of Pmt :\Iadison to this point the shore is bluff and somewhat irregular, and is indented first by Eagle ltarbor,"' lmving a long pebbly spit making out 300 or 400 yards SE. from its north point; aud next, at Point Restoration, by Blakely lwrbor,* having off its entraucc a large rock, 15 feet higl1, with deep ~Yater all round it. The rock bears nearly K.N\V. three-quarters of a mile from the point, and the bottom between is irregular, the depth ranging from 20 to 40 fathoms. Blakely harbor is only a quarter of a mile wide and three-quarters long, with 18 fathoms sticky bottom at its mouth, and shoaliug gradually im;ide, but most on the south side. .A liydrographic sketch of the harbor will be found in the Coast Survey Report for 1856. Eagle harbor is larger and more commodious than Blakely. We discovered the shoal off its north poiut in 1856. Rc>toration Point is in some respects very peculiar; no other in these waters, except Battery Point, presenting the sami' formation. For 300 yarrls it iH flat, about 10 feet above high water, and lrns a foot depth of soil coyered with grass over a limcstoue rock, u11hcavcd nearly on edge, the direction of the strata pointing toward Battery or a little sontl1 of it. Inshore it rises up sharply a1Jont 100 feet, its sides covered with grass and the summit with fir trees. Around the wlrnle SID. fa.ce of the point these peculiarities exist. On the upper levels of the high land auji1ccnt our party found small lakes of water. From the extremity of the point a ledge, bare at low tides, makes out 300 yards, but the depth is 6 fathoms 100 yanfa off its extremity, and lG fathoms at a quarter of a mile. On the tail of this ledge the United States sloop-of-war Decatur struck in 18ii5. S.SE. of the point anchorage may be had in li> fathoms, sticky bottom, a quarter of a mile distant; or, as a rule for finding anchorage, bring the rock north of it to range just over and inside of the point.

From this place his boats explored all the waters adjacent. South of Restoration the inlet opens to the westward for a couple of miles into a bay, in which is situated an island about three-quarters of a mile in extent, ca1led Blake island.* From the northwest part of the bay leads a narrow crooked pass 3 miles long to the southern part of Port Orchard, which spreads out into several arms. '!'lie pass is olmtructed by rocks and is difficult of navigation. The winds are variable, light, and unce1:tain at its narrowest part, where it makes a 8harp turn, and is only a couple of hundred yards wide, with a rushing swirling current. The channel generally used, although narrower than the one just mentioned, is that leading into Port Madison.

STElLACOO:U.

On the eastern shore of Puget's sound, nine miles south of Point Defiance, is situated the tow11 or village of Steilacoom, upon a rising bluff. It consists of only a few lwuses. }'ort Steilacoom stand& about a mile iuland, upon a piece of granlly pmirie, and roads lead from it to the town and the creek. The neighboring counhT is only mouerately well adapted to agriculture except along the bottoms of the small streams. The usual anchorage is off tlrn small wharf, in 15 fathoms, hard bottom, and about 400 or .500 ya.rds from the shore. An i~land lying 2f miles dhitant to the west of that position is called McNeil, and between it and Fox island, to the northward, there is a passage a mile and a half wiilc. 'l'he passage on the south side of UeKeil island, between it and Anderson faland, is generally known as IY.1lch's passage. It bears about S,V. by \'{. from tbe anchorage, and is marked by a small wooded islet in it, called Eagle iRland, off which lies rocky bottom, and vessels lrnep closer to the n01th shore. This passage is the di1иect channel to Olympia, instead of following the broad one to the southward of Steilacoom. The north end of the island, showing to the southward, and 11 mile from the anchorage, is Kitson island. One mile north of the anchorage is the mouth of a small stream called the Steilacoom river. In coming to Steilacoom, or bound direct for Olympia, a patch of kelp, with foul bott~ and le.SH than three fathoms of water upon it, must be avoided. It beal's S.SE. one mile from the south end of .Fox island, and NW. by W. l~ mile from Steilacoom wl1arf. The tide-l'ip upon it and abreast of the town is very great; quite sufficient with a little wind to swamp a small boat. The shores of the main and i:ilands are bold, nearly uniform in height, and covered with trees.

To find the times of high and low waters, first compute them for Port 'Townshend, and to the number:" tlmR obtained add 57 minutes. The pronunciation of the name Steilaeoom, a'3 given to us by Indians, is Tchil'-m-cum. On the Admiralty maps of 1847 we find it Chelakoom. A reconnaissance sheet of Steilacoom harbor was published by tl1e Coast Surrey in 1856. Nisqual1y, five miles south of Steilacoom, and on the Fame side of the sound, is, at pwиecnt, a place of no trade or importance. It was one of the early j)Of'ts of the Hudson Bay Company, and i:< ~till oecnpied by them. An extensive mud flat exists off the mouth of the witle, marshy valley, but the depth of water is very great close to it, and the anchorage rnom very much contracte<l. The river Xii'<[Ually empties here, and "~e believe there are two small saw-mills upon it. The name is Indian.

OLYMPIA.

It would be almost useless to attempt to describe the route to Olympia from Steilacoom, as a pilot 01и a map is al>solutcly necessary in making the passage. 'i'he mid-channel eourse is 21 miles in length, and il~ width from half a mile to a mile and a half. Olympia is situated at tbe head of Budd's inlet,* which is six miles long, tlll'ee-qnaTters of a mi!P wiJe, and rnm1 nearly south. The shores are steep and wooded, and the head of the Lay an immense mud flat hPhind which iR the town. It acquires prospective importance by being the capital of tire Tcnitory, but especially on account of its proximity to the Columbia river valley, aml to the headwaters of the Chehalis. Tbere is a Baw-mill at :Newmarket, two miles south on the Tum"иater, and three others in the ,-icinily, Lesille$ one or two grist-mills. A depth of three fathoms can be carried on the west side of Budd's inlet, within one mid a half mi.IP of the wha1f; and one fathom within a mile on the eastern side. Vessels are brought llp to the wharf at the highest tides, and then rest in the mud until ready to leave.

The entrancf' to this arm of .Admiralty inlet lies between Basalt Point and Foulweather bluff, the latter bearing E. ~ S., distant 3~ mileH from the former. Th(' first rni<l-clrnnnel cour,;e is SE. for four miles, pointing directly into Port Gamble, at tlw entrance to which the houses and mill are r1lainl3: visible; and passing a high, iиomH1, woo<le<l peninsula on the west side oft be channd, am1 connected to t11e main by a n::u:-row m'ck oflow sand beach. 'l'hif' is frequently mistaken for :m island, and is called Hood's Head.t Between this head and l'ort Gamble the canal changes its eour~e and runs in n<>arly a straight line S. by W. 40 miles, with an avcиmge width of 1 mile. In latitude 47░. 21' N. it makes an abrupt turn, aml runi:l for 12 or 13 miles about NE.

PORT LUDLOW.

Close to Basalt Point lie ;;omc rocks, with others about half a mile SE., called the Colvos rocks,* among which is one ;:5 feet high, but of small extent. Close in shore, and a.breast of this, is a rock just awash at high tide, but between the two runs a channel with 15 fathoms water, having soft, muddy bottom. 'l'he lirigl1t bluff head ll mile SE. of the Colvos rocks, and about two miles S"W. by \V. from }'oulweathcr bluff, is Tala Poi11Lf Half~way between the Colvos and this point is the usual entrance, over a sand bar having 4,! fathoms. The 3-fathom line stretches half a mile SE. of Colvos. If the wind and currents do not suit for this channel, run inside of tlH: ColvoH, carrying deeii water and eight fathoms, soft., mmltly bottom, anywhere insitle of Talu Point, even past the saw-mill, if necessary. The general direction of the shore from Basalt }Joint to the saw-mill on the low sand point inside, b S. SE. 2,! miles. .Abreast of 'rala the width of tlte 1-y is three-quarters of a mile, but it gradually contracts to less than half a mile at the saw mill, at which vessels load. Inside of the saw-mill point is an excellent anchorage in seven anc1 eight fathoms. About a ~ile from the mill is an ample water-power, with an available head of 80 feet, but it is not used. 'Ye believe the Pacific Mai] Steamship Company were to have established a coal c1cpot here for their Pugf't's sound ~teamships; hut since the breaking out of the Fiиaser river gold excitement other arrangements liavc been made. Of all the small harbors in these waters we do not hesitate to give this the preference, as it iR completely lrtn<l-locked, and protected from gales from every quarter by the high land and high trees a.round it. The first steamboat built in these waters was lmmched here in 1860. :~~ It recciveil its present name from the united States Exploring Expedition in 1841. The first rocks off Basalt lie at the narrow mouth of a small boat harbor, called Mats-mats. The eutrnnrc to it is over a half mile long, about 100 yards wide, and at the sharp turn obstructed by rocks, wliirl1 11.llow a channel of only three feet water. Inside, the depth ranges to two fathoms, and the extent of the harbor is about three-quarters of a mile by a tliird in breadth. A maii of Port Ludlow and l\'fat-rnats was published by the Coast Survey in 1856.
PORT GAMBLE.

Aft<'r pas~i11g l'tmlweathcr blnff keep closer to the eastern shore than to the western, to avoid the strong current pa~~ing rouud the low point which makes out from Hood's Head. Run for the saw-mill, plainly in ::;ight, on the wcstem side of the entrance to the bay, and when within a mile of it approach the eastern bluff within the third of a mile, in about 10 or L5 fathoms, gradually drawing closer in shore, and passing between the outer white and inner black can buoys. .At the lowest tides the white one is in 15 feet, the black in l 2~, and the small spar buoy between them in mid-channel in 17 feet, but it rarely shows above water at any tide . .After passing these buoys the mill herirs almost S.SE. half a mile distant. Steer SE., or half-way between the mill wharf and the cast point, pass to the east of the white spar buoy, which is in 12i feet, and run tluough the entrance, passing the wharf at about one-third of the distance between the points. Do not round up to the eastward, as a shoal m:ikes out almost parallel with the point. It may be here noticed that these buoys were made and placed by the Puget Mill Company, for the benefit of vessels trading to the port.

The cerealia generally grow well, but the climate is too cold for maize. During the winter a great amount of rain falls-as much as 60 inches-and heavy weather prevails principally from the southward. It is never cold enough to form thick, clear, solid ice, which has to lrn brought from Sitka for the San Francisco market.

APPENDIX No. 40.
TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE LA.TE COWNEL WILLIAM R. PALMER, U. S. ARMY.

At a meeting of the assistants and other persons engaged in the Coast Survey, held at the Coast Survey Office, in Washfr1gton, on the 19th of .June, the following resolutions were submitted by A~sistant J. E. Hilgard, and were unanimously adopted: ''Vhen~as we have received with deep regret the intelligence of the death of :Major William R. Palmer, corps of topographical engineers, and brevet colonel U. S. army, whose long association with the work of the Coast Survey had founded among its members respect and lasting esteem: Therefore Resolred, That, in deploring his death as an associate, who had become endeared to us by his most excellent qualities of head and heart, efficient in the execution of every duty, cordial in co-operation, kind in command, we recognize that our grief is deepened by his loss to the country at this time as an able and energetic officer, and a devoted defender of its rights. Resolved, That we will attend the funeral in a body to-morrow at noon, and the usual badge of mourning he worn by us for thirty days. Resolved, '!'hat we offer our sympathy to the bereaved family, and that a copy of the above resolution~ be transmitted to them. Upon the adoption of the resolutions, Professor Bache, Superintendent of the Coast Survey, matle the following remarks, which were listened to with deep emotion by those present: Brevet Lieut. Col. Palmer was born in London, where his parents were temporarily, on the 15th of April, 1809. His home was at Elizabethtown, Kew .Tersey, which had long bf'en thP home of his family. Our intimacy goes so far back that I can hardly remember when I d.id not know him well. It was in fact <L hereditary friendship, foT his mother and minP were from youth onward very intimate friends. 'l'lwugh pursuing very different careers, our lines of life have touched so often that I feel almost as if they had bPeu very near, throughout his too short life. As a child, he was amiable, quick of apprehension, and easy in acquisition. As a hoy, perseverance of purpose developed it~elf, which, notwith~tanding intervals of ill health in early manhood, secured professional attainment and skill, culminating in his career in connexion with the present war, for which he had already received a brevet for gallant and meritoriout'l services. Time only wa8 wanting to secure to him the honors already earned, and to give opportunity for newи ones. The fatigues, excitements, and exposures of the campaign in the malarious region between the York and James rivers were too much for bis physical constitution, and brought on au attack of fover, which terminated in typhoid, and carried him off about noon on the 18th of June. By a merciful Providence his cousin, Mrs. General Ricketts, was led to the White House, near the Pamuuky river, and finding him so ill brcught him home, securing for his last days the nursing of attentive friends, and for his last hours the comforts of'his home and the tender care of a devoted wife. I wiish to say a few word;; of three specially interesting parts of \Villiam Ricketts Palmer's life. As he grew towards youth, he determined to prepare himself for the profession of a civil engineer, and came to West Point to look for the instruction in mathematics, which was much less diffused in our country at that day tban now. It was a somewhat bold adventure thus to come as an outside pupil among the regular recipients of the instruction of that school. It required no little perseverance to overcome obstacles which this position naturally raised up. It required his good temper and tact to make friends of those who held the keys of the cabinet of knowledge, and to induce them to open to him. It required facility of acqni~ition not to make the task too heavy for his volunteer guides through this treasure cabinet. He l'uccePded not only in this, but in making friends for life. Among the most prominent. of these were Robert P. Parrott, now of the West Point foundry, then an instructor in the Military Academy, who is now in his fame, as he was then in preparing for distinction, the dear friend of our deceased comrade. Governeur Kemble, long the able manager of the West Point foundry, with whom Palmer was in constant intercourse at this time, was a friend derived from his mother's family, who early noticed William Palmer's

432

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

capacity, anll pushed his fortunes then and subsequently with consistent and characteristic kimluess allll tenacity of friendship. During the years I rem1Lined at Weat Point as instructor, '\Villiam Palmer was my room-mate, and I had the opportunity to note the faithfulness with which, avoiding all the temptations around, he steaJily kept to the purpose for wl1ich he had sought the academy, winning by his conduct the good opinion of Colonel Thayer (that upright judge of many of our country's youth) and of the professors generally. Mr. Kemble caused Palmer to enter the West Point foundry, and subsequently, when the corps of topographical engineers was organized in 1838, obtained for him a lieutenant's commission in it. Here, under the training of able and experienced officers, he perfected himself in the practical operations of the╗ field, and developed his abilities as a constructing and surveying officer. In 1852 Captain Palmer took charge of a triangulation party on the Coast Survey, working principaily upon rivers of Virginia, to be a few yearn later the scene of such important operations in war. In reconnaissancte he was very ready, and in laying out the work a.nd in its execution very nteat and well-defined in liis purposes. His triangles always closed well, verifying his accuracy of eye and judgment in time and cinmmstances of observation. As a chief of party, he was mild and gentlemanly in enforcing duties, expecting to do most by example in his own person. His work always gave entire satisfaction. In 1856 Captain Palmer took charge of the Coast Survey Office, during the absence of Captain (now General) H. W. Benham in Europe, which he administered so successfully that he was recalled to it in 1858, and retained it until called to tbe more stirring duties of military reconnaissance and the field of war. His administration was eaRy, characte1иized by great tact and by observation of men's character, which enabled him readily to keep up a steady but gentle pressme. As the rebellion developed itself, it was easy to see that Captain Palmer would soon make choice of more stirring duties. He entered the staff, first of G1mera] l\fansfidd and t.hen of General McClellan; made two reconnaissances, at Mathias Point. on the Potomac, and at }'lint's Hill, which showed that the qualities of the topographical engineer of the field were his in a high degree-coolness, determination, judgment, and discretion. As the army of the Potomac crossed the river into Virginia, Major Palmer was nominated by tl1e Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of "'ar, for the brevet of lieutenant colonel, and was at once confirmed by the Senate. As second to General A. A. Humphreys, Major Palmer accompanied the staff of General McClellan to the Peninsula as topographical engineer, and took a full part in the siege of Yorktown. At Williamsburg he was one of the first, if not the first, of our officers under fire, and General Stoneman, of the cavalry, who had applied for his services for his command, speaks in the most. complimentary terms of the services which he rendered in that hardly-contested 1igl1t. Accompanying General }fcClellan in the passage of the Chickahorniny he rendered excellent service, enjoying a full share of the geoeral';i confidence, regard, and affection. The in8idious disease which attacked him early in June was called at first neuralgic headache, but soon proved to be fever of a violent type, and he was brought to his home only to die, to end his consistent career of a gallant officer; of an effective, respected, and beloved member of the corps of topographical engineers; of nReful administration in the Coast Survey, and of its work in the field; of frill and persevering preparation for the profession of the engineer, which he had early selected. So mud1 for the outward c:ireer; but friendship recognizes in him de.eper and higher claims to distinction. As a son, as a brother, and in the family relations generally, William Palmer was permanently kind, generous, and dutiful. To a large family circle his loss is irreparable. He bas preceded to the tomb a mother whose every recollection is of his goodness and care throughout a diversified life. The prayers of many have ascended to the throne of grace for him during his illness. These prayers l1avc failed to kcrp him with us. His life is now with Christ in God.
TRIBUTES TO THE MEMORY OF THE LATE GENERAL STEVENS AND CAPTAIN SMEAD.

At a meeting of the officers and employes of the CoMt Survey Office, held on the 12th of September, to give expression of their sense of the loss sustained by the death of Brigadier General I. I. Stevens, United States volunteers, and Captain John R. Smead, United States army, both of whom had long been connected (the last quite recently) with the Coast Survey, the following addresses, prepared by Professor Bache, who is absent from the city, were read, and the subjoined resolutions pll.l!sed.

THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY.

Mv FRIENDS: How soon we are called upon again to mourn and publicly to expl'ess the feelings which move us. One of our old Msociates, a leader among us, as he was in the armies of his country, has peri~hed upon the field of glory. '.rhe colors of his regiment in his clenched hand, he has died as the brave love to die, as he had expressed liis wish to die. His whole mind was given to the enthusiastic encouragement of his troops at the instant the death shot pierced his temple. How little like are such scenes to those in which we best knew General Stevens in thi~ office, and yet how fully persuaded we all have been that just so he would act under such circnmstauces ! He was not one of those who led by looking on, but by example. As we knew him in the Coast Survey Office, so he was in every position of lifo-so in action in ci,иil life, so in the field. Brought up to an active life upon hia father's farm near Andover, ::\fassachusetts, his bodily framtи had early been hardened, and his spirit had shared in t11e process, so that energy and mental power wenoi developed in a well-knit frame. He was prepared for иwest Point only by the instruction acquired at the common school, and yet was so prepared. that by the exercise of the faculties with which nature had richly endnwed him, aucl which labor had sha11ed, he was proparecl suceessfnll:r to cope with many older, many better instructed, many more accom11lished than 11imse~f, and to wrest in the han1y academic strug,)c the palm of the generous W eet Point strife, the first place in a distingui:<hed class. His frienclshi1ls were many and art!ent, and he was ailmired as well as l<wed. The s11irit of self~relia11ce which he cultivated, and which drcurnstanc~s aided him to cultivate, did not prevent the wann<'st attachments, nor interfere with au intrin~ic modesty which only disappeared when the ardor of an enthusiastic and im1mlsivc character carried him beyond his ordinary self. и He selected the engineer corps of tlw army as affording him the best opportunity of usefulness, laboring by study and practice to prepare himself for any carce1и which might offer in the future. He was distiugni:;hed in the war with Mexico, brcveted captain for meritorious and gallant services at Contreras aud ChuruLmco, and major for Cbepultepec. In 1849 he was selected by the chief engineer, General Totten, to fill an application for an officer iu charge of the Coast Survey Office, and with words of commendation which showetl how well he had served his chief and his country in liis care~r in the engineers. 'l'his place he filled, more than filled, for four years, with a devotion, an energy, a knowledge nJt to be ~urpassed, and wbich left it:; mark upon our organization, our progress, our personnel, upon the execution of what '"'as passing in the present, and what reached into the future. He knew how to read personal character, to stimulate, to encourage, communicating some part of his own hopeful and ardent character to those connected with him. His very fault of thinking too favorably of men was the source of much govd to them, for it often induced them to efforts which otherwise they would not have made. His sense of even-hamled justice was very great; he gave it to all, and expected it in return. His tact in bringing about a sharp and well-defin,,J reonlt, even in a complicated ease, was very remark:.ble, and hi8 drilling of those ernployetl b.r him io precision. which was one manifestation of his quality, was wonderful. Gene1иous and noble in hiti iml'uhes, he left our office with the esteem and regret of all, and with the most enthusiastic expressions of admiratiou of his charac~er, appreciation of his services, and hope for his future success. He left us to cornluct the reconnaiss;mce of the northwestern Pacific raHroad route, to be governor of 'Vashington Territory, and tlie leader of its people in a fierce and savage Indian war, to be its delegate in Congress, a volunteer at the breaking out of the rebelliou, the colonel of a distinguished regiment in the volunteer army of the country, a brigadier general, the hero of the well-fought :field of Chant.illy. 'Ve claim the privilege to mourn him with his associates in the army. with the citizens of the State of' his birth, with those of the State of his adoption, with bis countrymen of the Union, who educated him, and to whom he gave his life. We mourn him as heroes should be mourned. We embalm his memory in our hemtfl, a!' Massachusetts has embalmed his mortal remains. We preserve his spirit in our heart, a~ Hho<le Island has bi:i ashes in her soil. Resolved, 'l'hat, having looked in sorrow on the mortal remains of the law gallant Ilrigndicr General Isaac I. Stevens, we tender our comlolence to his family, under a sense of the depth of their lierrn1Ycmcnt in the loss of one whose memory was dear to us in the associations of the pl<st. Re1ofoeti., That we recognize in the remarks which haYe been reml in our hcflring: tl/I) strength of character and ability by which the deceased general wai1 known_to ue at. an eadiP.r p(>riocl of the 1111nиey, and that we_motrrn his loss to tlm sacred can~e of the natioi1, to which he devoted hi8 energies and his life. 55 c 8

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT OF COAST SUitVEY.

Mv FRIENDS: Let us not part without the tribute of sorrow for another of the heroic dead, the gallant Captain Smead, of the United States army, one of the first volunteers fo1и the defence of Washington during her darkest days. The war found him in charge of one of the divisions of the Coast Survey Office-a charge hi which his duty was most creditably and acceptably performed. The first tap of the drum aroused him, and, placing himself at the head of volunteer citizens of Washington, he soon converted them into wellи orgimized soldiers, and led them into active service. When the first emergency was passed he returned to liis position in the regular army, and was constantly in the field. Ile served with distinction with the :fifth regiment U. S. artillery, and laid down his life for the defence of the capital of the nation in the bloody fight of Saturday, August 30. Resolved, That in the death of the brave Captain Smead, United State~ artillery, we have cause to mourn the loss of a recent associate, whose amiable character and manly bearing had endeared him to us. His devotion to the cause of the country had been followed with admiration, and we now grieve for the untimely death which has closed a career that promised varied usefulness in the public service. Resolved, That we offer our sympathy to the bereaved family, and that a copy of the above resolution be transmitted to them.
