THE BUREAU

1'he Coast and Geodetic Survey, which in the beginning was known ns the Coast Survey, was first organized in 1807 to survey and chart the then existing coastal waters of the United States, in the interest of promoting commerce between the various States and with foreign countries. 'l'he need to obtain precise instruments and the "\Var of ! 812 caused postponement of actual field work until 1816, when sur~eys were begun in the vicinity of New York. Later, the work of the -0ureau was extended to the Pacific and Gulf coasts. In 1871, the Bureau was authorized to provide the States with geogt"aphic positions and bench marks for the control of their topogt"aphic and geologic mapping. Other functions have been added toh the Bureau's activities principally in the fields of aeronautical c arting and seismology, so that today the Coast and Geodetic Survey Performs a wide variety of essential services for the advancement of 1 liarine, aviation, commercial, and i1!dustrial interests of the country. l t surveys the coasts of the United States and its possessions to insure the safe navigation of coastal and intracoastal waters; it determines geographical positions and elevations in the interior of the country to C?ordinate the coastal surveys and provide the framework for mapD1ng and other engineering work; it makes observations of tides and ~Ul'1·ents to furnish datum J?.lanes to engineers and tide and current ~bles to mariners; it compiles and publishes nautical and aeronautical charts to meet the needs of marine and air navigation; it makes observations of the earth's magnetism in all parts of the country to furnish magnetic information essential to the navigator, aviator, land ~Ut·veyor, and others; and it makes seismological observations and ltivestigations to supply data required in designing structures to l'educe the earthquake hazard. n-.The Bureau is primarily a field organization administered from rvashington where the basic field data arc received and processed and ~he results made available to governmental agencies and to the public lti the form of maps, charts, and technical publications. The normal functions of the Bureau play an important part in the Protection of life and property at sea and in the air. Its activities are further aimed to meet the public needs involved in large peacetime f.rojects for the multiple use of waters in onr main river basins and or acceleration of the national mapping program.

During the year we extended hy<lrographic and topo~raphic si~r veys along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts to furnish essent111l data for modernizing our nautical charts so that they may better serve the mariner using the new navigational methods and equipment. In the interior of the country, the basic geodetic network was eJCtended to provide control for the planning and construction phases of large-scale engineering projects. One of the major activities d_uring the past year was the continuation of triangulation and leveling surveys in the Missouri River basin for studies in connection with floo~ control and reclamation projects. The control work is being planne to correlate with the topographic mapping of the country so as V> provide at the earliest possible date the maps that are needed to complete the inventory of our natural resources and to plan and exec_u~ the activities of our Xation. Requests for control surveys from civil agencies have far exceeded the facilities available for this work, and only those projects of the highest priority could he undertaken. In Alaska, coastal surveys and interior control surveys were continued. One survey ship, which means one-fourth of the major survey ships in this area, has been laid up and inactive. Because of thll short working season all available faciliti<'s should be operated to produce a well-balanced program of survc>ys in this vast territory. Alaska is our northernmost outpost. Its growing strategic impoid tance and its potential resources require that full knowledge be had of its vast terrain and surrounding waters. This can only be achieve through comprehensive surveys from which ndequate maps and char.ts can be prepared. This work should not be delayed. Survey work 1? Alaska is at best a slow and difficult process. Much of the w~r~ JS in isolated regions and each party must operate as an exped1t~on· Ice conditions and low temperatures add to the difficulties. It is !l pioneering undertaking which .will entail many hardships and 11 number of yea.rs of patient endeavor. CHART PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

ATERs

The nautical chart is one of the principal products of the Bure~ll'j activities. Designed to facilitate water-borne commerce, the 111wt1{11"1 chart must present a picture of conditions as they exist-a faith ud delineation of the ocean floor; navigational aids and channels located with maximum accuracy; and all dangers, such as rocks, reefs, an shoals, clearly depicted. ts In the early days of the Bureau's history comparatively few cl~ar r were needed to cover the limited areas traversed by the marine ~ Today it is necessary to provide charts that will enable ships to re;c1 all potential sources of a greatly expanded commerce. The per ecd tion and general use of modern navigational instruments have caJle 0 for more detailed information on nautical charts. In addition, tha needs of the yachting and pleasure-craft fraternity, which inch~d~s large cross section of the public, have to be met by extending ex1st1~1 1 charts to facilit?-te small-boat n~vig_ation of riyers and bays. SpeC1 ~. charts are provided for the nav1gat1011 of our mtracoastal waterwaY

The information shown on charts must be kept up to fhte. Changes arc constantly taking place along our coasts <lne to t e forces of nature and the works of man. Ocean waves and curhnts are moving sarn] and mud from one place to another and shifting ~ annels and sand bars. :M111ions of dollars are being spent annually en. harbor imp!·overnents and p~n·t :facilities. Revised editions of t~arts must be If;sued when sufficient changes have occurred to make e existing chart hazardous for use. FrPquently these changes are 80 drastic that reconstruction of a chart is necessary. a 'l'hese unstable :features, together with the continued expansion of '\\rl'eas served by water-borne commerce, make the charting of our waterthays a never-ending procc>ss. A constant alertness is required to i e potential needs of our nwrchant marine, navy, and yachtsmen, to in.sure that the basic instrument of navigation-the nnuticaI charts available and dependable for their use. ·

ll ~autical charts arc compiled from the basic field surveys of the

Oun Amw AYS

fi 'l'he aeronautical chart is a relatively modern requirement. The
l'st chart prepared especially for air navigation was compiled in }921. Federal responsibility for charting our airways was affirmed , the passage of the Air Commerce Aet of 192fi. Because of the basic ~hlnilarity between marine and air charting, the Bureau was assigned ~ task of preparing and publishing aeronautical charts for civil a"1ation . . 1'he sectional aeronautical chart series completed by this Bureau ~n. 1935 constituted the first complete chart coverage of the UnHed "tates on a uni form scale. .Aeronautical charts arc compiled from the basic survey material 0f the BnrPau, supplemented by the best topographic information il'om more than 50 sources. Only that part of the material is selected ?r charting us will be of assistance to the aviator in obtaining a clear lllcture of the terrain over which he is flying. In addition to special Colors for aeronautical information and water areas, gradient tints ~!e used to emphasize elevations. All landing areas, aids to navigalon, and landmarks are indicated for quick identification. When facilities are available, charts are flight-checked, before final l>llblication, by an experienced observer and details on the chart comphared with actual ground features. The flight-check not only insures e incorporation in the chart of latest changes, but it also gives the COtnpilcr the airman's view of what should be emphasized on the chart. Because of the frequent revision of aeronautical charts, the cost to the aviator is kept to a minimum so that :frequent replacements will keep him advised of current information without undue expense. 'f!sers are informed of the current editions of charts by notices pnbllShed at 2-week intervals . . Developments in air navigational techniques and changes in lllformation shown on aeronautical charts require continued revisions alld additions to the information shown on existing charts and the addition of specialized types of charts for use with newly developed

aids and navigation facilities. Navigation of modern, long-r~11 ~ aircraft flying at greater speeds and higher altitudes has requ~re the development of a special type of chart. The installation of h1gll; :frequency ranges throughout the United States will require anothe special type of cha1t that at present is in the experimental stagei Special charts must also be provided to simplify air traffic contr0 problems at congested air terminals.
NAunc,\L CnART Pnoouc'l'ION

Modernization of nautical charts has been necessitated partly to modify them for use with new navigational methods, partly for ~}le sake of economy, and partly to take advantage of new reproductI 011 methods. , During the fiscal year 11)4ll, someJ)rogress was made in the Bureaus program of reconstruction and mo ernization of its charts, hut ther still remains a backlog of revision data which must be applied to t 1e charts. At the end of the year, 907 nautical charts were on issue. This is ~JI increase of IO over the previous year. To produce the 816,759 cop1e5 distributed, 467 printings were necessary, as follows: 12 new charts, 23 new editions, 398 new prints, and 34 reprints. Nearly 8,000,000 hand corrections were necessary to correct the charts to date of issue. Several thousand hand corrections will be eliminated annually in the future by an agreement reached betweell the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Corps of Engineers, and the Coast Guard, whereby the Light List, the Engineers' weekly reports, and the Bureau's nautical charts will ull use the same nomenclature with respect to channels and ranges in the Columbia and "'\Villamette Rivers. Dangers requiring hand corrections were reported_ to the Coast Guard and the Hydrogrnphic Office for publication in the weekly Notice to Mariners. The charting of the Gulf lntracom;tal Waterway, from Carrabellet Fla., to the Mexican border, on a new large-scale series was abn°~ half completed at the end of the year. Four new charts were pu lished during the year, bringing the total published to 15. These fornish detailed coverage of the waterway from Carrabelle, Fla., t~ Houma, La., a distance of about 37!) nautical miles. This, togethel with the fact that all 1,076 miles of the waterway are completelY dredged, has greatly increased the demand for completion of thf remaining 18 charts. The entire waterway, with a designed depth ~ ~2 feet, but an actual depth of 14 feet, and a bot!,om width of 125 feet is mt.ended for use of barge tows and other light-draft vessels no adapted to navigating long stretches of open ocean and gulf waters· 'I'he Corpus Christi-Brownsville section is without obstructions. To supplement the two existing small-scale charts for use with tl~e Loran system of navigation now covering the entire Atlantic coas ' one new Loran general chart of similar type, but on a larger sc~le, was published to meet the needs of the large fishing fleet operatI~g out of Boston and Gloucester. During the latter part of the year, 111 answer to numerous requests, chart compilation was started on up_rl~ ing Loran curves to the existing larger-scale eonst charts. 'fl11S JS

!ii line with the program of extending the Atlantic coast coverage to lllclude in-shore and coastwise navigation . .A. new nautical chart covering the ·wmamette River from Portland ~o 'Valnut Eddy, Oreg., the first of a series of two new charts designed .0 cover the 'Villamette River from Portland to Newberg, was pub1 .18hed during the year. This chart provides large-scale coverage which IS essential to safe navigation of the heavy river traffic and should also be of special use to small-boat owners who navigate the waterway. C.A. new sailing chart covering the Pacific coast from Cape Blanco to ape Flattery was also published during the year. This chart com~letes the series of three designed for offshore navigation along the hacific coast. Many submarine features are shown in detail which 8 ould prove valuable for the determination of position by echo 80 unding. S Another new chart covers the south coast of Alaska, from Cross ound to Yakutat Bay. This chart was designed in response to bequests from the fishing industry for a chart covering the fishing dan~s of this part of the Gulf of Alaska. Other new charts published . Ur1ng the year cover Agattu Island, and Alaid and Nizki Islands, ln the Aleutians; and Winter Harbor and Belfast Harbor in Maine. . ln the field of related nautical chart publications, the Bnreau pub1 t~hes a series of Coast Pilots to supplement the information shown on be charts. Each Pilot is based on intensive field examination. Uting the year, field inspection was completed for revision of the xulf Coast Pilot. Inspection was also begun for revisions of the () tlantic Coast Pilot, sections A and B, and the Hawaiian Islands oast Pilot.
AERONAUTICAL C11AR'l'

P1wnucnox

~t the end of the fiscal year, 905 aeronautical charts were being ~an1tained by the Bureau. These include 265 standard aeronautical ~ larts, 552 instrument approach and landing charts (including 77 ltJ.strument landing system charts), and 88 radio facility charts. The ~ol~owing new charts were compiled and published: 1 local, 88 radio acility, 33 instrument landing system, and 38 instrument approach and landing. btlring the year the schedule for printing the standard aeronautical charts of the United States was revised to effect better coordination With Civil Aeronautics Administration airport inspections. A. new series of radio facility charts of the United States was prePared and published to replace the former series of 45 charts. This P1·ovides coverage on a larger and uniform scale. The continuing increase in navigational radio aids requires the larger scale for increased c arity. The new series also includes six danger area charts, an index 11J1d tabulation o.f "omni" facilities, two nonstandard holding patt~r!' c.larts, one holdmg chart, one coded departure route chart, the crv1l ~lrway and mileage chart, and three additional sheets of miscelliweous llJ.fo1·mation . . 'rhe danger area charts show areas of the United States hazardous to a11· navigation. Danger areas are shown graphically in relation to the airways and each area is numbered to correspond to u tabulation

on the back of the chart which defines the type of hazard characterh~· ing the area, such as "Caution," ''Danger," or ""'\Varning"; activity of of the area, such as bombing and gunnery practice; maximum altitude of hazardous area; and hours of operation. The danger area char~~ are. published and distributed as a part of the radio facility chal series. The installation and commissioning of omni facilities in the Un~ted State~ required the publication of an omni index map and tabul:ttioJl·. Several experimental printings have been issued through the CAA fol operational testing of these facilities. Route chart 2:w1, Chicago ~o Gander, was overprinted with special omni symbols and a new exper~ mental chart, designated OM-1, covering the Chicago to New Yor VOR airway, was irnblished. This was the first chart made avai!abld with complete omni information in conjunction with the assoc1atet~ low-frequency facilities. The development of a new series of cha~ll in cooperation with the CAA is now under way. These charts "'..! contain all information necessary for navigation and air traffic con· trol with omni facilities. In cooperation with the CAA, the Bureau developed two charts t~ simplify air traffic control problems for holding and departure a' major air terminals. A holding chart for LaGuar<lia Airport, :Ne'" York, was distributed by the CAA for experimental use and illustrat~s graphically the holding patterns for this airport. A coded departutd route chart, for LaGuardia and Newark Airports was published a.~, will be utilized by the New York Air Traffic Control Center to simpll.>J clearance phraseology and to indicate routes prescribed for flights d~· parting from LaGuardia and ~ ewark ~irpor~s .. Operational e_x:pet'lf ence with these two charts will materially aid m the production of additional charts of this type planned for next year. Both type~ .0 , charts will be issued automatically to subscribers of radio fac1bt) charts and may be purchased sepa1:ately. . f At the request of the CAA, the Bureau undertook the constrnctwTf0 a planimetric map of Indianapolis, Ind., on a scale of 1: 125,000. . 1 1 map, to be printed in four sections, will be used for testing I1avigat10nad facilities. Two of the sections have been delivered to the CAA all the remaining two will be made available early next year. . The Bureau is developing an instrument approach and landll~~ chart that depicts approved procedures for use with ADF ( automat;y direction finding) stations. These charts should be available ear next year for all fields with approved procedures. .. Due to expanding civil air actiYity, a new series of 14 radio £ac1htY charts of Alaska was published.

SURVEYS OF COASTAL WATERS Coastal surveys, embracing hydrography, topography, and coastlli triangulation, furnish the basic data essential in the production nautical and aeronautical charts. These surveys are accomplishe~ ships and shore-based parties operating along the coasts of the Unite Stutes and possessions, including inland waterways, to procure i~f?~ mation pertaining to shore line, locations of channels, character1stl. of the sea bottom, positions of reefs, shoals, and other dangers to navi· gation, and many other features along the coasts. Approxiinatel! 90,000 statute miles of tidal shore line, fringed by over a million square miles of coastal waters, covering the continental United State~ Alaska, Hawaiin1n Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canal Zone, an. 0 Virgin Islands, are under the jurisdiction of the Coast and Geodetl Survey for coastal surveys. To safeguard our coastal waters for navigation, periodic resurv~ys are made. In many areas these are required because of changes t~k 1 ?, place in shore line and ocean bottom as a result of natural and art1fic1 causes. Other areas, though unchangeable, must be resurveyed to rn° ; ernize older charts which lack the extent of detail which the navig'fay0 presently needs for use with improved navigational devices. . 10' problem of surveying our coastal waters is, therefore, a continulllto one. During the year, surveys were carried on under the normal peaced time program into areas of importance to commercial shipping and undeveloped regions containing oil, fishing, and mining resources, nJl t were also extended into areas of strategic importance at the reque 5 of the armed services. 1 Seventeen ships and :3 shore-based parties were engaged on coa~tnd surveys along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the U111te

' /VI ' were engaged on combined operations. The Sw·veyor remaine b _ Seattle, \Vash., on an inactive status, with reduced complement, e '{ cause of insufficient operating funds. The Bow,ie carried on combined operations in the San Francisco J3ll.I and Carquinez Strait areas. Special hydl'ographic surveys, request~'e by the Department of the Navy, were completed in the vicinity oft}{ Golden Gate and the San Francisco Bay water front from Anita Roe to North Point. cl The Ii od,r;son continued hydrographic surveys in the Columbia all 11 \Yillamette Rivers, Oreg. Field work in the Columbia River betwee Bonneville Dam and The Dalles was completed. e . The Explorer made Shoran-controlled hydrographic surveys in tJ1 .Aleutian Islands, in the vinicity of Kiska and Amchitka Islan ~t Field work in the vicinity of Little Kislrn Island and along the e.ll~ 1 coast of Kiska Island westward of South Pass wus completed durI 11 "' the year. f The Pioneer operated in the .Aleutian Islands, in the vicinitY. 0cr Kiska, Segula, Semisopoclrnoi, and Little Sitkin Islands, coutinu1n" Shoran-controlled hydrographic surveys of the previous year. The Patkfonder performed combined operations in Bristol J3uY' Alaska. 1 The Der·ickson, the former .AGS-G (PCS 1458), continued. coll £ bined operations in .P~ince William Soun~ .Al~ska, in the vicimtY ~e J>assage Canal, \Vlnttrer, and Cordova. Un November 23, l!H8, tto ship was permanently transferred from the United States ~avy the jurisdiction and service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. · ll The Patton was engaged on combined operations in Olga an<l }lie~o Straits, Alaska, between Sitka and Salisbury Sounds, approaches Neva Strait, and St. John Baptist Bay. t· The Lester Jones made hydrographic surveys and gave ship s~PP 0 ' e to the triangulation and photogrammetric parties operating in the northwest portion of Bristol Bay. Late in the season work was doll_ in Prince 'William Sound. Toward the end of the fiscal year, colll bined operations were commenced in Kukak Bay. er The Arctic shore party continued with combined operations al~b~ the Arctic coast of Alaska. These surveys are being made at request of the Department of the Navy. d At the close of the Alaska work, the ships Ewplorer, PioneeJ). a~\ 1 1 Pathfonder ran deep-sea sounding lines in the North Pacific u~e' a from the Aleutian Islands to points on the west coast of the Un 1t:, States, as part of the program of running sounding lines by Sur"ea vessels while en route from their working grounds. One line exten~]le :from the vicinity of Adak to Yaquina Head, Oreg., thence "Jlt Strait of Juan de Fuca; another line was run from Adak to 0 Arena, Calif.; and another from the vicinity of Unimak Pass to

Columbia River Lightship, thence.to Cape Flattery. A new seamount, about a mile high, with a least depth of 460 fathoms, was discovered in latitude 51° N., longitude 143° W. · A shore-based party completed basic hydrographic surveys in Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho, requested by the Department of the Navy. Another shore-based party continued basic hydrographic surveys in Lake Franklin D. Roosevelt, Washington. This is being done at the request of the Bureau of Reclamation for a survey from Coulee Dam upstream to the international boundary. · In the Republic of the Philippines, the Manila office of the Bureau, under the direction of the Director of Coast Surveys of the Philippine Islands, continued survey work and training of Filipinos, and assisted in the organization of the Philippine Bureau of Coast and Geodetic Survey, authorized b,r the Philippine Rehabilitation program. Three commissioned officers and five civilian employees were on duty in the Manila office to assist in field operations, revision of charts, and training. The ship Tulip completed combined operations in the Manila Harbor area and commenced a revision hydrographic survey in Cebu Harbor and approaches. The ship Hornet was commissioned and upon completion of necessary repairs will undertake detached surveys. Funds for carrying on the program, with the exception of the pay of commissioned officers, were transferred from the Department of State. . District offices were maintained during the year at the following ports: Boston; New York; Norfolk; New Orleans; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oreg.; Seattle; and Honolulu. Tliese offices rendered valuable service in supplying information for the correc~ion of charts, in assisting the field parties of the Bureau in obtaining supplies and personnel, in pfanning field work of the parties working in their resi?ective districts, and in disseminating nautical and engineering data m response to requests from public and official sources. Processing offices were continued at the two principal bases of the field parties, Norfolk and Seattle. These offices process field records, plot hydrographic surveys, and perform other work in connection with the survey records. The operation of these field offices expedites the application of field surveys to the finished nautical charts and permits close cooperation between the field engineer and the office cartographer. PHOTOGRAMMETRIC SURVEYS Accurate detailed surveys of the coastline and the land area immediately adjacent thereto are essential to the J?roduction and maintenance of nautical charts; consequently, since its inception, the Bureau has been engaged in mapping the coastline. Today most of this mapping is done by photogrammetric methods involving the use of aerial photographs. The resulting topographic maps add to the topographic map coverage of the United States and its possessions,. and, in addition to providing the information required for nautical charts, they provide data for engineering construction, road building, and other private and public work which requires a comprehensive know}-. edge of the land. The photographs from which the topographic maps are compiled are also extremely useful to Government and private·

agencies for planning in advance of the completion of the maps and for the detailed information contained on the photographs that can· not all be transferred to maps. The use of aerial photo~raphs started in the Bureau in 1922 and has continued on an increasmg scale with great improvements in the quality and efficiency of coastal mapping. The use of photographs does not eliminate the need for ground surveys which provide control and accurate interpretation of photographic detail. Ground surveys account for approximately one-half of the total cost of coastal map· ping. The main work phases in map production from aerial photo· graphs are: Aerial photography, laboratory processing of photo· graphs, supplemental ground surveys and field inspection, office compilation, field edit, office review and drafting, and publication. For the most part, aerial photographs have been taken by Bureau personnel operating in cooperation with the United States Coast Guard, which furnishes the airplane and fiight crew. The areas photographed during the year were: Kennebec River, Maine; parts of New York Harbor; Pamlico Sound and New River, N. C.; Daytona Beach and Jacksonville, Fla. ; Corpus Christi to Brownsville, Tex.; Puget Sound; various small areas on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for chart revisions; and, in Alaska, coastal areas at Anchorage, Prince William Sound, Bristol Bay, Kuskokwim Bay, Norton Sound, Seward Peninsula, the Arctic coast southwest of Point Barrow, and the Aleu· tian Islands. During the year, photogrammetric field surveys were in progress or were completed in the following areas: Eastern Maine; Elizabeth Island, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Island, Mass.; Fishers Island, Conn.; Pamlico Sound, N. C.; east coast of Florida in the vicinitY. of Cape Canaveral; the Louisiana coast in the vicinity of Abbeville; the Texas coast in the vicinity of Corpus Christi; and, in Alaska, in Bristol Bay, Kuskokwim Bay, and Kotzebue Sound. Field work preliminary ·to topographic mapping by stereoscopic instruments was continued by ships of the Bureau in the Aleutian Islands in conjunction with hydrographic surveys, at the specific request of the Department of the Army and by mutual agreement with the Geological Survey. · At the close of the year field inspection preliminary to compilation was being done by photogrammetric personnel attached to triangula· tion parties on the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers and along the north shore of the Seward Peninsula. Data obtained are to be turned over to the Army Map Service for compilation. The establishment of the photogrammetric test area near McClure, Ohio, has provided the means for improving the accuracy and re· liability of nine-lens photographs and for a more accurate and facile calibration of the nine-lens camera and its associated equipment. Many other Government mapping agencies, research organizations, universities, and photogrammetric companies are using this test area for various studies which will lead to improved photogrammetric techniques and results. Photogrammetric offices continued in operation in Baltimore, Md.; Tampa, Fla.; and Portland, Oreg.; compiling toporrraphic and plani· metric maps of coastal areas in eastern Maine; C'onnecticut River; Hempstead Bay; Delaware River; Pamlico Sound; Florida east coast;

Louisiana coast; Humboldt Bay; Coos Bay; Williamette and Colum. bia Rivers; and Bristol Bay, Alaska Peninsula, St. Matthew IslaJ?.d, and the Aleutian Islands. In the Washington office, the compilation, reviewing, and drafting ·of planimetric and topographic maps prior to publication were continued. Major projects mcluded shoreline surveys of the Gulf Intra·coastal Waterway; Pend Oreille Lake, Idaho; Arctic .coast eaRt of Point Barrow; and Sitka Sound; stereoscopic mapping on the Delaware River; Tidewater, Va.; Alaska Peninsula; Nushagak Peninsula; .and in the Aleutian Islands; and the preparation of reconnaissance mosaics on the Alaska Peninsula and the Arctic coast. Seven airport survey parties operated throughout the United States during the fiscal year and completed surveys at 137 airports. These surveys are used in the production and maintenance of aeronautical in:strument approach and landing charts and airport obstruction plans. One hundred and three airport obstruction plans were published during the year, bringing the total published to date to 301. This is Part of a proaram for obstruction plans for some 550 airports requested by the Civil Aeronautics Administration. The plans are used by that .agency in administering regulations regarding the allowable pay load of various types of aircraft. Demands from the general public and other Federal agencies for ·copies of aerial photographs continue to maintain a large work load and strain on facilities of the air photographic laboratory. At times official requests have been so heavy that outside orders hav~ been -quoted on a 1- to 2-month delivery basis. A second transforming printer for the nine-lens films is now under construction and is expected to relieve this condition. A summary of the photo~rammetric mapping of coastal areas for the .fiscal year 1949 is given m the following tabulation:

GEODETIC CONTROL SURVEYS Geodetic control surveys consist of the determination of precise latitude, longitude, and azimuth for marked points and prominent natural and artificial objects, and the determination of the elevations above sea level for bench marks. Geodetic control surveys are related to the ellipsoidal figure of the earth and are the most accurate type of land surveys made. All points in the geodetic network of horizontal control are referred to the same hor1zonta1 datum-the North American 1927 datum-and are therefore correctly related in position with respect to each other, no matter how far apart they may be. The precise leveling is referred to the datum of mean sea level and all elevations of bench marks determined on these surveys arc correctly related in elevation to each other. Geodetic control surveys are necessary for the mapping an<l charting programs of the United States. They are used extensively in the planning and construction phases of large-scale engineering projects such as_ those for flood control, irrigation, navigation, water supply, and drainage; and for highways, railroads, tunnels, canals, airports, and similar projects. During the war there was a military requirement for these surveys and, supported by transfer of funds, the work was accelerated. Since the war, the military demand was replaced by the requirements of civil agencies. Requests for control surveys have far exceeded the allotment made available for this work, and only those projects of the highest priority can be accomplished. This often results in a postponement of the work in important areas, with subsequent uneconomical effect on the :program of other agencies. One of the major activities during the past year was the continuation of triangulation and leveling surveys in the Missouri River Basin for studies in connection with flood control and reclamation projects. Four triangulation parties, two reconnaissance parties, and three leveling umts operated in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, ::Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. Along the Missouri River, S)?ecific appurtenances of the Corps of Engineers pertaining to remedial measures for flood control were located. Retrogression ranges on the banks of the river were located and referred to the national network of control. In the immediate vicinity of the dam sites, detailed control was established to provide data for the construction surveys. Control surveys were carried on in vVyoming, Colorado, western :.\rizona, and southern California for the Bureau of Reclamation; and in Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Texas, Mississippi, northern California, Oregon, and 'Vashington for the mapping program of the United States Geological Survey. An astronomic party operated in various parts of the country for the determination of latitude, longitude, and azimuth in connection With the aQ.justment of the basic control network. , The variation of latitude observatories at Ukinh, Calif., and Gaithersburg, Md., continued in uninterrupted operation throughout the year. The data from these observatories are sent to the central office in Italy for computation and comparison with similar observa~ions from observatones established on the same parallel of latitude ln .Japan, Italy, and the U.S. S. R.

A major project during the year was the continuation of geodetic surveys in western Alaska. Four parties, of 30 men each, are oper!l.ting along the Bering Sea coast from Port Heiden, Alaska Peninsula, to the north shore of the Seward Peninsula. These parties are working in isolated regions and must operate as an expedition. One of the difficult problems encountered is to ensure that necessary supplies and replacements are on hand when needed. Transportation for tnese parties is being furnished by wheel and float planes, helicopters, weasels, and small boats. The expenses of three of these parties are being financed from funds transferred to the Bureau by the National Military Establishment. Triangulation work was continued on the Island of Hawaii for the determination of geographic positions. The territorial surveyor js cooperating with this project and is :furnishing some of the personnel and assumes about 50 percent of the cost. A gravity meter was operated continuously at the base station in the Department of Commerce Building in Washington, D. C., :for a period of 15 days in May 1949 with readings recorded at intervals of 15 minutes. These observations were part of a world-wide series of continuous observations made by various countries and industrial con· cerns to determine the tidal effect on gravity. · A gravity party operated in South America. Observations were made with a pendulum gravity apparatus and a vVorden gravimeter. Nine pendulum gravity stations were established in Latin America. At the request of several of the Federal agencies and with funds allocated :from those agencies, the following special surveys were accomplished : For the Department of the Army, control stations were established at the Ordnance Depot at Aberdeen, Md., and surveys were made in the. vicinity of Tooele, Utah, for an experimental project to determine the effect of various types of explosives on underground structures built in different types of soil. Triangulation and leveling were accomplished for the Department of the Navy at the Aviation Ordnance Test Station in the vicinity of Chincoteague, Va., and triangulation and traverse surveys were made at the Naval Test Area in the vicinity of Inyokern, Calif. Locations were also provided for four photo-theodolites at the Chesapeake Bay Annex of the Naval Research Laboratory. At the request of the Public Buildings Administration, a number of bench marks were set in the exterior walls of the White House at Washington, D. C. Periodic leveling will be accomplished1to these marks dul'.ing the period of alterations to the White House to determine if any settlement of the foundation is occurring. The verticality of the side walls is also being determined and will be tested at periodic intervals during the construction work. The movement of several types of piles under various loadings was also determined at the proposed location of the General Accounting Office building in w· ashington, D. C. Several special projects were undertaken or continued during the year. In connect10n with an experimental project to determine whether the deflection of the vertical can be obtained from a study of ~avity anomalies, which is being carried on in cooperation with the United States Army Map Service, a gravity party operated in the south-central section of the country. Observations were made with

16

a pendulum gravity apparatus and a Worden gravimeter. Thirty-six I>endulum gravity stations were established in the United States. Gravimetric deflections were obtained at seven astronomic-geodetic Points, the radius of gravity field varying from 130 to 180 kilometers. from the station. A considerable amount of additional gravity data have been obtained from commercial sources on a confidential basis, Providing increased regional coverage and detailed surveys at several additional astronomic-geodetic stations. The project has included studies of such problems as departure from normal vertical gradient, reduction of astronomic observations to the geoid, and obtaining ade. quate gravity representation in mountainous areas. Two parties operated in southern California on earthquake investigation surveys. The program is to provide periodic surveys across fault lines in an attempt to determine any movement which might possibly be a forecast of an earthquake preliminary to a major break. Leveling, triangulation, and traverse were accomplished in the Vicinity of Terminal Island, Long Beach, Calif., in connection with determinations of subsidence and horizontal movement in this area which are affecting the large installations of the Bureau of Yards and Docks of the Navy. Periodic leveling and traverse surveys wiJl be accomplished here in order to determine the extent of the vertical and horizontal movements. At the request of the Nevada State Planning Board, triangulation surveys were accomplished north of Elko, Nev. The State Planning ~oard and the State Highway Department of Nevada are desirous ·of having an extensive amount of control established in their State. At the request of the Highway Department of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and with funds from that organization, triangulation was provided in connection with construction of the York River Bridge . at Yorktown, Va.

Processing of field records continued in the offices in ·washington and New York City. One hundred and fourteen projects of triangu~a tion or traverse were adjusted, providing data for 6,167 stations distributed in 21 States and in Alaska. Seven countries of western Europe have submitted their triangulation data to the A~my Map Service and the l_atter ha~ sent th.em to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. These data w1ll be adJusted simultaneously so that the final results will be on the same European datulll· The preliminary computations are under way at the present time. Eight large triangulation adjustments were completed using the newly. insta.ll~d p_unch-card computing machines, and 1,200 ge'!" graphic pos1t10ns m South Dakota were converted to plane coordi· nates. Preliminary computations were made for 1,831 miles of first-order and 2,363 miles of second-order leveling; combination computations were made for 103 miles of second-order leveling; and distribution o~ corrections were made for 356 miles of first-order and 1,721 miles o
20

second-order leveling. Eight adjustments were completed requiring the solution of 82 normal equations and provided final or tentative elevations :for 3,125 miles of first-order and 676 miles of second-order · . . . leveling. The office processmg of field astronomical observations was kept current. Seven latitudes, eight longitudes, and nine azimuths were computed, and seven Laplace azimuths were derived. The pendulum observations for gravity made during the year in the tTnited States and South America were processed and values of gravity, elevations of stations, and isostatic reductions were computed for those in the United States. · · The effect of the weight of the water impounded in Lake Mead (Hoover Dam) upon the warping of the geoid in that region was computed. Projection tables for charting purposes were computed. Computation of geodetic data for use in cartography included grid intersections for State plane coordinates, grid intersections for Lambert projection tables for aeronautical charts, and distances for the construction of electronic position indicator and Shoran curves on field survey sheets. TIDE AND CURRENT SURVEYS Tide and current surveys provide basic data for the surveying activities of the Bureau, for the prediction of tides and currents as an aid to water-borne commerce, and for the industrial development of our coastal harbors. In hydrogra_phic surveys, soundings must be corrected for the height of the tide so that the nautical chart will show all depths referred t-0 a uniform datum. In photogrammetric surveys o:{ coastal areas, the aerial photographs which are taken at various stages of the tide have to be adjusted so that the shoreline depicts conditions at high water. In geodetic control surveys, the datum of mean sea level, used in leveling operations, is determmed from tide observations at various/laces along our coasts. Tide an current predictions, which supply advance information on the rise and fall of the tide and the ebb and tlow of the current, are prerequisites to safe navigation. These are made available to the inariner through publication of annual tide and current tables and through tidal current charts. . En&'ineering and construction projects associated with the industrial development of coastal harbors tequire data on the elevation of tidal datum planes and the circulation of the tidal waters. Structures, for example, have to be located so that they will not be flooded by }ugh waters, and ~ntake pipes for plants must be placed at the .economical level and have an ample supply of water at all stages of the tide without increasing the height required to pump cooling water. Observational data on the ebb and flow of the current are essential in the solution of problems of sewage disposal and water pollution. Supplementing these principal uses, there is an increasing demand for tide and current data for a number of collateral uses, such as fisheries, determination of boundaries of tidelands, offshore oil production projects, sports and recreational activities, and for investigations of slow changes taking place in the relation of land to sea.

21

During the.year, the tidal program included the operation of 132 primary and secondary tide stations, 48 of which were located on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, 16 on the Pacific coast, 1S in Alaska, 15 on Pacific islands, and 40 in Latin America. Of these, 88 stations were maintained in cooperation with other agencies, including the gover1~ ments in Central and South America; the Department of State; various units of the Army, Navy, and Coast Guard; the Civil Aeronautics Administration; and municipal and scientific organizations. . The Bureau continued its participation in tidal investigations in Central and South America under the cooperation with the American Republics program of the Department of State and the Inter-American Geodetic Survey program of the Caribbean Defense Command of the Department of the Army. The cooperative t>roject for obtaining systematic tide observations in the western Pacific area was also continued, and 14 tide stations were in operation during the year. To carry out the tidal surveys of the Bureau, a tide station servi~ ing party was. in operation in each of the following areas: Atlantic and Gulf coasts, Pacific coast, Pacific islands area, and South and Central America. During the summer months a subparty was en· gaged in bench mark recovery operations. The results of the current survey of Delaware Bay and River were made available through the publication of tidal current charts for those waterways. A comprehensive current survey of Tampa Bay, Fla., was begun in October 1948. Data from this survey have been utilized to calculate daily predictions of the current for Tampa Bay entrance for publication in the current tables for 1950. The coopera· tive arrangement with the Coast Guard for obtaining hourly current observations throughout the year at Five Fathom Bank and Frying Pan Shoals Lightships was continued. . As a part of the oceanographic work of the Bureau, observations of temperature and density of sea water were taken at most of its tide stations in the United States as well as at a number of its cooperative tide stations in foreign countries. The data derived from these ob· servations supply useful information to the shipping and fishing industries, to industrial plants using salt water, and to various scien· tific organizations. During the year, there were a total of 97 stations at which observational data were being obtained. Thermographs for ·continuous recording of fluctuations of sea water temperatures were in operation at six of these stations. A preliminary study of the thermograph records from Atlantic City reveals a correlation between variations in the temperature of the water and the rise and fall of tbe tide. Progress on the processing of field records, including tide recordF . from primary and secondary tide stations and from hydrographjc_ surveys, and current meter records, has kept pace with field surveys. Leveling records were processed for 2,052 bench marks at 422 stations. The program of special tidal studies for selected areas was kept current and 11 reports were prepared during the year. Tide and current predictions for the year 1950 were completed :for eight tide and current tables. Special tide and current predictions were also prepared for Navy establishments, for the Marine Corps School, Quantico, Va., and for the Coast Guard. 22

Exchange of tidal predictions was carried out with Canada, Argentina, England, France, Netherlands, Germany, and India Daily tide predictions for Bangkok Bar for the year 1950 were supplied to Siam. For use in a study of the possible correlation between earth tides and volcanic activity special predictions of the vertical component of the tide-producing forces in the vicinity of Paricutin Volcano, Mexico, covering the periods February-August 1946 an<l September 1948--.Jnly 194!>, were prepared for the United States Committee for the Study of Paricutiu Volcano, National Research Council. The development of the system for warning the Ha waiiun Isla11<ls of an impending seismic sea wan~ was considerably advanced during the past year. Five seismic sea wave detectors were installed including a replacement at Honolulu. The new im;tallations were made at Hilo, Midway, and Palmyra in the Pacific and at Dutch Hal'bor, Alaska. Arrangements were made to include :i number of additional tide stations in the system as wave-reporting stations. Included are La ,Jolla, Calif., and Balboa, C. Z., and stations that are to be established at Kodiak, Alaska, and San Pedro, Calif. There are in all 18 wavereporting stations in the system of which 5 are equipped with fletectors. This warning system is a joint undertakmg of the Const and Geodetic Survey \vith the National Military Establislunent and other agencies. GEOMAGNETIC SURVEYS The geomagnetic work of the Bureau was instituted over a century ago as one of the essential steps in the preparation of nautical charts. Magnetic observations have been made during many years at several thousand places in the United States and its Territories to determine the geographic distribution of important magnetic elements, especially magnetic declination, which varles in the United States from 22° ·west of notth in Maine to 24° east of north in the State of Washington. Since the direction and intensity of the earth's magnetic field change with time, it is necessary to e\·aluate these cha11ges by repeating observations at 5-ye:ir intervals at some 200 repeat stations uniformly distributed over the whole country. Systematic magnetic survevs provide data on magnetic declination, horizontal intensity, and (1ip, from which the magnetic field can bo defined and magnetic charts compiled. Using data compiled from magnetic surveys, the Bureau furnishes information to surveyors engaged in retracing old property lines originally established by com pass bcari11gs. Data are also supplied to individuals or agencies interested in studies of sun-spot activity, auroral and ionospheric disturbances, radio communications, and aids to navigation, and in geophysical prospecting for oil-bearing structures and mineral wealth. During the year, continuous photographic records of the changes in the principal magnetic elements were obtained at magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, Md.; Honolulu, T. H.; San Juan, P.R.; Tucson, Ariz.; and at Sitka, College, and Barrow, Alaska. Automatic declination recording stations were continued in operation at Gatlinburg, Tenn., and Logan, Utah. Field parties operated during part of the year obtaining data on the distribution of secular change in the UnHed States.

23

Progress has been made in collecting and computing data for use in compiling a world isogonic chart, scheduled for issue in 1950. ~n accordance with agreements with the United States Hydrograplnc Office, the Bureau will be responsible for the compilation of this and other worldwjde magnetic charts, and the charts will be published by the Hydro~raphic Office. The United States central library of world geomagnetw data has been maintained. The acquisition of important quantities of new material has improved its usefulness. Processing of field and observatory data is now being expedited by a punch-card system. Instruction in geomagnetic operations and processing of data was given to reJ?resentatives from other Federal agencies and to students from the I hilippines, Peru, Venezuela, Siam, and China. Revisions of magnetic declination data were made on several hundred nautical and aeronautical charts. Similar data are furnished regularly to the Army Map Service. Magnetic conditions, based on records at the Cheltenham Observatory, were reported daily to the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards in connection with its program of forecasting radio transmission conditions. The weekly K-index report on magnetic conditions at Cheltenham Observatory was continued throughout the year. Close cooperation was continued with the Department of Terrestrial Mag-netism of the Carnegie Institution of Washington on several maJor projects. This included maintenance of the International Magnetic Standard and operation of a cosmic ray station at Cheltenham Observatory, and the operation of an atmospheric-electricity recording station at Tucson Observatory. The Bureau collaborated with the International Association of Terrestrial Magnetism and Electricity in the collection, reduction, and compilation of Kand C numbers for the calendar year 1948, and with the Pan American Institute of Geography and History by assisting in the establishment of standards of magnetic practice for adoption by all American nations. Two complete magnetographs of American manufacture have been inspected and tested for the National University of Argentina and for the Philippine Government. The following table shows the distribution of magnetic observations made by field parties during the year :

SEISMOLOGY Seismologic investigation in the Const and Geodrtic Snney was begun in Hl25. The program is directe<l primarily toward the mitigation of loss of life and property in the United States due to ea1·thquakes, u11d to conducting basic research of value in our national defense program. To accomplish these objectives the Bureau irnlintains a chain of seismograph stations to locate earthquakes and map areas of seismic risk; it cooperates with many uuirnrsities to salvage valuable technicaJ data that might otherwise be lost; it maintains a special field office in San Francisco to collect instrumental and noninstrnmental information on earthquakes occurring in the seismically active \Vest coast armL; and maintains a staff in the '\Vashington Oflice Jo conduct research, compile rpports, and furnish information to the public. In addition to these :functions the Bureau was called on during the year to carry out research progrums sponsored by other Federal ngencies. It also took an active part in the field investigation of the Puget Sound earthquake of April 13, 1!)4!), which caused a property loss of more than $30,000,000 and again :focused public attention on the earthquake problem. Normal teleseismic work involved the operation of 26 seismological observatories, processing the records for locating earthquakes, and publishing results. Fifteen o:f these stations were maintained in collaboration with universities or scientlfic institutions. Station data and bulletins were exchanged with other stations throughont the world. 111e epicenter service was carried out on a greatly expande<l and faster basis. In addition to the cooperation of Science Service :md the Jesuit 25

Seismological Association in this project, the State Department, the Public Buildings Administration, and the military services furnished communications facilities which supplied immediate seismological data from all parts of the world. Approximately 3,400 earthquake messages were received and 120 earthquake locations were announced within a day or two. A new service was inaugurated whereby the 250 subscribers to this information service are fumished additional information on minor shocks. This insures more satisfactory analysis of seismograph records £or basic research Ly seismological stations operating independently. To improve earthquake locations and make available more seismic data for research, the Bureau tested the vibration characteristics of a site at the University of Kansas, where a seismographic installation is proposed. At Overton, Nev., the station of the Lake Mead networJ{ was reactivated. Keller visible-recording seismographs were installe<l at the magnetic observatories at College, Alaska; Tucson, Ariz.; and Honolulu, T. H. These installations are an essential part of a seismic sea wave warning service. General statistical information on earthquakes was obtained from a corps of nearly 40,000 volunteer reporters representing interested business concerns, railroads, public utilities, the United States 'Veather Bureau, and other organizations. Information is thus rna<le available on the intensity distribution of earthquakes and valuable statistical data are compiled for insurance companies. In nine western States this project is supervised by collaborators generally associated with the geological departments of State universities. About 3,000 descriptive reports were collected during the year. "Tith the combination of seismographic data and descriptive reports, 185 earthquakes were located in the United States. Thirty earthquake areas were canvassed for detailed information. Specially designed seismographs were maintained to record destructive ground motions for use in the design of structures. Forty-five such rnstruments are operated in the Pacific coast area, 4 in Montana, 4 in Nevada, 1 in Utah, and 7 in South and Central America. One hundred and four records were obtained of 24 earthquakes, the most important of which were 2 records of the Puget Sound earthquake. The ground motion at _Olympia was as great as any thus fur recorded on an instrument of this type. As part of this engineering research program the Bure>au measured building and ground vibrations to obtain pertinent data. Vibration observations were made in eight buildings and one tower, and the ground vibrations resulting from two heavy blasts fired on Tennessee Valley Authority projects in northeastern Tennessee were measured. In California, an Earthquake Engineering Research Institute was organized, through the efforts of a committee under sponsorship of the Bureau, to conduct investigations in the undeveloped fields of structural dynamics and aseismic design. As an aid to this program, and through the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research, plans were made to subject the Bureau's important strong-motion seismograph records to exhaustive analysis using the electrical analog co1!1putor at the California Institute of Technology. This work, too laborious for solution by individual computers, will provide informa-

26

tion regarding the response of oscillating structures of vuriom; natural frequencies, and thus advance the deYelopmeut of structural design practices. Copies of seismograms from sensitive instruments as well as strongmotion records are regularly loaned to individuals and research agencies. Hecords of more than 30 different earthquakes were supplied for such special investigations. There was wide demand for a map i>howing earthquake risk in the United States, prepared last year with the help of leading seismologists of the country, for use in connection with building codes. The frequent occurre11ce of destructive shocks in the State of \Vashington made it necessary to modify the map and assign a higher earthquake probability to that area. As a result of the Bureau's efforts, a Pan American association, including a library and central information bureau for seismological projects, has been organized under the auspices of the Commission on Cartography of the Pan American Institute of Geography and History. Assistance in instrumentation was :furnished the Seismologicv,l Institute of Chile and the Geophysical Institute of Mexico in ad· vancing their engineering-seismological programs, and conforences were held with many Yisiting seismologists and engineers from the southern republics 011 various phases of our program. IMPROVEMENTS IN
INSTRUME~TS,

EQUIPMENT, AND

TECHNIQUES Booause of its highly specialized activities, the Bureau has from its inception recognized the importance of developing new ancl improved instruments, equipment, and techniques in order that better results might be obtained at reduced costs. A radiosonic laboratory is maintained for the development and servicing of electronic equipment, and a research sect.ion for the improvemm1t and development of aerial photographic mapping instruments aml equipment. A modern shop servicing all instruments and equipment used is also maintained in the Bureau's field and office work. The Bureau cooperates with Federal, State, municipal, and private agencies in furnishing technical details on new instruments, methods, and practices. Fo_r~ign representatives, both governmental and private~ frequently v1s1t the Bureau to obsene the new proces;;es and acquire data on their performance. A number of improvements were made cluring the year in the operating equipment used in hydrographic surveying. A model II electronic posit.ion indicator (EPl) was completed and tested under service conditions. The new model includes completely redesigned ground equipment and transmitters with synchronizer and antennaattenuator. Two new type dural portable radio masts, 100 feet in height, were obtained for use at the EPI shore stations in Florida. Ship-borne Shoran equipments were modified, including a new type antenna and reflector system, to permit the use of ships as ground stations. This will permit a wider use of Shoran in hydrographic survey control. Special graphs were designed to expedite the reduction of echo-sounding records, and a more ellicient method was devised for making bar checks for calibration of echo-sounding equipment. In connection with our electronic work, a new type of beam for beam

for

27

compasses has been developed for use in preparing Shoran and EPI plotting sheets. The new beam is made of magnesium instead of wood and has the desirable properties of lightness, stiffness, and freedom from warping. Further improvement has been made in the quality, accuracy, and speed of stereoscopic contouring with the Reading plotter. The establishment of the photogrammetric test are~t durmg the previous fiscal year has made it possible to make more detailed studies of the requirements of adjustment of the nine-lens camera and its associated equipment. Toward the close of the fiscal year, a photo-theodolite was acquired for expediting the establishment of supplemental control for stereoscopic mapping in Alaska. "With it, terrestrial photographs are taken from established stations and unknown points determined, to serve as control for aerial photographs. , New developments were made in connect.ion with the seismic sea wave waming system for the Pacific area. Laboratory tests simulating the tide and seiche action at detector stations were made in order to facilitate the installation of sea wave detectors. "\Vork was begun on the construction of a seismic sea wave travel time chart for each reporting station. In the field of seismology, a method was develope<l for calibrating galvanometric seismographs by imposing a wide range of frequencies on the seismometer pendulum. The pendulum is forced into vibration by a specially designed electrical device that generates low frequency oscillatory currents. To insure more accurate recording oi destructive earthquake motions, new type unifilar suspensions for strong-motion accelerographs wern installed in all equipment on the West coast. New photographic recorders, designed for compactness and light weight, were built for seismological field operations. Standard types of magnetic instruments for field and observatory use have been designed and are being manufactured by American firms. These instruments include earth inductors, magnetometers, magnetic variometers, and special photographic recorders for use in Arctic regions. Improvements in our tide and current instruments included the following: The NK-7 portable depth recorder was modified for use as a tide gage, automatically controlled by n modified hydrographic clock and with a marigram scale of about 1 inch to 8.8 feet. Specially designed crystal controlled radio equipment to operate in the ultra high-frequency band has been procured for use with the Roberts radio current meter. The radio receiver of this equipment is capable of selecting any one of the signals from a possible 12 radio current meter transmitters at the will of the operator. In the field of geodesy, several important improvements were made in equipment and techniques during the year. Among these are the following: A new set of theodolite testing collimators was completed and installed on the interior walls of the gravity room in the basement of the Department of Commerce building. The instruments will be less affected by temperature changes and there will be less likelihood of interference during the testing. The photographic process of producing precise level rods has been improved through the use of new and improved tools and procedures.

28

As a result, the time required to rrraduate a rod has been materially reduced, and the graduations can be applied with so high a degree 0£ accuracy that rejections seldom occur even though the over-all tolerance in the 10-foot rod is only 0.004 inch. A station mark of new design, produced by mechanical means instead of by casting, has been ~erfected during the year. This is the first major change in this item m many years. The new marker is onehalf the weight of the cast murk, the legend on the face is sharper, and the cost of production will be less. Improvements were initiated in sit.,r:nal ]amp bulbs involving the centering of the filament and the quality of the glass, both 0£ which will increase the range of the lamp. A cold chamber has been built in the Bureau for testing instruments at temperatures of -40° F. and lower. Refrigeration is accomplished by the use of dry ice. The chamber is large enough to test a standard tide gage or an astronomic transit. Several improvements have been made in our chart-reproduction methods. One is a method of creating an engraving ground on blank glass of large size suitable for engravmg on the pro3ection ruling machine. From these engraved plates, plastic prints and duplicate negatives and positives 0£ various projections can be prepared. Techniques have also been developed for improving the fit of junctions on the printing plates of nautical charts where more than one · 11e~ative is required for a chart. The new procedure consists of a special method of correcting the junctions on the negatives before the plate is made and eliminates practically all lithographic drafting on the plate, heretofore a considerable task. Two Monotype type-setting machines have been installed for composing and casting type for use on nautical and aeronautical charts. These machines furnish a long needed means of meeting the demands of the Bureau for type work. · Several.high-speed c_ulculating machines, using punched-curd metl~ ods, were mstalled durmg the year. These methods were :found applicable to our specialized activities and were used in the adjustment of extensive triangulation networks, in the harmonic analysis of tide and current data, in the computation of hourly values of magnetic components, and for computing pay rolls. The installation of these machines has resulted in the saving of many man-hours of labor. FEDERAL AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
FEDERAL

Am:Ncrns

The Bureau has cooperated with various governmental agencies in establishing horizontal and vertical control stations for use in their surveying and mapping and other engineering projects, and in making available to them information on our methods and techniques. An important agreement was entered into with the Hydrographic Office of the Department of the Navy regarding publication of nautical charts of the Panama Canal. Under. this arrangement, the Coast and Geodetic Survey will discontinue compiling and printing charts of the Canal, but will continue to make surveys of the areas and furnish the results to the Hydographic Office for use in maintaining the
2!)

charts. Responsibilit1 for chart coverage of the area will rest with the Hydrographic Office for such period as is considered strategically necessary. Close liaison was continued with the Civil Aeronautics A<lrhinistration, through its regional offices, in the matter of exchange of information and prompt notification of developments in new techniques and new requireme11ts. This on-the-spot contact by Coast and Geodetic Survey officers stationed in the CAA offices has proved beneficial to both Bureaus. Information received is screened at the regional oflice level and forwarded to vVashington for application to our aeronautical charts. This program has resulted in important information bein~ applied to the charts far in advance of its receipt through usual channels. The Bureau cooperated with the Air l\Iateriel Command in supervising the design of a special coor<li11ate setting machine for use in the construction of aircraft jigs. This work ·was done under funds transferred from the Department of the Air Force. The Bureau will also supervise the construction of the machine. Cooperation with the Department of Justice was continued in connection with the California submerged ]ands case. Advice was given the Department on technical aspects of the case and maps prepared for use as exhibits in supplementary briefs.
A::llEIUCAX REPUBLlCS

The Bureau participated for the ninth consecutive year in the Cooperation "\Vith the American Republics program which is sponsored and financed by the Department of State. Participation embraces two major activities-an Exchan~e of Persons program, under which qualified trainees from the Sontl1 American countries receive training in Coast and Geodetic Snney methods and procedures, and a Scientific and Technical program, under which the Bureau acts in a consultative and advisory capacity to these countries. These two programs are closely alJied, and the operation and results of one are reflected in the progress made in the other. Under the Exchange of Persons program, in-service training grants are offered to specific government agencies in geodetic surveymg and in map and chart production. Grants include three categories, namely: Type A, financed entirely by the United States; type B, financed wholly by the foreign government; and type C, financed jointly. Durin~ the year, 18 grants were awarded, as follows: In map and chart production-Cuba (2), Ecuador (1), and El Salvado1· (1); in geodetic surveying-Bolivia (3), Chile (2), Cuba (2), Ecuador ( 1), El Sul vador ( 1), Peru ( 3), and Venezuela ( 2). Of these, 14 grants were of type A, 2 of type B, and 2 of type C. Twenty-one trainees under the Hl48 program, and one trainee under the 1!:>47 program, continued their training in 1!:>49. . The period of training covers 6 to 8 months. Emphasis is on the practical application of methods and procedures, supplemented by lectures and discm;sions on theory, with specific reference to tJ~e manuals and special publications of the Bureau. "\Vherever practicable, trainees are assigned to field parties to learn methods of party operation and for practical experience in the use of instruments.

In addition to these formal training grant~, nine visi~or trai!1ees from several of the Central and South Amencan countries received and were given instruction in Coast Survey methods at various periods. In addition to the training received in the Bureau, trainees visit other governmental agencies to obtain as broad a view as possible of tl~e activities in which they are interested. Many trainees afliliate with some of the national and international professional societies and technical organizations in order to keep abreast of the latest developments an<l techniques in surveying and mapping through publications and meetings of t'hese bodies. Under the Scientific and Technical program, five technical missions were sent to various countries during the year. These Bureau experts consulted with representatives of foreign government a~encies and rendered advice concerning the plannin,g and operation of broad programs in tides, geomag-netism and seisinology, geodesy, photogrammetry, city surveys, and technical procedures and methods pertaining to cartographic activities. Tide stations werc operated on a cooperative basis at 40 ports in Central and South America under the .American Republics program of the Department of State and the Inter-American Geodetic Survey program of the Department of the Army. In establishing tide stations, the Coast and Geodetic Survey furnishes the instrumental equipment and installs the stations. The cooperating countries furnish the sites, the housing for the instruments, and the observers. The tide-gage records are forwarded to the Bureau for analysis and processing, and the results are then distributed to the respective cooperating agencies. The observations are supplying valuable data for use in tide tables, for the construction of nautical charts, for engineering construction along the coast, for development of navigational ai<ls, and for studies of changes in the relation of land to sea. Cooperation continued during the year in the operation of strongmotion seismographs and the interpretation of the records at the following stations: Santiago, Chile; Lima, Peru; Quito, Ecuador; San Jose, Costa Rica; Guatemala City, Guatemala, aml Balboa Heights, Panama. Instructions for calibrating these seismographs Were furnished to Chile and Peru. Complete plans for the construction of an accelerograph were supplied Mexico and an instrument was loaned as a model for duplication. Through the Department of State, telegraphic service was established with seismograph stations in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina for the immediate location of earthquakes. Almost from its inception, the over-all cooperation program has produced important benefits to the United States and to the other American Republics. Cordial relations have been established with military, naval, and civil departments; valuable scientific and technical data have been exchanged; and interest has been stimulated in the development and execution of broad surveying and mapping programs in many of the countries. A byproduct of this program has been the purchase of material and equipment in the United Stu.tes by special missions and the individual trainees. Coast Suney methods have been adopted which contribute materially to the establish31

ment of standards of accuracy and technical procedure on a hemispheric basis. Such standards are being sponsored by the Commission on Cartography of the Pan American Institute of Geography and History at meetings of technical delegates from all the American Republics.
OTHER GovERN.l\IENTS

Under the Philippine Rehabilitation program, authorized by the Seventy-ninth Congress, the Bureau maintained a staff of exper.ts in the Philippines to assist in field survey operations and to tr~lll selected groups of Filipinos. In addition, two groups, of 10 trainees each, received instruction and training in the United States in survey methods. This program will continue until June 30, 1950, when survey operations will be transferred to the Philippine Government. The Bureau cooperated with the Governments of India, Portugal, Siam, and Turkey, in training technicians from these countries in Coast Survey methods. The training is financed entirely by the foreign governments concerned. During the year seven such trainees received instruction. Technical advice in geomagnetic operations and processes was given representatives from Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia, and they were furnished with quartz fibers and metallic suspensions for magnetic instruments. Information on engineering seismology was given to the director of the Seismological Institute at Santiago, Chile, and representatives from Peru were instructed in the operation of seismographs and analyses of records. REPRESENTATION ON COMMISSIONS, BOARDS, AND PANELS The Bureau has maintained representation and membership on a number of commissions, boards, panels, and committees, in order to keep abreast of scientific and technical developments, both national and international, in the fields of activity in which it is interested, and to contribute its specialized knowledge to the study of future national needs. Membership in some of these is defined by law or b.Y Executive order, while in others the cooperation of the Bureau is voluntarily sought. Some of the more important and active of these groups are the following: Mississippi River Oornmission.-The Director of the Bureau continues to serve as the Coast and Geodetic Survey member of the Mississippi River Commission. The commission is responsible for the improvement and maintenance of the Mississippi River, from Cairo, Ill., to the Gulf of Mexico, for flood control, for promoting navigation, and for facilitating commerce on the river. Research and Development Board.-The Director is an advisory member of the Committee on Geophysics and Geography of the Research and Development Board of the National Military Establishment. The Chief of the Division of Geomagnetism and Seismolo~Y and the Chiefs of these Branches, the Assistant Chiefs of the Divisions of Photogrammetry and Tides and Currents, and personnel 0£

32

the Divisions of Geodesy and Coastal Surveys are active members or deputy members of the various panels of the Board. Advice and recommendations have been given the Board on such studies as the further development of electronic survey systems, and obtaining more accurate knowledge of the shape and size of the earth. Air Coordinating Oommittee.-The Chief of the Aeronautical Chart Branch represents the Department of Commerce and is chairman of the Subcommittee on Aeronautical Charts, Technical Division, Air Coordinating Committee. The Air Coordinating Committee was established by Executive order to coordinate the aviation activities of the Federal Government and deals with such matters as standardization of symbols and specifications for aeronautical charts. International Civil Aviation Organization.-An ofiicer of the Bureau, on detached service, is the United States representative on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This organization deals with all phases of civil aviation on an international level, particularly with regard to promoting safety, developing standards, and encouraging uniform procedures.

During th&"-year new pttblications were issued m the following categories:
CoAST PILOTS

Coast pilots are volumes published for use with nautical chart.s. They contain a wide variety of descriptive information for the benefit of the surface navigator. New editions of the Alaska Coast Pilot, part II~, and the Atlantic Coast Pilot, section D, were released for issue. .New editions of the West Indies Coast Pilot and the Gulf Coast Pilot were in press. Supplements were also issued for the seven Coast Pilots which were not in process of revision. TorOGRAPHY The manuscript for part II of Special Publication No. 249, Topographic Manual, was sent to the printer. This manual will supersede Special Publication No. 144, which covers ground topographic surveymg, and all previous photogrammetric instructions. Part II, which covers photogrammetric work, is being published first because the need for this part of the manual is greater.
GEODESY

In the field of geodesy, several new publications were issued. These included: Special Publication No. 240, Manual of Leveling Computation and Adjustment; Special Publication No. 241, Natural Tables for the Computation of Geodetic Positions, Clarke Spheroid of 1866; and Special Publication :No. 242, Definitions of Terms Used in Geodetic and Other Surveys. Revised editions were also issued of Special Publication No. 226, Control Leveling, and Serial 562, Plane-Coordinate Systems. Manuscripts were sent to the printer for the following new publications: Special Publication No. 243, Fundamental Tables for the Deflection of the Vertical; Special Publication No. 244, Pendulum Gravity Data in the United States; Special Publication No. 245, Equal-Area Projections for w·orld Statistical Maps; and Special Publication No. 246, Sines, Cosines, and Tangents, Ten Decimal Places with Ten-Second Interval, 0°--6°.
TIDES AND CURRENTS

Tide and Current Tables, giving advance information on the rise and fall of the tide and the ebb and flow of the current for numerous port.s and waterways throughout the world, are published annually in advance. Eight tables were prepared for the year 1950. The current tables, east coast, North and South America, 1950, include, for the first time, daily predictions of the current for Tampa Bay entrance, Florida. Data for the calculation of these predictions were obtained from the current survey now in progress in Tampa Bay. A new publication, Tidal Current Charts, Delaware Bay and River, and a revised edition of Tidal Current Charts, Boston Harbor, were issued. These charts consist of a series of 12 and depict the direction and velocity of the tidal current throughout the waterway for each hour of the tidal cycle. Index maps of tidal bench marks and loose-leaf compilations of descriptions and elevations of tidal bench marks for Massachusetts,

37

Rhode Island, Connecticut, Alabama, and Mississippi were completed during the year. This information is issued for the use or surveyors and engineers in coastal construction and other engineering projects. A revised edition of publication TW-2, Surface Water Temperatures, Pacific Ocean, and a pamphlet, Seismic Sea Wave Warning Syst~m with Instructions for Wave Reporting Stations, were also issued. In the field of geomagnetism, 16 of the MG series of magnetic observatory reports were issued. Each report contains quarter-size reproductions of magnetograms obtained at one observatory over a period of 6 months. Other publications being printed are: Serial 690, Magnetic Observations in the American Republics 1945-48; Serial 717, Magnetic Declination in Texas; Serial 718, Magnetic Surveys; and Serial 726, Magnetic Poles and the Compass. Seismologic publications issued durin<Y the year included Abstracts of Earthquake Reports for the Western Rfountain Region through the fourth quarter of 1948, the Engineering Seismology Bu1letin through March 1949, and the quarterly Seismological Bulletins through June 1945. The manuscript for Special Publication No. 250, the Determination of True Ground Motion from Seismograph Records, was sent to the printer.
MISCELLANEOUS

The second number of the Jonrnal of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was issued during the year. This publication was initiated for the purpose of keeping our widely scattered field parties, as well as our office personnel, abreast of new improvements m methods and eq_uipment that are constantly taking place in both field and office. Considerable interest has developed in the Journal among the y>ersonnel of the Bureau. Requests for reprints of articles show a wide diversity of interest in the publication. Engineering colleges and scientific organizations, interested in the procedures and technical operations or the Survey, are finding the Journal useful for reference purposes. An illustrated handbook was published as a convenient source of information covering the technical services of the Bureau and the various types of data that are published for the use of the mariner, aviator, and engineer. Another pamphlet, The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, describes the Bureau activities in a less technical manner and replaces a similar pamphlet, now obsolete. Considerable saving in time results from the availability of such handbooks and pamphlets in filling req_uests for information on the work 0 1f the Bureau and in assisting m a field recruitment program. A number of papers, lectures, and miscellaneous items were prepared during the year for presentation before scientific and technical bodies and for publication in technical journals, encyclopedias, and year books.
