'fhe two pnrlies for secondary trin11g11lntious were occupied lilw l:tf'l year: the one in New Jersey, towards the Delnwnre; the other over Lo11g· Island sound; in continuation of the plun which 1 hn<l originally formed lo accelerate the work Ly this distribution of the parties to both sidci;; both in extension of their preceding work. ' . 3. 'l'he two sounding parties were equally continued, upon the pbn stated in my last report: the one in the neighborhood of New York, tlie other in Long Island S(!tl!ld. 4. For a Jong time, the season was so eminently co11trary to the field operations, thnt tho exertions of all these parties were not rewarded with the deserved success; nnd they uniformly stated that it would he entirely impossible to attempt any thing for the primary triangulutiou. 5. Durin·g this period I employed, therefore, my tirnP to the Jinishi11g and adjtisting of the system of ounce weights for tlic mi11ts, which I !ind the honor to present to tl1e 'frensmy Department in the middle of .Tnnc. Upon these work!5 l pre~ent, h~rcwitb, a speciul paper, n·ridcring 1tcco1111t of the new metl10d which I have employed in tlieir ndjustrne11t. Lenvi11µWashingto11 shortly ufter, I ddivercd two S!)ts of the~c wcigl1t~ to the United States Mint in l'hiladelphiu. Jn l\cw York, I nttcndctl ton nnnilH~r of objects relating to the procuring of future necci;:mry nwnns for tlw co11~truction of standurds, and for ihe forming, and new 1!<j11ippin({, of the party for my own field-works, as I hnd allowed the pl1111e tuble parties to avail themselves of former field equipmc11t, in. whntevrr might fit them, in order to establish themselves so much the quicker. 6. During the mechanical operatio11s which this required on the pnrt of the persons in who'>e duty they lie; l took tho first leave of absence on p1ivate business, which I have taken since 1829, when my conncxiorw with. the Government bcgari ngnin, dir1!cting the camp of my next st11tio11 to be formed during aliscncc; which was a.II properly done. But, though J wns shortly after at the station, put the i11strunwut i11 proper order for the work, 11.nd attcmpteu to observe, it was not until the hit of September, exactly, that the weather allowed uctnul observations ; and from thence onwards it has proved very favorable, until iiow, when, for the plulH'· table works, winter overtakes ns. 'l'hc tempcrnture of the season is ratl1cr below what can be endured in that. kind of work, und these purties haw J:iroken up, one after the other, in proportio11 as tlwil' work admits of interrtlJ>tion. 7. 'l'he rcsnlts of all these operations have bct\ll the following: 8. For. the main trin.ngulntiun those stations have been occupied by me, which bind up the station points of the work8 of 183:3, and l Ba4, and unite the secondC1ry triangn lntion of the eastern Ride of Long falu11d and Rhode Island on the cast, and of the Jersey!!, below th<' ba}· 'of New York, on the soiltqwes.t, with proper extensions. · ' · ~he'new theodolite 'of thitty inches dinmeler, which \1~as used for the measurement of these angle.s, lms proved Of g~eat advnntnge for the nc. cqrncy, by It.CJ s~abilHy; i~ which, I prcsumu, it exicecds ariy instrument ever C011St'rUCted for ficJd.work, and its'. grcnt· optknJ 'poW(!f ~of telescope and microscopes.

These new instruments require a nmn of some intelligence to attend 10 them, und to repluce them ubout every four minutes, nccording to the motion of the snn; the ucc~lemtion of the work, which they procure, compensates this mklitional expense manifold. 'rlicy will show n precise lnminot1s poiut, even thron&h tho huzo so frequent on our custom sea shore, when the outline of the 11111 ilsclf, upon which they stand, cannot be tr11ced.

<1gain the stuf<i of the whole work, 11t tlii:; time; nnd, by its cnnJparisan witl1 thr. similar sketches of the former years, the progres1> which the: work hm; made in each year. As tLis cun 11evcr be do11c mitil idl the works have been collected in Washington, and rrdnced for that pu rpo!'e, these sketches cuu never be presented with lhc yearly reporls, similar to 'the present, as they fall in a time when all is yet in full activity otherwise. 'l'hey can, ber-des that, in nny case, be no more thn11 n register of the work, as it progrcssc!1.. 1'1. Already the nhovc shows: thnt the narnl part hns kept pnec witt1 th(: topographical part.'>, n.s they ahv1tys work together, in n:·:~orted rnrties. 'l'he two hydrographic parties have worked up all the ~onndings between the shores quoted above, as surveyed by tl1e tnpogr:1pliicnl parties, from which they receive nlwnys the points, upon which their dct<muinntion:; mu~l bc !;fOHllded, in proportion as they progress; for the watn ibl'!f ull111its no fixed points, affording- nny security li1r the liydrogruphic wNks. 15. When I first directLd Lieutenant Gedney to tnkr. np thn F.ou11di11gs of the sonth side of Long islnnd, and the e11twnce or New York harbor, I directed his attcntio11 to two :mhjects of importance, thr.n not yet nsccrtaincd, hut which I hnd wfficient rem:nn to suppose wo11ld be verified; namely: 1st. 'l'he ·'Xist(:ltec of a -.vesterly cu1Tc11t along the south 8idc of Long islu11d, and nnotlJer coming, nt certain times most likely 011ly; from the Jerney shore of Long branch, and thnt n<'ighborhood, towards tbat po.rt of Long island, where I mensurtel the base liue, both daugerous to navigation, at very import1n1t poiut<i. ~d. The existence of a chnuncl into the hnrhnr of New York: uorlh of the one hnbitnully med; tliougli I could form no accnrntc idea of its depth 1rnd stability. 16. 'l'he first of these suppositions has not yet ht~cn fully invc~lignted, oa nccount of the nature, and extent, of the WNks hithPrto performed, ns it will rcqu ire difforcnt operations; bnt th ti ~e~ond bus snccecdc<l, even beyond my cxpeetntions, ns has ulrc1t<ly become pub! ic siuce rny last re~ port, on account of its importance nud great value, for the so highly important harbor of New York. Licuteunut Gedney found a chnnucl tlwt 'Ldmits, even at low water, every size of merchant vessels. This channel hus already been buoyed out for service in future; and tt~c passiu!.\' of the Ohio, 7·1 gnn ship, through it, is a fact of public notoriety. 17. That such a valuable discovery, which appeared to lie so ncnr, wns not made earlier, is to be attributed simply to the manner in which nautical surveys have generally been rnnde. Without sufficient accurate fixc:<l points on the shore, which the other works of the coast smvey furnished, such a discovery was irnpos.~ible; the most experienced and attentive seamen rnh{ht have sailed about this channel ever so often, without being nble to ascertain the foct; beenuse the place of his vessel, 1it uny time, presents him only an insulated point, disconnected with other parts, and even to a nnmbnr of such points he is unable to nssigri a direction sufficiently accurate to a.ver any such facts; such discoveries can only be the result of a systematic work, grounded upon full muthematical principles, as are appli<'d in our works. 18. Lieutenant Blnkc, commanding the hydrograpbical party iu Long Island sound, has also made discoveries, which, for the same remmn just stated, had remained unknown; he discovered ledges of rocks, hitherto unknown, very dangerolls to tho naviga.tion, purti~ularly in times of low

It is very probable that the survey of tho eastem part, which hns far more ncciuunt1tl variations, will prns1mt more novelty ; but whether in finding something new, or confirming old stntcment.s, these surveys ho.ve tho essential, nn<l above 1111 other valuable, property of nccurncy, 1md certainty of statements, which it is well known is not credited as the propf'l'ty of the maps now in use. I !I. With reforence to the uppropriution whii:l1 it is neccsso.ry to have disposnble for the ensuing year, l hu\'e the honor to state: that the nature of the work, in its present i-;itnution, reqnirns the coutinnnncc of the samo uumber ofpn.rties, of each kind, l\S have been employed the present yea.r, viz: 11i ne topogrnpl1ical pnrtics, two secondary trin.11g11l1ttiou, two sonuding par· tic.>, 11.1111 the cstahl ishm ~:it for the t)min triangulation. ~U.

At lc11st an oqnul sum will, therefore, be necessary for tho next yenr, under th~ supposi-lion that the s·~ssiou of Congress, after the next, will bo short, aud, thcrnfore, tho appropriation be mude in Murch. 2~.

I have also caused gla.ss bulbs and jarsto be blown in Brooklyn, where those hud been made which served for my first comparison, (rendered account of in 1832,) of such sizes as will serve for the lurg·ost mint weights, the go.lions, &c. Another lever bulancc, nlso for larger weights, is constructiug now in the mathematical instrument makc:r's shop of the office. 25. When I return to Washington, it will be my first assiduous task, dnring day, to attend to this final . adjustment of weights. Lust Rpring, already I began it, and completed a number of the smaller weights, ll'Om which I shall contiuue and pl'ocecd on.

The greatest part of the iilund1trds of yards nrc brought to the same approximate slate of adjustment. lt is desirnl.Jlo thut each of them be provided with a divided scale, upon the matrix pttrt of the Blnudard, J.y which common measures muy be ndjustc<l; my ai;sistant has therefore mude upon all those yurcls thnt arc in that state of forwardness, such n i;cnle, divided ·lecirnully, us is legally introduced in the cnstom-houses. lt will lu~ 11eccs~nry to give special charg-e i11 every place where such n yard will be <lcpos1ted, that the actual Slam.lard part of it, which is the yard hutted between the two projecting parts of a ruatrix, shnll he llSt'cl only for the most important comparisons; while the yards of the rneamucrs iu the cu!<torn-houses, the yard-sticks for stores, and all such like measures for common use, are to he adjusted, or compare{), upon this divided r;cale; for this purpose, it is properly inscribed and numbered. 27.

'l'hc estublishmcut for the construction of stalldards of weights measures for the Stutes and custom-houses, pn1sentiug lhe best meaus for the mint to procnrc accurate weights, the directo1· of tlic mint applied to the 'fremmry Depnrtrnrnt to direct : tlt11t there sl)onld be made in that establishment several sets of Ollllr.e weights, from one thonslind onnces down ~o tho tenths of an ounce, in u decimal scale. The houoruLlo the Sccrctnry of the 'l'masury directed 1111~, therefore, to construct them, under dnte of the 13th of May, 1S~u. . . . . . . , . 3. It is of course desirable for the public us woll ns for Government; that a public. account ber01idercd of the llll,lllllS and methods, Ly which th~ weights, which were cow;Lrucfod in conformity to this direction, hnve boeri adjnstod to their proper stnudurds. This cousidcrntiou induces me to pre . . snut, lwrll\vith, snch a report upon the oper1:1tio1.1s, hy \Vhich I ob~4i11ed 11he aim, as lllt\y servo .to judge npnu the accnracy n.i111ed nt and uttained,iq th!lt opcrntion ; ns well as upon tho confidence, thnt cnn be placed upon them, nnd upon tho opcrnt ions thnt may be performed with. them. . 4. The description of the actual mechanical construction of tlrnse weights cnnnot bo the ohjnct here; it bclon.t.rs to the geneml account upon all tho operations performed for the !$enNnl aim of procuriug uniform stnndnrds of weights and measures for tile Stutes o.nd custom honsos, which will, of con rse, be rendered iu proper .time. Only the niathernatic«l priuciples ljp 7 plied to obtain accuracy in this individnul case, aud the inunner in wliich they were used, a.re here to be presented. 5. It is evident that the tusk irnplicd tlio cstahlishment of n full new sys. tom of weights, for which no other guide wus gh·cn but the troy pound, to correspond to twelve ounces of that system; from which, therefore, all the parts of the new dicimal system were to be deduced. It is well known, by all the t\CCOtlllts of similnr operations in ~urope, that they present, scope for ]uhor of gl'ent attention and assidtiity, and requiring vur1ous cori1bilintioils

so with the division of it into nny parts without the assistance of accessory weights, upon which it is not allowed to rely in such an operation ; theucc the op~rntion must be carried on in such a manner, as to render the ultimate results independent of any su~h nwdiurn, as it may have becu necessary to make a temporary use of at the first 011tset. The ultimate result, in tlic case under view, must always be; that such a number of ounces, or parts of onnces, must again represent that pound, when their nominal umonut is the twelve ounces, which it represents; nnd also the coinciding" n111ltiples of the pound, und of the new system, must again be equal in their coum1c11suratc numbers. 7. These considerations led me to the npplication of a system of combined weighing, and more particularly by binary and ternnry combinations of equal weights, to a certuin given or li.Verrcd weight, equal to their i:urn. It must, of course, be extended to such a nnmber of individuals as may be found most ndvantngeous, nccording to the disposable means, to produce n certain nnmber of results, to take a rnenn of them for m~ch in di vi<lual ; to this the number of weighings is propor1ional, and 11atnrally tlctcrmincu. These combined weighings, keeping account of the sum or the errors of the two or three individual weig-lits emr;Joyctl in each weighi11g, ~ivc, therefore, the means to cktcrrnine snch srnull differences evf:11, as tbl' lmlaucfl would otherwise not be able to show, their sum l;oing ddcnninablc in their varied combinations; and the value oC each individnid weight becomes evidently determined by the solviug of the obtained results of tlw weighing:> into those of the individual vHlnes; it gives, nt the same time, by the differences which these re~:ults may show, the rnrasurc of the 1u:cmacy of each weighing operation. 8. It appears proper to Hhow here, in one continuec.l sy8tern, the di1Tercut schemes of combination, and the manner of applying them, which I ham put into practice.

I have nlwuys 'found it equally valuable u11d successful. 9.

The above example is taken from the 6 oz. weights, which required, therefore,' always one pound troy in each basin of the balunce. Their sum represents, therefore, 30 oz. and shows -0,0212 gr. total overweight. When weighed together, comparatively with nnotl1er authentically mnde out 30 oz. weight, or 2~ pounds, the result found wns = -0,0222, therefore only 0,0010 gr. different; (less than one fomtecn-millionth part of the weight,) the sum itself deviating less than one -seven-millionth part of its weight from the standard, nnd the menn of them would present for euch yet an excess of =-0,0035 grain, or about n1o'on of the weight.

(Still W, which showed the largest, was still somewhat reduced, thongh it is in general rather too precarious to be advisable to do so when weights are so nenr.) 12.

ln the first preparatory beginnings of hringing o. weight neal' to adjustmrnt, I, of course, sometimes even limited myself to a less number of combinatious, thoug·h never in the final u<lju~tmei1t, even np to the thirty ounce weig-ht1.> incli1sfre, which requires to load each ha:;in of' the hnlunce with the \Vdght of five~ pounds: which it n<lmitt<:d yet to unexpected satisfaction, the results not varying sensibly· more titan those of the six ouuce quoted ns example. 14. 'l'he order in whii:h the weights below the pound wcrn to b~ determined, was of course prescribed by their ro.tio to the poun<l, and to each other, thus : The 6 ounces by biri:i.ry combination upon the 1 pound. 'Ph1~ 4 ounces hy ternary combinatiou npon ihe 1 pound. 'l'h·~ :3 ouuces by biunry combination npou 6 o~mccs. 'l'he 2 ounces were compared by both the uiunry cornbinution upon four ounces: and the ternary upon six ounces. 'l'hey were evidently of great importaneP, o.<; the ten om1ce weights, t.he most importnnt of the set, had to be made by the deduction of two ounces Crom the pouud, to p1'ep1Lrc tlicrn for tile ternary corn!Ji11ation, throngh which they were carried by the tol1tl Hum of 2 lb. + ti oz. 'l'he fiVt! om1cc weights were cornhinetl binarily upon ten ounces. For the one onnr.c, n11tl tile i11ferior Weigbls, the moue of pro1:CPdillg" Cnll easily be imagined from thiH stnternm1 t ; the senf:ibility of tlie bnlauce incrna:<ing with I he decrease of the weights; l aided it still, by having a series of basins uw.do light1~r, in proportion to the weight they hull to be m;ctl with. 'l'o go here thro11~h tile details of the results would be too long, without adeq11atc marking interdst; it may sufllee lo say, tl111t, hy successive reductions, the weights were all brought to n dc~grcc or accuracy never less than thu.t quoied, until the thirty ounce inclnsivc, whicl1 required the hala11cc to he laden with sixty ounces. Above thirty 01111ccs, tl1e combined weigliingexcec<led the limit of the bnl11nce, so 1hat the ndjnstmcnts hnd lo be mude single hy the sum of inferior ones. 'J'he new weights usC"d in each of tlic subsequent comparisons were always t11km1 into account for thu.t corrected amount, which had resulted from the combiued weighing, when they were themselves adjusted. . 15. It would be of no spccio.I in,tercst tq quote of oach weight its ultimate Vaine, at which it WllS Jeft: jt may snffice to say, thnt CVCJI the g'l'elllCst WC'TC not sufforcd to deviate as mnch as the hundredth part of n grnin ; no such difference was even found when six weights, of ten ounces each, were compared nt once, with a five pound troy weight of Gilhort, accompanying the bnlance procured from him, origi11n\ly for the Virginia Uuiversity. It was this halunce which I used for the combined \Veighings, nud derormlnatious of the ounce weights, up to the fifty otwce, it iieiug. f!onstructed for the extreme weight of sixty ounce~, or five pounds troy. Ev1)ry series of results of o. combined weighing, furnished. naturully the direction by which each individual weight was gradually rednced to its proper stundnrd. Weig-his foiling below, or getting too !urge a quantity (or, ns mny be snid, reqmring too much addition,) were of courne discnrded, t\S for !heir ultimute rank in the sets, and not delivered: though they were still near enough to serve in the combinatory weighing, for comparison, to adjust the others. I wns so lucky, by dint of attention, us to have hardly nny to discnrd. 16. When once the value of the weights is hrong-ht so neur that the variations from their intended accurate \\-,eight is considernhly hdow whi\t the balance is capable to show by single weighing, n result which is unut~ tainable otherwise than by the combined weighing which I have used, it

This must, however, 1wt Le conf>id111-.:d otherwise: Lut as a proof of the fully satisfactory accurucy,obtaincd in the operation: as it is evident that even in the smallest weights, where the ~ensibility oftlie lulnuecs is the greatest, such a proportio1Jal \1·eight and accuracy coulu 11ot pos.~ilily be physically represented; still, however, a fow of the weights were slightly retouched afterwards; nnd for the 3 sets sent to the mint aud to the 'l'rea· sury Department, a piopcr selection was made of the most acc11rntc of each !dud. 19. All the weighings were: of con me, made by substitution; but not· withstanding that by this proce~s the sarr:e state of equilibrium is intcmletl to be produced, by placing the two weights in the idc11tiral positio11 towards the counterpoise and the bal1111ce, this very idcuticul stute of tho balance is not very easily produced. It is mices3ury that the points of reference of the bu lance be exucLly horizontal, and the temperature of liotll anJJs to remnin tlw same, though tltey may not be ut the rnme tc111pernt un·, twcau~c the variation of the momcutLlllt of tile weigltt is Yery grcnt, and i11c.rcust·s very rapidly with the weight, 1111d witli a very smnll clrnnge of temperature. The simple clwng-c of 1tir that tt1kcs plucc by (for i11~\:111<"e) opcui11g the gln:is case, to feed tlte balance, more freq11e11tly on· om~ sid1! tlrn11 on the other, will affect tile tempcratlll'c. It is cvid:!ntly difiicult to as1:ert:1i11 this fact, because u11y tliermometci' cnn only exltil·it tlie Le1nperatun: of the near arnl;ient air, which may be, or way not be, that of tlw nriu it~vlf. It 1s, therefore, sooner discovered in its etlt:ct upon tltc wniµ;liing, tl:an 011 tlic thermometer itsl'lf'. It is nercssnry to lay up the wcig-l1ts lightly and r.1111· tiously, iu the middle of the- basin, and not to gix·e any jur to tho bala11c1" The basin should not conie in a11 o:;cillntory rno1io11, \\·lien put i11 urtinr1. The initial momentum, given by the suddc11ly setti11g tlie balance in nc1io11, produces ati excess of oscillntiou, which is not good; it is cn!n rwt. nlways easy to prevent changes in the poiuts o!' snspcnsion. The cstimution of the coincidence s.hould always be jutlgi:d ouly within the first divisio11, 11curest to the horizontal points; the esti 11mt1!s bet wee11 fortlwr distaucei; will :-:eldom fully agree with those· found nf!erwards, when ·irar coincirlc11cP. To m:tcrm any weight by the diiforC'ncc of the mwill11tinn, is llJ>!'licnbh! nnly within these narrow limits, 11nd there only it will be fo1111d g-nod; for weig-ht~ less titan the balance cn.11 show in a direct manner. 20. In gcneral,as :;irnple an operutiou as weighing uppenrs to be, in its daily common lifo application, it becomes extrcrnely delicate, and therefore very difficult, when mathematical accuracy is aimed at. Jt is PX!remely <lit~ fl.cult to keep the balance exactly in equul adjustment for a 1111mbcr. of successive weighings; and to produce tlw sume circnmstuncc·s, in nil respects, by another, adjustment, .is depending too mnr.h 011 wliut umy he coiled u IUcky chanre, which it is not always cnsy to produce us completely ns re· quired. Tijo delicacy, and strained nttentiou required for that tnsk, proved to ·mo extremely fatiguing. 21. Tho individual weight used to derive tho system of ounce weights from it, was principally n troy ponnd newly procured, hy wuy of veriticntion of the dctorminatio11:; mude in my former comparisons. It was eompn. rerl o.t the United Stutes Mint in Philadelphia, with the weight thcr.o preserved as stanclnrd, nnd presented it perfect equipoise.

Tlic di11ercnt bnoyanc.y of difforcnt metals in the air, nccordiug to their specific grnvity, is well known, a~: well as its nnnvoidnhle vnrintion with the state of the atmosphere; hut tlin nccurntc scale of its vnrintiou is less so, un.d escapes still, i111t grcut mensmlO'., the efforts towurds its uccnrate determination, on acconut of its mi'nuteness; it has, t.hereforc, been tuken, into 1tccou11t only since the f"~lnblishment of the French metric sy:>tom, which mny be considered ns the first r.stublishmcnt of stnnd~rds, made with the scientific mcirns of modern times. The keeping uccount of these considerations in the prese11t CUSP. Wl1S evidently not llCCCSSl\l'Y j Hild not nnswering nny spocittl aim, it was, therefore, omitted entirely. Hnving hrnss standards to .mulw other Lrnss standnr<ls from, and 11.lwuys plucing both exactly under the siune physicid influences, it would hnve be~n mm'P than idle to attempt to kePp account of any possible d1tfereuccs; the differ· eMces between the observations would likely h1wc cxrecded the difference searched after. 25. That different propor\ions of the alloy of copper with other meto.ls must prcsn11t different proportions in these influences, is evident, though their quantity is not yet within our rcnch to dctcnnino precisely; nnd m tho English standurds, from which ours are derived, it dor.s not nppeur thnt

16
ever any particulur rcfornu<..:c to L'1at wits take11 into uecouur. 111 the copy of the ~ritish standards iu the State Department, the troy weigl1t set nppears to have but a slight ucldition, uppnrently, of tin, to the copper, ouly i,uffi.cient lo prevent its taking impressions too cusily. 'l'he avoirdupois weights arc of the color of cannon metal: (often: in England, improperly culled bell metal.) 26. 'l'o state the mmmer a11<1 tlrn mensures taken to 1·rocure bmss of the greatest perfcctiou 1 which hns been employed for the weights, belongs more properly to the description of ull the rneuns employed for the whole ef:>tnbJii,;IJment of all the staudartls, for tho States nnd custom-houses. 'l'he miut weights hut·e, of coursl', partaken uf these: ill all respects. It may suffice here to say, that to ohtnin th1~ proper result in the quality ol the metnl, it hus hecn necessary to establish for ourselvrs the reduction of tbe zinc from the ore, on account of the zinc of cornnwrcc being too impure, und particularly containiug i.rou, wl1ich will always prndncc n porous and very nnequui brass. '27. As desirable as _it rnuy bi~, for case ill usi:ig the weights, ,,nd to prove their authenticity; it is:.however, not acl111issible, with the proper accuracy, to have any marks engraved upon weights. 'fhcy will always collect dust, and thereby niter the weight .. All that is admi:.siblc, for the purpose of authenticity only, is a light stamp, which can eusily be made so as to present no edges, and no depth, in which dust cnn collect. Tho stamp useu was purposely made so as to have all the delincatiug different depths rounded off, and it is put on very lightly, so that the impression cnn Le felt only slightly. ·rhe indication of the quantity of tlrn weight iaust bc1 left to the judgment, upon their size, nnd the murks, ns well ns places in their pucking boxes, where they are lodged i11 exar;tly fitting cavities, lined with velvet. 28. For the manipul1ttion of the weight:;;, the boxes nrc furnished with forks, pincers, and forceps, appropriated to each size of weights-for they must never be touched with the naked hand, after adjustment. It is difficult, even impossible, to prevent entirely that they tarnish, notwithstanding thnt, in the manipulation necessary for their adjustment, after coming from the workmen, pieces of silk were always used over them, nnd that they were nlmost constantly covered with silk stuff in the intermediate times. But the tarnish is, of course, nn effect of the atmosphere; and, if the brnss in general, principally when polished, is suffered to take rhis tarnish, at first from the dry atmosphere alone, so ns to present what is called in numismatics 1: u:rugo nobilis," it nppenrs that it becomei; less liable to take nfterwnrds the tarnish by touching.
