INTRODUCTION.

Charts, as produced by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, are the direct means of protecting from loss the vessels of ~ur Navy, Cc;>ast Guard, and merchant marine, thereby also protecting human lives and commerce. The charts are produced only by this Bureau and reach their high degree of value to the navigator -only when they give ac(]Urate as well as the fullest information. The honest and candid statement which the public should have put before it at this time is that these charts, which should now be ~:xpedited in their production and carry ,accurate and vital knowl~ge to all who need it, are in a measure losing the value they should

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

have. This may seem a startling statement, and it is a deplorable one to have to make, but there is a reason for it. It is a workable problem with but the one answer. To keep these necessary charts in the hands of all who demand them, both field and office forces of the Bureau must be kept in the highest form. The work is absolutely necessary; it can not be accomplished without sufficient funds, which are not now provided; therefore, an adequate appropriation is the only remedy. The present condition is caused entirely by lack of funds-funds sufficient for modern surveying vessels, and funds to operate same; also funds to enable us to secure able officers and crews, with salaries adequate to hold them. This is for the field work, which is but the beginning of the labor. Again, funds are needed for the office work. Highly trained men are necessary properly to care £or the data which are to go on the charts, and those we have are so much underpaid, besides lacking in sufficient numbers, that they are leaving the Bureau for better salaried positions. Indeed, the condition in the Coast and Geodetic Survey is so serious that it threatens to jeopardize the public welfare. The large number of recent resignations from the commissioned personnel and from the other scientific arms 0£ the Bureau, in fact from all classes 0£ the service, will continue more rapidly unless checked by meeting the situation very soon face to face. The commissioned officers are the lowest paid men of their training in the Federal service. Their salaries, compared to those paid in the Arniy and the Navy for similar qualifications, are from 30 to 50 per cent less. Much of their work is more hazardous, requires special training, and takes them into all our country's possessions as the pioneer workers or the navigators-surveyors who "blaze the trail " on land and sea-and no Army or Navy officer has greater qualifications, nor do they sacrifice more than the officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey; yet the latter works for much the lowest salary, gets no longevity pay, no emoluments.1 and after he has given his best years in the service of his country he must retire without pay. Many of the Bureau's officers are just waiting, believing that Congress will properly recognize this harmful and unjust condition. In the chapters to follow, under separate headings, I have endeavored to try again, by further emphasis and explanation, to show what has caused this certain disintegration, with the hope that relief will be immediately forthcoming, and thereby save further inroads on the proper functioning of this important Bureau.

Part 1.-CONDITION AND WORK OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

CHAPTER I.
CONDITION OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

Too few persons realize the sacrifices a man of ability is making at the present time by remaining in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Before this country entered the war conditions had grown to a serious stage, but since the signing of the armistice steady disintegration has gone on, and the situation has reached a point where the quality of the Survey's employees is declining principally under the stress of present economic conditions. Unless proper relief is forthcoming at once, and the present salaries are materially advanced, this important branch of the Federal Government, which has so much to do with the protecting of human lives, will, in a measure at least, be stripped of its best brains. There are three definite and logical reasons for this situation : 1. The sorrowful tradition that Federal employees should not expect to be paid even nearly as much as though they were working for some private corporation or firm. · 2. The high cost of living, and that in the more than 100 years of existence of this Bureau during which some salaries have not been increased. 3. The unfortunate and unbusinesslike method of suhmitting lumpsum appropriations to be used to pay salaries :far in advance of those received by men and women doing similar, and in many cases; highergrade work, and who are paid from statutory salaries which are antiquated and unjust, because they were made for conditions a decade or more ago. Out of these conditions has arisen the state of affairs with respect to each of the different classes of employees of this Bureau mentioned below :
DRAFTSMEN.

The salaries of hydrographic and topographic draftsmen ( cartographers) in the Coast and Geodetic Survey range from $1,000 to $2,400 per annum. In various Government bureaus where employees are paid from lump-sum appropriations the salaries are often double those given above. For example, in the Navy Department, the Bureaus of Steam Engineering, Construction and Repair, and Yards and Docks have adopted the Macy award for draftsmen, which award is also in effect in all shipyards in the United States. A comparison of the salaries established under this award with those
9

paid in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for work of equal irnportance, and requiring equivalent technical qualifications indicates the following:

c__________

For the entrance grade of topographic draftsman, for which this Bureau pays $1,000 per annum, the War Department offers $2,100 per .annum. The qualifications for the two positions are identical. Salaries "{>aid outside the Government service are comparable with those .established by the Macy award given above. As this report is being written, I have before me for acceptance the resignation of one of our draftsmen who has been with us more than nine years, whose basic pay is now but $1,400 per annum, and who is going to a position that pays him $2,600 per annum. Another draftsman recently left this Bureau who had not the basic education to reach the higher grades in our technical work. His basic pay here was $1,400. He immediately accepted a position as a draftsman in .another branch of the Government service at $1,800 per annum. The result of this situation is that our trained cartographers are resigning to obtain elsewhere the adequate compensation which is denied them in this Bureau. At this present time we have 28 positions for draftsmen, 11 of which are vacant or filled by temporary employees (persons who have not the qualifications for permanent .appointment, but whose services are used with the hope of some advancement in utilizing the bulk of data that have accumulated in the office). In other words, only about two-thirds of our drafting force of only 28 are capable of any independen.t effort in digesting the mass of accumulated data that 've haYe before us. In spite of the fact that the requirements have recently been so amended as to permit of our accepting high-school graduates, we are unable to -obtain candidates to fill the vacancies thus created. This force, without which charts can not be prod need, is at present actively disintegrating. Such disintegration can be checked only by ~ material increase in all grades of pay. Unless it is checked it will reach the point where the Bureau will be unable to produce the corrected -charts on which the safety 0£ navigation directly depends. This deplorable situation, which is definitely affecting the highest -efficiency of our charts, has been repeatedly emphasized, b.oth publicly an'd in my annual reports, but without receiving the slightest relief. These men deserve much credit for remaining in their positions so long, and their loyalty, in the face 0£ underpay and miserable quarters to work in, is highly creditable.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
COMPUTERS.

11

We have need :for many more computers than are authorized in the present appropriation bill, and the entrance and lower-grade salaries should be made higher. I shall mention only the salient points, .and not go into lengthy details. The geodetic surveys o:f this Bureau are broad and comprehensive. Our schemes of triangulation extend all -over continental _United States, and are the framework on which are based, and 'vhich :furnish the controlling positions for, operations (Government, State, and county) o:f less extensive character. Necessarily. over such a broad and comprehensive scheme the arcs of triangulation extended over great areas and the stations marking the points o:f triangulation were widely separated. Likewise, lines of precise lHels stretch far across the continent. The outcome of this was that the publications that have been issued by this Bureau -giving the geographic positions and descriptions of triangulation stations and the descriptions and elevations of precise-leveling stations have contained, and now contain, the data for many States in the Union. That is to say, that our triangulation publications have been issued so that each contains a particular arc of triangulation without reference to the political boundaries of the area covered, and these arcs sometimes extend through two or three States of the Union, and the publication containing our precise levels has data for all of the States of the Union. Heretofore the inducement for issuing these publications in this form has been that the scheme for triangulation and levels has been so large that the points contained in any one political division were so small in number that in but few instances would there have been justification :for issuing a publication ·Containing these data for any one State in the Union. These observations have now progressed to such a point that each class of publication contains a very great number of positions, elevations, and descriptions of triangulation and precise-leveling stations in most of the States of the Union, so that it is now wasteful to distribute them in the form in which they have been issued heretofore, be-cause the recipient is interested only in data for his particular locality. A marked economy would be effected by issuing a single publication for each State in the Union, in which -would be assembled all -geodetic data that have resulted from observations to date of issue. ·such a publication would concentrate much information that is of great and valuable service to local surveyors, aud the information would be in such form that it would be readilv accessible. To do this on a practical and satisfactory basis would require that each publication thus issued for each State in the Union should contain, not only the essential geographic positions that have been ,computed for the large arcs of trumgulation that extend over the whole country, but the geogra,phic positions and descriptions of ·every minor point of triangulation that has been <letermined in ·conjunction with the larger basic observations; and here is where we are hopelessly swamped with ~mr presen~ c?mputing force. Therf' -are portfolios of field observations contammg thousands of such stations in the archives of this Bureau that have never been computed. Indeed, so inadequate is our computing force to meet the

12

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

present needs that we have adopted the expedient of putting into print the results from the latest field work, and gradually working backward into the old material. This is believed to be a very much better method than to go back to the old work first, for if this were don~ the most recent work would be very many years old before it could be put into print. As it is, the public is deprived of the benefits of this information that has cost many years of effort to obtain, as well as many thousands of dollars. The cost of the computation and printing would be but a fractional part of the expenditures that have already been made. The entrance salary for computers should be $1,600 per annum rather than $1,200, and the number of positions in the higher grades should be increased. The entrance salary of $1,200 per annum is too low to command the interest of men capable of doing this work. Those who come to us at this salary and learn of the meager prospects of advancement stay but a short while. The men who lingered but a short while were 31 during the past fiscal year, and of the 11 positions at $1,200 per annum 9 are now filled by temporary employees.
ENGRAVERS.

In no section of the Bureau is the antiquity and inadequacy of the existing salary scale more strikingly exemplified than in the engraving section. The sundry civil act for 1920 increased two $1,000 positions to $1,200; with this exception there has been for years no increase either in compensation or in the number of employees. The salaries range from $1,000 to $2,400; in a total force of 19 men the average salary is $1,621. Two of these men have been appointed recently. The remainder have served in the Bureau for periods ranging from 9 to 60 years. The anrage length of service is 22 years. The man who has served only 9 years receives $1,000 per annum. He is a skilled engraver, thoroughly competent, who during all that p~riod has never been denied a promotion to an existing vacancy. He has gone ahead, in his regular order, from an entrance salary of $504 per annum to his present salary of $1,000. Why, it will be asked, do men stay in positions which pay such inadequate salaries? The answer is tlmt copperplate map engraving is a distinct profession practically limited in this country to this and one or two other Government bureaus. If they resign here, they must start in at the bottom in some other department where advancement is also slow, and where they lose the credit for their previous years of service. There is no field for them in commercial life, so if they seek work outside it must be along other lines, and this does not appeal to them. Engraving is an art, not a trade, and the man who becomes a skilled engraver must have something of the temperament which compensates the artist for the sacrifices he often endures while he is painting his masterpiece. Yet the very fact that this work is so highly specialized affords the strongest argument for according the men such justice that they will not be tempted to resign. If one of these men should go, it would take years to replace him. There is no outside source of supply ot men having the required skill. They must be trained withm the Bureau, and it requires a period of years before the apprentice be-

eomes sufficiently skilled in all details to be intrusted with the production of a new chart. In contrast with this salary scale it is interesting to note that in effect in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. That bureau employs 32 engravers, whose salaries range :from $1,500 to $7,500 per annum. The average salary o:f the 32 positions is $3,003, or almost <louble that o:f the engravers in this Bureau. The calibers o:f the men required by the two bureaus f!,re :fairly comparable, since any possible difference in artistic qualities of the work is fully compensated for by the mathematical accuracy required o:f the map engravers. Not only should the salaries of the engravers be raised, but the number o:f employees in the section should be increased. The work which the section is called upon to do has increased materially in recent years. In 1901 the number o:f charts issued to the public was 64,496; in the fiscal {ear 1919 it was 290,537. During the same period the amount o original data received by the Bureau to be utilized in the production of new charts or the correction of existing ones increased over 150 per cent. Yet during that same period the force of engravers increased only :from 17 in 1901 to 19 m 1919. This ever-growing discrepancy between public demand and available data on the one hand, and available force on the other, has been one o:f the :factors responsible for the long delays in :furnishing to the public the results of new surveys m the :form of modern and correct charts, and even, in some cases, :for the inabilitv of the Bureau to utilize at all the data received. · This increase in :force need not be proportional to the increased demand upon the Bureau, as indicated by the above comparison. Increases in a much smaller ratio will be entirely adequate. Also, the increase should he made gradually, as the sootion can not afford to reduce the time devoted to chart production as would be necessary i:f it attempted to train any considerable number of inexperienced men at one time. Next year the force should be increased by at least three men, and :further increases should be postponed nntii'the tmining of these three is well under way.
CLERKS.

The salaries paid clerks in the Coast and Geodetic Survey are below the average in the Government service. During the fiscal year for which this report is made, the average pav :for clerks in the Coast and Geodetic Survey was lower than the average pay for clerks in the Department of Commerce or any bureau thereof. The average pay for clerks in the Department of Commerce as a whole for the fiscal year 1919 was $1,211.60, and the average pay in the Coast and Geodetic Survey :for clerks was $1,130.24. Durmg the fiscal year :for which this report is made, the entrance salary for clerks in this Bureau has been $720 per annum. The lower House o:f Congress has recognized the necessity o:f a general increase in all the lower Paid positions in the Federal service, so that no employee above 18 Y~ars of ~ge, whether laborer, messenger, watchman, or charwoman, Will receive less than $1,080 per annum. These are the provisions of the Nolan bill, which has passed the lower House. I:f, then, em-

14

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

ployees such as messengers, laborers, etc., performing duties that req_uirc no training or education to establish their fitness for the position held are to receive $1,080 per annum, surely it is proper that the entrance salary of a clerk who must spend time and money to fit himself to perform his duties should be more than $1,080 per annum. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is a technical bureau, and the scientific nature of the work of the Bureau permeates all its branches. It requires a much higher grade of intelligence, and closer application for a clerk to perform his duties satisfactorilv where the duties of the branch to which he is assigned are different' from those of any other branch of the Burpau, and "\Yhcre he is thrown on his own initiative, than where the work is largely rontinP. and where a number are performing the same duties, and the derical personnel is readily interchangeable, as is the case in many other branches of the Government service. In those branches, numbers of clerks are performing the same class of work and under the immediate supervision of directors, but in the Coast and Geodetic Survey the clPrk must be put on his own rPsources as to his accomplishment. In proof of the statement that the clerical employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey have average, or higher than average, ability the statement needs only to be -made that, during the fiscal year, 6& clerks left the Coast and Geodetic Snney, many to higher-paid positions in other branches of the Government service, while it never occurs that a clerk comes to the Coast and Geodetic Survey at a higher salary than he received in another branch of the Government service. Instance after instance can be cited where clerks leave the Coast and Geodetic Survey for higher salaries. One employee served as a clerk in this Bureau at $720 per annum from Febrnary 26 to May 22, 1918, and was replaced by another employee at $720· per annum because she had not the requisite training to handle the work in this Bureau. Immediately afterwards she obtained employment as a clerk in the Treasury Department, and is now employed in that capacity in that department permanently at a salary between $1,300 and $1,400 per annum. Here is a case of a clerk who had not the ability to perform the duties required i~ this Bureau, unrl. yet she went to another department and was prwl a salary that could be gained only after years of service in the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Another clerk entered the Coast and Geodetic Survey December 18, 1912, and served until January 5, 1918, by which time 'he had been promoted .to $1,200 per annum. He was then draf.ted into the ~rrny. On his discharge from the Army he sought remstatement m the Coast and Geodetic Survey, but the only vacancy then existing was one at $900 per annum. This he refused to accept, and sought employment elsewhere. He is now employed as a clerk in the B1~reau of War Risk Insurance at a salary of $1,400 per annum. Here is an instance of a clerk enterin,q another branch of the Gover~men~ service as a clerk at a much higher salary tha_n he had attam~d m, the Coast and Geodetic Survey after nearly six years of service. The clerks now receiving salaries of $1,200 per annum in the Coast and Geodetic Survey have served an average of 12 years. Many other parallel cases could be cited, as there h~s been instan<?C after instance of transfers from the Coast and Geodetic Survey cler1-

cal roll to higher-paid positions in other branches of the Government service. Long before the end of the war and before the demand for clerical help had become acute, there hail been many tempting offers to clerks in this Bureau to transfer to oth<>r positions and other branches of the Government service at much increase in salary, and during the yress of the war the opportunities were without number. A clerica employee in the Coast and Geodetic Survey is under some di~advantage. It is a specialized c]ass of work. In nearly every instance, no matter how proficient the clerk becomes in performing his duties in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, he does not acquire skill and know ledge that he can use in other walks in life. He is taken out of the channels of ordinary activity, and his acquirements in the Coast and Geodetic Survey generally are marketable nowhere else. For example, no matter how proficient a clerk may become in the tidal or magnetic divisions, the knowledge and skill required are of use in only the respective branches of this one service. Even the correction of our nautical charts requires extreme accuracy and considerable dexterity, and yet there are very, very few places outside of the Coast and Geodetic Survey where knowledge and skill thus gained can be put to account. Even the auditing of the accounts of our field parties requires special knowledge of the methods of this Bureau, and a very specific knowledge of the Comptroller's decisions respecting the expenditure of Government funds. In whatever division or section of the Coast and Geodetic Survey a clerk is employed he is useful largely because of his knowledge of the procedure in carrying out the tedmical work of the Bureau. It, therefore, follows that the longer a clerk of average intelligence is employed in the Bureau the more value he is to the Bureau, and the less ab]e to use this knowledge elsewhere. The results of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are necessary for the welfare of the Nation. Somebody must carry on the work of the Bureau, and it is only proper and just that those who do it should be properly rewarded for their services. If they are not, the achievements of the Bnrcan snffer, either through the incompetence of those who are willing to remain at the inadequate salary, or through the continual turnover of clerical employees through a succession of persons being appointed to the same position, and leaving either because better opportunities are offered elsewhere, or because they have not the ability to perform the technical duties of the position they seek to fill.
INSTRUMENT MAKERS.

In my 1918 annual report I summed up the situation in this lforeau with respeet to the low entrance salary for instrument makers. The salaries that we were able to offer in normal times Were not sufficient to attract men of the proper qualifications to make and repair our delicate and intricate surveying instrnments. The men that do this work must be of a much higher class of attainment than are usually found in a quality-:prodnction instrument shop of even manufacturers of surveying mstruments. Men in shops are generally skilled in only the production in numbers of special parts of a given instrument. Our instrument makers must

16

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

be able to make parts and repairs to any of the delicate surveying instruments that we use, and with the highest degree of precision, because an inaccuracy in an instrument would bring inaccuracy in results from surveys made with it. While the range of salaries that we were able to offer instrument makers in this Bureau during normal times was below the average, under present conditions, when wages and salaries have advanced so materially, the salaries in our lower grades have no attraction whatsoever for men who are in the least qualified to adjust, repair, and make our delicate instruments. What we should have is a range of salaries that would not only invite men of the proper technical qualifications to come to us, but which would hold out prospects of advancement that would assure their remaining with the Bureau. We never get men of these qualifications. They are attracted to other shops, where the pay and opportunity are on a parity with their training and ability. And, yet, these are the men that we need. With a corps of such men instruments would be perfected that would far more than offset the additional wage scale that would be required to accomplish it. To attract men of this caliber would require an entrance salary of $1,600 or $1,800 per annum. I am reliably informed that these are the entrance salaries prevailing to-day in many branches of the Government service and many of the more technical industrial plants. In our relatively very low entrance salary of $1,200 per annum the positions are usually vacant because we can not induce suitable men to accept them or they are filled by temporary employees who can under no. circumstances ciualify for permanent appointment, but whose services can be used to some purpose, though sometimes they are of questionable advantage. Some of these authorized positions have been vacant for monehs at a time. The chief of this important section is a mechanical engineer of rare skill and ability who receives the low salary of $2,75JJ. I doubt if anyone near his caliber could be secured for more than twice what is provided by law. Regardless of the individual, the position justifies a salary of $3,600.
NEED 01'' MODERN BUILDING.

The quarters occupied by this Bureau are a disgrace pure and simple. Insanitary and responsible for a clear loss of efficiency, I doubt if any other arm of the Government has to put up with such quarters. Easily remedied at a comr.aratively small cost, yet year after year appeals go for naught, while other bureaus enjoy modern and expensive buildings. Year after year I have called attention to. the need of a modern and adequate building to house this Bureau m place of the present makeshifts. We never can do efficient work in a building or buildings so unsuitable for our needs. It is physically impossible to bring together under proper supervision the different units of our organization. Where artisans, laborers, and employees of all kinds are scattered here and there in small rooms, under insanitary conditions, without proper light and proper ventilation, the best of results can not and ought not to be expected. So acute did this become during

the war, and so essential was the product of this Bureau to the successful pros~cution of the w~r, that on your presentation of our. nee~s to the President, he authorized the use of funds placed at lus disposal by Congress for the construction of a comparatively small building adjoining our present building to relieve the existing congestion. This building is now completed, and the facilities that it affords only emphasize the great drawback and handicap under which we are operating in our present old quarters. I think it proper for future reforence to n·cord here the kind of buildings we are now occupying and the history of their requirement. This Bureau occupies a red brick building on New Jersey Avenue, southeast of the Capitol Building; two adjoining granite buildings, with three small brick buildings in the rear; and a new, hollow-tile, fireproof building to the south, all of which are connected by bridges. The main or brick building was erected in 1871 by A. and T. A. Richards and in that year was rented for the use of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Previously, from August 2, 1832, the service had been quartered in a building on N cw J crscy A venue, south of the · present site, erected by Thomas Law about the year 1800, and a house adjoining to the north. The latter was used as quarters by the Superintendent, as was afterwards a portion of the main building, from 1871 nntil 1873. A small brick structure, with iron doors and windows, near the corner of New Jersey Avenue and C Street SE., was used £or storage of engraved plates and other valuable records and property of the service until 1874. The Richards Building, together with a small brick structure for the use of the electrotype section and carpenter shop, and the land adjoining, was purchased by the Government for the Treasury Department, September 21, 1891, for the sum of $155,000, the site fronting east 199 feet 6 inches on New Jersey Avenue, west 199 feet on South Capitol Street, and being about 200 feet deep. The legislation authorizing the purchase of this property is contained in an act of Congress approved March 3, 1891. Since 1871 the buildings have been continuously occupied by the Coast and qeodetic ~urvey. They are provided with steam heat from two horizontal b01lers, and are e«auipped with an electric freight elevator. The three granite buildings, of which two are occupied by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, were erected by Gen. Benjamin F. Butler in 1873-74 and were constructed of gramte from Cape Ann, Mass. The fireproof building adjoining the main building occupied by the Service, and which has been especially designed for its use, was Used for the storage of valuable records, original maps, engraved plates, and documents from June 8, 1874. . This whole property, including the middle buildin~ and that front1ng on B Rtrect, was purchased by the Government for the use of the Treasury Department, April 10, 18!H, from Benjamin F. Butler for the sum of $275,000, in pursuance of an act of Congress approved March 3, 1891. The land has a frontage of 119 feet a inches on B Street SE., 80 feet east on New .Jersey Avenue, and 97 feet west on South Capitol Street. That portion fronting on B Street is now Use!1 by the United States Public Health Service, to which it was ~ssigned by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1891. The two buildings to the south are u5ed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The

entire group of buildings is heated by steam from two horizontal boilers in the portion used by the Public Health Service. A brick structure to the rear, formerly a barn and annex, was also included with the property, and used by the Coast. and Geodetic Survey to house its chart-printing presses. In 1903 all of the above-described buildings then occupied by the Coast and Geodetic Survey were transferred with that Bureau to the then Department of Commerce and Labor, now Department of Commerce, in accordance with the act approved February 14, 1903, and with a provision contained in the deficiency act approved March 3, 1903. In the sundry civil act of August 1, Hl14, was appropriated $12,500 for an extension and rebuilding of the old brick building in the rear of the Butler Building for the use of the printing section of the Bureau, which had greatly overgrown the available space. By April 7, 1915, ~ one-story annex and a new. three-story building had been ere~te<l m the space between the Richards and Butler Buildings. Tlns filled a long-felt want, and greatly added to the facilities for printing charts. Under dates of March 8 and June 17, 1918, the approval and authorization of the President ·were contained in allotments of $75,000 and $30,000, respectively, a total sum of $105,000, for providing the needed facilities for work of preparing charts, military maps, and other special work for the Army and Navy by the construction of a suitable building for this purpose. On September 18, 1918, an additional allotment 0£ $29,250 was made for the purpose of equipping the new building. The allotments were made from the funds appropriated by Congress, and placed at the disposal of the President for national security and defense during the period of the war with Germany and Austria. On June 28, the date of the apprornl of tlie bond incident to the construction of this building, the contract was awarded to Wills, Egelhof & Co., 161 Park Avenue, New York City, for the total amount of $94,860, and work was commenced upon the same date. The contract time for the completion 0£ the work was six months from the date of acceptance, which expired on December 28, 1918, but at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1919, the building was not ready for occupation. It was so nearly completed, however, that it was available Roon after that date. The building was erected upo.n the vac.ant lot to the :south of the Richards Building, and oecuprnc~ prac:t1cally. the enti_re lot with sufficient space all around for securmg smtable light. It IS of hollowtile construction two stories in height, the upper for the use of the drafting section, and the lower for the instrument section, including machine and carpenter shops.
DESCRIPTIONS OF BUILDINGS.

Richards Buildiln,,q.-The Richards Building consists of two parts, known as the front and back buildings, and these are connected by comparatively narrow passageways on each floor. The front building consists of .six floors which, reckoni~g from the bo~tom, are occupied, respectively, by (1) part of the mstrument sect10n; (2) the

The hack Richards Building consists of five floors and a basement, but on the eastern end of the roof a structure has lwcn built to provide a room for photographic printing. The floors of this building are oceupicd, respectively, by (1) boiler room and storage rooms in the basement; ( 2) instrument machine shop and instrument storeroom; ( 3) the safos section; ( 4) the office of the chief of the division of charts and the main part of the drawing seetion; ( 5) the office of the Rupcrintendent and the main part of the division of hydrography and topography; (G)parts of the drawing nnd engraving sect.ions;. and (7) photographic printing room. · Each floor of the hack lrnilding is a half floor lmwr than the corresponding floor of the front building. Butler BuiMinr;.-The ButlPr Building was originally three separate and di,,tinet lmil<lings. The corner one is now occupied by the Public Health Service, and the other two by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Those oecnpicd h:v the Coast and Geodetic Survey are designated for connnicnce as the archives building and the library building, and they haYe communicating bridges on the first and third floors only. The IlutlN· and Hichards Buildings arc also connected by bridges on the first and third floors. The first floors are on the sam~ levPl, hut the third floor of the Butler Building is nhont 2 frpt l11glwr than the co1Tespondirl0' floor of the Richards Duil<ling. ,.., The arehiws building, with the pxception of the third floor arnl basement, is used for th(. archives, the third floor being occupied by part of the engraving section, and the basement for the storing of proper engraving plates, aud other miscellaneous material. The library lrnilding is occupied as folJows: The basement, which i.s in two levels about 21 feet apart, is used for the storage of aluminum plates and general storage: the first story is occupied h:v the library and reading room; tlH\ front of tlw second floor is nscd by field officers when on dutv in Washington, and thc rear by the miscellaneous se>ction; the third floor by the diYisi.on of terrestrial magnetism; and the fourt_h floor by field. office>rs while temporarily assigned for duty at W ashmgton.

HEAT AND LIGHT.

As has been mentioned in this report heretofore, the buildings occupied by this Bureau are heated by steam heat from four horizontal boilers, two of these boilers beiug located in the baserrient of the buildings occupied by the Public Health Service and two in the basement of the Richards Building. While one set of these boilers is located in the basement of the building occupied by the Public Health Service and provides heat for the building occupied by that bureau and part of the building occupied by this Bureau, firemen and stokers sufficient to operate both the boilers located in the basement of the building occupie<l by the Public Health Service and those in the basenwnt of the buil<ling occupied by this Bureau are supplied and their services are paid for out of the appropriations for this Bureau. The coal consumed in the boilers in the basement of the building occupied by the Public Health Service is provided by that bureau and the coal consumed by the boilers in the basement of the building occupied by this Bureau is provided out of our appropriations. . . . As an emergency measure during the Spamsh-Amer1can War a copper cable line for supplying electric current was run between the Capitol and the building occupied by this Bureau. This line supplied direct current. In view of the fact that a considerable amount of photographic work was done by this Bureau for the office of the Ruperintendent of the Capitol Building and Grounds during the Spanish-American War, and after that war terminated, a certain amount of electric current continued to be supplied from the Capitol· over the lines that had been installed during the war. Out o:f this

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

21

grew the fact that maehinery and equipment were installed and operutecl by electric gC'nerators provided with motors for direct current. Electnc current not used for operating machinery, but for electric lights, etc., was obtained by purchase from the Potomac Eleetric Light & Power Co. After the Spanish-American War had ceased, hnd the activities of this Bureau had so broadened that the.amount of direct current that we were consuming and which was supplied from the Capitol Building was out of proportion to the photographic work and blue printing we were doing for the Superintendent 0 £ the Capitol ~uilding and Grounds, and there was strictly no authority for supplymg the current except as an emergeney war measure, steps were taken to discontinue its use from that source and purchase nll of the current needed by this BurC'au from the Potomac Electric Light & PowC'r Co. lnnsmnch as it has thus come about that our electric equipment was suited for operation by direct eurrent, and the Potomac Electric Light & Power Co. had theretofore been supplying the alternating current, negotiations were taken up with that company with the end in view of having the direct current supplied to this Bureau. The outcome of these negotiations was that the Potomac Electric Light & Power Co. was not able to run mains for supplying the direct current to this Bureau, and the only alternative was that either the machinery that was in operation in this Bureau to be run by direct current should be discarded and replaced by machinery to be run by the alternating current, or that a converter should be installed in the basement of this Bureau. After a thorough investigation it was determined that it would be more economical to install a dynamo for converting the alternating current supplied by the commercial power company into direct current than to discard the machinery operated by motors for direct current which were then in use. Such a dynamo was installed and is now in operation. I have given this matter rnueh thought, and it is obvious that tlwrn is no legal authority as the law now stnn<ls for supplying citlwr heat or light by any other means than those employed at present. The fact remains, however, that a supply main for steam from tlw Capitol power plant passes directly through the buildings occupied bv this Bureau, and that a dyn1lmo for alternating current supplied· from the central power plant is in op~f'ation in the basemC'nt 0£ the Ho11~e Office Building directly acJV:c.:> New ,Jerse:y Avenue from this Bureau. To the casual obsc:ver who is unacquamted with the legal limitntions which prohibit our utilizing these sources of supply it is an apparent extravagance for us to purchase out of Ollr appropriations from a commercial electric company, which purchase necessarily includes a profit to that company, the elec·tric current 11sed by this Bureau and to employ a force of dynamo tenders throughout a 24honr day (three shifts of 8 hours each), to purchase coal, and hire firemen and stokers for operating onr heating plant, when both light and heat can he supplied and are immediately availah'le from a <·cntral power and heat plant maintainecl by the Oovernnwnt. ·while stati8tics are not available for determining the exact cost by a 11nit of measure of electric light and heat by the Capitol power and heating plant, based on the best available 80urces of information, I believe it is fair to say that the actual saving to the GovernmcnL if it

22

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

were supplied from the Capitol power and heating plant, would be approximately $4,000 per annum. The most practical solution of the legal difficulty of supplying light and heat from this plant for the Coast and Geodetic Survey appears to me to be to have legislation effected authorizing that heat and light shall be supplied this Bureau from the Capitol power and heating plant, the amount to be determined as supplied by a unit of measure and paid for out of the appropriations for this Bureau. Practical experience has demonstrated the economy of supplying h~at and lig~t from a central producing plant rather than from many small nmts, and certainly very considerable economy would result frorn such a procedure if authorized.
ROTATION OF J<'UNDS RECEIVED PROM '.rlU} SALE 01<' NAUTICAL CHARTS.

The present law provides that the charts published by this Bureau shall be sold at the cost of paper and printing as nearly as practicable. The funds that are expended in the purchase of ('hart paper, printer's ink, ete., are contained in the annual appropriations for this Bureau in the sundry civil bill under the subheading of "Office expenses." The appropriation under this subheading for the fiscal year for which this report is written was $80,000. Besides chart paper and printer's ink, out of this appropriation must be paid every expenditure incident to the maintenance of the headquarters of this Bureau at Washington, D. C., including the purchase of instruments for field work. Because of the varying costs of materials, etc., it is extremely difficult to make estimates with any degree of accuracy from year to year to meet the expenditures under this suhitem in our appropriations. If prices ~d".anc~ ma~erially, as they have in the past few years, the appropnat10n is entirely exhausted some months before the close of the fiscal year for which it is made. This results in ·a material deduction in ~nr output. To overcome this difficulty in a measure I have this recommendation to make: That as our charts are sold the funds received from the sale thereof shall be placed to the credit of this Bureau in the Treasury to be again drawn upon for the purchase of chart paper, ink, etc. The advantage that would result would be that, if the sale of our charts is fluctuating, the re.ceipts will fluctuate a~cordingly, and a fund always be maiI~ taine<l for the product10n of chart'>, and we will not need to curtail ()Ur output because the appropriation has not been sufficient to meet .our need for a given fiscal year. Heretofore w~ have frequently been ·compelled to submit deficiency estimates. on this account, and tl~e delay incident to pfacing funds at our ~1sl?osal through a deficiency estimate has at times prevented our prrntrng charts that are needed by the public.

CHAPTER II.
WORK OF THE WASHINGTON OFFICE.

The organization of the Washington office throughout the year by divisions and sections was, as in the previous year, with the exception that on April 1 the section of field records was transferred from the division of hydrography to the division of charts, and on May 1 the section of printing and sales was transferred from the division of h~d!~graphic and geodetic engineer in ?harge of the office to the d1v1s10n of charts. Therefore the orgamzation at the end of the fiscal year was as follows : Division of hydrographic and geodetic engineer in charge of the office: Section of instruments, section of library and archives, and section of miscellaneous. Division of geodesy. , D.ivision of hydrography and topography: Section of field work, sect~on of vessels and equipment, section of coast pilot, and section of titles and currents. D.ivisio:n- o:f charts: Section of field records, section of drafting1 sect10n of engraving, section of printing and sales, and section ot photography. Division of terrestrial magnetism. Division of accounts. The work done by the Washington office during the fiscal year, by divisions of the office, was as follows:
DIVISION OF IIYDROGRAPHIC AND GEODETIC ENGINEER IN CHARGE OF THE
Ol''FICE.

The general duties of this division are: The care and upkeep of the buildings occupied by the Bureau; the designing and repairing of surveying instruments and equipment, and packing and shipping them to the field parties; the purchase of supplies for the office.1 for chart printing work, and for the field ; the care and custody ot the original records of field surveys as well as the library of printed publications kept for the use of the Bureau; the keeping of the records of leave of absence taken by the personnel of the Bureau; the custody and accounting :for the receipts from the sales of charts and publications sold by the Bureau. It would be tedious and serve no good purpose for me to give the minute details in carrying out the ·duties of the division of the hydrographic and geodetic engineer in charge of the office generally outlined above. It is sufficient for me to say that the work was done efficiently and satisfactorily, and I shall make mention only o:f some of the more important items and accomplishments.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The most important of thesp towanl establishing facilities for the work.of the BnrC'all during the year was the erection of the new building known as the chart. instrument. and archives building. This has supplied a long-felt want in furnishing a modern, thoroughly equipped machine shop, carpenter shop, and drafting room. The emergency requirements of the war threw a great burden upon the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Demands were made upon us for charts in l).nprecedented numbers by the. Navy Department and by the Shipping Board. The war had not been long in progress before the demand for delicate instruments both on vessels· of the Navy and for use in the Army became acute. In conjunction with the Bureau of Standards some of the most delicate navigational instruments used on board our vessels were designed. Th~s brought about the need of more room for draftsmen and for mstrument makers in this Bureau. On my presentation of these facts to you, you in turn brought them to the attention of the President, and nncler date of March 8 and June 17, 1918, he authorized allotments o-f $75,000 and $30,000, respectively, a total sum of $105,000, :for providing needed facilities for the work of preparing charts_, military maps, and other special work for the Army and Navy by the erection of a suitable building for that purpose. On September 18, 1918, an additional allotment 0£ $29,250 was tnade for the purpose of equipping the b11ilding. These allotments were made from funds appropriated by Congress and placed at the disposal of the President for the national security and defense during the period of the war with Germany and Austria. Another great improvement was the installation of a Harris offset automatic printing prefls, with a capacity of printing chartc;; 34 by 48 inches at the rate of 3,500 per hour. This press, too, was purchased through an allotment of $14,000 made for the purpose by the President from the funds placed at his dispm;al by Congress for national security and defense during the war with Germany and Austria. At the time the allotment was made the Burereu was largely engaged in the printing. of navigational charts absolutely necessar.y for the use of the Army and Navy, and realizing the resulting disaster in case of a breakdown of one of the other presses the purchase of this additional press was authorized. On our representation to Congrefls of th~ great necessity funds were appropriated to the extent of $1,500 in the sundry civil act approved ,July 1, 1918, for the purchase of two motor-driven lathes for th~ instri1ment section of this Bureau. These have been purchased and installed, and by their use the work will be greatly facilitated. A hot-water-storage svstem was installe<l in the boiler room of the Richards Building. ·This has made it po~sible to diflpense "'lth the two small, inefficient water heaters, one m the hallway of the Richards Building and one in the printing building, which had formerly been in use. The result is that we have an economical hot-water system which supplies hot water throughout all of the buildings. The cost was $1,625. A new concrete floor was put into the dressing room of the printing- building at a cost of $545. The floors in rooms 343, 347, 462, and 406, and a portion of the pressroom floor in the printing building, were covered with linoleum at a cost of $438.75.

A vestibule door was installe~ at the main entrance to the Richards Building at a cost of $230. The official records kept by the hydrographic and geodetic engineer in charge of the office show that the total numbel' of permanent and temporary employees in the office and field, which included all employees appointed through civil-service eertification, were as follows:
Office force --------------------------------------------------------Flel<1 force ----------------------------------------------- ______ ____ Total --------------------------------------------------------229 427

218

The above is in refel'.ence to classified employees. Persons employed in rodding, as chainmen, recorde'rs, and heliotropers in the field parties, and enlisted men on vessels in the service are not enumerated, as the number is variable, depending upon the extent of activities in the field. · The statistics in regard to leaves of absence during the calendar year 1918 are as follows:
DayR.

Annual leave ------------------------------------------------------- 6, 927 Sick leave--··------------------------------------------------------- 2,429 Leave without pay ----------------------------··--------------------- 1, 178 Accrued leave ----------------------------------------------------- 1,062 . W~ile the number of employees naturally varies on account ?f res-

1gnat10ns and vacancies, calculated on the number actually m the service on June 30, 1919, as a basis of computation, the average annual lt;ave taken during the year by each employee was 19 day8 and the stck. leave days. · Based on the o6ie1al day of seven hours, the overtime performed by the employees of. the o:ftice during the .fiscal year amounted to 1,021 days or approximately 5 days for each employee. The receipts from the sale of charts, publications, old property, etc., amounted to $25,466.65.

DIVISION 01·' HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY.

The division of hydrography and topography has supervision of all hydrographic and topographic surveys executed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which supervision includes the determination of wlwre surveys or resurveys are required, how they shall be conducted, the preparation of instructions for the surveying parties, the organization of the parties, and the inspection of the field work and examination of the field records that result from these survcvs. This division is also charged with the construction, maintenance, and repairs of vessels and other field equipment, except instruments; the compilation of the coast pilot in the field and office; the observations of tides and currents; and compilation of tide tables. For administrative purposes the division is divided into four sections, known as the section of field work, section of vessels and equipment, section of coast pilot, and section of tides and currents. This division is also charged with the supPrvision of the five field stations of the Bureau. These stations are located at the following cities: Boston, Mass.; New York, N. Y.; New Orleans, La.; Seattle, Wash.; and San Francisco, ·Calif. Under the direction of this division there is also an office at Manila, P. I. The Manila office performs all of the functions of a field station and, in addition, has direct charge of all surveys in the Philippine Islands and much of the office work incident to these surveys. Data were collected nnd itemized mC>moranda prepared for 23 sets of instructions for field work. This pmbraced a careful study of existing surveys. Original fiC>ld sheets covering nreas where cha"nges frequently occur, and where preliminary surveys only have been made were reviewed in order to formulate plans 'for performing the necessary field work to bring the charts up to date. Completed field sheets were reviewed, as time permitted, preparatory to recommending them for the approval of the Superintendent. During the year a coast pilot <:>:f the Philippi~e Islands was prepared. Also, reprints wc;re obtamed ?:f co~st pilots as well as for three volumes of coast pilots for Cahforma, Oregon, Washington, and one volume for Alaska. The manuscript for the tide tables for 1920 was prepared and submitted for printing in three separate parts, namely, the Atlantic Coast Tide Tables, the Pacific Coast Tide Tables, and that part of the General Tide Tables which is not included in either of the two reprints. These tables are similar to those issued by the Bureau for the past two or three years.
DIVISION OF CHARTS.

A fairly large proportion of·the time o:f the chart division during approximately the first half of the fiscal year was devoted to war work. Charts, photographic enlargement, and reductions of charts

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

27

and original surveys were furnished, projections made for laying · ·out i·trnges, etc., drawing and photographic work for compass roses were made for the Navy. and a drawing water-colored and photographed for an aircraft flag for the Signal Corps. In addition to the above war work mentioned in general terms, the regnlar duties of the division accomplished were as follows: Drawings \Vere finished for 7 new and 7 old charts, making 14 (:omplete chart drawings. Ninety-one drawings of extensive chart corrections and 438 drawings for minor chart corrections were made. One thousUcnd five hundred and eighteen changes to the aids to navigation, including dangers, were charted and inserted in the standards filed for the printing and sales section for hand correction. 'l'wo thousand four hundred and fifty-six proofs of charts were verifird that were receiwcl for correction before reprinting. Drawings for n<'W charts or extensive corrections of Philippine Island charts, received from Manila, were prepared for printing. Forty-two hydrographic sheets were completed in this section before this work was taken over bv the field record section. In cooperation with the Bureau of Lighthouse~ weekly Notices to Marin<'rs "'ere prepared and publislwd. A large number of miscellaneons drawings, including illustrations for the annual report of the Bnrean. puhlieations of this and other bureaus of the GoYernment, projPctions for field parties, Ptc., were made. Approximately 50 platrs in addition to 1ww editions and bassos were corrrrted so thnt a transfor rould be made for the new offset press. These corrections not only involved the necessary changes from recent data, but also included the eoIT<'Ctions mad<' bv tlrn lithographers on. all new prints su!Jsequent to the time of the.last transfer. Sonwhme~ tlwse corrections for a single plate were scattered throngh a fornrnlable amount of proof. It is evident that a printing plate brouO'ht np to elate in this manner without error required close cooperatio~ of the diffrrrnt sPctions and expert proof reading. In Yiew of the rrclucC>d clrafting force, every pffort has lwen madP by the engraving sC>ction to relieve the draftsmen of some particular portion of the work heretofore done by them. At the present time a plate for Marsh. from which the symbol will be applied direct to the printing plate, is being engraved as an experiment and for eliminating handwork on drawings. Several new charts which haw been finished during the year or are still in hand, instead of being engraved from a drawing compiled by the draftsmen, have bC>en engraved from transfer of negatives of reduced photographs of largrr sea le charts or transferred from a printing plate of th<' same scale. Also proofs which were formerly verified in th<' drafting section have been verified by engravers, so that only the final proofs have been Yerified by the draftsmen. Barring 1917, when the then new lithographs were printed for the most part in black and white only, the number of charts printed was the largest in the history of the Bureau. Issue anq condemnation has passed the 300,000 mark. The increase over 1918 was 28 per cent. It was 136 per cent greater than for the year 1915. The United States Shipping Board is becoming a real factor, having used 21,707 charts in 1919, as compared. with 10,657 in 1918.

The graphic diagrams opposite show the issue of charts from 1888. to 1919, inclusive, and the issue of coast pilots for the same period.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The war work of the division was confined to the supplying of magnetic data to various Army camps and organizations, and to persons engaged on investigation of the submarine problem. The results of the field work executed during 1918 were computed and prepared for publication. The reduction of the work of the five magnetic observatories for 1917 was practically completed, and that for 1918 was well advanced. Further progress wns made in the reduction of the work of the San Antonio Observatory, 1890-1895. The earthquakes recorded at the five magnetic observatories have Leen tabulated monthly, and the results have been published in the .Monthly Weather Bureau Review, and transmitted to the International Seismological Association and others engaged in a comparative study of earthquake data. ·The results of magnetic observations in Alaska to the end of 1918. were tabulated, the secular change data were collected, and tables prepared for reducing the results to 1920; this reduction was made, and preliminary isogonic lines were drawn for that epoch. · The results of observations made at the time of the solar eclipse· of June 8, 1918, were prepared for publication in the Journal of Terrestrial Magnetism. Data concerning preliminary impulses of 17 selected magnetic storms were prepared for De Moidrey, including tracings of portions of the magnetograms from the Cheltenham, Tucson, Honolulu, and Sitka observatories. A paper on the relation between seismic and magnetic disturbances was prepared for publication in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America at the request of the editor. A table giving the values of the magnetic declination at numerous places in the United States for 1920 was prepared for insertion in the 'Vorld Almanac. . A new edition of Principal Facts of the Earth's Magnetism was submitted for publication, the supply of the last edition being very nearly exhausted. Compass data were snpplied for 126 charts.

Be.sides the new charts above listed, 66 new editions of charts were issued. some of which embody important corrections, additions, and new information. While the foregoing is a complete list 0£ the publications issued by this Bureau during the fiscal year, publications on two subjects have been issued by this Bureau that arc of special importance. One of these is the series of publications on the Lambert Conformal Conic Projeetion. The principal 0£ the Lambert projection is, in a measure, graphically illustrated in the figure opposite. Many methods of projection have been desi,L,l'Jled to solve the difficult problems of representing a spherical surface on a plane. As different projections have unquestionable merits, as well as equally serious defects. any region to be mapped should be made the subject of Rpecinl study. and that system of projection adopted which will give the best results for the area and purposes under consideration. The ~forcator projection. almost universally use<l for nautical charts, is responsible for many false impressions 0£ the relative size of countries differing in latitnde. The pol.vconic projection, widely used and well adapted for most topographic and hydrographic surveys, when used for the whole of the United States in one map, has the serious defert 0£ unduly pxaggerating the areas on its eastern and western limits. Alon~ the Pacific coast and in Maine the error in scale is as much does this projection attain its maximum error of 2;} per cent. The value o:f the n!:'w outline map on the new Lambert projection ean b~st be realized when it is stated that, throughout the larger and most important parts of the United Stnte&--thnt is, between latitudes 30,t 0 nrnl 4fl 0 -tlw rnaximnm scale error is only one-half of 1 per cent. 'l'his amount of scale error of one-half of 1 per cent is frequentlv less than the distortion <lue to the victhod of printing and to changes in the humidity of the air. Only in southernmost Florida and Texas does this projection attain its maximum error of :2! per cent. The Lambert projection is well adapted to large areas of predominating east and west tlimensions, as the United States, wlwre the distancP across from c·nst to west is one and fonr-fifths times that 0£ the distance north and south. The strength of the polyconi<' projection. on the other hand, is along its central meridian. The nwrit and defods of the two systems of projection may be stated in a grncral way as being at right angles with caeh oth!:'r. Speeial f~atures 0£ the Lambert projl'ction that are not found in the polycomc rnay Le stakd briefly as follows: 1. The Lambl'!'t projection is conformal; tlrnt is, all angles between intersecting lines or curves are preserved, and for any point (or restricted lrcality) the ratio of the lPngth of a linear element on the earth's snrface to the length on the corresponding map element is constant for all azimuths or directions in which the element may be taken. · 2. The meridians are strai~ht lines and the parallt>ls arp concentric circles.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

3. It has two axes of strength instead of one, the standard parallels of the map of the United States being latitude 33° and 45°, and upon these parallels the scale is absolutely true. The scale for any other part of the map, or any parallel, can be obtained from tables contained in one of this series of publications. By means of these tables the very small seale errors in this projection can be entirely eliminated. The other of these publications is the Report on the Connection of the Ares of Primary Triangulation Along the Ninety-Eighth Meridian in the United States and in Mexico, and on Triangulation in Southern Texas. An event of great importance in the history of geodesy was l onsummated in the spring of 1916, when observations were made at stations on the northern and southern banks of the Rio Grande,- which rnnnected the arcs of primary triangulation which had been established in the United States and in Mexico along the ninety-eighth meridian. The connection is interesting to the geodesist, because it makes available a very long meridional arc of conne: ted and completed triangulation. This <'onnection will make available data from which to compute with greater at curacy 'than heretofore the dimensions of the earth. This will in itself make the work a notable contribution to science. But of even greater moment is the fact that the connection of the trian~ulation of the United States and Mexico will enable the latter country to extend to new areas from the ninety-eighth meridian arc geodetic C'Ontrol for surveys and maps in the form of triangulation which can be made on the North American datum. This datum had been called the United States standard datum previous to the year 1913, when it was also adopted by Mexico and Canada for their geodetic coordinates. Its designation was changed to the North American datum when it had thus attained an international character.

Part II.-FIELD WORK AND NEEDS OF THE FIELD SERVICE.
CHAPTER I.
STATEMENT OF NEEDS OF THE BUREAU TO BETTER ACCOMPLISH ITS FIELD WORK.
SURVEYING VESSELS.

Again my apl?eal that .the failu~ to. provi~e mod~rn ve~sels for our hydr9graph1c work is prolongmg mefficiency, mcreasmg cost for what is being produced, and, worst of all, the delay in protecting our waters against loss of life and property. The end of the fiscal year finds us with a fleet of 15 vessels, a truly considerable number based on a comparison with those available in previous years, and probably more than has ever been at the disposal of the Bureau at any one time in its history. The comparatively large number of vessels at our command at the present time is due to the fact that 5 vessels have been transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey from the Navy Department U;nder authority of the Executive order of May 24, 1919. These 5 were part of a number of vessels that the Navy Department found on its hands at the close of the war with Germany, and which had been acquired to meet the temporary naval need for patrol boats, etc. But, with our fleet augmented as it is by these additions from the Navy Department, we have not at all a satisfactory condition. While we have numbers, we have distinct inefficient units. When we learned that the Navy had spare vessels that were authorized to be transferred by the act of May 20, 1918, a board of Coast and Geodetic Survey officers was appointed by me to get in touch with the proper officials of the Navy Department and learn what vessels were available for transfer that were best suited for our needs. After a thorough examination of all the vessels that the Navy Department had available for transfer, the board recommended that we take over the 5 vessels from the Navy Department that have been named earlier in this report, and there are 2 other vessels of the Navy Department, probably, that will eventually come to us. These vessels were accepted, not because they were suited for our work, but because they are the best means to an end at the present time. I feel that we have a great responsibility in meeting the marine needs of this country in finding and charting the dangers to navigation. The need is so pressing that I believe that we are justified in doing what we can with these vessels from the Navy Department, thougli at a considerable excessive expenditure of overhead cost to accomplish the same results that would be brought about much more cheaply if we had vessels that a.re designed for our work.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

While the Navy had a great number and variety of vessels at the close of the war that could be transferred to other services, and without close reflection, it might be assumed that certainly out of these numbers vessels could be selected that would readily meet our ne~ds, and while the board I appointed canvassed the situation thoroughly, and made the best possible selection, the vessels we have thus acquired can not be efficiently operated as surveying vessels. The reasons are these : We can not economically carry on ship hydrogra phy with a. vessel that is too large, because she requires too large a complement of officers and men, nor can the work be done with safety with a vessel that is too small, because she can not live through the severe weather that will be met. Furthermore, the character of the area to be surveyed seldom permits clean-cut classification, so that it c11n be determined beforehand that such and such a portion of it will be done by vessel, and such and such a portion by launches. Therefore, greater progress is made, and more economically, if a vessel is equipped to carry launches on her deck, and when the field of operation is reached the launch hydrography (in waters too shallow for the vessel to operate) is done in con3unction with the ship hydrography. Thus the entire area is covered by the same J?arty during the same season. These combined operations are earned on much more cheaply than if undertaken separately. To meet this condition, a vessel must be large enough to carry three or four heavy launches on her deck. For these reasons our selection of vessels from those available had to be confined to those of a tonnage of 200 to 1,000 tons. The vessels of such tonnage of those available from the Navy Department were yachts. There are two classes of ship hydrography: Offshore, such as that off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, out to the 1,000-fathom curve; the other class is known as combined hydrography, such as that along the coast of Alaska, where there are many areas of which the deeper water hydrography must be done by a. vessel and the waters inshore by launches. The particular reasons why the yachts that we have ,obtained from the Navy Department are not suitable for either of these classes ~f hydrography are these: The offshore hydrography that must be done by ships along the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California out to the 1,000-fathom curve, extends a general average distance of 30 miles from shore. Along these coasts the harbors of refuge are few and :far between. Furthermore, the storms encountered within the area that must be surveyed are generally very severe. To buffet the storms that will surely be encountered, a stanch seagoing vessel is required. The yachts that we have acquired have neither the strength required of hull or machinery to stand the strain to which they would be subjected in these storms. Furthermore, if they were stanch enough for this outside work, they have not the fuel capacity to make it economical to operate them there. Too much time would have to be expended in running to the widely separated ports to obtain fuel supplies. This class of hydrography is done by running lines of soundings at right angles to the shore, to and from the shore, out to the 1,000-fathom curve. If a vessel only has fuel capacity to enable her to make but a few of these 50 or 60 mile trips from the shore out to the 1,000-fathom

curve and back to shore, and then must abandon her work, and steam some hundreds of miles to a port to obtain a fresh supply of fuel, it is readily seen that there is an enormous loss of time, and, ·consequently, a great overhead cost to carry on this class of surve~s with such a vessel. Vessels properly designed for this work are 011-burn~ ing, and have a cruising radius of several thousand miles. These are the reasons why these yachts are neither safe npr economical for executing offshore hydrography. · In respect to the combined operations-that is, areas where, for the sake of economy, the ship hydrography and the launch hydrography should be executed at the same time-there is this difficulty in l!-ndertaking it with the vessels that we have acquired from the Navy Department. The vessels that came to us from the Navy Department are yachts, and were used as patrol boats in searching for submarines. They are, therefore, built for speed, and along narrow lines. Consequently they have neither the deck room for the storage of launches, nor the stability to carry them. Neither have they the deck for installation of hoisting apparatus for hoisting the launch aboard the vessel. If the necessary three or four launches for use in combined operations were installed on the deck of one of these yachts, she would be so top-heavy that it would be hazardous to put to sea with her. Such a vessel would have to be at sea a considerable portion of the time effectively to carry on surveying operations. The impression has gotten abroad that there is no justification in our asking for appropriations for new vessels especially designed for the work of this Bureau, so long as there would be surplus vessels after the war, but such views are erroneous. A great public need would be more quickly met, and in the long run dollars that come from the J?Ublic treasury would be saved, if proper surveying vessels were provided for this Bureau. It costs practically as much in personnel, food, and supplies to operate an ineffident vessel as it does to operate an efficient one. As it is, we will make what progress we can at a very considerable loss of efficiency, in picking here and there sheltered waters where these vessels can be used, and equip the larger ones with as many launches as they will carry, probably not more than two, s,o that the vessel hydrography will progress more rapidly than the launch hydrography, and delays will be enforced in regions where combined vessel and launch hydrography are necessary. There is as much necessity for vessels of special design for making surveys as there is for use as tugs, ferries, lightships, and for freight or passenger vessels. The course that legislation has taken in respect to providing new surveying vessels for this Bureau has largely prompted us to make the experiment of transferring to this Bureau the spare vessels of the Navy Department, and undertaking to make surveys with them. In 16 years, or from 1903 to 1919, but one effective appropriation was made for vessels for the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and that was for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1916, when the sum of $289 000 was authorized for two new vessels, including their equipment. Throngh this apP.ropriation we procured two vessels, one especially designed and bmlt for a surveying vessel and the other was purchased. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1919, an appropriation was made in

36 . REPORT

OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

the following words, " for one new vessel, including equipment, to cost not exceeding $354;000, $50,0QO." On my submission to you, the question was presented to the Comptroller of the Treasury as to whether there was authority to enter into a contract for the construction of a vessel to cost not exceeding the limit mentioned. The Comptroller held that the legislation did not in specific terms declare that a contract could be executed in excess of the amount appropriated, and, therefore, such a contract would be in violation of the act of June 30, 1906, which provides that "no Act of Congress hereafter passed shall be construed to make an appropriation out of the Treasury of the United States or to authorize the execution of a contract involving the payment of money in excess of appropriations made by law, unless such act shall in specific terms declare an appropriation to be made or that a contract may be executed." Prior to the late war, under our system of finance, the greater part of the revenue of the Government was derived from the duties paid by our commerce, and the demand that a small portion of the immense wealth, which is thus annually poured into the Treasury, should, for a few years, be expended in protecting the lives and property of those thus contributing, is so plainly just as to need no argument in its support. Conditions have been so abnormal since 1914, and international trade has been so hampered that statistics since that time are not representative. The actual receipts from customs in the Treasury, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, were $312,509,946. For that same fiscal year the appropriations for making hydrographic surveys by the Coast and Geodetic Survey were $261,400, and no appropriation was made granting a vessel for this Bureau. We have not during the past years had the vessels and personnel to bring the surveys of om waters up to a proper standard. The charts of Alaskan waters are entirely incomplete, and the information shown on many of them is from exploration surveys by the Russians before Alaska was acquired by the United States, and with a lack of exactness that would not be tolerated at the ·present time. The charts of the waters of the three Pacific Coast States do not contain sufficient information for offshore navigation, and many of the charts of the Atlantic coast and Gulf coast of the United States are lacking in the same respect. This should be borne in mind, that heretofore the vessels that plied our waters have been largely of foreign registration, and therefore, losses on account of inadequate surveys have been borne to a considerable extent by other countries than ours, but that the war has brought about a great stimulation of shipbuilding in this country, so that our vessels have increased from 26,397 with a gross tonnage of 8 871,037 in 1917, to 27,217 with a gross tonnage of il,261,444 at the beginning of the year 1919. What is more significant still is that the increase of our merchant fleet has been, not in small shore-hugging craft, but ships of a size and type adapted to ocean service. While on July 30, 1914, just before the outbreak of the great war, our seagoing merchant ships of 1,000 gross tons or over numbered only 755, of 2,128,731 gross tons, these vessels of more than 1,000 gross tons numbered on June 30, 1918, no fewer than 2,058, of 7,300,022 gross tons, or a net gain of more than 5,000,000 tons in vessels capable of ocean navigation.

:REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND G110DETIC SURVEY.
WIRE-DRAG LAUNCHES.

37

In the sundry civil bill :for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1919, the sum of $62,500 was appropriated for wire-drag launches, including their equipment, for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Ont of this appropriation four 60-foot launches have been built and equipped and three 30-foot tenders. One 30-foot tender was purchased. While the8e launches have been fr1, commission but a very short time, they hm'e already demonstrated their effidency in carryimg on ou'l' wire-drag s1wi·eys. They are trim vessels with sufficient strength t() propel 'the wire drags, yet economical of fuel consumption. They are especially designed for this class of work, and, therefore, have the proper amount of space, and in right place for storing all the necessary equipment and implements for making wire-drag surveys. They are far superior to the weaker, lumbering fishing vessels that have been hired heretofore for pulling the wire drag. and which we have been forced to alter in order to install the.wire-drag equipment, reels, engine, etc. vVith this demonstrated efficiency and economy that has resnlted from the nse of these vessels especially designed for this work, there is the stronger reason that such vessels should be utilized for carrying on all our wire-drag surveys. The wire-drag vessels that have been built for us out of the appropriation for 1919 are sufficient to operate two wire-drag parties. There are four regions where the wire-drag survey only is capable of finding the hidden, underwater dangers to navigation, and these are all along the coast of New England, Long Island Sound down to the entrance to New York Harbor. In this region are found the glacial deposits of bowlders that have been left beneath the waters bordering the coast. The second general region is the coast of Florida from Palm Beach southward around the southern shores and up to the neighborhood of Cedar Keys. In these waters the coral reefs are the dangers to navigation. Some of these reefs are in the form of small islands, known locally as keys, while others are entirely submerged, and therefore hidden from sight where they are grave menaces to navigation. While coral reefs are characteristic of all these waters, the regions where wire-drag examinations are most urgently needed are in the vicinity' of Key West, and to the westward from there, and then northward through the channels that commercial vessels take in and out of the Gnlf from Mobile, New Orleans, etc. The third region where wire-drag surveys are required is in the coral-infested waters of the Porto Rican and Virgin Islands. The fourth general region where wire-drag surveys are required is along the coast, and through the passages of southeastern Alaska. The danger to be found here by the wire drag is the pinnacle rock which is found in the form of a narrow needle-like rock that extends from a very great depth to very near the surface of the ocean. Ordinary soundings with the lead and line are of little avail in finding these pinnacle rocks, and indeed, are often quite deceptive in that snch soundings show a very considerable depth, and give assurance of safety, while danger may be at hand. Instances are known where the pinnacle rocks come to within a very short distance of the surface of the water, while soundings showed depths of hundreds of feet in their immediate neighborhood. There is one

38

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

other small area where the wire drag should be used, though of no considerable extent. This is at the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal. Below is a summary of the wire-drag surveys yet to be made :

From this it follows that two wire-drag parties that can be operated with the modern wire-drag vessels that we now have at our command, and which were built out of the money appropriated for the purpose in the sundry civil bill for 1919, can accomplish only a fractional part of the wire-drag work that remains to be done. In the belief that the remegy should be applied where the danger is greatest, one of these parties is operating in Long Island Sound and the other off the coast of Maine. Wire-drag work can be effectively carried on in these waters from about the first of April until the close of November. Climatic conditions do not permit the work being carried on during the remainder of the year. We have seriously considered sending these launches to Florida waters for operations during the winter season, and while there would be some gain, there are corresponding losses th1J.t we think would more than offset the gain. The main reasons are these: It is a long and somewhat hazardous run for such small vessels from the coast of New England to the coast of Florida. The wear and tear on the engines in making this run twice a year would be very considerable, so much so, that it is believed that it would materially shorten the life of the launches. Past experience has demonstrated that it is economical to give the wire-drag apparatus a thorough overhauling after each season of operation, rather than to continue it in service until a break occurs, which halts the whole party for a considerable time to make a minor repair; and if the eqmpment is continued in operation too long the minor breaks are very frequent. Practical experience has taught that much more is gained to go into the field with first-class equipment, and work the party to the limit of endurance during the season, disband the party, and place the vessels and equipment under the charge of a drag master during the winter months, and hold him responsible for a thorough overhauling of the equipment. We have acquired from the Navy two fairly large power launches. While these have not been designed and built for wire-drag purposes, we believe that with some alteration they will fairly answer for this purpose. These will be used in Alaskan waters. The wire drag requires two power launches, one at each end of the drag. The launches that we have acquired from the Navy are larger than those that were built for us out of the appropriation for 1919. They are too large to be used both on the same drag. A very efficient drag would be formed by using one of these launches acquired from the Navy and one of the type of those that have been built for us out of the appro~riations for 1919. Therefore, what we really need are four additional 60-foot launches of the type of those built out of the

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY. ·

89

appropriation for 1919. Two of these in conjunction with the two launches which we have acquired from the Navy would make up two wire-drag parties for the Alaskan waters, and the other two would provide a wire-drag party for the coast of Florida. There is more wire-dra.g work than can be completed by the five wire-drag parties that would be thus provided within the lifetime of the launches.. That is to. say, that the period during which one of these launches can be operated in which the expense of maintenance and repair does not become too excessive is, probably, 10 years. After that time the upkeep would be excessive. The wire-drag work remaining to be done is so extensive that it would not be accomplished by five parties in. 10 years.
INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS FOR CONTINUING GEODETIC OPERATIONS.

Later in this report is given a statement of the progress of the geodetic survey of the U mted States and :possessions. Therein the statement is made that primary triangulation has been executed to 'the extent of 14,000 miles, primary traverse to the extent of 2,000 miles, and precise leveling to the amount of 41,000 miles. The location of this geodetic work in the United States is graphically shown on a base map of the United States in another portion of this report. (See fig. 31.) I have also stated earlier in the report that it is our ultimate aim to extend this work .so that triangulation and precise leveling bench marks shall be placed within 50 miles of each place in the United States. It needs no argument to convince the practical civil engineer of the necessity of extending this work to this degree of completeness at the earliest possible date. Indeed, he will contend that it ha~ now been far too long delayed. But, as this matter is finally of mterest to all, as well as to civil engineers, I feel it proper here to make some explanation of its needs. Geodetic control brought about by triangulation and precise leveling forms the basil' framework on ·which all our maps of any accuracy are based. If the reader, without preliminary measurements, will draw on a piece of paper a floor plan of his residence showing the various rooms, the chances are that it will be to some extent out of proportion-that is, that all of the lines shown in the diagram thus drawn will not be true to scale. On the other hand, if the reader had measured each of the floor spaces in the floor plan of his residence, including the thickness of walls, and determined on a scale for his drawing, say, 10 feet of floor space to be represented by 1 inch of his drawing, and laid out his drawing in exact accordance with his measurement, his diagram would then be in exact proportion-that is, 1 inch measured on the diagram would always represent 10 feet by actual measurements on the floor plan of his residence. This is an illustration of the application of geodetic control in drawing maps. The area to be mapped is first triangulated through triangulation observations covering the area to be mapped, the same results are obtained as if distances between points were actually measured. With the distances between definitely marked points on the earth's surface thus known and determined, maps can be drawn true to scale. I would, t~erefore, urge that the m&:in contr.ol be extende.d as rapidly as our eqmpment and personnel will permit, and that it should be

40

completed within five or six years. To do this will cost about $1,000,000, and I would urge that one-fifth o:f that amount be appropriated each year, or about $200,000 per annum. Triangulation stations and precise leveling bench marks within 50 miles o:f each place in the Umted States is what this scheme contemplates. This is :far :from what the final necessity will require, and by no means reaches the degree of completeness o:f many of the :foreign countries. The Corps o:f Engineers, United States Army has, as one o:f its :functions, the preparation of special military maps :for the defense of the country and for other purposes. Most o:f the maps made :for that organization will be close to the seacoast of the country. The control that will be used on those maps will be largely tertiary triangulation along the coast, done by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. That triangulation is, in some cases, in bad shape, due to the loss of station marks from the erosion of the shores and the work of man. It is, therefore, desirable that parties be sent along all the coasts of the United States to make inspection of the triangulation data. It is believed that, at least once m 10 years, triangulation stations should be visited and supplemented where necessary. During such an inspection the positions of any new permanent objects that can be used in surveying or by the navigator should be determined. In addition to the use of these branches of surveying for mapping purposes they have a very great value in furnishing the definite geographic location of boundary monuments of the States and between adjacent countries. For this use alone the expenditure would be thoroughly justified, as litigation over State and count:y boundaries has cost the Nation millions of dollars in the past, and will continue to do so as long as boundaries are uncertain in position.
INCREASED PAY FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.

The pay for the commissioned officers in this Bureau must be increased if we are to retain a corps of experienced and competent men. Under our present scale of salaries the younger and more efficient wen are leaving us for better opportunities elsewhere. Within 7 months 11 of our junior hydrographic and geodetic engineers have resigned from this service. Most of these were particularly competent officers who had had considerable training. Besides these, and within the same period of time, 7 of our commissioned aids have resigned, and it has been intimated to me that 2 or 3 additional junior hydrographic and geodetic engineers, as well as many aids, will resign in the near future. These resignations come to us not because of any dislike for the service in this Bureau. For the most part they are tendered reluctantly, because the men dislike to leave this service_, but opportunities for better pay, even better initial pay, are offered elsewhere, and advancement is more rapid and expectant.
INVESTIGATION OF THE USE OF THE AffiPLANE FOR MAKING SURVEYS,

Another need of the field service is an investigation of the possibilities of the use of the airplane in making topographic surveys and hydrographic examinations, as well as revisionary surveys. Airplane phot?graphs were used to a very great extent during the war in locatmg military features of the enemy. The same principle em-

41

ployed in the military work can be used in surveying and mapping, but a large amount of research work will have to be done before the airplane photograph will give the accuracy required of the highest class of surveyin~ done by this and other organizations. It is a very difficult matter to keep the topographic features up to date on the 700 charts of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey with the old methods, but it is possible in many cases, and especially in a flat country, to make very rapid revision of the shore line and adjacent land areas by means of photographs taken from airplanes. The Coast and Geodetic Survey during the past year has been in close cooperation with the air service of the Army and Navy in . making certain tests which indicate that suitable results may soon be expected. In fact, the best method, with proper handling of the airplane during the time that the photographs are being taken, will give results which can be used on at least small-scale charts of this Surve~. The mapping of the country adjacent to the shore where there is considerable relief is at present not practicable from the airplane on account of the great amount of work that would be involved in reducing the photographs to the map, but it is believed that methods will be developed by which this will be done more expeditiously, and then there will be no limit to the character of terram on which the airplane can be used for surveying. It must not be supposed that the airplane can entirely supersede the usual methods of surveying. We shall still need triangulation and traverse to give the fundamental control for the work, and much pla;rietable work will have to be done to locate topographical features which may be used in the control of the position of the airplane photographs. I~ is also probable that the planetable will still be the method for placmg the contours on the maps. While it is possible to obtain some idea of the relief of the country from overlapping airplane photographs, at the same time the problem of placing contours accurately on the map is one which will be difficult to solve. The office expense of contouring a map from airplane photographs will, undoubtedly, be greater than by an instrumental party working in the field, if the contouring is to be of a higher grade of accuracy. The most promising field for surveying and mapping from an airJ?lane is over flat country, or country with low relief, and in revision surveys where the contouring has already been accurately done. The changing features are shore lines, woods, roads, villages, and these features can be readily placed on the old map by fitting in the new featp.res shown on the photograph, to the unchanged features shown both on the old map and on the photograph. It is in this revision work that the Coast and Geodetic Survey expects much help from the air services of the Army and of the Navy. What seems to be most desirable at present is that we should have a research laboratory connected with the air service of the Army or of the Navy at whl.ch various methods and instruments might be tested. Such a laboratory should be preferably, in the vicinity of Washington, where the Government survey and mapping organizations are located. This Bureau and other surveying and mapping organizations of the Government have frequently called to the attention of the public the desirability of having our vast area mapped at an early date

42

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

for the benefit of commerce and industry. There is hardly a human effort that is not more or less dependent upon some kind of a map~ and the more accurate the map the greater its use to commerce and industry. There are many sparsely settled places in the United States where elaborate maps could not be justified, on account of the time and expense involved in their preparation. But there are many other communities where there are no maps to-day, where we would be far better off if we had an accurate map for the extension of roads, utilization of water power, and many other branches of human activity. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is doing what it can in the interest of the country in establishing the control for accurate maps. This work has been more vigorously carried on in the past two years. For the next fiscal year I have asked for a considerable increase in the amount of money to be devoted to this control work, and I ho:pe that Congress will see its way clear to grant this increase, for it is undoubtedly true that the public will be benefited every year many times the cost of the original surveys. On account of the great need of the public for maps, both along the coast and in the interior, the airplane photographs should be developed to such an extent that the usual methods of surveying could be supplemented by the airplane photograph and the work very greatly expedited. To this end the Coast and Geodetic Survey will lend its energy and support.

CHAPTER II.
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.

In the 1918 annual report of this Bureau the field accomplishments for the year were summarized under the following classifications: Hydrography: (1) Ship and launch hydrography, (2) wire-drag surveys, (3) .revision work, (4) current observations, (5) tidal observations, and (6) topogra1;>hy. Geodesy : ( 1) Triangulation, ( 2) precise levels, and ( 3) magnetic observations. These same classifications will be adhered to in summarizing the work accomplished during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1919.
HYDROGRAPHY.

This country was at war with Germany during the period this report covers and the naval needs of the country called for the use of all able vessels for one purpose or another, so it was very late in the fiscal year 1919 before any vessels could be released for civil duties. By the Executive order of September 24, 1917, three vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey (the Surveyor4 the Bache, and the /a?R) were transferred to the service and jurisdiction of the Navy Department for temporary use, and by the Executive order of May 16, 1918, two vessels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey (the Explorer and the Patterson) were likewise transferred to the service and jurisdiction of the Navy Department. The vessels thus taken over by the Navy Department were retained until late in the fiscal year 1919, an Executive order having been issued under date of February 26, 1919, authorizing their return to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by April 1, 1919. By the Executive order of May 24, 1919, under authority of the act of Congress, chapter 78, section 2, approved May 20, 1918, the Secretary of the Navy is authorized to transferany or all vessels, boats, and auxiliary ships of the Navy classified as yachts, coll1ers, transports, tenders, supply ships, hospital ships, submarine chasers, patrol boats, motor boats, fishing vessels, and special types built, purchased, or commandeered for u substantial consideration by the Navy subsequent to the declaration of Congress by joint resolution approved April 6, 1917, that war exists between the United States and Germany, and provided said vessels were built, purchased, or commandeered for the purposes of said war, and any other executive department of the Government is desirous of securing from the Navy Department such vessels, boats, and auxiliary ships, or any of them which are, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy, not necessary for the needs of the Navy, upon such terms as may be agreed to by the executive head of such department and the Secretary of the Navy.

Acting under this authority the following vessels of the 'Navy Department were transferred to the service and jurisdiction of the Coast and Geodetic Survey: Natoma, Ai>ril 9, 1919; Wenonah, April 12, 1919; 0'f11Ward, April 19, 1919; Ranger, April 28, 1919; Arcturus, May 5, 1919. ·

The following is a brief statement of the assignments of the 17 different vessels at the disposal of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at some time within the fiscal year: Arcturus.-This vessel was transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Navy Department under authority of the Executive order of May 24, 1919, above cited. The transfer was effected May 5, 1919. She was stationed at New York City when taken over. From the time of the transfer to the close of the fiscal year she remained at New York where she was being put into condition for making surveys for this Bureau. Bache.-The Bache was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey from the Navy Department by authority of the Executive order of February 26, 1919, which directed that she be returned not later than April 1, 1919. From that time until the end of the fiscal year she was being put into condition to take up survey work for the Bureau. Oosmos.-The Cosmos is a small Vffisel used by the Bureau when making inshore surveys in Alaskan waters. When not in commission she is pulled out of the water and stored in a boathouse maintained by the Bureau. She was in commission from July 25 to Sep"' tember 30, 1918. During the rest of the year she was in storage. Ewplorer.-The Explorer, which had been taken over by the Navy Department by the Executive order of September 24, 1917, was retained by the Navy until April 1, 1919, when she was transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by· authority of the Executive order of February 26, 1919. In my report for the fiscal year ended

June 30, 1917, on page 60 I made the following statement regarding the Explqrer: ·
In the design and f·onstructlon of this vessel, It was endeavored to provide for the utmost space in her. To provide this space, some of the str~ngthening members usually provided In a vessel were omitted. \Vhile no weakness was noticed in consequence of the absence of these strengthening members during her earlier work, she ls now showing their absence, and in rough seas her sides are pliable to the extent that the bolts holding them tog!!ther are subject to shearing stresses, and if she Is continually employed in rough seas, it means thaf she will ultimately become too weak to be of any service.

Because of this structural weakness and the belief that the vessels which have been received from the Navy, after they have undergone certain alter:ations, will be capable of executing more work at the same cost, and the same amount of work at less cost than will be possible with the Explorer, no attempt has been made to put her in the field since he.r return from the Navy. She will, however, be used temporarily as a housing vessel for detached parties in Alaskan waters. Fathomer.-This vessel operated in the Philippine waters and was in commission throughout the entire fiscal year. Hydrographer.-This vessel was in commission throughout the entire fiscal year in Atlantic coast and Gulf coast waters. bis.-This vessel was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey by the Navy Department by authority of the Executive order of February 26, 1919, which provided that she should be returned by April 1, 1919. From the time of her return to the close of the fiscal year she was being outfitted and overhauled to fit her for resuming !ier normal surveymg duties . .Matchle88.-This vessel is a wood, two-masted schooner. She was built at Key West, Fla., in the year 1859. Of late years she has been used as a house-boat from which parties operated in making survevs of inland waters. Experience developed the fact that she was no longer economically operated, even for this purpose, and accordingly, the necessary steps were taken and she was sold June 28, 1919. N atoma.-This vessel was transferred to the Coast and Geodeti..: Survey from the Navy Department by authority of the Executi ·e order of May 24, 1919. The transfer was effected April 9, l'J19. From that date until May 23 she was being put into conditi( n to take up survey work for this Bureau. Her field of operation will be on the Pacific coast. She left New York on May 23 for the J ·acific coast and had reached the Canal Zone June 30.
NoTE.-\Vhile the Natoma had not reached her field of opPration by t .le close of the fiscal year for which this report Is written, it was particularly gratifying to me to recelvP a letter from our inspc>ctor in charge of our fielll station at San Francisco, Calif., undc>r date of .July 31, 19l9, containing the following statement: "The arrival of the Natoma was particularly timc>ly, as a rf'<]uest had heen received from Admiral Rodman, in command of the Pachic Fleet, for nn examination of the Bonita Channel, and In particular· the lll~ation of the 5-fathom curve on the western edge of the channel, along th,! 'Potnto Patch.'" Admiral Rodman nsked that the result of the examinatlo,1 be fUrnlshed him on or before August 10. At the date of this report the work is In progress.

Onward.-This vessel was transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey from the Navy Department by authoritY. of Executive order of May 24, 1919. The transfer was effected Apr1l l9, 1919; from that

date until the close of the fiscal year she was being overhauled and altered for the purpose of taking up survey work for the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Pathfonder.-This vessel operated in Philippine waters throughout the entire fiscal year. Patterson.-In my report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1917, on page 61 I made the following statement regarding the Patterson:
The barkentine Patterson is structurally too weak to be used in exposed waters and too expensive of operation to be used as a house-boat for inside surveys. She has lately been employed in making surveys of the inside Alaskan waters, but is such an antiquated craft that the overhead cost of operation makes the results far less in quantity and more costly than they would be with a modern vessel. The Patterson was built 35 years ago.

By the Executive order of February 26 1919, the Patterson was directed to be returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey not later than April 1, 1919. Under date of May 26, 1919, I made the following recommendation to you regarding the Patterson:
The Forward, ex-Patterson, is virtually an auxiliary sailing vessel of such small steaming power that she can not make headway against a heavy wind. Consequently, her use on an exposed coast where there are no harbors is hazardous. As hydrography can not be efficiently executed to-day under sail. the only use to which this vessel can be put as a surveying craft is in the transportation of parties between Seattle and Alaska. On arrival in Alaska she is of little use except as a house-boat, because her low power and slow speed prevent her from executing enough hydrography to justify the cost of operation. The Bureau considers this an inefficient way to operate a hydrographic party.

It accordingly has met with your approval, that she be disposed of, and this will be done as soon as the necessary formalities can be complied with. Ranger.-The Ranger was transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey from the Navy Department under authority contained in Executive order of May 24, 1919. The transfer was effected April 28, 1919. Parties from her effected local surveys in New York Harbor between the date of transfer to the close of the fiscal year. At the same time she was being overhauled and outfitted for purposes of going to the field and making surveys. Romblon.-This vessel was employed in making surveys of the Philippine waters throughout the fiscal year. Surveyor.-She was returned from the Navy Department under authority of the Executive order of February 26, 1919. The return was effected April 1, 1919. From April 1 to April 21, she was at Norfolk, Va., in preparation for leaving for the Pacific coast to take up surveys in Alaskan waters. En route to Alaska she took· deepsea soundings on the steamer track from Norfolk to the Panama Canal and from the Panama Canal to San Diego, Calif. She had not reached Alaskan waters by the close of the fiscal year. W enonah.-This vessel was transferred to the Coast and Geodetic Survey from the Navy Department by authority of the Executive order of May 24, 1919. The transfer was effected April 12, 1919. From that date until June 7, the vessel was being overhauled and outfitted. On April 7 the vessel left for the Pacific coast, where she will be employed in making surveys. She also took deep-sea soundings en route to the Pacific coast.

CHAPTER III.
SHOWING CONDITIONS AND NEEDS OF HYDROGRAPHIC AND GEODETIC SURVEYS, WITH ILLUSTRATIONS-UNITED STATES AND POSSESSIONS.
HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEYS.

The discussion of the condition of the hydrographic surveys of our coasts is taken up section by section from northward to southward on the Atlantic coast and southward to northward on the Pacific coast. It is, of course, impossible within the limit of the scope of this volume to give a detailed analY.sis of conditions for every small inlet, bay, and harbor. What will be undertaken will be to show in general terms the condition of the surveys of the important areas and what needs to be done to enable the charting of nll dangers to navigation, many of which are now suspected but un<letermined. To facilitate reference to the text and to the locality, I have inserted diagrams on which the important steamer courses are indicated and numbered and the paragraphs of the text relating to the"e areas bear corresponding numbers. 1. Deep draft, along-shore course from the Canadian boundary to the outer limit of Isle au Haut Bay.-The entire area that this course covers is a region of ledges and bowlders. The ledges rise abruptly from the deep water and the bowlders ordinarily lie singly or in clusters on an otherwise flat bottom, so that the navigator can not depend on the lead to avoid them. This area is as yet untouched by the wire drag with the exception of a section aboi1t 15 miles in extent between Machias Seal Islands and Petit Manan Island. There are a number of towns along this course that depend largely on water-borne traffic for their supplies. The commerce consists in fuel and miscellaneous merchandise constituting the supply of the smaller and larger fashionable summer resorts, of which the largest is Bar Harbor, Me. The exceptionally rocky coast makes it certain that a wire-drag survey will result in the discovery of many rocks which now endanp:er the safety of commerce over this course. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.) 2. Frenchman Bay.-This body of water lies westward of Schoodic Peninsula and eastward of Mount Desert Island. It is the approach to the town and important summer resort of Bar Harbor, Winter Harbor, South West Harbor, North East Harbor, and many small villages. The bay is frequented by many passenger steamers, yachts, small craft, fishing vessels, and a few cargo vessels. This area has been dragged, though not to depths now considered neC'essary. The value of the work is further impaired by the necessity of passing over not less than 14 miles of undragged, doubtful area m order to reach the bay from the open sea. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.)
51

52

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEOpETIC SURVEY.

3. lnla'flfl thoroughfares from Mount Desert Island to Rockland.There is a series of valuable inside passages along the Maine coast that are very narrow in places and wind between rocky ledges. Owing to the nature of the bottom they are particularly likely to be obstructed by pinnacle rocks or the extension of narrow ridges out into the channel. The only part of these channels which has been dragged lies between Blue Hill Bay and the western entrance of Penobscot Bay. The results obtained have been so startling that they clearly indicate danger in the use of channels that have been dragged. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.) 4. Penobscot River.-This river, emptying into the head of Penobscot Bay, forms the approar h to the towns of Bucksport, Winterport, Hampden, and Brewer, and the city of Bangor, the latter two at the head of navigation, about 24 miles above Fort Point Lighthouse at the entrance. It has considerable trade in regular steamer drawing about 10 feet, and many vessels of deepest draft ordinarily trading to Bangor being about 18 feet. Practically the entire river above Bangor is used in lumbering. From the mouth of the river to Bangor there is no positive certainty of the absence of all dan~ers to navigation until the area has been dragged. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.) 5. Penobscot Bay.-In Penobscot Bay every port hns benefited by the practical completeness of the wire-drag work. There are, however, some of the less important sections to be dra~r~rd and Rome of the approaches from the eastward are not yet completed. The wire drag, as used by the Coast and Geodetic SurvPy, was developed in this region, and some of the area was not dragged to the depth now believed necessary. The size of vessels has increased rapidly, and additional work is neceE=sary to protect this increased draft. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.) As it has required time to solw n11 tlw problems involved in dragging to this greater depth, it is probable that much of the deeper part of Penobscot Bay will later han~ to be dragged to a greater depth. . 6. ·Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay (deep draft).-'fhe coast of New England throughout its length· presents practically one 11niform problem to .the hydrographic engineer. Surveys of vnryin!! d0grees of completeness have been made of the entire nrPa, and it is possible for navigators to solect channels which arr apparently safe. They wonld be- of ample depth if it were not for the ice-worn granite rock or the large bowlclers deposited during the glacial pPriod. The lrad line is not adapted to find without"I assistance dangers of this char.acter. This thoroughfare pres0nts uneven and rocky bottom between Monhegan Island and the eastern entrance to Casco Bay, which should be drngged to remove all doubt of the existence of pinnacle rocks or small ledges. (See fig. 5, opposite p. 52.) 7. Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay (moderate draft).-From the western entrance of Penobscot Bay to Casco Bay there has been no wiredrag work done. The inside route is constantly used by coasting steamers, but it is certain that it has within its limit many nn: harted rocks, some known locally and some unknown. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 8. Booth Bay Harbor.-This forms the approach to the town of Booth Bay Harbor and numerous smaller summer resorts. It is fre-

quented by many vessels, and by a large number of fishing boats and pleasure craft in summer. It is one of the best anchorages on the coast of Maine and is much used as a harbor of refuge by all clac;;ses of vessels. This area is in urgent need of a wire-drag survey. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 9 Kennebec Hiver.-It is the approal'h to the cities of Bath and Augusta, the towns of Woolworth, Richmond, and Gardiner, and numerous smaller villages and summer resorts. The river has considerable water-borne commerce. The deepest draft being about 21 feet to Bath and 14 feet to Augusta. There is urgent need for a wire-drag survey of this river. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 10. Gasco Bay.-Casco Bay and the approaches to Portland have been dra~ged with the result of finding numerous unr·harted shoals, thereby furnishing important evidence of the need of completing the survey to the eastward and westward. A resurvey of inner Casco Bay is badly needed, the glaciers having left a series of long narrows and dangerous ledges which require closer examination. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54. ) · 11. Portland Harbor and approaches.-These have been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are shown on the charts. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 12. Portland to Portsmouth (moderate draft).-Westward of Portland the succession of sand beaches, of which Old Orchard is the best known, might appear to indicate an absence of rocks in this region. The depth of sand above the underlying rock is not great, however, and pinnacle rocks oecur outside these beaclws. Southward of Cape Porpoise the surveys are entirely inadequate, and the need of immediate surveys is evident by the appearame on the chart of a rocky shoal with 5 fathoms or less, marked "position doubtful." This was recently reported by a fisherman, but it has not yet been practicable to Jocat;e it. However, arrangements are made to extend tho wire-drag survey from Boon Island to a jumtion with the wiredrag work at Cape Elizabeth, Me., b('ginning Jnly 1, Hll9. This will include the area reported dangerous. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 13. Portland to Cape Ann (deep draft).-The region from Boon . Island to Isle of Shoals is very rocky, and its importance as the approach to Portsmouth is so well recognized that work is now progressing, on the completion of which a perfeetly safe track will bf\ provided from Portland to the vicinity of Cape Ann. (See fi2'. 6. opposite p. 54.) 14. Portsrrwuth llarbor.-This area has been dragged, and all dangers to navigation are known. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 15. Massachusetts coast north of Cape Ann.-From the New Hampshire border to Cape Ann the shores are entirely different from those to the north or south. There are high sand bluffs in places and low sandy shores in others. As a result the depths along the shore are changeable, and though they have been recently snrveyed, they will need further attention. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 16. Cape Ann to Cape Cod Can.al.-A completely dragged area extends from Cape Ann to the Cape Cod Canal and from the head of Buzzards Bay to Sakonnet Point, R. I. With the exception of the inner part of Boston Bay and the areas near the shores of Bu.zzards Bay, this important survey is complete. This work was made

especially necessary by the opening of the Cap Cod Canal in 1915, the original surveys having been made while the commerce of the region was relatively unimportant. A number of shoals were found of less than the proposed canal depth, so that the needs would at scme further date make it necessary to deepen this canal to take care of the largest vessels. With this view, the drag was carried at a sufficient depth to meet such requirements. Even should a depth of 40 feet be adopted for the canal, the present surveys of the approaches will be found adequate, and where less depths have been found the information will be invaluable to the engineers making the improvement. (See fig. 6, opposite p. 54.) 17. From Boston south outside Oape Ood.-Much of the traffic between eastern New England and points west and south passes outside of Cape Cod; most of it through Nantucket and Vineyard Sounds. Off' Cupe Cod the surveys are not complete. In Nantucket Sound the entire route is through channels bounded by shifting sand, and require revision work from time to time. In one part of the channel most used, through Pollock Rip Slue, a shoal was formed in the last few years that has been steadily narrowing and decreasing the depth of the < hannel. A resurvey of parts of this route is needed every few years to insure safety to navigation. No rocks around eastward of Cape Cod, but in the north half of Nantucket Sound and the western part of Vineyard Sound large bowlders occur and wire-drag work is needed. At present vessels must pass over 10 miles of undragged area in following the best channel through Vineyard Sound. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 54.) 18. } r·om Cape Cod Canal through Buzzards Bay.-This route has been dragged out to the eastern limit of Block Island Sound. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 54.) 19. Narragan:sett Bay.-This area has been dragged with the exception of the thoroughfare leading through Mount Hope Bay to Fall River, and the small stretch to the north and east of Prudence Island. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 54.) 20. 1!.'ntrance to N arragamett Bay, Block 1 slwrul Sound, Fishers bland Sound, and eastern part of Long Island Sound.-These areas are in a stage of completion. The work of the present season will complete their survey with the exception of the central and western parts of Long Island Sound, which remain to be dragged. (See fig. 7, opposite p. 54.) 21. Gulf of 111 aine.-The portion of the Gulf of Maine of which this Bureau makes surveys may be considered as lying to the westward of meridian 67° O' and extending to Nantucket Shoals. This entire area has been surveyed, but the surveys are inadequate. Not only are the soundings obtained insufficient, but many of them are not lo: ated correctly on the charts. A good example of this is the discovery several years ago that only one shoal rock exists on Cashes Ledge, where two were charted, and that Sigsbee and Ammen Rocks, formerly shown 4 miles apart, are really the same rock. These defects in the charts are serious for two reasons: The trans-Atlantic steamers approaching the ports of northern New England, especially Portland and Boston, are unable to depend on the charts of the gulf suffif iently to locate themselves accurately by sounding. This is particularly serious during the fog of summer which often extends

far out to sea and lasts for days, and during the winter snowstorms. In addition to this, the fisheries of the Gulf of Maine are an important national asset. Not only are many important fishing banks urn harted, but the limit and depths. of known banks are not correctly given. Besides, there is not at present enough information available as to the character of the bottom. The knowledge of rocky bottom may lead to the discovery of good fishing grounds. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 56.) · 22. Nantuclcet Shoals to Georges Banks.-Extending eastwarcl from Nantucket Sound .there is an immense shoal area, consisting of sandy ridges which are shifted by the waves and currents. Nantucket Shoals extend about 50 miles offshore, then there is a deep channel followed by ridges. It is readily seen that it is important to keep the channel surveyed and to examine the adjacent shoals to detect changes; but it might readily be asked, What is the use of surveying such areas as Nantucket Shoals; which vessels are most careful to avoid~ First, it is necessary to be certain that the outer limits of these shoals are clearly defined in order that they may be avoided. Second, the shoals are important fishing grounds. Third, more careful surveys may develop.sa~e channels for coastwise navigationchannels which are already md1cated on the charts but are unsafe td use because of inadequate surveys. The existing surveys are nowhere adequate. The shoals are so numerous and the channels so intricate that a difficult problem is presented in their examination by accurate methods. The ground fishing, which has in recent years ·assumed large proportions, is steadily moving seaward. During the winter Nantucket Island is the headquarters of this industry. Not only do the present charts lack the needed information in the search for new grounds, but the absence from the charts of existing shoals ·is a source of danger to the boats running to and from the harbor. Breakers often occur where there is ample depth for boats when the water '·is smooth. This is an excellent example of how a region usually avoided by commerce may be of importance to an industry which furnishes part of the food supply of the Nation. (See fig. 8, opposite p. 56.) 23. Trans-Atlantic approach to New York.-There is scarcely any part of our coast where correct soundings are of more importance than in the approach to New York from the eastward, as all transAtlantic steamers bound to that port pass over this area. Many of them have to depend on soundings for safety. A fairly good survey of this area is available, but additional work should be done by morlern methods in the portion out of sight of land so that the needs of the enormous traffic will be met. (See. fig. 8, opposite p. 56.) 2-l. From Point Judith to New Y ork.-It is almost unnecessary to f!O into particulars except to make it clear that the central and western parts of Long Island Sound remain to be dragged. This work will be undertaken at the earliest opportunity. The project to deepen East River to 40 feet makes it necessary to be certain where the channels with such depths are located in Long Island Sound. The work done in Block Island Sound has defined the limit of such depths in the eastern approach to Long Island Sound, and it is urgent that the entire area should be completed without delay. The approaches to all the harbors on Long Island Sound should be

dragged. The shoaler bays are filled with motor boats, and the number in operation :for a given area is probably greater ·than anywhere else in the United States. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 56.) . 25. Hudson River.-The Hudson River is a valuable waterway between New York ..and Albany and is a part of the canal system of the State. A few years ago a dangerous rock was :found directly in the path of steamers between New York and Albany. With such a/ossibility all the doubtful ;part of the Hudson should be dragge . (See fig. 9, opposite p. 56.) 26. New York Harbor.-New York Harbor has had a recent survey, but as it is an area subject to change, it will require a' survey, at least in part, every few years. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 56.) 27. Coast {)f New Jersey.-Along the most of the coast of New Jersey the character of the bottom is such that the exact existing depths should be ascertained beyond all doubt, particularly as shoals dangerous to coastwise traffic have been reported from time to time. The only reliable surveys along this stretch of coast have been made in connection with searches for. these reported shoals. Eqstward of Cape May there are shoals that need a resurvey. Arrangements have been made to begin a survey from Cape Henlopen to New York on July 1, 1919. This survey will extend out to the 100fathom curve. (See fig. 9, opposite p. 56.) 28. Delaware Bay.-Delaware Bay has as its most marked characteristic a series of narrow, fairly deep channels separated by long, narrow shoals. These shoals are subject to change. A survey is needed now, and one should be made about every 10 years in the entrance, and at longer intervals in the upper bay. While dredged channels are maintained for most of the distance from the entrance of the bay to Philadelphia, vessels of moderate draft use the other channels. In view of the importance of the cities at the head of the bay and on the river it is highly important that the needed survey of Delaware Bay be made so that a chart of the proper standard i·nay be issued. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.) 29. Dela:ware Bay entrance to Ohesapeal~e Bay.-From Delaware Bay entrance to Chesapeake Bay there is a succession of shoals and banks. Many of these are buoyed so that moderate-draft vessels may pass inside of them. In certain regions it is of the highest importance that the survey should be correct and kept up to elate. At only one place has a comprehensive survey been made, and this was the investigation of a reported shoal. Arrangements have been made to take up the survey of the entire area in July, 1919. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.) 30. Chesapeake Bay and tributaries.-These have been extensively surveyed in recent years, and a large number of tributaries will not require resurveys for many years. This is also true of the Potomac River. The parts which need resurveying are parts of the bay from Cape Charles to a point opposite Annapolis, parts of the .Tames River, and the Rappahannock and Susquehanna Rivers. The entrance has been recently surveyed, but another survey will probably be needed in 10 years. The bay is greatly in need of examination at critical localities where depths are near the draft of vessels; frequent reports indieating presence of new shoals. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.)

31. Ohesapealce Bay entrance to Oape liatteras.-Thc diagram shows the tracks for both the light-draft and deep-draft vessels. While a resurvey is desired, the most pressing need is that the present" limit of shoal areas be accurately determined. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.) 32. Albermarle Sound.-Albermarle Sound and its tributaries, with a few exceptions, have been resurveyed within the last few years and will not require resurveying for a long time. The uncompleted portions, including the North and Alligator Rivers, should be finished in the near future, as they form part of the project for a through 10foot channel 0£ the inside waterway route. The Chowan River, which is the western extension of the sound, should also be finished, and then the surveys of this re,gion would be in a most satisfactory up-to-d~te condition. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.) 33. 01·oatan Sound.-Croatan Sound, the connecting link between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds, has recently been resurveyed, but the depth is so near to the draft of vessels using it that the surveys will have to be revised from time to time. Changes in the main channel have occurred within the last two years. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58.) 34. Pamlwo Sound.-Pamlico Sound has additional importance owing to its relation to the inland waterway route. The eastern half of the sound is well surveyed, but the entire western lrnH and the N eusc River, which, in addition to its local use as part of the through 10foot channel, have not been covered by recent surveys. (See fig. 10, opposite p. 58:) 35. Diamond Slwals.-Diamond Shoals off Hatteras should be resurveyed chiefly to determine changes in their extent, and particularly to obtain a knowledge of the correct depths on the seaward side. (See fitf: 10, opposite p. 58.) . 36. Cape liattPras to Winyah B(JJ!J, S. 0.-Nearly the whole of this area is in need of a new survey, as those now charted are not in sufficient detail for modern navigation. Next to Diamond Shoals in importance to coastwise navigation are the shoals extending seaward from Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. They are subject to change and should be examined at short intervals. (See fig. 11. opposite p. 58.) 37. Winyah Bay to Fe1"fl.andina, Fl~.-From Wiriyah Bay to Fernandina, Fla. This region has been recently surveyed, the work extending .out to the 100-fathom curve. (See· fig. 11, opposite p. 58.) . 38. FeTnandina to the Florida Reefs.-From Fernandina to the Florida Ree£s the area of moderate depths continually narrows, until at Palm Beach the distance to the 100-fathom curve is very small. The completed survey extends southward to a little below St. Augustine. South 0£ St. Augustine, the bottom is probably not subject to change except as noted below, and the surv,eys, while by no means complete, are fair. Off Cape Canaveral and outside the southern hal£ 0£ the Indian ~iver there are extensive banks and ridges in urgent need 0£ reRurvey. Known depths of 11 to 16 feet a long way offshore show the need of further surveys to ~ake certain that all the shoals are correctly charted. From Jupiter Inlet to Fowey Rocks, where the Florida Reefs begin, the deep W&ter approaches so close to the shore that it will be a slight task to complete inshore work in connection with the offshore .surveys. (See. :fig. 12, opposite p. 60.)

39. General, Atlantic and Gulf coasts.-An explanation of the method used in locating a vessel by sounding will show why accurate charts are particularly needed from New York to Palm Beach and from Key West to the Mexican border. At fixed intervals the vessel takes soundings, which are plotted to the scale of the chart on tracing paper, and this is moved over the chart, keeping the line joining the soundings parallel to the course of the vessel until the soundings agree with those shown on the chart. If the charts are correct and based on a sufficiently modern survey, the method is one of the best known for locating its position. r£, on the other hand, the soundings are few and far apart so that the ship's soundings fall between them, and if those on the chart are wrongly placed, this method becomes much more difficult and an accidental agreement may lead the vessel into danger. From New York to Cape Hatteras the charts are fairly good, by no means good enough to meet the full needs of navigation, but the work required to bring them up to date has been postponed, as the need for resurveys has been more urgent farther south. Up to a few years ago the offshore surveys from Cape Hatteras to the Florida Reefs were almost unbelievably deficient. This condition is being remedied as rapidly as possible, and between Winyah Bay, S. C., and St. Augustine, Fla., the offshore work out to the Gttlf Stream is complete. It is important that this work be extended both north and south from its present limit as rapidly as possible. w·ith adequate funds full advantage can be taken 9f the seasons and by working north in the summer and south in the winter the cost of the work will be greatly reduced. (See figs. 10 and 11, opposite p. 58.) 40. Indian River.-There have been no rerent surveys of these waters. Revisionary work is needed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 41. Biscayne Bay.-Recent surveys have been made of this area. In the vicinity of Miami and as far south as Fowey Rocks. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 42. Vicinity of Fowey Roclcs Light.-No recent surveys have been made. Inshore and offshore work is needed. The present surveys are not sufficient in detail. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 43. Coast of Florida from Palm Beach around to Cedar Keys.For a distance along the shore of 567 miles from Palm Beach southward around to Cedar Keys on the west roast of Florida, coral reefs are found, in some places more abund:mt than in others. Coral reefs, whether the result of disintegration or of a building up by animal growth, are found in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers of sharp projections from the general bottom where conditions are favorable for the growth of coral. While we are informed that an enormous number of uncharted rocks exist in this region, the fact that they are so numerous, that the region is so large, and that there is little navigation over much of it, it appears to the interests of navigation to drag areas of the coast used by commercial and naval vessels, because of both the time and cost involved. Wire-drag work is accordingly undertaken in localities where there are commerce and naval operations. To accomplish even this will require years of work. Westward-bound vessels through the Florida Straits have to force their way against the strong current of the Gulf Stream, which in places attains a velocity of 5 miles per hour. Along the northerly edge of

the stream and close to the reefs the current is very weak and at times runs to the westward. There "ii;; a strong temptation to keep dangerously close to the reefs and save fuel, and this is the cause of frequent accidents. Besides the danger of running into the known reefs, which are in many places bare and are of no great depth throughout their length, another danger, the extent of which is not yet known, has been discovered in a secondary reef, parallel to the main reef, and about one-half mile outside of it. This secondary reef is found to approach the surface in places as a narrow ridge with depths as little as 25 feet. Twenty-five miles of this reef has been examined, but 200 miles remain to be examined. It is important to nearly all the great traffic entering the Gulf of Mexico that this examination be romp}~ted at the earliest possible moment. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 44. Vessel courses north from Key West.- Vessels bound for eastern Gulf ports naturally wish to take the shortest route. If of light draft, they can cross the Florida Reefs at Key West: The next channel is between Rebecca Shoal and Dry Tortugas, and if this is not used vessels must pass well to the westward of Dry Tortugas to avoid a shoal bank west of it. The Rebecca Shoal channel has been dragged and has ample depth of water. The bank west of Tortugas should be dragged, especially as vessels making land from the westward have to cross part of it. Northward of the keys from Key West to Tortugas a doubtful area should be dragged. The channel between the keys and the reef known as the Hawk Channel is important for moderate-draft vessels. While it is not at present planned to drag it, it may be found necessary to drag the axis of the channel. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 45. Uape Ramano.-This area is in need of surveys. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 46. Charlotte Harbo'l'.-No recent surveys have been made of this area and should be resurveyed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 47. Tampa Bay and approach.-The existing surveys at present meet the needs of navigation of these waters. tSee fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 48. Cedar Keys.-No recent surveys have been made of this region. Wire-drag surveys are badly needed. (See fig. 12, opposite p. 60.) 49. Apalachee Bay.-No recent surveys have been made of this region and revision work is needed. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 50. Inshore waters, Gulf coast.-The chief characteristics of the west coast of Florida are the distance to which shoal water extends offshore between Cape Sable and Cape Romano and from Tampa Bay to Apalachicola, and the existence of a number of large bays connected with the sea by deep channels, either natural or dredged. From Apalachee Bay to Cape San Blas the coast begins tO assume a character more like the South Atlantic coast, and coral bottom is no longer found. This stretch of coast is sandy and sand shoals extend off some distance, especially in the vicinity of Cape San. Blas. This region needs a resurvey and, like other sandy portions of the coast, will need resurveying from time to time. The Florida and Alabama coasts are somewhat different, as deep water approaches close to the shore in the latter. The coast of Mississippi and Louisiana has a very large proportion of changeable area, and resurveys

are needed now and will be needed from time to time in the area from Mobile Bay to the end of the offshore shoals of Vermilion Bay. The immense load of sediment carried by the Mississippi River, especially in time of flood, causes constant changes in the delta. The deposit of sediment and the action of the waves on the deposit results in rapid growth in some places and of erosion in others. Sixty miles west of the Mississippi Delta there begins an extensive shoal region which is in need of survey. The inshore portion along the rest of the Louisiana coast, and the Texas coast, with an important exception, has deep water fairly close to the shore. The exception 'is along the eastern part of the Texas coast from Sabine Pass to Galveston. Sabine Bank and Heald Bank have shoal depths at a considerable distance from the shore, and thev should have a thorough resurvey. Galveston Bay also needs resurveying. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 51. St. Josephs Bay.-No recent surveys have been made of this area and a reexamination is needed. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 52. Offshore waters, Florida reef8 to the Mexican border.-Along the northern edge of the Florida Straits the soundings are insufficient, and they will have to be carried out somewhat beyond the 100-fathom curve. Along the west coast of Florida the distance out to the 100fathom curve is about 100 miles. Over much of this area the depths are moderate and the charts are based on reconnoissance surveys only. The bottom is coral rock in many places, and projections from coral banks may come sufficiently near the surface to be a menace to na vigation. Fishermen have reported several uncharted ridges,· and while the somewhat incomplete surveys of the reported localities have not confirmed all the details of their reports, important differences from the charted depths have' been found. The 100-fathom curve approaches fairly close to the Mississippi Delta, then swings offshore again, so that it is about 60 miles south of Sabine Pass. It then swings to the southward in a curve,.which brings it within about 80 miles offshore at the Mexican border. This whole offshore area is badly in need of a thorough resurvey. There is no other part of the work in offshore water so likely to be productive in furnishing important changes in existing charted depths. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 53. Pensacola Bay.-Surveys are now under way at the entrance to the bay; the entire bay requires reexamination. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 54. M onile Bay.-A resurvey of this bay has been completed. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) · 55. Mississipi Sound.-A resurvey of this sound has been completed. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 56. Lalce Pontohartrain.-In connection with the surveys in Mobile Bay and· Mississippi Sound, a recent survey has been made at the eastern end of the lake. The greater part of the lake. has not 'been examined for 20 years. (See fig. 13, opposite p. 60.) 57. Approaches to JJ!ississlppi passes.-:-Resurveys have been completed recent.ly. (See fig. 13. oppo<Jite p. 60.) 58. Vermilion Bay and Cote Blanche.-No recent surveys have been made of these areas. Surveys are needed. (See fig. 14, opposite p. 62.) · 59.

60. Porto Rioo.-The surveys of Porto Rico were begun when the island came under the jurisdiction of the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War. By 1910 the surveys of the bays, channels, and inshore waters were completed and a number of deepsea soundings were taken around the island. There are, however, extending to the eastward and westward of the island and along the south coast extensive areas where the bottom is of cora'l formation. There are also reefs along the north coast, but as they are close to shore and must be avoided by vessels, it is only important to know their location and limits. The areas on the east, south, and west are different in that there is traffic between the reefs and over areas where the depth is little greater than the draft of the vessel, and the probable existence of uncharted projections is a source of danger. Vieques Sound between Culebra and Vieques Island, east of Porto Rico, Virgin Passage, and the approaches to the harbors of the American Virgil?- Islands are in need of wire-drag surveys. . T~1e only work of this character that has been accomplished here is m the vicinity of Mayaguez. This work resulted in the abandonment . of one channel and the rebuoying of another. (See fig. 15, opposite p. 62.)' 61. Virgin lslarnds.-The Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark, and the United States took possession in 1917. The sur~ veys that have been made are by the British and Danish Governments. At the present time the available data regarding these surveys are being examined with the view to determining whether or not they are sufficient for the needs of our naval and commercial vessels. It is certain that the coral formation in the waters touching these islands requires extensive wire-drag surveys before a~curate charts can be issued. (See fig. 15, opposite p. 62, and fig. 30, opposite p. 116.) ' . .. 62. Pana:ma Owna.l.-The Atlantic approach to the Panama Canal has been surveyed since work started on the canal construction. Limon Bay is, however, a region where pinnacle rocks occur. All the anchorages should be dragged, and the work should he carried a short distance otitside. The Pacific approach to the canal has had ·a recent survey and has been dragged. No further surveys are needed at the western end at present. (See fig. 16, opposite p. 62.) 63. Pacific coast of the United States.-The western coast of the United States is very .different from the eastern. Gene1·ally mountainous, with comparatively few harbors or inside waterways and with comparatively deep water close to the shore, it presents little resemblance to the low shores and wide continental shelf of the Atlantic. The purpose of the surveys is, then, to meet the needs of vessels approaching from seaward and coasting vessels which keep to a few comparatively narrow tracks, to insure up-to-date charts of the various harbors, to make soundings offshore, and to develop fishing banks that are known to exist. The weather is an important factor in increasing the importance of the charts of this coast. From Los Angeles Harbor northward fog is very common in the summer time, and in the winter gales accompanied by thick weather arre of frequent occurrence. On the coast in the vicinity of San Francisco thick weather is of frequent occurrence. On the coast in the vicinity of San Francisco thick weather is prevalent for perhaps 25 per cent of the time. Under such conditions the navigator must rely entirely

upon his chart, and it ·is essential that detail surveys be made to beyond the limit of soundings taken by merchant vessels, which is the 100-fathom curve. Along the shore of southern California much w9rk was done up to 1895, and some of the surveys then made may be accepted as final. In the vicinity of the outer islands surveys extended only a little way from the shore, and the deep waters between and outside of them· are surveyed. The few soundings taken show irregular bottom and breakers have been reported in places where the chart shows 600 fathoms. These waters, therefore, should be surveyed out to the 1,000-fathom depth. The Oregon coast is practically unsurveyed. A limited amount of work was done years ago south of Cape Blanco and in the vicinity of the Columbia River, but this was not more than a reconnoissance and does not extend out far enough to be of practical value to navigators. Elsewhere no surveys have ever been undertaken. Even in such an important locality as Cape Blanco, which must be rounded by all vessels plying between the Columbia River and San Francisco, there are no soundings to serve· as a guide in thick weather, and vessels have been lost wholly on account of this lack of surveys. On the coast of Oregon there are eight important harbors on which the Government and private interests have expended approximately $40,250,000 in improvements designed to facilitate navigation. One of these is the Columbia River, the gateway to one of the most important transportation centers of the Pacific coast. Yet in s:pite of these immense expenditures for improvement, there is not a smgle one of these harbors the approaches to which have been adequately surveyed. The approaches to the Columbia have been sounded for a short distance offshore, but even in this area the soundings are too far apart to more than indicate, in a general way, the depths which may be expected. This partial survey extends southward along the coast to include the approaches to two other harbors. The approaches to the remaining five, on which $3,826,000 have been expended in improvement, are entirely unsurveyed. The entire Washington coast stands in urgent need of a first survey, except in the approach to the Straits' of Juan de Fuca and in the. straits themselves where the present work is adequate. (See figs. 17 and 19, opposite p. 62.) . 64. Los Angeles Harbor.-Los Angeles Harbor should be dragged. (See fig. 17, opp?site p. 62.) . . . 65. SM Francisco Bay.-San Francisco Bay is of vaned character of bottom and the needed surveys vary to correspond. The outer approaches are complete except in the ·vicinity of the Farallones. Here additional sounding is needed and an investigation should be made with the wire drag to verify the existence of other rocks than those charted. The bar outside the Golden Gate needs a resurvey. Wire-drag work has been carried through the Golden Gate and inside, both northward and southward of San Francisco to the limit of the rocky area. The southern part of the bay where the bottom is subject to change by currents is in need of resurvey. (See fig. 18, opposite p. 62.) 66. Along shore waters of the Pacific Ooast States.-From the western end of the Santa Barbara Channel to Monterey Bay the surveys, as a rule, extend only to the 50-fathom curve, which lies but a short distance offshore. These surveys should be extended seaward to include the usual track of coastwise vessels, which lies an

average distance of about 10 miles from shore. From San Francisco 13ay to Point Arena a widely-spaced system of sounding lines has been carried out to the 100-fathom curve. Here, an additional amount of work, about equal to that already accomplished, is necessary before the survey can be considered complete. Between Point Arena and Cape Mendocino the surveys extend a uniform distance of 6 miles from shore, reaching depths varying from 50 to 200 fathoms. Additional detailed surveys should be made in the vicinity of each cape, and between them the work should be carried seaward to beyond the steamer track. From Cape Mendocino northward to the Oregon boundary the limited surveys existing were made ·many years ago and are entirely inadequate. A complete resurvey should be made at the earliest possible date. There are no adequate surveys of the inshore area along the State of Oregon. Of the water off the northern part of the Pacific coast, little is known except that the Bureau of Fisheries, acting on the information obtained from fishermen, has located certain banks. These banks should be surveyed to de(;ermine their depths and extent, and it is believed that a general . survey carried out to the 1,000-fathom curve will result in the discovery of other banks of great value. (See fig. 19, opposite p. 64.) 67. Interior waters of the State of W ashington.-The interior waters of the State of Washington represent the point of change from a practically straight coast line to the broken formation of the coast of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. There are many channels of importance leading to Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, Bellingham, and Olympia, and connecting with the inside passage to southeastern Alaska. All these waters should be dragged wherever there is the slightest doubt as to the presence of dangers to navigation. (See fig. 20, opposite p. 64.) 67a. Alaska, general.-An important difference between Alaska waters and those of the continental United States is that scarcely enough work has been done to let us know just how much must be done to complete the charts. The development of the country has far outstripped the progress of surveys, not only because of the few vessels and parties engaged in the work, but because of the great length of coast over which the various activities are scattered and the intricate system of channels for so much of its extent. In order to appreciate the need of rapidly extending the surveys of these waters, it should be clearly understood that Alaska's only connection with the rest of the world is by the water routes. The amount of the natural resources of Alaska ripe for exploitation has been so great and the prize they offered so tempting that transportation could not wait for the Government to make the way to them secure. It has gone ahead finding its own path to ·new fields, suffering great losses in so doing, but content to suffer them because the returns were so immensely greater. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 64.) · 68. Steame'!' '!'outes, southeastern Alaska.-In southeastern Alaska the first and most obvious need is to complete the wire-drag work. Most of these waters have been sounded, so that only dragging is necessary to complete this survey. This drag work should be taken up in the order of its importance, beginning with the main steamer route through the region and then taking up the various tributary waters leadmg to areas of commercial importance. For some years past, two parties have been actively engaged in dragging the main

64

'REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

steamer routes, and tl}is work is now about 55 per cent complete. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 64.) · 69. The outside coast waters of the islands bordering on the open Pacific.-These and their connecting channels are largely unsurveyed and should be navigated with great caution. A navigator, seeing a chart on which the shore line is stretched, no soundings, several rocks and shoal banks, notes as to rocks and breakers reported, and a statement on the chart to the effect that the area is unsurveyed, is, to say the least, unable to proceed with confidence; and this situation is by. no means unusual. The same pressing need of such regions is a complete hydrographio survey followed later in places by wiredrag work. Tim rapidly increasing commercial importance of this region and the excepticnally dangerous character of the waters through which traffic must pacs, render surveys in the near future imp::rative. (See fig. 21, opposite p. 64.) 70. Cross Sound to Prince 1Villiam Sound.-From Cross Sound, the northernmost channel from the inside waters to the sea, to Prince William Sound, the coast has few features of present or prospective importance. There is, however, urgent need for surveys to insure the safety of vessels approaching and passing along this coast. In this region the charts are very defective in the manner of showing sounding and prominent coastal mountain peaks and headlands that would enable the navigator to obtain his position on approaching from seaward. The .only import!ll_lt break on this coast, Y alrntat Bay, has some canneries, and addit10nal surveys are needed here on this account.. (Sec fig. 22, opposite p. 66.) .. 71. Prince William, Sound to Unimak Pass.-A very important section of the Alaska coa,st extends from the waters of Prince William Sound westward to Unimak Pass. Not only are the industries of present importance, but there are extensive mineral resources largely undeveloped through lack of cheaper transportation. The point to be emphasized is that this is not an old, settled country with its needs in the matter of transportation fixed, but it is still capable of great future development, and in considering the needed surveys its future must be taken into account. The approaches to Prince William Sound have been surveyed and no resurveys for the present are needed except in the vicinity of Cape St. Elias and Middleton Island. Wire-drag work will be needed in both of these localities as reefs ana pinnacle rocks exist. Prince William Sound needs additional soundings over most of its area, and many of its branches need original surveys. Cordova is the terminus of the Copper River & .Northwestern Railway .which gives access to the important copper mines on the Copper River. The approaches to Cordova have been surveyed, except for wire-drag surveys needed to insure complete safety. Seward, ·on Resurrection Bay, is the terminus of the Alaska Railroad now being built by the Government. The surveys of its approach are completed ~x9ept. for wire-drag-. work. It is probable that much of the trade origmatmg alo:ng the lme of the Government railway will be transshipped at Anchorag-e at the head of Cook Inlet. Not only will this make it necessary for many vessels to navig-ate these waters, but there are now very large salmon canneries all along its shores, as well as considerable mining. The present surveys are inadequate and wire-drag work is needed over much of its area.

Kodiak Island, with a number of canneries and \vith: :some cattie grazing, is largely unsurveyed. From Kodiak Island westward· to· Unimak Pass only a comparatively small part has bee11 surveyedat all. While the amount of present traffic is small it i.s sufficient to need protection. At present the Coast Guard vessels !),nd the freight and passenger vessels run grave risks in using the protected natur11l channel leading along the coast inside the island. This i~ a p!J-rticularly bad stretch of coast with many reefs and islands. · Qnly· in the vicinity of the Shumagin Islands and from Unimak Pass to Unalaska Islands have surveys been made, and they itre inadequate. It is not now practicable to drag the entire ·area, but it is important that the immediate needs of navigation, ernn though of. limited arn:ouilt, ~b~ met by dragging a selected channel to insure the safety of vesselS from Shelikof Strait to Unimak Pass. Unimak Pass is the almost universally used channel into Bering Sea. It has been surveyed, bnt it is probable that part of it should be dragged or at least further soundings be taken. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 66.) 72. Aleutian lslands.-The Aleutian Islands have comparatively little traffic and are without survey. It is necessary that this region be patrolled by Coast-Guard vessels. The loss of one of the vessels of this service a few years ago was wholly due to the lack of adequate surveys. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 66.) . 73. Bristol Bay.-A large.part of the salmon shipped from Alaska comes from Bristol Bay. This is without surveys except in Nushagak Bay and Kuskokwim Bay and River. Both of these have recent surveys, but as the bottom is snbjpct to change on account of the large rivers, future additional surveys will be needed. As an example of what surveys mean in a new region, the discovery of an entrance to the Kuskokwim River suitable for moderate-draft vessels opened up an immense area for grazing 1md also in places for general agriculture. (See fi~. 22, opposite p. 66.) 74. .Norton Sound.-The importance of Norton Sound is due to the gold mining on its northern shores and as being the outlet of the Yukon delta on the southern shore. In all of Norton Sound additional surveys are needed. It is curious that in this sound, which according to all available information is of quite level, sandy, or muddy bottom, Besboro Island rises very abruptly to a height of 1,012 feet. With such an occurrence it is not absolutely certain that no pinnacle rocks exist. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 66.) 75. Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean.-Except in the vicinity of Pribilof Islands, there are no other existing surveys in Bering Sea or to the north which can be considered of value. (See fig. 22, opposite p. 66.) 76. Guam.-The present chart of the island of Guam is compiled from Spanish and British charts and some harbor surveys by the United States Navy. No attempt at .a comprehensive survey has been made. A complete survey should be made, not only including the harbors, but the surrounding waters, carrying the work out to a depth that will be certain to include all dangers. In these waterS: shoals rise abruptly from great depths, and the absence of so1.mdings on the charts does not imply safety, but simply absence of s~rveys. 77. llawaiialfl, lslands.-There are only two good harbors:on all the Hawaiian Islands and both of these are on Oahu Island. All of the islands except Hawaii have coral reefs around at least part of

them. In the vicinity of Oahu, Maui, Kahoolawe, and the south coast of Molokai the surveys are fairly complete. In the vicinity of Hawaii the surveys are very inadequate except in the only harbor, Hilo Bay. The west coast of Lanai and the vicinity of the two westernmost islands, J auai and Niihau, are practically unsurveyed. The various channels between the islands from Maui to Oahu are fairly well surveyed. The others are practically without surveys. . (See fig. 23, opposite p. 66.) 18. Philippine lslatnds.-The Philippine Islands are eomposed of not less than 3,000 islands and islets covering an area of approximately 150,000 square miles, about the same as that of the five New England States and the State of New York combined. The total length of the general coast line, measured on small-scale charts using 3:mile spaces of dividers and omitting islands and bays less than 3 miles long, is approximately 10,850 miles, or about the same as that for the entire Atlantic coast of the United States, including the islands. About 75 per cent of this shore line has been completed. The unsurveyed hydro~raphy covers a large area on account of the necessity of extendmg this work, in some localities, for many miles offshore, and on account of the very extensive area of the Sulu Sea. It is estimated that about 50 per cent of this class of work has been completed. The unsurveyed regions are as follows: The northeast coast of Luzon from Polillo Island northward to Aparri; the region off the north coast of Luzon, including tlu~ Babyan Islands, Balintang Channel, the Batan Islands, and Bashi Channel; the entire west coast of the island of Palawan, the west coast. of Mindanao, from Blanca Point south to Zamboanga; the south coast of Mindanao, from Pola Point to Malita, in Davao Gulf; the Sulu Archipelago and the Sulu Sea from Cuyos south to the limit' of our possessions off the coast of Borneo. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) · 79. Northeast coast of Luzon..-This entire unsurveyed region, from Polillo Island on the south to Aparri on the north, is of little commercial importance, and being quite free from dangers to riavi-" gation, the execution of the w,ork is being delayed un~il more important localities are completed. Little reliable information relating to this region is available, but a number of go,od anchorages have been reported. Among these are the inner harbor of Port San Vincente, Dilasac Bay, Casiguran Sound, and Dingalan Bay. The first and third mentioned are excellent typhoon harbors. The work must, however, be done during the season of frequent typhoons, it being impossible to approach the coast at any other time of the year on account of the heavy sea caused by the northeast monsoon. (See fig. 24, opposite p. ~6.) · 80. Off north coast of Luzon..-A survey should be made of the islands and the waters to the northward of Luzon as far as Bashi Channel, as, in accordance with the numerous reports, there is considerable uncertainty in regard to the true 1.oca.tion of the islands and the rocks that are dangerous to navigation in the locality. As it is in the region visited by frequent typhoons, the work should be undertaken during the period when the typhoons are less frequent. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) 81. West and east coast of Palawatn.-The coast line of the island of Palawan is very irregular, indented with deep bays forming some

of the finest harbors in the Archipelago. The whole region about the island and extending southward to Bala.bac Island, Banguey Island, to Cagayan Sulu, and off the north coast of Borneo consists of coral reefs, many small islets, and innumerable hidden dangers to navigation. To the westward of Palawan, reefs and dangers extend to over 100 miles offshore. The hydrographic survey of this region involves an immense amount of labor. A preliminary survey for the location of channels throu~h the reefs and entrances to harbors will first be necessary, after which these localities must be swept with the wire drag. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) 82. 1l'est coa,st of Mindanao.-The necessity of the survey of this unfinished portion of Mindanao, from Blanca Point to Zamboanga, a stretch of about 150 miles, is not urgent, as the region is .of no c,ommercial importance and is considered to be free from dangers to navigation. The coast is bold and rocky, exposed to both the northeast and the southwest monsoons, and there are only a few months in the year before the change in the monsoons thM are favorable for work in this region. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) 83. South coa,st of Mi"ndamao.-This stretch of about 160 miles, from Pola Point to Malita in Davao Gulf, involves no great difficulty. The coast, in general, is bold and steep with numerous outlyin.!.t reefs which, however, do not extend a great distance from shore. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) 84. Sulu Archipelago.-This region, about 75 miles wide, extending in a southwesterly direction from Zamboanga on the southern coast of Mindanao, to the coast of Borneo, a distance of about 180 miles, has scattered over it about 300 islands and islets and numerous hidden dangers to navigation. It requires a survey of the most careful and intricate character, and much ,of the locality must be swept with the wire drag. The formation is coral and dangerous to navigation, as rocks are frequently found in localities where they are least expected to exist. The currents in the region are very strong. The physical conditions are such that excellent contr,ol to coordinate the work with that along the coast of Mindanao can be obtained. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.) 85. Bulu Sea.-The northern end, as far south as the Tubbataha Reefs, except certain small areas, has been surveyed with a fair degree of accuracy, but owing to the coral formations, where hidden dangers frequently exist, wire-drag sweeping will be necessary in selected passages. The entire region to the south of the Tubbataha Reefs remains unsurveyed except for a reconnoissance with approximate locations by navigational methods. Numerous rocks and reefs dangerous to navigation are scattered throughout the sea, but certain well-defined passages have been examined with sufficient accuracy to make navigation through them reasonably safe. (See fig. 24, opposite p. 66.)
GEODETIO SURVEYS.

The foregoing is a general review of the condition of our hydroe;mphic ~nrvey. A general discussion of the condition of our geodetic survey follows. It has been the purpose of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for some years to extend its geodetic work so as to have control available for all Government, State, city, and private engineers and surveyors.

68

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.,

There are many cities to-day whose maps will be placed on the wrong datum with respect t.o both elevations and positions as a result of the lack of primary triangulation and precise leveling in the interior of the country. Every city of any size and every State of the Union should be furnished bv the Federal Government with the fundamental control of which can be based surveys and maps of detailed character in any particular locality. It is difficult to overestinmte the necessity of having a proper amount of horizontal and ''ertical control in this country :for the use of map makers, surveyors, and civil engineers. For this purpose triangulation and precise leveling bench marks should be placed within 50 miles of each place in the United States. 'Vith the Federal control carried to this extent it would be a very simple matter in the future to have detailed control placed in many areas just ahead of the smTeyors and engineers who are to make the surveys and maps. This main control should be extended as rapidly as equipment and personnel of th~ Coast and Geodetic Survey will permit, and say, within five or six years, should be practically completed as far as the main part of the work is concerned. It is, of course, difficult to give exact figures to show how much leveling and triangulation will be needed to finish the :minimum that is essential, because plans must be changed from time to time to meet the need of the topographic engineers, but it is reasonably certain that the primary triangulation and precise leveling which should be done within the next five years will cost about $1,725,000. It is therefore believed that Congress should be asked to furnish for the geodetic work one-fifth of that amount each year, or about $345,000 per annum. With this distance of 50 miles as a criterion it can be seen that lines of precise leveling and arcs of primary triangulation would be approximately 100 miles apart. When it is considered that this distance is equal to that between Philadelphia and Baltimore or Philadelphia and New York is it realized that this is not an excessive amount of control. This estimate of fundamental control is made with a view to covering all of the country with a fair distribution of the control and later to filling in the intermediate areas as the demands of surveyors and engineers arise. The amount of geodetic control in the United States at the present time is as follows: (See fig:. 31.)

'We have many needs for accurate control and accurate maps. The principal one of these is probably for Federal, State, city, and highway engineers. There will be hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year in the United States in building new roads and in maintaining and improving old ones. · It is reasonably certain that this

road work could be done at a considerable saving if the country through which the road work is carried on were l?roperly mapped. The total cost of mapping the country topographically will be not more than $100,000,000, and this is the amount which will be spent on roads every three months for probably 10 years. It would certainly be good policy to have the maps precede the building of i;oads rather than to have them follow. It is planned to have primary triangulation done during the next year in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, Ore·gon, and Idaho. Lweling should be done now in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico; Texas, vVyoming, Montana, Arizona, Iowa, and 'Visconsin. . : Astronomic work is to be done in the States where. primary triangulation is done. / Gravity work will be done principally in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska. The magnetic work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has grown out of the practical needs of the navigator and the surveyor: With the development of long-distance aviation, the demands of the aerial navigator are added to those of the ocean navigator. The ultimate object of the survey of the coast of a country is the construction and distribution of charts showing the hydrographic and topographic features and other information needed by the mariner for the safe navigation of the adjacent waters. When no landmarks or heavenly bodies are visible, the navigator must depend upon the compass to guide him on his way. Unfortunately the compass needle does not in general point due north nor is its direction at any particular place constant. In the United States, for example1 the compass points 22<> west of north in the northeastern part ot Maine and 25 ° east of north in the northwestern part of Washington. In Porto Rico the compass needle now \points 1° 30' more to the west than it did 10 years ago. It is evident, therefore, that a knowledge of the variation of compass or the magnetic declination, as it is better to call it, is one of the essential features of a chart, and in order that a chart may be serviceable for a number of years it must give not only the declination at some particular date, but also the rate of change. Nearly all of the original land surveys of the United States were made by compass, and the boundaries in the deeds were defined by compass bearings. With the lapse of time, land values increased and controversies arose as to the location of boundary lines which had not been marked or of which the markings had disappeared. In order to retrace the lines of a tract of land surveyed originally by compass, the surveyor must know the change in the direction of the compass needle; that is, the change in the magnetic declination between the date of the original survey and of the resurvey. To meet the demand for information of this kind the Coast and Geodetic Survey took up the study of the secular change of the elements of the earth's magnetism and of the magnetic declination in particular. A collection was made of all the available results of magnetic observations in the United States and a few foreign countries, paying particular attention to results at places where observations had been made more than once. Observations were made from time

70

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAS'l~ AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

to time at many of these " repeat" stations in order to keep the secular change data up to date. From a discussion of all the available material and a comparison with similar data for places in Europe at which more extended 'observations had been made, it was possible to prepare tables fiving the secular change of the magnetic declination in all parts o the United States from the time of the earliest observations, tables which have many times stood the test of comparison with the observed changes of bearings of welldefined' boundary lines, with the result that the Coast and Ge9detic Survey has come to be recognized as ultimate authority in landhoundary controversies involvmg the secular change of the magnetic declination. In view of the difficulty experienced in attempting to retrace the lines of old compass surveys, accentuated at times by instrumental errors due to imperfect construction or lack of proper care, it became important to guard against a similar condition regarding present-day compass surveys, by determining in as great detail as available funds would permit, the distribution of the magnetic declination throughout the country and in secular change, at the same time providing local surveyors with meridian lines or other means of testing their compasses. The importance of a magnetic survey of the country to meet these needs was recognized at the time of the reorganization of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1843, but it was not until 1899 that the necessary funds became available for taking up this work systematically. The plan for the magnetic survey for the United States, as laid down in 1899, provided for a first general survey with stations 30 or 4.0 miles apart, to be followed by a more detailed investigation of regions where the general survey indicated irregular distribution of the earth's magnetism. The plan also included the reoccupation at intervals of five years of a sufficient number of " repeat" stations to determine the change of the magnetic elements with lapse of time, and the operation of magnetic observatories for·determining in more detail the changes in the direction and intensity of the earth's magnetic field, and the accumulation.of the data needed for the study of the nature and cause of the phenomenon. Following this general plan, the distribution of stations has been made largely upon the county subdivisions of the States, the idea being to have one magnetic station in each county so that the necessary data might be available for the use of the county surveyors in testing their compasses. With this end in view, most of the stations have been marked in a permanent manner and true bearings of prominent objects have been determined. In many cases meridian lines have been established for greater convenience of the local surveyors. Observations have been made at all but about 130 of the county seats and a number of areas of marked local disturbance have been examined for detail. The density of the distribution of the stations corresponds in a general way with the density of the population, so that in the unsettled and less accessible portions of the country they are widely scattered, but for the whole United States the average distance between stations is 25 to 30 miles. About 75 repeat stations a year have been occupied. Magnetic observatories ·have been in continuous operation at Cheltenham, Md., since 1901;

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

71

at Sitka, Alaska, and near Honolulu, Hawaii, since 1902; Vieques, P. R., since 1903; at Baldwin, Kans., from 1900 to 1909; and near Tucson, Ariz., since 1909. In Alaska the magnetic survey has gone on iri conjunction with other branches of the work of the Bureau, so that the observations have been for the most part confined to the seacoast, except for a series of stations along the Yukon River, and a series of observations secured by the parties surveying the one hundred and forty-first meridian boundarJ7 line. A general magnetic survey of Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islands has been completed and some observations have been made in Guam and on the Canal Zone. In the United States proper there still remain many locally disturbed areas which require investigation, the extent to which the investigation should be carried in any particular case being a question which can not be determined in advance. There are other regions where more stations will be required as they become settled. In addition, in order that the accumulated results may continue to be of use, observations at repeat stations must be kept up regularly. Most of the leading nations of the world are cooperating in a study of the earth's magnetism, in an effort to determine its origin, the cause of its many fluctuations, and the laws which govern them. Some of these fluctuations require a long term of years for their full development. In order that accurate data may be available for these investigationstfil'ierefore, many magnetic observatories must be kept in continuous ~ration, recording every change in the direction and intensity of tl\e:r;earth's magnetic field. . As the changes are found to be different 'rn different parts of the earth, it is important to have the observatories as widely distributed as possible. The United States, by reason of its wide extent of territory, is very favorably situated for carrying on a large share of this work, and the sites of the five magnetic observatories now in operation were chosen with this object in view. With the addition of observatories in the Canal Zone and on the island of Guam we should have a chain of stations extending nearly half way around the globe from longitude 65° to 216° west, and extending from latitude 9° to 57° north. These would be supplemented by the observatory near Manila, P. I., now being maintained by the Jesuits.

Part III.-WAR WORK OF THE BUREAU.
SUMMARY OF WAR WORK OF THE,BUREAU.

This Bureau bore an important burden during the war, both in the field and in the office. All told, 272 men, drawn both from the field and the office, took part in the war. These were drawn from all ranks o:f our employees, ranging from the Superintendent o:f the Bureau to temporary hands ·employed by the field parties o:f the :Bureau. In our report :for 1918 we gave a list of those from this Bureau in the War Department and in the Navy Department 'Yith their ranks, but as some o:f them had attained higher ranks by· the close o:f the war, it seems proper to again repeat the list giving the now correct ranks. In my report for 1918 I gave the names only o:f those who were c011m1issioned either in the Army or the Navy.

This Bureau also contributed five 0£ its survey vessels to the fleets operated by the Navy. One 0£ our vessels, the Surveyor, was employed on convoy duty to and from Mediterranean ports. While on one 0£ these trips, a convoy was attacked by two German submarines, one 0£ which was the famous U-39 which sunk the Dusitania. The U-39 fired a torpedo at the fleet which grazed the bow 0£ the Surveyor and was visible from the deck of that vessel. The wake of the submarine was picked up by the Swrveyor and she was able to get in a position for favorable discharge of the depth charge. As the Surveyor was unable to leave the convoy, she was unable to return and finish the submarine, but did succeed in disabling her to the extent that the submarine was compelled to enter Cartag~na, Spain, and intern there. Another of our vessels, the I sis, was on duty at New Yrok as flagship of commandant, squadron 2, cruiser force, from November 16, 1917, to October 14, 1918, and was on duty at Yorktown and Hampton Roads as flagship of division-4, battleship force 1, from October 15, 1918, to April 1, 1919. A third one of

our vessels, the Bache, was assigned to squadron 5 of fifth naval district, and. performed general salvage work, outside patrol, and guard-ship duties off Virginia Capes. Her primary duty was identification and passing of all inbound. and outbound vessels. She was the means of communication between naval authorities and these vessels. She handled mail and gave medical assistance to passing vessels, and performed important salvage operatiqns. Two other vessels of the Bureau were in the naval service on the Pacific coast. They were the. Explorer and the Patterson (renamed the Forward). These vessels were assigned to patrol duty in Alaskan waters. Besides this direct assistance to the military branches of the Government by the contribution of men and vessels, this Bureau rendered valuable aid to both these branches through the efforts of its field and office force. In the field, this assistance consisted in furnishi.ng certain control for maps in critical areas selected by the chiefs of military mapping of the Corps of Engineers of the Army. These areas were in Texas, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. The work was chiefly triangulation, traverse, and leveling. Special hydrogra phic examinations were made by means of the wire drag at points designated by the Navy Department. Among such were the wire-draa surveys in Long Island Sound and in York River (Chesapeake :Say). Quite an extensive wire-drag examination was made of the waters in the vicinity of Eastport, Me. Initial surveys included such work as the location of points for naval fire-control experiments, the reestablishment of the speed-trial course at Lewes, Del., for torpedo-boat destroyers, the location o:f the Port Jefferson trial course in Long Island Sound, and the Block Island (Rhode Island) trial course. !Some divisions o:f the office were engaged almost exclusively on work that would be o:f use to the Army and Navy during the war. This work consisted o:f the computation o:f precise traverse, and o:f several grades of triangulation and of precise levelin~ executed within areas selected by the division of military mapprng of the Corps of Engineers of the Army. Magnetic data were supplied to various Army and Navy organizations, and to persons engaged on investigation of the submarine problem. Another important accomplishment in connection with the war was the :furnishing of our nautical publications, consisting of charts, coast pilots, tide tables, for the use of our naval vessels, our Merchant Marine, and the vessels under the control of the Army, and the Railroad Administration. This service has 103 years of active history which show that it has never :failed in loyalty, no matter what the call. Its members have always given the benefit o:f their trained thought and well-informed judgment whenever and wherever they were needed and however they could best be used. In the great conflict just ended these traditions have been upheld. . Admiration is due the spirit that has animated each and every member of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. To a man there was an instant and eager response to the country's ca11 for help. At all times, a service which is laboring for the safety of mankind, it

stood ready to l1ndertake new work. The kind of work needed was varied-all could not go into battle. The men in-the field would have been urnless without the executive work behind them at home, and all honor is due them,_ who, showing a steady, uncompromising moral courage, unmoved by clamor and undisturbed by outer excitement, have kept steadily at their posts, carrying on most successfully the important and necessary work here. Those who were sent-to the field were simply performing their duty in another way, and established an enviable and remarkable record:, showing again their unusual adaptability and training. · The Bureau was about equally represented in both Army and Nary and performed signal valuable service in each.

Part IV.-STATEMENT FOR THE PAST YEAR OF ACCOMPLISHED FIELD AND OFFICE WORK, ACCOMPANIED BY ILLUSTRATIONS, AS REQUIRED BY STATUTE, SHOWING THE PROGRESS MADE, ETC.
DIVISION OF HYDROGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY.

The division of hydrography and topography has supervision of all hydrographic and topographic surveys executed by this Bureau, which supervision includes the determination of where surveys or resurveys are required, how they shall be conducted, the preparation of instructions for surveying parties, the organization of the parties, and the inspection of the field work, and examination of the records. It is also charged with the construction, maintenance, and repairs of the vessels and other field equipment, except instruments, the records of the personnel employed on this work, the compilation of the coast pilot in the field and office, the observation of tides and currents, and compilation of tide tables. For administrative purposes, the_ division is divided into four sections, known as the section of field work, section of vessels and equipment, section of coast pilot, and section of tides and currents. Each 9f ~hese s_ections is u~der the ~irection of a hy?-rographic and geodetrc engmeer, who is responsible for the efficient and economical administration of his section under the general supervision of the chief of the division of hydrography and topography. The division also has supervision over the five field stations located at Boston, New York, New Orleans, Seattle, and San Francisco, respectively, and over the office at Manila, P. I. The field stations are for the purpose of maintaining close relations between the Bureau and those who have occasion to use its charts, publications, and data, and to keep the Bureau informed of the needs for further work in these general localities. They are in charge of hydrographic and geodetic engineers, but undertake no surveys unless specifically directed to do so by this office. 'rhe Manila office performs all of the functions of a field stiition, and in addition, has direct charge of all surveys .in the Philippine Islands and much of the office work incident to these surveys. This office is in charge of a hydrographic and geodetic engineer, with the title of Director of Coast Surveys. This report gives a general statement of the work performed during the year under the direction of the division by the various field parties, the field stations, the Manila office, and finally, a resume of the work of the four sections. Detailed statements are given in the reports of the chief of sections attached hereto, and by the chief of parties already submitted. ·
MILITARY WORK.

A very large part of the tol?ographic, hydrographic, and wire-drag work of the Bureau done durmg the fiscal year, was at the request of the Navy Department to meet urgent military· needs. The Bureau
77

f8

and its field parties,. including field stations, cooperated closely with the Navy and War Departments in the matter of supplying charts and other information, the execution of surveys for the establishment of camp sites, and manufacturing plants, and to brin_g charts up to date, and in the marking of obstructions to navigation. Frequent consultations and correspondence were carried on at Washington with the various bureaus of the War and Navy Departments relative to the work req_uired, and in the field, the parties cooperated to the fullest extent with local military authorities. The steamers Bache, Explorer, Isis, Patterson and Surveyor, turned over to the Navy during the previous fiscal year, continued operations as war vessels until the termination of hostilities, and were then returned to this Bureau under authority of Executive order of February 26, 1919. The same Executive order returned to duty in this Bureau all those officers who had been detailed during the war for duty with the War and Navy Departments. Some of these officers went into the Navy with the vessels on which they were s~rving at the time of the vessel transfer, but many· of them went directly to the Navy and Army from the Washington office, the field stations, and from various field parties. The return of these officers, as well as the vessels, although designated for not later than April 1, 1919, was in many cases delayed by unavoidable conditions until near the end of the fiscal year.
NEW VESSELS AND LAUNCHES.

The Bureau has received by transfer from the Navy Department, five vessels of various sizes ranging from 100 tons to 400 tons. displacement, and has the promise of two other vessels of 500 tons and 600 tons displacement, respectively, to be transferred early in the next fiscal year. The vessels received to date are the steamers Arctu'J"US, Onward, Ranger, and Wenonah, and the motor vessel Natoma. The steamers Lyilonia, and SiaUa, _are to be transferred later on. All these are former yachts that were acquired by the Navy, fitted and used as patrol boats, and in the suppression of enemy submarines. On the termination of hostilities, they were no longer required by the Navy, and were, therefore, turned over to this Bureau for use as sur-· vey craft until more suitable vessels could be had. The Navy also transferred to this Bureau eight miscellaneous motor boats, six of them of the cabin-cruiser pleasure-boat type, and two of them of the work-boat type. These launches will be used for wire-drag operations, and for ch.art revision, and will help to eliminate the former necessity of hiring launches. Contracts were made during the year for the construction of four 60-foot wire-drag l?llide launches, 'and for three 30-foot wire-drag launch tenders. All of the guide launches, and one of the tenders were completed and put into service before the close of the year. A fourth tender was purchased, and equipped with a new engine. Bids were obtained by the U.S. Shipping Board, Emergency Fleet Corporation, for the construction of two 1,000-ton surveying vesE?els of the SwNJeyor type. No award has been made owing to the disinclination of the Emergency Fleet Corporation to authorize the conliltruction without further authority.

Field stations.-Field stations of the Survey, each in charge of a field officer of the Bureau, were maintained at Boston, New York, and New. Or~eans, where there is kept a stock of charts, and also other pubhcat10ns of the Survey an,d of the Bureau of Lighthouses for consultation and for sale. The stations cooperate with the sales agents of the 'Bureau by furnishing them charts and other publications to meet immediate needs. The inspectors at these stations have for their principal duty the inspe~tion of the navigable waters within their districts, for the purpose of keeping charts and other nautical publications of the Bureau corrected to date. The routine duties of the field station are handled by a clerk. The following special assignments were made to the inspectors at Boston, New York, and New Orleans during the year, in addition to the duties of the field stations: The inspector at Boston continued the field examination of the coast between Gloucester and Boston, preparatory to undertaking the field work of making a chart revision of this locality for use on a large-scale chart of this area, which is urgently needed, especially of the important harbor of Lynn, Mass. ·Also, a field revision of the topography of this section was made. A field party under an inspector revised the triangulation and topography between Manchester and Boston. The inspector also cooperated with the commandant of the first naval district in the installation of apparatus for observing currents, and furnished instructions in the method of taking and recording observations. The inspector at New York executed a supplementary triangulation at Sandy Hook, requested by the Navy Department in connection with the proving grounds for heavy ordnance; completed the computatioll" of triangulation on the coast of New Jersey for the Army and Navy; cool?erated with the Army Engineers in the determination of the posit10n of three towers at Fort Tilden; and completed special tidal data for Brooklyn and other newspapers. Supervision was also exercised ·over the permanent tidal station maintained by the Bureau at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor. The inspector at New York cooperated with the commandant of the third naval district in the installation of apparatus for observing currents, and furnished instructions in the method of taking and recording observations. At the close of the fiscal year the inspector was engaged on a tidal current survey of New York Harbor. The inspector of the Bureau at New Orleans cooperated in an advisory capacity with the board of advisory engineers of the Public Belt Railroad Commission appointed to report upon the physical and financial feasibility of a Mississippi River railroad crossing at, or in the vicinity of, New Orleans, together with terminal imprqvements collateral thereto. The inspector verified the topography in the vicinity of Pascagoula, Miss., in October, and in January, 1919, he was at Mobile, Ala., executing the ne.cessary field work to furnish up-to-date information for charts, and installing apparatus for observing currents on Heald Bank Light Vessel. In February, he accompanied the superintendent of lighthouses on an inspection. trip from Morgan City to New Orleans, proceeding by the outside route

to Grand Pass Timbalier, and thence by the inside route to New Orleans. Vessels.-The steamer Bache was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on June 20, 1919, after completion of repairs by the Navy Department. No field work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year, but the necessary tall hydrographic signals were in the course of erection, and arrangements had been completed for the placing of buoys, prior to beginning offshore hydrography. off the entrance of Chesapeake Bay. On authorization by the Navy Department the Bache was furnished with one 24-foot coast guard motor launch, in place of the motor whaleboat formerly on this vessel, and two new coast guard whaleboats, which will give her a better boat equipment than she had prior to transfer to the Navy. The steamer I sis was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on April 30, 1919. After receipt of the vessel by this Bureau, several tu),>es gave wny in both boilers, and it was necessary to take the vessel to a shipyard for renewal of the tubes. No field work was in progress at the close of the fiscallear, but the necessary tall hydrographic signals have been erecte , and arrangements made for the placing of buoys, f9r beginning the offshore hydrography off the entrance of Delaware- Bay. The steamer Hydrographer was employed during the first half of the year on surveys of the lower part of Chesapeake Bay, embracing the main channel of the bay, and approaches to Hampton Roads; to meet the ·needs of the Navy Department. On completion of re])airs early in January, the Hydrographer left Baltimore for Key West, where she is now working in cooperation with officers at the naval station. An improved type of sounding tube was tested with marked success in the dee2 waters of the Florida Straits. The schooner Matchless was employed on a survey of York River and approaches, continuing along the west shore of Chesapeake Bay to the vieinity of Hampton, and as far westward as Newport News. The hydrography included the area of Hampton Roads, and the inshore area between the Tail of the Horseshoe Light, and York River. This vessel also completed surveys in the vicinity of Wormley Creek, at the request of the Navy Department. After an inspection by a board appointed for the purpose, the Matchless was surveyed, condemned, and appraised, in accordance with authority granted on April 16, 1919, by the Secretary of Commerce. The vessel was sold on June 26, 1919. . The steamer Onward was received from the Navy De:partment on April 19, 1919, after completion of the necessary repairs, and the crew and equipment of the schooner M atahless were transferred to that vessel. This vessel has been employed on a continuation of the field work assigned to the schooner Matchless. The steamer Ranger was received from the Navy on April 28, 191'9. After completion of the necessary repairs she will take up offshore hydrography in the vicinity of Pensacola, Fla. A party attached to the vessel was engaged on work preparatory to the hy<lrographic survey of Gravesend Bay, New York Harbor. The work .of building tall hydrographic signals for the surveys westward of PensacoJa, Fla., was in progress at the close of the year, prior to the .arriYal of the steamer Ranger on the working ground. ·

PartieB._:Wire-drag party No. 1 was employed on surveys, requested by the Navy Department, off the easterly end of Long Island Sound, and the westerly end of Block Island Sound, including Fishers Island Sound. Strong currents retarded the progress of the work, and it was generally necessary to plan the work so as to drag in the direction of the current. At the request of the Navy Department, this :parj;y completed a wire-drag survey of-an area m the approach _to New Ll>ndon Harbor. Wire~drag party No. 2 continued the survey of the principal channel from the sea to Eastport, and Passamaquoddy Bay, and the survey of Passamaquoddy Bay to meet the needs of the Navy Department. The party maintained temporary buoys on the dangerous rocks found by the survey in the principal entrance to Eastport and Passamaquoddy Bay, until arrangements were made with the Lighthouse Service to establish permanent buoys. The Geodetic Survey of Canada cooperated with this party in signal building and triangulation. ~ . On completion of surveys in the vicinity of Eastport, M~. 2 ~he party wa11 employed on surveys along the outer coast m the v1cm1ty of Jonesport, Me., the work being designed primarily to meet the _ needs of the Navy Department. Wire-drag party No. 5 continued the survey of Block Island Sound. The work at Key West, originally assigned to this party, was discontinued in order to meet the immediate requirements elsewhere of the War and Navy Departments. At the request of the War Department, this party executed a resurvey of Southwest Ledge. A field party was employed on a triangulation and topographic revision survey of the-coast between Manchester and Boston, in con:(ormity with instructions issued to the inspector at Boston. This work is preliminary to the preparation of a chart on an adequate scale to cover this locality, including the harbor of Lynn. This party completed the shore line from Manchester to Magnolia, and the Chelsea River from Reve:re to Chelsea, and a topographic revision of the outlying islands. A field officer investigated the subject of coast surveying and revision by means of airplane photography in conjunction with aviators of the War and Navy Departments. This officer executed a trigonometric control for an Atlantic City, N. J., photographic survey, and at_ the close of the year was studying the photographs taken by Army and Navy fliers wl.th reference to this control. - A field officer established a trial course 1 nautical mile in· 1ength -in the vicinity of Anacostia, D. C., to meet the- needs of the Navy Pepartmen!z. that Department furnishing the necessary launches and material. µuring the latter part of the fiscal year this officer was employed on a tide and current survey in the vicinity of Point Judith, 'Block Island Sound. A field party was employed during the latter part of the year on a tide and current survey along the coast between Portsmouth, N. :H., and Portland, Me. A field party was employed on a hydrographic and topographic survey of the Turtle River, Ga., to the picric acid plant at Crispen Island to meet the needs of the construction division of the Army.

After examination by the chief of the division of hydrography and topography, it was found that a suitable revision of Charleston, S. C., and vicinity could be made within the limits of funds available for this work, and, in conformity with instructions, a field officer completed, with the assistance of the superintendent of lighthouses and other local authorities at Charleston, the requested triangulation. Local interests and Government officials showed a gratifying spirit of cooperation and interest in this work. A field party executed a systematic hydrographic and topographic survey of Key Biscayne Bay, and channels frqm.the sea, to Jp.eet the need of navigators and commercial interests at Mi!itmi, Fla. An officer inspected the tide and current survey parties working oif the coast of New England, and in Block Island Sound and vicinity, and tide station at Portland, Me. He also consulted with the inspector at New York relative to the tide and current.survey party being organized for work in New York Harbor. A field party has b~en employed on a triangulation and topographic survey of the Virgin Islands, requested by the Secretary of the Navy on August 28, 1917. This party is cooperating closely with the governor and other naval officials of the Islands, and good progress is being made in this work. The work on. St. Thomas and St. John is completed, and the party is now employed on St. Croix. The governor of the Islands has requested that a wire-drag survey be made in that vicinity as early as practicable.
FIELD WORK, PACIFIC COAST.

Field stations.-Field stations of the Survey, each in charge of a field officer of the· Bureau, were maintained at Seattle and San Francisco during the fiscal year, where there is a stock of charts and other publications of the Survey; and of the Bureau of "Lighthouses for . consultation and for sale. The stations cooperated with the sales agents of the Bureau by furnishing them charts and other publications to meet immediate needs. · The inspector has for his principal duty an inspection of the navigable waters within his district, for the purpose of keeping charts and other nautical publications of the Bureau corrected to date. The routine duties of the field station are handled by a clerk. The inspectors at the two Pacific coast field stations had charge of the arrangements for installing current-measuring apparatus on light vessels within their districts. Tidal and current observations have been in progress at the stations maintained by the field stations. The Seattle field station has served as the headquarters for the field parties operating in Washingtoi: and Alaska, and has rendered valuable assistance to the field parties. The inspector ·had charge of the preparation of plans and specifications of the vessel to replace the steamer T alcu, and issued specifications and plans, and opened bids for the construction of the vessel. A 1-mile speed·trial course was laid out by him on Lake Washington for immediate use of vessels under construction at that point. The inspector cooperated with the Navy Department at Puget Sound Naval Station, relative to the return of the steamers Ewplorer and Forward_ (Patterson), and three of the launches received from the Atlantic coast.

The inspector at San Francisco, assisted by local coast guard stations, was employed on a survey of Presidio Shoal on the northerly waterfront of San Francisco, made necessary by reports of, very much shoaler water than charted. Vessels.-The steamer Sialia is being repaired by the Navy prior to transfer to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. , , The steamer Wenonah was received from the Navy on April 12, 1919, after completion of the necessary r~pairs, and proceeded to the Pacific coast via the Panama Canal. This party will, on arrival; take up offshore hydrography in the vicinity of Cape Mendocino, and the survey of Humboldt Bay when weather ,conditions prevent outside work. The motor vessel Natoma was received from the Navy on April 9, 191~, after completion of the necessary repairs! and proceeded to the Pacific coast, via the Panama Canal. She will be U:sed on the re· survey of San Francisco 'Bay. . , The steamer Arcturus was received from the Navy on May 5, 1919, after completion of such repairs as the Navy was willing to make. At the close of the fiscal year, she was undergoing repairs that were necessary, due to the fact that repairs previously made were incorrplete. Vessels proceeding to the Pacific coast of the United States and to Alaska, with the exception -of the Natoma, were directed to take soundings, .and make oceanographic observations while en route, and the track to be followed by each vessel in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean was laid out in advance so that each would develop an unexplored track. The steamer Ewplore1· was returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on May 1, and the Forward (Patterson) was returned on , May 24. These vessels have been condemned, and will be sold. Parties.-A field party was employed on a systematic hydrographic and topographic revision survey of the Tacoma waterfront, to show the extensive improvements which have been made at that point. A field officer has been employed in arranging for rei;>airs to the launches received from the Navy, and shipped to the Pacific coast on Naval colliers to fit them for wire-drag and revision work on the ,Pacific coast. He is, also, preparing to begin wire-drag work in Lake Washington and Lake Union after July 1. A field officer was employed on a revision survey of Los Angeles Harbor to bring our charts up to date. A field party was employed on a hydrographic and topographic revision survey of Morro Bay, requested by local interests. After completion of the Morro Bay work, the party proceeded to Eureka, Calif., and took up the work of recovering and re-marking triangulation stations in that vicinity, and building the necessary .signals for the offshore work which will be done by the vessels 0£ the Bureau on their arrival from the Atlantic coast. A field part;y completed a wire-drag survey of Lake Tahoe to meet the needs of the United States Reclamation Service. This survey was limited to the shores where numerous bowlders and uncharted rocks were found. ,

FIELD WORK, ALASKA.

V essels.-A field party with the launch Cosmos completed a survey of the north end of Wrangell Strait in order to locate certain bowlders that have been reported in this important fairway. The improvised harbor sweep used on the Cosmos was carried away several times owing to the very strong currents, but lead-line development was checked by the sweep at critical points, enabling the party to complete the work in a satisfactory manner. .This party also made a suney of Keete Inlet, Cordova Bay, Alaska. The steamer Surveyor was returned by the Navy on April 1, 1919, .after completion of the repairs necessary to place the vessel in condition for survey work, and proceeded to Alaska, via the Panama Canal. At the cl9se of the fiscal year the vessel was at Seattle, repairing and ·outfitting for work on the south coast of the Alaska Peninsula. Parties.-A field party completed a survey of Port Chatham, Kenai Peninsula, to enable the Chrome Mining Co. to ship their product. From local reports, and information received from the Bureau of Mines, it appeared that the chrome-iron deposits in this locality are important, and that their production was a necessity for certain war products. Surveys were also completed by this party in Seldovia to locate the uncharted rock which had been reported by local interests in the vicinity of the wharf. A survey was made of Halibut Cove, Kachimak Bay, to enable fishing interests to ship their product, and Knik Arm in the approaches to the railroad terminal at Anchorage. Alaska, was surveyed. This work was done at the urgent request of the Alaskan Engineering Commission. An automatic tide gauge was established at Anchorage, to be operated by the Alaskan Engineering Commission, and tides were observed at that point.
FIELD WORK, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

The director of coast surveys, acting .under the authority of the makes plans for the work of the Survey in the Philippine Islands, issues detailed instructions to the field parties,. and has charge of the field station at Manila. The expenses of the work are met by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and Philippine Government, which also furnished three vessels for surveying purposes during the fiscal year. The steamer Pathfinder is furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. During the fiscal year, the Pa.thfinder, Romblon, and Fathomer were employed on surveys in the Philippine Islands. Work was done on the east coast of Palawan, and in the vicinity of Cuyo Islands in the northerly part of the Sulu Sea. While these vessels were undergoing repairs, launch parties were engaged on a. survey· of Laguna de Bay. The steamer Marinduque is temporarilv in' the service of the insular government, but will be returned to the jurisdiction of the Coast and Geodetic Survey about July 1. The officers for this vessel left San Francisco for Manila on May 25, 1919. The epidemic of influenza which occurred in the fall of 1918 seri-· onsly hampered the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. A numsuperintendent~

her of officers, and many of ihe crews of the vessels were stricken with the disease, seven deaths having occurred on the steamer Pathfi;nder alone.
MISCELLANEOUS FIELD WORK.

The question of aerial surveying is under consideration, and it is belie;ve.d useful service may be obtained in such localities as follows: Florida~ reefs·( for the purpose of locating co1;al heads). . .. Ten Thousand Islands, west coast of Florida between Cape Sable and Big Marco Pas!>. (These so-called Ten Thousand Island:; are embra.( ed within an enormous swamp where little or no solid land may be expected.) Delta of the Mississippi. (Aerial photographs could be used to fill in the details of the interior of the delta.) Suggestion has been made that the topographer should work with an airplane~ and photograph the country ns needed to put in the changes. Triangulation ( ould then be done as necessary to put in the landmarks for charts and other control points that might be needed to make full use of the photographs. Photographs could be taken of bodies of shallow water in order to determine the direction of the slues or channels leading between the extending shoals, anclthus verify and, if necessary, correct the charts. The above suggestions cover points where airplane hydrography can unquestionably assist in bringing our charts up to date. · . At the invitation of the British Admiralty, the chief of the divii:iion of hydrography and topography, and the chief of the section of field records, attended an international hydrographic conference at London, EnRland, during the latter part of June. In a letter from the (barged affairs ad interim dated June 4, 1919, the object of the conferen~ e is stated as follows:
To consider the udvisuhilit~· of ull maritime nat!om; adopting sini;.lar methods in the prepurution, construction. and production of their charts, und all hydrographic publicntions; of rendering tlie result!; in the most convenient form to ennble them to be re11<1ily use<!; of instituting a prom11t s.vstem of mutual e:xchnnge of hydrographic information between all countries; and of providing· for consultations and 1liscnsi"ions to be cal'ried out on h~·drographic subject.;. ge1wrally by the hydrogrnpbic ex1wrts of the world.
SI<:C'1'10N 01·' FIELD WORK.

The prinripa-1 duties of this section are the su:penision of topographic and hydrographic surveys, and coordination and standardization of the work of the various field parties, with a view to having a complete and continuous survey of the coast. All data pertaining to the locality in which work is .to be done are assembied, compared, and studied, and instructions prepared accordingly. Close touch .is kept with the field work through reports and sketches from the field par~y. . Data were t olle'. ted, and itemized memoranda prepared for 23 f.ds of instructions for field work. This embraced a careful study of existing surveys. Original field sheets covering areas where ( hanges frequentl:)1 occur, and where preliminary surveys only have been made, were reviewed in order to formulate plans for performing the necessary field work to bring the,- charts np to date. Com-

field sheets were reviewed, as time permitted, preparatory to recommending them for the approval of the superintendent. Owing to the unusual conditions that have prevailed, and the requirements of war work, and surveys that have been made a part of the National defense, the duties of the-chief section have embraced many matters not heretofore performed. The chief of the section of · vessels and equipment was transferred to the Navy Department for the period of the war, and during his absence the chief of this section acted as chief of the section of vessels and equipment. The principal items of work were in connection with the construction of the 60-foot wire-drag launches, and 30-foot tenders, proposals for the steamer to replace the Taku, and revision of specifications :for the new 1,000-ton steel surveying vessel.
SECTION OF VESSELS AND EQUIPMENT.

pl~ted

This se~tion is charged with the preparation of plans and specifications for new vessels and equipment, the care, maintenance and repair of existing vessels, and the records of seame:J¥ personnel. This - latter includes the examination of 'nearly all reports and returns, except pay accounts arid reports of survey work, required to be submitted by parties afloat. The section also examines and passes for approval of the chief of division and the superintendent the estimates of field expenses submitted by all parties afloat and ashore, and all contracts for lease and charter. A considerable part of the work of the section is inspection of vessels and equipment, and an effort is made to inspect thoroughly every vessel in the Survey, except those in the Philippine Islands, at least once annually, and the vessels on this coast at. least twice annually. Supervision of the Philippine vessels is maintained by means of r~ports from the director of coast surveys .. Until April 1, this section was under the direction of the chief of field work during the absence on Naval duty of the chief of section.
COAST-PILOT SECTION.

During November, 1918, the manuscrip~ of 'the Philippine Coast Pilot, Part 1, was read and sent to the prmters. To the end of the fiscal year, the work of the section included the reading of the page proofs of the Philipp~ne Coas~ Pilot. . . Reprints were obtamed during the year of Atlantic Coast Pilots, Sections D and E. Supplements for three volumes, and correction sheets for Sections C, D, E, California, Oregon, and Washington, and Alaska, Part 1, were issued. .The record of the issue of coast pilots ii;i re~ent years is interesting 'US indicating the usefulness of these pubhcat10ns. As these volumes are sold at a price sufficient to defray th~ cost of printing ( 50 cents), it is obvious that the number sold furmshes an accurate measure of the public demand.

Tidal observations were made throughout the year at seven permanent tidal stations along the Atlantic coast, two on the Gulf of Mexico, and three on the Pacific coast. In addition to these, obsel"vations were made in connection with hydrographic surveys in the United States, Alaska, and the Philippines. Tides were observed at 58 stations during the year, the total combined length of observations being 41 years, 6 months, 16 days. During the year all permanent tidal stations have been insrected at least once, the inspection in all cases including the connect10n of the tide staff of the station with the permanent bench marks by spirit levels. The work of making comprehensive tide and current surveys of our coasts, which was begun in the summer of 1916, was contmued during the fiscal year 1919, and parties were employed on the coast between Portsmouth, N. H., and Portland, Me., and off the entrance to Narr0ngansett Bay. ·The purpose of the tidal party is to obtain tidal information at important points along the coast, and the establishment of permanent tidal bench marks at all principal points along the coast, which will serve the public in all cases where a knowledge of tidal planes is required to furnish hydrographic parties with' standard data, and 11:fford starting and checking- points for lines of precise levels. The tidal survey is carried on by means of two automatic tide gauges, and several subsidiary staff's; current measurements are made by means of current meters, the velocity being obtained at v11rious depths at each station, and, also, by means of a vertical pole fl.oat. The purpose ·of the current survey is to obtain definite information concerning currents in navigable channels, entrances to bays, rivers, passages, and at points along the coast, for the benefit of navigators. Current observations were made at 57 stations (other than light vessels), the total combined length of observations being 5 monthl'I 18 days. . _ The manuscript for the tide tables for 1920 was prepared and submitted for printing in three separate parts, namely, the Atlantic Coast Tide Tables, which are already issued; the Pacific Coast Tide Tables, the proof 'of which has been read i and that part of the General Tide Tables which is not included m either of the two reprints, proof of which has not yet been received. These tables are similar to those for the past two or three years. The following table of issues shows the mcreased demand for these tide tables in recent years:

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, UOAST AND GEODETTO SURVEY.

DIVISION OF GEODESY.
J.<'IELD WORK.

The geodetic work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, almost fro1i1 the da,y that the United States entered the war until the,.armisti<e was signed, may well be called war work. All the resources of the diYi'sion of geodesy were placed at the disposal of the division of military mapping of the Corps of Engineers of the Army immediately afte·r the United Statt>s entered the war. The assistance of the division of geodesy was at'.cepted by the engineers, and plans were made to furnish ce1tain control for maps in critical areas selected by the chief of the division of military mapping. These areus were in Texas, Georgia, Florida, Routh Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. . Shortly after November 11, 1918, the divbion of military mapping of the Office of the Chief of Engineers lessened its support to the division of geodesy, nncl by the end of the fiscal year 1919 the assistanct> from the Army consisted of only a small fund from whi h to pay several computers nwking special computations of value to the division of military mapping.

·It is difficult to oYerestimatc the nc ess:ty of having a proper amount· of horizontal and verti< al control in this country for the use of map makers and other engineers. There is not the demand for . our geodetic control that there should be, and this is almost entirely due to the fact that the work of the Survey has not, in years past, been brought to the attention of those who l'Oulcl use the results. It has been the policy of the superintendent, ~or the last four years, to get the work of the Survey before the public in order that the surveyors, engineers, and others might know what is being a,ccomplished by the Bureau. This plan will be continued, and, in addition, literature will be distributed to the public which will show how the results of the Survey's_work might be best utilized. . This relates particularly to the matter of the geographic positions of triangulation stations. These are of great value to the private surveyor and engineer, and it is planned to have a pamphlet prepared which will show them to what extent they may utilize the latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the triangulation and traverse work. It is noteworthy that the engineering colleges are emphasizing the need of control for surveys, and this will have a marked effect in increasing the demands on the Bureau for geodetic work.
NEED FOR MAPS.

The Army has been using maps as never before in its work, both in this country and abroad, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey can look forward to a greater utilization of its products as a result of the numbers of men who were in the Army going back to civil life, and demanding good maps. Aside from the value o:f these results in mapping for military purposes, there are many other needs for accurate control, and accurate

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

89

maps. The principal use of these js probable for the Federal, State, city, and highway engineers. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent each year in the United States in building new roads~ and in maintaining and improving old ones. .It is reasonably certain that this road work could be done at a considerable saving, if the country through which the roaid W?rk is carried on were pro.Perly ·mapped. The total coast o:f mapplI1g· the country topographically will be not more than about $100,000,000, and this is the amount which will be spent on roads every three months for, probably, 10 years. It would certainly be good policy to have the maps precede the building of roads, rather than to have them follow such operations. . The railroad engineers are, also, particularly interested in good maps, and it is reasonably certain that, with the development of our railroads in the future, to meet the needs of industry and commerce, good topographic maps would be of great value in enabling the work to be accomplished in an efficient manner.
AIRPLANE SURVEYING.

Th(Jre has been much talk, in recent months, in regard to snne:ving the country from airplanes. This is a subject in which the Coast and Geodetic. Survey is much interested, because it seems probable that the airplane can be used to a great extent in revising the topography along the shores of the country, and in some parts of thH interior, and also in making original surveys. The Coast and Geodetic Survey is not directly interested in airplane surveying of the interior of the country, but the Survey will certainly be exp-ected to have control extended over the interior of the country, that airplane maps can be properly made, and located at many places.
EXTENSION OF GEODETIC
OONT~OL.

It has been the plan of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for some years to extend its geodetic work so as to have control available for all Government, State, city, and private engineers and surveyors. '1,'here are many cities to-day whose maps will be placed on the wrong datum, both for elevation and position, as a result of lack of primary triangulation and :precise levelin~ in the interior of the country. Every city of any size, and every State of the Union should be furnished by the Federal Government with the fundamental control on which can be basecl the surveys and maps of detailed cha1·acter in any particular locality. There can be no question that triangulation and precise leveling hen.ch marks shoul? be placed within 50 miles .of each :place in t~e Umted States. With the Federal control carried to this extent, it would be a very simple matter in the future to have detailed control placed in many areas just ahead of the surveyors and engineers who are to make the surveys and maps. This main control should b~ extend~ as rap~dly as equipment. and personnel of the S'?-rvey . will permit, and w1thm say five or six years should be practically completed as far as the main part o:f the work is concerned. It is, of course, difficult to give exact figures as to how much leveling and triangulation will be needed to finish the minimum that is essential,

because plans must be changed ftom time to time to meet the needs of the topographic engineers; but it is reasonably certain that the primary triangulation and precise leveling which should be done within the next five years will cost about $1,000,000. With this distance of 50 miles as a criterion1 it can be seen that lines of precise leveling, and arcs of primary triangulation should be approximately 100 miles apart. When it is considered that this distance is equal to that between Philadelphia and Baltimore, or Philadelphia and New York, it is realized that this is not an excessive amount of control. This estimate of fundamental control is made with a view to covering all of the country with a fair distribution of the control, and later to filling in the intermediate areas as the demands of sur-veyors and engineers arise. Nothing is more conducive to proper commercial and industrial development of the country than good maps, and money spent in making them should be considered by the Nation as an investment rather than as a running expense. This country adopted a broad plan, based on sound scientific and engineering principles, in the manner of controlling its maps. The only thing lacking is support in the way of money, and personnel to put the plan into operation. .
ADOPTION OF STANDARD GEODETIC CONTROL.

The plan is to have all public surveys and maps based on some one initial point. The decision to have the single system of coordinates for the United States was adopted by the Survey about 20 years ago, and it is looked upon as a matter to be imitated by the geodetic .surveys and map makers of other countries. The system seems to have worked out so well that the same initial point, used in the United States for its surveys and maps, has been adopted by the Governments of Mexipo and of Canada. We shall, therefore, see the whole North American Continent placed on a single datum. This is far ahead of the condition of affairs in any other part of the world. But while the general plan adopted has been of such splendid character, there are few countries :in the world that claim to be highly developed, that have less control per square mile than the United States. In this matter, the United States is really far behind all of the European countries, except, possibly, Russia and the Balkan :States. Japan, for instance, is entirely covered by triangulation of a very high standard of accuracy, and the leveling is very much more .extensive in proportion to the area than in the United States. With a good plan adopted as far as control is concerned, it is most earnestly hoped that Congress will come to the relief of the Survey, and ·make it possible to have the minimum amount of control that seems justified, done within the next few years. It has been found that other organizations of the Government have needed control much ahead of the ability of the Coast and ~eodetic. Survey to supply it. It is not considered a good plan to . allow this control work to drag. It would really be better if all survey funds used in the interior of the country were concentrated for at least a year on geodetic work,. in order that control might be furnished. This money would bear good results in the way of making .

it possible to have surveys and maps made in a more efficient manner than is now possible.
CONTROL ALONG THE COASTS.

The Corps 0£ Engineers, United States Army, has, as one of its functions, the preparation of special military maps for the defense -of the country and for other purposes. Most of the maps made for that organization will be close to the shores of the, count~y. The control that will be used on those maps will be largely' tRe 'tertiary triangulation along the coast done by the United States 'Coast and Geodetic Survey. That triangulation is, in some cases, in bad condition due to the loss of .station marks from the erosion of the. shores, and the works of man. It is therefore desirable that parties be sent along all of the coasts of the United States to make an inspectio.n of the triangulation data. It is believed that at least once in 10 years the triangulation should be visited and supplemented. During such an inspection the position of any permanent object that can be used in surveying work by the navigator should be determined.
GRAVITY WORK.

During the past two fiscal years no gravity work was done by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The pendulums are considered to-day to be of some importance in connection with the possible location of oil-bearing rocks. l'n cooperation with the United States Geological Survey. it was planned, just. before the war, to make certain gravity campaigns in Texas, Oklahoma,· an.d parts of Kansas, with a view to testing whether or not the pendulum could be used in detecting oilbearing rocks. It is hoped that this investigation will be resumed in the very near future, and for this purpose two sets of nickel-steel or invar pendulums are now being made in the instrument section of this office. With these pendulums it will be possible to observe the intensity of the gravity at any place. At present it is necessary, on account 'of the high coefficient of expansion of the old pendulums, to locate the gravity station in a room of constant. temperature. This is usually the 'basement of some public or private building. On account of the necessity of having to swing the pendulum in a constant-temperature room it. has been found that the points at which gravity can be observed, using the old pendulums, are very limited in number. It is intended to resume the gravity observations soon after the beginning of the fiscal year 1920.
WAR RECORD.

The war record of the division of geodesy is a most excellent one. Those of its members who did not actually enter the military service of the Government were engaged continuously on work called for by the Army and Navy. . At the end of the war all except two of the permanent employees of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, engaged either in the field or the office work of the division of geodesy, returned to the Survey. Men of the type engaged in the field force of this Survey, and the computing and drafting forces of the office, form a suitable body of

92

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

men from whom the Army and Navy can draw officers for technical work in time of war. It is, therefore, expedient that these forces be kept up to a high standard of efficiency, both as to the number and the quality of the men, in order that they may be of the greatest value when called to military service.
PIELD WORK ACCOMPLISHED.

Below is given a list of the pieces of work which were done during the fiscal year 1919. At the beginning of the fisC'al year 1919, a precise traverse party was working in South Carolina, on a line which extends from Savannah, Ga., to Norfolk, Va. A line of precise traverse was exe::uted southward in North Carolina, to meet the above work in the vicinity of Sanford, N. C. 'Vhen the Savannah~Norfolk line was completed, at Sanford, an arc of primary triangulation was begun in northeastern North Carolina, to extend from the oblique arc to Sanf-0rd. A line of precise traverse was extended from Wilmington, N. C., .to a junction with the triangulation near Sanford. Owing to the fact that there are some inconsistencies in the precise traverse in Georgi1t, South Carolina, and North Carolina, which was done during the war in many cases by unskilled observers, it was found necessary to make an inspection of some of these lines. This work was done between July 1, 1918, and June 30, 1919. After the completion of the work in the Southeastern States, requested by the division of military mapping, Office of the Chief of Engineers, work was begun in TE)xas on an arc of primary triangulation which extends eastward from WM:o, Tex., to a junction with the Mississippi River. This work was also requested by the division of military mapping. A reconnoissance was made from the vicinity of Waco, Tex., eastward to the vicinity of Mansfield, La., and at-the end of·the fisco:l" year 1919, the reconnoissance and the .erection of the towers necessary to elevate the theodolite during the observations had been · completed. A party began observations for primaTy triangulation in the vicinity of Waco, Tex., and at the end of the fiscal year the work had been completed nearly to the vicinity of Mansfield, L~. A line of precise leveling was begun in the spring of 1919, in the vicinity of Hillsboro, Tex., which 'follows in a general direction the arc of primary triangulation that is being run eastward from Waco. A precise leveling party was engaged on a line of levels along the Rio Grande from the vicinity of Harlingen westward to Eagle Pass, Tex. That leveling was done along the country roads close to the river, and the work was difficult on account of poor roads, and the crossing of numerous streams, swollen by excessive rainfall. The party was fransported by two motor truclrs belonging to the Survey. Just before undertaking the leveling along the Rio Grande, a line of levels extending from Corpus Christi to New Orleans was GOmpleted. _ In the spring of 1919, the chief engineer of the Forest Service made a request on the Coast and Geodetic Survey, that certain con-

trol work be done by this Bureau in some of the forest reservations in Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and California. After consultation with officials of this Survey, and of the Forest Service, it was decided that, on account of the lack of Coast and Geodetic Survey funds which could be utilized to carry on the control in question, the Forest Service would place at the disposal of the Coast and Geodetic Survey an amount sufficient to start the control surveys before July 1, 1919. . .Aftt::r plans had been perfected at this office. ~ party was orga:nized m Arizona, and made . the necessary. reconnoISsance. At the end of the fiscal year, observing for triangulatfon was in progress. An officer took the field in Utah early in May, and made the necessary reconnaissance for the location of control stations for the Forest Service, and, at the end of the fiscal year, was ready to begin ol>serving. Valuable assistance was received from the members of t>he Forest Service in the reservations within which the work was done, in pre·paring and marking stations whose positions were to be determined. Late in the fiscal year instructions were issued for a line of precise levels to extend southward from Kirk, Oreg., to Roseville, Calif., in the vicinity of Sacramento. At the end of the fiscal year the party was being organized and equipped. A subparty was organized to operate under the general direction of the chief of party. Late in the fiscal· year precise leveling was begun along the line between Troy and Whitehall, N. Y. By the end of the fiscal year this line was completed, and leveling had been begun in the vicinity of Rouses Point, N. Y., working westward along the international boundary. The corn;I?letion of.the leveling between Troy and Whitehall finished a new hne of levels from Rouses Point to Troy. This line was begun several years ago, but the work was interrupted by the war. A field party was engaged on the . upper Chesapeake Bay during nearly the entire fiscal year in making a triangulation for the use of the officers of the ordnance department, United States Army, for the purpose of locating towers from which observations.are made to determine the range of guns. This work was done at the request of officers at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. During the progress of Lhe field work, the chief of party was assisted by details of men and the assignment of transportation from the Aberdeen Proving Ground. In the spring and early summer of 1919, a triangulation was made in the lower Potomac River for the purpose of determining geographic positions of range towers on a torpedo trial course. When the work was completed, this Bureau was requested to extend the triangulation to include the _determination of the geographic positions of a number of stations which would be of value to the ordnance department of the Navy in determining the range of its guns. At the request of the office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury, a survey was made of the grounds in the rear of the hygienic laboratory, October 19 to 22, 1918. The work consisted of taking elevations at 20-foot intervals. . In July, 1918, at the request of the officer in charge of the rifle range at Congress Heights, D. C., the eastern boundary line of the rifle range reservation was surveyed and marked.

During the first half of the fiscal year 1919, two officers were en-:gaged on the determination of the differences of longitude in Georgia,. South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. This work was. done in connection with the precise traverse for the purpose of furnishing corrections to observed astronomical azimuths resulting frorr(deflections of the v~rtical. Late in the spring of 1919, the same officer§ beo-an the determination of certain differences of longitude along the Rio Grande arc of primary triangulation, and were engaged on that work at the end of the fiscal year. The chief of the division of geodesy was in the Army, with rank of major of engineers, from August 17, 1918, to February 28, 1919. During that time he was assigned to the division of military mapping of the Office of the Chief of Engineers. While with the Army. his principal work was devising a special grid system for use in progressive mapping of the United States, and specifications for the special defense maps which,· it is expected, will be needed by the Army at critical points afong the coasts of the country. When the chief of the division of geodesy returned to the Survev from the Army,·he resumed his usual duties at this office. In addition he did considerable work with an interdepartmental committee on aerial surveying and mapping, and, also, the American sections of the proposed International Astronomical Union, and the International Geophysical Union. He was selected acting chairman of the· American section of the proposed Geophysical Union and, on June 30, 1919, headed the geophysical delegation from the United Staites to the meeting of the International Research Council at Brussels, which was held, beginning July 18.
DIVISION OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM.

The duties of the chief of division include preparation of plans, estimates, and instructions for the field work; the inspection of the records as they are received i recommendations regarding the purchase, construction, and repair of instruments, ,and the construction and alteration of observatory buildings; supervision of the office computations, and preparation of results for publication; and discussion of results.
MAGNEtr!O SURVEY.

As a result of conditions due to the war, the field work was very much curtailed. In the continuation of the magnetic survey of the United States, observations were made during the year at 77 stations in 11 States, of which 34 were new primary stations, 17 auxiliary stations, 22 re:peat stations for the determination of secular change, and 4 new stations in old localities. Meridian lines were established, when they were reql?-ested by the lo~al authorities.
MAGNETIO OBSERVATORIES.

The observatories at Cheltenham, Md.· Vieques, P. R.; Tucson, Ariz,; Sitka, Alaska; and near Honolulu, Hawaii, were in operation

throughout the year. Continuous photographic records were secured of the variations of declination, horizontal intensity, and vertical intensity. Absolute observations were made at least once .a week, and scale-value determinations once a morith. · A week's observations usu-. ally consisted of :four sets of declination, two sets of horizontal jntensity, and two or more sets of dip. The magnetic instruments used in the field work were standardized at Cheltenham. At Tucson comparisons were made with magnetometers Nos. 17 and 40, /thus furnishing additional data regarding· the relation between the Cheltenham and Tucson observatory instruments. A redetermination was made of the moment of inertia of the long magnet of the Tucson magnetometer, which explained the observed difference between the two standards. Upon the return of a magnetic observer from his field work in the interior of Alaska, he stopped at Sitka, and compared his instruments with those at that observatory. Advantage was taken of this comparison to secure additional data regarding the relation of the magnetic elements. at the old and new sites of the absolute building. . A seismograph was operated continuously at each observatory, and earthquakes were recorded as follows: Cheltenham, 53; Tucson, 41; Porto Rico, 76; Sitka, 23; Honolulu, 157. Most of the large number recorded at Porto Rico were slight shocks following the great disturbance of October 11, 1918. This earthquake was so severe as temporarily to put out of adjustment some of the instruments, and, apparently, changed slightly the level of some of the piers. The construction of a new building for office and quarters at Cheltenham was deferred, because of labor conditions. Some damage was done to the variation building by high winds, the force of the wind being sufficient to blow the boards off the eaves on the north side of the building. Plans. were prepared for the erection of a building for garage, shop, and pump house at Tucson, but the estimated cost was 'found to be too great to warrant its construction, and it was, therefore, decided to install a shop in the present garage, and erect a separate building for the storage of gasoline and kerosene.

On July 1, 1918, wire-drag party No. 2 was located at Eastport, Me., and engaged in the survey of Passamaquoddy Bay, having completed in June the survey of Western and Head Harbor Passages which form the &pproach to this bay. The work was carried on during July and August, and was completed on August 29. When there was an opportunity, without interfering with the drag work, triangulation and signal building were carried on in Friar Roads so that the party was prepared to drag this area as soon as the work in Passamaquoddy Bay was completed. Drag work in Friar Roads was begun on August 30, and continued until September 16 when it was completed. During the course of this work advantage was taken of favorable weather to drag a strip about 2 miles wide In Grand Manan Channel from the northern limit of soundings off West Quoudy H<>n<l to a junction with the east limit of the work in Head Harbor Passage. Tlw object of this work was to insure safe navigation for vessels along the eai;t coast of Campobello Island in an area where very fe\v soumlings have been obtained. 'I'he work in this region as finally completed embraces the survey of Pnssamaqno<ldy Bay and a continuous survey of its approach0s from the northern limit of soundings in Grand Manan Channel, off West Quoddy Heall, along the east coast of Campobello Island and through . Head Harbor Passage, Friar Roads, and \Vestern Passage. The survey covers a total area of 111.5 square stntute milrs. Because of the great range of tide and strong currents in this region the prog1'e8s of the worlr was necessarily slow. In the narrow channels forming the approach to Passamaquoddy Bny drag work could he done only at or near slack water. In the bay itself the currents were not strong enough to prevent work at any time, but cross currents clue to the several small outlets of the bay resulted on several occasions in an abnormal lift which made it necessary to reclrug some areas in order to obtain the drag depth desired. In the westt~rn part of the bay, for example, between \Vestern Passage and the St. Croix Hlver it wa:,; found that dm·ing flood tide the surface current ran to the northward while below the surface the river current continued to run south. When dragging with the Hood tide, drag tests showed a lift of from 10 to 14 feet and It was finally necessary to drag this part of the bay during ebb tide when the tidal and river currents had the same direction. An automatic tide gage was maintained at rnastport from June 28 until the survey was completed. During the course of the work in Passamaquoddy Bay secondary gages were operated at St. Andrews und l\fidjil;: Bluff, New Brunswick.

Signal building and triangulation for the worlc in Grand Manan Channel were executed by u party from the Geodetic Survey of Canada under the direction of H. F. J. Lambert. This party built and located signals on White Horse, Grand Manau, and Campobello Islands, and its work resulted in a valuable saving of time. '£he party is much indebted to Mr. Lambert for his prompt and efficient cooperation. On September 17 and 18 the equipment was loaded on the launches. and on Seritember 19 the party left Eastport to take up the survey oi Macl:J.ias Bay and approaches in accordance with instructions dated September 11, 1918. The party arrived at .Jonesport, Me., on the nfternoon of September 19, and estnblished headquarters at that !)lace. Drag work could not be started until September 25 because of weather con<litions, and until that date the party was engaged in signal building and miscellaneous work. Drag work was begun in this locality on September 25, ancl continued until Novemher 9. A strip about 5 miles wide was rlragged, extending from the Libby Islands westward to a point due south of Black Rock. The northern limit of this strip passes along the shore line in the vi<>init;.' of. Moose Peuk Lighthouse. Whenever pos,;ible, sounclings to supplement those shown on the chart were obtained b~' tbe tender which sounded at different buoys when the drag was under way. The ueptlls in this locnUty are too great for the use of the hand lead, and it was. therefore, necessary to use a sounding machine. A registering sheave was furnished the party but no winding drum was available. A fairly satisfactory drum was accordingly improvised by attaching a large buoy hoist to a box and rearranging the gears to form the drum flanges. The size of the clrum was enlarged to the size desired by winding rope on the shaft between the flanges. To wind this drum a ·buoy crank was cut down to give a short throw, and a brake was rigged to check the drum when the lead struck bottom; 390 soundings were obtained in this locality. For the reduction of the drag work in this region, a tide gauge ·was established and maintained at Jonesport. During October various members of the party were ill with the influenza which was then prevalent in Maine and the pai;ty was seriously short-handed for several weel{s. l·'ortunutely the work was in open dePp water, and could be cnrried on with fewer men than arc ordinarily necessary so that there was little delay as far rts the drag work was concerned. It was necessary to work fo1· some time without the larger tender, however, and fewer supplemental somulings were obtained tha11 would have been secured \\"ith the normal number of meu. Dnriug the entire .season n total area of 240 square statute miles was drugged, and 51 changes in the cha,rted depths were found. These changes were reported from time to time during the season. '.rhe launches PUot, S1t1TCJJ, nnd E1l1rn M. were m1ed in this work. Ou November 9, on account of unfavorable weather, work wni:; discontinued for the season. , In this work an improved semaphore machiue was used. Improvements were also made iu the method of attaching the buoys to the <lrng, permitting the new type of buoy to he ui;;ed to advnntage.

SUMMARY Oil'

nESULTS.-Leveling: 14 permanent bench marks established, 2.5 miles of IJydrography: 7 tidal stntloas Pstablished, 6 current stations occupied.

On March 22, 1919, the chief of this pa1·ty was relieved from duty in the office and begau the work of preparing for the transfer of 111 unches from New York: N. Y., and Newport, R I., to Norfolk, Va. This worlr was completed on April 27. On arrival at Baltimore, Md., after completing the transfer of launches, he begau the work of organizing a tidal and current survey party in nccordance with instructions dated April 26, 1919. This party left Baltimore in the launches Marind,in and j}{'itc1tell on May 6, arrived at Kittery Point, Me., and estnbllshed headquarters on May 14. · On May 16 the chief of party proceeded to Portland, l\Ie., in the launch Marindin and, after a delay of two days, due to stormy weather, established a current station on Portland light vessel on Mar. 19, nnd .then returned to Kittery Point.

On May 16, a member of the party left ltittery Point and proceeded to Camden, Me.,· where he installed a new engine in the launch Edna M., and fitted this launch out for work. He then ran the launch to Kittery Point, arriving on May 27. Current observations in Portsmouth Harbor and vicinity were started on May 21, and continued under very favorable weather conditions until .June 12. Five stations were occupied. A maih tidal station was established in Pepperell Cove at Kittery Point on May 21, ll.nd tides were observed during the periods when current observations were in progress. Four supplemental tidal stations were also established and connected by simultaneous readings with the main station. Bench marks were also established at the shipyard of the Atlantic Corporation on the west side of the river just above Portsmouth, and connected with the tide staff maintained by the company. Arrangements were made with the engineering division of the corporation to have observations made on the gauge in conjunction with observations at the main station. Every effort was made to obtain tidal and current data from other organizations in the vicinity. The various gauges mentioned above were connected by spirit levels with 27 bench marks, 14 of which were standard bronze marks established by the party. On June 12 the work in the vicinity of Portsmouth Harbor was completed, and on June 13 and 14 the wire-drag equipment in storage at Kittery Point was loaded on the launches and preparations made to change headquarters. Departure was prevented by thick fog until the afternoon of June 17, on which date the party left Kittery Point in the three launches, and proceeded to Cape Porpoise, Me. Current observations from Cape Porpoise were prevented by bad weather until June 23, and this period of bad weather was utilized to install wire. drag equipment on the launches. On June 23, current observations were · started at station No. 66 near whistle buoy "2CP" off Cape Porpoise, and continued for 51 consecutive hours until June 25. On June 26 a tidal station was established at Cape Porpoise Harbor. The remainder of the month was taken up with office work on current and tidal records, installation of one-man control on the launches, and preparation of launches for wire-drag work to be started on July 1, 1919. It was found to be impossible to hire tide observers for'the work in Portsmouth Harbor, and the lack of an automatic tide gauge was keenly felt. Had one been available a considerably greater amount of tidal work.could have been done. The party was also somewhat handicapped when making continuous current observations by lack of quarters in the wire-drag launches that were used. As these launches have only two berths and are heated only by kerosene, they do not offer suitable accommodations for the five men that are necessary for continuous observations.

An officer of the Survey has continued on duty throughout the year as Inspector for the New England coast, and in charge of the field station of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey with an office in the customhouse at Boston, Mass. Through the year, the best efforts of the inspector and all the facilities of the station were given to the assistance of the military departments of the Government in the prosecution of the war and In the various activities follow. ing the armistice. For such service, 259 copies of Coast and Geodetic Survey Charts were furnished to officers of the Army and Navy, besides 18 coast pilots, and 7 tide tables. The station was also able to be of considerable assistance to the general public, the records showing that information was furnished to 1,064 applicants, that 179 publications of the Survey were distributed, and that 84 charts, 15 coast pilots, and 10 tide tables were sold. A somewhat important feature of the work of the station was that of assisting the local agents for the sale of our publications to supply the need of the public by the transfer of items which they did not have In stock.

In the course of the year, 267 charts, 3 coast pilots, and 2 tide tables were thus transferred. The station has also been an agency for the distribution and sale of the publications of the Bureau of Lighthouses. During the year, 114 copies of light or buoy lists were thus disposed of. In addition to these office duties the inspector reported a supposed new shoal in the vicinity of the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sound and made frequent trips of inspection to points in the vicinity of Boston, in connection with topographic revision work. Many triangulation points were visited and most of the stations were recovered. Under the uirection of the inspector extensive topographic revision in the vicinity of Lynn, Salem, and Marblehead was executed by officers detailed for the purpose. In the autumn of 1918 the inspector installed apparatus for the observation of currents upon the light vessels stationed at Pollock Hip Slue, the Stone Horse Shoal, and Nantucket Shoals; and in March, 1919, upon the temporary light vessel Easthampton, stationed at the northern end of Stellwagen Bank. During the winter six officers and draftsmen were furnished office space and necessary facilities for the completion of the field records of wire-drag parties Nos. 1, 2, and 5. · The topographic chart revision and the reduction ·of wire-drag records were under the direction of the inspector until February 1, 1919, when they were transferred to another officer, with headquarters at Salem, Mass. During the greater part of the year a considerable part of the office space of the station was occupied by the force of the office of Inspection of Engineering Material, United States Navy, in compliance with the request of the inspector in charge of that office. Similar assistance was given the office of the United States Civil Service Commission, whose room adjoined that of the field station. With the view to acquainting the public with the existence and facilities of the station, most of the local yacht clubs were visited by the inspector, who furnished them with sundry publications besides general information.

SUMMAltY OB' nESULTs.-Trlangulatlon: 40 square miles of area covered, 2 signal poles erected, 9 stations in supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 55 geographic positions determined. Topography : 45 square miles of area surveyed, 48 mlles or general coast line surveyed, 56 miles of shore Ifne of rivers surveyed, 9 miles of shore line of. creeks surveyed, 11 miles ot shore line ot ponds surveyed, 380 miles of roads surveyed, 4 topographic sheets finished, scale 1 : 10,000.

On January 24, 1919, J. A. Daniels relieved H. P. Ritter of the field work of revising the topography and triangulation of the north shore of Massachusetts Bay from the latitude of Grover's cliff northeastward to and including Manchester Harbor. 'rhis work had been begun in July, 1918. Old triangulation points had been recovered, various plans and maps had been obtained from town and city surveyors, and these had been transferred to copies of the original sheets, and some original revision work had been done in the vicinity of Marblehead Neclc. Enough had been accomplished to show that an extensive revision of the whole area was necessary. Four sheets lettered A, B, C, and D, from south to north, were laid out upon a scale of 1: 10,000, to include the area specified. During the bad weather of February and March all the previous surveys and information· from various 8ources were transferred to these sheets in pencil. Plane-table work for verification and correction was begun as soon as weather permitted, and was pushed every good day until it was completed. A great deal of intermediate iletail worlc was paced and sketched in notebooks and then transferred to the slweb.:. By following this method it was possible to work on many days when tl1e sheets could not be taken out, and it made possible the utilization of sketchers on good days. The inking of the sheets was done as soon as the details were secured and the existing work was corrected or verified. By following this method the party was always busy regardless of weather conditions, and the office work was very nearly up to date at all times. \Vhlle the sheets are revision sheets they have all the value of a complete resurvey-as to completeness and accuracy. The only exception is in the matter of contours and elevations. This phase was not touched upon, as it was concluded that the old contour system was as complete and accurate as any that could be produced and that changes of contour were not appreciable.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The objects that bad been located by the wire-drag parties of 1915-16 supplied the principal control, although a few older points were recovered and used. Mr. Ritter had visited and recovered a large number of triangulation points, and had secured information that was very valuable. The control was adequate without additional triangulation, and the triangulation done was for the sole purpose of locating prominent objects for use upon the chart.

SUMMARY OF UESULTS.-'.1.'riangulatlon: 1~ square miles of area covered, 5 signal plies erected, 3 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 13 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 2 miles of levels run. Topography : l; mile of shore line run Hydrography : 138.2 square miles of area dragged, 0.25 square mile of area sounded 21i mlles run whlle dragging, 18.4 mlles run while sounding, 8,669 angles measured while dragging, 341 positions determined (double angles) while sounding, 69 retained soundings, 1,687 soundings made, one drag sheet finished; scales of hydrographic sheets, one 1 : 2,000, two 1 : 20,000, two 1 : 50,000.

Wire-drag work in Block Islana Sound and Fishers Island Soun<l was in progress at the heginning of the fiscal year, and was continued until November 14. No extensive scheme of triangulation was required for this work. One new station was established and marlrnd on Block Island, It. I. Observations were made to locate the flagpole at the Block Islu,nd naval base headquarters and several other natural objects were located for use as signals in the hydro~ graphic and wire-drag work. The flagpole mentioned was located at the request of the commander of the naval base. Observations were also made to determine the north range points of the Block Island trial course. These were requested by the chief of wire-drag party No. 1. Several old stations were recovered for these purposes. ' A small system of plane-table triangulation was made for the locatlon of signals to control the hydrographic survey of the entrance to Great SaJt Pond. Fourteen objects were determined for this purpose. In connection with this work the shore line at the entrance was rerun. The sounding work accomplished was done at the request of the naval authorities, and consisted of a complete resurvey of the entrance to Great Salt Pond, Block Island, on a scale of 1: 2,000. This survey made known the fact that the north side of the channel has shoaled considerably through the collection of sand and gravel. The safe depth in the channel· has become narrowed on this account. No other difference in depth was noted. The sounding was done from a pulling boat loaned to the party for the purpose by the commander of the naval base. In the vicinity of Block Island, R. I., the wire-drag work begun in the first part of the summer by party No. 1 was extended to the westward and northward to join additional work that was done to the eastward of the islantl. In the vicinity of the Sandy Point bell buoy to the northward of the island unusually troublesome currents were encountered. Much of the irregularity was due to wind action, but counter and eddy currents were rrlso noted. To find the eurrent flowing normally any day and in the direction predicted was an exeeptional occurrence. This handicap, together with the irregularities in depth, not shown on the chart, made this an exceptionally difficult area to drag. Approximately 100 square miles of area were covered in the immediate vicinity of the island. This area connects with areas previously dragged to the westward of the island. One dangerous shoal was located, this being a bowlder with a tlepth of 20 feet, found off the northeast point of the island. The work was done on a scale of 1 : 20,000 in the areas close to the island and 1 : 50,000 in the offshore areas. In the vicinity of Southwefit Ledge an examination was made in order to locate the shoal upon which the steamer Allaquash was reported to have struck on July 30, 19:J_9. No shoal was found at the point indicated, and it was concluded that the steamer was in error in reckoning, or else had struck a piece of submerged wreckage that had been carried away subsequently by the tidal currents. The work in this vicinity was done on a scale of 1: 20,000, but was plotted upon an existing smooth sheet which has a scale of 1 : 50,000. On November 13 the party was transferred from Block Island to Noank, Conn., nn<l the >mbsequent work was done in Fishers Island Sound or in the

western part of Block Island Sound. After this transfer it was possible to work in the exposed waters of Block Island Sound during clear, calm days, and to utilize less favorable days for work ·in the sheltered waters of Fishers Island Sound. Approximately 40 square miles of area were covered and 7 dangerous shoals located in this vicinity. Connections were made with the work of other parties in the vicinity of New London and the Race. . It was n.ecessary on account of the country being at war to maintain close cooperation with the naval authorities in carrying on the wire-drag work. This proved to be a pleasent duty in -this instance. The naval commander at Block Island did everything in his power to further the progress of the work. Th<' enrpenter and machine shops were made available for the uses of the party. All kinds of supplies, including gasoline and engine oils, were transferred to the party whenever requested. The use of a whaleboat for sounding in the harbor and of various tools that were lacking in the party equipment were readily secured. The party was given the use of an office within the naval headquarters building ;for the greater part of the season-in fact, everything possible was done for the comfort and convenience of th<' party nml for the furtherance of the work. Close cooperation was maintained with wire-drag party No. 1 of this service, stationed at Stonington, Conu. The shortage of wire-drag Pquipment <lue to <lel~yed deliveries because of the war made it necessary to exchange various items in order to lrne1l both parties as completely supplie<l us was possible. These exchanges were made with u cordial spirit of cooperation, and resulted in increased output of both parties. An advantageous division of the work in Block Island Sound was also made, which resulted in the connPdion of the areas surveyed by the two parties witbout loss of time or duplication of work. The Normnn 2, chartered ai:; guiding launch, the Annie T. Maclc, chartered as end launch, and the Chelsea IiJ., a Block Island fishing boat chartered as tender, gavt~ satisfactory service. Aluminum floats, designed and purchased by ,J. H. Peters In 1917, were used in part throughout the sc~nson. They showed no signs of deterioration because of the action of the salt water; unless previously bruised, they readily withstood the pressure of the deeper depths dragged ; and they were very convenient to handle because of light weight and small volume. If prover facilities are provided to prevent bruising thef:e flouts when they are taken aboard, there is no reason why they should not last indefinitely. This is an important point, .hO\vever, as even· small bruises so weaken them that they collapse or fill with water when deeply submerged. Our experience with them during the sea'son left no doubt that they are much the best design yet usecl for the pur11ose, and their general adoption is strongly recommended.

After completiug wire-drag surveys and current observations off thf' west coast of Block Island during the early part of July, the party was transferred to Stonington, Conn., on July 6, 1918, to conduct wire-drag surveys in Long Island Sound, Block Island Sound, and Fishers Island Sound.

REPORT 01!' SUPEIUNTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On account of the strong tidal currents and exposed waters of the areas named above, especially in the extreme eastern part of Long Island Sound and adjoining portions of Block Island Sound, the need of efficient launches for dragging is of primary importance. A good part of the day can be lost to field work by temporary engine failure. The drag may be swept away from the area desired to be covered, by strong currents, and make it impossible to return to the area unless the drug is taken up and again set out. Thus nothing is accomplished up to the time a second or third trial is made. As mentioned in the previous report, the party was handicapped in the use of inefficient launches, one of which was the end launch chartered for the party at the beginning of the season, and the other was temporarily hired. It was impracticable to continue to work with the underpowered and very poorly designed end launch in the new locality, and efforts were therefore made to replace this launch and the guide launch, which the owner failed to deliver to the pnrty, by other launches. · At this time a great many launches were turned over to the Navy, also many were being used for fishing or other occupations; therefore few, if any, suitable launches for wire-drag work could be hired. A great deal of time was consequently lost to field work during July in searching for launches. Finally, after considerable trouble, the best two launches that could he obtained under the circumstances were accepted the latter part of July. 'Although of sufficient power, they were far from meeting the requirements of the work in this locality. Both of the launches later proved to be more or less unsatisfactory on account of engine trouble. It was necessary to carry nearly all the wire-drag gear on the guide launch, on account of lack of space in the end launch, losing considerable time each day in setting out and taking up the drag. · Field work was resumed on August 3, after outfitting the newly hired launches. The worl{ in general was planned so as to take advantage, if pos, sible of ·fair currents in going to and from the working grounds, and also in drag~ng. Dragging was in progress in Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound during August, September, and part of October. The work in Fishers Island Sound and off New London Harbor was accomplished in October and November, when the weather restricted worl' in the open waters. The area covered by the wire drag in Block Island Sound is roughly outlined by an area extending south from the 7-fathom curve on the north side of the sound from Mount Prospect, Fishers Island, to Noyes Neck, R. I., to about halfway across Block Island Sound. It forms n. junction in part on the east with the work done by the wire-drag party operating westward from Block Island. The work inshore and near the Race was hampered by heavy lobster gear which owners, upon request, failed to remove. Some uncharteu rocky ledges were discovered inshore; the areas offshore were found free from dangers. The supposed wreck of the steamer Larolvmont was located. off Watch Hill Point, in 20 fathoms of water, and has a least safe depth of about 72 feet over it. A shoal sand ridge about 4 miles northeast of Cerebus Shoal was found to have about 14 feet less depth than soundings obtained by former surveys. The area dragged in Long Island Sound extended eastward from meridian 720 13' directly north of Plum and Gull Islands to a junction with completed work. No dangers were found in this area. The work was exceedingly difficult on account of very strong currents, and it was at times impossible to ·control the drag. Two small undragged areas in the Race were covered during short periods of least current. The dragging in the approach to New London Harbor, which the Navy Department requested, and covered by supplemental instructions from the Super· intendent dated August 22, 1918, was accomplished. No natural dangers were found to exist in this area, but several wrecks of vessels were discovered. In all of the above work the maximum effective depth was in general 100 feet, and in depths of 10 to 20 fathoms the waters were dragged 5 to 20 feet off the bottom. In depths Jess than 10 fathoms, dragging was done 3 to 6 feet off the bottom. An area of about 4 square miles off Stonington Breakwater, Fishers Island Sound, was dragged to a maximum effective depth of 35 feet, and within 3 feet of the bottom in lesser depths. A very short drag was used for thi.s work, and in order to have time to maneuver the launch over the intricate channels, dragging against the current with the short drag was found necessary, Ranges, consisting of buoyed flags and placed in position so as to guide

the launches in covering certain areas, were found to be very helpful. In Drder to drag this area it ·was necessary to remove a large number of lobster pots. Th·~ work was well controlled by numerous triangulation stations, some of which were established by the party. Practically all the signals used were located by triangulation. Tides were read at Little Gull Island and . at Stonington, Conn., for the re(luction of drag depths and soundings.

Inspection outy for the region between Narragansett and Delaware Bays ·wns continued by an offirer who is in charge of a field station of the Survey with an office in the customhouse, New York City. On July ·1, 1918, the inspector was in the field on the coast of New Jersey engaged in determining the geographic positions of certain towers used iu ·connection with range firing, which had been requested by the commanding officer of the Sandy Hook Proving Ground. This work was completed on July 10. On July 24, 25, and 26 an inspection was made with officers of the Army Jllngineers of the Eastern Department of the condition of the triangulatio11 stations on the western end of Long Island. On August 15 and 16 the inspector determined the geographic positions of North and South Sandy Hook beacons. Other visits to Sandy Hook in· connection with this work were made on August 20 and 28. A day was spent in September on reconnoissance at Fort Tilden, N. Y., with an engineer officer of the Eastern Department. In the latter part of October the electric tide indicator which had been in operation for many years in the Maritime Exchange was dismantled, funds for its l"Ppair and operation not being available. A stock of charts and nautical pui>licatiom; was kept on hand nt the fiel<I station for reference and sale. The number of demands upon the inspector for information covering a wi<le range continues to increase, and the usefulness of the field station is becoming mor(~ wide!~' recognized. :Muny Army and Navy officers called for information, and numerous charts and publications were furnished to meet emergency demands. Cordial relations and cooperation were maintained with the brunch hydrographic oftlee at New York. Copies of tidal data and tables giving the time of sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset were furnished for publication in local tide calendars, in 16 newspapers, and in Eldridge's tide book. The inspector has acted as agent for sale of publications of the Bureau of Lighthouses and for distribution of pilot rules for inland waters. A. self-registering tide gauge was installed at the shipyard of the Subntnrlne Boat Corporation at Port Newark, N. J., ln February, and has been In operation since tllat time.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Triangulation: 77 square miles of area covered, 20 signal poles erected, 11 stalions in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 27 geographic positions determined. Leveling : 3 miles of levels run, 7 permanent bench marks established. Topography : 2 square miles Of area surveyed.

Between .July 1 and September 18 the .Matchles11 was engaged in surveys in York River, Chesapeake Bay, and Back River, all in Virginia. The work requested by the Navy Department in York River, arnl soundings to verify depths, etc., indicated by previous >mrvey~. wns completed September 3, 1918. The location of sig11als and other objects for the use of the Atlantic Fleet was transmitted to the commander in chief of the Atlantic Fleet and the commander of naval ba;;e No. 2. This consisted of a tracing from the confidential chart of this region (published by the Hydrographic Office), on which was shown the position of the objects requested by the Navy. In addition to this tracing, a list was made showing ·the names and positions in degrees, minutes, and meters, and a brief description of each object. A copy of the latter was sent to the office. Every assistanee possible was rendered by the naval authorities. The surveys at the naval oil base afterwards requested by the Navy Department were completed within the time requiretl uy the naYal authorities. On September 3 all the work in York River and approaches, except three current stations, had been completed. The JJfatchless was moved on September 5 from Sedger Creek to mid-channel abreast of the beacon in York River. Two of the launches were posted, one in Mobjacl;: Bay and one in Poquoson River. Currents were observed from ·the ship and each of the launches, beginning at 10 a. m., Thursday, September 5. Heavy weather interrupted the observations at 7 a. m., Saturday, September 7, and the ship was put under way at 12 noon on .that date for Back River. A rough passage was made with the wind northwest hauling to northeast. After passing the bar at Back River, the tide and wind were too much for the launches to malrn headway against, and after four attempts to pass the turn in the channel at the lower Back River Beacon the ship was anchored to await slack water. At 6 p. m., September 7, the ship was under way, and passed to a safe anchorage into Baclr River off Messick Point. Eight feet is the best water in the crossover below the Upper Back River Beacon, and the ship touched lightly in passing in. On Monday the anchorage was shifted to off Amory's wharf, Back River. On this date field operations were begun with two parties searching for old triangulation stations, and the commanding officer going to ~angley Field headquarters to arrange for supplies, getting fresh water, and for information, etc. Signals were erected, an!l the olmerYatiuns in the triangulation begun on September 11. This triangulation was necesio;ary to determine signals for use off and in Rack River, and to determine certain object,; (landmarks, etc.) to be shown on the new editions of ('hnrts for this region. Boat sheets, showing positions of. sounding lines of previous surveys and old depths for comparison of the work of 1!>18 with these old surveys, were preparerl, and sounding operations were begun on Septembe1· 16.

Commanding Schooner Matchless, Sept. 18, 1918, to Apr. 30, 1919; commanding Steamer Onward, May 1 to June 30, 1919.] SuM-ARY OF RESULTS.-Trlangulation: 142 square miles of area covered 4 signal poles erected, 5 observing tripods and scaffolds built, 17 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 92 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 23 permanent bench marks established, 7 miles of levels run. Topography: 46.5 miles of area surveyed, 37 miles of general coast line surveyed, 10 miles of shore line of rivers surveyed 40 miles of shore line of creeks surveyed, 229.5 miles of roads surveyed ; scale of topogra'phie sheet 1 : 10 000. Hydrography : 82 square miles of area covered, 1,262 miles run while sounding. 6.435 positions determined (double angles), 42,880 soundings made, 13 tide stations · established, and 7 current stations occupietl, 3 hydrographic sheets finished; scales of hydrographic sheets 1 : 20,000, 1 : 10,000, and 1 : 5,000.

On September 18, when the command of the schooner Matchless was transferred, the vessel was at anchor in Back River. The signals for the triangulation in Back River were already erected, and one day of hydrography on the hydrographic sheet, extending from York River to Hampton Roads, had been done. Work was continued on the bydrography and triangulation in accordance with orders previously issued, and on October 4 the Matchless shifted from an anchorage in Back River to a berth in Hampton Creek, where she lay until the end of the calendar year. The triangulation in Back River necessary to locate prominent objects and signals for the control of the hydrography was completed before leaving that locality. Observations were also taken to locate Thimble Shoal Lighthouse and several prominent objects near the entrance to Hampton Roads. Seven stations in the main scheme and 12 intersection stations were located in connection with the work from York River to Hampton Roads. A special development of Back River entrance was made, and the positions of the aids to navigation, anrl a copy of the survey of the entrance were furnished to the superintendent of lighthouses, Baltimore, Md. The bydrograpby was extended eastward to a junction with the work done by the Hydrographer, and southward to the shore of Willoughby Spit, to cover the nren south of Thimble Shoal Channel, which has been used as a dumping ground. Work on the sheet extending from York River to Hampton Roads was completed November 14. In accordance with instructions dated November 1, a reconnoissance of Hampton Roads, Chuckatuck Creek, nnd Elizabeth River and tributaries was at once taken up to obtain information as to the necessity of furtner surveys. This work was completed, and a report submitted November 8, showing the necessity for complete surveys of the whole area. In accordance with instructions dated Novembe.r 14, work on a hydrographlc and topographic survey of Hampton Roads was at once taken up. This work was in progress at the end of the calendar year. Signals necessary to the control of the bydrography and topography were erected, and observations made for their location and the location of prominent objects, of which many were uncharted. Three stations in the main scheme and about 25 prominent objects were located. . The commanding officer conferred frequently with the U. S. Engineers, the officials at the naval base, and others in order to coordinate the survey work and make the results as nearly complete as possible. On January 1 work wns in progress on the hydrographic, topographic, tidal, and current su~vey of Hamnton Roads and vicinity, the party having headquarters at Hampt'on, Va. This work was continued throughout f.he remainder of the fiscal year and was in progress on .Tune 30. A topographic sheet covering the north side of Hampton Roads and two sheets on the south side were completed: A bydrograpbic sheet covering the main part of Hampton Roads southward to Craney Island Flats was also completed. Seven current and seven ti1lal stations were occupied. . The triangulation was continued for the purpose of furnishing control for the hydrography and topography, and for the location of prominent objects for the charts. A special effort was made to make the list of prominent objects for the charts complete, and the legends select<'<l were Ruch as to make the objects easily distinguishable. A special effort was also made to verify the descriptions of old stations, and furnish descriptions, not only .of all new stations determined, but of all old stations recovered for which no descriptions exist.

main-scheme stations and 42 prominent objects were determined by triangulation. All new ~tations were described, and recovery noted for 90 old stations prepared. A large part of the time of the party was devoted to miscellaneous work in eonnection with transfer of vessels and launches from the Navy Department to . the Coast and Geodetic Survey, shipment of launches to the Pacific coast, care und overhauling of vessels and equipment, and work in connection with condemnation and sale of the schooner Matchle.ss. The steam<'r On10ard was received from the Navy Department on April 18, and hrought from Norfolk to Hampton April 19. Work was at once started on deaning, painting, and overhauling the vessel, to fit her for receipt of the personnel and equipment and to fit her for survey purposes. The vessel was placed in commission May 1, but work on her was continued, simultaneously with the fi!'ld work, and was still in progress on June 30. The launch Alinam II was taken over from the Navy Department April 28, and the 8candinm;ia May 21. · In addition to these, five others-the Helianthus, -Wildcat, L11dia III, Milra.we, and Attdwin II, taken over from the Navy by othe1· <>fficers-were turned over to the commanding officer of the steamer Onward for shipment to the Pacific coast. The HeUanth11s, Attdwin II, and Almam II were shipped before the close of the fiscal year. The commanding officer served as a member of the board of uppraisul of t.lw schooner Matchless, the report of which was submitted April 26. The Matchless was place<l out of commission April 30, personnel and equipment being transferred to the steamer Onward. She was advertised for Ruic May 19, sold June 16, anrl delivered to tht> buyers .Tune 30. Uud!'r or<lers <lated March 22, the commanding officer was Instructed to cooperate with the commanding officer of the Isis in making arrangements for the shipment of launches to the Pacific coast on a Navy transport. Arrangements were successfully made, and three launches-the Helianthus, Almam II, and Attd'win II were shipped on the U. S. S. Huston, leaving Norfolk April 12.
[H. A. SERAN, Commanding Steamer Bache.] SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Hydrography : 6 tall hydrographlc signals built, total height 824 feet.

During the period f1'om March 31, 1919, to June 20, 1919, the steamt>r Bnche was being repaired at the Coast Guard station, Arundt>l Cove, Md., SpeddinR Shipbuilding Co., Baltimore, and at the Norfolk Navy Yard. An officer was assigned to act as the representative of the Survey while these repairs were in progress. On June 22 the vessel was turned over to the Survey, although the Navy Department had yet to finish certain items of repairs and furnish a sounding nm chine. J1'rom June 20 to June 30 the vessel was at the navy yard, Norfollc, Va., obtaining supplies. preparing buoys for use as signals on the offshore hydrography, and installing a sounding machine. Arrangements were made with the superintendent of lighthouses of the fifth lighthouse district for the loan of six seconrl-class, tall-type can buoys to be used as offshore signals in accordance with previous Coast Survey practice. As the Lighthouse Service could not furnish the necessary chain and -anchoring gear, arrangements were made with the Bureau of Ordinance, Navy Department, for the loan of such mooring material as was necessary to talre the pb:.-e of chain, etc. This material had been used in connection with the defem~e net acrdss the Capes of the Chesapeake. As the buoys for offshore signals were to be placed in the fairway to the channel at the approaches to Chespeakc Bay, it was decided to equip each o.l the buoys with a light similar to the temporary light establis~ed at times by the Lighthouse Service. Specification11 were drawn up, advertised, and a contract let with the Alexander Millburn Co., of Baltimore, Md., to furnish six 11uch llghts. The lights consist of a marine lantern, with fresnal lens, equipped so as to show a steady white light about 8 feet above the top of tht> buoy and inside the superstructure. The gas for the light is furnished by a Prest-0-Lite tank and reduced to suitable pressure. The lantern and tank are 11ecurely fastened to a frame which is to be fastened to the superstructure on the buoy With eight braces. In order to start field work with little delay after the transfer of the vessel from the Navy a subparty was organized. This party built the signals necessary for the w~rk while the vessel was being repaired at Baltimore and Norfolk.

REPORT.OF SYPERINTENDENT, COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Two 100-foot signals were erected, one near the site of Ship Shoal 3, 1915, about 5 miles north of Cupe Charles and at the northern limit of the work, and the other on the site of Mink Hill, 1915. It was the intention to build a third 100-foot signal at or near the site of Bel, 1915, but as this part of the island is suffering greatly from inroads from the sea, anchors for tlie guys could not be placed. This part of Smith Island is entirely under water at high tide at the present time. To have built a tall signal at this point would have Tequired more money than 'vas available at that time. A 40-foot signal without farreaching guys wns erected instead. In addition to the two tall signals and the 40-fout signal rneutiuued in the preceding paragraph, the subparty built three more 40-foot signals 011 Smith Island at or near the sites of previous signals. The officer in charge of the snbparty left Baltimore on May 15, and reported on hoard the Bache at Norfolk, Va., at the completion of the signal building on .June 20. The greatest difficulty experienced by the subparty was the transporting of the materials for the signals to the vadous sites. ·

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Triangulation: 21.9 square miles of area covered, 3 signal poles erected, 12 stations In supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 31 geographic positions determined.

Bc;tween Fehruary 26 and April 22, 1919, a revision was murle of the triangulation in the vicinity of Charleston, S. C., in order to make aYnilable for use on a new erlition of Chart 445, the results of a number of recent surveys by the United Stutes Engineers and others, and to locate prominent points of a permanent nature that could he used as landmarks for navigation purposes. Copies of surveys and maps by the United States FJnginee1·f', navnl authorities, transportation companies, and local municipal oflic<>rs showing the rnoRt recent soundings and chnnges in shore line due to new construction or natural changes, were obtained.

[W. H. KlllARNS.]

In accord1111Cl~ with a request from the construetion division of the War Department a hydrographic survey was made of the Turtle River, Ga., from a point near the Southern docks, which was the limit of a recent survey, to a point beyond Crispen Island. '.rile constructing quartermaster of the picric ucid plant at Brunswick furnished quarters for the chief of party and his assistant, and supplied the necessary laborers and material, and a l!nmch for the transportation of the party. The picric acid plant was situated near Southern .Junction railroad station about 8 miles north of Brunswick, and about 2 miles west of the '.rurtle River. It occupied about 6 square miles of woodland and swamp land. between 'l'urtle River on the southwest and Southern Junction on the northeast. Crispen Island is a low lying, spnrsely woo<lE'd islanrl on -tlw east ><hore of the '.rurtle River about 3:! miles north of th<~ Southem Ruilway ducks. 011 this iHlund were to have been placed warehouses and docks, and a roadway wati to have been built oyer the marsh from the plant to the docks. In the Turtle River between this island und the Southern lluilway dod:s the chart showed depths of 25 feet with places of 15 and 18 feet, and it was requested that since the prevlons survey, which was made in 1856, was more or less preliminary, that a comp]< te Rurvey of the river be made from Southern Railway docks to beyond Crispen Island so that the amount of dredging could be ascertained, and that sllips drawiug :25 feet of water could proceed up to Crispen Islan<l. The launch Polaris furnished h~' the constructing quartermaster was found unsatisfactory. Another boat wns hired from the fishing fleet at Brunswick which proved more satisfnctory. '£he work was begun with all possible dispatch, and an attempt was made to bring the triangulation up from Brunswick and sound out the shoal area lying off Little Crispen Isllmd as rapidly us possible so that dredging could be done immediately. However, shortly ofter the signing of the armistice,

orders were received from the Wnr Department to close down the plant and the work of Jmilding the road to Crispen Island was stopped. The prepara'tions for the building of the docks at Crispen Island were also stopped, and therefore the immediate need for the survey ceased. The constructing quartermaster, however, still thought it advisable to survey the river, and continued to finance the worlc · It was necessary to extend the triangulation up from Brunswick, and therefore stations Bly, Buz, and S. E. Base, which were old established stations, were recovered. The scheme of triangulation consisted of five quadrilaterals. Nine new stations were established as the main-scheme stations and were marked. Five stutions were marked by standard disk stations and reference mark8, namely, Road, Tel. Hen, Dil, anu Crnek. FouL' other stations were marked by a eopper nail in a 2 by 4 post sunk flush into the marsh, namely, MarRh, Bog, Herm, and Di!. Two other stations were cut in and marked by 2 by 4 posts sunk into the marsh, namely, Flag and Isle. Cuts were taken from the different stations to the various natural objects in the vicinity, such as the tank at the Southern docks, dolphins in the river, and the stack at the pkric acid plant. A tide gauge wns established ut the Southern Railway docks, and also one at Crispen Island, and tidal observations were made at these points. There was no tide gauge nt Brunswick, and so a gauge was established there, and simultaneous observations were made with the stations at the Southern docks and Crispen Island, so that a plane could be established from the beneh marks at Brunswick. Bench marks were established at Southern Railway docks and at Crispen Island, and were connected by levels to the tide staffs. The topography of the Turtle River included the entire river from above the Southern docks to a point above Crispen Island. · T. S. Caruthers, inspector in local charge, United States Engineer Department at Brunswick, assisted in the work in every way possible, and loaned his launch to the party on several occasions. Several buildings in Brunswick whieh have been located by previous triangulation were listed as useful aids to navigation. The construction of a float pipe for an automatic tide gauge which was being built by the Brunswick Marine Construction Co. at Brunswick, Gu., wus , inspPrted. Specifications for the construction and instnllntion of this pipe were furniRhed by the Washington office, and the work wns ai'terwards completed according to the specifications. On January 4, 1918, when the survey at Brunswick wus completed, the chief of party proceerled to Femandina, Fla., and installed this flont pipe at the tide station therf'.

Between .January 1 and March 31, 191!), a resurn·~· was made of Key Biscayne Bay from its head to latitude 25° 35', about the latitude of Fowey Rocks and Soldier Key, nnd the outside coast between the same northern and southern limit:>. ·~xtending just beyond the 10-futhom curve. A tertiary scheme of triangulation had been executed during December, 1918, which gave good control of the work in the bay, and sufficient points, visible froru the outside eoast, were located, enabling the topographer to traverse between positions located topographicall~· from prominent objects located by triangulation. '.rhe coast und other land features are low nnd flat, wooded where not under cultivation, or else cleared for towns and townsites. The topography was done on two 1: 20,000 projections. A 1: 10,000 sheet was completed. This sheet embraced the improved sections of this vicinity, namely, the city of Miami and the town of Miami Beach. . Extensive improvements in channels, buoyuge, water front, viaducts, and towns necessitated a resurvey to keep the chart in proper relations to actual conditions. Large concrete water towers, conspicuous on the fiat coast, were located so that mariners, in the steamer track through Florida Strait, could determine their position with accuracy when the new chart becomes available. A number of groundings by deep-draft vesRels along this coast resulted in an 18-foot (position doubtful) sounding being placed on the chart. Unsuitable weather conditions prevented a thorough search for this feature, but the ac-

complished work is sufficient to ~ow that the position given for this shoal is erroneous, due no doubt to the fact that no coastal features, either natural or :a-tificial, were available for a better location except by estimating the·distance from shore which, in hazy weather, is highly misleading. Tidal stations were maintained at Miami, Cape Florida, Cutler, and Government Cut. It was impossible to establish a staff on Fowey Lighthouse, as a constant breaker washes the bottom of the structure. Soldier Key was also impracticable, as there was no one on the island to observe tides. The station at Miami was an automatic tide gauge; the other were staffs. The old work was preliminary in character, and hydrography shown on the chart was insufficient for safe navigation. The wind effect on the tides in Key Biscayne Bay is considerable, and a reference plane for sounding is unsatisfactory unless mariners are cautioned to make proper allowance for the variation of depths due to this cause.
[CHESTER A. OBER, Commanding Steamer Hudrngravhcr.J SUMMARY Oil' RESULTS.-Triangulation: 56.7 square m!Jes of area c~vered, 31 signal poles· erected, heights from 10 to 14 feet ; 5 buoy signals with superstructures constructed, heights 12 to 14 feet; 4 observing tripods and scaffolds built, hei~hts 64 and 48 feet; 3 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 5 stations In supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 7 geographic positions determined. Leveling: 4 permanent bench marks established. 7.2 miles of levels run. Magnetic work: Ship swung at one se11 station. 'l'opography: 2.5 square miles of area surveyed, 14.3 miles of general coast line surveyed, 2 topographic sheets finished, scales 1 : 15,000. Hydrography: 72.2 square miles run while sounding, 6,833 positions determined (double angles), 48,251 soundings made, 2 tide stations established, 3 current stations occupied, 1 hydrographic sheet completed, scale 1 : 15,000.

On January 1, the Hydrographer was at Baltimore, Md., having completed: the season's repairs, and made the necessary preparations for proceeding to Key West, Fla., to take up work requested by the Navy Department. The vessel reached Key West safely on January 21. Consultations were had with naval officials; arrangements were made for obtaining coal, water, and certain supplies from the Navy; bids were put out, boilers cleaned, and on January 29, field work was begun. Twenty-two hydrographic signals, from 10 to 14 feet high; five hydrographic signals (tripods), 20 feet high; four triangulation signals (tripods), 24 feet high; four scaffold signals, 48 and 64 feet high, were erected. Five water signals (buoys) were placed in position by the Lighthouse Service; on two bell buoys superstructures or cagings were built, 12 and 14 feet high. Observations were made with a 6-inch Berger repeating theodolite. Two bases were used; one from Sand Key Lighthouse to Key West Lighthouse, the other from Sand Key Lighthouse to Vote, (on Woman Key). There were necessarily a number of eccentric stations. It was intended that all measurements be remade, but as there was no opportunity for such work and as the differences in length found in the double determination of each distance came within the allowable maximum error, the observations were accepted as made. Because the Navy had made several noticeable changes at 'Voman Key, the shore line and topographical features of this island were revised. Use was also made of the plane table to locate hydrographic signals. At Boca Grande Key the small opening in the southwest side no longer exists. Tl1is was not note'd until after the location of hydrographic signals had been accomplished, and when the command was transferred to G. C. Mattison, a memorandum was made of the need for revision of shore ljne at Boca Grande. Three new tidal bench marks were established on the north part of the first island south of the large crescent-shaped key forming the northeastern half of the Marquesas group. These were connected by levels with the tide staff! of 1919. One new bench mark was established at Sand Key Light, and all bench mai·ks there connected by levels with the tide staff. At Key West the automatic tide gauge staff was connected by levels with the numerous bench marks in Key West and at Fort Taylor. In the areas covered by the ship hydrography, 100-meter north and south lines were crossed by one-fourth-mile east and west lines, and shoal indications were developed. Sheet 2, which extends from Key West to Boca Grande, has all its ship work eomplc>ted. A junction was made with sheet 3, which extends from Boca Grande to the western side of Marquesas, and work on sheet 3 was in a favorable state of progress at the date of the transfer of command. No splits or detached areas were left. Sheet J, to the southward and east-

ward of Key West, was left untouched, as the Navy has no immediate use for work in that locality. Sheet 4, offshore sheet, 1: 40,000 has only the lines run in making the test of the new Coast and Geodetic Surv~y sounding tubes. ·work with launch BBB, and later with launch Mandalay, made favorable progress. 011 sheet 2 all except a very few areas were completed. Onehundred-meters north and south lines, crossed by one-fourth-mile east and west lines were also run by the launch. 'l'hrough the ke~'s to the westward of Key West, there is a small-boat channel, which was developed by the launch and used for running from Boca Grande Channel to Key West, whenever heavy seas prevented or endangered small-boat navigation north or south of the keys. Three stations were occupied for current observations: Boca Grande Chan~ nel; Key West Harbor (just south of Frankfort Bank Beacon); and Man Key (about 1 mile south of the southern and eastern end of Man Key). Complete data were entered in the record book for current observations. The automatic gauge at Key West was placed in satisfactory running condition, and frequent inspections made, to insure an unbroken series of readings. A new staff was furnished for this station, and samples of the old staffs were forwarded to the office. A report on this station was made early in April. Computations, description of stations, work on sheets and records, reports, and accounts, take up no inconsiderable portion of the Hydrourapher's time in the Held, and voluntary overtime and night work on the part of the chief of party, officers, and crew deserve especial mention. Several minor repair items were accomplished during the working season, with little or no delay to the work in the field. The first officer and chief engineer deserve a good deal of credit for the efficient upkeep of their respective departments. Whenever possible, the Hytiroumvher left Key West Monday morning, remained on the working grounds during the week, and returned to Key \Vest at the end of the week for water, coal, and supplies. Jfor work on sheet 3, water signals were used. These floating signals were located each day; it is believed, however, that an ebb or flood tide position, or certain wind and sea positions, may be determined. High scaffold signals were used, in order that control might be had out to the 100-fathom curve. A few small hydrographic signals, used for launch work inside the reefs, were located by sextant angles. Plane table location could have been made only after a great deal of work ·and loss in time, because the mangroves overhang the shore, and a depth of 3 to 5 feet of water is found close to the mangroves. Close cooperation was maintained with the Navy and with the Lighthouse service. The latter placed five buoys to be used as floating signals, and also granted permission for the placing of cross targets on several of the beacons in the vicinity of Key West.
[G. C. MATTISON, Commanding Steamer Hydrographer.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Trlangullitlon: 1 scaffold built, height 63 feet. Topography: 2.3 mlles of shore line of rivers surveyed. Hydrography: 45.6 square m!Jes of area covered, 590.4 miles run while sounding, 3,192 positions determined (double angleR). 20,072 soundings made, 1 current stati9n occupied ; scale of hydrographic sheets 1 : 15,000 and 1: 40,000.

On ,June 4, the command of the ll11drouraphcr was transferred from Chester H. Ober to G. C. Mattison. The vessel immediately proceeded to Marquesas Keys and rebuilt triangulation station South, a 63-foot scaffold, which had previ'ously blown down. Three days were spent in_ rebuil~ing this signal, 8;nd as it required the whole available deck force, the shlP occupied a current station latitude 24° 30' longitude 82° 04' 45" for a period of 52 .hours, the launch being used to tr~nsport the working pm:ty to and from the ship. Practically the whole of the remainder of the month was spent in doing hydrographic work. . Hydrographic signals on Marquesas were relocated by plune table. .A previous traverse had been run, but the traverse did not close on stations formerly located by the party under Assistant Hodglcins. The error was found, however, and the signals are now properly locuted. This work was done on hydrographic boat sheet No. 3, it not being considered necessary to make a topographic sheet for this short traverse. The only sounding done by the ship was on sheet No. 3. No indications of new shoals were found, nor were any shoals developed. A few offshore lines were run on sheet 4. south of Coalbin Rock. The new Coast and Geodetic

Survey sounding tubes were used, but a weakness was found to develop after several days' use in that the collar which holds the pivoted clamp works loose, owing to the great pressure; otherwise these tubes are apparently satisfactory. The areas in the vicinity of Boca Grande, Man, or 'Voman Keys were completed by the Jauncll. However, there remain a few shoal indications to be developed. It wus ne1·e..;s1u-y fo1· tlle launch to do this work, as unfavorable weather cornlitious made it irnvossible to work in more exposed waters. A little sounding was done by the launch south and west of Marquesas on sheet 3. Tide obsenations were made at Sand Key Lighthouse during this period by the lighthouse keepers. l\forquesns tidal station was occupied for a period of 50 hours. This wa:.; done during a period of bad weather, anrl the launch was anchored at the tide station with three men using it as quarters. During this time it would have been practically impossible for the launch to do any sounding. Tides were read during the dn:v at Marquesas for work on sheet 3, a seaman from the Hydrogmpher being used for that purpose. Automatic tide gauge at Key West wai; in operation during this period. A new tide stafl' was installed at Sand Key to replace the old one in use there. Orders were received on June 12 to cooperate with the naval air service in experimental work to ascertain whether or not it is feasible so to photograph the coral heads that areas so photographed will not have to be wire dragge11. The naval air station at Key ·west did not receive instructions until .June 27. The first work done was on June 30. A series of 24 photographs were taken, and it was the intention to take more, but the plane had developed engine trouble, and found it necessnry to return to Key West. The results were not very good on this day owing to the high range of tide, the current running in and out of the channel near Key West keeping the water in clouded condition. A great many of the charted shoals did not show at all on the photographs. These photographs were taken at elevations varying from 2,300 to 4,300 feet. A high-power camera was userl, and those shoals which did show on the photOJ.!Taphs were as clear at an elevation of 4,300 as at 2,300 feet.
[E. E. REESE.]
SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Slgnnl building: 3 mnln points selected for erection of signals, 1 hydrogrnphlc signal built, height 103 feet.

On June 2 instructions were given for the erection of signal towers for offshore hydrography on the Gulf coast from a short distance east of Pensacola, Fla., to Mobile Bay. From June 2 to 8 the time was spent at the Washington, D.

During the fiscal yeal' an officer has continued on duty at New Orleans as inspector for the Gulf of Mexico, during the greater part of the time engaged in the usual work of the office, attending to officlal correspondence, distribution and sale of charts and publications, supplying information .in reply to requests from officials and from the public, and collecting information required for the correction of the charts. From September 7 to 9 the inspector was at Pascagoula, Miss., engaged in revising the topography· of that harbor. In August the board of commissioners of the Public Belt Railway of New Orleans requested data and instruments in order to make surveys on the Misslflsippi River to show the practicability of building a bridge over or a tunnel under the Mississippi River at that place. Information was furnished, and the uecessary iustruweuts were loaned to the engineer of the commission, and the. inspector aided him when he was unable to obtain other expert assistance.

Blue prints, maps, and information for the correction of charts, obtained from the United States Engineers, and from other sources, were forwarded by the inspector to the Washington office. Charts, publications, and information relating to surveys were furnished in reply to numerous requests from officials or others. A stock of charts, and nautical publications was kept on hand for reference. In January, and again in June, topographic information in reference to harbor Improvements was collected at Mobile, Ala., and current apparatus was installed on Heald Bank lightship. In February repairs to the tide gauge at Fort Morgan, Ala., were supervised, and an inspection trip was taken with the superintendent of lighthouses from Morgnn City to New Orleans, by way of the Gulf of Mexico and inland routes.

The steamer Survcyo1· left Norfolk, Va., April 21, 1919, under instructions to proceecl to the Pacifir co11st by way of the Panama Canal. Deep-sea soundings were made during the voyage, beginning on April 22, from latitude 34° 00', longitude 71 ° 40' to San Salvador. and across the Caribbean Sea, and thence to a point off the coast of Lower CalU'ornia, the last sounding being taken on May 18.
[R. R. LUKENS, Commanding Steamer Wenonah.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydr<!graphy: 39 deep-sea soundings made.

The steamer Wenonah left New York for the Pacific coast by way of the Pannnm Canal on May 22, stopping nt Norfolk, Va., to install a deep-sea sounding machine, and also stopping at Kingston, Jamaica, for coal and supplies. Deep-sea soundings were begun off Cupe Hatteras, and 37 soundings were made between Cape Hatteras and Colon where the vessel arrived June 26. The ves.;el left Kingston, Jamaica, at 7 a. m., .Tune 21, and proceeded to take up the sounding line to Colon. Just outside of Kingston Harbor, n very heavy southeasterly sea was encountered, accompanied by a fresh breeze from the same direction. Although it was very rough, three soundings were attempted without success, due to the excessive pitching and rolling, and it wus considered that to continue operations woulfl only mean a loss of material, which was already running short. · Accordingly sounding wus discontinued, und the vessel proceeded on her course, making very bud weather of it rolling 30 to 42 degrees, with the alleyways filled with water. Neither officers nor men could sleep below, and there was spray over the decks constantly, making sleep there impossible. At daylight, June 23, the wind moderated enough so that two soundings, one of 1,700 and the other of 1,900 fathoms were made. The ship passed through the brehl{water at 10.30 p. m., .Tune 23, and anchored in Colon Harbor.
HYDROGRAPHIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC WORK, PACIFIC COAST. CALIFORNIA.

[ARTHUR JOACHIMs;) SUMMAitY OF iunsULTs.-Hydrograpby (wire drag) : 23 square miles of area dragged, 69.2 miles run while jlragglng, 298 positions determined (double angles), 11129 soundings made. 2.3 square miles of area sounded, 25.5 miles run while sounding, ~ hydrographic sheets finished, scale 1 : 12,000. .

Between May 5 and June 3, 1919, a wire-drag survey was made around the entire shore of Luke Tahoe to discover dangers to navigation. The survey was made at tlw request of and in accordance with the requirements of the United States Reclamation Service. It was only after a careful study was made of the hydrographlc sheets by the Reclamation Service and of the lake itself, that a definite conclusion could be reached as to the logical effective depth to drag. This matter was discussed with the project manager of the Reclamation Service at Fallon, Nev., who emphasized the importance of dragging in close to shore, as it was here only that obstructions could be expected, since with few exceptions deep water could be found within 500 yards of the shore. A definite conclusion was reached by the assistant engineer, United States Reclamation Service, assigned to 189188-19--8

cooperate in the wire-drag work, and the chief of the drag, that they could drag completely around the shore of the lake carrying an effective depth of 16 to 17 feet for the present height of the lake, which, if corrected to a datum of 6,223, would be about 12 feet effective depth. For the purpose of getting in close to shore it was agreed that they should hook up the two inshore buoys to 12! and 13 feet. The hydrographic sheets of the Reclamation Service show two-thirds of the shore of Lake Tahoe to be rather bold and dropping off into deep water, and the other one-third consisting of shoal shelves covered in most cases with large bowlders, and in a few instances, clear sand. These shelves run out from 200 to 500 yards, except in two or three instances where they extend out about three-fourths of a mile. At their outer edge they drop boldly into deep water. Considering the type of navigation to ply on the lake, namely, boats drawing from 3 to 7i feet, it was important to drag these shoal shelves, over which it was in general only practicable to carry 16 to 17 feet. Also, the time allotted for the· work was so limited that attention was given only to the most important parts. From the outer limits of these shoals extends blue water which, owing to the clearness of the lake, signifies that it is quite deep. It was requested that all the time be spent on work over the shoal areas, as the whole purpose of the surveY: was to locate any obstructions to navigation which had been missed on these shoals by the previous hydrographic survey of the Reclamation Service. A drag strip of from 1,700 to 1,900 feet was run with an effort to keep as closely inshore as possible. A number of shoals, in most cases bowlders, were located with one-half foot to 7 feet of water 6ver them. There were four sheets covering the work of this survey, which include the complete area of the lake. They were made on a scale of 1 inch to 1,000 feet, which was requested by the Reclamation Service. The soundings taken on drag shoals were plotted in ink. Sheet No. 1 begins at Sugar Pine Point, on the California coast, and extends to Tahoe Vista, which is about 1 mile west of State Line Point. Sheet No. 2 starts where No. 1 ends and extends around the Nevada shore to a point about three-fourths mile south of Glenbrook. A drag strip of 1.700 to 1,800 feet was run completely around the shore line and inshore as close as it was possible to drag. The two important points on this sheet by way of shoal are at State Line Point and off the point marking the southern limits of San Harbor. Sheet No. 3 continues from sheet No. 2 and extends to a point 1.5 miles west _,£ Tallac. Sheet No. 4 continues from sheet No. 3 and overlaps on sheet No. 1, making a. closure of the drag survey around the lake. Bowlders off State Line Point are exceedingly dangerous, as it is natural for vessels to stand in close to this point when enroute from Crystal Bay to the city of Tahoe. They are also deceiving in that blue water can be found only a few yards out board from them. The bowlder shoal off the southern point of Sand Harbor, the one just south of Glenbrook, and also off Zephyr Cove, since they offer no warning to vessels, deep water surrounding them, are dangerous. The entrance to Emerald Bay is bordered on both sides by bowlder reefs that on the north side extend about half way across the entrance and contain very dangerous bowlders. The south side does not extend very far out from shore, however, it also is very foul with bowlders. So the channel is only 85 yards in the narrowest place and has a sand bottom. It is a level bottom with an average depth of about 8 feet at 6,223 elevation of the lake. Emerald Bay was dragged, and no dangers discovered after passing the entrance. Off the city of Tahoe a number of dangerous bowlders were discovered, which are of importance in that this place at present is most frequented by vessels. A number of minor shoals were discovered a knowledge of which is important to vessels skirting the shores of the lake. If the elevation of the lake was lowered to 6,223, the results of this survey would show definitely the conditions of the areas bordering the shore, since the survey was made on that datum. So far as the bowlders are concerned, it would in most cases be a benefit, since a number of them would be awash and could be seen more readily. It is true, however, that the shoals off the cities of Tahoe and Bijou, having less water, would make docking at these places difilcult for vessels drawing over 7 feet. The docks, on the other hand, could be lengthened, and in that way meet the requirements. The important factor ls not so much the elevation as is the range. A large range would vary conditions so

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

115

that those navigating the lake would have to build their docks to meet the conditions of extreme lo\v water, and at the same time they would always be .subjected to figuring out the depths carried at various elevations of the lake. Any misunderstanding in this regard might lead to disaster. Previous years of observations have shown that the lake never has reached an elevation lower than 6,223. In 1864 it reached the lowest of any known record which was 6,223.5. In 1862 it attained its maximum elevation .of 6,231. · That shows n natural range of 7.5 feet. For vessels drawing only 2 to 7.5 feet, which is the case with all vessels to consider on the lake, this range is of vital importance. The tendency would be to err in allowing for the height 11hov1~ the datum. To minimize the range and make it as near a constant as poi;:sible would be an aid to navigation. The ideal condition would be to keep the lake at a constant elevation. That condition ls impracticable owing to the rapid rising of the lake during the early summer m:onths when the snow begins to melt ; also, during the year there is an annual evaporation of from 30 to 36 inches. These to a certain extent compensate, and there is no doubt that the elevation of the lnke can be held more nearly a constant than its natural range would allow, by regulating the overflow at the Tru~kee River. The commercial navigational interests of the lali:e are at the present time almost solely centered in the Bliss Transportation Co. which has one steamer and two launches plying on the lake. The steamer is the Tahoe, which is 172 feet long, and draws 6 feet. The launches are the Meteor, drawing 7 feet, and the Nevada, drawing 6 feet. . The Tahoe makes one trip a day around t)1e lake during the summer, and one of the other two launches makes a round trip twice n week rluring the rest o:I' the year. · The remainder of the navigation on the lake is that of pleasure launches owned by property owners, and run for their own use. These launches are, in the majority, boats which CT.raw about 3 or 4 feet, and are from 25 to 50 feet in length. Previously there had been a small amount of lightering on the lake when the Carson Tahoe Lumber & Fluming Co. was engaged at logging on the Nevada shore. This company has not operated for several years past.· True to the general understnndlng, Lake Tahoe is userl almost solely as a summer resort. The people who make their homes here carry on industries which maintain the place as such. The total number of people remrtining nt the lake during the winter of 1918-19 was about 40, while it is estimated thnt about 6,000 are here during the middle of the summer season. Along the California coast of the lake it iR estimrtted there ar<' at 10ast 150 large summer homes, owned in the most part by wealthy people who spend their summer vacation at the lake. In addition to these homes there are 16 hotels, which accommodate from 50 to 500 guests each. Along the Nevada shore there are few resorts, Incline and Glenbrook 'being practically all the settlements. These two places were originally starten when the Lake Tnhoe Lumber & Fluming Co. wns operating on the lake. 'J'he topographic features of the silo.res of the lake are of two classes. On the California shore there is a tendenc~· to even mountain slopes leading down to the lake, while on the Nevatla side the irregular granite mountain slopes quite fr1.,'quently are steep and rugged. The lake appears to be locked in by mountains ranging from l,500 to 5,000 feet above the level of the lake. There are, however, a· number of draws through the mountains to the lnke, the principal one of these being between Truckee and Tahoe, where the Truckee River flows. - These high mountains furnish large watersheds for Lake Tahoe, and during the early summer the water from melting snow feeds the lake by eight fairly large mountnin streams. Truckee River, on the other hnnd, is the only outlet.

·REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Triangulation stations-White 1881, Black Hill 1881 and 83, and Cass 1883 and 1916-were recovered, the necessary signals erected, and the observations for the triangulation made between February 5 and 17. Preparation was made to take adyantage of favorable conditions for obtaining soundings in the entrance to the bay, but there were only two days on which it was possible to venture on the bar between February 12 and April 2. On these two days the neces><ary soundings outside the bay and on the bar were obtalnecl. _ The soundings taken indicate the width and <lPpths in the approach to the bay on the south side of Morro Rock, and the width and tlepths to a limited extent on the north side of the rock. There is no practicable entrance on the north sitle of Morro Rock. A large part of the ·area of the bay was covered by leveling instead of sounding from a boat. It was impracticnble to pass over the higher flats in a boat. At the southern end of the bay there is some area that is not covered by soundings. It was impracticable to pass over this area in a boat, and the mud flats are t,po soft to walk on. The weather conditions are most unfavorable at this time of the year for surveying operations at Morro. Only one boat ventured outside the bay between January 24 :'l.nd April 3. It was reported that she narrowly escaped swamping on her return. An automatic tide station was operated at Morro during the progress of the work. A tide staff was read near the head of the bay when sounding operations were in progress, and a 48-hour series of readings were observed while the current observtitions we1·e being made. 'l'wo current stations were occupied for a series of 25· hours each.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Hydrography: 0.5. square mile of area covered, 12.6 miles run while sounding, 394 positions determined (double angles). 761 soundings made, 1 hydrographic sheet finished. scale 1 : 5,000. ·

In 'July, 1918, instructions were issued for a resurvey of the Presidio Shoal, San Francisco Bay. · The field work was done between August 13 and 30, working only when the tide and wind were favorable. The soundings were reduced and plotted, and the original sheet was forwarded to the Washington office on September 17. A boat and crew were furnished by the Presidio Life Saving Station, and the assistant supervisor of the twelfth naval district detailed two officers of the naval reserve to assist in the work. · The resurvey indicates that the shoal has shifted its position by about its own width to the southward. It also indicates that the shoal has no rocky basis, being in fact formed by the meeting of the ebb currents from the northern and southern arms of San Francisco Bay, and the consequent release of the material carried in suspension by these currents. The greater amount of suspended material is carried from the northern arm of the bay, and where this current is reinforced by the volume rushing through Raccoon Strait and meeting the current from the southern arm, the greatest amount of material is dropped, forming the Presidio Shoal. The shoalest water, 21 feet, was found in two plnccs about 130 meters apart.

SUM.MARY OF RESULTs.-Reconnolssance: 5 square miles of area covered, 56 lines of lntervlslbility determined, 4 points selected for scheme. Triangulation: 14 square miles of a1·ea covered, lS signal poles erected, G stations occupied foi· horizontal measures, 18 geographic positions determined. Leveling : 2 bench marks established. Topography : 8.4 square mlles of area surveyed, 27.6 mlles of general coast line ·surveyed. 11.8 miles of creeks surveyed, 11.3 miles of roads· surveyed, 1 topog1·aphlc sheet finished, scale 1: 5,000. Hydrography: 1.7 square miles of area covered, 7,317 miles run while sounding, 993 positions determined (double' angles), 3,063 soundings made, 1 tide station established. 1 hydrographic sheet finished, scale 1 : 5,000.

In compliance .with instructions dated November 5, 1918, a pnrty was organized for a revision of the chart of Commencement Bay, Tacoma Harbor, Wash., and the actual field work wns begun on December 23, 1918. The Tacoma city engineers were interviewed and a thorough reconnoissance was made of the entire water front before laying out the work which was considered necessary. One week was spent in signal building and searching for the old triangulation station before the triangulation observations were started. The weather proved so thick and adverse for triangulation that it was decided to locate sufficient points for beginning the plane-table worJ;:, and to complete the triangulation observations at a later date when weathei· conditions should improve. With a few exceptions the methods employed were the usual Coast Survey procedure. Although the instructions called for chart revision work, so many changes were found in the Tacoma water front it was found necessary to make a resurvey of the water front, waterways, etc. Upon the advice of the inspector at Seattle, and with a view to future chart corrections, it was decided to do the hydrographic and topographic work on a scale of 1 : 5,000. All prominent objects which were considered· essential to the construction of a new chart were located by triangulation. Two blue prints were obtained, showing all railroad tracks and other topographic features, and enough points were located on these prints for transferring to the chart.. At several places the waterways were choked with logs, and it was found necessary to walk over the log rafts, taking. many detached soundings, which proved to be slow and. tedious work. A photostat copy of the previous work on a scale of 1 : 10,000 was used as a revision sheet for the topography outside the limits of the topographic sheet on which the present work was done. AH the topographic features along the water front falling within the limits of chart No. 6451, were corrected on this sheet and the hydrography was tested at a number of different places, but no changes could be found. With the exception of taking left angle practically all the instrument work was done by the chief of party. The tid~ fiats at Tacoma are surrounded by highlands in most directions. It ts due to this fact that the smolrn from the many factory chimneys settles down over the tidelands, maldng the atmosphere extremely thick and unfavorable for field instrument work. For the same reason the wind does not readily carry the fog away. In general the weather conditions were extremely adverse and field work could be accomplished only on an average of about one-thir'd of the working time. Southerly storms, lasting several days at a

time, often accompanied by hail or snow, were frequent. The weather conditions improved to some extent during the last two weeks of t:P,e season. The work was done in close and accurate detail, and is believed to be entirely sufficient for the construction of a new chart. A number of triangulation stations were substantially marked for use in the future revision work. The season's work wui:; closed on l\1arch 31, and in accordance with instructions, the chief of party was ready to take over the steamers Patterson and Explorer on April 1 in compliance with the executive order for the retransfer of these from the Navy. From April 1 to June 30, 1919, the chief of party was in command of the steamers Explorer and Patterson. An inspection was made of one of the chart agencies of the Survey at Seattle, and various duties were perforrued relating to the transfer and shipping of propert~'. caring for wire-drag launches and property, and preparation of inventorieR.

[GEORGE D. COWIE.]

nESULTS.-Reconnoissance: 11 stations selected for plimary triangulation. Triangulation: 11 ohservatlon stands erected for primary work, 80 stands erected for supplementary stations, 2 stations occupied for observations.
SUMMARY m'

In May, 1919, work was begun on the extension of primary and secondary triangulation in Utah over an area indicated by the Forest Service. On May 7 the observer arrived in Ogden, and after conference with the Forest Service officials there, made final preparations for field work at Richfield, Utah. About l\1ay 17 reconnoissance for primary triangulation was begun, and by June 9 eleven stations were established, and observation stands were erected. During this time several parties comprised of men from the Forest Service, running expenses paid by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, were in the field, erecting supplementary stations to give immediate control over the Fish Lake, Dillmore, and Manti Forest Reserves. These parties set up about one pole, with banners, per day while in the field. In all nearly 80 supplementary stations were erected. On June 17 the observing party and light keepers left Richfield for their various stations, and on the 19th observations were begun at the old 1882 Tusher triangulation station of the United States transcontinental line. This station was completed and observations half completed at Station Monroe by June 30. One United States motor truck and one rented car were used in addition to horses.

IlESULTS.-Heconnoissance: 8 points 'selected for scheme. Triangulation: 16 observing tripods built (all stands except one 12-foot signal), 1 observing scall'old built, height 12 feet, 2 stations In main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 2 sta tlons occupied for vertical measures, 1 eleva tl~n determined trigonometrlcally.

su~iMAilY OF

On April 11 Mr. Hodgson left the office to take up the work called for in the instructions of the superintendent, dated April 7, 1919, which provided first for a reconnoissance for control stations over ·portions of the Arizona national forests for the benefit of the Forest Service topographers, and later for an extension of primary triangulation from the Texas-California arc over the areas to be controlled, and thence eastward along the El Reno-Needles nrc, the reconnoissance for which was done in 1916. · On the way out a stop was made at Albuquerque to consult with the district forester and with the topographer in charge of the work. A reconnoissance trip in conjunction with Mr. Daves, the topographer, was arranged for, and a small amount of outfit obtained from the district office. The time from April 21, on which date the chief of party arrived at Prescott, until the early part of June was taken up in the preliminary J.'.econ11oi1;snnce, in making arrangements for thP building party under the charge of Signalman Lutz to take the field, and in securing light keepers.

Six of the eight light keepers were finally secured by June 2, and since they had been leaving as rapidly as they could be secured, the chief of party deeided to leave with only a couple of days training of the new arrivals. The light keepers left for their stations on June 4, and the observing party started to the first station at Harquahalla. From that time to the end of the month the worlc was actiVely prosecuted.

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Reconnoissance: Length of scheme 245 miles, 3,520 square miles of area covered, 53 points selected for scheme. Base lines primary (selected) Jacksonville, length 4i miles. 'l'raverse (reconnoissance) 1 length 185 miles. ~riangula tion : 48 observing tripods built, total height 2,193 feet, 48 observing scatrolds built, total height 2,797 feet.

In October, 1918, a party was organized for the purpose of making a reconnoissance from the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation in the vicinity of Waco, Tex., eastward to the Mississippi River. This work had been requested by the Chief of l<Jngineers, United 8tates Army, to furnish data to be used in military mapping. The chief of party arrived at Waco, Tex., October 24, and began the preliminary worlc of collecting and repairing the automobile trucks to be used in transporting the party. The work of selecting stations for the primary triangulation was then taken up, and by January 3 the reconnoissance had been completed, and stations selected from points in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation eastward to the vicinity of Jacksonville, Tex., and a preliminary reconnoissance had been made for the purpose of selecting the best route for triangulation from Jacksonville eastward to Robeline,. La. On account of the heavy rains and bad condition of roads, it was not practicable to continue the reconnoissance to the river at that time. On January 3, the chief of party returned to Waco, Tex., to organize a building party, and start building signals. At 'Vaco the outfit and trucks were overhauled, a party organized, and on l"ebruary 1 the party and outfit were ready for the field. Building signals and preparing the stations were extended from the ninety-eighth meridian triungulation stations eastward, and by April 12 the building was completed to the vicinity of Jacksonville. From Jacksonville east the stations were selected during the process of building. Heavy continuous rains kept the roads in \Jad condition, and !Hlded considerably to the difficulties of the work. Stations were selPctetl and signals built for primary triangulation to Mansfield, La. It was not practicable to extend triangulation to the eastwurd of Mansfield, on account of the high timber, fiat low country, \Jad roads, and unfavorable conditions. A reconnoissunce was made for primary traverse from Mansfield to the Mississippi River at Vidalia. Stations were selected and signals built for primary traverse from Station U'ield to the Texas & Pacific Railroad. During the progress of work, descriptions of stations, and progress sketches were furnished the chief of the o\Jserving party, and to the office. By June 30 the uctual field work of reconnoissance and building had been completed for the triangulation, and the party was preparing to mov(~ to Oklahoma, and take up work in the execution of instructions dated June 23, 1919. The total length of the scheme for primary triangulation from the ninetyeighth meridian triangulation to Mansfield, La., is 245 miles. There are 44 stations in the main scheme, 2 LaPlace stations, and 1 base line. Three primary traverse stations were selected at which signals were built, and the stations marked to make the connection from a station of the triangulation to a station on the Texas & Pacific Railway track at Mansfield. This traverse connection was made by staking about 450 meters from Station Field to a station on the Kansas City Southern Railway, then along the Kansas City Southern Railway track northward to the Texas & Pacific Railway, crossing at South Mansfield, a distance of about 1! miles. The total length of the scheme selected for primary traverse from Mansfield to Vidalia is about 185 miles. The route selected is from Mansfield to Alexandria, on the Texas & Pacific Railroad, Alexandria to Georgetown, Georgetown to Vidalia, on the St .. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway.

On May 9 instructions were given for the organization of a party and the erection of tall hydrographic signals on the coast of Delaware for the use of the steamer Jsi8, and later instructions were given for the location of prominent land marks. Supplemental instructions were afterwards issued for the running of a traverse, for the recovery of old triangulation stations, and the location of new stations, if necessary, within the requirements of tertiary triangulation. On June 23 instructions were issued at the request of the Navy Department, for determining the positions of the Navy radio compass stations at Bethany Beach, Cape Henlopen, and Cape May, and then to close work. On May 12 headqual'ters were established at Lewes, Del., and bids for supplies obtained in Lewes and Wilmington, Del. 'l'he necessary hands were hired. From May 12 to May 22 the chief of party was occupied at Lewes, Del.,, in reconnoissance, triangulation, obtaining supplies, and organizing party. On May 23 the party was moved to Ocean View, Del., where a tall type of hydrographic signal was constructed over the triangulation station on Cotton Patch Hill, reaching to .a height of 115 feet above high water. 'J;his signal was erected on a sand hill 40 feet in elevation. The signal was completed on May 30 and the party returned to Lewes, Del. On June 2, 1919, the lumber, wire, and signal-building outfit were hauled to triangulation station, Midway, 2! miles south of Rehoboth, on the narrow stl'ip of land between Rehoboth Bay and the ocean. The next day construction of a tall-type signal was commenced over this station by the chief of party and four men, and completed to a height of 120 feet above high water on June 13, two and one-half clays being Jost by bad weather. From June 14 to June 30, inclusive, the chief of party was occupied on triangulation, locating all prominent objects useful to navigation and the survey work of the steamer Isi8.

On September 28, 1918, instructions were issued to Mr. Garner to carry a scheme of primary triangulation or primary traverse from the eastern oblique arc triangulation in the vicinity of Madison to the Norfolk-Savannah line of primary traverse in the vicinity of Sanford, N. C. The instructions also called for a line of precise levels which should extend from the vicinity of Greensboro to Sanford, N. C. Reconnoissance for this work began about October 15, and was finished about November 18. It was decided that it was b'est to have triangulation from the oblique arc to Sanford. The observations for the work began shortly after November 1. Considerable difficulty was encountered in getting off the large figures of the old triangulation to connect with the new work on account of haze. That part of the scheme of triangulation which makes a connection with the primary traverse which extends from Savannah, Ga., to Norfolk, Va., was done by the party of Max Steinberg. This connection was made, and the two parties completed the '\Vork at the encl of December, 1918.

Azimuth was observed at numerous points between stations Southern and Forsyth, antl all lines were remeasured and errors located. This section was finished October 2. Between October 3 and 8, all measurements in and near Macon were checked, and several stations were occupied for horizontal angles, in order to detect and correct errors. On the completion of this work check measurements were made on the lines from Macon to Columbus, and Macon to Brunswick. The checking of the measurements on the line from Macon to Columbus was begun October 9, and completed November 10. The remeasurement of the line from Macon to Brunswick was begun November 10, and completed December 14. The measurement of the line from Macon to Savannah was next taken up, and the line was completed and field work closed on February 16, 1919. On February 17 an investigation was made of the traverse base at Dublin, and on February 26 tlile observer reported at the Washington office.

On June 2, · 1919, instructions were received to remeasure the angles on the primary traverse line, Macon to Forsyth, Ga. . Up to June 30, 1919, 45 of these stations had been recovered, 39 signal tripods built, and 16 had been occupied and the angles remeasured with a 12-inch direction instrument, using eight positions at each station. In remeasuring these angles, tripod signals were built to give clearance above the track and ground of not less than 6 feet, and in most cases the line of sight was 15 to 20 feet above the ground. The tripods were built rigid, and great care was exercised in the centering of the signal pins and the instrument over the station mark. · An auto truck was u~d for transportation along the public highway, which is in most cases near the Central of Georgia Railway tracks. This, probably, was the Cheapest means of transportation for this particular piece of work, as the employment of conductors when motor cars are used is very expensive. While the hire of the truck was a little greater than ordinary, owing to the unusual demand, the truck proved very efficient. In case there was much rain, the Georgia red-clay roads would be almost impassable with a truck.

The actual observing started on April 15. By the end of the fiscal ~·ear the worlc had been completed nearly to Mansfield, La. There remained only seven stations to be occupied. There were a number of high towers in the scheme of triangulation, and at times the wind made them unsteady. Nevertheless, the closures of the triangles averaged only about one second. 'l'he worlc was made·difficult at times by heavy rains. Electric signal lights with dry-cell batteries were used throughout the season and proved most satisfactory.

During the ·season beginning July 1, 1918, and ending December 29, 1918, the following work was accomplished: . Lines of primary traverse and precise leveling were extended from the vicinity of Seaboard, N. C., to Moncure, N. C., where connection was made with the traverse from Savannah, Ga., over the tracks of the Seaboard Air Line Railway, and from Wilmington, N. C., to-Sanford, N. C., over the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. From Sanford northwestward the character of the country was more favorable for triangulation than for traverse. A scheme of triangulation was started from two adjoining lines of the Norfolk-Savannah traverse as a base and carried 25 miles toward the oblique arc, and connection was· made with the triangulation carried down from the oblique arc by C. L . .Garner. On July 1, 1918, the work had been completed to Seaboard, N. C. It was continued from there to Moncure, N.

[CLEM L. GARNER.] SUMMARY OF RNSULTS.-Heconno!ssance (for primary travers'!i): Length of scheme 140 miles ; 180 points selected for scheme. Primary traverse: 50 square miles of area covered, 180 signal poles erected, 83 observing scaffolds and tripods built, heights from 4 to 70 feet, average height 12 feet, 54 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures! 126 stations in supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 200 geograph c positions determined. Precise leveling: 140 miles .of levels run. Azimuth : 3 azimuth stations occupied.

On July 8, 1918, the charge of the primary traverse and precise leveling party of M. E. Lutz was transferred to Clem L. Garner, at Camden, S. C. During the period between July 12 and October 7, the line of primary traverse and precise leveling was continued from Camden, to which point the work had been carried by M. E. Lutz, to a junction with the work of Max Steinberg · at a point about 2 miles to the southward of Moncure, N. C. The traverse followed the Seaboard Air- Line Railway for the entire distance. The field work on the traverse and leveling was done between July 12 and October 7, 1918, a period of two and three-fourths months, during which time the progress was 139 miles, or an average of 50 miles per month. The work was over a very crooked road where the curves were long, and averaged only about three-quarters of a mile apart. The progress of the leveling was necessarily held down to the same amount of mileage, since the traverse stations were used as bench marks, and the leveling could not be clone before the marks harl been set and the concrete seasoned at least one day. . Practically all of this work consisted of short traverse lines connected to main-scheme stations several miles apart, thus forming so-called loops. This system increased the cost of the work somewhat, but furnished a valuable means of checking the accuracy of the work. Several improvements were made in the methods of operation with the object of eliminating some of the errors occurring in traverse work. During the season a number of photographs were taken to illustrate the operations of the party. Motor velocipede cars were used for the transportation of the party and Instruments.

The observations were ·repeated latei'. in the month. The magnet was also removed and oscillated in a horizontal plane. '.rhe general conclusion, reached was that the scale values derived from the methou of oscillations and from deflections were in practical agreement. The performance of the seismograph has been satisfactory, It is recommended by the observer that a better type of circuit-breaking clock for marking the time be provided. It is also recommended that a new seismograph house be built, or at least the present one be improved or remodeled. so as to obviate the intem~e humidity of the air that prevails in the rooru where

the seismograph is situated, as the clocks and all the delicate parts of the seismograph are being badly injured by rust. The special work during the year was the development of the theory of the balanced magnet Z variometer. The application of the theory to the designing of vertical intensity variometers was outlined, and it was shown how a vertical intensity variometer could be made free from drift due to the weakening of the magnets, am1 to the secular change in the vertical intensity.

SUMMARY OF BESULTS.-Triangulatlon (tertiary) : 28 square miles of area covered, 18 signal poles erected, 16 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 18 geographic positions determined. Topouraphy : 16 square miles of area surveyed, 21 miles of coast line surveyed, 4 miles oF creeks surveyed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1 : 10,000. Hydrography : 1 square mile of area covered, 34 miles run while sounding, 696 positions determined (double angles), 2,847 soundings made, 3 tidal stations established, 2 hydrographic sheets finished, scale 1 : 2,500.

A party was organized in July, 1918, to make a hyllrographic surve~· of the north end of Wrangell Narrows in vicinity of Petersburg, southeastern Alaska. The steamer Cosmos was assigned for the transportation of the party. Field work began July 25, and closed August 28. The work contemplated was a close development by sounding, and with the harbor sweep of an area extending from a point opposite Petersburg to the north end of Wrangell Narrows, where the latter empties into Frederick Sound. The harbor sweep was used for the purpose of locating possible bowlders. Most of the old triangulation stations were recovered, and by the addition of two new stations located by sextant cuts, sufficient control for the work was obtained. The soundings were talrnn very close together, and in addition to the depths shown on the sheet, many hours were spent in feeling over the bottom for possible bowlders. The verJ1 large scale on which the work was done, and the strong currents running in whirlpools and eddies which would set the launch in all directions at times, made an accurate development extremely difficult. The harbor-sweep work was attended with so many difficulties that at time1:1 it seemed an impossibility to cover the ground by this method. In order to withstand the force of the current it was necessary to use 2-inch pipe on the sweep, which made it very heavy, and it was operated with great difficulty by the few men who could work in the contracted space on the stern of the launch. With a maximum current of 5 knots, the sweep extending 30 feet below the surface of the water, the difficulties in maneuvering the launch to cover accurately an area with a sweep pipe only 6 meters wide were extreme. Each day the party continued work as long as the current would permit, when the pipes would break and make it necessary to lay off for repairs. During the work the sweep broke 12 times, and much time was consumed in repair work. Buoys were planted and located, which helpad to keep the launch within the area which was being deyeloped, and by continued effort the ground was covered as closely as possible. 'rhe several small spaces between the recorded sweep lines were also covered in maneuvering the launch back and forth during the process of starting a line. The results obtained agree very closely with the original survey made in 1910. At a point 180 meters N. 60 W. (true) from signal boat, a depth of 12 feet was obtained where 14 feet was previously shown. This is considered one of the crucial spots of the work, and from all reports (including eyewitnesses) it is where several vessels have grounded. After the completion of this survey the superintendent of lighthouses at Ketchikan, Alaska, stated his intentions of placing a buoy on this spot, and a blue print was furnished him by this party for use in locating same. On August 31 the Cosmos left Petersburg for Ketchilmn, arriving the same day. After making necessary preparations, including a trip to Metlakatla to obtain equipment needed for worlr required at Keete Inlet, the vessel left Ketchikan on September 5, arriving at Keete Inlet the same afternoon. On the next day the Cosmos was unloaded, a camp, tide staff, and bench marks were established, and 011 tile following day the Cosmos proceeded to Craig, Alaska, to remove the automatic tide gauge which had been in operation there. Three days' tidal observations were made simultaneously at Craig and Keete Inlet, and after leveling to the bench marks and removing the tide gauge the Cosmo.~ returned to Keete Inlet on September 11. The season's work at Keete Inlet opened September 11 1111rl closed September 30, during which period there were but 16 working days. In this time a scheme of triangulation consisting of 18 stations and 8 figures m the main scheme was completed, and 1 topographic sheet was completed.

Keete Inlet was found to extend about twice as far inland as shown on the chart, which proportionately increased the work required to be done. The Cosmo.~ returned to Ketchikan October 6, where a site was selected for a proposeu boathouse. Three days were spent ·in establishing an automatic tide gauge, bench marks, and tide staff at Ketchikan, and two days in laying up the Cosmos at Metlakatla. The party sailed for Senttle on October 19, arriving Oetober 21.
[E. R. HAND.] SUMMARY OF nESUL'.L's.-·.ropography: 1 square mile of area surveyed 5 miles ·of general coas~ line surveyed, 1 topograph\c sheet finished, scale 1 : 5.000. Hydrography : 1.3 square mlles of area covered~ 79.7 miles run while sounding, 1,603 positions determined (double angles), 3,763 sounaings made, 2 hydrographic sheets finished, scale 1: 5,000. Hydrography (wire drag) : 24.8 square miles of area dragged, 59.8 miles run while dragging, 2,139 positions determined (double angles), 3 wire-drag sheets finished, scales 1 : 2,000 and 1 ; 5,000.

The wire-drag survey at Anchorage, Knik Arm, Alaska, In progress at the beginning of the fiscal· year, was· completed July 28. On account of the rapid currents in this locality the use of the drag was possible only at the time of slack water, :md to insure accuracy, it was necessary to supplement the work of the drag by sounding with the lead over places where the depths appcnred doubtful. So far as conditions permitted the drag was set to within 3 to 5 feet of the bottom, and to a depth of about 30 feet. Inside the 30-foot curve the water shoals rapidly, and is not to be regarded as navigable. · No dangers were found of importance to shipping. In the area immediately south of a point midway between Woronzof and Mackenzie, the drag often caught on spots with less water than indicated by the soundings. The drag passed over them all when set at 35 feet. This locality ls not in the· steamer track of vessels. The drag was passed a number of times over the previously reported shoal that lies northwestward and a half mile from the proposed wharf. Sounding developed a least depth of 33 feet; the wire brought up at 30 feet but cleared at an effective depth of 27. Vessels should be careful when maneuvering around the new wharf at low tide, but at present it ls well up beyond the fairway. On July 30 the party left Anchorage for Port Chatham, arriving on August 1. At Port Chatham quarters were found with the Whitney & Lass Mining Co., which is developing valu11ble chrome ore holdings in the vicinity of Claim Point. Since this company was having difficulties through the refusal ()f the steamsnp companies, on account of inadequate surveys, to send vessels to their wharf, and as the immediate neecl for this ore in munitions making was the determining factor in sending the party to this place, an investigation was first begun of the bight between Kelp anrl Claim Points where the. mine dock is located. A detailed topographic and hydrographic survey was made on a scale of 1 : 5,000, without finding any hidden obstructions. A beacon and a range were established, and blue prints of the survey made, and on August 23, 23 days after the arrival of the party, vessels began to come to the wharf for ore. After issuing the chart, operations with the drag showed that shoal water extends farther off Claim Point than previously shown, though nothing dangerous was found. Tracings were made showing the additional soundings off Claim Point, and furnished to those to whom the blue prints had been sent, and one was forwarded to the Seattle field station, that the data might appear on future prints from the original tracing filed there. No sounding was done at Port Chatham except for the above-mentioned survey, and the plane-table work outside of these consisted in locating signals for the wire·drag operations. The drag work was carried up to the head of Port Chatham oyer all the nuvii<able urea unrl anchorage ground. The dragging was extended from outf;ide Ch11thnm Island through all the waters of less than 20 fathoms depth across to l·Jlizubeth Islaud, and ovm· all of the nrea in the west entrauce between this island and the mainland to the 20-fathom curve, running into the bight between Kelp nrnl Claim Points where the rninl11g camp is situated. Rpots off tho west end o~ Elizabeth Island and off Koyoktolik Bay, delllgnated in the instructions for thlR work, were swept over. A group of irrei.,'1llar soundings on chart 8,580 on the eaRt f!ide of the channel between Elizabeth Island uml the mninland, und Pnst of the north end of that island, anrl rlirectly in th~ steamer tmck, was dragged over without result.

For the reduction of soundings simultaneous observations of tides were made, and referred to a bench mark established at the head of the port by H. W. Rhodes in 1906. Three permanent tidal bench marks were estublishe1\ on the cliffs at the end of the mine wharf opposite the tide staff. A small drag handled by a motor dory and a pulling boat wns devised for the purpose of sweeping close to the bottom in areas where the longer drag and the· launches coultl not be used to advantage, About the middle of September the party proceeded to Seldovia to investigate a reported rock near the Anderson wharf.. This rocl,, with 9 feet of water over it, was found 180 feet off this dock. The water front was revised while locating ,signals. Work at Seldovia and Port Chatham was completed September 24, and on the 27th the party left for Seattle, Wash., arriving October 13. Work at Halibut Cove, Kachemak Bay, for which orders had been issued, was not undertaken owing to the lateness of the season.

Field magnetic observations in Alaska begun in June, 1918, were in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year, two stations, Eagle and Circle, having been occupied. Between .July 1 and the close ·of the season on October 12 observations of the three magnetic elements were made at the stations named above. Of the Yukon Hiver stations established in 1908, which were reoccupied during this season, only one, that at Circle, could be found. Observations were secured in the immediate vicinity of the old station, and a new station was established nearly a mile south of the former station. At Fort Yukon, the station which in lflOS was placed about 150 feet from the river bank, was found to be only 20 feet away from the bank, due to the river undermining ancl cutting away the bank. At this place repeat observations were obtained at the old station, and then a new station was established about one-fourth mile back from the river, in order to insure a determination of the annual change at a future date. · All other stations along the Yukon River were found intact, and most of them in a fair state of preservation. · New stations were established on the Tanana River at Hot Springs, Nenana, and Fairbanks. Stations were established at Chitina and McCarthy along the Copper River Railway; at Cordova, Fort Liscum, and Seward in the vicinity of Prince William Sound; at Anchorage, Matanuslm Junction, Chicaloon, and Montana Creek along the new Government railway, and at Alitak Bay at the southern end of Kodiak Island. After the return of the observer to Sitka comparison observations were obtained with the set of field instruments and the observatory instruments.
SITKA MAGNETIC OBSERVATORY. [F. P. ULRICH,)

The usual observations were recorded during the year with practi~ally no interruption. The magnetic variation instruments have continued in satisfactory QPeration. Absolute observations were made each week. Comparison observations necessary on account of the change in location of the absolute observatory, and for instrumental comparisons, were made in October. · Time corrrectlons were obtained each week at the local cable office of the United States Signal Corps. Time signals are receiyed each day by cable from Mare Island. The seismograph was kept in almost continuous operation, and 20 shocks were recorded, all of small magnitude. A new fence was put around the office lot, a new· walk put down, and the grading of the lot was completed. A new azimuth mark was set, and the azimuth determined by angular measurements from the old azimuth mark. Meteorological observati.ons consisting of temperature and barometer readings, state of the weather, and other meteorol-0gical phenomenon were continued. Necessary repairs were made to the office buildings. 139138-19-9

record was obtained with the magnetograph and seismograph. The usual absolute observations were made of the declination, dip, and horizontal intensity. Adjustments were made of the D and H variometers, the seismograph, and the earth inductor. Scale-value observations were made once each month, and more frequently when the necessity arose on account of the adjustment of an instrument. On October 11, a severe earthquake shock occurred at the west end of Porto Rico, and during the remainder of the month a constant succession of tremors of varying intensity were recorded on the seismograph. On November 12 a strong shock was recorded from the same region, and then the tremors practically ceased. At the beginning of the first severe shock the recording needles were jarred 'from the pivots of both components, but a good record of the second strong shock was obtained upon the E-'V component, although the needle of the N-S component was jarred from the drum. The two experts, Prof. Reid and Prof. Jagger, who were sent by the GoYernment to Investigate the cause and results of this earthquake, visited the observatory, and examined a good typical record made on November 12. The only instrument disturbed by the earthquake was the D variometer, .which was slightly jarred out of level. Several other strong earthquake shocks, apparently from South America. were also recorded. Tremors of slight intensity were noted occasionally which had the same general appearance as those occurring during the large disturbances of October, 1918, in Porto Rico. It was found necessary to make a readjustment of the long magnet of the magnetometer. · Readings of the meteorological instruments were taken each day. Two compass declinometers were standardized, and special scalings were taken from the magnetograms for the period of the eclipse of May 29, 1919.

On July 1, 1918, the topographic survey of the Virgin Islunc1s. hegun in February, 1918, at the request of the Navy Department, was in progress. The work contemplated included a complete scheme of triangulation extended from the line "East End, Vieques Island to Savana Island," established in 1900; the measurentent of a base line on each of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, detailed topography of the shore line and entire area of the islands on a scale of 1 : 10,000, with contour intervals of 20 feet, and the determination of magnetic declination with the compass declinometer. As the survey 'vas undertaken at the ·request of the Navy Department, the governor of the islands, the civil engineer of the Navy in <!harge of engineering operation on the islands, and the commanding officer of the naval vessel stationed at St. Thomas were consulted from time to time. As the result of these consultations several pieces of work were done for -the Navy, nncl tracings of positions of the topographic sheets were furnished ·when desired. Up to .July 1 the triangulation had been carried as far ns ·the passage between St. Thon:as and St. John. ·From there it was continued eastward until

on December 31 the whole scheme in this direction was nearly completed. A few of the most eastern stations remained to be established and occupied. Five stations were established on neighboring British territory, and sites for two more were selected, making seven in all. Central-point figures were used rather than quadrilaterals. These gave the greatest number of stations on both sides of the islands of St. Thomas and St. .John with which to cut in stations for topographic control with the least number of angles to observe. Stations were established about 1 mile apart along the shore line, and cut in by triangulation. Flags were placed in trees on top of the prominent hills, and located by triangulation. These were for the topographic control. All stations, except the flags on the hilltops, were permanently marked and described. At the beginning of the fiscal year about half of the field work on topographic sheets A, B, and C was finished. By December 31 all of these sheets, with the exception of a couple of days' work on outlying islands, which work was prevented by high seas, and sheet E were finished, and about half of sheet D. The office work on sheets B and C was practically completed. The numerous trails, called roads, were so winding that they were run in most cases by plane-table compass traverses, the· elevation being carried forward with the alidade, and checked wherever a triangulation flag was visible. The traverse was checked by three-point fixes wherever possible. A considerable part of the islands was under cultivation during the slave days, but the islands are now covered by dense growths of vines, bush, and trees from 15 to 30 feet high. This made the interior topography difficult. On this account frequent topographic stations were established and marked along the various trails wherever a good three-point determination could be obtained, so that future surveyors could have plenty of points to which to tie in the land surveys. ·Two topographic parties were ·in continuous operation. Each party was in charge of an officer. There were four men to a party. In the course of the triangulation tangent cuts were taken to Little Tobag-0 Island, Big Tobago Island, and Watson Rock. These cuts plotted on the existing chart put the islands several hundred meters farther west than shown on the chart. St. Thomas and St. John seem to be fairly correct. When the arrangements were being made in Washington to begin this .survey, it was thought that one year, at the most, would be needed to complete it. However, before the first two topographic sheets were finished, it was seen that the entire survey. could not be finished within one year. It was found that the country was more heavily timbered than had been thought, and consequently it was more difficult to obtain the desired· accuracy and detail. By January 1, 1919, the triangulation had been carried as far eastward as Estate Carolina, on St. John, and most of the other stations in the St. John scheme had been established. The base lines of St. Thomas and St. John had been measured. Field work on topographic sheets B, C, and E was completed, and that on sheet A practically so. Sheet D was about. half finished and sheet F was just started. In other words the triangulation of St. Thomas and St. John was ninetenths finished; five-sixths of the topography of St. Thomas and one-fifth that of St. John were completed. The triangulation was continued in the same manner as previously. The remaining stations of the St. John scheme were occupied. These included stations on the neighboring British islands. On February 1, the triangulation in that section being finished, the chief of party broke camp, and moved to St. Thomas, where arrangements were made to move headquarters to St. Croix. While in St Thomas the chief of party called upon the Governor of the Virgin Islands to inform him regarding the progress of the survey. and to request the assistance of a submarine chaser when the surve~· of Frenchman's Cap ·was made. and when the inter-island triangulation was ca1·ried out. The governor said that the matter would be given consideration. Headquarters were moved to St. Croix on February 9. A month was spent on office worlt, consisting of getting up the semiannual report, and computing geographic positions. The party started to build triangulation signals on St. Croix, March 12. A. base site was selected, and the base net laid out. The base line was not meas-

ured, however, until May 2 as it was desired to have the services of the men from one of the topographic parties when the measuring was done. This was in <;>rder to save expenses as well as to have experienced men handling the tape. In order to have the base line a multiple of 25 meters, and thus avoid a measurement of 10 or 15 meters with the steel pocket tape, one end of the base line was not established until the base-tape support stakes were set. Consequently no triangulation station from which this end of the base line was to be observed on could be occupied until the base was measured, without the necessity of reoccupying the station. Therefore a large part of the base-net scheme was established, and signal poles erected before any observing was done. · ·~quadrilateral composed of the stations East End (Vieques), Saba, Mount Eagle (St. Croix), and.Caledonia (near Hams Bluff Ligllt) was selected as the best means of carrying the geographic position and azimuth over to St. Croix. Tlie observing on this quadrilateral was delayed until all field work on the topography of St. John was finished. Arrangements were made for the use of a submarine chaser to take the party to Vieques, and stand by until the survey was finished. Everything was in readiness on May 12, so the various light keepers and observers took their stations. The party at each of the four stations had an electric signal lamp, an acetylene signal lamp, and a heliotrope. Atmospheric conditions were bad the first week, but all of the observing at the four stations was completed the second week. Four sets of observations were taken. A set consisted of six measures of each angle with the telescope· direct, and six of the explement with the telescope reversed. The electric lamps were found to give the best satisfaction. They threw a smaller but stronger beam of light than the acetylene lamps, and, consequently, could be seen better by the observer. The heliotropes could not be seen over the long sides· and diagonals except occasionally. The longest distance was 63,418 meters. · After the interisland triangulation was completed all parties were moved to St. Croix. There the topographers did office work on their St. Thomas and St. John sheets, the chief of party carried on the triangulation, and the new officer sent down to relieve one of the others did computing. At the close of the fiscal year the triangulation of St. Croix had been extended from the western end of the island to Chtistiansted. Two topographic parties were kept In the field as previously. They finished the topography of St. Thomas on February 10, and of St. John on May 3. The topographers then assisted in the interisland triangulation, after which they did office work on their sheets. It was desired to send the sheets to Washington as soon as possible, therefore: no field work on St. C).'oix was allowed to interfere with the completion of these sb~ets for mailing. A field draftsman assisted in the inking -of the sheets. ·· · An automobile was used for the triangulatiou on St .. Croix. This proved to be an efficient method of transportation. A submarine chaser was placed at the disposal of the party for the survey of, Frenchmans Cap and the interisland triangulation. Endeavor was made to comply with the wishes of the Navy officials, and for that purpose frequent consultations· \vere hltd with the various aids to the governor. They, in their turn, were very courteous, and rendered all possible assistance to the party.

HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. HONOLULU 1\IAGNETIC OBSERVATORY.
[FRANK NEUMANN.]

At the magnetic observatory at Ewa, Hawaii, the three magnetic variometers were kept in continuous operation, and double sets of absolute observations were made weekly, in order to determine buse-line values. Scale-value observations were made monthly on the two intensity variometers as heretofore. Very little trouble was experienced with the working of these instruments, and the only abrupt changes of base line occurred when necessary adjustments were made in December. The scale value at the Z variometer shows a uniform increase.

The Milne seismograph was also kept in continuous operation, and all earthquakes were recorded. As the past winter was one of the driest in years, no trouble was experienced on account of humidity or tilting of the pendulum. All computations and tabulations were submitted as heretofore. Base-line values were determined, and the hourly means of the three magnetic variometer traces were tabulated-also maximum and minimum ordinates. Reports were nlso submitted of all earthquakes. Time obseryations were made three or four times a month with a sextant. · Meteorological observations were made as follows: Antemeridian, inside and outside humidity; postmeridian, outside humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures, and rainfall. Outside thermograph traces were obtained and the general state of the weather noted. Monthly reports were submitted to the local Weather Bureau office in Honolulu.

During the year the field work of the survey was with a reduced force, tli.e number of ships in commission being three-the Pathfinder, F'atlloiner, and Rombron, instead of the five that were continuously employed previous to the war. In consequence of this reduction in force the output of field sheets was eui·tailed, and also the output of finished drawings from the Manila office. The latter was also affected by the outbreak of Spanish influenza in Manila, which at one time resulted in the absence of more than one-half of the office force. The same disease ran its course among the complements of the surveyhag vessels. First, nnd in u mild form, it went through the Ji'athomcr; Intel' it lnill up the crew and officers of the Roinblon; and finally, in a more severe form, it struck the Pathfinder while she was engaged in hel' regular work on the Palawan coast, and took toll of eight lives from among the Filipino crew before it was finally overcome. It should be stated that the· victims were among those who had joined the ship at Puerta Princesa or had been previously subject to the malarial fevers which are so prevalent on the Palit'wan coast. There were no changes in personnel in the office during the period covered hy this report und the routine continued as usual. Tracings for two new charts and two complete new editions of charts and four tracings for correction pieces, were forwarded to the Washington office, besides miscellaneous corrections aml new information for reprints of other charts. On June 30 there were 10 chart drawings, consisting of new charts; new editions, or correction pieces, in progress. More .than the usual amount of miscellaneous work was done in furnishing navigators with advance information,· and the military, naval, and insular authorities with tracings of field sheets, or blue prints from those tracings. The computing division contilmed us usual to care for the triangulation and tidal records, furnish data to the various United States Government and insular authorities as requested, and to keep up the office computations. The chart division attended to the- sale of charts and other publications, and distributed Sections VI and VII of .the Philippine Islands Sailing Directions, which' were received from the printer subsequent to July 1. The manuscript copy of Philippine Const Pilot, Part I, wus completed in August, und sent to Washington to be printed. 'l'he geographical division of the office continued the work of prepadng topographical maps of various sections of the islands. The tracings for ·map No. 6 were forwarded to Washington to be printed in December. This map covers the eastern part of central Luzon. Map No. 100, covering the entire Archipelago on u scale of 1 : 1,000,000, was in process of printing during the first half of the fiscal year. Four other topographic maps were in hand on June 30 in various stages of preparation. Regular meetings of the Philippine Committee on Geographical Names were held monthly, and a great amount of work was accomplished toward correcting and unifying the spelling of .names of the barrios of the island. The card index of these names was completed, and has heen of grent assistance. By its help much has been done to make the Rpelling of the same names alike in the various Provinces.

REPORT OF SUPERINTENDENT, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
[A. M. SOBIERALSKI, Commanding Steamer Pathfinder.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Triangulation : 122 square miles of area covered, 11 signal poles erected, 1 observin~ tripod and scatl'old built (height 104 feet), 8 stations in main scheme occupied for horizontal measures, 18 stations in supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 5 stations occupied for vertical measures, 24 geographic positions determined, 12 elevations determined trogonometrlcally. Topograllhy: 404 square miles of area surveyed, 98 miles of general coast line surveyed, 56 mi es of shore line of rivers surveyed, 4 miles of shore line of creeks survexed, 22 miles of roads surveyed, 7 topographic sheets finished, scales 1 : 20,000, 1 : 40,000. and 1 : 10,000. Hydrography : 352.9 square miles of area covered, 3,277.6 miles run while sounding, 59,841 soundings made, 14 tidal stations established, 4 current stations occupied, 7 hydrographic sheets finished, scales 1: 20,000, 1 : 40,000, and 1: 80,000.

On July 1, 1918, the steamer Pathfinder was at Puerto Princesa, Palawan. The party was engaged on the expansion net from the Iwahig base. This base line is on level ground in a valley surrounded by high mountains, and to expand from the base to the main scheme triangulation, it was necessary to occupy four mountain peaks, Mount Beaufort, Thumb Peak, Stavely, and Central. Each of these peaks is above 3,000 feet, and 6 to 10 miles inland, making it an arduous task to reach and occupy them. Besides, the observations were hampered by smoky, hazy weather. On account of the poor visibility and, probably, on account of the great difference of elevation between stations, the observations were not as good as in the rest of the main scheme, but were within the requirements of accuracy. While these observations were in progress, the ship and one launch party were engaged on hydrography and topography to the southward of Calver Point. During the early part of August the ship was at Manila for minor repairs and supplies. Upon the return of the ship to the working grounds, work on the hydrography and topography was resumed. Two stations in the main scheme, Calatugas and Albion Head, were reoccupied. On September 15, the ship was called to Manila to certify to repair vouchers. As the ship took coal at the same time, this did not interfere materially with the work, although Mr. Auld was left at a distant triangulation station for 26 days, and had to live on the country most of the time. During October the boilers were cleaned at Puerto Princesa, and at the same time the party was engaged on a special tidal investigation. By October 27 the northeast monsoon was well established in full force. The work was hampered not only by the heavy wind and sea but even more by the haze which always accompanies a strong wind that brings rain. On November 8 the whole ship's complement, officers and men, was taken ill with Spanish influenza. Nothing had been heard of the spread of this disease throughout the world, and it alarmed the party all the tnore for that reason. It proved very serious. Eight of the crew died, and many others did not recover completely for over a month. The director sent the Romblon with an additional medical officer, and the ship had to return to Manila in order to secure hospital accommodations; the crew was in no condition to do any work, but most of the men who were ill requested their discharges, and on December 8 the ship returned to the working grounds with practically a new crew. The results of the season's work were as follows: Triangulation.-The Iwahig base was connected to the main scheme, on the line Thumb Peak-Central. The two values of this line as computed in the field check very closely. Two stations in the main scheme, Calatugas and Albion Head, were reoccupied to observe some angles which had been omitted in the previous season's work. The supplementary scheme of triangulation was extended to Bivouac Point, where it joins the main scheme. This system starts from the main-scheme line Arena-Sombrero and extends northward to the station Prom, which is connected with the main scheme; and it has now been connecterl with the main scheme at the southern end, so that the whole system can be adjusted to flt the main scheme. Topography.-The topography of Puerto Princesa was completed. On this sheet were included all of the town of Puerto Princesa nncl all of the Iwahig Penal Colony. These settlements, together with the numerous streams entering the bay, made so much detail that it took a long time to complete the shPl't, while the difficult country, mostly mangrove swamps, rnnde It nn ar<lnons tnsk.

The topography was extended from Calver Point to Relief Point, where it joins the work of the steamer Romblon at triangulation station Shore, thus completing the topography of the east coast of Palawan. Tagalinog Island was completed on a separate sheet on a scale of 1: 10,000. In order to show the contours from Inagauan to Bivouac Point it was necessary to lay out a 1: 40,000 sheet. as the mountains are well back from the coast, beyond the limits of a 1: 20,000. H11drograph11.-The hydrography of Puerto Princesa was completed, all the intricate area in the northern part o:t' the bay being closely developed. This fine harbor will some day be of much more importance than at present. A good typhoon 1_tnchorage was developed back of Malanao Island, but the reported passage was found so narrow and tortuous as to be impracticable. The large number of shoals off the coast between Aborlan aml Panacan required an unusual amount of close development. A good clear channel, though narrow, as well as an excellent anchorage in northeast weather were developed between Rasa Island and the mainland. The inshore wor~r was carried to Bivouac Point. It was planned to finish the ship work to a line north of Tagalinog Island, but the unusually hazy weather during the southwest monsoon, together with the fact that the northeast monsoon set in earlier than was expected, made it impossible to carry out this plan. An area of about 28 square miles east of Rasa Island remains to be completed; another area of about 8 square miles south of Rasa Island coulrl not be finished; otherwise the hydrography is completed out to the 100-fathom curve to a line south of Bivouac Point. Altnacraig Shoal· was developed, and a I-fathom spot found remarkably close to the position indicated on the chart; but there seems to be much shoal water to the southward which has not been examined. · An area of about 8 square miles near Tagalinog Island was examined, while a party was building a tall hydrographic signal on the island. No sounding tubes were used in this season's work. all soundings being taken either with a hand lead (up to 40 fathoms) or up and down with wire. An automatic tide gauge was kept in continuous operation at Puerto Princesa. Tide staffs were established at Aborlan and Panacan, and reltO. when hydrography was In progress in the vicinity. A special tidal investigation was made of the remarkable !'eiches in Puerto Prlncesa. Ten tide staffs were simultaneously observed, while currents were observed at the entrance. The results are as predicted, the selches are nlmost simultaneous all over the bay, being very slight at the entrance anO. increa~ ing In amplitude toward the head of the bay. Several fine serleR of oscillation>; were recorded. Puerto Princesa was made the headquarters of the ship, although coal wai; obtained. at Manila, a run of 360 miles. The worlr was much appreciated by the people in Palawan. Everyone here Is directly or Indirectly Interested In .shipping, and they have haO. so much difficulty in getting vessels to come here, on account of the unreliability of former charts, that it is natural for them to be interested. But they show an Intelligent appreciation of the enormous amount of work and expense necessary to carry- ont the work, and they have been most willing to cooperate in any way possible. Information was furnished to the masters of the following vessels: Mindanao, Mid,qet, Po8eidon, Pilar, Alphonso, Palawan, and Oapt. Ooppens, besides the provincial authorities and various shippers. On January 1, 1919, the steamer Pathfinder was en1mged on the survey of the east const of Palawan in the vicinity of Rasa Island. Although the northeast monsoon ls usually very stron!!' at this time, a typhoon which passed. to the northward. in the latter part of December caused a cessation of the strong northenst winds: tnkln!! advantage of this spell of good weather, it was possible. to fill in all the gaps in the work, and leave it with no "splits." The ship :md one launch party were kept In operation up to January 17. On the followln!? day the northeast monsoon set in strong again, and worlr could not he continued. so the ship returned to Manila for repairs, after taking some coal and. cllsmantling the tide J?auge at Puerto Prlncesa. As n reemlt of this month's work, nil the hvdrography was completed out to the 100-fnthorn <'urve eai;;t 01' Jongitnne 117° 5!l' anO. north 01' latitude 9° 00'. The inshore hvdro1n·nnhy was extended. n few miles to the westward of this line. Current obl"ervntlnns were taken while the ship wns anchored on some of the offshore reefs.

pears that the current is much stronger near the 100-fathom curve, which -here follows the edge of a shelf, than farther inshore . . The ship arrived at Manila on January 24. The boilers were cleaned, an<l then the vessel proceeded to Olongapo for repairs. Instructions from the office required competitive bids, so the vessel returned to Manila. The bids were opened. on February 24, and the results wirelessed to Washington; owing to an unfortunate delay in the transmission of the messages, no answer was received until March 8. As soon as authority had been received, the vessel proceeded to Olongapo, arriving on Marcli 10. Work on the repairs was im· mediately begun, and on March 11 the vessel was docked. On March 15 the command of the vessel was temporarily transferred to Robert J. Auld, jr.
[E. R. HAND, Commanding Steamer Pathfinder, Apr. 16 to June 30, 1919.]

SUMMARY OF RESULTs.-Magnet!c work: Ship completely swung at 2 sea stations. Hydrography: 121 661 square miles of area covered, 3,724 miles run while sounding, 9!l positions determmed (double angles), 165 positions determined astronomicallyA 73;>, soundings made, 1 · hydrographic sheet finished, scale of hydrographic sheets 1 : 2u0,000 and 1 : 400,000. ·

On March 29 when the command of' the Pathfi,nder was transferred, the vessel was undergoing repairs at the Olongapo Naval Station. The vessel left the station with some items of repairs uncompleted, and arrived in Manila April 1. After making the necessary preparations the vessel left Manila April 11 under instructions for deep-sea hydrographic work in the Sulu Sea. The vessel arrived at Puerto Princesa, Palawan, on April 14, and on the morning of April 16 started east on the initial line of soundings. The instructions called for deep-sea sounding exclusively, and in the Sulu Sea. The work was to be shown on two sheets. Sheet No. 1 covered a triangular area just outside Puerto Princesa. Sheet 2 (starting immediately below No. 1) provided for the development of an east and west strip over 200 miles in length between pai·allels 9° and 9° 32' extending from the known soundings at the Palawan coast on the west to the limits of old work along the Negros sh,ore on the east. The requirements of these orders were in substance as follows: Lines should be run east and west, with a spacing and sounding interval not to exceed 5 miles. A line once started to be carried without interruption to its conclusion, a requirement obviously necessitating day and night running. Careful and consistent watch for new dangers. Ends of lines to be tied to shore fixes, and offshore positions plotted by that astronomical method giving the utmost accuracy considering the time, conditions, and bodies available, or in lieu of better mearni, by dead reckoning strengthened by careful attention to correct compass deviations, well rated log, engine turns and time, wind and current velocities nnd directions; special attentfon, by means of split lines nnd shortened sounding intervals, to that ridge which appears to tren<t northeast and southwest tlll'ough the center of the Sulu Sea. Careful record to be kept of all navigational wor'k, and astronomical computations to be submitted with the sheets at the end of the season. The orders outlined in the above paragraph were carried out. Work was continued until ·June 20, when the vessel ·returned to Manila for the completion of repairs. A careful search was made 'for Rubi Reef reported in 1902. An area of 600 square miles was covered with lines about 2' miles apart, and soundings at tile same interval. The bottom was found to be regular, sloping gently toward a 550-fathom spot over 20 miles to the northward. The soundings in the locality of the reported danger run 700 fathoms .and QYer. It is recommended that Rubi Reef be removed from the chart.

From August 2 to October 9 work was continued off the southeast coast of Palawan, and three trips to Sandukun, British North Borneo, were made for coal. On each of these trips two camp parties were left on the working grounds. Leaving for Manila on October 10, the vessel arrived October 12, and was ready to sail on October 25, on which date the epidemic of Spanish influenza laid up 15 men. Spreading rapidly to all hands, the epidemic held the' party in Manila until November 12, when by transferring some of the crew of the ifi'athomer to the Romblon, it was possible to go to the assistance of the Pathfinder at Puerto Princesa, in accordance with orders. Arriving in Puerto Princesa on November 14, on November 16 five men were transferred from the engineer force of the Romblon to the Pathfinder, to enable the latter vessel to get to Manila. From then until November 25, there were from three to five men sick on the Romblon, and it was not thought advisable to go to the working grounds where the vessel would be very short handed, as well as out of reach of medical assistance should it be needed. On November 26 the ship arrived on the working grounds, and continued work until December 19, maka1g one trip to Sandakan for coal. During this trip to Sandakan one camp party was left in the field. The Romblon sailed for Manila December 20, stopping at Puerto Princesa for coal, and arrived in Manila on December 23. On December 24 the boiler was blown down and general overhauling began. Both the ship and the launch were engaged continuously on hydrography when the weather was favorable, the launch working from camp the greater part of the time. · In spite of every effort bPing made by the party on the ship to complete the southern portion of the work below Brooke Point, the plan failed on account -Of weather conditions. The work was then taken up closer inshore, between Brooke Point and Island Bay. In this locnlity n syst<'m of J ,200 meter Jines was run offshore, outside the launch work, as far as signals could usually be seen. In the deeper water outside this area, lines parallel to thE) <'onst were run, whenever the weather permitted and there was occasion for the ship to run up or down the coast. AftPr the monsoon <'111rnged to northeast. the ship worked outside and near Island Bay, keeping near the anchorage and running as short a distance as possible to and from worlr. On the runs to Sandakan, the ship sounded whenever the weather was at all favorable. This resulted in six lines from the working grounds to Cagayn:n Sulu. along the 100-fathom curve, uncl in three lines from Cagayan Sulu to the locality of Taganak Island. The launch part:y, working from a camp about 15 miles south of Brooke Point, spent about two weel{S developing shoals in that locality. When the monsoo1) changed, inshore work on the exposed coast was discontinued, and the launch wo1·kecl in und off Island Bay. On October 21 and 22 sounding was done inside the breal{water in Manila Harbor by a party from the Rornblon, using a whaleboat and the launch. Two topographic sheets were completed, and a juncture was effected with the work of the party on the Pqth{inder, at triangulation station Shore. The only triangulation done was the determination of the positions of eight new stations, to be miecl for the purpose of control in and to the south of Island Bay, Seven of these stations were built prior to July 1. All observing was done after that date. JJ'rom August 5 to October 5 a staff was rend at Brooke Point from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m., and an automatic gauge was maintained ln Island Bay. From November 26 to December 19, only the gauge in Island Bay was operated. No currents were observed during this period. Even early in August, when this season began, the haze was troublesome. It steadily grew worse, and late in September, there were times when the r::hore coul(J not be distinguished at less than 10 miles. The clouds also gave more trouble than early in the year, the peaks usually being covered except for a very short time at sunrise or sunset. "When the party arrived on the working grounds in November, the northeast monsoon had set in, and the parties worked from Island Bay, where a good anchorage was to he had. Very little work was done by the ship at this time. Even when signals could be seen, and the sea was smooth enough to permit work, the facts stlll remained that, on account of the continual sea and clouded sky, shoal-; could not he seen, anrl bottom was barely visible at 5 to 6 fathoms,

and this in a locality where there are not only many shoals, but where they are very steep-to. On October 12 while approaching Manila, the Romblon was signaled by the steamer Palaivan, which was disabled by engine trouble near San Nicolas Shoal Light. At their request the Rornblon towed the Palaivan to the breakwater at Manila. During the influenza epidemic, November 19 to 21, the Romblon made one trip from Puerto Princesa to Brooke Point, taking medicine and assistance to the natives. This trip was made at the urgent request of the provincial governor at a time when field work was impossible because of the weather. The coal burned on this trip was replaced by the provincial government. From January 1 to May 13 the Rornblon was tied up at Engineer Island, Manila, undergoing repairs. Du.ring this period the ship's crew was engaged in overhauling machinery, scaling, painting, etc. In accordance with instructions dated February 25, 1919, two officers with a launch party from the Rornblon were engaged in· hydrography on Laguna de Bay from March 3 to April 19. · The topography in.this locality was found to be incorrect in places, and from March 18 tG April 9 a third officer with a topographic party from the vessel was assigned to that work. Upon the completion of repairs, on May 13, six months' stores were on board, coal was taken at Cavite, and the vessel sailed for the working grounds under instructions of the Director of Coast Surveys, dated April 29, 1919. The party arrived at Guinayangan, Tayabas Province, on May 15, and work was at once begun. On June 13, it was necessary to leave for coal. Two topographic parties and one hydrographic party were left in the field and the ship sailed for Manila, arriving on June 16. A few minor but essential repairs were made at Engineer Island, and on June 23 the vessel left for Cavite, where coaling was completed June 24. Sailing direct from Cavite on that date, the vessel was delayed by rough weather and a low barometer, and did not reach the working grounds until June 28. The field work had progressed satisfactorily, and leaving two parties in camp, the vessel proceeded on June 29 to Port Pusgo, where she was anchored on June 30, waiting for the barometer to rise. The triangulation in the locality of Laguna de Bay was not done by this party. However, it was used as control for the hydrography executed by the party from this vessel. Referring to the triangulation at the head of Ragay Gulf near the mouth of the Guinayangan River, stations Guinayangan, Garcia, and Nasua were recovered without difficulty, and from the line Guinayangan to Garcia a scheme is being extended up the river. Before any observing was done, intersection stations were built, and these, with the built-up main-scheme stations, have furnished excellent control for hydrography and topography. It was necessary in the river, because of the overhanging mangrove, to build tripods for observing. .This greatly retarded the progress of the work, and, probably on account of the strong current, affected its accuracy somewhat. The hydrography done by the party on Laguna de Bay was very thoroughly covered in the descriptive report accompanying the hydrographic sheets. At Guinayangan, as the sounding barely exter,ids outside the 5-fathom curve, it was all done by launch or whaleboat. The launch was used from the southern limit of the work up to the bar at the river mouth. The depth varies from about 6 fathoms to 10 feet, at low water. The launch was run as slow as possible, and the soundings spaced as closely as could be done with one leadsman. The greater -part of the area, that inside the 5-fathom curve, was covered with 50-meter lines. Outside the 5-fathom curve a few lines 100 meters apart were run, and the soundings were also spread slightly farther apart. From a depth of about 10 feet, northward-that is, on the bar itself-the whaleboat only was used. Fifty-meter lines were run, and soundings talrnn much more closely than would be possible with the launch. Under about 9 feet, a sounding pole was used. From the whaleboat all soundings were read to the lesser half foot. The control for the work consisted of triangulation stations and intersection stations, supplemented by topographic flags. At Laguna de Bay the topography consisted only of revision and adjustment of such shore line as was found to -be very much out by the hydrographic party. The usual topographic methods were used.

At Guinayangan two sheets are partially completed. A 1 : 10,000 scale, which c:overs the area outside the river mouth, is nearly finished, and a 1: 5,000 scale, covering the lower portion of the river, is about half finished. Good control is afforded on both of these sheets by the numerous triangulation stations. On the 1: 5,000 sheet considerable delay is being caused by having to wait for low water. On May 19 installation of the automatic gauge at Guinayangan was completed. There was trouble in getting a satisfactory curve, but this difficulty has probably been overcome by the change in the location of the gauge made on June 2 and 3. On May 16 a tide staff was erected at Alunero. Since then readings were taken from 7 a. rn. to 5 p. rn. six days a week.
[S. D. WINSHIP, Commanding Steamer Fathomer.] SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-'.I.'rlangulatlon: 8 stations in supplemental schemes occupied for horizontal measures, 8 geographic positions determined. Magnetic work : Ship completely swung at one sea station. Topography: 0.2 square mlle of area surveyed, 6 mlles of general coast line surveyed, scale of topographic sheets 1 : 20,000. Hydrography : 1,131.3 square mlles of area covered, 19,765 miles run while sounding, 21,169 soundings made, 3 hydrographic sheets finished, scales 1 : 20,000, 1 : 40,000, and 1 : 80,000.

Work in the Cuyo group, on which this party was engaged at the end of the previous fiscal year, was continued until July 12, when orders were received to return to Manila for repairs. While the party was in Manila, some little work was done around the mouth of the Pasig River and inside the breakwater, under special instructions from the Director. At the request of the commandant of the navy yard at Cavite an 'officer was detailed to determine the angles of visibility of Sangly Point Light. During the latter part of July the majority of the crew was taken with Trancazo, or Spanish influenza. On one occasion for several days only two men could be mustered on deck. Fortunately no fatalities occurred. Before returning to the work in Cuyo West Pass, five days were spent in the vicinity of !log Anchorage, north coast of Mindoro, looking for two reported shoals, neither of which was found. September 11 found the party again in Cuyo West Pass. On account of poor seeing conditions it was impossible to complete the triangulation connecting the Dalanganem Islands to the main scheme, though constant effort was directed toward it. The months of May and June are the best suited for triangulation in that locality. Sufficient points were determined, however, to carry on the hydrography indefinitely. After coaling once in Iloilo, shortage of funds made it necessary to coal in Borneo. On two trips to Sandakan, British North Borneo, two sounding lines were run as far as North Tubbataha Reef. On October 25, while returning from Sandakan, the Fathomer grounded on North Tubbataba Reef, under conditions described in a special report. It was an uncomfortable expP.rience for all hands, though they were favored with the best of good fortune in getting off without aid and returning to Manila under their own steam. The Fathomer is the third of three vessels to pile up on Black Rock in the par:it three years and the only one to get off without help. On arrival in Manila on November 1 it was found that all shipyards were so busy that no repairs could be undertaken on the Fath<Ymer until January. As it did not seem advisable to work the ship during heavy weather of the northeast monsoon until the condition of the hull was known, the ship was tied up to await repairs. In the meantime the crew was retained and the entire ship, both inside and out, was given a thorough overhauling, which was badly needed. While in the field the party had no headquarters. A tide staff was maintained at Araceli, Palawan, a party camped most of the time in the Dalanganem Islands, mail came to Cuyo, and the ship anchored on the nearest shoal or drifted if no anchorage was handy. From January 1 to April 15 the Fathomer laid at Engineers Island, Manila, undergoing repairs. During this period she received a thorough overhauling, supervised almost continually by two officers. The other officers, while not engaged in some special assignment, applied themselves to the field records of the preceding period. · During February a reconnolssance was made of Laguna de Bay, and preparations made fo start a survey early in March. The Laguna de Bay party started March 1, in charge of an officer who was attac;!he<l on that date for that purpose. .He had with ·him another officer and a crew of seven men from this vessel, using the ship's launch and cutter. This

party executed hydrography on a 1 : 40,000 sheet, until April 10, when the party was recalled, as the ship was leaving for the south. On April 15 the ship left for the working grounds. The assignment consisted of hydrography, topography, and triangulation. The unfinished triangulation and topography of the Dalanganern Islands had to be done, as well as a complete survey made of the Cagayan Islands. The triangulation of the Dalanganems was completed, except one long line which has baffled all attempts. The topography was soon completed, however, and a party placed on the Cagayan Islands to reconnoiter, lay out a triangulation scheme, and do the observing. At the close of June this was about two-thirds finished. The principal work is the hydrography. It consists of a 1: 20,000 sheet of the Dalanganem Islands, a 1: 80,000 sheet of Cuyo West Pass, on which the party has been working for a year, and a 1 : 200,000 of the northern part of the Sulu Sea, extending, roughly, from Piedra Blanca south to the Cagayan Islands, west to Rubi Reef, north to Dumaran Island, and east to Piedra Blanca, besides the two small sheets of the Cagayan Islands, which have not been touched. The 1 : 80,000 sheet was worked on whenever possible, the distance run for coal cutting the available time to from 8 to 12 days per month. On those days, however, the ship almost invariably worked 12 hours a day, with two watches, thus taking advantage of all the daylight hours. The 1: 200,000 sheet is all deep water, from 600 to 900 fathoms, with about ·25 soundings of greater depth in the southeastern portion. \Vhen going for coal, a line was run both going and coming, fixing each end to shore objects and controlling the rest by astronomical observations. In addition there are two· sheets covering the Cagayan waters themselves. One, 1: 20,000, takes in the intimate waters of the group, the other, 1: 40,000, takes the reefs and shoals to the northeastward. No work has been done on these sheets. During the entire period a tide gauge was maintained at Araceli, Dumaran Island, Palawan. Mail was received at Cuyo, and coal at Sandalrnn, British North Borneo. · After June 3 a camp party, consisting of one officer and five men, was maintained on the Cagayan Islands, occupied in reconnoissance and triangulation. On June 29 the ship returned to Manila, under orders from the Director, leaving a party in the field. On the following day accounts were closed, inventories were signed, and the command turned over to another officer under ·orders from the superintendent.
SPECIAL DUTY · ·INSPECTION 01' AERONAUTICAL EXHIBITS A1' MADISON SQUARE GAUDEN, NEW YORK, N. Y.

[E. G.

FISCHER.]

. On March 13 an inspection was made of the aeronautical exhibits at Madison Square Garden and the Sixty-ninth Regiment Armory, New York, with a view to gaining such knowledge of recent developments in ;;uch scientific instruments and apparatus as might be advantageously used in the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The exhibit illustrating the latest advances in aerial surveying was also examined. The part of the exhibit most directly relating to the work in which the Coast and Geodetic Survey is engaged, that of photogr::i.phic surveying from the air, was highly interesting, and particularly .so on account of the very short space ·Of time in which a plan of an extended area can be photographed, enlarged, and assembled iuto a complete whole. It is claimed that trained men can obtain the photographs for mapping an area of 30 square miles in one hour's flight. A map of the route from Fort Sill to Wichita Falls was made from 4,200 exposures obtained in 60 flying hours, by students in training. But, as the topographer on the ground, having before him the altitudes of the points he establishes almost in their linear extent, but being obliged to shift his station frequently to observe and establish horizontal distances, the aerial topographer, inversely, at once obtains all the latter, but only limited information as to the heights of the points established. Information was obtained in regard to available maps produced by this method, and also in regard to a new aluminum alloy !mown as " acieral," of which samples were obtained for testing with a view to possible use in the ~onstruction of instruments.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.-Topography: 2 acres of urea surveyed, 1 topographic sheet finished, scale 1 inch to 20 feet.

In October, at the request of. the Supervising Architect of the Treasury Department, elevations were determined at 20-foot intervals of the grounds in the rear of the Hygienic Laboratory, Washington, D. C. This plot had heen surveyed originally by George D. Cowie in 1912, but several changes that had been made in the grades necessitated a resurvey before plans for a contemplated new building could be drawn. The results of the survey were plotted on a sheet on scale of 1 inch to 20 fept and furnished to the office of the Supervising Architect. Two assistants to act as recorder and rodman were furnished by the Supervising Architect's office and the work was done without expense to the· Survey.
[F. B. T. SIJiJMS.]

In conformity with· a 1equest from the Navy Department, a trial course 1 nautical mile in length was established for the use of the naval air station at Anacostla, D. C. · The Nnvy Department furnlsh~d the boats, men, and material necessar~· for this work and liel<l work wm; in progress on A11ril 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10, 1910. The method of establishing the cour1:1e consisted of selecting a point A, on the United States naval magazine wharf, Bellevue, readily located by triangulation, and to· serve as a point on the southern range of the trial course. A suitable course for hydroplane!!! was laid off on hydrographic sheet; scale 1 :10,000, along the east edge of main channel 1 mile north of A; allowing also for a safe depth of water for the approaching and leaving course. This course was found to be 14° N. 19' JD. A point distant 1 nautical mile northwest from A, along the azimuth line 14° N. 14' E., was plittted on topographic sheet, scale 1: 4,800, and the point C, on the ground corresponding to the plntted position, was selected by identifying certain topographic features in ·the locality. A and C, however, were found not to be intervisible; it was impossible to find two such points 1 mile apart located on this shore. · The two points, A and C, were located by triangulation-the azimuth from' A to C was fo,und to be 14° N. 20' 50" S., and the distance between them 1,928.27 ·meters, exceeding 1 nautical mile. ( 1,853.25 meters) by 75.02 meters. It is seen that azimuth A to C ilil practically the same as that of the course itself, and for the sake of simplifying the computations the azimuth N. 14° 20' 50'' was adopted. The azimuths of the ranges, therefore, would be 104 ° N. 20' 50'' E. . 'It remained now to locate a point B on the northern range distant 1 mile from A, or 75.02 meters fro·m C, if measured in a direction toward A. It was necessary, however, to measure a distance along edge of bluff on a line 18° 30' to the left of the direction C to A, or 79.11 meters, establishing the point B on the north range. (The measurement 79.11 metei:s wns made along series of level stakes about 15 to 19 meters apart.) Suitable signals were then built to marl{ tile north range, one of them being built adjacent to the stub marking B, the other about 40 meters inshore and on the azimuth line 104° N. 20' 50" E. through B, obtained by observing angle at :B between distant triangulation and inshore range signal. (The azimuth to the triangulation station having been computed.) Two. signals marldng the south range were built on the azimuth line 104 ° 20' 50'' through A, the front range being placed on the face of the wharf, about 1 foot away from A and the other range was· built on shore near the wharf and about 80 meters from A. It was· found impracticable to locate the rear ranges by triangulation, as they were not visible from more than one triangulation station. The ends of the course were marked by buoys. In order to place a buoy on the course, the angle between range and a certain identified object was taken from the topographic sheet ; the desired spot was then obtained by getting on ·range while ·sighting the given angle between range and object with a sextant. · It was understood that the buoys and moorings are to be replaced later by larger gear by the naval air station, and in order to relocate them, cross ranges were noted for the north-end buoy and the south-end buoy.

[E. D. BROMLEY.]

Work was undertaken at the request of the War Department for the purpose of determining by triangulation the geographic positions of certain range towers for the Aberdeen Proving Ground from Mulberry Point to Love Point, Kent Island, upper Chesapeake Bay. In March and April, 1918, several towers had been located by John A. Daniels as far south as Worton Point. These. were found inadequate in number and range for the large guns . to be tested at the grounds, and the scheme was therefore extended south to Love Point, Kent Island. First a scheme of towers was selected using both sides of the bay; This scheme was laid out, the necessary clearing done, and signals built. After thi:> observations had been completed, it was decided by the proving-ground officials that. the towers on the western shore were dangerous, being in line of fire at certain ranges. It was then decided to place extra towers on the eastern shore and eliminate all proposed locations on the western shore. With this new scheme in view, all the stations had to be reoccupied and a new list of directions made for each station, including the new ones. The towers were located back from the shore, usually about 100 meters, and in some cases 400 meters, which necessitated a great amount of clearing for observations of range firing and for measuring the angles of the triangulation. · The towers themselves could not be used in observing the angles for _the triangulation, as they were only single towers with four legs, having a house at the top 10 feet square. Most of the towers were not built when the observing was done. In some cases the instrument was set on a special tripod built under the range towers and sometimes on Its own tripod set up on the ground over the station mark. The towers are eccentric to the triangulation stations. There were three regular triangulation stations established. There were only four old triangulation stations recovered from Love Point, Kent Island, to Turkey Point Lighthouse, Turkey Point, and it was necessary to make a complete scheme of triangulation for the whole of the upper Chesa· peake Bay. · The Aberdeen Proving Ground furnished recorders and laborers. One recorder and one helper were used in the triangulation party. Fifteen men and a. foreman were engaged in building signals and clearing trees .on the western shore and on Pooles Island. On the eastern shore a detail of 12 soldiers and 1 sergeant were employed cutting trees, marking stations, and building signals. The detail camped along in the different places, and rations were furnished them fro~ the proving grounds. Transportation was furnished by the proving-ground' authorities in either boat or automobile. In all there were 42 stations in the scheme, including 7 lighthouses and the 2 range lights on Pooles Island. · The officials of the Aberdeen Proving Ground cooperated in the work in every way possible.

In February a conference was had with the commanding officer of the naval air station at Miami, Fla., for the purpose of ascertaining to what extent the method of topographic surveying by airplane would be useful in the work of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. . The commanding officer of the naval air station was instructed by the Navy Department to cooperate with the party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey at work at Miami, and to render every assistance which would not actually interfere with the military operations Qf that station. The methods used in aerial photography were examined and a report made on the subject.

ects which were executed as one continuous piece of work and both are therefore covered in a single abstract. The work originally requested by the Navy Department was the establishment of permanent shore ranges for a torpedo firing course in the Potomac Hiver. The firing point was to be defined by ranges intersecting at a point 2,500 yards south of Piney Point Lighthouse. The true bearing of the firing range was 122° from this point (geodetic azimuth 302°). Cross ranges were to be located which would intersect the firing range at 4,000-yard intervals from the firing point up to 20,000 yards. The cross ranges were to intersect the firing range at an angle of approximately 90°, the shore points were to be permanently marked, and they were to be far enough apart to make a "sensitive " range; that is, so that the range marks would open considerably for a slight variation from the exact intersection. To this was added the revision of triangulation from Piney Point Lighthouse to Blackistone Island, so as to furnish geographic positions, lengths, and azimuths for the firing range from the lower proving grounds. A number of supplementary points were added to the main scheme, in order to have a sufficient number of observing stations convenient to any part of the river. Instructions for the field work were issued under date of March 28, and on that day a reconnoissance trip was made to Millers Wharf, Md. At a conference with Capt. Miller It was arranged that a submarine chaser was to be detailed by the Navy and a working party and equipment were to be supplied. while the Survey was to furnish the instruments and any additional labor and materials that might be necessary. The chaser was to be available April 21. On April l9 the chief of party left for the field. A rooin for the storage of instruments and for computing was obtained on April 21, and on the 22d thP. submarine chaser arrived with the working party and equipment. It was found that most of the old-scheme stations of the triangulation had been lost. It was therefore necessary to lay out a new scheme of simple quadrangles with sufficient points to determine the range stations by intersection. The reconnoissance and signal building were done at the same time, as it was found that the original figures could be followed in a general way. Most of the observing was done by the chief of party, using the 7-inch Berger theodolite No. 194. Six stations were occupied by Lieut. Simpson Earle. The accuracy of the work as indicated by the triangle closures is very satisfactory. Valuable assistance was rendered by Lieut. Earle and by the Navy in furnishing a submarine chaser, working party, equipment, and signal-building material. Lieut. Earle assisted In building the signals and marking stations in the lower reach of the river, and did all of this work in the upper reach from Piney Point to Blackistone Island. He also did a considerable amount of observing and assisted in every way possible to keep the work going smoothly.
