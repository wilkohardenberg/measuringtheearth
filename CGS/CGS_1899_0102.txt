INTRODUCTION.
The present volume is the Sixty-Eighth Annual Report issued by this Bureau. The subject-matter is treated in two parts, the first pertaining to the office work, and the second describing the field operations. The office work is considered under four heads-Administration, Technical divisions, Publication, and Weights and Measures. The field work is described under Land operations and Sea operations. During the latter part of the fiscal year 1899, by authority of the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury, a reorganization of the principal duties in the office and field was made. The position of Assistant Superintendent was created, to be filled by an officer charged with the executive details of the Survey, and who should act for the Superintendent in his absence. Next in authority to the Assistant Superintendent is the Assistant in Charge of Office, who directs the general routine of the technical divisions of the Office. All the operations in the field were classified into three grand divisions-( 1) Hydrography and Topography, (2) Geodesy, and (3) Magnetism. Inspectors, charged with the supervision of these special lines of work, were appointed. In order that the duties of the hydrographic force of the Survey might be more clearly defined, the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury promulg~ted certain orders as to the particular duties of vessel commanders,. and in connection therewith authority was given to adopt special ensigns which should be used on proper occasions. There are now in use on the Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels the following flags (see frontispiece) : · The national ensz"gn. Flag of the Secretary of the Treasury.-A white ground, with seal of the Treasury Department, of blue, in the center. Flag of the Supen"ntendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. -A red triangle, apex forward, in a blue field. United States Coast and Geodetic Survey flag (service jlag).-A red triangle, base down, in a white circle, on a blue field. United States Coast and Geodetic Survey pennants.-A union of red triangles, base down (13 for the larger and 7 for the smaller size), on a white ·field one-fourth the length of the pennant, the remaining three-fourths of its length to be blue. GENERAL ADMINISTRATION. This subject may be logically described under two heads-( 1) that pertaining to duties, and (2) personnel. . Duties.-As before mentioned, the reorganization of the Survey involved the establishment of five distinct positions relating to the office and field work.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

The Assistant Superintendent has charge of the details of instructions to field parties, prepares the allotments for approval by the Superintendent, and has general supervision of the field work in its larger details. The Assistant in Charge of the Office has under his immediate direction the technical divisions. They are occupied with the computation and arrangement, for public use, of the results as they come from the field. This staff answers calls for information, whether they proceed from outside parties or from the officers of the Survey, requiring data for the prosecution of their immediate operations. The charge of the general property is also in the hands of the Assistant in Charge, as well as the inventories of the instrume!1ts belonging to the Survey. The Inspector of Hydrography and Topography has general supervision of the field parties in this particular line. He inspects, from time to time, the actual operations, prepares detailed instructions for the further prosecution of the work, and has immediate direction of the maintenance and repairs of the vessels. The Inspector of Geodesy supervises the details of field geodesy, and is at the same time Chief of the Computing Division, where the results of geodetic field measures are worked up and put in proper form for publication. He inspects, from time to time, the actual field work, visiting for this purpose the parties in different sections of the country in order to see and criticise, through actual contact, the methods that are employed in the routine of field work. The Inspector of Magnetic Work has charge of the field operations in this branch of investigation, and directs the computations incident thereto. He inspects, from time to time, the different parties in the field, has charge· of th.e magnetic observatories, and submits detailed plans for the prosecution of the work to the Superintendent for his approval. Personnel.-The total number of persons employed in the Office, for which provision was made in the sundry civil bill approved July 1, 1898, was as follows:

The above statement does not include $roo ooo, deficiency act of January 28, 1898, surveys of Yukon and Copper rivers, and $5 ooo, deficiency act of July 7, 1898, publishing charts, portions of which appropriations were expended during the fiscal year 1898-99. THE WORK OF THE YEAR. The general results of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the fiscal year may be summarized under three heads:__Field operations, Office computations, and Publication of results. Field operations.-Surveying was carried on throughout the year in widely distributed localities, including Alaska. Work was continued on the ninety-eighth meridian, in Texas, Indian Territory, and Nebraska. Part of this was reconnoissance, but much was finished triangulation. Some lines of levels were also run in connection with this work. As noted in previous reports, these operations will serve as a basis for all the surveys of the Mississippi Valley, and will, besides, c()ntribute to our knowledge of the size and shape of the earth. The immediate and greatest use of the work will no doubt be found in the aid it furnishes in the establishment of land surveys of higl! precision in the Central United States, but the information given by an arc of the magnitude here proposed is most valuable on the general subject of geodesy, and its measurement will be appreciated both by the governmental surveys of Europe and those of our own conntry. · S.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 189B-9_9.

The international latitude work, the supervision of which, by authority of the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury, was undertaken by the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has been carried on to the extent of acquiring land and making preliminary arrangements. This work, of great value both from an astronomical and a geodetic standpoint, will be carried out at six stations distributed around the earth near the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude, under the general direction of the International Geodetic Association, with Central Bureau at Potsdam, Germany. The Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for the next fiscal year will contain a description of the instruments used in this work, the methods of observation, and the results expected from its prosecution. The California-Nevada boundary, which has been in hand for a number of years, but which was interrupted several times on account. of lack of appropriations, was completed during the fiscal year just closed. A line 400 miles long, running from Lake Tahoe, on the thirty-ninth parallel, in a southeasterly direction to the Colorado River, has been established and temporarily marked. Not enough funds were available to mark the stations permanently, but it is believed, in view of the great advantages derived by the States of California and Nevada from a permanent location of the line by a disinterested service, and by officers skilled in this special kind of work, that the funds will be forthcoming from the State treasuries to permanently fix the geodetic points established by the survey. General operations were continued on the Atlantic coast, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Marthas Vineyard, Massachusetts; Chesapeake Bay, and in Florida. On the Gulf, at Aransas Pass and Lake Maurepas. On the Pacific, at Crays Harbor, San Diego, San Pedro, and San Francisco. Topography has been executed along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in Alaska; in the latter locality, notably at the mouth of the Yukon and the Copper rivers. Extensive hydrographic and topographic operations have been carried on to determine the best route for ocean steamers entering the delta of the· Yukon. The other gateways to the Klondike region have also received attention, and the mouth of the Copper River has been fully explored. 'rhe passes at the head of Lynn Canal and the adjoining region have been carefully mapped. More than 30 ooo people in one year used this route to the gold regions, thus demonstrating the necessity of an accurate map. The town of Skagway increased from three buildings in August, 1897, to 700 in January, 1898, at which time the population numbered 3 ooo. The transcontinental line of precise leveling has been carried forward toward the summit of the Rocky Mountains, and will be pushed forward to the Pacific coast as fast as means are available. Magnetic elements have be~n determined in many localities, and a careful study of the secular variation, of extreme interest to laud surveyors, has been made in a number of places. Meridian lines, by means of which compasses may be tested, and standards of length for the purpose of verifying surveyors, chains, have been laid out at many county court-houses. The determination of the force of gravity, although not prosecuted continuously during the year, has received some valuable additions through the execution of this work at individual stations. In connection with the regular work of the Survey, special duty has been performed in connection with the Mississippi River Commission, the establishment of chart agencies, hydrography on the Brunswick Bar, and during the year the Coast and

INTRODUCTION.

Geodetic Survey steamer Path.finder, began its voyage from Washington to San Francisco. A full and more detailed account of this voyage, which was eminently successful in all respects, will appear in the next annual report. The hydrographic work during the year was carried on on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and at the mouths of the two greatest rivers in Alaska, the Yukon and the Copper. In both these localities valuable information was acquired bearing on the best way of entering the country, and finally arriving at the gold fields of the Klondike. 'fhe work on the Brunswick Outer Bar, Georgia, already cited, was done by an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, under the personal supervision of the Secretary of War. This survey was made with extreme care, since large interests both to the Government and to the contractor were involved. The establishment of compass ranges on the coast of California, for the use of vessels, was an important piece of hydrographic work. Tidal observations were carried on wherever the hydrographic operations demanded it, and permanent gauges established at different parts of the United States and in Hawaii have furnished valuable data for the prediction of tidal phenomena. Field operations were begun during the year in Porto Rico, and work was taken up at Ponce, on the south coast, and at San Juan, on the north. The data secured will tend to materially improve the existing charts covering the region surveyed. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has been represented during the year at a magnetic conference held in England, at the meeting of the International Geodetic Association, in Germany, and at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in this country. At all these places the delegates accredited from our service presented papers and took part in the discussions. Matters of interest and value in our line of work came up for action, and the presence of officers who were specialists in the subjects under discussion was condu~ive to mutual benefit. Office computations.-The office work has been carried on as rapidly as possible, and the material furnished by the field parties has been put in shape and prepared for the use of the Survey and for the public. Numerous additions and supplements to the Coast Pilot have been prepared, predictions for the Tide Tables have been made, many charts have been corrected, and geodetic computations made. The complete determination of the distance across the United States by a chain of triangles on the thirty-ninth parallel, has been effected. This great work, in hand for a quarter of a century, is now done, the computations are made, and a volume descriptive of it in all its phases is at the present time running through the press. · The combination of this arc with that of the ninety-eighth meridian, in the Mississippi Valley, will form the backbdne of a network which will subsequently cover the country and give to each State in the Union accurate geograptiical positions. Publication of results.-Matter has been prepared for publication in the Annual Report of the Superintendent, in the Bulletins, Coast Pilot, Notices to Mariners, Tide Tables, and Special Publications. Besides these, which may be classified as textual publications, numerous charts have been published. The Annual Report, besides giving a general account of the work of the Survey, contains in the appendices certain details that more fully illustrate the character of the operations. Special technical papers also appear as appendices, and these are issued separately and distributed to the public on request.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR \'EV REPORT, 1898-99.

The Bulletins, which are intended to give early announcement of results, are issued as occasion demands. During the year elapsed se,·eral important ones have appeared, containing hydrographic notes and sailing directions in Alaskan waters. The Coast Pilot is revised and kept up to date. Five supplements to the Atlantic and Gulf Coast volumes have been issued during the year. The Notices to Mariners appear n~onthly, and give new information affecting the accuracy of the charts. The Tide Tables contain data from which predictions can be made for about 3 ooo home and foreign ports. 'fhe publication is of great value to the maritime interests, and is highly appreciated by the public. Special publications are issued from time to time, as material for them accumulates. They bear consecutive numbers, and contain collated or original information of value and interest to the public. It is proposed to publish in the near future an atlas of the Philippine Islands, embodying more than 30 colored charts of the different parts of the group. Of the total number of charts (83 197) issued during the year, about one-fifth (16 240) were furnished to the Hydrographic Office of the Navy Department, 34 210 were delivered to the sales agents, and 15 386 found their way to. the Executive Departments of the Government. There were 19 new charts published, mostly by photolithography. HENRY S. PRITCHETT,

PLAN OF OPERATIONS.

a.

General statement.

The plan of operations proposed at the beginning of the fiscal year has been executed as faithfully as circumstances permitted. On account of the great changes taking place on some parts of the shore, and also the long time elapsed since some of the surveys were made, it has been necessary to devote a large portion of the resources of the Bureau to resurveys. Coast and interior work have been carried bn simultaneously. The Alaskan operations were prosecuted energetically during the short season available, and the results of the work in that locality have been of great importance. The land area around the mouth of the Yukon extends at least 25 miles west of the point given by the best maps existing up to the time of the recent surveys; the mouth of the Copper River has been carefully surveyed, which operation, however, was entirely a new piece of work. Hydrographic surveys and Coast Pilot investigations were kept up to date as closely as the means at disposal would permit.
b.

Resurveys.

Prominent among the resurveys made during the year are those at Chesapeake Bay; Hudson River; Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire; and San Francisco, Cal. No work had been done on the upper part of Chesapeake Bay for nearly fifty years, and the changes taking place fully warranted a resurvey, even though the commercial improvements had not called for it. Both the topography and hydrography of the Hudson River from Spuyten Duyvil to Ardsley were executed again, on account' of great changes which had taken place. Especially does the topographic .sheet show great developments in the line of wharves and buildings. Portsmouth Harbor has had both.a topographical and hydrographical survey, which was badly needed on account of the length of time elapsed since the previous work was done. The rapid development of San Francisco in the last half century has made it necessary to go over the work there, some of which was done fifty years ago. · S. Doc. 454--3 33

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898-99.
c. J\Tezo work.

The principal operations under the head of new work are: first, the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian; second, the topographic and hydrographic survey of Lake Maurepas, Louisiana; third, the primary triangulation in southern California, and, fourth, the Alaska work at the mouth of the Yukon and Copper rivers. All these pieces of work seem to be equally important, and parties were engaged upon them to as great an extent as they were available. The ninety-eighth meridian work will furnish data for the foundation of the survey of the Mississippi River Valley, and will also aid materially in determining the earth's size and shape. The survey of Lake Maurepas was called for in order to complete the sheet containing the Lake Pontchartrain work, which had just been finished, and in view of the commercial importance of the place. It has always been desirable since the inception of the Coast and Geodetic Survey work on the Pacific coast to develop a scheme of triangulation from Puget Sound, on the north, to the Mexican boundary, on the south. The work from San Francisco southward was done many years ago, and after a number of interruptions it was determined to push this work on to the southern limit of our domaiu, and thus lay the foundation for correct topographic and hydrographic surveys along the coast. This work was completed during the last fiscal year by an extension of the triangulation from Santa Cruz Island to the monument marking the boundary between Mexico and the United States. The work in Alaska has been carried on by large and well-equipped parties. Assistant Pratt, operating at the mouth of the Yukon River, has almost completed the work from St. Michael to the lower entrance of the Yukon, including a survey of the Kwikpak and. Kwiklok, to the head of the passes, besides making hydrographic examinations for a considerable distance off shore. The work of Assistant Ritter at the mouth of the Copper River consisted in the establishment, astronomically, of the town of Orea and several points farther inland, and the execution of a triangulation covering the entire mouth of the river and determining the important mountain peaks as far as seen. The importance of an exhaustive magnetic map of the United States has made it necessary to establish a new division of the Bureau for the purpose of carrying on this work. This was done at the close of the fiscal year just past, and the operations in this line will now be carried on systematically and rapidly. One of the most important duties of the Survey, at this time, is to increase our knowledge of the island of Porto Rico. The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Blake proceeded thither in the month of January, 1899, and remained about five mouths on the southern shore, making both topographic and hydrographic surveys of important points, notably Ponce. San Juan, on the northern shore, was also visited, and a hydro· graphic survey of the harbor made.
2.

ORGANIZATION OF PARTIES.

a. Land.

The orga.Jization of the land parties has been practically the same as during previous years, except that the greater number of parties placed in the field, and the fewer available officers, necessitated the assumption by younger men of greater responsibility. The withdrawal from shore to sea duty of a number of assistants has had no appreciable effect, either on the output or character of the work.

I.

ADMINISTRATION.

35

b. Sea.

During the previous fiscal year 44 naval officers had been attached to the Coast and Geodetic Survey service. At the beginning of hostilities with Spain, or shortly thereafter, all these were detached, which depleted the list of available hydrographic officers for the time being. The effect of this movement was to bring out the latent forces of the personnel, and to demonstrate the elasticity of our resources. No great discontinuity it~ the hydrographic operations of the Survey occurred on account of the detachment of the naval officers, and at the present time both topographic and hydrographic demands are fully met. The requirements of the situation are adequately discharged, notwithstanding the sudden change in the complexion of the hydrographic parties.
3. ISSUE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

a. Geo.f!raphical distribution.

During the entire year instructions were issued for the execution of field work to 96 parties. These were distributed, geographically, as follows: 36 in the Eastern Division of the United States; 9 in the Middle Division; r9 in the Western; and 8 in Alaska. Twenty-four parties were assigned to special duty in all parts of the United States, including Porto Rico, and also including representative duty in England and on the Conti11ent of Europe.
b. Character of work.

The instructions issued during the year may be classified, as regards the character of work' proposed, into twelve heads. Twelve parties were engaged in the execution of hydrography; r 2 in the establishment and maintenance of tide gauges; 7 on topography; 7 on magnetism; 5 on precise leveling; 4 on reconnoissance; 3 on triangulatioa; 3 on astronomical determinations; 2 on gravity; and 2 on base lines. Besides these, 15 parties were engaged in combined operations, the prominent part of the work being hydrography, topography, and triangulation; but in some of the parties additional work was carried on, such as reconnoissance, tidal and current observations, precise leveling, astronomical determinations, the measurement of bases, and magnetic observations. The special duty performed is comprised in the instructions to 24 parties, and calls for a great variety of work, prominent among which may be mentioned representative duty; the construction, trial trip, and command of the steamer Patlifi,nder; the operations in Porto Rico; on the California and Nevada boundary; on the Mississippi River Commission, and in the inspection of chart agencies.
4. ALLOTMENT OF FUNDS.

The allotment of funds has been in accordance with what seemed to be a just division between the different sections of the country and the actual necessities of the work, after a careful study of the situation. In many cases economy was better served by devoting, for the time being, a somewhat larger sum to a particular locality than was strictly proportionate, in order that greater relative progress might be made than would othenvise be possible. The largest item in the field expenses for the. year was that of the Pacific coast. Fifty-four thousand four hundred dollars was allotted to this work. The head of the Lynn Canal and passes adjacent thereto were included in this item, but not the Yukon

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18c)8-<)9.

and Copper rivers, for which a separate appropriation, afterwards to be alluded to, was made. Forty-four thousand four hundred dollars was allotted to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. State surveys, including magnetic observations, the establishment of meridian lines, lines of exact levels between the Atlantic and Pacific, required $22 ooo. The California and Nevada State boundary, work on \Vhich had been in progress for several years, was finished during the past year at an expense of about $10 ooo. Offshore hydrographic work, including compilation of the Coast Pilot, required an equal amount, and $5 ooo was devoted to the subject of physical hydrography, including the study of harbors and bars, and tidal and cU?:rent observations. Four thousand dollars was allotted to objects not named above, but which were found urgent in the prosecution of the survey. Three thousand four hundred dollars was paid for the expenses of officers and men of the Navy, on duty and for special service.
B. ACCOUNTING DIVISION.
. I.

DISBURSING SECTION.

The gre~t bulk of the expenditures of this Survey are made by small field parties, in widely separated and often remote localities, distant from mail facilities. Very many of these expenses are for comparatively small sums, requiring many vouchers, but in spite of these conditions, which are not conducive to careful and exact accounts, not a single dollar was suspended or disallowed by the auditing office of the Treasury Department during the year. This is a high tribute to the integrity of the various chiefs of parties who expended the money in the field, and to the painstaking work of the employees in this office, for the scrutiny of the auditing office of the Treasury is exact and rigid. The disbursements during the year show that of the total appropriations for all purposes (about $625 ooo), slightly more than one-third was devoted to salaries, and one-fourth was consumed by party expenses or field work proper. This last amount is independent of the special appropriation of $100 ooo (deficiency act of January 28, 1898) for the Yukon and Copper rivers operations, and which was also available for boat construction, pilotage, transportation, etc. One-sixth of the total amount was utilized in the construction and outfit of a new steamer and in repairs to all vessels. General office expenses, including publication of charts and discussion and publication of observations, required one-twentieth of the sum total. The following table is made up from the Digest of Appropriations for 1899, and . shows the actual amounts allotted to the items named:

MISCELLANEOUS SECTION.

The miscellaneous section of the Accounting Division is charged with the custody and issuance of the annual reports, appendices, bulletins, notice to mariners, tide tables, coast pilots, and special publications. In round numbei:s, it may be stated that I ooo copies of annual reports were distributed during the year, one-half of which were for the fiscal year I 896--97, the last published. There were also distributed I 500 appendices; 3 ooo tide tables; I ooo coast pilots, of which Ioo were for the Pacific coast and Alaska, and 300 miscellaneous publications. Appendices to the report for 1896-97 were received from the Public Printer during the year in numbers varying from 100 to 700, according to the importance of the publications. Supplements to the coast pilot (about 2 ooo copies); bulletins relating to the Alaska coast ( 6 ooo copies), and monthly notices to mariners, containing corrections to charts (about 4 400 each month), have also been received. All manuscript for the Public Printer is 1transmitted through this section. On January l, 1899, the business connected with chart agencies throughout the country was transferred from the miscellaneous section, thereby avoiding some duplication of labor necessary under the old system.
C. OFFICE OF ASSISTANT IN CHARGE.

The office work of many of the technical divisions of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is under the immediate direction of the Assistant in Charge. Through his office pass all letters written hy chiefs of divisions, which, after being read and initialed, are transmitted to the Superintendent for signature. The original topographic and hydrographic sheets come to the Superintendent for approval after such action is recommended by the Assistant in Charge. The information furnished to Coast Survey officers in the field and to outside parties, whether secured in the Computing, Tidal, Drawing and Engraving, Chart, Instrument, or Library and Archiv~s divisions, is first sent to the Assistant in Charge for scrutiny before being given out by the Superintendent. The routine work of the Office, the conduct and efficiency of the personnel, and the general results attained are under the constant supervision of the Assistant in Charge, who is responsible to the Superintendent for the faithful discharge of duties by the employees and the economical expenditures of the resources of the Office.

ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES.

The entire administration of the Hydrographic Division is in charge of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topograghy. In this Office are formulated the detailed instructions for field work, which, after approval by the Superintendent, are issued to the respective parties, and define the scope of their operations for the ensuing season. Tl,ie Coast Pilot party, both in its field and office work, the care of the vessels, their repairs, and the enlistment and discharge of the crews-all come under the supervision of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography,

COAST PILOT PARTY.

a. Supplements.

The operations of .the Coast Pilot party during the past fiscal year were confined exclusively to office work. Six supplements were prepared and published, embodying all changes affecting the Coast Pilot volumes since the date of last publication. These supplements affect the volumes of the Coast Pilot as follows: One for Parts I and II, 1 for Part III, 2 for Part IV, and 1 for Part VIII, and 1 containing the Rules of the Road at Sea.
b. Bulletins.

All the bulletins issued during the year refer to Alaskan waters. No. 37, Hydrographic Notes and Sailing Directions from Dixon Extrance to Yakutat Bay, was derived from information furnished by Lieut. Commander J. F. Moser, U. S. N., commanding the steamer Albatross, of the United States Fish Commission service. Bulletin No. 38, Hydrographic Notes and Sailing Directions, Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet, Kadiak Island, and route Unalaska to Chignik to Unamak Pass, inside the islands, is also from information furnished by Lieutenant-Commander Moser, under the same authority as the previous bulletin. Bulletin No. 39 gives the predicted times of slack water at Seymour Narrows, Discovery Passage, British Columbia, and Sergius Narrows, Peril Strait, Alaska, and was prepared from observations by the party of Commander E. K. Moore, U. S. N., while in command of the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson. This bulletin, although largely compiled during the fiscal year, did not appear until after its close. Bulletin No. 40, Coast Pilot Notes on the Fox Island Passes, Unalaska Bay, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean, as far as Point Barrow, is essentially a compilation, and is made up from all available sources, including naval officers, officers of the ReventteCutter Service, and the work of Assistant J. F. Pratt, Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the vicinity of St. Michael and the mouth of the Yukon River. This bulletin was revised by Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, U. S. R. C. S., his detail for this purpose having been made by the Chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service. Lieutenant Jarvis has had large experience in Alaska and has made the trip to Point Barrow both by land and water. The thanks of this service are due to him for the interest he has evinced in the preparation of the work, and to the Chief of the Revenue-Cutter Service for his assignment to this duty.
B. COMPUTING.
1.

GEODETIC.

a. Triangulation.

One of the principal, as well as the most laborious, duties of the Computing Division is the adjustment of triangulation. After the observations have been made it is necessary to subject the results to methods of computation which will give consistent results for all parts of the work. This is accomplished by applying the method of least squares to the conditions involved. Some extended examples of intricate work in this line have been met with during the past year, and on one occasion, in order to adjust the system of network between the Salina Base and the El Paso Base, it was necessary to solve 99 normal equations.

JI.

TECHNICAL DIVISIONS.

39

This extraordinary number was solved in twenty-four working days. Besides the great adjustmentc;, such as that just mentioned, work has been continued on the traverse line across the neck of Florida, and in the triangulation of that part of the oblique arc which extends from the vicinity of Montgomery, Ala., to the Gulf coast. The adjustment of the reconnoissance triangulation in southeastern Alaska was also carried on.
b. Leveling.

Differences of height are determined both by the spirit level and by the measurement of vertical angles. Both these methods have been carried on during the year, and the Computing Division has been occupied in reducing the observations and determining the final heights. The elevations of the primary stations in eastern Colorado, thence across the Rocky Mountains to California, were adjusted; and abstracts were prepared of the vertical measures in California for' the past year. The spirit-level observations between Salina, Kans., and Hugo, Colo., were also computed.
2.

ASTRONOMICAL.

a. Star places.

From the beginning of the fiscal year until August 17, Mr. John F. Hayford was engaged on the revision of star places, and abstracts were prepared of the resulting latitudes of stations on the transcontinental triangulation .
. b. Latitude, /011gitude, and azimut/1.

Abstracts of latitudes were prepared by Assistant John F. Hayford from October 5 to February 28, l 899. The telegraphic longitudes of stations Green River and Oasis, in Utah, and the azimuth at Bronson, Fla., were computed by Mr. D. L. Hazard. The chronometric longitudes of 3 stations in the delta of the Yukon, in Alaska, were also computed by him.
3. MAGNETIC.

The Magnetic Division of tl:e Coast and Geodetic Survey was not distinc.tly organized until the lSt of June, 1899; so that in this Division during this fiscal year only work of a preliminary nature was undertaken. Requests for information were answered, the outfit for the steamer Patlzfinder was prepared, and the observer accompanying the vessel was instructed in the work of magnetic observations. Previous to June l the magnetic computations were made under the direction of Assistant Schott, and they were carried on regularly, as time was available, during the entire fiscal year. The observations in West Virginia in 1898 were taken up and completed.
4, SPECIAL I::-i'VESTIGA TIONS.

a. Transro11ti11c11tal ai-c.

The work of carrying on the computations on the great transcontinental arc, on the thirty-ninth parallel, has been pursued throughout the year whenever possible by Assistant C. A. Schott. 'fhis work, which is now being printed, will be contained in seven parts: The first treats of the units of length and base lines; the second, hypsometric measures; third, triangulation; fourth, astronomical latitude; fifth, astronomical azimuths; sixth, the astronomical longitudes, and seventh, results. Not only is this arc one of the

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898-99.

longest possible in the United States, but it is the greatest arc ever measured by any nation. It furnishes material for the subsequent surveys across the continent, and also contributes to our knowledge of the size and shape of the earth.
b. Work i1l newly acqufred territory.

Considerable scientific data has been gathered in the Computing Division from islands which have just come under the control of the United States. This material consists of both magnetic and astronomical data.
c. Board on spirit Leveling.

On the 29th of November, 1898 a committee was appointed by the Superintendent to investigate, in its entirety, the question of precise leveling, as carried out in the service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This board consisted of Mr. John F. Hayford, chairman; Isaac Winston, J. J. Gilbert, and A. L. Baldwin. They held sessions daily for two months, ·and their report, submitted on February 9, 1899, contains the results of their deliberations and conclusions. 'fhis report is full of valuable suggestions, which have been recently put in practice in the field and have produced most excellent results. The questions treated were those touching economy and accuracy in the work. Comparisons were made with similar work done by other government organizations, and systematic errors which have, up to the present time, given considerable trouble were thoroughly examined. A number of changes in the program of observagestions were recommended, among which may be mentioned: ( 1) That direct reading rods, graduated to centimetres, be substituted for the present target rods; ( 2) that the readings on each sight shall be simply the readings against the rod, to the nearest millimetre, of the three horizontal lines of the telescope diaphragm; (3) that neither tele-. scope nor striding level shall be reversed during the progress of the leveling operations; (4) that the alterna~e fore sights be taken before the corresponding back sights; (5) that the maximum length of sights shall be 150 metres, that no back sight and the corresponding fore sight shall differ by more than 10 metres. and that the continuous sum of the back sights shall not differ by more than 20 metres from the continuous sum of the fore sights between successive bench marks.

C. T.!DAL.
r. TIDES.

a. Harmonic analysis.

As usual, the Tidal Division of the Office has been' engaged regularly on the preparation of the Tide Tables, using the method of harmonic analysis. During this fiscal year those for the year 1900 were prepared. This volume is essentially similar to those of preceding years, with the exception that in the present one the predicted tides for St. Michael, Alaska, have been added. This is the first time such knowledge for this locality has been incorporated in the Tide Tables. The great advantage of the application of harmonic analysis to tides, first made by Sir William Thomson, need not here be pointed out. By the use of the old method results were not sufficiently accurate, the data for an entire year, as then utilized, leading to predictions unreliable to the extent of a considerable fraction of a foot. This

II.

grew out of the fact, principally, that no account was taken of the longitude of the moon's node. By the introduction of harmonic analysis the effects are reduced to what they would be if the sun and moon moved in the equator and in circular orbits; while at the same time all the irregularities arising from the actual inequalities of the motions of these bodies are taken account of. A general agreement is now established between the predicted and 'observed tides at the many places published in the tables.
b. Chesapeake Bay.

A successful attempt to fix a permanent tidal plane for the Chesapeake Bay has also been made. During the past year nearly 40 st,ations were occupied, at I 3 of which we are in possession of simultaneous tidal observations extending over one complete lunation. The application of harmonic analysis to this unique series along our seaboard will open the way for correct predictions from the Capes to Havre de Grace, and will also result in the establishment, for the whole bay, of a plane of reference of unequaled permanence and undoubted accuracy. The tide is usually small in Chesapeake Bay, being about 2 ~ feet at the entrance, diminishing to less than 1 foot in the middle, and increasing again to about 2 feet at the head of the bay. The surface is affected very much by winds, which often cause a variation of 3 feet in the level. This diminution in the height of the tides as we go northward from the entrance, and the subsequent increase as we continue on in the sn.me direction, is one of the peculiar features of the tidal phenomena of the bay. The small range at Annapoli~ is due, partly to change in the width of the bay, and partly to the fact that there is an interference at this point between the incoming and outgoing tidal waves. When the crest of the southbound movement reaches the mouth of the Severn River, it meets the north-bound wave from the Capes, and a partial neutralization of the vertical motion of the water takes place.
c. Copper River delta.

The series of tides observed by the party of Assistant Homer P. Ritter in the delta of the Copper River, Alaska, were found to contain a most interesting type of tide, in which the upper portion of the wave is normal and the lower part is very nearly a straight line. In explanation of this peculiar form of tide it may be said that a barrier. of some sort prevents the water from falling below a certain level. It therefore remains dammed up until the rising tide overflows the barrier and again produces the rise and subsequent fall.
d. Yukon River Delta.

No less interesting is the series of tides observed by the party under Assistant J. F. Pratt, on the Yukon River Delta, which shows a rapid transition from an almost strictly diurnal tide at St. Michael, to a well-marked semidiurnal at the Kusilvak entrance to the Yukon.
e. llfanual of Tides.

Part IV of the Manual of Tides, now being prepared by Dr. R. A. Harris, has been continued during the year. This part relates to "Tidal Theory," and considerable progress has been made in the study of the tidal oscillations in the great oceanic basins. So far as this work has progressed it goes to show that the dominating tides of most localities owe their origin to one of two methods of generation. The first is that implied

42

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898-<)<J.

in the corrected equalibrium theory, and pertains to rather small and well-inclosed bodies of water; the second, and far more important method, is that implied in stationary oscillations whose free periods approximately coincide with the periods of the tidal forces. As an example of these oscillating areas may be cited the region lying south of the Maine coast, from Nantucket to the southern end of Nova Scotia. Following a line, somewhat convex toward the south, joining these two points, there appears to be a small tidal disturbance, probably not more than 2 feet, whereas along the entire New England coast, north of Nantucket, the tides are in the neighborhood of from 8 to 10 feet. Moreover, on this nodal line just mentioned, running from Nantucket to Nova Scotia, the currents are well pronounced; so that it appears that we have here an area which oscillates about the nodal line as· an axis, thus producing high water at practica:lly the same time along the New England coast.
2.

CURRENTS.

a. Alaska and Brit£sll Columbia.

Besides the predicted tides for St. Michael, Alaska, spoken of above, there appear in the Tidic Tables for I 900 the times of slack current for each day of the year at Seymour Narrows, in Discovery Passage, British Cqlumbia, and at Sergius Narrows, in Peril Strait, Alaska. This is the first time that the Survey has issued full predictions of the times of slack currents. The observations were furnished by the party of Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore, U. S. N., commanding the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson, and consisted of the times of the beginning and ending of slack waters for about six months.
b. l71esapeake Bay.

The series of current observations made by Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U. S. N., at two stations in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, and one station occupied by Assistant R. L. Faris, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the same vicinity, were subjected to harmonic analysis. These are the first examples of the application of this method of treatment to current observations that the Survey has accomplished. Only four components were obtained, because the velocity of the current at these stations was too slight to warrant a more exhaustive treatment.
D. DRAWING AND ENGRAVING DIVISION.
1.

DRAWING SECTION.

The drawing section of this Division has been engaged, during the past year, in its regular routine work and other duties made incumbent upon it by the increased traffic toward the Yukon, and the war with Spain. Numerous maps were supplied for the war room at the White House, and these were kept up to date as occasion required. Charts were prepared for photolithographing, for the Hawaiian Islands and Porto Rico, in addition to the regular work along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and Alaska. Considerable attention was given to the preparation of work at the Yukon Delta. A map of the Ladrone Islands was also finished, as well as one of the island of Guam. A chart of Alaska was traced, showing the wrecks and casualties in these waters; and a plan of

II.

TECHNICAL DIVISIONS.

43

the royal arsenal at San Juan, P.R., was also copied. A finished wall map of Alaska was ·prepared for the State Department, and plans and specifications for the reconstruction of the attic in the present Survey Office, for the use of the photographic section, were completed. Space will not permit a detailed description of all the drawings completed for photolithographing and engraving. Twenty-two were completed on different scales ranging from 1: 10 ooo to 1: 1 300 ooo. Two of these are on Mercator's projection, the others being on the polyconic. Besides the above mentioned completed drawings, 12 were in progress at the end of the fiscal year. These comprise work on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Pribilof Islands, Alaska, and the island of Guam. Other schemes for new charts have been approved for publication by the Office, but no work has been done upon them. The schemes comprise 26 charts, on scales ranging from 1 :60 ooo to 1: 100 ooo, and distributed about equally over the coasts of the United States. Besides the foregoing work, the usual projections for the use of field parties have been constructed, besides a number of projections on copper plates. Over 200 charts have been revised, corrected, and verified, for new editions or reprints, and, finally, au unusually large number of sketches and drawings have been made to illustrate the annual report of the Superintendent.
2.

ENGRAVING SECTION.

The activity in the engraving section has been marked during the past fiscal year. Thirteen new charts and 28 new editions of charts were finished. A few miscellaneous ones were also taken up and disposed of. Besides this work, which was entirely completed, a great many new charts were commenced 'and are still under way. Eight section maps of the District of Columbia have been completed, each one consisting of 4 plates. These are to be printed in colors, which necessitated an increased number of plates. There were 36 unfinished plates on hand at the close of the fiscal year. The work has been so arranged that those engravers having specialties have been given their particular kind of work, but aside from these a general effort has been made to familiarize each engraver with new kinds of work.
3.
PRINTI~G

SECTION.

The number of impressions actually drawn was slightly over 59 ooo. These came from 1 474 plates. They were distributed principally to the Chart Division, but the Office of the Assistant in Charge, the Engraving Section, and the lithographer each received a number of copies. There were published by lithography, during the year, more than 19 ooo charts, making the total of charts issued by the Division, during the fiscal year, approximately 79 ooo.
4. PHOTOGRAPHING AND ELECTROTYPING SECTION.

The work of both these sections has been continued during the fiscal year on the same general lines as heretofore. Little material is a\·ailable for an account of the work here, except tables of statistics, which will be found in anothe~ part of this report. The work consisted in making negatives, prints, lantern slides, etc. In the electrotyping rooms 2 ooo pounds of copper were deposited on 76 ooo square inches. Forty-two basso and 29 alto plates were finished.

44

CO~ST

AND G,EODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<J9.

The work accomplished in each section of this Division has been entirely satisfactory, and, considering the force employed, the output has been very large. The con- · tinued use of the engraved-plate notes, compasses, etc., has facilitated the work in the drawing section, and the adoption of the standard chart on prepared manila paper, on which all corrections are made, enables the engravers to make corrections and· tracings direct from the proof without making adjustments for shrinkage and expansion.
E. CHART DIVISION.
1.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT.

Several changes have been made in the organization of the Chart Divisiou during the past year which conduce to economy of service and the more rapid execution of routine duties. From the beginning of the year until NO\·ember r Assistant Gershom Bradford was acting as Hydrographic Inspector, still retaining, however, the direction of the Chart Division, properly so called, in connection with his new duties. At the abovementioned date hj:! Was reassigned to his former position, under the designation of Inspector of Charts, at the same time taking to this division what had been known as the Hydrographic Section under the Hydrographic Inspector. On January r, 1899, the entire business wi~h the agencies for the sale of charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables, which had previously been conducted in the Miscellaneous Section of the Accounting Division, was transferred to the Chart Division. The result of this has been, so far, very satisfactory; so that the Chart Division now comprises two subdivisions, in one of which, called the Hydrographic Section, the plotting and verification of charts is carried on, and the other, under the designation of Chart Section, has charge of the correction and distribution of ch.arts. When information is received making necessary a change on any chart, the correc~. tion is indicated on a standard sheet. This is kept for reference. The indicated correction, if of sufficient importance to justify its immediate publicity, is sent to the chart section, and all copies are corrected by hand before being sent out. If no reason exists why immediate publication should be made the information is sent to the Drawing and Engraving Division, and it is then engraved on the plate.
2.

HYDROGRAPHIC SECTION.

a. Plotting.

The plotting and verification of sheets as they come from the field has been carried on throughout the year in the usual manne::. Proofs, charts, and drawings have also been revised and verified. In this section is conducted the whole work of the preparation of ~he monthly notice to mariners, a publication which appears regularly for the improvement of charts. The drafting in this division has consisted in plotting the contents of nearly 150 volumes of field records, comprising over 200 ooo soundings, and covering nearly 4 ooo miles of distance. Over 200 drawings and proofs of charts were verified, and on nearly 4 ooo separate charts corrections were indicated.
b. Data.

All the data employed in this division is not the result of our own work. Much is derived from outside sources, wherever available, notably from the Light-House Board (aids to navigation, etc.); the Corps of Engineers, U.S.A.; the Hydrographic Office of the Navy, and, finally, by miscellaneous means.

II.

1'ECHNICAL DIVISIONS, 3. CHART SECTION.

a. Receipts.

The hand correction and the distribution 6f charts is carried on in this subdivision, and the work may be divided into two distinct parts: first, the receipts, and, second, the issue of material. The receipts of new charts and maps during the past year comprised 17 different ones printed by lithography and 2 by copperplate, the total number of copies being over 72 ooo. These include 9 along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts; 3 for the vicinity of the Yukon River delta, Alaska; 3 for Porto Rico; and 1 for the Hawaiian Islands, and r for Cuba. Two of St. Paul Island, Alaska, have also been received and are ready for distribution. Thirty-five new copperplate editions of charts and 18 new lithograph editions have been delivered to this section for issue during the year.
b. Issue.

In the fiscal year 1899 the total issue was about 50 per cent larger than the average for the past nine years. This does not include the year 1898, which was omitted 011 account of the abnormal demand caused by the gold discoveries in Alaska and the war with Spain. The free distribution of charts was 75 per cent larger than the average. The net sales have increased 32 per cent in copies and 30 per cent in value as compared with the previous average. 'I'he Coast Pilots and Tide Tables issued during the year have been: For the Coast Pilots-Atlantic coast, 724; Pacific coast, 74, while the number of copies of Tide Tables issued, embracing the United States and foreign ports, has been 427, and the number of separate reprints issued for the Pacific coast, including Alaska, hag been 2 458. These figures show the increased demand for Tide Tables on the Pacific coast on account of the Alaska commerce, and also that when the part of the volume desired is published separately it attains a very much greater distribution. Thirty-five new chart agencies have been added to our list on the Atlantic coast since the month of March. The total issue of charts during the year comprises something more than 83 ooo copies, having a value of over $34 ooo.
r~

INSTRU.llfENT DIVISION.

The work of the Instrument Division of the Office is properly the repair of old instruments and the design and construction of new ones. Other collateral duties naturally fall to this department, the details of which need not be specified in this place. Sometimes instruments are purchased in the open market, but when the peculiar work of the Survey requires special designs it is necessary to prepare them in our own Office. More than l ooo instruments were adjusted and sent to the field during the year, and about 800 were received. The total number of instruments owned by the Survey at this date is 8 o89, of which 5 320 are actually in the field. In order to avail ourselves of the recent experiments at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, where an alloy of nickel and steel has been made with an extremely low temperature coefficient, correspondence was had with a view of obtaining certain specimens of this new metal for casting. By so doing many parts of our instruments could be made almost insensible to the effects of temperature. The alloy could not be furnished suitable for casting, and hence experiments were undertaken in our

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898-<)g,

own Bureau which resulted in the production of an alloy which can be readily cast, and whose temperature coefficient is as much below that of steel as steel is less than that of brass. The application of this new metal to the construction of instruments will result in the perfection of many parts hitherto unsatisfactory on account of temperature variation. The new metal has already been applied to several geodetic levels, which are now in use in the field, and it is confidently believed that the results will show a practical elimination of discrepancies hitherto existing. In these new instruments provision was made for the observer to read the level and the rod at the same time, using an eye for each instrument, which reduces considerably the chance of error from vibrations on the ground. Four new leveling rods were made and treated with paraffin, for protection against hygrometric influences. A new 12-inch position theodolite, for primary triangulation, was completed. But little progress could be made on the construction of the new tidepredicting machine on account of urgency of other work.
G. LIBRANY AND ARCHIVES DIVISION.
1.

SUMMARY.

The Library and Archives Division is charged with the custody of original observations, and hydrographic and topographic sheets of the Survey, as well as tide rolls, negatives, log books, and all original matter embodying the results of labors of the Survey in the field.
2.

SHELVING ARRANGEMENTS.

The fixed shelf system has been abandoned and the Dewey decimal system readopted. This enables all works to be classified in the same locality and adapts itself to the every day expansion of the Library. The maps and atlases have been classified according to the Cutter Local List, and the results have been found very satisfactory.
3. CLASSIFICATION.

During the year 15 ooo volumes, comprising the entire Library, have been labeled and classified according to the Dewey system above mentioned. This includes the original volumes of computation and observation, original sheets, miscellaneous ma ps, and photographic negatives, prints, and lantern slides. . Sea-bottom specimens have been arranged according to geographical position, and numerous volumes have been prepared for the binder. These include both the periodicals received by the Survey and original volumes of observations. In the system now followed, all those books that are frequently used are brought to the lower floors, and are thus more easily accessible.
0

4. ACCESSIONS.

Every new piece received is entered in one of five books, according to its destination. The division adopted comprises the Library, archives, original sheets, maps and charts, and photographs and lantern slides. Each object is individually numbered. Over Boo volumes, 300 cahiers, and about 500 sheets, have been received. Miscellaneous articles, such as specimens of sea bottom, tidal rolls, photographs, and negatives, have come in and are stored in their appropriate places.

III.

PUBLICATION.

47

A. ANNUAL REPORT.

There has been published during the year the Annual Report of the Superintendent 1 of the Survey for the year 1897, of which about r 800 copies were received from the Public Printer. This report is a volume of 774 quarto pages, including 12 appendices. Fifteen progress sketches appear at the close of the report proper, and r88 diagrams and cuts illustrate the different appendices. Prominent among the subjects treated in these special papers are magnetism, longitude, leveling, gravity, tides, photo-topography, and base lines.
B. BULLETINS.

Three bulletins, all relating to Alaska, have been published. No. 37 contains hydrographic notes and sailing directions, from Dixon Entrance to Yakutat Bay; No. 38 gives similar information for Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet, Kadiak Island, and route from Unalaska to Chignik. These two bulletins are published through the courtesy of the United States Fish Commission, the information having been collected by Lieut. Commander J. F. Moser, U.S. N., commanding the steamer Albatross, belonging to the Commission. No. 40 contains Coast Pilot notes on the Fox Island Passes, Unalaska Bay, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean as far as Point Barrow. For fuller details regarding these publications, see under the heading ''A. Hydrographic Division2. Coast Pilot Party."
C. NOTICE TO llfARINERS.

The usual number of Notices to Mariners, containing chart corrections, have been published monthly, about4 4oocopiesbeingdistributed ateachtime. Thisis one of the important publications of the service. In order that the charts may be of continual use to commerce they must be kept up to date. Changes are going on incessantly. New light-houses are being established; wreck buoys are being placed in position, and these are discontinued when the wrecks are removed; improvements are always in progress, as the dredging of channels, building of bridges, and the construction of jetties. Moreover, by the continual action of the sea, bars change at the entrance to harbors. This necessitates shifting the watermarks. The Notice to Mariners gives, every month, the necessary chart corrections, and thus practically furnishes every possessor of a chart with a new edition containing the latest information available. As illustrating the character of information furnished, the following paragraph is extracted at random from the last edition CJ une, r 899):
NEW JERSEY.
12. New York approach-Off Seabriglzt-Ligkted wreck buoy establisked.-On June 20, 1899, a gas buoy, painted red and black in horizontal stripes, and showing a fixed white light during periods of thirteen seconds separated by eclipses of nine seconds' duration, was established in 54 feet of water, about 200 feet south-southeasterly from the wreck of the steamer llfacedonia, sunk off Seabright. The wreck heads NW. by N., arid both masts show above the water. The buoy is on the bearings: Scotland Light-vessel, N. by E. ~ E. Sandy Hook Light-vessel, NE.;( N.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1898--99.

The publication also contains lists of new charts, new and canceled editions, publication agencies, and storm display stations. The notices may be obtained, free of charge, in the principal seaboard cities of the country, and from United States consulates in foreign ports.
D. TIDE TABLES.

Tide Tables for the Pacific coast were received from the Public Printer during the year. These contain the predi~ted times and heights of every high and low water thoughtout the year, at seven principal ports. By means of auxiliary tables accompanying them this information can be extended to more than 400 subordinate stations. The times of slack water at Seymour Narrows, Discovery Passage, British Columbia, and Sergius Narrows, Peril Strait, Alaska, are also given. These are important points on the Alaskan route. The channels being all deep, information as to the height of the tide is of little concern to the mariner; whereas the state of the current, which is here very strong, is of vital importance. There are four slack waters each day; the times of which, singularly enough, do not coincide with the stand of the tide or the turning point of its vertical movement.
E. COAST PILOT.

Five supplements to the Coast Pilot for the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have been issued. One of these includes the Rules of the Road at Sea and in Harbors, Rivers, and Inland Waters. The supplements are to the Coast Pilot what the Notice to Mariners is to the charts. They give information received and notes of the more important corrections and additions necessary since the publication of the volume affected.
F. SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS.

Special Publication No. 2, entitled Publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1807-1896, and Weights and Measures, 1790-1896, has also appeared. Separate copies of the 12 appendices included in, the Superintendent's Annual Report for 1897 have been received, in numbers varying from roo to 300. In addition to the above publications, circulars relating to office duties and routine matters have been printed. IV. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. Important services have been rendered by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures to the various bureaus of the Government engaged in work requiring accurate standards of reference: The United States Mint, Department of Agriculture, United States Geological Survey, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Nicaraguan Canal Commission, and especially to the United States Customs Service. All the apparatus used in the polariscopic analysis of imported sugars, for the imposition of duties, are tested, adjusted, and standardized by this Office. . As in previous years, a considerable portion of the time of this Office has been devoted to the comparison and adjustment of weights and measures for State and municipal purposes; for manufacturers, surveyors, engineers, and others aiming to secure the utmost accuracy in their work.

IV.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

49

The preliminary arrangements have been almost completed for taking up the verification of electrical standards and measuring apparatus. Secondary standards of reference and electrical apparatus of various kinds have been acquired, standards of electro-motive force constructed, and methods of comparison developed. The Office is now prepared to standardize direct current measuring apparatus, but the lack of ·time and of a sufficient appropriation have so far prevented any measures being taken for standardizing alternating current measuring apparatus. This will be a most important branch of work in the future, . as alternating currents are almost exclusively used in the long distance transmission of power cin a large scale. Considerable time during the year was given to a redetermination of the temperature coefficients of sugar and quartz phtes, and to the preparation of other testimony for use in the trial of importers of sugars versus the United States. Nearly all the work done in the Office has been, as usual, much hampered by lack of facilities. Most of the apparatus now on hand was designed many years ago and does not meet our present requirements, either for accuracy or facility in making comparisons. There is not in the Office at the present time a suitable instrument for the comparison of standards of length of r metre or less; nor are we prepared to make comparisons of thermometers at temperatures lower than zero or higher than 50 degrees Centigrade. Some study has been given to both these questions, but as we have no suitable rooms in which the apparatus could be installed, little could be done. The construction of a .comparator and a constant temperature room is, therefore, one of the greatest necessities at present. Most of the verifications and comparisons, as well as the necessary computations, have been made by Mr. L. A. Fischer, Adjuster, who \\las in immediate charge of the Office, under the direction of Assistant Andrew Braid, in charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures. Dr. F. A. Wolff, jr., has given most of his time to the question of electrical standards. He purified the chemicals for and set up a number of Clark and Cadman cells, and inter compared the former with gratifying results. He also inter compared the resistances purchased from 0. Wolff, of Berlin. S. Doc. 454--4

RECONNOISSANCE.

a. llliddle Division.

Before an adequate scheme of triangulation can be adopted a reconnoissance is necessary. In the development of the work along the ninety-eighth meridian several parties have taken the field for the purpose of carrying out this preliminary work. Nebraska.-Assistant Granger, who has been operating in Kansas and Nebraska for several years past, returned to the field and continued the work during both seasons of the present fiscal year. Only part of this time was devoted to reconnoissance, as it was considered desirable to carry along the triangulation as soon as sufficient points were available. A reconnoissance was made near Hastings, Nebr., in order to establish a station at a point called "Mason." The result of this work was that the old scheme of triangulation was somewhat modified and the work considerably strengthened. During the latter part of the fiscal year additional work in reconnoissance was executed in order to locate a base line. Considerable difficulty was experienced in this work, as the condition was imposed that one end of the line should be an interior station of a quadrilateral in the triangulation. liansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.-Assistant Stehman Fomey, who has had charge of the work in this direction between the thirty-ninth parallel and the Mexican boundary, was in the field at the beginning of the fiscal year, and during the season, which includes the last part of the previous fiscal year and the first part of the present one, 480 miles along the ninety-eighth meridian were covered with a provisional scheme consisting of quadrilaterals. The average length of the sides was about 24 miles, and the area covered by the network is r 7 ooo square miles. Seventy-five triangulation stations are embraced in the scheme, and 108 points were examined and actually observed and occupied. This left 3° 3o' between the termination of the work on the north and the transcontinental triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel, and 3 ° between its southern tenninus and the Rio Grande. The work was continued northward by Assistant Forney during the latter part of the fiscal year, and a juuction was made in June, in the· vicinity of Arlington, Kansas, 60 miles north of the State line with Assistant Eimbeck, working south from Ellsworth, Kans. During the first part of the fiscal year two base lines
SI

52

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<J9.

were selected in the Chickasaw Nation, Ind. T. During the latter part of the year two additional ones were established, one near Elreno and the other at Anthony. The conditions under which this reconnoissance was made were rather unfavorable, on account of the smoke from prairie fires. Nights, however, were exceptionally clear, and for this reason it has been recommended by Assistant Forney that observations during the daytime be limited to secondary points and the night reserved for the principal triangulation. Great differences of temperature were experienced, the thermometer standing at 110 in the shade on many days between June and October, while the nights were comparatively cool. Kansas.-Assistant Eimbeck took the field early in May, and was charged with making a reconnoissance from the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude southward on the ninety-eighth meridian. This work was to be continued until a junction was made with Assistant Forney, after which the party was to return to Ellsworth, Kans., the point of departure, and take up the triangulation.· The scheme proposed was executed, and four distinct trigonometrical figures were laid out, extending about 70 miles to the southward from the thirty-ninth parallel, here joining the reconuoissance of Assistant Forney, brought northward from Texas. At the end of the fiscal year the party had returned to Ellsworth, Kans., and was preparing to take up the triangulation.
b. Alaska.

Chilkat.-It is estimated that between thirty and forty thousand people entered the Yukon territory in 1897 via the Chilkoot and White Pass routes. Such activity made it incumbent on the Coast and Geodetic Survey to make a reconnoissance of the region, with a view of issuing, as soon as possible, maps covering the region between the head of Lynn Canal and the passes. Assistant J. A. Flemer was given charge of this work, and two parties were organized, one under his personal supervision and the other in charge of Assistant John Nelson. The object of this work was to make a running survey of the Chilkat River Valley on the west and the Katsehin River Valley on the east, and later to continue the work from Dyea northward to the Chilkoot and White passes. The parties, together, during the entire season, covered an area of about 500 square miles, including the valleys of the following rivers: Chilkat, Tsirku, Tlehini, Katsehin, Skagway, and Dyea. In the prosecution of this work the photo-topographic camera was called into requisition, and the sheets are based on observations from 18 camera stations on the Chilkat sheet and an equal number on the Dyea sheet. Triangulation was employed whenever practicable, and traverse. lines were used when necessary. Much difficulty was experienced with the weather, only thirteen days without rain occurring between July 1 and September 9. The necessity for new maps in such a region may be understood from the rapid transformation taking place. In August, 1897, but three wooden buildings were to be seen at Skagway. September found hundreds of tents on the ground, and in January, 1898, 700 buildings and over 3 ooo inhabitants made up the town. Many of the conveniences of. civilization are evident on all sides, including an electric-light plant, the power for which is derived from a mountain lake. Skagway.-The work in the Skagway River Valley is executed on a scale of 1: 80 ooo, and a map of the town of Skagway was drawn on a scale of 1 : 2 0 000 · The valley map includes the White Pass and Yukon Railroad. From the summit of White

I.

53

Pass to the head of Lake Bennett there is a pack trail, which joins at the latter point the old trail leading from the Chilkoot Pass. '!'he Chilkoot route is shorter, but the one through White Pass offers better transportation facilities, and crosses the divide about r 100 feet lower than the· one through Chilkoot. Ou the Dyea route the Chilkoot wagon road follows the old Indian trail very closely. The ·wagon road leads from Dyea to Canyon City, a distance of· 9 miles, crossing the stream many times by fords and bridges. From Canyon City an aerial wire tramway conveys merchandise in wooden boxes or buckets over the Chilkoot Pass to Crater Lake. A pack trail also leads from Canyon City to 'the Scales, at the foot of Chilkoot Pass. From Sheep Camp to '!'he Scah;s, about 2 ~ miles, the rise is r 600 feet. From 'the Scales to the Summit, a distance of about 3 ooo feet, the increase in height is at least r ooo feet, the last 500 feet being very steep.

BASE

LINE~.

No primary bases were measured during the past fiscal year. Several tertiary ones were selected, and a few were measured iri connection with triangulatiou of a secondary character, which was in hand at the time. 'three such bases were measured in the prosecution of the Yukon River work. One was situated at Camp Pritchett, on the tundra back of St. Michaels; another on the Kripniyuk, and another on the Kwiklok. '!'he apparatus employed for these measurements were steel tapes, which furnished all the accuracy necessary for the triangulation based upon them.
3. TRIANGULATION.

The work in, triangulation has been carried on extensively in many parts of the country. Most of it, however, has been done in connection with other work, forming a basis of hydrographic or topographic operations. Only two large schemes were carried on having for their object the development o.f the triangulation alone. These were in southern California and on the ninety-eighth meridian.
a. Eastern division.

'the work in the Eastern Division comprises that around Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, in connection with the hydrographic and topographic survey undertaken by Assistant P. A. Welker on the steamer Bache. Other triangulation of a secondary nature was executed by Assistant Hodgkins in Massachusetts and Maryland, and a number of parties carried out these operations on Cliesapeake Bay. '!'he work of Assistant Perkins in this last-named locality was comprehensive in its nature, and was intended to cover the whole bay, irrespective of the other operations then in progress. It was begun near Havre de Grace and completed to the Capes on the east side and nearly so on the western. The party operating on the Hudson River also executed triangulation, which was used in the topographic work there undertaken. In connection with the survey of the outer bar at Brunswick, Ga., by Assistant Marindin, Assistant Perkins was directed to develop the topography of the insi\fe waters at this place. '!'his necessitated a system of triangles, which were carried out as opportunity presented when the party was not engaged with Assistant Marindin on the bar work. Lake Maurepas, in Louisiana, was completed during the year, and this work was based on a triangulation running around the lake, with water signals some miles from shore.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1Rg8--<)9.

b. kliddle Division.

The triangulation in the Middle Division comprises work by Assistant Granger on the ninety-eighth meridian, in Kansas, and by Assistant Welker, at Aransas Pass, in Texas. The latter work was completed, but the former, forming part of the great arc of a meridian, is still in progress.
c. Western Division.

Assistant Sinclair was directed, during the year, to make geodetic connections of several longitude stations with the triangulation of the transcontinental arc. This was accomplished early in the year, after which work was resumed on the California and Nevada boundary. This work was also completed during the year, having been in hand for a number of years past. The work, however, was interrupted several times on account of a lack of appropriation. The triangulation, a more detailed account of which will be found in the field details published in Appendix No. 2 of this report, furnishes some fine examples of accurate work. Two points, one situated near Lake Tahoe and the other in the Colorado River, 400 miles distant, were connected by a range line which showed an error of only 150 metres at the terminal point. The work was controlled by triangulation and azimuth observations, but the line was ranged out from the initial point without correction until the southern extremity was reached. The triangulation in southern California, by Assistant Mosman, was made in order to connect the work, discontinued some years ago, south of San Francisco, with the Mexican boundary. The side<> are longer than those of any other triangulation executed during the year. In :act, this is really the most extended scheme of primary triangulation now in hand.
d. Alaska.

Yukon delta.-Triangulation was executed by the party of Assistant J. F. Pratt, operating in the region of the Yukon delta. A scheme of triangles was developed starting from a base line at St. Michael and carried southward to the Aproon entrance of the river. Minor triangulation was also made by cooperating parties at the mouth of the Kusilvak and other places in the delta. Copper River delta.-An extensive system of triangles was observed by Assistant H. P. Ritter, at the mouth of the Copper River. This work was used in connection with hydrograpbic and· topographic operations. and was carried as far inland as practicable, in order to determine the mountain peaks and other permanent landmarks necessary in a detailed survey of the country. During the latter part of the fiscal year the steamer Blake was in Porto Rico engaged in combined operations. Among other duties a triangulation was begun, and it is intended to carry this entirely around the island and thus form a basis for its accurate delineation. The existing data have been found entirely inadequate, and it is hoped that before another year very material progress will be made toward the conclusion of this important operation.
4. ASTRONOMICAL DETERMINATIONS.

Astronomical observations have been carried on in connection with magnetic and gravity work, mention of which will be made under the proper headings. Besides' these, the work executed in this line may be classified under the following subh~ads:

I.

LAND OPERATIONS.

55

a. Latitude.

While occupying Green River, Utah, for the purpose of determining longitude, Assistant Sinclair made astronomical observations for geographical latitude. Similar observations were also made at Soledad, Cal., by Assistant Mosman, and at Orea and other poiuis in the Copper River delta, by Assistant Ritter.
b. Longitude.

A number of important longitudes have tieen determined during the fiscal year, some of which \Vere accomplished by the chronometric method, and others by means of the telegraphic. Under the head of the former may be mentioned the work in Alaska. Making a base station at St. Michael, Assistant Pratt determined three points, longitudinally, at the mouth of the Yukon, namely, the Aproon Pass, the Lower Kwiklok, and the Kripniyuk. At the mouth of the Copper River Assistant Ritter determined the longitude of Orea aud several points farther in the interior. The telegraphic determinations were made at Green River and Oasis, Utah, connecting them with Salt Lake City as a base station. Marlow, Ind. T., was determined similarly, using Austin, Tex., as the initial point.
c. Azimuth.

In order to complete the connection of the Gulf and Atlantic coast triangulations, a few remaining azimuths were measured on the Peninsula of Florida and one was observed at Cardona Island light-house, near Ponce, P. R., in connection with the triangulation at that point. Assistant Mosman observed an azimuth at Soledad, in southern California, in order to check his trigonometrical positions.
d. Intenzatio11al latitude work.

At the Stuttgart meeting of the International Geodetic Association it was resolved to establish six stations on the parallel of latitude 39 ° 8', evenly distributed around the '.Norld, as near as circumstances would permit, for an exhaustive study of the variation of latitude. Three of these stations will be in the United States-one at Cincinnati, in the observatory located there, and the other two at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal. The work to be done in this country has been placed under the direct supervision of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the results obtained at the stations named will be reported from time to time in the publications of this Bureau. The operations up to the close of this fiscal year were merely of a preliminary nature, such as acquiring land, building observatories, preparations of observers, etc. Some time was spent by Assistant Smith in establishing the station at Gaithersburg, Md. The observations there will begin soon after the close of the fiscal y~ar 1899, and will continue for a number of years. A report of the progress made will be given in my_ next annual report. Similar preparations were made for a station at Ukiah, Cal., and reference to the work at that point will also appear later.
B. TOPOGRAPHY.

The topographical operations of the Survey have been widely distributed, and were carried on along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts aud in Alaska and Porto Rico.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<J9.

x. EASTERN DIVISION.

a. jlfartlzas Vineyard.

A topographical survey of Marthas Vineyard and No Mans Land was finished soon after the beginning of the fiscal year, and the party engaged in that work was immediately transferred to Chesapeake Bay, in the vicinity of Havre de Grace, where work was continued until the end of the season.
b. Chesapeake Bay.

Other work on the upper part of Chesapeake Bay was that of Assistant French, in the vicinity of Baltimore, and of Extra Observer Donn, immediately in the suburbs of the city. Assistant Marindin carried on work on the Sassafras River, and Aid Bowie took up the west shore of the bay between Baltimore and Havre de Grace, including the shores of the Gunpowder River. The Annapolis Harbor shore line and the Magothy River were also surveyed, after which Assistant Boutelle's party proceeded to the Elk River and continued work there until the end of the season. A chart covering the upper part of Chesapeake Bay is urgently needed at present, and a large part of the topographical force of the Survey has been assigned to this work. The topography in the vicinity of Baltimore is especially needed, and the hydrographic work throughout the entire upper part of the bay, from Annapolis northward, is a desideratum. This work will be pushed as rapidly as possible during the coming fiscal year.
c. Hudson River.

On the Hudson River, in connection with the hydrographic work, a topographic survey was made from Spuyten Duyvil to Piermont Pier, including the shore line and, the commercial improvements along it.
d. Portsmouth and Arkansas Pass.

The harbor at Portsmouth, N. H., was also surveyed topographically by Assistant Welker, fo command of the steamer Bache, at the conclusion of which work the party repaired to Aransas Pass, Tex., and completed the topography of the entrance and harbor at that place. On his way north a brief stop was made at Charleston Harbor, and in connection with other work some shore-line topography was done.
e. Lake llfaMepas.

For some time past work has been continued on Lake Pontchartrain, and this having been recently completed it was desirable to complete the map of the region hy making a survey of Lake Maurepas. This was successfully accomplished by Assistant French during the past year. The map shows the topography around the lake and is a valuable addition to the hydrographic map, which will soon be published, of the locality.

a. Grays Harbor.

b. San Dt'ego.

c. San Pedro.

On the Pacific coast Assistant Westdahl, on the steamer Gedney, first proceeded to Grays Harbor, executing the topography of the entrance and the shore line for some distance northward; then went to San Diego, Cal., where the city front and the Government improvements were mapped, and finally touched at San Pedro, where the shore line and jetties were surveyed.
d. San Francisco.

On the north side of San Francisco Bay topography was executed by Assistant Fremont Morse, and 011 the conclusion of this work two additional sheets were taken up and :finished on the ocean side of San Francisco Peninsula. This completed the topographical survey in the locality mentioned.
e. California and Nevada boundary.

In the operations on the California and Nevada boundary line it was m:cessary to do some topography, and Assistant Sinclair has made a map, on a scale of I :40 ooo, of the Colorado River at the point where the boundary line terminates.
3. ALASKA.

a. Yukon River.

The topographical work in Alaska during this fiscal year consisted : first, in mapping the water front at St. Michael, at the request of the commanding officer of the military reservation; second, in surveying the Yukon Delta, especially at the mouth of the Kripniyuk; third, the operations on the Copper River, and fourth, those at the head of the Lynn Canal. In the last-mentioned work tl;e photo-topographic method was largely employed and accelerated the work in the field very materially.
b. Copper River.

At the mouth of the Copper River, Assistant Ritter, also using the photo-topographic method, carried - on a survey of the shore line, sloughs, etc., as well as a determination of the mountain peaks lying farther to the northward. The country in the vicinity of the mouth of the Copper River, as seen when approaching it from the sea, has the appearance of a vast, snow-capped mountain range whose tops are covered with perpetual snow. Innumerable glaciers move down the mountain sides and fill the deeply cut canyons. The distance from the head of the delta to the ocean reef is about 2s miles. The delta is 50 miles wide, and the mountain range from 1 ooo to 8 ooo feet in elevation. The fiats at the mouth of the river are cut up into numerous islands by the many tidal sloughs and small streams flowing from the glaciers. Many interesting features may be noted in regard to this particular locality, among which may be mentioned the violent winds, which begin during the month of September and last with little interruption through the winter until early spring. They are of such violence that it is impossible for anyone to cross the delta while they prevail. The body of water intervening between the flats and the ocean reefs is navigable

58

COAST AND .GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 189i)-99.

to boats drawiHg from 3 to 4 feet of water, and is in places navigable to these only at high tide. With the receding of the tide an area of about 250 square miles is completely drained and presents nothing but one unbroken surface of mud. The currents during the rising tide are extremely swift, as the ocean reef forms a barrier until the water rises over it, when it flows in with great rapidity.
4. PORTO RICO.

During the visit of the United States steamer Blake to Porto Rico, for the execution of combined operations, topography was done in the harbor of Ponce during the months of January and February, 1899. This work was not extensive in character, being limited to a delineation of the shore line and the principal jetties of the harbor.

SPIRIT LEVELING.

a. Easten1 Divisio11.

A line of precise levels has been proposed from the Great Lakes southward, crossing and checking our work on the thirty-ninth parallel, and continuing into Tennessee, there touching the lines from the seaboard by the Geological Survey; thence onward to the work of the United States Engineers, in Alabama; and finally to connect with our own levels, brought from the Gulf. This line will form a connecting link between the determinations of the three great Government organizations; and has been begun by Assistant 0. W. Ferguson, starting from Gibraltar, Mich., and moving southward toward Cincinnati, Ohio. At the close of the fiscal year this line was completed to Toledo, Ohio, a distance of 39 miles.
b. Llfiddle Division.

The measurement of an arc in North America, on the ninety-eighth meridian, involves the determination of heights as well. In order to carry out work in this direction, Assistant Baldwin was directed to take up precise leveling at Abilene, Kans., and continue northward through the country traversed by the triangulation just mentioned. The route to be followed was: First to Superior, Nebr., thence to Lester and Hastings; thence to Grand Island; and from that point by the Union Pacific Railway to Columbus and Norfolk. At the close of the fiscal year the line was completed to Lovewell, Kans. While this work was iaprogress, Assistant Winston was continuing his line on the transcontinental route, and had begun operations at Denver, Colo. Early in the fiscal year this ·line had been extended by Assistant Winston from Colorado Springs, Colo., to Denver, and a check line run back to Limon, Colo., a point 01i the direct line to Colorado Springs. At Colorado Springs connection was made with bench marks established previously by Assistant Eimbeck and connected by him with Pikes Peak triangulation point by vertical angle measures. Bench marks established by Assistant Eimbeck on top of Pikes Peak were also connected by Assistant Winston with a bench mark of the cogwheel railroad on the summit. Triangulation points Divide and West Base, when vertical angles on Pikes Peak

had been observed, were brought into the line of levels during the last fiscal year, and thus four independent connections were made between the levels and the Pikes Peak station, giving connection with tide water on the Pacific Coast through the vertical angle measures already made between Pikes Peak and the coast. On this connection depends the elevation of the Salt Lake Base Line, near Ogden, Utah. Assistant Winston extended the line northward from Denver in the latter part of the fiscal year, and at its close had reached the vicinity of Eaton, Colo.
c. /Veslern Division.

The lines of leveling carried out on th~ Pacific Coast were only such as were required to connect the station Mount Lola with Truckee, on the Central Pacific Railroad, and at Sacramento to determine the height of the State capitol dome ab')ve the bench mark in that place. This gave a close connection between the vertical angles which Assistant Gilbert had carried out during the last fiscal year, and the lines of precise leveling leading down to tide water.
2.

VERTICAL ANGLES.

The determination of heights by means of vertical angles has been made in connection with primary triangulation operations wherever carried out during the last year. They furnish a rapid, and in particular cases, highly satisfactory method of determining differences of height.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

During this fiscal year a new division of the Survey, working in the line of terrestrial magnetism, has been created, and Dr. L. A. Bauer has been called to act as chief of this Division. The organ~zation did not take place until Dr. Bauer became formally attached to the Survey, which was on May r, and from this time until the close of the year r6 stations in Maryland, 5 in Delaware, and I in West Virginia were occupied by him for the usual deten~1inations of magnetic elements.
2.

DECLINATION, DIP, AND INTENSITY.

Eastern Division.-Considerable work was done during the past fiscal year in the line of terrestrial magnetism by Assistant j. B. Baylor. At the request of the State geologist of North Carolina, transmitted through the governor of the State, Assistant Baylor was given instructions to make a magnetic survey under his direction. This work continued from the 1st of July until the r6th of October, during which time rs stations, all county seats, had been occupied in North Carolina. At the beginning of the fiscal.year Assistant Smith was engaged in West Virginia in magnetic determinations. Operations continued until August 3, when Assistant Smith was ordered to other duty, and he again took up magnetic observations on October 5, and continued them until the 23d of November, this time occupying a number of stations in the New England States.

60

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99 .

.3· MERIDIAN LINES.

In order that county surveyors might be provided with means to test their compasses and chains, meridian lines were established at all county seats where magnetic observations were made, and a standard of length was marked in the vicinity of the court-house, usually on the floor of the building itself. This wilt enable the surveying profession to readily determine any uncertainty in its instruments, whether compass or chain, and it is believed that the procedure will very much diminish the causes of litigation now so prevalent.
4. SECULAR VARIATIONS.

Whenever possible, stations were occupied for secular variation. This operation consists in reoccupying the old station and determining the same elements, declination, dip, and intensity which were determined many years previously. By this means it is possible to arrive a'L the changes taking place; and to formulate quite accurately the law which these variations follow.
R. GRA Vf1T.
1.

EASTERN DIVISION.

During the year several determinations of relatiYe gravity were made. Assistant E. Smith, basing his observations on Washington, swung pendulum apparatus B at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, and at the Columbia University, New York. These pendulums were swung recently by Prof. J. H. Gore, of the Columbian University, Washington, D. C., at some extremely northern stations in Sweden, and were also used by Assistant Preston in Honolulu in 1891 and 1892, where consecutive observations were made for nearly fourteen months, 199 nights being obtained during t11is period.
2.

W:ESTERN DIVISION.

The removal of the State University of Washington to its new location near Seattle made it desirable to determine the difference of the force of gravity between the old station in the town proper and the new site of the university. It is intended to make the last-named place the base station for operations of this character in the northwestern part of the United States and in Alaskan territory; so that one of the first duties necessary was the transferring of the old station in Seattle to the new one at the State university. This was done by Assistant Putnam during the winter of 1898-99 with gratifying results, the difference between the determinations of 1891 at the high school in Seattle and that at the present time being only iruu 1 u1Hf part. There appears to be, at both the high school in Seattle and at the State university, a defect of the force of gravity amounting to about thirteen one-hundredths of a dyne in both cases.
F. SPECIAL 'DUTY.
I.

REPRESENTATIVE.

The Coast and Geodetic Survey has been represented during the past year at the magnetic conference at Bristol, England; at the International Geodetic Association conference at Stuttgart, Germany, and at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at Boston, Mass. At all of these meetings infonnation of

I.

61

value was acquired. The Coast and Geodetic Survey delegates took a prominent part in the proceedings, and the discussion of the methods led to enlarged views and to economical prosecution of subsequent work at home.
a. llfagnetic co11.fere11ce, Bristol, England.

At the Bristol conference' one of the principal topics was the establishment of permanent magnetic observatories. This action is becoming more imperative every year, and the United States, since the acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands, is in a position to carry out the project in a way most beneficial, first to science, then to commerce. The islands lie in the center of a region almost totally unexplored magnetically. The laws governing the change of declination (''variation of the compass'') are imperfectly known throughout the Pacific, which is destined to be, more than ever before, a most important body of water for American shipping interests. No more important contribution to our knowledge of terrestrial magnetism could be made than the location of an observatory at Honolulu. This will be done as soon as possible.
b. I11ter11aN011al Geodetic Association, Stuttgart, Germany.

At Stuttgart several points of value were achieved. First, through the action taken by the American delegate, the reconnaissance for an arc of the meridian in Equador and Peru is now under way. This work will furnish data for a better determination of the shape of the earth. Second, a new determination of the difference of longitude between Paris and Greenwich will shortly be made. This knowledge, which would appear at first sight of no concern to Americans, is in reality not only interesting to us, but enters directly into the establishment of our relative position on the earth's surface. Incidentally, the Coast and Geodetic Survey solved this problem several years ago. A combination of European work, involving determinations through six of their important longitude centers, has only served to confirm the American value. It now only remains for the observatories at the points in question to bring their own results in accord with what must eventually be recognized as the nearest practical approach to the truth. Third, a plan for the systematic study of the motion of the earth's pole was perfected; an important question, not only in astronomy but in geodesy as well, and valuable to this country from both standpoints. Of the six stations located around the world one-half are within the limits of the United States, which gives us a most prominent part in the study of -a question the solution of which will benefit the rest of the world as well as ourselves. The work accomplished by the United States during the past fiscal year in the execution of this plan has been mentioned under the subhead ''Astronomical determinations.''
c. American Association.for tlze Advancement o.f Science, Boston, lllass.

At Boston, not only did the representatives of the Coast and Geodetic Survey attend the meeting of the American Association, but they were instructed to be present also at the Congress of Astronomers and Astro-Physicists. At both meetings the interchange of ideas and the· discussion of improved methods of investigations were productive of useful information. Among the subjects treated were star catalogues and the variation of latitude. to both of which the Survey is now devoting considerable attention.

PORTO RICO.

An officer of the Survey was sent· to Porto Rico to establish tidal stations, to investigate the methods of making a triangulation of the island, and to make inquiries on the existing standard weights and measures and on the Spanish laws and regulations in regard to them. The results obtained were in every way satisfactory. Two automatic tide gauges were set up, one on the north side of the island, at San Juan, and the other on the south side, at Ponce. Both are now furnishing continuous records of tidal phenomena, which will aid materially in the predictions for West Indian ports. At San Juan a broken series of Spanish automatic tide-gauge records, extending over about six years, was found, and by permission of the military authorities they were sent to this Office for reduction. An examination was made into the value of some trigonometric data which had been recommended for purchase by this Government by the military authorities, providing that actual tests in the field would establish their relfability. Field tests were applied, but the results indicated that the data were not as good as had been supposed. A valuable topographic map of the vicinity of San Juan was found and copied, and a tracing, made under the direction of Major Root, of the United States Volunteer Engineers, was obtained for the use of this Office. Weights and Measures offices at Mayaguez, Ponce, and San Juan were visited, and inquiry was made into the laws relating to this subject and their administration, and by request of the commanding general a brief report was submitted to him on the result of these inquiries.
3. STATE BOUNDARIES.

The survey of the boundary between California and Nevada has been finished. Prominent among the auxiliary functions of the Coast and Geodetic Survey may be cited the impartial and disinterested information given on the subject of State-boundary disputes. Many adjustments based on data furnished by this service have been made, and the past year has seen the completion of the field work on the longest interstate boundary yet traced by the Survey. Four seasons have been employed and about $JI ooo expended in surveying and temporarily marking the 400 miles between Lake Tahoe and the Colorado River. The difficulty of running this line was on account of the great elevations and the inhospitable nature of the region traversed. The line crosses the White Mountains at a height of 13 ooo feet, and passes for more than 100 miles through Death Valley and the Amargosa Desert. This required the employment of a large party and a corresponding pack train for the transportation of the instruments, camp outfit, and forage.
4. MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION.

An officer of the Survey has been, as usual, detailed as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, performing this duty as occasion demanded, in com,ection with other duties on the Survey.
5. INTERNATIONAL LATITUDE OBSERVATIONS.

In accordance with authority granted by the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury, the Coast and Geodetic Survey has undertaken the supervision of the latitude observations carried out under the auspices of the International Geodetic Association, whose central office and direction is at Potsdam, Germany. During the year property has been

I

secured and the preliminary steps taken to establish observatories at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., the necessary funds for the purpose being furnished by the International Geodetic Association and disbursed by the Superintendent of the Survey. The work thus far accomplished in this line has been referred to under the subhead ''Astronomical determinations.''
6. SUBOFFICES.

a.

San Francisco.

The suboffice at San Francisco was in charge of Assistant A. F. Rodgers during the fiscal year. Besides the regular duties of a routine nature, Assistant Rodgers had charge of special operations, such as the tidal and astronomical stations at the Presidio; and also the steamers Patterson and .111cArthur, which were temporarily laid up in Oakland Harbor. In April, 1899, Assistant Rodgers made a report on the site proposed for the International Geodetic Association latitude station, at Ukiah, Cal. During the year he prepared tidal data, which were distributed weekly to the daily papers of San Francisco.
b. Seattle.

The suboffice at this place was in charge of Assistant J. F. Pratt-after his return from Alaska on October 16-to April 20, 1899. He was then detached, aud was engaged in preparatory work for the coming season's work at the mouth of the Yukon. The suboffice was left in charge of Assistant F. A. Young, who performed this duty until the 13th of June, when he was relieved by Assistant J. J. Gilbert, who continued in this capacity until the close of the fiscal year.
7. NIAGARA RIVER BRIDGE.

The board convened by the Secretary of War for the purpose of determining the width of the pivot spans of the bridge crossing the Niagara River below Buffalo was composed of Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, chairman; Col. Jared Smith, Corps of Engineers, U.S. A.; and Henry L. Marindin, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey. This board met in September and Assistant Marindin was detailed to attend its sessions. He was absent from his regular work between the 18th and 26th of September.
8. INSPECTION.

a.

Chart age11cieJ.

A tour of inspection was made by Assistant G. Bradford, of the chart agencies along the Atlantic seaboard and on the Gu-If coast. The object was to acquire as much general and special information as possible in regard to the opinions and wants of the maritime public.
b. Topographic field parties, etc.

During the early part of the year Assistant H. G. Ogden made an inspection of the topographic and hydrographic parties working on Chesapeake Bay. Later his attention was given to the construction of the steamer Pathfinder, then under way at Elizabethport, N. J., and also the repairs of the steamer Bache, which was at the time lying at Mobile, Ala. At the conclusion of this work, continuing on to New Orleans, he made an inspection of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner Quick, in company with the local inspector of hulls. The result of this action was the practical

COAST,AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898--99.

condemnation of the schooner Qui"ck. Toward the close of the fiscal year Assistant Ogden proceeded to the Pacific coast and made an inspection of the topographic and hydrographic parties then fitting out for the next season's work in Alaska.
c. Ninety-eigllth meridian.

During the month of June, 1899, Assistant J. F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodesy, proceeded to the scene of operations on the ninety-eighth meridian. }le visited successively the parties of Assistants Forney, Eimbeck, Baldwin, and Granger, the first two being engaged on reconnoissance, the third on leveling, and the last on triangulation. The result of this inspection tour was to systematize the method of dealing with the records and, in some cases, the methods of observation. II. SEA OPERATIONS.
A. HYDROGRAPHY.
I.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

Hydrography has been pushed vigorously during the entii:e fiscal year in various localities. In the Eastern Division, comprising the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and the island of Porto Rico, there have been 11 parties employed. In the Middle Division 1 party has been at work, in Texas. Iri the Western Division 7 parties were employed, and an equal number were occupied in Alaska. Five vessels were engaged in these operations in the Eastern Division, 1 in the. Middle Division, 2 on the Pacific coast, and 4 in Alaska.
2.

OFF-SHORE.

· Off-shore hydrography was not prosecuted to any very great extent during the past year, the operations being chiefly confined to in-shore work. The party of Assistant Pratt, however, made an examination of the bar off the mouth of the Yukon River, which is reported to extend 40 miles to the southward from the shore proper. This was examined in part only. The work at the Brunswick bar, pursued by Assistant Marindin, may be classified as off-shore work. This was finished during the last fiscal year. It was described under "D. Special duty."
3. IN-SHORE.

a.

Eastern Division.

The work in Chesapeake Bay formed a large portion of the hydrography in the Eastern Division. The operations were confined principally to the localities of Magothy and Elk rivers, the vicinity of Havr~ de Grace, and the region around Baltimore and the Patapsco River. A hydrographic survey was made of Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, and a part of Charleston Har.bor, South Carolina. The steamer Blake, under command of Assistant Hodgkins, was detailed for work in Porto Rico, and passed the greater portion of the last half of the fiscal year doing hydrography on the southern shore of the island, and incidentally in the harbor of San Juan, on the northern shore. The hydrographic survey of Lake Maurepas was finished under the direction of Assistant French. Special work was done by Assistant Marindin on· the Brunswick outer bar, above mentioned, and also by Assistant Perkins in the passes leading to the inner

II.

SEA OPERATIONS.

harbor of the town of Brunswick. A resurvey of the Hudson River in the vicinity of New York was made, and a special investigation in Quicks Hole, Massachusetts, was made at the close of the season by the same party.
b. Middle Division.

An examination of the Aransas Pass, by the steamer Bache, under command of Assistant Welker, was made in January and February, 1899.
c. lFestern Division .

.The hydrographic work on the Pacific coast has been confined to four localities, namely, Grays Harbor, San Diego, San Pedro, and San Francisco. At the latter place work in the southern part of the bay was entirely finished in the month of January, and hydrography was taken up in San Pablo Bay. Some work was done in the location of buoys at the entrance of Mare Island Straits, at the request of the Commandant of the navy-yard, as well as the location of a new beacon at the mouth of the straits; and one in Petaluma Channel was located. Assistant Young, while in charge of ·the suboffice at Seattle, was detailed to make an examination of Bainbridge Reef, in Washington Sound.. This work was done in consequence of a rock being reported in the direct course of vessels of the Navy going from Admiralty Inlet to the Puget Sound Naval Station. The investigation showed that the report was unfounded, and that enough water exists on the reef to float the deepest draft vessel at low water.
d. Alaska.

The hydrographic operations in Alaska consisted in soundings and current observations at the Yukon River delta and at the mouth of the Copper River. In the former work, the water front at St. Michaels was developed, sounding lines were run from the pass between Stuart and St. Michaels Island to the Aproon Entrance, and a running hydrographic survey was made of the Kwikpak River to the head of the passes, and down the Kwiklok Entrance to its mouth. On the Copper River sufficient hydrography was executed to give all the information necessary for the entrance of ordinary sized vessels.
B. TIDAL.
I.

TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.

a. Eastenz Division.

During the year automatic tide gauges have been kept in operation at Fort Hamilton, N. Y.; Reedy Island, Delaware; Washington, D. C.; Morehead City, N. C.; Fernandina, Fla., and San Juan and Ponce, P. R. The gauge at Morehead City was discontinued on October 30, 1898. The series at Ponce extended from January 24 to April 25, 1899; while that at San Juan began February 5, and was continued to the close of the fiscal year. All the other stations extended throughout the year. Tidal indicators, showing automatically the state of the tide, as well as its direction of movement, were in operation throughout the year at Fort Hamilton, N. Y., and Reerly Island, Delaware. Early in July, 1898, the steamer Blake, under the personal command of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, was engaged in establishing' a series of tide gauges S. Doc. 454--5

66

COAST AN'D GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18¢-99.

throughout the entire length of Chesapeake Bay. This was done to determine the uniform plane of reference, by comparison with the plane at Fort Monroe. Observations were commenced in the middle of July and continued for one month. Frequent inspection of the stations was made by Assistant Yates, in command of the steamer Endeavor, to insure uniformity and reliability. The results have been found very satisfactory, the series through intermediate staffs checking very closely with the planes derived from extended observations in the 'Patapsco River and at the head of the bay. The establishment of well-determined tidal bench marks at intervals throughout the bay will enable the hydrographic parties to secure their planes of reference soon after reaching their working grounds, and will greatly facilitate the office work aboa~d ships. · Other tidal observations were made by hydrographic parties, in connection with the work in hand. · These operations will be mentioned in connection with the field work for which they were executed.
b. Westem Division.

At San Francisco, Seattle, and Bremerton, Wash., tide gauges are established. That at San Francisco has been in operation·for many years and furnishes a complete record for the past fiscal year. The one at Seattle was established on December 10, 1898, by Assistant Pratt, and its record extends to June 30, 1899. At Bremerton, Wash., the Commandant of the Puget Sound Naval Station has courteously furnished this office, each week, with a copy of the record of their self-registering tide gauge at that place.
c. Alaska.

Very good series of tidal observations were secured from the Alaska parties, both from Assistant Pratt, operating at the mouth of the Yukon, and Assistant Ritter at the Copper River delta. This information will be of great value in the Alaska predictions, and will furnish improved data for the construction of our new charts of the region
d. Hawaii.

For many years the tracings of the tide curve from the automatic tide gauge at Honolulu have been furnished by Prof. W. D. Alexander, surveyor-general. These have been continued during the past fiscal year, and add important data to that already accumulated in this Office, relating to the tides in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
2.

CURRENT OBSERVATIONS.

A careful study of the currents in Portsmouth Harbor was made by Assistant Welker, on the United States Coast Survey steamer Bache, during the months of September and October, 1898. Observations were made from the steamer and a launch anchored at selected stations. A weighted pole was used with a float attached, and a cord marked in distances, allowed to run out, gave the velocity by the length passing out in a stated period. The direction of the current was determined by sextant angles between the float and known signals. Assistant \Velker also pursued the same method in a study of the currents at Aransas Pass, Tex., during the period of his hydrographic and topographic work in that locality.

II.

SEA OPERATIONS.

C. COAST PILOT PARTY.

During this fiscal year no field work was done by the Coast Pilot party, both on account of the diminished number of officers employed, and also on account of the. accumulation of the office work. The time of the party was fully occupied in reducing observations and preparing bulletins for publication.
D. SPECIAL DUTY.
1.

BRUNSWICK BAR.

The special duty at the Brunswick bar has already been referred to in the off-shore hydrographic work. This work was carried out in pursuance of an act of Congress authorizing the work to be done by an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, under the direct personal supervision of the Secretary of War. The survey was for the purpose of ascertaining whether the contractor for the improvement of the channel over the bar had secured the depths and widths claimed. These dimensions were: 24 feet depth at average high tide, with 200 feet width; and ~s feet depth, with 100 feet width. The bar is s miles offshort. Its exposed position, the unusually strong tidal currents, and the required accuracy of the survey all conspired to prolong the work, which lasted from November, 1898, to April, 1899. The expense of making the measurements was therefore considerable, but was fully justified by the important interests involved. The extreme refinement of the ·observations, which materially increased the field work, was also warranted by the large pecuniary consideration at stake. The funds for party expenses were furnished ·by the War Department. The instruments were provided and the officers' salaries were paid by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
2.

STEAMER PATHFINDER.

Just before the close of the last fiscal year a contract was made for the construction of a single-screw steel vessel for service in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. The speed of this vessel was to be not less than I 2 knots per hour under natural draft, and the cost was to be $150 ooo. On the 17th of March, 1899, a trial trip was made under the supervision of a board appointed by the Honorable the Secretary of the Treasury, and consisting of two Coast and Geodetic Survey officers, two officers of the Revenue-Marine Service, and a United States local inspector of boilers. The report of this board established the fact that the vessel fully complied with the requirements of the contract, and she was duly accepted. Besides having a speed of more than I 2 knots per hour under natural draft, tests were made under forced draft, which demonstrated her ability to run easily· more than 13. knots per hour, and maintain it indefinitely. As above intimated, the Pathfinder is built entirely of steel and is of exceptional strength. She has 3 decks, 7 water-tight transverse bulkheads, and 15 water-tight compartments. Her length over all is 196 feet, with a breadth of beam of 36 feet 6 inches. The gross tonnage is 690, and the displacement on a mean draft of 10 feet is 875 tons. She is brigantine rigged, with a sail area of 4 478 square feet. Her engines are vertical triple-expansion, with 28-inch stroke. The bunkers have a capacity for 240 tons of coal, sufficient to give a steaming radius of about 5 ooo miles.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

1893-99.

This vessel, being intended for service on the Pacific coast, left Newport News 011 the 16th of June, 1899, and arrived at San Francisco on the i8th of September, having made a comparatively short trip, and having demonstrated good qualities as a seaworthy vessel. For a detailed description of the Patlifi,nder, the trial trip, and her voyage to San Francisco, as well as general information regarding the entire Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet, see Appendix No. 2, p. - - .
3. COMPASS RANGES.

In the beginning of January, 1899, Assistant Westdahl, then in command of the steamer Gedney, doing hydrography and topography in San Diego Bay, was directed to determine certain objects to be used as compass ranges. In carrying out these instntctions he determined by triangulation 8 points and established 30 or more ranges for the determination of the compass errors.

DETAILS OF OFFICE WORK.
INTRODUCTION. In the present paper it is proposed to state somewhat more in detail than was possible in the Superintendent's Report the operations of the Office. The divisions will he treated consecutively and in the order given in the synopsis at the first part of the Superintendent's.Report. The plan of making an appendix of this material arose from the fact that the publication of the separate reports from the different divisions, and signed by the chiefs thereof, has been discontinued. In order that the details of the office work may be made a matter of record, as it is proposed to do with the field work, a continuous statement, embracing all the di.visions, has been drawn up, and is as follows:

ADMINISTRATION.

A. SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE.

The details of the duties in the Office of the Superintendent are largely of a routine nature, a full statement of which would be devoid of interest, and would, moreover, be of little permanent value. Beyond the statement made in the preceding pages of the Report the following information may be given: From the beginning of the fiscal year until April 18 the personnel of the Office was as follows:
Dr. Henry S. Pritchett. ................................. Superintendent. Mr. E. D. Preston ...................................... Executive officer. Mr. W. B. Chilton ...................................... Clerk. Mr. W. H. Emery ..................................... Stenographer and typewriter.

On April 19 a partial reorganization of this Office, as well as that of the Assistant in Charge, took place. Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, who had acted as Assistant in Charge of Office and Topography, was assigned to duty in the Office of the Superintendent, under the title of Assistant Superintendent; Mr. E. D. Preston was made editor of publications and chairman of the publication committee, and Mr. A. Braid was given charge of the Office, under the designation of Assistant in Charge. · Mr. D. B. Wainwright was detailed for duty in the Office of the Superintendent as assistant to Mr. 0. H. Tittmann. These assignments held throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.

·----'-----The work of this division during the year has been of a routine nature, with little change from the lines followed during the previous fiscal year. Special duty was performed in connection with the Massachusetts State Survey. Mr. J. B. Tolley of that service was assigned a desk in the Computing Division, and was assisted with advice while making the adjustment of the State work of the preceding season.

Early in May a new division of the office was established, for the investigation of terrestrial magnetism. This was placed in charge of Dr. L. A. Bauer, and on June r, 1899, all manuscript matter, records, computations, and charts heretofore kept in the Computing Division were turned over to him. All duties relating to .the subject of terrestrial magnetism will be performed in the new division from this date onward. Besides the routine matters incident to the work of the Computing Division, time has been devoted to the computations of the transcontinental triangulation, and incidentally to the measure of the arc on the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude. A report on this great work has been submitted, and consists of 7 parts. Much information, both magnetic and astronomic, has been collected in relation to the islands acquired through the recent war. The revisi<?n of star places has been taken up and carried on as fast as circumstances would permit. At the same time abstracts of latitudes were made and miscellaneous work of a similar nature done. The collection of geodetic data and other information called for by field parties has taken up 'much time during the year. Geographic registers containing the results of triangulation have been prepared, and the duplicate geodetic, astronomic, and magnetic records were duly scrutinized and filed away. The traverse line across the peninsula of Florida, the observations of which were made in 1897-98, has been computed; the same computer assisting in checking conditional equations and revising the triangulation computations of the transcontinental triangulation. The adjustment of the primary triangulation on the thirty-ninth parallel, already alluded to, fonned a very laborious part of the computations in this line. Mention has already been made of the rapid solution of 99 normal equations, the same having been effected by Mr. Doolittle in twenty-four working days. The service of the same computer was utilized in the computation of other triangulation sides in the· great arc west of Salina Base and extending to Point Arena, California. The heights of primary stations in eastern Colorado, and thence across the Rocky Mountains to California, have been adjusted, and abstracts of vertical measures in California, made in 1898, have been made. The geographic positions of the principal arc stations from Hays, Kans., to the Pacific coast, both for the Clarke and the Bessel spheroids, and from Hays to the Atlantic coast for the latter spheroid, have been prepared. In addition to this, abstracts of horizontal and vertical measures of the primary triangulation in Alabama have been made, and the triangulation of the oblique arc from Montgomery to the Gulf coast has been adjusted. The computation of the telegraphic longitude of Green River and Oasis, Utah; the azimuth of Bronson, Fla., and the chron01netric longitudes of three stations in the Yukon Delta, Alaska, have been completed. Spirit-level observations between Salina, Kans., and Hugo, Colo., and the geodetic connection of astronomic stations with the primary triangulation of the thirty-ninth parallel in Nevada and California have been brought to completion. Other work of similar nature was carried out in connection with the hypsometric results of the primary stations in the Rocky Mountains, and in the various magnetic observations in West Virginia. A number of astronomic latitudes were computed under th.e direction of Mr. Hayford, and these include Marysville and Presidio, Cal.; Oasis and Green River, Utah, and three stations in the Yukon Delta,· Alaska. The l~titude computation of Umi.laska has also been nearly completed.

Besides the foregoing, several computers were engaged at intervals in supplying copies of data called for in connection with Office correspondence, and the adjustment of the reconuoissance triangulation in southeastern Alaska, in order to conn~t the same with astronomic stations in that locality, was pursued. Miscellaneous work was done by officers temporarily attached to the division, as follows: geodetic positions, magnetic, and star-place computations; computation of length of speed trial line for the Navy, and the computation of two azimuth stations in Alabama. To the above may also be added the computation of the supplementary triangulation on Chesapeake Bay, and the check computation of spirit levels in Colorado.

The annual volume of Tide Tables for the year 1900 was prepared as usual. While this volume is essentially similar to those of preceding years, it includes for the first time the predicted tides for St. Michael, Alaska, during the season of navigation, with tables of the times of slack current for each day of the year at Seymour Narrows, Discovery Passage, British Columbia, and at Sergius Narrows, Peril Strait, Alaska. Similar data for these three stations were also prepared for a portion of the year 1899, and issued as bulletins, it being too late to include them in the Tide Tables for that year. As this is the first time the Survey has issued full predictions of the times. of slack current, a brief statement of the method of making the predictions will not be out of place. The observations, furnished by the party of Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore, U.S.N., commanding the steamer Patterson, consisted of the times of the beginning and ending of slack waters for about six months, as mentioned in my report for 1898. The observed times of middle slack water were tabulated, and the !uni-current intervals computed, using only the upper transits of the moon. These intervals were plotted, to smooth out irregularities and interpolate short breaks in the series. A double argument table, using the time of the year and the exact hours of the moon's upper transit as arguments, was then formed. In order to extend this table to the portion of the year not covered by the observations, advantage was taken of the fact that in a period of 192 days there are approximately 6 0 synodic months, 7 tropical, and 7 auomalistic months. The use of 60 synodic months causes the time of the moon's upper transit to differ approximately by 12 hours at intervals of 192 days. In this period there is a practical recurrence of the phase, declinational, and parallax effects. To avoid the labor of interpolation in using the computed table, it was plotted so that the curves gave direct readings at any time desired.

DETAILS OF OFFICE WORK.

The series of current observations, made by Lieut. E. H. Tillman, U.S.N., at two stations in Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, and one station occupied by Assistant R. L. Faris in the same vicinity, were subjected to harmonic analysis. The observed directions and velocities of the current for each hour were resolved into directions and velocities along north and. south and east and west lines, thus dividing each series into two parts, each of which was analyzed separately. Only four components, M2 , S 2 , K 1 , and O" were obtained, because the velocity of the current at these stations is too slight to warrant putting more work upon it. These are the only cases of the application of the principles of the harmonic analysis to current observations that this Survey has accomplished. The plane of mean low water has been determin.ed for about 40 stations in Chesa- · peake Bay, Maryland and Virginia, from simultaneous tidal observations. At r 3 stations distributed along the bay a month of day-and-night hourly heights of the sea were obtained simultaneously, and intermediate stations were occupied from a few days to a few weeks each. The tide is usually small in this bay, being about 2 Yz feet at the entrance, diminishing to less than a foot in the middle, and increasing again to about 2 feet at the head of the bay. The surface is affected very much by winds, which often causes a variation of 3 fee,J: in the mean level. The series of tides observed by the party of Assistant H. P. Ritter, in the Copper River Delta, Alaska, were found to contain a most interesting type of tide, in which the upper portion of the tide wave is normal and the lower part is very nearly a straight line. No soundings were available at the time of making the reductions, but it is very probable that the outside reef prevents the water from falling below a certain level, at which it remains dammed up until the rising tide overflows the barrier. The series of tides observed by the party of Assistant J. F. Pratt, in the Yukon River Delta, Alaska, showed a rapid transition from an almost strictly diurnal tide at St. Michael to a well-marked semidiurnal tide at the Kusilvak Entrance to the Yukon. Harmonic analyses were completed for quite a number of short series of from one to two months each of hourly ordinates, the total work being equivalent to the complete analysis of two years of continuous record. The nonharmonic reductions completed during the year consist of 64 series, the equivalent of about ten years of continuous records of high and low waters. Dr. R. A. Harris has continued his work upon the Manual of Tides, referred to in my last year's report. Part IV, now in progress, relates to tidal theory. Considerable progress has been made in the study of the tidal oscillations in the great oceanic basins. So far as this work has progressed, it goes to show that the dominant tides of most localities owe their origin to one of two methods of generation. The first is that implied in the corrected equilibrium theory, and pertains to rather small and well-illclosed bodies of water; the second, and far more important method, is that implied in stationary oscillations, whose free periods approximately coincide with the periods of the tidal forces. In either case the tidal forces are required for various latitudes. Accordingly, diagrams for each ro degrees of latitude have been constructed, showing their magnitude and direction for a semidiurnal or a diurnal component at each component hour. These diagrams may also be made to represent cotidal lines radiating from the no-tide point of a small and deep lake or sea. Suppose we assume a uniform canal half-a-wave length long, or one of several half-

108

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<J9.

wave lengths. This canal is supposed to follow any prescribed course, and generally to extend through various latitudes. Let the force diagrams be scattered along this canal. By this arrangement it is easy to see, at any given instant, what are the tidal forces resolved along the canal. A numerical value proportional to the virtual work imparted to the oscillating system by the forces by which the oscillation is sustained can now be found for any given time. With several such values in hand, the time of high or low water with reference to the tidal body is easily ascertained. In oceans wher~ tides of considerable magnitude are generated we are now to imagine ''oscillating areas'' resembling somewhat the canal just mentioned. But many difficulties arise in practice. For example, the want of tolerably complete lateral boundaries, and the necessity of simultaneously considering the movements in intersecting or adjacent areas, because their motions are not independent and so are not capable of easy superposition. The "oscillating areas" may thus come to have shapes much less simple than the one first considered. For this reason laboratory experimentation upon moderately long stationary waves under numerous conditions has been undertaken, although upon a rather·limited scale. The results, however, are in several respects satisfactory, for they assist in deciding whether or not a prop6sed movement is possible in nature, and they are also suggestive in various ways. The apparatus used consists of simply a rectangular tank, with means for partitioning off in it areas of almost any required shape. This is mounted upon a table capable of some yielding, so that the forces impressed upon it may set up oscillations in the liquid. The coast of America, from New Foundland to Florida, constitutes one end of an ''oscillating area,'' to which the tides of the Atlantic coast of the United States are due. This area resembles in many respects a broad canal, whose axis extends from New York southeasterly, one wave length, to a point west of South Africa; thence south, following nearly the meridian of Greenwich, half-a-wave length, to the Antarctic Continent. Considering this area by itself for simplicity's sake, it will be found that the Greenwich cotidal hour for our Atlantic coast and for the western coast of southern Africa should not be far from 12 or o; while for the region extending from Brazil to Cape Verde Islands and for the Antarctic Continent, in the longitude of Greenwich, the cotidal hour should not be far from 6. As observations in the last-named locality are entirely wanting for proving or disproving this hypothesis, it seems that attention of Antarctic explorers should be called to the desirability of observing tides for a day or more at as many places as possible along the Antarctic Continent. The nodal line, ·one-fourth-wave length from our coast, extends from the Lesser Antilles northeasterly. This explains why it is that the semidiurnal tide in the Caribbean Sea and·the Gulf of Mexico is so very small as compared with the tide along the outer or northern coast of Cuba and Haiti. Porto Rico lies west of this line of no tides and so the tide on its northern or outer coast ought to be nearly simultaneous with that of northern Cuba and eastern United States, although the range should be much reduced because of the proximity of the nodal line. The nodal line, three-fourths-wave length from our coast, should cross the axis of the area not far from Ascension Island. Hence the smallness of the tides upon that island. The other "oscillating areas" of the Atlantic Ocean, and those of the Indian Ocean, seem to present no insurmountable difficulties and to give results fairly consistent

with observation. The tides in the Arctic are derived from those of the North Atlantic and so require no special consideration. On account of the broad expanse of the waters of the Pacific, and the partial barriers formed by islands and submer.ged plateaus, the tides of this ocean are by far more difficult than those of any other known body of water. Then, too, observations are as yet quite insufficient for deciding many important questions. The case, however, is not hopeless, and great efforts should be made for obtaining observat1ons at as many foreign stations as possible. So far we have had reference mainly to the semidiurnal tide. Somewhat similar statements are in a measure true for the diurnal portion. There seems to be one oceanic region where the corrected equilibrium theory may possibly apply to the diurnal components; this is the western portion of the North Atlantic Ocean. The hypothesis just mentioned accords tolerably well with the fact that the diurnal tides in the Gulf of Mexico are about thirteen or fourteen hours later than the diurnal tides east of Georgia and northern Florida. The time required for a free wave to travel from the Lesser Antilles, where the diurnal tide must enter, to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, is probably about ten hours. The ratio of the masses of the moon and the sun, if derived from K,, 0,, and P, of this region of the ocean, is fairly correct, as should be the case on the above supposition. But it is probable that this ratio can be best determined from observations made upon such inland bodies of water as Lake Superior and the Black Sea.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

The work accomplished in each section of this division has been entirely satisfactory, and, considering the force employed, the output has been very large. The continued use of the engraved plate notes, compasses, etc., has facilitated the work in the drawing section, and the adoption of the standard c}:lart on prepared mellowed paper, upon which .all corrections are made, enables the engravers to make the corrections and tracings direct from the proof without making adjustmel)ts for shrinkage and expansion. the charts being true to scale. We have now in the drawing section standards from nearly all the plates printed from copper, which are obtained and filed as evidences of corrections applied. Whenever it is necessary to apply corrections to a location previously corrected on the standard proof, a new standard proof is obtained and the old one filed away. In this manner these standards become the best possible record of corrections applied to plates, as on each one is entered not only the corrections themselves, but also the authorities for the data shown and the date applied to the plate. With all these improved facilities, however, the drawing section is far in arrears, and the force should be increased at the earliest possible date. The draftsmen have done excellent work and a large amount of it, but the increased quantity of work required is beyond the ability of the present force. The output of charts in the printing section has not been as large as that of last year, which was increased by the war demand, but still we have met all demands and to a large extent controlled the back orders. With the printing of charts controlled by this division, as it now is, it is confidently believed that in the future all back orders can be eliminated, save where the corrections are of such extent as to require new plates. A larger number of plates, both altos and bassos, have been made in the electrotyping section for the past year than for a number of years past. This has been occasioned by the efforts of this division to replace old and worn-out plates with new bassos, to say nothing of the new charts completed during the year. The introduction in·the photograph rooms of the Van Dyke black and white paper has enabled us to preserve negatives of all small tracings made for the United States Engineer Corps or the public, whereby we are able to reproduce these drawings as well as from the original tracings. Van Dyke negatives are presen ed of all progress sketches and duplicate copies can be furnished at any ~ime with little cost or trouble and in any quantity. During the year 264 calls for information were made upon the division, involving areas, shore lines, distances between various points, tracings from both original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, construction of special maps for use of the President, negatives, blue prints, etc., involving a vast amount of work in addition to the regular work of the division. Copies of all this information, in the shape of blue prints and negatives of all tracings made or copied, and letterpress copies of other data and information furnished, is on file in this division. The duties of the chief draftsman have been largely those of supervision. Maps and material were supplied for the war room of the White House; methods of drawing were inspected in various Departments; proofs were verified, and information prepared for the public; Considerable time was given to the examination of drawings of applicants for positions as draftsmen and making estimates on work for outside parties. The work of the drawing division has been so extensive that it is neither necessary

nor desirable to give a detailed account of all the pieces of work taken up and finished. A general idea of the activity of the force, as well as the wide geographical limits comprised in the preparation of charts, may be seen from the following statement of drawings, which have been classified for the sake of ready reference: In the Eastern Division work was done on New Bedford Harbor, Buzzards Bay, Baltimore Harbor, Fernandina and Jacksonville, Gunpowder River, Boston Bay, and approaches. In the Middle Division: At Brazos River, Texas; triangulation of Salt Lake City; tracing of Galveston Bay, Texas. In the Western Division: A Mercators chart of California; San Francisco Bay Entrance; Grays Harbor, Washington. In Alaska: White Water Bay; Dixon Entrance to head of Lynn Canal; San Juan de Fuca to Dixon Entrance; Dixon Entrance to Cape St. Elias; Assistant Pratt's work on the Yukon Delta; Red Fish Bay, southeastern Alaska; Sitka Bay; Sitka Sound to Salisbury Sound; Salisbury Sound to Peril Strait; drawing for Cordova Bay and Yukon River; indexing topographic sheet of St. George Island; Cape Dyer to St. Michael; Yukon River maps, from the delta inland to the Porcupine River-ro maps in all. The following miscellaneous drawings were also finished: San Juan, P. R., Hawaiian Islands, Guam Island, Ladrone Islands, new chart of Philippine Islands, and projections for field parties. The following drawings have been completed for photolithographing or engraving during the year : ·

In the comparison of 1899 with the preceding years 1898 is omitted, the demand for charts in that year having been abnormal on account of the gold discoveries in Alaska and vicinity and of the war with Spain. The total issue is 50 per cent larger than the average. The free distribution is 75 per cent larger than the average. The net sales (gross sales less copies returned by sale agents) have increased in copies 32 per cent, and in value 30 per cent, as compared with the average.

The increase in free distribution is due partly to the greater demand for naval use, corresponding to the increase in the number of Vt!ssels. The number of charts sold is slightly in excess of that of 1898. The edition of the Chart Catalogue for 1899 was received in May, and 1 059 copies have been distributed. On January 1, 1899, the entire business with the agencies for the sale of charts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables was transferred to this division, where a part of it had previously been conducted. The result of the change has so far been satisfactory. The statistics for the six months are as follows:

In April there were sent to each of eleven post-offices on the Atlantic coast a chart of the vicinity, framed, for wall display. In March, April, and May there were sent to a numl?er of postmasters in coast towns a circular with a view to the establishment of new sales agencies, in consequence of which 35 have been added to our list, to whom 242 charts have since been issued. These .agencies are mostly in places of minor importance, and the direct result of sales may not be great at first, yet the indirect benefit to the public should be considerable, in the spread of information as to the scope and character of our chart work. There ha\re been delivered to this section for issue 19 new charts and maps, 17 printed by lithography and 2 from copperplate, ·viz:

DETAILS OF OFFICE WORK.

IIJ

This division, consisting of the office, instrument shop, and carpenter shop, attends to the accounting for all instruments and general property, whether in the field, on the various vessels, in storage, or at the Office, and the necessary correspondence arising therefrom; to the repairing and putting in thorough working order of all instruments before being issued; to the designing and construction of new instruments and apparatus; to the experimental work, trials, etc., arising from proposed applications of new discoveries, etc., to the purposes of the Survey; to the determination of instrumental constants, as far a~ practicable, at the Office; to the selection and purchase of new instruments and material, and to the repair of office furniture and minor repairs of the office buildings. The aim of the division, as heretofore, has been to devote its energies to keeping in repair and working order the instruments owned by the Survey, and to engage in new work only when special designs, experiments, etc., required by the specific and peculiar needs of the Survey, make purchase in the open market impossible.

The two IO-horsepower gas engines furnishing power for the instrument and carpenter shops, the elevator, hydraulic press, and the printing presses; also the pneumatic time system, the call-bell circuits, and a 1·5 kilowatt dynamo, were attended to and kept in good running order by the employees of the Instrument Division. Minor repairs to the office buildings and furniture, including the putting in place and removal of awnings, storm windows, etc., were attended to as usual, the work chargeable to the buildings occupying twenty-four days, and to the furniture thirtyeight days' labor of skilled workmen. By direction of the Superintendent, a number of the principal charts, maps, and other publications of the Survey, and such instruments as illustrate most readily the means employed in their production, together with some standards of length, mass, and volume, from the Office of Weights and Measures, were organized into an exhibit at the Central High School building in this city during the meeting of the National Educational Association in July, 1898. An inventory of all the property of the Survey in the keeping of the Instrument Division, begun in the last fiscal year, was completed in July and reported upon. '!'he opening of a new set of books for the office and field accounts of instruments, and also one to account for expenditures in storage of property, involved considerable clerical labor beyond the usual amount. The Office of Weights and Measures having made preparations to compare and standardize electrical testing apparatus, the demands upon the Instrument Division for

II8

skilled labor of high order were much increased. The standardizing, or marking, of zoo<c water bottles, and the testing and correcting of 200'""' sugar tubes used in the United States customs revenue service, is also attended to by employees of this division. All instruments and articles of general property found on examination to be worn out, or no longer useful for other reasons, were condemned and sold at public auction. The sale of this property realized $1 382 ·99. Demand being made upon the Instrument Division for the design of a geodetic level as far as possible free from changes due to temperature variation, communication was had with Prof. Ch. Ed. Guillaume, of Paris, with the view of procuring for the construction of such instruments a quantity of his nickel-steel alloy with low temperature coefficient. Finding that he could not furnish such an alloy suitable for casting, experiments were made, whose outcome was an alloy which can readily be cast into required shapes and has a temperature coefficient of 0·000004 per degree centigrade; that of steel being 0·00001 I, and of brass 0·000018. Geodetic levels Nos. I, 5, and 6 were remodeled and provided with new telescopes and stride levels of this new metal. They are now in use, and it is expected that results will show a large reduction, or practically an elimination of certain discrepancies ascribed to want of constancy of the older instruments under the temperature conditions prevailing in the field. In the designs for remodeling these instruments provision was made to enable the observer to read the level and rod practically at the same time, thus avoiding change of position of instrument d'-'e to shifting of the observer's weight on the ground, and also parallax in reading the scale on the level vial. This is accomplished by an arrangement, consisting of a mirror, two prisms, and a lens, which projects the images of the ends of the bubble and the scale of the level into one eye, while the other is in position to observe the rod through the telescope. Four new geodetic level rods, designated as R, S, T, and U, were made and completed in time to be issued with these levels. The cross section of these is the same as that of rods P and Q. As in the case of rods P and Q, the new rods were treated with paraffin to protect them against hygrometric influences; but, while the weights of the former were increased by almost go per cent, the treatment of the new ones was modified so as to increase their weights by only about 17 per cent. One of the three new 12-inch position theodolites for primary triangulation, begun in the last fiscal year (No. 145), was completed and issued to the field at the beginning of the season. The other two, Nos. 167 and 168, are approaching completion. It is regretted that but little progress could be made in the construction of the new tide-predicting machine during the year, the amount and urgency of other work, together with the loss of over thirteen months of time by the temporary and permanent transfer of two instrument makers, allowing but thirty-six days to be assigned to that work.

·---- -···-·--·--

The work of the year in the Library and Archives Division may be summarized briefly as follows:
1.

SUMMARY.

The entire library ( 1 s ooo volumes) has been labeled and classified according to the decimal system, as used in several hundred libraries of the country. The shelving was thoroughly cleaned. In order to provide shelf room for increase on the ground floor certain classes of infrequently used books were sent to the second floor. The rear archives room was refitted with shelving, and the entire series of original computations and observations, except tides, soundings, and currents, comprising about 10 ooo pieces, were assembled in one room, labeled, classified, and shelf labeled. The tube racks were extended, necessitating the handling of s ooo tubes containing original sheets. All of the miscellaneous maps were classified in portfolios and placed on the ground floor of the library, where they are convenient for frequent reference. The Coast and Geodetic Survey, Hydrographic Office, and Admiralty charts were revised and placed in strict numerical order. All other charts were arranged according to the Cutter geographical system, as used throughout the library and archives. The photo negatives, prints, and lantern slides were labeled, classified, and indexed. All of the sea-bottom specimens were unboxed and arranged in the new specimen cases by localities, according to the uniform geographical classification. The correspondence files of the Superintendent, Assistant in Charge, etc., were removed from the fourth floor fo the shelving provi~ed for the purpose on the third floor and chronologically arranged. Shelving was erected on the fourth floor for the duplicates and for overflow from the library of unused books. Four hundred and fifty-five volumes of books, serials, and original archives were prepared for the bindery, of which 96 were arranged by Mr. Courtenay, of the Computing Division. The working force and outfit were moved into the front office, which was prepared for occupancy, and the book alcoves were fitted up for the undisturbed use of readers.

SHELF ARRANGEMENT.

For a number of reasons the revision of the shelf arrangement of the library and archives was found imperative. By the "fixed-shelf" system accessions to the library could not be placed in their proper place in the classification whenever the shelves were already full. Henc~ the relative system originally used, the Dewey decimal, was readopted. As a matter of convenience it was found desirable to have the miscellaneous maps and atlases on. the ground floor, where they would be of easy access. 'l'he maps and atlases, therefore, have been brought down from the top floor, placed in portfolios, and classified according to a printed geographical scheme (the Cutter Local List). The purpose in reshelving the archives, scattered through the three rooms on the ground floor, was to assemble them together in a manner facilitating reference and handling, and also to gain much-needed room. As a result of these changes there are two quiet places for readers, a front reading room, where the current periodicals and the most used reference works can be consulted, and the rear alcoves, with tables and writing materials, where free access can be had directly to the books. There is an open shelf arrangement of the archives in one separate room, with shelving for several years' growth; there is a new library office, more accessible to the main building and to the street, together with closet room in the hallway for photographs and library paraphernalia; and, last but not least, all of the most used books, atlases, maps, and archives, by a process of selection, have been conveniently grouped on the ground floor. The changes in shelf arrangements on the upper floors were made with reference to the requirements on the ground floor and to provide much-needed additional shel~ room. The hallways of the two upper floors have been fitted up with the old shelving removed from the ground floor. This affords accommodations on the third floor for the correspondence of the Assistant in Charge and the Superintendent and on the fourth floor for duplicate and overflow books from the library and for the miscellaneous files of the Disbursing Office.
3. ACCESSIONS.

Every new piece received in the library is entered chronologically in an accession book. Five accession books are regularly kept up, namely, for the library, the archives, the original sheets, the maps and charts, the photographs and lantern slides. Every piece in the division has been or will be recorded in an accession book and individually numbered. Of old material only some maps and charts and miscellaneous pamphlets still remain unrecorded in this way. A list of the accessions for the year follows.

4. CATALOGUING.

Indexing old and new material will be the main occupation of this Division for some years to come. This year a rough index was prepared of the photographs and lantern slides, and the new maps, books, pamphlets, and serials were regularly indexed, as received. Indexing the archives has gone forward haltingly. At the beginning of the fiscal year the current indexing was several years in arrears. Unfortunately the

necessary assignments of the cataloguer for work outside of the Division had to be made, leaving the back work, as well as the current cataloguing, still to do. Everything is now in readiness to move vigorously as soon as a writer is detailed to take up this important work. The revision of the old card catalogue of the books and of the maps and charts is progressing slowly, current work demanding the firl>t attention.
5. BINDING.

, The books sent to the bindery were chiefly unbound periodicals. Little binding of this class had been done for several years. A large number of im:omplete serials have been made ready and will be sent to the bindery as soon as the missing title pages and indexes can be obtained. Several hundred books and periodicals remain to be prepared. This work must necessarily be done at odd intervals. The arrangement of computations and observations requires expert assistance, and is usually performed by divisions of the Office or by such Assistants from the field force as can be detailed from time to time to make it up. Temporary covers have been used to cover the unbound computations, but this is merely an expedient for the time being to protect the records until they are permanently bound. About ro ooo pieces are awaiting permanent bindings; Nothing whatever has been done toward binding the tide and sounding books.
6. REFERENCE WORKS.

Looking up iter.1s of information desired occupies no small amount of time, but is one of the most valuable ways in which the Division can be employed. The contents of the sets of serials are now much more accessible since the Poole and the German and French indexes to periodical literature are in use. Constant lookout is kept for new bibliographies and indexes in the special fields occupied by the Survey.
7. APPROPRIATION.

The $600 allotted for the purchase of books is inadequate to keep the library up to the standard of coordinate Government scientific bureaus. One-third of this appropriation is required for periodicals. The allotments made by other scientific bureaus range from $2 ooo to $10 ooo, and their increase yearly of purchased books is from twice to ten times the number obtained by this Survey. Scientific books are traditionally expensive. A working library only, consisting of such books as are constantly used from day to day in the field or Office, would not make a large library necessary. The present situation, however, seems to require that a more comprehensive library, exhaustive in the specialties of the Survey's work, should be maintained, and that the field and marine force should be kept more thoroughly informed as to the progress in these specialties, even to the extent of establishing for their benefit a circulating library of new books and periodicals. Other libraries in Washington will not, to any extent, enter the particular fields of geodesy, hydrography, topography, cartography, astronomy, mathematics, and instrumental sciences that fall within the range of the Surv~y's operations. An allotment of $2 ooo is not a large appropriation to maintain the library up to the standard along these lines.

On the assumption of editorial duties by the present incumbent, on April 19, 1899, the report for the fiscal year 1897-98 was in hand. A number of changes were made at this time in the general form and arrangement of the volume, which involved considerable rewriting. The illustrations were, moreover, modified so as to reduce nearly all of them to full-page or double-page cuts. Nothing larger was admitted except three sheets of general progress, which were given place in a pocket attached to .the cover of the Repurt. The size of the printed page was changed, in the interest of legibility, and numerous modifications were introduced in the binding. The increased duties consequent upon the aforesaid changes considerably retarded the transmission of the Report to the Public Printer, so that it was not until September 1 that delivery was made in its finally accepted form. The editor acknowledges his indebtedness to Mr. A. F. Belitz, stenographer and typewriter, who has given valuable assistance throughout the preparation of the Report. IV. WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

1898-99.

DETAILS OF FIELD WORK.
INTRODUCTION. .

The details of the field operations are here given in somewhat different order of treatment from that followed in the Superintendent's Report. In order to describe the work of each party as a unit, the entire scope of activity is classified in·geographical order, and the operations are given consecutive numbers based on position purely. The occupation of each party is then given in detail, including all classes of work carried on during the season in the locality under consideration. This method enables the reader to note in a continuous narrative the progress made in local surveys. The paper opens with a tabular statement T~ble (I) of the different parties, showing the locality, character of work, and the officers under whose direction the operations were performed. · The classification is geographic and deals with the material in five divisions, namely, Eastern, Middle, Western, Alaska, and Special Duty. A page column indicates where the work is described in detail. Following this is an index Table (II) in which the work is classified according to the synopsis in the Report proper. The number of operation_is indicated, which enables the .reader to at once refer to all the localities in which any particular class of work was done. A column is added giving the page. An alphabetical index Table (III) of the officers in charge and those attached to parties is added, making it possible to find readily all the work executed by each officer, whatever may have been the locality. Then appears the detailed statement (IV), arranged also in geographical order. For convenience of reference the name of the chief of party, the class of work, the locality, and a short table of statistics, are given for each operation. A description of the fleet of the Coast and Geodetic Survey now follows, in which the general statistics are given in tabular form, as well as other information of interest on the subject. The trial trip of the Pat!t.jinder is alluded to, as \Vell as her voyage from Washington to San Francisco. A full description of this vessel by her first commander, Capt. John Ross, also appears. · Finally a brief note of the tidal work at all stations during the year is added. S. Doc. 454--9 129

From the beginning of the fiscal year until the 19th of August Assistant P. A. Welker was engaged in directing the repairs of the steamer Bache, at Baltimore, and organizing a party for <;:ombined operations at Portsmouth, N. H. Sailing on the 20th of August, he arrived on the 26th, having had three days' delay at Edgartown, Mass., on account of bad weather. Points for the execution of the hydrographic and topographic work proposed were furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, but as they were mostly determined by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., between 1840 and 1844, together with a few from the Borden Survey of Massachusetts, and the Coast Survey, equally as old, very few of them could be recovered. For outside hydrography only three points were available. The Isle of Shoals light-house was determined by Borden, but it was not connected for distance or azimuth with any other point. The other points determined were Pulpit Rock and \Vhales Back light-house. With this scanty supply and the uncertaiuty which attached to the positions found, a triangulation was necessary. Many stations were occupied in efforts to reproduce a given triangle, which were subsequently abandoned on account of the angles not corresponding with those given. Finally the points White Island and Southeast Base were recovered, and these, with Wood Island, were

occupied, and furnished a triangle on which subsequent work was based. The resulting lines were checked. by azimuths, and the geographicat positions were verified sufficient to make sure that the points employed were absolutely identical with those of the older surveys. The topographic work was in charge of Mr. Charles Deetz, who was temporarily detailed from the Drawing and Engraving Division of the Office. OperatioDs began on September 1, the method employed being that of the plane table. The work was controlled by points and directions determined by triangulation. By September 12, sufficient shore line and enough points had been. located by triangulation and by plane table to commence hydrographic work. The general system of this part of the scheme was rectangular, the lines of sounding being from 25 to ,100 meters apa_rt. Over shoals and sunken rocks, in order to bring out the character of the obstructions, closer lines were run. The inside hydrography, by J. L. Dunn, chief yoeman, U.S. N., was executed in the whaleboat. On account of the strong currents prevalent this work was exceedingly difficult. In certain localities sounding was impossible except at slack \Vater. The outside hydrography was executed by the steamer Bac/ze whenever the weather was favorable, and the steam launch was brought into requisition for developing the shoals and sunken rocks before referred to. At least one-half of the time was lost 011 account of stormy weather, and the work was necessarily left unfinished on account of lack of time. A tide station was established at Fort Constitution, and the mean low-water readings were referred to a bench mark of the United States Engineers. The plane of reference was established by observations night and day during two lunar months. A careful study was also made of the currents in the harbor, both in velocity and direction, by observations from the steamer and a launch anchored at selected stations. Work was closed at the end of October, and on November I the party started for Washington. A stop was made between the 3d and 12th, in New York, in order to obtain supplies and outfit. On reaching Fortress Monroe, on the 13th, Assistant Welker recei\'ed instructions to proceed to Baltimore for repairs. These having been completed by the 18th, the party started for Aransas Pas.<;, Texas, arriving on January 15, after having been delayed by stormy weather. Assistant \Velker speaks in high terms of the services rendered in the work by Assistant Will \Varel Duffield, temporarily detached from the Office in \Vashington, and also by Messrs. Deetz and Dunn. The result of the work was one hydrographic sheet, on a scale of 1 :zo ooo, of the ·approaches to Portsmouth; one hydrographic sheet of the harbor, on a scale of 1:10 ooo; and one topographic sheet of the harbor and approaches, on a scale of 1: IO ooo. The topographic sheet was finished, but both the hydrographic ones require more work to bring them to completion. S. Doc. 454--10

1 base line measured. Triangulation, hydrography, and topography from Ponce to Point Viento.

On the 1st of July, 1898, Assistant \V. C.· Hodgkins was in charge of a double topographic party engaged in the resurvey of Marthas Vineyard and No Mans Land, Massachusetts. This work had been under way during the last season, .and was completed on the 30th of July, when the party was transferred to topographical work on Chesapeake Bay. Leaving Vineyard Haven on the 6th of At~gust, Assistant Hodgkins arrived iii Washington on the 8th, and after a few preliminary operations the field work was begun in the vicinity of Havre de Grace, Md., the party arriving there on the 12th of August. Headquarters were made at Havre de Grace, as this locality was nearly central for the work to be taken up. The field operations ii1cluded a general survey of the shore line of the bay, together with the estuaries and creeks leading into it near this locality. Considerable topographical work was also filled in between the Bush River and the Susquehanna. Two plane-table parties were kept in the field, one of wh~ch was in the charge of F. F. Weld, recorder, the other being conducted by the chief of party, Assistant° Hodgkins .. All the work outlined in the Superintendent's instructions was completed by the 20th of November, at which time Assistant Hodgkins reported at Washington, where he was joined two days later by Mr. Weld. who remained to close up the work of the party. On reporting at the Office in Washington, Assistant Hodgkins was directed to take up the inking of the field sheets just completed, but on the 2d of December it became necessary to detail him to the command of the steamer Blake, which was then fitting out at Baltimore for a cruise to Porto Rico. He immediately took command of the vessel and superintended the necessary repairs, which were in progress at the time he assumed command. The work being completed by December 22, the yessel was given a trial trip on the

Patapsco River, at which the Superintendent of the Survey was present with a number of invited guests. After testing the compasses and taking on a supply of coal the Blake left Baltimore on the 27th of December and arrived at Norfolk on the following day. A short stay was made for the purpose of getting necessary ship stores and a moderate armament from the Navy Department. When the coal bunkers and water tanks had been filled the Blake put to sea and passed the capes at 1 p. m. on the 30th of December. The ship's company included 50 persons all told, of whom 13 were officers. Assistant Superintendent, Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, was also on board as a passenger, charged with a special scientific mission to Porto Rico, reference to which work is made in the Report proper, under the head of "Special duty" (see p.62). It was the intention to make a direct course from the Capes to the Mona Passage, but after crossing the 'Gulf Stream heavy seas were encountered, and it was deemed advisable to change the course so as to run through the Crooked Island Passage. Two days were spent at anchor behind Acklins Island, on account of continuous high seas, and then the course was laid through the Windward Passage and the Caribbean Sea, along the southern coast of Haiti, to Porto Rico. The vessel came to anchor, off Ponce, early on the morning of January 11 and entered the harbor soon after sunrise. Work was immediately begun' by the measurement of a base line 2 572.6 meters long, on the railroad southwest of Ponce, and the observation of an astronomical azimuth at Cardona Island light-house. A scheme of triangulation was developed from the base line, thus furnishing points for the topographic and hydrog-raphic parties, both of which operations were prosecuted continuously thereafter. The month of April, however, was devoted to a survey of the bar and anchorage at the important harbor of San Juan, on the north coast. The work at this point verified the fact that 35 feet could be found on the bar at low water. The most important anchorages developed on the south coast were Ponce, Jobos, and Arroyo. The field work of the season was closed on June 2, at which date a general survey of the south coast had been made extending eastward from Ponce to Point Figuera, and the triangulation and topography had been carried to Point Viento, still farther east. The Blake left Ponce on the 8th of June and spent the following day searching for a reported rock in the Mona Passage, which, however, was not found. San Juan was reached on the 10th, and the following week was spent in coaling ship, cleaning bottom, and taking on sea stores. Sail was made on the 18th of June, Hatteras sighted on the afternoon of the 24th, and Norfolk reached on the 25th. The following day Assistant Hodgkins received instructions to proceed to Washington, which he did, arriving on the 27th. From that time until the close of the fiscal year the ship lay at anchor in the harbor of Washington. Assistant Hodgkins acknowledges the faithful services of the officers and men of the steamer Blake. He specially commends Assistant Nelson and Aid Bowie for intelligent cooperation in their respective lines of work. Acknowledgments are also due to the officers of -the Army and Navy stationed at Ponce and San Juan for assistance rendered.

18 magnetic stations. meridian lines. 3 gravity stations. r astronomic station.

Instructions were issued to Assistant Edwin Smith on the 18th of April, 1898, for magnetic observations in West Virginia. This work was in progress on the 1st of July, and during the present fiscal year observations were made at Buckhannon, Pickens, ancl Weston. Besides the regular magnetic determinations, meridian lines were established at Buckhannon and Weston. · From July 8 to 18, by special direction of the Superintendent, Assistant Smith was on duty in the office at Washington. On the 19th the magnetic work in West Virginia was resumed and the following stations were occupied before August 4: \Vheeling, Grafton, Philippi, Beverly, Hendricks, and Keyser, at three of which-Wheeling, Philippi, and Beverly-meridian lines were laid out in c;onnection with the magnetic observations. On August 3 instructions were given to Assistant Smith to report to Assistant D. B. Wainwright on the steamer Blake in the Hudson River. From the 11th of August until the 4th of October he was engaged with his party in tertiary triangulation of the Hudson River from New York to Tarrytown in connection with the resurvey in charge of Assistant Wainwright. At the close of the Hudson River operations Assistant Smith reported to the office at Washington on October 5 and immediately thereafter resumed magnetic work in the New England States. Stations were occupied at Rutland, Burlington, Montpelier, and Brattleboro, Vt.; Hanover, N. H.; Williamstown, Plum Island, and Worcester, Mass., and Kittery Point, Me. Meridian lines were established at Rutland, Burlington, Montpelier, Brattleboro, and Worcester. These operations extended until the 23d of November. In accordance with telegraphic instructions on this date Assistant Smith reported

to the office in Washington and was engaged there in work connected with the selection of the international latitude station at Gaithersburg, Md., until December 16. At this date magnetic computations were again taken up and prosecuted until the 23d. During the time in which the party was engaged in magnetic work in the past season 35 stations were occupied, generally on two days each, and 25 meridian lines were established. All this was completed within one hundred and four working days. Under instructions of December 21 preparations were made for gravity determinations. On the rst of January Assistant Smith began operations in this line, the first station being \Vashington, and this being followed by similar observations at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts, and at Columbia University, New York. Pendulum apparatus B was used in this work. These pendulums were swung in northern Europe by Professor Gore during the summer of 1898, and had previously been swung by Assistant E. D. Preston in the Hawaiian Islands during 1891 and 1892. At the latter place one hundred and ninety-nine nights were observed, covering a period of about fourteen months. Two complete series of e~ght-hour swings with the three pendulums were made by Assistant Smith; the first from January 11 to r4 and the second. from January 23 to 25, the final results of both series being identical. The pendulum work at Worcester, Mass., and Columbia University, New York, was finished before the rst of March, when the pendulums were again swung, from the roth to the 16th, at Washington. Assistant Smith was also charged with special duty in January in the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, and also laid out the lot at Gaithersburg, Md., for use of the International Geodetic Association latitude service. In order to determine the difference of longitude between Austin, Tex., and Marlow, Ind. T , Assistant Smith, together with Assistant McGrath, proceeded South early in April. The stations were prepared and the instruments ready for work before the 18th. On account of an unusual spell of bad weather no longitude work could be accomplished before the 13th of May, one month after the arrival of the party at the station. During this interval latitude observations were made. Four complete determinations of longitude were effected before May 20. An exchange of observers then took place, and fonr additional nights were secured between June 3 and 1 r. The latitude of Marlow was determined by 60 observations on 15 pairs of stars, during five nights. The micrometer value was determined on two nights." After having determined the geographical position of Marlow, it was furnished to Mr. \V. A. Lindsay, of the United States Geological Survey, by direction of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The party arrived in Washington on the 17th of June and continued office work until the 20th. The ten days remain}ng before the end of the fiscal year were devoted by Assistant Smith to the establishment of the International Geodetic Association latitude station at Gaithersburg, Md.

astronort1ic longitude determined. (Marlow, Ind. T.)

After having successfully passed the Civil Service Commission examination, Assistant J. E. McGrath received a temporary appointment for six months on August 1, 1898. He was granted a furlough, without pay, for two months to complete certain geodetic work then in hand for the New Yo.rk State Land Survey. At the end of this time he reported on board the steamer Blake, doing hydrography and topography on the Hudson River, near Riverside. His services in this party consisted in making topographical surveys and computations. On November 14 the season closed, and Assistant McGrath reported to the Superintendent, in Washington, for office duty. He was assigned to the computing division and was engaged in hypsometric computations of observations recently made in Florida and Colorado.· In April he was detached from the computing division and was engaged in revising the manuscript of the Annual Report, in the meantime making time observations for the reduction of gravity determinations by Assistant Smith. The manuscript for the Report was submitted April ro. On the 11th, in conformity with instructions issued on the 7th, he left Washin'gton for Austin, Tex., for the purpose of cooperating with'Assistant Smith in the determination of the longitude of Marlow, Ind. T. The work was undertaken to supply the geographical position of an initial station from which could be run that section of the ninety-eighth meridian forming ·the boundary between Oklahoma and Indian Territories, and also between the reservations of the Comanche and Chickasaw nations. The observers changed stations on the 3d of June. Only four nights' simultaneous observations had been obtained since the 17th of April. The last half of the work was much more expeditious and observations closed on June 1I. On the 13th Assistant Smith returned from Austin. On the 14th the field computations and the necessary data for finding the location of the initial point were completed and, by authority of the Superintendent, given to Mr. W. A. Lindsay, an officer of the United States Geological Survey. Assistant McGrath reported at \Vashington on June I9 and was engaged in computations of his recent work until the 30th.

While in c.:harge of the Division of Library and Archives in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, Assistant Vinal received instructions to organize a party for the execution of hydrography in the neighborhood of Queenstown, Md. On account of office duties he was unable to personally organize the work, and the crew was enlisted by Assistant Ogden and sent to the scene of operations. Mr. Vinal took charge on the 10th of June, and operations began on the 13th. The work was therefore thoroughly in hand by the 1st of July, 18'98, and sounding went on uninterruptedly with a whaleboat while developing the shoals and flats near by. A reorganization of the party was soon made in the interest of greater efficiency. 'I'he new regime gave good results, and the work was thereby much facilitated. Mr. \Villiam Sanger, Chief Yeoman, U. S. N., was assigned temporarily on August .'i. and remained with the party until the end of the month. \Vork closed on the 22d of October, and the Chester River, with small tributaries, was completed at this time. The party was in readiness to move, after the 15th of "October, to the upper Chesapeake

Bay, but after a personal inspection by the Superintendent it was deemed best to defer the work until spring. Three hydrographic sheets, scales 1 :20 ooo and I: 10 ooo, and 23 volumes of records contain the results of the season's work. Office work was carried on until January 21. From this date to February 11 Mr. Vinal was unable to perform duty on account of sicknes5. Returning on February 1 1, office work was continued until March 31, when orders were issued for him to relieve Assistant J. B. Boutelle, Coast and Geodetic Survey, of the command of ,the Matdtless, and to make a hydrographic survey of the head of Chesapeake Bay, including the Susquehanna and Northeast rivers. The Jl1atdtless sailed from Washington Navy-Yard on April 5, arrived in Baltimore on the 7th, and after transferring several of her crew to the Pathfinder, on April 9 was engaged in enlisting men and repairing and refitting until the end of the month. She sailed from Baltimore with steam launch No. 23 on the morning of May 1, arriving at Havre de Grace on the 2d. The time between her arrival and May 9 was employed in recovering points of triangulation and determining positions of hydrographic signals. Actual sounding be·gan at the latter date and continued until the end of the fiscal year. The work will probably be finished before the end of July, 1899.

During the beginning of the fiscal year the party of Mr. William Bowie, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was at Middle River station, Pennsylvania Railroad, engaged in a topographical survey of the shores of the upper Chesapeake Bay. From this station the topography of Patapsco Neck and Gunpowder and Middle rivers was executed as far as could be conveniently done. On the uth of August the party moved to Chase, and from this point took up the shores of Gunpowder River and Saltpetre and Seneca creeks. The Bay shore from Ricketts Point to Lego Point was also surveyed. In this work the operations were greatly facilitated by the use of a naphtha launch and rowboats. The topography south of the Gunpowder River was also finished while the party was at Chase. The remaining work of the season was finished from the station Edgewood, and operations were closed on October I 9. On the 20th the party disbanded and Mr., Bowie reported at \Vashington. The work done in this locality, during the two seasons of 1897 and 1898, extends from the north shore of Patapsco River to the south shore of Bush River. The inland limit is the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, except on Patapsco Neck, where Colgate Creek and a line from Colgate Creek to the head of Back River are the limits. On October 25 Mr. Bowie joined the party of Assistant Boutelle, on the schooner Jlfatchless, and was engaged in the survey ~f the Elk River until November 13. He returned to \Vashington on account of sickness and was granted leave of absence until December 3. After this date and until December 3 r he was engaged on office duty, when he was instructed to report to Assistant Hodgkins, in command of the steamer Blake, for duty in Porto Rico. This assignment held until June 5, when he was detached. He reached Washington on June 16, and was engaged until the 27th in the preparation for field work in the vicinity of Havre de Grace, Md. His work on Chesapeake Bay is' shO\vn on one topographic sheet, on a scale of 1: 20 000.

Under instructions of May 16, 1898, Assistant Marindin was engaged 01i'the hydrography of Curtis Creek, Chesapeake Bay, during the remainder of the previous fiscal year. On July r the hydrography of Patapsco River, from Fort Carroll to Seven Foot Knoll light-house, was taken up. At the satrie time the creeks lying to the north, r.amely, Bear, Humphries, North Point, and Shoal, were begun, and later those to the south, namely, Stony, Rock, and Bodkin, were also completed. The hydrography of the river was executed with the steam launch No. 22. The whale boat and dingy were assigned to the work in the creeks. The creeks to the north were finished by the end of July, and appear on one sheet, on a scale of 1: IO ooo. The creeks to the south were not done until the end of August. The work in the river proper, with steam launch No. 22, was finished early in September. The vessel now proceeded to Baltimore for repairs, which were concluded on the 17th of September. During this interval the office work was carried on uninterruptedly, the soundings were reduced and plotted, and the records were duplicated.

On the 18th the Eagre proceeded to Sassafras River, in charge of Assistant G. L. Flower. At the same time Assistant Marindin went to Buffalo, N. Y., to attend the meeting of the board, consisting of Rear Admiral John G. Walker, chairman; Col. Jared Smith, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., and Henry L. Marindin, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, .convened by the Secretary of War to determine the width of the pivot spans of the proposed bridge across the Niagara River, below Buffalo. He returned to Chesapeake Bay and joined the Eagre, off Betterton, on the 26th of September. The work was now continued until the season closed, on November 1I. Five hydrographic sheets, on a scale of 1: 10 ooo, show the work in Patapsco River, and two hydrographic and one topographic sheet result from the work in the vicinity of Sassafras River. This particular work includes the Chesapeake Bay proper from Turkey Point, at the mouth of the Elk River, southward to Bush River, including Romney Creek and the Sassafras River. Under instructions dated November 9, the command of the party was turned over to Assistant Flower. Assistant Marindin reported in Washington immediately for duty in connection with the resurvey of Brunswick Outer Bar, in accordance with the provisions of the river and harbor act of June 3, 1896. An account of Assistant Marindin's subsequent operations will be found under the head of ''Special duty.''

The field work undertaken by Assistant J. B. Boutelle, under instructions of May 16, 1898, was in progress on the rst of July. Signals had been erected at Peach Hill, Magothy, and Bodkin lighthouses, on Chesapeake Bay, and tide gauges established as far as the head of the river before the 17th of June. The topographic and hydrographic surveys of Magothy River and creeks were completed before the 5th of August. On the 6th the vessel proceedeJ t0 Baltimore for stores and supplies, returning on the 12th. At this time the topographic survey of the shore line of Chesapeake Bay, in Annapolis Harbor, was taken up and completed to a short distance below Thomas Point, 11n the west side of the bay. The work ended on the 31st of August, 54 miles of shore line having been run. The party now proceeded to Elk River (September 7), and made a survey as far as Chesapeake City. Four old triangulation stations were recovered and signals were erected. Points were first determined by a plane table triangulation, and by this means the sounding boat was able to start work three days after the arrival of the vessel in the locality of work. Stations were then occupied with the theodolite and the topography of the shore line was begun. Triangulation, topography, and hydrography were all carried along together, the work extending over two additional sheets, and reaching to Chesapeake City. Sixty-six geographical positions were determined, 39 of which were occupied with the theodolite. The work was completed on November 25, and the vessel reached Baltimore on the 28th, after having encountered a heavy storm.

Office work was continued until the 9th of December, when the vessel left for the Washington Navy-Yard. She arrived on the 13th of December, and Assistant Boutelle reported at the Office on the same date. He wa·s engaged in completing the records and topographical and hydrographical sheets of the season's work until the 31st of March·, when he was detached from the command of the schooner Matchless. From this date until May 8 Assistant Boutelle was sick and unable to attend to official duties. Reporting, after his leave of absence, he was assigned to the command of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner Eagre, at Baltimore, Md., and under instructions of May 18 he brought the vessel to Washington, D. C. From the 10th of May, 1899, to the end of the fiscal year the party was engaged in completing the records, topographic and hydrographic sheets, etc., of the resurvey of Brunswick, executed under the direction of Assistant F. W. Perkins during the past winter.

On the 12th of April, 1898, Assistant 0. B. French received instructions to report to the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, for the execution of topography between Stony and Curtis creeks, on the west shore of the Patapsco River, and also on the Magothy River. The heavy timber and irregular topography of this section required continual application of the 3-point problem to establish his position. ·The north part of the Patapsco River work depends largely on traverse lines. Some difficulty was encountered with the irregular shrinkage of the sheet, which required a proportionate distribution of the accumulated discrepancies. The work between Stony and Curtis creeks was completed by September 15. The party was then trans(erred to the Magothy River and the topography of this section taken up. It was completed on the 31st of October. Additional work was now begun on the north end of Kent Island, which was required by the proposed new map of this portion of Chesapeake Bay. Many orchards, which are scattered over this region, caused trouble in carrying satisfactory traverse lines through a greater part of the country, but with occasional checks for azimuths a satisfactory survey was made. The elevations were obtained by the vertical circle on the alidade, the results being satisfactorily given by this method, since all checks applied agreed within z feet. An error of as much as 1 foot was possible from individual references to mean tide. The datum plane was taken from the beach wherever the line was started. Between November 1 and 7 Assistant French's party determined the positions of 3 beacons and 9 buoys, marking the dredged channel through the bar entrance to Rock Hall and Swan creeks. In order to accomplish this, z triangulation stations of the Chesapeake Bay work were occupied with a small theodolite. The graphic positions of the beacons were then computed and the positions of buoys determined by plotting, by directions and distances. The field work of these operations only required one day. Assistant French reported to the Office in Washington on the 7th of November. From this time until January 3, with the exception of twenty days spent on leave, Assistant French was at the office in Washington completing the records of the season and making preparations. for the next season's work.

Under instructions dated July l, 1898, Mr. J. W. Donn, Extra Observer, Coast and Geodetic Survey, made a reconnoissance to the south and southeast of Baltimore from the southern boundary at Gwynns Falls to Curtis Bay, on the south side of the Patapsco. , This reconnoissance was made for the purpose of selecting points for a scheme of triangulation, and also for graphic determination of positions by means of the plane table. The work brought out the fact that sufficient points c:Ould be determined by means of the plane table to thoroughly control the topography, and, in order to avoid cutting long lines, this method of triangulation was exclusively followed. Within three days sufficient points for the southern sheet, Curtis Bay to Washington Road, had been established. No signals were necessary on account of the great number of standing structures. The work progressed satisfactorily in spite of the excessive heat during the months of July and August, and the almost continual clouds of dust from the shell roads. The first sheet was completed by September l. The party then moved to. the north side of the Patapsco on the east side of Baltimore. This region was much better supplied with trigonometrical data than the southern portion. The triangulation was largely expanded by plane-table determinations, which were secured during the first three days. Af~er this, work was carried on uninterruptedly. Exceptionally unfavorable weather conditions existed during November and December. The sheet was completed by the first of the year. The third projection covered the triangular area of several square miles between the western part of the first sheet and the work done by Assistant 0. B. French. The work was taken up and finished by February l. Great extremes of temperature were experienced during the season, ranging from 104° F. in July and August, to 9° below zero in January. . In spite of these extreme conditions not one day was lost by sickness through excessive heat or cold, or through casualty, by any member of the party. From February r to June r, 1899, Mr. Donn was engaged in office work at Washington. From June r to i3 preparations were made for field work, and on the latter date the topography of Kent Island, Eastern Bay, etc., was taken up. This was in progress at the end of the fiscal year.

177 triangulation stations occupied. 226 directions determined. 292 points determined. 188 square miles triangulation. 340 square miles available for topographic and hydrographic work.

During the latter part of the previous fiscal year Assistant F. W. Perkins was engaged in triangulation on the Chesapeake Bay. His instructions, which were dated April 14, directed him to determine points for the use of hydrographic and topographic parties in the locality above mentioned. This work was taken up immediately, and by June 30, 1898, the observing parties, of which Assistant Perkins had immediate charge of one and Mr. H. F. Flynn, Aid, the other, were at Fairhaven and Tilghmans Island. The construction party, which had charge of the erection of signals, had proceeded south as far as the Patuxent River. Up to the date above mentioned, i. e., the close of the former fiscal year, 125 signals had been erected and 74 stations occupied. The work covered about 260 square miles of the bay. The operations continued on the same general lines until the 26th of September, when the number of signals erected had increased to 298, supplying points on an average of 1 y;i miles apart, on both sides, from Havre de Grace to Mobjack Bay. The construction party was then disbanded. The observation of horizontal angles was continued until November 9. During the 6 ,0 months 177 stations had been occupied and some 292 points were determined. Local triangulations by Assistants Baylor and Hodgkins, made for the State Boundary Commission of Maryland and Virginia, and also by Assistant Wainwright for a speed trial course, at the request of the United States Navy, were included in the regular scheme of triangulation, and when necessary their trigonometrical points were reoccupied, so that the angular measurements by the several parties can be combined in one general scheme. Watts Island Light is an old triangulation station of the original survey of the bay and was included in the present work, which gives a check. The great width between the shores of the bay from the mouth of the Potomac River southward, made it necessary to use light-houses, whenever available, in connection with scaffolds. By this means a strong system of work was carried out, and tertiary points on either side were determined from the main network. The observations have now been carried on the Eastern Shore to the capes, and the party was on the Western Shore, working northward, when operations closed. The detachment of Mr.Flynn in October left the Western Shore untouched beyond Point Lookout. Assistant Perkins speaks in the highest terms of the services of the members of his party-Aid Flynn as to observing and computations, and Foreman Bilby in the erection of signals. Recorder Whitney is also highly commended by Assistant Perkins for great efficiency, even while laboring under the effects of malaria.

The hydrographic resurvey of Chesapeake Bay was continued, in the vicinity of Pooles Island, by Assistant Wainwright, in command of 'the steamer Endeavor, from July l to 15, 1898. At the latter date he was directed to relieve Assistant Ogden in command of the steamer Blake. Repairs were undertaken at one~, and on the completion of these she came to Washington, in order to leave part of her outfit for deep sea work. This took place in the latter part of July. Early in August the resurvey of Hudson River, from Spuyten Duyvil Creek to Piermont Pier, was begun. The topography and hydrography was completed from Spuyten Duyvil to Ardsley, a distance of about 10 miles. The triangulation on which this work is based necessarily extended a greater distance, beginning at a base in New York City and reaching to Tarrytown on the north. Many changes were noted during the progress of the new survey, principal among which may be mentioned the increased docking facilities to meet the demands of greater population and commerce. Few changes of a substantial character appear on the west side of the river. The hydrography of the old survey was executed in 1855, by Lieut. R. Wainwright, U. S. N. S. Doc. 454--11 161

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898--<)9.

The changes noticed in this branch of the work have been in the improvement of the channel, both in depth and width. From Spuyten Duyvil Creek to Yonkers, however, little change was noticed in the contour of the bottom up to the 5-fathom curve. The breadth of area between the 6-fathom curves, on either side above Mount St. Vincent, was found somewhat increased. This was also the case with the 7-fathom curve. The most notable change, however, was in the increase of area between the curves of 8 fathoms. In the survey of 1855 this is shown as a surface 550 meters in length by 120 meters in breadth, the northern limit being a half mile below Riverdale. In the present survey this limit is opposite Mount St. Vincent, and the area extends southward 2 500 meters, with an average breadth of 200 meters. From Yonkers to Hastings no important differences were discovered. From Hastings to Ardsley the 8-fathom curve extends from a point opposite Dobbs Ferry to about five-eighths of a mile to the southward. The old work did not indicate this. For the prosecution of the hydrographic work, 2 projections were furnished by the office. Not one of the old triangulation points could be found, as they were probably located on wharves and temporary structures long since abandoned or destroyed. The present triangulation was placed in charge of Assistant Edwin Smith, and the computations were made, while the work was under way, by Assistant Wainwright, as time and data would permit. Tide gauges were located at Riverdale, Glenwood, and Dobbs Ferry, and were connected by simultaneous observations on two days at the slack ebb and slack flood. A current period was determined according to the method described in Appendix No. r 1, Report for 1870. During the greater part of the sounding the steam launch was in charge of Chief Yeoman C. L. Green, who was afterwards replaced by Chief Yeoman T. W. Leutze. The remainder of the hydrographic party was made up of Second-Class Yeoman D. B. Wainwright and Seaman Recorder Oscar Straube. The longitudinal- lines of soundings were run by the steamer and the transverse filled in by the use of the steam launch. The topography was restricted principally to the shore line, except in certain instances where towns ran to the water's edge, when a survey was made. In the latter part of October the vessel repaired to Buzzards Bay to investigate an uncharted ledge in Quicks Hole. Assistant McGrath continued the shore line at Yonkers during this absence. Mr. L. M. Hopkins served as chief engineer of the vessel during her season's work, and deserves special commendation for his ability. The season closed early in November. The Blake then proceeded to Baltimore, and was undergoing repairs and outfitting for winter work in Porto Rico until the close of the calendar year. Assistant Wainwright was taken sick in the latter part of November, and was unable to perform duty until the roth of January. He was relieved of the command of the Blake by Assistant Hodgkins, who continued to act in this capacity until the close of the fiscal year. Assistant Wainwright was engaged upon a report of his season's work and miscellaneous duties, from January 10 to April 18, on which date he was assigned to duty in the office of the Superintendent, and in addition to this was engaged in the preparation of a new edition of a plane table manual. His work on the Hudson River is comprised on 3 topographic sheets, scale 1: 5 ooo; and also 3 hydrographic sheets on the same scale.

As executive officer on the steamer Endeavor Assistant Charles C. Yates was engaged in hydrography near Pooles Island on the 1st day of July, 1898. · On the 14th Assistant D. B. Wainwright, the commanding officer, was relieved and placed in charge of the steamer Blake. Assistant Yates succeeded to the command of the Endeavor. From the 14th to the 17th the p~rty was reorganized, and tidal stations were established at ·Reybolds Wharf and Pooles Island. During this interval, on the 19th of July, the Endeavor proceeded to Baltimore, to enable the officers to attend the funeral of Lieut. J. J. Blandin, U.S. N., a former commander of the vessel. From July 27 to· September 25 the hydrography of Chesapeake Bay was continued in the vicinity of Pooles Island. The work extends s~veral miles north of Worton Point, and includes Fairlee Creek, Worton Creek, and what is known as the Pooles Island '' Holes and Shoals.'' Some remarkable features were developed in this work. The bottom was found to be exceedingly uneven, and the cry of the leadsman, ''Seven fathoms and no bottom,'' was frequently heard between two soundings of less than 2 fathoms. In one case a hole 87 feet deep was found between two 8-foot lumps. Instructive comparisons were made between the survey!i of 1898 and those of 1846. These show that the average depth at present is less than the average depth fifty-two years ago. This is especially noticeable in the channel opposite Pooles Island. The navigable channel now running out from Pooles Island has a fathom less water than in 1846; also the 4 and 5 fathom channels extending from the capes to abreast of Pooles Island now end here, while in 1846 the northern limit was near the mouth of the Sassafras River. The work in this locality is comprised on one hydrographic sheet and includes 27 square miles of area and 419 miles soundings. Three tidal stations were established, 25 bottom specimens obtained, and 25 hydrographic signals erected. The number of angles measured was 5 508. Subsequent to the work in the neighborhood of Pooles Island that in the vicinity of Kent Island was taken up. It extends between Sandy and Thomas Point, and began on the 26th of September. The operations were continued without interruption until November 14, except three days, when the vessel was used by the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography on a tour of inspectio'n in the bay. . When the soundings in the vicinity of Pooles Island were completed and plotted, and while the vessel was at Kent Island, a further development was found necessary in the former work, and the vessel returned to finish the hydrography on November 15. This was completed on the 3d of December, when the Endeavor proceeded to Baltimore to await orders. The Kent Island work was resumed on December 9 and completed on the 2 lSt; The vessel now again returned to Baltimore, and was at anchor in the harbor during the holidays. Immediately thereafter the Endeavor underwent repairs,· and during this time the party on board was engaged in compiling the reports, making up the records, and finishing the sheets already commenced. The work at Kent Island was greatly retarded by the rough seas and cold weather.

On· several occasions the boats were compelled to return to the steamer, the lead lines being frozen and therefore too stiff for good work. Few indications of important changes since the survey of i848 were found in this latter.locality, exc;ept a 9-foot shoal which was found to be making out near the southern end of Kent Island. Assistant Yates recommends the clear marking of the 4 and 5 fathom curves on charts of this locality as of great assistance to navigators of deep-draft vessels. He states that the value of commerce passing through these waters in vessels drawing between 3 and s fathoms is certainly as great as in vessels of lesser draft. Assistant Yates expresses his high appreciation of the efficient and harmonious services of all the officers and crew. The Kent Island work is comprised on one hydrographic sheet and embraces 131 square miles of area, 414 miles of soundings, 2 tidal stations, and 27 signals; 5 002 angles were measured.
RECONNOISSANCE.

An official trip of the Endeavor w~s made on April 13 to test the repairs made at Baltimore during the winter. This proving satisfactory, a reconnoissance was undertaken and was continued until the ,30th of April. Assistant Yates was sick after the 30th of April, and was compelled to relinquish active command of the vessel for one month. During the first twelve days of this time the Endeavor was in Annapolis Harbor, the party being engaged in completing records and drafting. On the 13th, Assistant Gilbert was placed in command of the vessel and completed the reconnoissance before the 29th of May, when Assistant Yates resumed work. Since as many signals are necessary for this class of work as would be required for work executed in detail, much time was devoted to signal building; in fact quite as much as was given to the sounding work proper. These signals were necessarily large and high, as they were used in locating soundings at distances of from 1o to 12 miles. The reconnoissance accomplished covers 367 square miles and joins the work of the Endeavor

of the preceding fall, extending 60 miles south, to the mouth of the Potomac. The limits of work adopted on either side were the 3-fathom curves. In this connection it may be said that the results of simultaneous tidal observations of previous seasons saved much time and uncertainty by furnishing data at convenient stations. After the soundings were reduced and plotted cross sections of the main channel, approximately s ooo metres apart, were drawn and compared with similar cross sections obtained fifty years ago. Few changes in the main channel in depth over 3 fathoms were noticeable, and where they do occur seem to be more in the direction of a displacement of the channel to the east or west than in depth. The reconnoissance just executed will prove very useful in indicating the amount of hydrography to be done in the resurvey by comparison of the cross sections just completed with the old ones. Much needless work will, therefore, be avoided. Four tidal stations were established in this area, and the work is comprised on three hydrographic sheets. Fifteen signals were erected and r73 miles of soundings made. In connection with the hydrographic work of· Assistant Yates in the Chesapeake Bay during the past fiscal year (for mention of which see p. r 63), tidal stations were established at Pooles Island and Reybolds Wharf. Between July 20 and 26 these two stations and seven others, distributed between Turkey Point, at the head of the Bay, and Stingram Point, at the mouth of the Rappahannock River, were inspected. Between August 6 and 10 and August r9 and 24 inspection trips were made to each of the nine stations; and twenty-one days were spent on this work independent of tlJe completion of records and disestablishment of stations. A careful description of the stations and the connecting bench marks were added to the records and forwarded to the Office. On February 6, 1899, Assistant Chas. C. Yates was appointed by the honorable Secretary of the Treasury as a member of the trial board to test the steamer Path.finder before her final acceptance by the Department. From the above date until March 30, when the board was relieved from further duty, fifteen days were devoted to this occupation. A report of the inspection and trial trip was submitted to the Superintendent by the board on the 29th of March, and is referred to in detail toward the end of this Ap'Pendix.

At the request of the State geologist of North Carolina, transmitted through the governor of the State, Assistant J.B. Baylor was given instructions to make a magnetic survey under his direction. This work was in progress on the 1st of July and continued until the 16th of October, during which time meridian lines were established at the followingcounty seats: Newbern, Bayboro, Beaufort, Jacksonville, Wilmington, Smithville, Salisbury, Marion, Asheville, Marshall, Bryson City, Murphy, Franklin, Webster Brevard. All three magnetic elements-the declination, dip, and horizontal intensity-were determined at the above places, except Beaufort, which had already been occupied during the fiscal year 1897-98. In order that county surveyors might be provided with means to test their chains, standards of length were marked on the court-house floors. The s~rveying profession will therefore be enabled not only to determine at all times the condition of their compasses employed in running the boundary lines, but also will have an invariable standard to which their measures of length can be referred. It is believed that this procedure on the part of the State will result in the doing away of many sources of litigation in the settlement of boundary disputes. The conditions upon which this work was done were that the State, or, rather, the counties, should pay all the expenses of making the observations, except the salary of the observer, this and the necessary instruments being provided for by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Mr. J. A. Holmes, State geologist, had immediate direction of the work, and it \vent on satisfactorily and uninterruptedly. From October 17 to November 2 Assistant Baylor was granted annual leave. From November 3 to 8 he was engaged in office work at Washington. The connection between the coast triangulation on the Gulf and that on the Atlantic side of Florida had recently been undertaken by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. There remained, in order to complete this work, a few angles to be measured. This'was undertaken by Mr. Baylor on November 9 and finished on the 20th of December, at which time he returned to \Vashington and was engaged on computations until the 23d of January. The period between this date and the end of February was passed in the Computing Division, under the direction of Assistant C. A. Schott, making triangulation computations for the Chesapeake Bay work.

Between the 1st of March and the 23d Assistant Baylor resumed magnetic computations, and also employed part of the time in detenpining the constants of his instrument. On the latter day preparations were made to resume the magnetic survey of No.rth Carolina, and the work went on without interruption until the close of June. As in the previous season, standards of length for surveyors' chains were established in the court-houses, and meridians were laid out and marked. The usual magnetic observations, i.ncluding all three of the elements, were made at Hertford, Columbia, Gatesville, Winton, Jackson, Halifax, Tarboro, Nashville, Wilson, Kinston, Goldsboro, Fayetteville, Smithfield, Raleigh, Snow Hill, Clinton.

After having finished the work at Aransas Pass, Tex., the steamer Bache, under command of Assistant P. A. Welker, Coast and Geodetic Survey, sailed for Galveston on the 7th of March, arriving on the following day. Water, provisions, and coal were taken here, and on the 11th the party left for Mobile. They arrived on the 14th, having encountered head winds and heavy seas most of the way. The vessel was here inspected by the United States local inspector of hulls, and repairs being found necessary, these were authorized by the Superintendent under date of April 6, not to exceed $3 ooo. They were made before April 25, and on the 26th the steamer swung for compass deviation and left the same day for Charleston, S. C., instructions to this effect having been issued on the 13th of April. They arrived on the 6th of May, having been delayed at Key West and Brunswick, Ga., by bad weather. . A consultation was immediately held with Mr. George B. Edwards and other members of the board of trade of Charleston on the morning of the 8th, and on the 15th the hydrographic survey of the Hog Island Channel was begun. .This was completed on the 19th, two hydrographic parties being employed, one using an oil launch and the other a whaleboat. The former was in charge of Mr. C. L. Green and the latter of Mr. William B. Proctor. A rectangular system of lines was adopted, running north and south and east and west. These were also crossed by a diagonal system, and the shore line was surveyed.

Patapsco River, and arrangements for hydrographic work at the mouth of Rock Creek, Maryland, supplementing that done by Marindin during the season of 1898. The plan adopted for the examination of shoal spots was as follows: The launch was first placed in position, indicated by projection, and then allowed to move slowly, with the lead kept vertical at the bottom. The shoal spot was thus located and its position carefully recorded. Several lines were also run parallel with the axis of the channel. With few exceptions the places examined were found to be in error to the extent of a fathom upon the original sheet of 1898. This work was completed on the 5th of July, and the Baclte returned to Baltimore.

On the 9th of November Assistant F. W. Perkins was assigned to the command of the schooner Eagre. He joined the vessel on the 15th. At this time surveying operations were under way on the Sassafras River, Chesapeake Bay, hydrography and topography being carried on simultaneously. Before work could be regularly taken up orders were received detaching Messrs. Flower and Ritchie, and the following day the vessel was ordered to Baltimore. · Reaching the latter port on the 21st, necessary repairs were undertaken, and on the 1st of December the party set sail for Brunswick, Ga. A northeast gale prevented the continuance of the trip, and the vessel came to anchor inside the Capes until the 5th, when she got under way in a moderate gale from the westward, arriving at Brunswick on the morning of the 9th. A heavy storm at this point prevented entering the. harbor, and Assistant Perkins put to sea until the I 1th, when the weather moderated and he was able to make port. · · The instructions given the party at this point were to furnish officers and men and facilities for the survey of the outer bar, which was being made for the United States Engineer Corps, by Assistant Marindin. Assistant Perkins was to employ spare time in making a resurvey of the harbor. After considerable labor, three original triangulation points were recovered and a sufficient number of signals were erected and determined. The work then progressed as rapidly as the circumstances under which it was done permitted, and before April 23 three sheets of hydrography and topography were completed, covering the entrance, the harbor, the river, and some miles beyond. On the latter day the vessel put to sea on its return north.

From December 31, 1898, to May 3, 1899, Assistant Flower was attached to the party of Assistant Perkins. The party arrived at Baltimore on the lSt of May. Assistant Perkins was thereupon relieved of the command of the Eagre and ordered to make preparations to take the steamer Patlijinder to San Francisco. On the lst of June he relieved Captain Ross as commander of that vessel, and went to sea on the rrth. Some defects on the lower air ports, however, made it necessary to return to Newport News for repairs. These were completed by June 16, and the vessel again got under way, passing out of the Capes of Virginia and taking its course for the island of Santa Lucia, in the West Indies. The harbor of Castries was entered early on the morning of the 23d. After coaling and making some magnetic observations, the vessel got under way on the 25th for Pemambuco, which place was reached on the 6th of July, 1899. Further details of the voyage of the Patlijinder to San Francisco will be found toward the end of this appendix (see page 238).

39 miles levels.

As the result of a civil-service examination, Mr. 0. W. Ferguson was appointed an Assistant on the 1st of July, 1899. Previous to this time he was employed as an extra observer, and was instructed to carry on field work in the line of precise leveling. His appointment as extra observer dates from May 11. The oath of office was taken on the 16th, and after a few days spent in ·washington, preparing for the field, he proceeded to Gibraltar, Mich., at the west end of Lake Erie, and organized a party. On June 3 the work upon the line Gibraltar, Mich., to Cincinnati, Ohio, was actually begun, and at the end of the fiscal year the leveling operations were complete to Toledo, Ohio, a distance of 39 miles.

In compliance with orders of the 30th of December to organize a party on board schooners Quick and Spy for the resurvey of Lake Maurepas, Louisiana, Assistant French left Washington on the 3d of January. Remaining at Pensacola until January 6, in order to make arrangements for the transfer of the schooner Spy, he arrived in New Orleans on the 7th. Here the necessary arrangements were made for the speedy prosecution of the work. The schooner Quick arrived at West End on January 14. The time between this date and the 20th was employed in procuring supplies, enlisting crew, and making necessary preliminary arrangements. The field work began on the 23d by the location of a base line on the trestle of the Illinois Central Railway across Pass Manchac. Three measures of this line were made with a 25-metre steel tape, stretched on top of the rail. The astronomical azimuth at the north end of the Pass was used in the computation of the position of the triangulation stations around the la~e. The stations through the Pass to the base line were computed from the azimuth obtained from the Lake Pontchartrain work. On account of the difficulty of securing a firm foundation, the signals around the lake were made by cutting off a tree, setting a pole alongside, and nailing a
175

cap block to the stump. The observing scaffold was then built around the central pole. Owing to the thick undergrowth, it was entirely impracticable to carry the triangulation on shore around the lake, so that the use of water signals, a scheme often employed in Southern work, was adopted. By erecting signals several miles from land and making suitable trigonometrical connections, the distances may be calculated without occupying any of the latter points. This was done successfully in this, as it had been in many other cases. Triangulation was carried on by two parties, one vessel working to the south and the other to the north, coming together on the opposite side of the lake. The lines ranged in length from 2 to 4 miles, the joining line of the two schemes of triangles being 4 miles long and showing a discrepancy between the two schemes of work of only 6 centimetres. The latitudes and longitudes were determined by computation from the Lake Pontchartrain work, a chain of triangles furnishing this data coming through Pass Mancbac. · After finishing the computations the triangulation stations were transferred to the topographic and hydrographic sheets, and the schooner Spy then undertook the hydrography of the southern half and the Quick that of the northern half, together with the topography entirely around the lake. Both the topography and hydrography of this lake are simple, there being very little detail to b~ inserted and the depths of the water remaining quite uniform. The only points requiring special consideration were the development of the bars at the entrance to the rivers and the passes. The datum for soundings was determined from two tide staffs, read every hour, from 7 a. m. to 6 p. m., during the hydrographic work. One of these staffs was on the trestle across Pass Manchac and the other was near the entrance to the Amite River. The readings of the reference plane on these two staffs were determined by differential comparisons with the old staff at Pass Manchac, from two weeks' simultaneous readings, the reference plane on this old staff being established by Assistant Welker in 1897. On the r 1th of April the schooner Qu£ck was inspected by Captain Barker, inspector of steamboats, and also. by Assistant Ogden, Inspector of Hydrography and Topography. (In this connection see also notice of the schooner Quick in report of special duty by Assistant H. G. Ogden, p. 229.) The field work closed on the 17th of April. The crew was discharged on April 22, and Assistant French reported in the office at Washington on the 26th. From this date until the end of the fiscal year he was engaged in office work in connection with the survey of Lake Maurepas.

Instructions were issued on November 28 to Assistant P. A. Welker for the execution of triangulation, topography, and hydrography at Aransas Pass. The steamer /Jaclze, having received outfit and supplies at New York and undergone repairs at Baltimore, left the latter port on December 18 for the scene of operations. The party arrived _at Key West on the 28th, having stopped several days at Hampton Roads on account of bad weather. Leaving Key West on December 31, a violent gale was encountered on the following day, and they were obliged to run before the wind in the direction of the jetties of the Mississippi River, distant 210 miles. For forty-eight hours the ship rolled and pitched terrifically and was in a precariqus position. They fortunately reached the mouth of the river on the 3d of January, the officers and crew being much fatigued by the voyage. The Bache was overhauled and repaired, and Assistant Welker awaited good weather until the 8th, when he left for Galveston, arriving the following afternoon. Lumber, provisions, and other necessary articles for the season's work were here taken on board, and on the evening of the 14th they sailed for Aransas Pass, entering the harbor at 8 a. m. on January 15. At Galveston, in conformity with instructions from the Superintendent, Assistant Welker called on Mr. H. C. Ripley, C. E., and obtained from him a blue print of his recent survey of Aransas Pass and data for the plane of reference for the reduction of the soundings. The coordinates for the location of signals of his recent survey were also furnished. These, however, were not used, because subsequent connection was made with the Coast and Geodetic Survey triangulation. The three following days after his arrival Assistant Welker engaged in a search for old points, and also erected signals for hydrography and topography. On the 19th both these operations were commenced. The points, McGloins Bluff and Aransas Lights. Doc. 454--12 177

House, were recovered, and a line joining these points was used as a base from which the necessary triangulation was developed. McGloins Bluff, however, was not occupied. (See sketch showing triangulation, topography, and hydrography ). The plane table was used for topography, and the position of the boat while sounding was located by simultaneous sextant angles. The hydrography was rectangular, the lines being 20 to 100 meters apart. For special development of critical points, diagonal and zigzag lines were also run. The velocity and direction of the currents were determined by the same system as that used at Portsmouth, N. (See ante, p. 144.) Notwithstanding the low latitude of the place, where one might usually expect passably good weather, the season was very stormy, not more than one day in seven being possible for work on the bar. Whenever a good day was available the entire force was thrown upon this part of the work. A severe storm broke over the locality and raged without intermission from February 9 to 13, with the wind shifting from NE. to N\V. As a result of this storm the depths of water in some parts of the Pass were changed as much as 4 feet. The thermometer descended to 12° below zero C. Fruit trees and vegetables were destroyed, cattle were frozen, etc. During the entire stay at Aransas the work was impeded on many days by fog, and only one-third of the available time was used for work of any kind. . A number of times efforts have been made to increase the depth of water at Aransas Pass by the construction of jetties. Two attempts were made on the south side of the entrance, where the Mansfield and Nelson jetties were partially constructed. In 1895 the Aransas Harbor Company partially constructed a jetty, in the form of a letter S, pn the north side of the entrance. The present channel, however, crosses the Mansfield jetty, portions of which are still in existence. The Nelson jetty is entirely destroyed, with the exception of a piece of wall along the south shore of the Pass. Few opportunities were had for obtaining current observations, the indications are, however, that currents prevail during the winter months from the northward. A bar is forming at the northeast end of Mustang Island by southerly winds and the eddy formed by the current through the Pass. The results of the survey show an inner channel of about rs feet width at the entrance. On account of narrowness it is not safe for vessels more than 150 feet in length or I I feet draft to enter. Extreme care is necessary even with such a vessel, and the time must be chosen when there is little swell on the bar. The steamer Bache, 1 ro feet long, entered drawing IO feet 2 inches, and passed out drawing 9 feet 6 inches. Good anchorage ground, ranging from one-eighth to one-fourth mile in width and about 1 U miles long, may be had inside the Pass. The bottom is good holding material and the anchorage perfectly landlocked. The best position is in the Pass abreast the lighthouse, near the St. Joseph Island shore entrance. In thick weather the lead may be depended upon, as the bottom is gradual, with no outlying dangerous shoals. Care must be taken to avoid the submerged portion of the jetty, which extends one-fourth of a mile to the southward beyond the visible part. During the work at this place Assistant J. A. Flemer had charge of the topographic survey and the location of hydrographic points with the plane table. He also assisted in the hydrographic work. Mr. C. L. Green was in charge of the whaleboat while sounding, and also served with great credit as executive officer of the steamer.

A reconnoissance on the ninety-eighth meridian was under way on the 1st of July, and was continued without interruption until November. During the season, which includes the latter part of the last fiscal year and th_e first part of the fiscal year 1898--<)9, 480 miles along the ninety-eighth meridian were covered with a scheme of unbroken quadrilaterals, with points on each side of the meridian, furnishing sides with an average length of 24 miles. This reconnoissance scheme embraces 20 triangulation stations of the Unitecj States Geological Survey, established between 1884 and 1898. The area covered is nearly 17 ooo square miles, and the work embraces 75 triangulation stations. One hundred and eight points were examined and actually observed and occupied. The operations extend from latitude 29° to latitude 35° 30', leaving 3° 30' on the north, between the terminus and the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in Kansas. There also remain, to complete the reconnoisance to the Rio Grande, 3 degrees of latitude on the south. In the remaining country, not yet covered by the reconnoissance, shorter lines will be found necessary, as the topographical features are flat. A 5-mile base line has been selected 3 miles east of Addington, Chickasaw Nation, Indian Territory, and another base, equally long, has been chosen 8 miles northeast of Rush Springs in the same nation. The country is comparatively easy of access, but the river crossings are treacherous on account of quicksands. No accommodations can be procured with the farmers in this region, and a camp outfit is necessary for any party doing work of this character. The wagon roads through Indian Territory are fair, but

in Oklahoma Territory they are much better in every respect. The atmospheric conditions for the measurements of horizontal angles are poor during the day, on account of the haze and smoke; but the nights are exceptionally clear, and for this reason night work is recommended for observations on primary points, reserving the daylight observations, near sundown, if necessary, for secondary points. The extremes of temperature are great, the mercury standing at I 10° in the shade on many days between June and October. The nights, however, are cool. From November 3 to April 1, Assistant Forney was stationed at the Office in Washington, completing the computations and reductions of his season's work. On the latter date, receiving instructions to resume the field work in Indian Territory, he arrived at El Reno on the 4th. Four stations were chosen and a base line, 12·8 kilometers long, was selected before the 9th. The party then moved to Guthrie. From Lone Tree station, Indian Territory, to the valley of the Arkansas River, the country is settled and well adapted for triangulation. Night signals should be used for the regular work, and daylight observations for tertiary points. Assistant Forney estimates that single stations should occupy five days. From Lone Tree to Pretty Prairie station, 31 tripods and signals are necessary, varying in height from 15 to 90 feet. The signals along the triangulation cost $19 per statute mile. But two base lines are established-one at El Reno, 12 ·s kilometers as before mentioned, and one at Anthony, 6"6 kilometers long.

SUMMARY OF OPERATION'S.

May 13 to June 30, 1899.

8oo square miles reconnoissance. 85 lines of intervisibility determined. 30 points selected for scheme.

Assistant William Eimbeck was engaged, from July r until the month of October, in charge of the Library and Archives Division. After having been relieved from this duty he was occupied in miscellaneous work in connection with the transcontinental arc in Colorado until December. He was then transferred to the Computing Division and was engaged in the computations of latitude, time, and azimuth, the observations having been made by Assistant G. R. Putnam in the vicinity of St. Michael, Alaska. Under instructions of April 7 he was assigned to duty on the ninety-eighth meridian, the work to be taken in hand being, first, reconnoissance, and afterwards triangulation. He left Washington on May 2, proceeding to Salina, Kans. On May 13, in order that the party might be nearer the scene of operations, it was transferred to Ellsworth, Kans. Here the organization was completed and the reconnaissance was continued by examination of the stations Heath, Wilson, and Bunker Hill, already occupied in the transcontinental triangulation. The line of departure adopted was the one joining the stations Wilson and Heath, and from this as a bas~ 4 distinct trigonometrical figures, extending about 70 miles to the southward and crossing the valley of Arkansas River, were established. The scheme closes with the line between Sunflower and Arlington, 18 miles long. Here the work joins with the reconnaissance of Assistant Stehman Forney, brought northward from Texas. On the 18th of June the party started back toward Ellswort.h, and on the way located a central station near Partridge. At the end of the fiscal year they were established at Ellsworth, completing the office work and preparing a report on that already accomplished.

The party of Assistant F. D. Granger was in foll operation on the rstof July. On this particular date camp was being moved from station Cooper to Blue Hill, in Nebraska. After having established the party at Blue Hill, it was found necessary to make a reconnoissance near Hastings, to establish the station Mason. The old scheme of triangulation was changed somewhat as a result of this work and the work considerably strengthened thereby. The horizontal and vertical angles were entirely completed at Blue Hill on the 20th of July, and the party immediately moved to Herrick Station. Work was finished at this point by August 6. Observations on Sand Creek were not completed before the signal was partly carried away by storm. As the replacing of this signal would have involved considerable expense, and as nearly all the observations had already been made ·upon it, it was not deemed necessary to delay the work to make the record complete. Much bad weather now ensued and the work was considerably retarded. However, the station Lars was completed between September 14 and 20 and Mason was occupied before October 5. Signals were erected at Valley, Cameron, and Pompey, and observations were finished at Prosser by the 4th of November. The horizontal directions were now complete, except those on the proposed Shelton base terminals. This base line, between the towns of Shelton and Gibbon, about 56 feet north and parallel to the track of the Union Pacific Railway, along a roadway of 100 feet width between these towns. The party was disbanded on November 16 and Assistant Granger reported in Washington immediately thereafter. The office work was continued until the 2d of December, when Assistant Granger took leave of absence until the 22d. Returning to duty, the computations were continued until the 31st of March, 1899. Early in April the party was reorganized and proceeded to the field, arriving at 182

Prosser on the r 2th. A reconnoissance was found necessary, and considerable difficulty was found in.locating a base line, since one of the terminalpoints was to be an interior station of a quadrilateral. It was finally selected, and the signals at the terminal points of the base were completed by the 26th of April. Observations began at Prosser on the 29th. West base was occupied between May 8 and 12, and east base between the 15th and 22d. Lowell Station was occupied before June 7. Valley was next taken up and the observations at this point concluded before the end of the fiscal year. During the year 15 signals were erected and xx stations occupied.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

149 kilometres of leveling line completed. 21 bench marks established and connected. 2I bench marks established but not connected.

Assistant Baldwin was attached to the party of Assistant J. F. Pratt, doing work at the mouth of the Yukon River, Alaska, until October 19, 1898, when the party arrived at Seattle. Acting under telegraphic instructions, Assistant Baldwin proceeded to Washington, arriving on November 3, having had leave of absenc~en route. From November 5 to the close of the calendar year he was engaged in various duties in the Tidal Division and in the Office of Weights and Measures. From the beginning of the year until February 14, he was unable to attend to duty on account of illness. At the latter date he was attached to the Computing Division and engaged on the Alaska computations. During the month of December he served as a member of the committee to consider the subject of precise leveling. On the 30th of March, 1899, instructions were issued to take up the work of precise leveling at Abilene, Kans., and to continue northward on the line of the' ninetyeighth meridian, or as near this locality as possible. The route approved by the Superintendent was from Abilene, Kans., to Superior, Nebr.; thence to Lester and Hastings; thence to Grand Island, and from that point, by the Union Pacific Railway, to Columbus and Norfolk. From the latter point connection was to be made to Sioux City, Iowa, with the precise levels of the Mississippi River Commission. Having obtained permission for the use of velocipede cars, Assistant Baldwin first passed over 109 miles of the proposed line and arranged quarters for the party, and also established the required bench marks. Returning to Abilene on the 6th of May, and the instruments arriving on the 8th, the organization of the party was completed immediately, and the work of observing began .. The necessity of connecting with two bench marks of the transcontinental line compelled Assistant Baldwin to run parallel to this work between Abilene and Solomon, a distance of 14·5 kilometres. The instrumental outfit and method of observing were entirely new, but the same personnel was required-an observer, recorder, 2 rodmen, and 2 hands. In order that the work might be accelerated, Assistant Baldwin adopted the method of moving ahead from station to station with the instrument, by riding on the velocipede car, which was propelled by one of the men. By this means it was possible for the chief of party to

carry the instruments himself, and shorten very perceptibly the interval between stations. Frequent and serious delays were experienced by high winds, which prevailed continuously during both May and June. After the party became well organized a speed of 1 mile an hour was regularly made nearly every day. On June 15 and 16 Assistant J. F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodesy, was with the party and gave advice and directions concerning the prosecution of the work. On the 17th Assistant Baldwin left the party, turning over the organization to Mr. Tilton, and established necessary bench marks for the continuation of the line in Nebraska, at 16 points, as far as Silver Creek. The line of levels was continued by Mr. Tilton, and at the end of the fiscal year the party had reached Lovewell, Kans., at which time 149 kilometres had been run and 21 bench marks established and connected. Assistant Baldwin returned to Washington on the 21st of June, in compliance with telegraphic instructions of the 16th, and was engaged in the Computing Division until the close of the fiscal year. The personnel of the party is spoken of in high terms by Mr. Baldwin-Mr. B. E. Tilton as recorder, and afterwards as observer; Mr. C. H. Holzwarth as recorder, and Messrs. D. V. Vandiver and G. C. Baldwin as rodmen.

Assistant I. Winston received instructions on the 3d of March, 1898, to resume leveling operations in Colorado. He left Washington on the 15th of April, and arrived at Hugo, Colo., the point of beginning work, on the 19th. On the 1st day of July the work was progressing in the direction of Colorado Springs. It was decided to run a loop, following the line: Limon, Colorado Springs, Denver, and back to Limon; and this long piece of work was successfully accomplished before the end of the season. This was made possible by the fact that the work was greatly facilitated through the use of an observing tent designed by Assistant Winston. The line ran along the Union Pacific Railway to Limon; thence via the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway to Colorado Springs; thence along the Denver and Rio Grande Railway to Denver; thence along the Union Pacific Railway back to Limon. All three railways granted the privilege of using velocipede cars, which procedure saved much time and money to the Government. For this privilege, as well as for numerous courtesies extended, the thanks of this Bureau are due to the managing officers of the railways. . In this season's work differences of elevation were measured greater than in any previous work of the Survey. Connection was made, en route, with two stations of the transcontinental triangulation, namely, Divide and West Base. This was desirable, because a system of vertical angles had been carried through the transcontinental triangulation from the Sierra Nevadas to the Mississippi Valley, and a connection with the spirit levels would supply a much desired test of the vertical angle measures. At Colorado Springs connection was also made with bench marks left by Assistant Eimbeck in measuring differences of elevation between Colorado Springs and Pikes Peak by means of vertical angles. The top of Pikes Peak was also visited, and the bench marks of the cog-wheel railway were connected with marks established by Assistant Eimbeck when he occupied this elevated station as a triangulation point. Moreover, a careful connec186

tion was made checking the vertical angle determination of the elevation of Pikes Peak, through the railway levels. Several connections with United States Geological Survey bench marks established in Denver were made, as well as with the railroad tracks at the Union Depot. The wind is a serious cause of delay in this work, and at least one-third of the time would have been lost if the privilege of using a tent had not been granted by the railroads. The velocipede cars proved economical and expedited the work, as usual. During the season 412 kilometres were run and 50 bench marks established. Assistant Winston reported in Washington on November 15. He was engaged on field records and computations until December 5, and had leave of absence until January 2. Under instructions of Novemb~r 29 he became a member of the committee to consider the subject of precise leveling, and on return to duty, January 2, took an active part in the committee meetings until the final report was submitted, January 24. From this date computations of geographical positions in Chesapeake Bay, from observations by Assistant F. W. Perkins, were made, under the direction of the chief of the Computing Division. This was completed as far as possible in March. Other leveling operations were then taken up until May r. Under instructions of April 7, preparations were made for resuming operations in the field, and on May 5 he left Washington for Denver, Colo., resuming field work on the 12th. This work was continued vvestward until the close of the fiscal year, at which time 1r1 kilometres had been run, and 15 bench marks established.

SUMMARY 01'' OPERATIONS.

July 18 to Sept. 27, 1898.

At Green River, Utah.
9 signals erected. 124 angles measured. 6o observations of longitude. 8 exchanges of signals. I base measured ( 1 130 meters).

At Oasis, Uta/1.
13 signals erected. 76 angles measured. 8 exchanges of signals. 1 base measured(! 669·:; meters).

Under instructions of March 3, 1898, Assistant C.H. Sinclair was directed to make certain geodetic connections in California and Nevada, and also to determine the longitude of Green River and Oasis, in Utah. That part of the work which related to triangulation in the vicinity of Marysville, Cal., and Austin and Eureka, Nev., was completed before the ISt of July, and a description of this work was given in the last annual report. From the 1st of July until the 16th Assistant Sinclair was engaged in overhauling the outfit stored at Salt Lake City, and shipping it to Sau Francisco, in the meantime disposing of the remaining Coast Survey property in Salt Lake City, in order to be able to vacate the storerooms at that place. On Monday, July 18, he proceeded to Green River in order to prepare the longitude station at that place, and to make the geodetic connection at Valley. The material for this work was, of necessity, brought from Salt Lake City, as none could be found near the locality. The longitude station was first prepared, a pier was built, and all the necessary arrangements made for the transmission of signals. While waiting for cooperation by Assistant Fremont Morse, who was officially engaged on other duties at that time, the geodetic connection was made with Valley Knob. A base line was measured on the railroad, 1 130 meters long and a triangulation executed comprising 8 stations. The measurement of the base was effected with a steel tape (No. 17) 30 meters long, under a tension of 5 pounds, indicated by an ordinary spring balance. The tape was laid on the rails and the temperature was noted for each tape length, the change being about ro degrees during the measurement. The at;gles of the triangulation were measured with a 7-inch repea.ting theodolite, provided with 2 verniers, each reading to ro seconds of arc. A meridian line for the orientation of the triangulation was established by astronomical observations, using .the telescope mounted for longitude work. Latitude was determined on four nights, using 16 pairs and making 6o observations. The instrument used was zenith telescope No. 6. On August I the exchange of signals began, Assistant Morse being at Salt Lake

The observers then changed places and four additfonal nights were secured, namely, August 13, 14, 16, and 17. Assistant Morse now proceeded to Oasis and prepared the station. At this point, as at Green River, it was necessary to order all the material from Salt Lake City. Signals were exchanged with the latter place on August 27, 28, 30, and 3r. The observers then changed places and repeated the work on September l, 2, 3, and 4.

A meridian line l 184'5 meters long, laid out with the meridian telescope, furnished an azimuth for the orientation of the triangles. All the necessary field operations being completed, the party left for Ogden and San Francisco on the 28th, reaching the latter place on the 30th. At Green River the geodeti~ connection was made by emplo"ying 9 signals, and measuring 48 horizontal angles. At Oasis, which was connected with Scipio, 13 signals were erected and 76 angles were necessary to establish the result.

From July 1st to 27th Assistant Fremont Morse was engaged in the computation of levels, the field work of which observations had just been completed by him at the close of the last fiscal year. During this time preparations were also made for longitude work in Utah, instructions for which had been issued on the 12th of July. On the 27th he left San Francisco for Salt Lake City, arriving at 1 1 a. 111. of July 29. The instrument was set up in the same afternoon, adjusted in the evening, and on the following day the necessary telegraphic lines were run to the observatory, and the chronograph and auxiliary instruments were put in working order. In the evening star transits were observed to test the adjustments, and everything being in order the first regular observations were made on August 1. Four nights were obtained before the 9th, when an exchange of observers was made, Assistant Sinclair, who was at Green River, coming to Salt Lake, and Assistant Morse going to the former place. Four additional nights were obtained before August I 7. This completed the longitude determination of Green River. Assistant Morse now proceeded to Oasis, which place he reached on the 20th. No material for the construction of observatory or pier being available here, it was necessary to wait the arrival of this from Salt Lake City. The necessary four nights before the exchange of observers were obtained by August 31, and in the meantime latitude observations and those necessary for the determination of the value of the micrometer were made by Assistant Morse. Places were now exchanged by the obser\Ters and four additional nights were obtained by September 4. This closed the determination of the longitude of the two places.

DETAILS OF FIELD WORK.

Green River is situated on the Rio Grande W estem Railroad about 200 miles southeast of Salt Lake, and Oasis is on the Oregon Short Line Railroad, in a direction southwest from the same place. This work has been referred to in a description of Assistant Sinclair's longitude work in Utah. Assistant Morse reported at San Francisco on September 8. During the rest of the month he was engaged in the latitude computations for the station Oasis and other office work. On October r telegraphic instructions were sent him to relieve Assistant W. B. Fairfield, in the party of Assistant Mosman, operating in southern California on triangulation. Leaving San Francisco on the 5th of October,·he reported to Assistant Mosman on the 7th. From this time until February 2, 1899, he was engaged in triangulation, occupying the stations Castro, Wilsons Peak, and Soledad, at the latter

On Jaimary 27 Assistant Morse received instructions to take up the topographic work around San Francisco Bay, three sheets remaining to complete the survey. .The first sheet, which lay north of the bay, between Sausalito and San Quentin; was finished

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

between February 23 and May 29. The two other sheets were on the west, or ocean, side of San Francisco Peninsula, and extended from the Golden Gate southward nearly to Point San Pedro. In order to obtain points for the lower sheet a triangulation was necessary. This started from the base line Cement-;Presidio Hill and was carried southward, occupying three old stations, namely: Cement, Presidio Hill, and Black Ridge, and determining two new ones by concluded angles, namely: Lone Mountain cross and Ocean House flagstaff; and determining, by occupation, seven additional new ones, namely: Black Bluff, Colma, San Bruno, Fog Cap, Road, Flat, and False Cattle Hill. This triangulation is shown on the preceding sketch, together with the region covered by the three topographical sheets. After the execution of the triangulation observations the computations of geographical positions were made. While this was in progress signals were erected for the planetable work, and the topographic work proper was begun on June 28. This was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

34 square miles triangulation. 14 triangulation stations occupied. 55 geographic positions determined. l 1 square miles topography. 43 miles coast shore line. 19 miles roads. 2 topographic sheets, scale 1: 20 000-10 ooo5 000. 17 square geographic miles hydrography. 993 geographic miles sounding lines. 16 299 angles measured. 6 tidal stations established. 2 hydrographicsheets,scale r :40 000 1 r :20 ooo, l : JO 000 1 and i: 5 ooo.

In order to take up hydrographic work on the coast of Washington, Assistant F. W estdahl was instructed on June 2 r to organize a party. The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Gedney was assigned to this work, and was formally turned over by Assistant Rodgers to Assistant Westdahl on the uth of July. Considerable difficulty was experienced in enlisting a crew, and it was not until the 28th that the vessel was brought from San Antonio Estuary, where she had been lying for some time, to San Francisco for coal and stores. She was ready for sea by August 8, and was personally inspected by the Superintendent at this time, who happened to be in San Francisco. On August 9 she steamed across the ranges and made the necessary observations for adjustment of compass. On the roth the party sailed for Grays Harbor, arriving on the 18th, after having made short stops at Port Orford and Astoria. Hydrography and topography were executed here, the fonner near Grays Harbor light-house and opposite Cape Elizabeth, some miles to the north of it; the latter on both sides of the entrance to the harbor and for a sh~rt distance to the north and south of it. The object of the topographical work was to survey the shore line and to locate the Government improvements. The hydrographic and topographic work at the entrance to the harbor were not quite finished. S. Doc. 454--13 193

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18<)8-<)9.

The work off Cape Elizabeth, begun by Lieutenant Crosby iri 1 894, was continued, but it was not completed. At the end of the season the vessel sailed from Grays Harbor on the 23d of October for San Diego, Cal. She arrived there on November 4, having stopped at San Francisco on the way. The object o.f the work at San Diego was to execute the topography from the· entrance to the city front, including the shore line and the Government improvements. The hydrography contemplated was the bar at the entrance to the channel, up to and including the San Diego City front. The ship was moored at La Playa on November 8. As a preliminary to the hydrography two tide gauges were established, one at La Playa and another at the end of the jetty outside of the entrance. Simultaneous observations were made during twenty-five hours to obtain the difference of time and range of tide, to be used in reducing soundings outside of the bay. In order that the hydrographic work might be taken up as soon as possible, points were determined by the plane table, which gave all the required accuracy for this work. The work outside of Ballast Point was done with the steam launch under direction of Mr. Crowley, the executive officer, while the inside hydrography was executed by Mr. Woolf, second watch officer, using the whale boat. Assistant Westdahl, with two men and a dingey, took up the topography, which was finished by the end of November. Many adverse circumstances impeded the progress of the hydrographic work, among which may be mentioned that the steam launch was three times hoisted from the water for repairs. She lost her propeller while doing outside work on December 6, and twice the Gedney was obliged to leave her moorings at La Playa and anchor at San Diego on account of violent gales. The hydrography was practically finished in December, but on December 28 the party was authorized to extend the work so as to include the hydrography of the water front of the city of San Diego. On December 30 instructions were given to determine, by triangulation, objects for compass range, permanent aids to navigation, etc., and this was executed with as little delay as possible. On the 14th of January the ship was moved to San Diego. Topographic work continued during the greater part of February. Hydrographic work was also continued to the extent of filling in lines and doing patchwork, which was required for a more complete development of the proposed undertaking. On February 26 the vessel sailed from San Diego and arrived at San Pedro next morning. Both hydrography and topography were included in the work projected for this place. Im topography the terminal beach and entrance to the harbor, mainly shore line and jetties, were taken up. In hydrography the entrance to the inner harbor was developed and extended to include the location of proposed breakwater. As at San Diego, the hydrographic signals were determined with the plane table in order that the sounding might suffer no delay. Hydrography began March 3 by the whaleboat in charge of Mr. Woolf. A clrn,e examination of the mouth of the channel to the inner harbor was made, in order to find, if possible, the sounding of 1376 feet recorded on the Coast and Geodetic Survey chart. At the request of Captain Meyler, Corps of Engineers, U.S. A., the work was extended to cover the area o_f the proposed breakwater. Hydrographic work was carried on, both

by the steam launch and the whaleboat, until the collapse of the former on April 3. The work was finished by the whaleboat. All the proposed operations at San Pedro having been completed, the Gedney sailed for San Francisco on the 5th of April, arrivjng on the 7th. Necessary repairs were immediately undertaken, which occupied the time until April 17, when, in compliance with instructions of March 16, she proceeded to Point Richmond for hydrographic work in the neighborhood of Brooks Island. Sounding was begun on the 3d of May, but on account of unfavorable weather conditions only the time before noon could be utilized for this work. On May 7 instructions were received to have tlie ship inspected by a local United States inspector of steam vessels, and to prepare her for work in Alaska nearthe Aleutian Islands. The inspection was completed by May 1 1 and the vessel was taken to Oakland Harbor, where necessary repairs could be made and the plotting of the San Diego work could be taken up. The repairs were finished on the 16th of June. On the 23d, Assistants ·Dickins and Westdahl formally exchanged commands in the presence of the Inspector of Hydrography and Topography, Assistant Westdahl taking the McArtlzur and Assistant Dickins the Gedney. Assistant Westdahl speaks in high terms of Mr. B. J. Crowley, who as executive officer discharged his duties with marked ability.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

44 hydrographic signals erected. 16 695 angles measured. I 36g miles sounding lines. 21 tidal stations occupied.

Assistant E. F. Dickins began work, on the 1st of July, on the southern part of San Francisco Bay, near South Belmont, relieving Assistant Westdahl, who had charge of the party up to that time. Operations continued in this locality until the 6th of September, when the party moved to Menlo Oyster Camp. The work was pursued here until the 1st of October, when Assistant Dickins took charge of the steamer McArthur. After having enlisted a crew, he returned, on October 10, to Dumbarton Point, where the work was continued until November 16. At this date it was completed to the southward and the vessel moved to Redwood City Creek. The entire southern portion of San Francisco Bay was finished by the 17th of January. Before the work was done instructions had been issued, under date of December 30, to begin operations in San Pablo Bay. This was taken up after the completion of the southern work, and, incidentally to the regular operations, the position was located of an extra channel buoy on Penole Shoal. The position of Buoy No. 7 and the beacon at the entrance of Mare Island Straits were also determined, at the request of the commandant of the Mare Island NavyYard. In addition to this, at the request of Major Davis, the proper position for a new beacon at the mouth of the Mare Island Straits was marked, and the new beacon in Petaluma Channel was determined. The work in this locality was finished on April r r, the operations in Petaluma Creek continuing until May 24. The vessel was docked at the Union Iron Ship Works on June 2 for repairs. Preparations for the Alaska work and other incidental duties consumed the rest of the fiscal year. Among the duties just mentioned may be stated the reduction of the work of Lieut. Commander Osborn, U. S. N., who was formerly in command of the McArthur. Assistant Dickins, as a result of his experience, makes note of the fact that the best season for work in San Francisco Bay is during the winter months. At this time there is some rain, but good weather exists between the storms, whereas in summer one is liable to have northwest winds and a choppy sea at all times, as well as fog, and straight lines of sounding are almost impossible.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIOSS.

Sec Mosman, Cal. triang., p. 198; Sinclair, Cal.-Nev. boundary, p. 223.

On the 1st of July, 1898, Assistant \V. B. Fairfield was attached to the party of Assistant A. T. Mosman, doing primary triangulation in southern California, from Santa Barbara to the Mexican line. The station Santa Cruz E., on Santa Cruz Island, 1 was occupied between July 5 and August 8. No connection could be had with the mainland until August 15, when the party and outfit left for the station Laguna. \Vhile the camp was being established at this place, Assistant Fairfield was engaged in posting heliotropes at Castro, San Pedro, and San Fernando. Operations at Laguna began on September 6; they were completed on the 18th. On the following day camp was moved to Castro. From September 20 to October 10, while the outfit was en route and being established at the latter station, signals were erected at~d heliotropes posted on Wilsons Peak. A line was also cut on Mount Lowe, and a pole erected on San Jacinto 1 1 ooo feet high and very difficult of access. On October 1 1 instructions were received to report to Assistant C. H. Sinclair, at San Francisco, for duty on the California and Nevada boundary line. 'In compliance with these instructions the party was turned over at Castro, on October 15, to Assistant Morse, wbo had been detailed to take charge of the work. Assistant Fairfield proceeded to San Francisco on October 18, reported to Assistant Sinclair, and was attached to his party until the 25th of June, 1899. During this time the work on the California and Nevada boundary comprised triangulation from station T 105 (Ash Meadows) to the Colorado River, connecting also with the triangulation coming northwest from Needles, executed by Assistant Fairfield in I 93. On February 17 the party started back, correcting the line as they proceeded, and building cairns and mounds to mark the final stations. The cairns were from 4 to 6 ~ feet high, and 5 feet in diameter at the base. When stones were not available, earth mounds were made around a post. All stations were marked with drill holes in solid rock, when possible. This work lasted until the 18th of June, and on the final completion of the boundary work, which took place on the 25th of June, Mr. Fairfield reported to Assistant Mosman, at San Juan station, under instructions dated June 6, and was attached to his party until the end of the fiscal year. The triangulation on the California and Nevada boundary line was executed by Assistant Fairfield.

During the latter part of the fiscal year 1897-98 Assistant A. T. Mosman was in southern California, engaged in a reconnoissance from Santa Barbara to the Mexican boundary. This reconnoissance, which covered more than 10 ooo square miles, was executed between March 11 and May 23. During this time 61 lines of intervisibility were determined, and 21 points were selected for stations. A double party was contemplated for the execution of the triangulation, and at the beginning of the fiscal year 1898-99 both parties were to be found at the western extremity of this work; the first, under the immediate direction of Assistant Mosman, was at Santa Barbara; and the second, a cooperation party in charge of Assistant W. B. Fairfield, was at Santa Cruz E. From this time until the 9th of February observations went on uninterruptedly, and the work was carried from the aforesaid line, Santa BarbaraSanta Cruz E., to Soledad, in the vicinity of San Diego. With a view of prosecuting the work more rapidly the double party was put in the field: the one under Assistant Mosman commencing with the stations Santa Barbara, Chaffee, Santa Clam, and San Fernando; the other under Assistant Fairfield taking up the stations Santa Cruz E. and Laguna. Santa Barbara was completed on August 5, and the camp on this date was moved to Chaffee. Observations were made here between the 19th and 28th of August, and

the camp was moved to Santa Clara, at which station the outfit and instruments were hauled to the top on sleds, overcoming a vertical distance of 2 250 feet. Observations at Santa Clara were in progress from September 9 to 18. In the meantime Assistant Fairfield had finished Santa Cruz E. on August 8. He left the island on the I 7th and proceeded to Laguna (elevation l 442 feet). This station was finished on September 22. While moving his camp to Castro opportunity was taken to open lines and build tripods for heliotropes at Wilsons Peak (5 700 feet) 1 and San Jacinto (10 800 feet). Assistant Mosman observed at San Fernando from October 6 to l l. Assistant Fremont Morse, who had been ordered to relieve Assistant Fairfield, under instructions from the superintendent, reported to Assistant Mosman on October 7. At this time Mr. Fairfield was still absent on his trip to San Jacinto. He returned on the 12th, and the following day Assistants Morse and Fairfield proceeded to Castro, where the former made the necessary observations between the 15th and 25th. The instruments were now sent to Wilsons Peak, and while they were in transit heliotropes were posted at San Juan, Niguel, and Santiago, and a pole was erected at San Bernardino ( 10 300 feet). This signal was erected over a cairn marking· the initial point of the principal meridian of the land survey of southern California. The determination of its geographical position was therefore of prime importance to the State work in southern California, and the opportunity was embraced to make a careful determination. Assistant Mosman, who had finished observations at San Fernando on October l l, now moved to San Pedro, and was engaged at this point between November 2 and 19 in the measurement of horizontal angles. Leveling was also undertaken, and the difference of height between the bench mark at San Pedro and the triangulation station on San Pedro Hill was determined between November 17 and December 2. These observations suffered considerable delay on account of bad weather. After the conclusion of the work here the party moved to Niguel, and observations were made at the latter place between December 10 and 25, the transportation from San Pedro to Niguel occupying the time between November 27 and December 5. At the conclusion of the observations at Niguel the party proceeded to Soledad. This point was chosen for an astronomical station as well, and therefore time, latitude, and azimuth were undertaken, in addition to the usual horizontal and vertical angles. After the execution of any system of triangulation, if the greatest accuracy is to be attained it is necessary to check the geographical positions obtained from the measurement of horizontal angles by an astronomical determination of the terminal points. No check of this nature had been obtained for some time, and it was, therefore, desirable, before determining the boundary line between the United States and Mexico, to supplement the work by astronomical determinations, both as a check on the triangulation and as a means of bringing out any anoma1ies in the deflections of the plumb line caused by an irregular distribution of the matter composing the earth's crust. Signals were erected and connection made with the old light-house at Point Loma and with Monument No. 258 on the Mexican boundary, which marks its termination at the Pacific coast. An azimuth mark was erected in the vertical of Polaris at western elongation, 7.6 miles from Soledad. The first observations for horizontal and vertical angles were made on January 7; for time and latitude, on the 14th; the horizontals were finished on the 24th and the latitude on the 25th. The old light-house was

occupied on the 25th and Monument No. 258 on the 26th. Azimuth observations were made on February 6, 7, 8, and 9 which closed the work for the season. Assistant Morse left for San Francisco on February 2, under instructions from the Superintendent. The camp outfit was shipped, in part, to the suboffice at San Francisco, and in part to Los Angeles, to be placed in store for use in the next season's work. The duplicate records were sent to Washington as fast as the stations were occupied, and the original records were deposited in the suboffi.ce at San Francisco for safe-keeping. Assistant Mosman arrived at the latter place on February 25. During the season's work one hundred and fifteen days were devoted to the observations at the stations ; two hundred and fourteen days were required to move between stations, construct roads, and do other necessary preliminary work. Twenty days were lost at Santa Barbara and Santa Cruz E., through fog; three or four were unavailable at Laguna and Chaffee, from the same cause; and at San Pedro, Niguel, and Soledad nearly a month was lost on account of rain, clouds, and fog. In carrying out the observations in this work Assistant Mosman departed to a certain extent froin the usual methods. This was done with the view of securing results equal in accuracy with less work, and consisted in observing three sets in each of four positions of the theodolite. These were arranged in the following form : -- - - - ---- --- ----- -----1

To meet the objection that the equal division of 60 degrees among 12 positions would make the reading on the point always come on the same part of the 5-minute graduation, the twelfth part of a space was added to each position, so that the distance between two successive positions was 5° o' 25 11 · When it was possible to divide the observations equally between a. m. and p. 111. work it was done by so taking the positions that the result for each set should contain an equal number of each class. In general, however, no striking difference was found between the a. m. and p. m. results. The results, as regards the closing of triangles, compared favorably with those obtained, with the same instrumennts, in the Alleghanies, but the probable error was somewhat larger. The heliotropes at the different stations were shown from sunrise to 9 a. m. and from 3 p. m. until sunset ; and during these hours all the horizontal angle observations

were made. Signals were also shown between 1 1 a. m. and 1 p. m., and at this time the vertical angles were measured. They consisted in, first, six measures of zenith distances, followed at once by six measures of nadir distances; and the mean of the two results was accepted. Assistant Mosman speaks in the highest terms of the zeal, energy, and industry of Mr. Arthur W. Lewis, who served as recorder from July to February 11. Mr. E. E. Torrey, foreman, was with the party from December 16 to March 20, and as usual rendered valuable service. Between May 15 and 26, under instructions of May 4, Assistant Mosman prepared to resume work in southern California. He arrived at Los Angeles on May 27. Organizing the party and posting heliotropes occupied the time until June 5. Camp was pitched at San Juan on June 13. Between June 10 and 30 the trail was built up Sa1i Jacinto Mountain, 12 miles long, with a vertical rise of 6 ooo feet. The instruments were mounted at San Juan on the 15th of June, and the first observations were made the following day. The coast fog greatly delayed the observations on Niguel and San Pedro, but Wilsons Peak, San Jacinto, and Santiago showed above the fog and were satisfactorily observed. Observations at San Juan were finished on June 27. Assistant Fairfield reported on the same date, and left for the occupation of San Jacinto on the 30th of June.

4 elevations determined by spirit leveling. miles of double-line spirit leveling.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Assistant J. J. Gilbert had just finished the observation of vertical angles at Pine Hill, Eldorado County, Cal. In order to connect this work with the vertical angles of the transcontinental triangulation, a line of levels was necessary from Truckee to Mount Lola. This was undertaken on Julys, and was carried on without interruption until the 26th. On the 28th a line of levels was run from the Southern Pacific Railroad car shops, Sacramento, to bench mark in State capitol, which was established by Assistant Morse when occupying the dome for vertical angles. The line was run forward and back, connecting both ways with the railroad tide gauge on Sacramento River. From July 29 to September 12 the time was spent in making a report on the season's work, reviewing and duplicating the level records, and making computations, clear copies, etc., of the vertical-angle measures at Pine Hill. These records were sent, in duplicate, to Washington early in September. On the 12th he received instructions to report in Washington after the expiration of his leave of absence. Arriving on the 19th, he was immediately assigned to duty in the Computing Division, where he remained until the 14th of March. From this time to the 22d he was acting as president of the board appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct the speed-trial tests of the Coast a~d Geodetic Sun·ey steamer Pathfinder. On the 22d he returned to the Computing Division, remaining here until the 12th of May, when he was instructed to take temporary charge of the steamer Endeavor, during the convalescence of Assistant Yates. On the 29th instructions were issued for him to proceed to Seattle, relieving Assistant F. A. Young of the charge of the suboffice. He arrived there on the 13th of June. Under instructions he proceeded to Lopez Island, and there made shipment of magnetic instruments at that point to Washington. Returning on the 18th, he took charge of the suboffice, and was engaged in collecting piaterial for the new map of Seattle, attending to the marigraph, etc., until the end of the fiscal year.

Assistant A. F. Rodgers has been in charge of the suboffice at San Francisco during the entire fiscal year. He had also charge of the tidal and astronomical stations at the Presidio, and of the steamers Patterson and McArthur, laid up temporarily at Oakland Harbor. Arrangements for the construction of the tidal indicator in San Francisco Harbor were also made under his direction. Among the many duties performed by him were: Reports on the steam launches belonging to the Patterson and llfcArthur; correspondence with the contractor for the building of the steamer Taku; duty pertaining to the Santa Barbara speed-trial courses, transmitted to the Union Iron Works; outfitting the steamer McArthur, transferred to Dickins on October 1; submitting estimates for repairs to tide gauge; report on examination of several sites for the International Geodetic Association latitude station at Ukiah, and correspondence as to marking the channel in San Pablo Bay to facilitate taking the U. S. S. Iowa to Mare Island Navy Yard. On April · 1, having visited Ukiah, he made a report on the site available for the International Geodetic Association latitude station, and on the 20th accepted an offer from Mr. George Luce, of Ukiah, to sell one-half of a 5-acre tract to the association. On August 17 a contract was entered into with the San Francisco Bridge Company to construct a tidal indicator on the southeastern extremity of Alcatraz Island. In addition to other duties during the year, on Saturdays tidal data were distributed to seven daily papers for publication.

Mar. 25 to Mar. 30, 1899.

From the 1st of July, 1898, to the 15th of October, Assistant F. A. Young was attached to the party of Assistant J. F. Pratt, engaged in making a survey of a portion of the Yukon Delta. He continued in this party until the close of the season; and on the arrival at Seattle of the party, on the 15th of October, was assigned to duty in the suboffice at that place, being engaged principally in computing the triangulation and other work pertaining to the season's work. It having been reported that there was a rock in the direct track of vessels of the Navy going from Admiralty Inlet to the Puget Sound naval station, and that less water was to be found than indicated on the chart, Assistant Young was directed to make an examination of the locality. The reef alluded to is known as Bainbridge Reef, and is situated in Richs Passage. A small steam tug was chartered on March 25, and Assistant Young proceeded with his party to the locality in order to secure such triangulation stations as might be needed for locating the reef, besides establishing and locating other necessary points. After the preliminary work had been completed, eight lines of soundings were run, each being from 500 to 900 metres in length, and intersecting near the spot. A line was then run encircling the central point, in order to define more exactly the limits of the reef. A number of soundings were made to determine its extent, the result of which was that the reef was found to be oval in shape and about 85 metres long and 50 metres wide. The least water to be found is on the extreme western edge, and the soundings range from 5 fathoms 4 feet to 8 fathoms. The investigation shows that there is enough water on the reef to float the deepest draft vessel at low water. It is entirely possible that there may be a sharp pinnacle that projects above the highest point found, but none such was developed by the soundings. There is no doubt, however, that this pinnacle, if it exists, is well within the limits of the reef, and can easily be avoided by vessels. Ou April 20 Assistant Young succeeded Mr. Pratt in charge of the suboffice, Mr.R. B. Derickson, Aid, also remaining attached to the office. Most of the time was taken up by work pertaining to the Yukon River Delta survey, where a good deal of information pertaining to Alaska was given to sea captains and others. On June 27, 1899, Assistant Young joined the steamer Patterson, in command of Assistant J. F. Pratt, the ship sailing for St. Michael on July 3.

GRAVITY.

Feb. 4 to Feb. 16, 1899.

During the winter of 1898-99 Assistant G. R. Putnam was charged with the determination of the relative forces of gravity at the State University, near Seattle, Wash., and at the high school in that city. The two places being very near the same degree of latitude, the principal object in the observations was to bring out any local deviations from the assumed force of gravity. At the State University the time necessary for these determinations was obtained from star observations, while at the high school in Seattle the chronometers were rated by telegraph noon signals sent out from the Mare Island Navy-Yard, in California. The result of the work furnishes an interesting test of the reliability of signals sent by telegraph over a long distance. If all the discrepancies between the two days' observations at the high school be ascribed to a change of rate, there would be an uncertainty of only 0·14 second per day in this quantity. The observations at the State University were rather unsatisfactory on account of unfavorable temperature conditions. The result, however, confirms previous experience that scarcely any measurable difference in the force of gravity may be expected between stations within a few miles of each other. The station at the high school was almost identical with tha~ of l 891, and the results differ 01~ly by irinrlirH part. The observations at Seattle confirm the result previously brought out-that when the force of gravity is corrected simply for the elevation above sea level and a comparison is made with the theoretical value there appears a greater defect of this quantity than has been observed elsewhere on the coasts of North America. The result is undoubtedly related to the unusual topographic situation, the town being situated on a great sound, almost encircled by high mountains. The difference of latitude between the two places is 3 minutes and 5 seconds. The difference of elevation is 16 metres, and we have for the computed defect o' the force of gravity at the State University 0·131 of a dyne and atthe high schoolo·r30.

During the rush to the Klondike region in l 897, consequent upon the gold discoveries on Bonanza Creek, it is estimated that between thirty and forty thousand people entered the Yukon territory via the Chilkoot and White Pass routes. This made it incumbent on our service to so develop the geography of the region that the commercial interests of Alaska should be adequately subserved. Two parties were therefore sent to the head of Lynn Canal under the direction of Assistant J. A. Flemer. The first party, under Mr. Flemer's personal supervision, took the country to the west and began a reconnoissance of the Chilkat River Valley and the adjoining territory. The second party, under Assistant John Nelson, gave attention to the Katsehin River Valley, lying to the eastward of the head of Lynn Canal. These parties began work during the summer of 1898 and were at work at the beginning of the fiscal year 1898-99 in the localities mentioned. Both parties, during the entire season, covered an area of about 500 square miles, including the valleys of the following rivers: Chilkat, Tsirku, Tlehini, Katsehin, Skagway, and Dyea. Numerous tributaries of these branches were also explored. The work on the Chilkat aud on the Katsehin was finished by July 17. The former involved the occupation of six camera stations in the mountains and two in the Chilkat River Valley. This was done between July 8 and 13. The iconometric plotting of the work was performed at the Office between April 8 and May 9, 1899. The Chilkat sheet shows the famous Dalton Trail from the Tsirku River .to the bend in the Tlehini River. It crosses the watershed between the Chilkat and the Alsek drainage systems at an elevation of a~out 3 ooo feet. 'l'his ~nrvey embraces the Porcupine gold clistric~. At the conclusion of the aforesaid work both parties were towed by lighters to Skagway. Assistant Nelson and party landed here and undertook the topographical reconnoissance of the valley of this name. Assistant Flemer, with party, continued on to Dyea for the purpose of developing this entrance to the Yukon territory. Old stations established by Assistant Pratt in 1894, near the head of Dyea Inlet, were recovered, and photo-topographic stations occupied in the valley were connected with these points by triangulation, using the line between "Grunt" and "Court" as a base.

Reconnoissance of the lower valley was finished, including a survey of the town of Dyea, by August 10. The camp was then moved 5 miles upstream to Rosedale, whi,ch operation required three days' heavy packing, as every wagon in Dyea was engaged in commercial transportation on account of the recent gold discoveries. On August 23 the camp was moved to Canyon City, and no further change was made until the end of the season. Side trips were made up both valleys containing the headwaters of the Dyea River. Eleven elevated camera stations were successfully occupied in Dyea Valley, and seven lower ones in tf1e valley bottom. Triangulation was made as far as practicable, and a rough traverse line was run through the canyon, between Canyon City and Sheep Camp. Much difficulty was experienced with the weather, only thirteen days without rain occurring between July r and September 9. The area was charted on a scale of r :80 ooo. The necessity for new maps in such a region may be understood from the rapid transfonnation taking place. In August, 1897, but three wooden buildings were to be seen at Skagway. September of the same year found hundreds of tents on the ground, and. in January, 1898, 700 buildings and over 3 ooo inhabitants made up the existing town. Many of the convenieHces of civilization are evident on all sides, including an electric-light plant, the power for which is derived from a mountain lake. Assistant Nelson's work in the Skagway River Valley consisted of a detailed map of the town of Skagway, on a scale of l: 20 ooo, and a topographical survey of the valley from the town to White Pass: on a scale of l :80 ooo. This map includes the White Pass and Yukon. Railroad. From the summit of White Pass to the head of Lake Bennett there is a pack trail which joins, at the latter point, the old trail leading from the Chilkoot Pass. The Chilkoot route is shorter, but the one through White Pass offers better transportation facilities and crosses the Divide about I loo feet lower than the one through Chilkoot. On the Dyea route, the Chilkoot wagon road follows the old Indian trail very closely. The wagon road leads from Dyea to Canyon City, a distance of 9 miles, crossing the stream many times by fords and bridges. From Canyon City an aerial wire tramway conveys merchandise, in wooden boxes or buckets, over the Chilkoot Pass to Crater Lake. A pack-trail also leads from Canyon City to The Scales, at the foot of the Chilkoot Pass. From Sheep Camp to The Scales, about 2 Yz miles, the rise is r 600 feet; from The Scales to the Summit, a distance of about 3 ooo feet, the increase in height is at least l ooo feet. The last 500 feet of this route is very steep. The drawing shown on the Dyea sheet is based on 60 photographs, taken from l 8 camera stations; while that on the Chilkat sheet is from 42 photographic negatives obtained also from 18 camera..stations.

In order to push the Alaska work as rapidly as possible, a cooperating party was assigned to Assistant Flemer in the work near the head of Lynn Canal. .This was under the immediate direction of Assistant John Nelson, who had in charge a phototopographic and plane table survey of the Katsehin and Skagway rivers and the country lying between the head of Lynn Canal and the summit of White Pass. Assistant Nelson was attached to the party of Assistant Flemer until October 3, at which date they had arrived at Washington from the head of Lynn Canal. Office work . was tz.ken up, and between October 4 and December 3 the time was devoted to the triangulation computations and to developing photographic negatives of the season's work. For additional reference to work of Assistant Nelson, see details of field work by Assistant Flemer's party. Assistant Nelson had leave of absence from December 4 to 13. He was then assigned tp the steamer Blake, under the command of Assistant \V. C. Hodgkins, for duty in Porto Rico. His work here consisted of astronomical determinations, triangulation, and topography, a report of which will be found in a description of the season's work by Assistant Hodgkins. Assistant Nelson was detached on June 20, 1899, and remained on duty in Washington until June 30, preparing estimates for field work in Porto Rico and on Chesapeake Bay.

The entrance to the Copper River has assumed, within the past few years, an importance much greater than it previously had. In order to develop the geography of this region, a Coast and Geodetic Survey party was sent there in the summer of 1898. Landing in the vicinity of Orea on May 22, Assistant H. P. Ritter, under whose direction the operations were being conducted, immediately began a triangulation of the surrounding country. His party consisted of E. B. Latha'm, Assistant; H. C. Denson, Aid; one foreman, and eight hands. Astronomical observations were made at several points, notably at Orea and at Kokinhenic. The work lasted from the end of May to the beginning of October, and comprised a survey of the delta and vicinity, roughly embracing about 1 ooo square miles. The triangulation, of which the base was in the vicinity of Kokinhenic astronomical station, covers the entire delta, and many observations were taken on the S. Doc. 454--r4 2CXJ

mountains lying to the east, north, and west. This work served to locate them in position and to determine their heights. Hydrographic examinations were made at the mouth of the river and other places. The plane-table work covered the shore line, positions of sloughs, reefs, etc., and the tidal observations were used in reducing the hydrographic work. Meteorological observations were also made, as well as magnetic observations, at Orea and at a point in the middle of the delta. A large part of the topography was executed by application of the photo-topographic method. A map on a scale of 1: 80 ooo was prepared from the results of the season's work. The scientific operations, stated somewhat more in detail, were as follows: A base line of I 697 meters was measured on Kokinhenic Island, with a 50-meter steel tape. The triangulation was extended from the base line in such directions and for such distances as to control the area of the delta. Observations for elevation of mountain peaks were made by the measurement of double zenith distances of each peak, from several stations. These observations were made by Aid H. C. Denson. The latitude and longitude of Orea was determined, the former by the observation of 9 pairs of stars, 29 determinations being secured in all. The longitude depends on the transportation of chronometers determiniug a sea rate from observations at San Francisco and Seattle and a land rate after having carried the chronometer ashore and made sufficient observations for this purpose. A second astronomical station was made at Kokinhenic, at which both latitude and longitude were determined. No azimuth observations, however, were obtained at either Orea or Kokinhenic Island. A third astronomical station was made at station "Pete," at which only latitude determinations were made. Tidal observations were carried on at all stations occupied by the party, namely: Orea. Kokinhenic, Pete Dahl Slough, and Eyak River. These observations were made in such a way that the series for consecutive stations overlap, thus fixing the relation between the tides at the two stations. At both Orea and Kokinhenic magnetic observations were made, those in the former place on May 27, 28, and 29, and in the latter on June 19, 20, and 2I. The photo-topographic camera was continually used and the necessary developing accessories were carried along, so that the negatives were largely developed in the field. Owing to the general unfavorableness of tht:: weather, 110 systemati'c scheme could be carried out, although a large amount of valuable data was obtained. One hundred and eighty views were taken with the topographic camera and 88 with an ordinary view camera. This work was largely executed by Assistant E. B. Latham. Speaking generally, it may be said that the triangulation was executed chiefly by Aid H. C. Denson, the astronomical and photographic wotk by Assistant E. B. Latham, and the topography, hydrography, and magnetic work by the chief of party. The country in the vicinity of the mouth of the Copper River, as seen when approaching it from the sea, has the appearance of a vast mountain range, whose tops are covered with perpetual snow. Innumerable glaciers move down the mountain sides and fill the deeply-cut canyons. From the head of the delta to the ocean reef is a distance of about 25 miles. The delta is 50 miles wide and the mountains range from 1 ooo to 8 ooo feet in elevation. The fiats at the mouth of the river are cut up into numerous islands by the many tidal sloughs and small streams flowing from the

glaciers. Many interesting features may be noted in regard to this particular locality, among which may be mentioned the violent winds, which begin during the month of September and last with little intermission through the winter until early spring. They are of such violence that it is impossible for anyone to cross the delta while they prevail. The body of water intervening between the flats and the ocean reefs is navigable to boats drawing from 3 to 4 feet of water, and is, in places, navigable to these only at high tide. By the receding tide an area of about 250 square miles is completely drained, and the surface presents nothing but one unbroken expanse of mud. The currents during the rising tide are extremely swift, as the ocean reef acts as a barrier until the water rises over it, when it flows in with great rapidity. The average temperature of the delta during the months of June, July, and August was found to be about 50° F. During the month of September it is 10° less, accompanied by freezing weather during the nights. The vegetation is very marked. On the flats are found flowers and marsh grass. On the sand dunes are alders, berry bushes, and cottonwood trees; while on the mountain side hemlock and firs grow in abundance. From the head of the delta to where the river leaves the marsh and spreads out over the mud flats it flows nearly south, is about 5 miles wide, and consists of numerous changeable channeb, varying in depth from 5 to 20 feet. The river breaks through the mountain range about 30 miles from the coast, and is here flanked on the east side by Miles Glacier and on the west by Childs Glacier. In this vicinity are the rapids, which form an insurmountable barrier to all kinds of upstream navigation except in canoes. The most western branch of the delta is known as the Alaganik Slough, being the most extensively traveled and important branch of the river. Its length is about 15 miles, and it varies in width from one-half to 1 mile, with depths from 5 to 15 feet, depending on the stage of the tide. This branch is a tidal stream. The average tide at the lower end during the stay of Assistant Ritter's party was about 10 feet, while at Alaganik, at the upper end, the tide was from 2 to 3 feet. The navigation of this branch is facilitated by the fact that during flood tide the direction of the current is east, while at ebb tide it is west. This effect is felt as far as Alaganik. There exist on the Copper River Delta two large canneries-One at Orea and another at Odiak. The fishing season begins about May and ends with July. During this time each cannery turns out about 30 ooo cases.

The importance of more complete knowledge of the route to the gold fields of Alaska made it incumbent upon this service to thoroughly explore the mouth of the Yukon. Early in June of the last fiscal year Assistant J. F. Pratt, with a large and well-equipped party, left Seattle for St. Michael, where they arrived on the 29th. The greater part of the party was taken on the U. S. S. Wheeling, while several members were left behind to superintend the shipment of freight and supplies. Two small steamers were taken along, one of which was transported in pieces and was put together on the beach after landing at St. Michael. On June 30 the party moved ashore and went into camp. The following day signal lumber was purchased at the

rate of $100 per thousand, and .the actual work of the season immediately began-. It may be stated, parenthetically, that freight for the use, of this party was delivered from Seattle at the rate of $12.50 per ton and lumber at $20 per thousand, but as some delay occurred it was necessary to purchase enough lumber on the ground to begin operations at once. Coal cost $ 17 per ton delivered on the beach at St. Michael. The steamer Nelson, with the stores, material, and outfit, and having on board the steamer Yukon, already mentioned as having been shipped in pieces, arrived on the 3d of July. On the 11th enough material was on shore to begin laying the keel. This continued until the 15th, when the Taku arrived in a disabled condition. In order that she might begin work as soon as possible, all available force was diverted from the Yukon and put upon the Taku, and on the 30th she was able to be sent to sea. \Vork was now resumed on the Yukon, and she was launched August 20, forty-one days after laying her keel. Subtracting the time given to the Taku and other unavoidable matters, twenty-nine day::;' work were required to put the Yukon together. She was put in commission immediately, and on August 23 stores and equipment were on board, and at 2. 15 a. m. she started for the mouth of the Kwiklok by way of the Aproon Mouth. She was engaged at this point until September 10, being officered by Assistant J. F. Pratt, with Assistant Faris, detached from the Taku, and Foreman Van Wyck. On July 18 Assistant Baldwin, with Aid Derickson and Foreman Pratt, started with camping outfit, on board scow, to take up work from the southern end of St. Michael Island and to continue it to the Aproon Mouth. This work had already been carried from .Camp Pritchett, in St. Michael Harbor, to the southern end of the island while the party was still in camp and engaged in outfitting and launching the Yukon and preparing the Taku for her work. When the party arrived at the Aproon Mouth the scow was taken in tow by the Yukon and carried to the mouth of the Kwiklok. The repairs to the Taku were completed on August 1, the stores were placed aboard, and at 2 p. m. she set sail, with Assistants Putnam, Faris, and Young and Foreman Edmonds. The first work consisted in the occupation of Stevens triangulation point on St. Michael Island and the erection of a signal on the highest peak of Stuart Island. Then, going to the mouth of the Kwiklok, the regular work of the season was begun and prosecuted until the 26th of August, when the Yukon arriyed. In going south a running reconnoissance of the Aproon was made to the head of the Passes, then down the Kwiklok to the mouth, where the camp was established. On August 26th the Taku, with a steam launch, was sent around to the Kripniyuk in order to make a reconnoissance of this locality both as regards hydrography and topography. She returned on the 7th of September. On the 10th the camping party of Assistant Baldwin, which had been employed near the mouth of the Kwiklok, was taken aboard, and the two vessels, with the scow and steam launch in tow, started back to St. Michael, having on board all the members of the three parties. The same route was followed as in coming south. Nothing of particular interest occurred during the voyage, and St. Michael was reached on the 13th of September. The vessels were hauled out and housed, together with the two steam launches and scow, and eight pulling boats. At midnight on the 26th of September the entire party was taken on board the U.S. S. r¥1zeeling, which had been waiting for three days for the conclusion of the season's work, and the start was made for Seattle. While laying up the vessels considerable work was done in the vicinity of St.

Michael, as there were occasions during which some members of the party would not have been otherwise employed. A base was measured by Assistant Baldwin, Aid Derickson, and Foremen Huntley and Pratt. The improvements of the Alaska Exploration Company were surveyed by Assistant Putnam, and an addition to the topographic work already done was made on the military site, on a scale of r: r ooo, by Assistant Faris and Aid Derickson. The continuation of the hydrography of the military water front, on a scale of I: I 000, was also carried on by Assistants Young and Baldwin and Foreman Van Wyck. This closed the work of the season, which must be regarded as extremely satisfactory, both as regards amount and quality, when the great disadvantages under which the party labored are taken into account . . The season's work may be classified, as regards its character, under the following heads:
RECONNOISSANCE.

This consisted of an examination of the principal pas5es of the Yukon River by Assistants Putnam, Young, and Faris, in the steamer Taku.
ASTRONOMICAL WORK.

Time observations were made at St. Michael, for use in the determination of gravity and for carrying chronometric longitudes to the stations in the delta. Three points were determined longitudinally-one at the head of the Aproon Pass, one on the lower Kwiklok, and one on the Kripniyuk. These controlled the work effectually as iar as its longitude was concerned. The observations were made by Assistant Putnam, and were highly satisfactory.
MAGNETIC.

Four stations were occupied for this class of observations-one at St. Michael, one at the mouth of the Pastoliak, one at the astronomical station on the Kwiklok, and one inside the entrance of the Kripuiyuk. At all points the three elements-declination, dip, and intensity-were determined on several days.
BASES.

Wherever a triangulation was developed the measurement of a base line was necessary, and we therefore have these operations on the Kwiklok, on the Kripniyuk, and at St. Michael on the tundra back of Camp Pritchett. This last was measured with great care by Assistant Baldwin, assisted by Aid Derickson and Foremen Pratt and Huntley. The apparatus employed in all the base measurements in Alaska during the season was a steel tape. One of the bases was measured with an ordinary 25-metre steel tape and two were executed with a 50-metre steel tape, No. 205, which was standardized in connection with the Versailles base, in Missouri.
TRIANGULATION.

The triangulation was first begun at St. Michael astronomical station, and carried by Assistants Young and Baldwin to the southern end of the island. This was done, as before stated, while in camp at the landing point. From the southern end of the island

to the Aproon entrance the work was carried on by Assistant Baldwin, with Aid Derickson and Foreman Huntley: The entire scheme embraces about 50 miles of triangulation, and, although not of the first order of accuracy, is amply strong for all work which will be based upon it for the next fifty years. None of the Alaska work, in fact, has been pushed. to the extreme limit of accuracy, as the object for which it is done can be attained equally as well and more economically without employing the refinements adopted in more thickly settled localities. A rapid triangulation was made at the lower end of the Kwiklok by Assistants Young and Baldwin, and at the entrance of the Kripniyuk by Assistant Young. ·
TOPOGRAPHY.

The rival claims by commercial companies doing business in Alaska made it necessary to survey the water front at St. Michael. At the request, therefore, of the commanding officer of the United States military resen·ation this work was taken up and completed as soon as possible. The intervals before the arrival of the Taku and at the last of the season, while closing up the affairs of the party, were utilized. by making a topographical survey, on a scale of r: r ooo, by Assistant Faris and Aid Derickson. After the completion of this a tracing of the field sheet was furnished to the commanding officer. The topography between St. Michael Harbor and the Aproon, including the Aproon entrance and the canal separating St. Michael Island from the mainland, were all executed on a scale of r: 20 ooo, with the plane table, by Foreman Pratt, while attached to the camping party under Assistant Baldwin. The topography around the Kwiklok entrance was also done, on a scale of r: 20 ooo, by Assistants Faris and Putnam and Foreman Pratt. At the mouth of the Kripniyuk Assistant Putnam made a topographical survey on a scale of r: 20 ooo.
TIDAL OBSERVATIONS.

In order to reduce hydrography and make it comparable with a stapdard datum plane it is necessary to observe the rise and fall of the tides during the period of operations. With this end in view, measurements of the tide were made at Camp Pritchett, St. Michael Bay, from July 15 to August 27 and from September r3 to 24. Near the m.outh of the canal to the entrance of the Aproon tide gauges were established and read by Assistant Baldwin's party. On the Kwiklok a self-registering tide gauge was maintained between August 7 and September 10. A staff gauge was also established somewhat nearer the entrance, and finally, at the Kripniyuk, a self-registering gauge was kept in operation for more than a month following August 7.
HYDROGRAPHY.

The operations carried on in this important branch of the season's work were a survey of the St. Michael water front, on a scale of r: r ooo, for the command.imt of the reservation. This was executed by Assistants Young and Faris and Foreman Van Wyck. Two lines of soundings were also run from the pass between Stuart and St. Michael Island to the Aproon entrance. The canal separating St. Michael Island from the mainland was also sounded. The Aproon bar and entrance was developed by the

216

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

camping party under charge of Mr. Baldwin. During the reconnoissance carried on by the party under Assistant Putnam soundings were made in the channel line through the Aproon to the intersection with the Kwikpak, up the Kwikpak to the head of the passes, down the Kwiklok to the mouth, and also through the cut-off connecting the Kwikpak with the Kwiklok entrance. The bar opposite the Kwiklok mouth was also examined, as well as the Kripniyuk entrance. It was the original intention of Assistant Pratt to make a thorough examination of the bar off the mouth of the Yukon, which is said to extend 40 miles to the southward; but the amount of other work was so great and the progress of the party was so impeded by gales that it was not possible to take up this work until late in the season, and therefore little could be done. Besides, at this time of the year the weather was exceptionally bad and the work was much retarded. No systematic detailed operations were undertaken on this bar, but a general reconnoissance was made.
CONCLUDING STATEMEN'I'.

The season of work during the summer of 1898 at the mouth of the Yukon brought out some very interesting and important facts, which is necessarily the case in all new surveys of an unknown and important region. Contrary to the usually accepted ic\ea, the Kwiklok Channel runs parallel to the shore until about half way to the Kripniyuk, when it turns seaward, and after passing beyond the sight of land it spreads out onto a bar with from 6 to 8 feet on it at low tide. The shores in the vicinity of the Kwiklok mouth appear to be about 25 miles farther to the westward than is indicated on the published charts, making an increase in the area of land in this one locality of about 2 500 square miles. Assistant Pratt recommends the publication of a chart on a scale of 1 :20 ooo immediately, and that such chart be sent north with the first party the following year, in order that new buoys may be marked upon it and that it may be distributed for the benefit of commerce. At low tide there are only two feet of water on the bar of the Aproon Channel, while at the Kwiklok entrance there are 8 feet. This would seem to speak in favor of the latter as the main entrance, but unfortunately the entrance to the channel is so far from the shore that no landmarks are available to guide the pilot, whereas the entrance to the Aproon Channel, although with very much less water than at the Kwiklok, has the inestimable advantage of being close to shore, so that vessels need not lose sight of land in the entire passage from St. Michael to the entrance. Assistant Pratt also recommends a chart on a scale of r :200 ooo, extending from Besboro Island to Cape Dyer, stating that such chart would be of assistance to vessels trying early to get to St. Michael and passing between the Yukon bar or fiats and the Bearing Sea ice, which at that time of the year has been swept a considerable distance offshore by the currents from the river. There seems to be no reasonable doubt that the upriver traffic for many seasons to come \Vill. be by deep-water craft to St. Michael and by river steamers from this point, going by way of the Aproon entrance. This necessitates a transfer at St. Michael, which often involves much loss of time, since the arrival of the river steamers is uncertain by several weeks, on account of the varying condition of the water in the river. While the passenger traffic to the Klondike region will remain as at present

APPENDIX NO.

through the Lynn Canal and over the passes by way of Dyea and Skagway, the freight will go by way of St. Michael and by the Yukon River. From 60 to 70 regular river steamers are now engaged in the carrying business, and notwithstanding this comparatively large number, freight was left behind at the end of the season. It is hoped that the examination of Scammon Bay, near Cape Dyer, will develop conditions that may possibly enable seagoing vessels to discharge at docks in this locality. If this were the case, and if the Kwiklok entrance were artificially marked, the freight transportation to the Klondike would be considerably cheapened. On leaving St. Michael, Assistant Pratt states that the steamers Taku and Yukon, with the 2 steam launches, 8 pulling boats, r scow, and miscellaneous outfit, were left near the military headquarters, in charge of the commanding officer, and during the past season sufficient coal (300 tons) and lumber were procured and stored for the next season's work. This will enable the following parties to take up the operations m')re rapidly and accomplish a full season's work. The instruments were brought back to Seattle. In conclusion it might be stated that, under the most favorable circumstances, the parties operating in this part of Alaska can not expect more than about sixty or seventy working days throughout the season. Assistant Pratt's party landed on the 30th of June, just eighteen days after the ice had left the bay, and departed on the 26th of September, none too soon to close work in this latitude. The time, therefore, between beginning and closing the work was only eighty-nine days. Deducting Sundays and periods of exceptionally bad weather, when no work was possible, the work of the season is reduced to about two months. From October r6 to April 20, 1899, Assistant Pratt was in charge of the suboffice at Seattle, Wash., during which time he erected and established a self-registering tide gauge at that port, mention of ·which has been made in the description of tidal operations. On April 21 he proceeded under instructions to San Francisco, and on the 25th took command of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson. From this date until the 18th of June the time was spent in repairing the ship and launches, shipping a naval crew, and equipping the vessel for a voyage to the northern Bering Sea. The party left San Francisco on the 19th, and arrived at Seattle on the 26th. The time from this last-mentioned date until the end of the fiscal year was spent in repairing the main boilers, which had been broken down on the trip north, and taking on board coal and lumber, and miscellaneous stores for the Alaskan work.

Assistant G. R. Putnam was attached to the party of Assistant Pratt from July r, 1898, to February 20, 1899. The period covering field work extended from July r to September 26. From August r to the end of the season he had charge of a subparty working from the steamer Taku at the mouth of the Yukon and Kripniyuk rivers, Alaska. On March r, 1899, he reported at the Office in Washington, and until March 27 was engaged in various duties connected with his Alaska work. He was then assigned to the Computing Division, and assisted in the preparation of a new edition of an astronomical manual on the determination of time, latitude, longitude, and azimuth, by Assistant J.

Sailing from Seattle on June ro, his party reached St. Michael on the 20th, and was engaged in preparing vessels and outfit for the work of the season until the close of the fiscal year. In this latter work Assistant Putnam had charge of a separate party, in cooperation with the parties of Assistants Pratt and Faris, and the particular work assigned to him was the locality of Scammon Bay and the mouth of the Yukon River in that vicinity. On May 8 Assistant G. L. Flower left Baltimore, Md., for Seattle, Wash., to join Assistant Putnam's party, to be engaged in hydrography and topography, in the vicinity of the Yukon River, Alaska. He was still attached to this party at the dose of the fiscal year.

On the 27th of April, 1899, instructions were issued to Assistant R. L. Faris for the execution of triangulation, topography, and hydrography in Alaska. The work contemplated the delineation of the shore line of St. Michael and Stuart islands and a development of the hydrography sufficient to show the limits of the 3-fathom curve on the north and west side. The passage between the islands was also to be examined and a general survey made of the Kwikpak mouth of the Yukon Delta and other passes, as opportunity offered. Upon the receipt of these instructions, Assistant Faris, although on duty in the Computing Division, undertook preparatory work at the same time and was able to leave Washington on the 17th of May for Seattle, where the equipment and organization of the party was to be completed. Arriving at the latter place on the 22d of May, organization was immediately begun, in cooperation with Assistant G. R. Putnam, who had arrivt';d at the localtity, having gone from Washington via San Francisco to make preliminary arrangements with Assistant J. F. Pratt concerning the transfer of certain outfit and instruments necessary for the Alaska work. It was at first assumed that the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patterson would be able to transport the parties to the field of operations, but it was later decided to go by commercial steamer, as, otherwise, considerable delay would have been entailed. The two parties therefore-those of Assistant Putnam and Assistant Faris-sailed from Seattle on June 10 on the steamer Roanoke, and after a sea voyage of fourteen days arrived at St. Michael on June 24. The parties landed the following day, and preparatjons were immediately begun for field operations, which began on the 9th of July. A detailed statement of the work accomplished during the season will appear in the next annual report.

E. SPECIAL DUTY.

SCHOTT: ENGLAND, Bristol.
SPl,CIAJ, DUTY.

Representative. Sept. 7 to Sept. 14, 1898.

Under instructions of July 29, 1898, Assistant C. A. Schott was directed to attend, as representative of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the International Conference on Terrestrial Magnetism, to be held between September 7 and 14 at Bristol, England. This conference was held in connection with the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, which very materially added to its interest and to the practical results attained. The first magnetic conference was held at Cambridge in 1845, but the present one is the first of an international character since that time. A permanent committee for magnetism and atmospheric electricity was appointed at the International Meteorological Conference held in Paris in 1896, and consisted of 8 members, with power to add to their number. The British Association allowed the Magnetic Conference to organize as a branch of Section A-" Mathematics and Physics"-and besides the President, Prof. A. W. Rucker and the English delegates, foreign members were present from Potsdam, Helsingfors, Vienna, Paris, Rome, St. Petersburg, Gotha, and Washington. Two meetings were held daily-one public, the other devoted exclusively to consultation and discussion. Several questions of interest were taken up for deliberation: First, whether in differential observations simple means shall be given of hourly tabulation or whether they shall be accompanied by means derived from undisturbed values. Second, discussion respecting the desirability of publishing, besides usual values for declination, dip, and intensity, at least for the months of January and July, the components of the ma,gnetic force toward the north and west, and the vertical. Third, discussion respecting the relative value of long and short magnets. Fourth, the principal work of the conference, however, was on the question of magnetic observatories, their present unsatisfactory distribution over the globe, and their inadequacy as regards number. The United States is now in position to render great service in this line by establishing an observatory in the Hawaiian Islands. This position is unique, being central to a vast area unexplored for magnetism and largely unknown. It is well adapted for special study. Fifth, the disturbing effect of electric tramways when passing within a mile, or even within several miles, of observatories. was commented upon. Sixth, attention was given to the greater need for observatories iu the southern than in the northern hemisphere. Many special papers of great value were presented to the conference by foreign and home delegates. The proposition by the delegate of the United States thatan observatory should be maintained for a series of years in Hawaii was received with acclamation. The results of the meeting will be ma,de known in a report to be made to the International Meteorological Conference, and publication of the discussions may be expected in the proceedings of the Bristol meeting. Too much praise can not be bestowed on the effective manner in which the sessions of the conference were conducted. The generous hospitality extended by the British association and the chamber of commerce at Bristol will long be remembered by all the visitors.

In accordance with instructions from the Superintendent, dated August 8, I898, magnetic observations were made by Assistant E. D. Preston at Cherrydale, Va., from August 10 to 15, determining declination, dip, and horizontal intensity. 'fhe result of the observations indicates that ·the declination at the station has been increasing since 1896 at the rate of about 2 Yz minutes annually and that the dip has been decreasing about 1 minute annually. REPRESENTATIVE DUTY.-STUTTGART MEETING. Under instructions from the Superintendent, dated July 29, Mr. E. D. Preston, Assistant and Executive Officer, attended as delegate from the United States the meeting of the International Geodetic Association, at Stuttgart, Germany, from October 3 to 12, 1898. He was instructed to examine en route the foreign offices similar to our own in England, France, and Germany. Leaving Washington on September I9 and New York on the 20th, Bremen was reached on the 29th and Berlin on the same day. Arriving at Stuttgart on the evening of October 2, the meetings of the conference were attended daily' until the 12th. Paris was reached on the evening of the date last named. Five days were devoted to the war office, geographic section, and the International Bureau of \Veights and Measures, at Sevres. Leaving Paris October 18, Southampton was reached on the same day, and the ordnance survey office was visited on the 19th. Leaving Southampton on the evening of the 19th, New York was reached on the 27th and Washington on the 28th. A report on this duty was published in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1897-98, and an abstract of the proceedings of the meeting at Stuttgart will be found attached to the present Report as Appendix No.3.

In August, 1898, Assistant J. F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodesy, attended the Boston meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the Second Conference of Astronomers and Astro-Physicists, at Harvard Observatory, as a representative of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. He took part in the discussions of papers read, and presented a paper entitled "The Limitations of the present Solution of the Tidal Problem.'' Upon his return he presented a short report, consisting of notes upon the various papers read at the two meetings which were of special interest to this Survey. Dr. R. A. Harris, of the Tidal Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, was also a delegate on the part of this bureau at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The follo~ving papers were presented by Dr. Harris at. the meeting: ( r. ) '' On harmonic functions. ' ' (2.) "A proposed tidal analyzer." (3.) "A tidal abacus." ( 4.) "The harmonic analysis of high and low waters." The first paper treats of particular solutions of Laplace's equation and those of certain other partial differential equations analogous to it. Some account of this paper is given in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. V (1898), pp. 96-98. The object of the second paper is to show the feasibility of constructing a machine such that if into it the hourly heights of the sea be entered once they will be distributed and added in the various ways required in tidal work. This paper appears in the Physical Review, Vol. VIII ( 1899), pp. 54-60. (See also Coast and Geodetic Survey Report, 1897. pp. 540, 541.) The third paper describes an apparatus which, once constructed for a given port, enables a person to mechanically determine the height of the tide at any given time. The apparatus exhibited at this meeting was designed for Port Townsend, Wash. The times and heights of the tides were shown to agree reasonably well with those obtained from the tide-predicting machine. A general description of the apparatus is given on pp. 183-185 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1894. The fourth paper aims to give a thorough method for the harmonic analysis of high and low·waters. The essential parts of this method are given upon pp. 569-572 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for l 897.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS.

870 horizontal angles measured. 619 vertical angles measured. 70 triangulation stations. 96 geographic positions. I30 miles triangulation along bou1.dary. 400 miles of boundary line corrected.

Assistant C. H. Sinclair was on, leave from the 1st to the 15th of October. From the 16th to the 20th he was organizing a party for the prosecution of the boundary survey between California and Nevada. Leaving San Francisco on the 20th for Carson City, with such members of the party as had been engaged, they reached the latter place next day. Their first occupation was to overhaul the outfit and to send it to Bishop, Cal., where the animals were in pasture and where the wagons had been stored in 1895. The party reached Bishop on October 24 and were employed until the 30th in the ordinary preparations of a party to be engaged in work of this kind. It must be remembered that a large party was to be transported over 200 rt1iles of country for the most part uninhabited and with but few watering places. The start on this long journey was finally made on October 31. · The party consisted of 11 persons, 2 6-mule wagons, I thorough-brace and 2 buckboards, 5 saddle horses and 3 pack mules; a total of 26 animals. There were two additions to the party later, making in all 13 persons. The animals being fresh from pasture, could go but slowly at first; moreover, the distances traveled were to a great extent regulated by the watering places. Ou one day only 8 miles were traveled, on another it was necessary to make 35 miles, and it was not until the morning of November 12 that the party reached the scene of operations. The first working camp was at Mound Spring, near the lower end of Ash Meadows and 6 miles north of the last station occupied in 1895, called T 105. This was to be occupied as a ranging station. Arrangements were made to have hay and grain hauled to this spring from Manse, 24 miles southeast. This ranch supplied the party with hay for 100 miles, and without it they would have incurred heavy expense in getting supplies from the railroad and from Fish Lake Valley by team. The ranging out of the boundary between California and Nevada is a piece of work somewhat unique in its character. Six years before a point was selected near Lake

Tahoe, and from a calculated azimuth it was proposed to range out a line in the direction of a selected point near the Colorado River, more than 400 miles distant. A triangulation was carried on as a check and for the determination of distances, but the entire correction of the line was based on fore and back ranges, and, as the result subsequently proved, showed remarkable accuracy in the work. The random line from Lake Tahoe missed the terminal post at Colorado River by only 150·5 meters, and the discrepancy in the distance between the determination of a line 3 180·3 meters long, from the triangulation from Lake Tahoe and from a base measured at the Needles, was only 0·2 of a meter, giving an uncertainty of n··htr part of the line determined. The discrepancy in azimuth, which was carried by angular determinations through the entire distance, was 10·2 seconds, and the discrepancy of latitude between the observed and calculated was 0·38 of a second. The longitude discrepancy, however, was much greater, being 8 ·60 seconds. There were two intermediate bases measured. One, north of the White Mountains, on the railroad, was measured twice at night with a steel tape. Its length was l 080· 14 meters. The other was on the Great Amargosa Desert, which was also measured twice with a steel tape at night, and has a length of r 464 ·95 meters. A base was also measured at the Needles four times with a steel tape, twice during the day with high temperature and twice at night. This base had a length of r 709·33 meters. The starting line was derived from the Yolo base and was 3 017·2 meters long, so that the entire boundary line rests for its accuracy on the four base lines enumerated. These lines were not placed at equal distances along the work, as their: position was determined from considerations of expediency and accuracy. The White Mountain base was 109 miles from the northern end of the line, the Amargosa base was 154 miles farther to the southward, and the Needles are 152 miles from this last-named base. Two intermediate azimuths were observed, at the White Mountains and near the Amargosa base, but the entire line, as ranged out, depends on the initial azimuth measured at Lake Tahoe, where the tracing of the line was started. Without going into the details of the field work, it may be said that the forward division was in charge of Mr. F. W. Edmonds, and the main ranging party under the immediate direction of Assistant Sinclair. Assistant W. B. Fairfield was in charge of the triangulation, and Aid H. F. Flynn made computations and assisted in all parts of the work. The line passes over altitudes varying from 750 to 13 ooo feet. The uncertainty of the azimuth from local deflections is probably l minute. This amounts to 600 feet in 400 miles, so that the errors of azimuth due to local deflections must have been largely compensating, since the error discovered at the lower end, after having ranged the line through a distance of 400 miles, was only r 50 metres. A topographical map of the Colorado River from Fort Mojave to the Needles, on a scale of 1: 40 ooo, was made by Assistant Sinclair. The party reached the southern limit of the work on February 17, and immediately began the return over the line, correcting for the discrepancy observed at the termination and setting the final boundary marks. In the first 70 miles only three stations could be put in by direct measurement of offset. The others were, therefore, lined in. By the end of February the work had reached Manvel. In order to save expense the party was now reduced to 7 men and

14 animals, which saved about $500 per month and reduced the monthly expenditures to $700. Lake Tahoe was reached on the 17th of June, and the stone at the beginning of the line was set in concrete and the work ended. Stations Ts and T 6 were under many feet of snow, and the labor of uncovering them would have been so great that they were left untduched. Most points were marked by a post with a cairn 4 to 5 feet high.· When few stones were available a single stone with a drill hole was used, with a mound of sand and earth. Granite monuments, 6 feet long and weighing 856 pounds, were used at stations Nos. 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, and 27. The boundary posts were marked with the letters C and N, and were numbered on the northwest side. The entire work consists of 14 topographic sheets, on a scale of 1:40 ooo, executed by Assistant Sinclair and Mr. Edmonds. The magnetic observations and photographs were made by Mr. Edmonds. The work of the season comprises 130 miles of triangulation and 400 miles of boundary line corrected. This involved the establishment of 96 geographical positions by the measurement of 870 horizontal angles and 619 vertical ones. S. Doc. 454--15

Under instructions from the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Assistant Marindin reported to the Secretary of War on November 11, and on the 15th received the Secretary's order for a resurvey of the Brunswick Outer Bar. He arrived at the scene of operations on the 19th. It had been arranged that the schooner Eagre, under command of Assistant F. \V. Perkins, was to take up the hydrography of the interior waters of St. Simon Sound and Brunswick and adjacent rivers, and that Mr. Marindin's party, when not engaged on the Brunswick Bar work, should continue, under Assistant Perkins, the interior work just mentioned. For the prosecution of the bar work quarters were secured as near as possible to the proposed locality. It was, however, impossible to find suitable accommodations nearer than 12 miles from the bar, so that it was necessary to charter a small tugboat to take the party to and from the work and to make the necessary soundings. The expenses for this work, except the salaries of Assistants Marindin and Flower and Aid Frisby, were defrayed by the War Department. The work progressed slowly on account of the exposed situation and the necessity of measuring the depths to tenths of a foot. The slightest disturbance in the surface of the water made accurate work well-nigh impossible, so that it was only on very rare occasions, when a perfectly smooth sea existed, that the work could be carried on. On December 22 and February 23 work was suspended for some time, in obedience to telegraphic orders from the Secretary of War, to allow the dredging of shoal spots which the sounding work had developed. The Eagre arrived at Brunswick on December 12, and was employed as continually as possible on the work indicated. (For the details of this work see ante, p. r 72.) From December r to 14 Assistant Marindin was unavoidably absent as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, making a tour of inspection at the low-water stage of the river from Cairo to New Orleans. During his absence Assistant Flower was in charge of the Brunswick Bar work, and continued operations in favorable weather. On January 20 Assistant Marindin received a communication from the Secretary of War, calling his attention to the fact that a report should be submitted, in conformity with the expressed wish of Congress, stating the amount of work done, its cost, and value to the Government. Material for such a report had already been accumulating

in Assistant Marindin's hands. It was now taken up and put in shape. This report was transmitted on the 5th of June, accompanied by a comparative tracing showing changs:s since the beginning of improvements on the bar in 1871. Among the numerous causes of delay in the prosecution of the work was the destruction of the eastern observing station on the bar, which was demolished by a cyclone. This was rebuilt by Colonel Goodyear, and its geographical position, together with the western station, which also suffered from the same· cause, \Vas determined by Assistant Marindin's party. There were two tide stations. one at the easternmost observing station and the other at the pier on St. Simon Island. They were occupied, however, only on days when sounding was executed on the bar. The tidal plane of reference had been obtained from the height of a bench mark on St. Simon Light-House. This plane of reference for heights had been fixed by Congress at average high tide instead of mean low water, as is usually taken. The survey was completed on April 12. Assistant Marindin arrived in \Vashington on the 17th. From April 26 to May 5 his services were again required on the Mississippi River Commission, and a tour of inspection was made from Cairo to New Orleans, as in the previous December. The plotting of the recent survey of the bar at Brunswick was completed on the 1st of June. The results were noted and incorporated in a report to the Secretary of War, which was transmitted through the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on July 8, 1899.

From the last of November until the close of the fiscal year his duties were those of Inspector of Charts, and he had charge of the work which had previously been that of the Hydrographic Division and Chart Division. The business of the chart agencies was also included as a part of the Chart Division work. In conformity with instructions of May 16, Assistant Bradford made a tour of inspection of the chart agencies along the Southern seaboard. Taking steamer at New York on June 2, he first went to Charleston, and visited afterwards, in succession, the various agencies at Savannah, Brunswick, Jacksonville, Tampa, Tarpon Springs, Braidentown, Pensacola, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, and Key West. Besides the inspection of agencies, correspondence and interviews were had with chambers of commerce, boards of trade, pilot commissioners, etc., for general and special information as to the opinions and wants of the maritime public.

Inspection. July I, 1898, to June 30, 1899.

On the 1st of July, 1898, Assistant H. G. Ogden was directing the movements of hydrographic and topographic parties in Chesapeake Bay, with headquarters at Baltimore. During the month a series of tide gauges was established throughout the entire length of the bay, reference to which is made in detail in the description of tidal work, on page 166. On November 1 he relieved Assistant Bradford of so much of the latter's duties as hydrographic inspector as related to the care of ships and details of hydrographic work and the direction of the Coast Pilot Party. He continued the supervision of parties in Chesapeake Bay until the close of the season, and, following this, exercised general supervision of th~ building of the steamer Patlzjinder. In April he was directed to proceed to Mobile to detennine the course to be pursued in regard to the steamer Baclie, which was unseaworthy and had been ordered to stop at Mobile on her way to New York, for repairs. An inspection by the United States local inspector of hulls confirmed the report of Assistant P. A. Welker, and in view of her condition she was overhauled sufficiently to make her safe for a trip North. While this was being done, Assistant Ogden visited New Orleans, and in company with the local inspector of hulls inspected the schooner Quiel..· at the entrance of the canal, Lake Pontchartrain, then in command of Assistant 0. B. French. The result of this inspection was the practical condemnation of the schooner, and she was laid up at Madisonville in charge of a shipkeeper. At the end of April Assistant Ogden returned to Washington, and proceeded to Elizabethport to make final arrangements for taking charge of the steamer Patlzfinder. On the 10th of June he proceeded to the Pacific coast to inspect parties fitting out for the field at Seattle and San Francisco. This duty was completed toward the end of July, and he returned to Washington on August 3.

On the 26th of May, 1899, Assistant J. F. Hayford, Inspector of Geodetic Work, was instructed to make a tour among the parties operating in the Mississippi Valley. Jn compliance with such instructions he left Washington on the 2d of June, and was with Assistant Forney on the 6th, 7th, and 8th, while the party was engaged in the selection of stations Sand Hill, Renfrow, and Miller. On June 14 he had reached Assistant Eimbeck's party, at Sterling, Kans. On the 15th and 16th he was with Assistant Baldwin, doing leveling near Concordia, and on the 19th and 21st with Assistant Granger, at Valley. The results of the trip were the -issuing of instructions to Assistant Forney in regard to base lines and combined longitude and azimuth stations; to Assistant Eimbeck relative to the positions of the circle, and number of measures and observations of horizontal angles, and in regard to abstracts serving as duplicates of the work; to Assistant Granger relative to positions of the circle, and number of measures and observations of horizontal directions, and also recommending the discontinuance of inking in the pencil originals; and to Assistant Winston and Aid Tilton relative to abstracting the precise level results. Assistant Hayford makes special commendation of the vigor and economy displayed by Assistant Forney in his work of reconnoissance. New stqtions were located at the rate of less than two days per station, on the average, and a total progress, in three months, of 174 miles along the ninety-eighth meridian was made, iticluding the selection and marking of two base lines. The leveling party under Assistant Baldwin and Aid Tilton was highly commended for the rapidity of its work, a speed of 11' miles per hour being often attained. The use of velocipede cars was carried out in these parties to the fullest extent, and special recognition is given by Assistant Hayford to the way in which the spirit and letter of the instructions of the committee on precise leveling have been followed. The triangulation by Granger has been remarkable for speed and economy, less than two weeks per station, including preparations, moving, etc., being required, and at the same time the monthly expenditures were extremely moderate.

F. THE FLEET OF THE UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEE

The Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet, in service during the fiscal year 1898-<)9, consisted of ten steam vessels having an average registered tonnage of 180, and five sailing vessels with an average tonnage of about 72. The largest steamer is the Pathfinder (registered tonnage 469), and the smallest the Cosmos, with 25 tons register. The largest schooner is the Eagre ( l 92 tons), and the smallest the Spy ( 1 7 tons). The ages of the vessels vary greatly-from the Matchless, built in 1859, arid the Endeavor, in 1862, down to the Pathfinder, our most recent and valuable acquisition, which was launched during the fiscal year just closed. The illustrations given show the types of vessels. No. 27 is the Patlifi,nder, which embodies the latest ideas in marine construction as applied to the necessities of Coast Survey work. .No. 28 is the Yukon, and shows what can be accomplished in the way of building a vessel, transporting it, in pieces, 6 ooo miles by rail and water, and rebuilding it on the beach at the field of operations. The successful accomplishment of this task is due to the energy and ability of Assistant J. F. Pratt. The contract was let on the 9th of April, 1898, to the Gas Engine and Power Company and Charles L. Seabury & Co., Consolidated. The vessel was shipped by rail to Seattle, Wash., and was finally landed at St. Michael, Alaska, on July 3, 1898. A force varying from twenty to twenty-five men, working one month, was required to rebuild and launch her. It is worthy of mention that no essential piece needed in the reconstruction was omitted in the shipment, although the vessel was not completely put together in the shipyards at Morris Heights. Illustration No. 29 shows the Eagre, the largest schooner of the fleet. The ships are generally in good condition, with the exception· of the Bache and Quz"ck, both of which have been condemned as unseaworthy. The Eagre was examined and found remarkably sound after twenty-four years' service. It may be stated, in this connection, that she was built as a private yacht and was afterwards sold to the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Her long life and e:ccellent condition after many years of service is a convincing proof that, though seemingly excessive, a generous expenditure of money judiciously applied to the construction of a vessel brings adequate returns as time goes on; and, on the other hand, nothing is eventually gained by the reduction of an appropriation for this purpose to the lowest figure possible in the interest of apparent, but false, economy. No work was done during the year either with the Cosmos or the Transit. The former has been laid up at Sitka, Alaska, and the latter at. Pensacola, Fla. Of the thirteen remaining vessels seven have been employed on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and in Porto Rico and five on the Pacific coast and in Alaska. One, the Patlifi,nder, was placed in commission in the spring of 1899, and having sailed from Washington, D. C., in June for San Francisco, was on her voyage during the remainder of the fiscal year. Classifying the localities one step further, we may note that of the eastern fleet two vessels were engaged exclusively on Chesapeake Bay; two on Lake Maurepas, Louisiana;
231

one at Portsmouth, N. H., Aransas Pass, Tex., and Charleston, S. C.; one on Chesapeake Bay and afterwards at Brunswick, Ga., and one on the Chesapeake Bay and later on the Hudson River and in Porto Rico. Of the Pacific fleet one operated in San Francisco Harbor; one in Grays Harbor, Washington, San Diego Harbor, San Pedro Harbor, and San Francisco Harbor, California; two in Alaska, and one, the Patterson, was out of commission most of the year, but was prepared for work and sailed for Alaska on June 17.

G. TRIAL TRIP OF THE UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY STEAMER PATHFINDER.

On the 20th of June, 1898, a contract was let for the construction of a single-screw steel vessel for service in Alaska and. the Aleutian Islands. This contract, made between Lewis Nixon, of Elizabethport, N. J., and the Honorable Lyman J. Gage, Secretary of the Treasury, acting for and in behalf of the United States, stipulated that the vessel should be delivered, complete in all respects, on or before the lst day of March, 1899. The essential conditions were that the speed developed upon a trial trip, under conditions prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, should not be less than an average o'f l 2 knots an hour under natural draft, maintained successfully for four successive hours, and that the vessel should be strong and well built, in conformity with the contract plans and specifications. The price to be paid was $150 ooo. ' The design was prepared by Mr. F. W. Grogan, draftsman in the Bureau of Construction and Repair, Navy Department, and who subsequently superintended her construction; the engine was approved by the Bureau of Steam Engineering, Treasury Department, before acceptance. On the 6th of February, 1899, a board of inspection was appointed by the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury, consisting of the following-named persons: J. J. Gilbert, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, president; Thomas H. Barret, United States local inspector of boilers; J. C. Moore, first lieutenant, United States RevenueCutter Service; Charles C. Yates, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, recorder, and C. A. McAllister, first assistant engineer, United States Revenue-Cutter Service. This board was charged with the duty of conducting a trial trip of the new steamer and determining whether she responded to the conditions of the contract. Subsequently, on the request of the contractor, the board was directed to inspect and report upon the efficiency of the vessel in all respects. Notice having been received from Mr. Lewis Nixon that the vessel would be ready about March 15 for her trial trip, a preliminary meeting of the board was held at Washington, D. C., on March 2, at 2 p. m. At this meeting a course for the trial was selected in Long Island Sound, and a list of necessary instruments, projections, blank books, and other requisites made out. The bvard met on the evening of March 14 at the Imperial Hotel in New York City. The following day an inspection was made of the vessel, including frames, beams, bulkheads, etc., as she lay at the shipyard at Elizabethport. At this inspection were present the contractor, Mr. Lewis Nixon; the superintendent of construction, Mr. F. W. Grogan; Capt. John Ross; Mr. John L. Goldsborough, the chief engineer, and Mr. H. G. Ogden, inspector of hydrography and topography, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The vessel was not complete in minor details, and the board, therefore, in fairness to the contractor and to the superintendent of construction, confined its report to those parts at that time finished, and made recommendation that when all was completed to the satisfaction of the superintendent of construction and the inspector of

hydrography and topography of the Coast and Geodetic Survey the vessel should be accepted. At 8. 16 a. m. on the 17th of March the Patlifinder left the Crescent shipyard, bound for the trial course. This course was laid out on Long Island Sound and contemplated a run from Execution Rocks to within a few miles of Stratford Shoal light and returnan adequate distance to secure sufficient data to determine whether the requirements had been met. The vessel drew 8 feet 3 inches forward and 10 feet 5 inches aft, making a mean draft of 9 feet 4 inches. This was somewhat less than the normal draft of 10 feet, but it was understood that the vessel in the trial should sufficiently exceed the required speed of 12 knots an hour to offset any possible advantage from the unavoidably lighter draft. The board met at Pier No. 3, New York City, ran down the bayou a tug, and were transferred to the Pathfinder in the upper bay. In the meanwhile the remaining tanks were filled, and the mean draft was after this operation assumed to be 9 feet 6 inches, which assumption was verified after returning to the shipyard immediately following the trial. It must be noted also that considerable coal had been expended, and even under these conditions the draft was found to be 8 feet forward and IO feet r 1 inches aft, giving a mean draft of 9 feet 5Yz inches. From the upper bay the vessel continued up the channel, passing Governors Island at 9. r8 and Brooklyn Bridge at 9.32, and arriving at Execution Rocks at ro.37. From this point to position noted as angle No. r the grates were cleaned and the firemen and engineers took dinner, the number of revolutions in the meantime falling off to about 93. (See illustration No. 26.) From angle No. r the course by compass was a little north of east, which brought the vessel's head a little north of Stratford Shoal light. This course was continued unlil within about 3 miles of the shoal, or somewhat more than 20 miles from angle No. 2. A broad turn was now made and the vessel headed back over the course just run, and the four hours ended when at angle No. 29, near angles Nos. 1 and 2. Throughout the course sextant angles were taken at short intervals to fix the position of the vessel, and the time was accurately noted. After completing the four hours' run on natural draft, and while arranging for a short trial under forced draft, the vessel was twice turned, making a circle estimated at about 600 feet. A short run was then made at full speed under forced draft, beginning at angle No. 30 and ending at a point between Execution Rocks and Sands Point light, where the trial began. The current was against the vessel on its eastward course and with her on the westward, so that the corrections on account of current are practically balanced. There was no appreciable current either way during the run under forced draft. The result of the trial is given in the following table, where it will be seen that on an average a rate of nearly 12 Yz knots an hour was attained for the whole time the vessel was under way, while for the time between angles Nos. 2 and r8 and between Nos. 20 and 29, during which the vessel was continuously at a uniform speed, the rate was more than 12 Yz knots an hour. The forced draft gave nearly 13Yz.

During the trip the steering gear was well tested and found to be in good shape. The hull showed itself to be very staunch, and the working of the engines left nothing to be desired. The Pat!ifinder is able to turn in a remarkably small circle, and can be stopped from full headway in a little more than twice her length. As representative of the engines' average performance under natural draft, it may be stated that for three consecutive hours, 11.15 a. m to 2.15 p. m., the number of revolutions per minute was 115·2, with a steam pressure of 144 pounds at the main engine. The average horsepower developed during this natural draft was 846"8. Under a forced draft there were obtained 120·9 revolutions per minute, 160·6 pounds steam pressure at the main engine, and a total indicated horsepower of 1 173·5. The amount of coal used was 2·08 pounds per indicated horsepower an hour, which is a very fair rate of consumption for machinery of this type. The report of the board of inspection states that the hull of the vessel is constructed in conformity with the plans and specifications, except where changes were made as approved by the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The Patlljinder is provided with an electric plant, and this was success~lly run for some hours while the board was on the steamer. The windlass was tested after the trial trip by dropping the anchor and hoisting it. The change from steam steering to hand steering can be readily made. The time required to completely turn the vessel around, i. e., 180°, when at full speed was three minutes and one second to starboard and three minutes and twenty-two seconds to port. In summing up its final report the board states: First, that the ve5sel, including ·hull, fittings, machinery, engines, boilers, and appurtenances and equipment, is strong and well built, and in strict confomlity with the contract, drawings, and specifications, with duly authorized changes in the same; second, that no defect in the material or construction of machinery was found; third, that no weakness or defect in the vessel was developed during the trial trip; fourth, that the vessel is in all respects complete and ready, in accordance with the requirements of the contract, except in several minor details.

H. DESCRIPTION OF THE COAST AND G'EOD~T/C SURVEY STEAMER PATHFINDER.
By Capt. JOHN Ross, Nautical Expert, first commander of the vessel.

The steamer Pathfinder is the latest vessel built for the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and is specially designed for work in the waters of Alaska and the Bering Sea. Built entirely of steel, and of exceptional strength, she has three decks, seven water-tight transverse bulkheads, and fifteen water-tight compartments, including two trimming tanks, but not including the water tank under the engine and boiler, which forms a water-tight double bottom between the first longitudinals on both sides. Her length on water line is 165 feet; over all, 196 feet; breadth of beam, 33 feet 6 inches; depth of hold, 19 feet 8 inches; gross tonnage, 690, and displacement, on a mean draft of IO feet, is 875 tons. The rig is brigantine, with a sail area of 4 478 square feet; sufficient to steady her in a heavy sea or to carry steerageway in case of any accident to the machinery. The engines are vertical triple expansion, 18, 27, and 44 inches, with 28-inch stroke. The horsepower developed on the trial trip under forced draft was I 173·5. The vessel has a single screw, 10 feet in diameter, with four adjustable !;>lades having a pitch of 13 feet. The number of revolutions per minute is 130. Two Scotch boilers supply steam to the main engines. They are 11 by I l ~ feet, with two furnaces in each. The boilers have a total heating surface of 2 833 ·84 square feet, and are intended for a working pressure of 160 pounds. One vertical tubular donkey boiler, IO by 5 feet, with a heating surface of 574 square feet, supplies steam for auxiliary machinery, distilling fresh water, and heating the vessel when there is no steam on the main boilers. The bunkers have a capacity for 240 tons of coal, sufficient to give an estimated steaming radius of about 5 ooo miles. The speed on the trial trip was I 3 ·46 knots under forced draft and 12 ·65 _knots under natural draft. The auxiliary machinery comprises steam steerer, steam windlass and capstan, steam winch for hoisting boats, two dynamos for electric lighting, and a Sturtevant blower engine for forced draft. · Being intended for surveying work in localities distant from any base of supplies or place where repairs can be made, the ·fittings and equipment are as complete as possible on a vessel of this size. The quarters for officers and crew are commodious, well lighted and ventilated, thoroughly heated by steam, and fitted with modern sanitary appliances. The regular complement is 14 officers and 65 petty officers and men, but this number can be increased to a total of 100 without crowding. Holds and storerooms have a capacity for stowing five months' provisions, clothing, and small stores for roo men and the survey instruments necessary for hydrographic and landing parties. Fresh water is supplied by an evaporator and distiller with a capacity of r 200 gallons in twenty-four hours. The capacity of the water tanks is
236

237

3 ooo gallons, but the double bottom under the engine and boilers is utilized to hold 3 500 gallons of fresh water for the boilers. · The electric-lighting plant consists of two directly connected dynamos, 125 incandescent lamps, and one 12-inch search light. These can all be operated by one dynamo, the other being kept as a relief in case of accident. Electric call bells, speaking tubes, and a mechanical telegraph between the pilot house and bridge and the engine room afford means of communication between the different parts of the vessel. The outfit of boats comprises two 28-foot alco-vapor launches, two 26-foot whale boats (one of them a lifeboat), one 26-foot rowing cutter, and one 18-foot dingey. Provision has been made for carrying additional boats on deck when they are needed. Two tanks, with a capacity for l 200 gallons, are carried on the lower deck of the vessel for the oil used as fuel in the launches.

f. VOYACr'E OF THE PATHFINDER FROM WASHINGTON, D. C, TO SAN

FRANCISCO, CAL.

The Patlzfinder left Washington on June 7, 1899, and arrived at San Francisco on September 18. A short stop was made at Newport News for coal and minor repairs, and the real yoyage began 011 the 16th of June, whe11 she got under way at 9.20 a. m., and headed her course for Santa Lucia. West Indies. Call was made at the following ports en route:
Santa Lucia .. Pernambuco ... Rio Montevideo .. . Valparaiso .. . Callao .................. . San Diego ............ .

June 23 to Tune 25. July 6 to July 1 I. July 16 to July 22. July 26 to Aug. 4. Aug. 20 . .\ug. ::5 to Aug. 30. Sept. 14 to Sept. 15.

The total number of knots run was 14 556; the number of tons of coal consumed, 842. The cost of the trip was, in round numbers, $8 ooo, of which 75 per cent was for coal, the other expenses being pay, subsistence, water, ice, laundry, and miscellaneous. A detailed account of this very successful trip, written by Capt. F. Walley Perkins, the commander, will appear in the next annual report.

./. STATIONS AT WHICH TIDAL OBSERVATIONS WENE i1/ADE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR I898-99, INCLUDING A SHORT ACCOUNT OF EARLIER WORK.

Tidal observations in and near New York Harbor have been carried on practically continuously for over fifty-six years by our service. Beginning with 1844, tides were observed on staff gauges until January, 1853, when a self-registering tide gauge was established upon Governors Island, and kept in operation until May, 1879. In October, 1875, an automatic gauge was set up at Sandy Hook, N. J., which was kept running until July, 1893. In December, 1892, an automatic tide gauge was started at Fort Hamilton, on the eastern side of 'fhe Narrows, New York, and is still maintained. A tidal indicator was established at Fort Hamilton when the tide gauge was set up, and has been iu successful operation ever since. The station is at present in charge of J. G. Spaulding. At the request of the Maritime Exchange, of Philadelphia, Pa., an automatic tide gauge and a tidal indicator were established at Reedy Island Quarantine Station, Del., in January, 1896, which has been maintait:.::d in operation up to the present time. The station is in charge of the Marine Hospital surgeon, with F. C. Fuss as observer. At the request of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia an automatic tide gauge was set up at the navy yard, Washington, D. C., in July, 1891, and maintained in operation to July, 1899. On account of the silting around the navy yard tide gauge, in June, 1898, a gauge was placed on the wharf of the Norfolk and Washington Steamboat Company, at the foot of Seventh street S\V., Washington, D. C., and has been maintained to the present time. The station is under the direction of the Chief of the Tidal Division, with D. S. Bliss as observer. At the request of the Director of the United States Geological Survey an automatic tide gauge was established at Morehead City, N. C., in April, 1898, and ·was continued until October 30, 1898. The station was established by Assistant C. C. Yates, and was under the care of Harry V. \Vebb, as observer. An automatic tide gauge was established at Fernandina, Fla., in May, 1897, which is .still in operation. The station is in charge of B. V..T. \Veeks. An automatic tide gauge was established in San Juan, Porto Rico, in February, 1899, and maintained mitil August 6, 1899, when it was wrecked by a hurricane. The station was established by Assistant Superintendent 0. H. Tittmann, and was in charge of Ensign W. R. Gherardi, U. S. N. An automatic tide guage was established at Ponce, Porto Rico, in January, 1899, and continued to April 25, 1899. The station was established by Assistant v..r. C. Hodgkins, with various observers. Tidal observations near the Golden Gate, San Francisco Bay, California, have been carried Oil practically continuously for more than forty-five years by this Survey. In June, 1854, a self-registering tide gauge was set up at Fort Point, on the. south side of
239

the Golden Gate, and continued in operation until November, 1877. In February, 1877, a gauge was started at Sausalito, which was maintained until September, 1897. In July, 1897, an automatic tide gauge was e~tablished at Presidio, which has been kept going to the present time. The station is under the direction of Assistant A. F. Rodgers, with H. S. Ballard as observer. An automatic tide gauge was started at Seattle, Puget Sound, Washington, in December, 1898, which is still maintained. The station was established by Assistant J. F. Pratt, and is now managed by Assistant J. J. Gilbert.

THE INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC ASSOCIATION FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE EARTH.
By ERASMUS D. PRESTON, Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Delqrate on t/1e part the United States at tlze Twelfth General Conference.

C?l

PREFACE.
A. GENERAL STATE11/ENT.

The great interest now manifested by all civilized nations in the measurement of the earth would seem to warrant the publication of a short account of the origin, development, and present state of the movement. Not only is the size and shape of our planet of universal concern, but a comparative study of the cartographic methods employed by different nations can only be productive of mutual benefit. With the view of coming to a knowledge of what has been done, as well as to an understanding of the present way of formulating plans of action, it is proposed to give in this paperI. A short sketch of the origin and growth of the International Geodetic Association. II. A translation of the convention under which the organization now exists. III. A condensed statement of the scientific and administrative activity of the Association during the decade 1887-1896. IV. A brief summary of the proceedings of the last general conference (Stuttgart, 1898), with a list of the members of the permanent commission and of the delegates present.
B. CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.

The position of the Coast and Geodetic Survey with reference to the meetings of the association is defined by the following joirit resolution of Congress:
PUBLIC RllSOI.UTION-No.

JOINT RESOI,U"l'ION authorizing the President to appoint delegates to attend the meetings of the International Geodetic Association.

Whereas the Government of the United States was invited in the year eighteen hundred and eighty-nine by the Imperial German Government to become a party to the International Geodetic Association; and Whereas this Government duly accepted said invitation by a joint resolution of Congress approved February fifth, eighteen hundred and eighty-nine: Therefore, Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of tl1e United States of America in

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY _REPORT, 1898-99.

Congress assembled, That the President be, and he is hereby, authorized to appoint delegates, who shall be officers of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, to attend the meetings of the said International Georletic Association whenever and wherever the same shall be held; but no extra salary or additional compensation shall be paid to such officers by reason of such attendance. Approved July 23, 1894.
C. EXPLANATION OF FRONTISPIECI!.:.

In the frontispiece are shown in blue outline those countries now forming part of the International Geodetic Association. The different arcs at present available for the determination of the earth's figure appear in full red lines. Work in progress or projected operations are indicated by dotted or parallel red lines. The positions of the international latitude stations situated on the parallel 39° 8' N. are designated by an asterisk. Short vertical lines on the equator indicate their longitudes more clearly, which are as follows:

The method here employed of representing the earth's surface is a modification of Lambert's equivalent azimuthal projection and originally was proposed by Aitow. The entire spherical surface is shown on an ellipse whose axes are in the ratio of 2 to 1. The meridians and parallels are algebraic curves, the former being of the fourth order. The average angular distortion is considerably reduced in this one over other equivalent projections.

I. ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL GEODETIC ASSOCIATION.
A. RUSSIAN AND GERlWAN W9RK.

The trigonometric connection between the Russian frontier and the astronomical observatory at Konigsberg, in East Prussia, marks the beginning of international cooperation for the measurement of the earth. In 1829 the foreign office in St. Petersburg expressed the wish that this work might be carried out. The proposition was favorably entertained by the Germans, partly on account of its immediate utility, but principally because it was a contribution to the determination of the earth's figure. It was even then pointed out by Bessel that the proposed work would make it possible to unite the several existing triangulations, and from such connection to draw conclusions of much greater weight than could be furnished by the actual disconnected geodetic measures. The work was begun in 1831 and finished five years later. It was published in 1838, under the title 11 Gradmessung in Ostpreussen. '' The plan was developed and executed by Bessel and Baeyer on the part of Prussia, and the volume bears the imprint of the master mind of the former. The resulting arc coincided neither with a parallel nor with a meridian, but made an angle of about 45 degrees with either. It was, however, recognized that such an arc would completely determine the size and shape of the earth. With the close of the Gradmessung in 1836, a triangulation was undertaken along.

the coast. It was executed by the trigonometric division of the army, arid was in charge of Col. J. J. Baeyer. This work is described in the Kiistenvennessung, published at Berlin in 1849. The details of the geodetic work of GemJany during the preceding decade are here exposed, and give evidence of the careful work of Baeyer, the Nestor of German geodesy. In the meantime other nations were not inactive. England and France on the west and Russia on the east were extending their operations in many directions. During the period from 1850 to 1860 general interest in concerted action grew, and in April of the following year Baeyei: (then lieutenant-general) drew up a plan for mutual work by the middle European nations. This was submitted for official action, and in November, 1861, he was empowered to carry out the project and to treat directly with foreign governments.
B. FIRST ORGANIZATION.

The result was that in 1863 an assembly convened in Berlii.1, at which nineteen States, including many smaller German ones, were represented. The enterprise was now fairly launched, and in 1864 invitations were issued for a general conference, which was held at the same place in October of that year. Aside from numerous German States, ro foreign countries participated. Norway and Sweden were jointly represented. The others were Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Italy, Austria, Russia, and Switzerland. A central bureau was organized, the permanent commission chosen, and the functions of each were specifically defined. From the date of this meeting until 1886 the history of the association is the history of European geodesy. The contracting parties were limited to continental nations. In the last-named year a convention, international in a wider sense, was drawn up and adopted for a period of ten years. The new body included representatives from Europe, Asia, and America. In 1895, the old convention having expired by limitation, the last one was adopted, under which the association exists to-day. In looking back over its career we find that there have been held twelve general conferences, as follows: ·

During the intervening years the permanent commission sat at different European cities, generally in Germany. II. THE NEW INTERN A TI ON AL GEODETIC CONVENTION. At the eleventh general conference, held at Berlin in 1895, a new convention was adopted, which was subsequently ratified by the contracting governments. This convention will remain in force until 1906. The following is a translation from the French, with the German text carefully compared:
THE NEW
INTERNATIO~AL

GEODETIC CONVENTION.

ART. I. The central bureau of the International Geodetic Association retains the attributions originally conferred up01i it, and remains attached to the Berlin Geodetic Institute in such manner that the director of the geodetic institute is at the same time director of the central bureau of the International Geodetic Association, and that the resources and scientific means of the institute are placed equally at the service of the association. ART. 2. The controlling organ of the geodetic association is the general conference of the delegates from the participating governments. This conference convenes at least once every three years. During the interval between the meetings the execution of the decisions of the general conference and the management of the administrative affairs are intrnsted to the bureau of the association, composed of the president, vice-president, permanent secretary, and the director of the central bureau. For administrative affairs in special unforeseen contingencies the bureau of the association shall refer, by correspondence, to a consulting permanent commission composed of delegates named officially by each state for this purpose, each state having one delegate. The bureau of the association shall fix the date and place of the general conferences, as well as c01woke thereto the delegates of the contracting states, at the same time indicating the order of business of the meeting. ART. 3. The director of the central bureau shall present annually to the bureau of the association a report on the activity of the central bureau and submit a programme of operations for the following year. This report and the programme will be printed and sent to all the delegates. ART. 4. The publications of the International Geodetic Association, the correspondence with the go\'ernments, and the delegates, as well as, in general, the administration of affairs of the association, pertain to the permanent secretary, under the general direction of the president of the association, and in conjunction with the director of the central bureau. ART. 5. The president, the vice-president, and the permanent secretary of the association are elected by the general conference for the period during which the convention holds. In case of vacancy, the place will be filled provisionally by the permanent commission, through correspondence, or. if necessary, at a meeting of the commission convoked for the purpose.

ART. 6. The International Geodetic Association shall have an annual endowment, 5upplied by contributions from all the contracting states. (See Article 9.) This endowment will provide, essentially, for the following expenses: I. For publication and administration. 2. For salary of the permanent secretary. 3. For remuneration or subsidy of theoretical computing or experimental work of interest to geodesy, authorized by a special vote of the general conference. 4. To carry on international scientific enterprises which are of a nature to facilitate and assure the advancement of geodetic work of a general interest in the different countries. The distribution of the endowment among the preceding items will be made by the bureau of the association, under the control of the general conference. AR'!'. 7. The annual endowment is made up of the contributions of the contracting states, determined by Article 9. It is fixed for a period of ten years at a minimum of 60 ooo marks (75 ooo francs), of which 16 ooo marks (20 ooo francs) belong to ordinary expenses, and 44 ooo marks (55 ooo francs) are d~stined for geodetic work indicated in No. 4 of Article 6, under the direction and responsibility of t11e central bureau and under the control of the bureau of the association. In order to increase, either permanently or temporarily, the endowment indicated, of 60 ooo marks (75 ooo francs), a request of the general conference and its ratification by all the interested go\'ernments is necessary. The justification of the use of the endowment will be published in the proceedings of the general conferences. Surplus funds may be utilized for the expenses of following years. ART. 8. The adhering states will pay their contributive parts at the commencement of each year. Payments are made by the diplomatic representatives of the contracting states at the offices of the legations in Berlin. In general, all the communications of the bureau of the association with the governments of the contracting states take place through their representatives at Berlin. ART. 9. The annual contributions will be made according to the following scale: (a) States whose population does not exceed 5 ooo ooo pay 800 marks ( 1 ooo francs, about). ( b) States whose population is between 5 ooo ooo and IO ooo ooo pay 1 600 marks (2 ooo francs, about). (c) States whose popu!ation is between IO ooo ooo and 20 ooo ooo pay 3 ooo marks (3 750 francs, about). (d) States whose population exceeds 20 ooo ooo pay 6 ooo marks (7 500 francs, about). Permanent or temporary increase of the endowment will be assessed according to the same scale. The contributions of the states are not modified by the accession of a new state to the convention, which will pay its contribution according to the scale established in this article. ART. IO. The payments under the different items of the endowment will be made by the director of the central bureau on the order of the president, or, in case he is prevented, on the order of the vice-president of the association. ART. 11. Balloting in the body of the general conference, either for the nomination

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)9.

of president, vice-president, or permanent secretary of the association, or for decisions on administrative questions, will be made by states, each state of the association having one vote. States not represented in the conference have the right to delegate their vote to one of the delegates present. However, no delegate can accept more than one of these assignments. The decisions are valid when at least half of the states of the association are directl~ represented in the conference. The decisions, by correspondence, of the permanent consulting commission are valid if at least one-third of its members have replied in the time fixed by the bureau of the association. ART. 12. For the scientific questions there will be instituted during the general conference special consulting commissions, in which each delegate shall have the right to enter. In the balloting of the general conference on scientific questions the absolute majority of the delegates present at the meeting is decisive. ART. 13. For mixed questions, or if there is doubt as to their scientific or administrative character, balloting must be made by states (see Article 11), providing that this method of balloting is requested by all the delegates of a state. ART. 14. In case of a tie vote, whether by states or by delegates, the vote of the chairman decides. ART. 15. The articles of the present convention remain in force until modified by a new agreement between the states.
RESOLUTION.

The present general conference (Berlin, 1895), after having renewed the permanent commission, conformably to the requirements of the convention of 1886, proceeds also to the election of president, vice-president, and permanent secretary of the association. After the ratification of the new convention by the governments the old permanent commission will dissolve and transmit its functions to the bureau of the association. (See Article 2 ~) In the name of the Eleventh General Conference of the International Geodetic Association. FOERSTER, President. HIRSCH, Secretary. III. ADMINISTRATIVE AND SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY OF THE ASSOCIATION DURING THE DECADE 1887-1896.
A. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

The old convention of the International Geodetic Association was in force during the decade 1887-1896, inclusive. On the 31st of December of the last-named year seven of the German states which belonged individually to the old association withdrew, and their place was taken by the German Empire formally entering the association as such. In the old convention there were twenty-seven contracting states. The retirement of seven of the German states and the substitution therefor of the German Empire

reduced the number to twenty-one, which made up the adhering parties on tl?-e 1st of January, 1897. Between this date and the date of the Twelfth General Conference, at Stuttgart, in 1898, two of the original states had withdrawn, but these places were filled by the acquisition of Great Britain as a member of the association and by the entrance of Hungary as an independent state, so that at the date of the Stuttgart meeting there were still twenty-one states belonging to the association, of which the following is a list. The order is that given in the official statement of the Stuttgart meeting.

C. ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITY OF THE ASSOCIATION, DECADE 1887-1896.

1887-Nice.-Meeting of the permanent commission. The definitive adhesion of France, Switzerland, and Servia to the new convention was announced. Correspondence was communicated between the Governments of Great Britain and the United States, on their entrance to the association. The proposition to establish direct correspondence 6f the bureau with the representatives at Berlin of the contracting states being submitted to the different governments and to Prussia, was tacitly accepted by all parties. A special committee, consisting of Messrs. Ibanez, Hirsch, Foerster, and Helmert, elaborated a project of by-laws for the permanent commission and the central bureau. 1888-Salzburg.-Meeting of the permanent commission. Adhesion of Chile, Mexico, Japan, and Greece to the Convention of 1886 was announced. The first special financial commission was constituted, consisting of Messrs. Faye, Foerster, and von Kalmar. 1889-Parz's.-General conference of the association. Definitive adhesion of the United States and the Arg~ntine Republic was announced. 1890-Fribourg i. B.-Meeting of the permanent commission. The permanent commission received the financial report, which showed a balance of 37 ooo francs, nearly all the contributions now being paid. The proposition to increase the number of members of the permanent commission from eleven to twelve, submitted to the different Governments, was approved, and led to the nomination of Messrs. Davidson and Hennequin as members of the commission. The question of universal time, taken up in the general conference at Rome in 1883, was discussed, and the commission maintained its recommendation for the meridian of Greenwich as the official meridian, which has been, in fact, chosen as the origin by the conference of Washington . .1891-J·t'orence.-Meeting of the permanent commission. 'J;'he permanent commission named as president M. Faye, as successor to G. Ibanez. . 1892-Brussels.-General conference of the association. Among other matters, the general conference considered the question of an expedition to Honolulu to study the movements of the earth's axis, and gave attention to a report elaborated by M. Marcuse. 1894-/nnsbruck.-Meeting of the permanent commission. The commission confirmed the vote taken by correspondence to advance the sum of 3 750 marks for the construction of a photographic zenith telescope, proposed by M. Foerster. In the same meeting there were discussions with representatives of several academies, which'. offered to cooperate with the permanent commission in the study of the force of gravity, especially in its relation to the geological structure of the earth's crust. The result of this interview was a provisional understanding on the subject. The discussion on the organization of an international latitude service in four stations situated on the same parallel led to the adoption of several decisions on fundamental principles, proposed by General Ferrero. An account was given of preparatory measures taken at Breteuil for the organization of a comparison station for pendulum apparatus, for which the permanent commission voted a subsidy. 1895--Berlin.-General conference of the association. The general conference was essentially occupied with the elaboration of a new geodetic convention, based on a

project proposed by the circular of June 15, 1895. The opening discourse, pronounced by M. Foerster, presider.t of the conference, contains an abridged history of the Geodetic Association in its successive phases. I896.-Lausanne.-Meeting of the permanent commission. The bureau of the association gave an account of the correspondence concerning the ratification of the new convention by the Governments and the transmission of its functions to the new bureau of the association.
JJ. SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU.

I887-Nice.-Director Helmert announced that a geodetic bibliography had been prepared by M. Boersch. It appeared in 1889 and was distributed to the Governments. M. Helmert communicated in the same meeting a report on the deviations of the vertical, as well as a report on pendulum measures executed in recent years. I888-Salzburg.-M. Helmert made a proposition to complete the network of astronomic points of the European triangulation. He also spoke on the determinations of the declination of stars deduced from observations of latitude in the prime vertical. I889-Paris.-The central bureau gave an account of some preparatory researches on the movement of the terrestrial axis which it had undertaken, and Mr. Albrecht com· municated a work on the same subject. The director read, in the same conference, a new report on the deviations of the vertical, as well as a notice 011 the measures with the pendulum. A communication was also received from M. Boersch on the junction of the measures of the Russian-Scandinavian arc with those of the French-English arc. I890-Fribourg i. B.-The director of the central bureau continued an account of the calculations of the longitudinal arc of Struve, of which he had already spoken in the previous year at Paris. He submitted a report, by Mr. Albrecht, on the observations of latitude at Berlin, Potsdam, and Prague. I89I-Florence.-The permanent commission having decided to send an expedition to Honolulu, of which the direction was given to Dr. Marcuse, in order to undertake observations of latitude at that point jointly with several European observatories, an account of the preparatory work of this expedition was given. Leaving Berlin on the 1st of April, 1891, the party arrived at Honolulu the 8th of May, after having been joined at Washington by Mr. E. D. Preston, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, who made similar observations at a neighboring, independent station. Mr. Helmert could, already at this meeting, give some first general results of the expedition. Mr. Helmert presented also a report on the choice of a common zero for altitudes in Europe. I892-Brussels.-The provisional results of the expedition to Honolulu were given. Confronted with simultaneous observations continued in the observatories of Berlin, Prague, and Strassburg, they showed evidence of the periodic displacement of the axis of the terrestrial globe. The expenses of the expedition amounted to 20 :;oo marks. On the same subject Mr. Albrecht, of the central bureau, submitted a report, "Results of the observations at Honolulu,'' and announced a provisional period of 385 days and an amplitude of 0"·53 for the movement of the earth's axis. In the same conference a new report on the zero of altitude was communicated, which was elaborated by M. Boersch. Another report of the central bureau, on bases and limiting sides of trigonometric network, was due to Mr. Kiihnen. The important result was shown that the new equations for the base bars determined by the International Bureau of Weights

254

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898--99.

and Measures at Bret.euil showed a very satisfactory accord between nearly all modern bases measured in different countries where, with the old equations of these bars, unexplained discrepancies were found. Mr. Helmert presented two new reports on the measures of the force of gravity and on the deviations of the vertical.. There results from this last, among other things, that on the fifty-sixth degree of latitude the curvature of the parallel agrees better with the ellipsoid of Bessel than with that of Clarke.

He also gave an account of observations of latitude continued at Potsdam and Strassburg. I89¢-lnnsbruck. -Mr. Helmert gave still some details on the measures of degrees of longitude on the fifty-second parallel, between Feaghmain and Warsaw, and communicated a table of ~iean errors in carrying the bases to the first sides of the network of the first order. But the principal subject was the study of the variations of latitude, which Mr. Albrecht treated again in a report, including also the American observations at San Francisco and Honolulu. On the other hand, Mr. Marcuse studied also the movements of the North Pole deduced from observations from 1891 to 1894. Mr. Helmert finally examined the real·movement of the North Pole in a notice communicated during the same session. I895-Berlin.-The central bureau gave an account of the adjustment computation of the arc of longitude on the fifty-second parallel, and presented two synoptic maps, one indicating the actual state of the trigometrical work in Europe, and the other that of the United States, furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the first Mr. Helmert called attention to a gap of triangles around the 47 ~ degree, in AustriaHungary, which should join the Russian chain with the French and Swiss chain. On the other map he mentioned the transcontinental American chain along the thirty-ninth parallel, an important new element. The interesting question of variations of latitude was the object of a report by Mr. Albrecht, and Mr. Helmert himself presented new reports on the relative me sures of gravity by means of the pendulum, and on the deviatio s of the vertical The director of the central bureau, at the same time, in his report, submitted the account of the financial administration of the association during the triennial period 1893-1895. The same proceedings, of 1895, contain, under the form of appendices, the following documents:
Summary of the propositions received by the central bureau on the subject of the renewal of the convention of October, 1886. Project of the permanent commission for the renewal of the geodetic convention. Alternative project for the renewal of the convention. New international geodetic convention adopted by the eleventh general conference, at Berlin, in October, 18q5.

In the last session of the permanent commission, in 1886, at Lausanne, the report of the central bureau makes known important results deduced from a study of the arc of longitude on the fifty-second parallel, and brings out the great continental anomaly of the geoid in this region, where the radius of curvature of the fifty-second parallel is longer by 189 meters than that of the Bessel ellipsoid, and remains less by 486 meters than that of the Clarke ellipsoid. Mr. Helmert made a communication on the relative and absolute measures of the force of gravity. The question of latitudes is the subject of a new report by Professor Albrecht. The same person treats also the choice of inter-

national stations for the latitude service. Finally a comparison of the photographic and optic methods for the observation of latitude is studied in the reports of Mr. Albrecht and Messrs. Schnauder and Hecker.
E. SPECIAL REPORTS.

Alongside the scientific activity of the central bureau,·it has been the custom since the origin of the Geodetic Association to name special reporters who are willing to present, either in the general conference or in the annual meetings of the permanent commission, a summary of the work executed in the different countries since the last conference. These special periodic reports have the great advantage of giving an account of the total progress made in the different branches, and to specify gaps which should be filled or contradictions which should be explained concerning the different branches of geodetic work. The following reports have been submitted:
I. ON TRIANGULATION. 2. ON THE MEASURE OF BASES.

3. 4. 5.

ON LONGITUDES, LATITUDES, AND AZIMUTHS. ON THE LEVELS OF PRECISION AND MARIGRAPHS. MISCELLANEOUS NOTICES AND MEMOIRS ON DIFFERENT QUESTIONS BELONG-

I. OPENING SESSION.

At 3 · I5 p. m. on the 3d of October, 1898, in the aula of the Polytechnic School at Stuttgart, the International Geodetic Association began its twelfth general conference. There were 35 delegates present, of whom 15 came from Germany, 5 from France, 2 from Italy, 2 from Japan, and 1 each from Belgium, Great Britain, Mexico, Netherlands, Austria, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Hungary, and United States. Eighteen invited guests, of whom r2 were from Stuttgart, completed the body. The session was opened by an address from the minister of public instruction, Dr. Von Sarwey, expressing the interest taken in the proceedings by the King of Wiirttemberg, and calling attention to the fact that since the last reunion in Stuttgart, twentyone years ago, the association had developed into an international association of much wider character. From a small association, for the measurement of degrees in Europe, founded by the learned Prussian general, Ba~yer, it had now become an international body embracing nearly all civilized countries. He was followed by the director of the Polytechnic School of Stuttgart, Professor Hell, in a well-timed address of welcome; the rector of the University of Tu bingen,. Dr. Von Brill, speaking in behalf of the institution, made mention of the fact that although geodesy was not one of the avowed departments of the University, they were proud to remember that one of their professors, Bohnenberger, had contributed largely to the development of this branch of science. He paid a well-merited tribute to the memory of Gauss, who developed what might be termed minor geodesy into an important branch of pure science. The director of the Royal Institute of Statistics, Dr. Von Zeller, speaking in its name, called attention to the application of geodesy to the official cartography of their country, and invited the guests to examine their last map, on a scale of 1: 25 ooo, which was shown at the meeting. The president of the association returned thanks to the King for his kindly interest, and to the speakers for their addresses of welcome, full of good feeling and sympathy. The following_vice-presidents were then announced: Professor Hammer, of Stutt-

gart; General 0. de Stubendorff, of St. Petersburg; Prof. G. H. Danvin, of Cambridge, England. The permanent secretary then read the report on the activit) of the bureau of the association. Generally these are given in both French and German, but as nearly all the delegates knew French, and the same could not be said as regards German, the report was read in the former language. It is to appear later, according to custom, in both tongues. A general statement was made touching the publications that have appeared since the last general conference, in l 895. The old co1~vention remained in force until the end of 1896. With the beginning of the year 1897 a new convention was adopted, and this is to hold until the year 1906. Among the publications that have appeared since the Lausanne meeting, in 1896, is, first, the proceedings of the conference, together with many important additions published as annexes. In accordance with a resolution adopted at Lausanne a report was addressed to the different Governments forming part of the association in April, l 897, on the administrative and scientific works of the period 1887 to 1896, and on the adhesions to the new convention of 1895. This report shows that at the time of its publication fiftee11 out of the twenty-one States of the old convention had adhered to the new one. The same report contains an account of the financial situation of the association up to the end of 1896. At the end of 1897 an administrative and financial report of the association was made to the different Governments and attention was called to the fact that of the nineteen States which at that time had signified their acceptance of the convention ten had failed to pay their dues. A circular to the different delegates was read, which appeared in April, 1898, and gave reasons for the choice of Stuttgart as the place of meeting and also indicated the order of work at the proposed c_onference. Besides the reports and financial questions, the following scientific subjects appear: Discussion of the choice of international latitude stations, and the photographic method of determining latitude. Then came special reports on triangulation, measure of bases, precise leveling, marigraphs, astronomical measures, deviation of the vertical, and determinations of gravity. Attention was called to the fact that Great Britain had now definitely joined the association. This was considered, at the time it was made known, such welcome news that the president of the association issued a special letter making the announcement. In the letter it was stated that the fact that Great .Britain had now entered the association was particularly satisfactory in every respect, not only on account of the great geodetic work executed by the Empire, but also because the association now had a completely universal character. The adhesion of Austria-Hungary was also announced and that of the United States. On the other hand, Chile and the Argentine Republic withdrew, so that the actual number of States adhering to the International Geodetic Association at the present time is twenty-one. The list of the permanent commission and the invite<i members was then published, and after the announcement of the death of several persons connected with the associati011 since the last meeting, notably M. Tisserand, the celebrated astronomer at the observatory at Paris, a recess was taken until the following day. The secretary stated that although Tisserand had not made geodesy the principal object of his ipdefatigable activity, the bonds which unite the two sciences of. astronomy and geodesy are so close and numerous that geodesy necessarily feels the disappearance of one of the most glorious

260

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-9<).

workers in the field of modern astronomy. The geodetic association will forever remain proud for having counted Tisserand among the number of its cooperators.
2. SECOND SESSION.

A second meeting was held on October 4, and proceedings 0egan at 3. 15. After a few announcements by the secretary in regard to the attendance of certain delegates who were unable to be present, the following order of business was proposed and adopted:

III. The report of the central bureau on the preparatory work for the international latitude service. Published in Annex A n·. At the conclusion of the reading of this report, on the proposition of the central bureau, a commission was constituted to make a report, at a future meeting, on the different propositions of the central bureau, on the subject of the international latitude service. This commission consisted of Messrs. Bakhuyzen, Preston, Bouquet de la Grye, Celoria, and Foerster. A commission on finances was nominated by the conference, on the proposition of the central bureau, and was composed of Messrs. Bassot, Foerster, Hennequin, Rosen, and Tinter.

THIRD SESSION.

The third session was held on October 5, and began at 9.50 a. m. After some preliminary remarks by the president, special reports were read on the following subjects:
l.

2.

3. 4. 5. 6.

The measurement of base lines, by Colonel Bassot. The state of the work of the Prussian survey in 1898, by Colonel von Schmidt. The determination of gravity in Baden, by Professor Haid. The work of the Italian Geodetic Commission during the years 1897-98, by M. Celoria. The geodetic operations in France during the years 1896-1898, by Colonel Bassot. The geodetic work executed in Bavaria during 18¢-1898, by General von Orff.

Before proceeding further on the national reports the Mexican delegate, Mr. Anguiano, made some remarks on the recent establishment of a geodetic commission in Mexico, whose labors will begin during the next year. He announced also that the Government of the United States had invited the Government of Mexico to take part in a great work which the Coast and Geodetic Survey proposed to execute, and which consists in the measurement of an arc of the meridian situated on the ninety-eighth degree west of Greenwich, and which is ultimately intended to be carried out from the Pacific Ocean to the seventieth degree of north latitude. Following these remarks, a paper on the trigonometrical operations in the United States was read by Mr. E. D. Preston; M. Sagasta following with a report of the work executed in Spain. No more national reports being presented at this sitting, the president of the International Committee of Weights and Measures, Mr. Foerster, m::o::e an interesting communication on the new alloy of nickel and steel which had just been discovered at Breteuil. In the course of his remarks it was stated, among other things, that the percentage of the component parts of the new alloy was 36 per cent of nickel and 64 of steel. This composition, after being subjected to a special treatment, has at ordinary temperatures, a coefficient of expansion equal to only one-fiftieth of that possessed by either of the components. At the bureau of weights and measures a meter rule has been kept at a constant length within one one-thousanth of a millimeter for several weeks, the temperature varying a number of degrees. This is a cl~ange of only one one-millionth in the length. The new metal has been given the name invar. It has been subjected to immersion in water for some time without the polished surfaces having suffered the least trace of oxidation. It takes an admirable polish and renders possible the tracing of fine lines thereon, for use of measurement. The price of the metal is less than that of platinum-iridium.

COAST AN'D GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898--<)9.

After considerable discussion on the subject, in which the fact was brought out that invar is less magnetic than steel, and that the geographic service of the French anny had already ordered a base apparatus of 4 meters in length of this material, and that tapes could be made of the material which would replace, advantageously, those used now in the measurement of base lines, the conference adjourned at 12.15.
4.
FOURTH SESSION.

The fourth meeting opened at 9.45 on October 7. After some introductory remarks a number of announcements, and further business of a routine nature the regular order yvas taken up as follows: M. Guarducci read a paper on the preparatory operations undertaken at the Military Geographical Institute of Florence to make the connection between Malta and Sicily. It was stated that the distance is 180 kilometers and that the line of sight between the two light-houses passed, approximately, 87 meters above the surface of the sea. The author presented a map showing the connecting triangles and distributed copies of a pamphlet entitled ''The Faini photo-electric apparatus.'' Mr. Boersch, in the name of the central bureau, then made a special report on the deviations of the vertical. A printed extract of the report was distributed and some verbal explanations were added. Following this a special report on longitudes, latitudes, and azimuths was read by M. Albrecht. During the presentation of this report a table was distributed giving the direct and indirect determinations of the difference of longitude between Greenwich and Paris up to the present time. The report expressed the hope that with the cooperation of the International Geodetic Association the interested observatories would cause to disappear as soon as possible the uncertainty now existing in the exact difference of longitude between these two points. At the request of the president the secretary then repeated in French certain parts of this report containing the statement, among other things, that the difference between the direct and indirect determinations amounted to 0·2 of a second of time, equal to 3 seconds of arc. An animated discussion now took place as to the action desirable on the part of the association. At the close of the general remarks the following resolution was offered by M. Foerster:
The association expresses the hope that the uncertainty which still remains in the determination of the difference of longitude between Paris and Greenwich may be removed as soon as possible. With this end in view it is desirable to have published definitely and completely all the observations and results already obtained and to invite the central bureau to study the whole question.

The resolution was adopted m~animously. Two motions were now made by the American delegate, one relative to the measure of the Peruvian arc, and the other concerning general problems studied by the· association.· 'fhe first of these resolutions was as follows:
An equatorial arc enters into the determination of the earth's figure with great weight. The Peruvian arc, measured in 1736-1739, is still used in combination with modern work, to which it bears no comparison from the point of view of ·accuracy or extent. Since the work was executed the theory of least squares has been discovered, spherical excess has found application in practical geodesy, and deflections of the plumb line have come to light. Improved methods have been applied to base measures, to triangulation, and to the determination of latitude. By a repetition of Bouguer's work with modern appliances we may expect an increase of accuracy

APPENDIX NO. 3.

sufficient to materially change the present accepted ellipticity of the earth. The greatest improvements would appear in the astronomic amplitude, and next to that in the horizontal angles. An unexplained discrepancy of several meters now exists between two determinations of a line upon which half the triangulation rests. The temperature was estimated for some of the base measures, and the bars were placed on the ground during measurement. From the method employed in finding the height of the base line there appears an uncertainty of several toises, so that the change in the reduction to sea level would have an appreciable effect on the adopted length of the arc. In view of these facts it is proposed that the International Geodetic Association express itself on the desirability of the measurement of the Peruvian arc, and it is therefore Moved that, in the opinion of the International Geodetic Association, the Peruvian arc should be remeasured with modem accuracy and extended as far as is practicable in the interest of geodetic science.

After some discussion, on the motion of Mr. Foerster, a commission, composed of Messrs. Bassot, Preston, and Sagasta, was appointed and charged with giving definite form to the matter proposed in the resolution, and invited to submit its propositions to the conference in a later session. The second motion brought forward by the American delegate was as follows:
In view of the desirability of obtaining more complete information of the present state of the measures of arcs and observations of gravity for the determination of the earth's size and shape, and with the object of utilizing these measures, it is moved that the president of this conference appoint a committee to find out, through the delegate from each country: (I) The present condition of any arc measure; ( 2) any contemplated extension of the same ; and ( 3) general infonnation bearing upon desirable combinations, or suggestions in any way tending to the furtherance of this prime object of the association; (4) the results of recent pendulum work bearing on the determination of the earth's figure; that the committee discuss the results of these communications and make such recommendations for future operations as may be warranted.

This proposition was discussed at length by Messrs. Helmert and Hirsch, the latter of whom introduced resolution that the motion should be referred to the central bureau, and that the bureau should be invited to act in accordance with it as much as possible. The resolution proposed by Mr. Hirsch was adopted unanimously. A special report on the observations of marigraphs, executed in different countries, and on the results that can be deduced therefrom, was then read by Mr. Bouquet de la Grye. Mr. Darwin then presented a short account of the recent operations executed in England and in India. The session closed at 12.35.

FIFTH SESSION.

The fifth meeting was held on Monday, October 10. Routine business being first disposed of, the president gave the floor to M. Bakhuyzen, president of the latitude commission, who made the statement that the commission had had several sittings and that Mr. Preston had been designated as secretary. The secretary then read the following report, which was submitted by the Commission:
The latitude commission, ~omposed of Messrs. Bakhuyzen, Bouquet de la Grye, Celoria, Foerster, and Preston, elected Mr. Bakhuyzen president and Mr. Preston secretary. After careful discussion, in which several other members of the conference took part, the commission has decided unanimously to submit to the conference the following proposition: First. The conference decides that the international study of the variation of the pole, provided

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18<)8-<}9. for in paragraph 4, article 6 of the convention of 1896, will be undertaken from the year 1899, u~der the direction and responsibility of the central bureau, and under the control of the bureau of the association. (See article 7 of the convention.) Second. With this end in view, the commission adopts the programme presented by the director of the central bureau, which provides for six stations, situated on the same parallel, of which four will be entirely at the expense of the association; and two, the one at Tchardjui, in Russia, and the one at Cincinnati, in the United States, will be subsidized. The commission accepts, with great satisfaction, the aid graciously offered by Russia and the United States for these last two stations. Third. The expense of this enterprise will be provided for in the amount indicated in paragraph 4 of article 6 of the convention. Fourth. The conference decides that the observations to be made for this purpose will be continued, first, during a period of five consecutive years. At the end of this period the general conference will pronounce upon the eventual continuation of the observations as well as the modifications which experience shall have suggested in regard to the methods to be employed. Fifth. During five years the observations will be made according to Talcott's method and in conformity with indications given in the "Report on Preparatory Researches for the Determination of the Variation of the Pole," presented to the conference by Messrs. Helmert and Albrecht. Sixth. Preliminary researches having indicated that the method of visual observations offers, at present, greater security than the photographic method, and as the last named would entail expenses beyond the available funds, the conference decides that during the first five years of observation the visual method will be employed. Seventh. As it is very desirable, especially for the determination of the annual periodic variation of the position of the terrestrial axis, to eliminate as much as possible the annual systematic errors, by observations made at a great number of stations, the conference decides that the bureau shall invite observatories which are interested in this enterprise to continl!e, or commence, determinations of the variation of latitude, leaving them, however, complete liberty in the employment of methods and instruments. Eighth. The conference decides that the central bureau is authorized to proceed, as soon as possible to the organization of the enterprise. The central bureau is also authorized to arrange the conditions of installation and working of the latitude stations, including the property rights of the apparatus and installations.. In cases where it will be necessary to have an understanding with the governments, the bureau of the association will undertake, according to article 4 of the convention, the correspondence and the ratification of agreements.

PRESTO~,

Secretary.

The conference immediately took up the discussion and vote on the different points. The president proposed to vote each proposition separately, and the general secretary of the conference was asked to read each one in French and in German before passing to the vote. Propositions I, 2, and 3, after discussion, were voted unanimously; 4 and 5, after an exchange of opinions between several members of the conference, were approved without discussion. M. Ferrero proposed the following form for proposition 6, which was adopted by the conference:
In the actual condition of things, and in consideration of the fact that the expense of the photographic method might possibly exceed the funds available for this work, the corference decides that for the first five years the optical method will be exclusively employed.

Proposition 7 was adopted without discussion. Proposition 8 was adopted by all the representatives, the vote being called for and taken by States. Communications were then made by Mr. Helmert in reference to the establishment near the latitude station, of a series of marks in the meridian for the sake of studying the eventual variations of the vertical, and by Mr. Tanakadate on the establishment of instruments at the Japanese latitude station, for studying earthquakes.

General Ferrero then had the floor to present a special report on triangulations. It was moved by Mr. Preston and unanimously carried that on the following day two sessions should be held-one in the morning and one in the afternoon. This would expedite business and make it possible for those delegates who found it necessary to l(!ave Stuttgart on the 12th to do so. At 12. 15 the meeting adjourned, to come together the following day at 9.30.
6. SIXTH SESSION.

The sixth meeting was held on the 11th of October, beginning at 9.45 a. m. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. Mr. Helmert presented a preliminary report on the relative measures of gravity by means of the pendulum. This was discussed by several members of the association, especially Mr. Lallemand and Mr. Foerster. In view of the discussion which took place, Mr. Helmert offered a motion in the following form:
Resolved, That the buseau of the International Geodetic Association is authorized to grant funds for the purpose of connecting the principal gravity stations.

As this proposition involved a financial question, it was submitted to the conference for a vote by States. It was unanimously adopted by the 15 representatives. Tht President then called upon Colonel Bassot to present the report of the special commission charged with the consideration of the Peruvian arc. Colonel Bassot invited Mr. Preston to read this report, which was as follows:
First. The International Geodetic Association expresses the wish that the Peruvian arc be remeasured with the utmost precision and with the most perfect means of the present time; and that the greatest possible extension be given to this arc. Second. The general conference recommends that as soon as possible the necessary reconnoissance for this enterprise be made. Third. In order to facilitate this work, the conference decides to allot, in conformity with article 4 of the convention, the sum of 20 ooo francs as a contribution to the expenses.

The third proposition was discussed by members of the conference, and after discussion the following amendment was proposed by Mr. Foerster, namely, that instead of section 3 the following be substituted: ·
The Bureau of the International Geodetic Association is authorized to communicate with the governments and scientific institutions interested and to make the necessary arrangements so that a reconnoissance for a new measure of the Peruvian arc may be taken up as soon as.possible.

This amendment was seconded by Mr. Hirsch, and being submitted to the conference, was, together with the first and second propositions, unanimously adopted. The report of the financial committee was then read, and after being accepted by the conference unanimously, the session closed at 12. ro.

SEVENTH SESSION.

Tuesday, October 11. The meeting was opened at 3.25 p. m. The president gave the floor to Mr. Helmert, who submitted to the conference the programme of the work of the central bureau for the two coming years. This report treated in detail the following matters:
First. Continuation of systematic calculations of the deviations of the vertical. Second. The organization of the international latitude service, and the study of the results which shall be obtained.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)9.
Third. Absolute measures of gravity by means of reversible pendulums. Fourth. A new detennination of the constants of Clairaut's formula concerning the variation of gravity with the latitude. Fifth. Researches on wooden meridian marks and their variations on account of humidity.

After a discussion of some length, the conference adopted unanimously the pro-. gramme of the work of the central bureau for the two following years. Mr. Bakhuyzen asked permission to make the following motion:
The conference expresses the desire that a connection of the triangulations of Germany and France on the parallel of the latitude of Paris should be made.

This proposition was adopted unanimously. A second proposition by Mr. Bakhuyzen was to the effect that national reports on geodetic work executed in the different countries, ·when deposited at the Bureau, should be considered as read by the authors. After discussion this motion was withdrawn by Mr. Bakhuyzen. The floor was then given to Mr. Rosen, who read a report on the geodetic work in Sweden. This was discussed by a number of members, and Mr. Rosen later deposited with the Bureau a copy of his memoir on the determination of the intensity of gravity at several stations in Sweden. Mr. Tinter now communicated the results of the geodetic work in Austria, reading first a report of Admiral von Kalmar on the measures of gravity executed by the officers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the years 1895-1898. Mr. Raoul Gautier then presented a report on the geodetic work executed in Switzerland from 1896-1898. General de Stubendorff communicated his report on the work done in Russia in the years 1896-1897. Immediately following this he read two obituary notices, one of General Forsch and the other of General Stebnitzky. Professor Hammer then read a report on the work in Wiirttemberg, after which Professor Koch distributed to the members of the association some copies of his memoir on the relative measures of gravity. The meeting adjourned at 5.20 p. m.
8. EIGHTH SESSION.

The eighth meeting opened at 10.50, October 12, General de Stubendorff presiding. It was announced that the order of exercises would be the communication of national reports yet remaining to be read, and the floor was given to Mr. de Bodola, who read his report on the work in Hungary. Mr. Lallemand gave an account of the work executed by the general leveling service in France since the last conference at Lausanne. The result of this work confirmed the equality of the level of the Mediterranean with the English Channel. The speaker presented to the conference a posthumous work by Colonel Gautier, entitled "Studies on the methods and instruments of precise leveling." General Hennequin now presented his report of the work in Belgium. This was followed by Mr. van de Sande-Bakhuyzen, who communicated a summary of the work executed in the Netherlands. After considerable discussion on the movement of the piers during pendulum observations, Mr. Helmert presented a report of the work of the Prussian Geodetic Institute.

Mr. Tanakadate read in English a report on the work of Japan. Mr. Nell then communicated the results of leveling done in Hesse-Darmstadt. A discussion was now opened as to the place of meeting for the next general conference. After some discussion M. Hirsch called attention to the fact that according to article 2 of the convention the choice of place belongs to the bureau of the association, consequently the conference could not make a decision; but, according to custom, a discussion on the part of members was in order, and the sentiments expressed would be considered by the bureau at the proper time. Mr. Helmert, in view of the fact that the next general conference might possibly be held three years later, expressed the wish that the national reports be collected and read each year. The vice-president presiding, General de Stubendorff expressed, on the part of the association, the most profound acknowledgment to the King and to the government of Wiirttemberg for the gracious welcome received by the conference at Stuttgart. Hearty thanks were also expressed on behalf of the members to their colleagues from Wiirttemberg, Messrs. Hammer and Koch, for their indefatigable services and kind attentions during the entire period of the conference. Mr. Helmert thanked the bureau and the permanent secretary for their arduous and impartial labors. At 12.15 the twelfth general conference of the International Geodetic Association was declared closed.

DETERMINATIONS OF GRAVITY AT THE POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, WORCESTER, MASS., AND AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK CITY, WITH PENDULUM APPARATUS B. 1899.
By EDWIN :-3MITH,

Assistant.

After the construction of the three pendulums, B,, B6 , B6 , with planes in place of knife edges, the B apparatus was not used in the field till 1898, when it was taken by Prof. J. H. Gore, with the \Vell111an Arctic expedition of that year. On May 14-16, 1898. before starting on the expedition, Professor Gore made a series of eight-hour swings with the three pendulums at the station in the basement of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office at Washington, D. C. He then swung them at three stationsTromsoe, Norway; Danes Island; and Leyden, Holland__:and returned to \Va-shington October, 1898. In the following December the Superintendent put the apparatus in charge of Assistant Edwin Smith for the determination of gravity at New York City and Worcester, Mass. ' Professor Gore was invited to take part in the swings to be made at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office before Mr. Smith should start, as these swings would be required in the reduction of his work. Work was begun January 3. 1899, but owing to very bad weather, which prevented the determination of the rates of the chronometers, and to the very leaky condition of the receiver, this series was given up January 6, incomplete. These swings are of so little value that they have not been reduced. After this date it· was not convenient for Professor Gore to take part in the work. Two series of eight-hour swings with each pendulum were then made, one beginning January 11 and ending January 14 and the other beginning January 23 and ending January 25, time observations having been obtained at the beginning and end of each series. During the first series centigrade thermometer No. 242, used by Professor Gore, was attached to the dummy pendulum, but as its corrections were not known it was turned over to the Office of Stand_ard Weights .and Measures for comparison, and thermometer No. 240 was attached to the dummy pendulum and used in all other work of the season. The corrections to thermometer No. 242, at temperatures at which it was used in series r, were furnished by the Assistant in Charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in a letter dated February 1, 1899. The corrections to thermometer No. 240 were copied from the files of the Instrument Division. They had been determined by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures April 20, 1897. The zero S.

point of this thermometer was subsequently redetermined. All these corrections will be found later in this paper. Early in February the B apparatus was taken to Worcester, Mass., where Dr. T. C. Mendenhall placed at the disposal of the observer all the facilities for gravity determinations of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The apparatus was mounted on a stone pier in the southwest corner of the constant-temperature room of the physical laboratory. This room is in the basement and about the middle of the north side of the building. The chronometers were also kept here. The chronograph was mounted on a shelf in the south anteroom of the constant-temperature room, and the transit (meridian teleNo.

'l'he geographical position of the constanttemperature room has been determined by connection with the triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and as communicated by Dr. T. C. Mendenhall, is as follows:

and also on February 10. A second series of twelve-hour swings was also made-the swings with each .pendulum being kept up between time observations. B, was swung between February 11 and 14; B5 , February 14 and 15, and B 6 between February 15 and 19. Owing to the ''blizzard'' of February 13 it was impracticable to go to the laboratory that night, in consequence of which there is one twenty-four hour swing with B,, February 13 a. m. to February 14 a. m. At the end of this swing the arc was only 3', but there was no difficulty in observing the coincidences. As soon as the swings at Worcester were completed, the apparatus was taken to New York City. The gravity station of 18q9 in New York is at the Columbia University, located between One hundred and sixteenth and One hundred and twentieth streets and Amsterdam avenue and the Boulevard.

were swung is in the subbasement of the physics building. The Austrian station of 1898 was also in this building and on the same level, and the two stations are separated only by the width of the building. A brick and cement pier, with stone cap, was constructed for the pendulum apparatus B and left standing. The chronometers and chronograph were in the same room with the pendulum apparatus. To avoid the delay in constructing a pier for the transit an attempt was made to get special time signals from the Naval Observatory in Washington, but after failures on two nights the transit (meridian telescope No. 2) was mounted on the stone coping at the southwest corner of the physics building. When not in use the telescope was taken into the building and the stand covered with a rubber cloth. At this station a series of eight-hour swings with each pendulum was made, beginning February 25 after time observations, and ending February 27 after time observations. No time was determined on February 26 on account of a storm, during which the stand of the transit was covered with ice.

The latitude and elevation of this station, as communicated by Prof. director of the observatory, are as follows:

The longitude, as determined by the tertiary triangulation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, is 73° 57' 43". Ori completion of the swings in New York City the apparatus was taken b8,ck to Washington, where an extended series of eight-hour swings with each pendulum was made, beginning March IO and ending March 16, time observations being made March IO, n, 12, 15, and 16. The Superintendent's instructions contemplated the determination of gravity at other stations, but as he found it necessary to assign Assistant Smith to other duties the work had to close for the season. At all the stations coincidences were noted with two sidereal chronometers-Negus Nos. 1823 and 1824. The rate of 1823 was determined from time observations with meridian telescope No. 2, except during the last series at Washington, when transit No. 19 was used. These last time observations, by direction of the Superintendent, were made by Assistant McGrath. The rate of chronometer No. 1824 was determined by comparing it on the chronograph with No. 1823, both before and after time observations. The pressure in the receiver was always kept as nearly as possible to 60"'"'. The results are reduced to standard conditions-infinitely small arc; temperature, 15° C.; pressure 6omm, mercury at o° C.; sidereal time, and inflexible support, using the coefficients as determined for the A pendulums, and found on pages 18 and 19 of Appendix No.. 1, Report 1894, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The A and B pendulums are made of the same alloy (copper 90 ·per cent and aluminum IO per cent), and are of the same form and dimensions as nearly as practicable. The temperature coefficient of the B pendulums has been determined by Assistant Putnam, but in the record he states that the temperature conditions were not satisfactory. The result, however, is nearly identical with that obtained for: the A pendulums . .On the following pages are given all necessary data and the results of this work:

APPENDIX No. 5.

1898-99.

RESULTING ELEVATIONS FROM SPIRIT· LEVELING BETWEEN DENVER, COLO., AND ROCK CREEK, WYO., FROM OBSERVATIONS BY ISAAC WINSTON, ASSISTANT, BETWEEN MAY 12 AND OCTOBER 21, 1899.
By
ISAAC WINSTON,

Assistant.

The following results of spirit leveling between Denver, Colo., and Rock Creek, Wyo., are herewith respectfully submitted. This is in continuation of the line of levels starting from bench mark K 3 on the bridge across the Mississippi at St. Louis, Mo., and running westward via Kansas City, Mo., to Denver, Colo. The present extension carries the line 342 kilometres, or 214 statute miles, westward along the Union Pacific Railroad via Cheyenne, Wyo. The line begins at bench marks A. and B0 , and the. heights of these marks will be found in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1898-99. The heights are relative and refer to the so-called "City Directrix" at St. Louis as the zero or starting level. This level has been transferred to bench mark K 3 at the St. Louis bridge. Should absolute heights be desired, this starting level may be taken as 125 ·3 metres, or 412 feet, above the Gulf of Mexico; the exact elevation can only be given after the connecting lines. are completecl and adjusted.*
INSTR U111ENTS.

Micrometer spirit level No. s was used. This instrument was partially reconstructed in the shop of the Survey in 1899 before being taken to the field, and the following changes made: The telescope was cast in one tube of nickel-iron, the alloy having a coefficient of expansion of 0·000004 per degree Centigrad~. The striding level was mounted on a piece of the same metal and the supporting pieces shortened in order to bring the graduated surface of the level vial as near as possible to the line of collimation of the telescope. An aluminum cover to the vial was provided, with a glass top, and this cover is fastened only at its center to allow expansion in both directions without strain
*The elevations assigned to A. and B,, in the tabulation on page 289 were the best available at the time the computation was made. For the best values now available (April, 1900) see page 479 of Appendix No. 8 of this report. J. F. H. 285

on the metal which carries the level vial. An adjustable mirror was mounted over the striding level. Prisms were mounted on one side of the instrument in such a way as to enable the observer to set and watch the level bubble without changing his position from the eye end of the telescope.

The wooden metric rods P and Q (for description see Appendix No. 8, Report for 1895) were used. The targets and chains were removed from these rods and a centimetre graduation, alternately black and white, was painted on the face, to enable the observer to read the rod by using the telescope.

Two independent lines, in opposite directions, were run under the following instructions: 1. Except when specific instructions are given to proceed otherwise, all lines are to be leveled independently in both the forward and the backward direction. 2. It is desirable that the backward measurement on each section should be made under different atmospheric conditions from those which occurred on the forward measurement. It is especially-desirable to make the backward measurement in fue afternoon if the forward measurement was made in the forenoon, and vice versa. The observer is to secure as much difference of conditions between the forward and backward measurements as is possible without materially delaying the work for that purpose. 3. On all sections upon which the forward and backward measures differ by more

than 4"'"'.o ,,JK. (in which K is the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks, in kilometres), both the forward and backward measures are to be repeated until two such measures fall within the limit. 4. The programme of observation at each station is to be as follows: Set up and level the instrument. Read the three lines of the diaphragm as seen projected against the front (or rear) rod, each reading being taken to the nearest millimetre (estimated) and the bubble being held continuously in the middle of the tube (i.e., both ends reading the same). As soon as possible thereafter read the three lines of the diaphragm as seen projected against the rear (or front) rod, estimating to millimetres as before, and holding the bubble continuously in the middle of the tube. During all observations the telescope is to be erect and the striding level with a particular leg toward the objective-that is, there are to be no reversals of the telescope or striding level. 5. At each rod station the rod thermometer is to be read and the temperature recorded. 6. At stations of odd numbers the backsight is to be taken before the foresight, and at even stations the foresight is to be taken before the backsight. 7. The maximum difference in length between a foresight and the corresponding backsight is to be IO metres. The actual difference is to be made as small on each pair of sights as is feasible by the use of good judgment without any expenditure of time for this particular purpose. 8. The recorder shall keep a record of the rod intervals subtended by the extreme lines of the diaphragm on each backsight, together with their continuous sum between bench marks. A similar record shall be kept for the foresights. The two continuous sums shall be kept as nearly equal as is feasible without the expenditure of extra time for that purpose by setting the instrument beyond (or short of) the middle point between the back and front rods. The two continuous sums shall not be allowed to differ by more than a quantity corresponding to a distance of 20 metres. 9. The inequality of collars shall be determined at the beginning and end of each season of work. The collimation error shall be determined once for each day of work, by a set of three readings in the direct position and two in the reverse position of the telescope. The error of adjustment or'the striding level shall be determined at least twice on each day of work by a set of three readings in the ordinary position and two in the reverse position. IO. Notes for future use in studying leveling errors shall be inserted in the record, indicating the time of beginning and ending of the work of each half day; indicating the weather conditions, especially as to cloudiness and wind; indicating whether each portion of the line is run toward or away from the sun; and such other notes as promise to be of value in studying errors. 11. The instrument shall be shaded from the direct rays of the sun both during the observations and the movement from station to station. 12. The maximum length of sight shall be 150 metres. and the maximum is to be attained only under the most favorable circumstances.

RESULTING ELEVATIONS FROM SPIRIT LEVELING BETWEEN ABILENE, KANS., AND NORFOLK, NEBR., FROM OBSERVATIONS BY A. L. BALDWIN, ASSISTANT, AND B. E. TILTON, AID, BETWEEN MAY 8 AND OCTOBER 17, 1899.

By B. E. TIX.TON, Aid.

The following results of spirit leveling between Abilene, Kans., and Norfolk, Nebr., are herewith respectfully submitted. The line leaves the transcontinental line of levels, which is now complete from Sandy Hook, N. J., to Rock Creek, Wyo., at bench mark B 1 at Abilene, Kans. To avoid depending wholly upon a single bench mark for this connection, that portion of the transcontinental line,' about 14 kilometres, between Abilene and Solomon, Kans. (B. M. Ci), was rerun. The difference of elevation of B1 and C1 as given in Appendix No. 4, Report of 1897, is 5 '6289 metres. The difference by the lines of this year is 5.6268 metres. The agreement is sufficiently close to indicate that bench mark B1 has remained stable since it was established in 1895. The elevations here given depend upon the elevation above bench mark K 3 at St. Louis, of B. M. B1 at Abilene, Kans., as given in Appendix No. 4, Report of 1897, page 278, viz, 226m'7782. They are therefore relative elevations only. To obtain the constant correction necessary to reduce to absolute elevations above mean sea level, see Appendix No. 8 of this Report. The route is shown in the accompanying sketch. Connections were made with stations Blue Hill and Shelton East Base, of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian, and with bench marks of the United States Geological Survey at Superior, Columbus and Norfolk, Nebr. The length of the main line is 470 kilometres (292 miles). The lengths of the side lines are as follows:

to the telescope; by using a nickel-iron alloy, having a small coefficient of expansion, for the metal parts of the telescope and striding level; and by adding a device for reading the level without moving the head away from the eye end of the telescope. The value of one division of the striding level is 2" · 45. The inequality of the collars was determined in May and October, 1899, and gave a value of ·39 of one division of the level, the object end collar being the larger of the two. The new paraffined wooden metric rods R and S were used from the beginning of the season until September 1. On August 9 rod R was slightly injured and was used in this condition until September 1, on which date rod R 2 was received and replaced rod R during the remainder of the season. The length of rods between graduations on the metal plugs at o"' · 1 and 3m · 1 as determined by the Office of Weights and Measures, u~ing a coefficient of expansion of 0·000004 per degree Centigrade and reduced to o° C., are as.follows:

To determine the dates of change of length in the rods, if any appreciable change should occur, measures of the length of the rods were taken with a steel tape at frequent intervals. These measures indicate that the lengths of R and S changed gradually during the first few days of field use and remained of constant length thereafter. Rod R 2 seems to have changed in length soon after arriving in the field. Accordingly the following values were used in the computation:
Mean length of R and S = 3m·OOO<J6 at o° C. between May 8 and June 1. Mean length of R and S = 3m·oo146 at o° C. between June 1 and September 1. Mean length of R. and S = 3m·oo131 at o° C. between September I and October ·17.

The first of these values is the mean of (1), (2), (°4), and (5) given above, and depends upon the assumption that the rods were gradually changing in length during that time. The second value is the mean of (2) and (5) given above, and depends upon the assumption that the rods remained of constant length from June 1 to September 1, at which time R was replaced by R The third value is the mean of (5) and ( 7) given above, and depends upon the assumption that R 2 changed length soon after arriving in the field, giving a practically constant length for R. and S. The coefficient of expansion used in the computation in fixing the actual lengths of the rods while in use was 0·000004 per Centigrade degree. The index errors of rods R and R. are practically zero. Measures in May and November show the first 0·1 metre to be correct within 0·1 millimetre. Rod S has an index error of - 0·2 millimetre, as shown by measures taken in May and November. This very small index error was neglected in making the computation. The method of observing is radically different from that used in previous. years.

It is sufficiently indicated by the following general instructions issued at the beginning

of the field season: I. Except when specific instructions are given to proceed otherwise, all lines are to be leveled independently in both the forward and the backward direction. 2. It is desirable that the backward measurement on each section should be made under different atmospheric conditions from those which occurred on the forward measurement. It is especially desirable to make the backward measurement in the afternoon if the forward measurement was made in the forenoon, and vice versa. The observer is to secure as much difference of conditions between the forward and backward measurements as is possible without materially delaying the work for that purpose. 3. On all sections upon which the forward and backward measures differ by more than 4mm.o.JK. (in which K is th.e distance leveled between adjacent bench marks, in kilometres), both the forward and backward measures are to be repeated until two two such measures fall within the limit. 4. The programme of observation at each station is to be as follows: Set up and level the instrument. Read the three lines of the diaphragm as seen projected against the front (or rear) rod, each reading being taken to the nearest millimetre (estimated) and the bubble being held continuously in the middle of the tube (i. e., both ends being the same). As soon as possible thereafter read the three lines of the diaphragm as seen projected against the rear (or front) rod, estimating to millimetres as before, and holding the bubble continuously in the middle of the tube. During all observations the telescope is to be erect, and the striding level with a particular leg toward the objective; that is, there are to be no reversals of telescope or striding level. 5. At each rod station the rod thermometer is to be read and the temperature recorded. 6. At stations of odd numbers the backsight is to be taken before the foresight, and at even stations the foresight is to be taken before the backsight. 7. The maximum difference in length between a foresight and the corresponding backsight is to be 10 metres. The actual difference is to be made as small on each pair of sights as is feasible by the use of good judgment without any expenditure of time for this particular purpose. 8. The recorder shall keep a record of the rod intervals subtended by the extreme lines of the diaphragm on each backsight, together with their continuous sum between bench marks. A similar record shall be kept for the foresights. The two continuous sums shall be kept as nearly equal as is feasible without the expenditure of extra time for that purpose by setting the instrument beyond (or short of) the middle point between the back and front rods. The two continuous sums shall not be allowed to differ by more than a quantity corresponding to a distance of 20 metres. 9. The inequality of collars shall be determined at the beginning and end of each season of work. The collimation error shall be determined once for each day of work, by a set of three readings in the direct position and two in the reverse position of the telescope. The error of adjustment of the striding level shall be determined at least twice on

each day of work by a set of three readings in the ordinary position and two in the reverse position. 10. Notes for future use in studying leveling errors shall be inserted in the record indicating the time of beginning and ending of the work of each half day, indicating the weather conditions especially as to cloudiness and wind, indicating whether each portion of the line is run toward or away from the sun, and such other notes as promise to be of value in studying errors. 11. 'l'he instrument shall be shaded from the direct rays of the sun both during the observations and the movement from station to station. 12. 'l'he maximum length of sight shall be 150 metres, and the maximum is to be attained only under the most favorable circumstances. In the table of results it will be seet\ that a few sections show a greater divergence between the forward and backward lines than that which would be allowed by the criterion 4mm ,,/K. '!'his was caused by mistakes in the field computation which were not discovered until the revision. No measurement was rejected unless it differed from the mean of all measurements by more than 6 millimetres. Eleven such measurements were rejected, all appearing in the table of results. 'I'wo rejected measurements do not appear in the table of results, one showing a difference of more than 10 metres between the lengths of corresponding backsight and foresight, and the other showing too large a difference between the upper and lower interval of the wires. 'l'he lettering of the permanent bench marks is carried continuously from A to Z in each State. Where more than one alphabet is required the letters of the succeeding alphabets are denoted by subscripts. 'l'he resulting elevations above K 3 , St. Louis, are contained in the succeeding table. 'I'he elevations of the rails in front of the railroad stations along the route were taken. '!'hey are given in tabular form following the principal table of results. Sixty-four new permanent bench marks were set, the mean distance between them being 7 ·9 kilometres. 'l'he temporary bench marks were placed at a mean distance of l kilometre apart. For descriptions of permanent bench marks see pp. 647-653, Appendix No. 8 of this Report. 'l'he probable error for the mean result for a section, here averaging 1 kilometre in length, is

'V 4 [s] in which d is the discrepancy between the forward and backward measures, and s is the number of sections. 'l'he probable error of the difference of elevation of any two bench marks is

Report by 0.

FERGUSON,

Assistant.

The following results of spirit leveling between Gibraltar, Mich., and Cincinnati, Ohio, are herewith respectfully submitted: These elevations are carried from "U. S. B. M. Gibraltar 1877," of which the elevation is assum~d to be 582'45 feet (=177"'·5292), as given in Professional Papers of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., No. 24, page 616. This line is also connected at Gibraltar, Mich., with B. M. No. 2 of 1875, given in the same report, and with U. S. D. M. No. 1, in the same town, established in 1898, on a line of levels between Lakes Erie and Huron run under the direction of the United States Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways. The difference of elevation found between these three bench marks agreeci. very closely with former results. The elevations given in this Report are therefore only relative. To obtain the corrections necessary to reduce them to absolute elevations, see Appendix No. 8 of this Report. The route, as shown on the sketch, follows the Michigan Central Railroad to 'l'oledo, Ohio, and the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad thence to Cincinnati, and the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis and the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern from Cincinnati to Lawrenceburg, Ind. There were a few minor exceptions where the line followed highways, city streets, or canal towpaths. The main purpose of this line is to connect the levels as carried through the Great Lakes by the. United States Lake Survey and other organizations with the transcontiuental line'of levels run from Sandy Hook westward along the thirty-ninth parallel by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The connection with the transcontinental line was made at bench mark T (Ohio) , also known as Cincinnati City Bench Mark No. 1, and at U (Indiana), at Lawrenceburg. Approximate connections were also made at permanent bench mark LXV and temporary bench marks n9, n8, and 117 of the transcontinental line between Cincinnati and Lawrenceburg. Tht:se connections were approximate because in each case either a portion of the stone was broken off or the exact point formerly used as the bench mark could not be identified. Furthermore, it is believed
323

by the "Big Four" civil engineers that the whole river bank in the vicinity of 119, 118, and 117 is very slowly sliding toward the Ohio River, and the elevations obtained in reference to bench mark T in Cincinnati support this belief. Connections we:e als'.J made with United States bench marks in Toledo, Ohio, and

APPENDIX NO. 7.

bench marks of the Queen and Crescent Railroad on the bridge seat of the south end of the long span (519 feet) of their bridge over the Ohio River at Cincinnati, Ohio, and with one or more city bench marks in each city along the line. The elevation of the top of the railroad rail was determined in front of each station and at each railroad crossing along the line. The instrument used was the Coast and Geodetic Survey level No. l modified as indicated below.* The level vial used was· marked "No. 19, 2"·23, K. & E." The value of each 2-mm division of this vial is 1"·94, as determined at the Office, using a level trier. The telescope has a focal length of 36 centimetres ( = l 4 inches) and a clear aperture of 29 millimetres ( = 1 ~ inches). The spider lines in the focus of the eyepiece, which are read against the rod, ar~ placed unusually close together, the interval subtended on the rod being approximately 0·3 metre for a 100-metre sight. The power of the telescope being approximately 38 diameters, the visual angle of the extreme wires is 38 tan- 1 0·003 = 6 76 °, whereas it is not unusual in other leveling instruments for this angle to be as great as 20°.. This fact that the visual angle is so small makes observing much easier than it otherwise would be, and it insures that only the central portion of the 1::yepi~e field, in which the images are most distinct, shall be used. A further benefit comes from the fact that the lower line of sight traverses air farther away from and therefore less disturbed by the hotter or colder surface of the ground. Three great improvements were secured by the remodeling of the instrument in the spring of 1899. ( l) The distance between the line of collimation and the axis of the level vial was greatly reduced. ( 2) The material used in the construction is a nickeliron alloy having a coefficient of expansion of 0·000004 per centigrade degree, about the same as that of wood. (3) An apparatus for reading the position of the bubble without removing the eye from the eyepiece was added to the instrument. The ends of the bubble on the scale are reflected by a mirror and two prisms through a tube located in exact position for the left eye when the right eye is at the eyepiece. The ends of the bubble appear to be only from X(_ to 76 inch apart, making the visual angle between them comfortably small. This device for reading the bubble is superior to the inclined plane mirror often used for that purpose, for it concentrates the vision on the ends of the bubble, shuts out distracting patches of light and images of trees and other objects, which sometimes appear so prominent in the inclined plane mirror that it is hard to see the bubble. It has the further good quality of introducing no parallax between the ends of the bubble and the level scale. The broad but light wooden tripod head makes the instrument very steady even in a smart breeze. The instrument maintains all its adjustments remarkably well. The new paraffined rods T and U, graduated to centimetres, were used. The cross section of these rods is symmetrical and in form of a cross. The methods of observing are the same as those given in Appendix 6 of this Report. A strong system of permanent bench marks is established along this line. In the towns and cities some bench marks are usually placed off from the railroad on public buildings, as well as on railroad masonry, such as culverts, bridge abutments and piers,

This number, 158, corresponds to an average distance of l "8 miles between permanent bench marks. Besides these there are 227 temporary or auxiliary bench marks which serve to break the line into short sections. The length of the main line is 431 ·8 kilometres; the combined length of the side lines is 2ro kilometres, making the total length 458"8 kilometres = 285·2 miles. The average length of a section of the main line is l "6 kilometre and the average length of a sight on the main line is 60 metres. Three and one-half per cent of the work did not check within the prescribed limit 4mm .,/K (in which K is the distance between adjacent bench marks in kilometres). Such sections were rerun in opposite directions as before. The number of working days, making no deduction for stormy weather or for time spent in moving, was 152 days. The average daily rate of progress was therefore 3 ·a kilometres of completed line. Thirty-five per cent of the distance from Gibraltar, Mich., to Cincinnati was comprised in the following three long loops:

Each loop was run southward over the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad. The first was run northward over the Detroit and Lima Northern Railroad, the second over the Cincinnati and Middletown and "Big Four" railroads, and the third northward along the towpath of the Miami and Erie Canal, and along the Pennsylvania Railroad to Hamilton. The differences of elevation between successive bench marks were recomputed in the Office, introducing various small corrections which had been neglected in the field computation. The index correction of rods T and U at the beginning of the season was -o· 1 millimetre, the zero of the graduation being that distance below the bottom of the rod in each case. At the end of season the index correction was -o· 3 millimetre for rod T and -0·4 millimetre for rod U. These index corrections if applied would not

LEVELING, GIBRALTAR TO CINCINNATI.

change the computeq difference of elevation of any two successive bench marks by more than o· I millimetre, except in those cases in which direct readings were taken on a bench mark without the use of a rod. Even in such a case the maximum error made by neglecting to apply the index correction is 0·4 millimetre, and even this small error is not carried forward. The index corrections were not applied, being so small and being compensating in their nature. The corrections due to curvature and refraction are both proportional to the square of the distance. The latter was assumed to be one-eighth of the former and of opposite sign, and the two corrections were applied as one. Instead of applying this correction to each individual sight, it was applied with reference to the difference of corresponding foresights and backsights, using for that purpose a table of \vhich the two arguments are the length of sight and the difference of length of sights. 1'he correction is minus if the backsights are longer. The computation being carried to the nearest o· r millimetre only, this correction was appreciable for about 1 per cent of the settings, which could be detected by a mere inspection of the record. The correction due to inequality of collars of the telescope was applied to each. section between bench marks, and was determined from the excess of the sum of lengths of the backsights over the foresights. At the beginning of the season, May 30, the inequality was observed in the pendulum room at the Office. The error was such that the angle between the line of collimation and the surfaces of the collars was 1 11 ·24 = 0·006 millimetre per metre, the object collar being the larger. Again, after returning from the field it was observed on December 5 in the same place, and found to be 11 2 ·75 = 0·013 millimetre per metre, the object collar being the larger, as before. The first value was used for the first three months of the field season and the last value for the last three months. The correction due to the error of the striding level was applied to each section between bench marks and was determined from the excess of the sum of the lengths of backsights over the foresights and from the observed value of the level error on that half day, using a double argument table. The correction due to the error of collimation was applied to each section between bench marks and was computed in a manner similar to that just stated for the error of the striding level. Three metres of the graduated portion of each rod is marked off on four metal plugi:; i:;et in the face of the rod. These lengths were determined by the Office of Standard Weights and Measures on May 27, 1899, just before the field work began, and again on December 22, just after the close of field seai:;on. They were also measured at seven other .times during the field season by a steel tape, graduated to millimetres, used direct and reversed, under a reading glass, the temperature being noted. These field measurements were rendered comparable by reducing the observed lengths to 9° C., taking into account the coefficient of expansion of both the tape and the rod.

Mean length of r metre on rods T and U on December 22, 1899, = 1m·ooo463. The field measurements of the rod lengths are relative only, as the correction to the tape was not known. They show that within very small limits the rods remained of the same length from July 21 to December 4. At the end of the season, December 22, they were longer than at beginning of season, May 27, according to the measurements by the Weights and Measures Office. It was therefore concluded that the change of length occurred prior to July 2 r; that is, soon after they were taken to the field. The same phenomenon has been observed with paraffined rods before on this Survey. Up to July 2 r only small differences of elevation had been measured, therefore the mean length found on December 22 was used for the whole computation, viz, rm on rods= 1m·ooo463 at o° C. This correction for length of rod will numerically increase the difference of elevation between bench marks in every case. The mean temperature of the rods given for each section between consecutive bench marks being above o° C., in every case, the effect of the correction for temperature was to increase numerically the approximate difference of elevation. The amount of the correction is the product of the mean temperature by the coefficient of expansion ( 0·000004) by the approximate difference of elevation. The algebraic sum of these corrections being applied to each approximate difference of elevation, gives the corrected difference of elevation between bench marks for that line. The mean of these corrected differences for the forward and backward lines, or

any number of lines, between two bench marks gives the mean difference of elevation, but with the consideration that the sign of differences of elevation for all back runs between these bench marks must obviously now be changed in order that their differences may have the same significance as the forward differences. To find the divergence, or error of closure, between two bench marks, take the sum of the differences of elevation as found by the forward and back lines, or by the mean forward and mean back lines, and change its sign and this quantity will be the divergence or partial discrepancy. A plus sign indicates that the elevation has been carried too low. Owing to having kept the errors of the striding level and collimation small, and to good pacing on the part of the rodmen, and, lastly, to having taken some care at the closing setting of each run to make sum of lengths of backsights approximately equal to the sum of lengths of foresights, the corrections are quite small. The sum, without regard to sign, of all the corrections due to curvature and refraction for the whole season's work was only 5·9 millimetres; for collar inequality was i.8 millimetres, and for striding level and collimation was 4 ·7 millimetres. A measure of the precision and reliability of the work is furnished by the following considerations. Total number of lines run was 566. One pair of these sllO'wed a discrepancy of 100 millimetres. This line was rerun and, moreover, the error was located on the ground between two footplate impressions. If but one line in 283 pairs shows a large discrepancy from its duplicate line, the probability of both lines containing a large error of the same sign and magnitude is very remote. Eleven other pairs of these 566 lines showed errors of closure greater than the prescribed limit 4m'" ,Ji< (in which K is the distance in kilometres between adjacent bench marks). The first quantity given below is the error of closure, the second is

I suspect, therefore, that some of these errors were caused by a considerable settling of footplates between foresights and backsjghts, owing to unfortunate settings thereof.

The three long loops were adjusted for errors of closure. The first loop, between bench marks 92 and U, 8 r ·6 kilometres around, had an error of closure of -4 ·9 millimetres. It was broken into two loops by the bench mark R,, which was common to the two sides of the loop. Thi!! closures of these separate loops were - 1 ·3 millimetres and - 3'6 millimetres. 'fhe second loop, r r 2 ·o kilometres around, with an error of closure 9·0 millimetres, had two cross lines, first from bench mark H to 1 , and second of 3 3 from ·L3 to M3 , thus furnishing eight observation equations with five unknown quantities. The third loop, 86'6 kilometres around, with an error of closure of 9·3 millimetres, had three cross lines, the first from bench mark 209 to 8 4 , the second from 210 to Q4 , and the third from 211 to 213 1 thus furnishing eleven observation equations with seven unknown quantities. The errors of closure of the small loops into which these two large loops were broken by the cross lines are much smaller than the closure for the whole loop. These last two loops were adjusted by least squares.

In computing the probable error of the portion Gibraltar, Mich., to Cincinnati, Ohio, the probable error per kik>metre over the portion covered by the three loops was taken to be the same as the mean over the three portions run in small sections. If it had been computed from the errors of closure of these loops it would have been considerably less. If the divergence between the forward and backward lines is all due to accidental errors, the divergence on any portion of the line is equally liable to be greater than or less than 2r. The table indicates that this condition is nearly fulfilled and therefore indicates that the constant errors are very small.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.
By
JOHN

F.

HAYFORD,

Inspector of' Geodetic Wo1·k and Chief of the Computing- Division.

INTRODUCTION.

The fourfold purpose of this appendix is to bring the publication in detail of the results of precise leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey as nearly as possible up to date; to set forth the methods employed in making a general adjustment of the preciselevel net covering the eastern half of the United States and involving leveling by other organizations as well as by the Coast and Geodetic Survey; to put into print in convenient form for ready reference a concise compilation of the corrected elevations resulting from this general adjustment; and, finally, to make available in form for general use, examination, and criticism the more important items of information and opinions in regard to precise leveling which have been acquired during the course of a long and . careful investigation of the problem of making such an adjustment and of securing the highest degree of accuracy in future precise level observations consistent with a reasonable degree of economy and rapidity. The greater portion of the precise leveling done by the Coast and Geodetic Survey has already been published in detail in the various annual reports. The results from certain lines which have not yet been published are here shown in detail,* namely, the lines between Vicksburg and Meridian, Miss., 236 kilometres, run in 1896-97; from Little Rock, Ark., to Holliday, Kans., via London, Van Buren, and Chester, Ark., Harrisonville, Mo., and Olathe, Kans., with branch lines to Fort Smith, Ark., and Pleasant Hill, Mo., 795 kilometres, run in 1888, 1889, 1891, 1893, and 1894; from Colorado Springs to Denver, Colo. , 119 kilometres, and Limon to Denver, Colo., l 46 kilometres, run in l 898; and the line between St. Augustine and Cedar Keys, Fla., 2 l 6 kilometres, run in l8g2, 1893, and 1894. The results from the three lines run in 1899, namely, Denver, Colo., to Rock Creek, Wyo., 342 kilometres; Solomon and Abilene, Kans., to Norfolk, Nebr., 537 kilometres; Gibraltar, Mich., to Cincinnati, Ohio, and Lawrenceburg, Ind., 459 kilometres, are given in Appendices No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 of this report. The combined length of the lines thus published for the first time in this report is 2 850 kilometres.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

The first step toward making a general adjustment of the precise level net covering the eastern half of the United States was to collect in convenient form for reference the general results from all the precise leveling which is connected with said net. In doing this all the annual reports of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of the Chief of Engineers published up to date (March, 1900) were examined carefully in detail. A general examination was also made of a large collection of other miscellaneous literature relating to precise levels, which is found scattered through various publications. The Corps of Engineers of the United States Army, the United States Geological Survey, th.e Unit~d States Board on Deep Waterways were then requested to cooperate by furnishing such unpublished data as to bring the collection as nearly as possible up to date. All these organizations responded with a heartiness and generosity which has increased very materially the value of this publication.* The Pennsylvania Railroad Company also responded to a similar request for cooperation by furnishing a copy of its official list showing the location and elevation of its permanent bench marks. The net proceeds of this compilation and correspondence were a collection of the general results from over 20 ooo kilometres (over 12 ooo miles) of spirit leveling and of 2 200 kilometres (nearly 1 400 miles) of accurate water levels, all, with the exception of the line across Florida, 216 kilometres ·( = r 34 miles), forming links of the precise .level net, or spur lines attached to said net. t These lines were run with a variety of instruments showing radical differences in design. The methods of observation have also differed radically. Unit lengths of these various lines are therefore presumably entitled to various weights according to the actual accuracy attained by the various instruments, methods and observers. Presumably, also, the errors involved in the measured differences of elevation on these various lines do not all belong to the accidental class, and it is therefore desirable to make as careful a search for systematic errors and the laws which they follow as is feasible; to eliminate such errors by applying special corrections if possible; and to pay due respect · to the evidence in regard to uneliminated systematic errors in fixing the relation between the assigned weights and the lengths of the lines and in fixing the relative weights assigned to different classes of lines. The lines along which the investigations of relative weights and of systematic errors have proceeded were suggested largely by the work of a committee of four appointed by the Superintendent 011 November 29, 1898, to consider the subject of precise levels and in particular to investigate ''the accuracy of various methods, their relative freedom from systematic errors, and their relative quickness, cheapness, and facility for the reduction of the observations." t This committee met for three or more hours on nearly every working day from that day until their report was submitted on February 9, 1899. The extensive compilation of facts made by this committee and included in their report has been used freely in the preparation of this appendix. The facts are here grouped in a different way, however, and presented in a more concise form, with a view to bringing out more clearly the relations between them. Much new material has become available since the committee made its report, and considerable time has been spent in

digesting the old material more thoroughly. In the following pages an attempt is made to exhibit clearly to the reader the induct~ve process which l~d from the recorded facts to the relative weights assigned in the final adjustment, to the form in which that adjustment was made, and to the changes in methods of observing and instruments made in l 899 and I 900. The corrected elevations resulting from the general adjustment, of all bench marks of a permanent character connected with the level net, are given on pages 472-548 in the order in which the bench marks occur in passing along certain lines. The order in which the various lines are placed is somewhat arbitrary. Coast and Geodetic Survey lines run previous to 1899 are placed first; then the Coast and Geodetic Survey lines of 1899; lines by the United States engineers, including water levels along the Great Lakes; lines run by or in cooperation with the Deep Waterways Commission; the two lines run by C. H. Van Orden (formerly Assistant on Coast and. Geodetic Survey) to Greenbush, N. Y.; the lines by the United States Geological Survey; and, finally, the Pennsylvania Railroad line from Harrisburg to the vicinity of Pittsburg. The corresponding descriptions of bench marks are placed in approximately the same order. The index to corrected elevations and descriptions of bench marks on pages 453-471 is arranged in alphabetic order under each State, the States being also placed in alphabetic order. Nearly all of the descriptions of bench marks established by other organizations than the Coast and Geodetic Survey have already been printed elsewhere, but are here reprinted to make them easily accessible.

the line is 2 36 kilometres ( 147 miles). It connects at its western end with the Coast and Geodetic Survey precise level line along the Mississippi River, and with the United States Engineer lines from Vicksburg westward to Shreveport, and from Vicksburg northward to Greenwood and Greenville. At its eastern end it connects with the Coast and Geodetic Survey precise level line between Biloxi, Miss., and Odin, Ill., and with the United States Engineer line from Meridian, Miss., to Demopolis and Birmingham, Ala. A simultaneous double line was run over the whole distance excepting the river crossing, using the programme of observation indicated on page 417. The river crossing, made between bench marks 494 metres apart, was made by taking simultaneous observations from opposite banks, using levels No. 5 and No. 6, on the forenoon of November 7, 1896. The lines of sight were from 3 to 4 metres above the surface of the water. After half the observations had been made the observers changed places, each taking his own instrument with him. The lengths of the rods were determined at the Office of Standard Weights and Measures on October 30, 1896, just before the beginning of field work, and again on March 24, 1897, soon after the close of the season. The inequality of collars was determined at the beginning and end of the season. The corrections for length and temperature of rods, and for index errors of rods, as well as for the measured angle between the target and the horizon, for the inequality of collars, for curvature and for refraction, were applied in the Office computation. The direct results of the leveling are shown in the following tabulation. The distances from B. M. F, at Biloxi are tµeasured along the level line from Biloxi to Carrollton and New Orleans, and thence up the river to Vicksburg. The elevation of the top of the railroad rail was determined in front of eighteen railroad stations along the line, indicated thus in the tabulation R. R. S. ( 1), K R. S. ( 2), etc. The names of these stations are given in the list following the tabulation, pages 360-361.

LITTLE ROCK-HOLLIDAY LINE.

The long line from Little Rock, Ark., to Holliday, Kans., with its branches, was run in several sections in several different years by various observers. The section, 135 kilometres ( =84 miles) long, from B. M. West Base near Little Rock westward along the railroad now known as the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern to B. M. XX at London, Ark., was run by Isaac Winston, Subassistant; P.A. Welker, Subassistant, and Gershom Bradford, Assistant, between July 5 and September 30, 1888, using levels No. 2 and No. 3 and rods B, C, and D. The section, 132 kilometres ( =82 miles) long, from B. M. XX at London, Ark., westward along the same railroad to B. M. XLII at Fort Smith, Ark., was run by Isaac Winston, Assistant; J. H. Gray, Subassistant, and F. A. Young, recorder, between July 24 and October 22, 1889, using levels No. 5 and No. 6 and rods L, M, N, and O. The remaining portions of this line, Little Rock to Holliday, were run by Isaac Winston, Assistant, using levels No. 5 and No. 6 and rods I and K. The section, 40 kilometres ( =25 miles) long, from B. M. XXXVIII at Van Buren, Ark., on the London-Fort Smith line, northward along the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad to B. M. XLIX at Chester, Ark., was run between October 1 3 and November 2, 1893. The section, 251 kilometres ( = 156 miles) long, from B. M. XCVI at Boston, Mo., southward along the Missouri Pacific Railroad to Carthage, Mo., and thence along the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad to B. M. XLVIII at Chester, Ark., was run between June 22 and October 9, 1894. The section, 143 kilometres (=89 miles) long, from temporary B. M. 43 near Harrisonville, Mo., southward along the Missouri Pacific Railroad to B. M. XCVII at Boston, Mo., was run between July 14 and October 11, 1893. The section, 70 k~ometres ( =43 miles) long, from B. M. LXV at Olathe, Kans., southeastward along the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railroad to Harrisonville, Mo., thence to Pleasant Hill, Mo., over the Missouri Pacific · Railroad, was run between June 17 and July 28, 1893. The section, 19 kilometres (=12 miles) long, from B. M. LXIII at Holliday, Kans., southward along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to B. M. LXVII at Olathe, Kans., was run between October 5 and October 18, r89r. The programme of observations on all of these sections was substantially that given on page 417. On the sections Little Rock to London, London to Fort Smith, and Holliday to Olathe the line was run independently in the forward and backward directions. On the remaining sections a simultaneous double line was run. These various sections, with an aggregate length of 795 kilometres (=494 miles), connect the line Arkansas City, Ark., to Little Rock; Ark. (see Appen-

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898-99·

dix No. 12 of the report for 1888 1 pp. 455-464), at Little Rock, with the transcontinental line of levels along the thirty-ninth parallel at Pleasant Hill, Mo., and Holliday, Kans. (See route sketch.) The direct results of the leveling are shown in the following tabulations. The corrections for length and temperature of rods and index error of rods, as well as for the measured angles between the target and the horizon, for the inequality of collars, for curvature, and for refraction, were applied in the Office computation whenever they were of sufficient magnitude to make it necessary to do so.

*Compare with the ekvations given for these bench marks on p. 369 of this Report.

The following elevations on the top of the railroad rail, or on top of the ballast of the railroad, in front of the railroad stations unless otherwise stated, were also determined during the course of the leveling, in addition to the elevations shown in the preceding tabulation. These elevations are upon the same basis as the elevations given in the tabulation, and are of course subject to the same corrections, due to adjustments to be made later, as are elevations given for the same locality in the tabulations.

COLORADO SPRINGS-DENVER, AND LIMON-DENVER LINES.

The lines of precise leveling connecting Colorado Springs and Denver, and Limon and Denver, were run by Isaac Winston, Assistant, between July 9 and November 10, I898, using levels No. 5 and No. 6 and rods P and Q. The leveling was commenced at bench mark Z, at Roswell, Colo., and proceeded northward along the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad to Denver, Colo., 119 kilometres (=74 miles), and thence southeastward over the Union Pacific to bench marks N, 0, and Pat Limon, 146 kilometres ( =91 miles). Bench marks Z, N, 0, and Pat Roswell and at Limon were established in 1898 on the transcontinental line of levels. The two lines here treated, together with the portion Limon to Colorado Springs of the line Hugo to Colorado Springs, of which the results are published in Appendix No. 3 of Coast and Geodetic Survey Report

1897-<)8 pages 215-228 form a closed circuit 387 kilometres (=240 miles) in circumference, of which the closing error is 29 centimetres. All of the lines on this circuit were run as simultaneous double lines, continuously in one direction, clock-wise around the circuit, and the programme of observing indicated on page 417 was used. The corrections for length and temperature of rods and for the index error of rods,

as well as for the measured angle between target and horizon, inequality of collars, curvature, and refraction, were applied in the office computation. The direct results of these lines are given in the following tabulation. Although the line between Limon and Denver was run in the direction Denver to Limon, it has for convenience been tabulated as if run from Limon toward Denver. The elevation of the top of rail was determined at seventeen points between Colorado Springs and Denver, and at eight points between Limon and Denver, as indicated in the tabulation thus: R. R. S.

LINE ACROSS FLORIDA.

The line across Florida, between St. Augustine and Cedar Keys, connecting with the Atlantic on the eastern end and with the Gulf on the western end, has been leveled three times-in 1892 1 1893, and in 1894. It is especially interesting in connection with a study of the errors of precise leveling. The same route was followed by all three of these lines, namely, from St. Augustine southwestward, along the railroad now known as the Florida East Coast, to Palatka; thence westward over the railroad line of the Plant System to Gainesville; thence southwestward over the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad to Cedar Keys, as indicated in the accompanying route sketch. The line was leveled independently in the forward and backward directions in 1892, between March 16 and June 30, the leveling in the eastward direction being done by Isaac Winston, Assistant, with level No. 5, and in the westward direction by F. A. Young, Subassistant, with level No. 6. Rods I, K, N, and 0 were used. In 1893 a double simultaneous line was run in the direction St. Augustine to Cedar Keys, between February 13 and May 25, by Isaac Winston, Assistant, using level No. 5 and rods N and 0. The programme of observation in both 1892 and 1893 was that indicated on page 417. The corrections for length and temptrature of rods, and for the index error of rods, as well as for the measured angle between target and horizon, inequality of collars, curvature and refraction, were applied in the office computation. The leveling in 1894 was done by Isaac Winston, Assistant, between March 13 and May 1, in the direction Cedar Keys to St. Augustine.* A radically different instrument
*This releveling of 1894 was ordered by Superintendent Mendenhall for the purpose of testing the method of leveling and the instrument which had been used by Assistant C. H. Van Orden between Boston and Greenbush, and which was afterwards used by him between Dobbs Ferry and Greenbush.

and programme of observation was used than in 1892 and 1893. The instrument was that used by Assistant C. H. Van Orden in running the lines, Boston to Greenbush, N. Y., and from Dobbs Ferry to Greenbush, N. Y. (see page 402). This instrument is shown in illustration No. 5. ''The rods are nonextensiou and of selected white pine supposed to have been heated to a high temperature and then plunged in boiling paraffin. They are a little over 10 feet in length, made of three pieces bolted together, the cross section being T-shaped. The middle piece, on the edge of which is the graduation, is 35 by 50 millimetres (I 3,,S by 2 inches); the side strips are each 25 by 25 millimetres (1 by 1 inch). The targets are square black plates with a vernier on one edge of a square aperture in the center of the face; each has three horizontal white stripes, the lower edge of the middle one (0·01 foot wide) being the zero of the target. The target is moved by an endless chain runNo. 4.

ning over pulleys in each end of rod. The rods are graduated to 0·01 foot (3 ·048 millimetres) and are read to 0·001 foot by the vernier on the target." '' The method of observing may be described as follows: The instrument was set up and leveled by the observer. The bubble of the level was then set by an attendant to the middle of its tube by means of the micrometer screw. The target of rod r was set near the horizon and the position of the observing line on the narrow white central hand of the target \yas estimated the instant notice was given by the bubble tender that the bubble was in central position. The small estimated quantity expressed in terms of 0·001 foot was added (always positive) as a correction to the rod reading as noted by the rodman and verified by the observer. The same operation was then gone through with rod 2. The sight lines were kept equal by counting the number of rails, each being 30 feet in length, or otherwise by measuring the distances.* The distance from

instrument to staff was generally 8 or 9 rail lengths, i. e., about 250 feet ( 76 metres nearly) on the average, while the distances of rods 1 and 2 for the same instrumental station was about 15 feet. The line of levels of 1894, then, is a double one, run simultaneously with two rods, and in the direction from west to east, following the route and using the same bench marks as in the years 1892 and 1893. The method differs principally from the earlier ones by its simplicity due to eliminating instrumeptal defects of adjustment, of inequality of collars, and effects of curvature and refraction, by keeping the back and fore sights of equal length.'' ., The lengths and index errors of these rods were determined at the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, and the office computation made accordingly: :. '!'he roadbed along which the line was run was of white sand over nearly the whole rout.e, and in places passed through extensiv'e marshes. It was difficult to find stable positions for the footplate and instrument. The direct results of these three lines of leveling are shown in condensed form in the following tabulation: Summary

The separate computation of each of these lines gives the following values for B. M. Y above B. M. A: Young line of 1892, westward, Y -A=+ 1 ·5 336 metres. Winston line of 1892, eastward, Y-A=+2·1880 metres.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

First line of 1893, with rod'N Y-A=+2·0812 metres. Second line of 1893, with rod 0, Y-A=+2·ro12 metres. First line of 1894, with rod l, Y-A=+2·4131 metres. Second line of 1894, with rod 2, Y-A=+2·3613 metres. It should be noted that the two components of the line of 1892 show a much larger divergence than the components for the other years, the three divergences being, for 1892, 654·4 millimetres; for 1893, 20·0 millimetres, and for 1894, 51·8 millimetres. An examination of the computation also shows that 618 millimetres of the divergence in 1892 occurred on the western half of the line between B. M. 0 at Hawthorn and B. M. Y at Cedar Keys, a distance of only 120 kilometres, the divergence being at the rate of 5 millimetres per kilometre. It is equally important, however, to note that this line of 1892 gives a result which is closer to the mean result from the three years than that from the 1894 line. The divergence of 618 millimetres between the two components of the 1892 line is of such a sign as to indicate that if it were due to movements of the footplates there was a systematic tendency for the footplates to rise between the foresight and the corresponding backsight. It is significant that the divergence of the line of 1893, run in the westward direction, from the line of 1894, run in the eastward direction, is 325 millimetres between these same bench marks, and is again of such a sign as to indicate a systematic rising of the footplates. A systematic rising of the instrument would also tend to account for the facts here noted. To determine mean sea level at each end of the line, tidal observations were secured by means of a self-registering tide gauge operated for one year. The following tabulations exhibit the results of these observations by separate lunations. The reading of mean sea level on the staff for each lunation is corrected for the known annual (Sa) and semiannual (Ssa) inequality in mean sea level. The discrepancies between the various lunations furnish, therefore, a measure of the accuracy with which mean sea level is determined.

Converting to metres, the reading of mean sea level on the Atlantic at St. Augustine on the staff is 1·7907±0·0091 metres, and of mean sea level on the Gulf at Cedar Keys on the staff 1·7212 ±0'0055 metres. The relation of the zero of the staff to the initial bench mark of the level line was determined at each of these points three times by direct leveling with the following results: At St. Augustine B. M. A above zero of staff 3·9382 metres, at Cedar Keys B. M. Y above zero of staff 5·7233 metres, making the elevation of B. M. A above mean sea level 2·1475 ± 0·0091 metres, and of B. M. Y at Cedar Keys above mean sea level on the Gulf 4 ·002.1 ± 0·0055 metres. Combining these values with the relation between A and Y, shown by leveling, the following values are obtained for the apparent difference of elevation of mean sea level on the Gulf aud on the Atlantic:

The mean from the three years indicates that the Gulf is 0·2585 metre higher than the Atlantic. As, however, the six results show a total range of 0·8795 metre, and even the means for the three years show a range of 0·5264 metre, it is not clear that the leveling is of a sufficiently high degree of accuracy to warrant the conclusion that the Gulf is appreciably higher than the Atlantic. The apparent difference may be due to errors of leveling. For a further discussion of the relation between Gulf level and Atlantic level see pages 429-431.

CONDENSED STATEMENT OF DIRECT RESULTS OF OBSERVATION.

On the following pages there is shown in condensed form for convenient reference the direct results of the leveling and the tidal observations which are treated in this appendix. For each long line of leveling there is stated in the following tal;mlar form the location and designation of the terminal bench marks, the distance between them measured along the level line, the observed difference of elevation, and a reference to the authority from which these facts are obtained. The sign affixed to the difference of elevation indicates the elevation of the first named above the other. As the desirable information in regard to tidal observations and in regard to the observations fixing the relations between bench marks which are common to two or more level lines at their junction points, can not conveniently be put in this tabular form, it is placed immediately after it in paragraphs which are numbered to correspond with the relation which they bear to the tabular matter. The numbers assigned in the tabulation and the following paragraphs serve also to indicate approximately the order in which the corrected elevations and descriptions of bench marks are given on pages 472-874. Another distinction may also be made between the paragraphic matter and the tabular matter. All elevations or relative elevations which are stated in the paragraphic matter are determined by the observations with so high a degree of accuracy, as compared with that concerned in the relative elevations stated in the tabular matter, that they in the adjustment are treated as fixed quantities, or, in other words, are assigned infinite weight.

No. !.-VICINITY OF NEW YORK CITY.
J.ll 1881 the transcontinental line of levels was commenced at Sandy Hook tide gauge and continued westward to Hagerstown, Md. (See Appendix r r, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1882, pp. 517-525.) The elevations of this line were based upon continuous tidal observations made with the self-registering tide gauge at Sandy Hook during the six years 1876-1881, inclusive. The annual means for these six years show a total range of 0·322 foot (98 millimetres). In 1886-87 a precise level line was run from Sandy Hook, N. J., to Dobbs Ferry, N. Y. (See Appendix No. 14. Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1887, pp. 275-

APPENDIX NO. 8.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

300.) The elevations along this line were based upon the same tidal observations at Sandy Hook as were used in connection with the transcontinental line. There is a substantial agreement of the elevations given by these two lines for the bench marks common to them both between Sandy Hook and B. M. VIII near South Amboy. Hence the best elevations available for these bench marks are simply the mean of the values given by the two lines. Between B. M. VIII and B. M. F, on Raritan Bay, a decided difference suddenly develops between the elevations given by the two level lines of 1881 and 1886-87. At B. M. VIII the 1886-87 line gives an elevation which is only 4 ·5 millimetres lower than that given by the 1881 line, whereas at B. M. Fit gives an elevation 32·3 millimetres lower, although these bench marks are less than one kilometre apart. The question at once arises, '' Which elevation for F is correct?'' On the transcontinental line no check on the elevations is available until Hagerstown, Md., is reached. At that point a connection is made with a line of precise levels from Washington, D. C. The check obtained in this way is, however, affected by the errors of leveling over the whole' 580 kilometres between Washington and Sandy Hook, and hence it is not capable of detecting an error so small as 32·3 millimetres. On the line to Dobbs Ferry there are, on the contrary, several good checks upon the elevations. It was connected with mean sea level at the time it was run, at twenty-two other points besides Sandy Hook. At three of these points-Governors Island, Willets Point, and Dobbs Ferry-the series of tidal observations covered nearly one month. At the remaining stations the observations were continued for a few days only. In every case hourly readings of the tide gauge were used, and simultaneous· observations were made at Sandy Hook. The computations were mad~ by the differential method, the simultaneous observations being used to refer the local mean sea level to the Sandy Hook mean sea level, and the results are therefore entitled to considerably more weight than would have been the case if the simultaneous observations had not been made at Sandy Hook. The mean of a selected seven of these stations indicates that the elevations given by the leveling of 1886-87 are subject to a correction of o· 176 foot= 53 '6 millimetres.* Three of these stations, viz, Port Monmouth, Conaskonk, and South Amboy, are between Sandy Hook and B. M. F, and thus indicate that this correction of 53 ·6 millimetres is applicable between Sandy Hook and B. M. F. But this is contradicted strongly by the close agreement of the 1886-87 leveling and the 1881 leveling between those points. The seven selected stations were chosen because they were more freely exposed to the ocean than the remaining stations. In view, however, of the depth and width of the entrance to New York Bay, and of the Hudson and East Rivers, it is improbable that there is any appreciable difference between the mean sea level even as far up as Dobbs Ferry and mean sea level in the Lower Bay, and in fact the tidal observations do not indicate any well marked difference between the seven selected stations and the remaining stations. Taking the mean, then, from the nineteen tidal stations, t at which connections were made with sea level north of B. M. F, the apparent correction required by the elevations given by the 1886-87 leveling is 0·147 foot = 44 ·3 millimetres. As a further check upon the elevations given by the 1886-87 line; long series of continuous observations made with self-registering tide gauges at Fort Hamil-

The following table shows the place at which each series of observations was made, the length and date of the series, and the correction to the elevations of 1886-87 line resulting from that series.

In deriving the values of mean sea level shown in the above table from readings of high and low water a correction was applied to the half-tide level, or mean between high water and low water, to reduce it to mean sea level, this correction being due to the component of the tide known as M4 and to the diurnal components. Additional observations made at Sandy Hook with a self-registering tide gauge between January l, 1882, and August 31, 1884, and between December l, i886, and March 31, 1888, gave values for mean sea level, which fell within the extreme limits given by the observations of l876-188r. If these three years of observations are used in addition to the six years previously used, the correction to the elevations of the 1881 level line is only -8"8 millimetres. This is about equal to the probable error of the determination of mean sea level and is too small a correction to be of importance. In view of the various checks upon the elevations stated in the above paragraphs, the best assignable values at present would seem to be obtained by using the mean of the two elevations given by the 1881 line and 1886-87 line between Sandy Hook and B. M. VIII at South Amboy, to use the elevation given by the 1881 line for B. M. F at Raritan Bay, and to apply to all other elevations along the Sandy Hook-Dobbs Ferry line the correction 32·3 millimetres necessary to make the elevation of B. M. F from the 1886-87 line agree with its elevation derived from the 1881 line. The elevation of B. M. Vat Dobbs Ferry is on this basis, 2·9357 metre·s. The outstanding discrepancies between elevations thus assigned and the various determinations of mean sea level will then be as follows:

No. 29.-BILOXI, MISS.

The connection with Gulf level at Biloxi, as used in fonner publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, is shown on pages 198-200 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for l 887. The best connection now available is that shown on pages 3486-3487, 3476-3478, of the Chief of Engineers Report for 1899, part 5. The value there derived for the reading of mean Gulf level on the tide staff is 6°0829 ± 0·0114 metres. This value is based upon five complete years of observations, viz, 1882, 1884, 1896, 1897, and 1898, the total range of the five annual means being 0·1003 feet= 30·6 millimetres. This series of tidal observations includes that formerly used by the Coas.t and Geodetic Survey. The internal evidence of the series indicates that the elevation of the gauge zero has been kept constant during the observations. All the available evidence indicates that the bench marks in the vicinity of the gauge have maintained their relative elevations within narrow limits during the long period over which the leveling and tidal observations in this vicinity extend, and that upon the whole this connection with the gulf level is worthy of a very high degree of confidence. (See Chief of Engineers Report 1896, part 6, pp. 3478-3484.) Using the value 6·0829 feet for the mean reading of gulf level upon the gauge as given above, the elevation of .B. M. H, ( =P. B. M. 19) above mean sea level is l l '939 -6·0829=+5·8561 feet=+1·7849 metres, and of B. M. E, is 21 ·803-6'0829= +15·7201 feet=+4·7915 metres. (See Chief of Engineers Report 1899, part 5, p. 3487.) B. M. H, was connected with B. M. F, (P. B. M. 21), G, (P. B. M. 20), and I, (P. B. M. 18) at Biloxi by the level line run under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission between Carrollton and Biloxi in 1882-83 (see Chief of Engineers Report 1884, part 4, pp. 2463-2486), and by the Coast and Geodetic Survey level line between . Mobile, Ala., and Carrollton, La., in 1885-86. (See Coast and Geodetic Survey Report 1887, pp. 185-205.) From these measurements the following values are obtained:

The values of W-V from these three lines were, respectively, +0·0567, +0·0568, and +0·0572 metre, and the mean =+0·0569 metre.
No. 35.-CAIRO, ILL.

The three bench marks P. B. M. l, P. B. M. 2, and P. B. M. 3 were connected by the line of levels by the United States engineers, of which the results are given in the Chief of Engineers' Report 1883, part 3, p. 2187; by the United States engineers' line between Grafton and Cairo, 1880-81 (see Chief of Engineers' Report 1884, part 4, p. 2498), and by the Coast and Geodetic Survey line between Greenfield, Tenn., and Villa Ridge, Ill., 1888-89 (see Coast and Geodetic Survey Report 1892, part 2, p. 181). P. B. M. 3 is not used in this local adjustment because it is reported that when visited in 1888 the building on which the bench mark was placed showed evidences of having settled. (See Coast and Geodetic Survey Report l 892, p. 200. ) The differences of elevation, P. B. M. 2-P. B. M. l, from the lines named above were, respectively, +0·3976, +0·4042, and +0·4076 m~tre. The mean of these three values, +0·4031 metre, was adopted.
No. 38.-CARROLLTON, LA.

There are several bench marks in the neighborhood of Carrollton and New Orleans, which are common to the United States engineers' line of 1882-83 and the Coast and Geodetic Survey line of 1885-86. No attempt has been made to make a local adjustment, but a junction of the two lines has been made upon B. M. I at Carrollton.
No. 41.- VIDALIA, LA.

The bench marks LXI and LXIV were connected by the Coast and Geodetic Survey level line between Red River Landing and Bielas Landing, La. , in 1 880-8 l (see Coast and Geodetic Survey Report 1888, p. 437), and by the line of the United States engineers from Monroe to Vidalia in 1893-94, of which the results are given in the Vicksburg tabulation. The extreme bench marks of this series on the Coast and Geodetic Survey line are LXI and LXIV; the difference, LXIV-LXI, by the 1881 line, is +0·9880 metre, and by the 1893-94 line, +0·9881 metre. The mean of these values, +0·9880 metre, was adopted.

The following tabulation shows how the results of these various lines of levels have been combined, and it is. believed that no other explanations are necessary to justify such a combination than those given by the table itself and its footnotes. It has been assumed ·in some of the discussions of the leveling iri this vicinity that the bench mark M. R. C . .lFchanged in elevation some time between 1889 and 1897, but when the lines of levels in both directions from this beµch mark are considered it does not seem to the writer that this assumption is warranted.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<J9. No. 45.-WILKERSONS LANDING AND ARKANSAS CITY.

Bench mark Fat Arkansas City was connected with bench mark 84 at Wilkersons Landing by the Coast and Geodetic Survey level line between Wilkersons Landing, Miss., and Little Rock, Ark., 1887-88, and by the United States Engineer line between Parkeville and Greenville in 1897. The difference of elevation, F-84, according to the determination of 1887-88, is - 0·0584 metre, and according to the 1897 determination - 0·0543 metre. The mean, - 0·0564 metre, was adopted. The bench marks F and 84 are on opposite sides of the Mississippi River.
No. 47.-LITTLE ROCK, ARK.

Bench marks 0, A, B, and I (or 3) were connected by the Coast and Geodetic Survey line from Wilkersons Landing to Little Rock in 1887-88, and by the line Monroe, La., to Little Rock, Ark., by the United States Engineers in 1895 and 1897. A careful investigation of the relative elevations of these four bench marks, as determined by the two level lines, indicated that I (or 3) showed an apparent change of elevation which was very nearly the mean of the apparent changes for all four bench marks. I (or 3) was therefore assumed to be stable during the interval in question, and was used as the junction bench mark.
No. 49.-VAN BUREN, ARK.

The difference of elevation of B. M. XXXIX-XXXVIII as determined in i 893 on the Coast and Geodetic Survey line Van Buren to Chester was - 0·0077 metre, and as determined on the line Little Rock to Fort Smith in r889 was - 0·0068 metre. The mean, - 0·0072 metre, was adopted.
No. 52.-CHESTER, ARK.

The difference oi elevation, B. M. XLIX-B. M. XLVIII, as determined in 1893 on the Coast and Geodetic Survey line Van Buren to Chester was - 1·1362 metres, and as determined in 1894 on the line Chester to Boston - 1·1355 metres. The mean, - 1 · 1358 metres, was adopted.
No. 54.-BOSTON, MO.

The difference of elevation, B. M. XCVI-B. M. XCVII, as determined in 1893 on the Coast and Geodetic Survey line Harrisonville to Boston, was - 0·0010 metre, and as determined in 1894 on the line Boston to Chester - 0·0007 metre. The mean, - 0·0008 metre, was adopted.

The elevations 27 ·7000 metres for the Capitol bench mark and 2 ·9360 metres for B. M. Cat navy-yard, as given on page 257 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1896, were adopted. These elevations depend upon tidal observations at the Washington Navy Yard extending over five years, and upon the assumption that the total fall of the Potomac from the Navy Yard to the open sea is 88·0 millimetres. (See page 256 of Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for r896.)

No. 67.-ANNAPOLIS, MD.

The connection with mean sea level on the Chesapeake Bay at Annapolis was made by two short series of tidal observations with staff gauges November 24 to December 18, 1875, and August 16 to September 18, 1888. These two series gave for the elevation of Perkins tidal bench mark (a) above mean sea level 4·13 feet and 4·19 feet, respectively, and the mean 4·16 feet= l ·268 metres was adopted. (See Coast and Geodetic Survey Report, 1889, pp. 462-463.)

B. M. 74-B. M. Parkeville, + l ·2215m and+ 1 ·2224m, respectively. The mean+ l ·2220 metres was adopted.
No. 95.-AUSTIN, MISS.

On the line Friars Point, Miss., to Memphis, Tenn., No. 96 in above list, the leveling was done in two sections, Friars Point to Austin and Austin to Memphis, with an interval of a year between the two sections. On commencing work at Austin at the beginning of the second season it was found that the two bench marks I and II had apparently changed their difference of elevation by 4 ·4 millimetres since the end of the preceding season. It was assumed that their mean elevation had remained unchanged in deriving the difference of elevation between Friars Point and Memphis shown in No. 96 above. (Seep. 1942, Chief of Engineers Report, part 3, 1879.)
No. 107.-GRAFTON, ILL.

The bench marks P. B. M. l, P. B. M. 2, and P. B. M. 3 at Grafton are common to the United States Engineer lines, Cairo to Grafton and Keokuk to Grafton. P. B. M. 3 was believed by those who were familiar with the lqeal conditions to be more stable than the other two bench marks, and the junction was therefore made upon this bench mark and no local adjustment was made. (See Chief of Enginee~s Report, 1884, part 4, p. 2512).

P. B. M. l, P. B. M. 2, and P. B. M. 3 at Keokuk are common to the two United States Engineer lines, Keokuk to Grafton and Keokuk to Fulton. The relative elevations of these three bench marks, as shown by the two lines, agree so closely that there is little need for a local adjustment. P. B. M. l is taken as the junction bench mark in this report, as it is in the published Report of the Chief of Engineers, 1884, part 4, pages 2499-25 13. A local adjustment will change the elevations in this vicinity by not more than half a millimetre.

P. B. M. 68, P. B. M. 69, and P. B. M. 71, at St. Paul, are common to the two United States Engineer lines, St. Paul to Savanna and Duluth to St. Paul. P. B. M. 68 was adopted as the junction bench mark. This was also adopted in the published report of Chief of Engineers, 1892, part 4, pages 2958, 3098. The relative elevations of the three bench marks, as shown by the two lines, were such that a 19Cal adjustment would make very little change in the adopted values.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

No. 1 to No. 4 differ from Nos. 5 and 6 in dimensions and details of design, but not in the general features of the design. The distinctive characteristic of the design of these instruments is that the wyes in which the telescope rests are controlled by a micrometer screw in such a way that the inclination of the telescope may be quickly changed at will, by an amount which is measured with a high degree of accuracy by the readings of the micrometer head. This micrometer screw, with its accurately graduated head, is used to measure the small angle between that position of the telescope in which the distant target, placed approximately in.the horizon of the telescope, appears to be bisected, and that position of the telescope which causes the bubble of the striding level to stand in the middle. A very high grade of workmanship was used in the construction of these instruments. Devices shown just below the telescope in the illustration were provided for relieving the micrometer screw from strain and for lifting the telescope from its wyes while the instrument was being carried from station to station.* The principal constants and dimensions of levels No. 5 and No. 2 are as follows:

The rods P and Q used during the years 1895-1898 are described in detail and illustrated in Appendix No. 8 of the Report for 1895, pages 381-382. They are made of well-seasoned white pine thoroughly saturated with paraffin for the purpose of making their lengths independent of the hygrometric state of the atmosphere. Each rod is a little more than 3 metres long and its cross section is a cross of symmetrical proportions. The graduation is carried on a series of silver-faced brass plugs 5 millimetres in diameter inserted in the face of the rod at intervals of 2 centimetres. A millimetre scale attached to the target furnishes a means of reading to tenths of millimetres (estimated) against fine lines drawn upon these plugs. The target may be moved at will by means of an endless chain passing over a pulley at the top of the rod and extending down the back of the rod, and may also be damped in position quickly at any point by the use of a second endless chain attached to the clamp arm. The front of the rod also carries a painted graduation, which may be read directly from the telescope, and is used for making rough check readings to detect errors in the readings of the target and to make the necessary stadia readings for distance. The thermometer used to determine the temperature is sunk deep into the rod itself at the back and is covered by a wooden lid. The bottom of the rod is made of metal and terminates in a round bronze boss with a radius of 2·7 centimetres. The foot plate is a circular disk of cast iron about 15 centimetres in diameter, with a depression having a radius of 3 ·5 centimetres in the center for receiving the foot of the rod.
*For a more detailed descriptio11 of these instruments see Appendix No. 15 of the report for
1879, pp. 202-2ll.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)<).

One of the earlier sets of rods is described and illustrated in Appendix No. 15 of the Report for l 879, page 203. All of the rods distinguished by the letters A, B, etc., to 0 were of the same type as these and differed only in details of construction. The general dimensions and shape of these rods were the same as for P and Q described above. The material was white pine, but not treated with paraffin. The same foot plates were used. The foot of the rod was similar to that on P and Q, with the exception that whereas the point of support is brought forward in P and Q so as to be in the plane of graduation on the rod it was on the older rods in the axis of the rod prolonged. They were all target rods with a supplementary painted graduation for the purpose of making check readings and stadia readings. The graduation on rods A to 0 was carried on a strip of brass set into the face of the rod. On the earlier rods this brass strip was fastened in the middle only and expanded in both directions from the middle. On later rods it was fastened at the bottom. As this brass strip, which was the measuring scP.le upon which all observed differences of elevation depended, had a comparatively high coefficient of expansion, about .000018 per degree centigrade, in marked contrast to the expansion of .000004 of rods P and Q, it is important to note briefly the mode of attachment and exposure of the thermometers used to determine the temperature of the strip. In the earliest rods both the strip and the thermometer bulb were unprotected from the direct rays of the sun. On successive rods of later dates these conditions were gradually improved. On the latest of the rods now under consideration the brass strip was protected from direct sunlight by a strip of felt and the thermometer was sunk deeper into the rod and protected by a metallic cover. Even with these improvements the later rods must be conceded to be very decidedly inferior to rods P and Q. All of the leveling during the years 1895-1898 was done by the double simultaneous method. In leveling by this method the difference in elevation between two bench marks is determined by observing from the same station and with the same instrument back sights on two different rods set up at unequal distances from the instrument and fore sights on the same two rods carried forward and placed at the same relative distances as before. Previous to 1895 a part of the leveling was done by the double simultaneous method and a part by the forward and backward method, which consisted in leveling between certain bench marks in the direction called the forward direction and later releveling between the same bench marks in the reverse or backward direction.* On some of the double simultaneous leveling done previous to 1895 alternate portions of the line several kilometers long were run in contrary directions for the purpose of eliminating errors, at least in part. The programme of observation at each station in 1895-1898 was that shown below, in which the order of time is indicated by the order on the page. By a reading of the micrometer on the level is meant a reading of the micrometer corresponding to that position of the telescope in which the bubble is in the middle.

The same operations are repeated in the same order on the fore sight. Besides the record corresponding to the above programme, the rod readings, one 011 each rod for each back sight and for each fore sight, are also placed in the record at times not interfering with the above programme. The total number of original entries in the record book per station, exclusive of temperature readings, is 48. The upper and lower edges of the target were read by the observer for the purpose of checking the target readings. A single line, subtending with the center line of the diaphragm an angle of about 19', was read for the purpose of giving a stadia measurement of the distance of the rod, this distance being necessary to enable the computation to be made. If a single line is being run, the programme at a station is of course one-half the length of that shown above. Such a programme of observation gives from each set of readings on a .rod a measure of difference in elevation of the rod and the instrument which is independent of the error of the striding level and the error of collimation of the telescope. Equality in length of fore sights and the corresponding back sights is depended upon to eliminate the effects of refraction, curvature, and inequality of collars only, and even for these purposes entire dependence is not placed upon equality of sights, as the distance measures furnish a means of applying the small corrections corresponding to the small differences of length.

Lines No. 1 to No. 66, of the list on pages 398-402, were run with the instruments and methods described above, with the exception of the 1894 line across Florida. Line No. 68, Annapolis.to Washington, was run independently in the forward and backward directions, using a method which is substantially identical with that used by the United States Engineers on lines 73 to 124.
INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, 1899.

Lines numbered 69, 70, 72 were run in 1899, using direct-reading rods and levels No. 5, No. 6, and No. 1, modified as indicated in illustrations Nos. 7 and 8, and in the text below. The method of observation was also radically changed from that formerly in use. Each of these three levels was provided with a device for reading the bubble from the ·eye end of the telescope without moving the eye away from ~he eyepiece. The device is shown in illustration No. 7. In its essential principles it is the reading device which has been used on the Berthelemy precise levels which have been used extensively in the leveling in France. In its design, however, it differs radically from that device, as may be seen by comparing illustration No. 7 with No. 12. The light from each end of the bubble passes to the mirror shown above the level vial, thence to two 45degree prisms at the same elevation as the telescope and to the left, and from them passes through an auxiliary eyepiece to the left eye of the observer. The bubble is seen clearly and slightly magnified, is brightly lighted, and is read without parallax. The two prisms may be so arranged that only the ends of the bubble and a small portion of the graduation are seen in the auxiliary eyepiece. The two bubble ends are apparently so close together that very little movement of the eye is necessary in looking from one to the other. The prisms may be quickly adjusted to accommodate them to varying lengths of the bubble, the auxiliary eyepiece may be focused to fit the eye of the observer, and the distance between the eyepiece of the telescope and the auxiliary eyepiece of the reading device may be adjusted to correspond with the binocular distance of the observer. The mirror projects but little above the striding level. This is a decided advantage in observing on a windy day. No distracting images of surrounding objects are seen in the mirror when reading the bubble. The device is very effective in enabling the observer to make practically simultaneous readings of the rod and the bubble, as he sees both clearly at the same time and needs but to change the attention from one to the other. The striding levels of these three instruments were remodeled in such a way that the distance between the level vial and the line of collimation of the telescope has been greatly reduced. The level vial was also protected more thoroughly than before against sudden changes of temperature. The principal metallic parts of the striding level and the telescope barrel, including the collars which rest upon the wyes, have been constructed of a nickel-iron alloy having a coefficient of expansion of ·000004, about the same as that of pine. These parts were formerly made of a yellow composition metal having a coefficient of expansion four and a half times as large as this, namely, about ·000018 per degree centigrade. The rods used in 1899 are shown in illustration No. 9. They are like the rods P and Qin general shape and dimensions, in material, and in many other respects. The

footplate, the foot of the rod, the placing of the thermometer and of the watch level are the same as in rods P and Q. Tqey differ essentially from rods P and Q as used in r895-r898 in being direct reading rods instead of target rods. The graduation, which is read directly from the telescope, is in black and white squares r centimetre on a side. Metal plugs are inserted at the o· r, I" r, 2 · r, and 3 · r metre points. A fine graduation on these plugs is used to determine the exact length of the rods and to study their changes of length while in the field. The new rods contain less than 20 per cent of their original weight of paraffin as contrasted with 72 to 95 per cent in rods P and Q. This, together with the omission of the target and connected chains, reduces the weight of the rod from about 10 kilograms to about 4·5 kilograms. These rods with the -smaller amount of paraffin are found to be sensibly as constant in length under varying hygrometric conditions as rods P and Q. The following general instructions for precise leveling, issued at the beginning of the field season of 1899, indicate concisely the programme and method of observation: " r. Except when specific instructions are given to proceed othervdse, all lines are to be leveled independently in both the forward and the backward direction. "2. It is desirable that the backward measurement on each section should be made under different atmospheric conditions from those which occurred on the forward measurement. It is especially desirable to make the backward measurement in the afternoon if the forward measurement was made in the forenoon, and vice versa. The observer is to secure as much difference of conditions between the forward and backward measurements as is possible without materially delaying the work for that purpose. "3. On all sections upon which the forward and backward measures differ by more than 4mm·o .../K (in which K is the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks, in kilometres), both the forward and backward measures are to be repeated until two such measures fall within the limit. '' 4. The programme of observation at each station is to be as follows: ''Set up and level the instrument. Read the three lines of the diaphragm as ~een projected against the front (or rear) rod, each being taken to the nearest millimetre (estimated), and the bubble being held continuously in the middle of the tube (i.e., both ends reading the same). As soon as possible thereafter read the three lines of the diaphragm as seen projected against the rear (or front) rod, estimating to millimetres as before, and holding the bubble continuously in the middle of the tube. During all observations the telescope is to be erect, and the striding level with a particular leg toward the objective-that is, there are to be no reversals of telescope or striding level. "5. At each rod station the rod thermometer is to be read and the temperature recorded. '' 6. At stations of odd numbers the backsight is to be taken before the foresight, and at the even stations the foresight is to be taken before the backsight. "7. The maximum difference in length between a foresight and the corresponding backsight is to be IO metres. The actual difference is to be made as small on each pair of sights as is feasible by the use of good judgment without any expenditure of time for this particular purpose. "8. The recorder shall keep a record of the rod intervals subtended by the extreme lines of the diaphragm on each backsight, together with their continuous sum between bench marks. A similar record shall be kept for the foresights. The two continuous sums shall be kept as nearly equal as is feasible without the expenditure of extra time

420

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT,

for that purpose by setting the instrument beyond (or short of) the middle point between the back and front rods. The two continuous sums shall not be allowed to differ by more than a quantity corresponding to a distance of 20 metres. '' 9. The inequality of collars shall be determined at the beginning and end of each season of work. ''The collimation error shall be determined once for each day of work by a set of three readings in the direct position and two in the reverse position of the telescope. ''The error of adjustment of the striding level shall be determined at least twice on each day of work by a set of three readings in the ordinary position and two in the reverse position. '' 10. Notes for future use in studying leveling errors shall be inserted in the record indicating the time of beginning and ending of the work of each half day, indicating the weather conditions especially as to cloudiness and wind, indicating whether each portion of the line is run toward or away from the sun, and such other notes as promise to be of value in studying errors. '' l l. The instrument shall be shaded from the direct rays of the sun both during the observations and the movement from station to station. "12. The maximum length of sight shall be 150 metres, and the maximum is to be attained only under the most favorable circumstances.'' This method is much simpler and more rapid than the old method. There are only seven entries per station on a single line, inclusive of the thermometer reading, whereas in the old method there were twenty-five entries per station under the same conditions. The computation is correspondingly simple and expeditious. The difference of elevation of the rod and the instrument as determined by this method is affected by the error of the striding level and the error of collimation of the telescope. The approximate equality in length between each foresight and the corresponding backsight is relied upon mainly to eliminate these errors as well as those resulting from curvature, refraction, and inequality of collars. The observed values, however, of the collimation error and level error, together with the distance measures furnished by the rod readings, make it possible to apply the proper correction when the obsen"er fails to make foresights and backsights so nearly equal as to render such corrections unnecessary. The micrometer screw under the eye end of the telescope is used simply as a quick leveling device and is not directly concerned in the measures.
INSTRUJIIENTS AND METHODS, UNITt.'D STATES ENGINEERS.

Lines numbered 72 to l 16, l 18, 120-124, 126, and 127, were run under the direction of the United States Engineers with levels made by Kern, of Switzerland. One of these Kern levels, which has been used extensively in the Vicksburg district, is shown in illustration No. ro. The principal statistics in regard to such a level are approximately as follows. They differ, of course, with different instruments:

THE KERN LEVEL.

APPENDIX NO. 8.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

421

The head of the micrometer screw under the eye end of the telescope carries no graduation, as the screw is used simply as a quick leveling device. The reading of the bubble is made with an inclined mirror. This reading device is open to the objection that the bubble is read with some parallax. The effect of this parallax upon the compute.cl elevation is, however, sensibly eliminated, as it is nearly constant. The rods used by the engineers have been uniformly of the direct-reading type, carrying a graduation in centimetres painted on the front face of the rod. The cross section of the rod has usually been T-shaped. There have been various changes from time to time in the details of construction of the rod, and especially in the foot piece and in the footplates or pins used to support the rods. On lines run recently the method of observation has been substantially that described above as having been used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in I 899. This method has, however, been the result of a gradual development, and on the older lines especially minor departures and in a few cases important departures from the method will be found. In rare cases the line was run twice independently in the same direction instead of in the forward and backward directions, as, for example, between Escanaba and Marquette, Mich. The earlier line between Lakeport and Gibraltar, Mich., was leveled with the Kern, instruments but once, in 1877, two parties starting at the ends and working toward each other until they met at the middle. The precaution of making each foresight nearly equal to the corresponding backsight, in addition to making the sum of the foresights and backsights equal on each stretch, has not been always attended to as carefully as in the Coast and Geodetic Survey lines of 1899. The precaution of.making alternate foresights before the corresponding backsights has been taken on but a small portion of the work. Upon the whole the method used by the engineers has been the direct-reading differential method used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899, and is in marked contrast with the target-reading absolute method formerly used by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.
OTHER INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS.

The instrument and method employed in leveling across Florida in 1894, line No. 64, has already been described (see page 394 and illustration No. 5). The same instrument and method was used on lines No. 135 and No. 136. Lines numbered 138, 140, 141, and 142 were run by the United States Geological Survey with this same type of instrument. Two sets of level vials were used, having values for each division, one-tenth of an inch in length, of four seconds and eight seconds respectively. The rods used were nonextensible target rods, about 10 feet in length, with a T-shaped cross section, made of pine, treated with paraffin. The target readings were taken to thousandths of a foot. The leveling was done by the double simultaneous method continuously in one direction. The micrometre screw was used simply as a quick leveling device, the target being placed in the horizon of the instrument. For a full description of the methods, instruments, and rods used by the United States Geological Survey, see Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Volume XXXIX, June, 1898, pages 357-366. The observer on lines No. 138 and No. 14.2 was Mr. E. L. McNair, and on line No. 140, Mr. C. H. Semper.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.

Line No. 128, and the portion Cape Vincent to Hogansburg, N. Y., of line No. 133, was run partly with Kern levels and partly with the level shown in illustration No. II, which was designed by T. C. Mendenhall, president of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and manufactured by Buff & Berger. The weight of this instrument alone is 5 ·3 kilogrammes ( = II ·7 pounds); the weight of the tripod is 7'3 kilogrammes (= 16·1 pounds). The details of the method of observation used with the Mendenhall level are not known to the writer, but it is believed that they correspond more nearly to the method used by the Engineers with Kern levels than to any other method described in this appendix. The observations on line No. 128, between Gibraltar and Fort Gratiot, were made by 0. W. Ferguson and D. A. Molitor, and the line from Cape Vincent to Hogansburg by D. A. Molitor. Lines Nos. 132 and 134 were run under the direction of the Deep Waterways Commission, by various observers, with Buff & Berger wye levels; using the forward and backward method. Line No. 133 consists of several different links as follows: From Oswego to Cape Vincent the elevation was transferred by water leveling consisting of simultaneous readings of the two gauges on eleven days, July 27 to August 6, 1898; from Cape Vincent to Hogansburg the elevation was carried by precise leveling already referred to above; from Hogansburg to Coopersville by wye leveling; from Coopersville to Crown Point by water levels along Lake Champlain; and from Crown Point to Troybywye levels. The wye leveling was all done under the direction of the Deep Watenvays Commission with the Buff & Berger instruments and various observers and with methods similar to that used on lines 132 and 134. The water leveling through Lake Champlain was done ''in January, 1899, at a time when the entire lake was frozen over from \Vhitehall to Rouses Point, except about ten miles of the broad lake near BurEngton, Vt.'' ''Gauges at Coopersville and Crown Point were read at ten-minute intervals from 8·40 p. m., January 13, 1899, to 8 p. m. on January 15, a continuous set of readings covering a period of nearly forty-eight hours.'' Aneroid barometer readings were taken at each gauge and served to show that the mean barometric pressure was very nearly the same at the two gauges during the period of observation. Line No. 131 from Greenbush to Oswego was run twice independently in the westward direction by different parties in 1875 with wye levels.* Line No. 143, from Harrisburg, Pa., to Braddock, was run under the direction of the Chief Engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Little is known to the writer of the details of the method of observation on this line. Various checks which have been obtained on the leveling done by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company indicate it to be of a high degree of accuracy. Line No. 139, Dunkirk, N. Y., to Erie, Pa., consists of water leveling and depends upon continuous readings of the gauge at Dunkirk for about two years, supplemented by readings for a few weeks or months in each of six other years during intervals when harbor improvements were being made. The leveling along lines numbered II7, 119, 125, 129 is thus described in Professional Papers No. 24, page 595: '; Depending on the assumption that the mean surface of each lake is level, the relative heights of the pairs of bench marks for the respective lakes were determined.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

For this purpose water gauges were fixed near these bench marks and tridaily observations of the height of the water surface at each gauge were made during the months of May, June, July, and August, 1875, this series of observations qeing taken as of sufficient extent to give a reliable mean. Assuming then that the mean surface of each lake for this period of' about four months was level, the differences of the gaugt! readings gave the relative heights of the zero points of the two gauges on each lake, and as these zero points were carefully referred to the corresponding bench marks the relative heights of these bench marks are also known.'' The effect of winds upon these observations was also carefully investigated (see pages 604.:...6o8 of that report), as well as the effect of .the mean discharge through the Straits of Mackinac from Lake Michigan into Lake Huron. It is the opinion of the Deep Waterways Commission that the water levels through Lake Erie are subject to a correction of o· 18 foot ( = 6 centimetres) between the two ends of the lake.* As the revision by the Engineers of all the water levels through the Great Lakes which is now in progress might, and will doubtless, furnish other small corrections to the water levels in addition to this one, it was not deemed advisable to depart at present from the old values. Line No. 1 30, from Oswego, N. Y., to Erie, Pa., is made up of three links, namely, water levels similar to those referred to in the preceding paragraphs, between Oswego and Port Dalhousie, on Lake Ontario; and between Port Colborne and Erie, Pa., on Lake Erie; and wye levels between Port Dalhousie and Port Colborne run twice in the southward direction by different parties in 187 5. t The Berthelemy instrument used for precise·leveling in France is shown in illustration No. 12. Its most noticeable feature is the device for reading the bubble through an auxiliary eyepiece seen in the illustration just beyond the eyepiece of the telescope. The light from the ends of the bubble passes upward to the two prisms shown just above the level vial, is reflected from them horizont~lly to a prism in the upper end of the inclined metallic case seen above the eye end of the telescope, thence passes along this case to its lower end, where it is again turned through a right angle by another prism and finally reaches the auxiliary eyepiece. The principal statistics in regard to this instrument are:
3<m·6 Aperture of telescope .................................................. . Focal length of telescope .............................................. . 36=·0 Magnifying power of telescope ........................................ . 25 Value of one division (3mm) of striding level. ........................... . 1211 Angle subtended by stadia lines .................. ·..................... . 171 or 34' Weight of instrument alone ........................................... . 5k 11 ·4=n 1bs·9 Weight of tripod ..................................................... . 6ki·3=13lbo·9

The method of leveling used in France is in many respects similar to that used by the United States Engineers with the Kern levels and by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899. Each portion of the line is run in the forward and backward direction independently, foresights and corresponding backsights are made nearly equal, direct-reading rods are used, and the micrometer screw under the eye end of the telescope is used

merely as a quick leveling device. Two observers are used, and each takes all the readings. One observer reads the backsight first at a station and then the foresight, and the second observer immediately repeats the readings, taking the foresight reading first. This reversal of the order of reading by the second observer accomplishes the same purpose as the reading of the foresights before the backsights at alternate stations in the Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling of r899. The rods are direct-reading, are graduated to centimetres and also carry a graduation in 2-millimetre spaces; three lines are read against the rod.*
ADJUST111ENT OF LEVEL NET.

The relative positions of the various lines forming the level net to be adjusted are shown on the sketch map here inserted. The lines have been drawn nearly in their true location, but the drawing has necessarily been somewhat generalized, and in a few cases it has been necessary to exaggerate distances between points in order to make them show as separate points. Inside each circuit formed by several level lines there is printed the closing error in millimetres and the total. circumference of the circuit in kilometres. A plus sign on the closing error indicates that the elevation as carried around the circuit in a counterclockwise direction is too great. On all circuits on which the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, or Chesapeake Bay form one side it is assumed that the mean sea surface is everywhere at the same level on the Atlantic, Gulf, and the Chesapeake. It is evident that in these closing errors there is information of the highest value as to the actual errors of the leveling. The concrete problem in hand is to adjust this net by distributing the closing errors in such a way as to obtain as close an approximation as possible to the truth. Lines numbered r6, 18, 20, 22, 23,'50, 69, 70, 83, 84., 87, 94, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 115, 122, 124 are not concerned in any circuit closure, and therefore have no effect upon the adjustment. Lines numbered 25, 26, and 28 form a circuit-Limon-DenverColorado Springs-which stands by itself, being connected to the net by a single line only. The line numbered 127, between Fort Gratiot and Gibraltar, Mich., has been superseded by a much more accurate line between the same points-No. q8-and is not used in the adjustment. Line No. l 3 r has also been superseded by later lines, presumably of considerably greater accuracy, namely, Nos. 132, 133, and 134, and therefore is not used in the adjustment. These two lines were omitted in deriving the circuit closures shown on the sketch map. Certain questions are at once encountered when an attempt is made to adjust the level net. The various lines concerned in the circuit closures have been run with various instruments and radically different methods. What is the relative degree of accuracy attained by the different instruments and methods, and what relative weights must in consequence be assigned to the various lines? Is it possible to discover the law governing any of the errors involved in the circuit closures, and to eliminate such errors by applying the proper corrections? Do nearly all the errors of leveling belong to the

accidental class, or are there systematic errors predominating over the accidental errors?
If the accidental errors predominate largely, then the total error accumulated on any

one line may be expected to increase upon au average as the square root of the distance run, and the relative weight to be assigned to two or more such lines will be inversely proportional to the distance. If, on the other hand, a systematic error predominates largely over the accidental errors, the total error accumulated on any line may be expected to increase in proportion to the distance run, and the relative weights to be assigned to two or more such lines will then be inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The internal evidence from any one set or group of observations of any kind may furnish an estimate of the upper limit of accuracy of those observations, but it can not until supported by external evidence furnish a reliable estimate of the lower limit. In other words, one may often state with considerable confidence that the mean result from a given group of observations is subject to at least a certain probable error, because the observations show discrepancies of a certain magnitude, but one can not be reasonably certain that the probable error is not much greater than this, because of errors which are constant or nearly so for the whole group of observations, until all the available external evidence has been carefully examined. It is a safe and reasonable practice to assume at the outset in dealing with any class of observations that the probable errors, computed from the internal evidence of separate groups of observations, are to be regarded as lower limits, and that to obtain a reliable estimate the evidence which is external to the separate groups must be carefully considered. · Proceeding upon this basis one should expect that the probable error of the difference of elevation between the terminal bench mark of a line of leveling, as computed from the discrepancies between the two or more measures of each short section of that line between adjacent bench marks, would be too small in general to represent the facts. When a number of such lines are joined to form a net, one should not be surprised if the circuit closures which are developed indicate larger probable errors, but instead should accept this more reliable external evidence of the actual accuracy of the leveling in preference to the unsupported internal evidence furnished by the separate lines. The general European experience has been that the probable errors computed from circuit closures are much larger than those computed from qiscrepancies on short sections of the separate lines. The following tables serve to show the magnitude of the accidental errors in precise leveling in the United States as computed from discrepancies on short sections, usually about I kilometre, between adjac~nt temporary or permanent bench marks. The tables show every line for which the infonnation in question was conveniently accessible.

It should be noted that the two components of a double simultaneous line are much less independent than the two components of a forward and backward line. If the two classes of lines are of equal accuracy, the double simultaneous lines should therefore show a smaller computed probable error. As the four mean values from the above tables do not differ greatly, and as the individual values in the separate tables lap over, there is not sufficient evidence here to warrant-the separation of the leveling into different classes to which different weights are to be assigned. ' If the errors ~f leveling were all accidental, the probable error of closure of any circuit should be the square root of the circumference of the circuit in kilometres times the probable error of leveling for a single kilometre. The circumference and closing error of each of the circuits shown on illustration No. 13 are given in the following table, together with the probable error of the closure of the circuit computed by using as the probable error of the complete leveling of a single kilometre ± 0·86 millimetre, the mean of the four tabular means. If accidental errors predominate largely over systematic, the closing error should be less than the probable error set opposite for about one-half of the circuits. But, as a matter of fact, out of 26 circuits only 2, No. 20 and No. 21, fall within this limit. This indicates, then, that in a considerable number of the lines there must be systematic errors predominating largely over the accidental.

In arranging the order of the circuits in the above table those made up entirely of Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899 were placed first, namely, Nos. I to 6; then follow circuits composed partly of such leveling, placed approximately in the decreasing order of the percentage of Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling; and finally, Nos. 22 to 26, containing no Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling. Of the first ten circuits no actual closure is less than ten times the computed probable error of closure, whereas among the remaining sixteen only two closures exceed this limit. Among the sixteen there are six of which the closures are less than twice the corresponding com-

puted probable errors. Upon the whole there is a decided tendency for the closures to decrease in the order of the table. The table indicates very strongly that the Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899 is subject to predominating systematic errors, and that the errors of leveling by the Engineers belong mainly to the accidental class. The other level lines involved in the net will, for the present, be assumed to belong in an intermediate class, and the evidence in regard to them will be examined more carefully later. In order to study further the errors of the two main classes of leveling it is now proposed to adjust and study separately two level nets, one composed almost wholly of Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899, and the other almost wholly of leveling by the Engineers, with Kern instruments. It is not possible to get an extensive complete net composed entirely of either kind of leveling, and it is therefore· necessary in each case to use a few supplementary lines of some other class, forming however so small a portion of the whole as to have little effect on any general conclusion drawn from the net.
RELATIVE ELEVATION OF THE GULF AND THE ATLANTIC.

Before either of these nets is adjusted it is necessary to make a definite decision as to whether it shall be assumed that the mean sea surface on the Gulf and on the Atlantic are at sensibly the same elevation. Both these preliminary level nets are connected with sea level at Biloxi on the Gulf, as well as with Atlantic sea level. Two lines of investigation are possible in the endeavor to obtain the relative elevations of the Gulf and the Atlantic. One may inquire how great a difference of elevation is necessary to account for the observed velocities of the Gulf Stream; or one may inquire as to the results of the direct leveling between the Atlantic and the Gulf. The first is a theoretical method, as it depends very intimately on the theory of the relation between the velocities in the stream of water and the slope of the surface, the depth, the width, and other modifying conditions. The second is a direct obsen·ational method. Because there is a continuous current, the Gulf Stream, flowing out of the Gulf between Florida and Cuba, it would seem that it must be a physical fact that the Gulf is higher than the Atlantic. How great a difference of elevation is needed to account for this current? A similar question is treated in Professional Papers No. 24 of the Corps of Engineers, page 608, the problem there being to estimate the slope in the Straits of Mackinac. Let Hagen's formula as there stated, namely, V = 6R~ Ii, be applied to the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida. The unit of length in the formula is the foot. Let it be assumed that the average depth in the straits is 100 fathoms and the average current 3 knots, these assumptions being such as to make the computed slope too great rather than too small. The actual depth in the straits varies from 200 to I ooo fathoms, and the average current certainly does not exceed 3 knots. Upon this basis the slope of the surface, according to the formula, is about 1 foot in 5 ooo miles, or a fall of about one-tenth of a foot, or 30 millimetres, in the 500 miles of the straits between its western entrance and the north end of the Bahama Banks. Other formulre for the slope give results varying widely from this, some of them indicating a very much greater slope, perhaps ten times as great. All of the available formulre are based on observations upon streams which are much shallower and smaller,

430

and are therefore very unreliable when used as a means of exterpolation to determine the slope of so large a stream. It may be contended that the winds heap up the water into the Gulf. Between Rebecca Shoal and Havana the depth is from 100 fathoms to nearly 1 ooo fathoms, for a width of 73 miles. It is difficult to conceive how the wind blowing upon the suiface of this great stream could appreciably affect its flow for more than 100 feet below the surface, or from one-sixth to one-sixtieth of the total depth. If the current in but this small portion of the depth is retarded by the wind, the effect on the permanent level of the Gulf must be very small indeed, for the waters deep below the surface will surely flow on in obedience to the difference of pressure caused by the surface slope, irrespective of the winds above. It may be noted in this connection that the only other opening of the Gulf, the Yucatan Channel, is also very deep, more than 1 ooo fathoms for nearly a third of its width. If the average barometric pressure is less on the Gulf than on the Atlantic, the effect will be to make the mean level of the Gulf higher than that of the Atlantic. But· to acc:ount for a permanent difference of a foot in this way requires the assumption that the average barometric pressure on the Gulf is an inch of mercury less than on the Atlantic. In any endeavor to estimate the difference of elevation of the Gulf and the Atlantic necessary to account for the observed currents in the Gulf Stream, the effect of the vertical circulation* in the stream and adjacent waters produced by differences of density must also be carefully taken into account. From the foregoing considerations the writer is forced to conclude that it is useless to attempt to determine the difference of elevation of the Gulf and the Atlantic from the theoretical relations connecting slope, velocity, barometric pressure, winds, and differences of density; that plausible theoretical arguments can be advanced for any estimate varying from one inch to one foot; and that it would be decidedly unwise to introduce into the adjustment of the level nets the assumption that there is any appreciable difference of elevation, unless such difference can be shown to exist from the direct results of the leveling itself. Four values for the apparent elevation of the Gulf above the Atlantic, which are largely independent, may be derived from the leveling: First, from the leveling across Florida; second, from the line Old Point Comfort, Washington, Hagerstown, Odin, Corinth, Meridian, to Biloxi; third, from the line Sandy Hook, Hagerstown, Odin, St. Louis, (this portion via the C. and G. S. line), Pleasant Hill, Harrisonville, Little Rock, Arkansas City, and thence, by Coast and Geodetic Survey line, to Carrollton and Biloxi; fourth, from the line, mainly by the Engineers, from Boston and New York to Greenbush (the mean of these two being taken), to Oswego (the mean of the two lines being taken), through the lakes, via Chicago and Duluth, to Savannah (the mean again being taken), thence by the river line to Arkansas City, thence to Vidalia (the mean of two Engineer lines between these two points being taken), to Carrollton by Coast and Geodetic Survey line, and, finally, to Biloxi by the Engineers' line. The four values for the apparent elevation of the Gulf above the Atlantic are, respectively, +0·258 metre, + 1 ·028 ·metres, +0·385 millimetre, +0·175 metre, and their mean is +0·462 metre
*This vertical circulation is discussed in detail by Mr. A. Lindenkobl in Appendix No. 6, pp. 355-369, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 18g5.

APPENDIX NO. 8.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

431

The range, 0·85 metre, in these values is so great that it can hardly be contended with confidence that the mean represents an actual difference of elevation. Moreover, an examination of the closing errors in the table on page 428, shows that accumulated errors nearly as large or larger than· this mean have repeatedly been found in comparatively smaU circuits. The line across Florida is very much shorter than any of the other lines connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf, and therefore, a priori, is entitled to greater weight than any of the others. Attention has been called to the fact (see page 397) that the six separate results from this line vary from +0·558to -0·321 metres. Finally, it should be noted that if the weight assigned to the Engineer line in deriving the mean be increased, as the evidence contained in the list of circuit closures on page 428 indicates that it should be, then the mean for the four lines will approach zero, as the Engineer line gives the lowest value for the apparent elevation of the Gulf. In view of the above evidence the writer believes that a greater degree of accuracy will be attained in the adjustment of the level net by assuming that the mean surface of the Gulf and of the Atlantic are at sensibly the same elevation, than by introducing any correction, derived either fro1~1 theory or from the leveling itself, for the elevation of the Guif above the Atlantic. Such a correction, if introduced, might perchance prove in the course of time to be twice, thrice, or ten times as large as it should be. The level net adjustments which follow are therefore based upon the assumption that the mean surfaces of the Gulf and of the Atlantic and also of Chesapeake Bay are at one elevation.
PRELIMINARY ADJUSTMENT OF COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY LEVEL NET.

The net, composed almost wholly of Coast and Geodetic Survey lines, which is available for investigation, is made up of the two lines from Sandy Hook and Washington to Hagerstown, the transcontinental line from Hagerstown to Holliday, the lines from Pleasant Hill and Holliday to Harrisonville, the line from Harrisonville to Arkansas City and down the Mississippi River to Carrollton and thence to Biloxi, the line between Vicksburg and Meridian, and finally the so-called Meridian Line between Odin and Biloxi. The only line by the Engineers involved in the net is the short line of 33 kilometres between Greenville and Wilkersons Landing. The remainder of the lines were leveled by the Coast and Geodetic Survey previous to 1899. These lines form a net having eleven links, as shown in the following equations, and involving five circuits, including those of which the water levels along the Gulf and Atlantic form one side.

In forming these circuit closures, and in the following adjustment, it is assumed, as indicated on page 410, that mean sea level at Washington is 88"0 millimetres above the Chesapeake and the Atlantic, that allowance being made for the fall of the Potomac. Even though the distance given in the last two circuits does not include the water leveling between Sandy Hook and Washington and between Biloxi and Washington, the closures expressed in millimetres per kilometre are not noticeably greater in these circuits than in the remaining three. To adjust this net by least squares so as to distribute the closing errors properly, one may write the following observation equations. Only the independent unknowns, namely, the elevations of the various junction points of the net, appear in these equations, and therefore there are no equations of condition. Each equation expresses an observed difference of elevation between two bench marks indicated in parentheses, or between a bench mark and sea level as determined at a tide gauge.

The weights assigned to the various lines are r ooo times the reciprocals of the lengths of the lines in kilometres. The lengths given do not include the distances involved in the local relations treated in the paragraphic matter on pages 402-414. This method of assigning weights amounts to giving infinite weight to determinations of the elevation of tidal bench marks. A comparison of the errors of leveling with the errors in long series of tidal observations shows that whereas this method of weighting would not be permissible if any two tidal stations were quite near to each other, in the actual case in hand, in which the tidal stations are widely separated, the error of leveling between such stations preponderates so largely over the tidal errors that sensibly the same results are reached by giving the tidal observations infinite weight as by assigning to them relatively heavy weights warranted strictly by the evidence. The elevations for the various junction points of the net resulting from the adjustment are:

hence the probable error of a single kilometre of complete leveling is .V207=±14·4 millimetres.

PRELIMINARY ADJUSTMENT OF THE ENGINEERS LEVEL NET.

The net, composed almost wholly of leveling by the Engineers with Kern instruments, which is available for investigation, is made up of the two Van Orden lines from Boston and New York to Greenbush; the wye level lines from Greenbush to Troy, and from Troy to Oswego by the direct route; the line composed of a mixture of wye, precise and water leveling between Troy and Oswego via Lak~ Champlain; water leveling through the Great Lakes to Duluth and Chicago, supplemented by short lines of wye leveling or precise leveling between the Lakes; precise level lines from Duluth and Chicago to Savanna; thence a single line down the Mississippi River to Wilkersons Landing; the net work of precise lines by the Engineers in Arkansas and Louisiana, as shown on the sketch map opposite page 424; the Coast and Geodetic Survey level line along the Mississippi River from Vidalia to Carrollton; and finally the Engineer line from Carrollton to Biloxi. The inclusion of the Coast and Geodetic Survey line between Carrollton and Smithland was absolutely necessary to connect the net with sea level at Biloxi, and the short additional section of river line between Smithland and Vidalia was introduced to develop the large circuit extending to Shreveport. The Deep Waterways Commission lines between Oswego and Greenbush, and the Van Orden lines between Greenbush and Boston and New York, were necessarily included to connect with sea level at the eastern end of the net. These lines form a net having seventeen links, as shown in equations below, and involving seven circuits, including those of which. water levels along the Gulf and Atlantic form one side.

In this adjustment each line, including water lines along the Great Lakes, is given a weight equal to 1 ooo times the reciprocal of its length in kilometres, with the following exceptions: First, portions of lines leveled twic rard and backward two. different times, are given double weight.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 18<)8--99.

Second, local adjustments are left undisturbed, i. e., are given an infinite weight, as are also the determinations of elevations of tidal bench marks. Third, wye levels run under the direction of the Deep Waterways Commission are given half weight. Fourth, water levels between Cape Vincent and Oswego are given half weight on account of the shortness of the period of observation. Fifth, the Van Orden lines, Boston to Greenbush, and New York to Greenbush, are given half weight . .The effect of these exceptions is shown in detail below. If a line is to be given half weight, it is evident that its actual length should be doubled to obtain the equivalent

and

vice versa. The actual length of the line, Rayville to Wilkersons Landing, is 396 kilometres, but the equivalent length is 365 kilometres and the weight 2 ·7, 15 kilometres of the line being within the Vicksburg local adjustment, and therefore subtracted from the actual length, and 33 kilometres between Greenville and Wilkersons Landing, being leveled twice, and hence equivalent to only 17 kilometres of the standard line. The actual length of the line Wilkersons Landing to Savanna is 1 502 kilometres, but the equivalent length is 1 489, and the weight 0·67, since 21 kilometres of the line between St. Louis and P. B. M. 12 and 6 kilometre!:' between Albany and Fulton were leveled twice. The actual length of the line between Oswego and Troy by way of Lake Champlain is 662 kilometres. The equivalent distance is 1 031 kilometres and the weight 0·97. The 293 kilometres of wye levels were given half weight and were therefore equivalent to 586 kilometres of the standard line. The 76 kilometres of water levels on Lake · Ontario were also given half weight and were therefore equivalent to 152 kilometres. The direct line between Oswego and Troy, and the lines Troy to Greenbush, Boston to Greenbush, and Dobbs Ferry (New York) to Greenbush, were each given half weight, and hence the equivalent length of standard line is double the actual length of the line in each case.

PRELIMINARY GENERAL ADJUSTMENT OF COMPLETE NET.

It is now proposed to make a preliminary adjustment of the complete 'level net, using the best approximations. to the true weights for the separate lines that can be obtained from a study of the two preliminary adjustments of partial nets which have just been made. The proposed investigation of a possible correction to be applied for systematic errors will be postponed until after this preliminary adjustment is made. This adjustment is to be used simply to furnish more evidence as to the errors of the different classes of leveling, and will be superseded later by a final adjustment involving the same lines. The probable error of the complete leveling of a single kilometre as derived from the adjustment of the Coast and Geodetic Survey partial net is ±14·4 millimetres, but from the Engineers' partial net is ±2 ·3 millimetres, whereas the corresponding probable errors derived from discrepancies on short sections of the separate lines are (see pages 426-427) for Coast and Geodetic Survey lines ±0·96 millimetre, and for Engineers' lines ± 0·74 millimetre. Hence it is plain at once that the weights to be assigned to the various lines must be made to depend on the former probable errors, as the latter are evidently much too small to represent the facts. From the two preliminary adjustments it would appear that the weights to be assigned to equal lengths of the old Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling and the leveling of Engineers should be in.the ratio of 1 2 1 -)"to(-- ) or 1 to 40. In other \vords, if the weights to be assigned to the ( 14·4 2·3

l, L being the length of each line in kilometres.

An examination of the column of pv" s in the Engineer adjustment reveals, however, the important fact that the pv" s for the last two equations involving leveling by Van Orden are very much larger than for any of the other equations. This means that too great weight has been assigned to the Van Orden leveling in this adjustment; for the pv2' s being the residuals of the various equations after they are reduced to a standard accuracy, the mean pv2 for any group of the equations should be about the same as for any other group, if the weights have been properly assigned, and provided the two groups of lines compared are not in radically different positions in the net, such that the ends of the lines of one group are held much more rigidly by connecting lines than are the ends of the other group. An approximation to the probable error of an observation of unit weight by the Engineers, (eJE, and by Van Orden (e,) vo, may be obtained as follows: The averagepv2

Certain lines run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899, by the United States Geological Survey, and by the Pennsylvania Railroad, are included in the complete net, and a weight scale must be assigned to each of these. The method and instrument used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey levels of 1899 more nearly resembles that used by the Engineers than that used in either of the other two groups for whkh the weights have been investigated above. 'Hence, this leveling will be assigned the same scale of weights as the Engineers' leveling. Similarly, the Geological Survey and Van Orden methods and instruments so closely resemble each other that the proper weights must be nearly the same. The little that is known in regard to the Pennsylvania Railroad leveling seems to justify the arbitrary assignment to it of a weight about half that for the Van Orden levels. The complete scale of weights used in the following preliminary adjustment is then:

Three closures there given involving connections with sea level at Old Point Comfort and Annapolis do not enter in .the adjustment, however, since in the adjustment the elevation of the Capitol bench mark at Washington is assumed to be 27·7000 metres as fixed by the considerations set forth on page 410, and the lines between Washington and Old Point Comfort, and Washington and Annapolis are thus eliminated from the adjustment.

The net involves 54 lines and 25 circuits, including those of which water levels along the Gulf and· Atlantic form one side. Only the first five columns of the table below refer to the preliminary adjustment. The remaining columns will be explained later. Each of the observation equations expresses a measured difference of elevation, and the '' v '' set opposite is the correction to the observation given by the adjustment.

It will be noted that the line Vidalia to Concordia, No. 79, is used both in equation No. 6 and in No. 7. Similarly, the line Monroe to Parkeville, No. 86, is used in equations No. 9 and No. 18; and line No. 105, from St. Louis to near the mouth of the Missouri River, is used in both equations No. 27 and No. 33. The line Vidalia to Concordia is thus used twice, and Vidalia treated as a junction point, because the rigid treatment in which Concordia would also be regarded as a junction point would involve a very heavy weight for the link Vidalia to Concordia, on account of its shortness, and the line would necessarily receive a very small correction. The same statement also applies to the other cases cited. This practice of using certain short lines twice and substituting one junction point in the place of two junction points very near each other is merely a device for saving time with but little sacrifice of accuracy. The elevations for the junction points resulting from this adjustment will be found on page 449.
SYSTEMATIC ERROR IN OLD COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY LEVELS.

The committee on precise leveling, referred to on page 352, made in the winter of 1898-99 a prolonged investigation with a view to finding, if possible, the laws governing the systematic errors known fo exist in Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling. The method of investigation used by th1 m did not involve the use of least squares. The principal conclusion which they reached in regard to systematic errors was that a horizontal surface as defined by Coast anJ Geodetic Survey leveling of precision is always

442

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18<)&-99.

tipped up slightly with reference to the true horizontal surface, the rotation being about a line 20° north of west or south of east, the inclination being such that the southwestern part of the surface is too low and the northwestern portion too high, regardless of the direction in which the leveling actually progressed. According to this law, a Coast and Geodetic Survey level line running in a direction about 20° east of north will run too low at a maximum rate; a line in the opposite direction will run too high at a maximum rate, and in the two directions at right angles, namely, 20° north of west and 20° south of east, a line will not be subject to a systematic tendency to run either too high or too low. To test the reality of this supposed law, each observation equation in the three preliminary adjustments on the preceding pages has been written with such a sign that if the law istrue, the correction, v, to the observed difference of elevation expressed by the equation should be positive. For example, equation No. 5 on page 432 could have been written elther (Meridian, C)-(Odin, V)=-54·7128 metres, or (Odin, V)(Meridian, C)=+54·7128 metres. The latter form was purposely chosen, because, if the law in question is true, the observed elevation of Odin above Meridian should be too small, Odin being nearly due north from Meridian, and hence the v of the equation should be positive if the equation was so written. A preponderance in number and size of v' s with the plus sign over those with the minus sign will indicate, therefore, the reality of the law. In the preliminary adjustment shown on page 432, involving Coast and Geodetic Survey levels alone, seven of the v' s have a plus sign and only four the minus, and the sum of the plus v's is 2·22 metres, while the sum of the minus v's is 0·97 metre. In the preliminary general adjustment shown on pages 439-440 the number of old Coast and Geodetic Survey lines is twenty-five. Fifteen of the v' s have plus signs and only ten the minus, and the sum of· the plus v' s is 2 ·70 metres, while the sum of the minus v' sis 0·97 metre. As a contrast the same test may be applied to the leveling by the Engineers. In the preliminary adjustment of this leveling shown on page 435 the first and second and sixteenth and seventeenth equations represent lines by others than the Engineers. If these are omitted there remain thirteen v' s, of which seven have plus signs and six minus signs. The sum of the plus v' sis o· 21 metre, and of the minus v's 0·14 metre. Similarly, in the preliminary general adjustment·shown on pages 439440 there are seventeen Engineer lines. Seven of the v' s have plus signs and ten minus signs, the sum of the plus v's being o·os metre, and of the minus v's 0'12 metre. It thus appears that the law holds good for Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899, though it is masked to a considerable extent by other large errors. The same kind of evidence also indicates that systematic errors following this law do not exist in the leveling by the Engineers. There are so few lines of each of the other classes of leveling in the net that it is not feasible to make such investiga.tions for them. It is desirable to determine the law of this error, which is systematic with respect to direction, more accurately, and to apply to the observations the proper correction to eliminate it so far as is possible. The necessary correction on any line may most conveniently be expressed in the symbolic form nA + wB, in which n is the northing and w the westing of one end of the line from the other, and A and Bare unknown constants to be determined. The following observation equations were used to derive the most probable values of the unknown constants A and B. The line of levels involved in

APPENDIX NO. 8.

each equation is indicated by its terminals. The coefficient of A is the llorthing and of B the westing, in hundreds of kilometres, to the first-named terminal from the second. The second member of each of the last six equations is the correction necessary to make the leveling agree with the tidal determinations as indicated on pages 396-397, 410-41 l. In the remaining equations the second member, the best available value for the required correction to the line, is the v·from the preliminary adjustment shown on pages 439-440. 10·5 The weights assigned to each line are as before L ' except for the last six lines, which are given double weight, L, because both ends of these lines are fixed by tidal observations. The second solution of these equatiolls indicated in the last three columns is to be explained later (see page 446).

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)9.

The formation and solution of the normal equations gave the following results: A= +o· l 144±0·0205 metre; B= -0·0393±0·0177 metre. The probable error of an observation of unit weight was found to be ,Jo·ooo939. The unit of horizontal distance used in the equations being loo kilometres, these results mean that to a line runnin"g due north the correction to be applied is + l · 144 millimetres per kilometre, and to a line running due west, -o· 393 millimetre per kilometre. It may be contended that the apparent systematic error shown above is not real, but is simply due to having erroneously assumed the Gulf to be at the same elevation as the Atlantic, whereas it may be claimed that it is considerably above. It is desirable then to obtain some check on the reality of the systematic error which is independent of any such assumption. In the level net as show'1 on the sketch opposite page 424 there are 18 circuits, of which ·Coast and Geodetic Survey levels previous to 1899 form a part only, the remainder being either spirit leveling of some other kind or water levels. Only one of these circuits-namely, that given by the level lines from St. Augustine to Cedar Keys and. the water leveling from Cedar Keys to St. Augustine through the Straits of Florida-has a closing error which is affected by the assumption as to the relative elevation of the Gulf and the Atlantic. The remaining 17 closures are independent of any such assumption. Of these 17, 14 have closing errors of the sign which would be accounted for by assuming that the closing error is due entirely to the above systematic error in the portion of the circuit run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey previous to 1899. For example, in the circuit Cairo-Odin-St. Louis-Cairo the eastern and northern sides of the circuit were run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and according to the law of the supposed systematic error the line from Cairo to St. Louis via Odin should run considerably low and cause the closing error of the circuit to be negative. The actual closing error is -227 millimetres. The only circuits which close with the opposite sign from that which would be accounted for by the systematic errors treated above are Jefferson City-Kansas City-Pleasant Hill-Jefferson City, Arkansas City-St. LouisPleasant Hill-Harrisonville-Arkansas City, and Smithland-Vidalia-Jonesville-MonroeShreveport--Smithland.
RELATION OF WEIGHT TO LENGTH OF LINE.

Before applying these corrections in the level net and making the final adjustment, it is still necessary to investigate the assumption that the weights to be assigned to the various lines of any class of leveling should be proportional to

Z' this being the proper

scale of weights if the accidental errors predominate largely over the systematic errors. A direct test of this assumption for the two principal classes of lines may now be made by writing the pv"s for each class in the order of magnitude of the P's. If, as a rule, the longer lines corresponding to the small{!r p's have been &.ssigned weights which are relatively too large, the Pzi"s for those lines will be found to be larger on an average than for the shorter lines. On the other hand, if the assigned relation of weight to length is about right, no well-marked progression should be found when the pv"s are arranged in the order of the P's,

The pv21 s for the Engineer lines and for the Coast and Geodetic Survey lines without systematic correction are from the preliminary general adjustment shown on pages 439-440. The second set of Coast and Geodetic Survey pv'"s is from the equations on page 443. The values of pv" greater than the mean in any column are printed in bold-face type. As abundant evidence has been brought forward to show that systematic errors predominated in the old Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling, it was to be expected, as strongly indicated by the second column of the table, that the accumulated errors on these lines increased much faster than ,JL, and that therefore the weights assigned to the long lines are considerably too great. The third column indicates, however, that even after the best available correction for systematic error has been applied, the weights for the long lines are still relatively much too great, for in the third column four out of the six values for pv" which exceed the mean are among the 15 long lines having assigned weights less than ·6, while only one such value falls among the 10 remaining shorter lines. The mean pv· for the 15 longer lines is also more than twice as great as for the 10 shorter lines. It is obviously desirable, therefore, to make a closer approximation to the facts in the final adjustment by assigning relatively lighter weights to the longer lines.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 189f!-99.

With the Engineers' lines, on the contrary, there is a strong indication that the longer lines have been assigned weights which are too small. If this indication represents a fact, then the accumulated errors on lines of this kind increase more slowly than ,./Z; that is, more slowly than they would increase according to theory, even if all the errors belonged to the accidental class. As it is very unlikely that such a remarkable condition exists, it will be assumed that the indication shown in the table is a result of chance, and the weights for Engineer lines will in the final adjustment be made propor. I ttonal to L , as before. Other classes of lines will be weighted proportional to~· the little evidence available in regard to them indicating that they belong with the Engineer lines rather than with the old Coast and Geodetic Survey lines in this respect.
SECOND SOLUTION OF SYSTEMATIC CORRECTION EQUATIONS.

The above evidence having indicated that the accumulated errors of old Coast and Geodetic Survey lines increase faster than ,./Z, and that the assigned weights for the · long lines must therefore be decreased, the question at once arises, What relation shall now be assumed between the length and weight? As a working hypothesis, weights proportional to

This working hypothesis will be tested later.

error is proportional to L.

Using these new weights, namely, ~, the equations on page 443 were solved again with the results shown in the last three columns of the table. The new solution gave A=+o·1220±0·0192 metre and B=-0·0268±0·0176 metre, in close agreement with the former results. The probable error of an observation of unit weight was found to be ,./0·000424. It is interesting to note the close agreement between the direction of the zero line as given by the estimate of the committee on precise leveling in 1898-99 and the above solution. The committee estimated that a line running twenty degrees north of west would have no systematic correction. The above solution indicates that a zero line 0 0268 should make an angle with the due west line of tan_, ' =12°. 0·1220 The assumption that the weights should be proportional to

may now be tested

by arranging the /Jv2' s of this second solution in the order of magnitude of the P's as before. The values of pv2 which exceed the mean value are printed in bold-faced type.

The table indicates that the assumed relation between weight and length is correct, and hence it will be used in the final adjustment. ·
FINAL GENERAL ADJUSTMENT.

The average pv from all lines in the preliminary general adjustment given on pages 439-440 is I 266. The average pv from the sixteen Engineer lines, namely I 255, agrees very closely with this, and indicates that the Engineer lines have been correctly weighted relatively to the average of all the other lines. The weights for the Engineer lines will therefore be preserved unchanged in the final adjustment. The average pv in the second solution of the equations for determining the systematic correction, as shown on page 443, is 560. To put these weights on the same basis as those assigned to the Engineer lines, they must therefore be increased about 2 3 oo , h e ratio ' o f 56o to I 2 66 , or f rom Iy.OOO mt to L· , but as the pv's will probably be decreased a little in the general adjustment on account of the corrections adjusting themselves to the new weights, the weights assigned will be made a little greater than this, or, adopting a round number,

The fact that the four lines of water levels on the Great Lakes, Nos. 39, 40, 41, 42, in the preliminary general adjustment have a mean pv· of only 98*, as contrasted with a mean of I 266 for all lines, indicates very strongly that the weights assigned to these lines are much too small. The indication is not so conclusive as it would be if these lines were not in the edge of the level net, and therefore have their ends rather loosely fixed. To err on the side of caution the weights for these lines will not be increased. To err similarly in the conservative rather than the radical direction, the weights for the two Deep Waterways lines between Greenbush and Oswego, Nos. 51 and 52, and for the Pennsylvania Railroad line between Harrisburg and Braddock, No. 45, will not be increased, though for the former the mean pv2 is only 450 and for the latter the jv" is 356. The Deep Waterways lines are in the edge of the net, and there is but a single Pennsylvania Railroad line upon which to base a judgment. The three Geological Survey lines, Nos. 43, 44, 46, in the preliminary general adjustment, have a meanpv2 of 618, and the two Van Orden lines, Nos. 53 and 54, a mean of 3 886. The Geological Survey lines are held loosely at the ends in comparison with the Van Orden lines, which combined reach nearly from one tidal determination to another. This may account in part for the discrepancy between the two mean pv2' s for these lines on which similar methods and instruments were used. Hence, the five lines will be grouped together with a mean pv2 of I 925, indicating that the weights should be decreased in the ratio of

Gilbert, in Part 2, United States Geological Survey Report for 18~7, pages 595-647, that the Great Lakes region is tilting steadily toward the southwestward. Observations upon three of these four lines of water levels were made in 1875, whereas the spirit leveling connected with these lines in the adjustment is nearly all of a much later date. If there had been an appreciable change in the relative elevation of the bench marks about the Great Lakes it would become evident in the form of large apparent corrections to these old lines of water levels, whereas they show remarkably small corrections. The estimated rate of tilting in the paper cited was such that two bench marks 100 miles apart, the second being south 27° west from the first (that being the assumed direction of tilting) should change their· relative elevation by 0·42 foot per century. The levels are apparently incompetent to determine whether or not so slow a change has been taking place since 1875.

The systematic correction computed from the constants A and B, shown on page 446, are applied, as indicated in column 7 on pages 439-440, to all old Coast and Geodetic Survey level lines before making the final adjustment. The absolute terms in the final adjustment are therefore the algebraic smns of corresponding quantities in columns 7 and 2. The final general adjustment differs from the preliminary general adjustment only in using different weights for certain lines and in using Coast and Geodetic Survey lines after correction for systematic 'errors. The sixth, eighth, and ninth columns on pages 439-440 show the weights, residuals, and weighted residuals, from the final general adjustment. The v' s are, as before, the derived corrections to the observed differences of elevation indicated in the equations. In an equation involving old Coast and Geodetic Survey levels the total correction to any observed difference is of course the algebraic sum of the systematic correction given in column 7 and the v. The elevations resulting from the final adjustment are shown below. Opposite them, for convenient reference, are given the corrected elevations from each of the three preliminary adjustments. These serve by comparison as a means of estimating the accuracy of the final elevations and especially as a means of indicating the extent to which the derived elevations are dependent upon the judgment of the computer in fixing the weights assigned and the form of the computation.

A few points given in columns 2 and 3 are not junction points of the nets to which they are credited. In such cases the elevations have been derived for the present purpose by interpolation between adjacent junction points. It might seem at first sight that the elevations from the two general adjustments must necessarily fall between those given by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Engineer adjustments. That this is not true is due to the fact that the general adjustments include many lines not involved in any of the other adjustments. The comparatively large differences between the second, third, and fourth columns are due largely to different lines being used in the different adjustments, whereas the small differences between columns 4 and s are due to improvements in the computation without the addition of new data. The table serves to indicate, then, that small changes would be produced by any further attempt at improvement in the computation, in comparison with those which would probably take place whenever any new lines which may become available are introduced. The probable error of the elevation of bench mark K 3 at St. Louis has been computed from the adjustment and found to be ±65 millimetres. It is an even chance, then, that this computed elevation will not be changed more than 65 millimetres by any amount of new leveling, and it is almost certain that it will not be changed by as much as 0·3 metre, or 1 foot. The probable error of an observation of unit weight is from this adjustment ±32 ·9 millimetres, and for lines by the Engineers the probable error of the completed leveling of a single kilometre is ± 1 ·04 millimetres.
LIST OF PRECISE ELEVATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.

The computed elevations given in the following list are not final in the sense that they will remain unchanged. It is not possible to obtain elevations which are final in that sense, unless no more leveling is to be done, or if done is to be ignored. Each new line of leveling connected with the net furnishes the means of making a closer approximation to the truth. Advantage will be takenfrom time to time of whatever new data are available by making a· revision of the adjustment. The elevations here published are believed to represent the best approach to the truth that can be made at present, using all observations that are available at this Office. From time to time this list of elevations as modified by additional observations will be republished. Two years hence, if the same willingness on the part of various organizations to cooperate in this matter is shown as at present, it will be possible to improve the adjustment considerably. The water leveling through the Great Lakes is now being revised by the Lake Survey. Certain short lines of precise levels have been run by the Engineers in the Vicksburg district, of which the final computation has not been made. The line from Biloxi has been rerun, under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission, to Carrollton and up the river for some distance beyond Baton Rouge. Under the same organization precise level lines now exist, although they are not available for the present adjustment, between New Orleans, Port Eads, and the lower end of the Southwest Pass. Before this appendix has passed through the press, the short gap, less than 80 miles, between Norfolk, Nebr., and Sioux City, Iowa, in the circuit Sioux City-Kansas City-Abilene-Sioux City, will be closed. It is also expected that by t.hat time a new Coast and Geodetic Survey line will be available, running

southward from Cincinnati to Decatur and Birmingham, connecting near Knoxville and Chattanooga with the thousand-mile loop of precise leveling by the United States Geological Survey, which starts from the Atlantic at Morehead City, N. C., and reaches it again at Brunswick, Ga. This one new Coast and Geodetic Survey line will introduce five new circuits into the level net. In deriving the elevations given in the following list the local differences of elevation adopted as indicated on pages 402-414 have been preserved unchanged. For each line which forms a link in the level net, the adjustment in connection with these local relations furnishes a fixed elevation at each end and hence furnishes the required correction to the observed elevation at those two points. For intermediate points the required corrections to the observed elevations have been interpolated between the end points, on the supposition that the correction varies at a uniform rate in millimetres per kilometre along the line. If a bench mark is common to two or more lines between fixed pointsas, for example, certain bench marks between Washington and Richmond which were connected with both the line of 1883-84 and of 1895-a mean or weighted mean of the two corrected elevations is taken as the adopted elevation. Such bench marks common to two lines serve to break each of them into sections, each of which, if it contains any intermediate bench marks, is treated as a link having fixed ends in deriving the elevations of these bench marks. With one exception, a constant correction has been applied to all elevations on each spur line equal to the correction applied to the main line at the base of the spur. The transcontinental line west of Holliday is the one exception. On this line from Holliday to Denver, run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey previous to 1899, a correction for systematic error has been applied in accordance with the constants shown on page 446. The total corrections to the elevations due to this cause, west of Holliday, were as follows for the points named:

After applying these corrections at the points nameJ, the corrections at intermediate points were interpolated between them, upon the supposition that the correction varied at a constant rate in millimetres per kilometre of line nm. The closing error of the Limon-Roswell-Denver circuit was also distributed uniformly around the circuit. It may be said in criticism that the systematic error dependent upon direction should be applied to each short portion of the line according to the direction of that portion. The method used applies the proper total correction to any line and insures a fair approximation to the true correction at intermediate points by interpolation. 'l'o apply the correction in detail to each short portion of the line would require more computing than would be justified by the slight gain fo accuracy, especially when it is cousidered that the true value of the systematic correction is only approximately known.

The elevations are given in the following list to tenths of millimetres". This does not imply that the tenths are known. For bench marks not more than 2 kilometres apart the difference of elevation is uncertain in the millimetres and tenths; for those which are from 2 to 200 kilometres apart the centimetres are also uncertain, and for greater distances there may be in some cases an uncertainty in the decimetres. Similarly, the uncertainty in the absolute elevations varies with the distance from the nearest tidal connection. For the lines which are as yet unpublished the column in certain parts of the following table headed '' Elevation as reported '' gives the elevations reported to this Office as the direct result of the leveling. For the convenience of those who may wish to compare the elevations here given with others which are expressed in feet, or vice versa, the following conversion table is here inserted:

THE ORTHOMETRIC CORRECTION.

As the orthometric correction has not been applied in deriving the adopted ele,·ations given on pages 472-548, it is in order to explain the reason for the omission. The mean surface of the sea is approximately an ellipsoid of the revolution which may be considered to be generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis which is in coincidence with the axis of the earth. Any other equipotential surface above mean sea level is a similar ellipsoid of revolution. The distance between the sea surface considered produced under the land, and a given equipotential surface above it,

APPENDIX NO. 8.

necessarily increases as the equator is approa<_::hed. If, then, a line of levels run along a median indicates that a series of bench marks are all at the same level, said bench marks all lie, except for errors of observation, in the same equipotential surface, but the bench marks on the southern end of the line are farther from sea level than those on the northern end. The correction to differences of elevation observed with the leveling instrument, which is known as the orthometric correction, and is due to this convergence of the equipotential surfaces toward the north, may be expressed by the formula - 5""".22!t L1 rfi sin ( ¢1 ¢.), in which It is the mean elevation in metres of the line of levels; L1 rfi = </>of higher point minus <P of lower point, expressed in radians; and rp, and¢. are the latitudes of the two points. The formula applies strictly only to points which are near each other. For points at great distances apart the correction must be obtained by integration of the small corrections to the separate short portions of the level line between them. From the formula it is evident that the correction is zero on an east and west line. For a level line along a meridian the effect of the correction is always to increase the computed elevations at the northern end of the line. The correction is proportional to the mean elevation of the line of levels; tends to be greatest in latitude 45 °, and is in millimetres per kilometre greater for a line along a meridian than for one in any other direction. Two lines of thought have lead to the decision to ignore the orthometric correction. Firstly, though this correction is familiar to ge.odesists, it is not well known among other engineers, and is likely to be misunderstood by them. Indeed, as seen from the ordinary point of view of the engineer, the application of this correction would lead to apparent absurdities. Secondly, though to apply the correction it is necessary to do a large amount of computing, the outcome would be to change the final elevations resulting from the net adjustment by amounts which would be nearly, if not always, less than the probable errors of those elevations. To illustrate the apparent absurdities to which the application of the orthometric correction may lead, let us suppose that a long series of simultaneous readings of two gauges have been made at the Straits of Mackinac and at Port Huron, on Lake Huron, and that these readings indicate that two bench marks near the respective gauges are at the same elevation. If now the formula given above be used to correct for the convergence of the lilean lake surface and the mean sea surface toward the northward, it will be found that the bench mark at Port Huron is really 45 ·7 millimetres' farther from mean sea level than the one at the Straits of Mackinac, and its corrected elevation will be greater by that amount. The apparent result of the computation is to indicate that the water flows up a grade from the Straits of Mackinac to Port Huron. Such a paradox is liable to be misunderstood unless one is thoroughly familiar with all the ideas concerned. The orthometric corrections to the transcontinental line of levels from Sandy Hook to Denver would everywhere be very small, because the line is nowhere far from the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude. On the other hand the total orthometric correction to the elevation of bench mark V, at Odin, Ill., as derived from the line run· almost due north from Biloxi to Odin, the direction which tends to give the maximum correction

+

·In making this computation the elevation of the surface of Lake Huron is assl!med to be 177 metres ~nd the latitudes of the points named to be 45° 50 1 and 43° oo'.

COAST AND GEODETIC. SURVEY REPORT, 18<)8-<)9.

is only -68 millimetres,' or only -0·06 millimetre per kilometre of distance run. The maximum orthometric correction expressed in millimetre per kilometre, on any of the lines yet leveled in the United States, occurs on the line Colorado Springs to Denver, where it amounts to - 158 millimetres· on 12 I kilometres or about - 1 · 3 millimetres per kilometre. In view of the fact that the greatest extension of the level net is from east to west; that but few lines east of Kansas City are above an elevation of 300 metres, and that the mean latitude of the tidal connections is very nearly the same as the mean latitude of the net, it makes very little difference in the elevations resulting from the adjustment of the net whether the orthometric correction is applied before making the adjustment or is ignored. There are probably but few points in the net east of Kansas City of which the elevation would be changed by as much as 5 centimetres if a new adjustment were made after applying the orthometric correction, and on all lines except those in Colorado atid Wyoming the change in the relative elevations would be much less than I millimetre per kilometre. The maximum change in elevation produced by applying the orthometric correction would occur at Rock Creek, Wyoming, where it would be about 0·5 metre.
EXPLANATION OF ERROR WHICH IS SYSTEMATIC WITH RESPECT TO DIRECTION.

In the preceding pages the fact that an error which is systematic with respect to direction exists in the old Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling, and the quantitive expression of that error have both been established by a purely inductive method, by an appeal to the observed facts without reference to any theory. It is now proposed to set forth a rational explanation for the existence of this systematic error. It is interesting to note that this order of treatment of the subject corresponds with the order in which the actual investigation was made. It was first established by an appeal to the facts that said law of error existed, and the explanation of the law was discovered later. It is desirable at this point to get the subject into proper perspective by noting the extreme smallness of the errors to be explained. The maximum value of the error according to the constants given on page 446 is only I ·25 millimetres per kilometre. This corresponds to a vertical angle of only 0"·25. The maximum correction in millimetres per kilometre to any line in the final general adjustment, as shown by columns 7 and 8 on pages 43cr-440, namely, I ·65 millimetres per kilometre on the line Corinth to Meridian corresponds to a vertical angle of only o" ·33. When one consiclers that two stars separated by such an angular interval are distinguishable as separate stars only by very powerful telescopes of much larger dimensions than the level telescope, one begins to realize the accuracy of the leveling. When it is considered that a reading on a line of the diaphragm as seen projected against the rod may be, and often is, in error from all causes by as much as 3 millimetres on a sight of 50 to 100 metres, it will be realized that the errors on long lines commented on above indicate success in balancing errors against each other and in their elimination. Finally, if one notes that among the 2 1 Engineers' lines, including water levels on the Great Lakes, the maximum rate of correction given by- the final adjustment, which occurs on .the line Rayville to Vidalia, is
' This value was computed by dealing with the separate short sections of the line and adding results. ·This value has not been computed accurately, but is the result of applying the formula to the whole line at once with the assumption that the mean elevation of the line= r 86o metres and the two latitudes are 38° 49' and 39° 46'.

APPENDIX NO. 8.

only o· 17 millimetre per kilometre, corresponds to a vertical angle of only 0"·03, one is inclined to wonder at the accuracy attained rather than to look for explanations of the exceedingly small outstanding errors. It will probably be conceded by all who are familiar with instruments of precision, and with the particular instruments herein described and the conditions under which they are used in the field, that unequal though small changes of temperature are continually taking place in different parts of the leveling instrument while in use; that these unequal changes of temperature produce continual small changes in the relative positions of the different parts of the instrument; that all portions of the instrument on the side from which the greatest amounts of heat are being received tend to assume higher temperatures than those on the opposite side, and that in general the instrument receives more heat from the side toward the sun at any given time than from other directions, even though the immediate source of heat is not the sun (from the direct rays of which the instrument is always protected), hut inner surface of the tent or umbrella, surrounding ground, etc. Changes of the kind outlined above, occurring in parts of the instrument which are below the line of collimation of the telescope, can be shown to have but little influence upon the final results, while similar changes taking place above. that line can be shown to have marked effects. One effect of unequal changes of temperature occurring above the line of collimation is to change the angle between the tangent to the level vial at its middle point and the line of collimation. As soon as the telescope and striding level are placed in a given position the parts which are toward the source of heat (the sun) tend to assume a higher temperature than· the opposite parts, and the effect of the unequal expansion of the collars of the telescope and of the legs of the striding level, and of distortion of the level vial itself, is to cause the bubble to crawl slowly toward the source of heat. If later the telescope or striding level is reversed, a new set of unequal changes of temperature commences, of which the effect again is to make the bubble move toward the source of heat. Thus the bubble always tends to be nearer the sun than it would be if all parts of the instrument were always at the same temperature. The ultimate effect of this is to tend to make all readings upon rods toward the sun from the instrument too small after correction for T- H (measured angle between target and horizon) and all readings upon rods away from the sun too large after correction for T-H. These errors combine in their effect upon the computed elevations and tend to make all elevations carried toward the sun too great, and vice versa. Is this explanation quantitatively sufficient to account for the systematic errors which have been put in evidence? Do the laws of error corresponding to this explanation agree with the actual results of the leveling? To study this matter in detail let it be supposed that a level line is being run directly toward the sun and that the programme of observation is that shown on page 417, for a double simultaneous line using rods P and Q, Q always being read last, and let the effects of unequal expansion of the telescope collars, of unequal expansion of the legs of the striding level, and of distortion of the level vial, be considered separately. As soon as the telescope is placed in position for the backsight the object-end collar begins to acquire a temperature lower than that of the eye-end collar. This makes the reading on the back rod after correction for T-H (angle between target and horizon as measured with the micrometre) greater than it would be if the collars remained of the same temperature. This excess will continue to increase throughout the programme for

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898--99·

the backsight, as there is and can be no interchange of collars. It will therefore be greater during the readings on the Q rod than during those upon the P rod. As soon as the telescope is placed in position for the foresight the object-end collar, now toward the sun, tends to become the larger and the corrected rod reading tends to become smaller than it would be with collars of equal temperature. Here again the error on the Q rod will be greater than that on the P rod and of the same sign. The effects on the backsight and foresight combine to make the derived elevation from each line for the case in band too great, and to make the error greater for the Q line than for the P line. To a\loid circumlocution, the separate rod readings have been compared above with what they would have been with an instrument maintaining a uniform temperature. But it is evident that the whole change in the relative temperature of the two collars between a backsight and the corresponding foresight is effective in producing errors. A numerical result of the error from this source may be made. The radius of the collar of Coast and Geodetic Survey level No. 5 is 18 millimetres, the distance between the collars is 165 millimetres, the coefficient of expansion of the collar (bell metal) is about o·oooor8 per degree Centigrade. A change of o·r degree Centigrade in the relative temperature of the two collars between the backsight and the foresight will change the angle between the line of collimation and the tangent at the middle point of the level vial by

This systematic error of o''·o4 corresponds to 0·2 millimetres per kilometre. During the readings upon the back rod the striding level is reversed four times, as shown in the programme. As soon as the striding level is put in a given position the leg toward the sun tends to become longer. Although the frequent reversals tend to keep the two legs at the same temperature, the average temperature of the object-end leg during the backsight will be less than that of the eye-end leg, and during the foresight will tend to be greater than that of the eye-end leg. This will make the corrected readings on the back rod too great and on the front rod too small, and these two results combine to make the reduced elevations too great in the case under consideration. The only difference between the P rod and the Q rod readings with respect to this error is that the first level reading corresponding to the Q rod is taken after the level has had more time to accumulate error since the last change in its position than it had had when the corresponding level reading for the P rod was taken (see programme, page 417). The error from this cause on the Q line will tend therefore to be of the same.sign and a little greater than on the P line. On Coast and Geodetic Survey level No. 5, the distance between the legs of the level is 165 millimetres; the height from the points of _contact of the legs with the collars and the axis of the level vial is about 45 millimetres, and the coefficient of expansion of the legs is about 0·000018 per degree Centigrade. If the average relative temperature of the object-end and eye-end legs during the foresight differs by o 0 · r Centigrade from the corresponding quantity during the backsight, the change in the average angle between the line of collimation and the tangent at the middle point of the level vial is about tan-·1(45) (0·000018) (0·1). _ ,,. 165 - 0 IO. This systematic error of o"·ro corresponds to 0·5 millimetre per kilometre.

LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

One may easily convince himself by direct experiment with a level vial that the effect of a source of heat placed near one end of it is to make the bubble crawl toward that end, even without any change of temperature in the metal supports of the vial. Such movements of the bubble, due to distortion of the vial itself, are, therefore, of the same sign as those due to expansion and c01.1traction of the legs of the level, and will therefore simply serve to increase the errors due to temperature changes in the legs. In this case again the tendency will be for the Q line to be slightly more in error than the Pline. To sum up, the errors due to unequal expansion of the telescope collars and of the legs of the striding level and to distortion of the level vial are all systematic; they all tend to make deduced elevations too great when running toward the sun, and vice versa. These errors tend to be greater for the Q line than for the P line and ~f the same sign for both. If it be assumed on a given line of levels that the distortion of the level vial produces errors half as great as those produced by the unequal expansion of the legs of the striding level, that t}.le average temperature of the leg of the striding level toward the sun is 0°·04 Centigrade higher than the temperature of the other leg, and that the average temperature of the collar toward the sun is o 0 ·1 Centigrade higher than the other collar, then the systematic error introduced by these three causes will be 1 millimetre per kilometre. During the progress of the leveling along the given line the sun is steadily changing in azimuth during each day, and the systematic error at present under consideration is undergoing corresponding changes. The systematic error remaining in the final result from a long line of levels will be that corresponding to the average direction of the level line and the average effective azimuth of the sun during the hours of observation. This average effective azimuth will be a little west of south, both because the afternoon period of observation is upon an average slightly longer than the forenoon period and because of heat reflected from the ground and other objects toward the instrument from the direction of the sun will be much greater during the comparatively dry afternoon hours than during the moist morning hours. This agrees with the fact that the zero line for the systematic correction as derived from the observations is a little north of west. (See p. 446.) These systematic temperature errors should be expected to be much smaller in cloudy than in sunny weather; much smaller on the line run in the shade of trees or over grass than on the line unshaded from the sun or over the bare ballast of a railroad track, and should be expected to depend intimately upon the care taken to protect the instrument from the sun and from reflected heat from surrounding objects. The resulting systematic errors on various lines due to this cause may therefore be expected to vary widely. The explanation given on the preceding pages indicates not only that the errors should be numerically greater on the Q line than on the P line, and of the same sign, but also that the divergence between the Q line and the P line should be systematic with respect to the direction of the line just as the error of the mean line is systematic with respect to direction. Do the facts agree with these necessary consequences of the explanation put forward? There are four of the Coast and Geodetic Survey lines on which the programme

indicated on page 417 was used for which the true correction is known with a fair degree of accuracy. For these the relation between the correction to the Pline and the correction to the Q line is shown below.

The corrections stated for the first and third lines are those necessary to make the leveling agree with the tidal observations. The correction stated for the fourth line is that resulting from the final adjustment of the level net. The correction to the second line is that necessary to make the circuit close. These four lines are the only ones available for this test in which the program on page 417 was used on the whole of the line between the points at which the corrections to the elevations are known. It will be noted that in each one of the four cases shown the corrections to both lines are of the same sign, and in every case the Q line has the, greater correction, in accordance with the theory of the systematic error stated on the preceding pages. A careful examination of all the available lines was made to determine whether the relation between the total discrepancy, P-Q, on a line and the direction of the line was that called for by the theory stated above. The theory indicates that the sign of the total discrepancy, P-Q, on any line should be plus for the line running a little east of north, and minus for a line in the opposite direction; that the discrepancy expressed in millimetres pet kilometre should be a maximum in these directions, and on lines at right angles to these directions the discrepancy, P-Q, should be very small. The details of the .investigation are too voluminous to be given here. A total of nearly 2 400 kilometres of line was examined and of these lines 57 per cent showed the discrepancy, P-Q, in agreement with the theory, and 43 per cent disagreed with the theory. The discrepancies of those lines which agreed with the theory were, however, about three times as large as for those lines which disagreed. A second test of the same matter of the relation between the discrepancy, P-Q, and the direction of the line was made by examining these same lines ' by separating them into sections at points where there were marked changes in the general direction of the line, and comparing the rate of divergences of the P and Q lines on each section with the rate of divergence on the preceding and following sections. If the theory advanced is correct, whenever the direction of the line changes in such a way as to approach the direction 12° west of south, the minus rate of divergence between the P and Q lines should increase, and if the change of direction is such as to make it approach 12° east of north, the plus divergence should increase. The examination showed that out of 2 300 kilometres examined 82 per cent agreed with the theory and l 8 per cent disagreed.
·The Richmond-Georgetown line was omitted in this test because its direction is nearly constant.

SETTLING AND RISING OF RODS AND INSTRUMENT.

The literature of precise leveling indicates that in general a systematic settling of the instrument and of the rods has been feared. A minority have also expressed a suspicion that a systematic rising of instrument and rods may also occur. If a rod settles after a foresight is taken upon it and before the backsight is taken, the computed elevations beyond this point of the line will be too great by the amount of the settling, for in the computation the same elevation is ascribed to the rod after the settling actually took place as before. Similarly, if the instrument settles between a backsight and the corresponding foresight taken aftenvards, the computed elevation will be too great beyond this point for the same reason. So for the ordinary programs of observation in which the backsight is taken at each instrument station before the foresight, the effect of settling of either the instrument or rods will be to make all computed elevations too great in the direction in which a line was run, irrespective of the grades. If then a line is run forward and backward independently the sign of the divergence of the elevations, forward minus backward (F-B) should be plus, if a systematic settling of instrument and rods is its principal cause. Even if systematic settling is an important source of such divergence, though its effects are partially concealed on each separate line by other larger errors, the mean value of F-B from many lines should still have the plus sign. The following tables were compiled for the purpose of determining whether there is a systematic tendency for the instruments and rods to settle:

These tables show a slight indication that there is more of a systematic tendency for the instruments and rods to rise than to settle. It is probable that under certain sets of conditions there is a systematic tendency to settle and under other conditions to rise. In either case an error will be introduced into the computed elevations. To properly guard against such errors, regardless of whether the systematic tendency is to settle or to rise, it is evident that the proper precaution is to run independently in the forward and back direction over each secrion of the line before the conditions have had much time to change, say within a few days. The precaution of taking the foresights at alternate stations before the corresponding backsights will have a decided tendency to eliminate on each running of the line any error which might otherwise be caused by systematic rising or settling of the instrument, but no such precaution is av~ilable against the systematic movements of the rods.
GENERAL INFORMATION IX REGARD TO COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY LINES PREVIOUS TQ 1899.

Besides the investigations indicated in the preceding test, various other attempts were made to determine the laws governing the systematic errors in the old Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling, each of which gave a negative or inconclusive result. The following tables giving various items of information in regard to Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling will serve to enable one to make various such tests. A study of these tables in com1ection with the corrections shown by the general adjustment of the level net wi11 .indicate, for example, that the marked improvements made in the rods apparently were not followed by an appreciable increase in accura~y. This indicates that the principal errors were not those due to the rods. Similarly, an examination of the table indicates that the lines which were run continuously in one direction are not appreciably less accurate than those which are run independently in the forward and back direction, or of which ·alternate sections were run in opposite directions. This

APPENDIX NO. 8.

indicates that the errors due to rising or settling of instrument and rods did not predominate over other errors. It is not conclusive, however, as an indication that errors due to rising or settling do not exist in these observations, for the other errors involved are so large that they might effectually mask an error even as great as 0·2 millimetre or 0·3 millimetre per kilometre. ·

JUSTIFICATION OF CHA~GES IN :METHOD AND IKSTUME~T IN 1899.

As radical changes were made in the method of observation at the beginning of 1899 an explanation of the reasons for making these changes would seem to be desirable. In view of the many facts and special investigations studied in the preceding pages of this appendix, an explanation in detail is hardly needed, however. It should be evident from what has already been said that the change was from a well-tried method which was known to be subject to large systematic errors, to an equally well-tried method having accidental errors of about the same magnitude as the abandoned method, but subject to little vr no discoverable systematic error. The change was from a method having 25 entries in the record book per station to one having only 7 per station on a single line, and with a corresponding simplification in the computations. The true justification for the change must be the results of the change. With the old method 50 miles per month of double simultaneous line upon an average during a season was seldom exceeded. With the new method during its first season, of three parties, two averaged 45 miles per month of completed forward and back line, and the third party averaged 63 per month. It has been estimated that other things being equal it requires 40 per cent longer to complete a forward and back line than to complete the same line by the double simultaneous method if the same program of observation is used in both cases. While the new method is substantially that used by the Engineers it is believed that improvements in the details of the work and in the instrument have secured a much higher average speed at a lower cost, with little or no sacrifice of accuracy.· The change from the double simultaneous lines to the more costly forward and back line needs no further justification than that outlined on pages 879-880, indicating that on the old double simultaneous lines the mean of the two lines ·was ordinarily farther from the truth than the line first observed alone; together with the two general considerations (which are forcible even if the particular systematic error inherent in the old

APPENDIX NO. 8.

work has been greatly reduced or eliminated), that the two components of a double simultaneous line are dependent ttpon the same conditions, and that any systematic errors which are functions of the time occupied by readings at a station, whether due to temperature or not, affect the second line more seriously than the first. A comparison of the changes made in the instrument as stated on page 418 with the explanation of the systematic error as given on pages 876-879 will show that several of the changes were designed primarily to eliminate systematic errors due to temperature changes. The ratio of the distance between the level vial and the line of collimation to the length of the striding level was reduced one-half; the coefficient of expansion of the metallic parts of the telescope and striding level was reduced to about one-fourth its former value, and the level vial itself was protected more thoroughly froni sudden changes of temperature than before. The change in the method of observation also reduced greatly the interval between the foresight and the backsight at a station. To ascertain if possible in a single .season whether these precautions had been entirely effective, and also to serve as a basis for an examination as to the possible existence of other systematic errors, the observers in 1899 were required to insert notes in the record showing for each short section of a line the time of day, the weather conditions with reference to sun and wind, and the relative directions of running on· each short section and of the sun and wind. By the use of the notes in regard to the sun it is possible to apply a test which is competent to detect the systematic temperature error if it still exists unless it is exceedingly small. If the forward and backward runnings on a certain section of the line were made at such times that in both cases the progression was directly toward the sun, it is evident that the tendency of the systematic temperature error being to make both lines nm high toward the sun, the discrepancy B-F between the two runnings would tend to be of the minus sign. Similarly, if in both cases the line progressed away from the sun the sign of B-F should be plus. In short, though, for certain cases, as for instance when the forward line was run toward the sun and the backward line from it the systematic error would not tend to affect the discrepancy B-F, yet for most combinations of circumstances the sign of this effect 011 B-F may be predicted. The actual signs and magnitudes of the B-F discrepancies may therefore be used as a means of detecting the systematic error. Such a test was applied carefully and in detail to each of the three lines run in 1899. The test indicates that the systematic temperature error still affects observations, but to a very small extent only. Indeed, the apparent evidence of the continued existence of the error is so slight that it may be only the chance combjnation of accidental errors. A careful test similar to that indicated above was also applied to one of the lines to determine whether an error which is systematic with respect to the direction of the wind is inherent in the observations. The test failed to detect such an error. The average cost of the field work for the leveling done in 1899 was $13.55 per mile of completed line ($8.42 per kilometre). This represents the actual cost of the field work with the exception of the original cost of the instruments and the office repairs to them, and the cost of stationery supplied to field parties. These items are difficult to obtain and are relatively very small. The cost given includes all payments for services, including the salary of chief of party and such traveling expense~ to and from the field as were paid by the Government. For the line between Solomon, Kans., and Norfolk, Xebr., the average cost of the field work was $11 per mile ($7 per kilometre). The

cost of making the final computation of the three lines and preparing results for the printer was $1.53 per mile ( = f,o.95 per kilometre). The total average cost of leveling in 1899 for both field and Office work, of which the outcome was manuscript ready for the printer, was$15.08 per mile(= $9.37 per kilometre).

It was decided in the summor of l 899 to build two new leveling instruments to be put into use in the season of 1900. No steps were taken toward constructing the new instruments and not even toward designing them until January, 1900, because it was desirable to wait until the computation of the 1899 leveling was nearly completed, in order that the experience gained in 1899 could be fully utilized in designing the new instruments. After a careful study of the 1899 leveling it seemed desirable that the new instruments should be planned with special reference to avoiding errors due to temperature changes; that the measures being differential rather than absolute a fixed level should be substituted for the striding level, and that the dimensions and power of the telescope should be increased since the evidence indicated that the major portion of the accidental errors in 1899 leveling were due to accidental errors of rod readings. The instrument was then designed by Mr. E. G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Division, in accordance with these ideas and at the date of this writing is being constructed. The opportunity was also utilized to introduce into these instruments many improvements which are the result of the long experience of the designer. The distinguishing peculiarities of the new instrument are that it stands low on the tripod head, being much lower than the old instrument, though its telescope is larger and longer; the level vial is fixed relatively to the telescope and is placed as near as possible to the line of collimation, being in fact countersunk into the barrel of the telescope; the telescope does not rest in wyes, but instead is supported by trunnions in front of the middle point and by a micrometer screw near its eye end; and the middle half of the telescope including the level vial is completely shielded by an outer metallic tube within which it is free to move as constrained by its trunnions and the micrometer screw. The nickel-iron alloy has been used almost entirely in the construction of the telescope and adjacent parts.

GENERAL REPORT UPON THE MAGNETIC SURVEY OF NORTH CAROLINA, WITH A BRIEF HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PHENOMENA OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETISM.
INTRODUCTION. A magnetic survey was conducted during the spring, summer, and fall of 1898 and 1899, under the joint auspices of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey and the North Carolina Geological Survey. The three magnetic elements, declination, inclination, and horizontal intensity, were determined at each station. True north and south lines were located at the various county towns, and standards of length for testing surveyors' chains were marked at some convenient place in the court-house. At the instance of the State geologist of North Carolina, the Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey detailed an officer with the necessary instrumental outfit to carry out the survey, his excellency the governor of the State having requested this detail. The State geologist furnished, during 1898, all the funds required for the field work other than the salary of the officer engaged in making the survey. During the spring and summer and part of the fall of 1899, both the salary and board of the observer were paid by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, funds for all other field expenses having been furnished by the State geologist. · Wherever the honorable board of county commissioners could be induced to do so, the State geologist has obtained from each county the State's share in the field expenses of the work. Many of the counties have refunded the money advanced by the State geological survey for this work, amounting to not over $25 for any county. The State geologist of North Carolina, Prof. J. A. Holmes, at all times and in all seasons has labored for the successful completion of the survey. Through his untiring energy and interest, counties were in.duced to make subscriptions.' Valuable assistance was rendered by county commissioners, registers of deeds, surveyors, and others in the selection of suitable locations for the meridian stones at the various county towns. Wherever the local surroundings permitted it, these meridian stones were placed in the court-house square, and in every case, with one single exception, they were located on public property.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)9.

Time signals, wherever practicable, were obtained from the Western Union Telegraph Company at noon, seventy-fifth meridian time. To all those who have aided in the furtherance of the object of this survey, the observer wishes herewith to make suitable acknowledgment. This preliminary report will be devoted exclusively to the consideration of one of the elements of the Earth's magnetism, the declination, or, as surveyors frequently call it, the variation of the compass, and especially to its application to land surveys. The utility of true meridian lines when established and permanently marked, how they should be used by land surveyors, etc., will be explained. The Division of Terrestrial Magnetism of the United States Coast and Geodetic Sur,·ey has projected upon the map of North Carolina the '' isogonic lines,'' or lines of equal magnetic declination (variation), giving the most probable positions for these lines for January r, 1900, as derived from observations made at the county towns during the progress of the magnetic survey, and embodying with them other observations made with the same class of instruments near the boundary lines of adjoining States. Tables have also been prepared by this Division giving the most probable magnetic declination (variation) at the county seats for every ten years between r 750 and 19 ro. These quantities will be given for the surveyor's convenience in degrees and minutes. The prime object of this preliminary report will be to furnish a short manual for the use and c01wenience of land surveyors in North Carolina. As an introduction to the report some account, therefore, of the leading phenomena of the Earth's magnetism, when and hy whom discovered, will not be out of place. Mr. L. A. Bauer, in his" First Report Upon Magnetic Work in Maryland," has fully explained the purposes of magnetic surveys, and in connection with it has published an historical account of the fundamental facts bearing on the Earth's magnetism. It is proposed to embody in this short manual some of the most interesting features of his report. The respective authorship of the various chapters is as follows: Mr. Daniel L. Hazard has prepared the two chapters on ''The Secular Variation of the Magnetic Declination of North Carolina'' and on ''The Distribution of the Magnetic Declination in North Carolina for 1900," while Mr. James B. Baylor has prepared the remaining chapters. Mr. Hazard has furthermore revised all of the observers' computations and has prepared the results for final publication, and has constructed with their aid the lines of equal magnetic declination given on Plates I and III. HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PHENOMENA OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETISM.
Tm,; MAGNETIC DECLINATION (VARIATION OF COMPASS).

There are few places on the Earth's surface where the magnetic needle points true north. Where it does point north, at any particular time (year, day, hour, or even minute), it will not long remain in this direction. "As true as the needle to the pole" is a false simile of speech, and does much to mislead the uninitiated. In the United States proper the needle changes its relationship to the true north from 2 r degrees west of north, in the eastern part of Maine, to 23 degrees east of north, in the extreme northwestern part of Washington. In North Carolina the needle changes

its direction from 4 degrees west of north in the extreme eastern part of the State to 2 degrees east of north in the extreme western part of the State. There are places on the Earth's surface where the needle, far from being ''true to the pole,'' points due east and west. Again there are other places between the magnetic north pole and the true north pole where the '' north'' end of the needle actually points soutlt. The magnetic declination or variation of compass may be defined as ''the angle between the true north and south line and the magnetic north and south line as pointed out by a compass needle, i. e., a magnetized needle so mounted as to swing freely about a vertical axis.'' After the introduction of the compass in Europe it was several centuries before it was discovered that the needle was not ''true to the pole.'' This, Mr. Bauer believes, was probably due to the fact that the deviation of the needle from the north, according to his investigations, appears to have been small at that time in the ::VIediterranean Sea. It was Columbus on his famous voyage of discovery who first found out that the compass neecile had a "variation or declination" from the true north. On September lJ, 1492, Columbus appears to have crossed the line of no magnetic declination, or variation, situated at that time a little west of Fayal Island of the Azores. Before this time his compass had pointed east of north, but subsequently it bore west of north and by an ever increasing amount as he sailed westward. The discovery of Columbus that the magnetic needle had a declination, or ''variation,'' was not generally accepted until the middle of the sixteenth century, the declination of the compass being generally believed to be due to mechanical defects of the compass itself. And so the compass cards of that time were frequently roughly corrected for the amount of magnetic declination. The earliest land observations of the declination of the needle were made in the early part of the sixteenth century at Rome by George Hartmann, vicar of Nuren\burg. In the year 1600 Dr. William Gilbert, of Colchester, physician-in-ordinary to Queen Elizabeth, published his great treatise on magnetism, '' De Magnete. '' He first announced that ''The terrestrial globe itself is a great magnet.'' To-day all that can be said is that the globe itself acts as a magnet. We can not say with certainty whether the Earth's magnetism is p~rmanent, like that of a bar magnet, or is induced by currents of electricity.
SliCULAR VARIATION QF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

It was left for a professor of mathematics, Henry Gellibrand, of Gresham College, England, to discover that the needle did not continue to have the same direction at the same place year after year, but that it changed its· direction with the lapse of time. The observations upon which this discovery was based were made at Deptford, near London, in 1634. Gellibrand found that the needle bore 4 ° 6' east, while Gunter in 1622 had found 5° 56' east, and Boroughs in 1580 u 0 15' east. There was, therefore, no mistaking the fact that the needle was changing its direction from year to year. This progressive change of the compass needle froni year to year is known as the ''secular variation of the magnetic declination.'' It is called secular for the reason that it may require several hundred years before the needle returns approximately to the same position it had occupied at some previous time. At London, England, for example, the needle varied from II 0 east in I.'i8o to nearly 25° west in 1812, a change of 36° in two hundred and thirty-two years. It now points about 17° west at London.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT,

1898-99.

While this secular change has not been so great for places in the United States, still in the central portion of North Carolina it amounts to a change of about 47J 0 between the beginning and the end of the nineteenth century. (See p. 906.) The cause of this secular variation can no more be positively announced at the present time than when Professor Gellibrand first made his discovery in the sixteenth century. The fact that the magnetic declination is subject to this variation, as is evident, has a most important bearing upon all directions obtained with a magnetic needle, whether observed at sea or on land. The directions of most land boundaries have been recorded from the earliest days in this country by the compass needle. On account of its practical bearing, many observations have been taken at various places to determine both the declination of the needle and its secular change. This country is peculiarly rich in data for determining the amount of secular change in the magnetic declination since 1700. Magnetic observations are being collected and published as never before. The declination may be called the first element of the Earth's magnetism.
THE
MAGNETI~ INCLINATION

(DIP).

When a magnetic needle is permitted to swing freely in a vertical plane, it does not remain horizontal, but dips from the horizontal plane. The angle of dip is smallest wh~n the needle swings in the vertical plane containing the magnetic meridian and this particular angle is termed the "magnetic inclination." The dip measured in a plane at right angles to the plane of the magnetic meridian amounts to 90° , i. e., the needle stands vertical, with the north end down in our hemisphere. The dip is different in different localities and is also subject to secular change. In the surveyor's compass the dip of the magnetic needle is counteracted by a small bit of brass attached· (in the northern hemisphere) to the south end of the needle. A mathematical instrument maker, Robert Norman, of London, first definitely announced to the world, in 1576, that the magnetic needle had a dip. George Hartmann pad observed the dip of the needle as early as 1544, but he failed to accurately determine the angular amount. At what is commonly called the ''magnetic equator'' the dipping needle remains horizontal. As we advance from this so-called magnetic equator, either north or south, along a magnetic meridian, we will find that the needle dips, increasing its dip as we advance, until we reach two points on the Earth's surface, one in the northern hemisphere, the other in the southern hemisphere, where the needle will stand vertical, not only in the plane of the magnetic meridian, but in all other vertical planes. These points are commonly called the ''magnetic poles,'' a very misleading term, as they are not poles in the sense of those of a bar magnet, but are simply places on the Earth's surface where the direction assumed by the dipping needle coincides with that of the plumb line and to which the compass needle points. So far only two such points are known to us; here the compass needl~ may point in any direction, from o 0 to 360°. While only two '' magnetic poles'' are known to us, there are four foci of maximum magnetic force (intensity), two in the northern and two in the southern hemisphere, none of which coincide with the magnetic poles. The Earth is not homogeneously magnetized, hence the so-called magnetic poles do not lie diametrically opposite to each other, and the lines of equal declination (isogonic lines) are not straight lines leading to the ".magnetic poles," but far from it. Knowing both the magnetic declination and the dip at

895

any given place, we know the d£rection in which the Earth's magnetism acts at that place. The dip may be called the second of the elements of the Earth's magnetism.
THE INTENSITY OF THS EARTH'S MAGNETIC FORCE.

There remains now but one more element of the Earth's magnetism to be considered, the intensity of the attractive force which the Earth, as a magnet, exerts on a magnetic needle. This may be called the third element of the Earth's magnetism. William Whiston, the famous translator of Josephus, made the first observations on the intensity of the Earth's magnetism. A prize offered about 1720 for the best method of determining the longitude at sea first turned Whiston's attention to terrestrial magnetism, and led to his making observations which greatly increased our knowledge of the Earth's magnetism of that day. Whiston only determined the relative intensity of the Earth's magnetism, i.e., he ascertained how much stronger the force was at other places than at London. It was left for Gauss to determine absolutely the intensity of the Earth's magnetism and to establish the necessary formulre. The absolute horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetism is now determined, in a magnetic survey like that of North Carolina, by vibrating a magnet of certain weight, figure, and distribution of magnetism, and then by determining the effect of this magnet upon another magnet suspended in its place, at certain fixed distances. Knowing the horizontal intensity and dip, we can then determine, by calculation, the vertical force and total force of the Earth's magnetism.
Tm~ DIURNAL VARIATION OF THE EARTH'S MAGNETISM.

In 1722 another London instrument maker, Graham, made an important discovery in terrestrial magnetism, viz, that the needle has a daily change as well as an annual and secular change. This applies to the declination, dip, and force (intensity) of the Earth's magnetism. The precise cause of these daily changes can not be positively given. \Ve know that the Sun plays an important part.
THE ELEMENTS INVOLVED IN MAGNETIC SURVSYS.

No magnetic survey is complete without having determined, at each place where observations are made, the three elements-declination, dip, and intensity. At every station in North Carolina all three elements have been obtained, and they will all be ultimately published. Every civilized country in the world is now having some such surveys made. Thus only can we expect to increase our knowledge of the magnetism of the Earth and hope to know the causes of some of the remarkable phenomena of the Earth's magnetism above described, and which Helmholtz has well said are the most puzzling of natural phenomena.
MAGNETISM AND QEOLOGY.

Aside from any irregularity in the form of the lines of equal magnetic declination due· to the heterogeneous condition of the earth's magnetism, there are other marked irregularities in the form and location of these lines, due to the geological formations. of the places where observations are made.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898--99.

There may be a direct relationship between geology and terrestrial magnetism. Unexpected and marked magnetic deflections, at any particular place, where the surface geological strata and local surroundings do not indicate the presence of disturbing influences, lead us at once to believe there are hidden geological causes below the surface of the earth. Thus, a magnetic survey of a State may have a very importast bearing on the geological survey of the same region, and reveal the presence of substances attracting the needle and which lie some distance below the surface of the earth. Prof. A. W. Riicker, of England, in his "Recent researches on terrestrial m~gnet ism," an account of which is published in Terrestrial Magnetism for March, 1898, has traced out from the magnetic surveys of Great Britain ''ridge lines'' of concealed masses of magnetic rocks ''which are the foundations upon which the deposits studied by geologists have been laid.'' These concealed ridge lines have not only been located by magnetic surveys in England but have been carried across the British Channel and likewise traced out by magnetic surveys in France. VvTe can safely say that in every country there is a network of these magnetic ridge lines which should be located by magnetic surveys, and that the ge<'logical conformation of the country should be studied in connection with them. On account of these ridge lines of local magnetic influence it is impossible to construct an isogonic chart upon any scale which shall cover so large an area as the State of North Carolina, and give with accuracy the exact magnetic declination (variation) in any particular locality as taken from this chart of equal magnetic declinations. The chart of Lines of Equal Magnetic Declination can give but an approximation to the true variation of the compass at any given place and for any specified time. 'fhe greater the number of stations where observations have been made the more closely can the surveyor be furnished with the true variation of his compass. Where any of the county meridian lines, as located in this survey, are so situated as to be surrounded by ridge lines of marked local influence quite different from the magnetic conditions in other sections of the county, they still can be made extremely useful to the county surveyor, as will be explained later. GENERAL ACCOUNT OF THE MAGNETIC SURVEY OF NORTH CAROLINA.
MAGNETIC INSTRUMENTS.

The Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Dr. Henry S. Pritchett, having detailed Mr. James B. Baylor, Assistant of the Survey, to carry out the magnetic work in North Carolina, put the following instrumental outfit at his disposal: Theodolite and magnetometer, No. 20, and stand; Dip circle, No. 5676; , Mean-time chronometer, No. 1507; Magnetic tent; Fifty-foot steel tape (standardized), No. 218. A short description of these instruments will not be out of place. In the accompanying plate (No. 2) are shown the magnetic instruments used in the work. The meantime chronometer used in connection with the astronomical (Sun) observations, and also in determining the rapidity with which a collimator magnet vibrated at a given place, is not shown in the plate. The time of one complete vibration of the magnet is necessary,

as we have alr~ady seen, for determining the horizontal force (int~nsity) of the Earth's magnetism. The magnetometer is a combination instrument-magnetometer and theodolite combined. It was constructed at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office, and answered all purposes admirably in the magnetic survey. The theodolite, with its prism~tic eyepiece, just as it was used in the Sun (astronomical) observations for determining the true meridian, is shown on the right of the magnetometer. A specimen of these observations, with the accompanying computations, wjll be given in this chapter. The magnetometer proper, ready for determining the magnetic declination, is shown on the left of the theodolite. The collimator magnet used with this magnetometer is an octagonal, hollow steel bar about 3 inches long and nearly one-half inch in diameter.· It is used in the place of the magnetic needle in the surveyor's compass. Instead of haying a needle swinging on a pivot with friction, we have here a magnet suspended in mid-air by one or two delicate silk fibers and swinging in a horizontal plane with all friction practically eliminated. These fibers are hung in the glass tube above the box in which the magnet swings. In the plate (No. 2, Fig. 1) one side of the box is removed, so as to reveal the magnet. At the lower end the silk fibers are tied to a copper stirrup made to fit the collimator magnet. At the upper end they are fastened to an adjustable torsion head, permitting the raising and the lowering of the magnet to the proper height. The torsion of the silk fibers is eliminated by first using a copper bar of the same w~ight and figure as the collimator magnet and turning the torsion head until this nonmagnetic copper bar remain<; parallel to the sides of the box, when the telescope points in the direction of the magnetic meridian. The effect of dip, removed in the ordinary surveyor's compass by a bit of brass attached to the arm of the needle, is here counteracted by causing the point of suspension to be considerably raised above the center of gravity of the magnet, so that it swings practically in a horizontal plane. When observing the magnetic declination, the observer stands north of the instrument and looks south through the small telescope and hollow magnet and takes his reading on a scale etched on the glass closing the south end of the magnet. This scale is divided into 60 equal parts, each part representing an angle of 2 minutes. One-tenth of a space can be estimated, thus enabling pointings to one-fifth of a minute being made. On the north end of the magnet is a small lens, so shaped as to bring the scale into the focus of the small observing telescope when the latter has been focused on a distant reference mark. The telescope is mounted eccentrically and is provided with collimation and wye adjustments and a striding level. The box in which the magnet ·swings is centered over the vertical axis of the horizontal circle of the magnetometer. The azimuth, or reference mark, can be seen with the telescope through this box before the magnet is raised into position by turning aside the glass window which covers the small round hole in the end of the box farthest from the end of the telescope. A dark hood is fastened to the other end of the box, fitting tightly over the telescope tube and shutting out all air currents. The magnetic axis of the collimator magnet and the central line of the scale can not be made to accurately correspond. And if the mechanician did succeed in securing S. Doc. 454--57

exact coincidence, it would not remain so on account of the inevitable j~rrings and loss of magnetism to which the magnet is subjected in the course of the work. It thus becomes necessary to determine the correction, due to the fact that the geometric axis and the magnetic axis of the magnet do not coincide. The reading of the magnetic axis 01i the scale of the collimator magnet can be determined at. any time by simply inverting the magnet in its stirrup, reading the scale in the direct and in the inverted position, and combining the results to a meat~. To the scale reading of the magnetic axis thus obtained, all observations for magnetic declination are reduced. As intimated, the scale reading of the magnetic axis changes from time to time, as the magnet itself changes its magnetic conditions. In its frequent and accurate determination, we have a means of eliminating an error that can not be removed in determining a magnetic declination with the ordinary surveyor's compass. The small tube shown on the right .of the glass tube containing the suspension fibres is a centigrade thermometer for noting the temperature of the inside of the box, to be used in computing the observations for horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetism. The upper part of the magnetometer, bearing the box and its telescope, can be removed from the horizontal circle, to which it is attached by two screws, and the upper part of the theodolite, bearing the vertical circle, can then be quickly fastened in its· place. This theodolite was used in determining the true astronomical directions, the local mean time, and latitude, the Sun being used for this purpose. Its horizontal circle is 11·2 centimetres (4·4 inches) in diameter and its vertical circle 9·8 centimetres (3"86 inches) in diameter. .Each circle .is graduated to half degrees and read by opposite verniers to minutes of arc. The horizontal circle is graduated, in the direction of the motion of the hands of a. watch, from o 0 to 360°, while the vertical circle is graduated, in the opposite direction and from o 0 to 90°, in each quadrant, giving in one direction the altitude of an object and in the reversed position the zenith distance of the object, thus making it possible to eliminate all index errors of the vertical circle when the telescope is reversed. In the intensity observations, the collimator magnet, above described, is used to deflect, at fixed distances, another collimator magnet suspended in the stirrup in its place. Wooden arms are inserted under the box of the magnetometer, with riders supporting the deflecting magnet at the same height as the suspended (auxiliary) magnet. On the extreme right of this same plate (No. 2, Fig. 2) we have an illustration of the instrument used in determining the magnetic inclination or dip. This instrument is of the Kew pattern. The magnetic needles which go with it are 3_% inc;hes long, fiat, and taper to points. These needles are so mounted as to swing freely iii a vertical plane, and their pivots rest on agate planes carefully ground and which can be acc.urately leveled. The needle, when in position, is inclosed in a glass case to shut out the currents of air, and the instrument is provided with a lifter for raising the needle off the agates and letting it down before observing. There is a vertical circle for reading the angle of the dip. The pointings on the needle are made with the two microscopes. The box and vertical circle can be turned in azimuth and set in the vertical plane of the magnetic meridian by means of the h.ori-

zontal circle. The circles of this instrument are about 5 inches in diameter. The vertical circle is provided with two opposite verniers reading to minutes of arc, and the horizontal circle is read with the vernier to minutes of arc. With the dip circle are two ''bar magnets'' used in reversing the polarities of the dipping needles. We can thus, by combining to a mean, eliminate any error due to the fact that the center of gravity of the needle may not lie quite in the aXis of suspension of the needle.

OBSERVATIONS FOR LATITUD:E.

To determine the latitude of a place, the Sun's altitude was measured at intervals of a minute for a short time before and after apparent noon. The Sun's upper limb with telescope direct and lower limb with telescope reversed were observed alternately, the reading of the vertical circle giving zenith distance in the latter case. The theodolite was carefully leveled and adjusted.

FIELD COMPUTATION OF LATITUDE.

For the purposes of the field computation we may assume that the Sun reaches its maximum altitude at apparent noon. This maximum altitude, corrected for parallax in altitude and atmospheric refraction, is combined with the Sun's declination at the same time to find the latitude of the place. The Sun's declination is taken from the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac.

In the Office at Washington a more elaborate method of computation is employed, use being made of all of the -observations, instead of simply the maximum altitude, as was done above.
OBSERVATIONS FOR DETERMINING '.rHE TRUE NORTH AND SOUTH UNE.

Below are specimens of observations for· ascertaining the true north and south line or azimuth of the ''mark'' or range from which the true meridian is laid off. The theodolite is carefully adjusted and centered over the ''reference monument.'' The altitude or zenith distance of the Sun and its bearing with reference to the range or mark, and the time by chronometer are observed simultaneously. This is done when the Sun is at least 2 Yz hours from apparent noon; so that both the altitude and azimuth of the Sun are changing with sufficient rapidity. Four independent sets of observations are taken; two in the morning and two in the afternoon. The same sets pf observations also give the approximate longitude of the place. From the apparent time of observation the local mean time is found by applying the ''equation of time'' as taken from the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac. The difference between the chronometer time of observation and the local mean time thus found gives the correction of the chronometer on local mean time. Its correction on seventy-fifth meridian time is found by means of Western Union Telegraph Company time signals received at I 2 o'clock. The difference between these two corrections, converted into arc (I minute of time equals I 5 minutes of arc) gives the difference of longitude from the seventy-fifth meridian.

A small observing tent is pitched over the point of observation to protect the instrument and the observer from the wind and weather. 'theodolite No. 20 is converted into magnetometer No. 20, as already described iu this report. Magnetometer No. 20 is carefully adjusted and leveled over the reference monument. The ''mark'' selected in the Sun observations, is pointed on through the little box in which the collimator magnet will swing. As an additional check pointings are also made on the center of the range monument which is in the true meridian. '!'he horizontal circle is read and recorded in eac~1 case. '!'he instrument is then turned around its vertical axis until the sides of the box are approximately parallel to the magnetic (compass) meridian and the telescope points south (magnetic). The copper weight is then inserted in the stirrup and the torsion of the silk fibers carefully eliminated in a manner as already described. '!'he long collimator magnet (L 20) is then used to replace the copper weight. '!'his magnet is so delicately suspended that it is never entirely at rest and has to be brought approximately to rest with a knife blade or a small bit of iron, which is then removed. 'the instrmnent is then turned about its vertical axis until the middle division of the scale of the magnet oscillates equally to right and left of the vertical line on the diaphragm of the telescope. '!'he horizontal circle is then clamped and read. Then at intervals of five or ten minutes the scale readings of the magnet at the extremities of a swing are recorded with the corresponding times.

enough (about au hour) to enable us to observe the eastern elongation of the needle, i. e., when the north end of the needle points nearest to the East during the day. This takes place somewhere between 7. 30 a. m. and 9 a. m., local mean time, the precise time varying with the season of the year and with meteorological conditions. The observations are begun again in the afternoon in time to include the western elongation, i. e., the time when the north end of the needle points its nearest to the West during the day. This usually takes place between 1 and 2 p. m., local mean time, the precise time varying as before with the season of the year and with the meteorological conditions. The mean of these two extreme positions of the needle is taken as the average position for the day. This method of obtaining the average value for the day, sufficing for all practical purposes, must at present be employed in regions where there are no magnetic observatories in operation. The magnetic axis of the magnet is determined by inverting the magnet in the stirrup, as already described. The horizontal circle is carefully read and the torsion tested from time to time.

THE VARIATIONS OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION. As already stated, the pointing of the compass needle is forever changing. The term ''variations'' will be used hereafter exclusively to denote the changes which take place in the value of the magnetic declination. Surveyors would do well were they likewise to use the word "variation" only·in this sense, for they have, unfortunately, fallen into the habit of using the term ''variation'' in two different senses, first, to denote the quantity by which the compass points away from the true north-i. e., the

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, r898-<J9.

magnetic declination; secondly, to denote the amount ef c!iange in the magnetic declination for a certain period of years. This has given rise to considerable confusion in land surveys. The Division of Terrestrial Magnetism of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey has difficulty at times in properly interpreting letters from surveyors regarding the '' magnetic variation. '' The chief variations of the magnetic declination concerning the sui-Veyor may be classified as." the secular variation," "the daily or the diurnal variation," and the disturbance variation, due to magnetic storms. · . It will be the special purpose of this chapter to show in a practical way the effect of these variations on land surveys in North Carolina made with a compass needle, and to furnish tables which may be useful to the surveyor in eliminating some of these errors.
THE SECULAR VARIATION.

In the last one hundred years the compass needle has changed its relationship to the north line in the central portion of North Carolina about 4 J-1° of arc. This means that in the central portion of North 8arolina a surveyor starting from the same corner used in 1800, and retracing at the present time (1900) a line, say, 1 mile long, between two contiguous properties, using the compass bearing of x8oo, the corner at the other end of the line would be shifted 399 feet from its original position. During the last ten years the compass needle has changed its direction on au average i.n North Carolina about 3' of arc each year. If this quantity is not taken into account it causes an error in the mile line of 4 "6 feet for each year. Not knowing the causes which operate to produce the secular variation, we can not predict with certainty the amount of these changes. , A surveyor in North Carolina, by making use of the county meridians, as he is required by law to do, should determine for himself the amount of the secular change, and not be guided in the future solely by the changes in the compass bearings of old lines when they are retraced. The original bearing of an old line and the date of the survey may have been recorded wrong; the ends of the line as recovered may be in error and thus an erroneous value of the amount of change in the magnetic declination obtained. Judge J. W. Bowman, of Mitchell County, N. C., in retracing numerous old lines estimates that in the last one hundred years the north end of the compass needle has moved westward just about 5° in Mitchell County, N. C. Prof. William Cain, of the North Carolina State Univerity, from. observations made in the vicinity of Chapel Hill, Orange County, N. C., estimates that the north end of the compass needle moved westward 2° 54' between 1852 and 1895. Tables giving the amount of change in declination between any two years between 1750 and 1910, for the various county seats, are given in the special chapter on this very important subject.

T:a:E

DIURNAL VARIATION.

A magnetic needle which swings freely in a horizontal plane changes its bearing from hour to ·hour. The range of this daily change is quite different in different months in the same year. It is greater in the Summer than in the \Vinter. In the month of August the north end of the needle will point in North Carolina at 8 a. m. as much as 1o' of arc, on the average, nearer the east than it does at 1 p. m.

APPENDIX NO. 9.

MAGNETIC SURVEY OF NORTH CAROLINA.

907

This means that in a mile line traced out with compass in August at 8 a. m. and retraced at l p. m. on the same day, there would. be a difference in the location of a corner of 15'3 feet. The following table gives the correction to an observed magnetic declination for diurnal variation for every month and for every hour from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. The time given in this table is local mean time. Everywhere in North Carolina the local time for any place is slow on the time used. A surveyor in using this tabl.e should correct the railroad time to local time. For every degree of longitude he is west of the seventy-fifth meridian he should substract four minutes of time from the railroad time. The table should then be entered with the time as corrected.

THE DISTURBANCE VARIATION IN THE MAGNETIC DECUNATION. (MAGNETIC STORMS.)

There are variations in the direction of the compass needle due to spasmodic :fluctuations in the Earth's magnetism. During the prevalence of these abnormal conditions the compass needle is occasionally in error as much as one-fourth of a degree and· sometimes even thore. Magnetic storms are more frequent in the Summer than in the Winter. Fortunately about 75 to 90 per cent of the disturbances produced by magnetic storms are very small, and occur at times when they will not appreciably affect the surveyor's work.
MINOR PERIODIC FLUCTUATIONS.

There are other changes affecting the value of the magnetic declination than those already mentioned, which are known as ''minor periodic fluctuations.'' These depend upon the declination of the Sun, upon· its period of rotation, and upon the position of the Moon with reference to the Sun and Earth. These changes are too minute to be noted by the surveyor.

1898--99.

SECULAR VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN NORTH CAROLINA. While we can not say that the secular motion of the magnetic needle is strictly periodic, i. e., that after a certain long period of years the needle will return to the same position and exactly retrace the course it had previously followed, yet it has been shown by the investigations of Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and others, that the secular variation of the magnetic declination for the past two hundred years may be reP.resented very closely by an algebraic expression based on the assumption of such a periodic motion. The observations at a great many stations in the United States have been treated in this way by Mr. Schott, and the latest results are published in Appendix I of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1895. The only place in North Carolina where we have a sufficient number of observations to warrant a discussion of the secular.variation of the magnetic declination is Newbern, and even there our results only go back to 1750. We may, however, supplement the data at Newbern by the observations at Cape Henry, Virginia, and Charleston, S. C. At each of these stations the observations cover the period from 1700 to 1895. The individual values of declination for each of these three places are given below, together with the secular-variation expression derived therefrom, and a comparison of the declinations computed from the formula with the observed quantities. The addition of Mr. Baylor's ob;ervation at Newbern in 1898 necessitated a new discussion for that station. With this exception the material is taken directly from the above-mentioned Appendix, pages 227-230.

We have, then, the three expressions: For Cape Henry, Va., D=+2°·42+2°·25 sin (1°·47 m -30°'6). For Newbern, N. C., D=+o 0 ·54+2°·64 sin (1°·45 m -16°'1). For Charleston, S. C., D=-1°·s2+2°·75 sin (1°·40 m -12°'1). In these formulre the plus sign indicates west declination, the minus sign east declination. The first term of the second member represents the average value of the declination during an entire period. The constant multiplier of the second term is one-half the range in declination. Accordingly, for Cape Henry the maximum declination would be 2°·42 + 2°·25 = +4°'67, or 4° 4o' west, and the minimum declination 2°·42 - 2°·25 = + 0°·r7, or o 0 lo' west. It will be noticed that the three expressions agree in their general characteristics, though differing in detail. Of course the first term varies with the distribution of declination, but the ~ariation in the second term may be due more to imperfect data than to differing conditions. Accordingly, an expression derived by taking the mean of the three will be used for the eastern part of North Carolina in preference to the

expression for Newbern. It isD=x+2°·55 sin (1°·44m- 19°·6) inwhichxisfound for any place by means of the observed declination. It is known that the phases of secular variation of declination occur, in general, later as we go west. From a comparison of the secular variation discussion for stations in various longitudes, it is estimated that the phases would occur ten years later in the western part of North Carolina than in the eastern.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.
SECULAR VARIATION TABLE FOR 'l'l!E CouxTY SEA'rs.

The manner in which the table was constructed will be readily understood from the followfo.g remarks: To derive a secular variation table for a particular station, find by interpolation from the proper column of the foregoing table the value for the date of observation. The difference between that quantity and the observed declination must then be applied as a constant correction to that column. For example, the declination observed at Chapel Hill, March 25, 26, 1898, was +1° 28 1 ·6. The value for that date from Column II of the table is+r 0 50'·2. Hence the quantities in that column must bedimiuishecl (algebraically) by 22' to be applicable to Chapel Hill. As before stated, a plus sign indicates west declination, a minus sign east declination. In this way the quantities in the following table have been derived for each place where a meridian line was established and magnetic observations made. The arrangement of the columns is alphabetically by counties. For the county seats where meridian lines have not yet been established and where magnetic observations h~ve not yet been made- indicated in the table by an asterisk (*) - estimated values of the magnetic declination for January r, r 900, as derived from observations in the vicinity of the county seats, were utilized in the construction of the respective columns. Whatever errors these estimated values may be subject to will not affect the use of the columns for determining the change in the magnetic declination between any two periods of time, as all of the quantities in a particular column will be affected by the same error. As soon as magnetic observations have been' made at the remaining county seats, surveyors, by applying to the Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, can obtain the precise corrections to the estimated values referred to above.
EXAJ\IPLI<: OF THE l'RAC'rICAl, APPLICATION OF THI·; 'l'ABLE.

The following table will be of special value in finding the change in the magnetic declination at any place in the county. Suppose it were desired to retrace in May, x900, a boundary line in Wake County, which bore magnetically N. 76° E. in July, 1813. From the table for Raleigh we find that the magnetic declination was r 0 53' east in 1813 and 2° 30' west for the later date. Consequently the change in the interval is 4° 23' to the westward, and a line which bore N. 76° E. in 1813should be reruniu May, 1900, with the magetic bearing N. 80° 23' E. Our information regarding the distribution of declination in the United States in the eighteenth century is so uncertain, owing to the small amount of data available and the inferior instruments then in use, that the portions of our secular variation tables covering that period may be in error by as much as half a degree, and an uncertainty of a quarter of a degree may be assigned·to the values for the early part of the nineteenth century. These facts should be borne in mind when using the tables,

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN NORTH CAROLINA FOR THE YEAR 1900. By the term '' distribution of the magnetic declination'' is meant the geographic distribution, i. e., the relation which the declination at a station bears to its geographic location. It is usually shown by means of a chart on which lines are drawn through all places having the same declination. This is called an "isogonic chart," and the lines '' isogonic lines,'' or ''lines of equal magnetic declination.'' As it seldom happens, however, that there are many stations having exactly the same declination, in practice the lines are drawn to represent declinations differing successively by equal amounts-as, for example, by one degree. We have seen· that the declination varies from year to year, so that such a chart must be constructed from observations referring to the same epoch and applies only to that particular time. In general, the observations of a magnetic survey extend over a period of years, but they may be reduced to the same epoch by means of a knowledge of the secular variation of the declination. In the case of North Carolina the lst of January, 1900, has been selected as the epoch for the isogonic chart, being the same as the latest isogonic charts for the United States and for other countries. By means of the secular variation tables (No. II) given in the preceding chapter all the available observations in North Carolina and parts of the adjoining States have been reduced to that epoch. These reduced values were then plotted on a map (Pl. I, frontispiece) of the State and the isogonic lines drawn in free hand for whole degrees of declination,

conforming as well as possible to the irregularities of distribution, though the stations are not sufficiently numerous to do so except in a general way. The distn"bution ef tlie magnetic declination in North Carolina is so irregular that but little dependence can be placed on the isogonic chart as a substitute for actual observat£ons. A comparison of the observed declinations with corresponding values scaled from the isogonic chart shows that a difference of half a degree is not unusual, and that as much as one degree is reached in several cases, while for Concord, Cabarrus County, the observed declination differs about two degrees from what the surrounding stations would lead us to expect. The observations are too widely distributed to enable us to decide whether these differences are due to causes extending over large areas or to purely local disturbances, and it has therefore been deemed inexpedient to attempt more than a representation of the general features of the distribution. It will be noticed that the quantities as actually derived by observation and reduced to January l, 1900, are given on the isogonic chart. In the following tables the stations are arranged alphabetically by counties. The first table contains the observations made by Mr. J. B. Baylor, Assistant, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in connection with the North Carolina Geological Survey. In the last column is indicated by the letter N. or S. whether observations were made over the north or south meridian monument. The col~mns headed '' D observed'' and "D l 900 " contain, respectively, the observed declination and the same reduced to January l, 1900. The declinations as published in this table are the means of the two extreme positions of the needle during the day. The mean of these two extreme positions corresponds, for all practical purposes, with the average direction of a compass during the day. The remaining tables contain declinations observed and collected from various sources by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The general arrangement is the same, but here the date of observation is given to the nearest tenth of a year and the name of the observer or authority is given in the last column. The letters B. F. refer to observations made at the charge of the "Bache fund" of the National Academy of Sciences. In regard to the latitudes and longitudes given in the tables, it should be home in mind that they are only intended for use 'in computing the azimuth observations and in locating the stations on the map. As the azimuth observations are made in every case at nearly equal times before and after noon, the effect on the azimuth of a small error in latitude is nearly eliminated in the mean. It is thought that none of the latitudes and longitudes are in error by more than two minutes of arc and few by more than one minute. For the stations along the coast they are derived from the charts of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In the interior a few are scaled from the maps of the United States Geological Survey and tli,e remainder are computed from the Sun observations checked by the State maps of Rand, McNally & Co. and North Carolina Geological Survey.
THE SECULAR MOTIO:-< OF THE AGONIC LINE OVER NORTH CAROLINA.

The agonic line, or line of no declination, has always been of special interest to users of the compass, as it indicates those places where the needle points true north. A study of the county tables in the pre~eding chapter shows that the agonic line passed near Newbern, Greenville, and Warrenton in 1750 and moved steadily eastward until

about 1800, when it reached its extreme easterly position, a short distance off Cape Hatteras. Since that time its motion has been westward, until it has now almost reached the western boundary. The following table gives its approximate location at different dates:

By glancing at Plate No. III the surveyor can get an idea of the approximate distributions of the magnetic declination for the three years 1750, 1800, and 1850. Thus in l 750 the magnetic declination was west of north for the extreme northeastern part of the State and east over the remainder. For the year r8oo, however, the declination appears to have been east over the entire State, and for 1850 the distribution was about the same as the year 1750. For.1900 the declination is east for onlytheextremesouthwestern portion of the State, being now west over almost the entire State. It is thus seen bow comparatively rapid the whole aspect of the distribution of the magnetic declination is changed over North Carolina. ·

DIRECTIONS TO SURVEYORS CONCERNING THE USE OF THE COUNTY MERIDIAN LINES. The following directions to surveyors concerning the use of 'the county meridian lines either for determining the magnetic declination or for ascertaining the index errors of their instruments should be followed. If the instrument used be mounted on a tripod, it should be carefully centered and leveled over the cross on top of the same monument-the ''reference'' monumentover which observations were made in the magnetic survey and described in the descriptions of stations as published in this report. The monument to be sighted on is termed the '' range'' monument. Should the instrument used be mounted on a simple Jacob's staff, it can be placed in the meridian line as close to the "reference" monument as possible and leveled. A small rod should then be held in a vertical position over the cross in the top of the other monument-the ''range'' monument. The compass needle is released and magnetic bearing of the small rod read. This should be done with a small nonmagnetic magnifying glass, and it should be repeated about ten times, disturbing the needle with a bit of iron and letting it come to rest before each reading. The mean of all these bearings should be taken as the magnetic declination west or east, as the case may be. In order to obtain the mean declination for the 'day (24 hours) these results should be obtained between 10 and 10·30 a. m. or about 6 p. m. local mean time. (See Table I, page 907.) The local mean time is obtained by subtracting from the railroad time four minutes for every degree of longitude the surveyor is west of the seventy-fifth ineridian· of longitude. No observations should be made during times of violent changes of the pointing of the magnetic needle, as, e.g., during magnetic storms.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1898--99.

Should the resulting declination differ essentially from the declination as obtained from the published value in this report, it proves conclusively that the surveyor's instrument has an error, which should be gotten rid of as nearly as possible by putting the instrument and needle in good adjustment. Any difference still remaining after the surveyor has satisfied himself that his instrument is in first-class condition and in good adjustment should be duly allowed for and recorded by the surveyor. The correct declination for the next ten -years can be obtained by interpolation from Table II. According to the act of March 7, 1899, a copy of which is given below, all results for declination taken over any of these monuments should be entered in the book kept by the Register of Deeds, giving the year, the day, and the local time the observations were made, and should also be entered on surveys made at that time. (See specimen record for keeping these observations.)
AN ACT REGULATING THE USE OF AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF MERIDIAN MONUMENTS AND STANDARDS OF MEASURE AT THE SEVERAL COUNTY SEATS IN NORTH CAROLINA.-MARCH 7, 1899. Whereas Meridian monuments for determining the variations of the magnetic needle of the compass from the true north and a standard length for measuring surveyors' chains have already been established in nearly one-half of the counties of the State by the North Carolina Geological Survey and the 'united States Coast aud Geodetic Survey, cooperating with the Commissioners in the several counties, and similar provision. has been made for establishing such standards at the remaining county seats of the State during the present year; and whereas it is of great importance in the making of all surveys of boundaries of land, townships, counties, etc., that the chains, compasses, and other instruments used by surveyors should at intervals be properly tested, The General Assembly of North Carolina do enact- SECTION r. That every surveyor operating in any of the counties of this State with magnetic instruments, whether in a public or private capacity, shall, between the first day of January and the thirty-first day of December in each and every year, carefully test his needle upon the official meridian monuments in the county in which he resides, or the nearest county in which such monuments have been erected, by adjusting his instrument over the intersection of the lines cut into the top of one of the meridian monuments so established and sighting to the intersection of the lines cut into the top of the other meridian monument, noting the variation of the magnetic from the true meridian and the direction thereof, and shall test the chain or other instrument of linear measure upon the distance from center to center, as indicated by intersecting lines of the two brass tablets or other official monuments set at or near the county court-house for this purpose, noting the error of such instrument as compared with the standard of the monuments. Such tests and the corrections, if any resulting therefrom, shall be returned by the surveyor in writing and under oath to the Register of Deeds for the county in which such meridian is situate within ten days from the taking of the observations aforesaid, setting forth the name of the surveyor, his residence, the character of the instrument tested, the date of the observations, the declination east or west of the magnetic needle from the true meridian, together with a fee of ten cents for filing and recording the same; and such return shall be filed and recorded by the Register of Deeds in a book properly ruled and lettered, to be furnished by the Board of Commissioners of the county, to be used for such purpose exclusively, and entitled "The Meridian Record:" Provided, That before making surveys in any county other than the one in which the magnetic instruments and instruments for linear measure to be used have already been tested, said surveyor shall procure in writing from the Register of Deeds of the county in which said monuments have been established, nearest to the point where the survey is to be made, a statement giving the declination of the magnetic needle for the year in which it was last determined and the rate and direction of variation of said magnetic needle since that time, and this data shall be recorded as a part of the record of his survey: Provided, further, That no surveyor shall be required to go outside of the county in which he resides for the purpose of testing the instruments herein named.

Sac. 2. That it shall be the duty of the Board of County Commissioners to maintain and protect such meridian monuments and tablets or monuments for the testing of chains or other instruments of linear measure, established by the State or National surveys, cooperating with the county authorities, in good order and condition as the official standards of the county. SEC. 3. Any person or persons who shall in any manner injure, deface, remove, or destroy such monuments or tablets, or any part thereof, or who shall fail, neglect, or refuse to. do and perform any act, matter, or thing by this act required of him or them to be done, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall pay a fine or be imprisoned, or both, at the discretion of the court, for every such offense. SEC. 4. That this act shall be in force from and after its ratification.

THE MAGNETIC WORK OF THE UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
Dy L. A. BAUER, Inspector of ftlagnetic Work a11d Cliief of Division qf Terrestrial il'lag11etis111.

A.-PAST WORK.

In the "Plan for the Reorganization of the Survey of the Coast, as adopted by a Board convened on the 30th of March, 1843, by direction of the President of the United States,'' explicit provision is made for the making of ''all such magnetic obsei;vations as circumstances and the state of the annual appropriations may allow." Since then Congress, by more or less generous appropriations, has distinctly recognized the importance of this feature of the work of the Survey. Under the first Superintendent, Prof. F. R .. Hassler, the magnetic declination (''variation'') was supplied on the Coast Survey Charts, as determined with the aid of the ordinary nautical instrumental ·means then in vogue. In the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia, 1825, Professor Hassler proposed to measure re1ative magnetic intensity by means of oscillations of a needle, !JO method for absolute measurement being then known. The real magnetic work of the Survey, however, may be said to have commenced with Professor Hassler's sucq:ssor, Prof. Alexander Dallas Bache. Professor Bache had previously made a magnetic survey of Pennsylvania, which was not followed until in quite recent years by the magnetic surveys of Missouri, New Jersey, Maryland, and North Carolina. He had likewise established the first magnetic observatory in this country-that at Girard College, Philadelphia-and, while on a trip,abroad, had made a series of magnetic observations at various places. Improved magnetic instruments were now imported, and the expert aid of Dr. John Locke, of Cincinnati, and Professor Renwick, of Columbia College, was temporarily employed. The three magnetic elements-declination, dip, and intensity-were determined at various places, chiefly along the seacoast. The work of magnetic observation, thus fairly started, has since been prosecuted without interruption over the entire country, including Alaska and Hawaiian Islands, as well as in some foreign countries, by various meµibers of the Survey. The following notes are taken almost verbatim from Mr. Schott's various reports

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-99.
I. ISOGONIC CHARTS PUBLISHED BY THE SURVEY.

The first table of declination results accompanied by an isogonic chart* was published by A. D. Bache, Superintendent, and J. E. Hilgard, Assistant, in the Annual Report for 1855, Appendix No. 47, and plate No. 56. The declinations were reduced to a common epoch-185o--'-by means of assumed values of the annual change, and for convenience of discussion the declinations were arranged in geographical groups which could be !>eparately treated by application of Lloyd's interpolation formula. The table comprises 153 stations, and the isogonic curves, computed for each degree of declination, cover but a narrow strip along the coast line. In the following year the same authors produced a new chart, as the result of a more extended discussion, inclusive of all recent observations, but retained the epoch 1850. (See Annual Report of 1856, Appendix No. 28.) On plate No. 61 of the Report, the isogonic curves fairly cover the area of the eastern part of the United States, as well as the area bordering on the Pacific coast, and a connection is shown over the Gulf of Mexico and along the Mexican boundary. The Annual Report for 1861, Appendices No. 23 and No. 24, contains two small isogonic charts (plate No. 30) designed for a special purpose and in aid of navigation along the southern coast; epoch 186o. The Annual Report for 1862, Appendix No. 19, gives an account of a magnetic survey of the State of Pennsylvania, and on plate No. 47 shows isomagnetic lines laid down for the two epochs 1842 and 1862. The next isogonic chart, constructed by Assistant C. A. Schott, accompanies Appendix No. 19 of the Annual Report for 1865, plate No. 27. It is on a larger scale, but covers about the same area as the chart of 1856. It embodies, however, the results accumulated, and uses the latest information respecting the secular change. The epoch is 1870. The next chart issued, Report for 1876, Appendix No. 21, plate No. 24, is due to · Assistant J. E. Hilgard. It is referred to the epoch 1875, and includes the results of the Survey up to 1877, and in part to 1879, as well as about 200 observations made from 1871 to 1876, under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences and at the expense of the Bache fund. In this chart the isogonic curves cover the ·whole of the United States, excepting Alaska, and distinct notice is taken of certain large irregularities in the distribution of magnetism which made themselves manifest in certain regions in the eastern and central parts of the country. The curves over the western part remain smooth and regular, the observations there not yet being sufficiently numerous for the Sa.fe delineation of irregularities. "Distribution of the Magnetic Declination for 1885." This publication, brought out in the Annual Report for 1885, Appendix No. 13, by Assistant C. A. Schott, is designated by him as the ''first edition,'' on account of its completeness, a special chart for Alaska and adjacent regions being included. The arrangement of the table of results is alphabetic by States, with two subdivisions in each, one for Coast and Geodetic Survey results, the other containing the results from all remaining available sources, as
*The first detail chart extending some distance into the interior of the country was constructed by Prof. E. Loomis for the epoch 1840, and published in Silliman's Journal Science and Arts, Vol. XL.

compiled by the author; the table contains in all 2 ~59 stations. The results were reduced to the epoch I885, with the aid of Mr. Schott's extensive secular variation discussions. The curves for the United States were determined by the graphical process, and were published on a chart of scale 11~-cil.1, while ti1ose for Alaska and adjacent waters, on account of the scarity of data, were made to depend upon an interpolation formula established by the application of the method of least squares; these last curves were published on a chart, to the scale of 131 ~ 000 · As far as the accumulated material would permit, special notice was taken of all locally disturbed regions, and the extent and the amount of the local deflections were shown on the chart. ''Distribution of the Magnetic Declination for I 890. '' This is Mr. Schott's '' second edition,'' and is.contained in the Report for 1889, Appendix I I. The table of declinations comprises 3 237 stations; in all cases where a station has been repeatedly occupied, only that observation nearest to the epoch 1890 is given. The curves for the United States are again obtained by the graphical method, and those for Alaska by a newly established interpolation formula. The writer had the privilege of assisting Mr. Schott in the construction of these charts. "Distribution of the Magnetic Declination for I900." (Third edition.) The charts for the epoch 1900 are based on 3 591 tabulated declinations. They are a great improvement upon the former charts, the reductions to the epoch 1900 being based on a new and very exhaustive discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic declinatio1i at 1I8 stations, embracing I 435 annual observations. The steady improvement in the isogonic charts is made readily apparent by a comparison of the earlier ones with those of recent date. In the latter the curves are no longer beautifully curved lines, but exhibit many sinuosities, showing that the magnetic distribution, as it actually occurs in nature, is being more and more truly represented. For Alaska, on account of the paucity of the data, the distribution, as shown by the charts, must still be more or less conventional. ''Magnetic Declination Tables for the year I900i embracing the United States and Countries under its Jurisdiction, prefaced by an Historical Sketch of the Fundamental Phenomena of the Earth's Magnetism.'' This publication is now under way and. will appear in the next Annual Report. It is being prepared primarily for the use of surveyors and mariners, and will embody all of the results for magnetic declination and of its .secular variation obtained thus far, and will be accompanied by the revised isogonic charts for I900. Those interested can obtain a copy by addressing the Superintendent.
2. ISOCLINIC AND ISODYNAMIC CHARTS.

The first complete discussion of ·the dip and the intensity observations was made by Mr. Schott for the epoch I885. (See the Annual Report for 1885, Appendix No. 6.) In the general collection of data, Mr. Schott makes an attempt to bring togethe:..·, in systematic form, all observed dips and intensities within the boundaries of the country, from the earliest to the present time. The observations made at sea, being in general less accurate, are excluded from the present collection, with the exception of a few results obtained on the frozen sea ice off the coast of Alaska. The table contains I 999 results for dip and I 523 for horizontal intensity; only the most recent values, however, were used in the construction of the magnetic charts. In the table all intensities are S. Doc. 454--6o

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18<)8-99·

expressed in absolute measure and in terms of the English units-the foot, the grain, and the second of mean time. On the two accompanying maps, showing the distribution of the horizontal and total intensities, the C. G. S. units are also introduced. The discussion of the secular variation of the dip resulted in the delineation, on the isoclinic map, of a belt of "no change" for epoch 1885, with increasing dip on the one side and decreasing dip on the other. A similar feature was recognized in the discussion of the secular variation of the horizontal intensity. We have also pointed out to us the occurrence in about the year 1860, for the eastern part of the country, of a secondary maximum in the variation of the dip, as well as a minimum in the variation· of the horizontal component of the intensity. Upon the whole, the representation of the dip for the epoch 1885 was far more satisfactory than the representation of the horizontal intensity for the same epoch, the cause of this being ascribed to defective determination of the instrumental constants in the intensity observations. This discussion has been in part superseded by the more recent one for the epoch 1900. The secular variation of the dip and intensity is now discussed conjointly with that of the declination. (See Report for 1895, Appendix r.) For the I 18 secular variation stations there are tabulated and discussed l 435 declination observations (annual values), 577 dip results, and 479 horizontal intensity observations. The intensities are all expressed in C. G. S. units. The curves described by the north end of a freely suspended magnetic needle in the lapse of time are drawn for a number.of stations, and reversals in the more generally prevailing clockwise direction of motion are pointed out for certain stations along the Pacific coast. In Appendix l, Report for 1897, the distribution of the magnetic inclination and intensity is represented on three charts for the epoch January l, 1900, each to the scale of 'l'Hhoo· The first chart gives the lines of equal dip, the second those of equal horizontal force, and the third the lines of equal total force. In the table entitled ''Collection of the Most Recent Magnetic Dips and Intensities Observed in the United States and Referred to the Epoch r 900.0," results for dip and intensity are given for l 641 stations, of which l 271 are within the United States; the stations are as yet very irregularly distributed. These charts are decided improvements upon the earlier ones.
3. MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

While the Oirard College Observatory at Philadelphia, which was in operation from 1840 to 1845, did not belong distinctly to the Survey, it is not improper to include here a mention of it, since Professor Bache continued to direct its work after he assumed charge of the Survey. Mr. Schott, also, was later on employed in -the discussion of the observations. The first survey observatory was establi'shed under Professor Bache at Key West, Fla., and was carried on from 1860 to 1866. The variations of the declination and of the horizontal and vertical intensities were recorded continuously by means of photography, one of the Brooke magnetographs having been imported. After a lapse of half a sun-spot cycle, the instrument was transported to Madison, Wis., and put in operation from .1876 to 1880. The same instrument was then adapted for direct or eye observations, and transported to Point Barrow, Alaska, where, under the charge of Lieutenant Ray, magnetic records were obtained for one year-1882-83. · A superior self-recording magnetic apparatus, the Adie magnetograph, patterned

after the Kew model, recorded the magnetic variations, photographically, at Los Angeles, from 1882 to 1887. This instrument was then set up at San Antonio, Tex., in 1890, and in September, 1892, it had to be removed on account of electric car disturbances, to Hillside Ranch, near San Antonio: The observatory, unfortunately, had to be abandoned in March, 1895, on account of the smallness of the appropriations for magnetic work in that year. The computations of the records from these observatories have not as yet been completed, because of insufficient computing force in the past. Only for Los Angeles has a complete discussion been attempted.
4. MAGNETIC WORK IN THE POLAR REGIONS.

The magnetic records brought home by the polar expeditions in command of Lieutenants Ray and Greely were placed in the care of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. This material was subjected to computation and discussion and arranged for the press. The Point Barrow work ( 1881-1883) forms Part VI of the official publication of Lieutenant Ray's expedition (published in 1885), and the work done at Fort Conger ( 1881-1883), under Lieutenant, now General, Greely, fonns Appendix No. 139 of Vol. II of General Greely's official publication (1888).
B.-PRESENT AND FuTURE WORK.

For many years Mr. Schott has emphasized in his various reports the pressing need of an expansion of the Survey work in the line of terrestrial magnetism, if the Survey was to fulfill to the best advantage all the purposes for which it was created. He recognized, in the first place, that the magnetic work should form a division of its own. Hitherto, all magnetic records have been tumed over to the Computing Division of the Survey, which, owing to the great variety of its work and the insufficiency of the computing force, has been utterly unable to give the attention to the magnetic work which the subject demanded. That, notwithstanding these adverse circumstances, Mr. Schott has been able to accomplish so much in this special field is due to his untiring zeal and enthusiasm. In recognition of his contributions to terrestrial magnetism, the Paris Academy awarded him last year the Wilde Prize of 4 ooo francs; This honor, coming at the time- it did, was especially apropos, as Mr. Schott had just rounded out a full half century of usefulness in the Survey. The present superintendent, perceiving the need of expansion in magnetic work, created, as a first step, on July 1, 1899, a separate' division for magnetic work, known as the Division of Terrestrial Magnetism of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. The chief of this division, being also Inspector of Magnetic Work, has full control of all magnetic work. both in the field and in the office. The following preliminary outline will serve to give some indication of the character and scope of the work being carried out with the enlarged opportunities.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 18g8-99.
I. SECULAR VARIATION INVESTIGATIONS.

The best evidence of the great demand for secular variation data is the fact that, thus far, eight editions of Schott's secular variation papers have been successively issued by the Survey. In all matters relating to the relocation of land boundaries, where it is frequently necessary to know the precise amount of angular change in the direction of the magnetic meridian since the first or original survey, the Coast and Geodetic Survey is recognized throughout the country as the ultimate authority. The amount of money saved to landowners by such authoritative determinations as the Survey is able to furnish can scarcely be estimated. It certainly exceeds many times the total amount to be spent for magnetic work. Every effort will be made in the future to multiply and verify the secular variation data, and requests for information on the part of surveyors are being encouraged in every possible manner, and true meridian lines are being established for them in various parts of the country.
2. MAGNRTIC SURVEY OF THE COUNTRY.

This involves the determination of the magnetic elements, declination, dip, and intensity, at various points throughout the land. Just how close the stations should be to each other depends upon the special purpose to be accomplished with the means at hand, and the magnetic character of the regions involved. A magnetic survey has peculiar difficulties to contend with; for the quantities to be experimentally determined are forever undergoing changes-some periodic, others not periodic. A magnetic survey must, therefore, be made to refer to some particular moment of time, and such means must be taken as to enable one to reduce all the measurements, not only to the selected epoch of the survey, but also, as occasion may demand, to some other epoch in the near past or in the near future. Means must also be taken for the proper elimination of all such errors as are to be referred entirely to the particular magnetic instrument used-i. e., instrumental errors. These requirements call forElimination ef all variations ef short period or ef brief duration, such as the diurnal variation, seasonal variation, disturbance variation, by means of the continuous observations at magnetic observatories, suitably situated, and in sufficient number for the area covered by the magnetic survey. This requires, in addition to the permanent magnetic observatories, of which mention is made in another connection, the establishment at certain base stations of temporary magnetic observatories, more or less completely equipped. In many cases simply self-registering or eye,reading declinometers will suffice for the equipment of the temporary or secondary observatories. Elimination ef the secular variation.-For this purpose a certain number of wellselected stations distributed over the area with some degree of uniformity-so-called "secular variation" or "repeat stations "-are being established, where observations will be made with special care and repeated at certain intervals of time. Mr. Schott's list of "secular variation stations," embracing thus far I r8 stations, serves as an excellent basis in the selection of the "repeat stations." The number, however, is being greatly extended, especially in the western part of the count'ry, as only about one-sixth of the stations included in his list lie west of the Mississippi.

Were we to select one "repeat station" to every ro ooo square miles-i. e., one station for a land area such as is included in the State of Maryland, for example, or that of Vermont-we should require 300 "repeat stations" for the United States alone. Whether this number will be sufficient must be the subject of a special investigation. The number will probably have to be increased, as provision must also be made against some unavoidable loss in the num'Jer of the ''repeat stations'' originally established, on account of the encroachments of civilization. Elimination of z"nstrumental errors.-Various European investigators have found that the instrumental errors are frequently larger than the purely observational errors. In order, therefore, to make possible the strict intercomparison of all our magnetic work, a ''reduction correction to the selected Coast and Geodetic Survey Magnetic Observatory Standard'' is being determined at proper intervals of time for each survey instrument used. The Coast and Geodetic Survey magnetometer No. 18 and dip circle No. ·d!ir were compared by the writer in the fall of .1899 with the standard jnstruments at the following European magnetic observatories: Kew (England), Pare St. Maur (France), Potsdam (Germany), and Pawlowsk (Russia). The results of these comparisons and of others conducted during the year 1899-1900 will be published in the next report. At !tow many stations will it be necessary to determine the magnetic elements'!-The areas of the countries at present belonging to or under the jurisdiction of the United States are, approximately, as follows:
Square miles.

United ,States .............................................................. 3 025 6oo Alaska......................... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 577 390 Philippine Islands . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 119 ooo Hawaiian Islands ................................................... : . . . . . . 6 250 Porto Rico . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 530 Guam Island, Tutuila Island, and Midway Islands. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 220 Total ............................................................... 3 731 990

Hence we control an area equal to that of entire Europe, or about one-fifteenth of the entire land area of the globe. As magnetic surveys have been espeeially prosecuted in Europe, it will be of interest to note the density of distribution of the magnetic stations in two recent fruitful magnetic surveys, viz, that of Great Britain, where there was one station to every 139 squar: miles, and that of Holland, embracing one station to every 40 square miles. Suppose we were to decide upon one station, on the average, to every 100 square miles-an end that we must hope to attain some day-then we would require the determination of the magnetic elements at 30 ooo stations within the United States. At the rate of 400 stations a year, the magnetic survey, as detailed as this, would require for its completion at least seventy-five years. It is not well, however, to have a magnetic survey extend over such a long interval of years. The errors incurred in reducing the observations to a common epoch would greatly exceed the errors of observation. It is evident, then, that we must either have a very large number of observers and instruments at our disposal, so as to complete the survey within a short interval, say ten years at the most, or we must content ourselves for the present with making a less detailed survey ..

950

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1898-<)9.

Our present means will enable us to complete 450 stations per annum, of which 400 will be within the United States. It is hoped that at the end of the year 1916 we shall have occupied 4 ooo stations in the United States and have made the necessary repeat observations,'' and that the stations will have been to some degree uniformly distributed, so that we shall have on the average one new station to every 756 square miles. Selecting as the epoch to which the observations are to be reduced January l, 1905, we shall then have, with the addition of about I ooo former stations, which we could utilize, a magnetic survey the stations of which will be distributed at the average rate of one to every 600 square miles, or, approximately, one station to an area 25 miles (40 kilometres) square. This will give a very satisfactory representation of the distribution of the earth's magnetism within our confines, and will suffice for the accomplishment of many of the practical purposes of magnetic surveys. We will call this our first s~rvey," and, as stated, its epoch will be 1905. We shall now be able to tell in what portion of the country more stations are needed-that is, the density of the ultimate distribution of stations will not be a uniform one. In regions where the distribution of magnetism is fairly regular, comparatively few stations will suffice, while in magnetically disturbed areas the number of stations must be increased in conformity with the character and extent of the disturbance. The subsequent work will consist then in filling in stations where most needed and repeating observations at the ''repeat stations.'' In short, the plan of conducting a magnetic survey of this country which appears to be best suited to the present conditions, and one that it is possible to carry out within a reasonably short time, is as follows: To make first a general magnetic survey of the country, with stations about thirty to forty miles apart, then, as opportunities present themselves, to add stations in the magnetically disturbed areas. The observations at the ''repeat stations'' made from time to time will furnish the proper secular variation corrections. The great advantages of this plan over that of attempting a greatly detailed magnetic survey at once, the steady progress of which over the entire country, on account of its extent, would necessarily be very slow, will be readily perceived. It will be of interest, however, to point out that_ the plan as briefly outlined, and as followed at present, will make it possible within a reasonable time to construct two sets of magnetic maps for the same epoch, each set based upon a different distribution of the stations. An opportunity_ will thus be afforded, as in the case of the recent magnetic survey of Great Britain, to obtain some idea of the accuracy with which the isomagnetic lines can be determined. The satisfactory solution of this question will serve as a valuable guide in fut:ire magnetic work.

STATE MAGNETIC SURVEYS.

Various State geologists either have already made plans or are making plans for detailed magnetic surveys of their respective States, in cooperation with the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The detailed magnetic surveys of Maryland and North Carolina, conducted in cooperation with the State geological surveys, are nearing completion.

MAGNETIC SURVEY OF OCEAN AREAS.

Provisions for the determination of the magnetic elements at sea are likewise being made. With the many vessels at the service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, exceptional facilities for this purpose will be afforded. In fact, one of the chief duties of the Survey is the supplying of magnetic data to the mariner. From an economic standpoint, this feature of magnetic work is the one really of the greatest practical importance. In recognition of this fact, the Survey vessels will hereafter take advantage of every opportunity to obtaiti the magnetic elements on sea and on shore, with magnetic instruments specially adapted for such work.
5.
M;AGNETIC OBSERVATORIES.

The rapid, successful, and economical execution of the plans as above briefly outlined requires the establishment, at certain points (primary stations), of magnetic observatories, where the countless variations in the. earth's magnetic force are continuously and automatically recorded, thus enabling the proper corrections to be applied to observations made at stations at any hour of the day. The present plans contemplate the establJshment of a magnetic observatory on the Atlantic coast, to be situated in Maryland, 16 miles southeast of Washington citythis will be the central or standard observatory; another in the western part of the United States; one in the Hawaiian Islal_lds, and one in Alaska. \Vith the cooperation of the observatories at Toronto, Mexico, and Habana, and with the aid of secondary observatories (secondary base stations) established as occasion may demand, the areas to be surveyed will be fairly well covered. it is very much to be hoped, however, that our universities and colleges will seriously consider the establishment of magnetic observatories. Many an institution which utterly lacks the means of making a reputation in astronomical work could still afford to inauguarate work of great importance in terrestrial magnetism. 1'he United States stands at the bottom of the list of civilized countries possessing magnetic observatories. Almost every European power of note maintains not only one, but several magnetic observatories. France has four already established, and four additional ones in process of erection; and progressive Japan, with its small strip of territory, has six continuously operating magnetic observatories. The recent International Magnetic Conference recommended th~ establishment of a magnetic observatory at the Lick Observatory. It is earnestly to be hoped that this suggestion will be carried out. It is unfortunate that the San Antonio observatory in Texas had to abandoned. A permanent observatory should be reestablished in this locality. The scheme of work for the Coast and Geodetic Survey observatories will embrace, in addition to the regular magnetic work, observations in atmospheric electricity and of the electric currents within the earth. Such observations can be carried on with practically no additional cost, and yet add greatly to the value of the observatory work. Arrangements will likewise be entered into with foreign magnetic observatories for the making of strictly simultaneous observations of a special character. The United States Government, through the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has already promised to cooperate with the magnetic parties of the antarctic expeditions i~

making, simultaneously with them, observations of the variations of the earth's magnetism at the base stations of the magnetic survey. The plan of referring the initiation and prosecution of magnetic work in this country to the Coast and Geodetic Survey will readily be seen to have decided advantages. In the first place, the machinery for carrying on the work is already to a great extent in existence. Tht: observer engaged in geodetic or astronomical work can frequently include to advantage magnetic observations, and thus can often be saved the chief cost of magnetic work-the occupation of stations. Thus, for example, the parties at present engaged in surveying work in Alaska are also provided with magnetic outfits. Again, the care and refinement with which the geodetic and astronomical work of this Bureau must be carried out will ever be an incentive to keep the magnetic work of the same high order.
