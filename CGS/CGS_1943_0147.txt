A REVIEW OF THE YEAR

As has been the case since the beginning of the war, all activities of the Coast and Geodetic Survey during the fiscal Year 1943 were directed to supplying essential needs of the armed forces, merchant marine and other war agencies. The marine charts published by the Bureau are necessary tor the navigation of all United States coastal waters, and the greab expansion of our Navy and merchant marine naturally has resulted in a constantly increasing demand for these Charts. The distribution or over 1,900,000 charts in 1943 exceeded the issue or the previous year by some 900,000 copies and was over 5 times the number required annually berore the war. The nautical charting program included the Production of a considerable number of special charts for use 1n the antisubmarine campaign and other naval operations. To supplement its nautical charts the Bureau publishes annual tables of predicted tides and currents, and 13 coast Pilot volumes. The latter contain descriptions of the coasts, ~ailing directions and other information required for navigaion. Over 128,0DO copies of these publications were sup~lied in 1943. The annual issue before the war was about 5, 000 copies. и The growing importance of alrpower in warf'are has had a lllarked effect on the work of the Survey in the production of aeronautical charts. These charts, published for all land areas of the United States and possessions, are required for air navigation and for use in the extensive training programs or pilots and navigators now in progress. The demand for these charts during the year totaled over ~,000,000 copies-~early 12 times the prewar requirements. Activities in this ~anch of work included the continuation of an extensive ~~rting program of areas outside the United States for the -~1D.y Air Forces. This project involved the compilation of :everal different types of charts and required a total proUction of about 7,500,000 ch~rts. w Facilities available for all classes of field operations rere employed for the execution of a large number of projects equired by the armed forces, ranging in variety from hydror-aphic and topographic surveys of military and naval bases po Vibration measurements for the installation of highrecision machine tool equipment in war plants.
TRANSFER OF PERSONNEL AND EQUIP?r!ENT

Under the law which authorizes the transfer of personnel equipment of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the 'War and avy Departments in time of national emergency, 56 commis~toned officers were on military duty at the beginning of the t seal year. During the year 14 additional officers were ransrerred and three were returned. At the end of the year 5~ civilian members of the Bureau were also serving in the 9 -.o.111ed forces. th In addition to five survey ships previously transferred, ~ eиnew ship PATHFINDER was assigned to the Navy Oepartment Pon completion in September 1942, at a west coast yard.

TRAINING OF PERSONNEL

Many changes in personnel were made during the year due to the additional staff needed and the replacement of employees who went into the armed services. Since very few experienced persons were a~ailable for employment, considerable effort was made in formulating a program of training and in so arranging duties that a new employee could begin productive work with a minimum amount of training. In most cases ne~ employees consisted of persons not subject to induction. These were women; physically handicapped men; married men with families; and personnel made available through the Civilian Public Service Camps, commonly known as conscientious objectors. The latter have been employed on field work in an isolated section of the country. и Women have been placed in positions which in normal times were filled almost exclusively by men. These are offsetprinting-press helpers gradually being trained as operators; folding-machine operators; binders and finishers; photographers; hand-type compositors; draftsmen; cartographic engineers; artistic lithographers; mathematicians; computers; and in the field, recorders and engineering aids on survef parties and in the photogrammetric offices, and accountants and watchmen on triangulation and leveling parties. In all cases, except for draftsmen, the new employees are given "on the job" training since the number of new employees at an1 one time is small enough to be absorbed gradually and trained under the direct supervision of an experienced employee. Lack of experi~nced topographic draftsmen and the large number needed required special measures to obtain and traiJl recruits. Persons skilled in other types of drafting, such as statistical and mechanical, and later, those with art and design experience, were employed. It was necessary to train these in topographic drafting and, since they were obtaiped in large numbers, it was found to be more economical to establish a training unit whereby they could be trained in a group rather than to have the various supervisors devote ti.Jlle to "on the job" training. Later, when this source of recruitment was exhausted, the Civil Service Coilllllission, with knowledge of the successful results obtained in the Bureau's training unit, established a trainee draftsman examination to meet the needs иof all Government agencies. Since the examination was limited to eligibles within a radius of fift1 miles of Washington, personal interviews were possible and a mechanical aptitude device was constructed in the Bureau to test the applicants' aptitude. This device determines steadiness of hand, the coordination of hand and eye, and deptn perception, or the ability to see stereoscopically. The value of this device was demonstrated by the fact that rot ten employees who had successfully completed the training course and been graded, the five having the highest marks had obtained the highest ratings in the aptitude test. Many trainees were obtained as a result of this exami' nation and, since most of them had no drafting experience whatsoever, the training course was made more compreheJl' sive and extended in time to cover about four weeks. Eao~ emplotee is graded upon completion of the training and iP general the grades agree very favorably with those obtained in the Civil Service examination. Up to the end of the

3
fiscal year over 400 persons, mostly women and many without Previous experience, had been successfully trained as topographic draftsmen. The work of map making in the Bureau on which these draftsmen are engaged has been broken down into what migh~ be called an assembly line; that is, rather than have one Person carry along a complete job, the .work has been subdivided into a number of operations such as projections, Selection and evaluation of source material, compilation of OUlture, drainage and relief, nomenclature, smooth drafting, assembly and review. The employees assigned in the training section are given training along each phase of this work and, Upon completion of training, are assigned to the unit in Which they show the greatest aptitude; also, during training their work is carefully watched and training along their Particular aptitude is intensified. As an additional item of training for incentive purposes a?ld for morale building, a series of twenty-minute weekly lectures was inaugurated in Which each phase of the Bureau's activities is described. This is supple~ented by guest speakers fran the Army and Navy Who, in telling of the importance of the Bureau's products in actu~l warfare, bring a realization to the employees of the direct contribution they are making to the war effort.
COOPERATION WITH AMERICAN REPUBLICS

Under the sponsorship or the Department of State, which ~ade all necessary diplomatic arrangements and secured the needed funds; the Coast and Geodetic Survey continued to Participate in the program for cooperation with the American aepublics. These projects have resulted in a large number ~! favorable contacts with engineers and scientists in th~ ""llerican Republics and have been very effective in creating local interest and in developing mutually cordial relations. Field parties serviced instrumental equipment at the 14 ~ide stations previously established in various Central and oUth American ports. Records from these stations are being Ud.tilized tor the calculation of tide predictions and tidal atum planes and thus provide information of immediate value ~o mariners and engineers. Daily predic.tions for six additional ports have been included in the tide tables, making a otal of 12 ports, distributed from the Gulf of California to liagellan Strait, tor which predictions are now available as a result of this program. Magnetic surveys were carried on in 10 South American aet Publics. Work was commenced in Venezuela and continued hrough the west coast republics as tar south as Punta ~enas, Chile; thence to Cordoba, Argentina, and through ruguay and Paraguay to Brazil where work was in progress on J-u.ne 30. Instrumental ocmparisons and standardization obser~at1ons were made at Huancayo Observatory, Peru (operated by t he Carnegie Institution of Washington), at the Argentine national observatory at Pilar, and at the Brazilian national Observatory at Vassouras. Special diurnal observations were lllade at Arica, Chile. The distribution of the magnetic ob~~ations in South America is included in the table under ~'8.gnetic Investigations." и и During the course of the magnetic surveys, seismologiOaJ. observatories were visited and numerous seismologists

4

interviewed in preparation for a proposed cooperative seismological project in these'countries. The facilities of an American airline were used extensively. This company contributed materially to the success of the project by making its radio stations available for time signals, by making advanc~ plane reservations and by exercising extreme care in handling the delicate instrumental equipment. A rare geophysical phenomenon occurred in Mexico when in February a new volcano developed in a farmer's field and grew to over a thousand feet in height. This offered an unusual opportunity to obtain valuable information about the effects of new volcanic action on the earth's magnetic field as well as about possible correlation of volcanic with seismic activity. Magnetic observations for these purposes were made over the immediate area arow:XI. the volcano. The project was part of the program of cooperation with the American Republics for magnetic surveys, and its execution was assisted by the State Department, the Me%ican Government, the Pan American Institute of Geography and History, and numerous prominent scientists.
CHART PRODUCTION The rapidly growing needs of the Navy, merchant marine and air forces for nautical and aeronautical charts necessitated considerable expansion of personnel and equipment for chart ~roductior, most of which was employed on a two- or threeshift basis. The major results attained are shown in tbe following table which gives the annual issues of navigational charts and related publications during the past four years.

The number of individual nautical charts published at the end of the year was 840. To produce the 1,920,000 copies printed during the year there were 1,504 printings, as fold lows: 14 new charts, 116 new editions, 848 new prints, an 526 reprints. Of.the 14 new charts, 11 were constructed ror the Navy. Fifteen special nautical charts were prepared to provide information required for combatting submarines. Although a considerable portion of the charts were reprinted at least twice during the year it was necessary, dU 6 to rapid changes in important navigational information, to apply 7,680,944 hand changes to correct the charts to tb6 date of issue. Items covering chart changes, dangers requiring hand corrections and other navigational information were supplied to the U. S. Coast Guard and the Hydrographic Offi0 6 of the Navy for publication in weekly Notice to I1ariners. During the year the standard series of aeronautical charts of the United States and its possessions was increased rr 0~ 126 to 131 charts. In addition, 1,486 new charts were cow-

5
ll,928,161 charts printed during the year there were 2,147 Printings, as follows: 1,246 new charts, 360 revisions, 3ls reprints, and 223 base printings. These figures do not include 114 new charts and 62 revisions which were compiled by the Coast and Geodetic Survey but printed by the Army Map

Piled and printed for the Army Air Forces.

To produce the

Service. In addition to the routine work of maintaining and issuing aeronautical charts of the United States and its territorial possessions the Bureau has contributed to the Production of practically every type of aeronautical chart Used by the air forces in all theatres of the war. The new aeronautical charts produced for the Army Air Forces include a Wide variety of projects ranging from small-scale planning 0 harts to large-scale target charts for bombing and other t~ctical operations over enemy territory. Continuation of the compilation, drafting, and reproduction of special maps and charts intimately connected with the war effort, constituted a substantial portion of chart froduction work. Among these were airport approach and landng charts and war mapping quadrangles. The former consist or a series of 447 charts of the major airports of the United States, both military and civil, designed principally to ass~st the aviator in making safe landings during unfavorable 'Weather. The war mapping program involves the drafting and reproduction of approximately 359 standard 7-1/2 minute quadrangles of strategic areas within the United States. A Considerable amount of reproduction was done for other war agencies, principally the Civil Aeronautics Administration llnd the Maritime Commission. Heavy demands continued for photographic reproduction of ihe detailed hydrographic and topographic surveys contained n the files of the Bureau. These are used extensively by the military services and war agencies in connection with 'War construction projects, dredging of waterways, training or amphibious troops for invasion landings, research in connection with submarine detection, and many other projects requiring detailed knowledge of coastal regions and waters. Numerous outstanding contributions to developments in ~artography and lithography have been made by personnel of the Bureau for improving the efficiency and speed of produc~ion and, at the same time, maintaining the quality required. uue to rapidly changing conditLons of war and changes in fequirements for charts, brought about by tlctual experience n foreign theatres, it has frequently been necessary to alter certain designs of special purpose maps and charts ~0re rapidly than would have been possible by older methods r cartography and lithography. l Throughout the entire emergency the policy has been fo~ ~ O~ed of keeping methods and organization as flexible as 0 ssible so thB.t a shift in the design of a chart could be Illa.de .rapidly to meet the emergency conditions faced by the al'tned services. . This need of flexibility of organization has c.o annrronted every manufacturer or producer of war materials d is a logical corollary of modern warfare. b The great increase in the production of maps and charts rought about by the war, not only in this Bureau but in 0 tner Federal mapping agencies as well, has carried with it a troportionate amount of expansion in the operational faoiliea needed to support the primary job of obart making, such

6 as the canputaticn or projection tables, seau88lletic studies, analysi~ or isogonic lines on nautical and aeronautical charts, and geographic research tor source material. Close liaison has been maintained between the various Federal mapping agencies. Contracts tor chart printing were maintained throughout the year with several of the largest Jl18.P lithographic plants to. take care or printing above the capacity of the Bureau's plant. Commercial map lithographers are to be commended on the excellent work they are doing in the emergency. In order to assist in the effort to avoid overcrowding in Washington and still make use of the services or additional engineers and draftsmen, branch units for the compilation ot aeronautical charts were established in several cities in connection with other Bureau operations. Results or this action have been very satisfactory. The printing of charts has been increased materially through acquisition early in the year of a new two-color printing press. This type ot press is particularly effective in printing the sectional and regional aeronauticиal charts used in large quantities by the air forces or both the Art1IЦ and Navy for training and operations within the United States. Production will be further increased and the quail ty of all charts improved with the completion or an adequate humidity control system necessary for proper registration on multicolor charts.
COASTAL SURVEYS Activities in hydrography, topography, and coastal triangulation were continued with three survey ships, eleven smaller vessels, and several shore-based units. Six major survey vessels have been transferred to the Navy and two vessels in the Philippine Islands are no longer in service. All field operations were directed to complying with requests from the Army and Navy for surveys and investigations in strategic areas.

On the Atlantic coast the LYDONIA was engaged on hydrosraphic surveys along the coast of 11e.ine, including extensive иire-drag investigations. The launches MIT~HELL, OGDEN, 11ARINDIN, and RODGERS assisted in this work. A winter projeot of hydrographic surveys was completed by the LYDONIA in the Gulf of Mexico, in the vicinity of Cape San Blas, Fla. The GILBERT, assisted by the launch FARIS, was engaged on hydrographic and wire-drag surveys in Nantucket Sound ~d Buzzards Bay, and on special triangulation in the Long Bland Sound area. During the winter months the GILBERT, ~th the assistance of the new wire-drag launches HILGARD and AINWRIGHT, was engaged on surveys in the lower James River and in Che sa pe ake Bay. The COWIE conducted special hydrographic investigations Off the south Atlantic coast, and executed hydrographio surveys in Chesapeake Bay and triangulation surveys along the James River, between Hopewell and Richmond. During the ~Pring of 1943 this vessel completed current surveys in Block Bland Sound with the new radio-current-meter buoys and began B1Jni1ar surveys in Narragansett Bay. The motor vessel FARIS completed hydrographic and topoSl'aphic surveys in the vicinity of Lookout Bight, N. C., a hydrographic survey at the north end of Roanoke Island, andи triangulation and hydrographic surveys in Hampton Roads. The launch ELSIE III was engaged on hydrographic and topogl-aphic surveys of Ocracoke Inlet, N. C. During the winter months the launches MARINDIN and OGDEN ~re engaged on hydrographic and topographic surveys along he eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. The launches HILGARD and WAINWRIGHT conducted a resurvey of the entrance to ~ntauk Harbor, and special investigations in Block Island ound. A wire-drag party canpleted special surveys of inland 1alces and reser'Voirs. On the Pacific coast, during the period between Alaska rield seasons, the EXPLORER and PATTON continued hydrographic 8 Urveys in the vicinity of the San Juan Islands, and complet:d Wire-drag investigations on Hein Bank and other shoals. , topographic survey of Neah Bay.was made. The SURVEYOR ~ngaged in a hydrographic program in the vicinity of Port и ownsend. The motor vessel WESTDAHL was engaged on hydrogi-aphic and topographic surveys of the Admiralty Inlet area. The motor vessel E. LESTER JONES continued radio-current~eter surveys in Puget Sound. The motor vessel PATTON comPleted a triangulation project in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, attd executed additional triangulation in Haro Strait. In Alaska the ships EXPLORER and SURVEYOR and the motor ~easels E. LESTER JONES and PATTON were engaged on surveys of 0 onibat areas. The WESTDAHL continued surveys in southeast 4laska in the approaches to the naval base and for purposes or Coast Artillery fire control. Later, with the assistance or the motor vessel PATTON, this ship engaged in wire-drag investigations in Wrangell Narrows. S Processing offices were continued at Norfolk, Va., and eattle Wash. The operation of these offices at the prinC1pa1 b~ses of our field parties not only expedites the ttansition of field surveys to finished charts, but permits Close cooperation between the field engineer and the office dtartsman. By being relieved of a great amount of office иork, survey units are able to engage in a year-round program or field wark.

8

Air photographs of selected coastal areas in Massachusetts and Florida, and of extensive areas in southeastern Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula were made with the Bureau's 9-lens camera. Field inspection of air photographs was in progress in Maine, Virginia, and Florida. Photogrammetric offices continued in operation in Baltimore, Md., and Tampa, Fla., where planimetric maps were compiled of coastal areas in Maine, :Massachusetts, Florida, James River, Va., and San Francisco Bay. With funds provided by the War Department, an extensive mapping program was continued to provide 359 topographic map quadrangles, covering 15,939 square miles, of previously unmapped or inadequately mapped areas in Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. Approximately two-thirds of the area was photographed with the Bureau's 9-lens camera. The field stations ot the Bureau, located in the principal maritime ports, continued to render valuable service in supplying information for the correction of charts, in disseminating nautical andи engineering data in response to requests from local public and official sources. The personnel of these stations were consulted by naval and militar1 representatives on matters pertaining to confidential plans of proposed operations. Through these local conferences, there was a definite improvement in our cooperation in the war effort. The experience and data of the Survey were made immediately available and in each instance effected due expedition of the action. The 13 United States coast pilot volumes contain a wide variety of important information supplemental to that shown on nautical charts. These volumes are kept current by annual supplements and revisions. New editions of the coast pilots are published as often as is warranted by the number of changes that have been made and the amount of new information available. Nine supplements were issued during the year, 8 new edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot was published, and the manuscript for the Alaska Coast Pilot, Part I, was preparedи The new survey ship PAil!FINDER was completed in September 1942 and was immediately transferred, with full equipment, to the Navy Department. Two 65-foot, diesel-powered, w1redrag boats, the HILGARD and WAINWRIGHT, were completed ill November 1942 and assigned to field work on the AtlantiO coast. Two 30-foot wire-drag tenders were received from the builders in July.
GEODETIC CONTROL SURVEYS Since early in the war, all geodetic activities have been restricted to projects requested by military authorities, and for the most part paid for with funds fUrnished by them. Th 8 Bureau's appropriation for this work in 1943 was contributed to the program in order to maintain continuity of field oper' ations and because the additional triangulation and leveling are valuable increments to the national control-survey nets and are of great economic value to many Federal and state public works projects. The exigencies of war have greatl1 accelerated the demand for control, which is used for maP' ping priority areas, for training topographic battalions o~ the Corps of Engineers, for the coordination of coastal all

9

island defenses, for artillery fire control for the Coast Artillery Corps, and for other related problems. Activities during the year are summarized in the following tables:

On account of the great expansion of military activities ~~ Alaska it has become necessary to carry on geodetic work ""1 that region on a much larger scale than has ever been attempted in the past. A project of unusual importance tor this purpose was initiated in April. It consists of first0rder triangulation and leveling which, when complete, will ~xtend from White Pass, north of Skagway, along the White tass and Yukon Railway to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, and hence along the Military Highway, crossing into Alaska at the International Boundary on the 14lst meridian and latitude 62░ 40'. These surveys will connect with previously established geodetic control along the Richardson Highway in the ~1cinity of Big Delta, Alaska. This work is being done at the request of the Chief of :ngineers, U. s. Army, as a means of coordinating horizontal ~ontrol surveys in Alaska. At present there are a number of l'1tterent survey datums in Alaska. Most of these will be educed to a single datum (the North .American datum of 1927) ltter the completion of this arc or triangulation. The ~~~eling will determine elevations of bench marks referred to e mean sea le'Vel datum. b The project is considerably reduced in difficulty and cost rt the use of the Alaska Military Highway which it follows or the most part. Without the highway, the problems of ~ransportation would be exceedingly difficult. The progress the work is turther aided by the excellent cooperation of ~eld personnel of the Canadian Government, the International thllndary Commission, United States, Alaska and Canada, and e Corps of Engineers, U. s. Army. иThese organizations are gi.eatly interested in the early completion of.these surveys. Another project of importance to Alaska is the arc of ~1angulation westward from Nenana along the Yukon River via by to Unalakleet on Norton Sound, and thence north and west on Seward Peninsula nearly to Bering Strait. The eastward ~8 0tion of this work between Nenana and the coast of Norton ░und had been completed at the end of the year. This work 18 being expedited by the use of air transportation. The Bureau also engaged in a number of special survey ~~OJects requested by the military authorities tor coastal a:rense purposes and for control of outlying island bases d other regions.

Variation of latitude observatories at Ukiah, Calif., and Gaithersburg, Md., were continued in operation throughout the year in accordance with an international program begull in 1899. Besides the processing of field data, the office force ill Washington handled a number of special projects related to the war effort. These included the computation of several projection tables for use by the Army Air Forces in the world-wide aeronautical charting program; computation of azimuth errors, due to projections, for correcting compass roses on nautical charts; mathematical research relative to the use of certain map projections as applied to the solutioll of navigational problems; a study of the effect of gravity oil barometric readings; and the computation of special stal' tables for use by the Marine Corps in the rapid determinatioll of azimuths in equatorial regions. . Computing offices at New York and Philadelphia were diS' continued as WPA projects in July and September, respeC' tively. Subsequently both were operated as Bureau projects with reduced forces ma.de up from the most efficient employees from the original organizations. The Philadelphia office was closed entirely on June 30, 194~.
TIDE AND CURRENT WORK Complete adaptation to war needs marked the tide and cur' rent activities of the Bureau during the year. Such services as were not performed directly for the armed forces were concentrated on aiding the war effort. Detailed tide and current surveys were made and special tide and current date calculated for the military services under specific requestsи Correlated assistance was provided to industry engaged in tne development and utilization of coastal property for we> production, including the compilation of tidal data and ill' formation pertaining to tidal bench marks for use in tne construction and operatic~ of shipyards, airfields, emergenc1 housing projects, and other port developments. Warranting special mention is the work carried out at tb~ specific request of the War Department. With 1'unds provide by the Army Air Forces early in the fiscal year a new Ulli~ was organized to make the necessary investigations and re' search for the preparation of comprehensive reports on tides and currents for probable operational areas. Under tbi 8 program 22 reports were supplied covering various strategiO areas throughout the world. During the fiscal year, 45 primary and 30 secondary tid 6 stations were in operation; 38 on the Atlantic coast, 22 ░~ the Pacific ooast and 15 in Central and South America. Forty of these stations were conducted in collaboratiO~ with other governments and agencies, including the Republi 0 of Mexico, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Pe:rUи Chile and Venezuela; the u. S. Engineers; the Navy Depart; ment; Territory of Hawaii; City of Santa Monica; Los Angel 8 , Harbor Department; Oxnard Harbor district; Woods Hole Ooea~ 0 и graphic Institution; Chesapeake Biological Laborator1! and the Oceanographic Laboratories of the University 0 . Washington. J. Observations from these stations supply data essenti~P tor the prediction of tides, the reduction of soundings

13
hYdrographic surveys, the study of coastal stability, the ~etermination of mean 'sea level for geodetic leveling, and he determination of datum planes required in the development or coastal property. Shorter periods of observations at approximately 53 additional stations were obtained in connection with hydrography and other activities. The tide survey of the Columbia River, carried out in Cooperation with the U. s. Engineers at Portland, Oregon, 'Ras completed in August. Tidal surveys, prosecuted under the direct supervision of trained personnel, have been most successful but, due to war conditions, for the first time Since 1933 no such surveys are now in progress. The comprehensive current survey of Puget Sound, started ~n 1942, was continued, 13 additional current stations having een occupied during the year. To secure information requested by the military services and by war industries, current surveys were conducted in a number of other important 'tlaterways. At the end of the fiscal year a special survey Party was engaged in securing current data required for use or the Navy. b Reciprocal agreements for the exchange of tide predictions etween the United States and Great Britain, Canada, and ~nldia were continued in effect and arrangements were cometed for a similar exchange with Argentina.
MAGNETIC INVESTIGATIONS The earth's magnetic forces vary from place to place and are constantly changing at any one place. Comprehensive mag~6tic information is essential for navigation on the sea and n the air. Such information also has a number of applica~ions in military operations and is used extensively for tther purposes by land surveyors, oil and mineral prospec~ 0rs, radio and telegraph companies and scientific investi.:.ators. t Continuous record13 of the magnetic elements were obtained ~l"oughout the year by magnetic observatories at Cheltenham, ~ иi Tucson, Ariz.; Honolulu, T. H.; Sitka, Alaska; and San 0 ~an, P. R. These records were supplemented by observations ~ magnetic declination and other magnetic elements, at nuerous points throughout the country. ~ Several special field projects were carried on to meet the t~eds of the armed forces. Ionosphere observations were cont nued in San Juan, P. R., for radio communication research n cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico. Investi~itions were made of reported local magnetic disturbances ong airways in South Dakota, Minnesota, and Washington, and ~g?ietic meridians were established at 57 airports in 27 . ates. . at In the Washington office, a special section organized to ~Udy declination continued to furnish magnetic data for tautical charts and military maps. These data were furnished po other government mapping agencies engaged in the military tl" 0 Ject, including the Army Map Service, the Army Air Forces, She Army Signal Corps, the Geological Survey, the Forest ~er~ice, the Soil Conservation Service, and the Bureau of lgricultu.ral Economics. This unit also furnished isogonic 1nes for several series of world-wide aeronautical charts.

14
Manuscript was completed for Alaska Magnetic Tables and Charts for 1940; Earth's Magnetism and its Utilization; and six volumes of Observatory Results, of which four were published. There was a material exchange of data and instruments wit~ the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the following geophysical activities were continued in cooperation with that organization: Operation o! a cosmic-ray meter at Cheltenham Observatory; maintenance at Cheltenham Observatory of international magnetic standardsi and observation of atmospheric and earth electric currents at Tucson Observatory (with the Bell Telephone Laboratories cooperating for about nine months). Directions were prepared for the use of engineers in the establishment and testing of compass rose sites at airports, for the purpose of detecting artificial magnetiO disturbances, and for determining the deviation of airplane oompasses.

SEISMOLOGICAL WORK 'l'he seismological work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is n:f1gned to locate all significant earthquake areas in the tt ted States and its possessions, to determine the destruc~~e effects, as well as the nature of earthquake motions, to safeguard life and property by giving to the engio_

16
neer data which will enable him to determine where and to what degree earthquake-resistant designing of structures is needed. Information ot this character was furnished during the year to scientists, engineers, and other individuals, as well as to special organizations and to the military forces. Seismographs were operated at observatories in Tucson,и Honolulu, Sitka, San Juan, and Ukiah. The operation or seismographs in the Lake Mead region was continued as a joint undertaking of the National Park Service, of the Bureau of Reclamation, and of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The two last-named bureaus cooperated in completing and maintaining seismograph stations at Shasta Dam and at Grand Coulee Dam. Assistance was given to nine colleges in the maintenance of seismographs and to seven independent stations through study and interpretation of their records or readings. Temporary arrangements for interpreting the seismograms from Ivigtut and Scoresbysund, Greenland, were continued. Sixty-two strong-motion seismographs were in operation at the close of the year at 54 stations in California, Nevada, Utah, Montana, and the Canal Zone. Thirty-seven strongmotion records were obtained for nine severe earthquakes. Vibration tests included: The study of earthquake effects on buildings; a series of ground vibration observations in connection with blasting operations; a special building test; and a series of observations at five war plants to investigate the effect of heavy machinery on equipment used for high precision work. The final report of the accelerometer shaking-table tests, conducted at the Massachusetts Institute ot Technology in cooperation with the Coast and Geodetic Survey, was completed and published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America. Vibration instruments were loaned to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for war work. Others were loaned for a study of the vibrations o1 the Potomac Ri~er (Morgantown) Bridge. . Four tilt meters were operated near earthquake faults, in cooperation with the University of California and with the City of Long Beach, California, to detect tilt effects which may precede or follow earthquakes in the vicinity of these faults. In the investigation of engineering problems relating to the mitigation of earthquake damage, cooperation was continued with the Engineering Departments of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and Stanford University. Special information regarding earthquake frequency in connection with proposed construction was furnished the Federal Power Commission. Earthquake investigation in the United States is a highlY cooperative undertaking, involving about 40,000 perpons and participated in by the Weather Bureau, the Post Offtce Department, several universities, public utility organizations, insurance companies, and seismological societies. During the past year the Department of State rendered valuable assistance in effecting improved telegraphic earthquakereporting service with friendly countries in the Pacific war zone. Cooperation with Science Service was continued, thus permitting the immediate location of important earthquakes through instrumental data oolleoted by that organization. Fifty-tour earthquakes were located and the results furnished all cooperating agencies. Questionnaire coverage was made for 11 earthquakes which approached destructive character. In all, about l,700 reports were received for some 200 earthquakes.

17
INSTRUMENTAL WORK In addition to maintaining the extensive instrumental equipment required for the Bureau's operations, the Instrulllent Division effected further improvement of the signal lEllllps for night triangulation observations, and undertook t he experimental development of a sextant constructed of Dow ~eta1 and duralumin which will be much lighter and more easily manipulated than the instrument now in use. Several gun pointers of a design suggested by a member of the Bureau now serving in the Army, were constructed for the Ordnance Service of the War Department. Assistance was also afforded to other Government agencies in effecting repairs to instru-

~ents.

To meet special needs of the Navy, improveIOOnts were made 1n the Dorsey chronograph, developed in the Bureau's Electrical Laboratory, so that time intervals of 0.002 second can be easily and accurately measured. Twc new instruments for measuring the vertical intensity or ~he earth's magnetic field were developed in cooperai1on witb the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism, Carnegie nstitution of Washington. One is a new type of marine mag~etometer and the other a high-frequency, quartz-suspension ~Yl>e variometer. New methods were developed in the use of alnico," an alloy especially suitable for magnets used in 0 bservatory variometers.и Three improved magnetograph recorders, complete with special lamps and time-marking equip~ent, were constructed. Special devices were provided for ~ecording automatically high and low frequency radio time 8 1gnals on seismograms.
PERSONNEL AND FINANCES Acquisitions by the library and archives included 123 ~drographic and 46 topographic sheets; 221 air photo~raphic b Pa, representing new Bureau surveys; 781 blueprints (mostly the U.S. Engineers); 32,509 maps; 5,913 charts; 10,935 l eld, office, and observatory records; 207 negatives; h,053 prints; 73 lantern slides; 1,018 books; and 2,599 .-er1odicals. ~- The number of persons serving in tue Coast and Geodetic r~vey at the close of the year was 2, 772, distributed as Ollows:
