REPORT.
PART I.
INTIWDUCTOHY
STATE::\'IE~T.

This report presents a fnll account of the varied operation8 carried on during the fiscal year by this important branch of the pnblic service, and also gives in concis~ tabular f~rm complete statistics relating to the distrilmtion of field parties and the resnlts accomplished both in field and office. The usual maps and sketches, showing graphically the progress of the Snrvey and the present condition of the work, aecompany the report and will be found at the end of the volume. Field operations.-The field operations during the year have included the measurement of base lines; reconnaissance; triangulation; astronomical determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth; telegraphic and chronometric determinations of longitude; topographical and hydrographical surveys and resurveys; tidal and current observations; determinations of magnetic declination, dip, and intensity; pendulum observations for determination of the force of gravity; geodetic leveling; Coast Pilot examinations; bonndary-line surveys; special topographic and hydrographic examinations, including the investigation of reported dangers to navigation; and laying out and marking of naval speed trial courses. Upward of fifty field parties were eugaged on these various branches of the work, and these were distributed along the Atlantic, Gulf, Pacific, and Alaskan coasts, and in the interior of the country. Surveys or observations were conducted within the limits or on the coasts of twenty States and Territories along the seaboards, and in fifteen interior States and Territories. The special operations of importance begun, continued, or completed during the year may be enumerated as follows: Completion of the topographic and hydrographic resurvey of New Bedford Harbor and its approaches; continuation of the topographic and hydrographi'c resurvey of Buzzards Bay; continuation of bydrograpbic surveys and examinations on the coast of Massachusetts; continuation of hydrographic resurveys in Nantucket Sound, Block Island Sound, and off Montauk Point; continuation of the topographic resurvey of the southern -shores of Long Island; continuation of the Hudson U.iver snrvey; extension of the main triangulation eastward across the States of Maryland and Delaware to Capes Henry and Henlopen; bydrographic resurvey of the harbor and entrance of Port lwyal, S. C.; magnetic determinations in various Eastern, Middle, Southern, aud Western States; special bydrographic examinations aloug the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts; completion of the hydrographic resurvey of Pensacola Bay and Entrance; continuation of the primary triangulation of the oblique arc in Alabama; continuation of the determination of points for State surveys; progress mnde in the triangulation of Lake Ponchartrain; continuation of the transcontinental triangulation in Kansas, Colorado, and Utah, including base-line measurements; continuation of the transcontinental line of precise levels in Kansas; continuation of the topographic and hydrographic resurvey of Sa11 Francisco Bay and Harbor; continuation of the survey of Vv a.shington Sound; continuation of general and hydrographic surveys in southeast S. Doc. ::!5--1 1

Alaska; continuation of the survey of the California and Nevada oblique lwundary Jine; continuation of surveys in connection with the Southeast Alaska-British Columbia boundary line; magnetic determinations at sixty-one stations in various parts of the country; telegraphic and chronometric longitude determinations at twenty-two stations; gravity determinations at six stations; tidal observations at various points on the Atlantic, Gulf; and Pacific coasts, including Alaska. In accordance with the uniform practice of the Department, requests from national or State authorities for special surveys, or for the detail of officers for special service, have been complied with whenever practicable, and the foIJowing operations have in this way been undertaken and completed: A special hydrographic survey of the Dry Tortu gas deep- water anchorage and its approaches, at the request of the Navy Department; the erection of beacons on the north sllore of Long Island for the Long faland Sound speed trial course, at the request of tlle honorable Secretary of the Navy; cooperation with the Navy Department in the erection of beacons on the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts for the speed-trial course of the Indiana and Kataltdin; cooperation with the Navy.Department in the layiug out and marking of a speed-trial course in Santa Barbara Channel for the new battle ship Oregon; a special topographical survey on a large scale of tlte grounds of the Naval Academy at Annapolis, for the Navy Department; cooperation with the United States Geological Survey in the determination of' tlte telegraphic difference of longitude between San Francisco, Cal., and Bllensburg, Wash. At the request of the commissioners appointed by the United States Supreme Court, two officers of the Survey were detailed to examine and retrace a portion of the boundary line between the States of :Missouri and Iowa. Special assignmmits.-The assignments of two of the assistants of the Survey to special duty by appointment of the President liave been continued, one ai'l a member of the Mississippi Hiver Commission and the other as a member of the International Boundary Commission organized for the survey and marking of that part of the United States and Mexican boundary line extending· westwai-d from El Paso. The latter officer, however, performed regular coast-survey service from the beginning of the fiscal year until October 1, the date fixed for the reassembling of the Boundary Commissio11. Office work.-In the oftice the usual progress has been made in the reduction and computation of the field results, in the drawing, engraving, and preparing for publication the charts of the Survey, the Coast Pilot, and the annual tide tables, and there has been no abatement of the efforts to give the public the earliest notice of important changes or discoveries. The monthly issue of Notices to Mariners has been continued, and during the year 121 000 copies were distributed gratis. The issue, during the same time, of cuarts, Coast Pilots, and Tide Tables has been as follows: Charts! 64 541; Coast Pilots, 848; Tide '.1.'ables, 6 580. Office of Standard Weights and Measures.-This important office, also under the charge of the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has been conducted as heretofore, aud notwithstanding its small force, prompt response has been made to all requests for information, and the usual amount of work in testing, verifying, and standardizing weights and measures for other departments of the Government, for States, and for private parties has been accomplished. Some progress has also been made in the acquiring of electrical standards and in the prepara. tion for undertaking the determination and verification of electrical units. This work is necessarily slow on account of limited means, the whole annual appropriation for the purchase of material and apparatus and for incidental expenses being only $500. . Among the operations carried on during the year the following may be specially mentioned as of the greatest importance: First. The construction of the 50-metre comparator, by means of which a higher de1:.>Tee of precision in the determination of 1inear values is possible, and with a much less expenditure of time and labor. Second. The standardization, by means of this 50-metre comparator and a standard in ice, of the new duplex base apparatus. This base apparatus was designed by one of the Assistants of the Survey, and was eutirely conRtructed in the Survey instrument shop, and it is believed that it will yield results far superior to any other base apparatus yet devised for rapid and economical

field work. One prominent feature of the apparatus is its yielding two simultaneous measmes of a base by rods of two different metals .with widely different coefficients of expansion, so that the temperatures can be deduced more accurately than by indications of thermometers. The difficulty of obtaining the true temperature of the bars during a measure has heretofore been the greatest source of uncertainty in primary bases. International Geodetfo Oonference.-As official uotiftcation had been received that at the General Conference of the International Geodetic Association to be held at Berlin, Germany, in October, 1895, propositions to modify the terms of the International Geodetic Convention of 1886 would be considered, it was deemed of the utmost importance that the Coast and Geodetic Survey should be represented by a delegate and participate in the deliberations. Accordingly Assistant 0. H. Tittmann was appointed as delegate by the President of the United States, and in accordance with instructions sailed for Europe on the 17th of September, a,rriving in Berlin in time to attend the opening meeting on the 30th. The meetings of the Conference lasted until October 12. Essential modifications of the terms of the existing treaty were agreed upon for submission to the several Governments concerned, the principal ones being as follows: First, a more equitable distribution of votes; secoud, the abolition of the permanent Commission, and the substitution therefor of an executive board, with a consultative commission on whiCh every participating country shall be represented; aud third, an increase of the annual budget, with a view to establishing stations for observing the variation of latitude. Mr. Tittmann returned soon after the close of the meetings, and on November 4 resumed his duties as Assistant in Charge of the Office. Arrangement of this Report.-The contents of Part I are arranged in the following order: Introductory statement, including notice of field and office work, special assignments, Office of Standard Weights and l\feasures, arrangement of this Report, and geographical order and classification of localities of field work; General statement of progress in field and oftice work, including subdivisions of the former and notices of publications of the Survey during the year; Explanations of estimates for the fiscal year 1898, and the estimates themselves in detail; Abstracts of reports from field parties, including Eastern, ~fiddle, Western, and Alaska, divisions, and special operations; Abstracts of office and suboffice annual reports; Supplementary tables, viz, No. 1, Showing the distribution and personnel of field parties, No. 2, Giving statisti~s of field and office work, No. 3, Giving list of information furnished during the year in reply to official and personal calls; Office annual reports, yiz, No.1, Report of tile Assistant fo Charge of the Office, accompanied by reports of the various chiefs of di visions, No. 2, Report of the hydrographic inspector, No. 3, Report of the disbursing agent, No. 4, Report of the Assistant in Charge of the Oflice of Standard "Weights and Measures; Li8t of maps and progress sketches to illustrate the work, and the maps and sketches themselves. Part II contains the Appendices and their illustrations, the Appendices being professional and scientific papers relating to methods, discussions, and resuJts. Geographical classification of loca./itics of .fieltl ·1corl.-.-The same geographical classification of localities in use since 1891 has been retained iu this Ueport, viz: I. The Eastern Division, including all States east of the l\Iississippi Hiver. II. The Middle Division, comprising the States ai1d Territories between the Mississippi Hiver and the Hocky Mountains. III. The Western Division, embracing the States and Territories between the Hocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. IV. The Division of Alaska, including Alaska and the Aleutian and Pribiloff Islands. Special operatfons are g1·ouped togethei· under one heading without regard to the above classification, but the geographical order has nevertheless been preserved as far as possible.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

~nd also by the branch hydrographic offices of the Navy Department, the United States customhouses, and the United States consulates in foreign ports. Bulletins.-But oue bulletin was issued during the year, viz, No. 35, containing e;eneral information in regard to certain parts of Alaska. It is, in fact, a compilation of the most recent information relative to tlie harbors, anchorages, and dangers to navigation in the vicinity of Chatham and Peril straits and Cooks Inlet. The data in relation to the latter locality are derived .from the notes of Prof. W. H. Dall, of the United States Geological Survey, and those .relating · to Chatham and Peril straits from actual surveys by the Gnited States Coast and Geodetic Survey. As considerable time necessarily elapses before the results of a survey can be given to the navigator in chart form, and no complete or reliable Coast Pilot of the Alaskan coast exists, the early publication of valuable information in bulletin form is deemed of the utmost importance. Other bulletins of a simHar natnre, for other Alaskan localities, will be issued from time to time as material for them is obtained.

EXPLANATION OF ESTIMATES.
The estimates submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury for the fiscal year 1898 were accompanied by the following explanations: U. S. Co.A.ST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY,
0FFIOE OF '.l.'HE SUPERINTENDENT,

Washington, D. O., October 2, 1896. Sm: I have the honor to transmit herewith estimates for the work of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey and Office of Construction of Standard Weights and Measures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898. An increased amount has been asked for "field expenses" to provide for urgently needed surveys and resurveys, including, among other important objects, the resurvey of Galveston Bay, for which an appropriation of $10 000 is asked, to be available until expended, and a reconnaissance along the Pacific coast from Cape Mendocino to. the Straits of Juan de Fuca. The item for ''contribution to the International Geodetic Association" has been omitted, as it is thought that this object should be estimated for by the Department of State, and arrangements have been suggeste<l to effect the change. · The estimate for "repairs and maintenance of vessels" has been increased by the amount of $10 ooo, to be immediately available, to provide for the construction of new boilers for the steamer Blake. The present boilers are worn out beyond repa~. ' An appropriation of $75 000 is asked for commencing the construction of a new steamer for service in Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. Such a vessel is absolutely necessary for the exploration and survey of the Aleutian Islands and northwestern Alaska. The Survey has no vessel of either sufficient power or strength to safely engage upon that work. Under the head of "Salaries" an addition of $1 000 is asked in the item for salary of Superintendent, making it $6 000, as provided by statute. This was the amount appropriated until the year 1895-96, when $5 000 was appropriated. The following changes in the office force are recommended: The designations "clerk to the Superintendent" ancl "clerk to the Assistant in Charge of the Office aud Topography" to be abolished, and these positions to be included under the general head of "Clerical force," at the same rates of pay. These positions are now in the classified service, from which they were formerly excepted. Under the head of" Chart correctors, buoy colorists, etc.," it is proposed to promote one fr9m $1 200 to $1 350 per annum-a well-merited advancement-and to transfer to this designation one plate printer at $1 000, whose present duties relate more especially to chart corrections. Under the head of "Topographic and bydrograpltic draftsmen," it is proposed to promote one from $900 to $1 200 per annum. Of those classified as "astronomical, geodetic, tidal, and miscellaneous computers," the promotion of two from $1 400 to $1 600 and of one from $1 200 to $1 400 per annum is recommended. The estimates have been so modified as to provide for these proposed changes. Of the "electrotypers and photographers, plate printers and their helperA, instrument makers, etc.," it is proposed to advance four from $1 000 to $1 100 per annum each, and one from $700 to· $900 per annum, and to drop one at $700. These changes are intended in order to make the rates of compensation correspond more nearly with the rates paid for similar services elsewhere. A reduction of $600 is made in the estimate for "office expenses."

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In the estimate for" Office of Construction of Standard Weights aml Measures," it is recommended to increase the force by one expert, to be called a verifier, for the purpose of taking in hand the verification of electrical standards. Congress has taken a first step toward establishing electrical standards lJy legalizing units of electrical measure, but no provision has been made to enable the office to make verifica~ions in conformity with the law for the benefit of the public concerned. The increase in the salary of the present adjuster has been recommended time and again on account of hi:i efficient services, and the recommendation of an increase from $1 500 to $1 800 is here repeated as more commensurate with the service rendered. The pay of .an assistant messenger, whose duties are better designated by the word "helper" than by the old title, is recommended for increase from $720 to $900 per annum. These ohanges would put the Office of ·weights and Measures on approximately the same footing on which it was prior to 1887, in which year the office of verifier was abolished.

Telegraphic determination of tlte d~tference of longitude betil'een Cambridge, 1lfass., and Calais, Ale.; also incidental mag1wtic and gravity deter1llinatio11s.-Iu August, 189J, Assistants A. T. Mosman and G. R. Putnam, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to Cambridge, Mass., a11d Oalais, Me., respectively, for the purpose of determining the difierence of longitude between the two points. Assistant l\losman, accompanied by Assistant Homer P. Hitter, reached Cambridge on the 16th, and Assistant Putnam arrived at Calais on the 17th. The two observatories were at once erected and connected with the "resteru Union lines, and observations began on the 21st. Exchanges of' time signals took place on the nights of August 21, 25, 27, and 30, and September 1, and again, after the usual interchange of observers, on September 5, 8, 10, 13, and 14. Assistant Putnam also made at Calais three days' observations for the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, and two days' pendulum observations for the determination of the force of gravity. The magnetic observations were obtained on August 22, 23, and 24, and the pendulum observations ou August 22 and 23, the observations for both being so arranged as not to interfere with or delay the longitude work. The parties returned to Washington ou September 18, and were engaged until October 10 in computing the results of this and previous work, after which Messrs. Putnam and Ritter were assigned to duty in the Weights and Measures Office and computing division, respectively, antl Assistant :l\Iosman resumetl his duties as member of the United States and Mexico International Boundary Commission. Hydrographic surveys and e.raminations on the coast of .:llas.yaclmsctt11.-The steamer Bache, Lieut. Robert G. Peck, U. S. N., commanding, after erectiug beacons ou the north shore of Long Island, as described under the head of "Special operations," and carrying the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Hydrographic Inspector on a tour of inspection to New Bedford, Hyannis, and Boston to visit the topographic and hydrographic parties at work in those localities, finally reached Boston on the evening of July 30, 1895. A few days were spent in preparing the steam launch stored at the Boston Navy-Yard for service antl in obtaining water and other needed supplies for the ship, after which tlle Bache proceeded to Cohasset and began the season's work. A special examination was first made of the vicinity of Minot's Ledge, then of the depths off Boston Light-House, Broad Sound, and along the coast from ~ ahant to the entrance of Salem Harbor, the results in each case save one being a verification of the conditions already charted. At one spot in Broad Sound a depth of 18 feet was found "·here the chart shows 4~

fathoms. This lies directly in the fairway of vessels bound for Lynn, and its discovery. was therefore one of great importance. Its location was carefully determined and reported, and a special Notice to :Mariners was promptly issued. The unfinished sheet of the previous year, Nahant to Cat Island, was then taken up aud completed and special examinations were made in Salem Harbor and its approaches, after which the sheet Marblehead to Manchester.was begun. From the 18th to the 27th of September the Bache was absent from her working ground, building beacons on the coasts of Maine and l\fassachusetts for the use of the Navy Department in laying out the speedtrial course of the India.na and Jlatahdin. · The sheet was completed November 1, and the season's work closed. The Bache proceeded to Boston to store her boa.ts and equipments and to procure a supply of coal for the run to New York, and arrived at the latter poi11t :Xovember 12, after having stopped en route at Provincetown, Hyan11is, 'Woods Hole, New Bedfor1l, and Bridgeport. A special report on new l'ocks and shoals developed during tlie season has been made by Lieutenant Peck, and the positions of such of them as are of sufficient importance will be given in Notices to Mariners. The statistics of the season's work are as follows:

The officers attached to the party during- the season were as follows: Commanding officer, Lieut. Robert G. Peck; Lieut. E. H. Tillman; Ensigns H. K. Hines, A.H. Davis, and F. M. Rus . sell; P.A. Surir. G. H. Barber; P.A. Engineer A. i\IcAllh;ter; Pay Yeoman .J. L. Dunn, drafts· man; l\Iaster. at-Arms Thomas S. Martin, observer and recorder. Seamen John Craig and A. Ander8en also i:;erved as recorders. The further services of the Bache's party will appear under the proper geographic headings. Continuation of hydrograpll'ic resnl'veys fa Nantucket Sound and its ea.~tern approache.~, and special exa.minat-ions a.nd developments on Nantucket 8/toal.~ and -in the approaches of Hyanni~ Harbor.-At the close of the last fiscal year the steamer Blake was undergoing repairs at Jersey City, and on their completion in July, 18H5, Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby assumed charge of the vessel aud proceeded to Hyannisport, Mass., arriving there on the 22d. The work assigned to the Blake consisted of the resurvey of the eastern eutrauce and approaches of Nantuckt~t Sound, and special examinations arnl developments of part of Nantucket Shoals and the approaches to Hyannis Harbor; also, a close development of the greater part of Handkerchief Shoal and the passage between it aud Monomoy Point, and a general survey of Butlers Hole and the area between these localities and :Xantucket. Work was at once commenced and was prosecuted with vigor until the boisterous and inclement weather incident to the season of the year compelled a cessation of operations in November. The survey near the entrance of Nantucket Sound was one of gTeat difficulty on account of conflicting tidal currents, the scarcity of available signals, the prevailing southwest winds and accompanying heavy seas, a111l the large traffic of coastwise vessels of every description; the fishing boats and small craft and the numerous fishing nets and lobster pots also seriously hampered the movements of the vessels. Notwithstanding the difficulties encountered, the results of the season's work were very satisfactory, and a large amount of useful and necessary data for the correction of the charts of the locality was obtaiued. Lieutenant. Commnnder Colby reports that the heavy northeast gales cause a frequent shifting of the shoals and cha1111els in this vicinity, and strongly recommends that, in view of the great commercial importance of these waterways, annual reexaminations be made. 'l'he season closed on the 7th of November, and the Blake proceeded to Baltimore, arriving there on the 21st, after stopping en route at Newport, New York, and the Patuxeut Hiver. After underPrgoing necessary re1)airs she wa~, in .January, 1896, assigned to further duty on the coast of South Carolina, which will be noticed farther on in proper geographical order.

The list of naval officers attached to the party was as follows: Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby in command, Lieut. J. A. Shearman, Lieut. W. S. Benson, Ensign A. T. Long, Asst. Surg. B. R. 'Vard, and Pay Yeoman W. S. Crosby. Resurvey of Buzzards Bay, 1lfossachusetts.-A resurvey of Buzzards Bay being urgently needed on account of the numerous changes reported since the previous survey of fifty years ago, four topographical parties and one hydrographic party were assigned to duty in this region just before the close of the last fiscal year. The four topographical parties were under the charge of Assistants D. B. Wainwright, J. A. Flemer, Stellman Forney, and ,V, I. Vinal, respectively, and the hydrographic party under the charge of Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N., commanding the schooner Eagre. To the latter was assigneu the hydrographic survey of New Bedford Barbor and its approaches, while to the four shore parties were assigned eight topographic sheets, laid out in sequence to embrace the shores of the bay and a strip of topography varying iu width from 1 to 3 miles, from the western part of the entrance to Swifts Hill aud Falmouth Village; the topography and shore line on th~ peninsula between the latter points and Woods Hole and the outlying islands of Naushon, Pasque, Nashawena, and Cuttyhunk were not included in this season's scheme. It was hoped that the whole of the topographical work above outlined could be completed during the summer and autu11111, but owing to the scantiuess of the appropriation, and the necessity of reserving a portion for urgent work on the Southern coast during the winter, the parties were obliged to disband by the end of October, leaving considerable areas to be completed during the following year. The reports of the several chiefs of parties are noticed separately in the parag-raphs immediately following, and the results and tabulated statistics of each are there given.

Topographical resur'l!ey of Buzzards Bay, Jlfassaclwsetts.-New Bedford an<l .Jfattapoiset sheets.To .Assistant D. B. Wainwright were assigned the New Bedford and l\fattapoiset sheets, the former extending from Moshers l'oint, at the southwest point of the entrance of Clarks Cove, to Sconticut Neck, and including the city of New Bedford and the villages of Fairhaven and Acushnet, and the latter extending from Sconticut Neck to Angelica Point. As many of the old trigonometric points were, from various causes, not recoverable, it was necessary to execute a supplemental plane-table triangulation to determine a sufficient number of new· points to properly control the topography, and this work first received attention. The wharf lines of New Bedford and Fairluwen and the shore line of Acu3hnet River were next delineated, as these were required for the use of the hydrographic party operating· in the same locality, and afterwards the principal streets of New Bedford were run out with the plane table so as to furnish the draftsmen of the party with the proper data for reducing and platting the city map. The regular detailed topography was then taken up and carried from l\Ioshers Point to Sconticut Neck, thus completi11g the first sheet. The second sheet was begun early in September, and on this also the interpolation of additional pointG was found necessary before the topography proper could be executed. The work was carried on continuously until October 30, when, in accordance with instructions, field operations ceased, the party was disbanded, and !\fr. Wainwright returned to Washington, D. C. The second sheet was by that date completed nearly up to l\fattapoiset Neck, leaving the portion between that point and Angelica Point for another season. The topographic features of this portion of the bay are described by Mr. Wainwright as consisting of a series of narrow and shallow valleys, running normal, or approximately so, to the coast line and ~eparated by narrow and low ridges, the latter in some cases projecting outward

several miles into the bay, forming peninsulas which are locally termed" necks." Owing to the small drainage area of any oue valley, the streams, with the single exception of the Acushnet River, are insignificant, and in a dry season like the_ past summer are very much shrunken and without perceptible current. In the vicinity of New Bedford the couutry is divided into small farms, aud these are divided and subdivided by stone dikes aud walls. From present indications, however, it seems probable that this characteristic form of fencing will soon disappear, as farmers in the vicinity of the new State highways now in process of construction have found it profitable to cart the stone to the crushers, and there dispose of it at so much per ton. Farther to the eastward the country is less open, and large, wooded areas exist, in which the maple and scrub oak predominate. Aloug the shores, at points exposed to current and wave action, there are fotmd evidences of slow erosion, in the existence of' shingle beaches aud outlying rocks; the inward bends and coves are skirted by salt marshes: upon which are scattered boulders transported thither from neighboring beaches by the winter ice during high storm tides. The valley near the mouth of which are located the city of New Bedford and tho villages of Fairhaven and Acuslmet, although the largest in the locality, has only a moderate drainage area and does not discharge an excessive amount of fresh water into the harbor, aud as its streams all pass through one or more lakes or ponds very little sediment reaches tide water. The changes in the harbor from this source are therefore very slow and gradual. The weather during tbe season was quite favorabll~ for field work, the rainfall being much below the average and generally occurring either at night or on Sundays, but the prevailing soutbwest winds occasionally blew with sueh strength that a temporary suspeusion of field work was necessary. All members of the party performed their duties very satisfactorily, but .Messrs. R. J. McAdory aud George Taylor receive especial commendation in l\Ir. 'Vain wright's report; the former served foreman and tbe latter as recorder and draftsman. The statistics of the season's work bave been tabulated, as follows:

During the winter and spring Assistant \Vainwright was engaged in inking bis sbeets and in the performance of miscellaneous office duties, and at the close of the fiscal year was preparing for field duty on the resurvey of Chesapeake Bay. l'opograpltical resurvey of Buzzards Bay, Ma~sachusetts.- Wareham and Sippican slteets.-To Assistant J. A. Flemer were assigned the two sheets embracing the upper part of the bay, and which for convenience may be designated as the Wareham and Sippican sbeets, tbe former embracing the area from .l\fonumet River on the east to Wareham Rivel' and vicinity on the west, and the latter from Wareham IUver to Angelica Point, the northern limit of Assistant Wainwright's upper sheet. Assistant Flemer began work on July 1 at Cohasset Narrows, and first completed the eastern section, or the country lying between Cohasset Narrows and l\Ionumet River. The paucity of recoverable trigonometric points for this work necessitated tbe measurement of a base aud the execution of a plane-table triangulation to give a sufficient number of points of control for the topography. A convenient site for the base was furnished by the bridge over Cohasset Narrows. The western half of the sheet was then completed, and the Sippican sheet was begun. Work continued without interruption until October 31, when, in accordance with instructions, field operations ceased, the party disbanded, and Mr. Flemer, with his aid, A. F. Zust, returned to Washington. About half of the second sheet was completed. The country in this vicinity is generally flat or rolling and well wooded, and the shores of the creeks and coves are marshy; the few prominent hills existing range from 90 to 120 feet in elevation, and are covered by a dense growth of timber

Topographic resu1"1;cy of Buzzards Bay, 11la1:1sa.chusctts.- lVcstport and Pridana1·am .~hects. To assistant Stehman Forney were assigned two lower prqjections, designated as the 'Vestport and Padanaram sheets, the former embracing t'he topography from Quicksand Point, Rhode Island, at the southwestern part of Buzzards Bay Entrance and near the boundary line between the States of Massachusetts and Rilode Island, to Slocum Neck, and the latter extending from Slocum Neck to Moshers Point, the soutilern limit of the New Beclfor<l sheet. The party was organized on .Tuly 1, and work was immediately begun on the upper or Padanarnm sheet. Here also, on account of the disappearance of the old triangulation stations, a new pla11e-table triangulation had to be executed before attempting to delineate the topographical features. The upper sheet was finished and the lower or Westport sheet al>0ut half completed before tlte close of the season on October 31. The width of the surveyed topography on the upper sheet is about 2~ miles, on the lower 1~ miles. The shores of this part of Buzzards Bay are roeky with occasional sand beaches, which furnish excellent bathing facilities, and the slopes near the i;:hore are thickly dotted with sum1ner hotels and private residences. Padanaram, Bay View, Xonquitt, Horse Neck Beach, Westport Point, and Westport Harl>0r nre pleasant and thriving summer resorts. Westport H.iver and its vVestern Branch are quite large streams, with () feet of water 011 their beds at low tide, and are navigable for vessels of small size for a distance of 5 miles from the mouth. i\Iessrs. William Bowie and Edgar H. Strobel served as recorders in tlte party, the former throughout the season, and the latter to Sept.ember 1. At the close of the season Assistant Forney returned to 'Vashington, and was engaged <luring the remainder of the fiscal year in inking his sheets and in the performance of miscellaneous office duty.

Topographical rcsw·vey of Buzzards Bay, 1lfassachusctt.~.- lVest Falmouth and Pocasset sheets.To Assistant W. I. Vinal were assigned the West Falmouth and Pocasset sheets, which embrace the shores of the bay and tho adjacent country from Great Sippowissett Creek, the northern boundary of the survey of 1890, to l\Ionumet River, tho southern boundary of the 1\fonumet sheet of this resurvey. Mr. Vinal organized his party ou July 1 at West Falmouth, and immediately began field operations. The same difficulties in recovering olcl stations of the former survey were experienced, and consequently the determination of new ones was necessary before the topographic delineation could be carried on. The regular topographic survey began July 10, and was carried on continuously until the latter part of October, when the party reached Pocasset River, thus completing the work to that limit, with the exception of a small area to the north and east of Cataumet Harbor. This portion and that from Pocasset Hiver to Monumet River were necessarily left for another season. The topograpby of this section does not differ essentially from that of the adjoining one. already described, and the principal features are thus enumerated by Assist.. ant Vinal: Sand and shingle beaches, alternating with strips of rocky shore; creeks; fresh and salt

water ponds; eroded grayel banks; bowlders; low sand dunes; tracts of marsh, some of which ha \'e been reclaimed for cranberry cultivation; open and village detail; summer resorts and residences; railroads; country roads, and roads not classified as public highways; wooded bills, etc. The accurate delineation of cleYatiou contours was in some places quite difficult on account of the underbrush and dense second growth of deciduous timber, and considerable cutting and trimming out was necessary. Along the shores are numerous detached and outlying rocks, and as many of these are visible only at low water, more than ordinary care was required in surveying ·he coast line. The small harbors along this part of the coast afford shelter from wind and sea for numerous pleasure yachts, but are seldom entered by trading vessels of any considerable size; the entrance to Hog Island (Chappaquoit) Harbor was buoyed for the first time in July of this year. At the close of the Buzzards Bay work Mr. Vinal, in accordance with instructions, transferred his party to Cohasset, Mass., and made a resurvey of the shore line from White Rock to Brush Island; he then disbanded the party and returned to Washington. Mr. H. S. Williams acted as recorder, and Messrs. J. J. Carlisle and H. B. ·Crutchfield as rodmen throughout the season, their services beiug entirely satisfactory. The following are the statistics of the season's work:

Assistant Vinal was engaged during the remainder of the fiscal year in inking his topographical sheets, and on wiscellaueous oflice duty, and at its close was preparing for the resumption of field. work on the Buzzards Bay resurvey. Hyd1·ographic resurrey of Buzzards Ba,y, JIIassachusctts.-Tlrn hydrographic party of the schooner Eagre, under the charge of Lieut. G. 0. Hanus, U. S. N., as stated in my last report, began the hydrographic imrvey of New Bedford Harbor and its approaches in May, 1895, and by the end of that fiscal year Jiau made good progress, a number of signals having been erected, and 341 miles of souudiugs run. Work was continued. without intermission during the present fiscal year until the middle of October, and after that date whenever the weather conditions would permit. The party remained in the field. throughout the winter, and some work was accomplished during each month, excepting January and February, tbe byclrography of New Bedford Harbor and its approacbes being completed on the 16th of April. The party was then engaged for a time on current and tidal observations, after which the vessel was moved to Marion, where preparations were tnade for the resurvey of the bead of Buzzards Bay. Five additional current stations, and nine comparative tidal stations, were occupied, and about 150 1:1ignals were erected and determined, after which the regular sounding work of the head of the bay began on May 14 and was continued Until the close of the fiscal year. During January and February, when no field work was possible, the vessel's boats were overhauled, the boilers of the steam launches were repaired, and such refitting as the Yessel required was attended to. Lieutenant Hanus's reports contain much valuable iuforwation relating especially to New Bedford Harbor, the various rocks, ledges, and other dangers to navigation being enumerated, and their exact positions given; be also gives the depth of water at each wharf along the water front, and furnishes statistics as to the tonuag·e and draft of vessels entering the harbor during the year. The aids to navigation, such as lights, buoys, ranges, and prowinent landmarks, were also carefully determined, and are likewise mentioned in detail in his descriptive report. For the New Bedford Harbor and approaches work a primary tide gauge was established on the sheltered side of the stone pier at Clark Point, and six secondary or staff gauges were located at convenient places as the work advanced, and frequently compared directly with the standard. The six secondaries were located as follows: 1. Upper Padauaram gauge near Sterns's Bathing Wharf (used for reducing soundings made at the upper harbor). 2. Lower Padanaram gauge near the coal wharf below the ,bridge (used only for comparison). 3. Nonquitt gauge near Ricketson's ·wharf in the village of Nonquitt (used only for comparison). S. Doc. 35--2

Belleville gauge halfway between the Coggeshall Street Bridge and head of the river, west side (mled for reducing soundings taken above tbe bridge). The hy<lrographic work in the vicinity of New Bedford is platted on three sheets, numbered 1, 1~, and 2, respectively; No. 1 includes New Bedford Harbor, Clarke Cove, and Padanaram Harbor; No. 1~ the .Acushnet River, and No. 2 the approaches to the harbor, this term being defined as embracing all the waters between Misnaum Point and West Island. The shore line and positions of determined points were furnished by the topographical party working in the vicinity. The statistics of the New Bedford work are as follows:

The following-named naval officers were attached to the party: Lieut. C. S. H.ipley, Ensign W. A. Edgar1 Ensign J. F. Hubbard, and Pay Yeoman William B. Proctor. Lien.tenant Ripley was detached from the vessel and the Coast and Geodetic Survey service October 15, and was succeeded by Ensign J. F. Hubbard. Toicn boundary line survey& of the State of Massachusetts, continued under the direction of the Topographical Survey Oomrnission of the Sta.te.-Assistant Henry L. "Whiting, during the fiscal year, continued to serve as chairman of the Topographical Survey Commission of the State of M.assaehusetts, and took personal charge of tbCI general management of the field and office work relating to the Town Boundary Survey. Three :field parties were engaged on the work-one under the charge of Mr. James B. Tolley in executing a secondary triangulation in the central and southern parts of the State; the second under the charge of Mr. Eugene E. Peirce in the southeastern part of the State, mainly in Bristol and Plymouth counties, determining new boundary lines formed by the subdivision of former townships; and the third under the charge of Mr. F. E. Bowman, on similar work in Barnstable County. The amount and detail of the work did not vary materially from those of former years, and about the same amount of office work was executed. As heretofore, the original dei;icriptions of the main triangulation stations, with sketches, their geographical positions, and other data necessary for the prosecution of the work, l1ave been furnished to the State Commission by the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office . .Assistant Whiting also continued to serve as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and attended the various meetings of that body during the year. The first meeting took place on November 5, 1895, at St. Louis, on board the U. S.S. Mississippi, and the semiannual inspection of the works of improvement immediately followed, the Commission adjourning on the 17th at New Orleans; the second meeting took place from January 9 to 11, inclusive, at New York; the third meeting occurred on April 16 at St. I~ouil'l, and the inspection of the high-water stage of th0

river followed, the Commission adjourniug at New Orleans ou the 22d; the fourth and last meeting took place at New York from June 16 to 22, inclusive. .After each of the inspection trips Assistant Whiting stopped. over at Washington for conference with the Superiutenden t, and at various times during the year tmbrnittecl such 1:ipecial reports as were required. Examination of a repm·ted da.nger to navigation in the harbor of Bristol, R. I.-In December, 1895, a notice was received at this office from Mr.Nathaniel G. Herreshoft~ of Bristol, RI., that a scow sloop, carrying a deck load of granite blocks, had capsized in the east channel of the harbor and dumped about 25 tons of the rock, thus creating a serious danger to navigation. Lieut. G. C. Hanus, who was engaged on the hydrographic resurvey of Buzzards Bay, was directed to investigate the matter and locate the obstruction on the chart. He proceeded at once to Bristol, taking with him one member of his crew, and after consultation with 1\fr. Herreshoff, who knew the approximate location of the accident, hired a boat, and, assisted by the keepers of the Bristol Ferry and :;\>Iuscle light-houses, made a careful examination. The whole vicinity indicated was sounded with the lead, and subsequently it was dragged over with a grapnel, but no trace of the stones could be found. The bottom was found to l>e very soft, and Lieutenant Hanus concluded that the heavy rock1> had deeply embedded themselves in the mud; he recommends, however, a further examination at a more favorable season of the year, as different persons with whom he afterwards conferred do not agree as to the location of the dumping. Ou the completion of the examination Lieutenant Hanus returned to New Bedford and resumed his duties as commander of the Eagre. Hydrographic surveys to the southwa·r<l of Block Island Sound. and o,ff' Jlontauk Point, and special examinations in Long Island Sound.-In July, 1895, the steamer .Endeavor, Lieut. L. M. Garrett commanding, made special hydrog·raphic examimttiomi in Davids Island Hal'lwr and along the north shore of Long Island Sound off Cornfield Point, Duck Island, and Kelsey Point, after which, early in August, the survey of the waters to the southward of Block Island Sound and the east end of Long Island was begun; the development of the outlying dangers in the vicinity of l\Ioutauk Point was also included in the plan of the season's operations. After the erection of the necessary signals at suitable points, and the establishment of tide gauges at Block Island Harbor and at Tuthills Wharf, Fort i~ond Bay, the work was prosecuted as rapidly as weather conditions would Permit until November 11, when the season closed. Much time was lost during the season on account of smoky or hazy atmosphere and wind, the former often interfering in otherwise good Weather on account of the distance of some of the lines from the shore and the consequent difficulty of seeing the signals. The work was left unfinished, but was again resumed in the spring of 1896, as.noted iu the next paragraph. The Endeavor returned to Baltimore, reaching that point November 19, and remained there throughout the winter, there being no appropriation remaining available for her employment on the Southern coast. The statistics of the season's work in the vicinity of Block Island Sound and Montauk Point, including the special examirmtious in Davis Island Harbor, and oft' Cornfield Point, Duck Island, and Kelsey Point, are as follows:
Area sur\·eyed, iu Hquare geographical miles................................................ 209 Number of miles (geographical) ruu while sounding........................................ 837 Number of angles measured...................................................... .. . . . . . ... 5 369 Number of soundings taken ................................................................ 15 353

The 'officers attached to the Endeavor during the season were the following: Lieut. L. 1\1. Garrett, commandiug officer; Lieut. John J. Blandin, Ensign C. 1\f. McCormick, Machinist J. C. Richards, Pay Yeoman C. Lee Green, and Writer Eugene Veith. Lieut. L. M. Garrett and Ensign C. l\1. McCormick were subsequently detached from the vess~l, and the former was succeeded by Lieut. W. S. Benson. It may also be mentioned that Lieutenant Garrett served at tl1e office as acting Hydrographic Inspector from November 4 to December 3, the command of the Endeavor meanwhile temporarily devolving upon Lieutenant Blandin. · Resumption of the hydrographic surveys to the southward of Block Island Sound and off Jlfontattk Point, in the spring of 189fi.-On l\fay 6, 1896, Lieut. W. s. Benson, U. S. N., assumed charge of

the steamer Endeavor, and on the 13th proceeded with the vessel to the vicinity of Montauk Point, arriving there on the 18th. The hydrographic survey of the waters to the south of Block Island Sound and in the vicinity of Montauk Point was at once resumed, the most favorable weather being devoted to tbe outer lines, and the work nearer shore being executed when the atmosphere was not sufficiently clear for seeing signals at long distances. Excellent progress was made to the close of the fiscal year, at which date the party was still in the field. A full report of the resuJts of the season's work will appear in the next annual report. The statistics to June 30 are as follows:

The officers now attached to the Endeavor are: Lieut. W. S. Benson, in command; Lieut. John J. Blandin, Pay Yeoman C. Lee Green, Machinist J.C. Richards, and Writer Elijah H. Phinney. Continuation of the topographical resurvey of the south shores of Long Island, New York.-At the close of the last fiscal year Assistant C. T. Iardella, under instructions dated June 10, had organized his party at Speonk, Long Island, and completed his arrangements for the continuation of the topographic resurvey of the south shore of Long Island, or more specifically, of that portion of the island lying to the north of Morisches, Quantuck, and Shinnecock bays. The actual shore line of these bays and of the outer beach, with a narrow fringe of topography, had been surveyed during the previous season. Field work began .July 1, the portion lying between Speonk and Harts Cove, where the previous year's work terminated, being first executed. The work was then continued eastward to the Shinnecock Hills, or about 2 miles beyond Canoe Place, where the Shinnecock Canal connects the waters of Shinnecock and Peconic bays. A 8trip of topography varying from a quarter of a mile to about 2 statute miles in width, and including a number of small towns, villages, and summer resorts, was executed, covering a total area of about 24 square miles. ·work closed October 30, and the party disbanded and returned to Washington. Aid Hugh C. Denson served in the party throughout the season and performed his duties in a very satisfa<ltory manner, receiving therefor the commendation of his chief. Mr. Iardella's report contains interesting geographical and historical information relative to the various localities embraced in the season's work, and is accompanied by a sketch showing the connection with previous surveys. The following is a statistical statement of the work accomplished:

The limits of the three topograpliical sheets may be generally stated as follows: Sheet No. 1, from Harts Cove to Quantuck Bay; sheet No. 2, from Quantuck Bay to Tianna Bay; sheet No. 3, from Tianna Bay to Shinnecock Bills. On his return to Washington, Assistant Iardella was engaged in inking his sheets and on other office work until again assigned to field duty. On Jun~ 16 he was directed to make preparations for the resumption of the Long Island work, but owing to the lack of funds was not able to take the field hefore the beginning of the new fiscal year. Gontinua.tion of the tidal record and the automatic tidal indicator at Port Hamilton, New Yorlc Harbor.-Tbe self-registering tide gauge at the Fort Hamilton tidal station, established in December, 1892, ha.s continued in successful operation throughout the entire fiscal year, and no break has occurred in the record.

was, through the kind cooperation of the officers of the United States engiueers stationed at the post, kept in successful operation throughout nearly the whole fiscal year; the record for March, 1896, however, was lost on account of ice, and early in June the series mis discontinued. The thanks of the office are due to Lieuts. R.R. Raymond and William H. Brown for attending to the gauge and transmitting the monthly records. Continuation of the topographic survey of the Hudson River (vicfoity of 11larlboro).-As stated in the Report for 1895, two topographical parties took the field at the close of that fiscal year for the continuation of the topographic survey of the Hudson River. The party of Assistant John vY, Donn began work at Prospect Hill i1lld first executed a subsidiary triangulation to determine a sufficient uumber of points of control for the topography. The topography was then executed, a strip averaging 1 mile in width being surveyed on both sides of the river to the line J\filtonCamelot, the southern limit of the work of the other party. On the west side of the river the topography was somewhat intricate and the contouring difficult, as vineyards covered the hillsides, and orchards to a large extent the valleys and low areas; on the eastern side the work was simpler, the chief difficulties being met in the parked inclosures and ornamental grounds of wealthy proprietors. The work continued without interruption until November 1, when in accordance with instructions the party was disbanded and Assistant Donn returned to vVashi11gton. The statistics of the work from July 1 to November 1 are given as follows:

The limits of the topographic sheets may be stated as follows: So. l, from l\Iud Hole to ::\Iarlboro; No. 2, from :Marlboro to Milton. Assistant Donn's subsequent services will be noticed elsewllere iu tllis report. Continuation of the topographic sun,cy of the H1tdsun River (vicin-it!J of I'o11gltkeepsic).-The party of Assistant W. 0. Hodgkins was organized at Poughkeepsie and began operations July 1. l\Iany of the old trigonometric stations conld not be recovered, and others had become useless on account of erection of buildings, growth of shade trees, etc., so that it was necessary to execute a subsidiary triangulation to furnish the requisite number of points for topographic use. The primary stations '' Vervalin" and "Lloyd" furnished a base for this work, and from it thirty-flxe new positions were determined. 'fhe topographical work was then taken up and continued to the eud of October, but the extreme beat of the summer and tile illness of several members of the party seriously retarded progress. The sheet worked upon included about 8 miles of the river, from Milton and Camelot stations northward to the sharp bend known as Crum Elbow. ·within these limits the shore line of both banks was run, together with the rail ways near each shore; the detailed topography on the east side between the shore and the "old post roa"cl" was completed from the southern edge of the sheet to the centre of Poughkeepsie. This margin is rather narrow in some places and will require wideuiug hereafter, but Assistant Hodgkins reports that the additional topography required is of a simple clmracter and can be rapidly delineated. The most striking feature of this locality is the terrace-like plateau, the western edge of Which is nearly straight for over a mile, with an almost uniform elevation of about 170 feet above high water; from this edge the ground slopes abruptly down from 40 to 100 feet and then extends in irregular undulations to the rocky and precipitous bluffs which border the river. This natural terrace affords delightful sites for numerous country seats. On October 31, in accordance with instructions, field operations ceased and the party was disbanded, bnt M1·. Hodgkins was engaged at Poughkeepsie on office work incident to l.iis field labors until November 19, when he proceeded to New York. He was then granted a short leave of abseuce, and on its expiration proceeded to Washington and reported at the office on December 6. b' Until April following, when he was again assigned to field duty, he was engaged in inking 18 topographical sheet and on miscellaneous office duty. His further services on the l\Iissouri

Establishment of a tidal indicator at Reedy I.~land, Dela11·a.1·e Rfrer.-The maritime interests of Philadelphia having secured an appropriation for the erection of a tidal indicator on the Delaware Hiver at Reedy Island, .Assistant ,T. F. Pratt was directed to draw up the plans and make all necessary arrangementfl for its construction. .l\Ir. Pratt Yisited the locality and selected the site, arranged for the necessary piling and supports, and afterwards, as chief of the instrument division, superintended the construction of tlie indicator at this oflice. In December, 1895, it was erected, and has since been working satisfactorily. It is located at the northern end of tlie ice breaker at Reedy Island Quarantine Stat.ion, and appears as a large white semicircle with feet arnl half feet shown by heavy black Jines, the foot divisions being numbered. A pointer, actuated by the rise and fall of the tide, indicates at any time the actual height of the tide above or below the plane of reference (mean low water), while an arrowhead in the center of the disk indicates wliethcr the tide is rising or falling. The fignreR, lines, pointer, and arrowhead can be readily seen with the aid of an ordinary marine glass at a distance of a mile, and the navigator is thus furnished with all ueccssary tidal information. Extension of the tra111wontinental arc easticr1rd to Cape8 1lfay and Henlopen.-Reconnaissa.nce and triangulation.-011 the 1st of April, 1896, Assistant F. 'V. Perkins, accompanied by Extra
Observer George A. Fairfield, proceeded to the eastem extremity of the great transcontinental arc for the purpose of executing a reconnaissance and primary triangulation eastward across Chesapeake an<l Delaware bays and the interYening })Ortions of th~ States of :Maryland and Delaware to capes .l\fay and Henlopen. This triangulntion will Rcrve not only as an extension of the arc near the tliirty-niuth parallel, but also as a connection of the .Atlautic Coast t1:iaugulatio11 with t.hat starting westward and southward from Fire Island base, and will form the basis of fnture topographical imn'e~'S of tbe States of ::\Iaryland an<l Delaware. Three stations of the 183-i work, ''Osborne's Huin,'' "Linstcd" an<l "Wehh," were found without difficulty, and snbsequently two others, ''Turkey Point" and "Finlay," were recovered. The reconnaissance, notwithstanding the difficulties incident to such work i11 a comparatively flat and wooded country, was completed by .l\Iay n, and resulted i11 the laying out of a yery satisfactory scheme of figures with Rides Yarying from 10 to 30 miles in length. Assistant Perkin s's report of the reconnaissance furnishes the following iuformation concerning the nature of the country traversed.
The western sborc of Delaware llay is low, generally a soft marsb of cousiclerable width, and the land risos gradually to the dividing riclgo near tho Delaware ancl l\Iarylancl bountlnr~-. whero it is from 70 to 80 feet nbon1 sen level. Spur ridges of about tho same ele,·ation branch out from this, running alJOnt we~t-sontbwest to tlie eastern shore of llfaryland, which is again Io"·· but rarely marshy. The western sboro of llfarylm11l is rolling country nucl runch ruoro heavily woodecl t.ban the peninsula, which is mostly in a high state of culth·ation.

A constmction party was then organized for the building of signals, heights of 120 feet being required at some points to overcome intervening obstructions. In the marshes of Delaware it was necessary to J1ave pile foundations, the piles being driven to the harder strata some 25 feet or more below the surfacP.. The signals on these foundations were subsequently found to be su~ject to troublesome vibrations. as were also the screw-pile light-houRes occupied on the bay, and the measurements of the angles there were consequently slow and difficult. It is believed, however, that with the care taken the results will prove entirely satisfactory.

The signal building had advanced sufficiently by l\fay 16 for the observations to begin, and at that date M:r. G. A. Fairfield commenced the occupation of Cape Henlopen Light-House. .A.ssh;tants \V. B. Fairfield aud John Xelson were subsequently assigned to the party, and the former began observations at Brandywine Shoal Light.Rouse on June 4, autl the latter at "Stone" station on the 18th. By the end of J·une the observations at " Cape Henlopen" and " Brandywine" stations were completed, and those at "Stone," "Cape l\Iay," and "Egg Island" were in progress. The party is still in the field, and a full account of its operations must therefore be deferred, but .A.ssistaut Perkins has furnished the following partial statistics, showing the results to the close of the fiscal year:

Continuation of the tidal record at the a11to111atic tide-gauge station at the United States NwvyYard, Washington, D. 0.-Tlre self-registering tide gauge established at the Washington Navy-

Yard tidal station in 1891 has been kept in operation throughout the eutire fiscal ;year, under tlle supervision of the chief of the tidal division of the office, and a coutinuous record llas been obtained. 1llagnetic observations in the Easten1, Middle, and So11thern Statcs.-At tbe close of tllc last fiscal year Assistant J, B. Baylor, who had been instructed to determine the magnetic declination,. dip, and intensity at various specified stations along the Atlantic seaboard had reached Nantucket, l\Iass. The work was continued in the present fiscal year until September rn, during 'vhich time complete magnetic observations, including the incidental astronomical observations for azimuth and time, were obtained at the following places: Nantucket (partially observed prior to July l); Provincetown and Cambridge, l\Iass.; Portland, Bangor, and Eastport, l\1e.; Providence~ R I.; New Haven, Conn.; New Brunswick, N. J.; Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pa.; aud Baltimore, l\Id. Mr. Baylor then returned to 'Vasl.Jingtou, and was engaged at the office in computing and reducing field observations until Jauuary, when he resumed field work. Observations of the magnetic declination, dip, aud intensity, aud tlle incidental determination of time, latitude, and azimuth were made between January 8 and April 8 at the following places: Donaldsonville, Cheneyville, Baton Rouge, and Amite, La.; Poplarville, Elhieldsboro, and .Mississippi City, Miss.; Mobile, Citronelle, Greenville, Montgomery, Selma, Eufaula., and Opelika, Ala.; and Rome, Ga. Atlanta, Ga, was also in the list of stations to be observed, but was omitted by Mr. Baylor for the reason that the required observations there were obtained in March by the telegraphic longitude party under Assistant G. R Putnam. On the completion of tlle magnetic work, Assistant Baylor again returue<l to "\Yashington, and during the remainder of the fiscal year was engaged on computations and reduction of field observations.

Bay and proceeded with the steamer Bache to the Dry Tortugas and made a special hydrogrnphic examination of the Southeast Channel and the deep-water anchorage. This was required by the Navy Department in view of the proposed use of Dry Tortugas as a coaling station for the larger vessels of the North Atlantic fleet during the contemplated drill in the Bay of Florida. For a full account of this work and its results, see under the head of "Special operations." Key West Fla: After completing the Tortugas work the Bache proceeded to Key \Vest and made a successful search for the rock on which the U. S. S. Raleigh struck in going to sea from that harbor on February 6, 1896. The obstruction is outside of the harbor and was found without great difficulty, notwithstanding the fact that its position was not as reported to this office. It was apparently of coral formation and of small area; the least depth found over it, when reduced to mean low water, was 15·9 feet, and all around it th~ lead showed 5 fathoms 01· more. The statistics of the Key West work, as given by Lieutenant Peck, are as follows:

Blackfish Bank, off Assateague Island, Virginia: In l\Iay, 18961 Lieut. R. G. Peck, while en route from the Gulf Coast to New York, made a hydrographic examination of the Rlackfish Bank off Assateague Island, Virginia, and found a shoal spot with only 3·2 feet at mean low water, where the chart showed nothing less than 3i: fathoms. The shoal covers an area about 300 metres in diameter, and on all sides the depths increased gradually to 5 fathoms. The great distance of this shoal from shore makes it a very serious danger to navigation, aud prompt notice of its existence was therefore given in our Notices to Mariners. The Light-House Board has since caused a can buoy to be placed to mark the locality. The statistics of the Blacktish Bank work are as follows:

Fenwick Islantl and Isle of Wight Shoals, :Maryland and Delaware: Lieutenant Peck also made special examinations of the Fenwick Island and Isle of Wight shoals and a smaller intermediate one, the results in each case being the finding of shoaler water than shown on the chart. The locations of the shoal spots were carefully determined, as was also the position of the Fenwick island Life-Saving Station. The statistics of the work are as follows:

Ocean City, .i\Icl.: Lieutenant Peck, while engaged ou the above work, was iuformed of the existence of a dangerous shoal spot, about 3 miles ~E. ~ E. of Ocean City and lt miles from shore, on which the keeper of the Ocean City Life-Saving Station had recently seen a passing schooner strike. An examination re·sultetl in the confirmation of the report, and the finding of a depth of llk feet, where the chart showed 3q fathoms. Its position was carefully determined, and as promptly as possible the information was published in Notices to Mariners. On the completion of the above examination the Bache proceeded on her way to New York, arriving there on )fay 30. .11.1tomatic tidal recm·d at Fort Snmter, Charleston Harbor, South Oarolina.-The officers of the Corps of Engineers, U.

improvement, but the originals are finally deposited in the archives of this Survey. During the fiscal year the continuous records from March 17, 1894, to March I, 1896, have been received by this office. Hy<lrogn1phic resiirtey of Port Royal Entrance, So1tth Carolina.'-After undergoing repairs and refitting at Baltimore, the steamer Bl<tke, under the command of Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N., sailed 011 the 21st of January for Port Royal, S. C., for the purpose of executing a hydrographic resurvey of the entrance to that harbor, and arrived there on the 27th, a detention of three days at Hampton Roads lmving occurred on account of stress of weather. The preparations for the work were at once begun, but considerable delay occurred on account of the diiiicnlty of finding a sufficieut number of the old triangulation points or hydrographic stations, the great hurricane and tidal wave of 189a llaving destroyed and obliterated most of them. Two triangulation points and two hydrograpbic stations were eventually found, and from these and the Martins Industry Light Vessel the requisite number of auxiliary points were determined. Subsequently, on account of the long distances and the consequent imperfect visibility of shore signals, it was found necessary to erect water signals on the bar, and tbis was a work of considerable difficulty on account of prevalent strong winds and rough seas. These conditions of wind and sea also interfered seriously with the hydrographic survey o·f the shoaler parts of the entrance, as boat work was rarely practicable and the Blake's draft precluded her use in the shallow water. The channels, however, were carefully surveyed, anu the unfinished portions will be taken up another season. The sounding work was carried on wheuever practicable from March 3 to June 20, at which latter date the season closed and the Blake returned to Xew York to prepare for her summer's work on the New England coast. On the 20th uf April Lieutenant-Commanuer Colb·y was detached from the Blake and proceeded to \Vashington for the purpose of assuming the duties of Hydrographic Inspector, the command of the vessel meanwhile devolving on Lieut. John A. Shearman until :May 25, when Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, who had been assigned to the command of the vessel, arrived. The season's report was made by the latter, and contains much valuable information, not only in regard to changes in the channels, shoals, etc., but also in relation to tides and tidal currents, anchorages, meteorological conditions, etc., and important statistics affecting commerce. It may be mentioned that at the naval station in this harbor is located the only dry dock on the Atlantic Coast of the United States that can accommodate our first-class battle ships, and this fact makes Port Royal Entrance a very important one from a military point of view, and emphasizes the necessity of having thorough surveys and keeping the published charts up to date. The stath1tics of the season's work are given as follows:

The naval officers attached to the party uuring the season were as follows: Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby, in command until April 20; Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, in command from May 25; Lieut. John A. Shearman; Ensign A. T. Long; Ensign ,J. II. Reid; Ensign H . ..A. Wiley; P.A. Surg. C. )I, De Vallin; Pay Yeoman \V. S. Crosby. Establi.~ltment of a tidal .~tation at J>m·t Roya.7, R. C.-In l\Iarch, 1896, Assh;tant E. B. Latham, in accordance with instructions, and on the completion of similar duties in Texas, proceeded to Port Royal, S. O., for the purpose of establishiug a tidal station at that place. A Stierle self· registering gauge was set up in the boathouse of the naval station and a staff gauge was also conveniently placed. Three bench marks were also established for future reference and for Yerif'ying, from time to time, the constancy of position of tlle gauges in elevat.ion. After installing an observer and instructing him iu 11is duties, Mr. Latham, on April 11, returned to Washington and was assigned to office duty. Subsequently he was a!:lsigned to field duty on the Salina base measure, under the direction of Assistant F. D. Granger~ as mentioned further on under the bead of the "Transcontinental geodetic work in Kansas."

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The tidal station, under the charge of the observer, B. ,V. V\T eeks, was still in operation at the close of the fiscal year. Telegraphic longitude determinations and incidental latitude, magnetic and gravity determinations in various States.-In the. early part of February, 1896, Assistants C. H. Sinclair and G. R. Putnam, in accordance with instructions, resumed the determination of telegraphic differences of longitude, the former having charge of the main party and the latter of the cooperating one. The lines first required were: Cliarleston, S. C., to Key 'Vest, Fla.; Atlanta, Ga., to Key West, Fla.; Atlanta, Ga., to Little Hock, Ark.; Charleston, S. C., to 'Vashington, D. C. Subsequently the following lines were added t-0 the programme: "Washington, D. C., to Cambridge, Mass.; Washington, D. C., to Ithaca, N. Y.; Cambridge, Mass., to Ithaca, N. Y.; old Naval Observatory, \Vashington, D. C., to Coast and Geodetic Survey Observatory, Washington, D. C. The parties took up the lines in the order named, Assistant Sinclair proceeding to Charleston and Assistant Putnam to Key ·west. At Charleston the granite pier of 1880, uear the cast end of the citadel, was found undisturbed and a small wooden observatory was erected over it. At Key West the old pier of 1872 had disappeared, but by measurements to the reference marks its position was recovered; a uew site was, however, selected in the grounds of the custom-house, and the pier and wooden observatory.· constructed. The new and old stations were then connected l>y a small triangulation. Time signals were exchanged l>etween Charleston and Key \Vest on the nights of February 11, 12, 18, rn, and 20, and again, after the usual interchange of observers, on February 25, 26, 27, 2!), and l\Inrch 1. Assistant Sinclair also determined the latitude at both stations; at Charleston l>y sixty-six observations on sixteen pairs of stars during five nights, using zenith telescope No. 6, mounted on a wooden stand; and at Key \Vest by eighty-four observations on twenty-one pairs of stars during five nights, using the same instrument mounted on a pier built of brick laid in cement. Assistant Putnam determined the magnetic declination, dip and intensity at the Key West station by three days' obsen·ations, and also made pendulum observations at both stations for the determination of the force of gravity. On the completion of the Charlestou to Key \Y' est line Assistant Putnam moved the Charleston outfit to Atlanta, Ga., the other party remaining at Key 'Yest. The pier of 1880 in the capitol grounds at Atlanta was found still preserved, and the station was soon ready for occupation. Time signals were exchanged between the two stations on the nights of March 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14, and again, after interchange of' observers, on l\Iarch 20, 21, 25, 26, and 27. Magnetic and gravity determinations were also made at Atlanta l>y .Assistant Putnam. l\Ir. Putnam then moved the Key West outfit to Little Hock, Ark., the other party remaining at Atlanta. The Little Hock pier of 18!)3 in the custom-house grounds had disappeared, but its foundation was recovered without difficulty and a new pier was erected upon it. Time signals were exchanged between Little Hock and Atlanta on the nights of April 2, 4, 5, 7, and again, after the interchange of observers, on April 10, 11, 13, and H. Meanwhile, as opportmiity offered, magnetic and gravity determinations were made at Little Rock by Assistant Putnam. Ill all cases the latitude, magnetic and gravity observations were so arranged as not to interfere with or delay the longitude work. On the completion of the line, Atlanta to Little Hock, the instrumental outfits were moved to Charleston, S. C., and \Vashington, D. C., respectively, fhe station at the latter place being the one in the grounds of the old )faval Observatory. Observations were obtained and time signals exchanged on the nights of April 21, 22, 26, and 28, and again, after interchange of observers, on J\Iay 3, 4, 6, and 7. This completed the line, Charleston to \Vashington, and Assistant Sinclair then mo\·ed the Charleston instruments to Cambridge, Mass., where the old station was reoccupied. Time exchanges between \Vashington and Cambridge took place on the nights of May 14, 16, 17, 27, and 2!), and again, after interchange of observers, on June 1, 2, 5, 10, 12, and 17. \Vhile this work was in progress signals were also exchanged with the Cornell Engineering School at Ithaca, N. Y., by the ol>servers at l>oth eudi:i of the line, Prof. E. A. Fuertes having requested this cooperation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the determination of the longitude of the Cornell station, and furnishing the observer for the third point. As far as practicable, the same stars were observed at the three stations, and the telegraphic circuit was so arranged, with a side repeater in New York, that time signals seut from either station were simulfaneously recorded at the other two. Time signals were exchanged l>etween Cambridge and Ithaca

on the nights of May Hi, 17, 19, 22, 23, ood 27 with Mr. Sinclair at Cambridge, and on June 1, 2, and 3 with Mr. Putnam at Cambridge; also between Washington and Ithaca on May 15, Hi, 17, and 27 with Mr. Putnam at 'Vashington, and on June 1 and 2 with l\1r. Sinclair at Washington. The observations·at Ithaca throughout the series were made by Prof. ,John F. Hayford, of Cornell Universit:y, formerly an assistant of the Coast; and Geodetic Suryey. Subsequently he came to Washington for the purpose of observing with Messrs. Sinclair and Putnam for personal equation, as no interchange of obseryers took place between Ithaca and the other stations. The line Cambridge to "'\Vashington being completed, the instruments at tlie former place were brought to the observatory in the grounds of the Coat>t and Geodetic SmTey Office, and Messrs. Sinclair and' Putnam then began the determination of the difference of longitude of that station anrl the one in the grounds of the old Naval Observatory. This work was incomplete at the close of the fiscal year, but observations and time signal exchanges were obtained on the nights of June 22, 26, 28, 29, 30, and July 1. On account of the proximity of the two stations the method of operation was considerably modilied, it being sometim<'s practicable on the same 11ight to secure observati011s a111l time excl1anges, then an interchange of observers, and finally additioual obsenations and time exchanges; on other occasions a large number of stars were observed and more frequent time exchanges made, lmt without interchanging observers. The general plan was to excbang·e signals during each time set of ten stars, as Yery nearly tbe middle time coulu be selected for this purpose, and thns the results wonhl be rendered independent, or nearly so, of chronometer rate, bnt partially cloudy weather interrupted the observations to such an extent that a considerable mo<lification of the plan was unavoidable. After July 1 the work had to be 8Uspe11ded, as l\I r. Putnam was detached from tlie party for the purpose of accompanying the Green laud exploring expedition, and 110 otl1er observe1· was then available to tak1~ his place. It was dnring the progress of this work at Vi?asllington that the personal equation observations above referred to "\'l"ith Professor Ilayford were made. This was done by two methods: First, by noting transits of stars over half the lines in the diaphragm, the three observers leading in turn; and, second, by observing the same time sets, recording them on the same chronograph, with the same chronometer, but each observer using his own instrument. The time intervals were such that the rec·ords did not interfere, and very accordant results were obtained by both inethods. It should also he mcmtioned that dnring the progress of the longitude observations at Cambridge the mngnetic declination, dip and intensity were determine<! at South Boston, l\Iass., and 011 their conclusion at Newport, R I., by Assistant Putnam; three days' observations were made at each place. He also, while at Washington, made observations for the redetermination of the periods of tbe pemlnlnms used at the Soutbern stations. Complet·ion of the h.11ilrographic rc.mrrcy of Pensa.cola Bay and Entrance, Plorida.-In December, 18V5, Lieut. Hobert G. Peck, commanding the steamer Rache, was directed to resume tbe 11ydrographic resurvey of Pensacola Bay and Entrance, and accordingly left NPw York on the flth of January, 1896, and reachPd Pensacola on the 29th, haYing stopped en route at the following places: At Saudy IIook for twenty-fonr hours, in consequence of ~tormy weather; at Hampton Hoads for two days for the pnrpose of receiving on board the members of tlie Coast Pilot party, also bound for Pensacola; at Charleston for five days to make a special h~'drographic examination and obtain a whale boat stored there two years previously, aud at Key ·west for tliree days on account of bad weather. 'l'he work in Pensacola Bay and vicinity embraced the connection of tl1e recent byrlrography of the Coast and Geod~tic Survey with that of tbe United States engineers co,·ering the bar and e11trance, and sncl1 sea connections as rnig-ht he found necessary; in addition to this, Lieutenant Peck was also directed to make a comprehensive system of tidal comparisons over the whole field of work coyered by the resurvey, in order to establish a uniform plane of reference for the reduction of all soundings and to relate our work to that of the -United States engineers, 'l'he field work was at 011ce commenced and continued to February 26, when a temporary suspe11sion was necessary in c011seque11ce of a request from the Navy Department for an immediate hydrograpliic examination of the Dry Tortugas Anchorage, togetlier with its approaches, preliminary to its use as a coaling station for tlie larger vessels of the North Atlantic Squadron dnring the contemplate<l drill in the Bay of Florida. On tlie completion of this duty the Bache proceeded

to Key West and made a special examination near the·entrauce of that harbor, after which she returned to Pensacola Bay and resumed her regular work on ::\'larch 30. The resurvey of Pensacola Bay au<l vicinity, including a special examination of shoals in East Bay, was fi11ally successfully completed on the 18th of April and the Baclte left for the north on the 27th, stoppiug en route at various places aloug the .Atlantic Coast for special examiuations, which have been ~oticed in a previous page of this report, and for a few hours at the sea spring off Matanzas Inlet, coast of Flo1-ida, for the purpose of collecting specimens of the water for the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and finally arrived at New York ou May 30.

The following-named officers were attached to Lieutenant Peck's party: Lieut. E. H. 'l'illman; Ensigns H.K. Hines, A.H. Davis, and F. J\L Russell; P.A. Snrg. B. R. Stitt; Machinist .A. J. l\Iiskimon; Pay Yeoman .J. L. Dunn, draftsman, and Master-at-Arms Thomas S. l\fartin, .observer and recorder. Seaman Johu Craig also served as recorder. Continuation of the triangufa.tion of the oblique arc in Aliibama.-The resumption of the oblique arc work in Alabama by Assistant I<'. Walley Perkins was noticed in the Report for 1895, and an account of the progress made to the close of the last fiscal year was there given. Early in July, 1895, preparations for the occupation of the triangulation stations were completed, lights posted at the necessary points, and the light keepers engaged and instructed in their duties. Observations were begun at "Red Bill" on the 21st of J nly and the station was completed on the 24th. The camp was then moved to "Dean," and that station was also com· pleted by the eud of the month. l\Ir. G ..A. Fairfield, extra observer, joined tlie party early in .August, and was detailed to iuakc observations at "Creagh" and "White," while Assistant Perkins was occupying "Coon" and ''Pollard;" the parties were then transferred to "Fatama" and "Midway," respectively, and all these stations, together with "Lookout Hill," were finished by :X ovember. Owing to the exhaustion of the allotment,. observations commenced at "Cold Creek" 011December1 were not completed. · lu the early part of the season some time was necessarily lost iu reopening lines, as the growth of trees is very rapid at that time of the year, and throughout the season the usual delays incident to observing through narrow lanes cut through timber were experienced. U11til the latter part of September the atmospheric conditions were very favorable, but about this time the rains cetised, fires started in various directions, and the atmosphere soon became hazy and smoky, so that duriug the remainder of the season the longer Iinei; of the scheme could ouly be observed on rare occasions. ·while the ouscr\·ations above noted were in progress a building party under the direction of Foreman Jasper S. Bilby was engaged in constructing aml erectiug additional signal towers, and by December G three-viz, '' Daphue," "Spring Hill," aud "St. Elmo"-were completed. They have each a Leight of 120 feet, and their co11struction allll erection occupied only twenty-two working days, including tlie time spent in packing and 111ovi11g- the party from point to point; the six signals, varyiug in height from 80 to 120 feet, compl~ted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year, have already been n'lentionc<l in the Heport for 1895. These 1iiue tripods and scaffolds are probably the best ever constructed for similar work, a11d as they have been built in less time and with a smaller force than heretofore considered necessary, the superiority of l\Ir. Perkins's Rystem ancl method seems to be demonstrated. On. the completion of the signal buil<ling work, arrangements were made for the storage of the instruments and camp outfit, and the party disband.eel December 15. Assistant Perkius highly comwends the sen·ice of l\lr. George A. Fairfiel<l, am] refers to his exceptional powers as u. skillful and accurate observer. He also reports th;lt ~ll'. RB. Derickson, who aetecl as recortler in the party from August 10 to the close of the seaso11, l'e11dered valuaule and efficie11 t s~rvice. Asi>istant Perkins concludes, from this season's and former experieuce, that in this seceion of

the connt1·y favorable conditions for observing over long lines prevail from :March until the middle of September. These limits may vary somewhat in different years, but generally speaking, the working· i,wason, so far as actual observing is concerned, should be confined within them.

The further services of Assistant F. W. Perkins and Extra. Observer George A. Fairfield are noticed elsewhere in this report. Hydrographic examinations along the Gulf coasts of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and collection of information for the Coast I'ilot.-In the latter part of December, 1895, Ensign Glennie Tarbox, U.S. N., was directed to proceed to Miltou, Fla., where the schooner Tra.n~it was laid up, and organize a party on that vessel for the purpose of examining the various parts of the Gulf Coast of the United States, collecting such information as was necessary for the publication of the Coast Pilot for that region, and verifying the miscellaneous information already in our possession received from various sources. Early in the following month, accompanied by Mr. Jplm Ross, of the Coast Pilot division, Ensign Tarbox proceeded to Hampton Roads, and there took passage for Pensacola on the steamer Bache, which was bound for the same port. On arriving there a crew was enlisted and the Transit was soon prepared for service. Leaving Pensacola 011 the 11th of February, the party proceeded eastward through Santa Rosa Sound and examined the whole south and west coasts of Florida as far as the mouth of the Caloosahatchee Hiver, stopping eu route for the collection of local information and the noting of landmarks, aids to navigation, ~aili11g- directions, ranges, etc., at the following places: Ganiiers Bayou, Choctawhatchee Bay, St. Audrews Bay, Apalachicola Bay and Rh·er, East Pass, Cedar Reys, Port 'l'ampa, Palmetto (Manatee Hiver), Gasparilla Island, Punta Gorda, Peace Rfrer, Pine Island Sound, and Sau Carlos Bay. Owing to adverse winds the Caloosa River could not be entered without risk of too much delay, a1Hl on April 12 the return trip was begun. The Anclote Reys were examiued, and after touching again at Cedar Keys the Transit proceeded to Mobile Bay and then continued the cruise westward in the same manner through Mississippi Sound, Lake Borgne, the Rigolets, and Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans, stopping en route at Pascagoula. Returuiug eastward again, Biloxi, Ship Island Anchorage, and Hom h;land Anchorage were vsited, and the season's work finally closed at Pensacola on l\Iay 12. The 1'rnnsit was again laid up at Milton in charge of a ship keeper, the crew was discharged, and Messrs. Tarbox a11d lloss returned to V\7 ashington and resumed their duties in the Coast Pilot divisio11. During thi!'l cruise the Transit ran about 2 000 miles, and visited every point of any commercial importance within the limits above given; the best local authorities were interviewed and much Valuable information was collected. Vllhen running along shore or entering or leaving harbors special attention was paid to noting natural and artificial features which would assist the mariner, and wherever practicable the schooner was run in the principal channels upon the lines followed by the larger class of vessels. Ensign Tarbox's report points out numerous changes in the topography and hydrography of some of the localities visited, and these will at once be indicated on the charts affected .. In some cases, however, resurveys seem t-0 be demanded. llfagnetic observations at 1'arious 110int.~ in the Central and Nortluccste1·n States.-Iu l\Iarch, 1896, Assistant R. L. Faris was instructed to make determinations of the magnetic elements at various points in the Central and Northwestern States, and took the field for this purpose on April 15, beginning operations at Williamsburg, Ky. The observations for mag·netic declination, dip, and

30

intensity were made at each station 011 oue or two days, according to the requirements, together with the necessary astronomical observations for time, latitude, and azimuth; the longitudes were determined chronometrically. The following is a list of stations completed by the close of the fiscal year: Williamsburg, Lexi11gton, and Louisville, Ky.; Vincennes, I 11d.; Sandoval, 111.; St. Louis, l\fo.; Norfolk, Newport, and Chadron, N el>r.; Yanktou, l\Iitcbell, Pierre, and Aberdeen, S. Dak.; Jamestown a11d Dickiuson, N. Dak.; Glendive, Miles City, Forsytb, Billings, Bozeman, Townsend, Helena, Cascade, aud Fort Benton, l\Iont.-in all, twenty-four stations. As mauy of these belong properly to the Middle and Western divisions, tbey will be again referred to under those beads. All stations were so selected as to lie free from local artificial disturbing causes, and were carefully marked, and tbeir descriptions bave ueen filed in the archives of the Survey for future reference. Tbe party was still in the field and the magnetic survey in progress at the close of tbe fiscal year, and the results for tbe remainder of the season will therefore appear in my next report. Geodetic operations.-Continuation of the triangulation -in northeastern Tennessee and southeastern Kentucky, and along the J(entucky, Yirginia, coul Tennessee State lines.-At the close of the last fiscal year the party under the charge of Prof. A. H. Buchanan was already in the field and had made some progress on the extension of the Tennessee triangulation. ~arly in July the vicinity of "Hogers" station was revisited, and some days were spent iu making the necessary observations and measurements to connect the ohject ouserved upon from "Damascus" station with "Rogers," the signal at the latter place having l>eeu destroyed. Camp was next moved to "Benn" station, and on account of rai1i and fog the observations there were not completed until .August 20. The party then moved to "Poore" station, aud here also was delayed by rain aud fog, but all the observations required were obtained by September 18. The next camping site 'was in the vicinity of "Buffalo" station, and the obsel'vations made at this station completed the work laid out and were finished by October 2. Profossor Bnchana11 then disbanded party, in accordance with instructions, and returned to his home at Leuanon, Tenn. The results of the season are as follows:

Welker was directed to proceed to Pensacola, l~la., where the schooner Quick was laid up, and organize a party for the survey of Lake Pontchartrain. l\Ir. Welker reached Pensacola on the 6th of January, 1896, an<l by the 14th the vessel was ready for sea, an<l started for Lake Pontchartrain, reaching the working ground on January 20. The remainder of the month was spent in making a reconnaissance and in deciding upon a practicable scheme for executing the work. Owing· to the flatness of the country and the great width of the lake the ordinary methods of triangulation would have been very expensive, as signals of great height would have been required and the opportunities for the accurate obs~rving of such long lines would have been comparatively infrequent. Neither could a smaller scheme of triangles and quadrilaterals along the shores be resorted to on account of the immense amount of cutting required, the country in the vicinity of the lake being for the most part densely wooded and swampy, the cypress swamps in some sections extending to the water's edge. The cutting of innumerable lines through these heavily timbered swamps would probably have entailed even a greater expense than carrying the larger scht!me of figures across the lake. It was decided, therefore, to build signals from 18 to 40 feet in height at suitable intervals along the shores and to erect temporary signals in the shallow waters, from 2 to 3 miles from ·shore. The shore signals were occupied and observed from in the usual manner, the angles at the water stations being all concluded. Iu this way triangulation, sufficiently accurate for the future topographic and hydrographic surveyd, was obtained at a reasonable cost. The season's work began at the Pontchartrain Light-House, that being the only determined point of the old triangulation of the eastern.end of the lake that could be found. .A base line 733·28 metres in length was measured at West End, a suburb of New Orleans, about 4 miles west of the above-mentioned light-house, and the azimuth of the line was determined astronomically. This base lino and azimuth aud the determined latitude and longitude of the light·house constituted the data upon which the trigo110metric survey is based. Satisfactory progress was made with the work, notwitstandiug the difficulties arising from the unstable foundations on which the observing tripods and scaffolds were built, which necessitated the suspension of observations whenever the wind blew with any considerable streugth. The scheme of triangulation was laid out all the way round the lake to Raggedy Point, the junction point with the old work, but the observations were only completed to Shanty Point, or a little more than half the distance reconnoitred. Observations were also made for magnetic declination whenever practicable without delaying the trigonometric work. Assistant John Nelson, Aid Charles C. Yates, and Recorder G. W. Nelson were attached to the party during the season and rendered valuable and efficient service. 'Work closed on the 17th of April, and after disbanding party and making suitable provision for the care of the vessel, Assistant Welker and Messrs. Nelson, Yates, and Nelson returned to Washington.

l\fr. 'Velker states in his report that tlrn country surrouudiug Lake Pontchartrain is almost entirely of a marshy or swampy character; along the southern shore there is a belt from 1to3 miles wide of soft marsh covered with grass and weeds 10 to 12 feet high and with scattering willows from 10 to 40 feet high; back of this belt are immense cypress swamps. On the northwest and northern shores, as far as Chefuncte RiYer, the cypress swamps extend 11early or quite to the shore line, and in this locality water J1avigation within 2 miles of shore is dangerous on account of the numerous snags and sunken trees. He also experienced some difficulty on account, of the heavy seas produced by the prevailing easterly winds. These wi11ds have a clear, m1interrupted sweep of 40 miles, and when fresh or strong render landings on the west shore impracticable. The statistics of the season's work are given as follows:

Assistant 'Velker's services on the Alaskan Boundary Survey and ou the transcontinental triangulation will be mentioned in their ap1)ropriate 11laces elsewhere in this report. Dctermin<ttfon of tlte telegraphic d·ifferencc of longitude between Austin, Tex., and New Orleans, La., and incidental magnetic and gravity determinations.-At the close of the last fiscal year the parties engaged in the telegraphic determinations of longitudes in various Southwestern States had reached Austin, Tex., and New Orleans, La., respectively, and had obtained three nights' observations and exchanges of time signals. Work was then temporarily suspended, pending the arri\ral of Assistant A. T. Mosman, who had been detailed to relieve Assistant Edwin Smith, whose connection with the Survey ceased on June 30. Assistant Mosman arri\·cd at New Orleans on .July 2, and was joined there by Assistant Putnam on the 4t!J. After readjusting the instruments observations were made for personal eq1rntiou the same night, and l\Ir. Putnam returned on the following day to Austin. Exchanges of signals between New Orleans and Austin were obtained on the nights of July 8, 13, 14, and 15, and again after the usual interchange of observers on the nights of July 23, 24, 26, and 28. The weather at New Orleans was very unfavorable, seven consecutive nights being cloudy and preventing observations, while the sky at Austin was clear on all of them save one. l\Ir. G. A. Fairfield, extra observer, was assigned to Assistant l\fosman's party, and arrived at New Orleans on July 14. He remained with .l\lr. Mosman to the close of the work, and was subsequently transferred to Assistant Perkin's party in Alabama. Magnetic observations were made by Assistant Putnam at New Orleans on July 19, 23, and 24, and pendulum observations for the determination of gravity on the 24th and 25th, the observations being so arranged as not to interfere with or delay the longitude work. Messrs. Mosman and Putnam then returned to Washington, and soon after took the field ag~ti11 iu tlie Northeast. Their work there belonging geographically to the Eastern Division, will be treated of under that head. Tidal record at Port Eads, La.-Throngh the courtesy of the United States engineer officers stationed at Port Eads, La., we have beeu enabled to secure from the automatic tidal record of that station a tabulation of the hourly ordinates for the calendar year 1895. Establishment of a tidal station at Point Isabel, 1'exas.-Early in March, 1896, Assistant E. B. Latham·, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to Point Isabel, Texas, for the purpose of establishing there a tidal station. A Stierle self-registering gauge was set up in the Brazos Island Light-House, and a staff gauge was also located. These were referred to permanent bench marks, three of which were located on Padre Island and four on the mainland. A tidal observer was engaged, and after fully instructing him in his duties Mr. 1~atham proceeded, on March 19, to Port Royal, S. C. The establishment of a tidal station at the latter point has been mentioned in a previous part of this report, under the proper geographical heading. The Brazos Isla1 d tide station was discontinued June 2G, as the range of tide was fou11d to IJe only about half a foot.

Telegraphic l1>ngitude determination of Little Rock, Ark., and incidental magnetic and grat ity determinations.-In April, 1896, Assistants C. H. Sinclair and G. R. Putnam determined the telegraphic difference of longitude between Little Hock, Ark., and Atlanta, Ga., and incidentally determined all:lo the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity nud the relative force of gravity. For a full account of this work see nuder the head of "Telegraphic longitude determinations," Eastern section. Transcontinental geodetic work.-Reconnaissance, triangulation, and base-line measurement in llansas.-Early in October, 1895, Assistant F. D. Granger, having completed the primary triangulation assigned to him in Colorado, as fully described under the head of "Geodetic work in tl1e Western Division," transferred his party and outfit to Salina, Kans., and began a careful reconnaissance for the selection of a suitable site for a base line in the vicinity of the line Wilmer-Taylor. This reconnaissance was completed November 1, and resulted in the selection of a base G·5 kilometres in length in the valley of the Salina River, between the towus of Salina and New Cambria. Owing to the lateness of the season no further work could then be done, and in accordance with instructions the party was disbanded and Assistant Granger returned to Washington, where he was engaged in working up the results of his Colorado work and on miscellaneous office duty until April following, when he was directed to resume field operations in Kansas. Assistant Granger reached Salina on the 17th of April, and immediately began preparations for the geodetic connection of the proposed base line with the existing triangulation. Signals were erected at Iron Mound, North Pole Mound, Vine Creek, West Base, and East Base, the latter two being the termini of the base, and on May 4 the regular observations began at West Base. That station was completed by May 12, three primary and several tertiary points having been observed !!pon from an elevation of the theodolite of 20 feet, and the party was then transferred to Iron Mound, wbere observations were finished on the 22d. At that point the theodolite had an elevation of only feet, and three primary and a number of tertiary objects were observed upon. East Base was next occupied, the elevation of the instrument being 35 feet, and tbe observations there were concluded on the 31st. Tlie next point, North Pole Mound, the last one in the base fignre requiring occupation, was originally selected as an interior station in the quadrilateral Vine Oreek-Iron Mound-Heath-Thompson to provide for the contingency of the failure of one of the diagonals of that figure, and was observed upon from Vine Creek and Iron l\found in 1890, and from Heath and Thompson in 1891, but bad never been occupied. Preparations for its occupation were finished by June 4, and all the necessary observations, on six: primary stations and four tertiary objects, were obtained by the 10th. The elevation of the theodolite at this station was 24·5 feet. While the observations at North Pole Mound were in progress, Assistants A. J,, Baldwin and E. B. Latham, who had been assigned to Assistant Graham's party early in June, were engaged ill clearing and grading the base line and prepariug it for rneasurenie11t. Assistant W. 0. Hodgkins also reported for duty in the party on June 16, but owi11g 1o a severe attack of rheumatism, was unable to take an active part in the field work until the 23d. The preparation of the line was completed under Assistant Granger's direction on June 18, and on the following day the actual base measurement was begun, and was i11 progress at the close of the fiscal year. A full account of the preparation and measurement of the Salina base line and the special services performed by each member of the party, will appear in the next anuual report. The statistics of the Kansas work, exclusive of base measurement, to June 30 are as follows.:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Transcontinental geodetic icork.-Examination of a proposed base line in Missouri.-In May,1896, Assista11t A. 'L. Baldwin, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to Versailles, l\fo., for the purpose of examining the base line previously selected in that vicinity, with a view to determining its practicability. This base line was one of those intended for verification of the transcontinental triangulation, audits ends bad already been connected therewith, but the actual measurement had been postponed from time to time for various reasons, chiefly on account of insufficient appropriations. Mr. Baldwin found the terminal marks undisturbed, and ran over the base with a lcYel, but found that three barns had been constructed directly on the line. Owing to this circumstance and the existence of other difficulties, which it was thought would make the measure of the base unduly expensive, it was decided to abandon the line, and :Mr. Baldwin was notified to that effect by telegraph. Be was then directed to proceed to Salina, Kans., and report to Assistant F. D. Granger for duty in the transcontinental geodetic party operating in that locality, and arriwd there on the 3d of June. His services in this party have already been mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Continuation of the transcontinental line of precise levels, Kansas.-Uuder the Superiuten<le11t's instructions of June 24, 1895, Assistant Isaac Winston proceeded to Lawrence, Kaus., reaching that point July 9, and organized a party for the continuation of the transcontinental line of geodetic leveling. Messrs. F. Weld, J. R. Chase, and F. S. C. Bunter, who bad been assigned to the party by the Office, reported the same day, and on the 10tl1 two additional men were secured and the instruction of the various members in their respective duties began. Mr. Guy Rainey also reported for duty in the party July 20. The actual leveling cornmeuce<l on the 11th, the starting point of the season being at Holliday, Kans., where two permanent beucb marks had been previously established (in 1891). These bench marks were found undisturbed and in good condition. The route followed was along the roadbed of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to Topeka, at which point a crossing of the Kansas River was made, aud thence along the Union Pacific Railroad to Salina. The season's work closed at the latter point October 2G, 1895. Two simultaneous lines were run over the whole distance, and the running was continuously in one direction; geodetic level ~ o. 5 and the new parafined wooden rods P. & Q. were used throughout the season. Permanent bench marks were established at all towns and villages along the route where suitable stone or brick buildings could be found on which to place them, and on stone piers and abutments of railroad bridges, and temporary bench marks were placed at inter· vals of about 1 kilometre. The latter served the double purpose of furnishing frequent checks on the correctness of the work by means of the comparisons of the two liues, and of minimizing the amount of remeasurement required when discrepancies developed. As an iudication of the care with which the work was executed, it may be here stated that but few remeasurements were fou11d necessary during the season. Hailway trains furnished the means of daily transportation of the party until Topeka was reached, lmt west of that point, the trains being infrequent and not suitably timed, the hire of a wagon and team of horses was found necessary. The velocipede cars, successfully used elsewhere by the leveling party, could have been advantageously employed in this section, and in future will be utilized wherever practicable, when the consent of the rail· way officials can be obtained. No special difficulties were encountered during the season, except those arising from the prevailing strong winds. The winds in this region blow almost continuously during many mouths of the year, and on som<> days caused an entire cessation of work, while on many others the progress was seriously delayed. A resort to wire or rope guys to support the rods dnri11g observation was unavoidable, and the securing of the rer1nisite stability of the leveling instruments was a matter of considerable difficulty. l\fr. Wi11ston has since had constructed an observing tent, to the open !Jase of which are attached paper wheels fitting the railway track. The canvas supported on a light detachalJle frame furnishes complete protection from both sun aud wind, and can be opened in any desired direction for observing. One man can easily trundle this car tent along the track from station to station, and two men can readily remove it from the track on the approach of a train. This device will be used next season, and will doubtless much facilitate and expedite the work in windy weather.

The season's work closed at Salina October 26, and the party was then disbauded and l\fr. 'Winston returned to Washington, reporting for duty at the Office October 31. The distance leveled during the season was 277 kilometres, and the nmul>er of permanent bench marks established was 35. After completing the records and computations of his season's work, Assistant Winston aided Assistant Eimbeck in the computation· of the transcontinental triangulation, and subsequently assisted the Chief of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in the examination and standardization of two sets of base bars, and performed miscellaneous office duty. On the 8th of .Tuue, 1~96, he was directed to prepare for the resumption of field work 011 the Kansas leveling, and started for the field on the 28th, reaching Saliua on the 30th, the last day of the fiscal year. The results of the work will appear iu the next Annual H.eport. ·l1agnetio observations at various·point8 in the States of Jlfissouri, Nebraska, South Dokota, a.nd North Dakota.-During the progress of the magnetic survey undertaken by Assistant R L. Faris in April, 1896, as mentioned under the llead of Eastern Division, ol>servations for magnetic declination, dip and intensity, together with the incidental determinations of time, azimuth, latitude, ·and chronometric longitude, were made at the following-named places in the States of Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota: St. Louis, l\Io.; Norfolk, Newport, and Chadron, Nebr.; Yankton, .Mitchell, Pierre, and Aberdeen, S.

Progress Sketches, showing the localities of field work in the Western Division; are given at the close of Part I. . Continuation of the topo_qrapltical resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor.-The party under the charge of Assistant A. F. Rodgers engaged on the topographical resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor was still in the field at the close of the last fiscal year. On July 1 Assistant Rodgers, in accordance with instructions, assumed charge of the San Francisco suboffice, but the topographical resurvey was continued under his general direction, Mr. Ferdinand Westdahl temporarily taking immediate charge of the party. During July Mr. Westdahl made a survey of the pier head~, wharves, and water front of the harbor, and furnished tracings of the shore line to the bydrographic parties. In August Assistant Fremont Morse was assigned to the charge of the party, and, after computing the triangulation previously executed and making a projection embracing the eastern shore of the bay and the water fronts of Alameda, Oaklaud, and Berkeley, took the field in the latter part of the month. Work was then continued without interruption until .January 2, 1896, when on account of unfavorable weather conditions it was deemed expedient to suspend operations. The sheet above mentioned was completed 1 and also one embracing the water fronts of Sausalito and Belvedere and the shore line of Richardson Bay, Haccoon Strait, and Angel Island. Mr. Morse was then occupied for a few days in making magnetic observations at San Francisco and Monterey, after which he was engaged in inking his topographical sheets until March !!5, wbei1 he was as.signed to chronometric longitude work in Alaska.. In February Assistant Rodgers detailed Mr. F. W. Edmonds to connect hy leveling the bench marks established at t11e Union Iron Works with two new ones located respectively at the San Francisco Magdalen Asylum and tbe Golden Gate ·woolen Mills warehouse. 'fhis work was satisfactorily performed and the relations of the bench marks to the Fort Point plane of reference determined. In April field topographical work was resumed by Mr. Westdahl on the eastern shore of the bay, southward from Robert Landing, and continued until June, when a temporary suspension was necessary to enable the party to execute the triangulation to connect the Lafayette Park Astronomical Observatory with the new station selected in the Pre.sill io Military Heservation. The site for the new observatory had been selected in March by Assistants A. F. Rodgers, J. J. Gilbert, and E. F. Dickins in consequence of municipal improvements rendering the old station no longer available, and the War Department had kindly granted permission to erect an observatory. The triangulation was executed by Assistant Gilbert, who also prepared the plans and specifications for the new building, the construction of which was begun before the close of the fiscal year. 'fhe statistics of the topographical work of the year are as follows:

in CuyJers Harbor, San Miguel Island; in December to determine the position of a buoy placed to mark Mission Bay Rock; in the latter part of December to search for an alleged rock near Pescadero Point, San Mateo County, Cal., and in April to determine the position of the wreck of the British Hhip Blairmore. The results of the Cuylers Harbor investigation are given elsewhere in this report. :Messrs. "'\Vestdahl and Edmonds also performed miscellaneous office duties . .Assistant Rodgers in his report acknowledges his obligations to all the members of his party for their zealous cooperation.' Continuation of the hydi·ogJ·aphic resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Entrance.-At the close of the previous fiscal year the parties on the steamers Gedney and 1lfcArth~tr, under the command of Lieuts. Lucian Flynne and James H. Sears, respectively, were engaged 011 the hydrographic resurvey of San Francisco Bay aud Entrance, and a statement of the progress made to June 30 appears ill my last report. The work was continued by both parties during the current year until December 4 in the case of the Gedney, and November 25 in the case of the JfcArthur, when the unfavorable weather incident to the season of the year compelled a temporary cessation. Both parties resumed .field work early in April, 1896, and, with the exception of short periods when they were taken off for special duty on the naval sileed-trial course in Santa Barbara Channel, and the investigation of alleged seismic changes in Cuylers Harbor, San Miguel Island, were continuously employed on the resurvey of San Francisco Bay from that time to the close of the tlscal year. The work is still in progress, and will be further treated in my next report. The steamer GednmJ remained under the command of Lieut. Lucian Flynne only until July 22, however, when he was relieved by Lieut. A. P. Osborn. Three hydrographic sheets, designated as Nos. 2, 3, and8, were worked upon by this party, and two of them, Nos. 2 and3, were completed, while No. 8 was well advanced. The localities and limits of the sheets are as follows: No. 2, San Francisco Entrance, from Fort Point to the eastward of Blossom Rock; No. 3, San Francisco Bay, from Bluff Point to Alcatraz Island; No. s, San Francisco Bay, from California City Point to Point Knox. "'\Vork was uot carried on continuously on any one sheet until finished, as when tidal or weather conditions were unfavorable in one locality it was frequently practicable to prosecute the survey in a11otheri and thus utilize time which would otherwise have been lost. Field operations were suspended for the winter December 4, and the vessel was anchoretl iu smooth water in Oakland Creek. 'l'he office work then engaged the attention of the party u11til Apl'il 1, when the work of soumliug was resumed. On April 20, Lieutenant Osborn, in accordance with special instructions, proceeded with his vessel to Santa Barbara Channel for the purpose of establishing a speed-trial course for the battle-ship Oregon, and rendering such assistance during the trial us might be required by the naval authorities, nnd subsequently was directed to make a hydrographic examination of Cuylers Barbor. These duties were completed by May 20, and the party then returned to San Francisco Bay, and, in accordance with a request of the Honorable Secretary of the Navy, first took up the Rurvey of Mare Island Strait, on a scale of 1-10 000, and the development of the main channel from Point Penole to 1fare Island, on a scale of 1-20 000. 'fhe channel lines were run not wider than 100 metres apart, and a close survey was made as far up as the brickyard wharf above Vallejo, special attention being given to the thorough development of all rocks and shoals. This was finisbed on June 18, and the uniinisbed sheet No. 8 was again taken up, and was still in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The l\Iare Island Strait work being co11sidered a part of the San Franci:0co Bay resurvey, the statistics relating thereto will be combined with those of the main work iu the table given below. The statistics of the Uuylers Harbor work will be given further on in a paragraph devoted to that subject, and a fuller account of the work on the Santa Barbara Channel speed-trial course will also appear under a special heading. The statistics of the year's work of the Gedney party i11 San Francisco Bay and approaches are as follows:

upon the harbor, aud that an upheaval from the bottom of the barl>or, but near shore, had also occurred. The dimensions of the upheave1l portion above high.water line were: Length, 170 ruetres; greatest width, GO metres; aud greatest elevatiou, 35 feet. The uew shore liue and the topographic changes were carefully deliucated, hut the l1ydrographic examiuation coulu not then be made on a.ccount of the heavy swell which continued throughout Mr. \Yestdahl's stay on the island. Subsequently, in l\fay, 1096, after the completion of the duty in connection with the i-peed trial of the battle-ship Oregon, Lieut. A. P. Osborn, U.S. N., commaudiug the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Ged1ie11, made a thorough hydrographic examination of the harbor and found that 110 material changes of depth had occurred; the trivial changes found were moreover limited to a very small area in the immediate vicinity of the landslide and upheaval. On the completion of the examination Lieutenant Osborn returned to Sau Francisco aud resumed work on the hydrographic resurvey of that harbor and its approaches. The statisties of the hydrographic examination of Cuylers Harbor are as follows:

Continuation of the tidal record at the Sausalito (San Franaiseo Bay) tidal ·station.-The self. registering tide gauge at the Sausalito tidal station, under the supervision of Assistaut A. F. Rodgers, continued in successful operation throughout the year, and an unbroken record bas been received. Observer Emmet Gray had immediate charge of tbe station until .April 1, 189G, when he was succeeded by Observer Harris S. Ballard. Th~ usual precautions were taken to verify the permanency of the relation of the tide gauge to the bench marks in the locality, lines of spirit leveling having been run from time to time by Messrs. Ferdinand Westdahl and F. ·yi,r. Edmonds. Magnetic observations at San Francisco and Jlfonte1·ey, Cal.-In January, 1896, the annual observations for magnetic declination, dip and intensity were made at San Francisco, at the Presidio station, by Assistant Fremont Morse, and subsequently a complete series was also made by the same observer at Monterey, Cal. Continuation of the topographical survey of Washington Sound, Tirashington.-At the close of the last fiscal year Assistant J. J. Gilbert was engaged at Olympia in computing his previous triangulatiou, and in supervising the repairs to the steam launch Tarry Kot. On July G, 1895, he was instructed to prepare for the immediate resumption of tbe topographic survey of Washington Sound, and accordingly left Olympia for the field, on the steam launch, July 15, stoppiug en route at Seattle and Port Townsend for stores, instruments, and party equipments. Port Stanley was reached on the 18th, and after selecting a camp site at Broken Poiut, Shaw Island, repairing the scow, stored at Port Stanley in 1889, securing the necessary lumber, and pitching camp, field 011erations were begun on the 25th at Yellow Island. The first topographical sheet was completed by August 31; a new projection was then made, and work began immediately on the second sheet, Which was completed by October 5. A third sheet was worked upon at intervals, meanwhile, and completetl by Octol>er 20. On tbe completion of sltect No. 3 the season was well advanced, and, as tbe allotment for the party was nearly expended, it was decided to close operations for the i-eason. Breaking camp beg-au on the 22d, and by the 24th the camp equipage and otber property were safoly stowecl on the scow, and tlie latter towed to Port Stanley and placed in the charge of Mr. F. 0. Troxwell for the winter. The party then proceeded to Seattle and Olympia, reaching tho latter point on the 25th; the steam launch was then hauled out a11d housed over at a suitable place near the dry house of Mr. R. F. Whitham Oil tbe east side of Budds Inlet, about 3 miles from the city wharves. Assistant Gilbert proceeded to San Francisco November 7, nnd was engaged cluriug tbe winter in inking sheets and completing the office work incident to bis field labors of the present and past season. . Assistant F. A. Young was attached to the party during the season uutil October 22, when, by the direction of the Superintendent, he was detached, and proceedccl to 'Yashington, D. C., where he was engaged on miscellaneous office duty until again ordered to field duty in Alaska. Mr.

Young observed magnetic declination, dip and intensity at a station near the camp, and made the subsequent computations, and throughout the season rendered valuable assistance in the execution of the topographical work. The season was general1y favorable for the prosecution of the work, only one rainy day occurring, but fogs and smoke prevailed to some extent in the latter part. The statistics of the Washington Sound work may be briefly stated as follows:

The topography sur'\"eyed embraces Orcas Island from Orcas Knob to Grindstone Harbor, including Deer Harbor and West Sound; San ,Juan Island from Limestone Point to Argyle, including Friday Harbor; and all of Shaws, Jones, Yel1ow, Brown, Reef, Fawn, :Xob, Cliff, Crane, Bell, Blind, Canoe, Oneal, and Turn islands. A sketch, showing the work executed and the laying out of the sheet~, accompanies Assistant Gilbert's report. During l\Iay and part of June, 1896, :l\fr. Gilbert assisted in the investigati011s connected with the proposed transfer of the Lafayette Park Astronomical Observatory to a more suitable location, prepared plans and specifications for the new building, and connected the new station trigonometrically with the old, and with the triangulation of San Francisco Bay. On June 16, in accordance with instructions, he proceeded to Utah and reported to Assistant William Bimbeck for duty under his direction on the transcontinental geodetic work. Geodetic worl·.-Oontinuation of the transcontinental triangulation in Oolorado.-At the close of the last fiscal year Assistant F. D. Granger was engaged on the occupation of Big Springs, a primary station of the great transcontinental scheme of triangulation, and had just completed a reconnaissance for the location of a secondary point between Big Springs and Plateau, resulting in the selection of Dry Camp. The observations at Big Springs were finished by July 13, and determined the horizontal directions and elevations of four primary, one secondary, and a number of tertiary points, the primary stations being Cramer;:; Gulch, Plateau, Pikes Peak, and Divide, and the secondary station the newly selected point, Dry Camp. The instruments and camp were then transferred to Divide Station, located in El Paso County, about 3 miles east of Eastonvme, a small town on the Gulf Railroad. The preparations for occupation were completed by July 24, and the observations were begun on the following day and finished on August 23. Three primary stations (Big Springs, Pikes Peak, and Bison Peak), two secondaries (Mounts Morrison and Table), aml twenty-five tertiaries were thus determined, both as to horizontal direction and elevation. The line to Mount Morrison, which is represented on the published sketch of the Colorado reconnaissance as unobstructed, was found to be cut off by trees on intervening ridges, bnt fortunately, after an examinatiQn of the line by the recorder of the party, M:r. J. B. Boutelle, the cutting of an avenue through the timber was found to be practicable, and the visibility of th~ station was thus secured. Observations on this point were of great importance, inasmuch as the.trigonometric connection with the Chamberlin Observatory at Denver was in a measure dependent thereon. On the completion of the observations at Divide, Assistant Granger stored a portion of his camp equipage at Eastonville, and with a reduced party, consisting of Foreman E. E. Torrey, a driver, a cook, and two hands, and a limited outfit, proceeded to Cramers Gulch, arrivi11g there on the evening of September 3. The preparations for occupation, including the erection of a 20-foot observing tripod and scaffold, were finisl1ed by September' 6, and the observations, which were begun on the foUowing day, were completed on the 1 ith. The party and outfit were then transferred to Station Plateau, where observations were begun on the 24th of September and concluded 011 the 6th of October. At Oramers. Gulch and Plateau two primaries and five tertiaries and three primaries and two tertiaries, respectively, were observed, and the horizontal direction of the secondary station, Dry Camp, was determined.

This completed the portion of the Colorado work assigned to Assistant Granger, and, in accordance with instructions~ the party was then transferred to Salina, Kans., for the purpose of making a reconnaissance for the selection of a base-line site in the vicinity of the line Wilmer to Taylor. This work, belonging properly to the Middle Division, bas already been reported under that head, in its regular geographic order. The statistics of the Colorado work are given in tabular form as follows:

Assistant Granger, in his report, highly commends the zeal and efficiency of l~ecorder J.B. Boutelle and l!'oreman E. E. Torrey; tlie latter served throughout the season, and the former until August 31, when he was detached from the party and directed to return to Washing-ton. Geodetic work.-Oontinuat-ion of the transcontinental triangulation in Oolorado.-At the close of the last fiscal year the party under the charge of Assistant William Eimbeck was in the field, and the arrangements for the occupation of "Treasury ].\fountain" and "Pikes Peak" were complete. The work-was carried on during the present year as rapidly as the unfavorable weather conditions would permit, and the occupation of the former station was brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the 5th of July. Severe thunderstorms hovered almost incessantly over the mountain, aud snowstorms were of frequent occurrence, so that much interruption and vexatious delay was occasioned. The same conditions prevailed at" Pikes Peak," where Assistant John Nelson bad meanwhile been endeavoring to advance the direction observations, and consequently but little progress had been made when .Assist.ant Eimbeck, after the completion of "Treasury Peak," reached that point with the main party. The most strenuous efforts were then made by the combiued party to advance the operations, and advantage was taken of every clear moment, but the wretched stormy weather, accompanied usually by high winds, still continued, and at the close of July but little head way had been made, and most of the observations remained incomplete. There being 110 prospect of an early favorable change, and past experience having shown that August is always a bad month for observing in these high altitudes, the station was temporarily abandoned, and the time was utilized in moving the party to "Uncompuhgre Peak" and preparing that station for occupation. Observations were begun at "Uncompahgre" on the 20th of August and continued until September 20, aud embraced not only the usual tleterminations of horizontal directions and double zenith distances, but also those of latitude, azimuth, and magnetic declination, dip and intensity; a topographical sketch covering an area of 20 square miles, and based on accurate local triangulation, was also made, to serve not onl~1 as a description of the locality of the statiou, but also to facilitate the study of the local deflection of the plumb line. The party then· returned to "Pikes Peak" and successfully completed the occupation of that station by the 9th of October. The observations at this point were of the same character as those described for '' Uncompahgre Peak," but in addition a local triangulation of some magnitude was here required to connect the hypsometrie work of the maiu triangulation with the Denver and Hio Grande railroad.levels at" Colorado Springs." Owing to tlie brertdth and flatness of tlie mountain top three auxiliary mountain stations had to be interpolated and occupied. At one of the lower stations of the scheme zenith llistance observations on the Pikes Peak stations were made on three 1lays, to t:'liminate as far as possible the errors due to local deflection, and as a further check 011 the local triangulation two selected distances \Vere carefully measu.red by means of a standardized steel tape. The seaso11's work closed 11t "Colorado Springs" on the 14th of October, and the party was then disbanded. Throughout the season Assistants John Nelson and R. L. Faris and Recorders Willis J.\I. Baum and Walter H. Clay served in the party and rendered valuable assistance in the various branches of the work. On the disbandment of the party Messrs. Nelson, Faris, Baum, and Clay returned to Washington and Mr. Eimbeck proceeded to Gunnison, Colo., and after attending to the settle·meut of party affairs antl the storage aud care of the instruments, camp equipage, and other public

property in his charge, also returned to Washington by the end of NovemLer. During the winter he was engaged upon the computations and reductions of his field observations, and was assisted by the above-mentioned rnernberi! of the party, and also for a time hy Assista11ts Isaac Winston and 0. ll. French. Assistant Eimbeck's further services on the trauscontinental geodetic work in Utah are noticed in the paragraph immediately following, and those of other members of the party under appropriate geographical headings elsewhere in this report. Geodetic u·ork in Utah.-Selection and ]Jreparation of the Salt Lake base line and its connection icith the transcontinental triangulation.-In the spring of 18!)6 Assistauts \Villiam Eimbeck a11<i P. A. ·welker were directed to prepare for the resumption of the geodetic work in tLe vicinity of. Og·den, Utah, and early in l\fay the specific instructions were issued. The plan of operations was as tollows: '.l'he main party Ull(ler the charge of Assistant Eimbeck to Relect a suitable site for a base line, prepare it for measurement, and for its connection with the main triangulation to occupy the base stations and "\Vaddoup" primary station; an auxiliary party, under the charge of Assistant Welker, but under Assistant Eimbeck's general direction, to assist in the preliminary work and to occupy the primary stations ''Antelope Island," "Ogden," and "Promonotory"; on the completion of the trigonometric connection and the incidental observations related thereto, Mr. \Velker to disband the auxiliary party, joiu the main one, and assist in the base measuremeut. l\Iessrs. Eimbeck and Welker reached the field of operations on May 23, and at 011ce set about making the necessary preparations for the occupation of "Waddoup" and "Antelope Islaucl," and executing the reco1111aissance for the selection of the most available site fo1· the base line. By June rn these objects were accomplished, aud about this time Assistant J. J. Gilbert, .A.id C. C. Yates, and l~ecorder Buford A. Lynch joined the party at Kaysville. Assistant \Yelker orgauized his auxiliary party on June 20 and, accompanied by .A.id C. C. Yates, at once proceeded to the occupation of "Antelope Island" station, the observations being begun on the 23d; Assis taut Eimbeck, after assigning to Assistant Gilbert the duty of preparing and marking the base line and erecting piers and observing signals at its termini, proceeded to the occupation of" \Yaddoup," accompanied by Hecorder Buford A. Lynch, and began observations on the 26th. The close of the fiscal year found the work fairly under way and the three branches of the party making excellent progress. The results of the completion of the trigonometric connection and the a-Otual measurement of the base Hue will be given in the next annual report. It may here. be meutioned that the line chosen for the base is situated in the flat lands near and along the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake between the towns of Kaysville and Hooper, Davis County, and is 11 ·2 kilometres in length.

Tlie localities of field operations in Alaska are sliown on Progress Sketclies at the close of Part I. Continuation of hydrographfo and general surveys in Alaska.-At tlie close of the last fiscal year tlie party on the steamer Patterson, under the command of Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore, U. S. N., was engaged in the survey of Chatham and Peril straits and the adjacent bays and inlets, and bad made excellent progress. The survey was continued uninterruptedly during the present year until October 2, and a large amount of work was accomplished, the various branches being assigned to different officers of the party. The general assignment of duty was as follows: To Lieut. A.G. Rogers, the tidal observations and base-line measurements; to Lieut. U. F. Lopez, tbe astronomical observations; to Lieut. Hugh Rodman, in charge of the steamer Co.~mos, the main triangulation; to Ensign W. B. Hoggatt, with the steam launch Yfa·en, subsidiary triangulation and hydrography; to Ensign H. K. Benham, with the steam launch Reynard, subsidiary triangulation, hydrography, photography, and part of the shore line; to Yeoman H. Ford, the topography and the computiug aud platting of the main triangulation; to Yeoman vV. G. Appleton and Master-at-Arms Hugh Rodman, the recording and platting of the hydrography and subsidiary triangulutiou. This detail was adhered to as closely as was practicable, and all branches of the field work were carrie:d on simultaneously, the triangulation, however, being always kept in ad vauce. If for any reason any branch occa1:1ionally fell behind, force was concentrated on ity to hl'ing it up, so as to keep all the work within easy reach of the vessel, and the Patterson's anchorages were shifted from time to time as the work progressed, so as to be always as near as possible to the field of operations. The season's work embraces the whole of Peril Strait, from its connec· tion with Chatham Strait to the head of Hooniah Sound on the west and Fish Point on the south, with the adjacent bays and passages, and that portion of Chatham Strait lying between Peril Strait and Point Gardner, including Kelp, "'Whitewater, Cha-ik, 'fakatz, and Hootz bays and Kootznahoo Inlet. Two bases were mea1:111red, one of 700 metres at Hootz Bay, as mentioned in last year's report, and one of 1 350 metres near Pogibshi Point, in Peril Strait; astronomical observations were made at Keuasnow Island and at one end of the Pogibshi base; magnetic declination, dip, and i11tensity determinations at the Keuasnow Island astronomical station; the necessary tidal observations at Pogibshi Point, Bear Bay, and Killisnoo, and current obse1·vations at sundry localities. The most important current observations were those simultaneously taken at Sergius Narrows, Big Island, Adams Narrows, and midchannel off Poverotni Island, as from them was determined the l)Oint of meeting· of tlie ilood tides entering Peril Strait through Salisbury Sound on the west and Chatham Strait on the east. It was found to be to the northward of Poverotui Island, in tlie broad part of the strait. Good anchorages were found in Peril Strait at Pogibshi Point and Rodman Bay, aud in Chatham Strait at Cha-ik Bay, Kelp Bay, and Ta Katz Bay, the latter being completely landlocked and protected from wind and sea in every direction. Kelp Bay is au extensive basin with three branches, the north one of which has a portage across to Peril Strait; canoes can pass across at ordinary high water, and boats drawing 3 or 4 feet can pass at high spring tides. The anchorage was found on the south side of the basin, in 25 fathoms

of water, but tbe arms are deep, except at their heads, where they terminate rather abmptly in sand flats. The hills surrounding Kelp Bay are high and steep and covered with perpetual suow, except on the upper side of the 11orth arm, and black bears abound. Warm Spring Bay, on the west side of Chatham Strait, and about 12 miles south of Kelp Bay, also furnishes au anchorage, but it is not a good one for large vessels, as it is entirely open to easterly storms, but small craft can find a i;;ecure harbor in 'either of the small arms on its south side. At tlie head of this bay is a large cascade fed by a Jake located about 200 feet above sea level, and in the same vicinity, and at a still higher level, there are hot sulphur springs, which are occasionally resorted to by the Killisnoo Indians for medicinal baths. The weather during the season was for the most part cloudy and rainy, with occasional fogs and high winds, until August 2!l, when a period of very fine weather set in. Notwithstanding the unfavorable conditions, however, there were only two working days when no field work was accomplished. The season's work closed on October 2, and the I'atte.rson proceeded to Sitka, where the Cosmos and other boats not belonging to the ship's outfit proper were stored, and thence to l\fary Island and Port Simpson, arriving at the latter place on the morning of the 8th and taking on board the Alaska boundary parties of Assistants K F. Dickins and P.A. Welker, who bad finished their work a month earlier and were awaiting the vessel's arrival. The steamer Fuca and the schooner Earnest were taken in tow, and by 3 p. m. of the same day the homeward journey was resumed an<l Seattle was reached by October JG. The Fuca and Earnest were taken to the Puget Sound iiaval station at Port Orchard and laid up there, after which the Patterson returned to Seattle and was placed in the hands of the Puget Sound Dry Dock Company for extensive repairs. During the winter the party of the Patterson, temporarily quartered on the Hassler at Port Orchard, was engaged on the office work pertaiuing to the Alaska Survey. The report of Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore furnishes much valuable information in relation to soutpeast Alaska generally and in particular to. the portions surveyed by bis party. Tlle gen· eral features of the region operated in am similar to those of southeast Alaska generally, the country being mountainous, rugged, and thickly wooded to a height of 2 000 to 2 500 feet. On the west side of Chatham Strait and on the north side of Peril Strait the mountains rise abruptly out of the water to a height of 2 000 to 5 000 feet, the water being Yery deep close up to the shores, and there are very few outlying dangers, while on tlie eastern and southern sides of Chatham and Peril straits, respectiYely, the shores are Jess abrupt and more irregular and shoaler water is found, with some outlying rocks aud reefs. The southern portion of Peril Strait, known as "The H.apids," is quite dangerous and requires the most careful navigation. Several good anchorages not previously known were discovered and surveyed, some of which will prove very useful to navigators. The depths through the middle of Chatham Strait range from 300 to 400 fathoms, aud the bottom is comparatively even, while that of Peril Strait is more irregular.· On the shores of both the timber is mainly hemlock and Elpruce with some cedar and alder, but most of it is not valn· able; in midsummer the vegetation is rank wherever there is soil enough for roots, and flowers are abundant wl1erever the rays of the sun can penetrate. Game was scarce owing to the se\'ere winter of 1 ~93-94, but fish were plentiful, especially salmon trout, dog and humpback salmon, and halibut; every arm, bight, and bay has a stream at it.s bead, where early in the summer salmon aud speckled trout abouud, while later in the season these streams are literalJy teeming with both varieties of the former. The only permanent settlements within the area of the season's work are KiJJisnoo, on the east end of Kenasnow Island, and the Indian village of Angoon, 2 miles north of the entrance of Kootznahoo Inlet, otller villages being occupied only at the seasons for potato planting and digging. There are no whites at Angoon, and only from ten to forty, according to circumstances, at Killisnoo, while the Indian population of the two settlemeuts amounts to about 800. KilJhmoo has a post-office, and its main industry at the present time is the manufacture of herring oil and fertilizer aud the salting of herring. The Alaska Oil and Guano Company usually employs about forty white men and sixty Iudians, but owing to tbe depression in the market they operated this seaso11 at about one-third of their capacity. Their catch this year was 3 200 tons of fish, and tbeir .output was 102 000 gallons of oil, 500 tons of fertilizer, and 1 000 half barrels of salted herring;

they shipped, however, about 250 000 gallons of oil and 700 tous of fertilizer, most of it being last year's production. The Pacific Coast Steamship Company runs the large and comfortable steamer City of Topeka regularly, twice a month throughout the year, from Seattle to Sitka, and the large aud cowmo· dious steamer Queen, of the same Iiue, also makes semimouthly trips <luring June, July, aud August. They both pass through the northern part of Chatham Strait, stop at Killisnoo, and p1·oceed thence through Peril ::3trait; returning, the City of Topeka follows the same route, while the Queen returns by way of Poiut Gardner, and is the onl:y regular vessel at preseut navigatiug the southern waters of Chatham Strait. Two small steamers, the Wallapa and Chilkat, were started this summer over the same route as that pursued by the City of Topeka.

Lieut. Commander Moore highly commends all members of the party for the zeal and efficieucy displayed i11 the execution of the work. The Patterson is now preparing for the resumption of field work and will start for Alaska early in July. Clwonometric determination of d~fferences of longitude in A la.ska; also latitude and magnetic determfoations.-In March, 1896, Assistant Fremont l\Iorse was instructed to prepare for chronometric longitude work in Alaska, and Assistants Homer P. Ritter, F. A. Young, and Aid O. B. French were directed to report to him for duty under his direction, joining him at a specified point on Puget Sound in time to connect with the steamer starting for Alaska early in Apl'il. The plan of the season's work was as follows: Assistant l\Iorse to occupy the astrouomical . station at Sitka, make tlle necessary time observations there, and rate his chronometers, while new stations at Kadiak Island and Unalaska were similarly occupied by Assistant H. P. Hitter and Aid 0. B. French, respeetively; Assistant F. A. Young to take charge of the chronometers to be carried on three or more successive round trips of the Alaska Commercial Company's steamer Dora and to intercompare them daily; the carried chronometers to be carefully compared with those of each of the three astronomical stations on each arrival or departure of the steamer, both by Assistant Young and the astronomer of the station; the latitude of the Kadia.k and Uualaska stations to be carefully determined by a sufficient nu.mber of astronomical observations, and the magnetic elements, declination, dip, and intensity, to be determined at all three stations; also topographic surveys of the harbors aud adjacent country to be made as opportunity offered W1t110ut interfering with the main work of the expedition; all parts of the work to be under the ~eneral direction and general supervision of Assistant Morse. Assistant Morse left Sau Francisco by steamer on March 25, was joined by the other members of t~e party on reaching Port Townsend, took passage on the steamer City of Topeka at Seattle April 2, and reached Sitka on the 8th. Here, in accordance with the programme ontliued, Mr. ·Morse landed with his instruments and· the other observers transferred their outfits to the steamer

Dora. On account of unfavorable weather time observations at Sitka were not obtained prior to the departure of tbe Dora on the 9th, but all the chronometers, twenty-five in number, were carefully intercompared. Mr. Ritter landed at Kadiak 011 the 14th of April aud temporarily mounted his instrument in a tent, peudiug the construction of a pier and the erection of a wooden .observatory; owing to bad weather, however, lie did not succeed in getting time observations prior to the Dora's proceeding westward. ::\'Ir. French reached Unalaska on the rnth of April and was al~o prevented by thick weather frolll getting time determinations before the departure of the steamer on her return trip, but he succeeded in getting good observations on the following night. Mr. Young continued on the steamer in charge of the carried chronometers, and by the close of the fiscal year three round trips between the stations were nearly completed, the Dora being due at Sitka on July 3. Owing to the partial failure of the first trip, due to unfavorable weather at all stations, as already noted, and the further fact that the Sitka station chronometers for a time ran unsatisfactorily, a fourth trip is deemed essential, and a, notification to that effect has nlready been sent by Assistant Morse to the other observers. The party being still in the field and all branches of the work as yet incomplete, no tabular 8tatistics can now be given, but the full results of the seaso11 will be duly set forth in my next aunual report. .Alaska Boundary Survey.-See under head of "Special operations."

SPECIAL OPERATIONS.
Erection. of beacons on the coast,~ of Maine and Jfo~sachu.~etts for a naviil speed-trial course.The Navy Department having requested the cooperation of this Survey in the erection of beacons on the coasts of Maine and l\Iassachusetts for use in laying out and marking a speed-trial course for the Indiana and Kat.ahdin, the steamer Bache, Lieut. Robert G. Peck commanding, was detailed for that duty in September, 1895. Commander RB. Bradford, of the U. S. S. Dolphin, in charge of the trial course, having indicated the points where these structures were needed, the Bache's party erected beacons at the following.named places: Entrance of Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts; Cape :N"eddick, ::'lie. (Neddick B:,); Kennebunkport, Me. (Boothbay B:,); and 'fimber Island, Main~ (Little River B:,). The beacons were of the same size, and of tripod form with center pole; the tripods were constructed of 50-foot scantlings, and the top of the pole in each case was about 75 feet above the ground. Iu the building of two of' these signals assistance was rendered by a working party from the Dolphin. Ou the completion of this duty, September 26, the Bache returned to her regular work on the coast of Massachusetts. Erection of beacons on the north shore of Long Island, New York, for the naval speed-trial co1trse.-In July, 189.5, the steamer Bache, under the command of Lieut. Robert G. Peck, while en route to her field of work on the coast of l\Iassachusetts, stopped at Long Island Sound for the purpose of erecting the permanent beacons desired by the Navy Depa1·tment for the naval speedtrial courr,;e. Beacons were erected at the following points: Crane N eek, Mount Misery Blutt; B:allock, Tuthill, Roanoke Point, Cooper, Oregon Hauge, and Long Beach Range. They were all of the same type and character, viz, tripods with cage and center pole; the legs were buried to a depth of several feet, the prirts below and near the ground being first thoroughly tarred, and each leg was securely l>racecl and anchored. The tripods themselves were also strongly braced and boarded, and subsequently painted white, so as to secure the greatest.degree of visibility and at the same time preserve the wood; the cages and poles were, however, with one exception, painted black, on account of showing against a sky. background. On the completion of this duty the Bache proceeded on her way to the coast of Massachusetts, st-0ppi11g en route at New London, Oonn., to receive on board the Superintendent of tile Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Hydrographic Inspector, who were to l>e carried to Buzzards Ba.y and Hyannis to inspect the parties at work in those localities. Special topographic s1trvey of the Naval Academy Grounds at Annapolis, Jlld.-ln December, lS95, the Navy Department having requested a detailed topographical survey on a large scale <>f the Naval Academy grounds at Annapolis, Assistant John Vii'. Donu was instructed to undertake the ''.Ork. By special arrangement, however, all expenses of' the survey, excepting the pay and subsistence of the chief of party, were to be borne by the Na val Academy, the Coast and Geodetic Survey l.iaving no balances of appropriation remaining that could be made available for the purpose. Assistant Donn proceeded at once to Annapolis, and after conference with the Superintendent of the Na val Academy as to matters of' detail, organized his party and began the field work. The scale decided upon was 1-1 000, and all natural aud artificial features were accurately delineated, the contour lines being carnfully traced to .represent. successive vertical elevations of 2 feet, and the true positions, shapes, and sizes of all buildings and constructions being shown, as also the positions of trees and minor details. A bench mark, related to mean high water, was also

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

established in the ~ounds, and to it all elevations were referred; this bench mark was also connected by a line of levels with the nearest permanent bench mark of the Ooast and Geodetic Survey precise leveling. The winter season was not the most favorable one for field operations, and considerable time was necessarily lost in consequence of inclement weather, but the survey was nevertheless successfully completed by March 9. A.ssistant Donn then retul'ned to Washington, and was engaged for some time in iuking and completing the sheet and preparing the necessary copies for transmission to the ~a,·y Department; in this office work he was assisted by .Assistant J . .A. Flemer. Two certified copies of the topographical sheet were transmitted to the Navy Department in May, one being for the use of the Superintendent of the Naval Academy and the other for tbe Department files, an<l, as is usual in such cases, the original sheet was deposited in the archives of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Special hydrographic exa.mination of the vicinity of the Dry Tortugas, at the request of the Navy I>cpart1nent.-Iu the latter part of January, 1896, the Navy Department, haviug decided upon the use of Tortugas Harbor a>1 a coaling station for the larger ve:;sels of the North Atlantic fleet during the contemplated drill and maneuvers in the Bay of Florida, :wd having information from the light-house inspector of the district that considerable changes of depth had taken place in the vicinity since the date of the last survey, requmited that a hydrographic party of the Coast and Geodetic Survey be detailed at the eat·liest practicable date to make a special examination of that harbor and its approaches. Accordingly, Lieut. Robert G. Peck, commanding the steamer Bache, was directed to suspend tem1)C)rarily the Pensacola B;1y survey upon which he was engaged, }lr0ceed with his vessel to the Dry Tortugas, and make it thorough examination of t11e Southeast Channel and the inside deep-water anchorage; also, to make such examinations elsewhere as would euable thhi office to judge as to the necessity of a complete resurvey of the whole group of keys and the adjacent waters. The Bache arrived at Tortugas on March 2, and the examinations were immediately begun and continued to the 18th, when they were completed. Tidal observations were made continuously, day and night, throughout the whole period, so as to determine a l'eliable plane of reference; this, wheu obtained, was found to agree exactly with the one determined during the previous survey, a very satisfactory and gratifying result. The shore line of the keys was platted by means of sextant angles, and in many places quite marked changes were found to l1ave occurred. Some changes in the configuratioi1 of the bottom hav(>. also occurred since the former survey, but these mainly affect the shoaler parts near shore, the channels being found for the most part unchangecl, or clrnngecl hy immaterial amounts. The principal changes may be summarized as follows: 1. Topographic changes: 'rhe shore lines of all the keys, except Loggerhead Key, which was not examined, have changed radically: For example, Garden Key has extended both in a northeasterly and a southwesterly direction; the low island to the northward and westward of the fort is now entirely un,dei· water even at the lowest tides; Long, Key has materially shifted its position; Bird, Sand, l\Iiddle, and East keys ha,·e changed radically iu shape; Bnsh Key is less out of water than formerly, and is now de8titnte of vegetation, though formerly covered with bushes. 2. Hy1lrographic changes: The southern half of the 12-foot shoal marke1l by buoy No. ii has been cut away; tbe "middle ground" has grown in dimensions to the northward; t.he shoal to the westward of Sanll Key ,has extended considerably to westward; three shoal spots, varying in depth from 3~ fathoms to 4! fathoms, have de\·eloped in differeut parts of the Northwest Cha1111el. Lieutenant Peck concludes bis report with a recon11ne11datio11 as to a complete res111·vpy as follows:
·while the examination made IJy the Bache, so far as can ho .indgecl IJofore the soundings nro actnully platted on tho sheet, indicates 110 npprociuble change iu the deep-water ports ut1 shown by ·tho present clwrt, except those heretofore noted, yet, inasmuch as there seems to be a prohability of a grouter uBe of thit1 harbor by vest1elR of llie large~t size, I am of the opinion that o. resurvey should be macle, in which the de\·elopment shall !Jo so close as to guarantee freedom from dangers which may have e.;caped the former survey, Though tho keys will doubtless conti111rn to t1how rapid aud rtlclicnl change~ in shape uml Jl·liition, 1in1l hanks and shoals bordering on them will continue to oxteucl or recede, it is believed that iu the deep-water part~ of the channelt1 aU<l anchorages there is o. condition of practical pl'rmuucucy.

The Bache, on the completion of the wol"l;:, proceeded to Key West for a special examination in that harbor, and then retnmed to her field work in Pensacola Bay. Resun:e!J of the boundar!J line between the United States a:iid 1lfexico.-As stated in the _last report, the International Boundary Commission, on the boundary line between the United States aud Mexico, adjourned on the 11th of October, 1894, to meet in vVashington,_ D. C., one year from that date, and Assistant A. T. l\fosman waR, in January, 1895, directed by the Honorable Secretary of State to report to the Superintendent of the Uuitecl States Coast aucl Geodetic Survey for duty until his services as a member of the Commission should again be requirecl. Mr. }fosman performed various field and oflice serYices, a11d ou the arrival of the time specified (October 11, 1895), resumed his duties as a member of the .Joiut Commission, assisting in the preparation of maps and profiles of the boundary, the report of the field operations of the Commission, and the astronomical and geodetic results obtained l>y the Guited States representatives. He was still so engaged at the close of the fiscal year. Laying out of <i .~pcc<l-trhil eou1-.~e in Santa. Barbara Channel, Calijornia.-In April, 1896, the Navy Departme11t haviug requested the laying out and determiuation of a speed-trial course in l::3anta Barbara Channel for the new battle ship Orrgon, Lieut. A. L'. Osborn, commanding the steamer Gerlne!J, was directed to execute that work, and on its completion to report to Admiral L.A. Beardslee, U. S. X., the president of the trial board, and render such assistance during the trial of the Oregon as might be required. 'rhe course was to be from 30 to 31 nautical miles in length, starting from a range on Point Conception and ruuning toward Santa Barbara as far as Point Goleta, where the other terminal ranges were located. The determination of the line was completed by May n, and Lieutenant Osborn aud party rendered such service as the trial board required, until the 18th, when he proceeded with the GednC1J to San Miguel Island for the purpose of investigating reported changes in Cuylers Harbor. . The steamer 1lfeArthur, under the cc.m1111aud of Lieut. ,James II. Sears, also, at the request of Navy Department, assisted from ::\lay 7 to 19 in the preparations for and during the speed trial Of the Oregon, and subsequently returned to her regular work in San Francisco Bay. Continuation of the res1trvey of that part of the boundary line between the States of Ca.lifornia and Nevada which extends f1;om a point in La.kc Tahoe to the Colorado Rivcr.-The resumption of the rmmrvey of the oblique boundary line between the States of California and "Nevada in May, 18!)5, by Assistants C. II. Sinclair aud vV. B. Fairfield, was noticed in my last report, and an ~count is there given of the progress of the work to the close of that fiscal year. 'l'he continua· tion of the resurvey during the preseut fiscal year, and the results accomplished between July 1 and November 20, 18!)5, form the subject of a report by Assistant Sinclair, 11ated l\farcb 20, 1896. . The plan of party" organization heretofore outlined was continued, viz, the party 'was divided lilt~ two main sections, one, under the cha_rge of .Assistant W. B. Fairfield, executing the triangulation, topographic sketching, and magnetic observations, while the other, under Assistant C. H. Sinclair, the chief of part.y, executed the ranging out of the line. The latter section was for convenience subdivided, Assistant A. L. Baldwin taking charge of the forward end of the line, selecting the location of points on ridges or locating then~ at pro1ier distances in the valleys or desert regions. Owing to the long sights made possible uy the topographic features of the country, heliotropes were advantageously used for getting points in line, and they also facilitated th.e cooperation of the two section~ of the ranging-out party by enabling them to communicate ~itl~ each other quickly and certainly by means of a code of signals previously agreed upon. The "t.atiou Tr.o, on the summit of the vYhite l\1ountai11s, was occupied in June, and Tr.~, overlooking the ~ish Lak.e Valley, was partially completed when the previous fiscal year closed. From this point G:i, TG2, <tnd Tu1, to the northwest, were determined aucl to the southeast along the White S. Doc. 35--4 ' '

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC ::lURVEY.

Mountain Range, which was crossed obliquely, and across Fish Lake Valley, numerous points were interpolated, as far as T 79 , on the Sylvania Mountains, about 40 miles distant. T 64 was completed July 4, and the party moved forward across Fish Lake Valley the next day. Beyond the Sylvania Mountains is a region difficult to operate in on account of the scarcity of water and provender. Assistant Baldwin started on July 7 to explore this region, and reached the summit of the Grapevine Mountains on the 11th, and communicated by heliotrope with Assistant Sinclair, who had meanwhile moved to T 79 · The point on Grapevine Mountains was not located until the 15th, owing to delays incident to the difficulties already mentioned, but in the meantime Mr. Sinclair lined in nearer points and made some reconnaissance and erected signals for the triangu· lation. On the return of Assistant Baldwin, July rn, it was decided to suspend temporarily the ranging.out work and unite all sections of the party in bringing the triangulation up to the point reached by the ranging party. This was accomplished by August 10, and meanwhile arrangements had been made for sending hay and grain to the southeast, an extra six-horse team being hired for the purpose, while the party teams were utilized m distributing the feed to the different mountain stations or temporary camps. The grain and hay had to be hauled from Fish Lake Valley and other supplies from the railroad station at Bishop. The party then proceeded to the southeast, carrying on the different branches of the work simultaneously, and reached the Grapevine Mountains via the head of Death Valley and Sand Springs. At the latter point, owing to the extremely high temperature and the total absence of shade, the party suffered severely. The next water station beyond Sand Spring is at Staininger's Ranch, and this for a time was the base of operations. From here to the next water is less than a day's travel by trail, but to get the teams there required three days, and a distance of 65 miles was traversed. The party reached the latter spring September 5, and the ranging out of the line was thence continued to the southeast end of the Great Amargosa Desert. From T 92 , a very commanding station, points were lined in across the desert to T 105 , on the mountain range north of Pahrump Valley, a distance of 62 miles. The next move was to Franklin Well, a distance of 40 miles, most of the road being through heavy sand. It was decided to close the ranging-out work at this point, and the party, after measuring a check base line and an azimuth, took up the triangulation remaining, to connect with that being executed by Assistant Fairfield. This was completed by October 10, and the combined party reached Bishop on October 20. Here arrangements were made for the care of the a11imals during the winter, the wagons were repaired and stored, and the rest of the outfit shipped to Carson City for overhauling. The party reached Garson City October 23, and as many of the men as could be spared were then discharged. Mr. Fairfield then reoccupied certain of the triangulation stations on Lake Tahoe, while Mr. Sinclair made necessary magnetic observations at the station near the Lake Side Tavern, at the southeast end of Lake Tahoe, and at a new station at Oarson City. The latter station is in the pavilion grounds, and is located about 50 metres east of the station of 1894. An azimuth was also observed and a meridian line was laid out and permanently marked. The party was then disbanded, aud the officers retfil'ned to W asbington, and were engaged there on their computations and reductions until again ordered to the field. Assistant Sinclair highly commends Assistants Fairfield and Baldwin for their zeal and the intelligent interest taken by them in the work, and attributes much of the success of the season to their hearty cooperation. A sketch showing the progress of the work and the relative positions of the determined points accompanies Mr. Smclair's report, and the following table of statistics furnished by him shows in concise form the results accomplished:

The further services of Assistants Sinclair, Fairfield, and Baldwin are noticed elsewhere in this report under the appropriate geographic heading'!>. Telegraphic determination of the dijf(wence of longitude between San Francisco, Cal., and Ellensb1trg, Wash.-The Director of the United States Geological Survey llaviug, under date of July G, 1895, requested tlle cooperation of tlle Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the determination of the longitude of Ellensburg, ·wash., by telegraphic interchange of time signals between that point and San Francisco, Cal., Assistant Fremont Morse was directed to mak~ the necessary observations at the Lafayette Park Observatory, while Mr. S. S. Gannett of tlle Geological Survey similarly observed at Ellensburg. The .first interchange of signals took place on July 26, but after that date foggy and cloudy weather prevented observations until July 30. July 31 and August 1 were also favorable, but were followed by another period of unfavorable weather conditions lasting until August 8, wllen the fifth night's observations were obtained. As tbe observers did not exchange stations, it was necessary for them to observe together for personal equation, and Mr. Gannett accordingly proceeded to Sau Francisco for that purpose. No opportunity for observing, 11owever, presented until August 15, and after that date another spell of bad weather set in, and Mr. Gannett was compelled by the pressure of other duties to return to Ellensburg on the 17tll. Another night's observation for personal equation was much desired, but the project had to be abandoned for lack of further time, especially as there appeared to be no prospect of an early change in the weather. On the conclusion of this work Assistant Morse, in accordance with instructions, reported to Assistant A. F. Rodgers for duty under his direction in connection with the resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor. His services in this locality and subsequently in Unalaska are noticed under the proper geographical headings. Examination of a portion of the boundary line between the States of .llfissouri a.nd Iowa.. -The northern boundary line of Missouri has been more or less 11 matter of controversy ever since the admission of that State into the Union, and in fact even prior to that date, and numerous surveys have from time to time been made by State or United States autliority. Without going into the rather interesting history of the matter from the beginning, suftice it to say that the Supreme Court by decree of January 3, 1851, decided that the line surveyed and marked during tlle previous year by their order, and known as the Hendershott-Minor line, should be regarded as the true 1->oundary. Unfortunately this line, which was supposed to be straight, contains many bends and changes of direction, and the courses given in the notebooks do not by any means correspond With the line as marked on tlle ground. For nearly forty years, however, tllis line was accepted by an parties, but eventually some of the marks became obliterated and disputes again arose concerning .a portion of the line, first between individual land owners and finally between the States of Missouri and Iowa. The matter was again referred to the Supreme Court of the U nitcd States in Hecember, 1895, and on February 3, 1896, a decree was issued again defining the boundary as the line run and marked by Hendershott and Minor in 1850, and appointing three commissioners to relocate and mark with durable monuments the obliterated portion which lay between the fiftieth and fifty-fifth mileposts, reckoned eastward from the old northwest corner. The Commissioners, Dwight 0. Morgan, of Illinois; James Harding, of Missouri, and Peter A. Dey, of Iowa, after examining the disputed part of the line, found that it would be necessary to resurvey from the fortieth to the sixtieth mileposts, as the fiftieth, which was also found standing, was alleged to be moved out of its proper position, and most of the intervening wooden ones l1ad disappeared. Tlley then decided to apply to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the detail of an officer to execute a survey, and accordingly Assistant \V. C. Hodgkins was directed to report to tlle commissioners at Davis City, Iowa, and retrace the line under their direction. Assistant A. L. Baldwin was also assigned to the party to assist in the work. Messrs. Hodgkins and Baldwin left Washington on the Gth of April and met the commissioners at Davis City on the Stll. An

examination of a portion of the line near the fortieth milepost was made the same day, and 011 the followiug day, after securi11g the necessary axmen and teamsters, the party moved to Pleasa11to11, a small village on the Iowa side of the boundary. The examination of the whole distance revealed the fact that but few of the old marks remainetl, but approxima.tc positions were readily olJtained IJy consulting the residents of the locality. The general location of the line as thus identifieu differed so materially in azimuth from the r<'cor<led bearings of the survey of 1850 that it was deemed inexpedie11t to attempt to retrace the line from that record, and it was decided instead to run a straight line IJetween the fortieth aud sixtieth mileposts and measure the whole distance with a tape, referring to this base line IJy recta11gular offsets a11y of the old landmarks that might be found as the work progressed. The whole course of the original line, with its numerous bends, would thus !Jc under rigid control by the system of rectangular coordinates and the base line would at the same time furnish the readiest means of locating on the ground the line adopted; the amount of cutting required would also be materially reduced by the opportunities offered for get.ting long sights from ridge to ri1lge. The alignment was made hy .Assistant Hodgkins with an 8·incl1 theodolite fnr11ishe1l with an ocular micrometer, and the opening of the line i11 advance was generally under the direction of Assistant Bald win, who used an engineer's transit. The latter work was first completPd and l\Ir. Ral<lwin then began the tape measure of the line, working westward from the sixtieth milepost. On reaching a point near the fifty-fourth mifopost, work was temporarily suspended on accou11t of rain, and the party returned to Pleasa11ton. On the 21st of April the eastwaru memmrernent was begun at the fortieth milepost and rapidly carrieu on to a junction with that first mentioned. A line of levels was also run to determine tile differences of elevation of the successive stakes anu to reduce the tape measures to a horizontal line. For the purposes of reduction, it was also necessary to keep a careful record of the tape temperatures during the measure. ~otes were also made for the purpose of furnishing a topographical sketch of the strip of country traversed. The course of the boundary was very uneven, as the drainage system crosses it nearly at right angles, and some slopes were so steep as to give vertical differeJJces of 20 feet in a distance of 25 metres. The reduction of the line was then made and the commissioners indicated, on the basis of the information obtained, the conditionFI which should govern the location of the intermediate mileposts. The services of two assistants being no longer necessary, l\fr. Baldwin left the party on the rnth of .i\fay, and, in accordance with previous instructions, proceeded to Versailles, Mo., for the purpose of examining a proposed base line in that vicinity. Assistant Hodgkins, unuer the direction of the commission, completed the work of locating the intermediate marks early in .June, and on the 12th anu 13th made observations at Lineville for time, latitude, and azimuth. During the latter part of the season considerable time was lost on account of rainy weather. Assistant Hodgkins left Lineville on the 15th of .June, and, in accordance with instructions, proceeded to Salina, Kans., and reported to Assistant F. D. Granger, who was in charge of the geodetic party operating in that locality. It is gratifying to be alJle to state that the boundary commisioners have expressed themselves as well pleased with the manner in which the survey of the line was executed anu with' the results of the work. Alaska boundary work.-Tria,ngulation, topography, astronomical determinations of latitude and azimuth, anrl chronometric rleterminations of d~ffercnces of longitudc.-As stated in the report for 18!J5, the initial points of the boundary line between British Columbia and Southeast Alaska depend at present on the rather crnde triangulation executed in past years by the hydrographic parties. This triangulation, while sufficiently good for mere charting purposes, for which it was only intended, does 11ot possess the accuracy necessary for such important work as the exact location of a boundary line, its bases having been measured by rough and only approximate methods, and its angular measurements and astronomical determinations having in many cases been made by inexperie11ceu observers. The discrepancies that have developed in fitting together and adjusting tbc different Rections of the work prove conclusively that a better triangulation arid additional astronomical observations are necessary to afford a relia!Jle basis for the boundary survey. It was therefore determiJJed to fit out a strong party to measure a base, determine astronomical positions, nnd execute a new triangulation from Port Simpson to l\Iary Island and to the head of Portland Canal.

The general programme of the work outlined may also for completeuess be here repeated: The steamer Pattcr8011, while en route to her own field work in Chatham a11d Peril straits, to trausport the partie;;, with their outfits, stores, etc., from San Francisco and Seattle, aucl laud them at their respective statious; the astronomical m~d chrouometric longitude work to be first uudertakeu, astrouomical stations being established at Port Simpson, l\'lary Island, and the head of Portland Canal, tho astronomical station at Seattle bei11g used as the base station for lougitudes; Assistant Fremo11t Morse to occupy the Seattle observatory, while the astronomical stations at Port Simpson, Mary Island, and head of Portland Caual were simultaneously occupied by the parties of Aid 0. B. French and Assis tauts E. F. Dickins and P.A. "\Velker, respectively; nine chronometers in charge of Assistant F. A. Young, to be carried on four successive trip,j of the steamer City tJj Topeka, between Seattle aud the stations at Port Simpson and Mary Islaud, while the steamer F11ca, with ~ve chronometers, similarly plied between Port Simpson and the head of Portland Canal; base hues to be measured at or near Port Simpson and the head of Portland Caual, and such triangulat~ou, topog1·aphy, magnetics, and other 11ecessary work as could be accomplished without interfermg with the longitude determinations to be also carried on; on the snccessful completion of the ai,;tronomical work, .Assistaut Morse to return to San Francis~o, and all the Alaskan parties to be cousolidated under the direction of Assistant E. F. Dickins for the execution of the main triangulation. The <:ondition of the work at the close of the last fiscal year was as follows: Assistant ·welker's party on Portland Ca11al had completed the a8trouomical observations at Point Lion Statio11, measured a, base 1207 metres in length at the mouth of Salmon RiYer, carrieu the triangulation from it to the mouth of Bear Hirnr, and run a, traverse line from the latter point to the fifty-sixth parallel of north latitude. A topographical suney from the astronomical station to the boundary was also well advanced; .Assistant E. F. Dickius had completed the astrquomical observatio11s, except latitude, at the Mary Island station; Aid 0. B. French had completed the astronomical observations at the J>ort Simpson station, made the trigonometric connection with former stations, and observed the magnetic elements, decliuation, dip, allll intensity; the steamer P.uca, carrying five chronometers, had made seven and one-half round trips between Port Simpson and Lion Point astronomical statious, thus completiug this portion of the longitude work; .Assistant F. A. Young, with nine chronometers, on the steamer City of J'opeka, had completed three aud a half round trips between Seattle aud the stations at Port Simpson and :Mary Island. 'l.'he fourth trip was com11leted on .July 7, thus finishing the whole of the longitude work. Assistant Fremont Morse, who had been in charge of the astronomical observatious at the Seattle Observatory, then dismounted aud packed his instruments and proceeded to San Francisco, arrivi11g there July 20, while Assistant Young, in accordance with modified instructions, reported to Assistant J. J. Gilbert for duty on the survey of Washington Sound, his services being no longer needed on the Alaska work. Assistant Welker com1lleted the Portland Canal work on July 9, and then proceeded with his ~arty to Port Simpson, where two days were spent in making a reconnaissance for a, site for a base hue, but without success. The party, and that of Aid 0. R. French, were then transferred to M~ry Island July 12 for the purpose of assisting Assistaut R F. Dickins iu the work of the main triangulation. After a careful reconnaissance a site for a base line was selected on the eastern side ?f Mary Island, the site being rather a poor one in some respects, but the best that the lacahty afforded. The preparation of the grouud was difficult on account of the marshy and boggy nature of the soil, and much cutting of timber aud underbrush was necessary before measurement could proceed. 'J'he liue was 3 G77 metres in length, aud three iudepeudent tape measures of it were made by .Assistant 1Velker, aided by Mr. C. C. Yates. The results proved very satisfactory, the extreme range of difference in the three measures being only one-fifth of au inch. . ~ieauwhile the triangulation from l\lary Island to Port Simpson was carried on by Assistant Dickms, :tided by Mr. 0. B. Freuch aud Heeonlers II. A. Grady and R L. Livingston, the steamer Fttclt and a whaleboat furnishing the means of transportation from station to station. The portion across Dixon E11trnnce was both difficult and dangerous, a~ rough seas or heaYy ground swells near!y always prevail there, making the landings more or less hazanlons. 'rhe entire work Was successfully completed by September 5, wheu the steamer Ji'1icct returned to :'.\'.lary Island for

Assistant Dickins was subsequently engaged at the suboffice in San Francisco in completing his records, computing his astronomical geodetic observations, and on miscellaneous office duty. On J une l 7 he received instructions to prepare for certain triangulation work i~ southern California, and until t.he close of the fiscal year was engaged in making the necessary arrangements. The subsequent services of the other members of the Alaska parties in other sections of the country are noticed under the appropriate geographical headings in preceding parts of this report. Tidal r-ecords at vari01ts foreign ports.-Tbrough the courtesy of the Hawaiian Government Survey, this office has been furnished at various times during the fiscal year with tracings from the maregrams of the self.registering tide gauge at Houoluln, and a continuous record of the tides from Juno 16, 1891, to March 31, 1896, is now in our possession. The Japanese Government, in response to our request for tidal observations, has kindly furnished a copy of the tabulation of quarter-hourly Teadings from the automatic tide gauge at Yokohama for the calendar year 1893. We arc ajso indebted to the British admiralty and the French Hydrographic Ofli.ce for-.tida1 data received, as follows: From the former, a copy of tidal and current observati-0ns made in Seymour Narrows, British Cplumbia, during the years 1894 and 189i:i; from the latter, harmonic consta11ts for Brest and St. Servan, together with hourly ordinates of the tide at Havre for the month of February, 1896.

ABSTRACT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE ASSIST.ANT .IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE.
ser~ed as.Assistant in Charge of the Office during the year, except while absent m Europe as

Iu Office l~eport No. 1 will be found ii~ fall the annual report of Mr. 0. H. Tittmann, who

Uu1ted States delegate to the International Geodetic Associati,.on, or while acting as Superintendent during absences of the latter; on such occasions he was temporarily relieved by Assistants Andrew Braid and E. D. Preston. Assi&tant Tittmann's report sets forth in general terms the progress made in the various branches of the office work under his charge, calls special attention to important features, and refers for details and statistics to the accompanying annual reports of the several chiefs of divisions. The computing division has continued under the able direction of Assistant C. A. Schott, who has found time amid the pressure of other work to prepare a number of special reports on impor~ant operations and computations. A new discu~sion of the secular ·variation of the magnetic torce in the United States, and adjacent foreign countries, and a paper on the distribution of magnetic declination in the United States for the epoch January 1, 1900, may be specially mentioned as valuable contributions to our knowledge on the subject of magnetics. The former has been published as an Appendix to the Report for 18fl5, and the latter will appear as Appendix :Xo. 1 of this Report. Four other appendices prepared by him, referring to the results of precise leveling in various parts of the country, will also appear in this report. 'From time to time, as opportunity offered, various assist~)nts of the Survey, when not engaged on field duty or the reductions and computations of tlieir field results, have been assigned to the computing division; a list, with the special services performed by each, will be found in Assistant Schott's report. · ~lie tidal division was under the .direction of Mr. L. P. Shidy until the middle of July, when Assis~aut E .. B. Latham was placed in charge. Tli.e latter was relieved in February, and was succeeded early in March by Assistant Il. L. Marindin, the present chief of tlie division. Mr. M:arindin's report is very complete and shows in 1letail the large amount of work accomplished during the year. Aids A. F. Zust and ll. C. Denson were temporarily assigned to duty in the tidal division, the former from December rn to June 30, anu the latter from December 19 to May 5. The d~awing an1l engraving divisions were at the beginning of the fiscal year consolidated under the direction of Assistant W. \.V, Duffield, who has efficiently performed the duties of chief. Th~ Assistant in Charge of the Office reports that the consolidation has proved beneficial and rehend him of much labor incident to coordinating the work of two divisions. He calls special attention to the unusually large output of charts during the year. l\Ir. Dnffield's report contains much interesting matter and shows the very satisfactory progress made in all brapches of the work under bis charge. In tlie drawing ·section U drawings for charts were completed during the year, and 8 others are in progress: 14 drawings for illustrating the Annual Report were completed; 9 sect~on maps of the District of Columbia were verified for engraving; 13 topographic and 29 hydrograp'hic projections for field parties were constructed; a large number of original sheets were inked and prepared for reg1strat10n; and 47 calls for informat.ion from Departments of the ~1overnm~nt and from t.he public, many of them involving the preparation of tracings and draw. ID~~' received attention. In the engraving section 11 copperplates of new charts and 33 of new ed1t1ons were completed, and 44 others were begm1; numerous plates for sketches and illustrations

56

and for section maps of the District of Columbia were begun, continued, or completed, and 505 plates were cor::-~cted for printing. Iu the electrotyping and photographing section 28 bassos and 24 altos were completed, representing a deposit of nearly 1 700 pounds of copper; and 123 negatives and 1 246 silver, blue, bromide, and uigrosine prints were made. In the chart-printing section over 66 000 impressions were struck off, 60 000 of whicb were delivered to the chart divi· sion for issue. A detailed statement of the contract engraving of the year will also be found in .Assistant Duffield's report. The chart division bas continued, as heretofore, under the able direction of .Assistant Gershom Bradford. His report gives the usual statistical information as to the publication, distribution, a.nd issue of charts and the receipts therefrom. One table of special interest gives a comparison between the issues of the present year and those .of the seven years preceding, from which it appears that the total issue has increased 25 p~r cent over that of last year, and 20 per cent over the average of seven years; this is partially accounted for, however, by the continued free distribution to public libraries. Mr. Bradford also reports the completion of the new edition of the Chart Catalogue, which will be published in the near future. The instrument division has continued under the charge of .Assistant J. F. Pratt, and his report shows that a large amount of work has been accomplished during the year. Special mention is made of the construction and erection of the tidal indicator for needy Isla11d, Delaware H.iver; the construction of a photographic enlarging and reducing apparatus for the drawing and engray ing division; the progress made in the construction of the new tide-predicting machine for the use of the tidal division; and the construction of the 50-metre comparator for the Office of Standard Weights and Measures. The miscellaneous division has continued under the 'Charge of Mr. W. P. Uamsey, and bis report gives full statistics relative to the distribution and sale of the various publications of the Survey, and the number of reports, appendices, lmlletins, Coast Pilots, Tide Tables, and ~otices to Mariners received from tlte Public i~rinter. Fourteen new agencies for tbe sale of charts and other publications were established during the year, 7 of them being on tbe Atlantic and Gulf coasts, 6 on the Pacific Coast, and 1 at Hamburg, Germany. Only 1 agency wa.s discontinued, and the total number now existing is given as 103. The library and archives division continued tlnoughout the year under the direction of Mr. H. Sidney King. His report gives the usual information in regard to additions to the library and the receipt aud registration of field records and sheets, etc. In the immediate office of tbe .Assistant in Charge, Messrs . .A. B. Simons and E. B. Wills and Misses Sophie Hein and Kate Lawn have efficiently performed their respective duties. Assista4ts W. C. Hodgkins and E. B. J_,atharn were for a time engaged on special duty under Assistant Tittmann's direction, the former in examinations relating to the Alaska boundary, and the latter in bringing up to date tbe bibliography of the Survey. ABSTRACT OF THE ANNU.AJ_, UEPOH.T OF THE HYDROGR.A.PHIC INSPECTOR Lieut. Commander Jeff F. Moser, U. S. N., served as Hydrographic Inspector from the beginning of the fiscal year until April 301 18!)6, on which date 11e was relieved by Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Uolby, U. S. N., who bad previously been engaged on field duty in charge of the steamer Bla1ce. The latter has submitted a full report of the hydrographic work executed during tlie year by the na\'al parties under Jus and his 11redecessor's direction, accompanied by reports from the naval officers" in immediate charge of the hydrographic aud Coast Pilot divisions of the Office, which are also under his general direction. Statistical tables, showing the results accomplishell by each hydrographic field party, the number of naval omcen; attacbed to each, the list of vessels employed on the work, and the amounts of money expended for repai1·s of each vessel are also give11. 'flie hydrographic division remained under the immediate charge of Lieut. Vhtlte1· McLean, U.S. N., from the beginning of the fiscal year until Noyember 7, when, hii:> services being required l>y the Navy Department, he was detached from this office. He was succeeded by Lieut. Hugh Uodman, who assumed cbarge of the division on the 20th of December, and continued as its chief

to the close of the fiscal year. His report shows that a large amount of work has beei1 aecomplished, and that each member of the division, by his zeal and efficiency, has contributed to the satisfactory result indicated. Fifty-two hydrographic sheets have been 1lrawn and platted during the year, and these involved the study and discussion of 25.3 volumes of records and the platting of !:14 794 angles and 372 493 soundings. In addition to this, a large amount of miscellaneous work was attended to, such as the verification and revision of proofS, drawings, and charts, the rnakiug and verification of tracings and projections, the reduction and platting of tidal data, comparisons of old and ne\v surveys, the indication of corrections to charts, the preparation for publication of the monthly N oticen to Mariners, etc. The Coast Pilot division also remained under the charge of Lieut. Walter McLean, U.S.~., from July 1 to October 21, at. which latter date he was relieved by Ensign Glennie Tarbox, U.S. X., who continued in charge to the close of the fiscal year. The annual report of the division, rendered by the latter, shows very satisfactory progress in this branch of the work also. Part YII of the Coast Pilot publication has been completed and sent to the printer, and considerable progress has been made in the preparation of Part YIU, which will inchule tho whole Gulf Coast of the United States. During the winter, or from January 12 to l\fay 21, Ensign Tarbox, accompanied by Nautical Expert John Hoss of the Ooast Pilot division, was engaged in visiting various parts of the Gulf Coast and collecting miscellaueous information for the compilation of this volume. The full account of this work has already been given nuder foe liead of field work. The division has also attended to various other matters, such as proof reading and the correction to date of former volumes of the Ooast Pilot. The employees of thiS; division are also complimented for their highly satisfactory service. The Hydrographic Inspector's report and the divisiou reports above referred to are printed in full farther on under the title of" Office Report :No. 2." AHSTH.ACT OF THE ANNUAI_, l{EPOHT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHAHGE OF THE OFFICE OF STANDAH.D WEIGHTS A:ND MEASURES. Assistant Andrew Braid assumed charge of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures on July l, 1895, and has served continuously since tliat date. His annual report, which is publishe1l in foll as Office Ifoport No. 4, shows that a large amount of work has been accomplished, and gives a full account of several important operations and investigations successfully carried on and com})leted during the year, vfa, the construction of a 50-metre comparator for the more accurate determination of linear values, particularly of base bars; the redetermination of the lengths and constants of two secondary base bars; the standardization of the uew "duplex" base bars by means of the 50-metre comparator and a standard in ice; the determination of the relation between the "Committee metre" aud the new "Prototype metre No. 21;" aud the construction of certain electrical standards. A tabular statement of the work done for other Departments and Bureaus, and for outside parties, accompanies the report. The regular force of the office has remained unchanged, aud various assistau ts have from time to time been detailed for short periods to aid i11 special operations. Assistant Andrew Braid has also had charge of the preparation and editing of the Superintendent's Annual Heport, and has on various occasions acted as Assistant iu Charge of the Office of the Coast and Geodetic Survey aud as executive officer. SUPEHINTENDENT'S OFFICE. In the Superintendent's otlice, Assistant E. D. Preston has performed the responsible duties of executive oflicer, and during the absence of Assistant 0. H.

His report, giving a detailed account of all expenditures made during the year for tbe Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Office of Standard Weights and Measures is published in full as Office Report No. 3. seBOFFICES. The San Francisco sulwffice throughout the year was in charge of Assistant A. F. Rodgers, who has submitted a full report of its operations. '.rhe various field operations over which he had general direction were conducted by Assistants .J. .T. Gilbert, R F. Dickins, and Fremont ::\forse, and Messrs. Ferdinand \Vestdal1l and F. W. Edmonds, and have been already described under their appropriate headings in the "Abstract of' field reports." Special mention, 110wever, should be made of the continuation of the topographical resurvey of San Francisco Bay and Harbor; the investigation of reported changes in Cuylers Ilarbor, San )figuel Island; the continuation of tidal observations at Sausalito station; and the selection of a site for a new observatory. and its connection with the Lafayette Park station and the California triangulation. The assistants named nbove also took part in the computations, reductions, and general office work, aud besides worke1l up the results·of their own previous field surveys.in Washington and Alaska; :'.\Iessrs Ferdinand \Vestdalil and P. W. Edmonds also attended t-0 the drafting and clerical duties and assisted in tho voluminous correspondence and the preparation of data and information furnished in response to special calls .. ~fr. Emmet Gray served as tidal observer at the Sausalito station until April 1, when he was succeelle<l by l\'.Ir. H. S. Ballard. The Philadelphia suboffice was discontinued at the close of the previous fiscal year, not being deemed longer essential on account of its proximity to the main office at Washington.

OFFICE REPORT NO. 1-1895.

REPOH.T OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE FOB. THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 189G.
UNITED STA.TES COA.S'.l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE,

lVa.~liington, D. O., Jmie 30, 1896. Sm: I beg leave to submit herewith the annual reports of the chiefs of tpe divisions of this Office, which was placed under my charge at the beginning of the fiscal year. Mr. E. D. Preston was Acting Assistant in Charge from the middle of September to the end of October, during my absence in Europe while attending the meetings of the luternational Geodetic Association as United States delegate by appointment of the President. The computing division has been continued under the able direction of Assistant C. A. Schott. I beg leave to call especial attention to the fact that the computations relating to the transcontinental arc have been advanced as far as practicable. Among the numerous reports submitted is a new discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic force in the United States and adjacent parts which has appeared as Appendix No. 1 of the Annual l~eport for 1895. He also completed the collection of observed magnetic declinations with a view to publishing a new isogonic chart for the epoch January 1900. The tidal division was under the charge of Mr. L. P. Shidy until the middle of July when Assistant E. B. Latham was put in cliarge. The latter was relieved in February and was succeeded by Assistant II. L. l\1arindin who had charge from March 5 to the end of the fiscal year. I beg leave to refer to the· report of Mr. Marindin for the details of the highly important work accomplished in this di vision through the zealous labors of its members. Great attention has been paid to perfecting the tide tables, wliich in their present form reflect credit, not only on the labors of this Office, but, owing to their general usefulness to mariners engaged in the world's commerce, on the country at large. The tidal division acknowledges its indebtedness to the Corps of Engineers, United States Army, for their cooperation in securing tidal data, and also to foreign tidal offices. The drawing and engraving division was under the efficient direction of Assistant W.W. Duffield during the whole of the fiscal. year. The consolidation of the two divisions nuder one head has relieved the Assistant in Charge of the Office of the necessity of coordiuating the labors of two separate divisions, and has therefore simplified the Office routine. Attention is called to the unusually large output of charts. The chart division has remained under the systematic and energetic administration of Assistant Gershom Bradford, who has, in addition to the regular duties of his office, made many valuable suggestions to the chart board in preparing schemes for the publication of charts. The instrument division has been under the charge of Assistant J. F. Pratt. The construction of the Reedy Island tidal indicator, provided for by act of Congress, was iutrusted to Mr. Pratt, who uot only personally directed its construction but its erection on the site selected for it. Ile also designed and superintended the construction of a photographic. enlarging apparatus. The miscellaneous division was under the charge Mr. W. P. Ramsey. In addition to the

of

78

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

duties previously performed in this division the additional one of keeping all the accounts relating to Office expenses and of making the purchases was tramiferred to it at tl1e beginning of the fiscal year. The division of library aud archives has been under the direction of Mr. H. Sidney Kini:r, who makes various recommendations in regard to work to be done in the division under his charge. The reports without exception commend the services of the employees, and in this counectioi1 I beg leave to advert to the faithful services rendered by l\fr. A. B. Simons, clerk to the Assii,;tant in Charge, Mr. E. B. Wills, :Miss Sophie Hein, and Miss Kate Lawn, who have served in the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge. Assistants W. C. Hodgkins and E. B. Latham reported to me for special duty during the year. The former was engaged in special examinations relating to the Alaska Boundary and the 111.tter in extending to 18!}6 the bibliography of the Survey as given in Ap11endix No. 11, Heport for 18!)1.

REPORT OF THE COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SUI~VEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAH ENDING JUNE 30, 1896. June so, 1891}. Srn: In conformity with the regulations of the Survey, I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report of the work done in the computing division of the Oflice <luring the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896. The charge of. the division has remained with the undersigned, the number of computers is the same as in the past· year, and the computing division I'eceive<l temporary assistance during part of the year as follows: The services of J. Pawling were dispensed with September 30, 1895, F. W. Clay taking the place vacated by him on October 22, 1895; J. B. Boutelle reported for duty in the divh;ion Sep· tember 12, 1895, and remained to the close of the fiscal year; D. Hurley was attached to the division up to February 4, 1896. The following members of the field force were temporarily engaged in the division: E. B. Latham on five days in July, 1895; H. G. Ogden throughout the year; H. P. Ritter seven days in August, 1895, and between October 14, 1895, and March 2, 1896; H. C. Denson between November 8 and December 30, 1895, and from May G to June 16, 1896; F. D.

The duties devolved upon me as chief of the division include the direction of the work and distributing the same among the computers according to their special qualifications, and the timing of it to secure cooperation; also the examination and reporting of the results and the preparation of data or iuformation required by official correspondence and relating to this division, also the supplying the charts with notes respecting names of observers and magnetic data. These duties were promptly attended to, and time was found to collect and tabulate the results of gravity researches from pendulum observations made by the Survey <luring the interval 1873-1895 for· trensmission to the Iuternational Geodetic Association in response to a call made; also to prepare for the same aRsociation a colored map showing the state of the work of triangulation in the United States up to date. I have also submitted the manuscript of a new discussion of the secular variation of the magnetic force in the TTnited States and adjacent parts, forming Appendix No. 1 in the Annual Report for 1895, and completed the collection of observed magnetic declinations with a view of publishing a new isogonic chart f(ll' the epoch January, moo. I have also made the following computations: 'l'he azimuth observed at Camp Davidson, Alaska, 18!}1; the longitude of the same camp from obi;ervations of occultations and an eclipse; the length of the secondary base line

REPORT OF THE TIDAL DIVISION, OOAST AND GEODETIO SURVEY OFFIOE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.
TIDAL DIVISION, June 30, 1896. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the tidal division for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896: The Tide Tables for 1896 were read and revised in proof. The corresponding volume for 1897, which is similar in form to that of the preceding year, was prepared for publication, and all but 31 pages of it was read and revised in proof within the year. The predictions for 1897 have been strengthened at a number of stations by extending the analysis of observations wherever practicable, and several hundred new stations were added to the list of subordinate points. Full predictions were made for the first time for Willets Point, N. Y., where the tides have an average range of more than 7 feet, and whicll, from its position at the entrance to the East River, seemed a desirable addition. The full predictions for Marseilles, France, were discontinued because, having a tide of only about half a foot mean range, it was considered of no practical importance to navigation. The predictions for Savannah Entranee, Georgia, which were formerly given for Fort Pulaski, are now given for Tybee Island Light, because we have better observations there. The predictions for San Francisco, Cal., which were formerly given for North Bead1, are now given for Fort Point, in the Golde11 Gate, as being nearer the bar, and because our tidal observations were made there. The table of sunrise and sunset llas been extended so as to contain 81 degrees instead of 63 degrees of latitude in each hemisphere, and the times of rising and setting are given for every fifth instead of every seventh day. The work of preparing the tide tables for 1898 was taken up as soon as the tables for 1897 were out of the way, and predictions have·been made for 28 stations. Harmonic analyses have been made from a year each of hourly ordinates at Willets Point, N. Y.; Biloxi, Miss.; Port Eads, La.; Mazatlan, Mexico; Sheerness, England, and Cape Town, Africa. At· Baltimore, Md., a year of high and low waters has been analyzed. For St. Johns, Newfoundland; Vera Oruz, Mexico, and St. Michael, Alaska, short series of hourly ordinates were red'uced. The total work done on the harmonic analyses during the year is the equivalent of the complete analysis of about eight years of continuous records. The nonharmonic reductions completed during the year consist of 22 series, the equivalent of about three years of continuous observations. A table of the coefficients for correcting the uneliminated effect of one harmonic component upon another has been computed for series of 16 different lengths, varying from about a month up to one year. These coefficients will be of more especial use for short series, but will improve the results from even a whole year of harmonic analysis. The proof of sheets of Appendix No. 7, Report for 1894, constituting Part III of a Manual of Tides, was read and revised. The preparation of Parts I and II of this Manual has been continued ·. It is expected that these t.wo parts will be completed in time to constitute an appendix to the H.eport for 189G. The location of all tidal stations, where a year or more of observations has been obtained, was indicated upon a base chart by symbols denoting series of various lengt.bs. Tide notes have been prepared and furnished for 182 stations ou 60 charts. S. Doc. 35--6

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Requisitions from \6 field parties have been filled, requiring the description of 61 bench marks and tidal data for 17 statious. 'l'idal information has been called for by 5.3 persons not connected with the Survey, the response to which required the preparation of 35 descriptions of bench marks, current tables for 6 stations, and tidal data for 106 stations, together with technical letters explaining- tidal phenomena. An aggregate of about eight and one-half years of record from automatic tide gauges has been received, examined, and registered. There were 111 original and 104 duplicate volumes of tidal observations made by hydrographic parties with staff and box gauges received, examined, and registered during- the year. About two years of tabulated hourly heights <1f the sea, high and low waters, temperature and density of the sea, and meteorological data were received. Continuation of tlte tidal record at the automatic· gauge station at Willets Point, Long Island, N. Y.-The automatic tide gauge established July 1, 1891, at Willets Point, Long Island, N. Y., has been kept in successful operation by the kind supervision of officers of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. A., stationed at that point. The record for l\farch, 1896, was lost because of ice, and at the request of the officer in charge the series was discontinued early in J.une, 1896. The observers were Lieuts. R. R. H.aymond and ·wmiam H. Brown, U. S. A. A1ttomatfo tide gauge and tide indicator maintained in operation at Fort Hamilton, The Narrows, New York Harbor.-The automatic tide gauge aud tide indicator established in December, 1892, and in May, 1893, on the wharf of Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, by the permissioJt of the commanding officer of the fort, have been kept in successful operation during the fiscal year. The gauge and indicator have been in charge of Mr. J. G. Spaulding throughout the year. Automatic tide gauge and tide indicator established at Reedy Island Quarantine Station, Dela. ware.-An automatic tide gauge and tide indicator were established at Reedy Island Quarantine Station, Delawa·re, in January, 1896, and continued in successful operation to the close of the fiscal year. The gauge and indicator are under the direction of Dr. A. H. Glennan, surgeon Marine-Hospital Service, with Mr. Harry Hehl as observer. The tide indicator is similar to the one at The Narrows, New York Harbor, described in Notice to l\:lariuers, No. 177, for February, 1894. Co;itinuation of the tidal record at the automatic gau,qe .ytation at lVa.~hington (navy-yard), D. 0.-A continuous record has been obtained for the fiscal year from the automatic tide gauge established in July, 1891, at Washington (navy-yard), D. C. Tlle gauge has been kept in operation by members of the tidal division of the Office, Assistaut Henry L. Marindin, chief of the di vision. Continuation of the tidal 1·ecord at Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, South Garolina.-The automatic tide gauge established in March, 1894, at Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, South Carolina, bas been kept in successful operation by the supervision of officers of the Corps of Engineers, U.S. A., stationed at the fort. . The i·ecord is generally kept by the officer in charge until tabulated for use in the harbor improvements, and theu the origiual is sent to this Office to keep. During the fiscal year we have received the record from March 17, 1894, to March 1, 1896. Automatic tide gauge established at Port Royal Naval Station, South Oarolina.-An automatic tide gauge was established at Port Royal Naval Station, Soutll Carolina, in April 1896, by the permission of the commanding officer of the station. The gauge has been in charge of Mr. B. W. Weeks, who has kept it in successful operation to the close of the fiscal year. Tidal observations from Port Eads, La.-The Oorps of Engineers, U. S. A., kindly loaned us the record from their automatic tidal gauge at Port Eads, La., for the calendar year 1895, from which we take tabulated hourly ordinates. Automatic tide ga.uge csfoblished at Brazos Santia.go Light-House, Te:r;as.-An automatic tide gauge was established at Brazos Santiago Light-House, Texas, in March, 1896. This gauge was located inside of a narrow and shallow passage leading to a large lagoon. The range of tide was only about half a foot, i;o tllat the station was discontinued June 26, 1896. The gauge was in cl.large of Mr. William Anderson. Continuation of the tidal 1·ecord at the automatic gauge station at Sausalito, Oal.-The auto· matic tide gauge station at Sausalito, Cal., which was begnu in February, 1877, has been kept in

Automatic tide gauge at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands.'"--Through the courtesy of the Hawaiian Government Survey this Office ha8 been fumished, duriug the fiscal year, with tracings from the automatic tide gauge at Honolulu, Hawaiian Islands, from July 1, 1894, to March ::n, 1896, making a continuous record since June 16, 1891. Mr. Curtis J. Lyons has been in charge of the gauge. Tidal observations from Yokohama, Japan.-In response to our request for tidal observations the .Japanese Government has furnished us with quarter.hourly readings from its automatic tide gauge at Yokohama for the calender year 1893. ' Tidal and current observation.~ from the Admiralty, London, England.-In reply to our request the Admiralty sent us a copy of their tidal and current observations in Seymour Narrows, British Columbia, made in 1894 and 1895. Tidal observations from the Service IJydrographique de la .illarine, Paris, France.-In reply to our request the hydrographic office sent us harmonic constants for Brest and St. Servan, together with hourly ordinates of the tide at Havre for the month of February, 1896.

The force of engravers has remained as reported in the Annual Report, June 30, 1895. The old or ex.pert engravers have been employed, as heretofore 'Stated, on the branches of work whicli they have made specialties, with the exception of such interruption' as was necessary through the corrections arising from resurveys, and work necessary to prepare the plates for publication. This fiscal year has been an exception in this character of work, for most of the important charts have been corrected from surveys made by the United States Engineers, involving a great deal of change, not only in the work itself but also in notes to give the necessary credit for the work. In this particulat' it has been of great ad.vantage to the engraving division, for where a reduction of new work has been needed to advance a plate for publication, the work or reduction has been made with the least possible delay, and as a consequence we have saved time and been enabled to give the latest information on the charts before they were published. There is no question that, for the good of the service, the consolidation of the two divisions was just what was needed to enhance the value of our work a.nd improve the general condition of the charts. Contracts were awarded to R. F. Bartle & Co., June 28, 1895, for engraving outlines, hydrography, topography, etc., on 10 charts, as follows, the work to be completed within two years:

They also completed eight sheets of the topographical map of the District of Columbia, in all 32 plates; also progress sketch No. 16, Nevada and Utah, scale 1-1 000 000. Although the requisitions for printing from the chart division during the latter part of the fiscal year decreased to such an extent that the presses did uot have more than half the work to keep them up to full time, yet the average through the year was by far in excess of any previous years, viz, by about 14 000 copies for the chart division. This is mainly due to the management of :Mr. D. N. Hoover, the foreman in charge. . The personnel of the printing rooms was changed during the year for the good of the service, as follows: Richard S. Bright, printer, was transferred to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing September 12, 1895, and James L. Smith, printer, was transferred from that Bureau to the Office September 13, 1895, in place of Mr. Bright. W. M. Conn was appointed as a printer's help July 15, 1895. William H. Waddington, printer's help, was dismissed January 31, 1896, for cause, and Charles Buckingham, employed on temporary roll, was appointed in his place. Richard J. Fondren was appointed February 7, 1896, as a laborer, and detailed to printing rooms as a help during the time when there was a great deal of work to be done. The electrotype and photograph rooms, under the management of Mr. Louis P. Keyser, have been very properly carried on and have been very successful in the development of all kinds of work that required intelligent and businesslike capacity. The general work of the divisions has been performed by Mr. John II. Smoot, clerk, iu his usual acceptable manner. The correspondence and detail work connected with photolithographing was performed by Mr. John H. Hobgood in a very satisfactory manner until he was transferred to the General Post-· Office Department March 20, 1896. He was succeeded by Mr. Arthur H. Bailey on the 16th of April, 1896, who was duly certified by the Civil Service Commission, and has displayed fine ability in conducting the business assigned to him, and in a manner highly acceptable to the Office. It gives me much pleasure to testify to the general interest taken iu the work in both divisions by the employees, and to their close atwntion to their respective duties. Respectfully submitted.

The total issue is 25 per cent larger than that of last year and 20 per cent larger than the average of the previous seven years. The net sales (gross sales less copies returned by sales agents) have increased !) per cent in copies and 8 per cent in value as compared with the previous year, and are 4 p<>r cent less in copies and value than the average of the previous seven years. The net sales show a steady decrease from 1890 to 1894, and have increased since at about the same ratio. The distribution of charts to libraries has been continued, and the large number sent accounts to a considerable degree for the exceptioually large total issue this year. Tlrn uew edition of the chart catalogue has been prepared, and its publication is expected in the near fntnre. The edition of 1894 is exhausted, about 1 000 copies llaving been distributed during the year. The currespondence for the year amounted to 2 719 letters written.

One hundred and eighty requisitions have been received from field parties aml from the 'l'he filling of many of these has required several days' work of the entire working· force. This work and the repair and construction of carrying and packing cases for field iustrumeuts is not shown in the foregoing tables. 'l'he construction of a 50-metre comp:trator and protecting shed, with the necessary adjusting to insure successful operation, has extensively drawn on tlle resources of the division, 335~ working days of the various members of the skilled force llaving been devoted to it. A photographic enlarging and reducing apparatus has been designed and completed for the photographic house. This apparatus is very comprehensive in design and sufficiently large for map purposes. Negatives up to 24 inches can be used iu it, enlargements can be made up to 4 by 5 feet, and reductions down to lantern slides or even less size. The design and working drawings for, aud also the construction of all the mechanical parts for a tidal indicator with a dial 30 feet in diameter were made in the division, after which it was erected at Reedy Island quarantine pier, Delaware River, under the direction of the chief of tbe division. This indicator has uow been in successful operation for six months. Detailed drawings for a tide-predicting machine, from data furnished by the tidal division, have been made, and the work of constructing the machine in the shops is as well advance<l as the more importaut .\vork would permit, about 400 of the working parts having been completed. I have to- call your attention to the very poor and trying ligbt in tbt1 instrument shop during the winter months. The books aud accounts of the division and the inventories of the field parties are in a very satisfactory condition. A detailed account Qf each day's work of each employee is kept on file in the division. It is with pleasure that I have to state tbat there is a hearty and conscientious interest shown by the various employees of tlw division in their respective duties.

REPORT OF THE LIBl~ARY AND ARCHIVES DIVISION, COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 18913.
LrnRA.RY .A.ND AROlHVES DIVISION, JunP- 30, 1896. Sm,: I have the honor t-0 submit the following report of the library and archives division for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896: LinRARY.

The cill'd catalogue has been brought up to date. In accordance with the recommendation made in my report last year the shelves in the librax·y have been numbered consecutively, from 1 to 875, the numbers placed on the title pages of the books thereon and entered on the catalogue cards, so that now the location of any book in the library can be ascertained by consulting the card catalogue. The library is becoming overcrowded and more shelf room is needed. I would recommend that the two rooms on the second floor, over those now occupied by the library, be fitted up with cases and shelving for the use of the library. A large number of United States Coast and Geodetic Survey charts, turned over to the library by the chart division, has been filed and arranged on shelves in the front room ·on fourth floor of "fireproof'" for future reference. Only 72 volumes have been added by purchase to the library during the fiscal year, as against 202 volumes purchased last year. Many new works recently published should be added to the library. .

Nothing has been done this fiscal year in preparing original records and computations for binding, as :Mr. E. H. Courtenay coultl not be spared from the computing division for that purpose. This work should be resumed as soon as practicable. The work of preparing original sounding records for binding, suspended last year, has not been taken up again for lack of proper help. This work, however, I thin1:r should be done in the hydrographic division, in the same way as the tidal records have been prepared for binding in the tidal division. No tidal records have been prepared for binding for some years in consequence of the tidal division not having any available force to put on that work. The collection of log books bas been removed from the back room of fourth story of "fireproof'' to the front room of third story. The back room of fourth story is still very much crowded, and I would recommend that the ball rooms on third an<l fourth floors of "fireproof" be fitted up with cases and shelving so that the back room of fourth floor can be relieved of a part of its contents. If these rooms were properly supplied with cases and shelving the boxes of ''bottom specimens" could be placed on sheh-es and thus become accessible. Thflre should also be put in some cases suitable for holcling charts, as those in front room of fourth floor are about filled up. More rack room is needed for filing tubes containing original sheets, and I would recommend that the racks now in use be extended upward to the ceiling.

FORCE OF TllE DIVISION.

Mr. Artemas Martin was employed in this division as clerk during the whole fiscal year. He had charge of registering all records and sheets and of filing the originals in the archives, and answered calls for the same, answered calls for books, and kept account thereof. lie also had charge of the preparing of books and periodicals for binding and of the preparation of montl1ly reports, etc., which duties, with many others, he has performed in a faithful, efficient, and satisfactory manner. Mr. John Dale resigned i::;epternber 16, 1895, to pra-Otice medicine in his native State. I deeply regret the resignation of Mr. Dale, as he was an efficient and useful clerk. Mr. Edward P. Lopez was appointed to tht! vacaucy caused by the resignation of Mr. John Dale, and reported for duty Octobr-r 3, 18fl5, and has been on duty in this division since that time. His duties have been various. He finished the uncompleted work of filing and listing the charts in front room on fourth floor of" fireproof;" answered calls for charts and maps; assisted in numbering the shelves and books in the library and in entering the numbers on the catalogue cards, aml made out cards for new books as they came in. He has performed his duties efficiently and satisfactorily. Mr. William li. Butler was employed in this division as messenger during the whole fiscal year, and bas performed his duties faithfully and efficiently and made himself especia1ly useful in many ways. Mr. Buford A. Lynch was assigned t-0 this division October 26, 1895, and was employed therein from that date to June 30, 1896, when be was assigned to field duty. Mr. Lynch assisted in numbering the shelves, books, etc., in the library, aml was also engaged in typewriting. l\Ir. James A.

UNI'.l.'ED ST..A.'l'ES COAST ..A.ND GEODE'l'IC SURVEY, OFFICE OF THE H YDROGR..A.PHIO INSPECTOR,

Washington, D. 0., June 30, 1896. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of hydrographic progress, including the movements and care of the Coast Survey vessels and the reports of the chief of the hydrographic division and chief of the Coast Pilot party. There is appended a list of the officers of the Navy who have been conuected with the Survey during the past year and a list showiug the duty that those remaining are engaged in at the end of the year 1895-96. Lieut. Commander Jeff. F. Moser, U.S. N., was Hydrographic Inspector from the beginning of the fiscal year to April 30, 18!.J6, on which date be was relieved by Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N.
HYDROGR..APHY-.A.TL..A.NTIC CO.AST.

At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Blake was undergoing repairs at Jersey City, which were completed on July 18, 1895. On the same day Lieut. Commander H. G. O. Colby, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast an<l Geodetic Survey, assumed command of the Yessel, and on July 20 sailed for Hyannis, Mass., arriving on July 22, and immediately prepared to carry out your instructions of May 17, commencing work on July 23. The work assigned to the Blake consisted of the hydrography north of Pollock Rip Slough; examination of certain reported shoals in the vicinity of Pollock l~ip; the resurvey of the eastern entrance of Nantucket Sound, between Monomoy Point and Great Point, Nantucket, and special developments of dangers in the approach to Hyannis Harbor. The hydrography in the entrance to Nantucket Sound included a close development of the greater part of Handkerchief Shoal, the passage between this shoal and l\fonornoy Point, a general survey of Butlers Hole, and the area. lying south of these localities and extending to Great Point, Nantucket. '.rhe latter work preseuted serious difficulties. Tbe conflicting tidal currents, the scarcity of signals, the utter lack of ranges, the prevailing southwest winds with accompanying very rough weather, made the work dangerous as weJI as diflicult. In the open passage the limits of the working ground necessitated the running of a series of short lines, with frequent turuings in a strong tideway among lobster pots and nets, and directly in the path of au immense number of coastwise vessels of every description, besides numerous small craft and fishing boats. In face of these difficulties the results of this survey have been very satisfactory, and settling, as they did, many doubtful points, were at once introduced on all charts. Tlie closing up of this gap completes the resurvey of Nantucket and Vineyard sound:> and their various apprnaches. At odd times during the season the Blake's party was engaged in looking for rocks and shoals in the vicinity of Hyannis and West Chop. Careful searches, both with lead and drag, were made in all cases finally determined. Bad weather Retting in in October and continuing during the first part of November, the season's work was closed on November 7. After obtaining at New Bedford

a new whaleboat, the Blake sailed for Baltimore, Md., stopping at Newport, New York, and Patuxent River, and arrivi11g at Baltimore on November 21, 1805, where she remained under repairs until January 21, 1896, when she started for Port Roya], S. C., stopping at Hampton Roads on a-0cotmt of bad weather; she arrived at Port Royal on the evening of January 27, 1896. In regard to the locality surveyed by the Blake last summer-the eastern entrance to Nantucket Sounu-I strongly recommend that more frequent examinations of this locality be made. The heavy northeast gales cause a constant shifting of the shoa]s and channels, and the great importance of these cha.nne1s, in my opinion, makes annual examinations necessary. Ou January 23 the Port Royal Sound work was commenced by searching for points. :i\fany difficulties in making a start were experienced, there being nothing to start from owing to the loss and destruction of triangulation stations by the storm of 1893. Two points were found and with these other stations were established, and the work begun, carrying the signals out beyond the bar by using trees and pumping them in.to the sand. Sounding was commenced 011 March 3, and continued until June 29, when the vessel was ordered to New York to refit for the season's work in Buzzards Bay. Lieut. Commander H. G. 0. Colby, U. S. N., was detached from the Blake on April 20, leaving Lieut. John A. Shearman, U. S. N., in charge until relieved by Lieut. Commander A. Dunlap, U. S. N., l\1ay 25. As I omitted in my report of last summer's work, while in command of the Blake, to commend the several officers of this party, I take pleasure in doing so now. Lieuts. John A. Shearman and W. S. Benson, U. S. N., and Ensigns A. 'l'. Long, H. A. Wiley, aud J. H. Reid, U. S. N., deserve credit for their untiring zeal and the accuracy displayed in the work. At the beginning of the fiscal year the steamer Bache, under the command of IAeut. R. G. Peck, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was engaged at the request of the Navy Department in the establishment of a trial course for the use of naval ve~sels in Long Island Sound. On July 25, having erected the necessary beacons, she proceeded to New Londou, Conn., and thence, with the Superintendent and Hydrographic Inspector on board, on a tour of inspection. to the parties working in the vicinity of New Bedford, Hyannis, and Boston, arriving at the latter place on July 30, 1895. On August 5, having fitted out the Coast and Geodetic Survey steam launch stored at the navy-yard, the Bache left Boston to engage in the special examination and development of dangers in the vicinity of Minots Ledge Light-House, Boston Light-House, Broad Sound, and a.long the coast between Nahant and the entrance to Salem Harbor. The very large number of Reparate examinations kept the party employed until September, when the work was begun on the resurrny of the waters between Marblehead and Mauchester. On November 1, having completed this work, the Backe returned to Boston. From September 18 to 27 the vessel and party was engaged in erecting beacons on the coast of Maine and Massachusetts for a speed-t.r:al course for the U.S. S. Indiana and Katah<lin. The hydrographic work of the season is shown on five "sheets, scale 1-10 000. Of the resurvey of Boston Bay and its approa-0hes, as projected, all the hydrography, with the exception of a sheet extending from Manchester to Gloucester, and the outside sheet covering the approaches, has been finished. This resurvey, as far as completed, is very thorough, and I most earnest]y recommend t11at it be taken up and completed as soon as circumstances will permit, and a photolithogrnphic chart of Salem Harbor be published as soon as possible on a scale of 1-20 000. Certain promineut landmarks on the shore of Boston Bay have been already indicated on the charts. On November G the Baclw left Boston for New York with steam launch No. 25 in tow; having turned the launch over to the .Eagre at New Bedford, .:\'.lass., she arrived at New Yori{ on November 12, where some slight repairs were made and the vessel prepared for her season's work on the Southern coast. Ou January 7, 1896, the Bache left New York, picked up at Hampton Roads the Coast Pilot party for traugportatiou to Pensacola, Fla., and arrived at Charleston, S. C., on January 14. After making several gpecial examinations, and taking on board a whaleboat for transportation, she left on January 20, arriving at Pensacola on January 20. The work of the season in Pensacola Bay consisted of hydrography to connect the previous work of the survey inside the bay with the work of the United States engineers on the bar and in the entrance; also a comprehensive system of

102

comparative tidal observations througl1out the whole bay and its tributaries, to establish a plane for the reduction of the Rotmdings of the diflerent parties engaged in the resurwy of the bay. On February 20, 18!:16, Lieutenant Peck proceeded with his part~' to Dry Tortug-as. Fla., where he made examinations iu the channels and located buoys as requested by the Navy Department. Lieutenant Peck reports the shore liue of all the keys (except Loggerhead Key, which was not examined) as radically changed, but that there is 110 appreciable change in the deep-water channels. From Tortugas the Bache proceeded to Key West Harbor where the rock on which the Raleigh struck was located and developed. Returuing to Pe11sacola on March 20, the work was resumed and successfuily finished on April 18, completing the resurvey of tliese waters. On April 27 the Bcwlte left Pensacola carrying a naphtha launch to be delivered at Baltimore, Md. Off l\fatanzas Inlet a specimen of the water from the sea spring- in that locality was obtained for the H,eusselaer Polytechnic Institute; on arrival at Baltimore, :i\Iay G, the naphtha launch was turned over to the schooner Jlfatchless. Leaving Baltimore on :i\lay 12, examinations were made on Blackfish Bank, off Assateague, Virginia, on Isle of Wight. Shoal, Fenwick Island Shoal, and off Ocean City, Md.; these finished, the Bache returned to New York May 30, 1896, and is now undergoing slight repairs anrl preparing for work on the Easteru coast. The results of the work performed by Lieutenant Peck and the party under his command have been highly satisfactory. All the work shows the same excellent judgment and perfect execution as in former seasons. The schooner Ragre, under the command of Lieut. G. C. Hanus, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the beginning of the fiscal year was engaged in the hydrographic resurvey of New Bedford Harbor and approaches. This work was continued until the latter part of December when it was stopped by the weather. During January and Febrnary, while in New Bedford and 110 field work possible, the boats and steam launches attached to the vessel were overhauled and repaired, and the vessel refitted for work of the ensuing season. As soon as the .weather permitted, the l1ydrography of the inner harbor of New Bedford was resumed, and on April 16, 1896, completed. The resurvey of New Bedford Harbor and its approaches, shown on four hydrographic sheets on a scale of 1-10 000, is very complete. Numerous dangers were discovered. I would strongly recommend that this survey be at once utilized aud a new chart of Bedford Harbor, on a scale of 1-20 ooo, be published for issue as soon as possible. On April 21 the l!Jctgl'e sailed from New Bedford Harbor; between this date and l\Iay 2 stations for current and comparative tidal observations were occupied and signals erected for the continuation of the hydrography in Buzzards Bay. On May 2 headquarters were established at Marion, :Mass., and on May 4 soundiug was commeuced at the head of Buzzards Bay. At the end of the fiscal year the party is continuing the resurvey at the head of the bay. Special acknowledgment is due Lieutenant Hanus for the excellence and accuracy of the work performed by bis party. His experience, gained in previous long duty on the Coast and Geodetic Survey, has specially fitted him for this work. The steamer Endeavor, under the command of Lieut. L. l\I. Garrett, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the beginning of the fiscal year was engaged in making special examinations in Long Island Sound near Davids Islaud and off Kelsey Point. On August 5 she reached the working ground of the season, which covered the waters lying to the southward of Block Island Sound and the east end of Loug Island, including outlying dangers off Montauk Point. Sounding commenced on August 20 and continued until stopped by bad weather on November 11, 1895, leaving the work unfinished. Lieutenant Garrett had been instructed to <~evelop the 30-f'athom curve hy Jines of soundings run I mile apart, but it was found that the 30-fathom curve, with but few exceptions, extended outside the limits of the sheet that was furnished him. '.I.'he work executed by Lieutenant Garrett and the party under his command is in every respect excellent and reflects great credit on the party. 'fhe Rndcavor arrived in Baltimore on November 19, 1895, and remained there on account of appropriations being insufficient to send her South. On April 20, 1896, Lieut. L. M. Garrett, U. S. N., was detached from duty in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and on May 13 Lieut. W. S,

Benson, U. S. N., assumed command of the vessel and party. Leaving Baltimore on May 13, the Endeavor arrived on the working ground of the previous season 011 :May 18, and is at present engaged in continuing the hydrography heretofore mentioned. This party has been shorthanded since Lieutenant Benson took commau<l, there being only one other officer, Lieut. J. J. Blandin, U. S. N., attached to the vessel. Great credit is due the party for the amount and excellence of their work, for, uotwithRtanding the need of more help, they have accomplished us much and the work is as good as has ever been done. ·
IIYDIWGRA.PHY-PACIFIC COAST.

The work 011 the Pacific Coast has, with the except.ion of tlie Patterson's surveys in southeast Alaska, consisted almost entirely of the retmrvey of 8an l~raucisco Bay and its approaches. At the beginning of tl10 fiscal year the steamer Patte1·son. and her party, under the command of Lieut. Commander E. K. Moore, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was actively engaged in the survey of southeast Alaska, the season having begun on l\Iay 13. The area covered during the season of 1895 embraced that portion of Chatham Strait betweeu Point Augusta and Peril Strait, Peril Strait from its junction with Chatham Strait to ::5uloria Point, and Hooniah Sound. At the close of the seaso11, October 6, 1895, 11 hydrographic slieets, on various scales, had been finished, and these show the hydrographic survey of the area covered. The work, as in former seasons, comprised astrouomical observations, measurements of base lines, triaugulatiou, topography, and hydrography, inclmliug very complete tidal and occasional current observatious. The results obtained are very satisfactory, the records iucludiug 11 hydrographic sheets, 5 topographic sheets, arnl the tidal and current data referred to above. The topographic work has been largely increased and materially improved by the ad.ditiou of contour liues to the sheets. Acknowledgment is due Lieutenant-Commander Moore for the t.horoughuess of this work and for the exhaustive reports upon the territory co\·ered. A synopsis of these reports has been published as Bulletin No. 35. On October 6 the Patterson left Sitkii and proceeded to Fort Simpson. Having taken on board two civilian parties engaged in the boundary survey, she left Fort Simpson, towiug the Fuca and Earnest, ou October 8, and on October 16 arrived at Seattle, 'Vash., baviug· touched at Departure Bay and Victoria, British Columbia, on her way. Upon arrival at Seattle repairs on hull and machiuery w~re begun. During the progress of repairs the party was engaged in preparing for tlie oftice the data. obtained during the season The vessel is now ready fo1· the next season's work. The steamer Gedney remained in charge of Lieut. Lucian Flyune, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, until July 22, when Lieut. A. P. Osborn, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Goedetic Survey, assumed command of the party. During the fiscal year she has, together with the steamer McArth·ur, been engaged in the resurvey of San Francisco Bay and its approaches. In the resurvey of this bay-the most important harbor of the Pacific Coast of America-it is aimed to make the work as accurate and complete as our present methods aml means admit. It bas been planned to include the entire bay, its approaches, Sau Pablo Bay, and all headwaters; the work to be done, as far as practicable, on the same scale, using a uniform, rectangular system of lines, with special developments of rocks, shoals, and city water fronts. During the year work has been prosecuted by the Gedney on three sheets, two of which have been completed. These last cover that part of the bay lying between Fort Point, West Berkeley, and Point Iznbel, including Hichardson Bay and Raccoon Strait. Oousiderable progress has been made on the thfrd sheet, which lies to the northward of the completed work. Progress on the Fort Point sheet was unavoidably slow on account of tides and unfavorable weather, but when work was prevented by such conditions in one locality it was prosecuted in another, thus utilizing the resources of tlte party to the greatest advantag·e. The work was closed on December 4, 18957 on account of trnfavorable weather, the Gedney proceeding to Oakland, Cal., to prosecutP. the office work and prepare the vessel for the contiuuatiou of the work. On April l, 1896, the GednmJ resumed and carried on the work till April 10, when she was ordered to Santa Barbara Ohanuel to establish the course for the speed trial of the U. S. S.

104

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Oregon. 'rhe duty connected with the trial was finished on May 18, and she proceeded to San Miguel Island, California, to make an examination of Cuylers Harbor. Having completed this work on May 20, the Gedney returned to San Francisco and resumed her work in the bay. To meet the wishes of the Navy Department, which greatly desired a resurvey of Mare Island Strait, Lieutenant Osborn took up that part of the work on June 9, and successfully completed i.t on June 18. He then resumed work where left ofi~ aud is still engaged in its prosecution at the encl of the year. The finished sheets show every sign of the ~wcuracy desired, and the results are in every way satisfadory. The steamer JfcArthm·, commanded by Lieut. James H. Sears, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, has been engaged during the entire fiscal year, with the exception of thirteen days, in the resurvey of San Francisco Bay and its approaches. The work done by this party is comprised in sheets covering the Golden Gate and 13onita Channel and the area lying between San Francisco, Yerba Buena Island, and Oakland, and extending southward nearly to Point A visaclero. Separate sheets show work done along the water front of San Francisco, Mission Bay, and Sonoma Rock, the last named l>eing 011 a scale of 1-10 000. The party is now engaged on the hydrography between West Berkeley and San Francisco. The work has been greatly interfered with by the prevalence of high win<ls and fogs during the middle of the day; this necessitates beginning work at daylight. Better conditions are anticipated for the work in the southern portion of the bay. During thirteen days, May 7 to May 19, the JlfcArtltur was on duty in connect.ion with the speed trial of the U.S. S. Oregon in Santa Barbara Channel. Necessary repairs were made to this vessel during the year on days when it was impossibl<~ to prosecute the hyclrographic work. The work done in San Francisco Bay by the JfrArth1tr follows the plan described in the report of the hydrography done by the Gerlney, and is also entirely satisfactory in all respects.

HYDHOGR.A.PHIC DIVISION.

Lieut. Walter JfcLean, U.S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, having been detached from duty on the Survey on November 7, 18:15, the division was undet· the personal supervision of the Hydrographic Inspector until December 20, when J,ient.. Hugh l~odman, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, assumed charge. The numerous duties of this division have been ably and intelligently carried on. Through the courtesy of the Office of United States Engineers, which now fqrnishes this Office with blue prints of all improvements affecting charts, much a1lditional and very valuable data have been obtained and utilized; this has resulted in increasing the work of chart correction. I would call attention to the report of Lieutenant l~odmnn relating to the work performed by the division and his recommendations with regard to the employees. Lieutenant Hodma11 has displayed unusual zeal and intelligence in the conduct of the work of this division, his previous duty on the Coast and Geodetic Survey having specially fitted him for the work. In regard to the draftsmen connected with this Office, I respectfully refer you to the report of Lieutenant Rodman. I fully concur with him and approve his recommendations. The report of the chief of the hydrographic division is forwarded herewith.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

COAS'l' PILOT PARTY.

This party, at the beginning of the fiscal year, was mHler the charge of Lieut. "'Walter McIJean, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, who performed the duties of chief of tlie party in addition to his duties in dharge of the hydrographic division. On October 21, 1895, Ensign G. '..rarbox, U. S. N., Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey, assumed charge, and has continued the work of his predecessors. The work of this party is well known through the publications it prepares. From January 12 to May 21, 1896, the party was engaged in work in the field covering the coast of the Gulf of Mexico between Key West aud New Orleans, in the schooner Transit. Tlie report of the party submitted by Ensign 'l'arbox suggests the preparation of a second edition of tile United States Coast Pilot, Part VI, wllich I earnestly recommend. I beg to express my appreciation of the services of Ensign Tarbox while in charge of this party. The interest and zeal displayed by him, both in the office and field, merit special notice, as also do the services of Mr. John Ross, the nautical expert, for his ability and worth; his zeal has for many years merited my approbation, and I can recommend him for any furtller adYancement it may be possible to give him. I forward herewith the report of the chief of the Coast Pilot party.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC Su1ivEv,

Washin[Jton, D. C., J1me 30, 18.%'. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the hydrographic division during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896: Lieut. Walter McLean, U. S. N., was in charge until his detachmeut, November 7, 189.'5. I assumed charge on reporting for duty on December 20, 1895, the Hydrographic In!'pector personally supervising during the interval. The general routine and methods of previous years have been followetl, with the cultivation of more intimate relations with the Corps of Engineers, United State Army, whereby our charts have been vastly benefited by the addition of numerous and valuable improvements and surveys made by them. The following synopsis will show briefly the amount of work done by the division:

In addition to this there has been much miscellaneous work, iuclnding verification and revision of proofs, drawings, and charts; tracings and pr~jections made and verified; tidal data reduced and platted; comparisons of hydrography an1l topogrnphy, and other work too numerous to mention. In the one item alone of keeping the charts corrected over 700 corrections have been added, necessitating over 2 000 corrections to our standard charts. The monthly Notice to Mariners bas been revised and the items given at greater length. Its publication has been prompt. Owing to the zeal and elliciency of all the employee~ the work of the division has been in every way satisfactory, and has been kept up to date. 'l'he chief draftsnrnn of this division, Mr. W. C. Willenbncher, is im'aluable; he is prompt, reliable, and eflicient in all he undertakes. The work of l\lr. F. C. Donn and :i\-Ir. J. T. ·w atkins is all that could be desired, and shows thoroughness at all times. I would earnestly recommend that the salary of Mr. Watkins be increased to $1 200, for the reason that much 11ifliculty has been experienced in retaining a good draftsman here in consequence of insufficient salary. The work required of him calls for special knowledge and experience in this particular line, and he has proven liimself very efficient in every particular. On Mr. E. H. Wyvill devolves the important work of correcting the standard charts of the

office, and, in my opinion, no one could be better fitted for the place. The position can only be filled by an intelligent man who has had a training both at sea and on shore. It requires a nautical experience as well as a knowledge of drawing and geodesy, in all of which Mr. "'\.Yyvill is well posted. I would suggest that his title be changed to nautical expert, and that bis salary be increased to $1 800. Very respectfully, HUGH RODMAN, Lieutenant, U. S. N., Chief of Hydrographia Division. Lieut.

REPOH.T OF THE COAST PILOT PARTY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 189G.
UNITED S'l.'ATES COAST AND GEODE1'1C SURVEY,

W a,shington, D. 0., Jmie 30, 1896. Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report of the work of the Coast Pilot party for the fiscal year ending June 30, 189G. Under the general direction of the Superintendent and the supervision of the Hydrographic Inspector, the duties of this party involve the execution of work iu the field and in the office. The party was under the charge of Lieut. Walter McLean, U.S. N., from July 1 to October 21, 1895, and since the latter date I have had charge of the work. At the beginning of the fiscal year the party was engaged in reading proof of United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VII, from Chesapeake Bay Entrance to Key West; in compiling and reading proof of a supplement (containing rules of the road) for Coast Pilot volumes already published, and in preparing and sending interrogatories covering the coast of the United States bordering on the Gulf of Mexico. On September 20, 1895, the last proofs of United States Ooast Pilot, Part VII, were seut to tlte p_rinter, and on Octciber 26, 1895, the first bound copies of ti.tis volume were received for issue. After the last proofs of United States Coast Pilot, Part VII, l1ad been sent to the printer the party was engaged in compiling manuscript for United States Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VIII, wliicb will iuclude the coast of the United States bordering the Gulf of Mexico between Key West aud the Rio Grande. This work was continued until .January 12, 189G, when, under instructions from the Superiutendent, I, accompanied by Mr .·John Ross, reported on board the Co1,1.st and Geodetic Survey steamer Bache, and on the arrival of that vessel at Pensacola, Fla., organized a party on hoard the Coast and Geodetic Survey schooner TmnsU for Coast Pilot work afloat. Under the Superintendent's instructions, accompanied by Mr. Hoss, I returned to the office on l\Iay :n, 189G, and continued the compila.tion of United States Coa.st Pilot, Part VIII. The report covering the work of the Coast Pilot party while in the field was submitted to the Superintendent on May ~9, 1896. In this connection I would state that some of the principal anchorages visited show marked changes in the channels in their entrances, if not in depth at least in direction, since the last surveys. Among these I would mention East Pass (into St. Georges Sound), St. Andrews Bay, Horn Island Anchorage, and Ship Island Anchorage. In my opinion, a resurvey of these entrances would enable the buoys to-be more advantageously located and more correctly plotted on the charts, the usefulness of which would be greatly increased thereby. Besides the preparation of manuscript for new Coast Pilot volumes and reading proof of the same, the party has corrected to date of issue all Coast Pilot volumes issued from this Office. This important and necessary work involves considerable labor, and has been increasing steadily in amount. The reduction of tlie price of Coast Pilot volumes to 50 cents each has more than doubled the issue of volumes from this Office and has correspondingly increased the work of correction. The routine work of the party in keeping records of clia,nges, reported dangers,

110

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

l1ydrographic examinations, new information available, and other data which may be w;;ed in the compilation or correction of Coast Pilot volumes is very considerable aud constant. I would call attention to the necessity for a new (second) edition of United Btates Coast Pilot, .Atlantic Coast, Part VI, Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries. The first edition was published in 1880, and is therefore 7 years old. Since its publication, changes affecting tl1e volume, amounting to several hundred, have occurred. These necessitated corrections, which are now inserte1l in each volume issued. They detract greatly from the appearance and usefaluess of the book, and in many -cases entirely cl1angc the text. Of the first edition, 1 500 copies were printed and ()67 copies issued, leaving 843 copies on hand at the cud of the fiscal year June 30: 1896. I would suggest that, when the manuscript for United States Coast Pilot, Part VIII, has been sent to the printer, manuscript for a' second edition of noo volumes of Part YI be prepared, aid that when the volume is printed the unsold copies of the first edition be canceled. Mr. John Hoss, nautical expert of the party, has been employed, partly in the office and partly in the field, during the entire fiscal y(~ar in the collection of data and the compilation of manuscript for the new edition of Part VIII of the CoaRt Pilot. It gives me great pleasure to testify to the valuable services he bas rendered the work, both in the office and in the field. l\fr. Talbot Pulizzi has been employed during the entire fiscal year in copying manuscript, entering corrections in Coast Pilot volumes, and keeping· posted the files of the party, all to my entire imtisfaction. Very respectfully,
GLENNIE TARBOX,

OFFICE REPORT NO. 4-1896.
REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE OF STAND.ARD WEIGHTS AND MEASUnEs FOR THE FISCAL YEAH ENDING JUNE 30, 1896.
UNITED STATES COAS'.l' AND GEODETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF STAND.A.RD "\VEIGHTS .A.ND MEASURES,

lVasltington, ]), O., June 30, 1896.
Srn: I have the honor to submit the annual report of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896. The usual operations of verification and adjustment of weights, capacity measures, standards of length, etc., for other Departments of the Government, States, institutions of learning, engineers and surveyors, manufacturers and private parties, hiwe been carried on during the ~·ear, and, notwithstanding the limited force of the Office, prompt response lws been made to all calls for information. Messrs. L. A. Fischer and C. A. Harbaugh l1ave, as heretofore, efficiently performed the various duties devolving upon them, and have served continuously througliout the year. Mr. Fischer, in addition to his regular duties, prepared the weights and measures exhibit for the Atlanta Exposition and installed it there, being absent for that purpose from August 2G to September 9. He was again called to Atlanta, in connection with the Treasury Department exhibit, on December 2 and remained until the 10tl1. He also rendered valuable assistance in the important special observations and investigations me11tio11ed farther on, viz, the determination of the value of the Committee Metre in terms of- the international prototype, the construction of the 50-metre comparator, the verification of the lengths and constants of the secondary base bars Nos. 13 and 14, and the standardization and determination of constants of the new duplex base bara. Nos. 15 an cl 16. Mr. Harbaugh's duties have been of a miscellaneous character, including the comparison of alcoholometers, etching of steel tapes, assisting in tape comparisons, indexing records, typewriting, etc. In addition to attending to the clerical work of the Weights ancl :Measures Office, he has also clone all the typewriting for the Superintendent's Annual Report. · The mechanician, l\fr. Otto Storm, has, for the greater part of the year, been detailed to the instrument division, his services not being continuously required in the Weights and Measures Office. 011 the other hand, when emergencies required the performance of considerable work-as the construction of apparatus in a limited time-the instrument division has reciprocated by temporarily putting 011 it as many mechanicians as were necessary. In this way the new cut-off apparatus and the new microscopes for the 50-metre comparator were constructed, and the arrangement has proved mutually beneficial. Laborer R. B. Crutchfield was assigned to the Office on May 15 and served for the remainder of the year. He assisted in the examination of specimens of sea water and performed· miscellaneous duty. Electrical units.-Asshitant G. U. Putnam was assigned to duty under my direction on October 21, and so continued until January, rendering valuable service, especially in the matter of preparing for the makiug aud testing of electrical standards. He constructed, in accordance with the specificationH published by the National Academy of Sciences under date of February 20, 1895, six standard Clark Cells, and subsequently compared them with each other and with the standard Carhart Cell in the possession of this Office, and discussed aud computed tlie observations. As a preliminary to the testing of the Clark Cells the Resistance boxes to be used were carefully investigated and intercompared, and tl1eir resistances determined in terms of the standard No. 75; the

various galvanometers used were also suqjected to a rigid examination. Mr. Putnam also assisted in the observations for the determination of the relation between the Committee Metre and the Prototype :i\Ietre X P.. 21. Some progress bas been made in the acquiring of other electrical standards, but as the annual appropriation for the purchase of material and apparatus, and for iucidental expenses, is only $;)00, the work necessarily proceeds slowly, and some time will elapse before we can hope to have areasonably complete outfit for the determination and verification of electrical units. Committee .llletre.-The International Prototype Metre being now regarded as our fundamental standard of length, the determination of the relation of the old Committee Metre thereto is a matter of great importance, and several series of observations have from time to time been made. The direct comparisons made duri11g the previous year by Mr. L. A. Fischer, while very accordant among themselves, gave a value slightly different from what was expected, and it was deemed advisable to further test the matter by means of a method not depending ou the reflection of threads in the ends of tlie Committee l\Ietre. Accordingly, as stated in the Heport for 18!>3, two auxiliary abutting pieces were made, each with a fine line drawn upon it. These were used during the observatious of this year, being held in contact with the ends of the metre by means of light springs, and the lines observed in direct comparisou with those on Prototype Metre No. 21, thus obviating the possible uncertainties ot' estimating the midway point between a thread or spider line and its reflection. The value of the abutting pieces was at diffl.'rent times carefully determined by bringing their abutting surfaces together and then measuring the distance between their lines by means of a microscope micrometer. Comparisons between the Uommittee Metre a11d Prototype Metre :No. 21 were made by Messrs. Fischer, Putnam, and myself, during January aud February, 1896, the abutting pieces being frequently shifted in position and occasionally interchaugetl. It was found that for any given position the results by the three observers were i>ract.ically identical, but that the interchange of abutting pieces, and sometimes their mere reversal without interchange, procluced a variation, the range of observations being about 4 microns. Unfortunately the cuds of the Committee Metre are not now true planes, and defects and irregularities of surface am plainly visible. The variation of results is doubtless due to this fact, and I am of the opiuion, as stated in my February report, that a further multiplication of observations will be useless and that a closer approximation of the true original value of the Committee Metre can not now be obtained. Taking the mean of all observations by the various methods, however, the resulting error of the Committee .Metre dl)es not appear to exceed one micron. 50-Jlfctre c01npm·ator.-Occasiou haviug arisen for the verification of the lengths and constants of secondary base bars Nos. 13 and 14 on account of their baving been in a railway accident, and also for the standardization of the new duplex bars designed by Assistant William Eimbeck and recently constructed by tbe instrument division, it became necessary to consider tlie best and most expeditions methods of accomplishing the work, and as none of the apparatus and facilities available were entirely satisfactory, it was decided to recommerid the construction of a permanent 50-metre comparator. 'l'bis, by enabling us to make witb any set of bars repeated measures of a known distance determined by means of a standard i11 melting ice and consequently at a constant temperature, it was believed would afford the most accurate results, and with a not unreasonable expenditure of time and labor. The recommendation having been approved by you, the necessary plans and drawings were at once prepared by Mr. L.A. Fischer, and the construction was begun in November, and by 1he cooperation of the iustrnment division completed in Jauuary. As tlie comparator was essentially of the same design as the temporary 100-metre one n1-1ed in connection with the measurement of the Holton Base in 1892, and which lms been fully described by Assistaut R. S. ·woodward in Appendix No. 8 of Report for 1892, it is unnecessary to enter here into details. The following particulars, however, should be stated: The terminal piers, 50 metres apart, are of brick, solidly built, and resting on 4 by 4 feet concrete foundations extending to a depth of 5 feet below the surface of the ground. Each concrete foundation'. weiglis approximately 5 tons. The micrometer microscopes mounted on these piers were specially made for the purpose, and have each a magui(ying power of about 50 diameters; one turn of the microm-

" eter = 75 microns, and consequently each division= 0·75.

The intermediate microscnnes have

138

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

a somewhat smaller power, and were so constructed as to have a value of 1 micron per division of micrometer; they are supported on cedar posts, firmly set in tbe grouncl to a depth of 3 to 3~ feet, at intervals of 5 metres, and carefully aligned. In the concrete bases of the terminal piers are set bronze bolts, having spherical heads, which tit into the conical aperture of the cut-off apparatus (also described in Assistant V.Toodward's report above referred to), and the centres of these spheres define the termini of the 50-metre base. 'rhe pier microscopes, by means of the cut-off apparatus, can be accurately referred at auy time to the ground marks, observatious in the direct and reversed position of the cut-off scale being always takeu and the attached level readings recorded. As first constructed the wooden base, carrying the tracks for the movement of the carriages of the iced bar apparatus, was continuous from end to end, the rails of the tracks only being so separated as to provide room for expansion, but after using it a short time it was founcl necessary to divide the wooden frame into sections to eliminate the cumulative effects of its expansion or contraction, as dnring measures with the secondary bars their tre,..tles rested on this base. 'rhe standard 5-metre bar, designated as B 1 ,, the trongh for supporting it immersed in melting ice, and the accompanying carriages for trundling it along the track of the comparator, are the same ones used at Holton, and the gene.ral method of use is ali;o the same as described by Assistant Woodward. In 2\Iarch, after complet.iug a number of measures with the secondary bars, the annoying disco,·ery was made that the pit·r foundations were not as stable as had been expected, and that the distance between the terminal marks of the base line did not remain constant. The changes in 1listancc were quite perceptible in amount, and for a time were continuous in one direction, but subsequently the direction was reversed, and t11e line gradually more tlian regained its original· length. These changes considerably increased the amount of work required to derive accurate lengths for the bars under cxa111i11ation, as it became necessary that each set of measures should be immediately preceded and followed by a new iced bar determination of the length of the base· Tlie varying lengths of the base line are well shown by the following tabulation of the 38 iced bar measures, the amount by which the base exceeded or fell short of 50 metres beiug given in microns with the appropriate i;ign. In these results all corrections for iced bar length, micrometer readings, cut-off inclination, grade, alignment, etc., have been applied.

Tlle measures of February 2·1, being the first made, were regarded as experimental, and consequently the difference between them and tlwse of March !) did not attract special attention, e>;pecially as tl1e latter were confirmed by the observations of the following day. On March 10

OF1''ICE OF STANDARD WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

six independent measures were made, and it will be seen that their extreme range is only 82 microns, and that in all the subsequent observations the daily range was even smaller, in some cases not exceeding 10 microns. 'rhe marked shortening of·the base by nearly 1 200 microns, as shown by the observations of March 31 1 therefore stands out prominently, as does also the progressive lengthening from that date to May 7, when tlie mitximum length was reached. 'Ve have, from the daily means for the extreme range of leugtbs observed, the diflerence between -1 248µ and +6£l9J.1, or 1 947µ, equal to nearly 2 millimetres. We have conclusive prooftliat tbe shortening occurred after ;llarch 20 and before March 31, and that it must therefore have been a comparatively sudden one, but we do not know that the results of March 31 represent the actual minimum length, as the systematic lengtbening may have been already in progress at that date. Observations by means of levels suitably mounted on the piers and their bases, and occasional cut-off readings, show that the movements still continue, but apparently to a less extent than formerly. It is hoped that after the lapse of a year from the date of construction a more permanent and stable condition will be reacbed. B<tse bar comparisons.-The redetermination of the lengths and constants of secondary base bars Nos.13 and 14, and the standardization of the uew Duplex bars Nos.15 and 16 have already been referred to under the head of the 50-metre comparator. The comparisons of the former were duly completed in April,.and gave results practically identical with those previously obtained, showing that tbe bars had not been injured by the jarring received in the railway accident. The resulting combined length of bars No. 13 aud 14, at a temperature of 0°·0 C., was 10·000003 metres + 3·lp. Subsequently special night and day observations were made to deter. mine the "lag" of thermometers, the result being that umler the conditions then existing the ''lag" was + 0°·19, the sign depending upon whether the temperature was rising or falling. This differs slightly from the mean value derived at Holton, viz, + 00·25, but it must be borne in mind that special conditions necessarily affeet the result, as the "lag" depends not only on the actual amount of changes of temperature bnt also on their rapidity. The new duplex base bars Nos. 1.'i and 16 each consist of two components, the prominent feature of the apparatus being its yielding two simultaneous measures of a base by two difterent metals having widely different coefficients of expansion, so that the temperature8 during a measure can be deduced more accurately than by indications of thermometers. In the standardization ollse1·vations, however, thermometers were used, three for each bar, but the record furnishes the means of computing results independently of tbem. The behavior of the whole apparatus during the various measures and tests was excellent, and I am more than ever convinced that with proper handling it will yield results far superior to any other base apparatus yet devised. The difficulty of obtaining the true temperature of the bars during a measure in the field has heretofore been the greatest source of uncertainty in primary bases, and I believe that the introduction of the duplex principle will mark an era in accurate base measurement. To be sure the measurement of a base throughout by means of a sta11dard bar in ice would be the ideal method; but the difficulties in the way of its practical use in the field and the g-reat expense involved in preparing the line would necessarily forbid its adoption. The comparisons of the duplex bn.rs were made at various dates from March 20 to May 8 so as to include a good range of temperatures, and generally four complete measures with each component were made on each day of observation. The temperatures ranged from 0°·0 to :W 0·0 C., and 32 determinations of the value of l 0 bar lengths (for each component) were obtained. The extreme rauge of these determinations for single measures was 0·37 millimeter and for the means of daily results 0·26 millimeter. The results for any 011e day never differed by more than 0·16 millimeter, and the mean of daily variations was only 0·08 millimeter. 'fhe coefficients of expansion of the steel and brass compouents, and the differential coefficient, from a mean of rn results in each case, were found to be as follows: For steel components 0·00001153 ± 4 For brass components 0·0000185(; ± 3 Differential coefficient 0·00000703 ± 1

140

The combined lengths of bars Nos. 15 and 16, as deduced from the observations, adopting the above coP.fficients, are as follows: At 25°·117 c. steel No. 15 +No. Hi = 10-000000 :!: 2·2 At 250.142 C. brass No. 15 +No. Hi = 10·000000 :!: l·!) At 25°·183 0. steel and brass are of equal length= 10·000007 :!: 2·0 In constructing these bars the intention was to have them as nearly as possible of standard length at 25°·0 C., that being about the mean tenwerature expected in the field observations, and the above figures show how closely the chief mechanician of the instrument division approximated the desired result. All micrometer readings, cut-oft' observations, and contacts during the progress of the work were made by Mr. L. A. Fischer aud myself, and the sector readings, scale readings, setting up and adjustment of intermediate microscopes, etc., by various Assistants detailed from time to time to assist in the work. Assistant Isaac Winston served throughout as recorder, and also took part in the sector adjustments, and the following members of the normal force aided for shorter or longer periods as they could be spared from other duties: D. B. Wainwright, W. C. Hodgkins, W. I. Vina.I, A. L. Baldwin, 0. B. French, R. L. Faris, and C. C. Yates. All performed theil' various parts acceptably, and my thanks are due to them for their hearty cooperation and the zeal di:splayed in the successful prosecution of the work. · Superinteudent's Annual Report, etc.-In addition to the control aud supervision of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, I have also attended to the preparation, compilation, and editing of the Superintendent's Annual Report, and have, at various times during the year, acted as Assistant in Charge of the Office and as executive ofiicer, viz: As Assistant in Charge of Office from July 22 to July 31. As executive officer from August 26 to August 31. As executive officer from September 9 to NoYernber !J. As A:ssistaut in Charge of Office from November JS to November 22. As executive officer from February 10 to February 15. As Assistant in Charge of Office from March 21 to l\iarch 28. As executive officer from May 18 to May 25. As Assistant in Clmrge of Office from May 25 to May 29. I have also served as a member of tlle publication board and tlle special committee appointed to considl~r tlle methods to be employed in future precise leveling. In couelusion I beg to refer again to the services of Adjuster L. A. Fischer, which are inva.luable, and to renew the recommendation that provision be made in the annual estimates for a substautial increase of his compensation. For Mr. C . .A. Harbaugh I also .earnestly recommend an increase of pay and a change of rating. Accompanying this report is an abstract of verifications, determinations, and standardizations made during the year for other departments and for outside parties. Yours, respectfully,

APPENDIX No.1-1896.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE MAGNETIO DEOLINATION IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE EPOCH JANUARY 1, 1900.
[Third edition, with three charts.]

By CHAR_LES A. SCHOTT, .Aslliatmit. Submitted for publication October 17, 1896.

Jntroduction.-Since the last pulilication by the Survey of a paper showing for a given date the distribution of the magnetic declination within the area of the' United States nearly eight years have elapsed, an interval sufficiently long to have produced marked changes in the values of the declinatioi'i. as well as in the delineation of the isogonic curves from their aspect in the year 1890. A new edition, based upon a new discussion of the material on hand, and a chart exhibiting the results for an epoch nearer to the present time were thus called for. It is well known that th.e changes of the delin~ation, and consequently also its geographic distribution, are caused by the operation of the secular variation, the laws of which, while fairly made out for stations located on the coasts, are yet but imperfectly understood for the interior of t.he country; and this is particularly true for the more recently settled parts. Hence a first and indispensable step toward improved results was a new discussion of the secular variation. This was accordingly made, and is contained in the Annual Report of the Survey of last year. (Vide Appendix No. 1, 1895, pp.167-320.) The study of this subject, as yet obscure in its origin, has been steadily pursued by the Survey, and the increased demand for its results may be judged of by the fact that seven .editions have been exhausted. The improvements introduced in the present paper on the distribution of the declination, for which the epoch Januitry, 1900, has been selected, consist of(1) The introduction of additional observations made since the publi<?ation of 1889 and the additions to the collection of data other than those directly contributed by the Survey. (2) The extension and increase of our knowledge of the secular ·variation, thus giving increased precision to the "reduction to epoch;" that is, to the sign and amount of correction to be applied to the observed value to produce what it would be should the observation be made in January, 1900. In spite of the very limited means at the disposal of the Survey, 1 the progress in our knowledge of the distribution of magnetism within our borders though slow has been steady, as may be seen from the historical aceouut given in the introduction to the second edition of the paper; yet west of the Mississippi River, and particularly in the Northwestern States, there are vast regions
l!'or the fl.seal year 1895-96 the amount appropriated for magnetio research was but one-fiftieth pa.rt of that given for the general field work of the Survey, and in consequenoe the maintenance of the magnetic ollserve.tory near San Antonio, Tex., where self-registering instruments had been at work during five years, had to be given up in March, 1895.

which for the present have to be covered by interpolated values. Moreover, the recognition of disturbed regions and the exposition of the disturbances by means of lines of equal anomaly have so far received little consideration, but in the future will demand a large share of attention as a desirable, interesting, and fruitful study, for which it is hoped the necessary means will be forthcoming. In judging thus of the amount and character of the work in terrestrial magnetism accomplished so far by the Survey, the fact of its very limited resources should be borne in mind. Looking to future expausion of activity and in part explanatory of the method pursued in bringing out the results of thil'I paper, a few words bearing on the manner of conducting magnetic surveys may find a proper place here. l~eferring to surveys on land and of limited area, such ·as that of one of our States of average size, one or two field parties observing at each station declination, dip, and intensity, and operating, say, for one, two, or maybe more years, according to facilities for travel and depending on the density of distribution of stations, may secure a fair knowledge of the magnetic force within the border lines. Should a magnetic observatory, centrally located and provided with automatically registering instruments, be available during the t.inie of the survey, all field retmlts could be differentially corrected for diurnal variation and for <l isturbances, as well as for annual change, simply by comparisons of simultaueous values found by t.J1e traveliug pa.rty and as recorded at the base station. The assumption that the character of disturbances changes but slowly with distance can safely be made. The analysis of local disturbances may be followed out to auy desired extent. Such surveys may be repeated at certain intervals, say one-fourth of a century. 1 ·For an area forming a considerable part of the earth's surface, such as that presented by the Uuited States, the above method becomes impracticable by reason of its great expense iu providing for a multitude of iustruwents and observers; hence a different method has to be followed, and is the oue adopted by the Survey. It consiscs in gaining as accurate a knowl6dge of the laws of the secular variation as possible by selecting a series of well-distributed so-called secular-variation stations, particularly those for which we possess a number of old observations, and supplementing these by modern observations repeated every few years (say five or ten or more years, according to circumstances). If, then, the Survey directs its observer8 to places where their work will tell to beat advantage, as, for im1tance, in the central part of a region destitute of magnetic stations, and at the same time collects all other results within its boundaries, 110 matter when or by whom observed, we can refer all to any epoch we choose 2 and discuss aud chart them as in the first method. This paper, being restricted to the consideration of declinations, contains a collection of observed and reduced (to epoch 1900·0) values at over 3 500 places, while the number of secularvariation stations (in Appendix No. 1, Report for 1895) was 118, with an aggregate of more than 1 430 observations (annual values). Magnetic surveys conducted at sea of necessity gather their material from cruises, and these researches are generally isolated rather than partaking of a systematic and complete character. Intensities, when expressed in absolute mea:<ure, must depend on observations at base stations on land, and the disturbing influences on magnetic obsen·ations made on board ship must be investigated under the various conditions of a cruiRe and the results be corrected accordingly. The secular variation is ascertained from a discussion of results obtained on islands and at coast stations. Isomagnetic curves thtown over the oceanic expanse of the survey will be greatly strengthened in their proper location by joining ·and merging iuto the trend of any corresponding system of curves covering adjacent coasts. lsomagnetic lines may be constructed gra.phically or by application of analysis. The latter mathematical process of interpolation, for instance, was applied in case of the
-----·----------1 As examples of this method of conducting surveys, we may refer to the following publications: "A mngnetic surrny of.the British Isles for the epoch January 1, 1886," by A. W. Rtlcker and 'f. E. Thorpe, Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc." vol. 181, London 1890; "Determination des 616ments magnetiqnes en France," par M. Th. Moureaux, Paris, 1886; nnll "A magnetic survey of the Netherlands for the epoch January 1, 1891," by Dr. Van Rijckevorsel, Kieuwe Verbanllelingen van bot Bataafsch Genootscbap der Proefondervindelijke Wijsbegeerte te Rotterdam, 1895. The magnetic survey of the State of Missouri, made between 1878 and 1882 by Prof. F. E. Nipher, approximates to this system, but for thorough analysis of local disturbances a greater number of stations for dip and intensity would be desirable. 2 Provided it be within the limits of our knowledge of the secular variation.

isogo11ics for Bering Sea and the northeast Pacific adjacent to AJaska. (See Appendix No. 4, Heport for 1894.) The chart accompanying that paper is for the epoch 1895. The scanty and imperfect information of the annual change ranging over so large an extent as Alaska, with its adjacent waters, hardly warrants an extension in time to a later date, but thii; has been done without much additional labor by shifting the lines by the accumulated amount proportional to the intervals between them, thus keeping in use the general expression for this region as estabJished iu 1894, viz: D=-270·7288-0·71688 <p1 +0·73731 A1 cos <p -0·023982 <p12 + 0·070893 <p1A1 cos <p+0·010915 A 11 cos2 <p 2 3 -0·0005744 rp1 +0·0025613 <p1 A1 cos <p+0·0001956 <p1A12 cos2 <p-0·0003342 :\ 13 cos3 <p where D=the declination for 1895·0 aud <p1 =<p-59°·02 and A 1 =A-145°·12, as given in Appendix 4, Report for 1894, Part II, page 98. To obtain the declination at any place in Alaska for any date between now and 1900, a correction for the annual changll must be applied, for which the following approximate or conjectured values are all thRt is now avaiJable.

'.l'ABLE OF THE l\IOS'.l' RECENT :MAGNETIC DECLINATIONS OBSERVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND .A.DJ.A.CENT REGIONS.

The arrangement of the tabulation of the declinations collected 1 to date, bu.t giving only the latest observation at each place, is the i:;ame as that of the preceding edition of 1889, viz, for each State, Territory, and geographical subdivision two groups are formed, the first composed wholly of stations occupied by Coast and Geodetic Survey observers, the second of stations occupied by other obsen'ers. There nre a few exceptio11s to this for special reasons. The stations are arranged according to tbefr latitudes, beginuing with the lowest itnd ending with the highest, which renders it quite easy to find iu what localities magnetic observations have b~n made. In this edition all special references to the source whence the obserrn,tions were deriYed are omitted in order to relieve the paper from unnecessarybeaviness; this remark, however, does not apply to newly added data. Footnotes relating to index corrections of compasses or to improvements of geographical positions are likewise omitted, all of which special information can be fou11d in the preceding edition. Some concentration bas also been effected, omitting the results at stations closely crowded tog·ether, say within a square mile, or demanding condensation for other reasons, and substituting for them a mean value. The contents of the first, second, and third columns of the general table are sufficiently indicated by the respective headings; the next two columns give the date (the year and fraction) of observation und the observed declination (in degrees and fraction), a + sign indicating west, a sign east. declination. The column headed u D contains the reduction of the observed value to the adopted epoch 1900·0, which is derh"e<L directly from the discussion of the secular'variation a~ suitabJy selected stations as given in last year'i:; Annual Hl:\port; a + indicates increasing west (or decreasing east) declination, a - sign the reverse motion of the north end of the magnetic needle. To facilit'lte the evaluation (in time and space) of 6 D, a special set of secular change tables was prepared. These give for every secular variation station and for every even year between 1830 and 1900, the reduction directly, together with its proper sign. If for any reason the change is

unknown or doubtful, the fact is indicated by a blank in this and the next column. The resulting values 1 ready for the next operation of charting are presented in the column headed D J!l-OQ and the table closes with stating the observer's name and an occasional reference when required. The great inequality· in the density of the distribution of stations in the several State8 or subdivisions may be judged by the following table of number of stations in each, as given in this paper:

·--------------------------THE ISOGONIC CHART OF THE FNITED ST A'l'ES FOR THE EPOCH JANUARY, 1900.-CONSTRUOTION OF '.l'HE LINES OF EQUAL DECLINATION.

Having thus obtained our material, ready to hand for charti11g, an account of this process niust next be given. First, we have to remark that a graphical method for drawing the isogonic curves was preferred to an analytical one, since their general curvature was sufficiently well known and 110 very large spaces barren of magnetic stations were encountered. Such, however, was not the case with Alaska and adjacent parts of the ocean, where the use of a mathematical expression, with its cumbersome adjunct, the metlwd of least squares, had to be resorted to in order to secure definiteness of location. These curves are here reproduced, with the effect of the secular change during five years applied to refer them to the year 1900 (see chart No. 3). The curves are necessarily smooth, as, depending on' the roots of au equation which is a steady function of the latitude and longitude, they do not take cognizance of local disturbauces, which, however, are supposed to be less frequent over sea than on land areas. When speaking here of mag11etic disturbances we do not mean temporary ones, occurring during observations, but refer to regious perrua11ently disturbed, i. e., showing an irregular an<l anomalous distribution as compared with an equable distribution over surrounding regions. These disturbed areas often present diffieulty in attempting to recognize and reprei;ent them, on account of their variation in extent and the amount of deviatio11. If the latter is small it may mix itself up with observing error; on tile other hand, if the extent be restricted, say to a few square kilometres or to a few square miles, they may entirely escape recognition from want of observation within the area. These irregularities may be spread over areas hundreds of times as great, in which case they can be properly represented even on a chart of small scale. Disturbances in distribution are i-hown by the distor1 They are given to the nearest tenth of n. degree (i.e., within± 3'), an accuracy commensnruto with or exceeding that which the data themselves ruay posHess.

tions of the isomagnetic curves traversing the disturbed region; ,if of small extent they are known as "local" disturbances; if of wide range they have been termed "regional," but no sharp distinction between them is possible. The older observations and all those made by means of the compass a.re subject to large probable errors, which may be roughly estimated as between ::1::5' and ::1::15' or more (those made at sea as ::1::30' or more), whereas the results obtained by means of the magnetometer, which instrument is almost exclusively employed by the Survey, may be depended ·upon generally within ::!:: 1' to ::!:: 3'. Errors introduced through the reduction to epoch will, creteris ,paribus, be proportional to the elapsed time. Thus, in following the observed values too closely, there is danger that our iRomagnetic curves represent by their sinuosities observing errors rather than abnormal distribution of magnetism. On this account the tabular values were divided into 'two groups of results of greater and of less reliability, and when plotted this division was recog'nized as a help toward the most probable position aud form of the curves. In many cases the geological formation of the region, particularly if consisting of igneous rock, will of itself point out probable limits of the disturbed region. It ueed hardly be remarked that the employment of a graphical process of interpolation does not exclude the use of analytical treatment; on the contrary, the two methods may be applied together with advantage, as supplementary to one another, but just how far to follow minute deflections and how much to generalize must, in a large measure, remain a matter of judgment and. experience. In places on the chart where, from want of adequate information, the position of the isogonic .curves are doubtful or indeterminate the fact is indicated by broken lines. The use of the accompanying chart No.1 is quite simple. The declination for any place wit.bin its borders is either had by inspection or by simple interi:>olation between the two adjacent curves; the valu.e fouud is for 1900·0; for any other year. (and fraction) a reduction for secular change between' the epoch and given date must be applied. The contents of Appendix No. 1, Report for 1895, supply this reduction for the past time as well as up to the year 1900 and roughly for a few years beyond. For convenience, however, a map (No. 2) is appended to this paper, which shows the annual change of the declination during the period 1890-1900, expressed in minutes of .arc, + for increasing west or decreasing east declination and - for the reverse motion. The amount varies in time, but not sufficiently during the brief interval of teu years to cause any serious inaccuracy; its variation with geographical position must be estimated from the map. It gives me pleasure to acknowledge the effective services of Mr. D. L. Hazard for applying the tabular reduction to epoch, and of Mr. F. W. Clay for plotting the position of the stations on the chart. The plotting and the running in of the curves were doue on a chart of scale 1/5 000 000 :and the latter were then transferred to the more convenient chart of scale 1/7 000 000.

H.ESULTING. HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT LEVELING BETWEEN OLD POINT COMFORT AND RICHMO~D, VA., FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE BY J. B. WEIR, SUBASSISTANT, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND NOVEMBER, 1884; AND BY I. WINSTON, ASSISTANT, BETWEEN DEOEMBEH, 1891, AND FEBRUARY, 18~2.·

Submitted by the chief of the computing division for publication April 29, 1896.

I have the honor to submit herewith the result& of the line of spirit levels between Old Point Comfort and H.ichmond 1 Va., as revised by Mr. 0. B. French iu February last. The line was leveled in 1884 by Subassistant J.B. Weir, and releveled in 1891-92 by Assistant I. Winston. Field and office reductions were made in due time. The releveling became necessary in consequence of too great a discrepancy in the levels hetween Hagerstown, Md., as determined from Sandy Hook, N. J., and from Old Point Comfort, Va. At Old Point Comfort Light-House, the starting point of the levels, no lesss than three primary bench marks (and at least one subsidiary one) were established. The one to which the tidal observations were referred is known as the" Old Tidal bench mark." It was established by Lieut. W.R. Palmer in August, 1852, and is an irregularly shaped cut, about one-fourth of an inch deep, in the southwest face of the light-house, and about 12- feet from the ground. The spirit levels are referred to the primary mark "U,'' a copper bolt leaded in a stone of the southwest side of the light-house. Its center defines the starting level. It was established in 1884 by Subassistant Weir. The other marks nfled not concern us here. According to Weir, bench mark "U" is 0·2478 00 or 0·813 foot below the Old Tidal bench mark. The two marks were found undisturbed by Assistant Winston in December, 1891. Oonnection of the line of levels with the average or half-tide level of the bay (and which is taken as identical with that of the ocean outside); The average sea level was ascertained from observation/'! of high and low waters between the years 1853 and 1878. The following results for one.half (H + L) were obtained by the tidal division of the Offtce.t For the period 1853-1869 the reduction B. Boutelle is by J, Down~s; for the period 1870-1878 certain corrections were applied by for changes in the relation of the pencil of the tide gauges with reference to the mark on the light-house.

As a rough verification of the relation of this average level with the Old Tidal mark in 1888 ( seyt. ), we have reading of average leve 9·43 ft., and again in 1891 (Aug.) the reading 9·50 ft. In December, 1891, the marks on the light-house were found undisturbed.

Mean. 9·63 ± 0·04 or 2·9353 ,,, ± 0·012 m. Hence bench mark "U" above the half tide level, 2·6875 m ± 0·012 m.

The primary reference bench marks established at Richmond, Va., in 1884, are the following: "0" on the granite cloorsill of the freight depot of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. '· P" on the granite doorsill of the east front of Richmond College. A tLird mark was established in 1891 by Mr. Winston at the new city hall to the left of the steps at the west~rn entrance. It was made at the request of the city engineer and for special preservation. The mark "P" is 4·5516 m. above and the city hall mark 8·1541 m. below the mark "0." The line of levels follows the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad, and a.JI the bench marks on the line determined in 1884 that could be found were included in the verification work of 1891- 92, thus furnishing the means for the computation of the probable error for the heights of the terminal marks at Richmond. The condition of the line was not favorable, since a great part of the roadbed was made ground, with underlying swamp. The Weir line from September to November, 1884, was run with spirit level No. 1 as a simultaneous double line.· This, as experience has shown, can count only for a single line, since the physical and instrumental conditions for the two lines were essentially the same. The collar inequality for level No.1 was object end smaller 211 ·30; the angular value for the telemeter threads was 34' 04"·7. The lengths of the metric brass scales of the rods E and Fat given temperatures, as well as their index errors, are given in Appendix No. 7, Ooast and Geodetic Survey, Report for
1887 (p. 186).

The Winston line of December, 1891, to February, 1892, was run with spirit levels Nos. 5 and 6, as a single line in parts where the re1mlt agreed with that of the older measure, but with a repetition of th~ measure, using the other instrument in cases of discord with Weir's result. The
*For explanation of method and description of instrument Appendix No. 10, Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1888, and No. 9, Report for 1887, may be consulted. The former give11 an account of levels run in 1884, the latter in 1885-86, by the same obsen·er and with the same instrument.

instrumental constants for Nos. 5 and 6 are given in Appendix No. 3, Report for 1892, also in Appendix No. 4 for the same year. No. 6 was supplied with a new level of 1 div'n =2"·33 at 410.3 c. and 2"·58 at60·9 c.

APPENDIX No. 8.-1896.

RESULTING HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT LEVELING BETWEEN HICHM:OND, VA., AND WASHINGTON, D. C., FROM OBSERVATIOXS MADE BY J. B. WEIR, SUBASSISTANT, IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, 1883, AND SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, 1884, WITH RELEVELING BY J.B. WEIR BETWEEN RICHMOND AND FRED.ERICKSBURG, VA., I~ MAY AND JUNE, 1886, AND VERIFIOATION LEVELING BETWEEN THE TWO CITIES BY I. WINSTON, ASSISTANT, BETWEEN APRIL ANfi JUNE, 1895.·

Submitted for publication by Charles A. Schott, Assistant, in charge of Computing Division, September 17, 1896.

The following report on the resultiug heights from spirit leveling between mchmoud, Va., and Washington, D. C., is herewith respectfully submitted. The heights are taken up from the bench mark at tbe freight depot of the Riclrn1ond, Fredericksburg· and Potomac Railroad, and known as bench mark "0," which is the starting p9int of the line. The height of tbis mark above tbe average lev~l of the ocean became known by spirit leveling from Old Point Comfort to Richmond and from tidal observations carried on for many ~·ears on Chesapeake Bay near Fort Monroe. Its height is 5:"1957 m., or rno·930 feet .. (See precediug appendix in this volume.) The line was first run in 1883-84 by Sn bassist ant J. B. W efr, and re1)eated by him in 1886 over about onebalf of the distance, i. e., from Richmond to Fredericksburg. As will be seen from the result when compared with the average level of the Potomac at Washiugton, D. 0., the operation did not prove as satisfactory as was e:q)ected, and Assistant I. Winston was directed in 1895 to rernn the whole line with the view of securing a result which should be physically true and be within acceptable limits of accuracy. The results are thus presented iu three abstracts; the computations were made in duplicate, one by the observers, the other mainly by the office computers, A. S. Christie and J. Nelson. The abstra.l!tS themsekes are due to Mr. Winston.

The metric graduations of the brass scales on rods E and P are correct at the temperatm·es
160·7 0. and 130.g C., respectively, and their index corrections or projections beyond the zero line are 6·33 cm. (May 6 and November 17, 1884) and 6·06 cm. pray 6 and November 17, 1884), respectively. P and Qare wooden rods, made at the office in 1894-95; they are saturated with paraffin;

the metric graduations are marked by brass pins. These rods require no temperature correction, their length being almost invariable; for a full description of them see Appendix No. 8, Report for 1895. AH rods are provided with movable targets. :Micrometer spirit level ~o.1 is described in-Appendix No. 11, Report for 1880 (illustrated on plates Nos. 4G and 47), micrometer spirit level No. 3 is described in Appendix No. 15, Report for 1879 (illustrated on plate No. 52); micrometer spirit level No. 5 was constructed at the Survey Office in 1888 and differs only in some unessential details from No. 1. Tlte metlwcl of observin,q.-It was as follows: In 1883-84 two parallel lines were run simultaneously and in the same direction, but with alternate sections (from 10 to 15 miles) run in opposite directions. On one of the lines rod E was used, on the other rod F, the rods being placed at different distances from the instrument; the long sights were observed first during one day and the short sights during the next day. In the verification work of 1886 only a single line was run, but with its alternate sections (7 to 15 miles lqng) in opposite directions. In 1895 a simultaneous double line was run in one direction. 'fhe length of the sight line (instrument to rod) varies, ordinarily, between 75 and 125 m. for Weir observer, and extends to a somewhat greater diRtance for Winston observer.

Now the following_ considerations show that the results of 1883-84 can not possibly be correet and that they are affected by a cumulative error. In the first place ·we would remark that the width of the entrance of Chesapeake Bay of nearly 11 statute miles makes it safe to assume its half tide or average level to be identical with that of the adjacent oceau, and the same may be said of the bay up to its head; further, it is apparent that the ascending slope of the Potomac can not be great and may even be difficult to measure directly; the mouth of the river is 6~ miles in width aud the aspect of its course resembles more tliat of a branch of the bay tlian that of a steady flowiug river. Forcomparisou, we may cite the slope of the .:\lississippi River duriug 333 statute miles of its lower course (mouth of the Red River to ~he gulf), and during a time when at its lowest stage, the difference in height of the river level and gulf was found to be 5·2 feet, which gives an ascending slope of_0·2 inch per mile very nearly; if we take for the Potomac slope oue-half of this, the differeuce in height at the bay and at Washington, a distance of 100 miles uearl~', would amount to but 10 inches or 0·254 m. Now by direct tidal observations, extendiug over five years (August, 1891, to August, 1896), at the navy-yard at Washington, and by spirit leveling theuce to the Capitol bench mark, the height of this mark above the half-tide level of the Potomac at the yard becomes· 27·612 ::!:: 0·015 m., and this is the minimum height above the sea level it could have, but adding to this for assumed slope of the river 0·254 m., or if this is deemed too much, say O·HiO 1n., we get for the height of the Capitol B. M. 27·7i2 m. This result is corroborated by the line of levels from Annapolis, Md., of 1875, F. W. Perkins, observer, and extended in 1880 and 1884 by J. B. Weir, t which gives for the minimum height above the sea level 27·618 111. ::!:: 0·035 111. Taking a .mean value, as most probable, we may adopt. 27·70 m. ::!::0·07 m. where the probable error is estimated. Compariug this with the value found in 1883-84 (viz, 27·043 m.) we find that the line of 1883-84 requires a correction here of+ 0·66 m. A similar comparison between the mean tidal level and the re:;ults of spirit levels at Fredericksburg· leads to the following result: Reading of half-tic.le level on staff of UnitecJ States eugineers, 1 ·5 feet, and bench mark H above staff reading 4·.J feet, 12·281 m.; hence minimum height of H above sea level 12·281 m. + 0·914m.=13·195 m. Comparing this with the value found in 1883-84 (viz, 12·803 rn.), the correction to the line here amounts to + 0·392 m. Now, Fredericksburg ii; approximately midway between H.ichmond and Washington, and we may expect the correction to be about one-half of what was deduced for Washington. This is found to be so, rouglily speaking, and proves the correctness of the statement that the levels of 1883-84 betweeu I~ichinond and Washiugton developed a cumulative error aud ueed proportional corrections. Looking at the James and Rappahannock rin~rs when at a low stage,
- - - ---------------·--*According to a communication from Mr. L. P. Shi<ly, acting chief of tlrn ti1lnl divialou of the office, dated September 12, 1896, we have the following particulars: Tidal ol>servatiow1 from August 1, 1891, to August 31, 1896; mean of 3 458 high waters on tide staff, 5·891 feet; mean of 3 462 low water8 2·987 feet; half-tide level on Htaff, 4·439::!:: 0·037 feet.. Ordnance B. M. in the navy-yard abo,·e zoro of tide staff, 20·747 feet, aucl by s11irit leveling Cnpitol B. M. (Senate wing) above Ordnance B. 1L 74·281 feet; hence Capitol B. M. (Senate wing) ahovo the half-ti<lo ltffel of the Potomac at the navy-yard 90·589 feet, or 27·612 m. The refor1mce to the B. M. at the navy-yar<l iutroduc11d, as stated l>_,. Mr. Shi<ly, an ndditionnl uncertainty of 0·032 feet; henoe tot.al probable error ±0·049 feet, or ±0·015 m. t C. & G. Survey Report for 1889, Appendix No. 15, p. 463. The results of thi11 line, therefore, nl"o require a small increase, proportional to distance from AnnapoUs, the correction at Washington being +0·08 m.

their windings and narrow beds in their upper courses must have the effect of raising the mean or half-tide level at Hichmond aud at Fredericksburg somewhat above that of the ocean. Iudeed, at Richmond we possess tile following infor1natio11: Adopted height of bench mark "0," 58·196 m; United States engiueers' city bench mark below "0," 50·433 m; llalf-tide water, James H.iver, below city bench mark, 'i ·670 m.; hence, half.tide level at Richmond below B. M. "O," 58·103 m., or river level apparently above ocean level, 0·093 m., which may be an admissible quantity. We may add here the observed values of mean rise aud fall of the tides at the several localities referred to in this report. They are:

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

In consequence of the earth's rotation, two adjacent equipotential surfaces wiuen out as we proceed southward, since gravity diminishes and the law h1 g 1= h 2 g 2 must be satisfied. Suppose the leveling profile projected on a meridian plane passing between two cities, and let the avernge ordinate be h =30 metres; also take the latitude of Washington,= 38° 52', and that of Richmond, 370 32', hence L1<p=1° 20', and the effect due t-0 the divergence will be L1 h =-0·0054 h. L1cpsin.2 cp=-0·0035 m, or about 3~ mm. This is so small a quantity, particularly when compared with the corrections that had to be applied to our results, that we may dispense with any further consideration of it. The same may be sai<l of the difference in the course of the level surface which depends on the inequality of the ascendi11g and descending slopes, since the elevations along the profile are too insignificant to produce any sensible effect.

RESULTING HEIGHTS FROM SPIHIT LEVELING BETWEEN WASHINGTON, D. C., AND HAGERSTOWN, l\:ID., FROM OBSERVATIONS MADE BY J.B. WEIR, SUBASSISTANT, BETWEEN JULY AND SEPTEMBER, 1883.·

Submitted for publication by Charles A. Schott, Assistant in charge Computing Division, September 18, 1896.

The following report on the resulting heights from spirit leveling between Washington, D. C., and Hagerst-0wn, Md., is herewith respectfully submitted. The line connects with tide watei.· at Old Point Comfort, at Washington, and at Annapolis (see preceding Appendices Nos. 2 aud 3), whence was obtained the height of the West \Vashington (Georgetown) bench mark at the Aqueduct Bridge, the starting point of the present line. At Hagerstown a junction is made with the line of levels brought over from Sandy Hook, N. J., via Easton and Harrisburg, Pa., of which an account is given iu Appendix No. 11, Report for 1882. t The length of this loop is, between Sandy Hook and Hagerstown court-house, 441·37 km., thence to Washington, Capitol, 129·92; total, 571·3 km. A necessary check on the height of the Hagerstown bench mark is thus secured; from this place, however, to St. Louis, Mo., no check lines have ·as yet been provided. 'l'he computation was made in duplicate, one by the observer and the other by A. S. Christie, office computer; the final abstract is due to Assistant I. Winston. Roitte line.-From West Washington the line follows the towpath of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal as far as V'levertou, Md.; thence it follows the branch of tho Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Hagerstown. Observer and dates.-Tp.e observations are by Sub-assistant J.B. \Veir, aml they comprise the period July 24 to September 10, 1883. Jnstrument.-Spirit level No. 1 and metric rods A and B were used. The constants for this instrnmen t are given in the preceding appendix, but the collar inequality adopted, - 3"·12, is the mean of the observations of ,luly and October, 188.3. The wooden rods with brass scales are 3 m. in length, and the scales are of standard Yalue at a temperature of G5° F., nearly. The abutting ends of the rods project 7·83 cm. below tlte zero of graduation. Jfcthorl of obse1·ving.-It was the same as stated in the preceding appendix on tlle Richmoud\Yashiugton l>ranch of levels, viz, two parallel lines run simultaneously and in tlle same direction, one hy rod A and tlrn other by rod B, placed at different distances from the instrument. The long sight was' observed firRt during one day, but the short sight on tlle second day. Adjacent sections of the lino were run in opposite directions. On the average the length of the sight line is less than 100 m.
*With diagram showing route line and position of bench marks. tThc line was run by A. Braid, Assistant, between July and December, 1881.

APPENDIX No. 8.-1896.
RESULTING HEIGHTS FROM SPIRIT LEVELING BET\VEEN JEFFERSON CITY, MO., AXD HOLLIDAY, KANS., FROM OBSERVATIONS BY I. WINSTON, ASSISTANT, AND F. A. YOUNG, AID, BETWEEN APRIL 21 AND OCTOBER 13, 1891.·
Submitted for publication by Chns. A. Schott, Assistant in charge of Computing Division, October 1, 1896.

I have the honor to submit herewith a report on the resulting heights from spirit leveling of a line commencing 8 kilometres (5 statute miles) east of Jefferson City, Mo., and extending to Holliday, Kans., about 22 kilometres (14 statute miles) westerly of Kansas City, Mo. It is a continuation of the line of levels which starts from the bench mark on the bridge across the :Mississippi at St. Louis, known as beuch mark K 3, and is published as Appendix No. 2, Report for 1893, part 2, page8 19-36. In that appendix the resulting levels are carried as far as the vicinity of Jefferson City; iu the present report the distances and heights relative to K 3 will be continued. This mark is on the same level as the so-called ''City Directrix" at St. Louis, and was used as reference mark ·by the :Missouri River Commission in its leveling between that city and Kansas City and beyoud.t The line was run twice, one observer leveling in a forward direction, the other in the opposite direction, and each observer using his own instrument, but the same rods. Ro1de line.-The line follows the Missouri Pacific Railway as far as Kansas City, whence it follows the Atchison, Topekn. and Santa Fe Railway to Holliday, Kans. · Observers and dates of lei·eUng.-The observers were I. "Winston and F. A. Young. They worked at alternate periods attending to observing and computing. The leveling was done between April 21 aud October 13, 1891. · Instruments and rods.-The micrometer spirit levels Nos. 5 and 6 were constructed at the Survey Office in 1888, after the pattern of spirit level N o.1, for wl.ticll see Appendix No. 11, Heport for 1880. They differ from No. 1 only in some minor detail:'.!; one of tllese is the perfect balancing of the weight of the telescope resting on the two collars during observation, i. e., when the focal ~djustment is made and when the i;ihade cover is in place. The instrumental constants are as follows:

Jlfethod of obser?Jing.-The method adopted this season was the same as that followed on the. p!'eceding part of the line between Etlah and Jefferson City (Appendix No. 2, Report for 1893, part 2, p. 22), viz, two independent measures are made, one in the forward or westerly direction by one of the observers and the other in the opposite or easterly direction by the l'!econd observer, but on different days, and each observer using his own instrument, -Winston, No. 5, aud Young, No. 6, but the same rods, N and O, and toward the end of the season Rods I and K. The line was divided off in convenient stretches of about 10 km. in length, the observers ueiug e11gaged alternately in field work and in comput.ing work; in case their two measures of such a subdivision when compared proved not quite satisfactory, a third measure was made. The average distance between the instrument and the rod was about 95 m. Computations.-The field computation is by the observers, the office computation by H. F. Flynn, aiucd by L. Pike.and H. G. Ogden; the comparison and final results are due to Mr. Winston. Results.-The resulting heights of the bench marks are contained iu the following tabular statement of the individual measures; they are relative, and giye the 11ift'erence between each bench mark and that of the City Directrix (so called) at St. Louis. .The absolute heights above the Gulf of Mexico can not yet be given; approximately the mark K 3 is 125·8 metres, or 412·7 feet, above that level. As the result of the leYeling we find the height of B. M. LXIII at Holliday, Kans., above B. M. K 3 at St. Louis 100·665 m., and distant from B. M. XXY, near Jefferson City, measured along the route, 481·65-194·tl1=286·74 km. We find also by squaring the numbers in the column "Partial discrepancy F - B" the value of [d d] =54 75, hence the mean error ni, of a single leveling of 1 km .

'l.'he distauce from the St. Louis mark to the Kansas City marks along the line of level:; of 1882, 1888, and 18!H, via Jefferson Uity and Sedalia, is about 458 km. This line, with that of the Missouri River Commission, 'which in geueral followed the course oft.he river, forms a loop of levels with a periphery of 458 + 550, or 1 008 km., of which the closing error is the above small qua11tity, 0·340 m. A smaller loop between St. Louis, Mo., and .Tefterson City, Mo., 205·1 km. by the route of the Coast and Geodetic Survey aud 234·9 km. by that of the Missouri River Commission (following the river), leads to the following comparison: Height of B. M. 90 (85) by Coast and Geodetic Survey, 43·606 m.; same uy Missouri River Commission, 43·821 m.; hence closing enor -0·215 m. There is another loop which branches off our line at Pleasant Hill B. ::\1. No . ...U and conuects again at Holliday B. M. LXIII. These No.1. and several other loops will be adjusted as soon as all the measures shall have been completerl, and it may be remarked here that these closing errors furnish the means of forming a more accurate and true estimate of the accuracy of leveling results than can 1'e had from line measures alone. As au illustration, we may contrast here the value of r = ± 25 mm. with half the closing error of the large loop, or 170 mm. In fact, as is well known, leveling· errors are composed of accidental errors and of systematic errors, the latter largely predominatiug. This i::i also shown by the numbers in the column of accumulated errors. After some small oscillations of+ auu - sign there is a gradual rise UJl to -104 mm., with a filial descent to -43 mm., and we notice tbat Oll the shorter line, St. Louis to J eft'erson Ci tr, the comparison between the results from the two lines of levels sl10ws a difference of -0·21.'3 m. at a distance of 20.J km., which rose to -0·:340 m. at the distance of 458 km.; that is, the discrepancy nearly reached two-thirds of the whole at about half the distance. We also have the following closing error in tlrn first loop, St. Louis to Etlab, viz, B. M. XIV (App. 2, Rept. for 1893, part 2, pp. 25-28), height 29·082 m.; same by the levels of the Mi:ssouri River Commission (Rept. for 1893, App. ZZ, p. 4062), 29·155 m.; hence closing· error, 0·073 m. Distance by Coast and Geodetic Survey line llG·'.! km. and by the l\Iissouri River Commission line 145·8 km.; total circuit, 2G2·0 km. The separate loops are shown on tl.Je above diagram, which gives also the separate closing errors and distauces.

ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY CIRCLE, AND THE DETERMI~ATION OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL POSI1'10X OF THE CEXTEH OF THE CLOCK ROOM.
By E. D. P1rnsTOX, Assistant.

.

On the li:;t day of August, 18947 a joint resolution of Congress was approved, ~hich provided for the establishment of a circle around the United States Naval Observatory. The said act was embodied iu public resolution No. 36, and was entitled:
Joint resolution to establish an observatory circle as a provision for guarding the dollcato 11Btronomic11l instruments at tho United States NaYal Observatory against smoke or currents of boated air in their neighborhood, nnd undue vibrations from traffic upon the extension of publio thoroughfares in the vicinity, and for other purposes.

Section 107 of the act just cited, reads as follows:
That the said appraisers are hereby authorized to call upon the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Sun·e~· to make such 1mrvoyM as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this act, and the saitl Superiutentlent is authorized and required to make such surveys untlcr the direction of the said Commissioners.

The appraisers named by the honorable Secretary of the Navy, and nuder whom the survey was undertaken and carried out, were Hon. John W. Ross, chairman of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia; Mr. T. R Waggaman, and Capt.. F. V. l\fo~air, U. S. N., Superintendent of the Na val Observatory. I was most effieiently aided in the field and offic~ work by Messrs. J. B. Boutelle and C. C.Yates, of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The provisions of the joint resolution, briefly stated, were as follows: ..A. circle with the centre coinciding with the centre of the clock room and with a radius of 1 000 feet was to be established and described on the ground. All that portion of the original Naval Observatory property lying· outside the said circle was to be sold, and all that land lying within the said circle and not then belonging to the United States was to be acquired by purchase. The methods by which these transfers were to be made, as well as the steps to be taken in case of nonagreement as to price between purchasers and sellers, and other possible contingencies, are well defined in the act of Congress. They form, however, no part of the work undertaken by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and are entirely without the province of this service. The present paper, t11erefore, has for its object a brief account of the method employed in laying out the circle, a statement of the accuracy attained in the final results, and, as incident thereto, a new determination of the position of the centre of the clock room, which is the initial point of longitudes for the United States. . Several methods were suggested for the establishment of the circle. The first one was simply to select that radius of the proposed circle which lay over the most level part of the grounds, determine one point of the circumference by direct measurement, and run in the entire circle by the ordinary method of tangents, as employed by railroad engineers. This <lid not appear feasible, or at least did not seem capable of giving a high degree of accuracy in the results, without extraordinary care, on account of the extremely abrupt nature of the topography of some parts of the circle. Moreover, this method had already been employed by some surveyors a few years ago, and
285

the closing- error was given as 1 foot. It was desirable to mark the boun<laries more closely than thii:;. Be~ides, a different method of getting at the same results would check the previous deter· miuation aud give increased confidence in the work. The second method proposed was that of using a ~apeline of 100 feet length as a telemeter and determining its distance by measuring the angle subtended at the centre of the circle. Four such distances were to be fixed, and the intervening quadrants were to be established by the ordinary way, already mentioned. This plan, although elegant in conception, when examined closely did not turn out to be practicable. In the first place, because it would have involved cut· ting a number of lines through the beautiful groves of the Observatory, and secondly, because it required a very high degree of accuracy for the measure of the angles at the centre. A simple geometrical construction shows that the uncertainty in the length of one of the radii is about twenty times that of the angular measures at the centre: or, using the formula for finite difterences, ·
L::. b =

- a sin 6 0 sin (0 + 6 0)

it appears that an error of 1 second in the angle ( 0) at the centre would imply an error of about one-tenth of a foot in the distance (b) from the centre; a is taken as 1 000 feet, the radius of the circle; the value of 0 for this particular case is 2° 51' 57"·5, this being half the angle subtended by a chord of 100 feet on a circle of the dimensions given. Besides, since 1 second on the circumference of a circle of this radius is in the neighborhood of one.sixteenth of an inch, the pointings with the telescope must define the limiting lines of the telemeter to this degree of accuracy, which would require an instrument capable of supporting a power greater than was then available. Moreover, it would have been a difficult matter to keep the tapeline at a known length within one-sixteenth of an inch. Although quite easy under favorable conditions, in the present case the precautions necessary as regards temperature, tension, inclination, etc., would have made the operation a troublesome and unsatisfactory one. It was therefore evident that by this method the uncertainty of the length of the radii of the circle would be about a quarter of a foot. The third method (see PL I), which was adopted, consisted in inscribing a decagon within the proposed circle, making the apices of the angles at the centre coincident with the centre of the clock room, and the exterior sides as near to the circumference as the configuration of the ground would admit. It was desirable to have all the corners of the decagon near and within the circle; in two cases, however, in order to get intervisibility, it was necessary to place the stations a short distance outside the circle, and in others, to avoid puilding exceptionally high signals, the points were located considerably inside the circumference. But these distances were not so great that their measurement involved errors greater than would necessarily ensue from the instruments and methods employed in the triangulation. One of the exterior sides of the decagon was measured as a base line. Three angles were measured in each triangle, and the triangulation was carried around to close on the original line. Owing to the fact that two of the exterior points. (Hand I) were not intervisible, the point I was determined in two ways, which supplied a check equal in point of accuracy to that accorded any of the other stations. The station at the centre was on a scaf. fold 20 feet high, built over the clock room, and having the point of occupation vertically over the centre of the room. By this procedure the greatest uncertainty in the lengths of the radii did not exceed three-hundredths of a foot. The following were the angleA at the centre adjusted for station error:

The following corrections were applied:

The above table shows that any one of the five measures is sufficiently accurate for the trian· gulation which it was intended to construct upon the base line. It is, however, but a reassertion of a fact many times established that it is much easier to attain high accuracy in linear meaaurement than it is to preserve it in the angular measurement of geodetic work.

The average correction to an angle at the center to close the horizon was 0"·16, while the average correction to an angle to close the triangles was 2"·1. It should be stated here that different instruments were employed in the two cases. The angles at the center were measured with theodolite No. 140 (8" diam.), reading to 2 seconds. The exterior points were occupied with theodolite No.156 (6" diam.), reading to 5 seconds; moreover, the measures were not made by the same observer. Since one of the sides is about 330 feet in length, an error of 2" in an adjacent augle would imply an inaccuracy of centering and pointing not greater than one-twenty-ftfth of an inch. There are few signal poles used in triangulation· that will give the ~ame centre to this degree of precision when observed from different sides, so that an error of a few seconds was quite witl1in unavoidable discrepancies. The aveq1ge length of a radial line is 953 feet; the average exterior side is 742 feet long. The side of a triangle is then, say, approximately 850 feet. Two seconds being about 1-100 000 pa.rt of the radius, we might expect in each new base an error of less than oue one-hundredth of a foot from angular errors in its own triangle; but there would be some compensation of errors in the continuous development of the scheme of figures.

where a and b are the lengths of the last side and base, and where A indicates angles opposite the required sides and B those opposite the given sides, an<l. where r 1 and r 2 stand for the probable error of the base and of an angle, respectively, we fiud a resulting probable error of 0·02 feet from both base line and angle measures. That of the base line is, however, without significance when compared with the uncertainties in the angle measures. The actual discrepancy found agrees sufficiently well with this, and we may tberefore conclude that an accuracy has been attained in the final result commensurate with the precision of the instruments employed and in reasonable accord with the method of observing. If we start from the measured base A B with len~th of 4!4·80 feet, and carry the computation around the d((Cagon to close again in the same line, we derive a value for .fl B of 444·7!) feet. This circuit is by the most direct way, and ignores for our present purpose the point I, as well as the figures J[ 0 I aud A 0 I. If, however, we carry the computation by the same route around to the line]( 0 and then set out from the base again and proceed iu the opposite direction, meeting the previous computation on the line K O, we get a discrepancy of 0·03 feet. This might have been expected, since the probable error of the last side, as we see from the formula, is a function of its length. If we calculate the error to be expected in this line from the known probable errors of the base liue and the angular measures, we get 0·04 feet, which is also practically the discrepancy found. As the computation was carried to the third decimal plaee only, a difference in results of one unit in the second place may occur through loss by decimals. We may therefore give 0·03 feet as the greatest uncertainty of any of the radii of the circle. With the establishment of the Observatory Oircle arose tl!e necessity for an accurate survey of the original property. This was done in October, 1894, all the original points being recovered, and the astronomical azimuth of the sides being determined by conuectiou with the side 0 0 of the triangulation. The bearings of the lines, together with the distances, are given in Pl. I. The following table of areas shows the superficial contents in the various divisions adopted:

At the request of the Navy Department, Plot I, lying north and east of Massachusetts avenue, was subdivided into 31 lots, as shown in Pl. I. The approximate dimensions were furnished by Capt. F. V. Mc"Nair, and the boundaries were traced on the ground and permanently marked by heavy stakes. This plot was subsequently rearranged by the Department int-0 three subdivisions. The bearings and distances of the two arrangements are on file in the archives of the Survey. As a matter of curiosity it may be stated that in disposing of this land the Department was forced to name the price of one of the subdivisions to eight decimal places. The two conditions imposed were that Subdivision B, together with Lots XI to XVIII, i. e., 4·25 acres, should be sold for 30 cents per foot, and to satisfy certain other conditions the total area of 14·4.J acres should be sold for $141 454·27. These conditions being rigid, the remaining 10·20 acres had to be disposed of at $0·19336765 per square foot.
TUE DE'.1.'ER:IIIN.A.TION OF THE POSITION OF THE NAVAL OBSERVATORY.

The occupation of the center of the clock room madl~ it possible to make an independent determination of the initial point for longitudes in the United States. Three prominent triangulation points of the Coast and Geodetic Survey were visible from this station, which enabled us to fix the position by the three-point problem with a very short series ot' observations. Each pointing at the center was made in three positions of the circle 120° apart with two series in each position; one series consi::1ts of a pointing with telescope direct, and one with telescope reversed, so that each angle was given twelve independent measures. The facility with which this last determination was made, as well as the accuracy of the results, seems to warrant a statement here of the different determinations.
I.

In July, 1881, Mr. F. 0. Donn~ under the direction of Mr. Charles Junken, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, made a triangulation to determine the proposed site of the new Naval Observatory. It was based on the known points, Kengley, Columbian College, and Georgetown College, as shown by the following sketch:

The following sketch (No. 3) shows the relative positions of the points used and of the point of occupation: These data were also submitted to Mr. Schott, who deduces the following result from the position sought:

The position of the new Naval Observatory (center of clock room) has been determined astro-· nomically by Professor Eastman, and the results are given in Astronomy and Astro-Physics (vol. 12, p. 699). Giving the work a differential character and basing his results on previous determinations of the old Naval Observatory, Professor Eastman arrives at the following results:
cp=38° 55 1 1411 ·68 'A= 51> 8"' 15 ·71·=77° 31 55 11 ·65

Oomparing these with the mean of the geodetic determinations already given, and assuming that the deviations of the vertical are the same in amount and direction at the two stations, we have a deflection of the zenith at the new Naval Observatory of 2"·35 toward the south, and one of 6"·59 toward the east.

We may safely assume that the deflections of the vertical are fairly compensated in the combination of observations from 12 point~, and therefore, giving equal weights to the three determinations, that the geodetic position of the center of the clock room at the new Naval Observatory is

.A NEW SOLUTION OF A PRINCIPAL GEODETIO PROBLEM.

By CIIAS. H. KUMMELL, Computer.

In my article in No. 2671.A.str. Nachr. "On the de.termination of the shortest distance between two points on a spheroid," I stated on page 105 that the inverse pro\Jlern could not advantageously be solved by the forms given. .A closer study, however, has gradually developed new forms well adapted to its most comprehensive solution. This geodetic problem can properly only occur between intervisible points, since one of its data is the astronomical azimuth a 1 from the first to the second point. This must, however, first be reduced to the azimuth of the geodetic line or braehistbode a1 by a formula first developed by Bessel and given by Helmert in the form:
1 p 11-· Lls2 ( cos 2<p1 sm · 2 Lls . 2 rp1 sma1 . ) a 1=a1- 12 ~(i'l a1+--asm
'::0-"-41 +~I

(1)

Where p" =

ar~

111 , e=eccentricity of meridian, a= equatorial radius, Lls=geodetic distance between

the points, <p 1=astronomical latitude of first point. The symbol\&..~'I indicates that the remainder of the series is of the second order with respect to e and of the fourth order with respect to

~~,which

is generally a much smaller quantity thane and is about equal to it if L1s=500 ooom.

For the geodetic problem involving the encircling of the globe there can be 110 astronomical azimuth given. Let <p1=astronomical latitude of first point, Lls=shortest distance, a1=azimuth ofbrachisthode at first point, be the data of the problem, and let it be required to find <p2=<p1+Ll<p=astronomical latitude of second point, . LIA.=difference of longitudes, a 2 =180°+a·1+Lla=back azimuth. Also let ¢ 1 =reduced latitude of first point, ¢ 2=i/·1+Llif1=reduced latitude of second point, ¢ 0 =highest (or lowest) reduced latitude of brachisthode at a point where it is perpendicular to the meridian. · Then the equation of the brachisthocle is: cos 1/·o=sin a cos if1=sin a1 cos if:1 = -sina2 cost-·2, (2) and the well-known relations between the astronomical and reduced htitudes are:
-b tan 1f"= ./1-e2 tan <p=a,tan <p

This series being from its second term of the second order in ecce11tricity depends more on To obtain a serieR convergent for great distances, we may either develop cos (y, er) by the binomial theorem according to powers of y 2 < e2 and integrate, or better transform (8 11 ) to a modulus
L1<1 to be a small quantity for its convergence and must not be used for very great distances.

y' =

ai' +Lia', which leads to a more convergent series.

Such

a series is given by Helmert, Vol. I, page 221, etc. Or we may descend still further in the modular scale until the modulus vanishes, as I have done in my article mentioned above. The best device for practical purposes, however, would be a table for

J: da cos (y, o-) = E (y,

cr), which ought to

extend from y = 0 to y = e and from (f = 0 to cr = 900. The table which Legenure has published in his Traite de Fouctions Elliptiques, Table IX, page 291, is such a table with intervals of 1° for y =sin fJ and Cf, too lnrge,·though, for convenient interpolation. However, we can use this tabte to find E (y, 0-1) from y and 11'1 and then we have to the same modulus
E (y, <r1

+ L1<1) =cos 11 + E (y, ()1)

L1s

(25)

which gives by inverse interpolation 111 + .1<r. We are then in possession of the important quantity L1a, so that in the spherical triangle 1. N. 2 three parts 90-1/,'i, 180-ai, '1<Y are given; and to determine the parts 1f"i +'1if:, '1Ao, a 1 +.aa is a problem of spherical trigonometry.

The agreement with the results by the Coast Survey formulre is also satisfactory, only the longitude A2 is greater hy 0"·002. I come now to the consideration of the third class of geodetic problems, when the distance is so small that the convergence of the series depends almost entirely on the small quantity

~8 · The

effect on my solution would consist in the omission of the reduction of ~,stron'."mfoa.l to geodetic azimuth, the compu tati on of L1 <Y in one term, and in passing directly from tan ~ L1 :,'.· to tan ~ L1 <p by the approximate relation:
(53)

With all these simplifications, however, it is easily seen that the unnecessary rigor of my forms does not very well snit this class. It is much more convenient to compute Ll<p, .d;\ 1 and L1a from a few terms of the series given by Helmert, page 268. We find this plan followed in the con· venient tables published by Prof. R. S. Woodward, pages 70-77 of Smithsonian Geographical Tables. He uses for each of the required quantities two terms and checks by Dalby's Theorem. Thus he has in our notation:"'

and tabulates the factors depending only on the latitude. The limiting distance for the use of the8e tables is given by the author 12 ooom for 0"·01 to be reliable.

If results are required correct to 0"·001, then these tables should not be used for distances >75 OOOm. In their proper limits they are very convenient, An attempt to extend their sphere by adding terms would not be advisable, because we should have to add to the series for Ll<p three troublesome terms; also the approximate formula for L1 A. had to be replaced by a series of seven terms.t Only the azimuth could be still computed by Dalby's theorem.

TABLE'S OF CROSS SECTIONS ON THE NORTH SHORES OF NANTUCKET AND M.AUTHAS VINEYARD, MASSACHUSETTS.

By H. L.

MAlU:!.'DIN,

Assistant. .

OFFICE OF THE CO.A.ST A.ND GEODETIO SURVEY,

Washington, D. O., February 29, 1896. Srn: I have the honor to submit tabulated cross sections of the shores of the islands of Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard, off the coast ot' Massachusetts, being the results from the reduction of the field notes of a party iu my charge during. the summer of 1894. The comparison of the position of the shore line (high-water line) in 1887 and 1894 indicates a retreat of the shore of 0·18 m. per year for that part of the north shore of Nantucket lying between the harbor of Nantucket and the western end of the island. This large erosion was not anticipated, judging by the comparatively sheltered position of the northern shore, but it might have been inferred from the well-defined retreat of both the eastern and southern shores, that for the former having been found to have been 0·19 m. per year and for the latter 1·42 m:'per year between 18-!G and 1891. The reduction of the cross sections measured on the north shore of Marthas Vineyard between the harbor of Edgartown and the bluffs south of Cottage City indicates an advance of this sandy shore at the rate of 0·2 m. per year between 1888 and 1894. This is so far the only instance where an accretion to the f!hore is noted on either of the islands under examination. The observations made in 1891-92 on the south shore show a rapid wasting away of the coa8t · line. The yearly loss bas not been ascertained, as no comparison has as yet been made with earlier surveys; but we know that the waste on the south shore is not compensated by any known accretion to the northern shore. Before closing I would respectfully recommend the reduction of the field notes of cross sections measured between Long Point and the entrance into the inner harbor of Nantucketthls would complete the contour of the island-and also that a comparison be made between the results of the reduction of the observations made on the south shore of the "Vineyard" in 1891-92 with earlier surveys. In asking that the accompanying tables be published in the Annual Ueport, it may be said that two objects will be attained-one, the multiplication of copies of information, the value of which increases as time passes; an.d another, by offering the possibility of reproducing with accuracy the position of tho shore line at the date of the surveys compared, or, in other words, reproducing the topographical delineation of the shore line without recourse to the ai(l of the topographical sheet. Very respectfully,

FIELD METHOD OF REDUCING PORTABLE TRANSIT TIME OBSERVATIONS·

By G. R. PUTNAM, Assistant.

These notes are intended to give an e~ample and brief explanation of the method of time reduction as now generally used in field computations on the Ooaat and Geodetic Survey. In the office computations and more rigid work the method of least square reduction is adhered to, as explained by Assistant Schott in Appendix No. 14, Report Coast and Geodetic Survey for 1880 ("Determination of time by means of the transit instrument"), and as generally given in works on practical astronomy. This field method makes use of successive approximations t-0 determine the collimation (o) and azimuth (a) errors, and takes no account of weights. The method here described differs from approximate methods sometimes employed, in that all the observations are combined in deriving o and a. As by its use some saving of labor may be effected and results may be obtained not differing materially for some purposes from those derived with the more rigid reductions, it will be found of value for field work. In the following memoranda the nomenclature and formulas used by Assistant Schott in the above-mentioned appendix are adhered to, and reference may be made to that paper for general instructions in regard to time determinations, adjustment of instruments, and full explanation of the various corrections. In Form 1· are given the observations of a set of ten stars as read from a chronograph sheet, with level readings and reduction as far aa the derivation of a-ti; the t 1 here indicating the observed time of transit corrected for rate, diurnal aberration, and inclination, but not corrected for collimation or azimuth errors. The corrections for rate and diurnal aberration and the pivot inequality may often be neglected in field reductions, but are shown here for the sake of completeness. In this example the level readings with telescope pointing north and south are combined separately, and the mean then taken to derive the level error of the instrument for each group of stars. This is done to avoid the unequal effect of any lack of symmetry in the pivots; and to give equal weights to the separate readings it would be desirable that the north and south
*The constants of the instrument nfled in tbi11 exa1JJple are as follows: I division of ~trilling level= 1"·674 (=0·0279a. x 4). Pivot inequality =-O·OlOa. Band 'Vest. Equatorial intervals of lines, Band West,

readiugs should be equal in number, as for insta.nce two north and two south (in this example they are unequal). There is also shown a convenient method for obtaining the average time of transit from the eleven lines. In the column to the right of the observed times the time for the middle line is written, aud below it the sums respectively for each two lines at nearly equal intervals from the middle. These sums should of course be approximately equal and double the middle time, thus affording a ready check on auy discordant observation or erroneous chronograph reading. At the foot of the column the sum of the whole is written, and this divided by eleven of course gives the average time for the eleven lines, which is then written beneath the obRerve<l timefil. In general, this average can be arrived at by adding only the decimal part of the secoutl column and such part of the integral numbers as exceed double the middle time, as will be understood by examining the example. In the case of two stars in this set, the observations were not complete, and the reduction is made by the equatorial intervals. Where only a few lines are missed an<l the lines are. uniformly spaced, a fah approximation can be obtained by taking the mean of remaining lines equidistant from the middle. An approximate reduction can also be obtained by comparing the observed lines with observations of the same star on another evening. The balance of the computation on this form follows customary metheds, and is explained by the marginal data.. The a-t1 at the foot of tbe columns represents the chronometer correction from each star, uncorrected for the collimation and azimuth errors of the iustrument. In Form 2 is shown the derivation of the collimation (c) and azimuth (a) errors of the instrument, and the final chronometer correction ( e:.T) from each star. The a-t 1 derived in Form 1 are written together in a column, grouped for the two positions of the instrument, followed by columns containing the collimation (C) and azimuth (A) factors of the stars. The observing list is so selected that each group of stars observed in one position of tbe instrument shall contain a low north or azimuth star and several stars near the zenith or time stars. The latter are preferably some north and some south of the zenith, so that their mean azimuth factor shall be nearly zero. If this is impracticable it is desirable for convenience in computation tha.t the mean azimuth factors for the two groups shall be nearly equal. Such a selection of time stars as will, as far as possible, eliminate instrumental errors is importii.nt, though it is not always practicable, as for instance in high latitudes, where stars north of the zenith are too slow to make good time stars. In this computation to derive c and a, the time stars in each position of the instrument are combined and treated as one star, by taking the meaus of their a-ti, and of their star factors 0 and .A, respectively, tbese means being written below the separate stars in this form, together with the azimuth stars. On the assumption that the means of the time stars in the two positions of the instrument are equally affected by the azimuth correction, the first approximation to c is found by dividing the difference between the mean a- ti, by the difference between the C. In the (a-t 1 )w-(a-ti) 8 -3·94-(-4·07) +0·13 5 Th · f example, c (first approximation)= -·=··----· =+·O 1. es1gn o +1·25-(-1·32) +2·57 0 w _·-c·-8 C is arbitrarily taken as plus for band west and minus for band east, and the resulting sign of c may be derived by inspection, or by the rule of subtracting the east values from the west, both a-t1 and 0. Using this approximation to c, the correction Cc is then subtracted from the a-ti of the means of the time stars and of the azimuth stars, aud the values in colnmn a-ti-Cc obtained. Separate values for the azimuth error of the instrument are then derived for each position of the instrument by dividing the difference between the a-ti-Cc for the meau of the time stars and the azimuth star by the difference between their A.

the difterence in the last column as still an error of collimation, and thus obtaiuing· a correction -4·05-( -4·00) - ·05 s . . to the first approximate value of c. Thus, m the example,+ 1 .25 _( _ 1.32 ) + 2.51=-0·019. Applying this correction to the first approximate value of c = + ·051, we have for a second approximation, c= + ·032. Proceeding as before, improved values for aw and a.e are found. If the star sets are well chosen and the instrumental errors small the first approximation will generally suffice. If the values of a-t 1 -Cc-Aa differ by but a few hundredths, east and west, there is little gained by making a closer adjustment; the time will probably not be changed at all, but the instru-. mental errors and star residuals will be slightly altered, as is apparent from the example, where the closer adjustment is made for the purpose of illustrating the method. In the first approximation the value of c may at once be derived more closely when there is much difference between the mean A for the time stars, by estimating the effect of this difference in A on the 6 T, and allowing for this effect when deriving c in the first place. The formula for c (a-f)w-(a-t) -(A -A )xa. then becomes c= - - - - - - .:_ w e · It is here necessary to estimate the azimuth of 0 w 0e the instrument a roughly in advance, and this may be done by inspection. Thus, in the example, 8 · ~ -a·94+4·07-(+·08)x(+0·5) +·09 s . assummg a=+O·;,, we have c= +l·2'5 + 1 .32 = 2 ;57 = +0·035, agreemg closely with the value given by the second approximation. V\'hen satisfactory values of c, aw, and ae have been obtained, the corrections Cc and Aa are applied separately to each star, as shown in the up1ler part of Form 2, and the values of the chronometer correction ( 6 T) derived separately. The residuals are taken for each group from the mean of that group, and thus fnruish a convenient check on the computation, as their sums for each group should approximate zero. Unusual residuals also point to possible errors in the a-t1· The mean of. the 6 T from the separate stars gives the final chronometer correction at the epoch of the mean right ascension of the stars observed. The above example is a time set observed in telegraphic longitude work! and is more elaborafo both as to number of observations and computation than would be required for many purposes where an approximate method of time reduction would be employed. The method, even in so complete a form as here given, may be appliecl with rapidity, however, where sy8tematic forms are used, and with the aid of Crelle's multiplication tables. Special attention should be paid throughout to sign8. The formula for the chronometer correction (omitting diurnal aberration and rate corrections) is 6 T=a-(t+Aa+Bb+Cc). (Report 1880, Appendix 14, page 14.) Let t 1=t+Bb, then 6T=(a-t1)-Aa-Cc, so that it will be seen that the corrections Aa and Oc are to be subtracted algebraically throughout from a-t 1·

DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTANT OF ABERRATION FROM LATITUDE OBSERVATIONS WITH THE ZENITH TELESCOPE AT HONOLULU, H. I., AND SAN FRANOISOO, OAL.
Report
by

E. D.

PRESTON,

Assistant.

THE CONST.A.NT OF ABERRATION.

The results of the work on the constant of aberration have been made public in Bulletins Nos. 28 and 32. Since their appearance considerable work has been done in this direction aud the observations by the methods explained in the aforesaid bulletins lead to values agreeing very closely with the generally accepted constant. The mean of the results from the series at Honolulu and San Francisco gives the value 20·"458, which differs only 0"·005 from the mean of 24 results given by Professor Newcomb· and only 0"·003 from the adjusted value by Professor :f!:arkness,t and moreover lies between them. The contribution of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey to this important problem has never yet appeared in the Annual Report, and it is therefore inserted in the present volume with some minor changes and additions to the original matter as it appeared in the bulletins. The amount of data utilized in the present case is considerable. The actual observations at Honolulu extended over a period of about thirteen months, a.nd those at San Francisco about fifteen months, and the total number of conditional equations employed was 9 138, of which about one-fourth contained four and the remainder two unknown quantities. The insertion in the Annual Report of these two papers combined into one appendix and somewhat amplified makeR the Report complete in its information as to the work of the office and gives the determination of the constant of 11.berration by the Coast and Geodetic Survey a permanent form.

HONOLULU OBSERVATIONS.

The astronomical observations made by the author at Waikiki near Honolulu in 1891and1892 showed conclusively that the latitude of this place bad a periodic variation. Its value on.July O, 1891, was 210 16' 24"·41 and for any subsequent time during the period of observation it may be found by substitution in the formula: Latitnde. = 21o16' 24"·386 +0·028 cos . 0-0·297 sin (I · -0·039 cos 2&-0·006 siu 28 +0·040 cos 38+0·001 sin 38 where 8 is the angular distance of the pole from its assumed place on .Tuly o, on the supposition that its rlaily motion is 0°·925.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The work having come under Professor N ewcomb's observation, he made the suggestion that the individual results as already prepared for publication should be discussed with a view of bringing out a correction to the constant of aberration. The method proposed contemplated a simultaneous determination of the constant of aberration and the changes of latitude, and the solution was all the more desirable because recent work indicates that the usually accepted value for this constant (20"·445) is susceptible of improvement and also that by a combined determination we should have an independent check on the law of latitude change deduced from these same observations. The plan to be followed in the solution was outlined by Professor Newcomb and transmitted to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in letter of January 14, 1893. On account of other duties the work could not be taken up immediately, but during the latter part of .l\:lay, while on leave of absence at Spruce Grove, Pa., I formed more than 2 000 of the conditional equations. The remaining ones were computed after my return and the subnormals were derived by Mr. Moss during the month of June. After several interruptions the subject was again taken up and prepared for publication. The following extract is from Professor Newcomb's Jetter above referred to:
Memorandum for determining simultaneously the variations of latitude and the constant of aberration from a homogeneous series of observations of pairs of stars with the zenith telescope, the latitude from each individual pair, using astmmed declinations, having first been completely determined. Let us put R=that part of the reduction to apparent place which depends on the aberration

R+R' X . Rand R' being the reduction for the North an<l South stars of a pair respectively. 2 20 45 N=an angle increasing uniformly with the time, so as to make a revolution in 386 days. tp1 =the latitude derived from a single observation of n. single pair of stars. tpu= an approximate arbitrarily assumed value of the latitude to be used unchanged throughout.
Lltp= <Pt - tpo

Then each individual latitude from a pair of stars will give rise to an equation of condition of tho form
z+x cos N +Y sin N-Ap=Lltp

where the significance of the four unknown quantities z, x, y, and p are z correction to latitude minus correction of half snm of declinations of pairs of stars, quantities which need not and can not be determined separately. x and y =coefficients of periodic varin ti on of latitude p =correction to const.ant aberration. The unknown quantity z will have tho same value for the same pair of stars all the way through, but not for any two pairs. The shortest and most rigorous methods of solving the equations of condition will then be this. Divide the equations into as many groups as there are pairs of stars, all the equations from each pair forming a group. Form en.ch group from tho normal equation for four unknown quantities in the usual way. Supposing all the equations to be of equal weight, tho normal in z will be merely the sum of the groups. From the normal in z thn11 found determine z as a function of tho other three unknowns and of the sum of the values Lltp, which will be done by merely dividing the suni by the number of equations. Substitute this value of z in the other three normals derived from the group, thus getting three equations, which we may call "subnormals," involving only x, y, and p. Having done this with all the groups, the snm of all the subnormals in x will be the final normal equation for determining x, and eo on with the other unknown quantities. The principle of this method differs from that of the method ndopted by the Germane in two points. It assumes that during the time of any series of observations which are combined to attain a single set of results the changes . in the latitude can be represented by a single periodic term of known period. It does not assume that this law is valid outside the particular series under discussion. On the other hand, the German method makes no hypothesis respecting n law of variation of tho latitude except that the latitude remains constant during certain short intervals of time. But the present method involves a more rigorous adjustment of the declinat.ions of tho stars, since practically each star is considered independently as a group by itself. In other words, the value of z for each star being applied to its assumed declination, all tho declinations will be reduced to a uniform, comparable system.

It so happens that the period during which observations were made corresponds almost precisely to time of revolution of the principal axis of inertia of the earth about the axis of rotation.

From the day on which the first observations were made to that on which the last were madethat is, from June 6, 1891, to ,June 25, 1892, both inclusive-makes an interval of 386 days. This differs.so little from that adopted in the discussion of the variations of latitude that, for the sake of convenience in dealing with the circular functions, it was assumed as the period, and the initial value was placed at June 6. The difference of apparent and adopted period, from Chandler's mean period of about 428 days, would arise from the addition of his annual term. The entire series gives rise to 2 370 conditional equations distributed by pairs and groups as follows:

The different groups will be designated by Roman numerals and the individual pairs by Arabic subscripts, e. g., the fifth pair of the third group is III5 · The observati911 of 11 on June 7, 1891, gave for <p 1 the value of 24"·67; <po is taken as 24"·00, and we therefore have Ll<p = cp1 - <po=+ 0"·67. The angular distance traveled by the pole since June 6 is 0°·933, and hence cos N = + 1·00 and sin N = + 0·02. The positions of the two stars forming this pair were:

from which A=+ 0·19. The conditional equation for June 7 and for the observation on 11 is therefore
z + 1·00 x + 0·02 y + 0·19 p = + 0"·67.

For facility of computation, instead of using the equation in the form given by Professor Newcomb on page 3, +A was used instead of - A. This amounts to changing pinto - p; that is, taking p as the negative of the correction to the constant of aberration. In this way an equation of condition was formed for each one of the individual results for the latitude, making, as tabulated above, an aggregate of 2 370 equations, containing four unknown quantities and known terms. The method of dividing these equations into blocks for short intervals is shown by the following table, where all the observations on the first pair of Group I are used and t.he partial sum is derived from the first block preparatory to forming the subnormal equations. This division into . blocks was made to save the labor of forming the products of the coefficients for each separate equation. A final result is obtained which is, with only insignificant errors, the same as if each equation had been multiplied separately.

A similar summary was made for each pair, the blocks being chosen to conveniently fit the datts of observation. The block interval rarely exceeded ten days. The total nmnber of these block equations is 534. From these tables the subnormals were formed according to the following scheme: Compartment A contains the "block equations," the first of which has been previously given. In B are found the mean equations, corresponding liue for line with A, from which they were derived. Compartment 0 is deduced by multiplying the coefficient of x in B by the correspondiug equations in A. In lJ we have the equations resulting from multiplying the coefficients of yin B by the corresponding equation in A, and E comes from a similar use of the coefficient of p in B.

It is evident that by multiplying the coefficients of x in B by the coefficients of z in A we get the coefficients of x in A, so that the first column of 0 is the same as the second column of A, and it is therefore not written in Compartment a. Likewise by multiplying the coefficients of y in B by the coefficients of z in A we get the coefficients of y in A, i.e., the third column in A, so that the first column in D is t.he same as the third column of A; also the coefficients of yin .B by those of x in A give the coefficients of yin a, i. e., the third column of 0 (first column of 0 is unwritten), so that the second column of Dis the same as the third column of O, and is not put down. The products of the coefficients of yin B by those of yin .tl give the third column in D (first written one), and the coefficients of pin B by those of pin A give the fourth column in D. Eis formed in the same way, by multiplying the coefficients of p in B by the corresponding equations in A, it only being necessary to begin writing down the products derived from the coefficients of p in B by those of pin A. · In regard to the right-hand members of the equations in the several compartments, they are derived from the right-hand members of A .by the same process; that is to say, the multiplication of the several coefficients of Bis extended to the known members of A to get the corresponding members of O, D, and E.

The above method of forming the normal and subnormal equations has greatly abridged the work. That this treatment is entirely adequate and legitimate may be seen from the Jollowing general statement: Our conditional equations being of the form

To obtain the normal equation in x, mean coefficients for short periods are used. If we represent the difference between the actual coefficients a, b, o, etc., and the mean values by a, (3, y, etc., where we may put a1+~+a:i+etc. =A=a1 +a1=a.1+a2=etc.

b1+b2+b3+etc. -B=b1+/J1=b2+fl2=etc. n Our approximate normal equation in x would be (a1 b1 + a1 /31) z + (b1 bi+ b1 /3i) x + (c1 b1 + 01 /3i) y +etc. + (~ b2 + ~ /32) z + (b2 b2 + b2 /32) x + (~ b2 + ~ /32) y +etc. + (a:i b3 + Q.;i {33) Z + (b3 b3 + b3 {33) X + (~ b3 + C3 /J3) y +etc, etc. etc. etc. This differs from one formed rigorously for this particular group of n members by the quantity (ai /31 + ~ (J2 + a:i f:J3 +etc.) z + (b1 /Ji+ b2 /32 + b3 {33 +etc.) x + (ai /31 + ei /32 + 03 /13 +etc.) y +etc. Since the coefficients of z in the conditional equation are all unity, and therefore equal, it is evident that the quantity reduces to zero. The term
(b1 /Ji+ b2 (J2 + b3 (33 + etc.)

also reduces to zero in the first subgroup of I (from June 7 to June 11) because all the coefficients of x in this particular case happen to be equal. The term· (01 /31 + C2 f32 + c-J f33 +etc.) is not inappreciable, and its magnitude depends, of course, on the range of the values c1 o2 ~, etc., and on their irregularity. Since the sum of /31 + /32 + f33 + etc. is zero, the aforesaid term will always be small and will only be in error compared with the coefficient that would have resulted from a use of the a-0tual values of b1 b2 b3, etc., by the difference of the positive and negative results in the final sum. Recalling now the general form of the conditional eq nation z + x cos N + y sin N - Ap = L1 <:p we see that the coefficients of x and y are continuous functions, varyiug with the date, so that any irregularity of the coefficients in any particular subgroup would come from au unequal distribution of the observations over that particular period. \Vhen the observations are uniformly distributed there would be a fair compensation between the excess and defect of the results from using a mean multiplier instead of the actual coefficients. The coefficient of p varies with the date as well as with the star's position, but since it is comparatively small and changes slowly the effect of using a mean coeilicieut in this case does not materially alter the result. As a practical test of the validity of the foregoing assertions we may cowpare tlte normal equation in x for Group I, pair 1, derived in regular way, with that used in the auridg-e<l method of calculation.

Imitead oft.he equation previously given 36·86 z + 32·80 x - 9·69 y + 5·44 p = + 25·4; we get 38·86 z + 32·86 x - 9·57 y + 5·47'p = + 21>-45 so that the subnormal wouJd be 1·27 x+2·37y+1·19 p =-1·13 As on]y one or, at most, two significant figures are required in the deduced value of p, the final normal equations formed by the abridged method woald appear to give the necessary accuracy. The equation between mean and apparent declination of a star, employing the notation given in the American ephemeris is: o - o0 = T µ' + Aa' + Bb' + Oc' + Dd' = Tµ' + gcos (G + a 0 ) + h cos (H + a 0 ) sin o0 + icos 0 0 The constant of aberration enters only the Jast two terms of these, and the periodic effect of them on the star's pJace and on the deduced latitude are shown graphicaJly in Plate 2. The quantities 0 and D are simply periodic functions, the first depending on the cosine and the second on the sine of the sun's longitude. They therefore pass through their period during the year and liave their maximum values at 18·76 and 20·45, respectively. c' and <l' being independent of the time and depending solely on the star's place would have the effect of changing the curves for C and D by a certain fixed ratio which would generally be less than unity. In the illustration we have the value of Oc' + Dd' for each of the stars a and b of pair 1 in Group I, shown graphic2 1ly throughout the year by a light dotted line. The sum of these two effects appears as a heavy dotted line and the resulting effect on the latitude of the place of observation is indicated by a full heavy line. 0 and D are ea-0h represented by a light fnll line.

We have here, then, a representation of the variation of the total effect on the latitude of those terms depending on the aberration for this particular pair. Tile range and maximum values of 0 and D are seen in the second and third columns of Table I. The subsequent ones show how these are modified by the star numbers, and the effect of declination is apparent by comparing the corresponding values of Oc' +Dd' for the two stars. In fact, an inspection of the formulro shows how the effect 011 the latitude is influenced by the star's position. For stars near the equator, and especially so when these stars are far from the equinoxial points, the curve for Dd' becomes more nearly a straight line. The second term of c' would also be small under this supposition, and for those cases where the star is north of the equator and the right ascension is near 6h the sign of the second term will be the same as that of the first, and their difference being taken the curve for this term will also be much reduced in amplitude. We may also more easily appreciate the effect of a change in the aberration constant on the variation of latitude by comparing Plates 1 and 2. The followiug table gives the values of the terms cos a sin o for every hour of right ascension and every 10 degrees of declination. It also shows the values of the second term of c', that is, the sine of the right ascension multiplied by the sine of the declination.

In order to compare the results of the present investigation with those derived by treating the observations according to Albrecht's methods (U.S. 0. and G. Survey Bulletin No. 27) it must be borne in mind that the values given on page 16 of the bulletin have not only been reduced to a mean-declination system for each particular group, but all the groups have moreover been compared with the first one taken as a standard, and corrected accordingly. These corrections deduced from the least square adjustment were as follows:

It is therefore necessary, in applying our present curve to the diagram on page 17 of Bulletin No. 27, to increase the mean value ofzby the mean of the quantities just given and we have as a result z = + 0·38 so that the equation z + x cos N + y sin N + Ap = L1 <p = <p1 - <po for June 20, 1891, would be

By llsing a mean value for A tlle platted curve will never be in error more than 0·01, which may be overlooked in the comparison of theory and observation. As the object of this paper is primarily to bring out the constant of aherration and the variations of latitude simultaneou~ly, it is not thought worth while to replat the original observations for comparison with our newly determined curve. The curve is simply displaced by a constant quantity which adapts it to the adjusted values in Bulletin No. 27. The agreement is shown equally well whether we apply the curve to the original observations or whether the corrected curve is applied to the adjusted observations. The values of the latitude therefore on a scale comparable with those of page lU of Bulletin No. 27 are as follows:

These values correspond to' the dotted curve in fig. 1. The small circles are the results from observations on the same scale, and the lower curve is the one derived in Bulletin No. 27 displaced vertically. It appears that Newcomb's method, in addition to a determination of the aherration constant, brings out simultaneously the periodic variations of the latitude, agreeing practically with the results from Albrecht's method. The period is slightly different in the two treatments.
l'ROHABLE 1mnon OF OBSXUVATION.

Without attempting to calculate the residuals from the 2 370 conditional equations, we can arrive at a very close approximation to th10 probable error of observation by selecting a few representative groups. The time from the beginning of July, 1891, to the beginning of June, 1892, is almost completely covered by the work in Groups III, Y, and VIII, so that the probable error from tllese groups may fairly be taken as involving those conditions, such as temperature, humidity, etc., which influence errors of observation. By substituting in all the conditional equations for III, V, and VIII, we may therefore get the probable errors of observation sufficiently accurate for our purpose. We haveGroup ---!No. of · equations.

This value of the aberration constant, combined with the late&t determinations of the velocity of light (V =186,330 miles) and Clarke's value for the earth's equatorial radius (R=3,963·30 miles), gives for the sun's distance and horizontal parallax the following results: Distance=92, 709,000 miles. Parallax=8"·82.
S.AN FRANCISCO OBSERVATIONS.

The refined methods employed during the last few years in studying the changes of latitude have incidentally thrown light on one of the fundamental constants of astronomy. Continuous measures of small differences of zenith distances, carried on with a view of detecting a suspected motion of the pole, furnish material for the determiuation of the effect of aberration. The long series of observations macle at Waikiki, Hawaiian Islands, iu 1891 and 1892, were discussed for this purpose, and now the still longer series made by Professor Davidson, at San Francisco, have just been subjected to the same treatment. The methods, however, were essentially differeut. Both are due to Professor Newcomb, and the work of computation has been done in the Coaet and Geo· detic Survey Office, partly by myself and partly by Mr. 0. C. Yates, under my supervision. In the Waikiki observations an attempt was made to determine simultaneously the variations of latitude and a correction to the constant of aberration. This involved the formation and solution of 2 370 conditional equations of the form z+x cos N + Ysin N +Ap= 6<p The result fully justified the method. The latitude curve agreed almost precisely with that found by an independent treatment according to the German method, and a very fair value was deducted for the correction p. The details of this work are given in the former part of this paper and in Bulletin No. 28, United States Coa!'lt and Geodetic Survey. In the San Francisco observations it was desirable to shorten the labor because here we have nearly 7 000 conditional equations. To apply the method of least squares for the purpose of determining four unknown quantities, to such a mass of data, would require great labor. The periodic variations of latitude were therefore accepted as already deduced by l\Ir. C . .A. Schott, and the conditional equations were formed containing only two unknown quantities, one of which was the correction to the aberration constant.

\Vhen the preceding values are compared with those resulting from observation the outstanding differences represent the combined effect of two independent quantities. One is the correction to reduce the mean declination of each pair of stars to the mean of all tile pairs, and the other a certain function of the quantity 20"·4451, which is the aberration constant and which appears as

366

a factor in two terms of the reduction from the mean to the apparent place of the stars. tabular values arc considered applicable for two days on each side of the date given. Each directly observed latitude will therefore furnish an equation of the form
C+Kx=Ll<p

The

where C is the correction to the mean declination of the pair, + a) sin o for both stars, x is minus one-half the factor by ·which the aberration constant used in the reductions must be multiplied in order to get the correction to this constant, and Ll<p is the difference between the observed value of the latitude and the mean latitude plus its periodic variation. Each pair will then give conditional equations of the form
K is the sum of h cos (H

This is the direct method. In practice, however, as Professor Newcomb suggested, each K was multiplied by .04, so as to make the general mean somewhat less ~ban unity, which procedure gave a value of x 25 times greater than its true value. The.value found from the normal equation is therefore to be divided by 25. In the solution by the above scheme the declination correction disappears, and we have finally 6 768 equations containing only x and known terms. A mean equation gives the value sought. The interpretation of the result is easily made by considering· the form of the conditional equations and the relation between the coefficient of x and the aberration constant. The quantity 20".4451 enters as a factor into the expression h cos (H +a) sin o + i cos 6, or in Bessel's notation into Cc' +Dd 1· This expression is added to the declination of each star in finding its apparent place, and the latitude comes from summing the declinations and dividing by two. Hence any change in the above factor affects the deduced latitude by only half as much, and since Llcp is equal to <p-<p0 , or to the observed latitude minus the mean latitude corrected for periodic variation, the effect on Ll<p is equal to its effect on <p and is of the same sign. Moreover, the sign of x must be opposite to the sign of the correction to 20".4451, since the term +Kx represents the excess of the Ll<p deduced with this value over that which would come from using the new value. In general if the value of x as used in the equations comes out +a, the correction to be applied to the constant of aberration is -1·64a, or the value of the aberration constant given by the observations is 20"·4451- 20"·4451 (~-a) (25) In forming the coefficients for determining x each group was taken up separately and the quantities were tabulated according to the following scheme where all numbers are given for the first pair of Group I:

These values weighted with the coefficients of x above give the same value, viz: Com;ta11t of aberration

= 20"·482.

PROBABLE ERROR.

The probable error of this result is estimated in tlte following way: The values of O, the corrections to the assumed declinations, were calculated for each pair through two represeutati\re groups. These values and the values of x substituted in all the conditional equations of the groups chosen gave residuals from which the mean error' of observation was calculated. The number of equations being represented by 11i and the number of unknown quantities determined being equal to µ, the mean error of observation is

In the present case the average value of e from the two groups involying 51 pairs and 2 013 observations was :I:: 0·389. The normal equations were then solved for each pair in order to get the weight of the unknown quantity x. These normal equations were

n 0 + [K]x=O [KJ C+[KK]x=l
from which x is equal to the reciprocal of t11e quantity

fK)Z [.K2J-··-n
This last written value is therefore the weight of x or .,tp-:, and the mean error of x from each pair would be found by dividing the mean error of observation by .,Ip,. An average value for the 51 pairs of the mean error of x from 1 pair gave (0·395). The probable error is therefore 0·67 45 x (0·395) =0·266. The value of x as derived from the conditional eq nation must be multiplied by 1·64 in order to get the correction to the aberration constant. Hence the probable error of this correction from one pair of stars may be taken as (·436) and the probable error of the result depending on 176 pairs would be
"

0·436 = ~·436 = 0·033 176 13·3

This is on the assumption that the average mean error for 51 pairs is the same as the average for 17G pairs, a supposition which seems to be justified, within reasonable limits, by the range of the values calculated. The constant of aberration from the San Francisco observations may then be given as
20" ·482 :I:: 0" ·033

This value used in connection with the velocity of light and the earth's radius given in the first part of the paper reduces tbe solar parallax to 8"·797 and increases the sun's distance to 92 931 000 miles; so that we would have, giving equal weights to the Honolulu and San Francisco observations, the following values from all the observations of the Coast and Geodetic l:)urvey:

Newcomb's value, 20"·463, is the mea.n of 24 miscellaneous results from different observatories. The sun's distance is derived from this and from the velocity of light, 299 860 km., and the earth's radius, 6 378·2 km., given on page 147. The difference between the extreme values for the sun's distance is much less than the probable error ascribed by Professor Harkness to his result (p. 140), and the Coast and Geodetic Survey value differs from the mean of all three by about 1 per cent of this probable error. We may repeat, in conclusion, that the observations which furnish the data. discussed in the preceding pages were made with an entirely different object in view. The deduction of the constant of aberration was an afterthought, and was not undertaken until the observations bad folly subserved the purpose for which they were originally and specifically made. That they should furnish such plausible values is a matter of satisfaction without, however, attributing undue importance to the close accord with standard work in this direction. Nevertheless, a new and independent determination of this quantity can not fail to be of value when we remember that one of the most aecurate means of findi11g· the sun's distance is by use of the aberration constant, which has been the subject of this paper.

COl\IPILATION OF THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION RELATIVE TO 'l'IlE HARBORS, ANCHORAGES, AND DANGERS TO NAVIGATION IN THE VICINI'l'Y OF CHATHAM AND PERIL STHAITS AND COOKS INLET, ALASKA.

Arranged and compiled i>y Lieut.

HUGI! HODMAN,

U. S. N., Assistant.

l'rl'fatory 11 otc.-Tho following iuformatiou is compiled from a survey made in the snmmcr of 18!)5 by tho Coast Survey stenmor I'atterBon in Clrntlrnm aml Poril straits, from Poiut Gardner to Killisnoo, thence through Peril Strait to Sorgim1 Narrows, and from tho notes of Prof. \V. II. Dall, U. S. Geological Survey, mndo ai>ont the same time, in Cooks Inlet arnl to tho westward. . It is very general in character, allll that which relates to Chatham and Poril Htrnits is preliminary to tho charts and 8ailing directions which will bo published, covering tho samo ground, in the near future. In tho territory around Cooks Inlet tho charts are for from correct, but they are compiled from the most roliable sources, audit is hoped that in time this part of Alaska may be accurately charted. The sailing directions 1iud notes arc taken from tho reports of Lieut. Commander E. IL Moor·', U. 8. N., 00111 · manding the Coast Sun·oy steamer J>atterB011, untl cover tho 1'rouud from Point Gardner, at the jnnctiou of Frc<lorick Sonnd an<l Chatham Strait, to Povorotni Island, in Peril Strait. These notes were corupilecl during the season of 1895, from l\lay to October, nnd arc a very valuable addition to the scant information already existing in print on this part of Alaska. This information has already been published as Bnlletiu No. 35.

On the eastern shore of Chatham Strait the mountains are not so abrupt or rugged as on the westem side. The tops are nearly all rounded and bare, with the exception of grass and light underbrush. Owing to the prevalence of s11ow slides, no general rule can be given for the height of the timber line. The rest of tlie country is covered with a heavy growth of cedar, fir, spruce, maple, alder, and blueberry ~ushes, greatly impeding travel. 'l'he highest peak on the eastern shore is between Cha-ilc and Whitewater bays, ;3 ~41 feet, and is an irregular, solitary mountain with two principal peaks. On the southern shore of ·whitewater Bay, and maki11g a prominent landmark. for it, is a mountain, 2 438 feet high, called Table Mountain, peculiarly eroded near the top. This is the only prominent peak between vVbitewater Bay and Point Gardner, the country being· composed of low, rolling hills, heavily timbered, lackiug individuality, and containing no prominent features. On the western shore, with the exception of the country between Point Thatcher and Point Lull, the country is much more rugged and broken, many of the peaks reacbing altitudes of 4 000 feet, and apparently increasing in height to the southward. These peaks are nearly all bare arnl rocky and covered with snow until late in the summer, some of them perpetually. A few remnants of glaciers can be seen in some of the upper gulches. 'l'he timber line proper is much lower here than on tlie eastern side, and above it the underbrush is also much lighter. This is due probal>ly to the later melting· of the snow a.nd the greater frequency of snow slides. Chatham Strait, i_n the main, is a clear, honest sheet of water, most of the dangers to navigation lying well inshore, and generally inside of a line drawn from point to point. On tho western shore from abreast Point Gardner to the southern point of Kelp Bay there are no outlying dangers, and the reefs in the small bights are nearly all visible at half tide. About two-thirds of a mile SE. ~ S. from Point Lull is a sunken rock, well marked by kelp, and from hem to Point

UNITED 8TATES COAST A.ND 1 GEODETIC SURVEY.

Thatcher the shore should not be approached within half a mile, as there are several reefs extending well offshore, and the bottom is very irregular aud foul. Although well marked by kelp, there may be some shoals undiscovered. Much of this kelp is attached to small rocks and bowlders, varying in size from a hen's egg to a brick, and under the influence of heavy seas or strong tidal currents a vessel is very liable to drag anchor. On the western shore are three prominent waterfalls which make exc~llent landmarks. The first is 4 miles below the southern point of Kelp Bay, very high, and visible for a considerable distance to the northward, appearing as a white line or streak against the dar1:r background of the hills. The second is a large but not particularly high waterfall at the head of Warm Spring Bay, which is visible from Chatham Strait for a short distance to the southward of the bay. The third is similar to the last in appearance, in an open bight which has received the local name of Cascade Bay. This waterfall is visible from vessels bound north in mid-channel up to a point onehalf mile to the northward of a line drawn from Point Gardner at right augles to the general direction of the channel. From Point Gardner to Point Wilson, the southern point of Wilson Cove, the shore is low, except in one place noted on the chart, with no reefs or dangers making off to any extent. Wilson Cove, 8 miles above Point Gardner, is an open, shallow bight, about 1 mile deep, with a width at its entrance of 2 miles. At its head is an extensive flat. On its southern shore are two small wooded islands, the inner one being much higher and more heavily wooded of the two. In the entrance is an extensive reef, generally visible, but covered at the spring high waters, extending across the mouth for a distance of half a mile. The southern shore is very foul and rocky, and full of kelp, much of it being secured to sinall rocks and bowlders. On tlle northern shore are several caverns in the faces of tlle cliffs, which are from 75 to 100 feet in height. Wilson Cove should be avoided, as it affords no protection as an anchorage except from easterly winds, and is very foul, bottom showing in 4 or 5 fathoms iu many places. Point Caution, 14 miles above Point Gardner, and 5 miles above WilRon Cove, is the southern point of Whitewater Bay. Two and one-half miles south of it a shoal extends offshore one-third of a mile from a small wooded islet connected with the shore at low water. Otherwise the shore is free from dangers between Point Caution and Wilson Cove. Directly bellind Point Caution is the mountain previously referred to as marking the entrance to °?17 ltitewater Bay. One-sixth of a mile NW. from Point Caution is a low, rocky islet, bearing a single dead tree, from which it derives the name of Lone Tree Island. One and three-quarter miles N. 2- W. from Point Caution is Woody Point, with a sma11 rocky, wooded islet, one-third of a mile offshore. This is the northern point of Whitewater Bay. Whitewater Bay extends in an easterly direction for a distance of 3 miles, terminating at its head in sand and gravel flats, and at high water connecting by a narrow passage with a lagoon about 1 mile in length by one-half mile in width, bare at low water. One and one-quarter miles from Point Caution, nearly in the middle, but a little nearer the southern shore, is Healy Rock, low and bare, surrounded by rocky ledges of small extent, marked hy kelp. On the northern shore, 1 mile SE. from Woody Point, is the Indian village of N eltushkin, arnl from the point immediately to the westward of the village a rocky ledge extends one-half mile in a SW. by W. direction, with a sunken rock one-quarter of a mile to tlle eastward of its seaward end, both well marked by kelp. In other particulars the description of this bay as g-iven in the Pacific Coast Pilot, Alaska, Part I, is very good. From the rocky islet off Woody Point, distant seven-eighths of a mile NW. by N., is Hussian Reef. The position of this reef on the published charts is erroneous, as it has been placed much too far from shore, while in reality it is nearly on range between Point Caution and Distant Point. This reef extends three-quarters of a mile in a general WN\V. direction, showing partially at low. water, aud is well marked by kelp. These rocks rise very abruptly from Yery deep water. From vVoody Point 2~ miles NE. ~ E. is Hocky Point, the shore between being considerably indented by small open bights, with ledges extending well offshore at low water. There are also two small islands in this stret-0h, one close inshore, 1 mile S. 2- E. from H.ocky Point, and the other one-half mile S. ~ E. from lfocky Point. From the latter island a rock, showing at half tide, lies NW., distant one-third mile. A larger island, distant 1 mile W. by N. from Rocky Point, has also a

ledge, distant one-quarter mile NW. by W., showing at about half tide. This island and the white cliffs 2i miles south of Distant point mark the entrance to a bay known by the Indians as Cha-ik, of which Village and Rocky points are the north and south points respectively. In a shallow big·ht, just inside Village Point, is an Indian village, off which, distant one-half mile SE. by E., is an extensive ledge surrounding a small, low, bare, rocky island, 'and with a narrow channel uetween it and the shore.· This bay is about miles in length, and opens into au extensive fiat at its head. Ou the north shore, 2 miles from Village Point, is a bight 1 mile in length, in which is the anchorage. A low, wooded island, with a rock visible at half tide and distant 300 yards in a Sv\T, direction from it, marks the southern point of the bight. In the middle of the bay, 1! miles E. by N. from the rock off the Indian village; is a low, wooded island with extensive ledges on the seaward side, and some detached rocks showing at low water on the inshore end. Between this·island, and a little nearer the southern shore, are two rocks, connected at low water. Beyond the island and these . rocks, toward the head of the bay, the bottom is very irregular, and visible in many places at a depth of 4 to 5 fathoms, and there is also au abundance of kelp. There are several .small islands and rocks near the head of the bay, and vessels are recommended to avoid passing beyond the island off the southern point of the anchorage, the island in the center, and the two rocks near the southern shore. In the inlet on the northern shore excellent holding ground in 12 fathoms, sticky bottom, may be had, and, although open to the southwest, it affords good protection from all other directions, and it is doubtful if it would blow home in southeasterly weather, tlle only wind which conld draw in. Distant Point is miles NNW. W. from Village Point and .miles SE. from Point Samuel. It marks tlle southern point of Hootz Bay, ancl directly bellind it are two hills which lie between Cba-ik, and Hootz bays. The lower and more northern one lies directly behind the point, and from some points of view appears as a double peak of about 1 000 feet elevation. The larger mountain is about 2 200 feet in height, and is a single mountain rounded on top. Two aud a half miles to thA southward of ~istant Point a spur of this mountain runs toward the water, and -terminates abruptly in a whitish cliff 800 feet high, wliich has been previously referred to. Kenasnow Island is low, and at its western end is about 300 feet lligh and heavily wooded. l\Iuch of the timber on the eastern end l!as been 'logged. Killisuoo, the location of the Alaska Oil aud Guano Company, and the United States post-office, is situated on tlie nortllern and eastern end. Point Samuel is the western point of the island and the northern point of Hootz Bay. From the entrance, Ilootz Bay is about 11 miles long to the llead of the southern arm, and about 10 miles to the head of the northern arm. In the entrance are numerous rocks and reefs, those visible lying close to the eastern sllore and parallel to it for a distance of 2 miles, with a clear but narrow channel between them and the shore. Five-eightlls of a mile N. E. from Distant Point, and fully one-third of a mile offshore, is a sunken rock well marked by kelp, and care should be taken in rounding tllis point, either in entering or leaving, to give it a good berth. Five miles inside on the northern shore is a low, wooded peninsula, oft' which, iu mid-channel, are three rocks showing at low water. Two are comparatively small and close together, and about 300 yards nearer the entrance than the larger one, which covers at nearly llig·h water. The bight to the northward of the peninsula is small and full of rocks and reefs. Several houses and sllacks are located here. In proceeding up the bay the channel lies between the rocks and the southern shore. One and one-quarter miles farther in on the .northern shore, and distant offshore some 300 yards, are two rocks, visible at low water. One-half mile beyond, tlle bay divides in two armH, a small, bare, rocky island lying about 200 yards off the dividing })Oint. A ledgA, connected with the shore at low water, makes oft' for a short distance from a point just inside the north arm on its northern shore, but otherwise this arm is clear and affords n.n aucllorage in 15 to 20 fathoms, soft bottom, at its head. The southern arm is also free from dn.ngers, and gives au anchorage at its head in 15 to 20 fathoms, soft bottom. Table Island, low and sandy, with ext:ensive reefs bare at low water, lies three-eighths of a mile south of Keuasnow Island. A clear channel is between it and Kenasnow Island, leading to tlie anchorage off Killisnoo. The ledges off the southeastern point of Kenasuow Island are marked by a beacon, and Lone Hock, Yisible nt half-tide, is marked by a second-class nun buoy, paiuted red.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Sand Island, 1 mile E. by S. from Table Island, is the northern point of the reefs and ledges extending along the eastern shore previously referred to. Between it and Table Island is a clear channel with 7 fathoms, lea.ding to the anchorage off Killisnoo. The directions in the published sailing directions call for no changes, except as regards the buoy on Lone Rock. From Point Gardner to Point Samuel the eastern shore of Chatham Strait is remarkable for many tide rips. On a calm night the noise of them is heard distinctly at a distance of a mile. These tide rips occur off nearly all the points and reefs, being particularly noticeable in the vicinity of Cha-ik Bay, Russian Heef, Point Caution, the reef in the en trance to w·ilson Cove, aud the point to the southward. They frequently l'xtend a mile offshore, and at spring tides show much broken, white water. On the western shore of Chatham Strait between Point Thatcher and Point Lull there are no prominent indentations. Between Point Lull and South Point is Kelp Bay, which consists of a basin Jrom which extend in different directions three arms. The northern one begins 3~ miles from Point Lull, and runs in a westerly direction for 3~ miles. At its head is an extensive flat that runs through, and at high water, spring tides, connects with a similar flat in Hanns Bay, in Peril Strait. At the highest tides there are probably from ;{ to 4 feet of water on this flat, judging from the height of the seaweed and driftwood, but on the ordinat·y high waters there are but a few inches. At low water, from tl.ie head of this arm to Hanus Bay is a distance of lJl miles. Considerable logging has been done uear the head, a large amount of cedar having been cut and rafted during this season. A short distance inside the entrance, close to the northern shore and connected with it at low water, is a small, low, wooded isl.and. One and one-quarter miles farther in is another wooded island connected with the northern shore at low water, with several bare rocks close to its eastern end. Abreast this island on the southern shore a ledge makes off some 300 yards. Otherwise there is a clear channel to the head. An anchora·ge is not recommended in this arm, except for small craft that will firnl fair holding ground in from 8 to 10 fathoms. Scant swinging room will prevent its use by large vessels. Off the point, separating this arm from the next one to the southward, ledges visible at low water extend 150 yards .. This arm is clear from its entrance to its head, where it opens out into a moderate-sized flat. It is about 5 miles in length, and curves slightly toward the southward. 'l\7"ith the exception of a shallow open bight, about 12- miles i11side on the southern shore, containing an extensive sand flat, this arm is devoid of any particular feature of interest. It affords a good anchorage near the head in from 12 to 18 fathoms, soft bottom. The southern arm extends 32- miles in a southerly direction, curving slightly to the southeastward. Two hundred yards off its eastern point is a ,o.;unken rock marked by kelp, clear of a midchannel course, although the western shore should be slightly favored in entering.. On the eastern shore, one-half mile from the entrance, are several small, wooded islets, connected with the shore at low water. A small open bight is one-half mile beyond them on the eastern shore. Abreast the islands and on the northern shore are several landslides on the face of a steep bill which shows plainly from Chatham Strait. Two miles from the head a point extending from the northern shore constricts the channel to a width of less than a quarter of a mile, beyond which it expands to a width of two-thirds of a mile, terminating at its head in extensive flats. The anchorage is at the bead in 10 to 15 fathoms, soft bottom. Five· hundred yards SE.~ E. from Portage Poi11t is a sunken rock. One mile S. by \V. from Portage Point is Plover Rock, small, but prominent, bare, with ledges of small extent. ~ear it are two rocks covered at one-third tide. The first is distant 200 yards ENE. ~ E., and the second is distant 750 yards S. by E. 2- E. from Plover Hock .. From the southern point of the south arm to South Point the shore forms a bight 1~ miles deep and 3~ miles wide from point to point. Across the eutrauce of this bight, and affordiug protection as an anchorage, extend several islands, the largest one lying close to shore near South Point, and a group of three lying off its western end, with a narrow channel between. These islands are all low and wooded, the large oue containing two small lakes. Opposite the entrance to this narrow channel, on the north shore 2 miles from Point Lull, is a prominent whitish cliff, 800 feet high. Several sunken rocks were found in this channel. Three-quarters of a mile from North Point, NW. by W. ! W., is a sunken rock with a 4-fathom shoal between it and the point. The shores of Kelp Bay are very abrupt and steep, and the northern shore is practically

straight. From Point Caution, in Chatham Strait, a line down through the portage in the northern arm passes nearly through Broad Island, in Peril Strait, and the head of Hooniah Sound, a clear line 55 miles in length. Immediately to the westward of Point I1ull is a narrow bight extending in a northwesterly direction for three-quarters of a mile. This is full of kelp, open to the southward, and affords temporary shelter for small craft only. Between Pond Island and the south shore is a narrow ·passage full of rocks and kelp. This is navigable by small boats, but should not be attempted by large vessels. One and one-half miles to the southward of South Point a narrow inlet extends for 11 miles to the westward. A small, rocky, wooded islet lies close to its northern point, connecting at low tide. Two hundred yards southeast is a bare rock with a ledge extending 150 yards to the southward. The entrance to the big·ht is from the southward, and it aft'ords good shelter for small vessels, but is too narrow to give swinging room for vessels of any size. For a distance of a mile below this bight the shore is straight, but from there to Ta-Katz Bay, a distance of 4 miles, the shore is much broken by bights, with several wooded islands and bare rocks lying close to shore. The cliffs are very precipitous, and several large waterfalls were noticed, one of which is very prominent and has been reforred to as one of the landmarks in this vicinity. Ta-Katz Bay extends in a westerly uirection, curving slightly to the southward for 2 miles, and then turns abruptly to the northward for another mile, terminating in a flat formed by a mountain stream emptying into it as a waterfall. This stream is evidently fed by a glacier, as the low water on ebb tide is milky at the entrance of the bay. Point Turbot is the northern point, off which, at a distance of 75 yards, is a large white rock. SK 1 S. from this rock, distant 250 yards, is a rock, bare at half tide. Off the southern point of the hay are four bare rocks, whitish in appearance all(l about 25 feet above water. On a line from l'oint Turbot to the southern point are two of them close together and distant from the southern point 300 yards, with reefs between them and the point, showing at low water. The other two rocks are 600 yards to the westward. 'rhe southern sbore of the bay is formed by a peninsula, which also forms the northern shore of a bight to the southward, with a group of small islands in its entrance. This bight does not appear to afford either shelter or an anchorage, the water being deep and kelp fairly abundant. Off the southern point of the bight, and to the southward of 'the group of islands, is a rock, bare at low water, 400 yards from shore. Ta-Katz Bay affords a good anchorage in 20 fathom11, soft bottom, in the ba~in that opens out just before the turn to the northward. Chatham Strait is shut ont entirely from the anchorage by the southerly curve of the bay, anu the high surrounding hills give complete protection from all winds. Warm Spring Ba~r, 4 miles below Point.Turbot, is the northern point of a small bay 2 miles in length, extending to the westward. At its 011trauce the bay is nearly a mile wide, but the channel is narrowed to a half mile by a peninsula projectiug from the northern shore. Nearly halfway between the two entrance pointR, and one-quarter of a mile off the eastern point of the peninsula, is a small bare rock about 15 feet above wa.ter. On the southern shore are two small bights, and at the head of the bay a small lagoon to the left of the waterfall previously spoken of. This waterfall ii,, the outlet of a lake several miles long, about ~00 feet above sea level. Near this waterfall, and at some considerable height above it, are several warm mineral springs, frequented by Indians on ac1~ou11t of their medicinal properties. This bay affords an anchorage in 25 fathoms, rocky bottom, beyond the peninsula and abreast the second bight on the southern shol'e. While affording fair shelter from northerly winds, in southerly weather the wiud and sea draw in around the southern point. '!'his, coupled with rather poor holding ground and dC'ep water, renders it undesirable as an anchorage in bad weather. Between this bay and a point opposite Point Gardner are two open bights, both unsuited for anchorages. The southern one is called Casca<le Bay, from the· very promment waterfall at its head. The hand lead is of little use to navigators in these waters in thick weather, 20 and 30 fathoms being frequently found within a fow yards of the shore line, while a quarter of a mile from the beach depths of JOO to 200 fathomR are not nt all unusual.

378

UNITED .STA.TES COAST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

One almost universal feature which exists in these waters is the occurrence of sand and gravel flats, with one or more small streams at the head of all bights and inlets. The slope, from 8 to 10 fathoms to a few feet, is very abrupt, aud in approaching the head of an inlet at high water care should be exercised in anchoring to give t;he tlats sufficient berth to avoid grounding at low water. Nearly all afford good holding ground, in soft or sticky bottom, within a short distance of the head.
HOOTZN.AHOO INLE1'.

Hootznahoo Inlet, comprising an area of about 15 square miles, is a group of lagoons and bays on the eastern shore of Chatham Strait, 2~ miles above Killisnoo. It consists of five prin· cipal divisions, full of rocks, reefs, and shoals, connected by narrow channels through which the tide flows with great force, attaining at times a velocity of from 10 to 12 knots per hour. The entrance to these lagoons is between Danger Point and Hootznahoo Head, and from the entrance the Inlet extends in a general easterly direction for 3~ miles, where it opens out into a small bay, called "Favorite Bay" by the Alaska Oil and Guano Company, who use it considerably as a fishing ground for herring. One and one-half miles from the entrance, on the nortb shore, and extending to the northward, are two arms, the western one being almost straight, with the exception of a small bight on its western shore, and connecting with Mitchell Bay. The eastern arm joins the western at Point Pillsbury, above the end of Long Island, which lies between the arms. On the eastern shore of this arm is a small passage opening into a lagoon that at high water. connects by a passage at its southeast end with Favorite Bay. At its northern end it connects by a narrow passage with a lagoon opening into Mitchell Bay. Mitchell Bay, the largest of the divisions of this inlet, is about 4rr miles in length by an average width of 1~ miles. At its southwest end it is connected with a lagoon so full of rocks, reefs, and shallow water that soundings were considered unnecessary. At its southeast end it is connected by Davis Creek to Kanalkoo Bay and Lighter Creek. At its northeri1 eud it is connected by a lagoon, impassable except at high water by small boats, which is said to connect with a series of lakes in the interior of Admiralty Island. It is impossible to give more than a general description of this mixed-up mass of islands, rocks, and water, as a much better idea can be obtained from the charts. The general character of the country is low and rather heavily wooded, except where otherwise noted, and the absence of prominent features renders it impossible to give ranges that would · be of much service to the navigator. The names have been taken from the description of this place written by Captain Meade, U. S. N., who navigated these channels in 1869 in the U. S. S. Saginaw, and his description is apparently very full and complete. At the present time there seems to be little to induce a vessel to enter these waters. The indications of coal, or, more properly, lignite, are numerous, but the mines have not been worked for a number of yea.rs, and any subsequent development of tllem would not depend upon these waters as a means of disposing of their output, since a short railway system of a few miles would lead directly to Chatham Strait abreast of Killisnoo.
SAILING- DIREOTIONS FOR HOOTZNAHOO INLE1'.

On the north side of Danger Point is the narrow entrance to an extensive system of inlets and lagoons, called by the Indians "Hootznahoo." The entrance is about one-half of a mile wide, gradually narrowing, but free from obstructions, until Village Hock is reached. This is a large low-water ledge making out from an Indian village on the south shore toward Turn Point on the north shore. This ledge obstructs more than one-half the channel, and the strength of the tide causes a very strong current, runl!ing at times probably as high as 8 knots, with large swirls where the curre~t impinges upon the larger and slower moving body of water. Beyond Village Hock, to the eastward, the channel is clear on the south side well in toward the shore line, but on the north side it is obstructed by a ledge marked by kelp at slack water making out from Turn Point, terminating in a large round-top rock, which covers at high water anu upon which a spindle has been placed by the Alaska Oil and Guano Company.

One-quarter of a mile beyond this rock begins a series of rocks, uncovered at low water, extending to the unbroken shore line on the south side of the channel leading into Favorite Bay, in a line with this shore, the spindle, and Turn Point. At the spindle rock the channel branches in three directions. One branch continues to the eastward past Sullivans 1 Point, which has been prospected for coa1, and leads into Favorite Bay, a large lagoon filled with herring during the season. The other two go to the northward and eastward on either side of a largo wooded island. The eastern of these passages is obstructed at the south end except for small boats, and at the north end of the island divides, one branch reuniting at Point Pillsbury with the main passage leading into Mitchell Bay, the other going through a very narrow channel into a large lagoon full of rocks and reefs, and unnavigable except for small craft. This lagoon is connected at its southeast corner by a high-water passage with Favorite Bay, and on its northeast side past a series of islands and broken reefs with Mitchell Bay. From the spindle on Rose Hock the westernmost branch turns sharply to the westward along the reef making out from Turn Point, thence to the northward and eastward for 5 miles, when it opens into Mitchell Bay. One and one-quarter miles above Turn Poillt this channel runs between a ledge of rock making off to the southward from Point Pillsbury and a round, bluff, high-water island; thence for one-half mi1e between reefs to Point Bridge, where it runs between a reef on the west side and a bold bank on the east side into a narrow channel with steep bold shores on either ·hand. Three-quarters of a mile above Point Bridge the channel broadens to a width of one-quarter mile until near the entrance to Mitchell Bay, when it is again confined between a ledge making off to the southward from North Point and a system of high-water islands to the eastward. Beyond North Point is Mitchell Bay, which extends to the northward and eastward a distance of 4~ miles, with a width. of li miles at its south side to narrow channels at the north, and loading over rapids into a system of lagoons fed by a large stream, said to have its source in lakes near the middle of the island. At the southeast angle of this bay is a narrow passage called· Davis Creek, which, after running in a southeast direction through a very foul channe1, turns back upon itself a11d widens into a clear open basiu, called Kanalkoo Bay, at the head of which are two large streams. One-half mile from the north end of Davis Oreek, Lighter Creek makes off, having from 2i fathoms to 5 fathoms of water at high tide. The south shore of Mitchell Bay is very foul, and while there is an ebb and flow of tide from Hootznahoo Head to Mitchell Bay, to the eastward of the main passage there is no channel for any sort of craft larger than rowboats and canoes. Near the west side of Mitchell Bay and 1! miles from the entrance to Diamond Island is a long narrow island, sparsely wooded, with a large timber fall. To the eastward of this island, and in a line parallel with the south shore of the bay, are two islands, one, a small, round, high-water island, without timber, the other larger and covered with a dense growth of timber. To tho northward of these islands there is a larger island with a confined channel to the west of it. At the entrance to Davis Creek is a high-water island, called by Captain Meade "Passage Islet." A large stream empties into Davis Creek at its north end, near which, in Mitchell Bay, a good anchorage may be bad in from 10 to 20 fathoms of' water. The tides in this system of lagoons continue to run from one. hour to one and one-half hours after the change at Hootznahoo bead, or oven longer. Slack water will be found at Village lfock, in the narrows, at Points Pillsbury and Bridge, at North Point, and at the south entrance to the middle lagoon, from one hour to one and one-half hours after the change of tide nt Hootznahoo Head. Slack water at the uorth end of Davis Oreek occurs half an hour after high or low water in Mitchell Bay. Vessels rounding Rose Rock at slack water would carry slack water all the way to Mitchell Bay. At Village Rock the currents run from 5 to 8 knots; at Point Bridge as high as 10 knots, and at Passage Islet as high as 7 knots. Coal has been found in small quantities about the entrance to Davis and Lighter creeks, at the southeast corner of Kanalkoo Bay, and in the middle lagoon. Several abandoned tunnels and shafts appear about Davis and Lighter creek~.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
PERU, STR.A.IT.

Peril Strait is one of the most important waterways in southeastern .Alaska, rivaling Wrangell Narrows in the amount of its commerce, and is the only connection between the inland channels and Sitka. It is used by small sloops and schooners, by small steamers employed in the interest of various canneries, sawmills, aml mines, by the regular mail steamers throughout the year, and tluring this last season by two steamers running in opposition to the Pacific Coast Steamship Company from Puget Sound to these waters. .An excellent reconnaissance of the narrows from Suloia Bay to Pogibshi Point, including also tbe steamer track from that point to Broad Island, was made by tlle officers of the U. S. S. Adarns, under Commander J. B. Ooglan, United States Navy, in 1884, aud but few changes were found by the present survey. The north shore of Peril Strait from Point Craven to the head of the northern arm of Hooniah Sound is steep and bold, and after passing Lindenberg Head is practically a straight line, with no dangers except an occasional 1lat of small extent making off the mouth of a stream. The shore can bo approached with safety to within a quarter of a mile. The mountains are covered with a moderate growth of timber and underbrush, their tops being generally bare aud rocky except where noted on the sheet. · .l\fcCiellan Rock, marked by a spindle immediately off Lindenberg Head and a sunken rock off a small open IJight 2 miles to tho eastward of Lindeuberg Head, are the only dangers from this point to Point Craven. The principal landmarks in Peril Strait are Fairway Island, in the eastern entrance; Lindenberg Head; the point at which Peril Strait changes direction; a series of bare, rocky hills and cliffs 2~ miles above Lindenberg Head, and Broad Island, lying three-quarters of a mile oft' the northern shore at the western eud of the strait. Several landslides will be referred to later. The southern shore of Peril Strait is much indented by small bights, coves, and inlets, and although the mountains back of the shore Hue are in many instances bigber than those of the northern side, the slopes are generally loss abrupt. Point Craven is the western point of a narrow inlet known as Sitkolt Bay, about 6~ miles in length, that extends in a general northerly direction. The point consists of an outlying rock about 10 feet in height, with a larger and higher rock nearly halfway between it and the ishorc, connected by ledges showing at Jow water. .A small steep bluff is on the rounded point of the shore behind the rocks. Deep water can be carried close up to these rocks. The eastern point of Sitkoh Bay is Point Hayes, distant from Point Craven li miles X. by E. !I E., and bearing SSE. 2- E., distant 1~ miles, from Peninsular Point, in Chatham Strait. This portion of the shore is extremely foul and dangerous, the bottom is irregular, and kelp is particularly thick. From Point Hayes, extending toward Point Craven across tho mouth of Sitkoh Bay for a distance of half a mile, are numerous reefs and ledges, some of which are visible at low water only. Two small islands and a rock lie a short distance off the point. A first-class can buoy, painted black, is moored 1~ miles NE. by E. rr E. from Point Craven and 2~ miles N. by W. i W. from Point Thatcher. Between t~is and Point Hayes is very foul and dangerous grou1Hl, and no vessel should attempt to pass to the north ward of the buoy under any circumstances. On line between the buoy and Peninsular Point is an extensive reef, usually well marked by kelp, which shows partially at low water and runs iu a generally northern direction. .A line from the outer rock of Point Craven drawn through the small bare rock off Point Hayes passes nearly through the centre of this ledge. To avoid this ledge, in entering Chatham Strait from Peril Strait, with the buoy close aboard, a NE. rr E. course should be held until the prominent white rock to the northward of Peninsular Point is well open before hauling to the northward. Sitkoh Bay for the first 2 miles is about 1 mile in width, though the channel at the entrance is constricted to balf that distance by the ledges and reefs making off to tbe westward from Point Hayes. Two miles above Point Hayes, from the eastern shore, projects a low, heavily wooded point, which forms a bight, affording an anchorage in 20 fathoms, hard bottom, and excellent protection from the northerly gales, which are the severe winter winds. Behind the point is a small lagoon, bare at low water. Extending to the southward from the point is a reef about 200 yards in length, visible at low water. By favoring the Point Craven shore for a distance of a mile, and th~n beading for the middle of' the bight, all danger will

REPORT FOR 1896-PAU'l' II

381

be avoided. Beyond this point the bay is but one-third of a mile wide for a distan~e of 42- miles, the Jast mile of which is bare at low tide. Seven-eighths of a mile above the point a reef extends into the channel for a distance of 300 yards from the eastern shore, with a small sand flat, and an Indian house on the western shore a little farther in. .A. mid-channel course clears both the reef and the flat, and should be held for If miles farther, when the eastern shore should be favored to avoid an extensive flat making out from the western shore. This flat is well marked by a low mound 100 yards off the western shore, covered by stunted trees and bushes. .A. small stream empties just to the northward of this mound. The anchorage is one-half mile beyond this mound, in 15 fathoms, soft bottom. .A. small cove, with low sandy shores, 3~ miles NE. f E. from Point Craven, does not afford good anchorage, and this fact, coupled with the sunken rock off its entrance, recommends that it be not used. Lindenberg Harbor, 52- miles SW.! W. from Point Oraven, is formed by tl1e projection of a point with a knoll 250 feet in height, on which is an extensive windfall. The harbor is protected from the northward and eastward, but is rather small, with indifferent holding ground. It bas been used considerably in northerly weather by the regular steameri:;, but apparently on account of lack of information regarding Sitkoh Bay. McOlellan Rock, marked by a spindle, is 350 yards oft' the point toward mid-channel. This rock bares for considerable area at low water. There is a narrow passage between it and the point, with from 5 to 7 fathoms, but nothing is gained by its use. These constitute the only anchorages on the northern shore of Peril Strait. Point Thatcher, the southern entrance point to Peril Strait, is a low, heavily wooded point, terminating in three bare rocks, the inboard one connected with the shore. These rocks extend toward Point Craven, and a rock, bare at low water, surrounded by kelp, lies 100 yards N. i E. from the outer one. The Coleman Reef, described in the sailing directions as extending 1 mile northeast from Point '.I.'hatcher, with a width of one-quarter of a mile, apparently has no existence. One and one-third miles west from Point Thatcher are Traders Islands, connected at low water, low and heavily wooded. One and one-half miles NW. i W. from Point Thatcher is Midway Reef, visible except at high water, and extending 750 yards in a general northwesterly direction. Fairway Island, the prominent landmark for leaving or entering· Peril Strait, lies 2 miles WNW. 2- W. from Point Thatcher and lt miles SSE. from Point Craven. It is about 320 feet high, much rounded, and covered with a thick growth of trees. From Point Thatcher to the eastern point of' Hanus Bay the shore must be avoided by all large vessels. The bottom is very irregular, and there are numerous rocks and reefs, some of which show only at '3xtreme low water, while the sunken rocks are but poorly indicated by k13lp. Three-quarters of a mile SW. by W. ! W. from Fairway Island is a sunken rock marked by kelp. Two and one-half miles SW. 2- W', of Fairway Island and one-half mile WSW. t W. from a small rocky islet with but few trees on it, lies a sunken rock nearly one-half mile off the southern shore. This is a pinnacle rock, and but one or two pieces of kelp marked its location at the time of its discovery .. Small craft with local knowledge may find temporary shelter close inshore, but no anchorages are recommended. A course midway betweeu Point Craven and Fairway Island laid to pass the spindle off Lindenberg Head five-eighths of a mile to the southward clears all dangers, and requires but one change for continuing up Peril Strait to Broad Island. Hanus Bay, 6 miles from Point Thatcher on the soutbern shore, abreast of Lindenberg Head on the northern shore, is a broad, open bight, 22- miles in width by ll miles in depth. At its western end are two coves, the southern one nearly bare at low water, into which empties a small stream, the Olltlet of a small, narrow lake. This is quite a fishing station of the Indians during the summer months, when large quantities of salmon and trout are prepared and dried for the winter supply of food. The other cove, about one-half mile in depth, affords au anchorage for small craft. Two ledges, bare at low tide, lie off the points of these coves at a distance of about 80 yards, the outer oue lying· a little inside of the outer point. 1n the southeastern comer of Hanns Bay are two low, wooded islands, connected at low water with reefs aud sand tlats extending oft' their western eud for about 200 yards. Tim eastem island has a htrge amount of standing <lend timber, which attracts attention at a considerable distance. A shallow pocket behind these islands, with a ledge showing at half tide, connects at high water with the north arm of Kelp Bay. Four miles

UNITED STA.TES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

farther to the westward on the southern shore is a small bay, known by the Indians as Sa-ook, 3 miles in length by about one-half mile in width, that affords the best anchorage between Fairway and Broad islands, especially in southeasterly weather. Its right entrance is marked by· a point on which is a conspicuous windfall, and off this point, in Peril Strait, is a rock about 80 yards from shore 4 feet out of water at high tide. The left entrance is low and wooded. On the eastern shore of the inlet, three-quarters of a mile from the entrance, is a low, wooded island with a small reef on the channel side, distant 20 yards and generally visible. This is the firRt of a small group of islands and rocks which extend from it to a low, green, grassy knoll three eighths of a mile beyond. On the west side, 1~ miles from the entrance, is a prominent ravine opening into an amphitheater in the surrounding bills. From it comes a small stream that makes a very extensive sand and gravel bar. This bar is much larger than would ordinarily be expected, and extends fully halfway across the inlet. Beyond it there are no obstructions until the fiats at the head are reached, 1 mile beyond the ravine. .A good-sized stream, poted for large numbers of trout, empties at the head. The anchorage is five-eighths of a mile beyond the bar, in the middle of the inlet, in 18 to 22 fathoms, soft green mud. Excellent water can be obtained from any of the numerous small streams that come in on each side of the anchorage, preferably at high water, when a better approach to them can be bad. Peril Strait is entirely hidden from the anchorage. Four and one-half miles farther, on the south shore, is the entrance to an inlet, Rodman Bay, which extends to tlte southward for 6 miles. Its western point is high and well wooded, with reefs extending offshore for about 100 yards. The eastern point is low, and between it and a small cove on the eastern shore are several rocks, bare at low water, but not generally visible. This inlet is miles from Broad Island and 8 miles from Lindenberg Head. At the entrance it is about 2 miles wide, but contracts in miles to five-eighths of a mile, a small wooded island lying off the eastern side, where it narrows. The soundings in the entrance are very irregular, and although no dangers were found care should be taken in entering. On the eastern shore, close to the entrance, is a small cove with an island in the middle of the entrance connected with the southern point by a sand spit covered at high water. The channel for entering is on the north side of the island. The cove has rockR and shoals, and affords an anchorage to small craft only. .A stream empties at its head with very extreme fiats. On the western shore of the inlet, 2 miles from the entrance, a shoal ext.ends offahore for about 125 yards, but otherwise the channel is clear to the head, where extensive sand and gravel flats make off from the southwest corner. On the eastern side, near the head, are two islands, connected at low water, and just beyond them, with a point on the eastern shore showing between, a good anchorage may be had in 10 to 12 fathoms, soft bottom. .A large stream coming from the eastward through a narrow valley empties in this corner of the bead with extensive sand and gravel fiats. Two miles west of Rodman Bay is Pestchani Point, low and wooded, on the eastern side of which a mountain stream empties, forming a very large sand and gravel bar. This flat extends into the channel for over a quarter of a mile, from one-half of a mile to the westward of the point to below the mouth of' the stream. A close approach to the point should be avoided. Threequarters of a mile west of Pestchani Point is Nismeni Point, low, covered with a thin growth of trees, bare and rocky at its seaboard end. Off this point are two ledges, bare at low water only, with a sunken rock halfway between them and the point. The first is distant 600 yards NE. E. and the second is distant 800 yards NE. E. from the point. To the eastward of the point is Nismeni Oove, about three-quarters of a mile in depth by less tha.n one-half of a mile at its entrance. . This gives shelter from southerly winds, the holding ground in the middle of the cove being fair in 18 to 22 fathoms. The course for entering lies toward the eastern point t-0 avoid the ledges off Nismeni Point. This bight affords no shelter from northerly winds. Beyond Nismeni Point and Broad Island, Peril Strait opens out into a considerably wider body of water, extending 7 miles t-0 the southward to Point Pogibshi, the northern entrance to the narrows, and on its western side opening into three bays, the two northern ones being the most extensive and constituting Hooniah Sound. To the southward about miles, on the western shore, the third bay extends in a curve to the southward for 4 miles. Poison Cove, near Point Pogibshi, is the only other indentation on this shore. From Nismeni Point to Point Pogibshi the shore bends in a gentle curve to the southward,

the low-water line extending some considerable distance offshore. Several anchorages may be bad along this shore, the best being near Point Pogibshi off the entrance of a small lagoon in a small grassy flat, in 22 fathoms, sandy bottom. .A close approach to the shore should be avoided in anchoring, as an extensive sand and gravel bar makes out well into the bight. One mile SW. by W. 2- W. from Nismeni Point is Otstoia Island, low and thickly wooded, and connected at low water with two bare rocks lying off its southwestern end. A sand and gravel bar, formed by mountain streams, makes off from the shore toward Otstoia Island, constricting the channel to a width of one-eighth of a mile. The outer point of the fiat is marked by a secondclass red can buoy, anchored in 8 fathoms. A clear channel, carrying 4 to 10 fathoms, generally used by the steamers, lies between the buoy and Otstoia Island, and a straight course from the buoy to Poverotni Island clears all dangers. Three-quarters of a mile W. i S. from Nismeni Point is the seaward end of Cozian Reef, a sunken ledge extending off Otstoia Island for nearly one-half miie. Its outer end is marked by a second-class can buoy, painted black. One-half mile SW. by W. f W. from Nismeni Point, and lying 150 yards offshore, is a sunken rock poorly marked by kelp. Five-eighths of a mile W. by S. from the southern end of Otstoia Island are Krugloi and Elevoi islands, connected at low water. These islands are small, low, and wooded. Between them and Otstoia Island is a clear channel with from 12 to 25 fathoms, which is apparently a better one than that between Otstoia Island and the shore, as it avoids Oozian Reef and the sunken rock between it and the shore. One and one-half miles froDJ Krugloi Island and nearly on range between it and the northern point of Ushk Bay is a reef nearly 150 yards long, baring only at spring low water. A little inshore, but nearly on range between Point Emmons and the north point of Poison Oove, is a reef of about the same extent as the last, distant 2~ miles S.1 E. from Point Emmons and 22- miles SW. 2- W. from Krugloi Island. It is seven-eighths of a mile NE. f N. from the southern point of the Ushk Bay, and bares at low water only. One and one-half miles SW. f S. of Krugloi Island and 2~ miles N. from Poverotni Island is the center of a group of reefs, with shallow water between, covering an area of one-half mile square. The largest of these is about 300 yards long by from 50 to 100 yards in width, composed of' sand, gravel, and bowlders. This covers only at the highest spring tides. Four hnndred yards to the southward of this are two low rocks, covered at ordinary high water. To the westward of the sandy island about one-quarter of a mile are three ledges, covering at about half tide. The white sandy bottom b(ltween these ledges and extending off them for a distance varying from 50 to 150 yards is visible for a considerable distance on a bright day. Between these reefs and Poverotni Island there are no dangers, the water varying from 30 to 50 fathoms in depth. Poison Cove, abreast Poverotni Island, is a small open bight, with low gravelly beaches, and flats at the head that uncover for a quarter of a mile at low wate.r. It is free from dangers and affords an anchorage for small craft in 18 fathoms, soft bottom. One and one-half miles to the northward is the entrance to Ushk Bay, which extends to the westward and southward for 4 miles, with an average width of three-quarters of a mile, narrowing to one-third at the point where it changes direction. It affords an anchorage at the head in from 18 t-0 20 fathoms, soft bottom. A peculiar formntion of the hills is noticeable near the entrance on the southern shore, and a solitary ronnd-topped hill, L,800 feet high, with several landslides, marks its northern point and the southern entrance to Hooniah Sound. Five miles N. by W. i W. from Poverotni Island and 4 miles WSW. from Broad Island is Emmons Island, Point Emmons being its eastern extremity. This island was named in honor of Lieut. George Emmons, U.S. N., who has spent many years in these waters and furnished much valuable information in regard to them and the habits and customs of the Indians in this section of .Alaska. The island is well wooded and has a small lake on its northern side. A ridge in the center, 600 feet high at its eastern end, has the appearance of a cone to vessels coming from Chatham Strait. Off the western end of Emmons Island, distant one-half mile, is a group of small wooded islands, connected at low water, from which a reef, bare at half tide, extends to the northward for nearly one-half mile. The passage between the south shore of Hooniah ~found and Emmons Island

should not be attempted, as the water is shallow, and long sand spits, visible at low water, make well into the channel from the western end of Emmons Island and the small group of islands to the westward. Two and one-half miles WNW. from Emmons Island a large island, 5 miles in length, 1~ miles wide at its eastern end and 1 mile wide at its western end, divides Hooniah Sound into two arms. A sand spit, one-quarter mile in length, covered at high water with a small, wooded, high-water island near its center, connects the large island with the shore at its western end. On it~ southwestern end is a prominent landslide. Off its ea~tern end a ledge makes off for 250 yards, and oft' its southeastern point is a ledge, distant 250 yards ESE., bare at high tide. One mile to tbe westward from its eastern end, and one-third mile off the northern shore, is a small bare rock, some 8 feet out of water at high tide. The northern shore is low, with sand and gravel beaches, which extend offshore 150 to 200 yards for a mile above the bare rock. The southern shore of the island is bold and steP.p. · · Five and one-half miles beyond Emmons Island the south arm of Hooniah Sound is divided into a bay, 3 miles long, extending t-0 the southward, and a smaller arm, 2 miles long, that connects with the northern arm at high water. 'fhree and one-half miles above Emmons Island is a small bight, with flats at its head, bare at low water. Off its eastern point is a small, rouud, wooded island, connected with the shore at low water, from which a reef extends to the eastward for 200 yards. The southern shore should not be approached too closely, as the low-water line extends ·well out. The bay extending to the southward is clear except for the western shore, which is shoal, with several sand and gravel bars. The arm at the hea4 connecting with the northern arm, in addition to extensive mud and sand flats, has a low gral:lsy flat, covered here and there by small bushes, extending through on the left of a small 'vooded knoll to a similar fiat miles above the junction of the north and south arms. In this small conn~cting arm, one.half mile NNW. W. from the wooded island, on the sand spit, and in mid-channel, is a rock, bare at low water. This rock is about 2! miles above the southern point of the arm. The northern arm of Hooniah Sound is comparatively clear, until one-eighth of a mile to the southward of the small island on the northern shore, where, in mid-channel, is a rock, bare at low water. This rock is not quite abreast of a prominent waterfall on the north shore. At the head of the northern arm are two streams, both small, entering from low valleys, one extencling in the same general direction as Hooniah Sound and the other having a more southerly trend. A wooded island, with a reef extending one-quarter mile to the eastward, lies off the point of the ·ridge dividing the two valleys and is connected at low water with the shore by the flats at the head.

SAILING DIREOTIONS FOR OH.A.THAM STRA.11', POINT GARDNER TO POINT SAMUEL.

If coming up the strait from the sea, keep a mid-channel course, about NW. by N. It is safe, however, to approach a line drawn half a mile from one prominent poiut to the same distance from the next, as all dangers will lie inshore of this line. In coming from Frederick Sound give Point Gardner a berth of 1 mile, because to the south of it bas not been surveyed, and the strong currents and heavy tide rips in its vicinity iudicate irregular bottom. With Point Gardner abeam NE. by E., the course is NW. ~ N. to clear Point Caution 1 mile, where there are also heavy tide rips. If bound up the strait, continue this course, which will probably carry to Point Marsden, by making due allowance for tidal currents. If bound for Killisnoo, having run 15 miles and Point Caution bearing E., change course to :N. by \V. ~ \V. If bound up Peril Strait, run 27 miles, when Fairway Island Rhould bear SW. by \V., 11ortb of l\lidway Reef; then change to \VSV\'., keeping in mid-channel north of Fairway Island. Wilson Cove is not recommended for an anchorage, but should it be necessary, stand in parallel to tlie south shore, about N. by E. ~ E., midway between the reef in the month of the cove and the south shore, keeping clear of the kelp, and anchor in 8 to 10 fathoms. V\7 hitewater Bay.-'l'he directions in the Pacific Coast Pilot, part 1, p. 157, are good. Cha-ik Bay.-Stand on uutil tlie bay is wide open between the two low, flat islands in its mouth, uot woode.<l, one off Hocky Point and the other inside of Village Point, when Htaud in about NE. by E., heading for a low, wooded island in tile middle of the bay. When llalfway

between the island off Village Point and the low, wooded island an arm will open to the northward. Steer for the mouth of it, about NNE., and anchor in the middle, in 12 fathoms, sticky mud bottom. The south arm should be avoided, except by small vessels, on account of shoals, rocks, and kelp. Hootz Bay.-From off Distant Point follow the shore on the south side, keeping about half a mile away to clear the sunken rock until the mouth of the inner bay opens, when steer for it about SE. by E. ~ E., favoring the ~outhern shore to clear an island and some sunken rocks close to it, in the middle of the narrowest part. After passing the island keep in the middle until reaching . the divide, when take the middle of either arm desired. It is spacious and easy of access, with anchorage anywhere in the north arm in 20 fathoms or less, and at the head of the south arm in 18 fathoms, with muddy bottom and good protection. From Killisnoo there is a good channel with plenty of water inside of the line of islands and reefs. Keep in the middle, steering about SE. by E. tt E., avoiding kelp. Cascade Bay.-Opposite Point Gardner, requires no special directions. Stand into the middle about WSW. until yon can get bottom in about 25 fathoms, then anchor. It is not recommended except for small vessels unable to work up against a nortlrnrly wind. The cascade can be seen to Point Gardner. ·warm Spring Bay.-Open up the mouth of the bay, when stand in about SW. by W., midway between a white high-water rock iu its center and the south shore, which is bold. A small vessel can anchor in either of the two small bays on the south side and 11ave good protection from southerly winds. The western one is preferable because of shoaler water-12 to 15 fathoms. A large vessel must go near the cascade at the head to get 25 fathoms and yet have swinging room. This latter is not recommended, as the bottom is rocky and the current usually sets out, caused by the flow of water down the cascade from the large mountain lake at the bead, making a vessel lie broadside to the south wind, which sucks in and caroms on the steep mountain side north of the bay, sheering her about very uncomfortably. Ta-Katz Bay.-This is the best protected anchorage on this part of the coast, being entirely surrounded by high, rocky walls, but ·might be difficult to enter with heavy southerly sea. The anchorage is in the northern arm, and the entrance is not visible until close in to the southward of Point Turbot. When three-eighths of a mile ESE. from Point Turbot, steer SW.~ W. for the middle of the entrance, between the high-bluff north shore and the high-water rocks off the highwooded promontory which divides the bay. This clears the low-water rock 250 yards SE. from Point Turbot and the one inside of the promontory point uear the north shore. When past the promontory point, favor the so11th shore to clear a sunken rock and kelp patch near the middle, though it can be left on either side. Anchor near the middle of the bay in its widest part in 20 fathoms, soft, sandy bottom. Or, if desired, round the ·Second point and anchor in 10 fathoms, with plenty of swinging room. Do not pass a white lump of au island around the second bend, for there the sand flat begins. The south arm is not recommeuded. The water is deep, and the bottom is rocky and irregular, with occasional kelp patches. Kelp Bay.-Open up the mouth and stand iuto the middle, about WNW. ~ W., giving Point Lull and North Point a berth of 1 mile to clear a reef making off from Point Lull to the SE. Au anchorage can be had at the head of either of these arms, with soft bottom, in 18 to 24 fathoms, having a care not to approach too near the head at high tide, because of. the flats. The only directions are to keep in the middle. The shores are bold, but ledges make out from some of tlle points which do not show at high water. The best anchorage is in the southeast corner of the basin, close under a high, bald knob. Stand in until clear of the sunken rock northwest of Crow Islands, when haul around the islands, fµ.voring them, to clear a low-water rock not marked with kelp, about the middle. Course about SE. by S., keeping the bald knob open on the starboard bow, and anchor close under it in 20 to 24 fathoms. This affords excellent protection except from north west. There is a fair chaune1 betweeu Crow and Pond islands used by the Patterson. There are two suuken rocks in it surrounded by kelp. No directions can be given for it, except keep near mid-channel and clear of kelp. Hootz11al100 Inlet.-H.ound Dauger Point buoy a1Hl ~teer a mid·cltauuel cuu1·se until the ludian B. Doc. 3.j--25

village on tlle south side shows clear of a bluft; when favor the north shore until past Turn Point, then steer to clear Rose Rock. Round Rose Rock, keeping it close aboard, and if bound for Favorite Bay stand well over for the coal mine on Sullivans Point, until midway between the unbroken shores of the channel leading into Favorite Bay. Keep in mid-channel until the fishing camp on the south shore is reached, when favor either shore to clear a rock in mid-channel, uncovered at low water and marked by a box on a tree on the south shore. A good anchorage may be found in Favorite Bay anywhere to the westward of a high bluff on the south shore, marking the limits of extensive fiats. If bound for M)tchell Bay, round Rose Rock, keeping it close aboard, and stand close along the reef making out from Turn Point. When well clear of the south end of the island dividing the channels leading to the northward, steer for the entrance leading to the narrows at Point PiIJsbury. Upon approaching tlie narrows, keep the island on the south side close aboard until in mid-channel beyond; there the course is mid-channel until near Point Bridge, when the eastern shore must be favored. Beyond Point Bridge the course is again mid-channel until within 12miles of the entrance to Mitcllell Bay, when the timber fall on Diamond Island, kept in the middle of the opening between North Point and a small, low, round, liigh-water island on the soutli side, wilJ carry clear of the reef on the west side and a rock on the east side. After entering Mitchell Bay follow the west shore and pass midwa.y between Diamond Island and the shore. Beyond Diamond Island clear, open water wiJl be found and a good anchorage in the southeast coruer in 10 to 20 fathoms of water. The passage from Mitchell to Kana1koo Bay is so full of reefs and so devoid of permanent landmarks that could be used as ranges that no sailing directions can be giveu. The navigation of Hootznahoo Inlet and its lagoons is such that it should not be attempted except lJy small vessels of short length aud ready turning qualities-and tlien only at low water slack, at which time all dangers are exposed-unless a pilot with local knowledge can be obtained.
SAILING DIRECTIONS THROUGH PERIL STRAIT FROM POVEROTNI ISLAND TO CHA.THA:\1 STRAIT, COMING FROM THE SOUTHW.ARD ·

The sailing directions from Sergius Narrows to Poverotni Island as given iu the Pacific Coast Pilot, Alaska, Part I, are correct. Poverotni Island may be passed to the northward at a distance of about 200 yards. There is a passage between Pogibsbi Point and Poverotni Island, but is not recommended. When it bears abeam, steer for Otstoia Island, course NNE. The u.sual steamer track is to the eastward of tbe island, but there is a good passage to the west,vard, between it and Krugloi and Elevoi Islands. If passing it to the eastward, favor the island side, leaving the red buoy on starboard 11aud. After passing the black buoy on Coziau Rock, steer NE. t E. for the easterly one of the two big lamlslides on northern shore until the northeast end of Broad Island bears W. by S.; then steer E. H S. until False Lindenberg Head is abeam; then E. by N. until l\IcClelJau Rock is abeam, and tlience into Cliatham Strait the course is NE. by E. This course will carry across Chatliam Strait south of Kenasnow Island, making allowance for tides. If going to the westward of Otstoia Island, after pa'.'lsing the island do not steer to the eastward of a line joining the western side of Otstoia Island and the eastern sine of Broad Islaud until the buoy on Cozian Rock is passed. This clears Cozian Rock and Shoal.

Sitkoh Bay.-Pass Poiut Craveu at a distance of 200 ya1·ds, and favor the western shore for a mile, then steer for the middle of the big·ht ou the eastern side, anchoring iu 18 to 25 fathoms, hard bottom. A better anchorage can be had at the bead of the left arm, in about 20 fathoms, soft bottom. No special directions are necessary. Keep in the middle. Hodmau Bay.-On entering, keep a mid-channel course about SW.~ S. aud anchor to the southward of two small islands at the head of the bay in 10 to 15 fathoms, soft, sandy bottom. The extr1~me western point on the eastern shore of tlie bay will show between the islands when on tlie ancliorage. Sa-ook Bay.-Keep a mid-chanuel course about SW. by S. until abreast of the first of a small group of small islands near the eastern shore; then favor the eastem shore, keeping at a distance of 100 yards, until past a stream ou the western shore from which a sand spit makes out. The anchorage is about half a mile farther on in the middle of tho inlet in 18 to 22 fathoms; soft, green mud. Hanus Hay.-Is not recommended for large vessels. There are two coves at its western end which may be used by small craft. Poiut Thatcher.-Inside of Point Thatcher there is an anchorage formerly used by the Russians, but it is not recommended, as it affords very little protect10n. Keep in mid-channel between Point Thatcher and Midway l{eef until well inside the point and anchor in 15 to 20 fathoms, rocky bottom, mid way between the two extreme points of the first bencl in the shore line. Hooniah Sound.-Needs no special directions. The north arm is clear until near its head, where there is a rock, bare at low water, in the middle, to be avoided by favoring the south shore. The entrance t-0 the south arm from Peril Strait should be navigated with care, following the deep water as shown by the chart. An anchorage can be bad at the head of either of the three arms in 15 to 20 fathoms, soft bottom, having a care at high tide not to get on the flats. Ushk Bay.-Needs no special directions. Keep in the middle and anchor near the head. Better directions can be written when the chart is issued, so that courses can be taken and corrected soundings had.
TIDES .A.ND CURRENTS.

In the vicinity of Killisnoo the currents are very irregular, but the means show that the last half of the ebb and the first part of the tlood set in through Bootz Bay and set out to the westward through the north channel. The second half of the flood and the first half of the ebb set in to the eastward through the north channel and out into Hootz Bay. Tlie set is parallel to the axis of the channel, and the strength is not important, except in the narrow part of the north entrance. The current at the wharf is even more erratic than that in the channel, but is not so strong; sometimes, however, an eddy will be found, but not strong enough to interfere materially with making a landing. .At Killisnoo the following date were obtained by observation:

Bootznahoo Inlet.-The currents are strong and various all through this place, and the uninitiated should not attempt to navigate it, except at slack water, aud had lJettet· choose low slack, so that in case of grounding the benefit of a rising tide will be obtained. The iiood current at the entrance sets in nearly parallel to the north shore and so continues until it reaches Village Rock, where it divides, one part going to the northward over what Meade calls "Hell's Acre," and the other continuing to the eastward south of Rose Rock, where it again divides. One part continues east into ]favorite Bay, while the other turns short around the rock and divides again, one part going north, tlie other branch passing over " Bell's Acre." The rapids begin at Village Rock and continue until well past Hose Rock. The strongest current observed in the channel was 6.2 knots, but this is not the strongest. It probably reaches 8 knots at times. It is slack at about one hour and thirty minute8 after high and low water at Killisnoo. The channel connecting Mitchell Bay with the lower part of the inlet commences at Point

388

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Pillsbury. From this point to Point Bridge the current is very swift, probably reaching 10 knots, with much boiling and swirling, the worst place being at Point Bridge. This can only be passed at slack water, which lasts only a few minutes and occurs about one hour aml fifty minutes after high and low water at Killisnoo. Through all of the narrow channels leading into the various bays the currents run with great velocity, a11cl they should not be attempted in any kind of a boat except at slack water. Pogibshi Point.-At Pogibshi Point the following data were obtained by observation:

Sergius Narrows.-From the observations made it is concluded that the flood current coming in through Salisbury Sound flows up through the Narrows and into the broader part of Peril Strait, north of Pogibshi Point, when it meets the flood that has come up through Chatham Strait and into the eastern end of Peril Strait. Just where in this broad part they meet is u11certai11, but from the observations made it is concluded that both currents spread out an1l lose themselves. The time of slack water in Sergius and Adams Narrows varies from one hour and thirty minutes before high and low water to two hours and thirty minutes, the average being about two hours. The slack high seems to come earlier than the slack low, and seldom comes less than two hours before high water, while the slack low seldom comes more tl1an two hours before low water. The duration of slack is only a few minutes, in fact, sometimes it ceases to run in OJH· direction and immediately startR in the other, and is not half an hour as stated in the Sailing Directions. There is half an hour, however, when the current does uot exceed two knots, and the surface is comparatively smooth, and vessels may go through with safety. The strongest current obi;erved was 8.2 knots. It is probable that it reaches 10 knots at spring tides, and boils and swirls in sucli :i manner that navigation iR unsafe from below Francis Rocks to Leisnoi Island.
COOK INLET AND TO THE WESTWARD.

The following information concerning Cook Inlet a.nd the region to tho westward ilil compiled from the notes of Prof. "\V. H. Dall, U. S. Geologicnl Survey, ma<le by him in tbe summer of 1895, and published in the March bulletin of the American Geographical Society, by whose permission it is used. The changes suggested by him, as far as possible, have been ma<le on Coast Survey charts Nos. 8500 and 8651, and will be rna<le on the uext edition of No. 8800. The uncharted harbor on the north side of Cape Douglas, the southwest point of entrance to Cook Inlet, is included between the rounded Jow peninsula of Cape Douglas and a narrower cape on the west and north rising about 40 feet from the top of the steep beach; 'fo the south three glaciers are visible, two coming down south of Cape Douglas, and one ending in a stream which discharges into the southern part of the bight. The southernmost glacier is the largest. The shore about Cape Douglas is defended by numerous rocks, and should not he approached too closely. Within the bay, anchorage may be had in 2 to 5 fathoms under the west cape, where the bottom appears to. be clear. The south and east parts of the bay are more or less shoal and rocky and should be avoided. In entering, the navigator should keep the western shore aboard. Shelter may be had here in any wind except heavy northerly and northeasterly gales. Leaving the cape, the northern slope of the mass of mountains b.ehind it is seen to be snow covered, and with three very large snowy glaciers descending to the vicinity of the sea. The easternmost appears to be the largest, and shows an even snowy surface without lateral moraines. Northwest of the group of mountains is a space of comparatively low land crossing the peninsula behind the shoal and dangerous Kamishak Bay. Over these pla:ins many caribou are eaid to range in summer. Between Cape Douglas and Augustin Island, and about 6 or 8 miles from the latter, are the Sea Otter Rocks, a low group not definitely placed on the charts. We steamed a straight course NW. W. (p. c.) from the cape in calm, clear weather, which, according to the latest charts, would

llave carried us directly over the rocks, but in fact carried ~s about 2 miles west of tllem. At low water there were two low, fiat table rocks, with a smaller pointed one between them, visible at a dh~tance of 2 miles, the eye being 10 feet above the water. At high water they are said to be awash. ·we brought them in one with a high bluff, which we supposed to be Point Bede, on the east shore of the inlet, bearing NE. by E. These rocks constitute a serious danger to navigation. Augustin Island (otherwise Black Fox or Ohernobura) is a typical volcanic peak, with low borders of talmi. At present, anchorage may be had in 32- fathoms, sand, about a mile offshore, with tlie south point bearing· SE. by S., the western point NW., and the peak NE. by E. ~ E. The south point is low and sandy, but the boat landing is best here, the beach running off very shoal north of it. The west point is compo.:;ed of ashes aud volcanic stones, forming low, bluff banks, and running off in fiats, upon which tlle bowlders of volcanic rock, sometimes very large, are irregularly distributed. No chart of the island exist:::. There was formerly an excellent harbor for small craft on the west side, and the inner harbor still exists, but the entrance is now dry at low water. This change was brought about at the time of the last eruption, less than ten years ago. The peak bas the regular volcanic form, the rim of the crater being somewhat broken away on the west and north. Steam issues in intermittent puffs from the crater and inner cone~ and when these puffs rise vertically aud spread out like a mushroom above the peak it is taken as an evidence by the natives of several days of calm weather, during which they do not hesitate to put out far from shore in their frail kyaks to hunt the sea otter. The peak is about 3,000 feet in height. The upper two-thirds of the peak is largely snow covered; oelow, much is bare ashes and scattered lava olocks, then more or less heroage with stunted spruce, sparsely scattered, and low, creeping alders. The oorders of the island to tlle south and west are low and hummocky, with many bogs and small pools. The south shore has blufis of variable height; noue very high. The passage west of the island is foul near the island shore, but has a navigable passage rather closer to the mainland shore. Tuxed11i Harbor, sometimes called Snug Harbor, lies between Chisick Island and the mainland. That a snug harbor is to be found here is noted on a sketch chart of the United States Hydrographic Office, but that the bay is 5 or G miles long, free from dangers, and forming a spacious anchorage, would hardly be supposed from the very imperfect indications giveu on the best charts. Chisick Island is narrow, and rises over 2,000 feet in height, with bluft' shores, the water bold-to. There is a small, round, high, rocky islet outside of Chisick, which forms a convenient landmark for vessels feeling their way alongshore in a fog, which sometimes conceals the entrance. The sout.hern end of Chisick is high and narrow, with no reef or rocks oft' it, as has been erroneously stated. The strata are somewhat inclined to the south near the entrance, but in the main are nearly horizontal, and composed of heavy oeds of sandstone and conglomerate of varying hardness, so that the upper part of the island weathers into steps like terraces ou a grand scale, offering a remarkable castellated appearance to tlle spectator. The scenery here is very fine and peculiar in its features. The splendid volcanic peak of lliamna rises among the mountains SW. by W. from the harbor at a distance of some 15 miles. Its upper part is set with glaciers, but the conical form and scenic beauty of the peak can only be fully realized from a greater distance. The fairway of the harbor is nearly straight, with high and singularly weathered cliff's rising on either hand. Toward the bead it widens a little. Here good holding ground may be had in 18 fathoms. At this point the vessel which carries down the product of the salmon canneries from the inlet is anchored for the summer. The canned salmon is brought to 11er by small light-draft steam tenders, which can cross the shallow water on the bars of the rivers at Kassiloft' and Nenilchik, where the salmon are taken. From Captain Hughes we learned that the spring tide in June was 3() feet; at ordinary times the range is about 24 feet. The northern end of the harbor is protected by reefs aud foul ground beyond Chisick faland, where there is a large open bay. There may be a channel out this way, but until it is surveyed it would be imprudeut to attempt the passage except with small craft. I uto this bay a large river falls, fed by the glaciers of lliamna and the drainage of the other mountains. The north end of Ohisick shows high bluffs rising much above those on the ma.in shore, aucl above to a magnificent castellated summit of curiously eroded almost horizontal beds of sandstone, lirnestone, and conglomerate, which can hardly be less than 2,000 feet in elevation.

the beaches the rocks are worn into caves, arches, and pillars, about which circle innumerable multitudes of sea birds. There is no· bar or obstruction at the entrance of the harbor, but the great range of the tides and the narrow form of the harbor produce well-marked rips at certain stages of the tide, which might lead to the supposition that rocks or shoals exist. On the island side the shores are bolcl·to; on the mainland at the head of the harbor it is shoal for a long distance from the beach. Notwithstanding the absence of protection at the entrance, southerly winds do not blow home into the harbor on account of the highland on either side; but for the same reason wind from the land is often stronger in the harbor than out in the inlet. July 23, 1895, flood tide made shortly after 3 p. m . .A.11 the navigation in the upper part of Cook Inlet is commonly carried on with reference to the tides; a sailing vessel can make no headway against them and it is the custom to anchor during the unfavorable tides, which can be done almm;t anywhere alongshore. Off the West Foreland there is a small village of Kootena Indians, and here the shore is of bluffs, apparently a:bont 50 feet high, of gravel and sand, wooded above, with some high mountains distant in the interior. It was slack water here about 10 a. m .·Tuly 24. Between the two Forelands is a wide bay with shoal water and many scattered bowlders rising out of it along the shore. The land behind is very low in part, all heavily wooded with spruce, and a river carrying very muddy water comes in here. Near the North Foreland is a series of whitish gravel bluffs of very regular height, with a broad beach and shallow water for a mile otl' it, with scattered, sometimes very large, squarish rocks of whitish color irregularly tlistributed over the flats. There are Indian houses in the principal gap in this series of bluffs, but the largest settlement, Tyonek, is near the point of t.be Foreland, where a small gravel fiat exists. Here the water off the beach for half a mile is shoal, but not foul. Off the Foreland southward, in the middle of the inlet, most charts show an area inclosed by a dotted line connected continuously with foul ground on the southeast shore of the inlet. This is an error, as there is a. clear passage on each side of the central patch, which latter trends with the hi.let and shows at low water large bare sand banks 8 or 10 feet high. East of North Foreland and between it and Point Possession, also in the middle of the inlet, is a flat or shoal not shown on the charts and which constitutes a serious danger. It is believed to be 5 or 6 miles long and not less than 4 miles wide. Its southern edge is about WSW. (mag.) from Point Possession. The village of Tyonek is small, without a harbor, and the spot is inaccessible by sea in winter, as this part of the inlet freezes over. The tide is from 25 to 35 feet in range here, with a depth of 3~ fathoms half a mile off the beach. Turnagain Bay extends to the eastward from Point Possession and is the passageway to the placer mines, of which much has been said in tho public press.· Northeasterly from Point Possession, on the continent, the land is mostly low, formed by the delta of the Sushitna H.iver. West of the river, at some distance inland, rises a noted landmark, a low but conspicuous peak known as Sushitna Mountain. Eastward from the Sushitna, another, the Knik or Fire River, enters the inlet north of Point Campbell. West of Point Campbell is a small high island called Fire Island, to which sufficient water for an ordinary schooner may be bad at low tide, according to local navigators. Both at Point Campbell and Point Possession the land is low and wooded, but at about 12 miles eastward of the latter the mountains come to the water's edge, with narrow steep-sided ravines and canyons, in which are the streams where gold is washed. 'l'he land rises to about 2,000 feet; some of the peaks are higher, and the slopes are rather sparsely wooded. The rise and fall of the tide in Turnagaiu Bay is remarkable, and the middle of the passage, as well as much of its margin, is occupied by extensive flats, partial1y dry at low water, with a shallow channel at eaeh side. To enter the bay and avoid the shoals, keep Point Possession well aboard and steer for the northern edge of the highland on the south side of the bay, keeping a little to the southward of a straight course between the two; keep the lead constantly going, as the shoals shift to some extent. Allow for a tide of 50 feet in range and select an anchorage in accordance with the circumstances of the case. The northern channel is not navi· gable eastward of Fire Island, and the island is nearer to Point Campbell and rather more southerly in position than indicated by the existing charts. The shoal in the center of the bay is elongated,

trending with the inlet, and not rounded as on the charts. These shoals are mostly hard saud, with a fow scattered bowlders. The following is a graphic description showing the strength of the tides in this vicinity:
We anchored under the lco of o. small, high, conspicuous bluff, the first ea.st of Point Possession, whero the minors nssurecl us there wns nlwnys water enough to float our little tug. It is hardly necessnr.v to repeat that here one can only move with a fair tide. At OUT a.nchorngo, with the standard compaRs, we founu Point Campbell boo.ring W. 400 N., the north edge of Point Possession \V.10° N., the S\V. edge of Fire Island in one with Point Campbell, Mount Sushitna NW. i W., and tho bluff point a cable's length to tho east. We loft North Foroland with tho flood tide immediately after it turned at 2 a. m., July 25, ancl at 8 n. m. found high water nt the bluff above mentioned, with 41 feet of water under us. Thero wo.s a slack of about fifteen minutes. At. 9.15 o.. m. we put out the patent log to test the strength of tho ebb, and founcl it to average 3i knots during tho first ho.If, though we were out of the strength of tho tide. It was sin.ck water at 3.30 p. m., and thl'ro. WIU! less than 2 feet of water unclcr our bilge, showing a range for this day of 39 feet at this point. We wore obliged to await tho bore, helpless on tho sancl, and it did not keep ns waiting long, but came in with o. rush, in a wave 3·or 4 feet high, which whisked us a mile and a ho.If up tho inlet before we could get out another anchor_; o.nd hero, with full steam ahead and both anchors clown, we had all we could do to keep her from dragging. Tho log showed a 7-knot current, ancl tho water, after the bore had passed, rose 6 feet in ten minutes. At extreme spring tides the ebb would leave this anchorage dry and for a mile or two seaward. The force of the current was such as to twist our main nnchor, weighing 250 pounds and of good Swedish iron, in two different directions. It was a fit object for a museum when recoverecl.

Off the highland west of our anchorage is a small, high island, called "Haystack" by the miners. It rises out of the flats, which dry all around it at low water. Kachemak Bay, on the eastern shore of the inlet, is interesting ou account of the presence of extensive deposits of brown coal, and because it is the fl.nest harbor in the inlet, never obstructed by ice, and one of the fl.nest on the whole Pacific Coast. It separates the comparatively level plateau of the Kenai Peninsula, west of its axial mountain range, from a spur of that range which comes down to the sea at Point Bede, in which· there are several indentations affording anchorage. These mountains are not very high, but from them descend several attractive glaciers not difficult to reach. The rocks on this side of the bay are mostly crystalline or eruptive, forming a marked contrast to the bluffs of nearly horizontal sandstone and clays, with conspicuous coal seams which border the opposite shore. The harbor is protected by a long, low spit of gravel, within which is good (l.llchorage close to the shore, but the beach in front of the bluffs makes off shoal for 2 or, toward the head of the bay, fully 3 miles. The range of tide in the upper bay is 22 feet, but at springs the extreme range is said to be 30 in the upper part of the bay and. somewhat less toward the entrance. Excepting a few buildings connected with the work of coal prospectors there is no settlement within the spit. In the lower bay, outside of the harbor, is a snug anchorage, Chesloknn of the natives, Seldovia or Herring Bay of the Russians. Here are two trading stations, and most of the inhabitants from Port Graham, where the harbor is less convenient, have migrated to Seldovia Village. There is quite a collection 'Of houses and a Greek chapel. No chart has been published of this anchorage, except a small delineation from a Russian sketch which is included in the chart of Kachemak Bay, compiled by the Coast Survey, No. 8651. The bluff at the southeast head of the entrance is composed of two small rocky islets united to each other and to the mainland by a low spit, so that the land is not continuously high, as represented on the sketch alluded to. The entrance has rocky bottom clear across, with kelp growing in 5~ fathoms. 'l'he northern head is bluff aud rocky; a rounded bowlder lies off it, visible at low water. There are also rocks above and below water about the opposite headland. Inside there are 7 and 8 fathoms, saudy bottom, off the village in mid-harbor, with protection from all winds except northwest, aud at the head of the harbor complete shelter. Amalik Harbor lies behind Takhli faland, on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula. We found excellent shelter from all winds, and anchorage in 10 fa.thorns, sand. · A long inlet penetrates the land here, which has never been surveyed. The rocks are mostly coarse saudstones, pierced by volcanic dikes and contain seams of a superior quality of brown coal. Coal Bay is a fine sheet of wat.er, of which no charts exist and the indications on the general charts are very inaccurate. The entrance is partially obstructed by an area of foul ground with rocky islets antl pinnacles extending to the southwest from the northeastern point of entrance for several miles. Another patch, separated by a clear passage, is nearly in the middle of the eutrauce. The Hussin.11 Hydrogrnphic Chart of 1848 shows these with more accuracy than any of the later

maps, but rarely indicates the inner shores of the bay. Cape Yaklek forms the southwest headland, and is free from offshore dangers. There is just within this cape a small spit of heavy shingle, with high, rocky bluffs behind it. Here anchorage may be had in good weather, and the camps ot sea-otter hunters are often made. There is no settlement in. the bay, which is divided into two arms by a high promontory near its head. The western arm terminates in low, fiat land, behind which is a large lagoon, dry at low water, into which empties a rather large stream. The land at the head of the eastern arm is higher. Most of the topography about the bay is high and barren, the rocks lying in nearly hori· zon tal heavy beds of sandstone a11d conglomerate, which weather into benches and offer scenery of much impressiveness. It somewhat recalls that at Chisick Island, but the mountain forms are more massive and simple, with long, even, talus slopes. Near the water the blufls are curiously eroded by the sea and weather, aud shelter myriads of sea fowl. Siugularly enough, tllough the rocks i11land appear brown or gray, the effect of them in distant masses was a marked brownish purple, giving the landscape a peculiarly chilly aspect, which well deserved the name applied to the bay. On the northeastern shore a stream comes in from a conspicuous valley, off which, on a gradually deepening flat, anchorage may be had in any depth desired. The water in most other parts of the bay is inconveniently deep. The shores near tllis place are of low bluffs of very massive light-gray limestone, which falls in enormous blocks, and these are worn by the sea into very remarkable spheroidal forms. From the high laud about the bay in windy weather heavy gusts sweep down, but the holding ground is good and the anchorage at this point is sufficiently pro· tected from the sea. Tbe absence of trees gives an individuality to tbe landscape which is very striking when one comes from the dem;ely forested slopes of eastern Alaska. In Kialagvit Bay, farther west, we have another large uncl1arted sbeet of water, defended from the sea by a long line of islets. The indications of the general charts are very iuaccnrate. The bay at the eastward, leading to the Becheroff village, is clear of dangers; except near the points of entrance, where foul ground extends well offshore, and near the village, where the water gradually shoals for two miles off the beach. There is no conspicuous mountain recognizable as the one on the charts near the village. The mountains resemble those of Cold Bay, but, as the strata are inclined more steeply, do not show horizontal benches. The entrance to the inner bay is ratlicr close to the outer islets, with :i or 3 fathoms over a bar. Within tbere are no invisible daugers, and the water is mostly quite deep. There is a seco11cl entrauce west of the first duster of islets, with a clear passage and deep water, accor<ling to a local pilot. There are several visible rocks there, but no hidden danger~. The portage to the U gaguk River, of tbe northern slope of the peninsula, begins in a valley near the western eud of the inner bay. At the extreme southwestern end rises the Olai Volcano, from whicl1, on its eastern flank, a large glacier descends, whilb on the seaward slope two others come down from the same masif. The mountains slope gradually toward the beach, covered with dense llerbage. Chignik Bay opens to the eastward, with no concealed dangers. Its south point of entrance is Tuliumnit Point, a remarkable lleadland, sometimes called Castle Point, which forms a Jaudmark for navigators in this vicinity. The point is extremely narrow and composed of tertiary sand· stones, forming a shallow syncline, the stratification being a conspicuous feature. North and west of the point is a deep indentation known as Castle Bay, unsurveyed, but which is said to afford anchorage on its northwest side. The grassy highlauds west of the bay afford feeding grouuds at times for the wild caribou, and by driving them to the narrow point (which at one place is only a few hundred feet wide) large numbers are said to be secured by hunters. 'l'he south shore of Chignik Bay, west of Castle Bay, is bluff and high, with four indentations, the two to the east being closed by bars of gravel, behind which shallow lagoons exist, while the two farther west afford ancliorage. The westernmost, named Doris Cove, is a snug and perfectly protected harbor, and was surveyed by the United States Coast Survey in 1874. Here the vessel which serves the associated salmon canneries is anchored during the season. The extreme southwestern corner of the bay is marked by a high, round-topped, vertical bluff, at the foot of which is the entrance to Chignik Lagoon, protected by a long sand spit, with a navigable channel between it and the bluff. There is a least depth of 2 fathoms on the bar and 22 feet of water at high tide. The channel is moderately wide, and inside the entrance offers 3 to 5 fathoms over sandy bottom. as far as the

canneries, beyond which the lagoon is shoa.. At high water a 3 or 4 foot channel leads to the bead of the lagoon, where a river enters, at the mouth of which are the salmon weirs. A light· draft stern-wheel steamer affords transportation, and there is water enough in the river to permit the ascent of this boat several rnilea, to a point where a seam of brown coal is worked by the association for use in the canneries. It was high water in the lagoon about 1.30 p. m. on August 4. The river is bordered by vertical banks of tertiary rocks, 30 or 40 feet in average height. Two or three miles above the coal mine the river issues from a large lake, said to be 6 or 7 miles long, and connected with another, equally large, by a stream 5 or 6 miles in length. The topography is rolling, with low hills and a wide expanse of tundra, on which caribou find grazing. An important centre of trade, fisheries for cod, and gold mining, are found in the Shumagin Islands at Delaroff Harbor, Unga, aud Sand Point, a few miles above. The harbor at Delarofl' Village has not been surveyed, though a small Russian sketch was printed many years ago. It consists of an outer roadstead surrounded with rocky cliffs, where vessels may lay to a mooring, and an inner lagoon, which bas been stated to be silte~ up. It has been found, however, that good anchorage for vessels drawing not more than 12 feet may be had inside the entrance to the lagoon. This is important, as the outer bay is unsafe in southeast gales, an'd several wrecks have occurred there. The anchorage is in mid-channel in 3~ to 5 fathoms, with a lee afforded by a reef and kelp patch on the south side of tbe entrance. A dangerous rock exists off the outer roadstead, which lies SE. by E. i E. from the middle of the entrance to the lagoon. Going out the breakers are in line with the trend of the point at the south head of the outer bay. :From the inner anchorage the visible south end of Nagai bore E. by S. ~ S., the inner north headland E. by S., and the rock at the south headland SE. by S. ! S., by compass. The long spit of ash and volcanic gravel which formerly connected the two volcanoes of Bogoslo:ff and Grewingk, northwest of Unalaska, is now broken by a navigable passage directly over the spot where, for more than a century, Ship Rock of Cook towered in solitary majesty. The newer Grewingk Volcano gives out but little steam, and the peak which at first surmounted it has fallen in or crumbled away until the upper part of the island is approximately level, -or appears so from the sea. From the southeastern side of the island a long, low, falciform spit extends, off which, in fair weather, protection may be had from westerly winds, and parties desiring to visit the volcano may, with care, effect a landing.

LOGARITHMS, THEIR NATURE, COMPUTATION, AND USES, WITH LOGARITHMIO TABLES OF NUMBERS AND CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS TO TEN PLACES OF DEOIMALS-PART I,
By W. W.
DUFFIEI.ll,

Superintendent.

HISTORY.

1. Logarithms were invented by John Napier, Baron of Merchiston, in 1614. This original system was an exceedingly complicated one and, in consequence, oflittle practical use., Most mat~- 1 matical writers consider the natural system of logarithms, whose base is 2. 7182818284590452~360+ and whose modulus is +1, as that originally devised by Napier, and in the published tables these logarithms are called Napierian. This is a serious error. The natural system was invented by John Speidel, and bis table of "New Logarithms" was published in London in 1619. As Baron·Napier died April 4, 1617, be could not, by any possibility, have ever seen this system. ·'The Napierian and Speidelian systems differ widely. In the Napierian the logarithms decrease as their corresponding numbers increase. The Napierian logarithm of 107 or 10 000 000 is zero. The logarithms of all numbers greater than 10' are negative; those of all numbers less than ·107 are positive, and the modulus of the Napierian system is very nearly equal to -1. In the Speidelian system the logarithms increase as their corresponding numbers increase-the logarithm of 1 is zero and the modulus of the system is +1. As the Speidelian system is m11cb used in the quadrature of the hyperbola, it is also called a system of hyperbolic logarithms, and its modnlus being 1 it is also called a system of natural logarithms. Baron Napier realized the complicated character of bis system, and that a system of logarithms with 10 as a base would be much simpler and better adapted to ordinary calculations. He began the computation of a table of logarithms upon this base, but his death prevented its completion. At his request his friend, Henry Briggs, professor of mathematics at Gresham College, completed and published in 1618 the first table of logarithms whose base is 10. This system is called, after its inventor, the Briggsian, or, more frequently, the c~.~I_~Wn system.
DESCRIPTION.

2. The logarithm of any number is the exponent of that power to which the base of the system must be rah1ed in order to produce the given number. Thus in the common system whose base is 10 we have 1016=10°··000 = v'lO, which is 3·1622777. Hence 0·5000000000 is the common logarithm of the mixed number 3·1622777. Again 10" =10°' 0666 + = ~ 10~ = -VlOO = 4·6415888. Hence 0·6666666666 is the common logarithm of the mixed number 4·6415888. 3. Let B =the base of any system of logarithms, N =any nnmber and x =the exponent of the power to which B must be raised, so that B·=N; (1) then will x be the logarithm of the number N.

Let x 1 =the logarithm of auy other uumber N' tilen B''=N'

(2)

Then by the rules that govern exponential quantities, if we multiply equations (1) and (2), member by member, we have B'+"=NN'. Therefore the sum of two or more logarithms will be equal to tile logaritilm of tile product of their corresponding numbers. 4. If we divide these equatious, member by member, we have ll,_,. = N/N': hence The difference of two' logarithms will be equal to the logarithm of the quotient of the corresponding numbers. 5. If we raise equatiou (1) to the second power or square, we have B'x 2 =N2 : hence The product of a logaritlun by any exponent will be the logarithm of that power of the corresponding number of which the exponent is the index. 6. If we extract the square root of equation (1) we have
r

B' = v'N: hence The quotient of a logarithm by any index will be the logarithm of that root of the corresponding number designated by such index. 7. It will be evident, therefore, that the use of logarithms simplifies arithmetical computations by substituting addition for multiplication, subtraction for division, multiplication for involutiou, and division for evolution. 8. The base of the common system of logarithms being 10, if we involve this base through all its successive powers we have: 10=10 1 hence 1 is the logarithm of lQ 10x10=10i=l00 lience 2 .ls the logaritilm of 100 10x10x10 =10 3 =1000 hence 3 is the logarithm of 1000 10x10x10 x 10 =10t=10000 hence 4 is the logarithm of 10000 &c. &c. Hence the logarithms of the integral or whole powers of 10 will be integral or whole numbers each equal to the exponent of the power. 9. If we evolve 10 through all its succe!>sive roots we have 10/10=10 1- 1 =10°=1 hence 0 is the logaritllm of 1 10/100=101- 2 =10-.1 =1/10 hence - 1 is the logarithm of 1/10 10/1000=101- 3 =10- 2 =1/100 hence - 2 is the logarithm of 1/100 10/10000=101-4= I0- 3 = 1/1000 hence - 3 is the logarithm of 1/1000
&~ &~

Hence the logarithms of the integral or whole roots of 10 are reciprocals with negative expouents. 10. The logarithms of all numbers greater than 1 and less than 10 will be greater than 0 and less than 1, that is, a proper fraction or decimal without an integer; the logarithms of all numbers greater than 10 and less than 100 will be greater than 1 and less than 2, that is, a mixed number whose integral portion will be 1. The integral portion of a logarithm is called its characteristic, the decimal portion is called the mantissa. 11. The logarithm of any fra-0tion may be expressed thus: Log 3/lO=log (l/10x3)=log 1/lO+log 3= -1+·4771212547 Log 3/lOO=log (1/100x3)=log 1/lOO+log 3= -2+·4771212547 Hence in the logarithms of fractions the characteristic only is negative and the mantissa positive. In order to indicate that the negative sign affects only the characteristic, the logarithms of

-

fractions are written with the negative sign placed over the characteristic, and the positive sign, preceding the mantissa, omitted. Thus: Log 3/10=1·4771212547. Log 3/100=2·4771212547. 12. Since shifting the decimal poiut to the right in any combination of numbers is equivalent to multiplying such combination by 10, and since the logarithms of the integral powers of 10 are integral or whole numbers (8), it is evident that the same combination of numbers will have the same mantissa and the characteristics only will change with the number of integral digits in that · number. Thus: Log 0·01234=2·0913151597. Log 0·1234=1·0913151597. Log 1·234 =0·0913151597. Log 12·34 =1·0913151597. Log 123·4 =2·0913151597. Log 1!?34 =3·0913151597. Hence in logarithmic tables only the mantissro are given. The clmmcteristics can always be readily determined by the following rules. 13. Since the logarithm of 1 is O, that of 10 is 1, that of 100 is 2, and that of 1000 is 3, (8), it is ev1deut that the characteristic of an integer or mixed munber is 1 less than the number of its integral digits; hence the Rule.-To find the characteristic of any integral or mixed number. Subtract unity, or 1, from the nnm ber of integral or whole digits; the difference will be the characteristic of the given number. Example.- What is the logarithm of 1093 'Y The mantissa for 1093 is ·0386201619. There are four digits in 1093, and 4-1 =3; hence the logarithm of 1093 is 3·0386201619 .. Exmnple.-Whatis the logarithm of 13·0;H The mantissa for 13·03 is ·1149444157. There are two integral digits in 13·03 and 2-1=1; hence the logarithm of 13·03 is 1·1149444157. 14. Since the logarithm of 1/10 or 0·1 is -1, that of 1/100, or 0·01, is - 2, that of 1/1000, or 0·001, is - 3, and that of 1/10000, or 0.0001, is - 4, (9), it is evident that the negative characteristic of a decimal fraction is always unity or 1 greater than the number of intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure; hence the--Rule.-To find t.he negative characteristic of any decimal fraction. Add unity, or 1, to the number of intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure, the sum will be the negative characteristic of the given decimal fraction. Example.-What is the logarithm of 0·11937 The mantissa for 1193 is ·0766404437. There are no zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure, and 0+1=1; hence the logarithm of 0·1193 is I·07G6404437. Example.-What is the logarithm of 0·0001021 7 The mantissa for 1021 is ·0090257421. There are 3 zeros intervening between the decimal point and the first significant figure, and 3+1=4; hence the logarithm of0·0001021 is 4·00!)02574~1.
DESCRIPTION OF THE TADLES.

15. In the accompanying logarithmic tables all the mantissro have been computed to twelve . places of decimals, and whenever the eleventh and twelfth plaees exceeded 50 the tenth place bas been increased by unity, or 1; hut whenever the eleventh and twelfth places were 50 or less than that number the tenth place has not been increased, · When these computations were begun, I was not aware that Baron Ge.orge von Vega had preceded me in his Thesauru& Logarithmorum Completus. But my own results have been carefully compared with those of Von Vega, and whenever any difference was detected the computation was made anew. In this way many serious errors (undoubtedly typographical) in Baron von Vega's tables have been discovered and corrected. The arrangement of Baron von Vega's tables is not as convenient as that given· in more modern tables, and therefore the accompanying tables are arranged in the same manner as the admirable tables published by Messrs. W. & R. Chambers, London and Edinburgh, 1885. In the following tables the mantissre are entered to ten places of decimals. In the first

column on tho left are entered, in consecutive order, the natural numbers beginning with !29.Q. and
extending to 9999. In the horizontal line at the top of the page are entered, in consecutive order, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In the second column on the left headed O, the mantissre

are entered to the tenth place of decimals, and whenever the eleventh and twelfth places exceed 50 the tenth place is increased by unity, or 1. But in order to economize space and save repetition the columns headed 1, 2, 3, etc., contain only the last seven figures of their respeutive mantissm. Hence, to complete the mantissm taken from these columns, the first three figures must be taken from the column headed O, either on the same horizontal line with the required mantissre, or on one or more of the lines above such horizontal line and prefixed to the last seven figures of the mantissre found in the columns headed 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. But whenever a black line is drawn QE!1' the last seven :figures of any mantissru found in the columns headed 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., the first three figures necessary to prefix to thes~ seven figures of the required mantissa must be taken from the column headed 0 in the horizontal line immediately under or below that on which the manti~sm of the given numbers are found. - --16. The ten columns on the right of the page, headed "Differences o, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.," are the differences between any two consecutive logarithms in the table and which will be found on the same horizontal line in juxtaposition with each other. Thus the difference between a logarithm in the column headed O and the logarithm on the same horizontal line in the column headed 1 will be found ou the same horizontal line in the column of differences headed 0. And the difference between a logarithm in the column headed l and that on the same horizontal line in the column lJeaded 2 will be found on the same horizontal line in the column of differences headed 1. The column of differences headed 0 contains the entire differences of six digits, but those lJeaded 1, 2, 3, etc., contain only the last three figures of such difference, and to those must be prefixed the first three figures taken from the column of differences headed o, either on the same hori- . zontal line or above that line, unless a black line is drawn above the last three figures in any column of difference, when the three figures to be prefixed to the given difference must be taken from the horizontal line below or under such difference in the column headed 0. Example.-What is the mantissa of 10011 As this mantissa will be the same (12) mantissa /);-with 10010 it will be found on the same horizontal line with the number 1001, and in the vertical column beaded 0. But only the last seven figures, viz, 4340775, are found in this column. But in the same column above this horizontal line are found the first three figures, 000, which must be prefixed to the seven already found, when the mantissa for 1001 becomes ·0004340775. Example.- What is the mantissa of 10022 T The last seven figures of this mantissa will be found on the same horizontal line with 1002 and in the vertical column headed 2, and are 9543984; to these must be prefixed the three figures found above this horizontal line in column headed o, which are 000. The mantissa of 10022 will therefore be ·0009543984. Example.-What is the mantissa of 10093T The last seven figures of this mantissa will be found on the sam~ horizontal line with 1009 and in the vertical column beaded 3, and will be 0~02733. But a black line is drawn over .these seven figures. The first three figures to be prefixed must on this account be taken from the horizontal line below that on which the last i;even figures of the mantissa are found. These first three figures will be 004, and the mantissa for 10093 will be ·0040202733. Example.- What is the difference between the mantissro of 10020 and 10021 T The mantissa of 10020 is ·0008677215 aud that of 10021 is ·0009110621. Their difference will be 433406. On the same horizontal line with 1002 and in the vertical column of differences headed O, the last three figures of this difference, or 406, are found. To these muRt be prefixed the firBt three figures found in the next line itbove in the vertical column of differences headed o, which are 433. The required difference between the mantissre of 10020 and 10021 will then be 433406. Example.-What is the difference between the mantissrn of 10051 and 10052 T The mantissa of 10051 is ·0022092730, and that of 10052 is ·00225247!:19. Their difference will be 432069. The three figtrres on the same horizontal line with 10051 and 10052 in the vertical column of differences head 0 are the last three figures of this difference 069, to which must be prefixed the first three figures in the vertical column of differences headed o, but two lines above the horizontal line of the figures 10051 and 10052. These first three figures are 432. The difference between the mantissrn for 10051 and 10052 will therefore be 432069. Example.-What is the difference between the mantissre of 10053 and 10054!

'rhe zeros annexed will not change the mantissa (12). The characteristics will be determined by rules already given (13, 14). Example.-What is the logarithm of 4T Annexing three zeros this becomes 4000, and on the same horizontal line with this number and ·in the vertical column headed 0 the mantissa will be fouud and will be ·6020599913. The given number being integral with but one digit will have a characteristic of 1-1=0. The logarithm of 4 will therefore be 0·6020599913. Example.- \Vhat is the logarithm of 0·37 Y Annexing two zeros this number becomes 3700, and on the same horizontal line with this number, in the left-hand column, and in the vertical column lleaued 0 the.mantissa will be found and will be ·5682017241. Tile number being a decimal fraction will have a negative characteristic of one more than the intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure. There being no intervening zeros, the negative characteristic will be 0 1=1. Therefore, the logarithm of 0·37 will be !·5682017241. Example.-What is the logarithm of 0·0483 f Annexing one zero this number becomes 4830, and on the same horizontal line with this number in the vertical column headed 0 the mantissa will be found to be ·6839471308. The number being a decimal fraction will have a negative characteristic of one more than the intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure. Therefore, the logarithw of 0·0483 will be 2·6839471308. 18. To find.the logarithm of any number containing four digits. Rule.-Look in the left-hand column headed "numbers" and on the same horizontal line with it, in the column beaded o, the required mantissa will be found.

To find the logarithm of any number containing more than five figures. Rule.-Find the mantissa for the firl!!t five figures by the rule already given (19). Consider all figures after the fifth as IJ_ecima~~· Multiply this decimal portion of the number by the difference foirnd in the table between the mantissa of the first five figures· and the next higher mantissa in the table. Point off the requisite numbers of decimals in the p'roduct and add the integi;itl portion of the product to the mantissa of the first five figures, and the sum will be the mantissa of the required number. If the figure in the first decimal place or tenths of the product exceeds// five, add unity or 1 to the units of such product; but if the figure in the tenth place is less than five reject the decimal portion of the product and add only the integral portion. The characteristic will be found by the rules already given (13, 14). The above rule is based upon the following principle: The differences given in the table correspond with an increase of 1 in the fifth place of any number. Hence the sixth place of any number will correspond with the tenths of such difference, the seventh place with hundredths, and. the eighth plaee with thousandths of such tabula::: differences; that is, all figures after the fifth place of any number will be decimals of the diif'erence given in the table. Example.-What is the logarithm of 4573:f275Y The mantissa of 45732 is found in the same boriz_ontal line with 4573, but in the vertical column headed 2, and is ·6G02201948:"' The last three figures of the difference between the mantissro of 45732 and 45733 are found in the column of differences beaded 2 and on the same horizontal line with 4573, and will be 964, to which must be prefixed the first two figures found in the horizontal line above the last three figures, but in the vertical column of differences headed o, and will be 94. The difference will therefore be 94964. Regarding the last three figures of the given number whose logarithm is required as decimals, and multiplying the difference by the deci~al we have 94964 x 0·275=26115·100. Then adding the integral portion, we have Mantissa of 45732= ·6602201948 Add integral portion of product 26115

Mantissa of 45732275= ·6602228063, sum. The number contains 8 figures wholly integral; the characteristic will therefore be positive and 8-1=7. Therefore the logarithm of 45732275 will be 7·GG022280G3. Example.-What is the logarithm of 0·000034572225 T The mantissa of 34572 will be found in the same horizontal line with the number 3457, but in the vertical column headed 2, and will be ·5387245043. The last three figures of the difference between the mantissa of 34572 and 34573 will be found in the column of differences on the same horizontal line with 3457, but in the vertical column beaded 2, and will be G19, to which must be prefixed the first three figures taken from the vertical column beaded O, above the horizontal line of the last three figures, and will be 125. The difference will be 125619. Regarding the last three figures of the given number whose logarithm is required as decimals and multiplying the difference by the decimal, we have 125G19 x 0·225, or a product of 28264·275.

The number is a decimal fraction with four intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure. The characteristic will therefore be negative and 4 + 1 = 5. The characteristic will therefore be 5. Therefore the logarithm of 0·000034572225 will be 5·5387273307. r 21. To find the number corresponding with a given logarithm.

COMPUTATION OF NEGATIVE CIIARACTERISTICS.

22. Computations of logarithms with negative characteristics are made in accordance with the rules of algebraic addition and subtraction, but it must be remembered that as the characteristics only are negative and the mantissm positive (11) all numbers carried forward from the mantissre are positive and must either be added to the positive characteristics or s~1btrac~ed from
the1~ones.

23. To add negative characteristics. Rule.-Add them together and give the sum a negative sign; but if any numbers are car· ried forward from the mautissre such numbers must bo 1mbtracted from eitl1t·r .of the negative characteristics.

28. The characteristic of a decimal fraction being negative and the mantissa positive {11) different portions of the same quantity are affected by opposite signs. This leads to confusion and error. If some method could be devised by which positive cliaracteristics can be given to the l11garithms of decimal fractious this confusion and error would be avoided. The arithmetical complement enables us to effect tbis change. 29. The arithmetical compl~ment of any number is the differeuce between that number and the unit of the next higher order; that is, the difference between the given number and unity, or 1, with as many zeros annexed as there are digits in the given number. Thus the arithmetical complement of 13 is 10-6=4; that of 18is100-18=82, and that of 245is1000-245= 755. 30. To find the difference between two numbers the less must be subtracted from the greaterand the remainder will be the difference. But the same result can be obtained by adding oue number to the arithmetical complement of the other, and from their sum deducting the unit by which the arithmetical complement was obtained. Thus, 25-6=19, also, 25+4-10=19; again, 92-18=74, also, 92+82-100=74; again, 350-245=105, also, 350+755-1000=105. Hence by substituting the arithmetical complement of the negative characteristic of a decimal fraction for tbe negative characteristic of such decimal fraction we can ,change the sign of such characteristic from negative to positive. 31. Tliis change can be effected by the following rule: Rule.-Subtract the negative characteristic from 10, t11e difference will be the required arithmetical complement of such 11egntive characteristic and will also be the positive characteristic required, or Subtract the nu111ber of intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure from 9; the differeuce will be the required positive characteristic; and should such intervening zeros exceed 9 subtract such number of intervening zeros from 19. Any decimal fraction with 9 intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure, as 0·0000000001 is Tuoo"<rA-"<rnp-0·01 or one ten thousand millionth part of unity or 1. This quantity is so very small that in 1all 1computations with logarithms of decimal fractions with pol'itive characteristics it is usual to retain only the units and reject the teu" of such positive characteristics.

Example.-Wbat is the logarithm of 0·125 with a negative and also with a positive characteristic! With a negative characteristic it is 1·0969100130 With a positive characteristic it is 9·0969100130
In both cases the mantissa is the same, but the characteristics are each the arithmeti<:al complement of the other. The negative characteristic being (14) one more than the number of the intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure is o+ 1 =L The positive characteristic being the arithmetical complement of the negative characteristic (31) i~ 10-1=9, and also being the difference between 9 and the number of the intervening zeroi;; between (31) the decimal point and the first significant figure is 9-0=9. Example.-What is the logarithm of 0·000000000345 with a negative and also with a positive chara-cteristic 7 With a negative characteristic it is 10·5378190051 With a positive characteristic it is 0·5378190951 Both mantissro are alike, and the characteristics only differ. There being 9 intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure, the negative characteristic will be !l+l=lO, and the positive characteristic will be 9-9=0. 32. The arithmetical complement of the characteristic only of a logarithm, in order to chan~:-e such characteristic from negative to positive, must not be eonfounded with the arithmetical complement of the entire logarithm. In the first case the arithmetical complement of the characte1·istic only is taken, the mantissa remaining unchanged, and in the second case the arithmetical complement of the entire logarithm, tliat i8, of both characteristic and mantissa is taken. 33. The arithmetical complement of the entire logarithm of any number is the logarithm of the reciprocal of that number, or the logarithm of unity or 1 divided by the given number. If the number is integral or mixed and not fractional, such logaritl1m of a reciprocal will be that of a decimal fraction with a positive characteristic. This arithmetical complement of an entire logarithm is often mied in logarithmic computations, and is thus determined: To find the arithmetical complement of an entire logarithm. Rule.-Subtract the characteristic and mantissa of the given logarithm from 10; the d ifti·r<>11ce will be the required arithmetical complement; or, Be~iuning on the left, subtract the characteristic and each digit of the gi.Jen logarithm, except tlrn last significant digit, from 9, but subtract the last, or last significant digit, from 10; the difference will bo the required arithmt>tical complement.

If the logarithm of either divisor or dividend is that of a decimal fraction with a negative characteristic, change the sign of the characteristic of the divisor from plus to minus or from minus to plus and proceed as in addition (23, 24), and if any numbers are borrowed from the mantissm such numbers must either be subtracted from the positive or added to the negative characteristic. If any qua.ntitie;, are decimal fractions with positive characteristics. or if the characteristic ot tlie divisor iA less than the characteristic of the dividend, 10 must be borrowed for the characteristic of the dividend and the units of the characteristic of the difference only retained aud the teus r~jected.

40. If the logarithm of a number is divided by any number the quotient will be the logarithm of that root of the corresponding number of which the divisor is the index (6). Hence evolution can be performed by the following: Rule.-Divide the logarithm of the given number by the index of the root; the quotient will be the logarithm of the required root. · If the given number is a decimal fraction and its logarithm bas a negative characteristic not divisible by the index of the required root, add to the negative characteristic such a number as will make it a multiple of the given index of the root, and prefix to the mantissa a like positive number to that added to the negative characteristic, and divide tbe negative characteristic and the mantissa with the positive number prefixed by the index of the required root; the quotient will be the logarithm of the required root. If the given number is a decimal fraction and its logarithm has a positive characteri8tic, subtract unity or 1 from the given index of the root and prefix the difference to the positive characteristic and divide by the index of the required root. The quotient will be the logarithm of the required root (27). ... Example.-What is the cube root of 226981 T T . . 5·3559895050 "' _ 1 78 39983 0 he logarithm of 226981is5·3559895050.

INTERPOLATION OF SERIES.

44. When numbers are calculated by formula and arranged in regular series (as tbey are in a table of logarithms of numbers) the logarithm of any intermediate number may be found by interpolation of series. This method is as follows: Take from the logarithmic table the logarithms of four consecutive numbers in regular series, the two which precede and the two which follow that of the required number. From these logarithms find the three first difierences, the two second diflere11ces, and the mean of the second differences as shown in the subjoined table. The required logarithm can be determined by the following formula, in which L= the required logarithm, l= the logarithm of the nearest less number in the table, f- the fractional interval exceeding the nearest less number, d= the second or central one of the three first differences, and d 1 = the mean of the two second differences. Then L=l+f(d+f2l d1) Example.-H:wing in the table of logarithms the consecuti\-e numbers 1034, 1035, 1030, and 1037, it is required to find the logarithm of 1035·5.

45. In a table of logarithms of numbers the logarithms of the prime nnmbers only need be computed. The logarithms of composite numbers can be found by addiug t\Je logitritbms of their factors. Then the logarithm of any number being kuown, we can determine all its powers (39) and also its reciprocal (33). Indeed we can go further, and since the mantissm of the same arrangement of numbers, whether integral or fractional, are the same (12) we can find the mantissm of other numbers. Thus, knowing the mantissa of the number 2, we can ah;o find that of 4, since 4 is the square of 2. We can also find the mantissa of 5, since 2/4=0·5. 'fhe mantissa of 0·5 is found by subt1:acting the logarithm of 4 from that of 2, the difference will be the mantissa of 5. We can also find 5 as a reciprocal, 1/2=0·5, so that the arithmetical complement of the mantissa of 2 will be the mantissa of 0·5 (33). Thus the mantissa of 2 being ·3010299957 and 2 x ·3010299957 =·6020599914 is the mantissa of 4; also ·3010299957 -·6020599!)14=·6989700043, rejecting the characteristic, is the mantissa of .5. We also have determined the mantissa of 5 as a reciprocal, since 1/5=0·2. Hence 10·0000000000 ·3010299957, rejecting tbe characteristic, becomes ·6989700043, which is the mantissa of 5.

CIROULA.R FUNCTIONS.

48. Angles are measul'ed by the arc of a circle inclosed between their sides, the angular point being at the center of the circle. Thus (Fig.1) the angle DC Eis measured by the arc AB, whose center is at the angular point C. , For the measurement of angles the entire circumference of the circle is D divided into 360 degrees, each degree into 60 1ni11utes, and each minute into 60 Reconds. If two diameters of a circle are drawn at right angles to each other they will divide the circle into four equal parts, each of which will be

c

~

= 900.

Hence every right angle is measured by an arc of 90°.

4-9. The complement of any angle is the difference between that angle and 900. Thus the complement of 350 is 90° - 35° = li5°, and that of 25° is 900 - ~50 = 650, and that of 750 is 900 - 750=15°. 50. The supplement of any angle is the difference between that angle and E 1800. Thus the supplement of 48° is 1soo - 480=13~0, and that of 760 is Fig. I. 18.00 - 760 = 1040. 51. The sides of plane triangles are straight lines, and are therefore determined and compared . by linear measure whose unit is the foot or metre. The angles of such triangles are measured by arcs of circles, and therefore compared by circular measure whose unit is the degree. There is no com· mon standard to which the foot or metre and degree can be referred and by which they can be compared. H Mathematicia118 are therefore compelled .to refer D the angles of plane triangles to certain straight Jines which are functions of circular arcs by which ang'les are measured, and are hence called circular functions. As these U.nes are absolutely necessary · in the computations of triaugle1:1, they are also called trigonometrical functions. There are six circular or trigonometrical func· tions, namely: The eine, the cosine, the tangent, the cotangent, the secant, and the cosecant. E ,, The cosine, cotangent, and cosecant are complements (49) the s.ine, tangent, and secant, the prefix Fig. 2. co being au abbreviation of the word complement. 52. From D (fig. 2) let fall the ll~rpe11diculal' DC upon the line AE, and from the point of · intersection 0 describe the semicircumfere11ce .A.BDE. Then the arc ABDE will be one of 1800, the arcs DE and AD will each be a quadrant or quarter of a circle, and the angles ACD and. ECD will each be a right angle. .Also the arc .AB will be the co,mplement of the arc BD (49). The arc .AB will also be the supplement (50) of the arc BDE. 53. The sine of an arc or an angle is the perpendicular let fall from one extremity of that arc upon the diameter drawn through the other extremity. Thus BF (fig. 2), is the sine of the arc .AB or of the angle BC.A. 54. The cosine of au arc is the sine of its complement; therefore, as BD (fig. 2) is the comple· ment of .AB (49), BK the sine of BD is the cosine of the arc .AB or of the angle ACB. But BK= CF. Hence the cosine of an arc is the line drawn from the center of the circle to the foot of the sine or CF. 55. The tangent of au arc or angle is a line drawn from one extremity of au arc at right angles to the diameter drawn through such extremity, and continued thence until it intersects the

line drawn from the center of the circle through the other extremity of sncb arc. Thus AH is the tangent of the arc AB (fig. 2) aud UL the ta11g-e11t of the arc BD. 513. The cotangent of an arc is the tangent of the complement of that arc. Thus DL (fig.'..!), which is the tangent of the arc DB, is the cotangent of the arc .AB. 57. The secant of an arc is tbe line drawn from the center of the circle through one extremity ot· the arc until it intersects the taugent. touching the other extremity. Thus CH (fig .. 2) is the secant of AB and CL is the o;ecant of BD. 58. The cosecant of an arc is tile secant of the complement of that arc. Thus CL (fig. 2), which is the s«.>cant of the arc BD, is the cosecant of the arc AB. 59 .. From the preceding 1lefinitions we deduce the followinp; obvious results, viz: (a) Between oo and 90° the sine, taugcnt, and secant increase as the arcs it1crease, and the cosine, cotangent, and cosecant decrease as the arcs increase. (b) When the arc is one-eighth of a circle or 45°, the sine and cosine are equal, the tangent and cotangent are equal, and the secant and cosecaut are also equal. The tangent aud cotangent of 45° are also each equal to the radius. (c) When the arc is o0 , its cosecant aud cotangent are each infinite, its sine and tangent are each zero, audits secant and cosine are each <>qnal to the radius. (d) When the arc is a quadrant or fl0°, its sine null cosecant are each eqnal to the radius, its tangent and secant are infinite, aud its cosine and cotangent are each zero. GO. Tlle triangles BCF and ACH (fig. 2) being equiangular, are similar and their homologous sides proportional. Thus BF: CF:: HA: CA or Sine: Cosine: : Tangent: Radius. l\Iakiug radius equal to unity or 1, we eliminate that quantity and the eQuation becomes T t Sine C . T angen =cosine' ,osme x angent =

s·me, all(l Co~me . Sine = T!iilgeilt'

H1>rn~e if the logarithmic cosine is subtracted from the logarithmic sh1e of any arc the difference will be the logarithmic tangent of that arc. 61. In the triangles CDL and ACH we have CA: All:: DL: DC, or Radius: Tangent:: Cotangent: Radius. Making radius equal to unity or 1, we have
'I' au gent= Cotangent l l an dC otangent =Tangent'

Hence the tangent and cotangent are reciprocals of each other, and the logarithm of one is the arithmetical complement of the other (33). 62. In the triangles CBF and .ACR (fig. 2) we have OF: CA:: CB: CH or Cosine: Radius:: Radius: Secant. Making radius unity or 1, we have Cosine=- - - and Secant= - J,-. Secant Cosme Hence cosine and secant are reciprocals of each other and the logarithm of one is the arithmetical complement of the other. 6:3.

DESCRIPTION OF TABLE OF CIRCULAR FTTNOTIONS.

G5. In most tables of logarithmic circular functions the radius of the measuring circle is assumed at 10 10 or 10 000 000 ooo, for the purpose of dispensing with negative characteristics. But ·as in all other· formulre relative to the circle, the radins is assumed as unity or 1, and as in

tletermining the natural circular functions the radius of the measnring circle is also unity or I, this new value of the radius is apt to mislead. Nor is this uew value of radius necessary, siuce the radius of tl1e measuriug circle c~rn be assumed as unity or 1, provitled all 11atural functions less than uuity or 1 are regarded as decimal fractions whose logarithms have positive cl1aracteristics (.'31). This table contains the logarithmic value of :111 the uatural functions from oo to !!0°, the radins of the measuring circle beiug unity or 1, and for every natural function less than unity or 1 the logarithm given in this table is that of a decimal fraction with a positive characteristic. Thus the natural siue of 0° 6' 8" to a radius of unity or 1, is 0·0017841134, whose logaritlim, with a negative characteristic is 3·2514224550, but with a, positive characteristic this lwconws 7·2iH42245;iO. Hence the logarithmic sine of oo 6' 8" is 7·2514224550. The natural cosecant; of oo 1' is 3437·'(468, whose logarithm is 3·5362738891. He.JlcP, 1he logarithmic cosecant of o0 1' is 3·5362738891. The natural secant of 39° 30' is 1 ·~H5Hli7, whoi:;e logarithm is 0·1125939445. Hence, the logarithmic secant of 39° 30' is 0·112593944;}. 'l'he natural tangeut of 20 1' is 0·0:{52120154, whose lo6a1·ithm with a uegath·e el1araeteristic is ~·5466008831, but with a positive characteristic this IJccomes 8·5466908831. Heuce, the logarithmic tangent of 20 1' is 8·5466908831. ln these table:; the logarithmic secaut nnu cosecallt are given as well as the logarithmic sine, cosi11e, tange11t, a11d cotangt·ut. 66. In the following table the logarithmic functions are given to the nearest second for all arcs le.~s thau ~ 0 and greater than sso, and to the nearest 10 seconds for an arcs greater than 20 and less tl1an sso. For a1l arcs from oo to 450 the name of the function will be found at the top of the page a11d the minutes aud seconds in the column on the left, which must be read from the top downward. For all arcs from 45° to 90° the nan;ie of the fm1ction will be found at tbe bottom of the page and the minutes and seconds in the columns on the rig·ht which mnst be read from the bottom upward. 67. The sine aud coseca11t, tangeut and cotangent, secant and cosine, being each t11e reciprocal of the other (61, 62, 63) the logarithm of each will be the arithmetical complement of tbe other (33) and their respective differences for 1 second will also be equal. These differences for 1 second being common to both functions are therefore placed between the colunms containing· these respective functions. Whenever the name of the given function is found at the head of the· page and the column under that name is read downward, the difference for 1 second between the nearest logarithmic function found in the table and the next greater or less logarithmic function found ill the table in the column of differences for 1 second, will be found on the same horizontal line witl1 tbe nearest logarithmic function found in the table. But whenever tile name of the given function is found at the bottom of the page and the column above that name is read upward the difference for 1 :-:;econd, uetween the nearest logarithmic function found in the table and the lll'Xt greater or less logarithmic function found in the table will be found in the column of differences fol' 1 second on the next horizontal line above tliat of the nearest logarithmic function found in the table.

N.A.TUR.A.L FUNCTIONS.

76. When the radius of the measuring circle is unity or 1, the functions are called natural functions. The radius of the table of logarithmic circular functions annexed hereto being also unity or 1 (65), the various quantities giYen in that table are the logarithms of the natural functions. Hence the natural functions of any arc can be found by the.following R1tlc.-Take from the table the logarithmic circular function for the given arc by the rules already given (68, 69). Find the number corresponding to such logarithm by the rule already given (21), and such number will be the natural function of the given arc. 77. In the application of the rule it must be remembered that(a) When the arch; 90°, its sine, being equal to radius, (59 d) is unity or 1, and the sines of all arcs less than 900 are less than unity or 1 and are, therefore, decimal fractions. (b) When the arc is 0°, its cosine, being equal to radius (5!) c), is unity or 1, and the cosines of all arcs greater than 0° are less than unity or 1 and are, therefore, decimal fractions. (c) When the arc is 45°, its tangent, being equal to radius (59 b), is unity or 1, and the ta11ge11ts of all arcs greater than 45° are greater than unity or 1, or mixed numbers, and the taug·ents of all arcs less than 450 are less than unity or 1 and are, therefore, decimal fractions. (d) When the arc is 45°, its cotangent, being eqnal to radius (59 b), is unity or 1, and the cotangents of all arcs less than 45° are greater than unity or 1, or mixed numbers, and the cotangents of all arcs greater than 45° are less than unity or 1 aud are, therefore, decimal fractious. (e) When the arc is 0°, its secant, being equal to radius (59 c), is unity or 1, aud the secants of all a1·cs greater than 0° are greater than unity or 1, or mixed numbers. (f) When the arc is 900, its cosecant, being equal to radius (59 d), is unity ur 1, and the cosecants of all arcs less than 90° are greater than unity or 1, or mixed numbers. Example.-\Vhat is the natural sine of o0 1' 2" Y 6·4779665497 is the logarithmic sine of 0° 1' 2" ·4779600801 is the nearest-less logarithm and its corresponding number is 30058. 64696 The difference of these logarithms is 64696, and the tabular difference is 144483, and

that of a decimal fra-Otion with a positive characteristic (65). The positive characteristic 6, therefore, by reversing the rule already given (31), requires three intervening zeros between the decimal point and the first significant figure, since 9 - 6 = 3. The natural sine of oo 1' 2" will therefore be 0·00030058447776 · .Example.-What is the natural cosine of S9° 4S' S" Y

This cosine being greater than o0 , is less than unity or 1 (77 b). The logarithm of this cosine is, therefore, that of a decimal fraction with a positive characteristic (65). Tl.le positive characteristic 7, therefore, reversing the rule already given (31 ), requires two intervening zeros between the decimal point aud the first significant figure, since 9 - 7 = 2. The natural cosine of 89° 4S' 8" will, therefore, be 0·003451866.'1541. .Example.-What is the natural tangent of 50 Hi' 10" 1

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

NoTE.-The 'tabular difference between the mantissre of any two- consecutive numbers should decrease as the numbers increase, but in the foregoing table there are occasional exceptions to this rule, due to the fact that wherever the eleventh and twelfth _places of any mantissa exceed 50, the tenth place is increased by unity or 1. Sometimes when a mantissa whose tenth place has been increased by unity or 1 is followed by a mantissa whose tenth place is not so increased, the tabular difference of such mantissro will exceed the tabular difference of the preceding m~ntissro. Thus in the table the difference between the mantissro corresponding to the numbers 90005 and 9005L is 48227, while that between the mantissoo corresponding to the numbers 90051 aud 90052 is 48228. Here the greater numbers have the greater difference, which is theoretically incorrect. · As given in the table-Numbors.

Tabular di1forence

As the eleventh and twelfth places in the mantissa difference exceed 50, unity or 1 should be added to the tenth place, and the di1forence then becomes 48228 and not 48227, as given in the table.

Tabular <l ifference

As the eleventh and twelfth places in the mantissa difference are less than 50, nothing is added to the tenth plane, an<l tile difference then will be 48227 and not 48228, as given in the table. In selecting the Ieist ·of two evils it has been deemed prudent to choose the differences between the consecutive mantissru actually given in the table in preference to those which would result were the mantissoo given to thirteen places.
