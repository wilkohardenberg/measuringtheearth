COAS'l' SURYEY OFFICE,

lrasliiugton, D. C., December 1:2, 1871. Sm: I hiwe the honor to present this detailed report, showing the opcratious of the parties allot· ted for tbe snrwy of the coast during the year ending with the month of October, auu incltHling in a few cases mention of work carried on until this date. It is a distiuguishing feature of the serdce under my charge, that while it has a specific and tlirect object i11 its hearing· on the interesfa of commerce aml navigation, 1he performance iII>ohe,; operations and inYestigations which almo::;t riyal in Yalue the primary function of the surwy. The methods and processes used ha\·e been at all times the be::;t afforded by science and art, and the form of publication bas gained in accuracy and beauty, so that our ebarts from the first llaYe been unsurpassed lJy any wllich haYe been elsewhere produced. The metllods of astronomical obsen·n. tion employed in tlle snrYey are now nnh"ersally adopted, and ha,-e greatly increased the precision with which elements of the relatiYe position of placeR upon il1e Par1l1 are determined. Our cleep-:sea explorations ha Ye incidentally opened new worlds of discoyei·5· to the naturalist and the physicist '.rlie laws of the tides and of the distribution of magnetism have been traced with increased distinctness, ~tnd have lJeen made more intelligible lJy the obsen·ations made in tile progress of the sun·ey. And, in tbe general mention of incidental advantages, it may be added tllat the necessary connection betwceu the geodetic operations upon the two sides of the continent giYes opportnnity, the suggestion of wliich cannot he justly ornittt>d, to take stPps for the gemle.tic sune_y of the connt.r,r as the essential foundation of all local sun·eys, topographical or geological. It opens, moreon'r, the opportunit.Y of extending to the States of the interior benefits similar to those which haYe already been afforded to States on the sea-uoard. The interest manifested in a few determinations of geographical position within the yt·:u in the 'Yesteru States shows a full appreciation or' the ltthantage that must inure from extendc1l operations similar in kind, in the local t1e\·elopment of that great re.gion. The few points at the west wrn- in geodetic relation with 8Ueh a>; ba\·e lwen <lctc>r· mined in the progress of the surYeJ of the cowst will lm mentioned in the followi11g general summary, whichi s given in accordance with the usage in previous reports. It will be seen tlrnt, wit11 the exception of Delaware and Alabama, the survey lrns been in progress in all the sea-board and Gulf States, and that determinations lia\·e been made of latitude aud longitude at c.0veral l>Oints in the interior. In corn·spondeuce witll the order gi\'Cn in this brief statt·nwut, tlte hocl.r of the 1·eport will contain sl10rt abstracts of the operations in each site of work. On the coast of 1\Iaiue the topographical suryeys inclnde Somes Sound and South west. Harbor; several of the Fox Islands which lJound Seal Harbor, and others at the entrance of Penobscot Ba.r; the western sliore of that bay between Camden and Belfast and Isleboro', near the entrance to 11elfast. Bay ; the shores of Andr-0scoggi11 and Cathauce Hivers between Brunswick and llowdoinllam; tl1c shore:; of the Saco; and the coast northward to Spurwink l{irer. 'l'he bydrography has developed J>rospect, Harbor, and the ledges in tbe vicinity of l\loose-a-bec Heach; Somes Sound inclndiug 1:-\onthwest Harbor; Seal Ea.y and the western channel of Peuobscot Bay between Camden aud Belfast; Gilki·~-'s Harbor at Isleboro'; ledges near the Fox Islands; the lower part>i of the Androscoggin and Catha1:ce UiYers; the Yicinity of Cape Porp-0ise and Stage Island; Winter Harbor; the approaches to Saco River; and the-present condition of harbors ge11erally between Cape Small Point and lfol:lton, with reference to accuracy in the sailing directions. Tidal observations ha\·e been continued at ~orth Haven in Penobscot Bay, and at the Boston 11ary-yard. Points !Jaye been determined by triangulation on the Androscoggin and Cathance Rivers ; aml others in geodetic connection with primary stations in New Hampshire. At Oambridge, Mass., astronomical observations were made to <lder1 c s

HEPORT OF THE SUl'ElUNTENDENT OP mine longitutle at Be\'Cral points in the "restern States. Special examinations at Edgartown, fineyard Hiwen, antl Nantucket Harbor, were conducted with a view to determine the causes which afiect the ltarhor facilities. Plane-table work done in Rhode Island completes the detailed surniy of Narragansett Bay,inc1udiug the coast in the vicinity of l'oint Judith. l'oints have been determined for exteuding- the topography ·n·stward. Station-marks along the coast of Connecticut and J,ong lslaud lmni beeu examiued with l'eference to their 1nesernttion. Tlie triangnlatiou and topography in this section include work near New Haven; the shore-line surTey of the greater part of Lake (]hamplaiu, aJHl the den>lopment of its channels between Burlington, Yt., and Plattsburgh, ~. Y. Special 11.r<lrogrnpliic operations have been conducted in Hudson l{,iver, and in New York Harbor, including tidal ohsenations; and the survey of Newark Hay has lleen extended to include tile mtrigable rfrers which enter it. In New Jersey the field·work comprise<! operations in the vicinity of 1\Iount Holly, Great Bay, and Httle Egg Ilarhor. In Delaware Hiver a close hydro· graphic surwy develops the vicinity of League Island, and the lower part of the Schuylkill. The sites of work in l\Iaryland and Vi1ginia are the Broadwater on the Atlantic coast, Calvert Stat.ion, Tangier Island, aud ·wolf Trap, i11 Ul1esapcake Bay; the Severn, Chester, and Choptank Uivers; ,James BiYer, au<l tidal observatiom;, as herntofore, at Old Point Comfort. The main triangulation has been continued along the Illuenidge, and magnetic observations have been recorded at Washiugton, D. C. On the coast of Nol'tlt Ca.roliua the survey hati been a~lYanced by additional work i11 the waters of Pamr1lico Sound; latitude, azimuth and magnetic observations near Portsmouth, N. C.; the de\·elopment of Pamplico Hh·er to the vicinity of '\Yashington; soundings on Uie Hatteras Shoal, antl the plaue·tahle suryey of Bogue Sound and the a1ljacent coast. Progress has heen made OH the coast of South Carolina by the development of parts of the Corubahee, Chechesse, and ·wright's Bircr, with ot!Jcrs in the system of inside sea-water channels. On the coast of Georgia and I<'lorida, t}ie work of the year includes Amelia and Talbot Islaml, the shores and approaches from sea,nird of Nassau Sound, the sea-water channels between the Saint Mary's and Saint John's Jti,·ers, and l\Iatanzas Hi\·er below Saint Augustine. Further dernlopment lias been made by hydrographic operations in the yicinity of the Tortugas. On the Gulf coast the principal channel at Cedru: Keys was sounded, as also the uufinished part of Saint George's Sound ; other operations were conducted at Saint Joseph's Bay and Saint Andrew's Bay. Farther westward the Gulf coast,, including Santa Rosa Sound, was de\"'eloped from Cboctawhatchee entrance to the entrance of Pensacola llay. l u the interior of tltis section, latitude, longitude, and the magnetic elements were deterrninetl at Clendand aml Columbus in Ohio, and at Falmouth, Oakland, and Shelbyville in Kentucl·y. On the Gulf coast the eastern part of I,ake Pontchartrain was sounded. Operations on the coast of Louisiana include part of the Chandelenr Islands, the l\Iississippi Ufrer to Point La Hache, the Gulf approaches to the llelta of that river, and h;ydrographic work in the vfoinity of Trinity Shoal. ln the interior of this sectiou poiuts have l>eeu determined by triangulation across the Mississippi HiYer in the vicinity of Saint Louis. On the coast of Texas the hydrographic work has been completed in ~fatagon1a Bay and its branches, and soundings have been extended southwanl iu its c01mecti11g waters. In the interior of this section observations were made for latitude and longitude at Chetopa, in Karnms. On the coast of J,mver California some positions have been determined in advance of the hythographic reconnaissance, which is int.ended for developing the dangers in navigation between Panama aud San Diego. A special survey has been made within the year at Magdalena Bay. Operations north of Sau Dit·go include in triangulation, topography, or hydrograpby the coast of California, at Bahia Oua, and a stretch in tbe Yicinity of Point Conception; Santa Barbara Island; San Miguel Island; the Yicinity of San Luis Obhipo, am} San Simeon; soundings in the approaches of San J<'rancisco Bay, aud oLhers by the same party in the neighborhood of a reported shoal in the Pacilic; bydrogTaphic dtwelopments insi<le of San Francisco Bay; the survey of the north side of tlie entrance; additional work at Oakland; and tidal observations at San Diego and San Francisco. }forth of that port the field-work bas been continued near l\iendocino Bay and near Shelter CO\·e; in the vicinity of the False Klamath, and at Crescent City; and astronomical and magnetic ohserrntions have been made at San Diego, San Francisco, Eureka, and Crescent City. At the request of the Department, special tests were made of the coin weights in use at the branch mint in San Francisco.

The triangulation, topography, and hsdrography haye beeu adYanoed also in the Strnit of Fuca,, and in Admiralt_y Inlet, and several local Sllr\'eys l1ave beeu made in those waterR. On tbe western coast the season was generally unfa,·orable for fielu 01wratio11s on account of higli winds, bea>y fogs, and the smoke from bnming foresLs iu Oregon anti in \\'ashington Tenitory. Nevertheless, the work done is beyond the aYerage of past seasons. Long·itude ha8 been determined within the year at San Dit.>go and at Seattle, so tlmt the most re mot(· detache<l trianp:nlations on the racific Uoast are now in kuown geographical rplation. ~\storia a1Hl Em·t·kt will lw ascertained in longitude when telegraphic facilities permit. There is now a large extent of well-defined shore-line ready for tlw operati011s of the hy1lrngraphic party, which is at present on the passage to Sau Francisco, arnl prnd<letl with an amplt· outfit for. off-shore soundings. "\Vben the appropriation for the present fiscal year tecame available, a party, prp\·ionsly orga11izecl, was sent from San Fraucisco, without delay, to make such uerelopment in hy<lrog-raphy: and such other observations of interest and value as may be practicable in the vicinity of tlte Aleutian Islands, off the coast of Alaska. The party sailed in .August, !mt there is yet no a1hice of tht> arrkal of the vessel at her destination. Within the year laborious computations ha\'e been completed, giYing fiual Yaltws for the long·itude of points intermediate between the Atlantic and tl1e l'aeitic Coasts. Of theRe, tl1<" principal ones are OmalJa, Salt Lake City, and San :Francisco. Computations are in progress for ueterrnining the transathtntic longit1uk, which <kllClltlil upon the observations made last year at Brest and Duxbury. The discussion is continued, of full series of ti1lal obsen·ations, with refere11cc to th<' com;t.rnction of tables of prediction. In the Coast-SurveJ· Office the operations of the sm·er:tl !li dsions luwe kept pace with the lit·lilwork. Twenty new charts have been published, incltulinv, three new editions of charts made uee<lfnl by extensive changes. Fifty-eight charts have l>een in hand in the drawing tliYision, of which nine were commenced within the year. Of the various engraYetl charts, about ten thousand copic" have be~n printed, and an eqnal number of copies <listrillntecl from the Oflict>. Of tllc manuscript maps on file in the archives, sixty-six have been copied or tracetl withi1t the ~-ear, to meet call;; for information from various branches of the public service. Tide-tables for the ports of the United States, for the ,year 1872, haye l>een computed and issued from the Office. In the hydrographic division, special care has been taken in regard to the marked places of buoys on the published charts. Most of the sea-mttrks liable to shift !Jave beeu carefull;y determined in position, aml marked on the charts which atlmitted of such changes without (1etrimeut to the sailing directions. Specifications for the construction of several steam-vessels and schoone.rs, to replace 1mch as had been worn out in the service, were carefully 0.rawu up by the hydrogrnphic inspector, wlleu means became available under the appropriation for that object. The smaller vessels were completed first, and went iuto service in the winter of 1870. "\Vithin the present year two steam-n~ssels were fitted out, and are now emplo.yed in the duty for which they were internle(l. The iuterual aITangements of all the new nissels are mlmirallly adapted to the 1le111a11ds of tl1c service. Their qualities as sea-boats and fa.'lt sailers Juwe testilieil t,o t.he PxcPllencP of their mmlt·ls and to the ability of Captain Patterson as a naval constructor. The iron steamer Hassler, intended for hydrographic serYice on the Pacific coast of the United States, was launched at Kaighn's Point, N. J., on the l~th of Septemller of' the present year. "Wbile the hull of the "\essel was under construction, the officer detailed by the honorable Secretary of the Navy for the command of the hydrographic party gave personal attention to the detail;; specified in the plan of the hydrographic inspector. As soon as possible the steampr was rigged for sea, and at the encl of October trial was made of the engine in a run from I'hiladelphia to BostQn. Commander Johnson was entirely satisfied with the performance of the Yessd as a sea-

This unequaled econom.r in fnel desen·es attention, which will donbtless be mor1· closely attracted hy the worki11g of' other engines similar to that now in the steamer Hassler. The riggi11g, outfit, an1l final adjustment of the machinery of the skamer fur a long ,-oyage · were completed at the Charlestown navy-yard, where also the magnetic condition of the ship was 1inally tested, with reference to the use of compasses in steering at sea. This important service was performed by Assistant Charles A. Schott, ai<led by Dr. Thomas Hill, of 'Valtham, Mass. The oflic<'rs of the vessel are fully informed in regard to tlie means requisite for maintaining the effectil·e nse of tbe C()lll passes. The steamer Ilassler is a three-ma.stetl screw-propeller of three hundred and fifty tons, aud is helievcd to he in all respects admirably designed for gent'ral bydrographic sen'ice. Incidental duty, in which tl1e Yei'isel is now employed, will be briefly mentioned under the next head. The secoml steamer, buil.t arnl fitted out under the snpen·ision of the h~·drographic inspector, and 1lesignr<l ~or liydrographic work o.n the coast of the Atlantic and 1yJ1)f of :Mexico, is of two hundred arnl e1gl1ty tons burthen. This \essel was launched in Aogusti..~tn<l was named after the late Superintendent A. D. Baclie. The hytlrographic party now on board, under Lieutenant Commander .Tobu A. Howell, U. S.

In general the yesRcl will hn employed for oIT-shore h,ydrography, in gathering material for the Iargpr sailing charts.
VOYAGE OF THE COAS'l'·SCRVEY Sl'BA}lE!t HASSLER.

As already me11tioued, the Hassler was plannml and. built for hytlrngrapbic sen-ice on the western coast of the United States. In her transfer from tlie Atlantic side the intelligent and en er_ getic officers detailed hy the honornble Secretary of the K avy for duty in that vessel would un. tlonbtedly lmye made valuable observations; they wonld have continued the researches which were commenced by officers of the Uoast Survey upon the phenomena of the ocean, and which haw· become the stimulus to general scientific inquiry. The deep-sea soundings bayc suggested tlw existence of intimate rclatious between the currents anll natural channels of tlie ocean; the dre<lg·ingR have brought to light new fauna peculiarly related to the natural history of the globe; and <o>Yen the temperatures arnl clensities of the ocean at various depths, and in c1iiierent localities, appear to be subject to laws worthy of the most carcfal investigatio11. Other nations ham recognized the significance of the facts first developed by the Coast Survey, and have pursued corr<>8ponding inquiries under conditions much lesfl opportune than those presented by tlJC incidental ,·o.Yagc of the steamer IIassler around Cape Horn. But it is evident that wliate\·er general intereRt may be felt b.r the Na,·y officers on board, aIHl howen·r anxious they may be to colleet data, their labors mm~t he greatly facHitated by the assistance of those who have advanced, through years of patient study and comparison, towanl the end sought in such im·estigatious. 'Vithout the co-ope· ration of men eminent i11 science, the ·o;rage would he much restricted in time, and correspondiugl_y rPstricted in special results. I therefore felt it to be a dut,y not to limit this voyage to the lem~t requirements of rntYigation, lint to take advantage of the occa,sion for the solution of momentous questions, or at least to a1ld somet11ing to the knowledge 110\f generall~· admitted to lle of special consequence by its direct bearing upon important unsolved inquiries. The wfah toward that end has been nohl_y met by the men of Rcience and their friends. At my indtation the direction of the tfosired scientific researches has been undertaken by Professor J_,ouis Agassiz, and be has been assisted with lnrge means furnished by enlightened men of fortune. He has undertaken the expe· dition in the spirit which has perrntlml his life-with intense devotion to the interests of bis adoptetl country, and with increasing desire that its scientific fame may be commensurate with the ra.nk \Vhich we otherwise bold amongst the nations of the civilized world. The departure from sight and daily intimacy of that eminent man, upon a long and, it may be, perilous voyage, leiwes a void which cannot be filled. But while the exploration intended is a consummation worthy of his great life, he alone is equal to the grandeur of the enterprise. \Ve hope to meet him on the shores of the Pacific Ocean in the vigor of his pristine strengt,lt.

l.i. I<'. Ponrtales, esq., Assistant in the Coast
ESTHIATES.

In some general remarks which accompanied my estimates in Septemuer last for the wmk of the nPXt fiscal year, and of which a copy will be included with tbis report, attention was called to the interest now alive in the interior States in regard to accuracy in geographical positions. A few additional remarks are suggested by incidents which have since transpired. By means of a limited number of well-ascertained iioints in each State, the existing maps mig·ht be corrected by State authorities, and useu in the impro,·ed form, as they are used now, for general purposes. Special needs will in time Jll'CSS for the minute survey, first of one part and then another, until the whole area of each State is correctly mapped. If, therefore, positions are determined in a<l'\a.nce, and sufficient in number for the area, more or less, after sen·ing for the partial correction of State maps, the same points a\·ail for the State authorities in making fnture topograpl1ical and geological surveys. Secured for identification by marks set iu the ground below the reacli of' neeuful operations in tillage, a1111 protected from willful displacement hy State law, the points at places not to he speedily developed may await for years the occasion for reference to them. Instances of the recoyery of old stations will he mentioned in this report under the head of stationmarks, in Section II. But, to be in true relation, points must be determined in reference to their conueetion with each other, and economy in fixi11g tbem is in proportion to their number. One only, 8ett1t>d in latitude and longitmle, iuvolves far greater cost than the :werage of ten or more brought into connection with it by angular measurement. It need not be here explained that the longitU(lt· of any one in a series of points determines all adjacent positions that h:n·e been properly joined l>,y triangulation. ·within the year, a few geographical positions have been in this way determined in the ·icinity of Saint Louis, and others in the States of Ohio, Illiuois, and Kentucky, under a proYiso in the last appropriation bill which allotted a small sum for snch purposes. The results wr~· forcibly illustrate the wisdom and expediency of giving without delay, as can he done at small cost, a sure basis for surveys that may be undertaken at the West by State authorities. Last ~-ear the longitude of Saint Louis was well ascertained, a station there being of importance as one of S('Y· eral at wliich obsen·ations were made on the solar eclipse of 1869. At the state-house in Columbus, Ohio, the longitude deduced from obserrntions made iu Octo· ber last by oue of our most experienced assistants, proves that the previous!~· accepted position is in error·by as much as three miles. This discrepancy was not known when the govo.>rnor of Ohio applied for the benefit of the i>ro\·isiou made by Congress. Tlie poiuts proposeu for determinatiou in the vicinity of the Mississippi are from ten to eighteen miles apart. It is intended to connect all of them with the nearest section corner of the surveys made for the General Land-Office. Hence the work done by the Government in tbe geodetic co11nection of the Atlantic with the Pacific Coast, as proposed in the estimates, incidentally a mils for the geograpliical adjustment of large and populous areas at the ·west, and presents a motirn for early action in regard to correct State maps, in the issue of which the Goyernmeut has coJ!aternl interest, through the requirements of tile postal service. Early in the present season, aid given for the direct uses of the Department of the Iuterior, has added a point still further westward to our list of well-ascertained positions. At the request of the Commissioner of the General Land-Office, latitude and longitude were determined at a station on the southern boundary of Kansas, near the ninety-fifth meritlian, as will be noticed under the head of Section JX in the body of this report. Telegraphic facilities now extending iuto the interior afford remly means foreorrecting longitude by the process first used and now mainly depende<l upon in the survey of the coast. Many points

Certain astronomical phenomena of rare occurrence ai1d high importan!'e for the a(l\-ancemeut of human knowledge, ha Ye, in all civilized conntrimi, since modern science has been eultfrate<1, been deeme<l matters of national importance. Amo11g these are total eelipsP8 of the snn, m11l for many years it has been customary for the great nations to orgauize expeditious for tlte.ob::;erYation of them. The first total eclipse Yisible in this country siuce the formation of the GoYerumeut was that of Jnue, 180G. ThiR was accurakly obsen'ed at several points, and a valuable pai11ti11g· was made of it. \Ve were not fiwore<l with anotlier uutil .Xm·ember ;-)(), 18:>±, when the moon's ><lrndow passed o\·er the contment from northwest to southeast. Ti.Jis eelipse was ousened by B. T. Paine, esq., of Boston, at Beaufort, S. C. A third eclipse did not Yi sit our country until 18GO; hence, at that time this wonderful phenomenon was for most Americtin astronomers a matter o~ hearsa,Y."' The path of the eclipse of July 18, 1860, was from Washington Territory to the northern ::;!Jore of Labrador, and thence across the ocean to Spain. This ecli1>se was observed by expeditions organized under the Superintendent of the Coast Sm·n·y, and the re~mlts are publisl1ed in the report fort.bat year. It was also obsen·ed by tile astronomers of several governments abroad, and was the first tot.al eclipse which was photographed. In 1868, British, French, and Germa11 expt>ditious were fitted out for the observation of a total eclipse in India. On tl1is occasion brilliant discornries were made in regat·<l to the spectrum of certain rose-colored promi1ienccs seen about the sun at s1Id1 timeFq and these discoveries baYe been increasing in interest ever since. In 186\) another total eclipse was visible in the United States. It was observed by parties orgmiized hr the Coast Survey and other Government bureaus. The results were of high importanet>.

REPOHT OF TIIE

SUPElU:NTE~DE~T

(}F

eclipses were of such importancf' in regar<1 to one of the chief scientific problems of our time, the constitution of the snu, as to exeite the profoundest interPst throughout the world. It was felt by ever,Yhod,Y, evPn cmmalJ~~ iutere;.;t1~<1 in science, that, the eelipsf' of 1870 affon1e1l au opportm1ity for removing the last ollsuuity from the sn bject of the corona, snch a8 oui;:·ht not to lie let slip, the more so as no other eclipse wai'i exp1rnted to be obserYed during this century.* In acconlauce with these views the Hou. Johu A. Bingham, of Ohio, introtlnced a joint resoluti:::u, which was approved b;y Uongress aud tlie Ext·cnti n~, authorizing the fitting out of an American expedition, such as were to be sent out by Germany, hy l<'rnuce, by Great Britain, hy Italy, a11d by Spaiu, to study the pheuornena of this eclipsP. The late unhappy war prevented the first two nations from spating a11y of their enetgy for this peaceful emulation, but extensive preparations were made by all the others. The Ameriean and E11glish parties were in co-operation and alfonfod each other mutual aid. It is hoped that the good feeling thus engendered was not without influence beyond the circle of science. The ousern1ti011s of this eclipse had for their genrral result tlrn triumphant vindication of the American obi-ien'ations of the year befon·, the 11ovelty of wl1ich had made them somewhat suspected in Enrope; a8 well as the establishment of the supPrior acenracy of the American lunar predictions. Home uew features were obserYed in the corona and in the chromosphere, and other obsurvatious were multiplied. This is, however, not the place for entering upon the details of scientific proceedings, which will be given with all desirable fulness in the appendix. "\Vith a view of selecting localities where astronomical eorulitions, as well as those of the weather, might be expe<:ted to be favorable for observing, Mr. Charles S. Peirce proceeded to Europe in advance nlll1er my direction, a111l after visiting Ital~-, Spain, and European-Turkey, recornruended the occupation of statious in Southern Spain aml in Si.eily. The conntry east of ltaly over wltich tl1e track of the tota1it,y passed had the strn too low for photographic purposes. Considering the probable distribution along the line of totality of the European astronomers, I decided finally t:i dispatch two parties, one to ue stationed in the vicinity of Xeres, in Spain ; the other under my immediate personal direction, to occupy positions on the island of Sicily, in the neighbnrhood of Catauia. In selectiug observers I availed myself of such as had pl'e.vions experience, which, in matters pertaiui11g to solar eclipses, is of much importance, and whose former serdees i11 the special lines of duty assigned gave full assun111ce that no fact that could possibly be lloted under the circumi;tances 'vould be lost. The party orga.uizecl for service in Sicily ha.cl the threefold dut~, assigned of making measures of precision, includiJJg the determination of the geographical position, aml local time of contact; of getting photographic impressions of the various phases of the eclipse and of the corona; and of analyzing the corona l.J~- means of the polariscope and spectroscope. Accompanying phenomena wPrti :ihm to be reconletl. To i1nprrwe, a.s much as possible, the chances of the weather, the party was sprearl over as large an area as could conveniently be included, a precaution which proved of great ,·alue, as may l.Je gathere<l from the account of the labors of the party. A most cordial co-opc>ratio11 with the party of British observers, several members of which took position at Catania, was maintained throughout our sta;y. While in England and on the continent, on my way to the place of oLsernttion, the opportunity was taken to procure additional instruments required for our purpose. The party is indebted to Mr. "\Yildiug, our vice-consul at Liverpool, and to Signor Cattaneo, Italian consul at that port, for affordiug facilities to pass our instruments th1'ough the l\Iessina custom-house. Our thank;; are especially due for most effective assistance re11dered in receiYing, storing, and forwarding our instruments, and reshipping them for New York, to our consul, Mr. F. W. Behn, at Messiua, and the vice-consul, Mr. Aug. Peratouer, at Catania. 1Ye were indebted also to Professor Lorenzo Madden and Professor Orazio Silvestri, of Catania, fol' assistance, and to the municipal anthol'ities for permission to use the grounds occupied by the ohserrnrs. The distribution of the party in tlie vicinity of Catania, and the naturn of the results secured, will be briefly mentioned.

Time-,.;ignals, by hcliotroves, were sent aud recei\·ed by the observers at Catania and at the 2\fonte-Rossi station. 1\lr. Schott included in his series of geographical positions the three 11laces occupied in the garden of the convent, two by the English party in charge of l\Ir. J. Sorman Lockyer, and the other by l\lr. J. H. 1,:rne, of the oftice of United States 'Yeights and l\Ieasnres, who, though fully in·epare<l for spectroscopic 01HmrYatio11s, was lWP\·ented by nnfaYorabk weather from recording special results.

Tiu· 1liredim1 of a prualld of <lPcliuation was indicated by the image of a thread so ailjn~te<l before the Pclipsr that a solar spot mig-lit lw st·en as moying- along· tbe thread during the transit. }fr. Fitz operated the <'qnatmial and timed the pictures. Au attempt was made by means of . an ordinary camera to spcure au impre:-;Rion dul'i ng tile momentary appearance of a portion of the coroua. 'J'hc time of the tirst coutact was notl'd by :\fr. Schott, who wm; apprisNl hy a pistol tired h;-.· a mem berofthe English part~-, (the report by pre-concert,) indicating that :\lr. Lock~·er had already spec· troscopically noted the approach of the moon's limb oyer tlle solar chromosphere. The dense clouds which came from the direction of l\Iount Btna and to the we,,;t of it defeated all attempts at obsen·. ing the times of the inner contacts, aud of the last contact. l\lr. Hchott, hmveYer, sa:w through a rift in the clouds a part of tlrn corona to the northward and eastward of the sun's center for about three seconds. It appeared in sharp outline, nearly concentric with the moon's limb, of white, si!Yery iight, extending, by estimation, to about one-third of the moon's radius. The light tint of ora11geyellow, usually accompanying total eclipses, was seen about the southern and eastern llorizou. The first contact, or beginning of the eclipsl', as prndicted from data in the American I<Jphemeris, was only three and nine-tenths seconds earlier than tl.JC time actually noted in observing at Catania. ~Iy own station was about three miles uortli of Catania, at the villa of the l\Iarqnis di San Giuliano, whose obliging courtesy is a subject of grntef'nl remembrance. There the weathPr was more favorable than at t.he cits, and afforded a full Yiew of the corona, the studs of whch was made a special object. l\Ir. C. S. Peirce obsen-ed with a polariscope aud obtained good results. l\frs. 0. S. Peirce was successful in drawing the corona, antl distinctly recognize<l the dark rifts which have become the subject of discussion, and which were photographed by !\Ir. Brothern, of the British party, at another station. Farther north were stationed BYt. Brig. Gen. H. L. Abbott, United States Engineers, Professor Roscoe, of England, and Signor Anwrigo de Scl1io, Dr. Yogd, of Berlin, and others. Their object was t-0 observe tile phenomena of the eclipse at the greatest possible height on the soutllC'rn slope of Mount Etna, for comparison with similar obs!\n«ltions taken at 8tations near t,be sea-level. It is much to be regretted that this party wa,s overt.aken by a snowstorm, which obscured the sky, and obliged them to descend during tbe time of the eclipse. A few miles to the westward and northward of Catania, at one.; of the trigonometrical signals on the western peak of Monte l::.Os8i, Dr. C. H. I<'. l'eters, of Hamilton College, Ulinton, :N.

The outline of the corona was rougbly qnadrangular, the larger diagonal making an angle of nearly forty-fi,·e 1legrees with the vertical. Professor hrngle.r also used a SanHt's polariscope, which was attached to a ;;mall tele;;cope of one and a lialf inclies aperture. During totality the bands were distinctly seen on the corona, and were brightest where normal and tangeut to it. As the polariscope was slowly rotated, no marked cba11ge of tbeir brightnes:;; was seen during the whole rm·olution, and the,y prese11te1l the appearance and characteristics of radial polarization. Captnin Ernst occupied au elem ted station about half a mile northwest of the principal eclipst'·!'tation. His obsen·ations \H're npon the general appearance of the corona and landscape during totality. :Vfr. Gordon, who resides in the Yicinit,r, was at the same station, and made an excellent sketch of the corona. J>rofrssor l'iekering, of Boston, also occnpied the station last mentioned, and successively used an Arago polariRcope, one of the Pro:ymowski form, and a Savart, and ol>tained similar results 'rith each, \1·hich ilJ(licated the radial polarization of the corona. The light covering· the moon's dilic was ol>sern·<l to be polarized tlnoug·liont in the same plane, and the OOSl'fYatiOllS showed tlJat the .Arago aud otht>l' poJariseopes dependent Oll color, Were Sllfil· dentl;r lh·licate to determine the pla11e witl1 accuracy. l\Jr. P.oHs, at the same station, used a moditlcation of the Bunsen photometer, and obtained sen>ral accorrlant measnremeuts. showing that the light was about eqnal to that of a candle burning at a distance of two feet. \Yhile the prelimiuary ol.JseTYations at the "Olfrar station," at .Terez, were in progress, a meridianline, one lmndn'd and forty·six metres in length, was establi~hed and carefully marked with stone posts us Assistant Dean. \Yitl1 tlw frit 11dly co-operation of Captain Pujazen, director of the San Fernamlo Ouservatory, arrange111e11ts wel'e alRo made for excha11g·ing clock-signals by telegraph, for the purpose of deter· mining tbe longitude of the Olivor station, but the continual storm;y weather preYented the executio11 of t11i,,; work. As,;istant Dean acknowledges tile valuable assistance rendered by Uapt. Jose S. Montop~ chief of the :Spanish Coast-:SmTl\\·, "·ho, in addition to other data furni,,;hed, kindly offered to com1ect the ..c\merican eclip~e·statiou uy triaugulation with the. Spanish suney.

At the mag1wtic station on Capitol Hill, i11 \Vashington City, Assistant Charles A. Schott recorded, in ,June, n compkte series, and from his ol>scrnltions deduce<l the declination, dip, and inte11sit.y. His succe!-lsive ;yearly Tesults make parts in the discussion of t,IJe secnlaT variation at 'Yashington City. ln seYeral iustances, "'itbiu tbe year, ob servers not connected with the survey have availed tl1eirn;elves of the means afforded at the standard station for testing and comparing their magnetic instrumeuts. Those now in use in the Arctic expedition, nuder Captain Hall~ were adjusted b,Y the assistance of Mr. Schott. The instrnments nsed by the exploring party of Lit>utenant \\'heeler, in tl1e rt'gion of the Uolorado River, were tested at, the same station. Assistant W. H. Dall, uow on the coast of .A.la;;ka, is provided with the means of making reliable magnetic observations; all the instruments for use under liis direction having been compared at the station on Capitol llill just lll'Cvious to his departure for the Aleutian Islands. Late in N o\·ember, when tlle iro11 stPamer Hassler was about to sail from Boston, Assistant Schott, at lllJ re<1nest, made elaborate observations for testing the magnetie condition of the vessel, and for determi11ing the heeling error, and such other d11ta as might be requisite for the effective

Oill'lTARIES.

'l'he year 1871 has been nnnsnally marked with sadness to us by the prematttn· deHth of five of the younger men attaclied to the Stun·y, each of whom "·as known amo11g his associates arHI to myself as uf the most actin· a11!l 11:o;eful in hi!' grade. To the hy<lrographic division the chauge tlms wrought has lweu csp0cially severe. Tht' reconl of deaths iuclu<les one of its most trusted members. tind tw·o thoronghly-trai11t:d aids, 1Yl10 had gi n·n great promise of cftlciency in hydrographic punmits.

Summer and winter, for sen~ral years predous, he had n11remitti11gly imshed similar duty to complete the su1TPy of tl1e brnU!'.hPs of the Cl1t>sapt>ake Ha~-, himself traei11g the shore-lines, aud in large result!,; giviug 8ure evidence of patience, energy, and skill. IIe had in full measure all the qualities desirable iu his profession. Iu him a enltin1tcd miud was rl'ad,v at any time to be enforcell lly a strong will, and the utmost which could thus lle done in auy direction he had of himself subordinated to the interest;; of tltl· work cummitt1·d to his charge. The social qualities of Sub-Assistant Ila1·diug cmleared him to all in the SnrH·y, aud to a large circle of friends outside of its meUJ hL~rt>hip. Arthur F. I'earl and Georr1e lC Bissell, two bydrographic aid,; of great mPrit, were drowned near Apalachicola, Fla., on the 2lith of February, together with four meu of the party on 8('n·iee in tliat vicinity. The disaster resulted from the upsettiug of their sail· boat iu rt very smldl'll squall of wind on their return to the anchorage of tile schoime1· Silliman, which was auout four rnileoi off, after having attended church at Apalachicola. These aid!! were young men liighly valued for their confirmed moral worth, and for iudustry and attention in the performance of duty. Both were good sailors, aud, uesides being wl'll qualified in other respects, they had evinced strong inclinati01m toward the hydrogTapliic se1Ticc. 111 that branch their tl10rough training had been strongly seconded by their own natin· e11ergy and readiness to encounter any dangers incident to tlie course of 1lnty. During several seasons the senior aid sen·ed in Ulwsapeake Ray, in the parts of Sub-A:ssistant Harding, whose subsequent untimely death has been already mentioued. For the wiuter sen-fre of 1870, Mr. Pearl, at his own request, was transferred to the warmer air of a station ou the Gulf coast, his over-exertion in the Chesapeake llydrograph;y having brought 011 hemorrhage of the lungs. His amiable companion, :Mr. Bissel, bad IJeen previously associated with scn~ral h.}drographic parties in different secdonoi of the Atlantic coast. Harry S. Hein, jnnior clerk in the office of the disbursing agent, died at his home iu Georgetown, D. C. on the 17th of September, baying jnst passed the twenty-first ~·ear of his age. Under the eye of his father, and by implicit filial obedience greatly endeared, tl11s estimahle young man recently entered npon the discharge of (luties pertaining tot.he acconut;; of tl1c Sun·er. He was then robust and without any symptom of the ra.pill decline which, after a 8hnrt ill11P,;s, terminated in death. The break thus made in a loving family.circle strongly moYes onr 8_rmpathie;;, .and our regTet for the loss to the service of so much promise.

In this part of the 1·eport will he giYen short abstracts of the work done by the se.-eral parties. The notiet'.S will be, as 11eretofore, arra11ge<l irt" geographical or<ler, liegim1ing ou the Atlantic with tile coast of .:Uaiue, autl clo:sing· with 1Jw11tiou of \\'Ork doue on the coast of Texa,.;. Ou tlle Pacific side, tlw most sonthem site of work will he me11tiouetl first, and others in geogra1,hical order going umtli\1anl, the uotiees closing 1Yith mention of al"nwgemcnts made for h;rtlrographic serYicti on the coa:st of Alaska. Field-work at point:-; intermediate between the . A.tlautie aml l'acific will be placed in conformity wit-h the longitude of th(· sites. He1we rt'pmts ou the determiuation of geographical positions in Ohio, Illinois, Kentueky, aud J\Iii;souri will lie classed with abstracls of" work dn11e on tlw coa:st of th1· Gtilf of l\:Iexico. Tlte statements, concise as possible, will he limite(I g·euerally to meution of the sites, names of the assistants l'mployed, aud brief nwntion of statistics. llefore entering npou these details, a tew remarks are <lue to the distincti,·e l.Jrauches of tlle work. Tlie prng1·pss of tl1e triangulation 011 the Atlantic ancl Gulf coast.s during the past ,yea.r has fully realized the views whicl1 were embo<lie<l in my estimates of September, 1870. No plan, howen·r, in regard to special localities, made out a year in adnwce, can he adhered to in en;ry <letail. U11foreReeu emergeueies arise, a11d calls are made for special information. 'ro such contingencies the exte11JeJ operations of the sm·n·y have hee11 sul\jeet during recent ,yt'aJ'S in the interests ot' commerce aud for other pul.Jlic mws. IIenee, wLile the triangulatiou has not Leen contiuued at every localit,Y propo~ed in the estimate reterred to, ot!Jer sites, and sometimes other duties, have been substituted, aceording to t!Je uecessities of the service. In some cases, parties liave been concentrateLl, \Yh<·n· immeuiatl' results were advisable. I11clntli11g- the mmal n·co1rnaissauce and astronomical work inseparably connecte<l with the tria11gnlation, thirte{'ll parties have been eug·aged in the course of the year at twenty-seven sites on the Atlantic coast and Gulf of :!\Irxico. This is exclusi,·e of otller branches, in oue or other of which parties lun-e operated wit!Ji11 the ;rear on the borders of all the seaboard States of the Union, excepting- Delaware and Alabama. In acconlauce with the recommeudation contained in my preliminary re1wrt of September, 1870, a smaJI approvriatioll was made by Congress; at its last sf':ssion, for counnenciug the geodetic connection bet,ween the Atlantic all(l Pacific coat;ts, aud for the deter11ii11ation of poiuts in any of the interior States which may require them as the basis for State smTeys, or for the constr11ctiun of State maps. The expenditure of part of that small sum has already rtwealed a considerable error in the hitherto accepted geographical position of so pron1iueut a point as Oolumlms, Ohio. It is certain that any expenditure which may be m:-ule for this purpose will soon be repaid to the General Government by the more acc,urate iuformat.iou thus acquired in regard Lo dist-.tuces, or the Ieugth of post-routes, upon which coutracts for the postal service are vrim:i1ially based. By the 1st of July, at which date the appropriation became available, applicatious liacl been made by the governors of New Hampshire, Ohio, In<liaua, a11d .Missouri for tlie determination of geographical positions withi11 the limits of their respective States. Acconlil-1gly .stin~ral part.ies were agsigned, and have ueen engaged in this duty and in ti.Jc g·eodetic counectiou during the past five months. Statements in detail of tLeir labors aud results will bJ:J found further on iu this report. Near the end of Nuvemberlast, the governor of" Califoruia made a similar re11uest.

In respo11se to tl1is application, partial snn·eys were made by Assistants H. I ... \Vhiting and Henry J\Iitchell, in order to furnish for the desirecl conclusions data drawn from the p1·eseut condition of the places in questiou. The coast sectio11, iu which the1:1e lrnrl.Jors lie, is of special interest because of the wasting of its headlands, tile shifting of iti.; beacl1es, aud the singular tidal phenomena in tile approaches b,r souml and sea. AR loug ago as 184Ci, Lieutenant Commanding (now Hear-Admiral} Davis first called attention to the ph_ysical chauges that were in progress aloug this part of the coast of Massachusetts, and in tlw same .,Year .Mr. \\"hitiug made l1is first surn'y of the special locality iii question. My owu co1111ectio11 with these st1Hlies dates back to 1855, \Ylien the problems arising from l\Ir. J\litcilell's tidal inqnirini were referred to me for solution by my predecessor. Aside, howen·r, from these circumstance,.;, which give to the neighborhood a scieutific interest, tbe m1tional importatH'.ll of tlw two ports of ilfartlia's Virwyanl t·utitles tlwn1 to watchfuluess ou the part of the Coast Surn·y, especially when feari-i for their utility and permanence are reflected in the petitions of int<>lligent citizens. Tu calling npou :Mr. Whiting and Mr. 1\Iitchell for reports coucer11iug the dia11ges, I instructed them to make sucL su1·yeys, each iu his own field, as might seem to them c1e8ira hie. It appears from tile:-e n'ports that the southern orening of Edgartown Harbor through CotHlll.Y lkacli has been clo::;ed upward or two ~-ears, am! thi!' closure has greatly ernbarrm;sed the fishi11g i11tN<>sts of tlw pla<'.e, aJH1 g·i\·en rise to npprPhensi011s th:it the main entrance from the uorth may fill up because of the loss of hdal circulatiou. ~\~o .~!waling of the main entrance has, !towe1·er, yet oceurrnl. lu the channel-was ovee the Lai· the depth has i11crea,sed one f'o,)t within the last twenty.fin· .rears, arnl h; now 11ixteen feet at meau low water; hut within Chappaquhldick.

Point a shoaling has taken place opposite the town wbar\·es. This shoaling extends !}Uite ac1·oss the channel, but has not seriously dirninislled the deptll. Tl.mt the apprehensions referred to an· groundless I would by no m«:>ans impl,y, but that the harbor, in its principal points of excellenc(·, remains unclrnnged after two years of closure, at the sonth beach, is heyonu quei;tion. ·There haYe heen seyeral clmmres of the Cotamy Beach since the settlement of the ii,;lallll, ancl each new inlet has repeated essentially the history of its predecessor. It lla8 first lmrst through the western portion of the beach, then worked to the eastward, till in comse of tilur it reached the firm land at Wa,;que, where it made a stand, and finally succumbed. after a 8omewliat protracted struggle for existence. 'l'hc leveliugs over the beach brought into sharp contrast. the wirnl-woru and 'i'l·ater-1rnm se<> tions. The first gives for contours a congeries of cur>es; the second two systctn8 of nearly straight lines. The beach where subject to the action of the wind is coYere<l with irregular sanclhills, while that portion which is still under the occasional control of the sea presents two smooth surfaces declining in opposite directions from a crest-line. The sand-hills scarce1y reach the dig. nity of dunes, but each water-worn section fa in form and function a dike, differing, boweYer, from the artificial structure as usually built in the order of its slopes. These natural dikes appear to hiwe the same form of cross.section and nearly the samr altitude of crest above the tide, whether obsen·ed upon the south shore of ::\Iartha's Yiue~·anl or the east sl1ore of Nantucket, as if the dircctimi of exposure made no difference. The suryey of the interference tides of the sound and its approachet-1, made in 18.14, becomes peculiarly valuable in connection with the schemes for opening the heacheR T luffe referred to, 8ince we are able to give rules showing at what age of tl1e moon, and at what hour of the foLtl <las, the greatest difference of leYel between the lagoon an(l the sea may be expected. Although the tide8 of this neighborllood are small, there is a great proportional llitforence between the morning and evening ti(les, between neaps and springs, and between consecutive springs. l\loreover, the winds from different directions are u r1equal in theil' effects upon the absolute and rnlatiYe elevations of the lagoon and the sea; so tlrnt the engineer cannot dispense witll tlte tables deduced from the obsen·ations of Ai,;sistant Mitchell, and which are now on file in the Coa,;t Smvey Office. After parts of the shore-line had been traced, h,ydrographic suneys were 1uade in the course of the summer at Vineyard Haven aJHl Edgartown Harbor; aud, in atldition, the ti!les and currents were carefully studied. The charts were made by Sub-Assistant H, L. Marindi11. Upon Uwm are plotted it1 tlie aggregate 139 linear miles of sounding lines, a111l depths selected from 20,1547 recorded easts of the lead, the positions of which were determined by 2,016 angles. The tides were observed at three statious and the currer.ts at ten. Particular attention was paid to movements along the be<l of tht- sea, and the record shows about one thonsan\l obserrn· tions. In the report. of Assistant Mitcl1ell special mention is made of the energy and skill shown b:-· Mr. Matindiu. 'l'he party was also assisted by students from the Rensselaer Iustitute of Troy, X. Y., and from the lustitute of Technology of Boston, who volunteered in their yacations to take part in this instructive work. Providence, R. I.-In order to provide for the insertion of the city of Proddence in the usual generalized form on the chart of Narragansett Bay, a compilation from his own and other data was made by Assistant A. l\I. Harrison in August. Se\·eral ~·ears ago he surl'eJ·ed the wharf-li11es at Providence, and in so doing determined a few triangulation points in the ,·icinity. The data then gathered was applied to the existing city map fo1· the compilation referred to, the object being to show in a general wa.y the principal streets in their relation to the water-line. This work was done at an interval during which ]\fr. Harrison tmnsferred his party for service that will l~e referred.to under the next head. _ Topvgraphy of Narragansett Bag, Rhode I11land.-At the date of my report last year the detailed survey of NarragansetJ:; Bay was nearly complete.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Sub-Assistant H. G. Ogden, after closing work last winter at the south end of Rhode Island, aud before taking up duty iu Section YTI, joined Assistant Harrison at ·wickford, on the west side of the bay, and assisted in a<l<ling some details to the survey in tliat vicinity. Mr. Harrison, in December, resumed the outstanding work in the neighborhood of Newport, and by the end of March completed the detailed survey. In the course of the winter be ran lines with the level, to an aggregate length of twenty-three miles. The harbor commissioners of Newport haviug previously assigned means for a minute survey of tlie wharf-lines, on a scale larger than that needed for the chart, Assistant llarrison was authorized, in April, to comply with their wishes. The requisite triangulation was made by Assistant Edward Goodfellow. From the twelve points thus given,. }fr. Harrison traced and mapped the entire city front, and the shore-line for some distance above ' aml below the city limits, on a scale sufficient for all legal requirements. This work was closed in )lay. Soon after, bis party was organized for the summer, and, resuming the topographical survey at Narragansett Pier, extended it around Point Judith. For its progress to the westward, points were furnished b_r a party fa charge of Assistant Sullivan. As in other parts of the sun-ey of ~arragansett Bay, the work along the north shore of Long Island Sound is intricate, the surface presenting topographical details of all kinds . .'.\fr. Ilion Bradbury,jr., served as aid in this party during the season, and Mr. Stearns from the 10th until tlie end of August, when he was assigi;ied to field duty in Lake Champlain. Both are now under instructions to accompany Assistant Harrison for serYice during the winter in Section YI. The plane-table survey going west of Point Judith was suspended early in November, when the following return was made in statistics: ;\files of shore-line surveyed-_ ..... _.. _ ___ .. - . _.. - - - - .. __ ....... _- ___ . ___ .... 70 l\Iiles of creeks and marsh-line surveyed- .... _........... _.................... 76 :\liles of roads sur,'°e,yed . ........................... ~ .. . .. . . . . - ..... _...... _ .. _~ _.. .. .. .. . . .. .. . . . . . . 7~ Area of topography, (square miles) ................ - ......................... 20~ Tidal obsen;ationH.-The self-registering tide-gauge established la.st year wt North Haven, on the :Fox Islands, as the principal tidal station and point of reference for that part of the coast of :Vlaine, a general account of which was given in the report for 1870, has been kept running continuously. Its record is as nearly perfect as could have been anticipated. The apparatus for preventing the formation of ice around the moving parts of the tide gauge has worked admirably, so that no tides have been lost from this cause. This station, judging from the curves traced by the gauge, appears to be well suited to the purpose for which it was selected. Mr. J. G. Spaulding, a very attentive ohser·er, has been in charge, and has also kept up a regular series of meteorological observations. l\Ir. Howland has continued the series of tidal aud meteorological observations at the Boston mwy-yard. The gauge there has failed to record tides during the coldest parts of winter, owing to frequent .stoppages by ice. To supply the deficiencies in the record, parts have been added from the CLir\'e traced by the experimental glycerine-gauge working beside it. This last, however, has never ;yielded a perfect eurn, but generally gives a close approximation. Short series of tidal observations ham been made at seYeral other places in this section by hydrographio- parties as usual. These arc primarily for the purpose of reducing soundings, but the·registers lead to valuable results when studied in connection with those made at the permanent stations. SECTIO:N II.

section. Assistant Sullivan communicated the results of llis measurements to Assistant Harri"o11. and the plane-table survey, which was tlien in hand, went forward without delay. l~nder the lwa1l of Section YI mention will be made of the previous occupation of ::\Ir. Sullirnn. His aid, .Mr. Stearns, was on service in that section, and later in the season reporte!l to AsRistan t Cutts for dut~· on Lake Champlain, respecting whicll further remarks will be made before closing the notices of work in Section II. Station marks.-From the earliest period of the surH',Y marks !Jan~ lwP11 ;;l't i u the ground immediately under the position occupied by the theodolite at each point <letermiHed in the triangulation of the coast. Of themselves the marks are indestructible, aud they are so placed as not to interfere with tillage, or, except where excavation ma:'-' be needful, with any re.quircmcnt iu tlw advance of settlements. The stations have been selected generally with a view to tl1eir prrscn:ition. Nevertheless, some marks set for future reference may be distnrbecl by natural changes. From wi1lful derangement, or removal, tlley are protcctet1 as far as possible b,Y State laws, thP importance being olr..-ious of having at all times the mcaus for fixing geographical positio1Js lw~·01ul dispute. Vfithin the present year the examinations of Assistant .Johu Farlpy at some of the principal stations ou both shores of Long Island Sound confirm what was previously knom1 in regard to the necessity of positive means for preserving tlle ground-marks. At 1\Iontank Point the depression was found which indicated the place once occupied by the signal-pole, lmt the earthen cone buried at the foot of the pole had been dng out and destroyed. J\fr. J?arley took bearings aull mensurements sufficient for illenti(ving the station. The marks on Shelter Island, being in a mort> se(]ne~ tered place, had not been disturl>ed. Ordinary search for the exact point occupied at .Friar\; Head, on Long Island, was unavailing. The vicinity being now a deserted waste that was formerly well settled and cultivated, the reference marks could not readEy be identified, but, in the absence of other than natural causes, tlw cone buried wlien horizontal angles were measm·t>d from that point may be regarded as in position. .Farther westward ou Long Island the small marble post set at Clarke station, in 1865, was readily found. This point is near 1\Ianhasset, an<l will be carefully preserve<l by the present proprietor, J.M. Clarke, esq. Three stations on the coast of Rhode Island. '\\erP Yisited. Watch Hill station has not been distnrbed, but l\Ir, Fadey took additional ranges and views for ideutif.ving the point. The cone is probably in place on Champlin Hill, the outside reference marks being found as they were left. Such i11dications were wanting at Lantern Hill, hut tlw cone was found in position. Nickerson station, on the coast of Connecticut, is on an unfrequented bill. The· signal-pole originally used was set betweeu two large rocks, and these yet correspond to descriptious filed with records of the triangulation. At Williams's Hill, also in Connecticut, evidence gathered by Assistant Farley was satisfactory in regard to the security of the station. Sugar-Loaf Hill, farther westward, in the vicinity of New Haven, sllows in the circlet of stones and a slight mouud, the imlications which were left by the triangulation part~·. Evidence of the vicil'lsitudes to which ground-marks are subject was revealed in the examination made by Mr. Farley of " Yard" station, near Philadelphia. Several years a.go h::i was at the place, and recorded the position in which were fouud two pieces of the original earthen cone. The proprietor of the place, l\Ir. William Q. Baxter, with commendable iutercst, marked the position of the fragments by burying a granite bowlder, in which was previOL1sl~- fixed a leaden plate duly inscribed. Some time afterward, having occasion to move the ground iu the Yicinity, Mr. Baxter found the true cone. Assistant Farley visited the station in Nonm1ber, a111l, by additional measures and ranges related to the present surroundings, has recorded anew the exact position which was occupied by the theodolite while the triangulation was in progress near l~hiladclphil1. The results of his inspection were embodied by l\Ir. :Farley in a special report, accompanied by sketches showing the vertical and horizontal contour of the ground at each station. Triangulation and t<>pograpky near New Haven, Oon.n.-The work of this ;.·par near New Haven was'begnn by determining points for the plane-table surYey from two stations of the early trianglllation. Monnt Carmel was occupied to the northward of the city 1 and :Milford station on the western side of the entrance to New Haven Harbor. For this service Assistant Edward Goodfellow t.ook the field in June and closed in July. He occupied, in addition to the stations alrea,dy

mentioned, three others in the immediate >ieinity of the city. .After turning in the records of his triangulation l\lr. Goodfellow was assigned to duty, which will be further noticed under the head of St1<~tion VII. As 80011 as possible after the prelimiuary triangulation was finished, Assistant R lVL Bache took up the topographical snrn·y. This rPgion comprises about a lmudred square miles, and geologically com<i:;;ts of four ridges of trap and sand-stone, trending in a general north and south dirt>ction, bou11c1ed on the north by a trausverse ridge of trap, the heights, a;, distingnisl!ed from the New Haven plain, Yarying from about two hundred to upward of seven hundred feet. It i8 !lraiued through \·alleys, which are here a hroad marsh, there a narrow seam, and again, a central rising plain diYersifit>d liy rolling laud. The Yicinity is of singular topograpl!ical and geological interest. Jn his report .Assistant Bache remarks: ''.All the various features conduci\-e to beauty in map delineation are here present, aud here, too, plainly legible, is a volume of the ancient physi_ cal history of the globe, in which, amid the work of the uphca·dog, depositing, and denudiug forces through long ages, is seen the rude inscription of the great northern glacier, which molded these sand-stone hills, groO\·ed and abraded the trap-rocks, and scooped out the Yalleys.'' The map of a region containing one of the chief seats of learning in our country should include all the surface-features of special interest. vVhen this work is clone I>rofessor James D. Dana, of Yale College, will represent upon copies of tlie p1ane-tab1e sheets the results of his clm;e stnily of formations, and th us meet all future inquiry hy an examvle of the best method of geological delineation, applied to a miuute topographical suney. .Assistant Bache employe!l as aids in his party members of the scientific school of the college, who sought the incidental advantage of instruction in the use of tl1e plane-table. In the recurrence of such iustances the country at large, which, in its rapid development, is beginning to offer to skilled topograpbers a field of labor great fo inoportion to the number fitted to occupy it, will he benefited to the extent to which school8 along the sea-board may avail themselves of proper opportunities . .Assb;tant Bache commenced the survey by running a number of liues of level, the two priucipal being up the central valley north of New Haven. This is a sloping plain nine miles loug', which starts from the height of about thirty feet at the harbor, and attains an elevation of ninet~· feet at the base of Mount Carmel, the transverse ridge of trap before mentioned. Ile says: ~'Much curiosity being excited in regard to some of the chief heights, they were, by request, and with your special permission, published, dispelling long-cherished illusion on tlie subject. Mount Cmmel, commonly reputed to l>c on·r nine hundred feet in height, is not much oYer seven hunch'ed. East !tock, in the very outskirts of New Haven, once underwent a similar diminution of its grandeur ; for, as we lea.ru from one of a series of articles published in journal form in the Atlantic Monthly, entitled, 'A Virginian in New England thirty-fi,-e years ago,' East Hock was then reputed to be fi\·c hundred foet in height, but long since it has been known not to exceed three hundred and sixty. Tlle popular tendency to exaggeration, growing out of the delight of wonder, is obserYable everywhere before the taking of accurate observation, no height or depth ever being underrated. The effect of special mental training in producing accuracy is perceptib)(1 even iu guesswork.'' The season was generally unf1womble for fielll-work, but, besides lines of level aggregating thirty.fl ve miles, and plaue-table triangulation giving points within an area of thirty square miles, .Assistant Bache completed o-ver six square miles of the most intricate of the topogra.phy. This area comprises the Quinnipiac Hiyer, all(l its branches and marsb, for two miles and a half from the mouth ; the country eastward to the first mairr road, and the southern half of Quinnipiac Ridge, lying to the west ot the river. The length of shore-line of rivers and other water courses surn~yed was thirts-three miles, and of roads twenty-live miles. "Vith the early spring, operations will lJe resumed hy the party of A11sistant Bache. Survey of Lake Ohamplain.-The &urvey of Lake Champlain was resumed in July, and was continued untiLthe close of the season in November. Two triangulation parties, two topographical, and one hy1Jrographic party have been employed on the lake, some for the season and others for part ouly, according to the date of their return from the duties assigned on the southern coast. 'L'be triangulation now extends from Juniper Island north ward to the boundary·line between the united States and Canada, and covers more than half and the most important part of the lake.

Two short bases for the verification of the work on the east and west arms were measured near the boundary. The triangulation was connected with and closed upon the astronomical station in New York, occupied in 1845 by Maj. J. D. Graham, United States commissioner for the determi· nation of the boundary-line, and upon three of the iron monuments marking that line on the frontier of Vermont. The snrvey of the shore-line was continued as rapiclly as the points required for its execution were furnishecl, and the number of parties specially detailetl for this duty would permit, arnl embraces, with the except.ion of the northern part of the eai.;t arm, the entire field coYered by the triangulation. The Lydrograpl1y was carried on whene,'er the weather was at all favorable, the party in charge tlevoting the season to the broadest part of the lake, l;yi11g between Burlington, the Four Brothers, and ...,, alcour Islantl, and to a close suryey of such shoals and dangers to navigation as were found to exist. 'l'he i.;everal b1'anehes of work will be briefly mentioned in separnte notices. The early date of the appropriation by Congress, occurring at every alternate year or session enabled the parties at the soutll to continue in the field somewhat beyond the end of the ftscai ;vear in sections where tl1e weather was fayorable, and it was not, therefore, until the middle ot .August that such of the returning assistants as were M-ailable could be assigned to the operations contemplated on the lake. Ju the mean time, a1Hl with a Yiew to hasten the progress of the work, Assistant U. D. Cutts, then engaged in the triangulation across New Jerser, detailed llis aid, l\Ir. B . .A. Colonna, to proceed to Bnrlingtou, Yt., and, with such assistance and means of transportation as could be found, to make a reconmiissauce of the east arm ; to l:ly out a scl1eme of triangulation with the usual quadrilaterals autl cbecks, and to erect the necessary signals. l\lr. Colouna reached Burlington on tbe 15th of .August; was at work on the 19th, and before tlie close of September the signab, forty-two in number, were erected at intervals between Kibbe's Point and the boundary, includiug two or three ou the Uanndian shore, required for the determination of points on l\rissisquoi Bay, in Vermont. The energy aud goocl judgment diRplaycd in the execution of this lluty received tile comrut>ntlation of the assistants whose future movements depended on his progress and success. On the 28th of August .Assistant Cutts finished the observations at 1\lount Holly, and starte1l for Lake Champlain to ta.ke general charge of the checks and verification required at tht> closing of the work on the frontier. After visiting the different parties and making such arrangement:'i as were deemed necessary, he proceetle1l to Alburgh Springs, near the boundary, expecting to ti11d on the neigh boring peninsula a site for a common base of ,-erification for the two parallel series of triangles co\·ering the east and west arms. Not succeeding in this, owing to the brokeu and rolling character of tlie country, he selected two sites, one on a level beach in the vicinity of Uouse':; Point, and the other on the railroau britlge and track over the east arm, for tlle verification, respectively, of each series. .At the same time a triangulation station, >isible from both arms, was selected for the comparison of azimuth. The work of measuring tlie two bases was assigneu to Snb-.Assistant Perkins. Triangulation of Lake Champla.in.-In continuation of the sun·ey of Lake Champlain, .Assistant Charles Hosmer, after returning from work on the coast of South Carolina, took the field in July in the vicinity of Colchester Point. Signals were set up along the 1:1hores of the eastern channel of the lake as far north as Kibbe's Point, and intervening stations were occupied with tbe theodolite for the measurement of horizontal angles. Points having been thus determined, l\Ir. Hosmer resumed the shore-line survey with the plane-table. Separate mention will be made of the prosecution of that service. .At Kibbe's Point the triangulation was taken up by Suh-Assistant F. W. Perkini.;, an1l was pushed northward as far as Ball's faland, to provide 11oints in advance for the plane-table parties and for the soundings. ~~ssistant G . .A. Fairfield, after closing the season in Section IV, was instructed to co-operate in the determination of points on both shores of the eastern channel of the lake above Ball's Island. He commenced angular measurements on the 1st of September, signals for the purpose htwing been previously set up untler the immediate direction of .Assistant Cutts, by the .Aid, l\Ir. B. .A. Colonna, as alreads statetl. Sub-Assistant Perkins having brought up the triangulation to Ball's Island, joined Assistant Fairfield, and, in. going farther northward, stations on both sides of the channel were occupied at the same time. By this arrangement favorable intervals of weather, in a season which proved to be genera11y

REPOHT OF THE SOPERI:XTENDENT OF

unsuitable for such work, were improved to the utmost. The triangulation was extenued northward through )<lcQuam Bay, and beyond it through the eastern channel to the end of the lake, in Missisquoi Bay. Two stations of the triangulation done by this party are north of the United States boundary. l\lr. Fairfield closed the triangulation of the eastern part of fhe Jake on the 8th of October. }'or veri(ying the triangulation which had been brought from the vicinity of Burlington, a base-line was measured by Sub-Assistant Perkins on the railroad bridge near Alburgh, Vt. This is about three miles south of the United States boundary. The measurement of the line, which is more than three-quarters of a mile, differs from the computed length by less than one inch and n -, third. In order to verify the triangulation, which at the same time was extended through th(· western channel of the lake above I'lattsburgh, Mr. Perkins measured a base-line at 'Vindmill Point, on the eastern side of that channel and opposite to Rouse's Point. The comparison between the computed and the measured length of the line is satisfactory. The triaugnlation of this 8ea · Ron from Coleliester Point nortliward into :Missisquoi Bay, including the operations of Assistm1t Hosmer, Sub-Assistant Perkins, aml Assistant Fairfield, is represented h,v the following statistics: Stations oceupiet1 . _.. __ . _... ___ .. _.... _.. _... _.. - .. __ ... _. _ .. - .. - - ... - - . . 4fl Angles measured . __ . _.. _............. _ .. ___ .......... _. _ ........ __ .. - .. 313 Points determined .. __ .. _.... ___ .. __ .. __ ........ ____ ...... _ . - ..... - .... - . 50 Xumber of observations __ ......... _.. __ .. __ . - ... _.. - . _.... - ... - .. - ..... - . 7, 472 Assistant Fairfield is now engaged in tria1igulation wmk in Section I\~~ and Sub-Assista11t I'erkins in siQlilar :field-serYice in Sectiou VIL On the 10th of July Assistant S. C. :M cCorkle commenced the triangulation of the west arm of the lake, and the reconnaissance for a scheme of secondary triangles. Owing, howeYer, to the urgent necessity of points for tbe plane-table party ordered to that locality, the latter duty was discontiuned, and he dernted his entire time and attention to the progress of the tertiary work. Tlie triangulation was taken up at the line Crab Island-North Sawye1·'s Point, and by the 22d of October it was connected with the base of verification an<l with a mark of the boundary-line near Rouse's Point. The preliminary computations show a satisfactory agreement between the length of the line as obtaiued by direct measurement, and its length as deduced from the Plattsburgh base. In consequence of the ill-health of l\Ir. l\IcUorkle, which he reported toward the close of ,July, :Mr. William II. Stearns was detailed for duty, and on 1he lstof Septem bet' was assigned as aid. In his report Assistant ::\IcCorkle states that after the 5th of September Mr. Steams erected six signals and made all the field observations up to the close of the season, and his zeal and attention to dut,y are commended.

This purpm1e has becu aceom plished. Assistant Charles Hosmer resumed with tbe plane-table on the 1st of September at Colchester Point, and ke1lt the field until the 25th of October. .Fi\·c topographical sheets were projected, which he bas returned to the office marked to represent the shore-line of the lake on the eastern side, from Uolchester Point northward to Butler's Island. These comprise in the aggregate one hundred and one miles of the lake shore. In this survey Assistant Ilo<Jrner was aided by Mr. R. B. Palfrey. At Shanty Point the work was taken up by l\lr. J. N. McClintock, and extended northward to Ste~enson's Point., the sheet of work comprising both shores of the eastern channel of the lake,

and at the nonhern extremity takiug iu the shore of McQnam Bay. .:iir. ::UcC!iniock traced twenty-four miles of shore-line, au<l at tlte end of Oetolier returned to fiehl-serYice near Saco, )le. Sub-Assistant 11. CL Ogden took the field early in August to trace the shore-line of the western passages of the lake, with fiyc sheets projected for the purpose. These he filled, and returue(l to the office at the end of October. Commencing at Cumberland Island light-house, ::\Ir. Og1le11 llefined the western shore of tlrn lake, and the western sides of South lkro and Korth Hero Islands, and the entire sl10re-Iiue of Isle la Motte, and from thence, northward to the l~nited States boundar,y, both shores of Lake Champlain. l\Ir. Andrew Brai<l aicle<l iu tliis surn\Y, and in N 0 . ,-ember extended the topography of the eastern branch of the lake from the heall of :\kQuam Ba,\uorth ward, taking within the limits of two plaue-table sheets the boundary of V ermout and the southern shores of l\li>1sisqnoi Bay. The shore-line traced by the party of Su b-Assista11t Ogtlen amounts to one hu11dred and fifty-two mile8. These senm shcC'h; rt'Jnese11t also thirty miles of road. Of the topographers employt'u in the surve,y of Lake Champlain, .As>1h;tant Hosmer l!a<l ueen previously engaged in Section V, and is now about to resume field-duty there. The previous work of Sub-Assistant Ogtlen will be mentioned under tl1e head of Sedion YlI, where his party is now ready to resume operations. North of a line joining Ligouier l'oiut 011 the western side with Shelburn l'oint on the eastern sitle, below Burlington, Vt., the shore-line and islands of Lake Champlain lta\·e been accurately traced and mapped. Sonth of that liue, tlie cour;.;e being unhrokeu by islands, it is prollable that tlic field-work may be adYanced rapidly. Hydrogmphy of T,akc Champlain.-Iu thi:,; work soumlings ha\-e beell extended from Bluff Point and the lower end of South Ilero Island sontliward to Ligonier Point, in the vicinity of the Four Brothers, the space included coincidiug in limit8 with the shore-line snrvey of last seasou. :Xo means being available on the lake for liydrographic work, the small steamer Fathomer was transferred through the Erie and Oswego Ca11al into Lake Ontario, and thrnce hy the 8aint l.awrence and tlirongh the Saint John's Canal into the northern end of Lake Champlain. Sub-Assist:wt F. D. Grang·er joined the steamer at Plattsburgh on the 27th of .Jnly. Soumlings were taken np in the course of a few days, and were prosecuted without interruption 1111til the 1st of October. The party remained in readiness to imprO\'e every opportunity, hut stormy weather continued for several weeks. Hydrographic operations were closed at the end of October. lUauy reefs W<'rc developed, some of which were unknown to the boatmen of the lake. Wllile the soundings were in progress the level of water was carefully noted at Burlington and at Plattsburgh by simult.Rneous observations. Tbe recorued depths were atljusted by reference to a bench-mark at Yalcour Island. Messrs. F. \V. Uing and L. F. Chew served as aids in the hsurographic party, the former ahm iu Section IX, where Sub-Assistant Gmnger was employed tlnring the preceding winter and spriug.

Huds<>n Bivm·, New York.-In the courE:e of the season Assistant Heury Mitchell couuuctnl observations with reference to a physical survey of the Hudson. His study of the slopes of the rh·er presents points of special ii1terest. One of tl1ese deYeloped iu bis preliminary report indicates that a line of inquiry bas been opened promising direct results in regard to Hudson Hiver. The criticism subjoined to the description of the method of determining elevatious along the course of a tidal riYer is by a distinguished Belgian hydrograplier, who has been many years engaged in a physical survey of the Scheldt, and who now proposes to take up the problem iu the form to which it has been brought by the researches of the Coast Survey. Exclusive of many notes relati,·e to temperature, density of water, and character of bottom, the record of work in the Hudsou shows over seven thousand observations on the currents. Under the direction of Assistant Mitchell, the

details of the surve;y were prosecuteu by Sub-Assistant H. L. Marindiu, aided by a few stu<lenb; from the Rensselaer and Technological Institutes, who engage1l in the serdce with enthusiasm during their vacation. \Vith the same party, aided also by Messrs. North and "Wier, about thirteen soundings were made in the course of the season on the fiats in New York Harbor, and in Buttermilk Channel. The plotting of this hydrographic work is now in hand, with a view to determine the cause of the changes that may be in progr·ess. B11ri:ey of Newark Bay, New Jersey.-The party of Assistant F. H. Gerdes was employed during the summer and autumn in shore-line surveys and hydrography in the vicinity of New. York Harbor. Along the Passaic River the shore-line survey was revised and extended aboYe Newark, and the survey of the banks of the Hackensack was continued to the point where it is crossed by the Erie Railroad. l'ortions of the Jersey Central, the Xewark and New York, and the Boynton Branch Railroads coming within the limits of the survey were traced. Assistant Gerdes, aided by ]lfr. C. P. Dillaway, sounded the rivers within the limits just mentioned, and also Newark Bay, reYising, when needful, the sheets which represented the previous shore-line surYey. On the bay and riYers this revision included an aggregate of about sixty mile1'. Tidal observations were commenced by the party of .Mr. Gerdes iu July and were continued until Noyember. The schooner Dana was used in the soundings. A synopsis of statistics is subjoined: .Miles of shore-line surveyed . , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · ~8 :Miles rnn in sounding .................. : ........... - - .. - . - - - - ...... - ...... - . ll:ii Casts of the le~ul . . . .... _........ - .... - .... - ........... - - ..... - ... - .............. 11, 88L .Assistant Gerdes is now engaged in inking the sheets resulting from lhe field-work of his part.y.

J.-Iu my last report it w·as stated that a reconnaissauce had been made across New Jersey and a scheme found iwacticahle for the connection of the primary triangulation on the Delaware with tbe coast series near l3arnegat light-house. This scheme was commenced by .Assistant R. D. Cutts toward the close of June. The level character of the country between :\lount Holly and the coast rendered it advisable to erect high tripods and scaffolds for the ele".ation of the theodolite to secure the proposed leugtb of triangle sides, and to save the expense in labor and damages that must otherwise have been incurred by cutting lines of sight through timber-Jaud. Mr. B. A. CoJonna, the aid in the party, put U[> suitable structures at }fount Holly, and at four otl,ier statious, being those immediately required for the proposed triangnlatiou. Tlrn instruments were mounted at the .Mount Holly station early i11 August, and the observations required there were completed before the end of that month. 'Vhile the observatories were under construction in .July, 1\ir. Cutts accompanied me on a visit of inspection in Section I. During August and September be directed the preliminary field-work on Lake Champlain, as already mentioned elsewhere. On the 4th of October Assistant Cutts returned to New Jersey and reorganized his part,y at Stony Hill, with the hope of completing angular measurements at that station before the close of the season. Tb.e underground marks of the olcl point occupied by Superintendent Hassler having been found by Mr. Colonna just previous to his departure for Lake Champlain, the tripod was moved from the eccentric to the true station, the distance to which was about eight meters. The theodolite was adjusted in its place, but in the middle of the month the smoke which generally hangs over the charcoal-burning district so thfokenetl as to prevent observations. Soon after, Mr. Cutts being called away by other duties, the triangulation party was discharged for the season . .Altitude of stations.-The determination of the heights above mean tide of the primary stations has been continued, under the direction of Assistant Cutts, by a line of spirit-levels from Gloucest~r City, on the Delaware River, t<> Pine Ilill station, and by others to Mount Holly. This duty was executed by Mr. Colonna during the month of June and the latter part of October, and according to the metho<l described in my last report. The entire distance leveled, forward and back, was seventy-five miles. Bench-marks were established at the villages through which th~ lines passed, for the use of locl:\1 Qr :State authorities~

J.-A party was organized to work in this section with the schooner Bailey during the summer and autumn under the charge of Sub-Asoiistant W. W. Harding. The bar of New Inlet, at Little Egg Harbot, was sounded, and also Great Bay. In August the progress made and circumstances attending the work gave hope for the completion of the survey allotted to the party. At this juncture J\Ir. Harding was taken with fever. Ile died on the 25th of Sept.ember. The care of the schooner Bailey devol\ed on the aid, .Mr. J .·T. Evans, until the arrival of Sub-Assistant ,.V. I. Vinal, who was then in service ou the coast of Maine. Mr. Vinal reached Atlantic City on the 14th of October. Signals were set up and tidal observations commenced without delay-. At favorable inten'als until tile 1st of November soundings were made outside and through Absecorn Inlet, and iuside of the inlet so as to develop all the water-passag~s within three miles of the coast-line. A \)ench-mark was established at Atlantic City and others at Kew Inlet and Great Bay, where tile tides had been observed during the summer by Mr. Harding.

Survey of the "Horse-Shoe," (Delaware River,) and of the Schuylkill ne<ir Pltiladelphia.-Tbis work was undertaken at the request of the delegation in Congress from the city of Pililadelphia, the object being to determine the practicability of expedients for keeping t11e channel of the Dela· ware from being gorged with ice in the vicinity of the Horse-Shoe. In order tllat the question might be met with reference to the probable limits within which the observed elfects were wrought, a close survey of the banks of the Delaware was made from the vicinity of the mwy-yard to the lower end of League Island. Subsequently, at the instance of the delegation, the survey was made to include the lower part of the Schuylkill. In December, 1876, Mr. A. Hndenkohl traced the shore-line of the Delaware from the navy-yard to a point opposite to the middle of. League Island, and the opposite or New Jersey side from Kaighn's Point to Red Bank. The dikes remain as shown by the old survey, but 1\'lt'. Lindenkohl found that the river at two places bas been very much narrowed by artificial structures. Below the na.vy·yard these extend into the river from both sides, so that the breadth across to Kaighn's Point is five hundred· metres less than it was twenty-five years ago. At Gloucester, about two miles down the rh'er, large factories stand where the old river-fiats were, and two hundred metres outside of the former shore-line. The ferry· wharf at Gloucester is about a hundred metres beyond the old shore. On the opposite si<ll' "Broad Marsh" seems to be washing away between Greenwich Point and League Island, the last survey showing the loss of a strip about seventy metres in width· By reason of the severity of the season and prevalence of ice in the river it was found im·

practicable to make the soundin~s during winter. Assistant Charles Junkeu, however, observed while ice was forming on the shoals at and near the Hor~e-Sboe, and also the conditions under which the ice gave way aud its course iu drifting after a thaw or freshet. Such suggestions as seemed to bear upon the (\uestiLn of lessening the tendency of the ice to drift into Ladd's Cove were embodied in notes aml placed on file in the hydrographic division. In August, of the present year, the desired soundings were made hy Assistant F. F. Nes. Two sheets were projected to represent the results on a scale sufficiently large for any ulterior purpose. In the Delaware numerous and careful soundings were taken between Point Airy, at the lower end of "'\Vindmill Island, aud the light-honse abreast of Fort :Mifflin. The Horse-Shoe Shoal was -, specially developed, and also the Back Channel as far as the bridge, between League Island and Philadelphia. Subsequently, Assistant N es sounded out the Schuylkill from its mouth, near League Island, upward to Fairmount, completing the survey on the 2d of December.

BaHsett, an experienced tidal observer, has continued the series of tidal obserYations at GoYernor's falaud, in New York Harbor, with a self-registering gauge, occasionall.r uotiug the reading of a box-gauge at the Hamilton-avenue ferry in Brooklyn for comparison with the other. This series, though at times somewhat broken, has furnit1hed data for many purpo:ses. Indeed, no improvement can be made along the shores of the harbor or of its c01mected waters, nor can any costly structure be properl.Y erected near the water-line without resort to the tide-levels which may be deduced from t.his series of observations.

Topography and hydrography of the Broadicater, Va.-The name Broadwater which has been given to a marshy expanse of the coast of Virginia, north of Cape Charles, is somewhat applicable at high tide. At other times only the numerous channels are seen that meander through the marsh. The lower part of the Broadwater was surveyed and sounded last year. In December, 1870, Assistant J. 'VV. Donn resumed the work, and by the end of the season developed the coast region extending to tl1e northward as far as Metompkin Inlet. Sub-Assistant L. B. Wright was attached to his party. The schooner Bailey was used for transportation. With the plane-table Mr. Donn mapped the details of the mainland, prosecuting the survtiy there when the weather was unfavorable for souuding in the channels of the Broadwater. As before stated, much of the area to be passed over was a grassy marsh at low tide ; hence ordinary methods for topographical delineation were of no avail. Some of tbe channels which traverse these extensive fl11.ts are of local importance. The Great Machipongo flows for fifteen miles through a marsh so wide that the river course is visible only at low water. In making his survey A11sistant Donn determined first, and mapped the high-water lines alc.ng the mainland, and with them the hummocks, islands, and inlets as they appeared at that stage of the water. Next, the line of grassy marsh was traced, with the intersecting channels. Lastly, the creeks and chA.nnels were surveyed, to show their true courses, a.nd the depth at low tide. In the hydrographic survey, Hues of soundings were run with a view to develop the channels alone, the depth elsewhere being often insufficient to fl.oat the sounding-boat. This work, prosecuted with great patience and energy by Assistant Donn and Sub-Assistant Wright, completes the survey of the outer C',oastof Virginia between the head of Magothy Bay and Metompkin Inlet..

Latitude, azimuth, a-nd magnetic nbservatinn.~ at stations nn Chesapenke B11y.-The operations of the party of Assistant A. T. :Mosman in thiR and in other southern sections, extt>nding through twelve consecutive mouths, will be mentioned in the mmal geographical order, and uot in the nJer in which his nine dista1it sites ot work were suecessivel,Y ocl~upieu. Duriog the indement months of the season, which would not have permitted field-work in this section, the party was engaged on the Gulf coast, and afterward in Section IV, as will be stated hert·after. :Mr. Mosman aud his aid, :\fr. Ed win Smith, jr.: landed on the 19th of .Tu1y at Cove Point, Mary. Jaml, and as soon as possible mounted the astronomical instruments in a temporary obsen·atory at Calvert station, one of the poi11ts iu the primary triangulation which passes south~ard through Chesapeake Bay. At favorable intervals preceding the '..!Ot.lJ. of August ten nights were employed in obserYing twenty-four pairs of stars for latitude, one hundred and thirty-nine measurements 'being recorded. Two sets of observations Wf're made for tbe micrometer value. Time was determined in the course of thirteen nights by forty-nine observations ou eighteen stars; and for azimuth of the line to M.eekin's N eek, two b UIJ(Jred and· sixteen obsen·ations wert> recorded on five nights in A.ugnst and September with theodolite Ko. 16. At Calvert station the ma.gnetic declin:ttion was derirnd from ohsen~ations continued through three days ; fivt' sets of experimentR were made for ,-ihratirn1, and eiglit sets for deflection on two days. The dip of the magnetic needle was ascertained in the usual way. The observations for azimuth were close1l 011 tile (ith of Septemuer. M.r. Mosman soon afterward turned in at the office an aggregate of tweut_y-three Yolt1mes, with duplicates of the same, comprising the records of the stations previously occupied, and all the computatwus due from his party. He passed the remainder of the season in fixing the latitude and long1tudc of points in Ohio and Keutuck,y, mention of which will be made nuder the head of Section VIL At 'Iangier Island, in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, observations were commenced by Assi:;;tant Mosman on the 16th of .Tune, a11d were closed by the middle of July. Latitude obsen·ations were made during nine nights on twenty-three pairs of stars by one hundred and forty-four obsen·atious with meridian telescope No. 7. The micrometer value was acertaiued as usual. Time was determi11ed by eighty measurements with twenty-nine stars on twel\'e nights, and three other nights were employed in observations for azimuth of the line to ·watts' lslaud light-house. This is not one of the principal stations in the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay, aud the geodetic station at Smith's Point light house could not be seen from the ground at tlie azimuth station. To avoid loss of time and the expense in.cident to building a platform which must needs be forty feet high to bring into view Smith's Point, Mr. Mosman occupied as an eccentric statfon a chimney of tbe old Beach Bouse on Tangier faland. At this point were recorded by the aid seven hundred measurements of the horizontal angles made by lines joining the chimney with the. two light-houses and the azimuth station. The azimuth was observed at the eccentric station on six nights by six hundred and twelve measurements with the theodolite. Magnetic declination at Tangier Islaml was determined on three days, and the dip and hori· zontal intensity were ascertaine(l in the usual manner. Woif·Tmp, Va., a primary station on the west side of Chesapeake Bay, below the month of the Rappahannock, was occupied by Assistant Mosman from the middle ot' .April until the 7th of June. A signal was erected at New Point Comfort, primary station, and the angle 'between it and the light-bouse at New Point Comfort was determined from Wolf-Trap by one hundred and forty

3()

REPOHT 01'' THE SCPEiaXTE::'.'\DENT OF

four measurements with the theodolite signals were also set up for determining the. position of Wolf-Trap-Spit light and York-Spit light, one buudred and ninety-two meusurements being recorded for that purpose. Hoth light-houses were occupied with the theo1lolite as statious. :For the latitude of 'V'olf-Trap station Mr. Mosman and bis ahl, l\lr_ Smith, observed and recorded, during sixteen nights, an aggregate of two hundred and ninety results from forty-five pairs of stars. Sixteen stars were observed on ten nights, for time and instrumental corrections, by fiftyfour measurements. The value of the divisions on the level anrl of the micrometer were carefully ascertained. For azimuth two hundred and seventy-six measures were made, on six nigbts, of the angle between Polaris and New l'oint Comfort light, which, not beiug coincident with the primary station, is referred to it by the angular mea:rnrelllents already mentioned. At \Volf-'l'rap a complete sflt of observations wa,; made by Assistant Mosman for the magnetic decliuatiou, dip, aud borizoutal intensity; aml a full set by his aicl, Mr. Smith, who also took part in tbe observations for latitude, azimuth, and triangulation. Further mention will be made of the operation of this party under Sectiqn IV. ~Magnetic obserrntions.-A t the station near his own dwelling, on Capitol Hill, \Vasbington City, the usual annual series of obsen"ations were made in June by Assistant Charles A. Sehott, chief of the computiug· division. From these were determined t,he magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal iuteusity. The results serve as a cheek upon conclusions heretofore drawn in regard to the secular variation of the magnetic elements. Pendulmn obserl'ations.-Among the instruments deeme<l useful in the outfit of the expedition now in the arctic region;;, uuder Captain Ball, was included the penclulum belonging to Dr. I. I. Hayes, aud which bad been used by i\fr. Sonntag in a previous expedition to Smitll's Sound. Careful experiments were made with that bar some years ago by Prof'. George P. Boud, at Cambridge Observatory, l\lassachusetts. As:sistant Schott made a new series of observations with the pemlulum in the early part of summer, and.recorded the results. The instrument was tl1en packed at the office, aud deli Yered to Captain Hall, with full information in regard to the experim en ts needful for purposes of comparison. Hydrogrnpliy of the Clu:8apeake estuaries.-The descriptions in my rep01t of last year included mention of the work done by the party of Sub-.A.ssistaut ,V. \V. Hardiug previous to December 1870. Soundings and tidal obsen'ations were completed on Urn branches of Chester River on the 10th of that month, and similar work was commenced a few days after iu the upver waters of the Severn River, aucl in tl1e branches adjoining Annapolis Barbor, where ~oundings were prosecuted until the chanuels were closed by iee. This occurre1l near the. end of the year. The party in the schooner Hassler returned by the 1st of March, and completed the hydrography of the vicinity of Annapolis. .Before the close of that mouth a number of small branches of the bay along the east· ern shore were sounded out, Sub-Assistant Harding, as in other case;;, tracing the shore.line. In the course of te"n days, preceding the 5th of April, the several branches of the Big Choptauk were traced and sounded, ancl, subsequently, the arms and creeks that make into the Little Choptank, also on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay. Twenty-six of the smaller branches of Chesapeake :Bay were traced ancl sounded out. hy the party during the winter aud spring in addition to the work done in the head-waters of the Se''ern above Annapolis, and in the body of the bay between Thomas' J>oint and 'l'ally's Point. During much of the time the })arty was of necessity under way in the vessel, the sites of work not being continuous, but, as before ex1>lained, limited to the small brauches and estuaries which were passed by in the first issue of the chart of Chesapeake Bay for the general purposes of commerce. In the aggregate, thirt:,·-nine miles of shore-line were traced by Mr. Harding; the lines of soundings were in all about one hundred miles, and are represented iu the reeord-books by depths found with tifty-seven hundred casts of the lead. Lat.e in April Sub-Assistant Harding was assigned to service in Section IV, and but for severe lameness, which disabled him temporarily, he wouhl have conducted a party for the survey of the channels of Cape Fear River. Ou bis recovery he organized a pa1·ty'for hydrograpbic duty in the schooner Bailey, in Section 11, and bad well advanced the work under his charge when he was seized with illness, which c:am1ed b!s d,e,a~, ,as mentioned iu the obituary noti~.eli in t.11~ jµtroduct:on tc:t thi:;; r£>port. · ·

'Iharigulation of the Jame.~ Rfrer, Va.-Tbis work has been carried on by Assistant H. E. Balter, with but slight interruption, from its commcncemcut in October, 18CiU, until .May last, when it closed at stations near City 11 oint. At tbe date of my last report the triangulation bad ad Ya need as far aR the line, Cypress Shields, and from this haRe it was continued up the river uutil tlie close of December, 1870, when the running ice compelled l\lr. Hnlter, for the safety of the schooner Bowditch, to seek an anchorage in Elizabeth River. Ou the 6th of January he returned to the field, and althoug·h still, at times, delayed by ice and bad weather, was enabled to continue the triangulation with advantage tl1rougho1Jt the winter and spring. On the 5th of April his work and scheme of triangles were inspected by Assistant RD. Cutts, in charge of the secondary triangulation. An examination was at the same. time made i11 regard t-0 the practicabilit.v of enlarging the scheme with a view of connecting with the primary triangulation coming down, parallel with the coast, through the eastern valley of Virginia. For this verification, howeYer, ou the seal!': desired, the character of the country offers few natural facilities. It was, therefore, deemed advisable to suspend the triangulation for the present at City Point. The party was disbanded early in May. Assistant Halter, after finishing his computations, was as1>igned to duty in Section VIII. The statistics of the season on James Hi ver are subjoined: Signals erected ___ ..... _. _..·...... _....... _................. _. . . . · . . . . . . 32 Stations occupied . . _................ _... __ ....... _- .. _........... - . - . . . . 21 Number of observations ........·....................................... - 8, 546 Assistant Halter was aided in this section by l\lr. R. A. Colonna. Primary triangulation in Virginia.-For continuing the main triangulation southward along the Blue Ridge, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle made a reconnaissance early in the summer, aud selectt'd stations for extendiug tlte work to the Yicinity of L.rnchburgh. Of t11ese he subsequently occupied two, and completed at them the usual series of geodetic ousen,ations, closing operations at thP first, (Clark's 1\1ouutaiu,) near Rapidan, on the 8th of September. At this station a;;tronomical and magnetic observations were recorded, those for latitude and for time from measurements by SubAssistant F. Blake, and for the magnetic elements from obseryatious by ~fessrs. A. H. Scott aml C. B. Boutelle, aids in the geodetic party. The sides of the primai:y triangles, in this part of the series, range from twt>nt.y-t.ltree to 8ixtyfour miles in length. From Clark's Mountain the signals at nine stations \"ICre observed on, inclmling one near Fredericksburg taken in for connecting with the main work the secondary triangulation, which passes up the lfappahannock RiYer. At Bull Run Mountain, subseqrn;rntly occupied, the junction of the river survey with the primary work was completed. Assista.nt Boutelle made tbe measurements for horizontal and Yertical angles, and determined the azimuth, using an artificial horizon of mercury without any glas8 roof, and obsen·iug within two hours of the elongation of the pole-star. Special care was bestowed on the determinations for azimuth. Gu(( Stream.-,1\"hile crossing the Gulf Stream, on the 8tlt of December instant, in the steamer Hassler, Assistant L. I·'. Pourtales rec_orded the temperature of the water at the surface. A transcript of the observations forwarded on the arrival of the steamer at St. Thomas shows that the warm water, which is characteristic of the Gulf Stream, was, early in this mouth, more than half a degree farther south than it was in the year 1860, and that the band of warm water was somewhat broader. A c-0lder band was crossed in going farther southward, but 110 other alternations of cold and warm water. The observations were made in the latitude of Cape Henry. Tida.l obsen,ations.-At Old Point Comfort the series of observations with a self-regh1teri11g gauge bas been continued by Mr. vV. J. Bodell. The record includes curves for many ,rears, but the series has been often interrupted by storms, the situation being of necessity expo;;ed to the force of the sea. The infiltruments are now in good condition, and the fixtures at the station have been strengthened. A new box-gauge and a porcelain staff were rece.ntly set up for comparisons. Valuable results are expected from the discussion of this series of tidal observations. Several short series of tides have been recorded in the course of the season by the hydrogra.phic party engaged in the waters connected with the Chesapeake, and these have materially added to our knowledge of the tides in this section.

NORTH CAROLINA, INCLUDING SEA-PORTS AND RIVERS. (SKETCH No. 6.)

Triangulation of Pamplico Somid, N. C.-The work of this year, hy Assistant G. A. Fairfield, includes also the triangulation of Puugo River, the third in order of the large brnuches of Pamplico Sound. The steamer Hitchcock, one of the new vessels, was expected to be in readiness for service about tbe middle of Januar,y, but some chauges needed in the machinery delayed the delivery of the vessel. Mr. Fairfield joined the steamer, at ~orfolk on the 27th of February, and reached New Berne on the 6th of March. A few days after, the party, having taken in Assistant Mosman and his aid, as stated elsewhere, landed at Port!imouth. There Mr. Fairfield set up a tripod and obsen·ing scaffold, and, while Mr. Mosman was engaged in astronomical work, the requisite angular measurements were made for connecting the base-line with the triangulation of Pamplico Sound. A granite post was set by the triangulation party to mark the northeast end of the base-line, which is coincident with the statiou occcupie<l uy Assistant Mosman. Early in April the triangulation of Pungo River was taken up, and by the end of May that work was completed, making full provision for t,he plane-table sun·ey in the course of tht> corning winter. l'oints wt>re determined on the shores to a distance of twelve miles above the mouth of the·ri ver. Hetnrning to Ocracoke Inlet Assistant Fairfield occupied, in succession, as primary stations the three light-houses in that Yiciuity, and also the southwest end of the Portsmouth baseliue, and was ei1gaged with the theo(lolite in this part of the triangulation until the end of July.

W. Perkim; rendered effective service in this party, and was also asso.ciated with Assistant Fairfield in duty which waio; prosecuted during the summer, as has been stated under Section II. The triangulation of Pungo River is already connected with that of Pamplico Sound. Angular measurements are yet to be made at Swan Quarter Island, after which the lines in the scheme of triangles iuerease to an average length of about twenty miles. The work is about to be resumed by .Assistaut Fairfield. Latitttde, azinuttk, mid magnetic observations at Portsmouth, N. 0.-Assistant A. T. :Mosman reached New Berne late in February after completing field duty, which will be mentioned under the bead of Section VII. The triangulation party, in charge of Assistant Fairfi.el<i, arrived in Pamplico Sound a few days after, in the steamer Hitchcock, and, before taking up routine work, landed the astronomical party and instruments at Portsmou~h, on the south side of Ocracoke Inlet, and assisted in setting up the temporary observatory needed at the northeast end of the base-line, which had ueen measured by Assistant Fairfield near Portsmouth. The astronomical instruments were in place by the 16th of March, but unfavorable weather permitted only occasioual observations until the 27th of that month. Clear nights following until the 5th of April, Mr. Mosman and his aid, Mr. Edwin Smith, jr., completed the needful observations. Twenty-four pairs of stars were observed on for latitude, and in the 0'<>urse of ten nights one hundred and thil"ty-seven results were recorded. For value of the micrometer in the meridian telesco11e No. 7, five sets were observed on four nights; and as many sets on two days for the value of the level divisions. Time and instrumental corrections were ascertained from forty-nine observations on eighteen stars, tests for the purpose being made on thirte011 nights. The azimuth of tbe line to Ocraooke light-house was determined from one hundred and forty-four measurements on fi".e nights. The magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were ascertained from observations continued through four days at the station nt>ar Port-l'lmonth. Assistant Fairfield received the astronomical party on boq,rcl of his vessel on the 7th of .April, and next day returned to :tJew Berne. From thence the iusti:uments to be used by Mr. Mosman, iu

Section III, were sent by rail to Norfolk. His operations in tbat section bave been already described. The computed results and records pertaining to the observations made by Assistant l\Iosman in this section have been received, and placed in the office. Under the bead of Section VII mention will be made of the previous occupation of the astronomical party. Topography of Pamplico Rii,er, N. 0.-The survey made by Assistant F. W. Dorr in this section comprises the torogra.phy of the shores of Pamplico River above Lee':;; Creek, arnl extending to the immerliate vicinity of ·washingtou, N. C. With the addition of some few details to represent the town outlines the survey of the river will be complete. All the important creeks or branches of the Pamplico are represented on the plane-table sberts, and, in order to include them, the survey necessarily was carried back more than the usual distance from the shore-line of the river. Its branches mapped this year are Durham's Creek, Bath Creek, Blount's Creek, with the expanse known as Blount's Bay, Cbockowinity Bay, Broad Creek, and many of less note. The roads traversing both sides of Pamplico River were traced, and in other particulars the survey of this year was made conformable to that of the lower part of tlie river. This work was taken up -on the 6th of December, 18i0, Mr. Dorr usiug, as heretofore, the bull of the steamer Hetzel for quarters, and as means for moving from place to place in going up the river. The·season was marked by unusual cold, and in consequence the vessel was blocked in ice for several days. Party operations were much impeded from this cause during three weeks. A little village called Bath, marked on the lower of the two plane-table sheets of this season, is of interest by reason of its historical associations, that being, in the colonial period, the official residence of the chief magistrate. At present the channel which leads up to the village has ouly seven feet of water at t.he ordinary stage. Durham's Creek aflbrds eight feet of water through a narrow, winding channel as far as the steam saw-mill, just inside of the entrance. Another mill about a mile farther up the creek meets large orders from northern factories for spindles and spools, which are made of dogwood, persimmon, and other suitable wood found in the vicinity. The shores of Pamplico River alternate between sand and a narrow fringe of marsh, with occasional bluffs and some high land. On the south shore near Ne-dll's Creek (Sketch No. 32) the bank is forty feet high. At Bill's Point, six miles below the town of \Vashington, the river is only one mile wide, and 1'bere, during the war, two rows of piles were set quite across the channel to obstruct, the upward passage of the United States gun-boats. Many of the piles remain in place and the passage throngli. is at present quite narrow. Assistant C. T. Iardella ably co-operated in the survey of Pamplico River. Mr. A. P. Barnard served as aid in the plane.table party. The statistics of work are as follows: Miles of shore-line, river, and branches-. ____ .... _- .... _... - . - - . - .. - - - .. - . - - .. 163 Miles of streams _- .... __ . __ .. _. _- - _. - - ·... - - .. - ... _. - ... - .. - - - - - . - ...... - .. 431 Miles of roads __ . _..·.. ____ ... _: ___ . __ . _.. __ ... ____ . ___ - - - - - . - - - . - - . - - .. - - . 415 Area, (square miles) _...... _.......... - .·. _- .. _- - - - . - - - . - - - - . - - - .. - - ... - - - .. 194 The very large area developed with a single plane·table gives evidence of close and conscien· tious application to duty by the members of the party. In the course of the present winter Assistant Dorr will map the vicinity of Washington, N. C., and then continue plane-table work along the western shore of Pamplico Sound; and include the survey of Pun go l~iver. In conjunction with Assistant lardella he prosecuted field-work during the summer, as stated under the bead of Section I. On the 24th of May the steamer Hetzel was laid up at Washington to be in readiness for the completion of the survey at the head of Pamplico River. · . Hydrography of Pamplico River, N. 0.-In its progress from the southward the bydro_grap~y of Pamplico Sound rested, at the opening of the present s£>-ason, at the entrance of Pamphoo Rn-er. Soundings in the lower part developed the channels of that river as far upward as Indian Island. Assistant F. F. Nes made preparations in December, 1870, for completing the hydrography of Pamplico River, with a party in the l!Chooner Arago, Assistant. Dorr having previously advanced

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

the plane-table survey from the entrance as far up as Lee's Creek. The vessel, needing extensive repairs, was placed in charge of the senior aid, ~Ir. "'··I. Vinal, at New Berne. Other pre.parations being made in the same interval, the party took up soundings in Pam1'1ico River on the 23d of February. Assistant Nes had been eutirely disabled by rheumati8m, which seizeu hirn at the approach of winter, while closing bydrographic work on the coast of Maine. Be was in comiequence unable to join his party in Section IV. Under his general direction, however, the operations were carried forward with success by Mr. Vinal. The work is comprised on three sheets, taking in all the shore-line which has been traced by the plane-table party. Mr. Vinal recorded tidal observations at four stations in Pamplico River. In going up the channel sextant angles were measured. at forty-fi:ve stations. Fourteen buoys were determined in position by occupying forty-three points' along the banks of tbe river. For the adjustment of soundings the party in the Arago set up sixtyone signals. Mr. Vinal was aided by Mr. R. B. Palfrey until the 17th of March, and until the close of work, near the end of May, by Mr. J. J. Evans. The sailing-master of tlle Arago, Capt. Thomas H. Ferney, besides bis care of the vessel, rendered important service in this hydrograpbic survey.

At the approach of spring Assistant Nes was able to resume duty afloat. Bis occupation during the summer and autumn bas been mentioned under the head of Section IT. l\Ir. Vinal was at the same time on dut.r in a party in Section I, but was sent to the coast of New Jersey in October to contiuufl hydrographic work which bad been s11spended by the death o( Sub-Assistant Harding . .A like distress occasioned the transf(lr of the aid, l\Ir. Palfrey, to Section VII, as will he noticed under that head. H_1Jdr<>gmphy <>f Hatteras Shoal.s, N. C.-Under the expectation of favorable weather in July, Acting ~laster Hobert Platt, United States Navy, Assistant Coast Survey, sailed early in that month from Norfolk with bis party in the steamer Bibb, and set signals along the beach of Pamplico Sound, the intention being to run lines of soundings to seaward and develop the depth now to be founu in prossing the Hatteras Shoals. Several lines were successfully run before the end of July. Bad weather then set in. Ten times duriug the month of August the steamer was on the ~hoals, but no weather suitahle for completing the survey at that season presented itself. The work was subsequently accomplished and the results will be marked on the general sailing chart of this section. The hydrographic party in the steamer Bibb was previously engaged in Section VI. Topography of Bogue Inlet, K. C.-East and west of Bogue Inlet, at the opening of the winter season, an interval was outstanding in the topography of the coast of North Carolina. Assistant Hull Adams reached Swansboro on the 19th of Decembn, 1870, and organized a party for plane-table service, the intention being to make the belt of topography in that vicinity conformable to the survey of the shores of Bogue Sound, where the coast topography was suspended in 1868. When the party arrived the cold was severe '.md the sound was soou after frozen over. The sandhills, moreover, ball so changed that none of the points marked in the triangulation which was made previous to the war could be identified. Assistant Adams, in consequence, started from stations marked on the shores of Bogue Sound in 1868, and going westward renewed the triangulation by means of the plane-table, tracing at. the same time the outside shore-line as far in that direction as New River Inlet. This is about twenty-five miles from the point at which he started. His work completes the survey of Bogue Sound, including also the inlet of that name, and the mouth of 'Vhite Oak River in the immediate vicinity of Swansboro. Farther westward the outside shore-line was traced, including the openings known as Bear's Inlet and Brown's Inlet. The details inside of. the shore-line will be mapped in the course of the present winter. Before leaving the section, at the end of May, Mr. Adams antl Sub-Assistant Eugene Ellicott, who was attached to his party, found the marks of eight. of the stations occupied some years ago in making the triangulation between Swansborough and New River Inlet. These will aid much in the early comple-

Topography and hydmgraphy of tlte .~e.a-islmid clwnnel11 of 8outli Carolina.-The survey in this section bas been advanced to include two of the branches of Coosaw River, near the bead of Saint Helena Sound, and also tbe upper waters of Port Royal Sound, and of Calibogue Sound. Having refitted his vessel, the schooner G. l\l. Bache, at Sa\·anr1ah, Assistant Charles Hosmer resumed work on the sea-islands on the 12th of December, 1870, aided by .Mr. J. N. 1\lcC!intock. Joining with plane.-table details which were mapped in the spring of 1870, on the north shore of Savannah River, the survey was continued northward and eastward, and included in its course the upper part of Wright's River, and all the water-passages between it and Broad River. The passages were sounded, and some additional triangulation needed for plane-table work near the Savannah, and. also for the extension of the survey so as to take in Uhechessee River, was made by the party. Twelve stations were occupied witb the theodolite for this purpose. The detailed sun·ey is comprised on two sheets. Later in the season the party developed by a shore-line survey and soundings a stretch of six miles in Bull Rh·er, aud in the same region about four miles of the course of the Oombahee River. The parts surveyed include the phosphate deposits, so valuable for the fertilizing properties of the material which is largely taken from the beds of the rivers. At the end of April the schooner Bache was laid up at Savannah.

This service was perfo1med with a party in the steamer Endeavor, which reached Fernandina on the 27th of December, 18i0. Tidal observations were commenced immediately ~t Fernandina and near Nassau Bar, and w<>re continued as usual for the adjustment of soundings. Many of the points determined in this section previous to the war, along the Saint Mary's, having been destroyed, Mr. Webber was under the necessity of renewing the triangulation partially, so as to join with the southern limit of preYious work. South of the Saint Mary's the points were found as they had been left by the triangulation party. Sncb additional ones as were needed about Amelia Island were furnished by the plane-table party of Assistant Dennis. Favorable weather was employed in running lines of soundings off-shore from .Amelia faland. At intermls unsuitable for such a purpose the boats of the JiJ-ndeu-vor were occupied in developing

Assistant A. l\I. Harrison is now pre1Jaring to take np plaue-tal>le work l>elow Saint Augustine, and to extend the tletailed surYey southward. l\1r. Sullinm returned from this section in April. Hi:s party was s11bseque11tly eugaged in Section I. Hydrograplty near the Tort11glfo8.-With the steamer Bibb, which was rPlittPd in the course of the winter, Acting Master Holwrt Pfatt, D.S. N., Assistant Coast Suney, set sail in January, to complete soundings to the northward of the Tortugas, in the Hulf of :'llex.ico. Signals liad been left standing for the purpose, bnt thej' bad all gone down in the hurricane of Odoller, 18iU. Some daj'R were occupied in estaulishing the requisite poiuts of refere11ce, and in restoriug the signals. The hydrography was then eontinued north of the Tortugas aud Quicksands, the lines run being extended to dist,ances of twenty.five miles beyoml the ten-fathom cm·n~. This work mis !aid aside in May for special service, which will be referred to presently. Actiug- ~faster Platt was again on the working ground before tbe end of that month. After completing tbe hydrogTapli.r of the Quicksands, he made a close survey of a large bank about lour miles to the north ward. This, which is imrallel with the Qu\eksauds, he has called tbe Ke1c Ground. Sernrul spots were found on it with oul,y eight feet of water, and on the north side of the l>ank the water shoalt:< ver.r suddenly from ten fathoms to less tllan ten feet. The New Ground is composed of large coral rocks, sand, and grass. Iron buoys, lent by the light-house inspector at Key West, were temporarily useu as reference-marks while soundings were in progress in the dciuity of the Quicksands. The statistics of that work are as follows:

The Raltigh, drawing eighteen aml one-half feet, and consequently unable to pas8 by t.lie Northwest Channel from Key West, was towed by the steamer BiblJ around the Quicksanlls, and through the Rebecca Channel. On the passage to Punt~1 Rasa, (Charlotte Harbor, Fla.,) the vesi;els met strong head-winds and a hea>y sea. Fortunately the weather changed. Under very·· favorable conditions the cable was started at Punta Rasa, and successfully laid in a straight course southward and by the shortest route to Key \Yest. Ou the night of the arrival of the Bibb, with the telegraph.,·pssel in tow, (20th of l\Iay,) the Gnitecl States gun-boat Nipsic parted her chains in a heavy squall and went a;;bore. Receiving notice of the disaster at midnight, Acting l\laster Platt bad the steamer Bibb in readiness, and when the morning tide served, towed off the Nipsic. into deep water. As before stated, the hydrographic work was then re8umed and was completed near the Quicksanch; by the end of May. The Ribb reached Norfolk on the 11th of .June, and was subsequently on sen-icP in S.-ctiun IV. l\Iessrs. J. B. Adamson aml C. L. Gardner served efficieutl;y as aids in this hydr·ographic party.

B. Wainwright, he made au examination of the prt'sent capacity of the. principal channel at Cedar Keys. Finding the marked ends of the hase, but none of the adjacent stati.:ins, Mr. Webber determined eight additional points with the theodolite, and then sounded from the railroad-wharf through to a poiut about a mile below Sea-Horse Key. He found ten and twelve feet in the middle of the channel at mean low water. The channel is narrow, and needs permanent marks, those now in place being liable to destruction in every gale.

Hydrograpliy of Saint Georg,'s Sound., Fla.-For the b~·drographic wmk required in Saint George's Sound a party was organized nuder charge of Sub-Assistant Horace Anderson, and sailed from Baltimore, in the schooner Rilli11ian, on the 16th of ,January. The vessel was delayed on ·the passage southward. In a heavy sea off the Frying-Pan Shoals, the shackles at the mast-head gaYe way, aucl the standing gear came down on deck; but by great exertions the masts were saved, and the schooner safely reachml Savannah, where she took on board the working-boat intended for service in the Gulf. By reason of light winds after leaving that port the party did not land at Apalachicola until the 13th of February. \Vork was commenced without delay. The chief of the party and his two aids, Arthur F. Pearl and George W. Bissell, wet·e young, st1·ong, and active, and the c1·tiw was thoroughly efficient. Under these and other favorable conditions work was continued

until the evening of Saturday the 25th of Fehrnary. Next day the aid8, at the clo8e of churcbservice, left Apalachicola in the sail-boat, with four men, to return to the scl1ooner Silliman, which was at anchor about four miles from the town. By a very sudden squall of wind at 1 p. m. tl.Je boat was upset, and all on board were drowned. The bodies of the aids, and of two of the crew, were found in the course of the week following, and were buried at Apalachicola. ~Iy sense of tlie loss sustained by tl1e snrwy in the death of the two hydrographic aids has been expre.,sed elsl!where in this report. Of the boat's crew that perishea with them, James Scott was shipp!!d at Baltimore; the other three, Henry Austin, Joseph P. Ridley, and James Anderson, belonged to Apalachicola. Sub-Assistant Anderson, having discharged the sad duties which devolved upou him by this disaster, resumed work, and extended the hyllrngra.phy of the sound from Bulk-head l'oint eastward to Royal B1uff. His survey deYelops many sand-bars and oyster-he1ls in the eastern approach to Apalachicola. There is, however, a three-fathom channel from the eastward as far iu as the bulk-head, where the depth on the bar, which extends aeross the sound to Cat Point, h·Rsens to seven feet, and where it is frequently less than six feet. The tidal observations made in April and l\fay showed the effect of winds, and that a. rise and fall of about eighteen inches miglit be regarded as the average. Mr. H. B. Palfrey joined the party as aid on the 1st of Aprit and is warmly commended in the report of Sub-Assistant Anderson for untiring eft'orts to repair, as far as po::,sible, the untoward circumstances that marked the early progress of the work.

Azim nth determinatious beiug needful at two sites on the Gulf coast, the Yessel to be use<l in triangulation was relied on to afford also tranRportation for the party and instrument., of AssiRtant Mosman. In February, when the observer~ ~err re~1dy fo1· service at Eagle Harbor, Assistant McCorkle made his arrangements conformablt· to the rerJ11ire·ments of the astronomical party, and at the same time measured the base upon which his triangulation of Saint Joseph's Bay dtopends. The ends of the line were connected in the usual \rny with the adjacent triangulation points by the measurement of horizontal angles. The position of the base-line is shown on the progress sketch of the section. Sub-Assh;tant H. l\L De Wees assisted in the measurement. - Assistant A. T. Mosman, under arraugcments made with Assistant Mccorkle, was landed from the scl1ooner Torre,11 at Eagle Harbor, on the 5th of February. All needful aid was given by the triangulation party in mounting the astronomical instruments, and in erecti11g a sbeltPr to prntPct them from injury. With theodolite No. 16 Mr. 1\Iosman and his aid, 1\fr. Edwin Smith, obserwd for azimuth on four favorable nights preceding the 14th of the month, and recorded sewnteen sets of observations. In order to connect the azimuth-station with points in the triaugulation of Saint Joseph's Bay1 horizontal angles were me:isurell by twelve sets on three days. The time was determined hy se,·euteen sets of observations made 011 five days with the sextant and artificial hol'izon.

His party aided also in tlie erection of the camp, and in mounting the astronomical instruments.at Da,'is' Point. The latter part of the season in this section w_as employed by Mr. l\IcCorkle in a reconnaissance along the coast toward Cboetawhatchee Bay. Beyond Saint Andrew's Bay to the westwaru the country i;; heavily wooued. l\Iauy swamps were passed making in at right angles to the shore of the Gulf of l\Iexico. The uifiiculty of extending the tria11gulation is great, but possibly the obstacles presented in this stretch of about forty miles may be lessened by examining the ground which in ten·enes betweeu the upper waters of Saint Andrew's Bas and those that enter into Choctawhatchee Bay. As yet no well-defined roatls are laid ont, but a party has been organized for such senice as may Le practicable in the de,-elopment of this region. Late in April the schoont>r Torrey was laid up at Apalachicola in the charge of a ship-keeper. Assistant l\lcOorkle then passed northward, and during tlle summer and fall was occupied in fieldwork in Section IL Before leaYing Saint Andrew's Bay the base-line upon which the triangulation depends was carefully rernemmred, as al;;o the anglt>s connecting it with the triangulation. Sub-Assistant De 'Vees co-operated in this service. Lat'itudc and azimuth at Saint Aiidrew's Bay, Fla.-At DaYis' Point the astronomical instruments intended for the determination of latitude and azimuth were landed from the schooner 1'orrey lat.e in December, 1870. Before leaving for the prosecution of routine work, aid was given by tlle triangulation party in the schooner for setting up tents am] securing the iustruments in their places. Ever;ything being in readiness, Assistant Mosman commenced astronomical observations on the 4th of ,January, and employed every clear night until the 17th, seYen bciug occupied. in observing on twenty pairs of stars with zenith telescope No. 6 for latitude. 'l'ime was deter. mined ou nine nights by observations on sixt;y-four stars with transit No. 12. Twenty-four sets of observations were made on six uights for azimuth with theodolite No. 16; and by measnring horizoutal auglP8 011 five days, the azimuth-station was connected with the triangulation of Saint Andrew's Bay. Mr. Edwin Smith Rervetl af.'1 aid and recorder in the astronomical operations. .Assistant Mosman left Apalachicola on the 20th of February, for sel'Yice in Section IV. He was afterward engaged in Section I II, and toward the end of the season co-operated in astronomical work in Ohio and Kentucky, further mention of which will be made before closing notices of work in Section VII. Dnplicates of all the records kept by Assistant Mosman on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts have been deposited in the office, together with the field computations for latitude, azimuth, and maguetic observations. Topography of Saint Andrew's Bay, Fla.-The plane-table work outstanding at Saint Andrew's l~ay when the season opened included some.details additional to the survey which had been made, in the preceding year, of the eastern and northern arm, and the survey of the western part of the bay. A8 alrrady mentioned, the triangulation tl1ere was taken up by Assistant McUorkle e~rly in ,January. Following in order as pointR were fnrnislied, Sub-Assistant De Wees, after filling in supplementary details to tbe ca..~tward, traced the shore-line of the western arm, including the

He is now under instructions for service in Section IV. Triangulaiion, topography, and hydrography of Santa Ro8a Sowul, Fla.-The Gulf coast between Uhoctawhatchee Bay and Pensacola Ba;r, a distance east and west of about forty-fiye miles, has been thoroughly surTe,ved by a party under the charge of Sub-Assistant H. G. Ogdeu. Santa Rosa Sound connects the waters of the two bays, and is separated from the Gulf by a low saml.r island fifty miles long. The width of this barrier at the average is fibout a quarter of a mile. Santa Rosa Sound itself, stretching east and west, varies in breadth, being two miles across toward the western eml, where it joins Pensacola Bay, hut is less than three hundred yards wide nt~ar its entrauce into Choctawbatchee Bay. Field operations were commenced. late in December, 18i0, and dosed on the 16th of the following :\fay. Sub-Assistant 0. H. Tittmann, who was attached to this party, made. the needful triangulation, starting from two stations, (Fort Pickens and the navy-yard,) wl.iich had been occnviecl 11reYiously in the survey of Pensacola Bay. Going eastward be set up siguals, and occupied alternately many stations 011 the north and along the south shore of the sountl, and extendetl liis triangulation into Clioctawhatchee Bay. The western part of tlJat body of water was also included iu the survey of this year, aud also East Pass, which is an outlet from Choctawhatchcc Bay into the Gulf of :Mexico. The conditions being unfavorable in some places along the so1rncl for extemled lines in the triangulation by reason of tlie inter.vention of trees and sand-hills, great care was taken in the determination of horizontal angles, thirty six measurements being recorded for each angle. Additional to tbe arrangement in quadrilaterals, angles were measured from their stations to couuect with them any signals that might be visiLle in the adjoining quadrilaterals. Tlle scheme of triangles sbown in the progress sketch, and the statistics of tht:' work, are cYidcneeR of untiring patience, and the results are highly creditable to the members of the party. The topogrnph_y of Santa Rosa Sound was commenced by Sub-Assistant Ogden early in February, at a point eleven miles from Fort Pickens. Three sheets were filled in going eastward, tbe last taking in the western part of Choctawbatcbee Bay with Garnier Bayou, FiYe-J\Jile Bayou, and the shores of East Pass, which connects the ba.y with the Gulf of Mexico. Santa Rusa Island, as represented on the plane-iable sheets, is covered in spots with grass and pine trees. Patches of marsh are met in a few places along the inside shore. The sand-hills on the island are generally isolated, but in a few instances they occur as ridges. Along the Gulf Shore, howHer, a nearly continuous ridge of sand from five to ten feet hig-h, aud covered with grass, presents a barrier so effectual that the island has nowhere been cut through by the waters oft.he Gulf. In mauy places the ridge shows like an artificial structure, so regular are the slopes. The topographical survey shows but one break in tbfl entire length of this peculiar sand-barrier. The mainland, or north shore of Santa Rosa Souud, is mostly swampy to the distance of a quart~r of a mile from the water-line, and is coYered with a growth of pines, among which are a few live-oak t.rees. At a few places bard land skirts the sound, but firm ground is contiuuous along the Narrows and eastward to (]hoctawbatchee Bay. As far as yet surnyed the bay-shores are dry, and ha\·e elevations of tweuty or thirty feet.. Soundings were commenced at Deer Point, the eastern limit of Pensacola. Bay, and from thence eastward the channel of Santa Rosa Sound was thoroughly dC\·eloped to its com1ectio11 with

UEPOHT OF THE SUl>ERINTENDENT OF

Choetawhatchee Bay, the western part of which and its ba;yous, as well as East Pass, were included in the hydrogmphic operations. Oft' Deer Point, at the western end of the sound, Sub-Assistant Ogden found a depth of twentyfive feet. Ten miles eastward the depth in Santa Rosa Souull is no more than eighteen feet. Twenty miles east of Deer Point t-he depth is only twelve feet-, and there occurs the first bar across the souml, the least depth being eight feet. Going farther eastward and through the Narrows the channel is tortuous, with frequent bars, four of which are used as crossing-places, the depth being only four or five feet, but there are intervening depths of more than twenty feet. On the bar of East Pass the sounding party found a depth of about eight feet, and somewhat more through the pass into Choctawhatchee Bay. The current was very strong through the pass.·· Tides were observed at the places on the shores of Santa Rosa Sound by the party of Mr. Ogden, and for mean low water all results were referred by simultaneous obsen·ations to the old tidiil station at the wharf of' Fort Pickens. In the sound the observed tide is very small, and Mr. Ogden states that in Choctlclwlrntchee Bay the water-level seems to be governed entirely by the wind. Before leaving this section the party remeasured the angles of the triangulation g.)ing westward across Pensacola entrance, and from Fort Pickens verified the measurements which determine the positions of .F'ort l\lcRae; those of the beacons, inside and outside of the entrance to the bay; the position of the light-honse, and that of the navy-yard wharf. Sub-Assistant Ogden comme1HlS for energy, care, aml precision, the work of his associate Sub-Assistant Tittmann, and al>:o the services of his aid, Mr. S. N. Ogden, and of the sailingmaster of the schoouer Agassiz, wliich was used in the surveying operations. Afield and afloat the party developed an aggregate area of one hundred and ten square miles.

The schooner A.ga.ssiz was laid up at Mobile, to be in readiness for service in the prosecution of the survey of the Gulf coast eastward of Uhocta whatchee Bay. If the present "inter proves favorable it is hoped that the survey westward of Saint Andrew's Bay may be joined with the work here descl'ibed. Latitude and longitude of Clei·elatid, Ohio.-In accordance with the proviso in the appl'opriation bill authorizing determinations of latitude and longitude in the interior States of the Union, Assistant George W. Dean was directed in the latter part of .Tuly to make arrangements for occupying important points in Obio and Kentucky. He was joined on the 10th of August by Assistant Edward Goodfollow, who proceeded with suitable instruments to Cleveland, and there established a temporary astronomical station near the :Marine Hospital. Unfavorable weather in September made it impracticable t-0 determine the longitude, but 'in the course of the following month clocksignals were successfully exchanged on five nights with an observer at Cambridge observatory for longitude. Assistant Goodfellow determined the latitude of the station at (]leveland by 126 observations on thirty pairs of stars; and the local time and instrumental corrections by 204 observations on thirty-six stars. The magnetic declination was determined by Mr. Goodfellow from observations on three days; and the int-ensi ty from three sets of vibrations and two sets of defiection. Four days were employed in ascertaining the magnetic dip.

GULF COAST AND BAYS OF ALABA~IA AND THE SOCNDS OF MISSISSIPPI AND OF LOUISIANA TO VER1\IJLION BAY, INCLUDHW THE PORTS AND HIVEitS. (SKETCH No. 9.)

Topography of Chandeleur Sound, La.-ln l\laj', after closiug operations which will be described under the next bead, Assistant C.H. Boyd made a plane-table survey along the west siue of Chandelem Sound, continuous with his work of last year, which terminated in the upper part of Isle au Breton Sound. This sun·ey defines the broken ground and patelles lying about ten miles north and south in the vicinity of I~ive-Oak Bayon. The statistics will be included with details whicll·, occupied the party during the preceding month of the working-season in this section. l\'Iessrs. Joseph Hcrgesheimcr and C. H. Van Unkn aided in the topographical survey. Triangulation, topography, anil hydrography of Mississ·ippi Rii·er, La.-Assistant Boyd resumed work at Grand Priiiri(·, alJoni Fort Jackson, late in December, 1870, witb a l)arty in the schoouer Hall. Twenty miles of the course of the Mississippi are included in the operations of this season. The survey was suspeudcd on the last of April at Point La Bache, which is about sixty miles from the light-house at South Pass, on tile Gulf of l\fexico. In selecting stations for carr;ying the triangulation up the river, l\Ir. Boyd met many difficultieR, lines of sight to points othe1·wise favoraule for the work being intercepted by buildings or by c1umps Of trees. The theodolite, moreover, at nearly every point was, of necessity, placed on a platform of timber, to give stability on the soft prairie and to insure the line of sight. Another disadvantage was that arh;ing from the fogs that prevail morning and ernning during the greater part of the ;year. These are attributable to the meeting of tl1e belt of cool air along the river with the warmer air of the Gulf coast. Without a more expensive outfit the currents, as observed at two stations in the river, must also be impediments in field-work, which includes both banks, the current at one place being five miles per hour. The topographical snrrny by Assistant Boyd and his aids, Messrs. Hergesheimer and Van Orden, includes both banks of the Mississippi within the limits of the triangulation, and such bayous as were found within three miles of the river. On the eastern side the bayous were traced to their connections with Isle au Breton Sound. In prosecuting the hydrography Mr. Bo;fd found the depth in the Mississippi much less than is usually repo1 ted, averaging at the most about twenty fathoms, instead of thirty, in the stretch between Point La Hache and Fort Jackson. Before leavmg the section arrangements were made for keeping up, (luring the ~·ear, a series of tidal observations at the quarantine-station. Near the upper limit of his work Assistant Boyd selected and marked tbe ends of a base-line, about two and a quarter miles in length. This will lJe measured by bis party in the coming winter.

Fifteen hundred :o;oundings were made within the topographical limits. The tidal record was kept up during four months. All the registers of observations and the resulting sheets of work have been received at the office. ..Assistant Bo,yd, during summer and autumn, conducted a field-party in Section I, and is now on his way to resume the survey of the Mississippi. Hydrography of Lake Pontchartrain, La.-Assistant J. S. Bradford reached New Orleans on the 10th of December, 1870. He at once took charge of the schooner Var-,ina and a small tender, the Barataria, which had bee11 laid up at the end of the previous season in Pearl River. The vessels were refitted without delay, and the party was in working order early in January. Thence onward soundings were prosecuted in Lake Pontchartrain until the 8th of April, when the limits of the

Deep-sea soundings o:ff the Mississippi delta, La.-A.ssistant Bradford, after closing work in Lake Pontehartlain, laid up the launch Baratarin at Fort Pike and reached Pass a Loutre with the scllooner Ynrina on the 2~d of' April. Stormy weather pre·-ailed until the end of that month, but as soon as practicable deep-sea soundings were begun near South west Pass and South Pass, and lines were run at all favorable intervals until the 18th of May, wheu the Varina, was required for special h,ydrographic work in the Gulf of l\fexico, westward of tue llelta, as will he further mentioned under a separate head. The Jines run iu the Gulf, near the delta, make an aggregate of a hundred and seventy-five miles, and depths were determined at six hundred and eight positions. l\Ir. Dillaway efficiently aided in tllis and in the sulJsequent operations of the party. ::\Ir. T . .J. Lowry, the junior aid, lrnYing n·coYered from illness which seized him on his arrh·al in the section, also sen·ed acceptably. Hydro_qraplty of Trinity &hoal.-This was the concluding work of Assistant Bradford in this section. The shoal lies in tile Gulf of Mexico, about oHe hundred and fift;r miles westward of the Mississippi <lf'Ha. In order to determine the proper site for a light-house the dcinit,r was sounded by the bydrographic party in the schooner Varina iu the latter part of ~fay. Mr. Bradford de>eloped the ground in question by upward of a thousand casts of the lead, and sent to the office a chart sufficient for the present requirements by the Light-House Board. Earl,\- in June the schooner Varina was laid up in the Mississippi, at the head of the passes. Assistant Bradford then reported at Washington, and subsequently prosecuted hydrographic duty in Section I. Geodetic points in Illinois and Missouri.-In further application of the snm voted for deter· mining points in the interior, to serve as the bases of surveys that, when made by the several 'V'estern States, will be in true geographical relation to the coast, I made a reconnaissance in June last of the region about Saint Louis, in Missouri. Assistant Richard D. Cutts accompanied. me in this service, and to bis large experience in field operations I am indebted for an early decision on the feasibility of occupying interdsible stations for triangulation within au area of about a thousand square miles in Illinois and Missouri. Late in June Mr. Cutts returned to the Atlantic coast to conduct the operations of his own field-party in Section II, mention of which bas been made under that head. The locality having been selected for the determination of geodetic points, instructions were given to Assistant R. E. Halter to organize his party and to lay out a scheme of t;:iangulation across the Mississippi River extending to the westward in Missouri and to the eastward in Illinois, keeping in view the determination of spires and other prominent olJjeets as additional points for the use of the local authorities. The determination of an astronomical azimuth and the selection of a· site for a base and its prelirnina1·y measurement were also included among his duties. Sub.Assistants William Eimbeck and 0. H. Tittmann, both residents of Saint Louis, and possessing servfoeable information of tbe country in its vicinity, were detailed to assist in the field. Mr. Halter reached Saint Lonis on the 7th of .July. ·with the necessary outfit and means of transportation the selection of stations was commenced, and was continued until the end of August, when it was deemed advisable to divide the part.y. Assistant Halter, with l\fr_ Tittmann, took charge of the work on the Illinois side, and Mr. Eimbeck of the operations in Missouri. The examination was somewhat retarded by excessive heat and haze in July and An~ust, aud later in the season by the sickness of each member of the party. The scheme for the triangulation so far laid out extends, north and south, from a station below Saint Louis to Alton, a distance of thirty miles, and about the same distance, east and west, from

52

Sugar Loaf, in Illiuois, to Kessler's, in l\lissouri. A site for a base, (see Sketch No. 9,) five miles in kngth, was sekcted IH'ar tlrn station last me11tio11e<l. The longe::;t liue is eighteen miles, and the a ,·erage of the tri:mgle sides about ten miles iu length. Assistant Halter reports that, aftel' reaching the J\lis,:issippi Bluff,;, in Illinois, llis farther progress to the Pastwanl, in the axh; of the selwme nlrea<ly established, '"as impeded by a heavy growth of timber, exte11di11g four or five miles before tlle open country could be agai11 reached; and that he had examined this tract for alH>nt twent,r-fh·e miles, iiortlt aml south, without finding auy practicable opening. If lines of _sight cnt through this lwlt of timber will entail cousideral:Jle expense, the alternatiYe will be to pxtend tlle scheme of triangles down the river to the high lands . which overlook it. Ou the 2\lissonri side the countrs w:is found more broken; and although considerahle cuttiug had to he dmn~, a selwme of ti-ia11gle-s was l'ountl prncticahlP. ·"' .After seledillg the :,;tations aut! erecting Plenm signals, the ml'mmretnent of horizontal angles was commeueed by Assistant Haiter aud 8u b-Assi::;ta11t I<Jirnbeck. The former occupied and observed the angles at the statious of Dryer and Ulark's Mourn1, in llliuoi::;, and ·the latter at one of the stations iu :Mi::;souri. The prelimiuary measurement of the base was made by J\fr. II alter late in X ovem ber. Mr. Eim beck deterrnine<l the azimuth, closing operations for the season on the 1st of tlle prescn t month. The winter bt~ing very unfaYoralile for field-work in .Mist:louri, the different members of the party Wl;l'C assig-11ed to duty on the lower sectious of thi; coast.

Granger reaehcd Iudianola on the :!0th of December, 1870, and before the close of that mouth commt>nced the bydrography of LaYaca Bay. Tlie schooner Steven.~ was used in this service. By tbe end of .Jamrnry following, soundings were completed iu the bay, inclmling altio its branchts, known as Keller'::i BRy, Cox's Bay, and Chocohtte Bay, the last in the immediate Yicinity of the town of Lavaca. l;'i\·e other sheets were Jillcd in the connie of the season. Trespalacios Bay was sounded out thoroughly iu Ft~brnary. The resultiJ1g i-;lteet shows that the course of the channel has changed in recent years, and that tlie depth has decreased to five feet. In Oarankaway Bay, whiell is another of the branclies of Matagorda Bay, soundings were complete<l on tl1e 23d of l\Iarch. Among the clrnug!'s at the head ot this bay, J\Ir. Granger notes the washiug away of a small island at the month of Caraulrnway Hiver. l~rom the careful soundings made helow Palacios Point in the latter part of ~larch aml earls in April, it is shown that Ilalf-l\loon Iteef is gm.dually prqjectiug into the body of 1\fatagonla Bay. Tlte liglit-house is now in four feet water, but the extremity of the shoal, which wa.:s at the light when erected, is uow one hundred and fifty metres beyond the light-house. After soun<liug at the entrance to :Matagorda Bay, in the vicinity of Decros Point, the party moyed into Espiritu Santo Bay, au(l there continued sounr1iugs until the 6th of May, when work was suspended. At that date the h_ydrography of the bay had been extended to Vaudcn·eer'::; Island. Careful tidal olJservations were made during the entire season b~· Suh-Assistant Granger and Ins uid, Mr . .F. \V.

After retnrning to 8an Fraucisco the party sailed to make search for the Falmouth Shoal, as will lrn hereafter lH)ticed. l\Ir. Din·idson has fnruished a Yiew of the entrance and approaches to lVIagdalena Bay. Before lea\·ing that vicinity he determined the elevation of several of the mountains of :Margarita Islanll, which forms the south side of the entrance. The bay of .l\Iagdalena, as described by .Assistant Davidson, is one of the most spacious on the Pacific coast, rh'aling the Gulf of Fon see a and tbe bay of San Francisco. , The entrance is three miles iu width, has no bar, carries a depth of twenty fathoms, aml has bold headlands rising from deep water to a height of about one lmndred feet. The height increases as they recede. The northern head is marked by two rocks like beacons, the onter one being much the larger. On making thr entrance the conical peak of l\Iount Isabel is seen as a prominent landmark, and is easily recognized. l\largarita Island, forming the south point of the entrance, is very bold, high, and broken. In tlie clear weather which prevails on this part of the coast there is no difficulty in making the entrance. The pre\·ai.ling wind is from the westward, and blows directly in, but not too strong for a good working breeze in going out. There is another entrance to the bay at the southern extremity of Margarita Island, but it is long and made tortuous by sand-shoals, and has lt'ss than thren fathoms of water. This channel is never used. The drawback to Magdalena Bay is its large expanse and regular form, which ol>lige vessels to shift 1,heir anchorage with changes of the wind. On the west side tlle shores fire bold, rngg ed, and covered with cacti. Deep water is found close un1ler the shores. Tbe eastern shores are sandy dunes, in part covered with cacti. Extensive margins of shoal water mark that sicle of the bay. Tbere is an absence of fresh water on the sl10res generally, aml a very scant supply of wood. op:slwre hydrography-The steam-vessel requisite for prosecuting off-shore soundings in this section sailed from Boston on the 4th of December instant, and is now on her course toward San Francisco by the way of Cape llorn. Commander Philip 0. Johnson, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Sur-my, and chief of the b:ydrographic party in the Hassle1·, is authorized to make incidental researches during the Yoyage by deep-sea soundings, and other observations, which will postpone for a short period the commencement of regular service on the coa11t of Ualiforuia. It is expected, however, that some advance may be made before the close of the present fi:,ical year in the development of dangen; in the na>igation of the Pacific coast between San Diego and Panama. This will be the first service of the party in the steamer Hassler after reaching the section. Commander ,fob11son is assh-ited l>y Lieut. Commander C. VY. Kennedy, Lieut. M. S. Day, and Masters H. B. Mansfield and E. W. Remey. In the introduction of this report I have explained the general character of the marine researches which will be made by the officers of the party while the steamer is in the course of transfer to !Jer del':ltine<l station for general hydrographie duty. Longitude and triangulati<>n of San Diego, Cal.-For tlle determination of the difference of longitude between 8an Fmncisco and San Diego, Assistant Davidson occupied an astronomical station at San Diego, and b_y the hbera.lit.y of the Western Union Telegraph Company, had a loop of their main line to San Francisco carried to tlle temporary observatory.

After C()IUpletiug the obserTations for longitude at San Diego, the obse1TN'S met at San Francisco, and, for personal equation, recorded seventy transits, on three nights, with six chronogravhsheets. At " 7ashington Square, in San I·'rancisco, .l\Ir.

His reconls, indudi11g sevent,y-one chronograph·sheets, ha ye heen duvlicated, and are now at the office. At two of the triangulation-stations, of 18Jl, in San Diego Day, angular measurements were made to connect the astronomical station occnvied in .May, mul also t!Je ligllt-lwuse, with the sd1eme. The priucipal line of the triangulation Mr. DaYidson transferred to two statious not liallle to ue disturhed by improyements for many years. All the stations were carefully marked.

G:.!l Vel'tical angles were measured to determine the elenttiou of the stations; of t!Je Corouados Islands, and of Table Mountain and others, in the vi·eiuity of San Dieg·o. Near the astronomical station at San Diego, l\lr. Da\idson dt'ter111i11ed the magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensit,y by ubsen·ations co11tirine1l through three days. Triangulation nnd tupography of Bahia Ona, Oal.-Assistant DaYi<lson erectNl three signals on the shores of Bahia Ona, and occu1iied the stations San Pedro Hill and Poiut Duma. After connecting the latter with the main triangulation, he determ iued the position of a station Oil Sau ta Barbara Island, where a signal has been erected by Sub-Assistnut Chase. At the comH·ctiug stations Mr. Davidson olJserved on five signals by one hundred and fift.Y observittions of six angles; and also recorded twenty double altitudes of' eight objects for elerntion. San l\figncl Island will be joined in the triaugulatiou ne.s:t semwu. To that end a signal was put up at the principal station by Sul.J-Assistant Forney. The local surw:y on that islan<l will be mentioned in a subsequent uotice. Before returning to Sau Francisco Mr. Davidson examined the coast from Point Duma to San Diego with reference to facilities for the development and pl'Ogress of the triangulation. Besides the surveys of ranchos bordering the coast which were collecte<l in the jomneJ-, be added details obtained by special examiu::i.tion. Mr. H. I. Willey aided in the work. on the shores Jf the Sau ta Barbara Channel. Early in the winter of 18i0 Suh-Assistant A. W. Chase forwarded to tLe office the records and computations connected with his work of the preceding season near Point Saint George. Ile then l'esumed the triangulation and topography from his predous limit of work near Point Vincente, and carried the survey to the main station, West Beach. Part of the topography represents the western end of San Pedro Mountain; other details iuclude the rolling hills which border tlie coast of the Santa Barbara Chamu~l.

Part of the topography is carried over a ve1·y difficult and wild country, forming the southern tlank of Mount Buchon, the base of which terminates in abrupt rocky cliffs bordering the sea. The mountain is covered with dense chaparral, through which it was necessar_y to open trails. The survey embraces the shores and approaches of the bay, the outlying rocks, aud the eastern landing.

At the end of March be transferred his party to the northern coast for service, which will be mentioned under the head of Section XI· Falmouth Skoal or Reed Roeks.-In July last, aftr closing work at Magdalena, in Lower California, and before the return of the schooner Marcy to San Francisco, Sub-Assistant Gershom Bradford made prolonged search i11 the Pacific about eight hundred miles west of the Golden Gat.e, in the vicinity of a reported danger. The authorities are positive in regard to the existence of the rock or shoal, but discordant, as might be expected, in reference to the geographical position. The assigned latitudes of the place range as much as a quart.er of a degree. During this examination the vessel ran over one thousand miles. Fifty-nine positions were determined in the vicinity. Soundings were frequently tried, but no bottom was found even with the deep-sea line of 1,8-00 fathoms. The weather was favorable. In the opinion of Assistant Davidson, who collated the authorities and conferred personally with the navigators who report the d'lnger, the rocks are probably isolated points coming from a great depth. The deep blue water of the vicinity, smooth when the weather is fair, and the absence of.U-gulls and seals, that harbor in the vicinity of certain shoals, make the position difficult t-0 ftnd. · Another examination will be conducted with a view to the hydrographic development of the vicinity in which the reported danger exists. (See Sketch No. 34.) Survey of Table Mountain and of wharf-lines at Oakland, Cal.-Assistant A. F. Rodgers passed 8 c s

the winter of 1870 at San Francisco, in computing and duplicating his triangulation records of the previous season. He also inked the plane-table sheets of last year, and made a comparative map to show changes at Eel River entrance. Tracings of his survey of the vicinity of Trinidad Head were made for the Light House Board. After tracing on the proper topographical sheet the wharves and improvements recently made at Oakland Point, Mr. Rodgers took up the survey of Table Mountain, the well-known headland north of the entrance to San Francisco Bay. The triangulation made as a basis for the topography connects with that of the vicinity of Sau Francisco. Before completing the survey of the landmark, the time arrived for resuming field-work near Cape Mendocino, to which reference will be made under a separate head. Assistant l~odgers was aided in the work near San Francisco by Mr. E. F.·Dickins. The detailed surrny of Table Mountain will be completed after the return of the party from the upper p:ut of the ;;ectiou. Blossom Rock, San F;·ancisoo Ba,y, Oal.-After the close of operations by the United States engineers for the remo,·al of Blossom Rock, a bydrographic survey was ma<le under the direction of Assistant George Davidson. Great care was exercised in the determination of the depth, and in fixing the position or eaeh sounding, as well as in the reduetion of the soundings to the datum of mean low water. This detailed survey was made by Sub-Assistant G. Farquhar. On account of the strong and irl'egular currents, the time for sounding was limited to one hour at each tide on fair days, and easts were recorded ouly when made in smooth water. An aggregate of about one thousand soundiup-s were plotte,d from over two thousand angular measurements with the theodolite. The resulting chart, on a large scale, is now at the office. As shown by the soundings, the operations of the engineers have increased the depth of water on Blossom Rock to twent.v-four feet. Sub-Assistant Farquhar has made in general the pl'ojections needed for the bydrographic work 011 the western coast, though suffering much during the season from disease incurred in the pros. ecution of previous duty afloat. He is now in service in the party of Assistant Davidson. Rooks fo ]fission Bay, (San Francisco Harbor.)- \Vhilc Assistant Davidson was at San Francisco, a small rock was reported as having been found in Mission Bay to the southward of the city. Going at once to the vicinity with his aid, Mr. S. R. Throckrnortmt, two small heads of rock were found, having only tweh·e and a half feet on them at mean low water, the depth around the rocks being five and six fathoms. Mr. Davidson, after determining the position, published a notice containing the ranges for avoiding the rocks. Subsequently the Light-House Board placed a buoy on this danger to the navigation of Mission Bay. San Francisco Bay and approaches.-Sorne progress bas been made at intervals by the hydrographic party of Sub-Assistant Gershorn Bradford, with the schooner Marcy, in the minute hydrographic survey of the Golden Gate and its approaches, the object being to determine what changes are going on, and to establish a basis for future comparisons. The work has been subject to the requirements of the service in other quarters; hence it was d iscoutinued when call was made for the hydrographic development at Magdalena Bay, which was mentioned in a preceding notice. The party resumed work near the Golden Gate in Oct.ober, aft,er completing the survey of the Orford Reef, of which mention will be made under a se1>arate head. Observations made in regard to the currents have already afforded matter of great interest. Nearly three thousand soundings were recorded by the party in the vicinity of the entrance to Sau Francisco Bay. Tr,iangulation and topography north Qf PQint Arena, Oal.-As soon as the season would permit, Sub-Assistant L. A. Sengteller transferred his party to Cuffey's Cove, deferring until winter the continuance of work near San Luis Obispo, of which mention has already been made. Having measured a base-line of 1,075 meters at Navarro Ridge, north of Point Arena, the triangulation was brought up to that limit and connected with the base. Mr. Sengteller, before returning the. tpp&" ratus to San Francisco, also measured the base which bad been laid out at the commencemM' of the triangulation at Point Arena. This work is now connected with the astronomical station occupied by Assistant Davidson in 1852. Bad weather prevailed in this section during the year. The topographical survey, however, was extended to Mendocino Bay. The following 11yno1lsis comprises the statistics of field-work:

The smoke ot great fires in the forest north of Point Arena conjoined with dense fogs and strong winds to retard the progress of this party. In the course of the season ;\<fr. Seugteller completed the records of his previous work, and transmitted results to the office. He is now making arrangements 'to resumti field-duty on the coast south of Monterey. Triangulation and topography south of Cape 1lien11ocino, Oal.-'\IYhen the season opened for :fieldwork north of San Francisco, Assistant A. :E'. Rodgers resumed his surve~· ot the coast south of Cape M1mdocino. His party is yet on the coast uear Shelter Cove, the triangnlatfon ha,·ing ueen extended south ward from the cape. The region is difficult of access, rugged mountains corning down quite to the coast-line. Ten of the stations used for the triangulation are at ele,·ations of more than two thousand feet, and in order to reach them trails were cut through the chaparral. As the party remained at work after the setting in of the wet season, the following synopsis represents only part of the results of the year: Stations occupied . . _................................................... . 59 Positions determined . . . ................................................ . 75 Number of observations ................................................ . 1,000 80 Area, (square miles) .................................................... . While Assistant Rodgers carried forward the triangulation, his aid, l\Ir. E. F. Dickins, mapped the coast southward of Cape Mendocino. A few miles south of Shelt.er Cove the t.opography will be taken up witlt two plane-tables. Great energy has lwen manifested in the prosecution of this work under many natural difficulties. Some of the signals were destroyed by forest-fires, the smoke from which also retarded operations. At fhis time the survey in charge of Assistant Rodgers comprises three sheets of detailed topography below Ca.pe Mendocino, aud four others on which shore-line bas been traced to a point several miles south of Shelter Cove, where the party is yet at work. Views drawn by Assistant Davidson were received at the office in January, repre.senting the appearance from sea of Cape Mendocino and Cape Fortuuas. The drawings were accompanied by special view:s of the rocks adjacent to the two capes. These, with others furnished by l\fr. Davidson, will be engraved for the general charts of the coast. Sunken rockJJ south of Punta Gorda, Oal.-While prosecuting the coast topography south of Pnuta Gorda, Assistant Rodgers noticed a ,·ery heavy, but not frequent, break ia the water about one mile off shore, caused evidently b~· a sunken rock. The tide was low, and the water, at the time, was smooth, but a heavy swell was coming iu from the eastward. Mr. l~odgero determined the position of the sirnken rock. It is generally known that such dangen; exist on parts of the coast not yet reached by the hydrographic operations. Where, as in the present case, the danger lies near the coast·liue, the practice of steamers in making their courses quite near to the shore cannot be justifled. ln ordinary weather, during which the sea in the viciuity of Punta Gorda is marked by ''white-caps," it is probable that this danger would be overlooked bj" passing vessels. Triangulation and topography of the coast north of the False Klamath, Oal.-1\.fention has been made, under another head, of the occupation of the party of Sub-Assistant .I\. W. Chase during tlie winter. At the opening of the season he resumed work near Crescent City, and extended the triangulation southward as far as the False Klamath. This part of the coast of California is high and rough. The ocean-front of the mountains is about twelve huudred feet higli at the distance of' a mile from the water-line, and, being forest-clad, the region presents many obstacles to the progress of the triangulation. After completing the angular measurements, .Mr, Ohase e.x;tendell the plane-table survey so as to

include ten miles of the coast north of the False Klamath. His party was then transferred to a site of work which will be referred to in the next section. In his general report Assistant Davidson makes fa\Torable mention -0f the expedients used for carrying on the work below Crescent City, after having personally examined that stretch of coast with reference to the means proper for its development.

The outlying rocks along the coast were carefully marked in position and appear on the plane:.able sheet. Rock in Crescmit City Bay, Cal.-In the course of the season in this section Sub-Assistant Chase discoYered and surveyed a dangerous ledge lying directly in the was of steamers entering Crescent City Harbor from the southward. In ordinary winds from the northwest, the wat.er does not break on the ledge, but doubtless does in heavy southwest weather. The rock is several hundred yards in extent, and is not well marked by kelp. The depth on it, as determined by 165 casts of the lead, is 4 fathoms at mean low water, with 13 to 15 fathoms all around the ledge. This danger, which I have named "Chase Ledge," is less than two miles from Crescent City light-house. A description has been published iu the usual form as a notice to mariners. Azimuth at Eureka a.nd Gre1;cent City, Gal.-Iu the course of the season Assistant George Davidson occupied a station of the triangulation near Crescent City, and observed for azimuth with the twelw-inch theodolite No. 37. The record includes 54 observations on the sun and Polaris. A second 1:1tation of the triangulation being used as an azimuth-mark, the connection is direct and complete. For this work the transit instrument was put in the meridian, and eight transits were recorded for time, in addition to twelve double altitudes of the sun. Mr. navidson made 108 measures of thread intervals with the micrometer. The transcripts of the work have been reooived at the office. Messrs. 8. H. Throckmorton and H. I. Willey aided in the observations. The station Eureka, in Humboldt Bay, was occupied by Mr. Davidson for azimuth, with theodolite No. 37, by means of which he recorded 42 observations on Polaris. The connection was made direct, as at Crescent City, by using one of the stations of the triangulation as an azimuth. mark. With the transit instrument in the meridian, 25 passages of 18 stars were observed on 2 nights. The record in duplicate is now on file in the office. Observations for the value of the level scale were made by 24 repetitions with the vertical circle of theodolite No. 57. Assistant Davidson has computed a table of the azimuths and appal'ent altitudes of Polaris for varying latitudes and bour-angles, to assist in placing the instrument in the plane of the meridian. As a result, the time occupied in adjusting the new meridian instrument is less than half an hour. At the astr-011omical station near Eureka, observations were made to determine the magnetic declination. Before leaving this section, Mr. Davidson made a careful view from sea, showing Orford Reef aud the neighboring coast-features. The drawing is now on file in the office. Aids. to naviga.tion.-ln furtherance of the general interests of navigation, several communications from the Assistants in this seetion and Section XI have been transmitted to the Light-Bouse Boal'd within the year. Assi$tant Davidson reports that in heavy north west weather a good lee and safe anchorage can be. had at Dume Oove, two miles east of Point Dume. At present., vesst>ols under stress of weather usually run for Sau Pedro. Assistant Greenwell several years ago called attention to the shelter afforded at Dume Cove. In other reports Mr. Davidson recommends the placing of lights -0n Point Hueneme and .Anacapa lsland, and buoys for the bar, entrance and harbor of San Francisco. He specifies also

the dangers to Tiavigation off Point Ano Nuevo. Special attention was given in the course of the year to exactness in the assigu<>d geographical positions of the lights. After verifyiug the record, Mr. Davidson furnished a complete list for the use of the J,ight-House Board. Assistant Rodgers recommends the erection of a light at· Shelter Cove, and, in specifying the dangers between that anchorage and Cape l\Iendocino, calls attention to the risk incurred by steamers in passing northward too near to the ishore. At Crescent City Bay, buoys to serve as aids in navigation are recommended in the report of Assistant Da>idson. Tidal obseri·ations.-The stations on the Pacific coast have remained under the very efficient supervision of Bvt. OoL G. H. Mendell, U. S. A., who has ahly met every requisition from the office in Washington. The ohservations at these stations are generally excellent, and the observers experienced and attentive. Mr. William Knapp ha..<; remained in charge of the sclfregistering gauge at San Diego, and Mr. F. P. Thompson in charge of the one at Fort Point. Each observer bas also kt>pt up a good series of meteorological observations, and tabulated the readings of high and low waters taken from the tide-rolls by using the improved graduated glass scales furnished from the office for this purpose.

Triangufation and topography north of Olwtko Riner entrance, coast of Oregon.-After completing a plane-table sheet of the upper part of the coast of California, Sub-Assistant A. W. Chase mo\·ed his camp and party to the coast of Oregon, and took up the triangulation north of Chetko Rh·cr, where he bad discontinued work last sear. From that limit he extended the triangulation north ward and westward toward Cape San Seha8tian. Land opcrat.ion8 on thi8 part of the coast are almost impracticable. There being no roads, Mr. Chase was able to occupy his stations oul_y b;y cutting trails through chaparral from one point to another. 'l'wo of the station8 are on larg·e outlying rocks, one of which was occupied with the theodolite. About eight miles of the coaist are represented on plane-table sheet.

This field-work was closed late in October. Progress was much hindered b:r strong winds, ancl during August and Septe1nber by smoke from the burning forests to the northward of Cape Sau Sebastian. Sub-Assistant Chase is now engaged with a part,y at San Pedro Ba~y. Rydrography of Or.ford Reef, coast of Oregon.-This WOI'k was taken up by Sub-Assistant Gershorn Bradford, after the return of his party in the schooner Marcy from the vicinity of Falmouth Shoal, which was the su~ject of a preceding notice. Unfavorable weather interrupted the operations generallJ· on the coast of Oregon, but Mr. Bradford succeeded in sounding out the ship-channel between the main shore and the reef, and partly developed the reef and islets.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Orford Reef and the coast-features adjacent to it are well represented by a drawing, which was furnished in January last, by Assistant Davidson. Triangulation and topography of Columbia River, Oreg01i.-Assistant Cleveland Rockwell resumed the survey of the Columbia Rlver in May. Many difficulties were encountered in advancing the triaugnlation. The shore:s are covered with heavy timber, through which at high points lines of ,sight were required to bring stations into view that otherwise would be hill by the dense growth of timber on the islands iu the river. By well-conditioned triangles, however, Mr. Rockwell succeeded in extending the preliminary work to Westport, which by the river course is about twelve miles above Cathlamet Point. The topography wa:s taken up at Three Tree Point, on a sheet projected by Mr. Rockwell to take in the river shores as far as tbe lower end of Puget Island. His plane-table survey includes hoth banks of the Columbia, which, between the limits stated, is nearly three miles wide. All the islanda between Uathlamet Point and Puget Island are represented on the sheet. The river banks are shown as being high, abrupt, and broken; densely timbered and covered with thick underbrush. In the site of work o~cupied by the party this year there is no river valley; the shores have a steep pitch at the water-line. The basin of the Columbia is from two to five miles wide, and the area between the shores is filled with an intricacy of low marshy islands, which are covered with spruce, cotton-wood, and alder. The islands are overflowed by freshets and by high tides. ·while carrying on the triangulation, Assistant Rockwell determined the positions of notable mountain peaks and ridges that were in view from the stations occupied for his work. A synopsis of the stati:sties is subjoined: Signals erected ............................................... - ......... . 13 Stations occupied . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . ............................. _. __ ... . 13 Angles measured . . . . . ............ _...... _ ...... _........... _...... _... . 39 Number of observations _................................................. 1 7 461 Miles of :shore-line surveyed ........ _... __ ..... _.. _........ _......... _... . 71 Area of topography, (square miles) .... _.................................. _ 13 The operatiom; of this party, as of the parties geuerall~- on the western coast, were retarded by dense smoke from the burning woods of Oregon and \Vashington Territory. Mr. G. H. Wilson aided in the fteld-work on the shores of the Columbia. Assistant Rockwell is now in service near San Simeon Bay, iu Section X. Triangulatfon and topograpliy of Shoalwater Bay, lFash.-For the service in Shoalwater Bay, Assistant Davidson provided a suitable outfit of tents and instruments, and at his suggestion the work was intru:sted to Sub-Assistant J. J. Gilbert. Field operations were commeuced in the spring with a view to connect this survey with that of the Columbia River, and to join it at the north with the survey of Gray's Harbor. Shoal water Bay, as the name implies, is filled with great shoals; the channels are tortuous, and the low shores are covered with timber and underbrush. Notwithstanding the disadvantages tor JJrogress, Mr. Gilbert established a good triangulation, and determined also a series of points along the low wo0tled peninsula which separates the body of the bay from the ocean. Among the points is included the light-house on Cape Shoal water. Sub-Assistant Gilbert surveyed the shore-line and mapped the topography within the limits of his triangulation. The following are statistics of the field-work : Signals erected . - ... - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .... _. 45 Stations occupied .. - ....... - . - . : .. - . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29 Angles n1easnred ... - ...... - ...·....................... _.. _..... _... _.... 279 Number of observations .............. - . --- ................................

Where a lar~e island existed in 1854, the water is now ten feet deep. Leadbetter Point and Cape Shoal water have increased rapidly. Buth are marked by loose sand-dunes that change in form and position with every wiud. lVlr. Gilbert traced the shore-lines of 8hoalwater Bay separately at high and at low water. His party is yet at work, a.nd will continue in the field as long as the season will permit.

L0rtgitude of Seattle, ·w. T.-While Assistant George Davidson was engaged in special examinations at the United States branch mint in San Francisco, his party was at Seattle in charge of the aid, Mr. S. R. Throckmorton, jr., to occupy an astronomical station there for the determination of longitude by telegraph from Sau Francisco, where Mr. Davidson directed operations from the station in Washington Square. By the usual liberality of the "\Yesteru Union Telegraph Company, this work was successfully accompli8bed, althongh the condition of the line w'as much disturbed by great fires in the forests of Oregon and \Vashington Territory, which sometimes destroyed the conlil\ctions. At the Washington Square station, .Mr. Davidson observed 602 transits of 81 stars on 38 nights, and transmitted clock-signals on 12 nights. After the return of ]\fr. Throckmorton, observations were made, as customary, for personal equation. These inclucled 92 transits of 54 stars on 4 nights. This longitude-work, in 4 volumes and _61 chronograph sheets, has been duplicated. No aid being available at San Francisco, Mr. Davidson, under the necessity, conducted the mint comparisons while the operations for longitude were in progress. Before leaving Seattle, Mr. Throckmorton, aided by Mr. Il. I. Willey, determined the magnetic declination, dip, and horizontal intensity at the astronomical station. Triangulation and topography of the Strait of J!'uca, W. T.-Assistant James S. Lawson was engaged during the winter of 1870 in computations resulting from his field-work of the previous season, and in inking plane-table sheets. Eight in all were forwarded to the office, with twentyfive records containing the observations and results. ·when the season opened for fidd-work, his party was organized and operations resumed near Nisqiially. A base of 900 meters was measured in May on the plains, and the line was connected by angular measurements with the triangulation made last year between Puget Sound and Muck Prairie. On the completion of this work the party, ]n the brig Fauntleroy, sailed for the Strait of Fuca. Arrangements were made without delay for connecting the triangulation of Admiralty Inlet. with the stations which bad been occupied on the shores of Rosario Strait aud the Canal de Haro, but the smoky atmosphere made the continuance of the work impracticable at that time. Sub-Assistant Eugene Bllicott joined the party in June, and was assigned to Rerdce with the plane-table on the west side of Whidbey Island. For the extension of his work, points were determined by Assist.ant Lawson from Deception Pass to the southward, the stations having been pre. viously selected. Stations were also occupied to embrace the eastern end of the Strait of Fuca in the general triangulation, aud, by a series of smaller triangles, the upper part of Admiralty Inlet and Kilisnt Harbor were included. The topography was c1ommenced at.Deception Pass. After tracing the shore-lines the survey was extended northward to Sares Head, on Fidalgo Island. Southward of the pass the plane-table work was continued, and finally joined with previous work near the light-house on Almiralty Head. The western part of Penn~s Cove, a harbor of Whidbey Island, is included in the st1rvey made by Sub-Assistant Ellicott. He completed also the topography of Kilisut Harbor, \Yliich had been commenced by Mr. Lawson, who found a good depth and safe anchorage while engaged in the sur· vey.

The survey, however, was successfully made. It shows that between the ten-fathom curves the bank is three miles long and a mile and a ha.If wide, aml that the eastern end is within four miles of the shore of Whidbey Island. The soundings have developed a very dangerous rocky ledge, on which the depth of the lowest tide is oul,y fourteen foet. By the

very strong and iITegular currents, the kelp, which would otherwise be a warning, is sometimes torn off1 or run under, so that vessels on the lookout cannot make sure of the position to be avoided. On the recommendation of Assistant Lawson, a buoy was placed on the bank by direction of the Light-House Board. Lawson Reef was discovered by the party in the brig Fauntleroy last year. Mr. Lawson made the bydrographic development in the steam-launch Lively, in the course of the present season, while conducting other operations in the field, and under circum_ stances of weather very unfavorable. The least depth found was twenty feet. Being compelled by stress of weather to seek a barb-Or, the party found good anchorage at the south end of Burrow's Bay, in a position which heretofore has had no repute as a harhor. Aesistant Lawson noticed, while sounding in the vicinity of the reef, that the tides were very' irregular, there being for several days only oue high and one low water each day. In one case the ebb continued to run for a period of fourteen hours. Belle Rock was sounded and determined in position. The least depth found by Mr. Lawson was eighty fathoms. The following is a synopsis of the statistics: Miles run in sounding .. - ........ - - ....... - .. - .......... - ... _... - . _. _. . . . . 209 Angles measured ... - .. _..... - - ... _...... _. _.. - - _ .... _.. _.....·... - .... , .

'Tidal observationB.-The station at Astoria, with the others on the western coast, has remained under the able supervision of G. H. Mendell, major engineers, brevet colonel, United States Army. The self-registering gauge is attended by Mr. L. Wilson, who bas for many years kept up an excellent series of both tidal and meteorological observations at this station. He also tabulates the readings of high and low waters, taken from the tide-rolls, with a graduated glass scale. SECTION XII.
PACIFIC COAST, ALASKA TERRITORY.

A iiarty in charge of Assistant W. H. Dall is now in the vicinity of the Aleutian Islands, with the schooner Humboldt. 'fhe equipment for service included means for making hydrographic surveys, recording tidal observaticms, and for increasing generally our information in regard to the coast of Alaska. Before leaving San Francisco in August, 1\ir. Dall conferred freely with .Assistant Davidson, who had collected many particulars of interest and importance in his reconnaissances of the coast 1,, of Alaska in 1867, and during his visit to the ~River for observing the solar eclipse of 1869. No returns have been received as yet from the party of Mr. Dall, but report of the safe arrival of the Humboldt at Kodiak is hoped for daily. A self-registering tide-gauge, carefully adjusted at the Coast Su:r-vey Office, was sent in the vessel, to be set up at Iliouliouk, near the eastern end of the Aleutians. At Saint Paul's Island, about two hundred and fifty miles northwest from the pro· posed tidal station, my friend, Capt. Charles Bryant, recorded meteorological observations continuously for a period of eight months, beginning with November, 1870. By his kindness I am enabled to include a copy of the record, which will be found in Appendix No. 7.
<JO.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE.

The operations of the Coast Survey Office have been conducted, as heretofore, by Assistant J. E. Hilgard. The inconvenient and insecure condition of the buildings oocnpied by the office had long o<icasioned apprehension as to the safety of the valuable records accumulat;ed d1iring wally years, besides invoh-ing much loss of time, from the fact that the houses occupied were scattered at different points within a square of the city. In order to correct these disadvantages, a.n arrangement was entered into with Messrs. T. and A. T. Richards for the constrnetion of a. suitable building, situated between the Capitol and the former site of the office, which was ready for ooou.pation

REPORT OF :METEOROLOGICAL
EFFJ<~CTS

ON TIDES, FROM onSERYATJOXS BY PROF. \VM. l"ERREL.

CAllrnRIDGE, }\lAss., .May ~a, 1813. DEAR SIR: I have the ho11or to submit the follmdng fiual report on tlie discussions of the tidal observations of Boston Harbor, pertaining to tlie rneteorolog-ical (·fll·l'.t H of t11e "imlH aml the cha11ges of barometric pres~mre npou the heights of tlie tides. The heights of high and low wattirs for six years, from 1856 to 1861, inclusive, were computed by the formulas allll tables giveu in a previous report and the results compared with the titlal observations and the residuals noted. From the manuscript-records of the olrnerrntory of Harvard College, which were permitted b;v tlie director to he used for the purpose, the corresponding barometric pressures and forces and llirections of the wind "·ere obtained and collated witu the residuals. Tue range of the barom(·ter was then divided into seven parts, a-ud all the pressures belouging to each one of these dh·isions were grouperl together, and also t1ie correspomling resiiluals bl'lougi11 g to both the high and the low water,;, and the averages of the residuals compared with those of the barometric pressures. The observations when the barometer was rising wern kept separate from thm;e when it was falling, in order to determine whether there is any sensible difference on account of the iuertia or the friction of the water preventing it from assuming at c:wh instant the cornlition of ::;tatic equilibrium. The fo!lowiug results were obtained

If the tables from which the heights of the tides were computed were correct, the algebraic suin of all the tidal residuals iu the last column of tbc preceding table for the high waters, and likewise for the low waters, should be o. Tile average of the former for the sm'en groups of observations, giving each equal weight, is -0.024 feet, and that of the latter, 0.065 feet. This indicates an error, -0.020 feet for the mean level, and of 0.044 feet for tbe mean amplitude, of the

94

tide from thP tables. The former mas be regarded as falling within the limits of the errors or' obsen-ation in a series of six years only, or it may be due to a small change of the zero of the tidegauge during the full series. Tlrn discrepanc.r in the amplitude, being about a half-inch, cannot be regarded as falling· within the limits of the errors of observation, and must be due, at least in part, to a small error in tl1e tables. The average atmospliel'ic pressure at the observatory, as deduced from all the observations, is 30.007 inches. If we, therefore, put p for this pressure at any time expressed in inches, we have, for the expression of' the correction of the heights of the tide due to changes in the barometer, (30i".007 -JJ) C, in which C is a constant, to be determined from observation. This expression pu~ equal to each of the tidal resid1rnls expressed in inches in the lower right.hand column of averages. in the preceding table, using the cc1rresponding values of barometric pressure for the values of p, we get se,·en equations for determining the most probable value of C. Giving the equations weight according to the number of observations, we thus getC=7.33 ± 0.05 The theoretical value of this constant is 13.56, this being the ratio between the dellsities of water and mercury. I am nu able to explain why its value in Boston Harbor is little more than half as much. The value of this constant also, as uetermined from observation for several other ports, is much greater. 1\1. Daussy found that at Brest the ocean rises 0.2::!3 of a meter for a depression of 0.0158 of a meter in the mercury, ( Comwissance du temps, 1834.) This gives 14.11 for the value of the constant at that port, wl1ich is a little greater than the theoretical value. Lubbock obtained 11.1 for the value of this c01rntant at Liverpool; but at Loudon he found that the water rises 6.3 inches for a depression of 0.90 of an inch of the mercury, (Phil. Trans., 1836, p. Ul.) This gives ouly 7.0 for tlrn value of the constant at Lonllon, which is less than the value obtained for Boston Harbor. The value of this constant, then, seems to differ very much for some reason in different ports. By comparing the tidal residuals of rising barometer with those of falling barometer at the bottom of the preceding tahle of results, it is seen that there is a percepti(Jle difference near mean barometer, and that the sea-Im-el is a little lower when the barometer is at the mean anll rising than it is when the barometer is at the mean and falling. It was overlooked in my preliminary report, which has been published in Silliman's Journal, that this difference is exactly contrary to what we would suppose it would be, and seems to indicate that the changes of sea-level anticipate the forces upon which they depend. When tlle barometer is rising, the sea-level is falling; and when the former has arrfred at the mean, the laHer, if the changes are retarded by inertia or friction, should be still a little above the mean, whereas the residuals in the preceding table, whether we consider t110se belonging to high and low waters separately, or the averages of the two, clearly inllicate that the sea-level is already below the ruean. And almost every individual result belonging to the different groups of observations gives the same result. We cannot, therefore, suppose that it may be an accidental result falling within the limits of the possible errors. of observation. I think it may be satisfactorily explained in this way: When the barometer is rising, we usually have clearing-off weather, with west or southwest winds, which tend to lower the sea-level, and consequently they more than counteract, the effect of inertia or of friction, if these latter effects are at all sensible; when the ba.rometer is falling, we usually have east winds, or at least an absence of west winds, and hence the sea-level at this time is a little above the mean level from this cause. In orde1· to obtain the effect of the winds from the different points of the compass upon the heights of the tides, all the tidal residuals for tbe six years belonging to the winds from each of the eight principal points of the compass were grouped together, and. the averages taken, and also the corresponding average forces of the winds and of the barometric pressures. The forces of the winds in the record of the observations were denoted_ by the numbers o, 1, 2, 3, and 4 ; O denoting a calm and 4. the strongest winds recorded.

The number of observations in the second column denotes the relatin frequency of tlie winds from the several different points of the compass. From tl.te column of barometric pressures it is seen that with winds from NVV. around by N. to SE. tbe barometer stands above the mean, but tllat with winds from SE. around by S. to NW. tlle Larometer stands below tbe mean. Tlie U\·erage tidal residuals foHow very nearly the same law. The full effect of tlie wind, tlierefore, is 11ot shown by the fifth column, since the tidal residuals are always ttffected by tt correspondiug chauge in the barometer, and require to be corrected by tile preceding expression of the correction with tlie value of the constant 0 as determined. The last column, containing the residuals thus corrected, inclicates the effect of a wind from each of tl.te several points of the compass haYiug the average force of the wind from that 1ioint. It is pretty generally thought that the 'rinds cause Yery considerable changes of sea-lernl, hut it is seen from the last column of the t.able al.Jove that an awrage NE. wind rai8es the sea-lenl only about three inches, and that a SW. wind depresses it not quite so much. If t11e numbers in the scale of forces represent the velocities of the winds, the elevating and depressing eftect of tl.te winds may not be proportional to the forces, so that a strong wiud denoted by 4 in the scale may raise or depress tbe sea-leve.I three or four times as much as a wind of a1erage force., this depending upon the law of friction between the wind and the water. Very strong winds, therefore, may change the sea-level in Boston Harbor a foot or more; and this agrees well with indfridual observations. Of about 700 tidal residuals of 11igh water throughout the year 1859, ol1tained from a comparison of computation by the formulas and tables with observations, only ten amount to as much as one foot. If, therefore., we suppose that these residuals are due to the effects of the winds only, and no part of them to other disturbing causes,. and to errors of the tidal formulas all(} talJles, even· upon this supposition we know by actual measurements with the tide-gauge that in the course of a whole year, the sea-level of' Boston Harbor is not often changed by the winds as much as one foot. An important meteorological result is shown in the fourth column of the preceding table, which is that the barometer during calms stands very near the maximum of all tlJe averages of the winds from the different quarters. This indicates that the winds are genernl1y of a c~·clonic character, prevailing mostly in the interior of the cyclones where there is harometric depression, and that the calms are mostly in the external part where there is higll barometer. The followrng table of results brought out in the dii<cmsion shows the annual chnngcs of tlle barometer. As the unreduced observations were used, a correction for temperature in this case I.las to be applied, to reduce the barometer to the mean of the year to correspond with the preceding results, in which tlte average corresponds to the mean temperature of the year, or to reduce them, as usual, to the temperature of freezing.

The num b<'r of obsen·ations denotes~ also, the Telative frequenc:y of the winds from the different poiuts of tlw compass. It is seen ti.mt the predominating winds are from '\V, aud SW. during all seasons of the ;year. The numbers headed S. F. are the sums of the numbers in the obsen·ations denoting the forces of the wiutl. There is some uncertainty with regard to the ;male used b.r Professor Doud in denoting the forces, but it is supposed to be tlrn scale from 0 to 6, in which 0 denotes a calm and 6 a velocity of eighty-five miles per hour, the numbers representing the ~rces being very ucarly proportional to the velocities. At any rate, the sums of the forces above may be regarded as repTesenting the relati-ve snms of the distances passed over witLiu the limits of the errors of snch obser\'atious. With a tallle of latitude 1tnd departure, therefore, we readily determine the relati,·e distances passed over and the directious for eacil season of tbe year and for the whole year. We thus get the following table of directions from which the wind blows, and the relative distances traveled over : Winter. . . . . . . N. 780 W. 126 Spriug ...... _ . N. 85 W. 386 Summer ......

The scale is oue foot to the inch. The effect of the winds upon the barometer, if it is nn effect, and the winds and the changes of barometer do not belong to some common cause, is indicated by the ordinates upon the circumference of the outer circle. These onlinate;; repn'sent thl' absolute amount of change in the height of tlle mercurial columu. It also contaiui:, a representation of the relative amounts and of the directio11s of the wind for each of the four seasous and for the whole ,vear. lt is re;ulily seen from tllh; that the resultants are mostly in au easter!~- direction, and that the motion east, during the winter is nearly twice mo/ much as it is <luring tlle summer. The effect of the east winds upon the resultant for the springHf'ason is also seen. 8ketch No. :18 contains a graphic rl"ln'esentation of the heights of the tides and of the lnnitidal intervals given l>y the tables arnl h_y observations, and of the effects of the win<ls and changes of atmosvheric pressure, for the month of Julr, 1858. This is the time when the obliquity of the Ill·)on's m·bit to the equator is greater than in any other part of the whole series, and, consequently, when the dinrnal tide is the greatest. This causes the alternate heights of high and low waters to be greater and less, as represented in the sketch, near the times of the greatest declinations of the moon, the maximum of the luuar and principal part of this effect occnrring two da;fs after the greatest declination. At this time, also, the moon's perigee occurs near the time of one syzigy and its apogi;e n<'ar the time of the other. Hence the predominating influence of the lunar parallactic ine· quality oYer that of the solar, or l1alf-mout.hl:y, is well represented by the sketch. At the time of the new moon and the moon's perigee these two iuequali ties com Line and make the tides unusually large, but at the time of full moon and the moon's apogee the parallactic inequality more than counteracts the ltalf-mouthl_y inPqnality, so that when in European ports there h; a second maximum, though smaller, in Boston Harbor tlihi seco1Hl maximum is eutirel,y destro,Yed b,y the predominating effect of the lunar purallactic iueqnulity, and the magnitmle of the tides do not coaie up to the mean tide. 'fhe augnlar points in the sketch represent computation, a11d the dots ohservatiou uncorrected for the d'feets of uwteorological changes. After correcting the observatio11s for ntri-1tious of barometric pressure uy the formula which has been giH·n with the value of tile constant U, as determined from olJsen·atio11, and also for the effects of the winds as determined in the preceding discussion, the ob;;ervntiom; thus corrected are represented by the dash. Jn general, this correctic·n of the observations improves the agreement with theory, bnt it sometimes happens that it is the reYerse. Of course, this correction for the rneteorological effects is only partial and very imperfect. \Vbile, perhaps, the principal effects depeud uvon the local state of the lJarometer and of the winds, yet a YPr_y great part, nn doubt, depends upon tile meteorological coIHlitiou:; iu distant parts of the ocean; fo1· if the barometer and the winds iu Boiston Harbor, aud for a c011isiderahle di:stance around, were to remain the same, _yet the meteorological clrnuges in distant parts of the. ocean would still cause consideralJle chauges in the sett-level, as well as other oscillations, independent of any astronomical forces. The corrected residuals, represented by the spaces lJetweeH the angular points and tlu~ dashes, deveud upon the imperfection of the conections for the meteorological effects, upon errors of the tables, and of theory. It is not claimed, of eourse, that the theory is perfect, aud the tables do not represent ttccurately the theory. To attempt to represent accurately the theory would require Yery complex formulas and tables, which would increase very much the labor of computing the tides; and since no accurate comparisons can he made between theory and individual olJservations, imch accuracy was thought of too little importance to make these tallies very complex, aud thus to increat-ie the lalJOr of computatio11; for if we had a theory a11d tables allsolntely perfect, so great are. the various a.bnormal effect:-; which cannot he taken iuto the tlrnol'y that there would scarcel,v be au~- perceptible decrease of the residuals. No attempt has been mmle to deterrniue tlie meteorological eftect upo11 tlie times of the tides. 'fhese are, no doubt, very great in individual cases, !Jut it is doubtful whether mucb of these effecti,i could he represented by auy argurnent8. The times, therefore, as represented in the sketch, are entirely uncorrected for a.uy of these effects. Tue very natm·e, n.lso, of such observat.iou1' l'e1ute1"R tlw.m inaccurate; for ver.v Ritmll errorl'I change considerably the mere time of the

maximum or minimum. Ver:y ismall abnormal effrct;; also, abont these ti111e:-;, may <1fft'd very rn11d1 the obsen-<>d tinrn of the maximum or minimum. If the general sea-](·yeJ iR risi11g about the time of high water from a change of barometric pressm·e or the winds, tile time of the maximum it-1 Jater, aud tlrn reverse, if it is fallin,g· at that time. The ahnorrual oscillatio11s of various periods, which are always oliserve1i more or less, ma,y ahm affect VPry much the ti11w-oliservatfom;. In forming the tal>le8, also, it was seen that the effect of the lunar a111l solar Lliurnal tide8 in all their various rclativ~ phases upon the mere times of high and low water could not he accurately represented in all iudivi.-Jual cases without making the tables very complex. The averag·e of an the re:siduals, uncorrected for an_y meteorological effects, belonging to the six years, are as foJlows :

It is seen that in both the heights and the times the residnals are only about half as great, in summer as in winter. This shows that the residuals are due mostly to meteorological effects, and that they are least in summer, because the meteorological changes are then least. If, then, these effects were entirely absent., the residuals would be still much more reduced. The computations of the tides from the formulas and tables were made mostl~· by Mr.·T. G-. Spaulding, aid in the Coast Survey, and they i;emn to have been made with great accuracy aml faithfulness throughout. Very respectful1y, ~·our:;, \Y:\1. }'ERREL.

APPENDIX No. 8.
THE HARBOit 01<' NEW YOHK: ITS CONDI'fIOX, MAY, 1873.

Letter of Prof. Benjamin Peirce, 81tperinten1lmit United States Coast Sun·ey, to the Chaml>er r1f Cmnmeree of Ne1<' York, u:ith the report of Pn~f. Henry Jfitcliel/ 011 tlw physic1tl .rnrre!f 1~f the harbor.
CA-:1rn1unnE, l\IAss., May :;o, 1Si:>. Sru: The resolution passed in the chamber of commerce 'l\larch 4, 1869. has beeu umler careful cousidemtiou during tile inten·al which has elapsed, and a continu,ous in~·el'tigation of all the phenomena of New York Harbor has been conductcu unuer the directiou of Prof. lleury Mitchell, to whom the physical hydmgraphy of tbe 8LUTey has been especially intrusted. ' The inclosed report frnw Professor :\Iitchell illustrates the character anu progre:ss of the 1mn1·y up to tbe present time. In it import:rnt m1merical data are skillfully arrangetl, and iu many casPs exhibited in the forms of diagrnws. All these data ma,y be regarded a;; iiual as far as they go, aud it sboulu be especially consillereu that nothing iu the report is speculative or merely thcuret. ical. Tlle paper is an emuouimeut of facts awl ousern1tiou. rt is ssstematic ex:periencP, which b the most valuable as it is the most fruitful experience. The deductions are not from pr('.judice or unfounded fancy; they result from careful stuu.r and inquiry by men who are familiar 'dtl1 :New York Harbor, aud with the general laws of the dynamic action of waves, tilles, aml currents. The observers ha\'e sought the opinions of pilots, 8hip-captains, and eng·itwers, am! hm'e rwglected nothing which coufd conduce to a jmlieious conclusion. \\iherever, tllerefore, iujury to the harbor is specified, there can be no doubt tlmt the proper reme(ly siloulu be applied \Yithout uuueees:,mt-y delay, and no undertaking can wisely be presseu in reference to the hal'lJOr that is manifestly opposite to the teachings of obsen'atioa develope(l in tllis report of Professor :\Iitehell. It will be observed tltat the Jersey Flats no longer recei\'e t!Je deposits formerl;1 canied by currents upon its interior space. The extension of wharYes, &;c., at Jersey City have placed the flats under the lee, and the deposits now accumulate on the fore 8lope of the bank, so t!Jat the tlats are rapidly growing out into the main cha,nnel. In large measure, tbei:;e deposits are dredg-iug-s brought down from the city-<locks and elsewhere, but some of tile material fou ud on thew is 8tilt to be accounted for. Auy scheme of occupation for the:;e tlats should proYide spl\cially for keepingthe frontage bold, and the harbor-line should not lie far back from the present frout of the tlats. In the vicinity of Middle Ground Shoal and of Gowauus a simila1· movement outward seems to have resulted from the artificial eucroachrnents at Hed Hook, but there the accumnhtion from foreign sources is small, and the changes ousernid have not been permanent. There is no indication that the bar-channels have declined in au.r way. These will be reached by the survey last of all, unless something should appear to attract attention to them in a<h-auce. The Lower Bay anchorage has changed, and this bas been examined, but a further extension of work and close soundings are desirable there before results can be declared. Mr. Mitchell's observations relative to the sub-current up the HL1dson IUver develop the interesting fact that the flood i1redominates below six fathoms. The depth on the bar is about equal to the seaward scour through the harbor, namely, twentytwo feet at low water; but this does not depend upon density, nor has it directiy to do with dead augle. ·Professor Mitchell gives good reai;;ons for preferring middle time iu the East Ilirnr to the time of high or low water as that to be giyen to navigators: first, because it is less liaUle to fluctuation from accidental causes; and, then, it fa uea.rer the tilllC of the most rapi(l rnlocity, which is e8pecia!ly of im1Jorta.nce to the sailor.

IrnPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The whole amount of water which flo'ls info New York Harbor in the course of each tide through the East Hiver is sufficient of it,.;clf to raise tlrn water of the harbor by one foot and ouetcuth. If this flow from the East River iuto the haruor occupied the whole of eob-time, it would increase by just this amount tile outer flow through the Narrows and over the bar, and the ratio which this water bears to the whole outer fiow would exactly represent the benefit of the East Ri\er in prescn-ing the depth of water over the bar of the harbor. Bnt this coinciuence does not exactly occur. The ebb commences two hours before the turu of the tide in the East Ri\'er, anu dnring these two hours the flow is towards the East I~h-er instead of from it. Hence the amount of flow into the harbor must be proportionall,y diminished, and reduced to nine-tenths (0.9) of a foot. Sow, the harhor at high tide has four and two-tenths (4.2) feet more of water in it than at low title, which runs out during the ebb, together with the flow from tile Hudson, whid1 is about the same as that of East River. The whole of the flow, then, througll the Narrows, which is independent of East Itiver, corresponds to five and three-tenths (:3.3) feet iu elevation of the surface of tbe harbor, and this is the amount which wonlu mn if East l{i\-er were to be cnt off. The additional uine-tentbs (O.!l) of a foot which arises from East Hiver gives a total of six anu twotenths (G.'.!) feet as rPpresenting the flow through the Narrows and °''er tile bar. If the .East River were cnt off, tbe corresponding decrease in the flow of water would inYolve a proportionate decrease in the water-space oYer the har, or a reduction of the depth of water upon the bar of about three feet and a half.* Such is tlle measure of the importance of East J{irnr to the preser\':ttiou of the entl-ance to New York Harbor. The loss of this river would iuvoh·e a fatal injury to the l1arbor, and auy obstnlCtion to its flow or recluetiou of its capacity must be proportionally iujurious. Believing that the accompanying report emuraces the pl'incipal points which uesene immediate attention, it is respectfully presented for the consideration of the chamber of commerce, and I ho11e that it will be considered to deserve immediate publication. Yours, respectfully, BENJ Al\1IN PEilWE, S1q1crintenacnt United State.~ Coa.~t Survey. GEORGE \Y. Dow, }ji;:q., Chairnrnn.

REPOl~T

OF PltoF. HENRY .l\HTUIIELL.

MAY 6, 1873. Srn: The physical survey of New York Harbor and its approaches was resumed in 1 S71, and has made, <luring the past two years, considerable progress, so that some results can be stated quite safely. The immediate occasion of the resumption of these, inquiries was a rel:lolution of the New York Chamber of Uomm,erce, elated March 4, 1869, calling upon you to consider "an apparent change going on in the formation of the harbor of New York and its entrance, which, if not soon attended to and corrected, threatens to be productive of very great injury." You, iu reply, named Capt. C. P. Patterson and myself as your associates in the study suggested, and asked for a. committee of conference, which was at once appointed by the chamber, and has been retained up to this time. This arrangement has been a great advantage to me, siuce it bas given me, in fieldoperations, a claim upon your special inkrest and the co-operation of Captain Patterson. I have also felt free to consult Mr. Dow aml l\Ir. Blunt (of t.lie committe.e) from time to time, aud thus the work has been more closely confi-ned to practical objects and wants than it was iu our first attempt fifteen ;years ago. You will not, of course, expect, in this progress-report, any general discussion; I am, in fact., not Jll'epared for this, but I t:1liall take up certain shoals and channels arnl state facts regarding their chauge:-; m1d conditions of existeuce as far as we have leameu.
DEAR "This is a re·uH of a Rimple appliC',ation of the rnle of t!Jrec, The reduction of the depth upon the bar must bear the s;uuc pro}lortiou to the mean tle11th of 24.2 foct which the diminution of tlrn Jluw uf water represented l>y 0.9 bears tu the whole tlow represented hy li.2; i.e., the reduction mnst he a little mom tl1an one-seventh part, or, more exactly, :{;! feet, for tLc water-way must evidently correspond in magnitude to the amouut of water which fiows through it.13.

This datum-line lies above. all marked changes, and is so placed as to fall nearly parallel to the border of the fiats, so that ordinates from it are essentially normals t-0 the characteristic cont-Ours upon the bank of the main channel.

center. Upon these normals we have measured the changes in the positions of the 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 feet curves since 1855, and stated our results numerically upon Table 1. This first table shows the advance or retreat of tlie contours at the points where they are intersected by the normals. You will observe tl1a.t all the cnn·es ha'\'e been pushed outward since 1855, but most conspicuously the 24-feet currn, which in the m·erage lias moved out 303 feet, and at tlie maximum 825 feet. By jnst so much the main channel of the harbor, for l1eay_y ships, has been reduced in wiflth. The extreme reduction stated, bowernr, equals only one-sixth part of the former width of the channel. Iu this neighborhood deposits of material dredged from the city-docks and elsewhere had been deposited for many years previous to 1871, when, at our suggestion, the Pilot Commission declined to grant the privelege of further deposits. As I understand the matter, this commission had designated, as a site for deposits, the deep waters of the main channel off Oyster Island, where our printed map showed depU1s of over l 0 fathoms. Whether or not the parties who dumped the material were careless of their whereabouts, and found it more convenient to drop their loads on the border of tbe flats, we are not a1llised ; but we feel pretty sure from the aspect of the case that the great shoaling in this place is artificial. The greatest elevation of deposit since our survey of 1855 is 31,! feet, reducing to 4 feet depth a portio11 of the main ship-channel where some seventeen years before the Great Eastern could ban~ passed with ~50 feet between her and the 30feet curve. The foreg·oing is an extreme case, of course, but we are able to state that the flats, throughout the entire distance from Robbin's Reef to normal XXXIII, a distance of over three statute-miles, have grown out into the main channel to the injury of navigation. Some excavations, and deposits incidental to these excavations, seem to have disturbed the order of things between Eilis's Island and the Central Railroad wharf, so that no general statement can be safely made concerning the change in the area, of the flats in this neighborhood. If we regard the 24-feet contour as being the true border of the flats on the side toward the main channel, we may state the incrrasc of the shoal-gTound to be 129 acres. );ext in magnitude of change, and most important from a commercial point of view, is the outward movement of the 18-feet ctuve, which amounts in the average to 211 feet, and represents over 92 acres. Upon normal XVII, (the dumping-ground above referred to,) the maximum movement outwards is 930 feet, and upon adjacent normals, 011 either hand, 710 feet. The 12-feet curve haR advanced to a still greater extent on normal XVII, where it is found to be over a thousand feet farther out than in 1855 ! 'The 6-foot curve is so near the general plane of tlie surface of the flats that its movements are on the whole uncertain and insignificant. All the mm·ements stated aboYe are those which have taken place outside (seawaru) of the axial line from which our normals arc drawn; within this line the nearly horizontal surface of the flats has remained essentially the same where unoccupied. At the point of the flats near Robbin's Reef, the border of the shoal-ground has retreated over a hundred feet, except along the 12-feet curve, where little change has occurred. (See Table No. 2.) In Table No. 3 I have furnished in detail the areas of change upon planes of 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 feet depths at low water. Finally, in Tahle No. 4, I furnh.;h the volumes which have been added since 1855. You will observe that nowhere along the front of the flats has there been any lo1ts, but in every reach of a thousand feet a considerable gain-not less than 1,540,000 cubic feet anywhere. The total deposit upon the border of the main channel, since 1855, is 76,859,250 cubic feet, or 2,846,640 cubic yards. To dig out tliis mud again, and carry it where it could be of no possible harm, would cost nearly a million of dollars. This is rather a startling disclosure when you consider the narrow belt that our fi.gures cover. It is, however, less alarming than the result of the previous comparison made by the advisory council to the New York Commissioners on Barbor Encroachments, in 1855-'57; but it is more certa.in, because we have the survey of that council for our ba.sis, and have proceeded as carefully ourselves in repeating the survey. That council pointed out as a cause of deposits the nu wise extension of piers at Jersey City, but their warning voices were unheard or unheeded. .A.s I have stated, much of the recent deposit appears to have been artificial, but there is enough u11accounted for to warrant an appeal to tlle State of New Jersey to adopt measures for preventing unwise encroachments hereafter.

CIIANGES IN BUTTERMILK CHANNEL,

113

In my report of last year, printed by the Pilot Commissioners, as an appendix to your letter
to the president of the boa.rel, bearing date of February 16, 1872, I described the results from a

comparison of surveys made in Buttermilk Channel, and over the shallow ground southward of Governor's Island. The only striking point stated was the diminution of depth on the summit of the shoal at the eastern entrance of this channel. Captain Patterson has disco"Vered, in overhauling the records, that a sounding of 9~ feet was made on. this very spot in 185:J, and omitted from the plotting, perhaps intentionally, after diligent search for the place had failed to repeat the obserYation. It is a very small knoll, and ther<;lfore difficult to find.
CHANGES IN THE VICINITY OF MIDDLE GROUND SHOAL Al\""D GOWANUS BAY.

The eastern side of the harbor, below the Atlantic Docks, was resurv-eyed during the past season by Mr. F. F. ~es, and his party of the steamer Arago. The funds for this work were mostly supplied by the Commission on Pier-Lines, for whose use our chart was made; but we ha Ye instituted a close comparison between this survey and the one of 1855, The methou of comparison which I have adopted in this case, and shall describe below, differs from that employed for Jersey Flats, you will perceive, and yo_u will easily see that in each case it is intended to make prominent the character of the change. In one instance a flat is growing out into a deep channel; in the other the bottom is shifting. In the former the horizontal area and the volume are most important; in the latter the vertical changes of depth attract our attention. Upon our field-sheet we have drawn a straight line from the city-hall, tangent to Rerl Hook, which terminates at Bay Ridge flag-staff. This line, which we may consider the outer chord of Gowanus Bay, we have made our axis of ordinate3, and drawn these ordinates at intervals of 500 have also drawn. parallels to our chord at distances of 250 feet, and at the points where feet. these cross the ordinates we have determinerl the changes of depth, and stated the same in Table No. 7, and Diagram B. It was only by thus cutting up the groun.d into equal spaces that we could ascertain with any certainty the total deposit from foreign sources, and distinguish between accumulation and shifting. The general result is a shoaling, which, on the harbor-side of our chord, is in the average only a quarter of a foot, and in Gowanus Bay, exclusive of the Erie Basin, less than a half.foot. The Erie Basin itself, notwithstanding considerable dredging, is in the average 0.61 foot shoaler now than in 1855. . Referring to this diagram you will discover that there has been a deepening off Red Hook, which we follow along the chord of the bay, and down two parallels ou either side of this chord, as ~fa stream had swept rouna Red Hook and across tke opening of tlie bay, 'washing away the bottoni ii-regularly. It may be that the completion of wharves, extending from Red Hook, has quickened the stream from above a little, and changed somewhat its direction. You will remember that I reported to you some time since the causes of the Middle Ground as observell, and predicted that if Red Hook were extended this shoal would move out. I had not then made the comparison, and was not aware that any movement of importance had really taken place. You may trace in the groups of figures out· side of the shoal upon our diagram a decided movement towards the main channel, and at the foot of the shoal the growth to the southwestward is striking. The lower mouth of the Middle Ground Channel, off Bay Ridge, seems to have had a shifting bottom, but no harmful change has taken place in this neighborhood. The bar of this channel, which lies between normals XVII and XXII, and between parallels 500 and 2000, (see Diagram B,) has shoaled nearly a foot in the average, aml there are places upon it which have 3 an 4 feet less water than formerly. . Within the Erie Basin, and at its northern entrance, artificial changes appear; and notwith standing that much dredging has been done, the shoaling is in decided excess of deepening.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

b11t m1til we can so extend the work as to comprise a wider range than that covered by the bydrography of Mr. Nes last autumn, I do not feel ready to discuss this part of my subject. I presume }\fr. N es will join me again the coming season, and complete this work. The west side of the Lower Bay, as far as examined in our surveys for the Department of Docks, had undergone no change worth mentioning.
TIDES A.ND CURRENTS.

Although I have not yet made all the observations requisite for a complete -view of the tidal phenomena in the harbor and approaches of New York, I have reached that point where I cait exhibit my results in tables complete as far as they go, and therefore I have thought best to ask you to accept these data, and have them printed, that they may be accessible to those persons whose public or private interests lead them to follow us in these inquiries. I shall commence by introducing tables showing at what inter-val after the transit of the moon the strength of the current occurs; I call this the lunar-tidal interval of middle time, hccause I do not use the time of the highest velocity recorded, but the middle of tbe curve (for flood or for ebb) given by all the velocities carefully plotted. This plan suggested itself to me when working on the cnrreuts of San Francisco, where the diurnal irregularities are very large and the effects of freshets and prevailing winds yery considerable. I concluded that, because the diurnal irregularities in the intervals of high and low water have different signs, the time of any intermediate phenomenon (like maximum velocity) must be more or less free of this inequality. Moreover, I conclmle<l that the maximum velocity would occur at the same time whatever constants might enter, so that in great measure this ti me would be unaffected by regular winds or continued ;riverfioods. Jn the case of San Francisco, my computations came out indifferently, but in treating New York the adrnntage of using middle time instead of slack-water is very decided. My method is illustrated in Fig. 1 of Diagram C, in which the observed curve is plotted in full line, while the chords and the axis are given in dotted lines. The mean time of the axis (which is a line drawn downward so as to bisect aII the chords) is what we call the" middle time." You will observe that this element is dependent upon all the obserYations, and not n110u one or two, which might be the very ones affected by irregular causes. Table No. 8 contains the numerical data from which the first figure upon our sketch is plotted; and Tables Nos. 9, 10, 11 furnish all the principal elements of the tides and tidal cmrents. Tables Nos. 9 and 11 furnish the results from act11al observations, while Table No. 10 is a recapitulation of Tallle No. 9, lf,iijusted and extended. This adjustment is effected by plotting the observed results, and drawing through the figures smooth curves, which are supposed to strike out only those irregularities which have been d 11e to strictly local peculiarities and errors of observation. The vertical tides, i.e., the rise and fall, have required very little adjustment, because, being observed for long series, they give, from averages, a smooth curve. Our manner of observing the vertical tide by recording the times of high and low water, and referring these to the moon's transit, is far less certain of giving the truth from short series of observations than our method of using middle time in the case of currents, or even the use of slack-water intervals; but tbt' convenience with which the rise and fall of the tide can be observell enables us to repeat observations till the mean results come very near to the truth. To the adjusted table (10) we have added columns of deflections, depths, sections, perimeters, mean radius, &c., all the elemeli"ts which might be expected to vary the tidal phenomena. Speaking in a general way, the delay of tidal epochs from point to point may be said to increase slowly as we go up the river, while the delay of the current epochs decreases rapidly.
PHENOMENA IN THE PATHWAY OF THE HUDSON.

In Table No. 12 we have given the velocities of the currents at different depths below the surface at our principal stations in the pathway of the Hudson River; and in Diagram O we have plotted the results for alternate lunar hours, so as to exhibit the changes from the Narrows to Forty-first street.

You will ol.Jsen'e from this table (12) and Diagram 0 that over the bar the greatest n~locities near the bottom are reached during the ebb, but that at and above tile Narrows the flood seems to predominate oYer the ehb aJnnu tlie channel-bed.~ whererer the depth c.reeeds si.r. fathoms. In reports some years ago, I called your attention to the fact that for scYeral consecutiYe hours we have at the mouth of the Hudsoa a comparati\·el.r fresli stream running seaward upon the surface, and a salt stream taking the opposite course below. I conceived that in the months of summer, the season of our work, the bead of the river so declines that it cannot balance the sea"'ater, which consequently flows in along the bed. During the past two seasons we luwe taken pains to measure densities, and have traced the sea-water along the channel-bed as l1igh up as Carthage, seventy miles from Sandy Hook; but the surface-water was found essentially fresh at Teller's Point, forty-three miles from Sandy Hook. There is a native oyster found in the Tappan Sea, which is too small for the market, but is a favorite for planting elsewhere, and it was reported to us that oysters had also been found in Haverstraw Bay, and sea-crabs as high up as Carthage, ten miles below Poughkeepsie. In Table No. 13 we give the specific graYities, ol.Jservecl at the different stations, corrected for temperature l>y Hiilstrom's rule. These data were collected by Mr. Marindin, while our current ol.Jsen·ations were in progress in the year 1871. The water was pumped up through pipes, so that no mixtures of different strata affect our table. The density of the sea on the chord of the great bay, which lies between Nantucket and the capes of the Delaware, was observed by me in 1867, and found to be 1.024 at the temperature of 600. This may be set down as the normal density of the Atlantic in the approach to our coast, while yet beyond the direct influence of our rivers. In the year 1865 we made some observations upo11 tem})erature and density between New York and Cape Cod by the inland route, finding in the lface a ~lensity of' 1.0224, and outside 1.0233, which density was carried through the Yineyard and Nantucket Sounds. Observations of 1871, in the Race, gave us a density of 1.024. It appears from our table (No. 13) that in the portion of the Hudson bordering on Xew York City there is no great contrast of' densities between the top and bottom of the sea, although it is decidedly marked at Twentieth street at the close of the ebb-current. Abo,·e this point there is a rapidly-increasing variation of density with the de1lth for the close of the flood-current; but the close of the ebb-current presents little contrast of densities until we get above Dobb's I~erry, or well into the Tappan Sea. ~l\.t Teller's Point, which lies between the Tappan Sea and Haverstraw Bay, the difterences of d1~nsity between surface and bottom are Yery great. H would seem.that these great basins store up the sea-water somewhat, as does the Mystic Pond, at the head of' l\fystic River, above Boston. (See special report of United States·commissioners on Boston Harbor, publishecJ in 1861.) The great basins terminate, essentially, at Verplanck's Point, where the difference between surface and deep waters is conspicuous only on the tlood. Above this point all contrast declines, and, finally, at Barnegat, seventy-five miles from Sandy Hook, the river is of uniform density at all depths, being essentially fresh. Although no critical comparison can be made between the different stations repi:esente«l in Table No. 12, because the observations were not simultaneous, and haYc not been corrected for half-monthly inequalities, yet we may venture to suggest that at the depth of 22 feet at low water-which is that of the bar-channel-there is still ample seaward scouring-force all along the line; that the bar does not lie in the dead angle between the salt and fresh water, but,, in its general character, belongs to the same class as those at our southern inlets; in other words, it is a broken part of the littoral cordon of sand that skirts the coast, and is kept open in this case by tlie tidal circulation, which I have referred to in previous reports as the" life-blood of the harbor."
MOVEMENTS THROUGH 'l'HE EAST RIVER ·

. In Table No. 11 we have given the tidal elements of the East River and its approaches. These elements are from actual observations, which we have not attempted to "a<ljmit/ as in the previous tables. The currents of the East River, from the southern entrance of Buttermilk Channel to Throg's Neck, belong to the interference system, which I have discussed in my report-On Hell Gate,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDE::t-."'T OF

Appen(lix No. 13 of the Coast Survey Report, published separately in 1869. I find it necessary to quote a few paragraphs from this report,, in order to illustrate my subject, and explain in what manner this table (No. 11) differs from those previously given for the Hudson: "New York Harbor is visited by two derivations from the tide-wave of the ocean, one of which approaches by way of Long Island Sound, the other b;y way of Sandy Hook Entrance. These two tides meet and cross, or overlap, each other at Hell Gate; and since they differ from each other in times and heights, they cause contrasts of water-elevations between the Sound and tlie harbor, which call into existence the.violent currents that trayerse the East River. "In the course of our laborious tabulations of the data from m,y physical surveys of 1857 ant~ 1858, it has become apparent that the general order or scheme of the tidal interference is very simple, and that the. apparent complications result from the mingling of local peculiarities; for this reason I deem it essential to offer a general view of the scheme, denuded of all its details, before inviting you to follow through tables and diagram to the phenomena actually observed. "If the entrance from the Sound were closed at Throg's Neck, the tide which comes in over the bar would prevail all over New York Harbor, and we should have on the west side of Hell Gate a tide of 4~ feet range, with its time of high water about one-half hour later than at Sandy Hook; i. eight and a half hours after the southing of the moon. In passing through the gate and SJJreading out upon the broader spaces beyond, this tide would essentially lose its wave character, and become very much reduced in range, so that at the Brothers Islands it would be scarcely sensible. " If, on the other hand, the Sound entrance were to remain open and the Sandy Hook Entrance be closed, a very different order of tides would prevail. On the east side of Hell Gate the tide would have a range of about seven feet, and high water would occur there about twelve hours after the moon's transit. In passing the gate, it would suffer degradation, but not very rapidly, till it had advanced beyond the Blackwell's Island channels. In the basin of the upper harbor, however, it would become very small, and essentially waste itself and (lisappear in the lower harbor. If these two suppositions are correct, we ought, with both entrances open, to find at Hell Gate a tide, whose times and heights are intermediate between those now observed at Sandy Hook on the oneband, and Throg's Neck upon the other; while at other points the proportions would be unequal, accordiog as our place of observation was more distant from the meeting-point on either side.

"Premising that all currents are caused by disturbances of the surface-level, we may see, without effort, that in harbors visited by a single tide-wave, (not materially distorted in its figure from point to point,) slack current must follow the stand of the tide, since at this time the surface-level is restored. Again, for this single tide, the maximum velocity must occur near the time of half. tide, because at this time the greatest rise or fall, and consequently the greatest filling or draining, is taking place. In the neighborhood of S1tndy Hook, or at Throg's Neck, the currents do follow, in the manner we have stated, the local title; but in the East River, where two tide-waves approach from opposite directions, the changes of surface-level, and consequently the currents bear no direct relation to either tide-wave considered by itseif, but depend upon the nature of the 'interference,' as it is called. · · · · · * · · · · · · "These tlifferences of surface-level are the vertical measures of the slopes-tidal heads, if we may use this term so loosely-and they increase from zero to maximum (4.87 feet) in about three hours, then decline to zero in about the same time. · * · · · · · · "The following summary of the leading points which I have attempted to illustrate will serve as my guide in the arrangement of my observed data : "First. Two tide-waves visit New York Harbor, meeting and overlapping at Rell Gate. ·' Second. Near the meeting-point of these two tides, the observed heights and times of the compound tide are intermediate. "Third. The currents of Hell Gate are called into existence by the variations in the relative heights of the Sound and harbor; their epochs have no direct relations with those of the local tide or its components, and their velocities do not depend upon the local rat.es of rise or fall of tide. " Fourth. The current· flowing westward through Hell Gate occupies a greater section than

THE UNITED STATES CO.AST SURVEY.

that fl.owing to the eastward, because the former prevails during higher stages of tbe local tide than the latter." The third point made in the above quotation seems to be con1imied, becauoo we find that subtracting the observed tides on the east side of the gate from those observed upon the west side, we have maximum differences of level at 6h 41ru and 12i. 13m after the transit, and the maximum velocity of the tidal currents at the north end of Biackwe!Fs Island (see Table 11) at 6" 30m and 12h 38m. When we consider that these differences of level and times of maximum velocity are modified by so many local circumstances, the reaction of numerous reefs, the passing of great fleets of vessels, the winds, &c., I think the above agreements are about as near as we could expect from short series. If we had observed long series of tides at Throg's Neck and Governor's Island, which we did not, I have no doubt we should have come much clost>r. Mr. Striediuger, an assistant to MajorGeneral Newton, who has leveled very closely through the gate, tells me that the local disturbances are very considerable as reflected in the varying slopes. We may, without material error, use the following rule for the East 'l~iver current: The strength of the flood-current occurs sfa; ltoun; and a half after tlie transit of the moon, and tlte strength of the ebb-current at twelve ltoul"s and a lialf after the same trans,it, (or about twent,y minutes after the immediately preceding transit.) The above rule at neap-tides will cover the axis of the entire channel from Atlantic Dock to Tbrog's Neck, but at spring-tides would extend easterly only as far as Old Ferry Point. Current observations at the Race were made, but under circumstances not altogether favorable, and those for points below the surface I have rejected as far as velocities are concerned, because I am convinced that the stray-line (whose out-run is designed to permit the lower log to sink to the full length of the conne,cting wire, before the observer begins to count) was not in this case long enough, so that added to the real velocity is the descent of the log in part. Our vessel was anchored in 40 fathoms of water. Concerning the tides and currents of Long Island Sound, Mr. Schott has written a paper in the Coast Surrny Report of 1854. In Table No. 14 we furnish the observations made at several stations simultaneously in a line across the East River at Wall street. The velocities given are those obserYed at the surface, but a pretty thorough examination was made of those below the surface without reYealin g a uy changes which we could connect with the lunar hours. By reason of the delay of the tide through the East River, the relations of fiowage to section differ from point to point. While at Hell Gate the greater section is that of ebb, (westerly flow,) the greater section at Wall street oecurs during the flood, (easterly flow.) You will iearn from Table No. 15, which is made out from very careful data-comprising velocities at different depths, at different distances across the stream, and at different times-that the section during the flood is 91,560 against 86,960 square feet during the ebb. The volumes passing in the two directions aTe much the same. The small difference which appears in the table is probably due to errors in reduction. The mean movement is that of 4,362,300,000 cubic feet in either direction. If a canal ·of the same width and section as the East River at this point were extended without limit, and visited, like the Hudson, by one tide only, no such movement as this could be generated-this is a matter of computation-so that the phenomena we have observed are those peculiar to the co-existence of two inlet8 traversed by diferent tidt>,s. The strong currents in the pass between Martha's Vineyard and the ma.in-land in the neighborhood of Vineyard Haven, where the channel is over threu miles wide, and more than 60 feet deep in the average, are due entirely to the interference of two tides di1fering, like those that visit New York Harbor, both in time and range.
EAST RIVER AND HUDSON TIDAL CURRENTS COMPARED.

Table No. 16 gives in detail the soundings and positions of stations in two cross-sections, one of which was in the East River, and has been commented upon, the other in the North River at i.'orty-seoond street. Table No. 17 contains our observations at Forty-second street in full, together with a recapitulation of the velocities arranged according to lunar hours, and corresponding to table No. 14. These observations are illustrated upon Diagram D, in explanation of which I shall offer a few comment.s. The curves are those for surface-velocities, and do not represent the movements for all

118

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

depths. Those above the axis are plotted from flood-velocities, which take a northwardl;y direction in the Hudson, and an easterly direction in the East River; while those below the axis are reverse courses. In the first figure of this diagram the abscissas are hours of civil time, but in all the others they measure distances from the west shore. In Fig. 1 it will be observed that the ebb is everywhere in excess of the flood, but most conspicuously so in the middle of the river, and least so upon the western shore, where the two drifts approach equality. These curves iudicate that middle time as well as all other elements vary in the transverse section, and that some of the irregularities which appear in Tables 9 and 10 are dne to the circumstance that our stations were not always located in the axis of the stream. ' Passing on to the transverse cun·es you will observe that for nearly three hourn, between HI and VI hours, after the transit the ebb of the Hudson may be supposed in part to flow towards the Sound; while the East River ebb is a tributary of the Hudson flood for scarcely two hours, between IX and IX hours. You will bear in mind that the terms "flood" and "ebb" as a1>plied to the East River streams are ~erely used in their popular eense. The general inference from the above statements would be that the East River is an outlet and feeder of the Hudson for several hours of each day.
RELATIONS OF EAST RIVER MOVEMENTS '1'0 THOSE OVER THE BAR.

Computations made upon the observations at different depths in 1858 gave for the discharge of the Hudson at the close of the wet season, (1st June,) 6,038,000,000 of cubic feet, and at the close of the dry season, (September,) 3,360,000,000. Our more extended observations of 1872 (October) give nearly equal inflows and outflows, amounting to 4,511,000,000, which is aboutthe mean of the two gaugings of 1858. Now, this added to the ebb-volume of the East River, which was 4,383,000,000, gives 8,894,000,000. If to this we add the harbor tidal prism, 17,862,000,000, (which inclu.des Newark and Raritan Bays and the Kills,) we have 26,756,000,000 of cubic feet. The gauging across the mouth of the harbor from Sandy Hook to Coney Island gave, from observations of 1858, an outflow of 27,663,000,000 of cubic feet, which is only about 2;! per cent. more than the preceding computation. Perhaps this little excess is due to the discharges of Mreams and creeks not considerecl in the previous computation, because not gauged. I confess that I had expected a much greater excess, because I had not counted in the Passaic, Hackensack, Raritan, and Shrewsbury Rivers, from which considerable volumes, even in the dry season, must escape by way of Sandy Hook and b,y wa~· of Hell Gate. Without claiming that all the water that comes in through the }jast River goes out over the bar, and aids in the scour of its channel, I think this computation authorizes us to regard the East-River stream as too important to be treated lightly. I think you have fully explained the entire discrepancy between the views expressed by Mr. Dow and those which we have l>ased upon our observations, in pointing out that Mr. Dow is reasoning upon the supposition of a harbor visited by a single tide entering simultaneously by two mouths. 1f this supposition were correct, i.e., if the same tidal undulation came up from Throg's Neck and in over the bar at the same time, the office of draining and 1illing the harbor and river with tidewater would be divided between the two outlets, and the currents of flood and ebb would be much weaker than now through these outlets-much weaker, in such a case, with two outlets than with one, of course. But as a matter of fact, the order of things is quite different from these supposed cases. The tide coming in at Sandy Hook not only has to feed New York Harbor, but for a while the Sound ~lso; and, vice versa, the water flowing in from the East River not only has to feed the harbor and it.s rivers, but the ocean outside of Sandy Hook (being for several hours at a lower level than -the East River) receives the drainage of the Sound in addition to that of the harbor. In this way New York Bar is crossed in either direction by a volume of water considerably greater than the simple :filling and emptying of New York Harbor and its rivers would demand. If yQu were to close the ~t River by a dam, you would reduce both flood and ebb currents on the bar very sensibly, because, as we have seen, several millions of cubic feet would be cut off', which now traverse the seaward channels four times a day. I must add one general statement concerning a harbor with two or more outlets. It does not follow, even when such a harbor is visited by only one tide, that there is a.disadvantage in having more than one pathway to the sea. On the contrary, a majority of the :first-class harbors of the world

THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.A.ST SURVEY.

119

have several. Among sands it is not wholly upon the strength of the current that effective scour depends, but upon the power of these to dispose of the material advantageous1y. Equal and opposite tidal currents, however strong, cannot remove the bars of our southern inlets, because in the short period of six hours the very slow dune-like movement of the sand has not carried it beyond the influence of the adverse stream with which it works back to its old place; but where the eblJ and flood are unequal, the material is swept entirely away from the mouth of the harbor- Now, with harbors of two outlets, it often happens (and I speak here with plenty of obsen-ed data at my command) that one channel is more favorably situated for discharge than the other, so that, in effect, there is a circulation in at one door and out at the oilier. It is precisely for tlie sake of inducing such a circulation that a secoml outlet is now being constructed from a sandy harbor on the west coaRt of Denmark. One ma,y presume that if there were no tides at all in New York Harbor, the two openings would be of advantage to each other. In a northeast gale, for instance, the Sound waters, driYen before the wind, mount up seYeral feet at Hell Gate, and would rise much higher exce1lt that they escape through the harbor of New York, aud out to sea over the bar. In this case the entire Sound is mmf'ul, because it is a shallow sea in which the effect of the wind is largely translation instead of osC'illatfon, (as ht the ocean.) The wind cannot blow from any quarter without disturbing the balance of the two outlets, and thi'S disturbance is represented in effective scour at the bar. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 9.
REPORT TO PROF. BEN.JAMIN PEIRCE, SUPERINTENDENT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY, CONCERNIKG NAUSETT BEACH AND THE PENINSULA OP !110NOMOY.

In the autumn of 1870, (faring a violent easterly g~tlc, a breach wa.s made by the sea through tlie Nam.;ett Beach, nearly opposite the Uhatham south light, and the sea, driving through, attacked the water-front of the town. A short time after thit:1 eveut I recei,·etl notice to join you iu a vit:1it to Hie neighborl10otl, accompanied b,y Rear.Admiral Charles H. Davis, and Prof. H. r,. \Yhitiug; aud after reaching Chatham, we held a consultation with a view to nutking a little investigation into the tcndeucies of these changes ~tlong this portion of the coast. The result of our conferenee was, that you ordered me to 11rnk11 surveys from time to time, auu report. \\'ith this order I haYe complied, as well a8 I could with 80 many other unties, and this is my first report, in which l shall deal with facts only, lea dug all disc1rnsiou of causes till we learn morn a bout them.
PHYSICAL HISTOHY
(U<'

'l'HE l'\EIGIIBOHHOOD OF CHATIIAlVI.

The history of this portion of our coast really beg·ins with C:q>tain Champlain's narratives, It is true that we find some confused references to it in Archer's account of Gasnol<l's voyag·e, rnade some three or four Jt'ars earli<'r, lmt there is i11 this account nothing shi1n;Juq1e; and I arn e01JYi11cP<l that Archer formed no conception of the lay of the land. 1t is po,,t:1il.Jle that the expedition ma.v have approached and left "Eliza he th falc '' hy <lifferent rontl"s; iu oue cai,;e, pa»siug through tbe sounds; in the other, goiug round the ,;eaward islands and shoals, aml tlmt the narrator cunfonmls the oujects seen in these two 'Toyage:,;. For instance, on the 21st of :May they seem to have entered Nantucket Sound from the eastward, anll SJH'ttk of the mainhmd a8 treudiug southwestward; on the same day they fell in with No-Man's Land, which they call l\Lar! ha's Vine.yard-a '' 1li.~i11lwbited ''island, where they saw "fast runuing thirteen savages appare11ed as afore:;aid," and aftt'r lying three days iu a tilace tlrnt I know from experie11ce to be a very rough and <fangerously exposed anchorage, they entered Vineyard Sound from the westimrd! The parties of Ulrnmplain made two visits to Cape Cod, in the first of which they ran across froru Port St,. J,ouis, (Plymouth,) aud in Lhe secouu from "Cap St. Louis," described as lying two leagues from the afort'said port. In both trips they double.d tlie cape, and rau down the outer eoa,;t, but in the first oul~· ai,; far as )falle Barre, (Nausett Inlet,) wliere they fonnd a bad bar at the entrance just as at the present day. From the narratfre of the second trip I quote tlle following passages:* * * * '"The last of September we left Beauport, passed Cap St. Louis, and ran all night for Cap Blauc. In tlie moruiug, au hour before d;ty, we found our8elves to leeward of Uap Blauc, i;t the Hay Blanche, in eight feet of water, one league from the shore, where we came to anchor in order uot to get too near while waiting for daylight, and to see how the tides were. N everthe1esR, we seut out our boat to sound, and found uo more thau eight feet of water, so that it was necessarr to consider beforn daylight what we ought to do. 1.'he water diminished even to five.feet, and the heel of the YeRiml touched the sands, albeit without doing herself injury; for the sea was smootb, aud uot less than threP. feet deep ueueath us, when the title began to rise, which g1cwe us good hope." "At daybreak we perceived a very low sandy shore, toward which \."l'e dragged further down to leeward, whence we sent a boat to sound towards a prettj· high knoll, where they judged there would be plen tJ of ·vater, and in fact they found there seven fathoms. 'Ve anchored there, and at once et1uipped the boat with nine or ten men to go on shore to see a place where they judged they should ban a good shelter, if the wind t:1ho11W blow up stronger than it was. The search being successful wt> rn1rl"iPtl i11 t\yo, three, and four fathoms of water, and found fi rn or six fathoms after ,\,e got in.

REPORT OP THE SUPEHINTENDENT OF

" Continuation of <~foreMid di8coverie.~, and wha,t they noticed rema,rka1Jle. Ohapter XIX.-As we got some six leagues from J\ialle Iktrr, we let go the ancllor near tlle coast, because we had no wiud. Along these parts we descried the smoke which tlw s~wages made, which made us think of going to see them; so to this end we equipped the boat. But when we canw near the shore, which is arenaceous, we could not land becamie the breakers were too higl1. The sayages, !'leeiug this, launched a canoe, and came to Ul'l, eight or nine of tbem, singing and making signs of joy that they felt at seeing us, and showed us that lower down there wa8 a port where we could tiud safety for our Yessel. Not lleiug able to land, the boat returned to the vessel, and tile savages, who had been treated humanely, returned on short>. "The twxt da_y, the wirnl bei11g fan1rable, we contiuuetl our route to the north (Y) five leagues, and had no sooner made th is distance than we fonrnl three and four fathoms of water, being a league and <L half from thl' tihore. Chii11g on a little farther the bottom ro8e suddenly to a fathom and a half and two fathonrn, which frighteued 11s, seeing that the sea broke everywhere without our seeing any pas~mge by which we c~ould return upon our road, because the wind was contrary. We were involved in such fashion among the breakPrs and sand-bauks that it was necessary to pass at all hazards, according as one might, judge of where lay the best water for our vessel, which was only four feet at most, aud \Ye came arnougtlte breakers up to four and one-half feet. "Fiuall.v we succeeded, hy the grace of God, in passiug over a point of sand which juts out three leagues to the snuth-sontheast, a \·ery dangerous place. "Douuliug this cape, that we uamed Cap Batttuier, which is tweke to tllirteen leagues from Malle Barre, we came to allchor in two and one-half fathoms, iuasmuch as we saw around us every\vlrnre breakers and shoals, except in so1111e pla1:e~;, whPI'f\ the sea was not, breaking very lPllCh. We sent a boat to find a channel, in order to go to the place that wejudg·eil to be tlte place that the savages had told us about, ancl belicYed that there was a river wl1cre we could be in safety. "Our boat arriving there, otu nwn we11t a::;hore, and considered the place, and then returned with a san1ge, that they brought off, wllo told us tllat at high water we could get in, which we resolved to llo, and immediately got np anchoe, and were coruluc ted by tht'. siwage, who piloted us to cast anchor in a roadsteml in front of the port, lia Ying G f<ttLoms of water and good bottom, for we conld not get inside, lwcanse O\'ertaken by the night. ''The uext da;y we sent and put marks on the end of a bank of sand, which iR at the embonclrnre of the port, aull thPn high tide coming on we ran in with two fathoms of water.

The distance is again overestimated, but not more so tha11 I haq' ofteu liePn [l!'One to myself when running along a beach which offered to tlie eye 110 o~jects l>y which to marl;: our progress. The sudden coming upon slioals wide out from a Rhore that everywhere ahon· h:Hl prm·ed quite bold and free is narrated qnite graphically, and a.uy sailor who has been s~> unl'urrnnate as to get among th(~ JVfonomoy Shoals will appreeiat(· the lrnzanl of attPmptiug to duuhlP tit(· point within the banks. Of course, the shoals and beaches have shifted very 111iwlt a11d often siIJC('- tlii1' strang<> littl!' ··essel of four foet draught braved tlicir dangers, hut we know from onr studie,.; of sudi shoals that the relative oruer of bariks and beaches remains about thesame, !Jowe\·er the system as a wltolP may change its location. The estimated leugth of the point of sand which he ealls Cap Ifattnri<·r, (Cape Shallow,) 1d1ich is, of course, our l\Iouomoy, proYes quite correct; but I ,.;hall here<tfter show th<tt this is prodng a little too much, because this feature in tile pllysieal g-eography of onr coast has been rather steadily growing since we have knowu it intimately by the lig-ht of good ;mn'e,y,.;. The editor of the wirmti\'e nuder review iuterpretR Cap Battnrier to be Sankat~- Head, Xan· tuekct, in ordfn·, I suppose, to accommodate the distances 8tated. Sankat,\· Ilea<! is no morP 1·11titled to be called a "point<!{ sand:' than Bunker Hill, which is geologically of the 1'amc formation; and how a Yessel corning from the north can doullle Saukaty Head au(l reach ULatlJa 111 Hoatlsr«a1l the sttme day, via Muskegat Channel or round the Vi11eyar1l, I cannot see. Chatham Roarlstead, called on our Coast-Sttr\'PY maps Ohl Stage Harbor, is a goo1l phwc i11 northerly and easterly gales, bnt with Yery strong sonth1H\8terl,\' wind,; it is not saf'1· l'Yeu for able and well found vPssels. T(1e ancient and recent charts of Chatham, which "·11 h:we gh·en side l>y side i 11 tlw skdch that accompanies this papPr, resemble each other sufficiently to Je(WO no tfonbt of id!'11tity; hnt still, by reason of very recent changes in the saml beach (the Lillo in fro11t of tlw prorr1011tnr,\· of Chatham) the likeness is not now so striking ns it would hani been if \Ye had compared tlie auciPut map with one of our previous surveys. It will be observed that the ancient map is not iiropcrly orientetl; it is, in fiwt, swm1g our to the westward some 200 from the true meridian. I am surprised at this, because Oil the predous vo_yage the variation of the compass had been determin<><l at l\falle l~arre, and found to l>e IS 0 .10' W. Subsequent observations have shown that the declination <leelinecl througit tlw whole of tht> eighteenth century, falling as low as 6° 30' W. at Ca,mbridge Univer1'ity, while the !H'f1stmt century shows a steady increase, so that now the declination at U1tpe Cntl is ubont 11::; Cham plain has a good deal to say about the Yariation of the compass, aucl explains with a dia.grnm his manner of laying out a meridian line, which is good. The latitude given in the narrative for Port Fortune," forty.one au<l one-third degrees,'' iH too low by about twenty minntes, while that given for "Beau port,"" forty-thret'," is about as much too high. The distances measm·ed by its run scale of toi.~es upon the map of Port Fortune. arc very \vi)1l; the map has a twist. showing that it is, in great measure, prospective, corrected l>.v estimated diRtances. Notwithsta~Hling all these defects, there is something very re1il about the pictUC"e as it appears in itsoriginalform, with its hills and fields-more real, in fact, than our modern map. I haw~ often thought, when looking at Chinese, ,Japanese, and old Dutch maps, in which appmtr tlw likt>nesses of real hills and trees upon the land and fishm1 in the sea~ that I should much more easily recognize the 8cenes if I were to 'visit them, after seeing such representations, thau by the nse of om· modern to1iographfoal maps; and I believe that if the officers of Champlain, while at Port Fortune, hall in prophetic vision seeu onr Coast-Survey plane-table sheet of Chatllam, with all its com·entional, if not arbitrary, signs, they never would have dreamed what it meant.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

to furnish simply the means of recognition, or even a guide to navigation only. The~' are required to supply some of the wants of civil and military engineers, of geologists, agriculturists, &c., &c. To meet these wantR, with the requisite ecouomy of space, a technical language has been resorted to, which is not so artificial as the signs of mathematics, and almost as universal. This !Jrings me to the consideration of the popular legend concerning a lost island which lay wide out to sea off Uliatlmm. As far as I can learn, tlrn story first appeared in print in the Ma!isachusetts Magazine, aud bears the date of December 1, 1790. H runs thus: "When the English first settled upon the cape, there was an island off Chatham, three leagues distance, called \Vebb's Islaud, containing twenty acres, covered with reel cedar or saviu. The inha"Qitants of Nantucket use1l to carry wood from it. This islarnl has been wholly washed away for almost a century. A large rock that was upon the island, and which settled as the earth washed awa~·, now marks the plaee. It rises ms much alJOve the bottom of the sea as it used to rise above the surface of tl1e ground. The wate1· is six fathoms deep on this spot." l\Ir. Chapin, to whose report I shall refer more particularly hereafter, mentions that "stumps bearing the marks of the axe still come on shore at Chatham." The English Coast Pilot, 1707, has a map of Nantucket Sound and shoals, which contains the name "\Velib's Islaml," extenlling from the fiats below Chatham. ~o island is represented, or an~· shoal ground, except the fiats aforesaid. No mention is made of it in the sailing directions. There are tllree other islands off the poi11t of l\louomoy, called Seale Isles on this chart, which do not exist, but whose sites are daugcrous shoals to.day, which ru11 dry in spots. Let us agree that a '' \Vebb's Island" did exist; it remainR to inquire whether it was a projecting part of the cape or really a separate land. The tradition says there was a rock on it, so we. may conclude that it wai; uplaucl (drift formation) and not a oroken piece of beach. If the distance; "tlHee leagues," is correct, it was separate, because at tllis distance from the land (whether we take Chatham of Hi06 or 1872) there are 35 to 40 fathoms of water. If this distance was wroug (as such measures on the sea usual!~· are in such traditions) but the depth (G fathoms) correct, we may plot the island within 3,000 feet of points in Chatham which have remained permanent since the <liscornr,v of the continent. 'l'he six-fathom line hugs the shore 110w within 2,000 feet at many points. Champlain's map of w~rouvelle Franse" does not give this island, although his officers made two trip" down the coast of Cape Cod, and, on the second, passed this place a league and a half off shon·. These oflicerR speak of l\fonomoy and the shoals, but do not mention an object which, if it bad existed, would h~w<> beeu represented bs them as a terror. Ag·ain, it is said that the Nantucket people took wood from this island. ls it at all likely that they would ban· gone out, passed the Handkerchief, Shovelful, Stone Horse, and the Pollock Rips, to an unsheltered island i11 the ocean, thirty-fiYe miles from home, when they could haye got all the~· wanted from Uotuit, Hyannis, and other points, from which they have orought wood within my knowledge~ They had, in the early part of the eighteenth century, as also in the larger part of this, a passageway inside of tht~ beach from Nantucket Sound all the way up to Pleasant Bay, abo\·e Ul1atham and some i~lancl accessible from this inside passage may have been visited for wood. Nantucket was settle<l in 1660, aml the town of Sherburne incorporated 1687; at which time accounts state that the placP was wooded, so we may presume that they were not driven to importing fuel till one generation at least had 11assed, before which time the strange island had gone clown like the Royal George-nor do we find the stone that marks its grave. Of course, I do 1lot deny that great encroachments are being made by the sea wherever the uplands are exposed to the attacks of the waves. I say upland, because wherever a skirting of alluvial beach is found the work of destruction becomes intermittent or ceases. .And by upland I mean the glacial drift, (so called,) which, if we may judge from 'the underlying beds of shells in some cases, is itself an intruder upon the original domaiu of the sea.* The very locality now under special examination affords a striking case of very recent
*The above had been written before I knew of Mr. Otis's account of the discov~ry of an ancient ship on the eastern shore of Cape Cod, which I have read with great interest and some dissent. As the looality of the wrook is above the reach of our present surveys, I propose to reserve all comment on this matter till I can sound along the shore very carefully next sea.sou.

encroachment by the sea. Upon our two little maps of Chatham (see Sketch No. :r;) .mu 11ill observe that the letter G iu oue case stands for an "isle rempli11 r1e lmi.s," and in the othl'r fo1· the site of Ram Ishrn1, (wash{,U awa;y.) It is difficult to determine how much of an islantl this was in 1606, because the Champlain map will not bear nice applicatiou of its 01n1 l'cale, but it ma~· haYe been a l:mndred acres. It WftS at that time 1irotecte<l from the ,;ea by the heacl!. Upon our fh·"t t-0pographical map, that of Mr. Gliick, in 184i, this islaml h; still fonm1, i,dth au arpa of thirte.eu acres, an elevation of twenty feet at several points, and a house or buil<ling- or sonw kind upon it. Its situation relative to the ocean liacl changed; a broad iulct I.mu opened direct!~- Lefore it, and exposed it to the fury of the storm-waves. .:\fr . .:.\Iariudin, from recent iuquiry at Chath;un, learns that this is\a11d had been used as a pastllre down to 18f>1, when the remarkable :\Ii not'" gale cs~en tiall.r closed its bistor_r. Traces of it remained for sernral years, but :\fo,;sr,;. Atlam.-; aud :\farindin, wl10 made a topograpliical smTC\Y therPahout. in 18G8, saw nothing of it. But the neighborlwod of Chatham has not hee11, generall)·, 01ie of great change sinm· the time of Uhampiain, except in the continual shiftiugs of tlm littoralcor(l01~ of saud which skirts the shore. Upon each of our little clingrarm; of Chatham (see Sketch X(). 3.'J) you will obsen·t· a pond mal'ked E. It is a fresh pond in a hollow of the upland, and i8 no nearer tlw u:ater ·now titan it-n·as t11·0 lwndred arid sixty-.~·iaJ years ago, although the ocean has l>WPpt away and re-formed the beaeh in front repeatetll,,-. This strip of beach is familiar as a phssical feature, and falls nuder tile general designation of the littoral cordon, a name wbicll was applied to it by .M. Elie de Beaumont in his Geologic pratiquc. upon tile New England coast it appears only here arnl there in a sporadic way, hut be\01Y ·Mont.auk Point, Long Island, it is the characteristic feature all the way to Yucatan. I have discussed this formation somewhat at length in my article ou the "Reclamation of ti(lelands," antl shown in what manner it appears as the residual deposit after the siftrng of tile material torn from the coal-it b,r the waYes . .Although it. is prom~ to shift, its position aud change its form, its presence, ou the whole, betokens a check iu the conquest of lantl hy the sea. In the iustauce hefor<> us there wou!tl seem to have been a general falliug hack of the cordon si1we luOli, but if we compare the two charts by using the distance from the pond H to the south eud of l\Iorris Islawl as a l.Ja;,;e, the ellauge is not large. I see no positive iudicatio11 that the cordon is undergoing final destn1cti011, although I CiUInot find that at any previous period its area llas beeu so ;,;mall as no1Y. The map of Hi06 shows a passageway between J\Iorris Island and the maiu-l:md, and I find that the closure of this strait occurretl between li5:l and 1772.* This "it;laud" is nplallll (drift) and is conneeted uow hy a sanely cordon with the adjacent; uplands of the 111ain-land. Tliis i;andy cordon has blown np into dunes, and a salt-marsh has formed in the rear of it, o,·cr a channel which used to be navigable. Mr. Marindin leclrnetl, ll'hile recently i11 Cba.tham, t.Imt trnditiorn; of this strait were quite familiar among the people, aml that the last yessel that attempted the 1m,.,.age was a pinkey schooner. Thl~ elosure resulted from the falling back of the he:tch; antl npou Des Barres' map of 1764 fffouomos appears as a peninsula extending sonthward from :\Ioni" Islam! aud the maiu-land. Monomoy is a projection of the littoral cordon, and has cyidently been built of mnterials torn from the cape-shore, anu its sea ward aproning, under the attacks of a northeast 8ea, and is, therefore, very modern in a geological sense, but not recent, I think, from a historical point of new, as rny accomplished young friend, H. N. Chapin, has presumed it to be in :t reeent communicati()IJ. It appears as a triangular shoal or dry flat upon Champlain's maps, and was referred to in tlw narrative quoted above quite distinctly. .A century later it appears upon the chart of the English Coast Pilot as a large and broad island, and in the sailing· directions it is said to lie "from the tail of the Horse Shoe about niue leagues ENE. 11 Its point now lies NE. by :K :! E .. (true,) eleven and t!Jreefourths miles from the same place. .As no part of Monomoy conld be seen from t.he Ilorse Shoe, and as th{'! distance was a matter of lo.ngitude, it is uot remarkable that the estimate i;;hon!tl be very wild.

l{EPORT OI,' THE SUPJ<JRINTEXDENT 01<'

In the "Descriptiou of Barnstable,'' (1802,) published in the Massachusetts Historical Collection, the locatiou of a h umaue house is carefully stated to be "fonr miles from the end of Mono111oy Point. and six mile:;; frorn Chatham flrrat Hill, winch bore N. by vV." Plotting this upon our chart, with iJearing correeted for variation, it appears that the liouse was situated clo"e to the present outside shorc-liue near \\'reek Cove. J'>Ionomo_.,- Island, and that the point of the beach lacked but a quarter of a mile of being as far out in 1802 as in 1853, (the date of our first Coa:;;t Survey topographical sheet.) In thi" paper of 1802 it is stated that the bl'ach has been "continually gaining during the past fifty years." Of conrst', there are tileuty of maps extant which give different testimony, some of them pnblishl:'d this ,-ery year; hnt all eYideuce i::.; ruled out which is uot from sources the mariner would respect, because to him ;mu his protectors only llad this worthless strip of heach t,he slightest significance. It \\·as to him ct terror, allll chart-maker8 as well a8 ltu11uwe societiei:; made themselves familiar \Yitll its locatio11. Sine(· 1830, l\:Ionomoy ilaR llecn ad\·ancing with great rapidity into Nantucket Sound, the point moviug' out, at the rate of J;~,-; feet per annnm bet,wceu 1833 arnl 185G, and 157 fret per annum hdween JS;ifi all(! 1SH8. Like Sandy Hook, a similar fonmition at the mouth of Xew York Harbor, tliis peninsnl:t of ::\louomoy seemti to have made alternately loug pauses and n1pid strides in its prog-retis ~eaward. If thit-i movcme11t should contimrn till it paHses on to the Handkerchief Shoal, a grand harbor of incalculalllc value may be created in place of the little Pow<ler Hole, which lms recently ceased to be. A movement similar to tlii~, no doubt, fornwd the graml harbor of Provincetown at the extremity of the cape, and l refer yon to Prof. H. L. vVuiting's report of 18G7 for very interesting remarks coucerning· it. The tirnt mention of a harbor in the peninsula of ~Ionomo~- that I find is in the "Description of Barm;ta hle" beforn mentioned. It is c;tlled ' 1 Stewart's Bend," and is said to afford 1Safe shelter in tluee or four fatl1oms. Tlte "\Yord "bcnd' 1 indicates that it received its name before it was actually a harbor-while it was only a hook. In my boyhoml the 1,owder Hole was considered avers Yaluable harbor of refuge, but wlien I ran into it with the Coast-Surrny schooner Bowditch in 1856, forty tisbi11gYP»sehi, which lay there at anchor, packed it nearly full. Three fathom:;; at low water could be can'ie<l into thiR snug· little pface when our chart of 1854 was issued, but Mr. Chapin found but two feet at the time of biH recent visit.
UECEN'l' l¥10VEMEN'l'S OF CHATHAM BEACH IN DETAIL.

::liucc the consnlt;1tio11 held at Olmtham in the ant,umn of 1872, 1\ir. Marimlin has made mw reg·nlar plaue-table snney in Jannar,y, and a compa81:'-sun~ey duriug the present month. I quote the following clauses from llis report to me of December 10: "::li11ce our Hurn·y of Chatham Beach in January, 187'.2, many changes have occurred, which I ban' noted in my last, Yisit to tl1is place ou the 6tl1 of December, 1872." "The two iulets, one known as the~ ortll Inlet, into what was called Old Ha1·bor, at the southern extremity of Plea:mnt Bay, antl the iulet which was made November 15, 1871, during au easterly gale, nearly op11osite Chatham lights, still exist. The former does not appear to have changed, but the latter has altered materially. The south end of the beach, (north end of opening of No\'ernher 13, 1871,) which in January last had been thrown nearly midway into the harbor, has gradually extended in a southwesterly direction, and, curving to the westward, has joined on the main land near Chatham lights. The height of the beach, where last winter there could be found two fathoms of water, is nearly three foet above high water, with a width Yar;yiug from 100 to 135 feet. The whole beach as far as the inlet of 1851, to the north, is gradually weakening and must finally be beaten in 011 the Uhatham shore." "The north cud of the beach at this opening (now Monomoy Beach, since it is connected with Monomoy Island) bas retreated to the southward, ruaking the beach wider, as the opposite beach (at the north side of the inlet) does not seem to have followed the same course, but has turned off towards the main to the westwar·d; and during the latter part of October last, when the north end

"From information gatllered among the old inhabitants of Cliatliam, we find that great d1m1ges have taken plaee in the shores of this part of the cape.

Th(~ testimony of the preceding tables must not be understood as extending beyond the districts stared, because a large part of the littoral cordon on this part of the Cape Cod sl10n1 has remained unchanged since 1847. · I have already referred to a report from Mr. Chapin, aid i11 Mr. Granger's Coast-Survey part.r, touching· this portion of Cape Cod. He was sent hy my request to in11uire into the circumstances under which the Powd1"r Hole had been lost. He takes one of the interpretations of Archer;R 11arratiYe, and giYes to :l\Ionornoy a brief existence. I have no confidence in the narrath'e, but the physical history of .Mouomoy is au open <1uestio11. lf during the past two or three centuries the rate of growth southward has been as rapid as it has been since our sun·ess, there could not ha\'e been much of it in existence at the time of Gosnold's voyage. In my discussion of the case from old maps, I ham concluded for myse(f that this pe11insula is much older tha11 our knowledge of the coast; perhaps not as dr]/ lanrl, however. I do 11ot regard the sliore-line of these beaches as an important contour from <i ph!fsical po-int of dew,_ but would rather take submerged curves, for instance, the outline of the base of such a sl10al upon the floor of the ocean. In the instance of Sand.r Hook, New York, or BrewRter Spit, in Boston Harbor, the arh-"ance is like that of a great mole building out into the sea, and it h; more easily traced near the bottom, w!Jere it is not modified by causes so irregular as those near the surfaee. I think Mr. Granger's h_plrographic sun·ey, now in progress, will throw more light on this queRtion which Mr. Chapin has raised. He preimmes that tlrn mat,erial which is adding to the point is from the waste of the Cha.tham Beach, &c. In the case of Sandy Hook, I was able by depositing materials of different specific weigbt.s, at different depths along the coast, to determine precisely whenee the building materials came, (1857-'58.J I found the source of supply in the neighborhood of Loug Brauch, twelve miles below the point of tlie Hook, where tho upland has no protecting· cordon of sand. I shall ask Mr. Chapin to make similar experiments ou the Monomoy shore. · Mr. Chapin learned that seventy-five years ago, before Monomoy extended as far as now, there were islands on the shoal beyond, aud, as we knew from our charts, very shallow spots exi.sted off the point before the recent advanee.

APPENDIX No. 10.
HINTS AND SUGGESTIONS UPON THE LOCATION OF HARBOR-LINES, BY HE;l/RY MITCHELL, UNITED STATES COAST SCRVEY.

Although we have, from time to time, through many ye~us, been calleu upon to advise in fixing the safe and commodious Jimits of encroaclmrnnt upon the harbors along onr coast, we should find ourselves greatl,v em harrassed in the attempt to la;r down rules for future guidance, because in· almost every case that has arisen occupatiou· of the water-front has already taken place in an irregular and iujurions manner, and experts hase been called iii not so much. to undo the wrong as to stay its further progress. Nevertheless, there arc certain elements that enter into the 1liscnssion.,of all cases, and other elements that always appear in specific classes of cases, which we propose to make the subject of this unambitious paper. Our harbors ,qcnerally.-If we nm over a list of those sheltered indentations of the coast which ha \"e served us fol' harbors of trade or refnge we distinguish ·ery readily two grand clidsions, into whicll they cau be more or lesr-: accurately grasped. These are inlets, i. e., breaks through the littoral cordon of Sftnd that skirts tlJe com;t, aml arms of the sea, or .fiord.~. Sharply-defined instances of the ftrst class are quite numerous along our southern coast, and Port Hoyal, S. C., ma,y be taken as a type. So of the f!ecoml cla1<R we haYe many examples, especially along the sea-board of New England, where we may select Portsmouth, N. B., or Casco Bay as a type. Most of our riYers tind their way to the ocean tbrouqh inlets and fiords. It ill true that the Mississippi, scorning alike assistance and restraint, makes its way to the sea with no obstruction uut its own debris; but this is exceptional. Many of our great ri\"ers, like the Rio Grande, Alabama, Savaimah, and Cape Fear, arc pooled near the 1<ea-board within barriers of sallll mtst up by the waves, through which the~- with difficulty maiutain passes with the help of the tides; others, like ·the Saint Lawrence, Penobscot, Kennebec, Delaware, and Susquehannah, find their way through depressions more ancient than their action; while, in the case of the Hudson, we have a stream whicu empties its waters through a fiord in one direction aucl an inlet in the other. These considcratiuus, aud the fact that rivers, Lowevei· great iu volume, effect but small changes at the sea-board by reason of the superficial flow of their light waters over the more dense waters of the sea, seem to warrant our ignoring the rizier-mmitli as a distinct form of harbor, and make our two grand divisions all-sufficient. The principal points of distinction between inlets and fiords are as follows : The inlet has a depression between the chops, indicating that the waters escape under restraint, and the material missing from tho depression is piled up by the sea outside as a bar. There is usually an inside bar also. The fiord has no depressiou at its mouth, and no bar outside or inside. Both of these great classes are sul~ject to interior obstructions from accumulations of sand and m Lid, aud present in their sheltered portions similar characteristics; they differ usually in the amount of material supplied for shoal formations, although they often agree in their dependence upon the working-power of currents for the maintenance of their principal avenues. The fiord in its natural state, if not the recipient of fresh-water streams; is usually slow to· change along its deep-water ways. The dash of the waves may wear its shores and extend its superficial area, but little of this material finds its way into the deep water. The small depth. of silt on the bottoms of our great ponds in New England illustrates the slow progress of accumulation in still water. Dead angles along shore and abrupt <lepre8sions in the bottoms of the fiords of Maine are often found to be filled up with mud and sand ; and if these are not imshed out by artificial chaugc of regimen, the more central channel-ways fill up very slowly. If strong tidal currents occur in the fiord, the ch:mnel-ways they traverse arc maintained; but the flats and dead angles receive deposits in greater ratio than they would if the fiord were tideless, because the

tides not only asRist in washiug away the banks, but they bring· in from outside materiaJ snpplie(l by the break of the sea along the coast, and tliis is in excess of \Yhat is carrie'1 off by the same ageucies. 'fhe considerations to be entertained in locating harbor-lines may be arranged under the following heads : 1st. No 1mrroaclwwnt should be su:ffered that will materially reduce the tidal rnlume, and by this means lessen the scour of the cu1-rents that maintain the channel" belo1c. 2d. Xo encmach111eut i;lwuld be s1~(fered that 1dll [1reat7.11 augment the scour in th<' le8s important portions ol the harbor, if the material of the bottom is yielding and likely to be swept do1rn into more valuable parts of the port. · 3d.

"'e shall proceed to take up these propositions in detail, and discuss their application.
VALUE OF TIDAL VOLU::lfE.

That in most of our tidal harbors the maintenance of the channels depends npou the preservation of the iuterior rese.n-oirs with which tlte-y communieLte is a gerwral proposition so readil,y admitted by all who are coll\'ersant \vit.lt the subject that we need not discuss the gmieral case. But since the only purpose that a comnmnity can have in 1n·otecting a 11ort. against ii1jur.r is to make the most of it, now and hereafte1·, for commercial u.'>es, it behooYes us to stud.\- the degree of harm which encroachments at any desirable iioint may effect, and to draw the line carefully between use and abuse. If we compare di;ffer nt harbors \Yith eacll other, we discover that. tlieir ua>i~able facilities do not vary in the ratio of their tides, whether we regard rise or vo1nme. If, however, we compare repeated surveys of the sa.nie port, we fiml that a loss of tidal volume, by the filling up of a reservoir, has been, as a general rule, followed b,Y a decline of section in the elrnnnel which formerly served as a conduit for filling and drainiug this basin. The first comparisou teaches that upon the arrangement and relatfre location of the resenoirs, as much as upon their tidal capacity, depends the existence of channels suited to our uses; while the second comparison shows that a tidal reservoir is worth preserYing ouly in the proportion that its filling and draining tends to presel've the particulal' channels useful to commerce_ Compensation in kind.-It bas many times been proposed by harbor-authorities to establish a law in each port that "for all encroacl1111ent.~ i1pon tide-icatCI', restitution in kind Nltould be made clsc1cl1ere." If by "elsewhere" is meant i'.n adjacent portion8 of the same basin, this would be a safe rule of conrse; but if a transfer to another basin, or even to quite another part ·of the same basin, is within the meaning of the rule, it is a dangerous one, for it proposes to change the order of the tidal volumes upon which the channels, as we find them, <lepend. .All this has bee11 so fairly discussed in the n~ports of the councils an<l commissioners OU Boston arn1 Port.laud that further comment is unnecessarv. Suffice it to say tlmt with the same tidal ·olume- not one in a hundred of the indenfotions np~n our coast is a harbor suitable for our use, and t!Jis consideration alone

should warn us of the delicacy of any experiment which proposes to dh ert great forces like the tides from tlieir natural course with the hope of making them. serve equally well or better in another way. Of course, where it has been ascertained that the tidal volume of a basin is essential to the maintenance of an important channel below, every endeavor should be made to prevent a reduction of this Yolume, and to this end it may be necessary to draw the harbor-line well up on the strand above low water, so that the dredging which will become necessary to conYert this line into a proiler commercial front will add as much tidal volume outside of the line as the occupation of the space within may displace."' On the other hand, rather than exercise a false economy by restricting in any degree the com· mercial progress of a port, it is often the best and wisest policy to draw the harbor-line well out from the shore, and provide fo1· repairing the damage that occupation out to this line may eil'ect by charging ri1larian owners for the space thus granted to them, and reserving this sum to defray expenses in dredging the channel. The State of Massachusetts has adopted this policy in its treat. ment of the upper harbor of Boston, where the occupant of tenitor.y wit[iin the harbor-line is charged for ~very cubic ;yard of tide-water displaced a sum equal to that required for excavating the same amount. The board of harbor commissioners, nevertheless, make the explicit statement that "this compensation-fm1d is accumulated, not because Boston Harbor can be better preserved by dredging-machines than by maintaining the natural scour caused by the tidal reservoirs, whose action is independent of human effort and human supervisions, and costs nothing; it is accumulated to remedy the injury that is necessarily done in adapting a water.front to commercial uses, because this is the best that can be done to preserve the harbor, and at tlie sa_me time use it." Since it never happens, pe1·haps, that all the 8conr inuuced by the filling and draining of a basin i8 exercised to the best advantage as far as our wants are concerned, the cost of repail'ing the inunediate injury done by displacement is hardly likely to exceed the cost of au equal amount of dredging, executed under the most ordinary conditions of depth and character of materials. The objections, however, to making, once for all, an assessment at a fixed rate, irrespective of the value of the territory, are obvious when it is considered that the burden falls unequally, that the repairs cannot be made once for all, and that money changes its value as represented in labor; and this suggests that the State would better collect a rental or tax as they do in providing for the repairs of other highways on shore. There is one type-case to be mentioned where no indirect compensation for encroachment cau avail; it is that of a lagoon, where the channel over a sandy bar, upon the outside coast, depends upon the filling and draining of this reservoir. The several attempts which our Government has made to deepen the channels over the outside bars of lagoon-inlets have been unsuccessful. "As a general rule," said the late Professor Bache, "you may as well attempt to bail ont the sea as to dredge a channel throngh an inlet-bar." Relations subsisting between tlie channels and the tides that traverse them.-The first step to be taken to determine in what rnauner a channel is formed or maintained by the tides is to compare velocities with depths at several cross-sections. Wherever the bed of the stream is alluvial, this comparison discovers to us, usually, that ebb and flood currents take very unequal shares in the work. In the diagram which acoompanies this paper, we have given in a sub-sketch such a comparison as that we have indicated in a characteristic case where the ebb is the principal working agent. Where the bottom is sandy, there is, under ordinary circumstances, no suspension of the materia11 but the grains are rolled a little way by each stream, and the journey eventually made by these grains lies in the direction of and in proportion to the resultant of the forces precisely as if these forces were simultaneous.t
"This precaution has been taken with regard to the Charles River Basfo above Boston, in the mann~r recommended in a report of Prof. H. L. Whiting, Seventh Report MMSachusetts Board of Harbor Commissioners. tThis was first shown to be the case in ()Ur work on New Y()rk Bar. See Annual Report of the Coast Survey for 1859, Appendix 26.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SGRYEY.

In examil1ing a case of this sort1 we should take ohsen'ations every fifteen minutes fol' a tidal clay, at each of three or more ;;tatiom; in the cross-section, a111l work up the ollsen·atious at each station by composition of forces, and then, instead of plotting maximum ebb and maximum flood as in our sketch, we should compare tl1e transverse curve of resultants witll tile 11rofile of section, and expect to find that it only requires a co-efficient to make the two ctir\·es agret~ closely. Scour is a frictional action dependent directly upon velocity and iudependent of tile weight of the superimmmbent water. N1:wertheless, since the Yelocit,y would depend upon the n>lnme passing a given section at different stages of the tide, it will be found that a tidal channel, through alluvia, enlarges its section as it nears the sea, aud this must not be lost sight of iu locatiug lrnrllorlines. If we were to construct an artificial channel leading from a deep ha.sin to the sea, we should proYide for a gradual enlargemeut of the cLannel-sections in the ratio of the tidal volumes at tlle stage of greatest fall-mmally immediately after half-tide. Comparisons like those we have indicated are useful in det.ermiuing the relativP> Yalues of difl:erent reservoirs, and also in ascertaining the probable effect of encroachments upon the width of the main chmmel. If the material prone to enenrnbe.r t,iie channel is sarnl, a \"ery dist.aut. reservoir is ofteu much more useful than one nearer the scene of trouble. A distant reservoir, being filled late and drained late, tends to quicken the .flood-current in the channel below when the latter is nearly full, and the ebb when the channel is quite low. The flood-Yelocity is augmented but little, while the ebb-Yelocity is iucreased very much. Such a resen·oir llerforms a great service, aml should be preserved. Of c-0urse, a reservoir may be so distant as to send it.s waters down the channel after the 1lood-current has commenced to run in at the mouth of the harbor. In this case it would be of no use, or even injurious. Of coun;e, as we have selected for harbors tho;;e iuden. tations of the coast which have good channels, we rarely find in the cases brought before us, natural reservoirs that do not pla;r some useful part in the scour of the cllannels below them. One of the greatest objections to compensation in kind is that by expending money in enlarging reservoirs, rather than by directly deepening the main channels with the dredge, we do not get our money's worth of practical adYantage. 'Ye increase the scour through the whole length of the channel when much of it is deep euough already.
ENCRO.A.CIIMENTS ON THE CII.A.NNELS.

The comparisons made between the transyerse curves of velocity and the profile of tl~e section often disclose the fact tl!at there is a resultant, because the two streams differ in the positions of their maximum velocities, (as in our sketcli.) Sometimes, in such a case, we find that two deep channels lie nearly parallel to each otber with a hank between; in one channel, the resultant takes the direction of ebb; in the other, that of flood. If both streams were crowded into the same path, under snch circumstances, we might have a channel much more shallow tllan either of tbose we had before, l.Jecause the ebh and flood might counteract each other. \Ve h:we often seen inside-bars at our southern inlets very silallow, although traverned by Yiol(111t currents, hec:rnse the outflow and the in.flow were equal and opposite; such a bar is alwa,ys in motion, but only moves to and fro. Practically, we rarely find at a contraction an equality of ebb and flood currreuts, not only because these two drifts prevail at different average heights of the tide, hut also because they are differently converged or gathered in as they 3Jlproach the narrow pass. But just aboYe or below they balance each other, and siloaler water is found. Where the bed and banks of a channel are of mud or other suspcnsil>le material, encroachments upon either side tend to deepen it, aud this brings us to the q Lrnstion, how shall harl}()r-Iines be drawn so as to proYide, as far as possible, against disturoiug the regimen of the streams. Before entering upon this question, we would repeat that we ha ye. selected our harbor from among the ·mauy indentations of the coast, because its channels are the most fiworahle as regards uniformity of good depth. If, then, we would maintain these advantages, we must guard against encroachments that will disturb the order of tbe scouring forces. The most ordinary cause of trouble in our harbors is the irregular encroachments upon the borders of the channel, which

148

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

quicken the stream at one point, and retard it at another, the effects of which are excavations at one point, and shoal-bnil<ling at another. Tlle harbor-line, on either side of a channel, shoulu follow as uearly as practicable the same isod11namic cw·vc, a term which we introduce because it covers two kinds of scouring action, one of which is due to the simple velocity of ebh or floo!l, the other to the resultant of these two. DJodynamic lines.-If the channel-bell awl lJanks :ire composed of soft material, liable to be. stirred up and suspended by any increase of velocity in the stream, our custom has been to draw lines of equal veloeity for flood ancl for ebb, aml in locating the harbor-line.~ make the best compromise possible between these two sets, or give the greater weight to the stream (ebh OT :lloocl) which has the greater velocity. In using the simple velocities we select the m1tximum flow, which occurs about the middle time of ebb or flood currents. If the bed and banks of the channel are sandy, the resultants of the moYements of ebb and flood are to be use<l instea<l of the simple velocities, because sand, as we have before stated, is prone to move in the direction of these resultants. The difficulty in prol'erly drawing these isodynamic lines lies in their Tetluction to the mean. The difl:'erent transverse curves of velocity cannot be simultaneously measured, and the observa. tions are, therefore, affected by the diurual and half-monthl.r changes in the duration and magnitude of tlie tide. To meet this difficulty we proceed as follows: Upon one of the lines crossing the channel at right angles to the flow, make observations enough at different points along the line, and at different depths below the surface, to ascertain the volume passing in either direction, selecting a clay when the tides are about at their average, and correcting by simple proportions. If the basin to be filled, and the channel communicating with it, bad vertical walls, it woulcl be nearly conect to assume that the velocities are in proportiou to the duration and height of the tide; but, as the bauks are sloping irregularly, we can only make this assumption when the observed tide is very ueaT the average. Having carefully determined the mean volume at one cross-section, we asceTtain what it would be for the next by adding or subtracting the ticlal volume for the space between, which tidal volume is simply the aTea multiplied by the rise or fall for the unit of time for which our velocities are stated. Knowing, then, what volume should pass an.v section under average conditions, we correct our transveI"se curve by applying such i1 co-efficient as sllall make the velocities multiplied into the depths give this standard volume. In our sketch the transverse curves given in light, full lines, having been each of them corrected in the nianuer above clesCTibecl, represent the mean velocities in the cross-section under the same average tidal conditions. As we may not have made this matt.er sufficiently plain, we give below an example from one of the curves given in our sketch.

Our first attempt at determining transverse curves of velocity, with the >icw of ascerta.iuiug the proper limits of encroachments, was made in San Francisco in 1870 ; but full applications of our method were first made at New York and Portland in 1872-'73. In the case of Portland we had a hydrogrnphic survey of the channel a11d rese1Toir,* in which the slopes of the shore were given up to the plane of mean high water, so that, with the recorded heights of the tide before us, we could measure the volume drained or tilled for eYery hour, and deduce the mean velocity that should obtain in each section of the channel. This lll'ocess is more accurate than the one illustrated by our numerical example given above, provided tin~ distance or extent of the reservoir is not so great as to im'olrn large variations in the times ot' the tide. But under the most favorable circumstances likely to be met with in nature, the calculations for volume from the best survey of a tidal basin, are laborious and liable to errors. It must be remembered that an error in our standard volume neither affects the courses of our isod,Ynarnic lines nor their relative positions, bt1t simply shifts tl.te whole system a little too far out or in.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

It is impossible to prescribe, in any general way, which of the isodynamic curves the harborline should follow, because this must depend upon the character of the bottom, &c. Snfl:ice it to say that we consider three-tenths of a nautical mile per hour as the minimum limit of scouringvelocity, and in composing the observed velocities to ascertain the resultant we reject all those wllich fall below this limit.
ANCHORAGE SP ACE Al'iD WINDI:N'G R00;\1,

The popular rule for anchorage is, "Run out a scope of chain equal to three times the depth." Accepting this rnle as applicable under ordinary circumstance8, we find the swing-room at ancli.or (making due allowance for the slant of the chain, supposed to be taut) is a circle of which the ratlim; is the length of the vessel added to :.l.8:.l tillles the depth. If we take, as an example, a schooner 100 feet long, anchored in :m feet of water, we make her allowance of swing-room a circle of 185 feet radius, havi11g au area of two and a half acres. In determining the aucltoi·ag·e capacity of a harbor, we plot upon the chart circles of different diameters corresponding to the tliffereut classes of \'essels likely t.o visit tlie port, and mingle tliese in proportion to tlie number of each class, h~wing due regard to draught. \Ve may conveniently divide vessels into four categories: First-clas8 ships, (including ocean-steamers,) 200 to 430 feet long, with 18 to 25 feet draught. Ordinary barks, 130 feet long, ·with 15 feet draught. Ordinary brigs, 103 feet long, with 10 feet draught. Onliuary schooners, 93 feet long, with 10 feet draught. As n·gards numbers of vessels in each of these categories, returns from our principal commercial ports give the ratios 1: 2: li\-: 2rr.* PracticallJ·, vessels, under ordinary circumstances, do not swiug over the whole circle we have iirodded, but simply over opposite quadrants i more.over, they swing together with the same wind or tide. Nevertheless, since vessels cannot be packed into an anchorage as economically as we can plot their circles upon the chart, our rule for measuring the anchorage-capacity of a basin will be found just and convenient. Take, for instance, Vineyard Haven, the most frequented refug·e on our coast. Our rule gives for this port 174 miscellaneous merchant-vessels, (barks, brigs, and schooners, measuring in the average 260 tons.) The port is sometimes so full that many vessels are prevented from entering, and thoi;e at anchor injure each other; yet the largest number ever c01mted was 200, with an average of 200 tons each-a very large proportion being schooners. The area of the auchorage-ground beyond the 18.foot curve is 544- acres; from which we may infer that, in square measure, 2.7 acres is the best average that can serve a coasting-fleet in that roa<lstead. The popular rule we have quoted above is not applicable to very large vessels, which generally require more scope. In ordinary roausteads, of less than tAn fathoms, a man-of-war requires 32 acres of swing-room; and the Spanish frigate Numancia, which lay in the lower bay of New York in the summer of 1872, cruised over a space of 44 acres; altllough, as it proved, her scope of chain was not sufficient to prevent her from dragging a little. \Ve mention this vessel, because she drew more water than was ever before brought over the bar.t In locating harbor-lines we have not only to provide against undue encroachment upon the anchorage-ground, hut to take into consideration the wants of vessels under way, and those hauling in ot out of the slips. If the channel has no abrupt turn in its course, steamers and ,-essels in tow of steam-tugs may be accommodated with a fairway of orte hundred feet, but sailing-vessels require room enough to go about. Vessels vary so much in their maneuvering qualities that no close rule can be laid down for the width of a convenient sailing-channel. A first-class ship requires a half-mile of sea room, and a medium schooner 600 feet, when beating to windward und4.'r ordinary circumstances. To get in or out of a slip a vessel should be allowed three times her length beyond tlte pier· 11eads.

151

The Government, in remoYing 01Jstructio11s in New York Ilarbor, has adopted 2;; feet at mean low water as the maximum depth required, and in Bm;ton 23 feet. The former g·irns 2; feet from the mean level of the seu, the latter 28 feet. Of the sailing-ships registered at Lloyds, only one-third draw OYer 20 feet, while 9.'J per cent. draw over 10 feet. Of the barks only a per cent. draw over 20 feet, and 27 per ceut. oYer 1G feet. Of the brigs onl.r 3 per cent. draw over 1G feet. Coastwise coal-loaded steamers usually draw 15 feet, and coal-loaded schooners 12 feet; the average draught of merchant-schooners is, howeve1·, only 10 feet, and fishing-vessels less. The contours of the natural frontage, where the bed and bank of the stream are of ~-ielding material, will nsually be found parallel to the isodynamic lines commented upon ahon·, but uot necessaril,y so to the dircctiun of the current.

In the foregoing table no projections beyond the hulls of the vessels am eountetl. In order to furnish fair berths for two ships, the water-space between wharves sl10uld be about 100 feet wide, 250 foet long, and 20 feet deep as far up the slip as the 8hips' keels extend. These dimensions cO\·er all nooessary projections of bead-gear, &c.; they also admit of the two ships being replaced b~· fonr ordinary schooners, leav~ng ample space for passage-way between those on opposite sides. Although the water-fronts in most of our ports are now occnpi<'d only by whanes, them are places where continuous quays would be much more economical, and other pl<lces where docks with open gateways would be safer and more convenient. In great estuarirs, like Delaware Bay, where the alluvia along shore is liable to shift, and is prone to do so immediate];\- after the erection of projections at right angles to the flow, a continuous qna;y, protected b;y ice-break.en;, i:-; the best and most permanently useful improvement of the water-front. Onr harbor-lines mmally indicate simply the outer limits of pile or crib piers extending from tbe sllore. Riparian rights"-Under the general tlrincipal that each shore-oirner has a right of !l'ay out to sea from every part of his frontage, it would seem just that when he chooses to extend bis wharf to the harbor-line be should be entitled to his proportional share of said line. Where the harbor-line is parallel to the shore, his proportion is secured by extending the sifl.e-lines of his lot in directions normal to said harbor-line; but in the case where his estate lies upon the shores of a shallow con, within which it is inexpedient to draw a harbor-line parallel to the shore, a special method of division must be resorted t-0, in order to secure to each riparian owner llis due proportion of the harbor-line adopted.

152

IrnPOR.T OF THR SUPERINTENDENT OF

Before referring to the methods of division he.retofore adopted or proposed, we shall offer a rule, which seems to us of Yery general application. Ifa...-ing plotted the harbor-liue, which may either pass wholly outside of the month of ihe co'>e or bend into it, draw a 8weepiug-line through three or more salient points in the high-water rnargiu of the co\·e in such manner as to present townnls the liarbor a divergent curve, and extend the side lines of the riparian estates out to this line of rectification in directions normal to said line. Then (premising that the lmrbur-liue has been parceled out to the owners above aml below the cove) clivide the unallotted portion of the line in front of the coYe into parts proportional to the diYisions of tlw line of rectification already referred to, and extend the est~ttes hy straight lines to em brace these parts. One ma;\' easily SC(' tllat if the harbor-line is drawn with no reference to the form of the co,,e, cases ma;y arise where an aprlicatiou of this rule wonld be iueqnitable; but since the main purpose of the harbor-line is mmally to secure to each his due share of tlie frontage, no such difficulty may be expected to arise. "\Yhere a harbor-improvement, beneficial to tlie many and detrimental to the few, is contemplated, the location of the lrnrhor-line may be made regardless of the interest of some individuals 1 but in such cases the injured should be made whole from the " betterments " elsewhere. Tile rule ..-e have giyeu is based upon certain decisions of the conrt in l\lassachusetts, and its slight departure from tlle actual usage will be appreciated by the followiug very interesting discussion, which we quote from Allen's Report of Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, volume XIX. The court appointed commissioners to tlivide the flats of a coYe in Gloucester, and this commission seemed to ha,-e assumed that this dfrision was to be in proportional areas.

"No rule, to our knowledge, lrnving heen estalilishcd for tlrn division of flats in a cove of this description, out of the tide never entirely Phhs, nor any rule of dh·ision in any case alloptc<l which is capable of a general application to shores of diffe1·cnt 8hapes, it was suggested to us that the mode her!'toforo adopted fa some cases, claimed to ]H, analogon~ to the 11rescnt, of deep coves, out of which the tide entirely ebbs, to wit, hy drawing a line across the month of tlin f\ove between the headlands, and gh·ing to each shore-owner Lis prnportiouate leugtl1 of flats on that line, sl1on1<1 he followed i11 this. Bnt we were of opinion that this mode was not properly to be applied to this case, or to caHc~ of ,,o,·es from which the tidP <1oeR not wlrnlly ebb at the lowest tide, inasmuch as t11e lmse-line upon which the division would be rnade must pass outside of tlw limits of the ownership of Urn parties, anrl where no actual nteasnremeutR or monuments eonld he had. " " "Aud we ha Ye adopted the followiug mode r)f division as one fair aud proper in this case, to wit, we fix the houudaries by !livision-lines drnwn througl1 a seriee of points or lines between the established limits of the cove, equillistan t from the line of high water, which points are found by diYiding S<tid equidistaut lines in the ratio as the lengths of the Jines of upland own(l(l by the parties on saill high-water line, giving to each shore-owner 11is proportiouat-e share of the area of each belt of flats thns formc<l around the cove, until tl.Je limit of his ownership in the direction of low water is reached, the said belts as represented upon tl1e plan being tm1 feet in width; the division-Ji nos so asccrtained being rcpreseutcil upon the plan by the irregular an<l curved lines from the hound mark.~ on high-wg,ter line to low-water line," (and marked, on the plan, ante, 7!1, a 1, h 1, c 1.) "It was objected to this mode that it gives division-lines of boundary curved aud irregnlar, and not adapted to the construction of wharnis upon the premises. "Ut;t' we have couHidered that the use for constrnction of whan'es is not the sole purpose for which the premises are valuable, uor the purpose for which snch property is alway" of the mo:;t value, aud that by law the right of occupation of flats atljoiuing the npl:tlHl is not co-extensive with the ownership, since it cannot stop or hinder the passage of boats or ves8el,; to other men's hou·es or lands; aud further, that the conro;es of these lines will not be more irregular than the shore-lines npou which they depend, uor than the line of low water, nor than natural lines of boumlary geuerally ; and that tllcy mark a division fair and proper in the premises, which gives to each owner bis <luc proportion; and that the rule by which they are run is capable of a general application to coves of all shapes, and to headlands and shores of the 011eu sea as well, giving to the shore-owners in all cases their proportionate shares of the area of the adjoining flats, marked by boundary-lines in ti.Jc dircctiou of low water upon the courses indicated by nature in the forrnation of the shore. 11'* * * ii ~ 1. * .,. * "The petitioners objected to .indgnwnt upon the report of the commissioners for the following reasons: 1st. That the divi 8 ion reported by the comrnissi~ners is not the true an·l legal method for dividing the flats in said cove and determining the boundary-lines of said petitioners. 2d.

LAWS ESTABLISHING HARBOR-LINES.

The legislative act establishing a llarbor-line usuall,y takes the form of a prohibition, tlm:,;: "No wharf, pier, or otlier structure in the harbor of - - - shall ever hereafter be extended into and over the tide-water of said lrnrbor, beyond the line hereinafter de8cribPtl."* In nearl.v all cases that have come before us for reYision, there ba\'e been found serious faults in the description of the lines, especiall~· as regards the deflecting-points whose exact position8 are not carefully fixed, as they should be, by stated courses and distances from known and permanent objects. What we mean by known and permanent objects may be seen in the following quotation from a description of proposed harbor.Jines recently drawn up l.J.'· the Coast Surn·y at the request of the harbor commission of ~ew Castle, Del.: "The quay-line, beginning at a point in the center_ line of North street extended 790 feet seaward from the initial stone at the intersection of the centerlines of Market and North streets, runs southwesterly in a straight line to a point in the center-line of Uhestnnt street extended 882 feet from the initial stone at the intersectiou of the center.lines of Chestnut and Market streets; thence south westerly in a straight line to the east corner of the rectangular icepier off Truss's wharf; thence along the outer face of said pier to tlie south corner of the same; thence southwesterly in a straight line to a point in the extended line of the west side of the old icepfor (forming now a part of Holmes's wharf) 57;! feet from the south corner of said pier; thence westerly in a straight line to a point in the center-line of Delaware street extended 464 feet from the initial sfone at the intersection of the center·lines of Delaware and Front streets ; thence in a straight line to a point in the center.line of South street. extended t,oo~ feet from the initial stone at the intersection of the center-lines of Pearl and South streets ; thence westerly in a straight line to a point in the center-line of J ohuson street extended 846 feet from the init'ial stone at the intersection of the center.lines of ,Johnson and South streets." The above is, perhaps, as simple a case as could well be found, but the description might be improved by stating the true course of each line. It is customar,y to refer to ligllt-houses, churches, and other public buildings, and to corners of street-blocks where no initial stones exist. It has also been customary to refer to corners of wharves, but this is not advisable unless the wharves are of stone already extending to the line. Harbor·liues when fixed by the legislature are intended to be permanent, but the same authority can change them, and few old cases that have come to our knowledge have escaped some change. Therefore, when a scheme of Jines is presented to the legislature, it should be accom· panied by a detailed report setting forth the reasons for the location of each section, in order that, if at any future time the exigencies of commerce may seem to demand some changes, all the original augments may be duly considered. Most of' the old harbor-lines rest only upon tile authority of the names of the experts who made up the commissions recommending them. In our own experience we have never made up a scheme of lines in which the different sections were equally well based, and in some cases we have felt obliged to state that this section or that was entirely arbitrary, and simply introduced as a connecting-link in the chain. · The foregoing is, as far as we know, the first attempt at a general essay upon harbor-lines, and this must be our apology for its faults.

APPENDIX No. 11.
COMPARISON OF THE METHODS OF DETE!{)IINING HEIGHTS BY MJ.;ANS Ol' LEVELING, VERTICAL ANGLES AND BARO:\IETRIC :\rnASUHES, FROM OBSERVATIONS AT BODEGA HEAD AND ROSS MOUNTAIN, CAL., BY GEORGE DAVIDSON AND CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANTS, UNITED STATES COAST SCRVEY.

In the spring of 1860, Assistant George Davidson organized a ssstem of observations of heights with a \'iew of determining the refraction of the atmosphere ht the climate of California, and to give data for relative values of heights determined from levelin~ operations, from measures of zenith-distances, and from readings of the atmospheric pressure. The stations selected were Bodega Head, on the sea-coast, about fifty statute-miles northwesterly of Sau Francisco, and Ross Mountain, about fourteen miles to the northward of Bodega Head. The "head" i::; about 240 feet and the "mountain" about 2210 feet above the level of the ocean. Starting from Bodega Head, the line passes for about one-third of its length close to the coast-line, and at two-thirds it crosses the deep valley of the Russian l{iver. Local currents of the atmosphere, due to this valley, ma:y possibly cause disturbances in the normal refraction. The two stations were occupied iu l\1arcb, 1860, and between tlie 20th and 27th hourly observations (from 7 a. m. to 5 p. m.) were made of reciprocal and simultaneous zenith-distances, and of the pressure, temperature, and moisture of the atmosphere. The height of Bodega Head was determined by leveli.ug in August, 1860, but it was 11ot till 1872 that an opportunity offered for carr;yiug the levels up to Ross Mountain. The results of this paper will be given under the three divisions of the subject stated in the title.
1.-THE RESUI.TS OF THE LEVELING OPERATIONS.

These operations being well understood, and presenting nothing new or of special interest, the following brief statement will suffice: The elevation of Bodega Head was determined by spirit.level, by Assistant George Davidson, August 20, 1860. The staff could be read by means of a vernier to 0.001 of a foot. He foundBodega Head mark above bench-mark near tidal station . _. . . . 234.6 feet.

R. Throgmorton, aid, United States Coast Survey, assisted by Mr. H.J. Willey. The lm·elings commenced at Bodega Head, and re.ceived a rough check by striking high-water mark at Salmon Creek; from here the line of le·el crosses a ridge of about 250 feet, and descends again at the Russian River to tide-water level; the ascent of Ross Mountain was retarded by wet and windy weather, and in returning the work had to be abandoned after descending about 1,350 feet, on account of the wet and spongy ground. The check.levels during the descent were satisfact-0ry. The leveling-instrument, by Stackpole & Bro., of New York, was borrowed from General Alexander, United States Engineers. The rod was compared with the standard steel-yard, at 620 Fahrenheit, and the extreme length and intermediate graduation were found to agree with the standard.

2.-RESUL'.l'S OF HOFRL Y OllSERVA.'l'IONS OF RECIPROCAL A.ND SDIUL'.l'A.NEOUS ZENITH-DISTANCES FOR DIFFEiiENCE OF HEIGHT OF THE '.l'WO STA'l'ION"5.

'l'he obsen·atious at Botlega Head, between March 20 and l\Iarch 2i, 1860, were made h,v I~. H. Fauntleroy, aid, United States Coast Surny. He used the 10-inch Yertical circle Xo. 80; it is graduated to 5', and rea<ls by 4 verniers to 3" each. Its optical power W;ts ratller wt>ak fol' tile work required. One di\·ision of the le,·el equals ii".ii3, as determined. by Assistant Da\·iusou iu 1859. The axis of tlle vertical circle was 6!!.5 iuehes (l.ii8i metre;,;) aboYe ground, allll the elt Yatiou of the heliotrope .shown to Hoss Mountain was the same. The zenith-distauces of the H.oss Mountain heliotrope were measured on five days at e\-ery full hour, (excepting one on the first day,) between 7 a. m. and 5 p. m. inclusive. Each meastue consists of six repetitions of the double zenith-distance, and was corrected for defect of verticality of axis as imlicated by the le\'CI. Immediately before and after each measure the barometer, with atta.ched t,hermometer, and the dry and wet bulb thermometers, were read, arnl the state of the weatller note(l generally, including direction and velocity of wind. The cistern of the mercurial barometer, Greeu No. 13!3, was 0.336 metre above ground. Its imlPx-correctio11, when eomp-arecl with Green's mercurial barometer No. 1347, which was stated to he corred, was -0.010 inch, whir,h eorrnction was applied to the tabular results, as well as the graduation-corrections of the tlrnrmometers, No. lG, used as dry and wet bulb, and of No. 3, nsed as dry bulb, after the accidental breakage of wet bulb No. 16. These corrections are given further on. The observations at Itmss Mountain, between )farch 20 and Marcl1 27, 18GO, were mitde h.r Assistant George Davidson. He used the 10-iuch Gambey vertical circle No. 28; it is graduate1l to 5', and reatls by 4 \'erniers to 3" each. Its optical power was consitleretl weak. One division of the level equals 6".29, as determined by Assistant Davidson. The axis of the vertical circle was 61 inches ( 1.5-!B metre) abo,·e the ground; the heliotrope shown to Boi.lega Head was on a level with the vertical circle. Double zenith-distances of the Bodega Ilead heliotrope were measure<! 110urly, between 7 a. m. and 5 p. m. inclusive, on five days, aud at four morning-hours on the Gth day, when t~he observations lmd to be discontinued on account of wet atHl stormy weather. The measurement of the six repetitions of the double zenith-distance wa8 commenced exactly at the full hour, and the average time occnpiml in making them was about tlve minutes. The level was rea<l twice before and twice after reversal of the circle, and the resitlts were corrected for defect, in verticality of axis. The barometer and attached thel'mometer and the dry and wet bulb t.hermometers were observed as at Bodega Head ; the st<tte of the weather was carefully noted ever_y hour. The cistern of mercurial barometer, Green Xo. 1347, which was borrowed from Lient. R S. Williamson, United States Topographical Engineers, was 0.378 metre abo\'e grountl. 'l'he instrument b:1 of the Smithsonian pattern. The tllermometers were, No. 8, dry bulb, No. 13, wet bulb, and the comparisons by l\'lcAllister & Rros. with a staudanl, and again by AssistantDavidsou, garn tbe followiugindex-correctious to the thermometers used at the two stations:

The observations on the :!7th are omitted from the mean. The daily ma.xima are indicated by brackets. It will be noticed that these maxima of measured zenith-distlinccs all occur in the forenoon, and that they appear to connect themseh·es with the time of the daily maxima of the atmospherfo pressure, (for which see tables further on.) The average hour i8 near 10 a. m. Thi8 may possibly be quite local, and may be connected with the setting in of the sea-breeze about that time-a phenomenon which renders the daily fluctuation of temperature at San Francisco so different from the ordinary occurrence. The Bodega Head station seems to be slightly more exposed to this infiuence, as might be conjectured from its position close to the sea-coast.
*To complete the table, the value 15".5 was liere interpolated; it was found by comparing the observed zenith distance at 7 a. m. on each day witli the mean of tbe 10 observed zenith-distances of the day respectively. This difference is 1 10 '.7, which, subtracted from 26".2, or the mean of the 10 observations on the 20th, givea 1511.5. tMeaeures unreliable owing to high wind; the mean, or 3:J".6, will hereafter be 1mlJ11tituted in tbe place of these measnrPs.

The probable error of a11y 011e mean zenith-distance from five days of observation is ahnnt :!: 1".9. The heliotrope aml instrument being om.038 higlier a hove ground at Bodega Head than at Ross Mountain, the angle 0".3 subtended by this difference will be sul1tractive to the resulting tabular zenith-distances at Bodega Head and additive to those at Ross :Wo11ntaiu, in order that the computed differences of altitude may at once refer to the gTou1Hl at each station.

These results are shown graphically on the accompanying diagram, which also girns a representation of the observed pressure and temperature of the air at the two stations. It will be seen that the accord with the result from the leveling-operation is quite close, the difference only amounting to om.21; but if we compare the results derived from the two statious separately, we have a difference of 1m.ss, which reduces to 1m.3u if we confine onrsel,·es to the hours between 9 and 4, botll inclush'e, This would indicate that the adopted constant of refrac· tion requires a small change to suit the particular circumstances. The obserrntions at Bodega Head give too much difference of height, and the observations at Ross Mountain too little difference of height. In either caoe, the constant employed makes the ray of light pass above the true height, which indicates that the adopted radii of curvature of the ray are too great, or tlmt the assumed refraction is too sma1l. If we increase a0 or v by one-ninth of its Yaluc, we find results which, in their mean values, are almost identical, viz, from observations at Bodega Reau, 598"'.69; from Ross Mountain, 59gm,35; mean, 59gm,52; anu after omitting results for the hours 7 and 8 a. m. and 5 p. m., when the atmosphere is too much agitated by currents, from observations at Bodega Read, 593m,40; from Ross Mountain, 5!)8m.58; mean, 5!)8m.49.

The values for the total refraction, r, show the ordinary diurnal variation, the refraction being least soon after 10 a. m., as exhibited in the second figure of the accompanying diagram, where, however, the value of ~ r is represented. These results from the observeu refractions present the anomaly of the refraction at the upper station being greater than the simultaneous refraction at the lower station, except at the afternoon-hours 1, 4, and 5, when the reverse takes place. Owing to this fact, we do not think it advisable to make any change in the value of a0 · The angle of refraction for any particular state of the atmosphere with respect to pressure and temperature may be found from the following expressions given by Bauernfeind:

.Applying these formulae, the angles of refraction at the lower station should be greater by 1".1 than the corresponding angles at the upper station. The cause of the apparent anomaly of au observed greater refraction at the upper than at the lower station may be due to difference of station-errors or of that part of the deviation of the plumllline which is effective in the vertical planes passing through the two stations. This cause ·would be a constant one. Or it may be due to a difference in the law of decrease of temperature with increase of hcigllt. Thus, the more rapid the decrease of temperature, the smaller the refract10n, and,· on the contrary, the slower the decrease of temperature, the greater the refraction. With a sufficiently rapid decrease of temperature the refraction may become zero, (and e\en be negative;) with no decrease, or for a constant temperature, the refraction is Yery large, and will yet increase should tbe temperature increase (\Yith the height) instead of decrease. \Yinds at different altitudes, the currents haviug different temperature, sufficiently explain such occurrences. Sma.11 defects in the absolute value of the atmospheric temperature are of little consequence with regard to measures of height; thus an increase or decrease of rn::i J"ahrenheit would only prod nee an increase or decrease of om.14 in the difference of height of BodC'ga Head and Hoss :.'\fountaiu. In using the ordinary simple expressions for difference of height, taking the ray of light to lie part of an arc of a circle, or the refractions equal at the two stations, which answer "·ell enough for short distances and small heights, a knowledge of the so-calletl co-efficient of refraction (k) may often be desirable; it is nearly~ rature of the atmosphere by2k

3.-HESULTS OF IIOURL Y ODSERVATIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE FOR DIFFERE~CE OF HEIGHTS OF TIIE STATIONS.

In the present state of barometric hypsometry it is most desirable to make and discuss barometric observations specially undertaken with a view of contributing information respecting the daily and the annual Yariation in deduced heights. It is only by means of such observations, made in difforent climates and under different circumstances, that we can secure the foundation for corrections to be applied to computed~differcnces of height!' measured barometrically at any hour of the day and any season of the year. Uamond, about 1810, appears to barn been the first to notice tlie relation between llarometrically-deduced heights and the time of the day when these measures were taken. The annual variation was also indicated by his results. Kreil proprn;ecl the use of annual means of pressure and temperature to secure reliable results, especially for the case when the two stations lie horizontally a great distance apart. Among those who l1aye more recently occupied themselves with this subject may be mentioned Professor Plantamour, Dr. Bauernfeind, Dr. Riihlmann, and l\Iajor -n·miamson, U. S. A. Plantamour's Tables of Corrections baYe been reproduced in thfl Meteorological and Physical Tables, published by the Smithsonian Institution, (third edition, 1859.) Further information will be found in Ri.ihlmann's small but valuable work: "The Barometric Measurements of Heights and their Relation to the Constitution of the .Atmosphere," Leipzig, 1870.* Among the conclusions reached are the following: Differences of heights, barometrically determined, appear to attain their maximum value shortly before the time of greatest heat of the day; they decrease rapidly during the afternoon, and slowly during the night, reaching their minimum about one or two hours before sunrise. From the least to the greatest yaJue the rise is rapid. This dail.r variation in the computed heights appears fully dm·eloped only for those days on which the insolation of the ground is complete under a clear sky, and the loss of heat during the night by radiation is not interrupted. On cloudy or windy days the amplitude of the variation is much dimin. ished,. without, however, totally disappearing. The magnitude of the daily yariation, llesides being dependent on the season of the year, is affected b.r local circumstances, connected with the capacity of the ground for absorption and radiation of 11eat. Resulting heights, determined from daily or monthly means, also show an annual period; they are found too small in winter and too great in summer. The amplitude of the annual variation is less than that of the daily Yariation. Heights determined from annual means generally give results differing little from the truth. · Observations are recommended to be made at the following houn;, when the daily and annual Yariations are supposed- to pass through zero-Yalue: In January, at 1-p. m. In February, at 10 a. m.-and 4 p. m. In March, at 8 a. m. and 6 p. m. In .Apt'il, at 7i a. m and 7 p. m. In May, at 7 a. and 7 p. m. In~June, at 6:} a. m. and 9~ p. m.

ive mean temperature introduced by the supposition that the mean of the observed temperatures at the two stations equals that of the intervening stratum of air. The daily variation of tern perature, under a clear sky, is less the higher we rise above the surface, and is very small in the higher strata. The thermomet~rs, which cannot be elevated sufficiently to place them abo"·e the influence of the radiation and conduction of the soil, can, therefore, give but very defectirn information respecting the temperature of the ele,·ated strata of air, except in the citse of an oYercast sky. The problem of barometric measures has, therefore, been inverted, and the mean temperature of the air bas been computed from the observed pressures, and the difference of altitudes otherwise known. or determined. This process leads to a system of corrections to the observed temperatures to be applied in the computation of ordinary hypsometric measures by means of the barometer. It matters comparatively little which of the generally-recognized barometric formulae is used; or the case in hand we select from the class of formulae which introduce a distinct term for observed humidity, that given by Dr. Riihlmaun, for which see his work on Barometric :Measurements of Heights, (Leipzig, 1870,) or Astronomical Tables aml Formulae, by Dr.C. F. ,Y. Peters, (Hamburg, 1871.) Plantamou.r's and Bauernfeind's formulae give almost identical results, which, in the present case, are about three-fourths of a metre in excess; on the other hand, Laplace's, Baily's, and Loomis' formulae, all based upon an average degree of humidity, gh·e results about one and one-half metre in defect of the result by Riihlmann's formula. The effect ou the calculated height of the term, mvolving the hygrometric state of the air, is comparatively small; in the present case the result for complete saturation being 2m. 7 greater than the results supposing absolute dryness. Leth = difference in height, expressed in metres ; b', b" =atmospheric pressure at the lower and upper stations, both readings reduced to refer the temperature of the mercury to that of freezing water; in the term involving the vapor pressure b' and b" should be expressed in millimetres; t', t" = atmospheric temperature, expressed in centigrade scale, at the lower au cl upper stations ; 1 11 <1 , r; =the vapor-pressure, expressed in millimetres, at the lower and upper stations; z =height of lower station above the sea-le>el; and 'f = mean latitude of the stations : then-

Supposing an error in the reading of the barometers of 0.004 inch, or O.l millimetre nearly, to have been committed at each of the stations, (but of opposite signs,) we find dh = 2.3 metres; hence, in the mean value from five days of observations we may expect a remaining uncertainty of nearly one metre. Supposing an error in the reading of the thermometer of i-° Fahrenheit, nearly0°.2 centigrade, we have dh = 0.4 metre, showing that the uncertainty in any one of the above hourly results arising from imperfect readings of instruments may be taken as 6 !-LJ of the height nearly. The computed difforences of height for each hour are shown in the accompanying diagram, to which has been added the resulting vapor-pressure at the two stations, as computed from Major Williamson's table.* The deduced vapor-pressures, as well as the observed temperaLures at the two stations, are strictly local results, and give no trtie indication of the humidity and temperature of the intervening stratum of air.

The numbers in the last column are interpolations from Piantamour's Table XI, p. D. 82, of third edition of the Smithsonian Meteorological aml Physical Tables; they refer to March 24, and were converted into degrees of Fahrenheit. We thus arrive at the remarkable result that the temperature of the intervening stratum of air is nearly constant, viz, 46°.2, and shows apparently no trace of a daily variation, the rays of the sun passing through without sensibly heating it. The daily variation of temperature, therefore, would seem to be confined mainly to the layer of air in contact and close proximity to the earth's surface. The corrections derived from Plantamour's table (deduced from observations at Geneva and the great Sltint Bernard) are smaller than those deduced from our observations, but the latter refer to a clear sky, (the heliotropes having been seen every honr.) To make Plantamour's corrections answer for our case, they require to be increaseu by two thirds of their amount; for tlrn case of an o,·ercast sky they must be diminished possibly by one-half or more. The one-third of the total Rolar radiation, which may be absorbed by the atmosphere, is probably consumed by the processes of expansion and evaporation, and thus gives no sensible heat. In the present case, however, the daily variation of temperature is very small, owing to the proximity of the ocean, and different and apparently less anomalous results may be expected for stations farther removed from the coast. To estimate the effect of a small error in the observed pressure on the deduced mean temperature, and supposing, as before, db"= - db', we have fromthe relation d T Fahrenheit, which shows the extreme sensitiveness of the operation. If the harometric observations alone had been available, the safest result that might haye been deduced from them would have been that interpolated for the epoch 7~ a. m., which is 600m.5, and 1m.s in excess of the . true value.

HEIGHTS .ABOVE MEAN TIDE DETEHl\HNED BY THE SPIRIT-LEVEL. The leveling was executed in 1870 by Charles .Ferguson, esq., Sub-assistant, Unite<l States Coast Survey. The line started from mean· tide at Ke~·port, on Raritan Bay, and, following the route most convenient for determining the height of the primary stations, ended at mean tide of the Delaware Rfrer at Gloucester City. The route pursued was not, therefore, the most direct,; the one preferred being that on which the longest extent of turnpike and railroad-track cotild be made aYailable. Tue length of the main line was sm·enty-seven miles, and of the of:faet;;, thirteen miles; the total distance leveled and releveled, one section after the other, being one lmndred and eighty miles. The observations are contained in ten volumes. These latter will show the <lilferent sections into which tlle main line was divided; the offsets to the triangulation-stations Beacon Hill, Disborongh, Stony Hill, and Mount Holl;y; also, the offsets to the barometer-stations; and, finall;1-, the height above mean tide of the bench-marks established at the villages throug·h which the line
pai>sed ·

.An additional line of levels was run in 1871 by Mr. B. A. Colonna, aid United States Coast Survey, to connect the triangulation and barometer station Pine Hill with the bencll-mark at Gloucester City.
1'IDAL STATIONS .

.A tide-staff was set up at Keyport and another at Gloucester City, and the tides were obsen'ed at each station during a half-lunation for the purpose of determining the level of mean tide. This level, or t,he computed balf-tide mark on the staff, was then transferred to a permanent bench-mark established in the vicinity of each tide-gauge; these two bench-marks being the termini of the liue of levels.
INS'.l'RUM:EN'l'S.

The instrument used was rt pivot-level made by \Vi.irdemann. The telescope possessed a magnif.yiug·power of 30, was proYided with a reticule of three fixed horizontal wires about 41 apa1t, and of two vertical wires, and with a ridiug-level, a di\'ision of whicli represented 3" in arc at tbe average temperature at which the instrument would be used in the field. The leveling-rod was made of seasoned Honduras mahogany and painted white; was 3m.2 in length by om.06 in width aud om.04 in thickness; and was PJ'O\'irlecl with a WOO<len handle attached to the back part, about 5.6 feet above the bottom, and by means of which the rod could be carried and held in position, and, with two small levels, fixed at right angles, to secure its verticality. To prevent displacement, or change of level, when the ro<l was tm·1w<l round for the back :;ight, the foot of the rod, incased in brass, terminated in a cylindt"ical button, fitted to and modug freely in the socket of the iron foot-plate on which it rested. This plate, six inches in diameter, was armed underneath witb sharp pointed legs, so that when it was dropµell by the rod-mau on reaching his station, it could be firml~· planted in the ground by a stamp or two of the foot. A li~ht chain, with u. ring 88 I\ handle, waR attncherl to the plate, by whfoh the latter coul<l he readily taken np

Tlte mus \Yere didded to centimeters, the divisions aud comparisons haying been made at the Coast Snr\·ey Office in \Yashiugton.
:FIELD OBSERVA'.rIONS AND RECORDS.

TLe first operatio11 consisted in (letermi11ing the Yalues of the instrumental constants, viz: 1. Of a diYisiou of the lewl; 2. Of tbc angular distance between the horizontal wires; and 3. Of the reduction of the mean of the three wires to the middle wire. By means of these constants, tables were made out, which gaYe, by inspection, A. The distanee of the instrument to the rod; B. The correction to reduce tlie mean of the three wires to the middle wire; 0. The correction on account of the want of level at the momeut of observation, aud of the daily recorded instrumental errors; and D. The correction for difference of distance between the back and fore sights. Tl!e order in which th<> observations were made aml recorded, and the directions followed in conducting the operation, ma,y be stated as follows: L An adjustment of the instrument, eit,her complete or closely approximate, with all the details duly entered in the record. This adjustment was made at the commencement and end of each day's work, and consisteda. In making the axis of the level parallel with the optical axis of the telescope; b. In making the axis of the level perpendicular to the vertical axis of the instrument; and c. In bringing the middle horizontal wire and tl!e midule of the two vertical wires in the optical axis of the telescope. vYhen this adjustment was approximate only, Tables E and C enabled the computer to apply the necessary corrections to the results of the day's lei;·eling. II. The placing of the instrument midway, and, if possible, in line between the two rods. In cases where the distance between the back and fore sights was necessarily or by accident unequal, as shown by the recorded differences between the extreme wires, Table D supplied the correction to be applied. on account of the resulting inequality of curvature and refraction. III. The protection of the instrument from the direct rays of the sun by a cap when carried and au umbrella when in use. IV. The adjustment for verticality of axis; of the foens for distinct vision; of the bubble to the middle of the tu be and the recording of the divisions as shown by the eye and object ends; the reading of the heights on the rod crossed by the three wires, and the second reading and recording of the le\'el-bubble. Table U supplied the correction for the difference between the readings of the two endR of ti.le lmbble. V. Bench-mark8 were established at the end of each day's work, at the different villages through which the line was canied, and whenever from an~T cause the leveling was suspended. The details of the work were carried out in conformity with the order and principles contained in instructions specially prepared for the instrument used and the object in view, under the four following headings: 1. Tide-gauge, records, and tidal-station or bench-mark. 2. Adjustment of the instrument. 3. Formnlro, constants, and corrections. 4. General tlirections for running a line of levels. The releveling was require<l, not merely for the sake of verificatiou, hut for precision, as it is a well-established fact that there will be always a differeuce, irrespeetive of instrumental and personal errors, betweeu the results obtained by the leYPling of a line in one direction, and then hack ngnin to the starting-point.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 13.
REPORT OP OBSERVATIONS OF THE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF DECEMBER 22, 1870, BY GEORGE W. DEA::\', ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

FALL RIVER, MASS., ]lfarch 20, 1871.

SIR: A.bout tbe list of September last I was informe(l b.Y Professor Peirce, Superintemlent of the United States Coast Survey, that my services would be required in making arrangements fur obserdng tlrn total eclipse, in Spain, in December. The special observations assigned to me were those of precision, and, so far as practicable, the determination of the geographical po::;ition from principal eclipse-stations in Spain. As the expedition was to be under your general directions, I improved an early opportunity of conferring with you in regard to its organization and plans of operation. Our information relating to the meteorological conditions of the winter-climate of Southern Spaiu being quite limited, it was deemed advisable that I should, a.t an early date, proceed to Englam.1, and them obtain such information on tbis subject as might be practicable, and which would prove of great sen·ice in selecting the most favorable localities for observing the different phases of the ecli1rne. During· my stay in England, from the 1st until the 19th of No,-ember, I obtained much information in regard to the climate of Southem Spain from the astronomer-royal at Greenwich, Louis P. Cassella, esq., and several other scientific gentlemen in I,ondon, to all of whom I was indebted for mau,v courteous attentions. This iuformation seemed to indicate that the probabilities for fair weather in Southern Spain were more promising near the Atlantic coast than upon tile shores of the Mediterranean, from the fact that most of the storms in tbat section came from the soutb and east. Information on this point was sought from the commanders and chief officers of the steamers plying betweeu Sonthamptou and ports in the Mediterranean, and also from gentlemen who, for many years, had resided at Gibraltar, all of whom confirmed tbe information previously obtained, and which I am gratified to state was also the opinion of Capt. Cecilio Pujazon, director of the obser..-atory at San Fernando, and Capt. Jose S. Montop, chief of the Spanish Coast Survey, whom we bad the pleasure of meeting at San Fernando early in December. As the center of the pa.th of the tota.l phase "Would fall near the city of Jerez, which is located about twent.y miles nertheasterly from Cadiz and ten or fifteen miles from the sea-coast, that point appeared to he one of the most favorable in Spain for observing the eclipse, and accordingly yon gave directions that all the instruments and equipments of our expedition should be forwarded from Cadiz to .Jerez. The principal eclipse-station was located about a mile northeasterly from the city, in an oli.vegrove belonging to Messrs. Davies, who placed their grounds and buildings at the disposal of our party without compensation, and rendered most valuable assistance to all the members of the expedition during our sojourn at Jerez. The requisite lumber for constructing the small observatory, photographic room, &c., could not at once be obtained, and it was found necessary to have all our boards and scantlings cut from three-inch planks by manual labor. This, with much stormy weather, greatly retarded our preliminary preparations; nevertheless, the work wa8 pressed forward as rapidly as possihle, and, at the urgent solicitation of Mr. Willard, the photographic room, and other preparations required by th~ photographic department, were first completed.

It may be remarked that the instrmuents nsed iu aseertaiuiug t lw local time w1·re a 4(j.jucll transit, with an aperture of 2~ inches, (CT. S. Coast ~urny Xo. 5.) a cl11·01H>gl'apl1-rPgister.

A few minutes preceding the total phase, the force of the wind increased a little and lJlew in gusts, followed by brief lnlls, which at once reminded me that I had before seen a similar phenom· enon during the total eclipse whidt I had the pleasure of obRerving in Kentnck;\· on the 7th of August, 1869. Several large glass lanterns had ueen specially pruYilleu for use by the photographers and myself during the totality; but ::\fr. YYillard i1referretl coal-oil lamps, wb ic11 1ver.Y nnfortuuatel_y, were not sufficiently protected from the wind, and all his lights were quickly blown ont, wlien a messenger was dispatched for my lantern, wliich I promptly sent to l\ir. \'i~illard. "~bile I was engagc<l in procuring another light for th<' purpose of in~pcctiug the chronographic record, the cmersion occurred; and, to my great disappointment, I failed to obserYe the second inner contact, or the ending of the total phase. From this time until the close of the eclipse tlw suu was seldom . visible, on account of den~e cnmnl118 aml 11imh1rn clont1,., ·which Jll"en~ntetl us from ubsPrYing thP fourth, or last, contact. The day closed with a Yiolent storm of wind auu rai11; but, foriunatcJ~·. all om instrnment11 were quickly dismounted and plauell under shelter without serious damage. Observations for ascertaining the latitude of the eclipse-station were made by Capt. 0. H. Ernst, United States Engineers; and with the cheerful co-operation of Capt. Cecilio J>ujazon, director of the Sau Fernando observatory, arrangemeub; wi're made for determining the longitn1le of the Olh-ar station, by exchanging time-signals by telegraph, bnt the nnfayornble weather pren:nted tlte successful execntiou of these operations. Capt. Jos~ S. l\1ontop, chief of the Spanish Coast 8tn·yey, \-er,\ kiudly offered to cmrnect our eclipse-station witli the triangulation of the Spanish surn'~-s; and, iu a letter which I lla\·e 1.'eeeind since I returned to the rniteu States, dated at Sau l?ernando, January 2G, Captain Montop informs me that t·he proposed obserYations had been completed, and, from his determinations, the geographical position of our eclipse-statiou, Olivar do Bneria Vista, h; as follows: Latituue :w0 41 1 36'1 .4; longitude east of tlle observatory at San Fernando, 4 1 55{(.3, or, in time, HI'. 7. In the American Nautical .A.lmanac for 1870, tlte longitude of the Sau Fernando obserrntor~· is assumed to be 4i. 43rn 22".42 east of the meridian of 'Vashington, which loc·ates the Olivar eclipse-station 4 1' 43m 42'.l, east of the obsern1tory at 'Yasbington. In closing this official report, I again desire to express my sincere thauks to l\Iessrs. Davies, at Jerez, for tlJC many civilities rccei>ed from them; anti to Capt. Cecilio l'ujazon, director of the San Feruaudo olJscrYatorJ·, also to Capt. Jose S.

11'. F.

DEAR Sui: I havf' the 11ouor to repol'l upon my participation in tlw olisernitious of tlJC solar eclipse of 22d December, 18i0. vYhen, on !Jeing appointed a member of the United States Eclipse Expedition to the Mediterranean, I recei\'ed tl1e gratifying order to accompany the party that, under ,\,our pen;onal leadership, was to lw stationt>!l iu Sicil,'I·, I bel1ehl tliat, besitlt>s co11trilrnting my share in the astronomical obseryatiom:, the particular dnty eamr necessarily to me to bring to hear wlrnt lmowlellge of the eonntry. acqnire<l thn<> l>.r a longrr sojourn in former years, might he furthering the 1mrposl' of th<' expedition. It is ronso1iug· to me that while, in the former, the scientific iurnstigation, by a freak of the weather only a very partial sm·c<'ss foll to my lot, for the rest, my company at least indirectly has l>een, as I ho1w, of some usefnlne8s. This, ho\rnYer, for a great part, is owiug to the characteristic hospitality and n~adiuess to assist of th~ citizens of Catania. The names of some of the gentlernf'n \\'110 1hns lrnn· l11·pn of speeial help to ns I shall take the pleasure to mention below. In the preliminary prcpamtimrn at lwuw l <lirreted my attention to Jit my apparatus with the purpose to permit case anti effectiveness for inYestigating the solar a1)pendages by direct vision. The eclipse of August, 18G9, as ohser\"cd by myself and the members of my party at Des Moines, Iowa, had intimated so clearly a certain structural arrangement, both in protuberances and in corona, that a closer scrutiny of these phenomena seemed to me particularly desirable. I bad at my position an excellent tele1'co11e of Steinheil, of four inches aperture, five feet focal leng·th, the gift of ~fr. Litchfield on occasion of tbe prece1ling eclipse. Its ohject-glass is of exquisite perfectiou; it has powers ranging from 40 to 300, and is et1natorially mounted, with setting-circles aml tangent-screw for rigbt-ascensional motion. I ha1l uow made, in addition, (hy l\Ir. Ch nhbnck, of Utica,) a slid(', which holds simultaneously U1ree of the rye-pieces, so that, by the touch a Rpring, the power may be changed from the lowest to the hig·hest almost without loss of time and without fear of deranging the position of the telescope. Thus, when all the three eye-pieces are adjusted to focns, and an object is seen near the center of field through the lowest power, in less than a second the 11ighest magnifying-power may be brought to bear upon it. The consideration that nebnloo and gaseous bodies like comets usually reveal their various features only when viewed anti examined under varied proportions between light and power, led me to expect much of the described arrangement in scrutinizing the luminous appendages of the sun. :Moreo\"er, near to and at the side of the ordinary small seeker carried by the tube, (magnifying about nine times,) I had attached one of those beautiful little instruments called "band cometseekers" by Steinbeil. The one in ruy possession, only six inches long, magnifying two and a ha.If times, with an aperture of one incb, lms a field rather more than 170, which enables the observer to take in at one glance the whole of the eclipse-phenomena, eYen to the remotest rays of the corona. These together, therefore, may be said to represent, upon one and the same equatorial stand, tiv~. separate telescopes, differing in power and extem·ion of :field. 'J'he small seeker alone had a sun-glass; a wedge of neutral tint could be applied to either of the three eye-pieces of the large tube for graduating the light according to circumstances. The instruments were packed in four boxes, and went~ with the other instruments of' the expedition, from Liverpool by sea directly to Messina. As it was your wish that I might be early in Sicily to reconnoiter for the observing-stations, I left Clinton on October 29, and arrived at Linrpool on No-vember 14. Then, after a few days' sojourn in London, where we conferred with

~Ir. Lockyer aml !:!Ollie of t!te otl1er English ohserHrs, l;y t lie was of 8ontLarn1Jton, Gibr·altal', aud Malta, I reached Catania ou Decemher 7. Here I had tlie pleasure of meeting l\fr. Charles.\. Schott, alreads arriled two <lass before; also tlw Italian obser·ers were already on the spot, centered at Angosta, an<l Professor Cacciatore, director of the obseiTator,y of Palermo, and \'i('cpresiclent of tlie Italian commission, uirected a gre(·ting dispatch of welC'Ollli' to thr .\ merica ns ou Sicilian soil, which was duly respoudeu to in J\fr. Schott's au<l my uamf'. The following dnys were Rpent in looking· at localities in tlie ueighLmhornl of Catauia: wl1ere the instruments of the various observers might be established, aud 1 extewletl my reconnoitering trips o>er the slope of l\Iount Etna, and as far as Lentini anu Carlentini. The zone of totality (as indicated also 011 the accompanying sketch) covered tlrn whole sontlieast corner of the island of Sicily, including Cape Passaro, its nmiheru limit iuter:-;ecting the east shore of the island a fe\\· miles umth of 'l'aormiua. It woultl have been of some interest if obser·ers coul<l have been stationed along the wholP coa1't :from Cape Passaro to Taorrninn, forming- a line nearly at right angle to tlie patlr of the nroon~s shadow, and exten<ling nearly across the whole width of it. Yarious circumsbmce81 however, combiued to pre,·eut this scheme. Transportation, especial!~· i11 the southern part of the island, is still n:-ry difficult, no carriage-mad leadiug to Cape Passaro or its surrouncli11J!,·s. Already, for this reason, the more ponderons inRtruments were necessarily restricted to the neighborllooll of the largPr tmYllfi. ::\forc·on'r, tlie photographic and spectroscopic a1lparatus, besides 11eeding a longer accurate preparation nml nl,justmeut in a firm position, were to be stationed not too far from thP. central line of totality, in order 11ot to ha\·e too much curtailed the duration of two minntes iu maximnm. Fortunately, there were the three towns of Angosta, situated Yery near the central line, anu Syracuse aml Catania, about l1alf way :from it to the southern and northern limits respectively. Tile Italian astronomers hall establif;hed themseh·es at Angosta; at S,yracuse was tlw party of tlle United States Sa\·al O!Jserrntory; for our photographerB, ancl as hca!lquarters for timP a1Hl latitmlP ohserrntions, the hrst opportnuity was pre sented at Catania. There remainrtl the distribution of the portable telescover; fur ui1·ect e~-e-olJsei·,·atiou, which, supplementing tile spectroscopic investigation in this <"Clipse 7 it was hoped would essentially eontribnte to solY'1 the enigma of the natnre of the corona. Between English and Americans now united, t11ere wPre 011 ha11d, rnepared for tllis purpose, obsen·ers suffi<:ient in number to attack thr corona from stations situated more or less rccentrically across the whole zone of totality. A still more promiRing arrangement, howm·cr, seemed to l>t> offered spontaneously hy .Mount Etna. Usually 7 this mountain becomes snow-co,·ered, and ceaHes to be accessible beyornl the" regioue nemoroi::a" in the latter half of October. 'l'his year the mountain was quite exceptionally free of snow. I saw distinctly the Casa Inglese entirely free only iwo days before the eclipse. It seeme1l as if thus the mountain itself invited the obserYers. The idea of haYing a series of stations with lesser and lesser uensities of atmosphere (at the Casa In!lese the barometric pre::isurc is only 54.0 11n 11 , or two-thirds of that on the Jeyel of the sea) was too tempting; it would put decisively at rest tbe question whether the corona is simply an effect of our atmoBphere. Conseque·itly, a number of forces were dispatched for the slope of Mount Etna, arranged, so to say, upon the thin! co-ordinate-that of altitude. The llighest point w:-is reached by General Abbot, t:'nited StateR Engineers. I have trietl to represent in one \'iew upon tlie accompauyiug sketch the final disposition or all the stations in Sicily as tlley were occupied by parties of the various 11ations co-operating. '!'here ma;y be placed on record yet, as near as I <~ould ascertain, the names of the obser·ers ot' each station.

I come now to report on my part taken in observing the eclipse. With your conseut I located my station on the western top of the Monte Rossi di Nicolosi, on the identical spot that had formed a point in the triangulation of Mount Etna made years ago lly Baron Sartorius von Waltersbausen and myself. The immortal Gauss himself, for his own pleasure, in a leisure hour, had submitted our triangles to hiR theory of cornpenRation, and derived the most prolmble vahies for the signal on l\fonte Rosi;;i: - 12776111 .051 north; + c;o9om.214 west; conntcd from center of dome of the 111011astery of S. ~icola de' PI>. Beneuettini at UataDiH. The geographical position of the latter place was ascertained by myself at the time, aud lmi; lJeen redetermined by Jnr. Schott on this occasion. The co-ordinates stated, when reduced iuto arc b.Y meaus of Bessel's constants for the dimensions of the earth, will hell' 54".45 north, and 4' 811 .lS=lG·.r,45 west of Catania; and the elevation above the leyel of the sea we ha<l determined trigonornetrically at 94Sm.7. You allowed me the assistance of Mr. Eimbeck. We started from Catania early on Deccrul.Jer 21, and completed the last preparations at Nicolosi that same aftei·noon; in which_ was of much use to us the :young Doctor Bonanno, a native of the place, who also gave us his company upon the mountain the following day. Nicolosi is the last village on the southern slope of Mount Etna. 707m above the sea, whence to the top of Monte Rossi is about an hour's walk. Mr. Eimbeck was provided with.one of the Munich portable spy-glasses, (12 lines aperture, magnifying from five to six times,) and I used the telescope described above. Mr. Scbott had given us one of the Coast Survey chronometers, (Sid. Cbron. Hutton, No. 208,) which was compared at Catania immediately before and after the journey. Besides, in order to be independent of any change of rate the chronometer might suffer by transportation, it had been concerted between Mr. Scliott and myself to exchange signals by flashes of light, as a sort of heliotropes, using a couple of common mirrors that were brought to reflect the sun's rays in the direction of our stations. The moments when the light was withdrawn by a sudden turn of the mirror were noted with om respective chronometers. The signals were given before the beginning of the eclipse. Though but few of them, as was found afterward, could be made use of, either on account of indistinctness or from uncertainty of identifying them or from want of correspondency, still, the precaution of a check proved of some "\"alue, as the rate of the chronometer of Monte Rossi really appears to haxc changed considerably. The weather on the day of December 21 was fair, and promised a good success. In the after· noon, bowe-ver, I was forewarned by my old friend, the venerable Dr. Giuseppe Gemellaro, the "guardian" of Mount Etna at Nicolosi, that the ·barometer was going down; and, indeed, toward e"\"ening cloucls arose, the sky became overcast, and later it began to rain, storming during the night pretty heaviJy. The rain lasted still at 7 o'clock in the morning of the momentous day; but then it ceased, tbe clouds broke, the veil lifted itself, and Mount Etna stood there in glorious and

beautiful cleamess-suow-clail uow, as if it had exehauged its dark hue of yestenla,y for a \YLite. holiday dress to honor the occasion. Quickly the mules, that had been kept in readiness with their pack-saddles, were loaded with the instrnmeuts, and gay-hearted we ascended to the top of l\lontc Rossi; for the weather seemed to I.Jave exhausted its wrath, :rnd everything went 011 prornising beyond all expectations. Signals for time were exchaugetl with Mr. Schott, the sun shining lnight through the purest sk~-. Hy the Yillage-carpenter, whom I hacl hired to assist, the parallactic top· piece of the telescope was mounted on a wooden base. The axis I adjusted approximately to tlie meridian, pointing it by the eye a little east of the :Moutagnuola, (an eruption-crater of 1 rn::,) when' from "\Yaltershausen's chart I judged the meridian of Monte Rossi to pas:-;. The beginning of the eclipse was not·~d at1si. 4om 50· chronometel'-tilllP: = 18 :~rn ii3 .!J sidereal time ; = 0 36 36 .4 mean time. I am not sure, however, I.mt that this was too late b,y some seconds; for the strong umlnlatious which agitated the sun's lirn b may have concealed the real indentatiou of the UJOOJJ upon the dbsk :'>everal seconds before I became aware of it. Besides, though the instrument was placed on tl1e side sheltere(l by the top, it was not quite exempt from being shaken hy curn'nts of wind, tu which that rather isolated peak il'.l freely exposed. l\fr. Eimbeck, with his smaller glass, obserY('<l tl1P firflt co11tact at181' JOm 02'.5 chronometer-time: =18 39 56 .4 sidereal time; = 0 36 38 .9 mean time ; and estimates that the true coutact may have occurred about two Ol' three seconds earlier. During the partial eclipse, while smaller and smaller was growing the solar crescent, tile moou'15 edge was always .-ery steady ancl sharply defined. A great many people hy and by had gathered around ns-one might almost say the whole male population of :N"icolosi had climbed the mountain· They were most order]~- and respectfnl, howevPr, and remained modestly at the distance, beyond the-limits marked off by two American flags; so that there was hanlly need of the guard of three gensdarmes, whom the hitenr7rnte of the province of Catania kindly hail had the foresight to order to accompany us. Mean while a Yery suspicious-looking cloud came crcepiug around the northwest corner along thl' slope of l\Iount Etna, drawing alarmiug·ly nearer and nearer in proportion as the sun's sickle became narrower. It was a quarter of an hour yet until totality; already I saw our companions at the Terentina enn:loped in dense mist; five minutes later, and witlt a gush of wind, down came upon us rain-drops with hail and sleet, so that for protecting the object-glass I had to put the cap on. This hail-storm had the effect of dridng the crowd of people precipitomil,y 1lown-l1ill towarJ home. The mi1mte for the commencement of total eclipse was fast approaclliug-; those were moments of great auxiet~'· There is hope yet! I see the eud of the clond ; there is clear sk;\- below it, on the horizon in the northwest How slow the cloud moves! hut the cle:ir spot iR widening. "Tirue is up!'' But,, perlrn1ls, there is a11 error in the computation, for the darkness is no greater yet than any thick dense cloud alone would produce; we can read the chronometer all th!' time with the greatest ease. Throwing our e,re;; again upon that clear opening iu the nortl1we . .;t, \Ve behold it considerallly enlarged, but shiniug now witil a peculiar sombre, greenish-gray tiut, that casts oYer the whole landscape a certain awe. It"is the tinge produced by the shadow. There can be no doubt the tohl eelipse bas begun. The cloudy vail is rapidly gliding away: its followiug edge is a1lproaching the place wliere the star of the day must stand. ".e are read,v- with our telescopes.

With a disappointment, made only more_pa.inful by the thought that three minutes earlier would have sufficed for witnessing the entire phenomenon in a cloudless sky, I rcsigncu myself to dismount the instrument. l\Ir. Eimheck noted yet the end of the eclipse at21h 24m 4·.o chronometer-time: =21 23 7 .5 sidereal time; = 3 19 23 .2 mean time. . 1'he correction and rate of chronometer have been adopted as comput~d by Mr. Schott.

HEl'OHT OF THE ~UPEJUNTl~NDE:XT 01''

At Nicolosi we joiueu our compauious from the higher stations on ::\fount Et11a, who, equally unfortunate, moreover had had to sustain a greater degree of inclenwncy of the "Weather. Late in the evening "\'fe reached Catania. It may not seem amiss here to touch shortly upon the h;\1)othesi8 ail nrncPtl h,y some at tlw time, that the clornl interfering- with onr observations in Sicily just at the critical moment, cominµ: and passing by almost as rapidly as the obscuration of the o;un, possibly might ha Ye been prodnce1l by the eclipse itself. The moon, it was argued, interposing herself before tbe sun, hence Rhntting· off the solar heat, effected a cooling of the particles of air: aml comlenserl the Yapors in the line of the shadow. lndl1erl, if we incline to adopt the explanati011 advanced hJ· a tlistingnished pll,rsipist of tl1e origin of tlte solar spots, arnl in particular of the formation of tl1c nuclei of the same, 'we might here find au analogon. But if such was the case, if an eclipse was capable of producing its own cloud, why is it that a total eclipse ba!' ever been seen at all? In the present instance, the data are at hand for subYerting that hypothesis. The Yarious series of meteorological obserYatio11s since published show unmistakably tllat the atmospheric presi-;ure oyer almost the eutire lmsiu of the :\Iediterranean hegau to diminish already on the day before the eclipse, the barometer thereupou contiuui11g to fall steaclily. The cloudy aud stormy weather experienced, therefore, was preparing long before the Pclipse began, aml we can see nothing extraordinary in their coincidence. The same may be said likewise in regard to the yariatio11 of tlw magnPtic necdlP o!Jserve<l h,r the Italian party at Terra Xuova. In concluding this report I think it my duty to record the name::> of the gentlcrne11 who, with so much kindness and disinterestedneso;, furthered our untlertaking in Sicily, and who therefore have a just cl aim npon science for gratitude. 1n· the first place, among these I must mention the l\Iarqnis di San Giulia110, who, besi<les endeavoring in many ways to make the sojourn at Catania personally · pleasant to the members of the expedition, offered liberally, if desired as obserriug-stations, the comfort of bis villas at Yiagrande, at Yil!asmuuda, and at the Oarcarazzi aboye Catania. Of these, the last one now lias a place in science throngh the obsernltions made there by the Super· i11tendent's party. The aid of Mr. A. Peratoner, commlar agent of the United State8 at Catania, was frt-quently called into re11uisition, too often pei·haps in quite trivial matters. He gaYe his assistance assiduously; for this and for his other acts of kindness, a grateful memory remains with e>ery one of us. l'rof. 0. Silvestri, whose zeal and interest in the good success of the obserYations may be inferred froru his imrticipating in the hardships of one of the Etna parties, gave important assistance to our photographers by the use of his chemical laboratory. To my tried friend, Prof. G. Zurria, I owe much Yaluahle information about loca1ities; he contributed to Professor "'atson's good success by procuring a letter of 1ntrotlnetion to the hospitable J'vlessr8. :Modica, at Carlentini. Many other gentlemen aided us in Yarious ways, to name all of whom singly would be impossible. Our thanks are due for a standing inYitation to visit the rooms of the Casino aml of the Gahinetto letterario Gioeui. The cindario of the city of Catania, Signor )farchese di Casalotto, to whose antl10rity the abolished convent S. Nicola of tllc Benedictines now is subject, was alwa~·s anxious with prompt m·ders to satisfy our wislies. From the Sicilian customhouse officen11 wc experienced the greatest politenesi:;.

And, in thanking you, dear Rir, for ha\:ing offere<l me the occasion of seeing again a country that I had once seen sobbing under political absolutism, I may not omit to mention-if it does not seem impro1)cr in this place to speak of one's sentimc11ts-how, in looking clown from the top of )fonte Hossi over tlle plains, I could not help feeling with joy that we, from t!Je lanu of freedom, had come to a country not only blessed by nature in every re8pe<'t, bnt, 11ow, free too!

ON THE ADAPTATION OF TRIANGULATICN8 TO THE VARIOl'8 COND1TIONS OF CONFIW"RATIOC\ AX]) CHARACTEH OF TIIE SlTIU'ACE OF COUNTHY AND OTIIEH CAUSES.-HEPOHT TO l'HOF. IlEN.JA~llN PETUCE, SUPEIUNTENDENT, FEBRUAHY 20, lil7:l, BY CHARLES A. f'CHOTT, Ai-iSlSTAXT l'XITEU STATES COAST SUlffEY.

\Vhate>er may be the design of an~· g·eodctic operation, wliether to sun·e;y a portion of the entire surface of a country, or onl,y its coast or boundaries; or whetLer its purpose is to rnemm1·e arcs of the meridian, of tlie parallel, or inclinations in any azimuth, (as a contribution to the data for ascertaining the figure of the earth,) it mnst be based upon a triangulation, the gTeater or le><s complexity of which will depend chictly and necessarily on the bypsometrie features of the country and on the nature of its S'.Jrface. The adaptation of a triangulation to these Yal'ious conditions~ aud, at the same time, payiug proper atteution to accuracy, economy, aud rapidity of execution, requires special consideration in each case. Before discussing these conditions more closely, howoycr, it will be advantagcons to refer briefly to the different kinds of triangulation. For the sake of convenience they ha\~e been classified under the heads primarj·, secondary, and tertiary. These may be defined as follows: Primary triangulation is cl.Jaracterized by the maximum deYelopmcnt wllich tlw configuration of the country admits of. Its sides, tlterefore, may frequently exc:eed 160 kilometers (about 100 statute.miles) in length, while they ramly des.ceud below 30 kilometers (about rn miles) for sligltUy undulating i;;nrfaces, and never below :!O or j.'J kilometers (about 1j or li:i miles) in perlh~Uy leYt'l countries. Primary work is executed with the greatest possible accurac.Y, mid tlw uncertainty iu its resulting linear measures should he less than iio.'.uo of the lengLlt, (which represents au error of about one inch to the mile.) To reach a higher staudard of excellence, as for instance ziiiluiii·, or eveu a smaller fraction, requires the application of the most refined means at our djsposal. 'l'ertiary iriangulatiou, wliich should ue accommodated to the wants of the topographer an!l the 11ydrographer, practically brings its sides down to the minimum length demanded for pla111·· table work on a large scale, (about 7 ,- 1 ,100 to Ht-crn ;) tl1ey may be as short as 1 ~ or :!~ kilomett·rs, (1 or l~ miles;) ordinarily the sides vary between 5 and S kilometers, (about a and 5 mi!N;.) 111 this work an uncertainty of r.tliiii in the rcsultiug distances is not commonly considere<l ex:cessin1, Secondary, or tbe intermccliutc, triangulation simply effeets a connection between the aho\·e extremes. Any one of these classes of triangulation may form a distinct 01· separate series, :mil tli1· primary class always docs so; or tbe secondary and tertiary may cover the same area as the primary, in which case they are directly checked by it. Any series of triangles (or corn bi nations of triangles) designed to connect t1vo distant positions, such as opposite boundaries, terminal points of an arc, or separate branches of a triangulation-for instancn, those running aloug a coast or up a river-shoul<l he constructed as a main or prillcipal series, aloug which dil'itauceR and azimuths an· carried forward in the most accurate (relatfrely) aud expeditions manner. 'l'hc terminatioH tJf such branclies is usually strengthened by the measure of a check-base and of au astronomical azimuth. If a country is to be cov('red wit11 a net-work of triangles, (or combination of triangles,) the question will arise how to aITange these in the most eftecth-e manner; we may, for instance, gradually cover the whole area with mntiguous triangles, (arnl combinations,) all measured with equal care, taking advantage of the surface-irregularities to expand to the greatest scale practicable. 24 cs

This s~-stem has the disadvantage of leading rapidly into an unmanageable number of conditions to be satisfied in the adjustment of the parts, and this necessitates the parceling out of the network into certain connected, yet in a measure arbitrary, figures, not too extern;ive to be separately adjustable; and the further gradual adjustment necessary to remove the discrepancies along the junction or boundary-lines of the contiguous figures. On the other hand, we may first surround the surface by a connected series of triangulation to sene as a frame-work in which other primary traiierse serieR may be inserted, and after adjusting this figurell ma.y introduce a second system of parallel series of triangulation intersected by others (best at right angles to the former) in order to cut or sulJtlivide the intcrjacent (rectangularly-shaped) areas left by the preceding system, ~nd to continue such subdiyision of areas until tlle whole surface is covered sufficiently with trigonometrical stations. In adjusting any system, the preceding one upon which it depends is taken as not subject to any farther correction. As in the first method, every adYantage must be taken of the natural facilities offered by the ground, and sometimes diagonal or tie series may be more advantageoi!s than rectangular connections. For the survey of a coast-line or boundary we may run a main series parallel to the general direction of the lines, and select for it the most suitable ground; ltttcral branches at intcn-als will connect t.lie main series witll the coast or boundary. A series of triangles following a mountain-range, or axis of elevation, may advantageously rest with one side on the crest or slope and with the other on the plane at the foot of the eleYation; but the most fayorable case is that of a Yalle;y, of the proper width in comparison with the relative elevations, and a well-shaped triangulation resting on the crest of the ranges or hills on each side. The most difficult ground to traverse for primary triangulation are heavily-wooded parallel ridges, closely packed, and of nearly equal height, running at right augles to the direction of the triangulation. The general direction and character of a triangulation having been decided on, we haYe next to consider its composition. A series may be formed of a single string of triangles, of a double string, or hexagons, (or of other polygonal figures,) of quadrilaterals, or it may be composed of any combination of triangles. Since any of these systems may find its llroper application, according to circumstances, a somewllat closer examination of their relative merits seems to be demanded. The plainest form is that of a single string of equilateral triangles, and is the one to be adopted when economy and rapidity of execution are the first requisites; the hexagons (connected either axially or binged) commend themselves when a large area is to be covered; aml a third form, that of quadrilaterals, offers itself as the one possessing greatest strength or admitting of the greatest accuracy. The relative value of the usually mixed systems may be judged from their characteristics when compared with the three simple systems just mentioned.

\Vith respect to the number of stations to be lJuilt up or occupied, system I is the most f:woralJlt', aud II and III are almost equal; with respect to length of sides, of special importance when lines luwe to be cut through l1eav,\· woods or bm:sh, system 1 is least unfa,·orahle and SJ·stc-m III s]jghtly better than s~·stem II; with respect to area cm·ered, system II is by far the most ad>antageous, the otlier systems showiug hut 011e-l1alf and less, than tlie hexagonal; this s_ystcm appears, therefore, best adapted when sprea1l of triangulation ii' most desirable; !Jut if axially arranged, the hexagon sare lt>ss favorably dii;posed, lJeiug IHtrrower and lacking the salient poiuts of the ordinary eounecti011. ·with respect to the n um bcr of gc.ometrical conditions, ·system Ill is tlie most fa\'orable, and, with tliesc conditions sntisfied, will couscqueutly be capa!Jle of giYing the greatest relative accuracy. Strength, however, is here gained at the expense of area. Generally, for comparatively flat stufaces, the hexagonal, and for cou11trieil tra>ersed by mom1tain-ranges, the quadrilateral system, may be employed with ad\Tantage, while for rapidit,\- of work and cheapness a string of single triangles is unsurpassed; yet, howeyer complicated, mixrn1, st.retched, or distorted the actual scheme may be, we alwa~'S keep in view that the greatest care is to be giyen to the measures connected with this main series, while at Uie same time due attention is paid to the secondary objects, thus saYing re-occupation of the primary stations in connection with subordinate oJ)erations.t Two other systems of survey may here be noticed, designed to meet the special diflicult~- where want of breadth makes the ordinary methods ina})l)Jicablc. Their use a11plies to the. case of a narrow sea-beach fringed with woods which it may be undesirable or impracticable to penetrate. The system first to he described, and which has been successfully employed on certain parts of onr southern coast, consists in actually measuring a series of connected lines, as in base-measures, either with rods or wires, the termini of each line being at the nia.rimum distance admitting of intervisibility, aml in measuring the angle or difference of azimuths at each junction. Each one of such lines may be composed of a number of broken lines, but the parts are referred to the single straight line at which angles are measured. Owing to the expense of line-measures, the application of this method is limited. Iu the secoml auxiliary method, due to Strnve,t this objection is met hy the substitution of a number of small base-lines-that is, one for each long line-and located so as to be at right angles aml bisect each other as nearly as may be, thus forming a series of greatly drawn-out quadrilaterals. The horizontal angles are then measured at the ends of the little base, also at the terminal points of the long line, the length of which thus becomes known. The base may be from one hundred to several hundred meters iu lengtb, and that of the long line or diagonal *If in system I, n =number of stations, not less tlmn 3, the;_;~umb;-~£-;;;;;;diti-;_;-ns ~11 - 2; for Bystc;-Il,

may be from ten to fifteen time;; that of the base. Azimuthal differences are measured as before, and the computation of tlle latitude and longitude of the t>0i11t8 is effected as in ordinary triangulation. TLis last expedient may lJe of occa;;ional help when 011erating on shores obstructed by watercourses, lagoons, or swamps. Islands or rocks, lying oft' shore at no great distance, frequently sn1iply tlte means of carrying a subordinate series of triangulation along shore.

The following remarks on the leugth of primary lJase-lines, and on their mutual distances, ma:y find a proper place at the conclusion of this paper. In the present state· of practical geodesy, primar,y base-lines of a length of about 10 or 11 kilometers (nearly G:\ statute-miles) represent a fair aYerage.* The intervening triangulation varies greatly in length. This depends principally on the size of the triangles and on the accuracy of the measures; ;yet ordinarily any two primary lJasc-lines may be found separated 'by a distance from fort~' to eighty or e\"en one hundred times the average length of a base; that is, from about 400 to 900 kilometers, (about 250 to 560 miles.) Tertiary base-lines are usually between i and 1~ kilometers (about:! and 1~ statute-miles) in length, and in a chain of tertiary triangulation not other'i\"ise checked may follow at intervalH of about !O or 70 kilometers, (nearly 25 or 44 miles.) The properties of a base-line, or, more strictly, of its theoretical eqnivnleut, have been but little investigated, and a few remarks respecting its definition may not here be deemed out of place. A base-measure may be conceived to proceed from· the starting-point A, on tho snrface of a 8plteroi<l, in a plane containing both its vertical and the terminal poiut n, and to be continued so that at any point of it its linear element be situated in tlle plane passing through its uorma.l and through the termini A and B. A curye so traced will in general be of double curvature, and lie lJetween (excepting the case of A aml B lying on the same parallel) tbe two plane elliptic arcs a aud b, which result, the first from the intersection of the spheroid by the vertical plane containing the normal of A and the point B; the second from the intersection of the plane containing the normal of Band the point A. Tbe element of the curve at. A will necessarily coincide with the arc a, and at B with the arc b, and the cune will be similarly related to these arcs; that is, the 8ame curve will be traced out whether we start from A toward B or from B toward A. It bas, from its definition, the property that for any point in it the forward and backward azimuths diifor 180°; and since the terminal points A and .B lie in the plane of its normal, the azimuthal plane must contain the chord or straight line joining A and B. The curve will also be marked out by the junction of the foot-points of normals let fall from every point of the chord to the surface of the spheroid. The curve, being situated apparently in a direct line between the terminal points, may be distinguished by the name" direction-line," the name base-line liaving been given to the line actually measuretl, and which is composed of a number of straight lines. Doctor Bremikert pertinently remarks that the name "geodetic line" should properly have been gi \'en to this curve, since it actually enters into the two fundamental geodetic operations, viz, the linear and angular measures; the latter on account of the tangency of the curve to the plane of the arc a in which the line of collimation of a theodolite stationed at A is situated. The name "geodetic line," however, is already appropriated for the shortest line (and which does not always lie between the arcs a and b) that can be drawn between two points on the surface of the spheroid, and which differs in direction from the curve here considered.

DESCIUPTION OF A NEW FORl\f OF ::\fERCTJRJAL Homzo~, IN WHICH YlBRATIQ~tj Al:E EXTIKGUISHED, llY J. li0)1ER LANE, OF WASHINGTOK, D. C.

In the operations of the Office of Weights aud :Measures, occasi.rn bas ariseu for the nse of tlw collimating mercurial horizon. This is not the place to report upon the special use to he ma(lc· of it iu this office; but an improvemeBt has been made in the mercurial horizon itself, which is likl"l~· to prove valuable for tbe purposes of practical astronomy. At the united request, therefore, of tlle Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent of the Office of \Yeights and ::\Ieasures, I here communicate a description of it for the American Associatiou. 'l'he improvement consists simply in reduciug the depth of mercury in the trough to a nrs small quantity. This extinguishes the oscillations or wa,·es, which otherwise, upon tlie slightest causes, disturb the reflection >Yhcn the horizon is used with a telescope. Tbe least (foptl1 with which pure mercury will o\·ertlow a horizontal non-metallic plane surface is a little O\'er one-eighth of an inch. If, bowe.-er, tile mercurial lake be left of this full depth, at au<l near its boundary, with room for the capillary cun·e, then, inside of this encircling space, the bottom of the trongh nw~ rise as near as we please to the level surface of the liquid. The first trough which we haye tried on this plau is the only one that lias licL'll used prim to this current week of the present meeting of the association. It was a woode11 trough, fornw11 i11 the lathe, with a horizoutal circular plane or plateau, of six inches diameter, 011 n IPn:l so11wthi11g like one-sixth of an inch higher than the bottom of the deepest part of a margin of t,,.o ind1es wi1k all around it. The deepest part of this depressed margin was in the middle of its wi<lth, the ol·ject being to soften the horizontal shocks which may be commnnicate1l to the mercury; but I thi11k this is of little importance or value, since the capillary boundary will still he the origin of ripples produced by vertical shocks. The ripples of the surface of a mass of mercur_y produce<l bj· trewors are observed, in fact, to have their origin mainly at the borders; and this is the reason why the central fl.at plateau of the trough was made so large. as six inches in diameter, while the clear aperture of the telescope collimatetl over it was only from two to two and one-half inches in diameter. In preparing the horizon, the trough was first set very near1y horizontal by a spirit·lm·el. A sufficient quantity of mercury was then })Oured iu to oYerflow the whole bottom of the trough, at least with the aid of a little displacement. 'l'he large excess of mercury was then llrawn off through a small hole which had been made at the deepest part of the deepmwd margin, and elosed by a little plug. The mercury was allowed to flow until the level of its stufacc sank to the indicatiou of a gauge laid across the top of the trough, leaviug a YeQ· thin layer only on the plateau. The efiect of this artifice in curing the disturbance produced hy tremors was charming and complete. But to secure this effect, care must be taken that the depth of mercury on the plateau be reduced sufficiently. It is quite surprising to notice lww small a depth ii-; still sufficient to transmit across the plateau the little ripples that mar the sharpness of the retlection. I made no determination of the thickness used, lJut I think one-hundredth of an inch. is small enough. It is easy, hy gentle taps upon the trough as the mercury flows off, to notice when the ripples, with. the ilimiu. isbing depth, begin to grow sluggish, anu wlieu the point is reacllell at which tlw:r quickly die out on the Jllateau . .Although the depth is so small when this effect is thoroughly secured, it _yet Yery greatly trauimends the thickness of a mere bubble or film of capillarit.r, and, therefore, there il'l no room to anticipate that the surface of the plateau will haYe any influence upon the horizontality of the upper surface of the mercury. In point of fact 7 the horizon above described has been nuder the

190

HEl'OH'.r OP THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

scyerest telescopic test, and yet the irregularities of the plateau were not sufficiently copied by the mercurial surface to mar tile definition of the object-glass. To the same purpose, I will state that on one occasion the trough was tilted slightly by pressme made on one side of it with a staff. l\lomentarily the mercurial surface tilted with the plateau by a large quantity, aR seen in the telescope; but the changed inclination of the plateau being maintained by continuance of the pressure, the mercurial surface soon settled, upon the inclined plateau, into its original position of 110rizontality, any difference being at all eyents quite insensible in this imperfect experiment. We shall now, however, have opportunity to put this question to a more rigorous test with a cast-iron trough, which has just been completed, aml which, by the kind11ess of rrofessor Hilgard, Lam permitted to submit, through him, to the inspection of the association. ' '.rhis iron.trough has a circular plateau of about six inches in diameter. Tlte deepened margi11 around the plateau increases the diameter to six and one-half inches. This deepened margin, at its nnter boumlar,y, is extended downward all around in a very narrow annular passage, to the depth of tl1ree-fourths of an inch below the level of the plateau, where it opens horizontally outward into au annular reservoir, oue-half inch wide, which surrounds the tilateau, and rises a fraction of an inch abo\·e it. Tl.tis an11ular resen·oir is closed air-tight aboYe, but is provided with a screw-vahe to coutrol the passage of air. 'Vheu this screw-val ye is opened, and air forced in through a flexible tulle with the n1011th or othcrwiflc, the mercury in the annular reservoir is forced through the auunlar pm;sage :,ind tlows over the plateau, and is snflicicnt in quantity to flood it throughout. Tlie~coutiuuit_y of surface over tlte plateau having been secured, the mercury is allowed to flow back into the mrnnlar resen·oir; and the whole quantity of mercury may be adjusted so as to settle to the depth that is desired ou the plateau. The rapitlity of this return-tlow of the mercury may be coutrolled by checking the escape of air through the screw-vah'e. Should any accident cause the breaking of tlw film of mercury, the arraugement here described affords the means of its convenient and speedy renewal. The film will uever break except by accident. 'l'he screw-YalYe: can also he used to suspenrl the return-flow until the trough, which is furnished with loYelinµ;-screw,.;, can be 11wele1l hy the surface of the mercnry. '£he plateau should he IIHHlc of a material pervious to air, so as to allow of the escape through it of the small bubble of air which the mercury imprisous in completing its continuity at.the first tloodiug. '.rhe bubble docs indeed flatten out a good deal under the capillary curve, but the conditions of the currnture fix a definite limit to tile diameter of the bubble, aud so to the smallness of its depth. Accordingly, in ex11erimenting with the cast-iron horizon described, it was found that tl10 tbin film frequently broke over this air-bubble. This drawhack was not encountered in the use of the wooden horizon fir>it made, although that had, I belieye, been varnished. The remedy proposed, yiz, the:use~of a material pervious to air, is more simple and satisfactory than any method which has occurred. to me of making the completion of' continuity take place oft of the plateau. Though cast iron is, in a degree, porous, it is doubtful whether it can be made sufficiently pervious, tJ10ugl1 this may yet be tried by removing .the outer film of the casting from the under surface as well as the upper, and avoiding all use of lacquer. 'l'he objection to wood as the material of the plateau is the difficulty or trouble of conquering its rnriability of form. A plate of plaster of Paris can easily be substituted for the cast iron in that part. wltich forms the plateau, aud a little of the deprP,ssed border around it. Its comparative fragility will hardly be a Rerious objection in a fixed observatory. If plaster be the material chosen, the plaster plate wouhi rest upon an annular shelf formed in the iron skeleton by the lathe, and may be cast in its place by inverting the iron skeleton upon a mold or former. The skeleton may be at a relatively low temperature at the moment of forming the plaster cast, or other means taken to gu:wd against possible distortion by unequal expansion and contraction. The accorn1>anying wood-cut shows a vertical section through the center of the iron trough as it has been made. A A is the plateau, cut clown around the border so as to le.ave space for the cun·e of capillarity, and for a considerable mass of mercury beneath this curve. The falling away of the plateau shoulcl,.begin at a distance of not less than four-tenths of an inch within the wall that confines the mercury. BC is the narrow annular passage through which, by forcing in air at the air-tube D, the mercury contained in the annular reservoir E may be driven until it .floods the plateau. After the mercury has been drawn down again under check of the screw-valve F, this screw-rnlve must be leftJully open in:order to avoid all risk of confining the air in the upper part

DIRECTIONS FOR SETTING tTP AND TTSING TIIE HORIZON.

Place the trough upon a firm support. Level it 1ly means of its three foot-screws, ke<·ping these screws always secure from shake b.r means of their tightening-nuts. The lcYel or want of lenil is ascertained by lasing a spirit-leYel across the top of the trough along two (liametcn;, :tlJ(l turning it end for end on each diameter. If, however, the trough bas not been made with tlw plan<· of its top truly parallel to the plane of the plateau, it should be furuished with a spirit,-len·l sl1ort enough to rest upon the plateau itself. But care muHt he taken to avoi<l abrasion of the platean, especially if it be formed of plaster of paris. Across the top of the trough lay the straight bar J, I,, or gauge-bar, in which works, near its front surface, a vertical screw of steel, fiuish<·d ,~·ith a flat face at the lower eud to form the gauge-point 1\1. Take care that this gauge-point is at tirst 8<'t sufficiently higll not to strike and injure tlie surface of the plateau. Then screw it, downwanl till it will begin to pinch a thickness or two of common writing-paper laid upon the plateftu. This adjustment being made, lay aside the gauge-bar for after use. Now pour upon the plat(·an as 11mcl1 thoroughly purified and cleau mercury as is judged to be a slight oyercharge, fin;t takinl! care tltat the screw-valYe F is fully open for the free passage of air. It will make its way tbroug-h the annular passage B 0 into the annular reserYoir E, driving before it the air of the l'escn·oir, and none will be left on the plateau unless the charge of mercury is considerably too large. For otherwise, the rapid tlow, with the screw-valve F fully open, will break the film over the edg-e of tlw plateau while yet the small excess of mercury remains accumulated upon tl1e central parts. See that the whole plateau, togetl1er with the higher part of its depressed border, is free from particle,.; of dust or dirt, going over it if necessary with a soft brush or a linen rag. Being provided witli a piece of quarter-inch India-rubber tnb(l three or four feet in length, slip one end of it upon the air-tulJc D, and apply the month to the other end. Force in air by the action of the muscles of the mouth, as in using a blowpipe. In this way a steadily-sustained pneumatic pressure is brought to bear upo~ the surface of the mercury in the reservoir E. Under this the mercury is forced back through BC, and overflows the lllateau. Shoul<l the volume of mercury be somewhat largely deficient, it may happen that an insular patch of the plateau is left unco-'l"ered after the mercury has been alJ expelled from the reservoir E.' More mercury must then be adde<l; and if in makiug this addition fresh specks of dirt should come into contact with the plateau, the mercury is allowed to flow back

again into the reservoir. This flow being unchecked, the plateau will be left uncovered, unless the addition of mercury has been considerably too large. Otherwise, break the remaining la~cer of mercury with a piece of clean paper, when it will all retire, at least with a little aid from a soft brush, into the space formed by the depression of the 1>lateau along its border. The uncovered plateau is then freed from the added specks of dirt, and the operation of flooding it with mercury is repeated as before. .A certain volume will suffice to extinguish the insular patch of uncovered plateau, and form an unbroken lake of mercury. On then removing the mouth from the India-rubber tnhe, the lake of mercury will begin flowing freely back into the annular reservoir. But before the surface of the lake bas had time, in its descent, to break upon the border of the elcvatetl plateau, the screw-valve Fis promptly closed. The flo" of mercury from the lake into the annular reservoir then ceases, and the surface of the lake quickly becomes level throughout,, The screw-valve F is then thrown open for a moment, and instantly closed again. The momentary renewal of the flow will produee a flow-wave, which will be seen by the eye to start at the border of the lake and end at its center. .As rapidly as the level of the lake approximately renews itself, the momentary opening of the valrn is repeated, until it is seen that no further flow takes place, and the mercury in lake and reservoir bas settled to a common level. The valye is then left fully open. .All this is quickly done after a little practice. If there be a deficiency of mercury, the film on the plateau will break before this stage is reached, and another addition of mercury must be made. If' there be an excess of mercury, the film on the plateau is not only unbroken but may be too deep. The depth is ascPrtainetl by applying the gauge-bar with its previously-acljusted gauge-point J\f. .Auy excesR of mercury is drawn off little by little at the screw-plug H till the film is reduced to the prescribed thickness shown by the gauge-point, or till the ripples produceu by gentle taps made on the trough die sluggishly out "Without traveling half.way from border to center. .After the charge of mercmy has been once adjustecl, nothing more is necessary than to keep it unchanged. At the first flooding of the plateau it may happen that a speck of dirt is picked up by the mercury, borne on its surface, carried over the rolling and advancing edge of the moving fluid stratum, and so becomes buried beneath the mercury and in contact with the plateau. In this situation it will remain if not removed, and will, if thick enough, break the thin film of mercury to be formed. If, in consequence of stancling for a length of time unrenewed, the surface of the reflecting film becomes tarnished or dirty, a fresh clean surface can be reproduced in a minute or two hy breaking the old film, brushing it from the plateau if time has caused adhesion,* and repeating the process above described for flooding the plateau and forming the film anew. A caution of general application to any mercurial horizon may here be addeu. For accurate astronomical purposes care should be taken not to use the re:fiectiug surface too near the edge. The deflection of the surface from horizontality by the force of capillarit;r may amount to 111 .0 at but little less than an inch from the extreme border of the mercurial lake, and increases very rapidly on any nearer approach to the border. 'Vhen for transportation it becomes necessary to remove the mercury from the trough, most of it can be poured out as from a plain trough, but a little will remain in the annular reservoir. This is readily removed at the screw-plug G. If care be taken to avoid loss of the mercury, and to store it in a bottle b.r itself, this ·wm save the trouble of repeating the process of adjusting the quantity when the trough is rechargell, arnl the weight of the charge may also be record eel on the trongh.
·Adhesion, if it takes place, cannot be sup11osed to affect the horizontality of the rellcetiug surf.wo, since it does not iuterfe.re with the absolnt<i Jlnitlity of tile stratum of mercury. It only ta.kes eftect at the surface of contact between the llni<l stmtum and tho plateau.
