REPC)RT.

The fiseal year 1890 has been marked b~- a steady aml systematic den~lopmen t of the operations of the Survey in both field and office, and by advances so notable in the closely allied work of tlie Office of Weigh ts and Measures as to con,;titu te an l:'pod1 iu metrology. Field operations involving one or more of the classes of work here named: hase measurement and triangulation, the lletermiuatiou of latitudes, lougitndl's, a1Hl azimutlis ll,Y astronomical observations, the determinations of heights hy geodct.ic Je.n·liug anti by vertical angles, topographical surveys, magnetic obseiTatious and iletermiuationi:; of the force of graYit,r, were in progress on tile coasts or witliin the limits of twenty-eight States, two Territories, and iu the District of Columbia. Geo1letic work, iutemled to furnish geogrnpl1ical positions or dt,tenninations of heights in couuectio11 with Btate geological or topographical ,;un·e_ni, wa:s carried un in the States of Massachusl'.tts, NPw .len;ey, Te1111essee, Arkansas, \Yii-;con,;i11, arnl J\linuesota. B,ydrographic surveys, iuclnding inshnre and offshore 8mm1ling·;;, arnl oh~ern!tions of tides and currents, were prosecuted i11 the water~ or off the coasts of ~PH'lltPt'll States aml one Territor,y. , Invest,igations in physical hylhogTaphy werP coutinurnl; tlH·sp ineltuled obiwrvatious of shore line clrnuge,; due to tidal aml waYc iLdio11 on the coast of Uapc I \ill; obsen·atious of tidal and current mo.Yement11 and gaugiug,; of discharge in J,ong· Island :-=.ouwl; ohserYationR of sea-water densitim; near tlie Delaware Breakwater, and ohsernttio1i.-; of \'llITt:>nts in the (~nlf fitrearu. IucltHled in the. work afield and atloat were some speci;tl operntions of which hrid' mention is here made. \Vhile the direct benefit to the connt.l',v of an acenrat·· ,;urvey of its coast,; is quit!' oln·ious, there are uot unfrequcutly certain re~mlts of great ,-alne to the Gtffel'!lllll'llt which am only incidentally brought out. The exii;tcnm\ or a. series of triaugulatiou points carefully \l\>termined in position 011 tile coasts of I .. ong falaIHl a11<l Block falarn1 made it pos,;ihlll for the o!'lker commamling the OoaRt and Geodetic SurYey 11tcamcr Blal.:e to lay out a course of exactl,Y the required length for the trial trip of the new armorc1l crui:wr Pltiladelphia. '!'he 1'.011ditions nuder which in June, 1890, this trial trip wa.s malle, were, it is well known, s11ch as demat1tletl a 40-mile course at sea with limits defined by ra!lge marks ou shore, and an errnr or any rnag·11itnde i11 the determination of it8 leugth might have im·ol \"ed a lo8s of hm11lreds of t honsaml,; of dollars to the Government. The measured sea-mile iu the eastern passage, .Narragansett Hay, laid out as a trial course for uaval vessels by the oflicer commalllliug the Blnke i11 the snmmer of 188!J, depends also for its exact length between the limitiug range marks upoll the already existing triang-ulrl.tiou. One of the aims of the Sun·ey, kept steadily iu view, ii:; co-operation with other branches of the Government service whenever such co-Dperation can be made a\·ailable to secun; results of value to both services and at a less cost than if tlie operations were carried on l'eparntdy. An instance of this, where a Elingle steamer dill the work of two, was the detail of an officer of t1ie Survey early iu the summer of 1890 to prosecute investigations in physical hy1lrography in tlH' waters of Long Island Sound in co-operation with Professor Rathbuu of the Fish Commission, the commander of the steamer Fish Hawk furnishing transportation and other facilities for the work. Later in the season, the commander of the Coast and (}eodetic Survey steamer Blake was instructed to co-operate with Professor Libbey of the Fish Commission in making obsen'ations of temperatures, densities, and currents to the south of Martha's Vineyard. Such co-operation has been found to he not imfmitful of valuable i:1uggt-stions relating to improvements in the methods and ap{Jliances of work.

lT.XJTED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

A question h:t\·ing arisen between tlle States of 11aryland and Yirginia ai.- to the interpretation of the award of tlw ~trbitrawrs of 1~77, respeeting the location of a part of the boundary line between those State,::, the subject was reforred h~' their rei,;pecfrrn Governors to the Superintendent, aud upon their req1rnst he detailed au officer of the Survey, who made the necessary examinations on the ground and sn limi tt('tl a final a ward. By llirection of the Secretary of the Treasury, and at the request of the president of the Fish awl Game Commi,.;siou of the State of Ohio, the Superintendent d('.t<tilcd all officer of the Survey to (·stablish the limits of certain fishing tracts within tile jurisdiction of tlu1t State on the shores of Lake Erie. Allvkes have been rt>cei v·e<l from the officers in charge of th£; parties oft.lie Survey encampe<1 at or near the cros,:;ing,; of the one hundred and forty-first meridian with the Yukon and Porcupine Wvcrs, .AJaska, and engaged in making a preliminary determination of the boundary line between Alaska and British Uolumbia. antl the ~orthwest Territory. These adYices, which ine to ,lune 1·\ 1890, for the party on the Yukon Hiver, and to .January 2-J. 1890, for the party on tlw Porcupine River, express the intention of those ofli.ccrs to remain at their 110sts thronghou t the winter of 1890-1891. in the hope of bei11g <tble to report satisfactory progress in their arduous dutiN;. Almost incessant rain and fog in the autumn aftn their arrival, an<l intense coltl during tll(\ f.oJlowing winter, the temperature frequently ranging from -30° to-.59° Fain., greatly delayed field work. Advantage was taken of the voyage of the U. S. Eclipse Bxpedition to the west coast of Africa to detail au oiTlcer of tlrn Survey to accompany it for tht~ purpose of making observations of graYity alll.l the magnetic elements at a numller of stations where comparative observations of this character were great 1y desired. Mention more in detail of these special operations will be made later in this volume.
OFFICE OF \VEIGIITS AND '1EAST;UE8.

In achlition to the duties deYolving upou tbe officer of the Survey appointcc1 by the President to repre:-;eut the United States at the Ninth Conference of the International Geodetic .Association held in Paris in October last, instructions were given him to bring to Washiugton one of the two i;ets of the National Prototypes of the Metre and Kilogramme that had been allotted to the United States. Thi8 set consisted of tl1e National Metre Protot,ypes Nos. 12 a11d 27, and the National Kilog-rarnme Prototype .No, 20. These standards were constructed under the direction of a committee appointe(l by the International Conference c;f \Yeights and Me:tsures, and had been carefully compared with the standards selected to remain iu Paris i11 charge of the International Bureau of \Veights aml Measures, and to sene as the international or fundamental prototypes. The otlicer uesignatt·d to convey these valuahle standards from Paril'\ to vVasl1ington having delinirc(l them to the SuperintP1Hlm1t in Nm·ember, 1889, arra11gement was made under his direction for their being recei\'e<l and opened by the President of the Vnitell States. 'l'his was done at the Executive illansion 011 .January 2, 18HO, in the presence of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the TreaRury, and the 8upm-intcndent of the Coast and Heodetic SurYe_y and of \V eights and Mea~mres. togetl1er with a uuriilwr of other gentlemen interested officially or personally in the evcut. These protot.nws are now iu the custod.r of the Office of"Weights and Measures. It was hut a few days later in the mouth that the lutematioual .American Conference in session at vrasllingtou amn·o\·ell tbe I't>JlOrt of its Comu1ittee on Weights and Measures recommending the "adoption of tho metrical decimal system" of '~eights and measures to the nations there represented who had not al1·eady signified their acceptauee of it. This Yery important action, considered in connection with the fact that the nse of the metric tJ.ystcm iu this <·ountry was legalized h:> act of the Congress in 1snn, and that since that date it ba1> been afloptcd hy the greater 11umber of civilized and progressini nations, leads me to recommend that steps slwnltl he takeu l>y the Oongress to insure its introduction in the customi; service. l 11 April, 1890, at the iusta.uce of the Secretary of State aud with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, I deputed au officer of the Survey to proceed to Paris and to convey to Washing.

II.-OFFICE WORK.

Demands upon the Sun'ey for 1b; charts and other publications have increased so largely <luring tbe past year as to tax to tlie utmost tl1e catHtcit_y of the Office to supply them. So great ·was the demand for charts tbat the Otllce presses were found unequal to meet it fully, and this fact emphasizes the rNiomrnen!lation made by the ,\.ssi.stct11 r, iu charge of Office and Topography in his aunnal report ( Appewlix S11. 4) that both the plant and the personnel of the Engraving and Printing Di .-isiou should he iriereasell, and arl!litional room ht\ provided for their accommodation. Au item for the cost of thi.s increa;;e wa8 included by the Bnperintemlent in l1is estimates for the ti seal year 1891 (Iteport for 1889), aud is again made.in his estimates for the fiscal year 1892, pages 10 and 15 of this volume. Sixty-three tbommml one hundred and fifty-one copies of charts were issued duriug the year, au incrt·ase of nearly U,000 copies over tlrn number issued in the fiscal year i889, and of upwards of 20,000 onr the issue of 1888. In the liscal year 1885, ~8,905 copies of charts were issued; the increase in 1listrihutio11 since tliat year has heen, therefore, 118 per cent. Them were sent to chart agents for sale 3:!,3:J5 copies of cha!'ts. 011 .J nn P 30, 11'190, the total nurn ber of these agencies was 79; ou the Atlantic aml (}nlf t~oasts 1;3, and on the Pacific coast 16. lfor the use of Congremi 3,2HH copies of <Jharts were supplied, and to the Executive Departmentll 21,~141 copies, including 3,048 copies fo~ the use of the Survey. For foreign governmentR 1,120 copies were required. Thl:'rn were received iu the Chart room for issue durin~ the year 28 new charts. Seven of these were from engnt\'cd plates, anil '..!1 from photolithogrnDhs of drawings or tracings. The manuscript of a new Uat.alogue of Charts was prepilred and seut to the printer. Special mcutiou is made of the publication and issue of Notices to Mariners and Bulletins under Leadings immediately following. 'ride TableR predi«ting for the calendar year 1891 the times and heights of every high and lo.w water duriug that year at the principal ports on the Atlautic and Pncifie coasts of the Unitetl States were published in .Ma,y and ,June, 1890. These tables furnish also consta11ts for obtaining the times and heights of the tide at 661 additional ports or anchorages on the Atlautic coast, and at 218 adtHtional ports or anehorage:,; on the Pa.cific. Within the la.st two )"ears tidal data have been iuclnlled for a number of stations on the coasts of British America and Lower California. Among· the pubhcati<ins received from the printer during the year were the Annual Report of the Superintendent for the fiscal year 1887; tables for converti11g customary and metric weights aud measures, and extra editions of froni 100 to 700 copie11 of ten of the Appendiees to the Report for 1887. These are pul>lished to meet special requests for i·esulb~ of the work or descriptions of its instruments, methodi>, aml processes, and are supplied without cost to those who app1y tor them.

RESFLTR OF 'IIAGXJ<:'!'lc o'BsERYATIONS AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

In Appe1111icN; Nos. 8 aml !) to tbis volume~ Ai;mistant Charles A. Schott presents a discus;;;iou ullll report of the rPsnlt& of the magnetic obflervatinns, botl1 absolute and dHforential, ma!le at the Magnetic Observatory at Los Angdcs, California, between the years 1,882 and 1889. Part l of the report relates to the result;;; of the absolute measures for the magnetic declination, dip, and iutensity, and a1>pears as Appernlix No. 8. In Part II (Appendix No. !I) tbe differential mPasures. of tlw llt>clinat.ion am dis.cussed; tlJOS.t\ of the inclination (or <lip) and inten1:1ity will br· the suhjPct of s.uhs1·q11··11t papel's. ThP ofli1·prs iu ehai·ge of tl1l\ Ohservatory during the period referred to were Marcus Baker Acting ARsistaut; Carlisle TPrr.v, jr., Snh-assistant, a1Hl RE. Halter, ARsiRtant. It wa;;; in conformity with tlte general plan of magnetic observation and research prosecuted by the Sun'e.Y arnl i 11 co operation with the work of the Iuternational Polar Commi.ss.ion that :w observatory for ohtaiuing during a er\rtain term of years i1 continuous regist,ration of the changes of magnetic forr-e was establiished at r,os Angeles. This continuous registration was maintained withont serious i11terruption from October 1, 1882, to October 1, 1889, by means of the Adie magnetogra.J>hs, the changes of ma.gnetie force being recorded photographically. A period of nearly t.wo-thirdi:; of a s1t1H1pot cycle was thus coYered, i nclrnling the time of minimum sun-spot activit..v, whicl1 is supposed t.o have occurred 1>a.rly iu the year 1889.

Supplementar~· to the diffomntial memmres were the absolute magnetic measure;; which were made monthly on three (lay;; about the middle of each mo11th, and were intended to furnish the means of expressing the results of the differential measures in terms of absolute units. Examples of the forms of n~conl aud computation and full abstracts of the results of the determination of the absolute Yalues of each element of tlH\ magnetic force are giYen in Mr. Sehott's report, Part I. In order b afford a ml'a11s of ··erit)·ing the rrnmJts deduced in Part 11 of' his rt>port, and to give data f«r testing any hypothe;;is, method, (lr im'P;;;tigation other than that whid1 lw bas adopte1l, Mr. Schott lias accompanied this paper with the hourly record of the nnifilar magnetometer during the seven years, 188:..l to 188\1, ai-; read from the phot,ographic traceK. For the fir;:;t year, October, 1882, to October, 11~83, the period of this record coincides with the period of International Polar Researcli, aud 8l10111d therefore he n·ganled a;,; an extra-polar coutrilmtion thereto.

In a paper which a1ipearr,; ai,; Appernlix No. 1::: to this HJlnml', Mr. Charlc's Il. Kummell, of the Computing Division, de-rnlops a short method of 1lcducing the probable error of an obserYatiou from a series of residuals. Tl1e rigorous 1m1tl1(1(l, e8pceially wlwre there are a great nmnber of observations, th·mands, he thiukH, far too much work in proporti011 to the value of the quantity, and by limiting the pro1·es«;; to a few Yalnes from the largPst residna18, wliieh should be correctly combined for a final value, he slwws that results are reached differing· hut Yery little from those of the longer rnetbrnl. J\fr. Kummetl shows also that a fair value of the probable error can b('. obtained by one form of using his m1ithod which does not re11uire a. knowlrnlgp, of the residuals.

Ju Appem1ix No. 14- illr. ,John T. Ilayfonl, of the Tidal Division, Coast and Gl'Odetic SurYey Office, presents the results of a, preliminary investigation of a metlwd of predicting currents based upon a reference of their times of occurrence to the predicted times of high and Joi\· water instead of to the times of moon's transit as hitherto in general use. ~faterial for the discus;;;ion was deri,·ed from the obsen·ations of currents which have accumulated in the archives of the Survey during the past ·1i3 years. It is thought that the systematic pm<lictiou of currents will be greatly aided by the general adoption of this method, especially if it should be found practicable to obtain loug series of observations at or in the vicinity of the leading seaports of the United States.

EXPLANATION OF ESTIMATES.

!Sf·~,

The estimateR ;mbmitted to the Secretary of tlle Treasur,Y for the fiscal year ending .Tnne 30, were accompauie(I by the following statement:

I>. 0., September :m, 1890. Srn: I have the hon.or to submit herewith estimates of the appropriations required for the Coast and Geodetic SurTL'.\ for the fiscal year erl(ling .Jnne :)O, 1892. The items antler the head of "Party expcmms" differ in some particulars from those euumerated in the act makiug appropriations for the year ernling .T nne :m, 18!'1, completed work bei11g omitted, of cours<', arul new localitie" rlesignate<l. In some cases paragraphs hitherto se1mrated have been con;;olillated, for the purpm;e of greater economy in the expenditure of the sums appropriate·l. 'fhe total ;;uu1 1~stimate1l for "Party exvenses" differs but liHle, however, from that appropriate<l for the presPnt tiscal ,Year. The amounts estimated for under the heads "Pay of ]!'iPld OJJ:icers" and "Pa;r of Otnce Forcr'' are identical with those provided in the aet appropriatiug for the fiscal year en1li11g .Jnue :rn, l8fJl. Under the bead of "Office Expenses" the amount estimated in the second p;iragraph is greater than the current appropriation by $4,500. It iwthis item which furnishes all supplies of copper-plate, cliart paper, photolithograpbing, and all extra engraving, printing from stone, etc., and tlie appropriations for several years have been entirely inadequate, rec1uiring large deficiency appropriations each .year. \Thile tbe output of clrnrts has greatly increa.sed dming· the p;1st few years, the amount rcgularl.r appropriated under this item has not grow u with the demand, but it is believed that the amount now asked for will, by careful expenditure, enable us to escape a deticienc.v. The grand total of the regular estimates is i;ensibly the same as that of the current appropriation. A special e>;timate is submitted, Jwwever, for pro'i'iding the additional facilities for chart printing whicll a.re now so imperatively denm1Hled. During the year 1886 the number of charts issued was about 28,000; during the present year it will reach nearly 70,0~. In this time there has been no increase in our facilities fo1· chart printing, so that eYen with the most i-;treuuous efforts we are now entirely unable to meet the demands made upon us. On June 30 there were on file orders for over a thousand charts of seyenty different kinds, which could not be filled owing to our inadequate printing facilities. The demaurl for charts is constantly growing. The number supplied to sale agents has increased more than 100 per cent. during the past 5 years. 'rhe gr1~\\t. incrnase in the demand. for onr publications is also shown in the increase of the number of noticPs to mariners from !es,:; than 7,000 to ahnnt 138,000 within the last 5 years, and this goes to show that the demand for charts iR likely to increase considerably within the next few years. The appropriation of the comparatively srrwll sum of $15,000 asked for to enlarge our capacity in that direction can hanlly be dela.)·ed louger. With tlie relief which this will afford we shall doubtless be able to meet the demand for se,·cral years to come. In addition to tlte estimates of experulitures on account of the Uoast and Geodetic Survey, I transmit also au estimate for the expenses of tlw Otlice of Uonstruction of Standard Weights and Measures for the fiscal year emling .Tune 30, I Em2. The itorni;; of this estimate are the same as those appropriatecl for the curreut fiscal year, with the exception of that providing for the expenses of the attendauce of the .American mem her of the Interriational Committee on Weights and l\leasures at the general conference provided for in the convention signed l\lay 20, 1875, which was estimated for but not included in the act for the preRent fiscal year, and of the item for sahuy of one messenger at $7!!0 per a11unm, whose senice8 are urgently 11eedet1.

Continuation of rtconnai8.rnnec and triangulation over the St. Croix River and the Boundary Lakes to a connection 1dth the Xorthca.~tern Rmtndriry Survey at its Initial Monument.-The connection of the primary triaugulation near the Bay of Fundy with the Initial Monument of tlte Northeastern Bouu<lary Sun·ey at the source of tl1e St. Croix l{iver was accomplished by Assistant C. H. Boyd d11ri11g" the summer a111l autumn of 1889. Having orµ;anized his party nuder instructions daterl towards the enrl of .June, Mr. Boyd took up the triangulation about the 11th of' ,July from tlte limits of his work of the preceding season near the south end of Grand Schoodic Lake. The signal:,; erected on the upper St. Croix during the last season were inspected an<l adj11sted to gna,rd against displacements caused by the winter gales; a reconnaissance for additional stations was carrietl to the Brmnda,ry Monument, ren new signals were put up, and lines of sight opened preparatory to measurements of angles. In the search for the Boundary )fo1rnment arnl for the stations and marks used on the Boundary l.ine, ;\Jr. Boyd was compelled to rely chiefly on information derived from common report, the only map available being on a. scale too sma.ll to identify the main features of the conutry. The Monument was found secured to a bowlder which lies in swampy ground on the town lines of Amity, Maine, amt Richmond, New Brunswick, aboat half a mile south from the road between tl1e post-offices of Amity and Monument Settlement. It i.~ of cast iron, in three sections, aud owing to the sinking of the bowlder into tile swamp, tile Monument was seen to be out of

pla.mb, its apex with reference to the center of its base being six-tenths of a foot too far to the l!Ollth, and 1 foot too far west.. Mr. Chades Trail, a resident of the neighborhood, was present when the Monument was set, and assured Mr. Boyd that it was then perfectly plumb. On its north side was the inscription "Treaty of Washington," and on its south side "Boundary, August 9, 1842;" on the east and west sides were the names of the Commissioners. Height of Monument, 9.8 feet; ba.al, 1.2 feet square. The trees about it are from 50 to 75 feet in height. Over the middle point of its base a signal 72 feet high was plumbed, and the Monument was thus connected with the triangulation. The line was then opened northward until it paased over the eastern side of Pole Hill, where, it was thought, the party recovered the transit station <JCCllpied by Maj. Jitmes D. Graham, U.S. Topographical Engineers, in 1842. Thence the line .was cut open to Monument No. 2 1 and the distance measured with steel tape. Four stations were occupied on the United States side, four on the Canadian side, and two nearly upon the line, ten in all, thus completing the connection with the Initial Monument. The points selected for stations were in most cases tbe summits of the highest hills and mountains. Up these elevations, which were all covered with hard-wood timber, the party cut pathways, and opened lines from the summit to the several points in the scheme of work. The signals were built of spruce and cedar trees cut in the lowlands. To mark the station points a hole was drilled in a ledge or bowlder, and a triangle cnt into the stone around it. Mr. Boyd suggests that in addition to-this marking it would be well to have the stone dressed down immediately about the station mark, and the name of the station and the year of its occupation cut thereon. Heights were determined at the water line in each of the Lakes, at the head of Boundary Brook, and on the St. Croix River below the Lower Lake. A reconnaissance along the Boundary Line for some 25 miles north of the Monument was made in October to ascertain the condition of th" marks originally put down. These were iron posts, 2g inches square at top and 4: feet long. But few of them could be found; the thick underbrush effectually hid them, and the location of many of them was unknown to the peo11Je of the vicinage. Mr. Boyd suggest.a that, in view of the commercial interests clemanding a careful mark. ing of this border line, the triangulation be continued northward to the St. John River, to the point where that river becomes the International Boundary, ancl that a strip of land ten metres (nearly 33 foot) wide for the entire length of the Line and. adjacent to it in Maine should be set apart to join a similar strip in ;few Brunswick, and the Line marked perm~nently by suitable monuments. · Field work was closed November 6.

proooeded to V aneeboro, Me., abont the middle of that month to <>rganize a party for the t.er tiary triangulation of the Scho<>dic Lakes. Between June 14 and the end of the fiscal year the time was occupied in getting t<>gether boats, working materials and signal lumber, hiring men, reconnaissance and signal building, a.nll cutting lines of sight. Rain on 9 days during this Jleriod somewhat retarded progress. The signal at Mount Henry was rebuilt and a signal erected at Vaneeboro. · Further progress will be stated in the next Annual Report.. Work executed by Mr. Hergesheimer on the Delaware River in 1889 and in Florida. in 1889-'90 is referred to under headings in Sections II and VI. Topographic and hydrographic survey of the St. Croix River from tlte vicinity of Va1t-0eboro, Me., to the southzcard.-For the further prosecution of the survey of St. Croix River and in continuance of work begun in 1889 by the late Assistant C. M. Bache, Subassistant J. A. Flemer was instructed,· under date of May 17, 1890, to proceed to Vanceboro, Me., and take np the topography of the head waters of the St. Croix and to locate as accurately as possible the threa<l of the stream, bearing in mind its importance as an Inttirnational boundary line. Upon arriving at Vanceboro, June 2, Mr. Flemer reconnoitered a part of the river below that town, an<l fountl it more serpentine in its course than he had expected. He decided, therefore, in accorda.nce with suggestions contained in his instructions, to run a traverse line from station Elbow Ripps to Earing's on a scale of 1-40000, using for this purpose the unfinished sheet of Mr. C. M. Bache's survey from Vanceboro to lfoPhail's Rolling Tier. As the river was found to have many characteristic featnres due to numerous rapids (ripps) alternating with stretches of deep and gently flowing water, to many islands with abutments and wingdams, and to ledges, numerous rocks, and bowlders, it wa.s deemed advisable to plot the topographical survey on a scale of 1-10000, and to obtain thereby a series of detailed charts showing the thread of the St. Croix or continuous line of deepest water as obtained by soundings. The chain of plane-table stations on these detail charts forms in its continuity an independent traverse line, which, as it has some points in common with the 1-40000 traverse, gives a certain check on the later, and will also facilitate the reduction of the topography to the scale of 1-40000. From June 3 to 15 the party was occupied in reconnaissance, procuring camp outfit, boat, and two ca.noes, in hiring boat and ax-men, and in moving downstream to McPhail's Rolling Tier, where the first camp was pitched. On June 23 the party moved camp to Duck Point. Mr. Flemer will report further on the progress of his survey at the close of the season. Messrs. Seymour P. Bradley and William B. Paca served in the party as rodmen and general assistants. Topographic anil hydrographia survey of the St. Oroix River from Vanceboro to the sou.thwa.rd.The survey of the St. Croix River on both sides of the International boundary line from Vanceboro, Me., to the southward was taken up t<>wards the end of July, 1889, by Assistant Charles M. Bache, under instructions dated July 15. For this work Mr. Bache was furnished with a pro· jection ou a scale of 1-40000. · Mr. Bache reports that many difficulties were encountered in exeenting the survey owing to the nature of the ground, the heavily wooded character of the co11ntry, and the lack of triangnla· tion points. At Vanceboro the Maine Central Railroad crosses the St, Croix into Canada. About this town and the Canadian village of St. Croix, immediately opposite, there was an inconsiderable portion of open country, extending nearly two-fifths of a. mile down the river on the Canadian side and about three-fourths of a mile on the American side. The roads were of a kind that did not favor rapid progress. On the Canadian side a trail through the woods passed on in the direction of the river; on the America.a side a road existed which extended a little over 3 miles to two small farms but partly cleared. Stations were occupied on eaeh bank of the river, using a. eaooe for transportation:; these crossings iu vol ved in ea.ch case the ta.king of the sheet f.rom the board of the plane table an4 t8e board from the legs. The river contained many rapids a.ndjams of logs. Lines of soondingswe.re run and soundings taken with as mnch care as practicable. The stage of w~ ill the river was observed twice a day for thirty-five days.

Field operations were closed September 21.

Top<>gra.pkic tm<l hydro{fi'apkitJ sut"vey of the St. Oroire .River from Calais to Bahng and above.Instructions issued to Assistant Eugene Ellicott towards the end of June, 1889,and supplemented by more detailed instructions issu.ed a month later, directed him to make a topographical survey of a very precise character of the St. Croix River between Calais and the great bend of the river above Baring, and to carry the survey up the River to a point above Sprague's Falls. He was also to define the axis of the stream, or the line of greatest deptb, which forms the boundary between the State of Maino and the Province of New Brunswick, making soundings systematically both over the tidal area and that above the reach of the tide. All heights for topographical contours were to be referred to mean high water at Calais, and a gauge for the purpose of recording the tlnctnations iu river depth was to be established at or near Baring. For the execution of this work Mr. Ellicott was provided with a projection, scale 1-10,000. He ha.s submitted au elaborate descriptive report to accompany his topographical antl hydrographieal sheet, and both sheet and report have been deposited in the archives. The report discusses at some length the historic origin and significance of local names in the area under Hurvey ; gives the dates of town settlements; compares hi!I own determinations of heights of points on the river with those given by Walter Wills, formerly in charge of the State Hydrographic Survey; describes the location of towns ; states the means of communication and the facilities of tra Vfll, the general character of the geological formations and of the forest and fruit trees; gives the statistics of the work, and con· eludes with a .statement of the need of a survey made with great elaboration to serve as a basis for establishing and marking de.finitely the bollUdary line between Maine and New Brunswick.

Oompletion of t1111,.finisheil topographical t.eork on the coast of Jlailie in the vicinity of Oobsaook Bay, a?lii impection of topographical BU'NlC1fB in that vicinity and to the eastward and n-0rtliward.-In order to complete certain unfinished area.a of topography lying between the surveys executed by Assistants O. M. Bache and .E. Ellicott and Aid J. H. Grny on the coast of Maine in the vicinity of Oobscook Bay and to the eastward and northward, .Assistaut John W. Donn was instructed, towards the end of Jnne,1889, to proceed to that locality and organize a party to fill the gaps then existing. In oonnootton with this work he was directed also to make careful inspection of the topogra.phical surveys executed by the above-named ofl:lcers in the years 1885 to 1889, and to include in this inspection the ~pographical recounaissance ma.de for military purposes by Assistant W. II. Dennis in the yellrs 1861 and 1862. On his way to the tield Hr. Donn k!topped a'! Portland, .Me., for the purpose of consultation with Assistant O. H. Boyd regarding the proposed extension of topographical work on the Bound·

20

ary line between Maine and New Brunswick from the Schoodic Lakes to the Boundary Monument. This consultation was supplemented by an examination made by Mr. Donn of the topography of the country about the Boundary Line, and a special report on the subject was made by him towards the end of June. He then took up field work on tlie shore of Passamaquoddy Bay, near Perry Harbor or Little River, and closed the gap l;yiug between the work of Assistant Dennis (1865) and Assistant 0. M. Bache in 1888, at the same time inspecting the work of each as to shore line and geueral details of inland topography. The work to the northwest was then advanced between the lines of Assistants C. M. Bache aud Ellicott, the work of the former extending up the highland. adjacent to the Passamaquoddy to Lewis's Cove at North Perry, and that of the latter to the Iron Mills Mountain near the foot of Pemmanaqua11 Lake. This area, covering about 15 square miles, contained comparatively few artificial details, and was, in part, heavily covered with timber of recent growth. Mach of it was difficult of access on account of burnt and fallen trunks of trees intermingled with the new growth on the sides of ledges, and the dense mass of bushes filling the marshy ravines. This work was finished by the 5th of August, on which date Mr. Donn transferred his party to the town of Lubec, near which were two uncompleted areas; one lying upon the eastern side of Seward's Neck (North Lubec), and the other bounded by two areas of work executed by Assistant Ellicott in 1886 ancl 1887. While engaged upon the survey in these localities, and during the occupancy of several stations overlooking the Lubec Narrows, Mr. Donn determined the position of the Light-house then in course of construction. On the .5th of September, Mr. Donn found it desirable to transfer his base of operations to the towns of DennyRville and Whiting, the former being the most available point for the continuation of the work of filling gaps in topography, and the latter for the inspection of the surveys made by Assistant Ellicott and Aid Gray in 1887 and 1888. In general the face of the countl'y presented features of a character similar to that surveyed during the earlier part of the season. Bold, high, rocky ledges jutted out amidst dense thickets of alder, birch, spruce, and fir, which covered extensive valleys of a swampy character. The ledges were ge'.lerally occupie<l as stations, and their heights above the adjacent valleys and the seashore determined. The western part of the work laid between :;\fr. Ellicott's survey of 1887 and Mr. Gray's of 1888. It was completed by the 10th of October, after which the inspection of the general field covered by the sun'eys of those officers occupied Mr. Donn till October 14, at which date he transferred bis party to Calais. From this point the surveys of .Assistant Longfellow, between Devin's Head to Robbinstou, and of .Assistant 0. M. Bache from Robbinston to North Perry were inspected, and field operationH were then closed. Mr. Donn bas communicated in rnuch detail to the Superintendent the results of his topographical inspections, and the suggestions he makes will be given careful consideration. For his own surveys he reports the following statistics: Topography: Number of miles of shore line surveyed ..· _...............................

During the early part of the winter Mr. Donn was engaged in office work, and in January, 1800, received orders for duty in the vicinity of Norfolk, Virginia, reference to which will be made under a heading in Section III. Examination of cha'lf,f}es for additionB of topographical details to the shore lines of tlte Ken1iebec River from Bath to Gardiner.-In order to obtain data needed to publish a chart of the Kennebec River brought up to date, from Bath, Maine, to the bridge at Gardiner, it became necessary to detail an officer to make additions of topographical detailB to the topographic sheets of that river executed in the years 1858 to 1860 and 1869-'70. Instructions were accordingly issued to Assistant H. L. Whiting, February 15, 1890, to proceed to Eath, ta.king with bim the original sheets, and to note on them such wharves, ice houses, etc., as had been built along the liver, and also to supply any names of towns, villages, islands, ete., that might be wanting.

Upon reaching Bath, early in March, and finding the conditions there not very favorable for field work, Mr. Whiting changed his location to Gardiner, and from that town as headquarters he carried the work .over the two upper sheets of the survey of 1869-'70. In executing this work entire reliance had to be placed upon the original topography, execnte<l by the party in charge of Assistant 0. Il. Boyd. The lapse of time, 20 antl 21 years, since the surveys were made had obliterated all surface indications of the original triangulation stations, and the snow covering the frozen ground made it impracticable to search for underground marks. It became necessary, therefore, to use such points as the topography furnished, lwnses and otller conspicuous objects, for fixing the stations upon which the determination of the new featnres could be based. There were, however, some localiti~s near the city of Gardiner and the village of Richmond where the church spires of these i1taces were available. Mr. Whiting observes that it is not customary nor even practicable iu ordiuars topographical surveys to fix each house with enough accuracy t(l make it a trustworthy base point, allll that it becomes necessary, therefore, in selecting such objects as will prod nee good results to make differential tests that tax both the time and judgment of the surveyor. Ile expresses his gratification at having found the original work essentially good, most of the conspicuous houses, and even barns, having been determined with care and accuracy. He was surprised at the closeness with which the positions of almost every ice house agreed with the details of the shore topography, particularly when it was considered that their details were fixed from entirely independent bases. Below the Gardiner bridge Mr. Whiting determined in position for delineation on the topographical sheets forty-one ice houses, witll au aggregate capacity of 1,076,00() tons. All of the principal wharves on the river W(}re also added to the sheets. No personal examination of the river above Gardiner was made, bnt, with the present interest in the ice question, Mr. Whiting deeme<l it worth while to obtain an approximate statement of the resources of that part of it, as follows: On the west bank of the river between the Gardiner bridge aud the dam, at Augusta, nine ice houses with a storage capacity of 2 02,000 tons, and on the east bank between the same limits four ice houses with a capacity of 101,000 tons. Immediately after the completion of the work on the upper part of the river, Mr. Whiting proceeded to Bath, where be began field operations March 17, aud closed them March 21. During this time he made a careful revision of the wharf Jine, examining each pier and dock along the city front, a distance of about 4 miles. He observes that the changes which have occurred along this line since the original survey of 1859-'60 are not co11siderable or important, and do not affect the navigable freedom of the river or the approaches to the cit,y wharves. The most characteristic change is in tlie :tilling up of some of the old docks and l:msins; the most marked change is that of the terminal grounds of the railroad. It was not practicable to make stations for plane table use on the water front, each pier end being occupied by large vessels loading with ice, but by careful reference and measurements to the details of the former survey, the new features were put as nearly in I)1ace as the scale woulcl allow. The most considerable advance of the wbarf line of the city into the river channel was found to occur at the new landing pier of the Kennebec and Boston Steamboat Company. A satisfactory station was made at this point, which controlled not only that pa1·ticular wharf, but the outer alignment of many of the wharves to the north and south of it. Mr. Whiting in closing his report refers to tlie very close and accurate character of the origin al survey which was made by Assistant R. Meade Bache in the years 1858-1860, and but for which he could not have accomplished th~ revision he made within the time and by the methods which he fo11nd sufileient for the purpose. The original sheets with the additions have been returned to tbe office.

Whiting bas submitted a general report of the serviees performed by him during the fiscal year. In the earlier part of the year he made inBpectiollS of the work 'of topographical parties on the Massachusetts coast, and continued to

supervise the town boundary work in Massachusetts as one of the Commissioners of the Topographical Survey of the State. Iu October he was called to Washingt;op. and instructed to examine and make a final award respecting the portion of boundary line in dispute between the States of Maryland and Virginia. Reference to this duty will be found under the head of "Special Operations," and Mr. Whiting's report in regard to it is published as Appendix No. 11 to this volume. Returning to Ma..<isachnsetts towards the encl of November, Mr. Whiting's service was almost wholly given to the State Commission in conducting the closing operations of the sea.son's field surveys, in preparing the anmial report of the Oomrnission, and in rnak ing projects for future work on which State appropriations for the succeeding year were to bee based. In Febrnary, 1\Ir. Whiting took up under instr~ctions an examination of the shores of the Kennebec River between Bath and Gardiner. Details of this work are given under·the preceding heading. Towards the end of March he proceederl to Washington, having been directed to examine and report upon the condition of the topography of the Atlantic coast. Tb.e time available for this work permitted only a review of that part of the coast from the eastern boundary to Delaware Bay. Mr. \Vhiting submitted-eight separate reports on this subject, accompanied by pwjects for futuro field surveys with estimates of their cost. Under date of June 10, Mr. Whiting reooived from the President of the United States his appointment as a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and was duly qualified. At the close of the fiscal year he was oooupied with the work of the Massachusetts State Survey, and with studies relating to the Mississippi River. Determinations of town bot~ndaries in the State of Massachusetts continued.-The work of determining in geographical position the comers of t;own boundaries in the State of Massachusetts was in progress at the beginning of the fiscal year in the immediate charge of Assistant C. H. Van Orden. As stated in the last annual report, he took the field in the town of Bridgewater, May 13, 1889. The general plan of the work was that followed in previous seasons: observations upon a town corner from stations of the old triangulation, making it when practicable a point in a triangle, but when not, to determine a point as near as possible to the corner and run a carefully measured traverse to it and determine its azimuth. These traverses were often measured with a rod, partic· ularly when the surface of the gromul was much broken, the angles of elevation and depression being observed, and care taken to have sufficiently short sights. This method, Mr. Van Orden thinks, is, on rough ground, one more rapid, more accurate, and more easily checked than chaining. From the town of Bridgewater the work was carried to tho eastward to join work already completed along the coast, and westwardly to the Rhode Island line. As the season advanced one section of the party moved to the town of \Vbitman, a.ud the other section to Attleborough. The towns of wbich the boundaries were determined were sixteen in number; namely, Hanmrnr, Pembroke, Ilanson, Halifax, Plympton, East Bridgewater, Whitman, Abington, Uocklaud, West Bridgewater, Bridgewater, Easton, Mansfield, Norton, North Attleborough, and Attleborough. These include all of the towns along and on the southerly side of the Ohl Colony Line, as it i8 called, which extends in substantially a atr~ight course between Scituate and Cohasset to the Uhode Island line, between Attleb()rongh and Wrentham. Mr. Van Orden's work was conducted, as in previoM seasons, under the general direction of the Commissioners of the Topographical Survey of the State of Massachusetts, these Commissioners being General Francis A. Walker, President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Henry L. ·whiting, Assistant U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard University. In the report of these Oommissioners for 1889, made to the Governor of Massachussetts, they state that it is mainly through the aid of the Coast and Geodetic Survey that the town boundary work bas been carried on; that they have receive(l from that department the expert personal service of members of its corps, the use of costly instruments, and tile advantage of ca.reflrtly prepa.red forms for observations, computations, a.nd records. They ookllowledge, also, the V4!JrY liberal spirit which has been manifested by the various

railrond officials of the State, particularly by President Choate of the Old Colony road, in giving the fullest facilities of transportation to the Commission and to the field parties of the survey, whenever their work has called them over their lines. Mr. Van Orden expresses his obligations to the foremen in his party, Mr. Joseph B. Tolle;y and Mr. E. E. Peirce, for zealous and skillful service throughout the season. Field operations were closed November 22. The statistics of the work are as follows:

This work consisted in making a preliminary computation of the geographical positions of all the points determined, and in duplicating tlie records of observation aud the descri1ftions of stations. As about one-thiru of the stations were occupied eccentril:ally, this added largely to the time and labor of computation. About the middle of May, Mr. Van Ordeu was instructed to resume field work under tlte general direction of Assistant \Vhiting. A careful reconnaissance was taken up without delay in the towns of Lakeville, Freetown, Dighton, H.eboboth, Taunton, Raynham, Middleborough and Carver, and at the close of the fiscal year the town boundary survey was in active progress.

Physical kydrograpliy.-Oontinuation of tfi,e physical survey of tke coast of Oape Ood Peninsula.At the begiunin!{ of the fiscttl ;year the party which had been organized by Assistant H. L. l\iarindin for tho continuation of the physical survey of the coast of Cape Cod Peninsula was in camp at High Head in the town of Truro, that having been their headquarters since the date of beginning field operations, May 20. The part of the coast line which bad been examined since that date was comprised between Oape Ood Light·House and Peaked Hill Life.Saving Station. This work was carried on under instructions prepared in extension of the plan outlined in the memorandum of 1887 drawn up by the Chief of Physical Hydrograph;r, and the observations included measurements of the coast line in cross-section from points far enough inland to determine the nature of the barrier to the sea, and extending seaward to a depth of 36 feet. These crosssectfons will, it is believed, offer the best means of determining the waste uf the shores by comparison with previous and future surveys. The cross-sections were joined by lines of precise leveling-, and tidal stations and numerous bench marks established as the work advanced. Topographical surveys were made of those parts of the coast soowing ma.rked changes since the surveys of former years; notably of that portion of the Cape situated between High Head and Provincetown, where a large area of salHrnter and salt-marshes has been changed to a fresh-water pond mid meadow lands b~' the closing of the inlet from Oape Ood Bay into this "East Harbor/' as it was once calle<l. A plane table sheet (sea.le 1-10000) delineating these changes will h·~ sent to the Archives with the field-records. The ltydrograpbie sutve,ts wiU be comprised in two sheets, ea.eh on a. sea.le of 1-10000, which will ooo.tain the ~& of the shore and t.he water contours to 36 feet in depth.

These sheets join those completed the year before at Highland Light-house, and inclnlle the distance arouml the west eml of Cape Cod to Long Point Light-house. Within these limits one hundred aud seventy-two cross-sections were measured, averaging about 150 metres (!92 feet) apart. From a preliminary comparison of the results derived from the cross-sections with the published charts, it is quite evident that some shoals exist which are not on the charts, and that others have changed position or entirely disappeared. Information having been receh-ed from Mr. William Holden, of High Head, Truro, that owing to a break in the blnfI-line made by wind aml waves somewhere in the vicinity of the Peaked Hill lifo-sa\·ing station, the Light-house at Loug Point had become visible over the land to vessels }}assing along the outside or uorth shore of the cape, a comparison was made with Assistant Whitillg's survey of 1848, and the position of tlle brcllk illentified. A Notice to Mariners relative to this was sltortl.r after publisLed. A plane-table determination was made of Highland, High Hea<l, Peaked Hill, and Crow Hill life-saving stations. Two of these statious were found to have shifted position since the previous detcrmiuation, and the charts have been corrected accordingly. Mr. .:\larindin llad the aid of Messrs. E. E.

After closing field operations Mr. Mariudin proceeded under instructions to Washington, and reported for duty at tlie Office, where he took up the relluctfou and discussion of his observations. In this work he had the assistance of Messrs. Haskell and Ritter, who reported at the Ufllce October 1. From this date until !fay, 1890, with some interruptions for special duty, the pa1·ty was engaged on unfinished computations of physical bydrographic.work. In December, 1859, Mr. Ritter was detailed for topographical service on the New York City Front, a report of which will be found under a heading in Section II. He was again detailed for field service in Febrmuy, 1890, and ordered to join the party of Assistant Welker in Flori<la. Towards the end of March he resumed otlice duty. In April, Mr. Marindin was instructed to make a hydrographic examination in the Potomac Uiver. An abstract of his report of this service is given under a heading in &>ction III. In May he submitte(l a special report on cross-sections of the shore of Cape Cod between Chatham and the Highland Light-house; this was published as Appendix: No. 13 to the Report for 1889. n a vi II g- received instructions bearing date of May 13, 1890, to organize his party for continuing physical hydrographic work on Cape Cod and on the island of Nantucket, Mr. Ma.rind.in took up preparations for field work. His departure from Washington was temporarily delayed in order to prepare for the Snpetintendent a report on the progress of the phy~ical hydrographic work of the Survey, to do which it was necessary to consrllt the aa.nnal reports a11d other documents as far back as the year 1864. · ·

Mr. Haskell was detached about this time and ordered to special service on Long Island Sound, reference to which will be found under a heading in Section II. Barly in June, Mr. Marindin, accompanied by Mr. Ritter, proceeded to Provincetown, :Mass., and on the 16th of the month were joined by Mr. F. A. Young as recorder. The field work was begun June 10. It consisted in the delineation of the topographical changes within the harbor of Provincetown; in sounding out the cross-sections, the limits of which bad been fixed during the previous season, and generally in such observations as were needed to complete the physical survey of this important harbor, and to furnish data for the publication of a new edition of its chart. This survey was finished before the end of June, and arrangements were begun to transfer the party t-0 Nantucket to continue the physical hydrograpby of the coast of Massachusetts. Following are the statistics of the Provincetown "Work: Examination of change8 in wharf line and in marsh and beach lines: Number of miles of shore line surveyed. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . 8 Number of miles of creeks surveyed ........... ,........................ 3 Area of country (approximate) in square miles.......................... 2 Hydrogra1lhy: Number of miles of cross section sounded............................... 15 Number of soundings on cross sections ...............··..··............ 1,074 One hydrographic sheet, scale 1-10000, on which the changes in topographical features were delineated, was sent to the Office. · Hydrographio resu;rveys iii Nantubket Sound and vi.cinit_y.-Reference was made in the last Annual Report to the beginning of the hydrographic resurveys in Nantucket Sound and vicinity, executed during the summer and autumn of 1889 by the party in charge of Lieut. W. P. Elliott, U. S. N., Assist ant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Ea.gre. Lieutenant Elliott's work was laid out upon three projections, one on a scale of 1-10000, including Chatham lwads and Stage Harbor; one on 1-20000, including that part of Nantucket Sound westward of Chatham Hoads to Point Gammon, and thence south ward and eastward, taking in Bishop and Clerks, Handkerchief and Shovelful Shoals, to Monomoy; and one on a scale of 1_-_20000 extending from Cape I'oge to the west end of Nantucket Island, anti including llOrtious of Muskeget Channel and the shoals and banks in the vicinity of Muskeget and Tuckcrnuck Islamls. Four descriptive reports have been submitted by Lieutenant Elliott to accompany bis hydrog1·aphic sheets. One of these is a general report, in which he reviews the hydrographic characteristics of the localities under resurvey, refers to the importance of a thorough development of the channels and a. tl1orough knowledge of the dangers that beset the throngs of coasting vessels which dot the whole ex:panse, alludes to the changes taking place in foe configuration of the shoals and to the irregular and conflicting tidal currents, and recommends as additions to or substitutes for present aids to navigation a whistling or bell buoy at the northwest corner of Handkerchief Shoal in place of black buoy No. 3, and a bell buoy in place of the small spar buoy which now mar ks the slue off Nantucket Entrance. The tidal curves at Powder Hole, l\fonomoy, at Stage Harbor, at Deunisport, at Bass River, and at Tuckernuck Island are represented graphically on a diagram accompanying this report. For each projection a separate report has been filed in the archives. Between Oape Poge and the west end of Nantucket Island there remainecl three irregularly shaped gaps in hydrography to be filled in; these were on the various shoals to the westward of Tuckernuck Shoal and north of Muskeget Island, and the work was particularly difficult from the fact that the natural objects and signals visible were few in number and at great distances. Spoofal care was taken to develop changes in the shoals, and it was found upon examination that Long and Shovelful Shoals had grown together at their southern ends, and had formed a continous bank. Details with regard to other changes observed are given in the report. The tidal station established on Tuckernuck Island in 1854: by Professor Mit.chell was re-occupied and mean sea level determined from observa.

tions of day tides during two lunar months. A second tide gauge was set up at Cape Poge, and its indications were referred to a bench-mark fixed in 1888 by Lieut. S. C. Paine, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. Sketches showing lonation of the tide guages and bench-marks are appended to the report. The two reports relating to the work at Cliatllam and Sta.go Harbor and on the north shore of Nantucket Sound are equally foll and comprehensive, aud indicate the great interest taken in the work by the chief of the µa.rts a11d the officers under his command. ln the compilation of a new edition of the Coast Pilot for the waters in this vicinity the results of these resurveys will be of special value. On October 22, Lieutenant Elliott closed work, and proceeded under instructions with the Eagre to the New York Navy-Yard. At the outset of the season, Ensign ..L. S. Van Duzer and E. A. Anderson, U. S. N., were attached to the 1mrty. On July 127 Enstgn Anderson was detached and ordered to duty in ti.le Office; Ensign Van Duzer was detached August 10, and ordered to duty in the Bureau ofNaviga. tion, Navy Department. Ensigns L. U. Bertelotte, E. H. Durell, F. H. Brown, C. M. Stone, and T. Washington, CT. S. N., reported for" duty in .July and remained until the close of the work. Lieut. .A. L. Hall, U. S. N., reported for duty Auguat 21, and on October 12 was detached and ordered to command the Coast Survey steamer Endeavor. Pay yeomen A. R. Hasson and Irving King sernd as draftsmen and recorders. The general zeal and interest in the work displayed liy both officers and men gave great satisfaction to their commander.

Continuation of the offshore hydrography soutli of Nantucket Mid Martha's Vineyard.-Upon returning from a successful season's work on the coast of Florida towards the end of May, 1889, Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Bache, was instructed t0 put the vessel in condition and make all needed preparations for th.e res11mption, at the earliest date practicable, of the coast and offshore hydrography to the southward of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. This was an extension of the work begun by Lieutenant Moser in the summer of 1887 at Point Judith, aml carried to the eastward during the summer of 1888. The projectiou upon which work was begun early iu July, 1889, extended from No Mau's Laud to Sankaty Head. Scale 1-40000. \York was also prosecuted as opportunity served, on a i)rojection, scale, 1-20000, covering an area on the south coast of Nantucket from Surfside lite-saving station to the westward. The system of lines adopted for tne ,devAlopment of the hydrography was similar to that of preceding seasons, viz, lines normal to the coast ew1ry half mile for a distance of 6 or 7 miles, and thence normals every mile to the limit of work to sea.ward. This system is then crossed by lines half a mile apa.rt for a distance of 6 or 7 miles from the shore, and thence seaward the cross lines are gradually c;pread, until at the sea.ward limit, where they are l~ miles apart. The boat system connecting the shore line with the ship varies as the formation demands. Where the shore line was bold, a simple system of connecting traverses was deemed sufficient~ but in the vicinity of shoals and inlets a more thorough development was aimed at. Lieutenant Moser reports that the season was .au exceptionally unfavorable one, and that the most unremitting effort to complete the work was <>f no avail under the adverse conditions that pre. va.iled. The weather was decidedly rainy, and when it did not rain it either blew a. gale of wind or tlib atmosphere was thick with fog or haze. Day after day the Baclie steamed outside without getting a cast of the lead. It wa.'I found impossible to do offshore ship work successfully where the signals could not be seen at least 8 miles. The work was at a long distance from port, ,about 35 mUes from any shelter, and sueh a. harbor

a.a could be made was either tllrough Muskeget Channel, or between Old Man and Bass Rip Shoals, neither of which could be used at night, and both are treacherous and dangerous even to those acquainted with the locality. Another drawback to progress this season was that a system of signals had to be maintained over a coast line of 40 miles, and the frequent wrecking of these signals by gales of wind caused the party great inconvenience. Lieutenant Moser observes that this part of the coast is clear of all commerce. No vessels engaged in the carrying trade are ever found between No Man's Land and Nantucket Shoals, unless off their course. All of the coast tra.de passes inside and through the sounds, and the ocean track lies well outside. During the summer months many fishermen will be found between No Ma.n's Land and Muskeget, and some fow a short distance to the eastward, the sailing craft being generally engaged in swordfishing, and the steamers in seining menhaden. At one time, twenty-one menhaden steamers were counted in sight south of 1\fartha'ti Vineyard. With regard to the currents, Lieutenant Moser states that they vary greatly in force and direction, and that a thorough investigation of them is much to be desired. Ile calls attention to the immense number of Physalia atl,a,ntica (Portuguese men-of-war) which during the summer, in fine weather, fairly covered the loca.lities of his surveys, aml which, since they come to life a.ml mature in tropical seas, must IJe carried northward by the Gulf Stream, but then the questiou constantly presented itself, how they reacheil the waters off the south coa.stsof Nautncketaml .Martha's Vineyar(l. The Gulf Stream at Hatteras t.rends to the eastward, and more to the eastwanl as a higher latitude is reached, and then the prevailing winds in summer are from .the south west. Lieutenant Moser renews the recommendations made IJy him last year for the establishment of a sea buoy at Muskeget Ohannel and the construction of a first-or<ler light-house on No Man's Land. His experience and observation during the season confirme(l to bis mind the correctness of these suggestions. While the comparatively safe inside part of Muskeget Channel is buoyed, the dangerous bar has been left unmarked. Ile maintained with difficulty a barrel buoy there all summer, and captains of fishing steamers would come to him for directions to enter. As many as thirty fishing vessels, steamers and sail craft, were seen within 6 miles of the shoals at one time. With regard to No Man's Laud he observes that a seacoast light there would be 5~ miles farther seaward than Gay Head, and that at this latter point a third or fourth order light, as a guide to the entrance to the Sound, would serve all necessary requirements. In addition to the regular work of the party an examination was made off Cape Poge, which resulted in the location and development of a rock with but 4 feet of water upon it, 1,000 yards southeast three quarters south from Cape Poge Light: Ueference is made to this rock in Notice to Mariners for August, 1889 (No. 119). Au 8-foot uncharted bovdder having been reported to the southwtist of Nobska Point, Lieutenant Moser made search in the locality and found one 8-foot bowlder and two of less depth, but according to his informant, Mr. Gifford, the one reported was farther offsl10re. i\ thorough search was then made by sounding and dragging during two days Oll all of the ranges given, and half a ·day was spent, with Mr. Gifford in the boat, without finding anything. A 1.5-fathom ledge known as Cox Ledge, supposed to lie a bont 15 miles south west. of No Man's Land, and which the lines of soundings run the preceding season did not indicate, was again lookerl for without success. To obtain a plane of reference for the soundings, a tide gauge was established at No l\fan'$ Land, and referred to a well-known bench-mark on a rock near by. The height of this bench-mark above the plane of mean low water, as furnished by the Office, was uscfl to determine the constant for the correction of the tide-gauge readings. Special care having been taken to secure this gauge in position it remained 1mdisturbed duting the entire season, notwithstanding the many violent gales. Tide gauges were located also at Wood's Iloll and Uncatena Island. The following-named officers were attached to the Bache: Ensigns H. A. Bispham, R. D. Tisdale, S. M. Strite, L. C. Bertolette, and W. S. Cloke, U. S. N.; Passed Assistant Surgeon J. 1\1. Steele, U. S. N., and Passed Assistant Engineer E. H. Scribner, U. S. N. Messrs. George R. Jones and J. L. Di.mu served as recorders. Ensign Bispham, under Lieutenant Moser's direction, had charge of the tide gauges and gave careful attention to the observations.

Report cf this service will be found under a heading in Section VI. Completion of the topographical resurvey of Wood's Holl and vicinity.-Under instructions dated towards the end of .June, 1889, Assistant W. I. Vinal was directed to resume his topographical resurve:}'S in Wood's Holl and vicinity from the limits of his work of the previous season. Arriving at the locality July 5, Mr. Vinal immediately organized his party, put up the necessary signals, and began field operations. The characteristic features of the area under resurvey in Wood's Holl and vicinity, and on the islands of Nonamesset., Naushon, and Uncatena, were village and county detail; cultivated, cpen, and densely wooded land; underbrush, salt and fresh marsh; wooded swamps and cran· berry bogs; rocky shore line; contours, bluffs, and escarpments. Scale of resurvey 1-5000, con· toured to every 10 feet of elevation, and showing terminal 5-foet curves. Tracings of shore line and positions of objects on sllore were furnished to Lieut. J. F. Moser, U.S. N., .A.ssistant Ooast and Geodetic Survey, in charge of the bydrographic party on the steamer Bache. Field operations were closed November 5.

Toyograph ical re.mrvey of the Elizabeth Islands, between Buzzard's Bay and Vineyard Sound, and of the Woepccket Isla1ids, Buzzard's Bay.-The topographical resurveys assigned to the charge of Snbassistaut E. L. Taney by instructions dated May 30, 1889, included a resurvey of the Elizabeth Islands off the coast of 1\fassachusetts to a junction with the work of .Assistant Vinal, near Wood's Holl, and a resurvey of the three small islands oftbe Woepecket group in the southeastern part of Buzzard's Bay. Reference was made in the last Annual Ueport to the beginning of this work on Cuttyhunk Island, .June 8. The resurvey of this island was made on a scale of 1-5000 (12.67 inches to the statute mile), and contour lines were run for every 10 feet of elevation. The islands of Penikese, Nashaweua, and I·asque, were resurveyed on a scale of 1-10000, and the shore line of Naushon Island delineated from the west end to the limits of Mr. Vinal'1:1 survey. Naushon Island is thickly wooded, and time was not available for a detailed survey of the interior. This, Mr. Taney recommends, should be done in the early spring before the trees and undergrowth are in leaf. Much difficulty was experienced owing to the prernlo.·nce of fog during June antl July, and from many sernre storms of long duration during the rest of the season, Since not more than one station point could be recoverell or any one of the islands, a plane-table triangulation was found necessary to ftlrnish enough points to complete the work.

Establishment of a trial course o.ff' the coasts of Block Island and Loitg Island for the speed tests of the new naval war vessel Philadelphia.- Under the heading of Special Operations, towards the close of Part; II of this volume, is given an abstract of the report of Lieut. Charles E. Vreeland, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Blake, to whom, in compliance with a request of the Secretary of the Navy, and with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, was 'assigned the duty of laying off a trial course for the speed tests of the new armored cruiser, Philadelphia. Projections covering the locality finally selected, off the south coasts of Block Island and Long Island, were furnished to Lieutenant Vreeland, and by the aid of these, upon which were plotted the points of triangulation already determined on those coasts, he was Einabled to locate accurately the needed range marks. For details, see the abstract of bis report. The Blake was occupied in this service between May 17 and June 10, 1890. Duty in the exploration of the Gulf Stream executed by Lieutenant Vreeland duriug the winter of 1889-'90, is referred to under a heading in Section VI. Observations in pft,ysiaal hydrograpky on Long Island Sound in connection icit!i the surre.11 of the U.S. Fish Commission in those 1oaters.-An opportunity having been afforded hy tllc crnise of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Fisk Hawk, in Long Island Sound and adjacent wi1ters, in the season of 1890, for prosecuting certain important investigations in physical hydrograplly, Mr. E. E. Haskell, expert observer, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was directed to report in person to Mr. Richard Rathbun, in charge of the scientific imestigations of the Commission, who would assign him quarters on the l!i&h Hawk, Lieut. Robert Platt, U.S. N., oommanding. Boats and crews with

a number of observers were to be furnished from the steamer when required for the observations. Tllese were to consist of: (1) Tide observations at tbree points on the shores of tile Sound, preferably at Willets Point, at ~ew llaveu, and at or near New London, the tidal record to be obtained by means of automatic gauges. ('.!) Obserrntions of currents, to be made on each of the dumping grounds off the coast of Connecticut, and at such grounds located on the Long Island shore. Densities and temperatures were to be uote<l at the s;1me time and specimens of the bottom to he preserved. (3) Gaugings of discharge: For this puqlOse transverse sections were to be occupied with as many stations for simultaueous observations as the number of current meters wonld allow at both ends of the SoumJ, one east of the mouth of the Connecticut River, and the other in the vicinity of ]\Iatinicock Point. (4) CnrrPnt observations along; the axis of the Sound for the m;e of mariners; tlle stations to be hwate<l aloug- the axial line at distances apart of >tbout ten miles, and to lie occupied for one ebb and oue 1.lootl. Densities and temperatures to be noted in connection therewith . .l\Ir. Haskell joined the Fii;!i Jlwrk: at St. George, Staten Island, New York, on June 6, and irnmerliat(~Jy began preparations for the tidal and current work. The current meters to be employed were ratel1 in Factory Pond, Staten Island, and by permission of Col. \V. R. King, U.S. Engineers, a title·gauge uf the Uoast and Geodetic Survey pattern was set up at "'\Villets Point, East River, to replace the old gauge, wl.Jich worke1l poorly. Ou .Jum~ 1:3, the Fish Hmrk arrived at ::N"ew Ha-ven, Conn. 1 and a tide-gauge was established on a wharf at Fin:1 l\11le Poiut. At New London, where the steamer arrived on the 18th, no very satisfactory site for an automatic title-gauge could be found; one was finally selected, however, on the wllarf of the Pequot House. li'rom tlie 18th of June till the end of the fiscal year the time was occ11pied in obtaining supplies needed for fitting ont current meters. These arrived on the 27th instant, aml on June .30, 1890, the steamer was at Saybrook Point, Connecticut, waiting for weather that woulrl permit observations. A foll abstract of work accomplished during the season will appear in the next Annual Re-

port. Shore·line and hydr ograpMc re.mri~eys of Shinnecock and Quantuck Bays, south coast of Long Island.-In continuation of the resurveys of shore-line and h;ydrogmpliy on the south coast of Long Island, Assistant C. T. Iardella organized his party nnder instructions tla.te<l towards the end of Jnue, 1889, and early in July began topographical work from the limits of his resurveys of the premi ding season at the east end of Moriches Bay. The triangulation signals which had been erected during the summer of 1888 bad all been destroyed hy heavy gales of wind, and in one instance a signal (Point Inlet) which stood on a high sand hill bad been entirely washed away. Some delay was caused, therefore, at the outset until the signals needful could he put up again. This having been done, a connection was made with the plane table survey of 1888, at the east end of Moriches Bay, and work carried on to Quantuck Bay through tlte canal which was cllt some years ago between these two bays. Quantnck Ba;y is about 2,200 metres (7,218 feet) long, and 1,300 metres (4,265 feet) wide, with an average cfopth of water of 8 feet. After finishing the shore line resurvey of Qua.ntnck Bay, that of Shinnecoek Bay wa.s taken up, and also the resurvey oftbe outer beach line to the end of the bay, a distance of 12 miles. Shinnecock Bay is 10 miles in length, and from 1to3 miles in width. At the time of Mr. fardella's resurvey, its oul.Y outlet to the ocean was Fire Island Inlet, 45 miles distant. Old Inlet, abreast of Atlantim·ille, and thrt>e other iuh·tfi were closed by a heavy southeast storm during the month of l\fay, 188(). The canal lwt""een l\·couic and Shinnecock Bays, for opening which an appropriation was made hy the State or New York, has not proved to be a snccess, being almost closed in some places hy tlw falling hack of .;;and into it from the undermining of the banks by the tlow of the tide. One effect of the closing of tile ocean inlets has been to les?ten t!rn depth of the main channel in the bay. But 10 feet can. now be carried from the canal for the whole length of tbe bay.

After leaving the fiel<l Mr. Iardellri reported for duty to the Office, and was there occupied in inking his topographical sheets until early in December, "·hen he was ordered to join the party of Assistant Stehman Forney, on the western coast of Florida. Reference to this dut:y will be found under a heading in Section VII. Upon his return from Florida, Mr. Iardella reported for duty at the Office, and l>etween March 21 and May 14 was engaged in in king hi8 topographical sheets. On May 15, he left Washington under inHtructions to resume his resurYe,\· s on the south coast of Long Island, from the limits of his work of the preceding season, carr yiog them to the eastward, and taking up as soon as practicable the hydrography of the interior waters on the south shore. After replacing four signals which had been blown down by the winter gales, he began topographical work May 21 at Indian H,cservation, and continued it to South Hampton, reaching that point June 23. He then took up the hydrography, and was prosecuting that at the close of the fiscal year.

Shore-line e.va1nination for the detenninatio1i of ahange.~ in and additions to New rork City front, between West Sixty-setienth sti-eet, Burlson River aiul Rlackmell'.~ Island., Bast Rit· er, inclurling also the .~hore lines on the New Jeney and Brooklyit sides of the Ji.arbor, and a shore line examination of the Raritan River from Tottetwille, N. Y. 1 to Neio Brunswick, N. ,J.-For the purpose of noting all the changes in and additions to the wharf fronts of New York Bay and Harbor that had occurred since the survey of 1885, Mr. Homer P. Ritter, expert in physical hydrography, was temporarily detached from office duty under the direction of Assistant l\farindin, and under instructions dated NoV"ember 11, 1889, was ordered to proceed to New York City and make a thorough examination of the shore line from \Vest Sixty-seventh street on the North River round by the Battery to Blackwell's Island, East River, including also the shore lines on the New .Jersey and Brooklyn sides of the harbor. That done, he was further instructed to make a similar examination of the Raritan River. With the aid of a steam launch, bo:tt's crew and instruments, fu:mished by Lieut. ""· I'. Elliott, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Eagrc, iu compliance with a request from Lieut. Commander C. M. Tho1rnu1, HJ-drographic Inspector, :\lr. I~itter made a tour of the harbor front, comparing successively each portion of it with its representation on the chart No. 369-4, which was based upon the survey of 188.5. Any change pcrcehed was at once noted on the chart; measurements were taken and information in reganl to it obtained, the data being entered also in a record book kop~ for the purpose. The correcte<l shore line was subsequently compared with tb.e shore-line surveys of the New York Dock Commissio11, and with those of the Riparian Commission of New Jersey, permission to inspect the maps of these sur· veys having been kindly given.

:Mr. Ritter states that his minute and rigid inspection of the shore lineR showed that all the changes observed were due to alterations occurring since the survey of 1885 was made. These alterations, on tile New York City front, were brought about mostly by the rebuilding of old piers, arnl by the gradual extension of all to au uniform pier line; and with regard to their effect on the physical status of the harbor he remarks that if a considerable·portion of the resen·oir capacity of the river has been encroached upon, this hi balanced by the frequent dredgings which deepen the slips. · On the New Jersey shore the changes made are of a similar character and the same statement applies. The changes ill the East River at the .Brooklyn side were found not to have greatly altered the shore from a physical point of -view, excepting; perhaps, where there has been a reduction iu width in the vicinity of Blackwell's Island. But the important part which the East River plays in the regimen of New York Harbor, as pointed out so frequently by Henry Miwhell, for many years Chief of Physical Hydrography in the Survey, is now well known to both' State anu National authorities, and it is therefore quite improb~ble that any serious encroachment in the volume-carrying capacity of the stream would be permitted. After the completion of the New York work a shore line ex:amination was made of' the Raritan Ri\'er from Tottenville, N. Y., to New Brnnswick, N. J. Charts embodying the changes noted on this river and on New York Bay and Harbor were forwarded to the Office. Mr. Ritter returned to 'Vasbington December 7. He acknowledges his obligation for courtesies extended and aid afforded by the Hydrographic Inspector and by Lieutenant Elliott; alsQ for facilities afforded by Mr. \Valter G-. Berg, principal assistant engineer of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. Permission to inspect the maps of their respective surveys was freely accorded by Lient.-Ool. W. McFarland, U. S. Engineer in charge of improvements in New York Harbor, and by Capt. Geo. McO. Derby, U.S. Engineers, in charge of the Raritltn I~ivcr improvements. During the remaincler of the winter .\Ir. Ritter was engaged in duty at the Office, and at the end of February was detached aIHl ordered to join the party of Subassistant Welker on Pensacola. Bay. Hydrographie s1tr1Jey of the Wallabout Channel, New York Harbor.-In compliance with a request 1rn1dc by the Secretar~· of the Navy aml by direction of tlle Secretary of the Treasury, instructions were given in January, 1890, to foeut. Wm. P. Elliott, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Etigre, to make a resur\'ey of the Walla.bout Channel at the Navy Yard, East River, New York, in order to show what changes had taken place since the last survey, which was made in 1885; also what changes, if any, in the shoal near the southern entrance to the cllannel which was developed in 1889. For this purpose Lieutenant Elliott was furnished with a projection, scale 1-2500, including the area of the desired resur\'ey, and he was directed to fill in the hydrography of the entire chanuel, and also that of the approaches to both entrances. The work was taken up immediately after the receipt of instructions; a. tide gange was set up ou the Uob Dock and continuom1 tidal observations maintained during one lunation, the zero of gauge beillg referred to a bench mark on the upper siirface of the stone coping of the dry dock. The ends of' each line of soundings run were located on the sea walls and dock walls of the Navy Yard, and having two observers on shore, the leadsman ia. the bow of the boat was ftx:ed in position twice on each short line b,y simultaneous cross cuts at the dropping of a signal flag in the boat. Outside of the Cob Dock and Ordnance Dock the lines were generally run with one observer in the bow of the boati who had a signal flag dropped at the instant of takiug the a.ugle, and was fixed iu positi-0n by an observer ou shore from a point as nearly as possible norma.l to the coume of the boat. A de>elopment of the shoal outside of the receiving ship Vermont at the western entrance to the Wallabont Channel was carefully made, and in addition to the lines plotted, many soundings were taken about the shoalest spot found. The least depth found by Lieuteuant Paine in Feb. rnary, 1889, was 17 feet, but there is now a shoal spot havrng from 14-:{o to 14-/0 feet upon it. This spot is evidently shoaling, and the shape of the sb.oal was observed to have ohanged somewha.t, being a. little longer to the northward.

A systematic scheme of dredging is much to be desired, and it is understood that the present policy of the commandant is to formulate such a scheme from this resurvey. Lieutenant Elliott reported the completion of the work February 12, and transmitted his hydrographic sheet and records to the Office. His descriptlve report is filed in the .Archives. He acknowledges the very acceptable service rendered by Ensign E. A. Anderson, U.S. N., who was temporarily detached from office duty to aid in the sur\ey. Draftsman A. H.. Hasson and Recorder W. S. Crosby, serving as pay yeomen on the Eagre, rendered efficient service as obserrnrs and recorders. Hydrograpkic survey of the approaches to Ellis Island, New York Harbor.-Lieutenant William P. Elliott, U. S. N., Assistant Ooast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Bagre, who was instructed in April, 1890, to make a hydrographic examination of the approaches to Ellis Island, New York Harbor, for the use of the Commissioners of Immigration, has reported that there is no practicable approach to the island except by the channel leading in on a range from South Brooklyn to the wharf facing southwest, and which has always been used for the handling of ammunition. Other wharves and bulkheads are inaccessible to any but small boat.s, and no channel can be made to them. Lieutenant Elliott has transmitted to the Office with his report a tracing showing the corrected soundings in the channel leading to this principal wharf. Re observes that ii. has been dredged from time to time, latterly about 4 years ago, to a depth of 10! fo.et, and for a widt!i of from 50 to 100 feet off the wharf, but it has now filled in considerably. It is contemplated to build a wharf 1,200 feet long, with a necessary turn of 30 to 45 degrees, so that boats for the transfer of immigrants can land at all tides and weathers, protection being gained against either northerly or southerly gales by using one or the other sides. Lieutenant Elliott obtained much information respecting titles, currents, and depths from Quarterman Cook, who bas liveu at the magazine for 25 years. The northeru and western approaches to the island are not capable of improvement, as ledges and bowlders are numerous. In severe northerly gales, when the water is blown out of the bay, the bottom has been ,-isible for almost the entire distance to the wharves on the north, and from southwest of the dre<lged channel to Bedloe's Island. Tidal reductions were ma{le from a gauge located at Governor's Island, where a plane of reference is marked. The tidal currents are not of great strengtll in the immediate vicinity of the wharf, but the projected wharf will reach out to a considerable el>b current in tlJe ship channel. A part of the fiooll current comes up inside Bellloe's Island, ointl sweeps to the eastward on the line of the proposed wharf, antl th is current, Lieutenant Elliott thinks, bas some sconriug effect, obliterating and lessening the dretlged channel. The zeal and ability of Ensign E. A. Anderson, U. S. N., who was detailed to assist Lieutenant Elliott in this survey, are acknowledged in the report. Tidal observations conUnued with automatic tide gange at Sandy Hook, Xew .Jersey.-At the a.ntomatic tidal station, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, the record was kept continuously throngliout the year, Mr. David E. Snead having maintained it until Jannary 31, 1890, when he was relitffed by Mr. J. G. Spaulding. The observer determined from time to time the relation of zero of tide-staff to the several bench-marks in the vicinity by running lines of level, so as to detect any cbauge of the series in altitude. Recovery and marking of a station of the primary triangulation in Pennsylvania.-It having been reported to the office that the tripod and observing scaffold which bad been erected to mark the primary triangulation station "Governor Dick" in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, lia!l been removed and that there was danger of the station being lost, Assistant Stehman Forney was directed in July, 1889, to proceed to the station and take such measures as might be necessary for its preservation. Upon his arrival he found that the underground station mark w?ts undisturbed, but was unable to find any traces of the surface reference-stones placed in position by Prof. Mansfield Merriman, Acting .Assistant, in 1883. The tripod and scaffold had also disappeared, at11l an observing tower was in course of construction over the site of the station by Mr. Robert Coicma.n. B. Ex.80-3

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Upon examination, Mr. Forney fonnd that the center of t,he base of this observing tower was placed precisely over the center of the station, and, as the roof would soon be in place, he decided to make it available for the support of a pole to be plumbed over the station point, and to mark this point above the surface by a new stone pier. The pier was set carefully iu position, its center being brought vertically o-rnr the station point. The pole, secured to the apex of the roof, was 2! inches in diameter and over 3 feet long. Mr. Forney states that the observing tower vibrates to{} much to be used as a station from which to measure angles with a theodolite, since every movement on the platform at the top would disturb the adjustments of the instrument. On July 2() ho returned to Washington and resumed <luty at the office. Towards the end of N o;·ember he was instructed to organize a party for the survey of Perdido Bay, Florida. .Reference to this sen·ice will be made under a heading in Section VII. Detcrminatio11 of the longit1tde of Altoona, Pennsylvama, by exchanges of telegraphic signal,s with Wa.~hington, D. C. Observatirnn for latitude at Altoona, and est<:iblishment of a nieridian line.-Iu compliance with a request of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, received through Mr. Theo. N. El;v, General Superintendent of Motive Power, referring to the desirability of obtaining a determination of the latitnde and longitude of Altoona, and of the establishment there of a. meridian line, instructions were issued towards the end of May, lS!JO, fo Assistants C. H. Sinclair and R. .A. Marr, to make the necessary arrangements for executing this work. ~lr. Sinclair having conducted the correspondence with Mr. Ely in regard to location of station, construction of instrument piers, etc., at Altoona, he was directed to occupy that station first, while Mr. Marr prepared for occupation the Coast and Geodetic Survey station in the grounds of the Naval Observatory. The stones for the transit pier and meridian mark at Altoona having been made ready and a location for the longitude station selected by Mr. Ely, Mr. Sinclair arrive(l in Altoona, May 22, aml put in place on a concrete foundation the sandstone pier for the transit instrument. '.rtte station is on grouncl belonging to the railroa(l comp<rny a.hove the small reservoir near the uew shops, and is about 1 mile nearly due north from the railroad depot. The transit pier is a siugle block 5 feet long, 34 inches wide, and 20 inches thick. The concrete bed was 16 inches thick and about 30 by 40 inches.in area.. For one-half of its length the surface of the pier was below ground, and rough cut; the other half was dressed smooth and had the top cut away to allow ample space for the transit-reversing apparatus. In the center of the top and marking the station point, as well as the south point of the meridian line, is set a copper bolt, with cross-lines cut upon it, the intersection of which defines the point of reference for latitude and longitude. Four hundred foot to the north of this point was set the stone marking the north end of the meridian line, having sunk in its top a copper bolt similarly marked. Full descriptions, with drawings of the transit pier and north meridian mark, are given in the records. .At Washington, D. C., the station occupied in the grounds of the Naval Observatory was to the west and south of the meridian circle. After some delay from cloudy and rainy weather, longitude signals were successfully exchanged between Mr. Sinclair at .Altoona and Mr. Marr at Washington, on the nights of the 28th, Wth, and 31st of May; the observers then changed stations, and in their second position the longitude work was finished by exchanges of telegraphic signals on the nights of J nne 3, 4, and 8. .A determination of the latitude of the Altoona station was begun by Mr. Sinclair and completed by .Mr. Marr, twenty-two pairs of stars being observed on six nights. 'rhe chief cost of this work was defrayed by the Pennsylvania Railroa.d Company. Other duty assigned to Messrs. Sinclair and Marr is reported under headings in SectioDB Ill, XV, XVI, and XVII. General recomiaimmce of parts of the coasts <>f Long Island and New Jersey with reference to the ckanges caused by recent storms.-Various and in some cases conflicting reports having been received at the Office of the _Survey respecting changes upon the coasts of New Jersey and Long Island produced by the severe storms o( the autumn of 1889, Assistant Charles M. Bache was instructed early in November of that year to make a rapid reconnaissance of the .New Jersey coatt

'to ascel'tain the effects of these storms, and in December he received similar instructions with reference to Coney Island and Rockaway Beaches on the coast of Long Island. r,eaving Phila(lelphia. November 5, 1\Ir. Bache carrie(l his reconnaissance from Cape May to Sandy Hook, a distance of 130 miles, the coast for this entire distance conosisting of i:;aml beaches, covered more or less by sand dunes backed by either interior waters or salt marshes, with the exception of about 20 miles where the mainland reaches directl,y to the i-ea. l\fuch information bearing upon the subject was obtained from the superintendent of the LifeSa\·ing Stations and from the keeper::; of Light-houses along the coast. "Where changetl ·were apparent, comparisons were made with the charts and measurements were taken to ascertain their extent. ]\fr. Bache gives full details in his repor.t respecting the relath·e gain or loss on the several beaches, and sa.\6 in conclusion that excepting damage to private property tbe l.Jeaches have been bnt little affected b.Y the storms. The one of SeptemlJer 10 w;is almost unprecedcntetl. No inlets, wortlly of the name, have broken through, and an of the old inlets that were close<l at the time of the storm remained closed. At the same time, l\Ir. Bache i\ays that the results of these exarhinations and of his ohsen'ation for some years while engaged in surr0rs upon tlle >ew Jersey coast lead him to coincide with the general belief that between the constant encroachments of the sea an<l the occasional gains of the shore the average effect u.pon the shore is a loss. Upon the completion of his examination of the New Jersey coast, Mr. Bache returned to Philadelphia, and early in December left for Coney Islan<l Beach, O\'er wlticlt he drove from end to euil, accompanied by a gentleman who had for some years been a resident there. Examinations confirmed the indications of constant wear upon the beach. Between the Life-Saving Station at the east end of the beach and the Oriental Hotel quite a cove had beeu formed close to the eastward of the hotel. West of the hotel, the beach had been wearing away for years, but the late storms had moved the high-water line back for 100 feet, forming quite a cm·e. Opposite the Brighton Hotel (which has been moved back 560 feet) the high-water mark has moved inland 120 feet. At Ocean Parkway where it strikes the beac!J, the loss is about 70 feet; beyond this the beach begins to gain, the greatest gain being at foe two piers. At tl1e western pier the beach was found to ha Ye gained 90 feet from the effects of the storm, all<l during the past 4 years the gain has been. 200 yards. The 1'.emaimler of the beach to the westward, it was noted, had been either very little or not at all affected by the storm. Upon Rock<tway Beach the east eull was foun<l to he wearing awa.r ra.1tidl.r. From the east point to the head of Far Hockaway Bay the beach had lost about 150 feet. The Life-SaYing Station near the east end or the beach had been alJamloued. Opposite Life-Saving Station Rocka.way, the beach had lmst 30 feet. There had lJeen i10 change at the pier, and little or nonf\ · . from the west point which was found to be making slowl.r. A channel had been dug, conncctiug .Jamaica Bay with the head of Far Rockaway Bay. Mr. Bache has transmitted with the reports of his examiuations charts of the coast upon which he has marked the localities and extent of changes observed. The duty here reported was the last field service performed by this faithful officer. Ila.ving been instructed to proceed to Washingtou for temporary duty at the Office ear]~· in February, Le was soon after ordered to service on the coast of Ualifornia, and while on bis way thither he ~vas prostrated by a paralytic attack which in the course of ten days ended his life. He died in Sau Francisco, April 10, 1890. During his oervice of u1)wards of 40 years ou both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, he had become known as an actirn and coui-cientious otncer, held in high. esteem by his associates on the Surn\v, aml as a man truthful aud honora.bk in all tlte relations of private life. Oontfauation of geodetic operation.~ in the southu:estem part of the State of Xe1c ,lerscy. -f~i·odetic operations for the extension of the triangulation of t11e State of Xew Jersey were rPsttmed .July 1, 1839, by Prof. E. A. Bowser, Acting Assistant, in accordance with instructions issued dariug Juue. The occupation of a station at Williamstown, Gloucester Uounty, and a 1·econnaissance for the extension of the triangulation to the westward of that point constituted the season's work. At Williamstown it became nooe.ssary to build an observing tripod and scaffold 64 feet high in order to see QVer the tall timber on the lines to stations Pine Hill and Colsons. In order that this structure should be strongly built aooording to the most approved plans, Assistant C. O. Boutelle

38

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

was directed to go to Williamstown and give Professor Bowser the benefit of his skill and experience in putting it up. This done Mr. Boutelle returned to Washington. Observations of horizontal angles were begun from the tripod July 29, observing signals ba-viug been erected at Pine Hill, Berlin, Hammonton, Newfield, and Oolsons. While the observations were in progress, a reconnaissance was made for determining a station to the westward, which would command a good view of the country to the north, the west, and the south. Signals of 90, 100, anrl 110 feet in height were put up at different points, and a station was finally select~(l at Taylors, a point about 17 miles west northwest from Williamstown. On August 12, a granite monument was set to mark the triangulation point. This monument is 4 feet long, dressed 6 inches square at the upper end for a length of 6 inches, and has the letters U.S. cut on each of its four sides, and a triangle on top. The monument is set in hydraulic cement to within 6 inches of the top. On September 16, the observations at \Villiamstown having been completed, fiekl operations were closed for the season. Professor Bowser has sent the records and results of his work to the Office. Revision ojtlte spec·ial survey of the Delaware River.-In accordance with instructions issued in June, 188H, and at the time (.July 1) at which the appropriation became available, Assistant R. Meade Bache resumed the work: of revising the special survey of the Delaware mver in order to obtain the data needed to correct to date the charts of the river. Between July 1 and August 31 Mr. Bache had found all of the extant stations desirable for the work immediately in hand, had supplemented them with others, and had revised the special survey from opposite the northern end of Smith's Island to below the mouth of the Schuylkill, making at the latter place a small desimllle addition to the topography. Late in the preceding autumn, as mentioned in the last annual report, the revision of topography had been completed from Bridesburg to the northern end of Smith's Island; hence on August 31, 1889, the whole of the topography of the Delaware from Bridesburg to below tlle mouth of t11e Schuylkill had been revised, the area described showing mauifold and important changes. As soon as possible after tlle cessation of the above work Mr. Bache placed in the field a small party for the continuation of the transit survey of the water front of the city, relating to the prospective radical changes in the harbor, and to the establishment of new port warden liuesi. This party consisted, including the operator, Mr. Nevillo B. Craig, of four persons, the city contributing the larger portion of Mr. Craig's pay. During 1 rnont!J. the transit party was occupied in supplementing the old local triangulation for the origiual survey of the Delaware, many poiuts of which had been lost, and the rest of the time was devoted to final field work. During the 2 months remaining. from about October 1 to November 30, the delineation of the water front of the city from Market street to Washington a\·en ue, 1,\ miles in an air line, was completed, antl, incidentally on the route, the street corners back of the water front were fixed by angles, so as to afford data sufficiently remote from local wharf-line changes to facilitate the establishment of the port warden's line. After the cessation of this field work at the time appointed, November 30, Mr. Craig was directed to continue the plptting of the survey on a scale of 1-1200. During the autumn, and until December 31, Mr. Bache, in addition to inking the sheets of his survey, indicated to his foreman such minor points on the river front as required examination. One important change, however, was discovered, that made by the U. S. Engineers in extending and raising in height their lately submerged jetty between Fisher's Point and Petty's lslaml. The amount of this change will be ascertained and incorporate<l in the map. As soon as the inking of his topographical sheets is completed they will be forwarded to the office so that a new edition of the chart of Philadelphia Uity Water Front may be issued at the earliest date practicable. The entire time during which the survey lasted was 83 days, of which 32,Z days were not available for work through the occurrence of bad weather and Sundays, making the whole time consumed in the field 50~ days. During this time thirty-six subsidiary triangulation points were determined between Market street and Greenwich Point, and along the water front opposite t.o

and on Petty's Island. By the transit work the line of the water front of the city, 3 miles in length, with an average depth of 1,100 feet, was connected with the debouehure of the streeti:; upon the water front. In this work were included the wlrnrves, all beginnings of streets, and the railroad tracks, with tbe addition of about eight hundred leYels. A survey of the district between Erie and Snsquchanna aYenue was hegun but soon discontinued, the lateness of the season making it uneconomical to prosecute it farther. By the end of the .fiscal year the maps representiug the transit work were finished, aud a duplicate of one of them for the use of the city was ready for delivery, the duplicate of the other requiring a few days additional time to complete it. Both of tlie originals will then be sent to the office. Tltese originals are on a scale of 1-1200, each oYer 8 feet in lengtli. l\Ir. Baclle had completed. at the end of tile fisc;il ;rear, the drawing and lettering of the three topographical sheets of tlic general survey. He obser\·es that tl::te ground needs inspection in a few phices to settle doubtful points of j1rnctiou between ue w and old conditions, b:tck of the shore line, after which the maps will be sent to the office. Hydrographic resurvey of tlw Philadelphia City Front and of the Delawai·c River from Smith's Island to Gloucester. Also of the approaches to the Schuylkill Ril:e1·.-The revision of L~·drography on tLe Philadelphia, City front from Bridesburg to League Islaud, of the hydrography of the Dela.ware River from the head of Smith's Island to Gloucester, and of the approaches to the Schuylkill River and the docks at the Navy-yard, was executed by Assistant Joseph Ilergesheimer, in tlle summer and autumn of 1889. Beginning work August 1, from the limits of the hydrograpby executed by Assistant R. M. Bache, in 1888, :Mr. Hergesheinrnr was occupied until the 18th in recovering and rema.rking points of the triangulation, establishing tide gauges and bencll-marks, aud in transferring the l'l'Yisell shore line to his projections preparatory to som1ding. Three days were then occupied in simultaneous tidal observations at Cooper's Point, Gloucester, and League Islanu, after which the h,rckograpltic resurvey of the docks from Bridesburg to Lel1gue Isla.ml wm;; taken up. This was finished September 16. Some delay then occrtrred, due partly to bad weather and partly to the nee1l of repairs to the working boat.

Read, U.S. N., LightHouse Inspector of the Fourth District, he obtained the services of the light-keepers on the river and bay as observers, and as in previous years Henry Winsor & Co., Agents of the Boston and PhilaLlelphia Steamship Line, Oapt. W. D. Gallagher, Superintendent of the .Philadelphia and Remling Steam Colliers, arnl the Superintendent of the Oity Ice Boats volunteered their aid antl co-operation. The observations at the Delaware Breakwater were made by the keeper of the East End Breakwater Light. Mr. 1lfo0'1T'kle reports that there was no ice in the river or bay during the winter that offered any obstruction to navigation. The ice boats were not needed, though ready for service. The keeper of Horseshoe Range Light S<tys, under da.te of ~larch 3, 18!.IO, "skim ice in cove ftrst time this winfor." At Schooner Ledge Light the first ice formed :March 7, very thin, but soon melted away. At New Cat:itlc Light tho keeper reported some ice on shore but none afioat. At Billingsport Light the keeper reported "no ice found in the Delaware River near this station during tlie winter j11st passed." The lowest temperatures recordell during the winter were on March 7 and 8; on the morning of the 7th, at 7 o'clock, 10 degrees above zero (Fahrenheit) was recorded. In December, 1889, the lowest temperature noted was 32 degrees, and in January and February, 1890, the minima were 21 and 22 degrees, respeeth-ely. l\lr. l\IcOorkle has transmitted to the Office a general report on the ice movement and lodgment in Delaware Hiver antl Bay, covering the winter of 1878-'79, and the snccessive winters from 1883-'81 to 1888-'!}l), inclusi\·e.

D. Preston was instructed in September, 1889, to prepare the pend ulurn and magnetic apparatus which he was to take with him, and to make a series of determinations of gravity at the Smithsonian Institution, and of the magnetic elements at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. Since t11e beginning of the fiscal year, Mr. Preston had been occupied in computations supplementing the work he had done for the Hawaiian Government in 1887, the computations relating to the length and center of mass of the pendulums used ; to star residuals; to a revision of tempcmture and pressure corrections, and to a re-reduction of the observations on the principle of the reyersible pendulum. Be made also au investigation and study of the measurement of the Peruvian A.re by Bonguer, the results of which were embodied in a report submitted to the Superintendent, which wa.s published as an appendix to the last aunual report with the title" Need of a Remeasurement of the Penwfan Arc." .A.u abstract of this paper was read by Mr. Preston before the American Association for the Advancement of Science at its meeting in Toronto, August, 1889.

Continuation of the detailed. ropographiwl surrey -0f the District of Columbia, under A.m'.sf,ants J. W. Donn, R. Wainwright, anrl JV. C. Hodftkins and Su/J-ri~"'istant J. A. Flemer.-Iu order to obtain data for a comparison of field work executed by two of the parties engaged in the detailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia, Assis taut John\\'. Donn was instructed t-0wards tbe end of J<~ebruary, 1890, to make a resurye3· of a small area of topography within a limit common ro the surw~ss of Assistant 'Nainwright and Sub-assistant Flerner iu the vicinity of Fort Stanton, Mr. Donn observes in his report that for tlw object8 of a critical rcsun·ey, one of the desirable poiu ts in which 'Was a comparison of grapLic determiuatiou8 of identical topographical details by several topographers working- umler different conditions, a more fayorablc selection of area as reginded ntriety and iutricac.r of features coultl iwt well have beeu cbo,-,1m. lt v.-as unquestiona ule, he thil\,ks, that tile ,., . mall differences ;;;\1(lWll i11 tlw po!:iitions uf ideutical objects were caused by differences in tlw proj 1·etionR due to Yiei,;~itndes of temperature aud to the inilncuce of moisture. His own projection wa:,; fresh from tlw oftice, and therefore more susceptible to atmospheric changes. Tl1ose used uy .Messrs. Waimnigl:Jt aud Flemer had beeu long in the field, exposed h> all yariations in tLe weather. Under such conditions, therefore, absolute ideutit:' of determinations oonld not be looke{l for, but the close correspondence of the resurvey with the original work afforded proof that faithful work had been done. This comparison of tleld work was completed duriug the third week in )Jareb, and a report with diagrams showing both topographical features and profiles was submitted to the l::'luperintendent. l\Ir. Donn then trunsforreu his party to the unfinished part of the District I.ring along the northwestern bouudar:y, beginniug the work at tile junction of the Broad Brauch and Chappell roads. The survey had been carried to this point in March, 1877, and closed there iu order that, at the request of the Engiueer Commissioner of the District, tlie work adjacent to tbe eastern branch of the Potomac might be ad>anced. The original plane-table sheets had uudergone so much handling during the interval that their surfaces had bellome softened and in parts broken and distorted; it was deemed ath"isable, therefore, to call for new projections, and these were furnished by the -0filce. Many of the bench marks established during the progress of the sur.,ey in the western sedion, or the country lying between Tenuallyrown and the north corner of the District, baving dj,sappeared, it became necessary for tbe accuracy as well as the convenience of the work to connect with such permanent benches as were within moderate distances. As soon as the rapidly adYaucing foliage rendered a continuation of operations in wooded areal! uneconomica1, open areas only were sun·eyed. Where farm roads passed through a body of ·woods, traverse lines were run and contours carried a.cross and ro the right and left as far as it was practicable to use the instruments efleeti\·eJ.,·. In this manner the sur\'ey was advanced witlt cousi derable rapidity, and the area of untinis!Jed country largely reduced. All work that it was possible to do in the field profitably had 'been com11Ieted when further operations were discontinued for the season on June 10. Opportunity was taken duri11g tht· next 10 days to have prepared and carefully established in position granite blocks of the usual size aud form as permanent bench marks. These were located at points which Mr. Donn designaU'd with reference to their future utility and convenience as data of reference for the authorities of tlie District. Each of these bench marks was determined in elevation by two circuits from the two nearest and most trustworthy temporary or permanent benches, the limit of error not exceeding seventy-two hundredths of an inch. In the course of his survey, Mr. Donn bad under trial a. sheet of xylonite as a substitute for pa.per for topographical sheets. A longer time for testing it would have been desirable, bnt there wa.s ample evidence of its comparative stability under varying atmospheric conditions. When

prepared antiquarian paper buckled upon the table in tlie prevalence of excess of moisture in the air, the xslonite rernainell. perfectly flat and unchangeU.. Clear and sharp definitir'n of topographical features can be made upon its unpolishe·l surface with a pencil which at the same time has the necessary quality and durability, the iiencil mark remaining distinctly visible after repeated washing, and only llisappearing under a vigorous use of India rubber. The remaining unfinished areas in the western division of the District are, Mr. Donn states, generally of moderate character, topographically considered, and as there are no difficulties of a more serious nature than have alreally been met with aml repeatedly overcome during the progress of the work, he thinks that no doubt ueed exist as to the entire completion of the survey of the District under the appropriation for the next fiscal year. Duty previously performed by .:\Ir. Donn is reported nuder a heading in Section I. As stated in the last anumLl report, the party in charge of Assistant D. B. Wainwright, engaged in prosecuting the detailed topographical survey of the District of Columbia, was in the field at the clrnm of the fiscal year, and operations were continued during the month of July, 1889. Plane-table work was carried through the open portions of the valley of Oxon Run, and a sufficient number of points were determined b;y triangulation for the topographical sur\'ey of the area back of Giesboro Point, several of the old points having been destroyed, and others hidden by the dense foliage. During the month of August tile party was temporarily disbanded. September 1 work was resumed, the triangulation just referred to completed, and topographical work taken up again. Subassistant Flemer was furnished with such points as he needed. Pending the decision of a question as to the establishment of a sewer farm by the Government on the flats back of Giesboro Point, it was deemed desirable to complete that portion of the survey, as far as the 40-foot contour line, somewhat in advance. This was done during September aml October, and a tracing on vell11m was kept up with the work in the field, so that the commissioners of the District could be furnished with the results as early as possible. These" flats," so called, Mr. \Vain wright observes, rise abruptly from the Potomac to a height of from 20 to 25 feet, forming a bluff along the water front, and stretch back with slight undulations to the steep sides of the ridge dividing the valley of Oxon Hun from the river. The general slope in any direction is so small that the numerous ditches do not drain the land effectively, and there is quite an area of woo<le(l swamp. After the completion of this portion of the work the pine areas on the north side of Oxon Run were taken up, theu the wooded portions along the boundary on the sollth side of the creek, and also those adjoining Giesboro Point, until the foliage iu the spring became too thick to make satisfactory progress. Work was then continued in the open fields until June 1. Between that date awl June :30 the fielcl of operations was shifted to the north corner of the District, between the Daniels aud Milk House Ford roads, anll the remaining open patches in that locality were completell. Mr. J. T. Gibson and Mr. R. A. Clark rendered very acceptable service in the party until spring, when they resigned their positions. Mr. W. B. Hintlmarsh took Mr. Gibson's place as levelman, and soon provml to be an exceedingly careful awl painstaking assistant. Mr. William Oliver served acceptably as rod man from the time of his joiniug the party in May.

Bennings and Sheriff Roads and east of the Anacostia Road. Dnring July the weather was very unfavorable, owing to frequent rains. Work was suspended during the month of Augu15t and was resumed Septemller 1, and prosecuted continuously till May 17, 1890. During tue season the area surveyed was in the eastern corner of tile District, betwee11 tile boundary lines of tlrn District, the Anacostia. Road, and the Ridge Road. In the spring a small area south of tile Ridge H.oad which could not be finished in the preceding winter wa.s takl'U up and completed. On March 4, 1890, Mr. Hodgkins began, under instructions, tlie determination of certain positions and distances near Poplar Point, on the Eastern Branch of the Potomac, for the District Commissioners. Tho base used was a side of one of the triangles of the District Survey, and a cheek-base W<\S measured by steel tape on the Navy-Yard Bridge. l\Ir. T. N. Rulger sen'ed as levelman during the fir.st part of the seasou, and upon his lea>iug the party, Mr. \V. P. BllUack, formerly rodmau, was made levelman. Mr. E. E. Storch serred throughout the season as rod man. Upon closing field work in the District :M:r. Hodgkins was instructed to proceed to Beaufort, N. C., to take up the verification of the triangulation in that vicinity. He left W ashingtan, accordingly, on May 24. A report of this service will be found under a heading in Section IV. Subassistant J. A. Flemer, in charge of one of the topographical parties in the District of Columbia, continued work upon the unfinished plane-table sheet of the previous season in the region east of the Hamiltan and Bowen Roads. This plane-table sheet, scale 1-4800, -wllich was in hand at the beginning of the fiscal year, was completed September 26, 1889. It included an area extending to the boundary line of the District, between the third and fourth mile-stones. Field work was suspended during the month of August in order ta Clury the survey on during the autumn and winter months, when the absence of foliage would admit of more rapid progress being made in the wooded sections. In September work was taken up an a new sheet ern!Jraciug the area lying ea.'it of the Potomac River, from a point half a mile above Cox's dowu to Fox's Ferry, and taking in as much of the adjacent country as was iuclosed by the 40-fovt contour curve. The survey of this section was continued until November 16, after whieh date work was resnml~d on the still unfinished northern sheet, which had been laid aside temporarily iu order to furnish data far the proposed plan of transforming the lowlands along the Potoma~ H.ivcr, below Gicsboro Point, into irrigation farms. By February 17, 1890, the northern sheet had been completed. A new sheet was then taken up on the east side of the Potomac, mu bracing the country limited in the west by the 40-foat contour curve; on the south aud southmst h.r the boundary line of the District, and in tbe north by an irregular line rnuning i;ooutheast from a point half a mile above Cox's, on the Potomac, until it intersects the Alexandria bmneh of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and thence east until intersected by tbe Giesboro Road. The limiting line follows this road_ and the Livingston Hoad until the crossing of Oxou l~un, whence it takes tlw southern boundary of Wahler's Dairy Farm, and proceeds in a straight line to the boundary of the District. On May 17, this sheet having been finished, the party was mornd to the western part of the District, and same gaps in the topography between Fort De Iiussy and Swan's were filled up. On May 24, in accordance with instructions, field operations were closed. Mr. Flemer has transmitted with his report tl'i'"o sketches showing the area surve:;·eu during the sea.son. One of these shows also the disposition of the standard lines of levels, and the location of seven of the granite stones placed as permanent bench-marks. Duriug the survey of the lower sheet, the party met with a line of pegs put down to mark the vroposed ex:teusion of South CapitQl street. These were determined in position and located upon tlie sheet, thus gh'ing means of constructing the profile of that iine. The line of mean low water was located upon the plane-table sheet, developing tlie flats in the immediate neighborhood of Shepherd's Wharf, and also about a small island at the mouth of Oxon Run. Mr. Flemer has transmitted to the Office all data. and records relating ta his survey. In the re·isiou and preparation of the records of levelings, bench-mark determinations, and in making tracings of the original pla.ne-ta.ble sheets, he was efficiently aided by Mr. Lewis J!'lemer.

Reference to th is <luty will be found under a heading i.n Section I. Refei-ence to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as arbitrator, of a question between the /'Jtatcs of Maryland and lrfrginia, respecting the locatfo1i of part of their bounda'f'y line.-Tlle Saperiuten<lent · having been reque11tetl b_y the Governors of the States of Maryland and Virginia to detail an officer of the Surn·y 11ho should act as arbitrator between those States with rcforence to the location of a portiou of their lJomularyliue in tlte lower Potomac, in regard to which the proper interpretation of the a ward madl' in 1877 was in dispute, Assistant Henry L. Whiting was directed to confer with GoYernor Jackson, of :\Iaryland, and Go\'ernor Lee, of Virginia, au(l after having placed himself in possession of al! the information attainable by inspection of original charts and documents, and by examinations of the locality, to exercise his best judgment to bring the matter to a conclusion. Mr. Whiting made a thorough study of the subject, ancl his methods and the conclusions finally arrived at were communicated to the Superintendent in a report which 1s publis11ed as .A1)pendix No. 11 to this volume. Copies of this report were furnished to the Governors of .Mary· land and Virginia. See notice more in detail under the heading "Special Operations." E.rmniiiation and location of a dangerous rock in the Potomac Rii·er.-A dangerous rock not laid down on the chart baying been reported to exist in the Potomac River off Easby's Point, Assistant Henry L. l\fariudin was directed to organize a party to examine and locate it. This work be took up under instructions dated April 19, and on the 29th he had completed the survey. His examination showed that the rock was a dangerous obstruction to navigation for vessels drawing 9 feet and more of water. The rock was a single one, liaving a depth o\·er it of 9 feet at mean low water, and 191 feet around it. It lies very nearly in the middle of the river (taking the high-water line of each.shore), but the channel proper lies to the eastward, between the rock and Easby's Point, with the deepest water, 32 feet, about 200 feet east of the rock. To the westward, towards Aualostan Island, the depths shoal from 19~ feet at the rock to 16 feet depth at a distance of 120 feet, and thence decrease to the low-water line.

data from local authorities for the use of the Coast Pilot of Chesa1)eake Bay and tribu t:aries. The
mauuscript of a volume covering these waters had been prepared from all sources available at the Office by Ensign Tillman, with the aid of Mr. Ross, and it remained only to make final ·erificatious afloat. Between August 10 and September 13, the Endeavor steamed up all of tlie principal tributaries of Chesapeake Bay, and the work was completed with the exception of that in Chester River and at the immediate head of the Bay. When the Endeavor left the Cltesapeakl~ for New York September 15, it was expected that the manuscript of the Uoast Pilot for the waters under examination would be ready in a few days for transmission to the printer. On September 18, Ensign Tillman was relieved in commantl of tlie Endcaror by Ensign L. M.

J,ientenant Fiebeger will keep the Office informed of such additioual changes as may occur from time to time, both iu structures along the water fronts and in depths of water. Before returning to the Office l\Ir. Dorm examined the original topographical surveys of the area to the north and east of Norfolk in order to ascertain what triangulation it would be desirable to make, should a new and more precise topographical surn,Y of tlie whole area be called for. His special report upon this subject emphasizes the importauec of large scale sun·eys of the most exact character in the vicinity of cities and harbors, and of the exercise of the utmost care in the determinations of topographical details, especially those that <tre likely to be permanent, with reference to their utility in such future resurveys as the dewlopment of the country may demand.

of the magnetic elements, and a number of stations re-occupied to obtain data for additional knowledge respecting the secular variations of tho magnetic declination, dip, autl intensity. Towards the close of the season, a station was re-occupied in Lynchburgh, Va. It had been originally occupied, under the direction of J. E. Hilgard, M. N. A.

Hilgard, and the observations for magnetic declination, dip, arnl horizontal intensity were made by him and by J.M. Poole in July, 1873. Mr. Baylor's observations were made in June, 1890; the latitude, longitude, and azimuth were determined bs observing on the sun on one day, and the magnetic elements on another day.

Mr. Hodgkins left Washington in pursuance of these instructions May 24, and immediately upon his arrival at Beaufort began fielcl work. Ten tripod signals were erected, besides several nrdinary signal poles; thirteen stations were occupied and twenty-three objects were observed. .At three of the stations observing platforms were built, it having been found necesssary to elevate the theodolite about ten feet above tho surface of the ground. The CO:i!~'lction of the new and old triangulations was made upon the line .Jumping Run to Rocky Point, about twelve miles west of Beaufort. The old station" Shepards Point" was also recovered and occupied. Mr. Hodgkins was furnished with one of the theodolites recently construi·ted in the office whicll are adapted to the determination of magnetic bearings, and he was enabled therefore to olJserrn the magnetic declination at each station occupied except at two where the conditions were not favorable. With regard to Bogue Sound, he states that the shores have been to a considerable extent washed away during heavy storms in recent years. In 1867, the topographical party found nearly all the station marks in place, while in 1890, only three were found out of ten searched for, and two of these were below high-water line. The old stations recovered and the new ones established were marked with care, earthen cylinders being used for undergrouncl marks, and white marble blocks for center marks at the surface. Arouud these, for witness marks, heavy cedar posts were placed. Mr. W. P. Bullock served ill the party as recorder, and Mr. E. E. Storch as foreman. Field work was ftnisbed the last day of the fiscal year, and two days later the party was disbanded.

Work was begun by a careful examination of Fort Sumter in order to recover if possible the exact position of the triangulation station of 1857. The walls of the fort remain as before the war, except that they have heen cut uown one tier of casements. The station occupietl in 1889 was fouml to be but slightly in error, being about 5 inches too far t-0 the northeast. Tlle measurement made in 1889 must have been taken, Mr. Granger thinks, from the outside edge of the coping instead of from the edge of the wall. The station of 1889 was connected by careful angular and linear measurements with the new position. Mr. Ellicott's signal was then removed, and an observing tripod and scaffol<l signal, 12 feet high, was erected over the point, this having been found necessary in order to command the entire horizon. The reconnaissance which followed to obtain a site for a base-line resulted in the selection of a site on Morris Island. Preparations were then made to measure an astronomical azimuth at station Fort Johnson, the most convenient point for that pllrpose. Time was obtained by dou\Jle altitudes of the sun, and for azimuth, Polaris was observeu before and after western elongation. As 8oon as possible after the completion of the observations for azimuth, Mr. Granger \'isited Morris Island to prepare the base-line for measurement. Marking stakes were set upon the line for each tape-length (30 metres), the stakes being driven until their top surfaces were flush with the ground. Due precautions were taken over rough ground and over marsh to presen'e an exact alignment for the tapes, both horizontally and vertically. The measurement was completed by April 3, the length measured being 1,491 metres. As soon as the connection of the base with the triangulation of 1889 had been made, l\fr. Granger took up the triangulation of Ashley Hh·er from the limits of Mr. Ellicott's work of the preceding season, anu carried it up that river for a distance of !J miles. The reconnaissance, signal building, opening of lines and other operations involved in this triangulation occnpied the entire party during favorable weather in the field. At the same time, the computation of geographical positions determined by the triangulation in the lower bay was pushed ahead as rapidly as possible. Every church spire and e1ery prominent object in the city of Charleston was determined; also all of the light-houses and other prominent objects in the harbor and bay. A comparison of geographical positions of several of the triangulation points with a redeter. ruination of the same points based upon St. Michael's church spire led Mr. Granger to infer that this point had been more disturbed in position by the earthquake of August 31, 188G, than either J!'lynn's Church or the Orphan House, two other points of the triangulation of 1857. Accordingly he sent Mr. Hendricks to Charleston fo obtain information with regard to the probable changes in the positions of the various church .spires due to that catastrophe. Mr. Devereux, superintendent of Government buildings, gave details respecting these changes, and stated that the l:'pire of St. Michael's had sunk 10 inches on the Meeting street face, and was probably then leaniug 2rr feet to the soutllwest On the eighth of' May the triangulation of the Ashley River having boon carried as far as practicable for the season, Mr. Granger, in pursuance of instructions, turned the charge of his party over to Mr. J.B. Boutelle, who took up the topographical survey of .the Ashley River, carrying it up as far as station Atlantic. .Mr. Granger proceeded to Washington to prepare for other duty which will he reported under a Leading in Section XV. Ou May 17, Mr. Boutelle suspended field operations, and on the 21st, laid up the schooner Ready in the Cooper River. His services are very highly commended in the report of his chief.

.E.~tabl ishment and maintenance of an auto1na.tie tidal station 011 Tybee Island, Savannah River Entrm1ce.-Reference was made in the last annual report to the selection of a site for an automatic title gauge on Tybee Islaml at the entrance to Savannah River. A pier for the gauge was built a short distance north \\est of Tybee Light. Creosoted piles were used for the foundation of the pier, and those wliieh it was specially important to protect were also sheathed with copper below the water line. The gauge was put in operation September 28, 1889, and has been kept rtrnning since tllat date. Thi:; series will be of great value, not only for the prediction of the Savannah River tides hut also for the study of the laws of tidal action on the South Carolina and Georgia coasts. ;1Ir. ,T. G. Spaulding established the gauge in position and kept up the record until January, 1800, wlteu he \iWl relieved by Mr. Eugene Veith, >rlw had qualified himself as tidal observer under Mr. Spaulding's direction. Special liydrogra11hy.-Examination of tltc sounds and estuaries of Georgia 1vith reference to oyster culture.-In compliance with a request received from the Governor of the State of Georgia early in September, 1889, Ensign J.C. Drake, U.S. N., Assistant Coast arnl Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Beady, was directed by the Superintendent to proceecl to Savannah and make such hydrographic surveys and examinations as might be required in connection with the investigation of oyster beds in the waters of that State. The Ready having !Jeen duly :fitted for the service arrived at the mouth of the Savannah Hiver Octo her 2. Having fully informecl himself in regard to the requirements of the WOI'k by consultation with the State authorities, Ensign Drake decided to carry tile investigations from. the Savannah River southward to the Florida line. The experience he hatl already acquired in similar work during three years' service on the Xorth Carolina coast with Lieut. Francis Winslow, U.S. N., was of great value to him. As assistants he was enahled to secure tbe services of Messrs. John D. Battle and W. :F'. Hill, who hall been his associates in the North Carolina survey, and also those of Mr. \V. N. King, jr., a graduate of the U. S. Ka val Academy. Great interest was manifested in the work by Dr. A. Oemler, of Savannah, an authority on the biology of the oyster, and throngh his efforts the survey was in many ways expedited. With tlie approval of the Ma~·or of Savannah, a naphtha launch was placed at the disposal of the party by Dr. \Y. F. Brunner, llcalth Officer of the city, and the field working force was thereby doubled. The time for tl1C prosecution of the surveys being limited to 1ive months and the appropriation small, tlie examinations could not be made as minute and comprehensive as was desirable, but notwitltstaudiug the limitations under which he was placed, the report submitted by Ensign Drake discusses Yery fully all bra.uches of the subject, and, with the statistics gathered, points out to the State authorities what farther legislation is desired in order to encourage the oyster industry. This report, accompanied by seven charts, has been published. as Bulletin No. 19, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The charts show graphically the location, limits, and areas of the natural oyster beds ancl t1rn specific gra>ity of the water reduced to a temperature of 600 F. 1 while the report describes the methods of work and the areas examined, states the general conclusions arrived at, and prei>ents a tabular statement of acres for each area; acres outside of the limit of J,000 feet from the 8hore at ordinary mean low tide, and acres occupied by natural oyster beds. Bnsign Drake Ntates that of upwards of 70,00() acres examined not more than 30,000 were df'Pmed suita!Jle for oyster culture, hut that under the preseut law these 30,000 acres, if leased wonld tnrn into the State school fu1Hl $30,000, and when reduced to cultivation would inerease the tflXtthle pro1H:rty of the State by $:;,000,000.

Georgia, having been reported. to the Office by a citizen of Brunswick, Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was instructed to make an inYcstigation of these changes ou his way north after the completion of his surveys on the Florida coast. Having arrived off St. Simon'.s Bar in the steamer Bache on May 16, 18DO, at 11 a. m., ancl finding the conditions favorable for sounding, it being low water, spring tides, and but little wind and sea, Lieutenant Moser anchored outside and sent a lJoat at once to souml tlw North arnl South Channels. Upon the return of the })arty the officer in charge reported tllat the best <·lrnmiel across the b:w was britween the wreck of the Sunlleam and No. 1 llnoy. Tlw HteamPr was then taken to the sea buoy and a line of soundings, using two leads, was carried from that lnio~· across the bar to the P. ::3. Cllanuel buoy. Next morning, after passing quarantine, Li{mtcnant .Moser sent a boat to finish the examination '~hilst Ile proceeded to Brunswick and speut some lwurs with two captains of tugs who daily tow vessels across tbe bar and with three bar 11ilots, all of whom gave freely the information desired. Ile reports as tlle result of his own examinations antl from iuformatiou gathered as just mentioned that the North Channel bas changed to su~h au extent that at present only IO feet cau lie carried through it at mean low water, and that it is no longer used; that in tl.ie South Channel there is little more than 12 feet on the bar, probably 12 i"o feet at mean low water; that the son th point of tlrn Middle Ground has made to the southward, so that buoy 1'\o. 1 is now on tlrn south llOint of the shoal, and is ur;ed iu entering as a starboard-hand instead of a port-baud buo3°, as represented by its number and color. Lieutenant Moser gives sailing directions for crossing the bar and entering the sound with the lrno_ys and channels as found by his ex,nninat10us, but he goes on to show that the channels are constantly shifting, and observes tltat the changes on this bar are similar to those tlmt arc occuring yearly on other harbor bars between New York aml Kc3- West, and wliich demand not e:xtensiv(~ resurveys but a few days' soundings to furnish data for correcting cbart8 to date. To ha·e such work done effectively and promptly ho suggests the consideratiou of n. l'ystem previou;;ly urged, that of dividing the Atlantic cuast into sections, one from Eastport to Cape Hatteras and another from that point to Key "\Vest, and the maintenance of a well-found st~amer anil a wrlJ. organized llydrographic party on each section to make resur>eys, speeial examinations, locate wrecks, etc. The ad\antage derived from the operation of such a system would, it is belieYed, arnpl,y justify the e,xpen<liture involved. Hydrographic work executed by Lieutenant :\loser in the 8nmmer and autumn of 1889 is referred to under a heading in Section I, and his surveys on the Florida coast under a heading iu Section VI.

E.rmnination of a shoal reported off the northern end of Key Biscayne.-.<\ shoal off the northern end of Key Biscayne having been reported to the Office, Lieut. A. I,. Hall, U.S. N., Ax;;ist~mt Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding tho steamer Endeavor, was instructed to ;;top ou his way north from duty on the Gulf coast and make an examination of the locality. Under date of June 9, 1890, Heutenant Hall reports that the shoal was found about 250 feet southwest of the present position of Cape Florida buoy; that its area was about 600 square feet, and that the least water found was 12~ feet. The Rhoal ha<l been formed by cenwnt barrels thrown o>er hy a steamer which grounded in that locality in June, 1889. Bundles of harbe<l wire had been thrown over at the same time, and in searching for and recovering these the barrels had been somewhat distributed and were no longer in piles. The least water referred to was taken on top of one of the barrels standing on its head. About the barrels the least water was 15 feet. Due notice of this shoal was given in Notice to l\fariners, No. 1291 published June 30, 1890. Gulf Stream cxplorations-Investiga,tion of currents continue<i.-Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, U~ S.

command of the steamer Blake, was instructed to continue the investigation of the currents of the Gulf Stream during the winter of 1889-'90. Ile reports that the Blake left Hampton Roads November 18, 1889, and re-entered the roads on her return north April 10, 18()(), During this interval of four months and twenty-four llays, attention was directeu chiefly to the two sections of the Stream, located respectively between the west end of CubtL tLnd a point about sixty miles west of Tortugas, aml between the Campeche Banks and the Mississippi Delta. There are six: stations on each section, and each station was occupied at least twice during th'.'l season. Se\·eral additioua.l anchorages were made by Lieutenant Pills· bury (who had accompanied the party soutllward) on the way from Hampton Roads to Key \Vest, mainly with a view of giving Lieuteuant Vreeland practice in the use of the anchoring gear and other apparatus peealiar to the Blake's outfit, but the points occupied were so selected us to con· nect all the data obtained at them with the general scheme of investigation, and to make them available either for present use or future reference. The distances between sections, and also between the several stations on the sections, were unusually great in comparison with those made during the former seasons, and much of the time (nearly one-third) wits consumed in steaming.

.A sounding was taken at each station before anchoring, and the bottom specimens brought up by the Rounrling rod wem carefully preserved. The deepest water anchored in was 1,949 fathoms; the least depth sounded was 240 fa.thorns. The accm:nulated data of the season were turned over to Lieutenant Pillsbury, who will embody them in a report which he has in preparation. Lieut. IL Kimmell, U.S. N.; Ensigns C. S. Stan worth, J.E. Shindel, and P. A_ndrews, U.S. N.; Assistant Surgeon T. Owen, U. S. N.; and Assistant Engineer W. W. White, U. S. N., were attaclte1l to the party on the Blake. Other dnty assigned to Lieutenant Vreeland is referred to under a heading in Section II. ll!Jrlrographic surreys in Ba.rnes Sound, in the Bay of Florida, and on the u'est coast of Florida from Cape Romano fo Sliark Rfrer.-In continuation of the hyllrography of the west coast of _Florida, and for its completion as far as practicable, Lieut. J. F. llfoser, TJ. S. N., Assistant Coast anll (~eocletic SuneJ·, commanding the steamer Bache, left Baltimore for Key 'Vest January 11, 18UO, aml after a rnry rougl1 passage arrh·ed at the latter port January 19. After coaling aud taking on board !timber, etc., the Ba,che proceeded to the working ground, wlwre operations were begun on the 24th instant. During the winters of 1887-'88, and 1888-'89, Lieutenant Moser had finished the more important parts of the hydrography from Cape Romano southward to the Bay of Florida, and thence wet->tward and southwestward along the Florida. Keys, and in the unfinished portions, the waters being very shallow and no channels for commercial purposes existing, it became somewhat of a question whether any further surveys should be made. But it was finally decided that it would ue desirable to have some representation hydrographically of those unfinished areas upon the charts, and in accordance with Lieutenant Moser's suggestions, the plan of work was made to include the development of the bydrography of a simple system of lines, using the topographical features, as far as possible, to locate them by. The work was divided into three sections, which, as they are differently conditioned, Lieutenant :Moser considers separately in his report. 'rhe first section embraced that portion of the work south of the main land of Florida, and included the waters of Barnes Sound and Cards Sound to Pumpkin Key, where the hydrography connected with that previously executed in Key Biscayne Bay. These waters are entered from the reefs by sloughs between all the reef-keys; from the westward by sloughs between Twin Keys,

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

49

Shell Key, and Upper Matecmnbe, and from the eastward by sloughs thi."ough Cards Sound. They are interspersed with many keys and are cut up into numerous lakes and ponds; the dividing lines, however, arc not land, but shoals, which, in extreme low water, ma;y be bare in places, but 11ave usually a foot of water over them, and are covered with grass. The ponds thus formed have from 5 to 7 feet of water, and on the reef side are connected by narrow sloughs, which, though as deep as the ponds, have bars, permitting boats having a draft of 2~ feet at ordinary water level to pass through. A westerly winll makes high water over this section, and an easterly wind low water. There is no traffic through these inside waters. Occasionally a turtler or a sponger appears, aml it is apparently quite an event when one of the dwellers on thti ker-reefs goes as far as the main land. There are no distinctive features to the land. 'fhe shores of the keys and the main are covered with mangrove bushes and trees, and are for the most part s"·ampy, though generally containing sand or shell ridges, and in many IJlaces tbe mud is so soft as to make it almost impossible to laud for signal building . .Most of the points marked in the old triangulation have been lost; two, however, were recovered, Stations \Vest antl Roa1l; and two partially recovered, Stations Mark and Middle Plantation, and as the work progressed and expanded to the eastward four more stations were found, by means of which and b.Y additional points determined tl.te work was carried forward. Lieutenant :Moser notes that great changes in topographical features seemed to have occurred since the date of the earlier surveys. He observes that there is no regular tidal action in t11ese waters, the water levels depending entirely upon the winds, except in the immediate Yicinity of the inlets, where the titles slightly modify the conuitions. With regard to local names, he states tliat the bod.Y of water to the eastward and northeastward of the Bay of Florida, marked as Barnes Sound on the chart, 1s locally known as Cards Sound. At the eastern end is '" point on which there is a triangulation station known as Barnes Point, aad from this point extends a shoa,J to the northwest joining the mainland. East of Barnes i~oint to the A.rsenicka Ke:rs is Cards Sou11ll, 1liYide<l into Little Cards Sound, the western portion, and Big Cards Souml the eastern IJortion. 'Ille large landlocked poml between what is called Barnes Sound on tlie chart ::mcl Cards Sonnd is known locally as Blackwater Sonnd. Having finished tue eastern work, or the tirst section, tlJe h.rdrograplly of tlle second section was taken up. Lines of soundings were rnn traversing t11e waters between tlte keys from Big Pine Key to Key 'Ved. These w1tters are generally veI'.Y shallow; there are mauy buuches of mangroves, l.lhoals, aud bars, au<l the work wa,-;; cxecntecl rather for the purpose of showing that there were no commercial cuannels tltan for tlte de\elopment of tlw 1 and 2 foot channels that existed. The keys on this section are but sparingly iuhabited, the soil 01' rocks not beiug so favorable for cultivation as the eastern keys. Saw;\·et Key, so namecl on the chart, is known locally us the Bay Cudjoe. After the com11letfon of tllis })Ortion of the surYey, Lieutenant l\Ioser proceeded to Shark River, north of Cape SalJlei to begin work on the inlets and rinr mouths between Cape Sable and Cape Romano. The b;plrography from Cape Sable to Cape Romano an<l thence seaward to the 10-fathom curve had been executed by his party dnring a preceding season, but there was then no sliore-line delineated on the sheets, the hydrography having preceded the topography. Bence the inside work required a more thorough t.leve.Iopmeut, and the bydrograpb~· was therefore carried into the mouths of the rivers, tile passes and the openings, aud as far as the topography llacl been executed between the keys. A full account of this section, with sailing directions, etc., was ginm by Lieutenant Moser in bis report for 1887-'88. Fielcl operations were closed May 17, 1890. Tue following uauu:d naval ofilcrrs were attached to the party: Ensigns H. A. :Bispham, R. D. Tisdale, S. M. Strite, 0. Bertolette, aJHl J.;, H. Dnrell, U. S. N.; Passed Assistant Surgeon John l\f. Steele, U. S. N., antl .Assistant Engineer E. H. Scribner, U.S. N. Messrs. J. L. Dunn, J.M. McTiffany, and Thos. S. Martin serYed as recorders. Lieutenant Moser commends the cheerful and efficient ai<l rendered by his officers, and referring to the fa.ct that during three separate tours of duty his connection with the Survey H.Ex. 80--4

ha(l occupied in all fifteen years, he observes that he will always look back upon this duty as the· roost agreeable of his naval career, and that he will hold in grateful remembrance the military all<l civil members of the service with whom he was associated. Lieutenant Moser, upon his detachment from the Survey July 15, 1890, was ordered to the new armored cruiser Sa.n Francisco.

Triangulation, topography, 1ind hy1lrography on the west coast of Fla rida, in tlw vicinity of Cape Romano and to the northward.-The survey of the west coast of Florida from Cape Romano to the nortll\nml, incltitling CaximlH18 Bay an1l Cape M:arco Pass, triangull\tion, topography, and hJ~1trogmpby was taken up by AsfSistant Joseph Hergeshimer, January 28, 1890. Having arrived at that date at Coon Key, with his party on board the sclrnoner Quick, he found it necessary to re-establish signals at Oape Romano, Oaximhas, and Big Marco, and to determine a number of new points for tlie topograpl1ical survey. The topography was exccu tcd on a scale of 1-10000, and inclndcd the shore line of all the navigable waters back of Cape Romano, the shore lines Coou Key to Big Marco, and Coon Key to Caximlms Pas:s, and those of the adjacent isla.ud.s and navigable passes. 111 the hy<lrography, ou the same scale, were embraced the waters just named, and the bars at Urtximha.s lfay Entrance and at Big l\farco Pass. These inside passes are muclt used by vessels of a11out 5 feet llmft, as they affonl a direct and safe passage inside of Cape Uomano, avoiding the long t1istance outside of Cape Homano Shoal. Mr. Bergesheimer staked the passes so that straugers could go through without a pilot. 'l'ida1 stations were established at Caximbas, Coon Key, and Big Marco, 11ench-marks were set at each of these stations with the level, and simultaneous observations of high and low waters made. The tide gauge at Caximbas was connected also with the granite station mark on the hill at ,ToJinson, Cax:imhas Bity. The top of the station mark on this hill is 58.97 feet above zero of the tide gauge at Shell Landing. The hill is the highest on the coast for a long distance. Mr. Hergesheiwer visited the tidal station at Fire Island, and erected a new gauge there, connecting it by a line of levels witb the oltl benuh-mark. Field operations were completed April 15, and on .April 2Ci the schooner was laid up at Fort :M~·ers and the party disbamleu, Mr. Hergesheimer proceeding under instructions to ·wasbiugtou. Early in June he was directe(l to take charge of a party for the survey of the Schoodic I,akes, at the head waters of the St. Croix River, Maine.

PENINSULA OF FLORIDA, WEST COAST, FROM ANCLOTE ANCHORAGE TO PERDIDO BA.Y, INCLUDING COAST APPROACHES, BAYS, AND RIVERS. (SKETCHES Nos. 1, 14, Ul, AND 20).

Triangulati01i, topography and hydrograplty of the upper branches of Escambia ancl East Bays, Pensacola Bay, Florida, for the use of the G'Mlf Coast Nai·y-rard Site Commission.-In pursuance of instructions issued towards the end of November, 1889, Subassistant P. A. Welker proceeded to Pensacola, Fla, early in December of that year, and organized his party for a survey of the tributaries of Pensacola Bay, which was needed for the use of the Gulf Coast Navy-Yard Site Commision. It was desirable to make the triangulation of Pensacola and Penlido Bass one connected scheme, and as many of the points of the old triangulation bad been lost, :Mr. Welker was directed to begin his work on the line Navy-Yard Wharf to Fort Pickens, and extend it to the locality of the topographical work needed. He found it necessary to lay out a new scheme from this line as a base, which was the same as had been used for carrying the triangulation into Perdido and Mobile Bays, in February and March, 1889. ~Vith regard to the country surrounding Pensacola Bay, Mr. Welker remarks that it is very heavily timbered; that the soil consists of a drifting sand, and that in many places there are dem;e and almost impenetrable swamps. In order t-0 avoid these swamps anu the cuttiug of lines through heavy timber, it became necessary to establish the triangulation statious on the sand dunes close to the slmre. The outlines of these dunes being constantls changed by the drifting sand, it was somewhat difficult to mark the stations so as to insure their preservation. Hy February 6, 1890, stations bad been established and signals erected as far as Lora Point on Escambia Bay, and the observations were fini8hed as far as tlle line Emanuel to Hickory, about three miles aooYe tlte city of Pensacola. Here it rested for the season, and the topography and hydrograpby in the vicinity of Pensacola was then taken up. A number of points for this work had been determined by the triangulation 1 and from the stations Post-office and the cupola of the Harbor Master's Building, the geogmphica1 positions of which were known, numerous flags placed in high trees were located. On March 18, the topography and the hydrogra.phy were :finished, and on the 20th the party was disbanded. Following are the statistics reported : Reconnaissance:

attack of malarial fever compelle(l his detachment, February 12. Early-in March, Mr. H. P. Ritter, expert iI! lJhysical hydrography, was assigned, and aided most satisfactorily in briuging the work to a successful conclusion. Service executed by Mr. Welk er, in Ohio, later in the fiscal year, is referred to under a heading in Section XIV. Trianr1ulation, topography, and hydrography of Perdido Bay, Florida and Alabama.. -Reference was ma(le in the last Annual Report to the work executed by the party of Assistant A. T. Mosman on Perdido Bay, Florida and .Alabama. This work involved the la~·ing out of a scheme of triangulation requiring cutting through heavy timber, the erection of observing tripods and scaffolds from twenty to forty feet in height, the occupation of fifteen stations for observations of horizontal angles, and the measurement of au azimuth. For the continuation of the triaugulation, and for the execution of the topography and bydrography of the Bay and its approaches, Assistant Stehman Forney was instructed, towards the end of November, 1889, to organize a party to which were assigned Assistants O. T. Iardella and W'. I. Vinal, with l\fr. E. E. Torrey as foreman, and Mr. M. A. Coles as recorder. Mr. Torrey having been sent on in advance of the rest of the party made all preliminary arrangements for field work, forming a camp on shore, and having the schooner Transit ready at her station for use in local transportation, so that upon Mr. l<'orue,y's arrival at camp, December 20, he was enabled to begin the survey next day. l\fr. farllella was assigned to the topographical work; Mr. Vinal to the bydrography, while Mr. Forney wm'.l chiefly occupieu with the triangulation, at the same time exercising a general supervision over all of the operations. During tlie early part of the season the weather was favorable, and satisfactory progress was achi1wed, but <luring February aud March, 1890, many delays occurred, owing to rain, to fog, and to smoke arising from the frequent forest fires in the vicinity. Ne\·ertheless, during the season of three months, satisfactory results were obtainetl. The triangulation was carried to the mouth of the Perdido H,i....-er, awl a reconnoissance made for the connection of the triangulations of Perdido and l\Iobile Bays; the topography of both shores of Pcrdido Bay was carried to within nine miles of its head; the hydrogra.phy of the approaches was finished, and the interior waters sounded ont as far np as the eud of the topography. The shores thus delineated and the waters sounded embrace not ouly the Bay proper, but also Bay La Launch, Old River, Johnson's Bayou, Cotton Bayou, H.oberts Ba.rou, Ingra.ham's Bayou, and Soldier and Palmetto Creeks. During the last week in the field, Mr. Forney took up a reconnoissance for the connection of the tl'ia,ngnhttion of Perdido Bay with that of Mobile Bay, and found that a practicable scheme of triangles couhl he formell which would connect the work of Assistant Mosman with the old tria11gt1latiou at tlie southeastern extremity of Mobile Bay. This scheme would admit of two or more quadrilaterals, the distance between the two systems of triangulation being but 9 miles, and as tlw timber is small and scattering not much cutting would be needed. Ile examined also the country between the head of Bay La Launch and Mobile Bay, and ascertained that a simple and comparatively inexpensive scheme of triangulation could he carried over that area, should it be deemed preferable to the coast-line system. l<'ield operations were closed under instructions on March 26, the schooner Transit being laid up under charge of a ship-keeper at the Pensacola Navy-Yard, as :~lso the tents, iustrnnH·nts, and camp equipage. Mr. Forney then proceeded with the members of his party to \:Vashingto11. He observes that but little commercial importance attaches to Perdido Bay. It may be described, in general terms, as a wide and irregular-shaped souucl, about l5 miles long, with innumerable ramifications of creeks aml bayous. At its northc>asteru extremity is the mouth of Perdi<lo Rh·er, which peuetrates the interior for about. 40 miles, and with the bay forms the bound:iry on the west of Florida b, t'·ern that State and Alabama. Four miles above its mouth the river bra.nches, sending off an ;i r- o1 to the northwestward, called the Blackwater. One mile

and a half above the confluence with the Blackwater it again divides, the branch running northwesterly being known as the " Styx." The entrance to Perdido Bay is through a very narrow inlet into a lagoon called Old River. The bar is shifting, and has upon it an average depth of 9 feet at mean low water. During the prevalence of southerly winds the cove deepens, uut becomes shallow under the pressure of continued northers. The usual tidal current is about four knots, but during the prevalence of a norther there is no tidal current, the volume of water running constantly seaward. . The channel into the bay, now in general use, is not through Old River (exc~pt during north winds) but through a so-called cut-off, made some 15 years ago by persons living in the locality, through the narrow strip of lowland separating Old R-iver from Orinoco (or Johnson's) Bay. This cut bas now greatly increased in width, and has deepened to 3 fathoms of water, although it was at first but a ditch, 4 feet wide and 4 feet deep. This fact, Mr. Forney observes, is only worthy of mention because if such a scour bas developed in this particular channel, and in such a time, it may have a bearing upon the future of the Bay as a commercial port. At present there is no maritime commerce, the timber (mostly yellow pine, spruce, and live oak) being com·eyed to Millview, at the eastern end of the Bay, where there are two large sawmills with a manufacturing capacity of 200,000 feet a day. These mills belong to the Southern Land and Lumber Uompany, and their sawed lumber is transported to Pensacola by rail. · In closing his report, Mr. Forney expresses his great indebtedness to the experienced and efficient support given him by the officers of his party.

ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA, AND ARKANSAS. INCLUDING GULF COASTS, PORTS, AND RIVERS. (SKETCHES Nos. 1, 12, 14, 19, AXD 20.)

Reconnaissance and occupati-On of stations for the exten1>-ion of tlte primary triangulation fa Ala· bama towards the Gulf of 1Jfe.xico.-Field operations in Alabama for the extension to tbf\ son th ward of the main triangulation were resumed by Assistant F. W. Perkins early in February, 18!JO, in pnrsmmce of instructions issued in the mouth previous. Reconnaissance and the erection of high observing tripods and scaffolds occupied the party until the end of April. ·As a result of a general examination of"the topographical aspect of the country over which the reconnaissance was carried~ Mr. Perkins states that it may be broadly dh·idetl into three zones. The northern zone, drained by the Tennessee River and traversed by the southwestern extremity of the Appalachian clia.in, is almost mountainous.

54

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The middle zone, lying north of the latitude of Montgomery and draining into the Coosa, Tuscaloosa, and Little Tombigbee lli·ers, is traversed by ranges of high bills. The southern zone, which drains into the Alabama, Tombigbee, Coneeuh, and Chattahoochee Rivers, is best described as undulating, but may be further described as consisting of a series of broad, sandy, heavily-wooded plateaux, dividing the drainage; sloping gradually to the south and east and more abruptly to the north and west, with broad alluvial river bottoms which are in the main very flat, but with occasional knolJs or clusters of hills of coarser and heavier material. After these facts had been aseertained, it wai~ decided to rest the eastern line of points on the Alahama-Conecuh tli\·ide, and to take advantage of the accidental elevations in the Alabama bottom for the western points, until by tile narrowing of the bottoms to the southward the divides on either side of the Alabama Hirnr could be matle available. The heavy forests and the almost uniform heights of all the ridges and summit leveis made it often necessary for the reconnoitering officer to be elevated from 100 to 200 feet above the ground, and to effect this most economically and expeditiously, single poles from 3 to 5 inches in diameter were set up and braced by a few sets of guys made of light wire. Upon these poles the observer with his reconnoitering telescope was hoisted to the required height. Mr. W. B. Fairfield, extra observer, was placed in charge of the construction party engaged in erecting observing tripods and scaffolds, and accomplished excellent results with very moderate expenditure of time and money. The reconnaissance ha Ying been extended to a point about 7 miles east of the Alabama River and about 85 miles in a son th westerl,y direction from "Montgomery, it was there rested, and by May 3, all of the signal lights lrndug been posted, the party was at Jamison station reads for observations. TlteHe were completed, though not without much difficulty owing to almost continuous rain arnl fog, by l\Iay 14, and the party was transferred on the next da,y to station \Vilder. Owing to the withdrawal of Mr. Fairfield for other duty at this juncture, and to a series of accidents to the signal lamps, the observations at this 1ioint had not been finished at the close of the fiscal year. In the latter part of June Mr. \V. B. English joined the party, and by his industry and aptness remlered very satisfactory service. The statistics of the work will be given with an account of its progress in the next Annual lteport. At the request of Governor Seay of Alabama, and by direction of the Superintendent, Mr. Perkins established a true Illeritlian line by suitable mo1mments set in the grounds of the State Capitol. This work was done between tlle time of closing the reconnaissance and that of begin. ning the regular observations, the party being then in Montgomery. The necessary astronomical obsen·ations were made May L All the expense of procuring, preparing, and setting the monu· ments was borne by the State. Occupation of statfons for the deteriwination of the magnetic elements in Alabama, JJiississippi, Louisiana, and .Arkansas.-In the course of the magnetic tour of Assistant James B. Baylor, which has heen alrcad~· referred to under a heading in Section III, be occupied in the months of April atHl May, 1890, a number of stations for the determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity in Alabama, MissisRippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas . .At Lake Charles, CalcaRieu County, La., a station was established in the grounds of the Court. honse, in the rear of tile jail, and was securely marked. Tile latitude, longitude, and azimuth were determinetl by obser>atious of the sun ou one day, and tbe magnetic declination, dip, and intensity on another day. At l\Iermenteau, Acadia County, La., a station was established in front of the l\formenteau Hotel, awl securely marked 0 the observations made on two days being similar to those at Lake Charles. Observations of a like character were made at La Fayette, La Fayette Connty, La., on two clays. The station here was estahlished in an open lot in the rear of the Railroad House, and was securely marked. At Natchez, Adams County, Miss., a station was established on the blaft' opposite the Jewish cemetery, within a few feet of tile ''Bache Fund" station occupied by Dr. T. 0. Ililgard in 1872, and as near to it as the changed surroundings would permit. The determinations of the magnetic

elements made by Mr. Baylor will be of valne~ therefore, when compared with Dr. Hilgard's results in ascertaining the rate of change of the declination, dip, and intensity. The stations above named were all occupied in April, 1890; those following in the month of May. At Vicksburg, Warren County, l\Iiss., the Bache Fund statiou, occupied by Dr. Hilgard in 1872, on Castle Hill, was found to he no longer available, a tall iron tower lia>ing lieen built on the hill since that year. A new station was established, therefore, on the eastern edge of Castle Hill, and measurements made to connect it with tlrn old one. Two days were occupied in making the usual observations, and the station was carefully marked. At Greenville, Washington County, Miss., a station was established in tile large open square in the center of the town, and securely marked. The magnetic elements were dr~termiued on one day, and the latitude, longitude, and azimuth by observations on the sun on one day. Similar observations were made on two days at IIelena, Phillip;; County, Ark., where a station was established in the Court-house grounds over the center of a small lead bolt in tlie north meridian stone of the County l\feridian Line. At Oxford, La Fa.yette County, l\Iiss., the Bache Fund station, established by Dr. Hilgard in 1872 in the baseball grounds south of the campus of the University of .Mississippi, was re occupied, and the usual observations made on two days. The point was securely marked. At Florence, Lauderdale Couut;r, Ala., lllr. Baylor re-occupied the station at which he had determined the magnetic elements iu 1881. The point is in the grounds of the l'resbyterian Female Seminary, and bad been well preserved. The usual two days obser>atlons were made. From Florence Mr. Baylor proceeded in June, 1890, to Ilnntsville, Madison County, Ala., where be established a magnetic station in Spring Park, and marked it Becurely. The usual obsen·ations were made on two days. Other magnetic stations occupied by l\lr. Baylor are reforred to under lwadiugs in Sections HI, IX, and XIII. Extension of lines of geodetic leveling from Lonilon, Pope Coirnty, A t·k., to Fort Smith, Sebastian Ooiinty.-The lines of leveling of precision in the State of Arkansas begun in September, 1887, in compliance with a request from Prof. J. C. Branner, Director of the Geological Sur\·ey of tliat State, and carried westward from the :Mississippi River, bad reached London, Pope County, in the autumn of 1888. Towards the cud of June, 1889, Assistant Isaac "'inston was directt~d to organ· ize a party for the extension of these lines to Fort Smith, near the western boumlary of the State. Mr. Winston reached Little Hock Jul~, 19, and was joined there by SnbassistallL J. 11. Gray, and by Mr. F. A. Young, recorder. Tlte party was immediately orgm1izt·ll, and the leveling obser· vatious were begun July 24. Two new geodetic leveli;;, l\os. 5 arnl 6, anll four new le>eling rods, L, M, N, and 0, had been furnished for use in the °"or1:, and the constantR of these wen~ at once detf>rmined. Tbe plan of operations invol>ed the running of two separate liues of le\·els in opposite directions by two observers. l\Ir. Winston made the forward measurement, and Mr. Gra;v the backward one until September 11, when he was relieved from duty in the party, and :'.\Ir. Young placed in charge of the backward measure, l\Ir. H. D. Mitchell of Hot Springs, Ark., being made recorder in place of l\lr. Young. The route was along the Little Ifock and Fort Smith Railroad, and the party was exposed at all times to the full effect of the sun's beat. During the observations the instrument was shaded with an umbrella, and while being carried from one i;;tation to anotller it was covered with a white cloth. The striding level of geodetic level l\ o. tl lJeing tlie least sensitive, that iustrument and rodi-; J, and 1VI were used almost exclusively in the progress of the work. It was found that the striding level required frequent adjm1tme11t, until the wooden wedges which kept tl1e le>el >ial in position were removed and the vial fixed iu place by plaster of Paris. The wedges after being wet during showers of rain would shrink in drying, and hence change the Jewel adjustment. After October 10 Mr. Winst-0n made the measurements in both directions himself, fearing that otherwise the allotment of funds for the work would be exhausted before Fort Smith was reached. Fortunately the lines were completed October 22, without exhausting the allotment. The reoord was made in ink, and the computath>n of the results kept up from day to day, so

that the necessary comparison between the measures could be made, and assurance obtained that the limits for error were not exceeded. Temporary bench.marks were established at intervals of 1 kilometre (about), and permanent bench-marks in all the towns and villages along the railroad. At Van Buren, Crawford County, three bench·marks were established, this being the proper point for starting tbe lines of precise le\·eling which will form a junction with the transcontinental line at Kansas Uity, 1.fo. The Arkansas River was crossed at Van Buren, the instruments and rods being placed on the stone piers of the railroad bridge outside of the superstructure. At Fort Smith, the end of the line, two bench-marks were established. During the season the elevations of all county-road crossings, and those of the railroad stations along the line were determined by holding the rod on the ground in the center of the track at the crossings and in front of the buildings at the railroad stations, making tbe,se points e.r:tra foresights in the forwar!l measure. A bench-mark notice, printed on linen, was postC!l near each permanent bench-mark. Much interest was shown in the work by the people along the route, and a general desire was expressed to obtain the published results as soon as possible. After the close of the work a complete list of all the elevation;; deduced b.Y the field computation was furnished to Professor Brauner, State geologist, umler authority from the Superintendent. Mr. F. A. Young, as recorder and observer, served with ability; Mr. H. D. Mitchell's services as recorder were also entirclr satisfactorv. Mr. Winston transferr~d bis party to Greenfiehl, Ten~., immediately after finishing the Arkausas work, anll took up under instructions field duty, which will be referred to m1der a heading in Section XIII. flyilrographic suneys on the coast of Louisiana, trest of the Passes of the Mississippi.-The party in charge of Lieutenant A. L. Ilall, U.S. N., .Assistant Coa~t and Geodetic SurYey, commanding the steamer Endcm:or, arri rnd at their working ground, west of the Passes of the Mississippi, December 16, 1889. Shore signals for the hydrograpby were built, and a tide-gauge established, at Ship Shoal Light House, but owing to continued fog and haze, no lines of soundiugs were run until .January 11, 18~)0. The work laid out for the season was the off-shore and in-shore hydrograpby of the coast of Lomsiana between Barataria Bay and Ship Shoal, the off-shore work being deemed the most important, an<l to be auvanced as rapidly as vossible, while the in-shore work was to be carried on at snch times as would interfere lea3t with soundings from the ship. In running the Jines to Sliip Shoal, much !lifficnlty was experienced, as the currents between it and Isle Derniere, aud outside of the shoal, were so variable in strength an<l direction that no allowance could be made for them, besides which the swell upon the shoal was so great that Lieutenant. Ila,ll deemed it unwise to put the ship on it unless under the most fav-0rable conditions. Bnt little change in the general outline of the shoal appeared to be developed by the soundings. The passage between Ship Shoal and Isle Derniere was well marked by the soruulings and character of the bottom, and can be used to mhantage while standing to the eastward or northward when a nortllcr is blowing, as it gives srnootll water. From the observations of day tides at Sllip Shoal J,ight House between January 6 and May 15, Lieutenant Hall fountl tlJat tlrn range of the tide and the times of lligb and low water were much influenced by the wind. The set of the current w:1s as a rule westerly, though frequent interruptions took place, usually followed by a cbange of wintl. Much fog and haze were experienced in the early part of the season, witll but little rain; during the latter part the winds became fresh and steady, generally from the southeast. The heaviest squalls tllougli were from north to northwest. As late as May 3 every tripod signal on the coast was blown down by one of these squalls. Field operations were closed under instruc.tions on May 15, and Hie Endeavor was taken north, stopping at New Orleans for sligbt repairs to boiler am.l engine, and at Cape Florida for a 11ydrographic examination, the result of which is reported under a heading in Section VI. Ensigns John F. Lnhy, F. H. Brown, and Thomas Washington, U.S. N., were attached to the party on the Endeavor, the officer last named during part of the season.

Reconna-issanoe and triangulation on the coast of Loui.~iana, between Atchajalaya and Cote Blanohc Bavs.-By instructions dated December IO, 188!1, the reconnaissance and triangulation needed to connect the survey of the eastern part of .Atcl.mfalaya Bay with that of Cot~ Blanche Day, on the south coast of Louisiana, wa,s assigned to Assistant U. H. Iloy1l. As soon as the repairs required to put the steamer Hilchcock in cont.lition for service could be completed, Mr. Boyd orgauizetl his party on board tliat vessel, and took up the reconnaissance and triangulation in Atchafalaya Bay, from the line Deer Island-Point au Fer. The marks for these stations were found to correspoud with the dnscriptions, and had apparently been nmlisturhed. The triangulation was then carried westward over the Atchafalaya and Cote Blanche Bays by a series of quadrilaterals as well conditioned as the marshy character of the coast would allow, until a connection had been made with the work of Assistant Perkins, in 1889, in the eastern part of Vermilion Bay, upon the line Shell-Gracious. E\·itleuces of washing shore-lines were found everywhere within the area of this work. Details of Uie difficulties which attended the recovery and the marking of the several points are given by Mr. Boyd in his r~port. Tlte very unstable nature of the ground along this coast matle it desirable to increase the usual number of oosen·atious, and to make them at as many epochs as possible. Each angle in. the main series of triangles was therefore measured by eight sets of six repe.titions each; each line from a station was measured with every other line afffmling the greatest number of summation angles, and. the circle was filled at ever,y angle, so that at stations having six others connecting with them there were 1,440 pointings. Mr. Boyd was indebted to M.r. Jobn 0. Scannell, proprietor of the lar~c sugar plantation on. Cote Blanche, for a list of loeal names which are in more common use than a number of those given on the publishe<l charts. . The work was seriously delayed and many of the observations were made under quite unfavorable conditions of haze and fog due to the over1low waters from the Mississippi crevasses. Assistant R. A. Marr joined the party March 1, and was detached May 6. Mr. Boyd expresses himself as greatly indebted to Mr. Marr for most cordial and effieient aid. Field operations were closed l\lay 9.

Establishment of a se?f-rcgistering inngnetic aiiparatvs at a station in San Antonio, Tex.-The completion of a record of changes in the magnetic force during a 1ieriod of 7 years at the magnetic obsern1tory at r,os Angeles in October, 1889, is referred to under a heading in Section X, and as there stated, Assistant n. E. Halter, who had been in charge of the obsen·atory since February, 1877, having been directed to pack the instruments and forward them to Sau Antonio, Tex., bad completed this duty October 23. On the 27th he reached San Antonio, and transferred the instruments to the new magnetic observatory which had been built earlier in the year within the grounds of the United States Military Reservation. He re1lorted his arrival to General D. S. Stanley, U. S. A., commanding the Department of Texas, and began tlte frnal arrangements needed for beginning the record with the Adie magnetographs. But owing- to severe illness Mr. Halter was compelled to suspend his work, and wbeu it becawe evident tl.Iat some time would elapse before he could take it up again, Assistant Andrew 13raid was relieved of the charge of the Instrument Division of the Office by instructions issued iu December, and directed to proceed to San Antonio, and set up aml adjust the magnetographs, and begin the magnetic record. Mr. Braid arrived at San Antonio early in January, 1890, and after having made some slight a.Iterations in and repairs to tl.Ie observatory buildings, he marked the direction of the magnetic meridian on the north and south walls of the magnet room, and of tbe magnetic prime vertical on the east and west walls. The direction of the magnetic meridian being then marked for the unifilar and bifilar piers, and that of the prime vertical verified, threads were stretched between these various points and the suspensions of the unifilar aad bifilar magnetometers were accurately placed by means of the iatersections. The slate slabs connectiug the three instrument piers with the cylinder pier were leveled in the same horizontal plane, and secured in position. The marble slabs supporting the instruments proper were also carefully leveled, and the fixed mirror of each was adjusted. Tl1e lamps, lenses, slits, and condensers were adjusted without difficulty, as were also the reading telescopes and scales. For the unifilar and bifrlar instruments the suspensions used at Los Angele.<> were again utilized. The brass torsion weight was SL1spended continuously for a number of days, and by means of the graduated torsion head, and after the elimination of torsion, the axis of the brass weight was accurately placed in the magnetic meridian. The magnet was then substituted for the weight and tile mirror adjustment completed. Mr. Braid made careful determinations of the weights, in grains, of the several parts of the apparatus used in obtaining >alues for the instrumental constants. Ile expresses his obligations t-0 the steward of the Military Hospital for the loan of a very good balance and set of weights. The results of his weighings are st:Lted iu fall in his report; also the values which he found for the instrumental constants, and tlie methotl.s of procedure adopted. :For the Yertical-force magnet no satisfactory adjustment coultl be effected; it was therefore taken to \Vashington, and at the office a thorough examination, made by JUr. Braid, discovered defocts in its original construction, as well as injluies resulting from deteriorntion of the agate plane antl knife-edge. These ha,-ing been remedied and the instrument practically reconstructed, it was returned to Saa Antonio and ha8 since been working satisfactorily. On March 17 the photographic record of changes in magnetic force was begun, and has been continued without interruption to tile close of the fiscal year. Absolute determinations of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made during tlirce days of each month, anu observations for time whenever needed. The geographical position of the Observatory was determined by connecting it trigouometrically with the tower of the Military Depot, tile latitude and longitude of which were known. The metal rod on the summit of this tower was made available for an azimuth mark in the determinations of the magnetic declination.

In April Mr. L. G. Schultz was assigned to duty a.t the Observatory, &nd was trained in the manipulation of thl~ instruments, both differential and absolute, and in making the observations, with the nuderstanding that lie should act as assistant to Mr. Halter, and in c~1.se of emergency take charge of the Observatory. , Ou the 23d of l\fay l\1r. Braid in pursuance of instrnctions, turned over the direction of the work to Mr. Halter (whose health had then much improved) and proceeded to \\T ashington, where he wn.s occupied for a time, as already stated, iu au examination and reconstruction of the vertical-force magnetometer. On June JG he was assigned to duty as Executive Officer in the office of the Superintendent. In liiR report of the San Antonio work, Mr. Braid expresses his appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. llaJtt,r. A report from the latter officer has been received, acknowl· edgiug the able services of Mr. Schultz, and presenting statistics of the ouserrntions made at Los Angeles aud at San Ant-0nio for the portions o(the fiscal year duriug which the records at those stati011s were kept up.

Occupation of stations in Texas for tke dcterininatfot~ intensity.-The magneLic tour, plannerl for Assistant James B. Baylor, by instructionB dated
December 13, 1889, included the occupation of a number of stations in Texas for the determina· tion of the magnetic elements. Early in January, 1890, Mr. Baylor proceeded to Washington for couferencc with the Super· intendent, and thence to Corpus Christi, Nueces County, Tex., where he established a station in the open space at the foot of a maiu street of the town. The latitude, longitude, and azimuth were determined by observations of tlw sun on one day, and the declination, tlip, and intensity by observations on another day. The station was securely marked. Similar observations wcirti made on two tlays at Beeville, Bee County, Tex., where a station was established in the grounds of th<~ Court-house and carefully marked. Also at San Diego, Dnval County, Tex., the station being located in the Court-llouse grounds. At Peiia Station, Dtffal County, observations were made at a station established in the open space to the north of the railroacl depot, the work occupying, as usn:tl, two days, one for the determination of latitude, longitude, and azimuth, and one for the arnguetic declination, dip, and intensity. The stations above named were all occupied in January, 18!JO. At Laredo, Webb County, Tex., in February, a station was established at Fort "Mclntosb, in the open space near the house of the commanding officer, and securely marked. Two days were occupied here in determinations of the magnetic elements, and one in obserTatious on the sun for latitude, longitude, and azimuth. At Cotulla, La Salle County, Tex., two days' observations were made at a station established in the grounds of the Court-house, and .;;ecurely marked. At Eagle Pass, Maverick County, Tex., a station was established in the open space south of the office of the commanding officer of Fort Dnncan. aud was carefo!Iy marked. The usual two days' observations were made. ' Also at Sanderson, Pecos Connty, where a station was established iu the opeu space north of the railroad hotel, and carefully marked.

Also at Langtry, Val Verde County, where a station was established and securely marked just south of Camp Langtry on the bluff near the Rio Grande River. Also at Spofford Junction, Kinney County, the station selected being in an open lot adjoining the United States Post-office building. This was the last station, the occupation of which was completed in February, 1890. At the end of February and at the beginning of March a station was occupied at Port Lavaca, Calhoun County, Tex., the declination, dip, and intensity being determinecl by observations on two dayR, and the latitude, longitude, and azimuth by observations on one day on the sun. A site was selected and securely marked in the Court-house grounds. Ill l\larch a station was established at 'Wharton, Wharton County, Tex., in the Court-house groundR. It was occupied for two days and carefully marked. At Austin, Travi,:; County, Tex., Mr. Baylor re-occupied the station which he had established in 1878 near the Texas Land Office. It was found to be in a good state of preservation. The latitude and longitude and the meridian line which had been established by Assistant Eimbeck were used, and the magnetic elements were determined by observations on two clays. At La Grange, Fayette Couuty, Tex., a station wa,s established in the Court-house grounds and secnrely marked. The magnetic elements were determined by obsen~ations on one day. A meridian line for the county wa8 laid out here and securely marked by bolts set in solid stone posts which were supplied and set by the county authorities. Latitude, longitude, ancl azimuth were determined on one day by observations of the sun. The last station occupied by .Mr. Baylor, in March, 1890, was at Galveston, 'l'ex. Observations were ma!le at a point selected at the bead of Fremont st1'eet, in the rear of the Beach House, -on one day for latitude, longituLle, and azimuth, and on two da;ys for declination, dip, and intensity. At Houston, Harris County, Tex., in April, 1890, a new station was established in the Fair Grounds west of the city, and after two days occupation was carefully marked. The usual obRervations for two days were made also at a station established at Columbia, Brazoria County, 'l'ex., in an open lot in the rear of the Presbyterian church. Also at a station established in the Court-house grounds at Beaumont, Jefferson County, Tex. Also at a station established in the Court-house grounds at Liberty, Liberty County, Tex. Mr. Baylor's last station in Texas was occupied in April, at Orange, Orange County. A station was established here in au open space at the intersecting streets in front of the Curry House, and, as wer<' all other stations, was securely marked. The observations were completed in two days. Other magnetic stations which be occupied are mentioned under headings in Sections III, VIII, and XIII.

Completion of tlte topographic survey of the south coast of California, between Sari Diego and San Onofre.-Reference was made in the last Annual Report to the resumption of topographic work Oil the south coast of California by the party in charge of Assistant A. F. Rodgers in May, 1889. At the beginning of the fiscal year plane-table work was in progress upon a sheet projected to include the coast aud vicinity to the north and south of Del Mar. Mr. Rodgers observes that the topography in this vicinity is ext_remely broken and complex in character, and that this is a characteristic feature of the larger part of the coast margin of San Diego County. l\Vork was continued upon the Del Mar sheet until July 22, and the party was then trane· .ferrcd to La Jolla, 10 miles to the s:mth. Here the sheet projected to include the. villago al1d vicinity of La Jolla and Pacific Beach was taken up. T11is locality is marked by the hill known as Soledall J\Iountain. It is 812 fed in elevation above sea.level and forms a prominent landmark for the mariner in approaching San Diego Bay from the northward. This summit, with its western extremity, was known to the old Spanish navigators as "Punta Falsa," or False Point, from its

dangerous resemblance to Point Loma, the headland of San Diego J3ay, and for which it was sometimes mistaken. During the months of August and September the topographical survey was continued over the !:!lopes of Soledad Mountain and to the eastward of Rose Uailon, through which the branch of the Santa Fe Railroad known as the California Central or Southern H.ailroall reaches tlie bay of San Diego from the northward. Upon the completion of the La .Jolla plane-table sheet: October 2, the party was transferred on the afternoon of that day to San Diego, and was employed for a week in making additious to the original topographical sheets of San Diego Bay, chiefly new wharves, and also the line of the Uoronallo Belt Railroad around the shore of the bay. The results of this work of rcvisiou were forwartled to \Vashington in November to be maue available for publication in a new edition of the \lhart of San Diego Bay. While in San Diego l\Ir. Rodgers visited the entrance to the bay and determined the position of the new faght-l1ouse on Point Loma, and also the road leading from that Light-house to tbe Government landing at Ballast Point Co>e. On October 9 the })arty was transferrer! by the coast wagon road to Oceanside, and on the 14th work was beg11n upon the topography in the vicinit,Y of Las Flores, and coutinued until November 18. On November 20 the quarters of tlle pa.rt.r were established in a deserted cabin in the Sau Onofre Valley, the location of which exactly suited the requirements of the work. Soon after beginning the San Onofre sheet, the rniny season set in with vigor, aml the ordinarily dry bed of the Sau Onofre Creek, which the party had to cross on their way to meals, became a torrent. l\fr. Rodgers observes that he was not unduly impressed at such times witl.J the improYident waste of water, millions 01 gallons rn:;;hing to the ocean as the result of every rainstorm, while during the dry season of summer the thirsty crops wither from lack of moisture and the only recourse of the settler, in many parts of the south:coast counties, for his daily family supply is a horse and sletl and a water barrel. In former reports Mr. Rodgers has called attention to the San Onofre as one of the streams which could be readily utilizell in developing the water supply of San Diego County. The topograph,Y of the ridges of the San Onofre l\Iountain, the summit of which is l,720 feet above sea level, occupied the party dllriug the montl.J of Nm-ember. This "mountain," so called, is really a ridge about 5 miles in length, forming a promiuent landmark looking north or sonth .along Urn coast. Its axis is nearly parallel to the coast line; its sea-front is bordered by fiat tablelands, from which long ridges flanked by deep gorgas reach back to the main ridge; this breaks down abruptly on its eastern face, giving marked evidence of some displacement of mass, eithel' from earthquake or deluge, in the remote past. San Onofre is cut nearly down to sea level on the north by the valley of the same name, aad on the south by Horno Canon. During November, although there hatl been a heavy rainfall, the precipitation had been generally at night, and field work was not seriously interfered with, but by the middle of December the rains had become almost continuous and the soil so saturated with water that the pack· animals would bog down on the grassy slopes of the mountain, and under such conditions progress. was necessarily slow. Finally, howevel', the San Onofre sheet was completeu, and on December 22 Mr. Rmlgers began his arrangements for leaving the field. These were not canietl out without many (}ifficnlties and annoying delays, owing to tho swelling of the streams, wrr,sh-nut.s, and carrying a was of bridges on the railroads, and other effects of heavy rainfall, resulting in a temporary suspension of freight and passenger transportation. From the 25th to the 31st of December the party was hopelessly weather.bound at Capistrano, and it was not till January 6 that passenger-train service was resumed to the northward from Los Angeles. On that day Mr. Rodgers left for San Francisco, arriving there the next day wi~h bis aid, Mr. John Nelson. The efficient service rendered by l\Ir. Nelson throughout the seasou is acknowledged by his chief. For the four topographical sheets which cover the coast line and vicinity from La Jolla to

In addition to the above there were surveyed at San Diego Bay 3 miles of shore line and 14 miles of railroad, and in the course of the determination of the new light-house site at Point Loma, 1 milP- of railroad and 3 of wagon roads. Duty assigned to Mr. Rodgers later in the fiscal year is referred to under a subsequent headiug in this section. Connection of the Los Angeles primary base line 1oith the main triangulation in s01ithern California. Preparations for the ocoupation of Alount Oonness.-The measurement of the Los Angeles primary !Jase-line in the winter of 1888-'89 by the party in charge of Assistant. George DaYidson was referred to in the last Annual Report, and a full account of it by Mr. Davidson was imblishetl as Appendix No. 10 to that volume. In the spring of 1890 be was prepared to take the field in pursuance of instructions issued in March of that year, to make the observations required at the ends of the base in order to connect it with the main triangulation. The beginning of the work was delayed by the almost impassable condition of the roads resulting from the heavy and incessant rai\}s of the previous winter. Iu April Assistant J. ,J. Gilbert was directed to report for duty to Mr. Davidson and was assigned to the charge of the fielrl observations at the ends of the base. Sub-assistant Isaac Winston rcporte<l for duty soon after. Mr. Gilbert occupied first the Southeast Base st.ation and obser\ed all the horizontal directions. The triangulation developed from the base line by a quadrilateral on either side; tl10 heights of the stations extend from the base line at about 100 feet to Mount Wilson at about 6,200 feet. The fogs J)roved to be a great hindrance to rapid work, but all of the directions ne,ecled were obtainerl. For this work :Mr. Davidson increased the number of positions of the theodolite to 47, one observation direct and one reversed being made in each position. Some observations for latitude and azimuth were also undertaken by Mr. Gilbert to a1low of preliminary computations, but the series was badly broken by reason of fogs that came over the low country early in the night and cut off work. Meanwhile Mr. Winston was detached to make a series of levelings between Northwest Base station and the tidal bench-mark at San Pedro Harbor. This he did both ways and then established two permanent bench·marks at San Pedro for future reference. Towards the eml of May, the observations at Southeast Base, which included also vertical angles and the determination of the magnetic elements, were completed, and the party was transferred to Northwest Base. Here the weather proved more favorable; the horizontal directions were soon finished; vertical angles and the magnetic elements were observed, and upon two or three nights observations for latitude were made. The time and azimuth observations were not completed, the advance of the season making it necessary to push forward the preparations for the occupation of the primary triangulation station, Mount Conness. On the 17th of June Assistant Gilbert moved the party from Northwest Base station to Oakdale, beyond Stockton, the end of rail towt1rds Conness, and after conference with Mr. Davidson he moved to the front. AH:,;i:-;taui J. S. Lawi>on aml Subassistant Fremont Morse forwarded from the Suboffice all the necessary camp equipage and extra instruments for the Mount Conness work. Mr. .Morse then mon~d to the front. In approaching Conness, Messrs. Gilbert, Winston, and Morse encountered snow a.nd bad roads at a poi11t 43 miles west of Soda Springs in the Tuolumne Meadows.

An account of the occupation of this important primary station is necessarily deferred to the next fiscal year. Completion of tke record of clwnges of nu1111wtio force at the self-registering station, Los Angeles, Oal.-A continuous record, without any serious interruption, of the changes of ruagnetic force having been obtained by means of the Adie magnetographs at Los Angeles, Cal., from October 1, 1882, to October 1, 1889, Assistant R. E. Halter, who had lH',en in charge of the Magnetic Observatory since February, 1887, was directed to pack the instruments and forward them to San Antonio, Tex., proceeding there himself to set them up again and adjust them at the station which had been previously selected there. The period of 7 years during which the magnetic changes had been recorded at Los Angeles, covering nearly two-thirds of a sun-spot cycle, include1l the time of minimum sun-spot actiYity supposed to ham occurred early in the year 1889. In Appen1lices Nos. 8 aml 9 to this volume, the results of an elaborat-0 discussion of hoth absolute and differential measures of the magnetic force as derived from the observations at Los Angeles are presented by Assistant Schott. Before <listurbing the instruments, Assistant Halter redetermined the scale values, and remeasured the astronomical azimuth of the mark. By the 23d of October he had completed and forwarded to the Office all of the records of the Los Angeles work, original and duplicate, and had sent to l::lan Antonio all of the instruments and apparatus pertaining to the Ohsen'atory. Hefernnce to the estalJlishment of the instruments at the San Antonio Observatory is made under :t be:.uling- iu Section IX. Completion of a hydrographic &1trvey iii the vicinity of Pie11ra.~ Blancas, coast of California, incliwling the development of rocks in T1cin Peak Bay.- Under tlw date of .May 2~, 1890, Lieut. D. Delehanty, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commarnliug tbe steamer Hassler, reports the completion of the bydrography in the ''icinity of Piedras Blancas, coast of California, assigned to him by instructions dated October 17, 1889. From the northern end, near San Simeon Harbor, the character of tbis part of the coast is irregular for a distance of 6Jl: miles to the signal vVllite, the shore being low and thiekly wooded. Thenoo for 13 miles to thn signal Kan, at the limit of the hydrographic sheet, it is a rauge of barren hills terminating in low land, the shore line throughout consisting of low day bluffs. The general set of the current, Lieutenant Delehanty observes, is southerly, ranging from one-fourth of a. knot im:.ide of the 10-fathom curve to a half knot out::;ide of this cur·e. No dangers exist inside of the kelp line, which extends from half mile to three-quarters of a mile from the Rhure, and the least water on thi'S line is 8 fathoms. Inside of the kelp line the bottom is mostly rocky. From this line, or the 10.fathom cun'e, to the 100-fathom curve the depth of water is marked by a regular increase. Between the IO-fathom and the 30-fathom curves, the character of tlle bottom is variable, consisting of mud, sa.nd, broken shells, a]}(l bard bottom. Where specimens were not obtMned with the cup, an armed lead generally indicat.ed a layer of fiue sand. Between the .30-fathom and the 100-fathom curves, the bottom is principally green mud and saud. There are no possible harbors within the limits of this survey; landings might be constructed, bnt it is highly improbable that they will be, owing to the proximity of San Simeon to the north and Oayucos to the south, both of which are very fair summer harbors, but are dangerous anchorages dnring the winter in the southerly gales. Soundings were taken for the development of a rock and a rock awash in Twin Peak Bay (or Oovc) about half way between Piedras Blancas and the Sur. 'rhe officers attached to the party were Lieut. C. A. Gove, U. S. N., executive officer ; Ensign Guy W. Brown, U.S. N. (part of the season), Ensigns J.P. McGuinness and W. L. Dodd, U.S. N., Ensign E. Moale, jr., U.S. N.

Connection of the coa~t triangulation south of Monterey Bay irith tlle main series.-Acting under geueral instructions to take up at as early a date as was expedient the connection of the coast triangulation south of l\Ionterey Bay with the main series, Assistant A. F. Rodgers made all preparations needed for the organization and eguipment of his party in the field, and left. San Francisco April 17 for Toro Station, one of the points in the main series. l\Jr. Rodgers, with his aid, Mr. Jolin Nelson, had been continuously employed from January till early in March in the inking of his topographic sheets of the south coast of California, and in making the on time tracings of these objects needed for file in tbe su bofficc. Be found it necessary tbe11 to occups part of his time with the details of preparation for the field, and on the 20th of March to go to Jolon and thence to Pacific Valley to inform himself persoually respecting the requirements of the work. Soon after returning to San Francisco he was summone<l by telegram to meet Assistant Charles 1\1. Bache at Beuicia, under the painful conditions atteu<laut upon the serious illness of that officer, resulting, on the Hlth of April, in bis death. Heue<:l it was not till April 17 that he could reach Toro Station. After erecting a signal there he proceeded to station Pico Blanco, 30 miles south of Monterey. The building of signals was continued <luring the month of May, and two stations, Pico .Blanco, 3,700 feet in height, and Manuel, 3,300 ieet, both near the coast, were occupied. Directions to stations of the coast triangulation of 1875 and to those of the revised scheme were observed. While Mr. Rodgers was occupying stations, Mr. Nelson was frequently detached to build new signals. Cooper, Sur River, and Pfoiffer's Point were occupied in succession. This, Mr. Rodgers ou:servcs, may he called a climatic voint or local barrier to the northwest winds and fogs which are so characteristic of the coast from San Francisco southward. North of Pfeiffer's Poi11t, along the coast line, a clear day iu summer is tlie exception, and in tlle vicinity of Point Sur the fog born of the Light-House Establishment is a reminder night and da;y to the coasting mariner that be must depeml on sound, rather than sight, in keeping a close offing from the shore. South of Pfeiffer's Point, and on the bight between that and Cape San Martin, the r.oast line and hills aro as a rule bathed in sunshine, and the temperatures are frequently as high as !Joo to 1000 F., while between Pfeiffer's Point and the Sur tlic coast is covered with a dense mantle of fog. This foature Mr. Hodgers noted specially, not alone as causing delay in his work, but in watching the coasting steamers bound north, hugging the shore south of Pfeifi'er's Point in order to amid the heavy northwest wind and sea 2 or 3 miles off shore, and coasti11g so close as to suggest the need of a very careful hydrographic examination of this locality when tbe bydrograpby is in bantl in order to de,·e!op any dangers not now known to exist. Work was not closed at l'feiffer's Point until June 16, as it was often necessary to dismount the theodolite, drop the observing tent upon tl10 ground and weight it down to prevent its being blown away. The wind frequently reached a velocity of from 30 to 35 miles per hour. The stations next occupied were Rico (which took the })lace of .Blank Ridge on the old sc!Jeme), Timber Ridge, Castro, Anderson Station, Anderson P0int, and Little River Bill. Witli the occupation of this last named station, a satisfactory connection was completed between the triangulation of 1875 and that now in progress. Cp to June 21, 1890, eleven stations bad been occupied, at which 1,617 pointings had been made. After that date and to the close of the fiscal year, the party was engaged in traveling and building signals. Supplies for the men and forage for the pack animals bad to be carried and long detours often macle to reach points near each other, but separated by impassable caiions. The progress of the work will be again adverted to in the next annual report. Topographical surt·ey of the coast of California in the vicinity of Point Sttr.-Report is made under a heading in Section XI of the surveys executed by Assistant Cleveland Rockwell in Young's Bay and on the Columbia River, Oregon and Washington. After finishing this work and completing and forwarding to the office the records and results relating to it, he took up in the spring a reduction of topography for a new edition of the chart of the approaches to New York

Harbor. This having been completed and sent to the Office, he left Portland, April 3, under instructions to report to Assistant George Davidsou for duty in bis party organized for the connection of the primary bast'l line at Los Angeles, Cal., with the main triangulation. Mr. Rockwell had forwarded tlie camp outfit, got the party into camp at Southeast Base, and aided in the erection of an observing pier and tower at that station, when he receirnd instructions to return to San Francisco and take charge of the topographical party left without a chief by the sudden demise of Assistant Charles M:. Bache. Mr. Rockwell thereupon took up the prep:i.rations needed for the work of this party, which was to co-01rnrate with that of Assistant Rodgers on the coast of Monterey County, Cal. Leaving San Francisco May 11 he arrived the same day at Jo1on, and proceelled thence to Pacific Valley, his field of work, reacliiug there on the GtlJ. Oamp was immediately }Jitcbed and the topographical surrny begun. It was carried on u11<ler the general direction of Ai,;sistant Rodgers, with whom Mr. Rockwell frequently conferred by letter. Owing to the almost constant prevalence of foggy weather during the month of May, bnt small progress could be made. To supplement the waut of geographical positions for the co11trol of the topography, a plane-table triangulation was laill out, but the exceedingly rough and mountaivous character of the country and the necessity of moving the instruments on mule back between every two plane-table stations made it impracticable to acco:nplish more than the survey of about 3;! miles of ocean shore line, and an area of 6 square statute miles. The last camp of the season was at an elevation of 3,300 feet above sea level an<l barely two miles from shore. At oue 1>lace ~i height of 2,000 feet in the slope of the mountain gave an angle of elevation of 321 degrees or 2~ degrees more than the graduated arc on the alidade. Field operations. were closed June 16, and after disposing of the property and the animals, Mr. Rockwell proceeded to San Francisco. Genemt direction of land operations upon the Pacific coast~Obscrnations of ,moon culminations at San Franci.~co in connection with similar obsel'vations by the Alaska Bound,ary parties-Main triangulation, etc.-Assistant George Davidson coatinued in general charge of the land operations of the Survey upon the Pacific coast. Ile submitted to the Superintendent general plans for the prosecution of the work; examined all estimates and referred them to the Superintendent; conferred with the officers on duty ou that coast, aml received and transmitted all official correspondence between them and the Superintendent. Following is an abstract of his annual report, which gives a resume of the several classes of work carried on by him or under his direction <luring the fiscal year. Having been appointed by the Presitleut as a Delegate ou the part of the Unitecl States to the Ninth Conference of the International Geodetic Association held at Paris, Oetoher 3 to 12, 1889, Mr. Davidson was instructed early in August of that year to make all preparations needful for the temporary assignment of an officer to the charge of the Suboffice at San Francisco, and to proceed to Washington for conference with the Superinte11dent, and thence to Paris. After receiving from the Superi11tendeut special instructions under date of September 7, governing bis action as Delegate, he left New York September 10, and returnecl to Washington November 15.

This series of moon culminations extended from December 23, 1889, to April 10, 1890. In addi· tion to making these observations, l\fr.l\forse attended to his regular office duties. He reduced all of the work, and transmitted the results with the original and duplicate records to the Office . .iJiain triang1.Zation, southern California, and preparations for the ocCU]Jation of 1llount Oonness.Referencc to this work, which involved tlie occu1mtion of the ends of tlie Los Angeles Base, and the advance towards .Mount Conness, has been made under the second hNoding in this section. Tidlfl recora continual at the automatic tidal station, Sausalito, Ba11 of San Francisco-Temporary antomatic ti1lal st<itiun established at llris.sfon ,')trect Wha1:f, city of San J?ranci.sco.-The tidal record at the automatic tidal station Sausalito, San Francisco Bay, was continued under the direction of :Mr. Davidson, except during his absence, from August 25 till December 12, 1889, when Assistant Lawson was in charge. Mr. Emmet Gray rerrn1ined as ohserver. Eacll month's tidal roll and the tabulations of the observer are examined before being forwarded to the Offiee. On September 17, 18?;9, awl January ~-m, 11'\!IO, 8ulJassistaut Morse made the le\elings between the two bench-marks ~tnd the zero of the gauge to guard against any possible change i u the sinking of the piling. He visited the tide-gauge also to examine tlie condition of the pier and observing hnt. The transit observations for determining the error and rate of the tidal chronometer were made by l\Ir. F. ,Y. Edmonds, at the astronomical station, Lafayette Park, San Francisco. In order to obtain tile times and heights of the tides at the city front, aml also to establish a zero for the reduction of sonndiugs in that part of the uay, Mr. Davidson made all the preparations for putting np an automatic tide-gauge at :Mission Street Wharf. On his departure for Europe, Mr. Lawson took chargl\ of the execution of the work. A temporary observinp; lrnt was erected on the wharf by permission of the State Harbor CommiRsioners, and a hench-ma.rk established for reference. Subassistant l\lorse connected this bench-mark by levelings each way with tho three old tidal beneh-marks of Fort Point. The record was kept up from :September 28 to December 15, during which time the climatic conditions happened to be somewhat abnormal, so that it is not improbable that a more extended series will hanl to be obsern~d. Andrew 'Vikman had charge of the gauge under tlie immediate ey'3 of l\fr. Morse, by whom all the work was tabulated. Mr. Davidson acknowledges the facilities kindly afforded for the--oecnpatiou of tlie wharf by Mr. Marsden :Manson, chief engineer of the State Harbor Commissioners.

Missiswippi Rii·er Ommnission.-As the representative of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on the Mississippi River Oommission, l\fr. Davidson had served gince October, 1888. Recognizing tlle demand m[tcle by the exceptional 1ioods ot' the spring of 189() for his active co-operation and conference with the Board, and finding that his field duties on the Pacific coast at that time nece:-::sarily precluded his leaving them, he deemt~cl that the only course for him to take was to transmit to the President of the United States through the Superintendent hiil resignation as a member of the Commission. This was accepted, and took effect April Hl, 1890.

Reference to the beginning of this work by the llarty of Lieutenant Helelrnnty early in .June was made in the last Annual Heport. He observes, with regard to the tidal currents in the locality of bis surrny, that they are irregular, and noticeal>ly affticted by moderate wind;;. tlie iuslwrn aud offshore currents differing at times in force and set to a marked degree. TLis lie attrillated largely to the influence of the Klamatll River. For several miles off tile mouth of this r:n·r the water is much discolored, giving it the appearance of shoal water, !Jut from the sountling.'> taken in the course of the work and from i11formatio11 given by the fishermen and coasting captains in the vicinity he came to_ the eonclnsio11 that Ill) da,agers to navigation existed withiu tue limits of the survey beyond 1 mile from tile shore line, where the depth of water \'aries from 7 fatl10ms gradually increasing to the northward 15 fathoms. Within 1 mile of t,he shore line tllerc are numerous low and sunken rocks, as indicated on the projections. Lieutenant Delehanty reports that there are no possible harbors within the limit-. of the bydrography. The Klamath River is shoal aucl its mouth narrow. with a shifting bar. The small Yessels trading there are not infrequently bll;r-bound for a month ~r two dllring the winter m011tlls. The current in this river runs outeontinnally, except during the highest tides in the antnmn, when the water in the river is }()west. Throughout the length of coast surveyed, the sounding::'\ wpre marked by great regularity from the 10-fathom to the 100-fathom can·e, this curve nu1ging in distallce from 18 to 20 miles off the ooast on the northern sheet, aml gradlrnlly drawing iu ou the southern sheet to 8t miles off Patrick's Point, the southern end. The general character of the bottom is green mud and fine sand between the 30-fatllom and 100 fathom cnr,·e..~. Inside tbe 30-fathom curve it was fine gray sand ov.er hard bottom, tile cups frequently failing to bring up specimens whicll were afterwards obtained by using au armed lead. After finishing the bydrogra.pJ1y to the sonthward of Crescent City, Lieutenant Delehanty made a careful searchfor shoals in the vicinity of Point Lookout and Haystack Rock, coast of

Hydmgraphie .rnrvey of the coast of Oregon from Mack's Arch to Cape Blanco.-Lieut. J. :M. Helm, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Sur.,cy, commanding the steamer Gedne.11, has transmitted to the Office full descriptive reports, accompanying the hydrographic sheets of his suney on the coast of Oregon from .l\Iack's Arch to Oape Blanco. This work, executed between May 28 and September 11, 18:39, was laid out on two projections, scale of eaclt 1-20000, the first sheet comprised within the limits, Mack's .Arch to Rogue River Reef, and the second, Rogue River Reef to Cape Blanco.* Only an abstract of these reports can be given here; tile hy<lrographic details contained in them, and the sailing (lireetions by which they are accompanied, will be of Yalue as embodying results of the most recent surveys for the fourth edition 'of the Pacific Coast Pilot. Three cllannels are embraced in the limits of the two hydrographic sheets just referred to; one inside of Rogne River Reef; one, the channel to Rogue Rh"er; and one, a channel between Orford Rocks and the mainland. In Rogue River Reef Channel the depth of water was from 7 to 15 fathoms, and the shoalest water, 7 fathoms, was found three-fifths of a mile northeast (magnetic) from Pyrarnill Rock in the reef. .A pilot would not be necessary with the use of a chart and the lead. Lieutenant Helm has recommended that this channel should be buoyed. The channel iuto Rogue Itiver is of tile kind so frequeutly met with on this coast, subject to the changing conditions of a bar. At high tide from 1 to ld- fathoms water was found. Hauges have been established as guides to the channel approach, but they are shifted from time to time, antl strangers should not attempt to enter without a pilot. A survey h:t<l been formerly made of the channel between Orford l~ocks and the mninland. Search, however, was made for a reportell shoal spot, but no material change was found f1om the former survey. This channel is used by Yessels of all sizes, nor is a pilot necessary. The best anchorage in this locality is at Port Orford, in from 6 to 8 fathoms, hard sandy bottom, the eml of the wharf bearing NNW. one-half west (true), distant one-quarter of a mile. A few small steamers and sailing vessels, probably twenty-five per year, enter tllis harbor, wl1ich is mostly used during the summer, when the northwesterly winds }JrevaiJ, it being open, unprotected and unsafe in winter, or with southerly gales. Notes are made iu Lieutenant Helm's report of other anchorages which were sometimes resorted to by the Gedney, and which coasters may use occasionally in a heavy northwest blow, while waitiog for the wind to go down; it is to be said, however, with regard to them, that frequently at night local southerly winds spring up, which cause vessels to ride broadside to a northerly swell and roll heavily. The aspect of the coast in approaching from seaward is that of high foothills backed by successive broken ranges of mountains, well timbered, except between Port Orford and Cape Blanco, where there is a long range of sand hills, backed by timbered ranges. Orford lfocks, off Cape Blanco; the Re<lfish Rocks, 3 miles to the southward of Port Orford; Island Rock, the Sisters Rocks, Rogue River Reef, and Mack's Arch are prominent and well-recognized groups of rocks along the coast. In approaching Port Orford or this part of the coast from

seaward, Humbug Mountain, 4~ miles to tlie southward of that port, is a prominent landmark. From seaward this mountain presents a symmetrical sltape; broad at its base, it rises gradually from northward and southward to a peak upwards of 1,900 feet in height, and in color of a reddish brown. This same landmark will be seen in approaching the coast from the southward. Coasting along the shore from the northward, Cape Blanco Light-house is the most prominent ol~ject; it stands on a high !Jase bluft, about 7 miles north of Port Orford, and can not I.Jc rnistak<::n for anything else. The following-named officers were attachell to the Gedney during the sea8on: Ensigns R. O. Bitler, Josepll Strauss, W. H. Bullard, F. W. Jenkins, aml l\L L. Bristol, U, S. N. Mr. William Joynes served as pay yeoman, and l\Ir. P. M. Christiausen as ship's writer.

Triangulation and topography of Ooos Bay, Oregon.-At tb.e beginning of the fiscal year, the party of Assistant E. F. Dickins had been in tl!e field since l\lay 20, 188[), engaged in the resurvey of Coos Bay, Oregon. As stated in tl.i.e last .Annual Report. a scheme of triangulation had been laid out and signals erected, but, on acconnt of the strong north west· winds then prevailing, the measurement of angles was temporarily postponed and the topographical survey of the lower bay was taken up. The first plane-table sl1eet, which included tl..te area of this bay, was finished July 13, and two days later Mr. Dickins moved his quarters to Marshfield, on the up11er bay, and began the erection of signals. Finding that the northwest winds did not blow llome with the same force in the npper as in the lower bay, the triangulation was taken up. Two theodolites heiug available for tl..tis work, Mr. Dickins took one and put the other in the hands of his assistant, ~Ir. Ferdinand ·westdahl. With two observers, the observations made rapid progress, and by August 22 the triangulation of the upper bay was finished, the computations were made, and the work plotted. 'fhe second planetablo sheet was then taken up; this included the whole upper part of the bay and a good portion of its tributaries. The topography of this area presented a large amount of detail; owing to tllis and to unfavorable weather, the sheet was not completed until November 2. Returning then to Empire Oity, the party took up the triangulation of the lower !Jay, including the connection with Cape Amgo Light-House. This done, field work was closed for the season, N ,vember 23. l\1r. Dickins had hoped to cDmplete the hydrography of Coos Bay also, but, owing to the strong northwest winds which prevailed during the summer, the dense smoke from forest fires which obscures signals in the greater part of the autumn, and the early beginning of the rainy season, he found it impracticahle. Both the reports submitted by Mr. Dickins-annual and descriptive-contain details of interest relative to the develo11ment of the Coos Bay country. He observes that it is being rapidly settled aud improved. There were at the time of his survey seven sawmills on the bay, with a total cutting capacity of abont 430,000 feet of lumber per day. The Newport coal mine employs three steam collierf1 to transport its coal to San Francisco. The two principal t-0wns are Empire City, on the lower h 1y, !h)pulation about 500, and Marshfield, about 1,500 inhabitants, on the upper bay. Shipbuilding is carried on at North Bend, the Yes;;;els built ranging in size from small set10oners to foll. rigged ships. Thero are two salmon canneries on the bay. At the head of navigation for sea-goh:tg vessels on Isthmus 81oug-h; seven or eight miles above Marshfield, there is a valuable eoa.l miue, and there was expresse1l a g-e11eral desire to have the survey. extended to this point. Isthmus Slough is also the main ci1annd of communication with the Ooqaille Va.lley. The other principal tribntazics of Coos .Ba.y are Coos River, which is

Delehanty, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the steamer Hassler, was instructetl to make careful search in the locality.

across the channel will be 254 feet over all. The opening or clear span will be 110 feet. 'rhe pivot pier will be 26 feet wide, and the ahutment piers will he eaelt G feet wide. In considering the effect this bridge will have upon the uavigation of the Colnmoia, Young's, a.nd Lewis and Clarke Rivers, Mr. Rockwell observes that tlle fotnre interests an·l importance of the port of Astoria demand recognition and iwotection far more than the present. While for the present the great transcontinental railroads have made such coml.linations that Puget Sound, as an ocean outlet and terminus, is their oL~jcctivo point, he thinks it improbable that the Oolnmhia River will long remain unnoticed. The completion of the stone jetty now in course of construction will probably greatly improve the entrance to the Columbia River, so that in the near future vessels of the largest class may enter aml find a secure harbor within but 11} or 12 miles from the sea. A large city may therefore be reasonably expectecl to be located at or near Astoria, and Young'tl Bay, in that event, wonlcl afford the best facilities for wharf room and mooring ground. Young's River is mainly a tidal est11ary, extending G or 7 miles to the head of tide water. A sbort djstance above that point the river falls from a height of 60 or 70 feet, affording a gnod water power. The river is rnwigable to nearly the head of ti.le water. The tide lauds along the shore are partly reelaimecl by diking, and being very prouuctive are Yal11able. Lewis and Clarke River is navigable to about tile same distance as Young's Rh·er. Valuable deposits of fire and pottery clay are found on the shores of this stream, and the material is loadell on barges alHl towed to the works at Portland. The bottom in Yo11ng's Bay is generally very soft, and, though the soumling lea(l indicates hard bottom in places, Mr. Rockwell deems it probable that boring or dri>ing piles would dernlop a soft silt bottom, and he thinks that without doubt the obstruction presented by this long trestle bridge would have the effect of shoaling the water in the bay to a verv considerable extent, aml that the pivot and abutment piers would have a similar effect in the channel. The section opposed to the flow of the c11rrents would be represented by 542 bents, or say 3,000 pi Jes from 16 to 20 inches in diameter, besides the sections of the piers and the ahutmen ts. Ile obserYes that, in tl.!e ad,·auced practice of buihling bridges with long splms, 110 feet is au inadequate width of span aud that the draw should be at least 150 feet in the clear. Tlle Astoria and South Coast Railroad conld easily be built aroun(l the head of Young\; Hay, and would then be able to cross both rivers by a very moderate draw span in each briftge. After the completion of the survey near Astoria., Mr. Rockwell took up, under instructions, the triangulation of the Columbia River, above the moath of the Willamette. This work was begun August 27 by the occupation of the secondary stations Balch aud Harney, already established. From this time forward the erection of signals and the marking aml occupation of' stations were carried on steadily, interrupted only by smoke from burning clearings or from forest fires. This smoke was sometimes so dense as to make doubtf11l tho intervisibility of points on even the shortest lines. Field operations were closed October 22. It was not deemed judicious to begin topographical work after this date, owing to the near approach of the rainy season. Enough points had been determine(l to carry the topography over 10 miles of the river. For the season the statistics are as follows : Triangulation : Number of 'signals erected... . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . . · · · · · · · . · · . . . . · . · · · · · · .. . · 15 Number of stations occupied ............................................ 15 Number of geographical positions determined ...... _.......·. _........... 35 During the winter Mr. Rockwell was engaged in the reduction of his obser>ations and in preparing his records for transmission to the Archives.

Owing to the smoky weather it was impossible to begin the topogrnphic survey at the month of the river where the lines were long, so work was commenced at the head of ordinary navigation just above 1\fonnt Yernon, and carried downstream in the main rh·er to the junction of Steamboat Slough and Old River, and about 2 miles down the North Fork. The atmosphere liaviug then sullicieutly clearetl, work was carried np<the various mouths of the rin:r to a junction with tlrnt broug11t down the stream. On November (i the topography of tbe Delta was fiuislled, and unfa\·orahle winter weather heing indicated, preparations for closing field operations were begun. On No,·ember Hi the Yukon was laid up in Eagle Harbor. Iu view of the development of this exceedingly fertile valley, which is rapidly becoming a very important factor in the agricultural interests of the Puget Sound Basin, l\'lr. Pratt calls attention to the necessity of framing and enforcing systematic and cornprehensi,-e regulations respecting the driving of piles in channel ways, the placing or' sheer booms and })Qeket booms and the driYing of logs down the navigable out-lets of the river. Steamboat Slough is now the only outlet that has not been injured by the operations of the Joggers, and should this be closed the whole of this important valley wouhl be deprived of the facilities of navigation.

During the rcmaind1~r of the fiseal year :Mr. Pratt, at bis own request, was rnlieved from fielll duty, and allowed to complete at home the records and computations which had to some extent accumulated on his hands. Hydrogmpliio sun:eys in Rosario Straits, including Thatcher and Obstruction PasuJ.Y, .Hale's Passage and Lurnmi Bay; in Semi-ah-moo Bay and Drayton Harbor, and alonf/ the east side of tlie Gulf of Georgia; also in Skagit Bay.-At the begim1iug of the fiscal yea.r the imrty in charge of Lieut. J. N. Joruan, U. S. N., Assistaut Coast and Geodetic Survey, commanding the schooner Earnest, was makiug a hydrographic survey of the Obstruction Passes hetween Orcas, Blakeley, and Cnm~ss Islands, Washington Sound. .A tide gange had been erected and tiUal levels taken from Eagle Harbor, Cypress Island. The positions of triangulation points having been obtained from Assistant J. J. Gilbert, signals were erected and work carried through the Passes on each side <1f Obstruction Island antl through Thatcher Pass. On ,July 23 the vessel was moved to lnati Bay, l.Jummi Island, where a tide gauge was put up, mHl tidal lernls taken from Eagle Harbor. Thick smoke from forest fires prcYented work for mauy day8, but the projection having been extended so as to take in Hale's Passage and Lummi Bay, work was carried on when possible, and the sheet completed Septem bcr 10. Tlw 1\·ork on this sheet made but slow progress, not only because of smoke, but also by reason of th0 strollg' titlal c11rrents that sweep back and forth from tile Galf of Georgia, Bellingham Bay, arnl the :::ltrnits of Fuea.. The steam lalltwh belonging to the party wa,s unallle at times to make headway ewmgll to work, and when there wasany wind it was dangerous to attempt work in the more exposed portions of the waters under survey.

In Rosario Strait and in Hale's Passage, tl1e currents run nearly north and south, aml through 'l'hatcher and Obstruction Passes east a!l(l west. Tide-rips and whirls dangerous to small boats make between Blakeley and Cypress Islands, especially around Black Hock, around the Pea Pod Rocks, off Lawrence Point, Orcas Island, and between Clark and Lummi falands. Lieutenant Jordan names as the principal dangers to be avoided, Lawson's l~ock in Tllatcher Pass, bare at low spring tides; a rock near the beach off the east end of Obstruction Island; two rocks under water oft the southeast shore of Orcas Island, and tile ledge extcudingfrom the north ernl of Clark Island. All of these are well marked with kelp when it is not swept under IJy the current, There is a rock, half a mile northwest of Lum mi Islam!, and a ledge or bar extending from the northeast 1>ide of Lumwi Island to the nmd fiats in Lummi Bay, both of which are entirely free from kelp. There is a good anchorage in the bight on the south side of Orcas Island, also in Obstruction Pass, and for small vessels in a cove protected by a small island on the south side of Blakeley Island. Shelter can be found on the south side of Clark Island, in thl' pass b1~tween that island and the Sisters, but there is very little swinging room and a strong current. The other auchorages are open to southeast and southwest or northwest winds, and should be a\·oided except in emergencies. The carrying trade, he observes, is done almost entirely by steamers, the Straits being the general passage way of steamers bound from the upper ~omni ports to Vanco1rrnr. A stern-wheel steamer made regular trips twice a week through Thatcher Pass, and a propeller three times a week through Ob1>truction Pass. Five steamers made rPgular passagcR tllrough Ilale's Pasisage, bouml from Whatcom to the nortl1 wanl (Semi-ah-moo aud Blaine), and to the westward (l~oche Harbor and Victoria). These steamers varied in size from forty to a thousand tons. On September 4 the Earnest was moved to Drayton Harbor, near tile town of Semi-ah-moo. A tide ga.uge was put up and tides observed day and night for a lnuar month. Signals were erected and soundings begun for the bydrography of Semi-ah-moo Bay. Ad\·autage was taken also of favorable weather, while the vessel was at this anchorage, to do the boat work along the east shores of the Gulf of Georgia and Boundary Bay. There is very little tidal current in Semi-ab-moo Bay and Drayton Ila1·bor. There are no dangers except the mucl flats and a shoal extending out from the nurth side of Semi-ah-moo spit, marked by a spar buoy. The fiats on the east side, south of the IJoundary line, and in front of the town of Blaine, ha>e been piled around by tide-fiat jum pc rs, and iu some cases these piles are under water at high tide. There is a goocl anchorage for large vessels iu Semi-ah-moo Bay, and an excellent one, though rather limited, for vessels of ·ll kinds in Drayton Harbor. Three steamers make weekly trips to Semi-ah-moo and Blaine. On Oetol>er 26 the vessel was moved to a temporary anchorage on the northeast side of' Lummi Island, a tide gauge put up and tide levels taken from Drayton Harbor and Bagle Harbor, Cypress Island. Tile boat work along the east side of the Gulf of Georgia ,.-as finished November 2, and field operations were then closed. Bnsigns Edward Moale, jr., and F. K. Hill, U. S. N., were attached to the party on board the

Earnest.

Two hydrographic sheets were fiuished, one of 1-20000 scale, the other of 1-10000. Soon after the return of the party to their winter quarters at Port Townsend, office work was begun, and early in January, 1890, the completed sheets and records were forwarded to the Office. Lieutenant Jordan has sent with his report general sailing directions for Rosario Straits and

vicinity, Semi-ah-moo Bay and Drayton Harbor, and for Washington Sound and vicinity. These will be of much value as a supplement to the forthcoming new edition of the Pacific Coast Pilot. Ensign Moale was detached November 4 and ordered to the steamer Hassler. Towards the end of March and the beginning of April preparations were made under instructions issued in March for rer:mming field operations. Ensign )foale was again ordered to join the party, and on April 14 a bydrographic survey of Skagit Bay was taken up and carried on till the end of the fiscal year. Ensign Harry George, U.S. N., reported tor duty .May 2. On June 11 the Earnest was moved from Utsalady to near Deception, Fidalgo Island.

.Extensir>n of the triangulation of Rornrio Stl"ait into Lopez and East So1tnds and through Upright Passage to its coanection with San Juan Channel. Topographical trnrve!/S on Orcas, Lopez, Blakely, Decatur, and other islands in Washt'.ngton Sound.-During the snrnmer and auturnu of 1889 the work exec11ted by Assistant J. ,J. Gilbert included a reconnaissance for the extension of the triangulation of Rosario Strait i.uto Lopez and East Soumfa, "\Ya.shington Sound, m the State of Washington, and the completion of four topographical sheets. The triangulation was finished to the northward to the head of East Sound, and southward to the head of Lopez Sound and through Upright Channel to its conuectiou with San J uau Uhauael. The topography was extendl\rl from the point on Orcas Island reachecl iu 1888 to the south of Lawrence Point aronnu the southeast point of Orcas Islancl, iLncl thence including East Sound to a point halfway between East and \Vest Sounds. On Lopez Island the topography was completed from near station Boulder at the southeast point of the island, by way of Lopez Sound, Shoal Bay, etc., to ineludo all of .Fisherman's Bay. .AU of the smaller islands included within these limits were also surveyed, among them Blakel_y, Decatur, awl James Islands. The shore line surveyed was mostly rocky, and over a large portion of it the telemeter rods hatl to he carried in boats. The weather was exceptioua1ly favorable; the smoke, though dense at times, never was so thick as to interrupt foe work. Lopez Jsland, Mr. Gilbert observes, is quite generally settled; the surface has easy slopes and is well cut up with roads. Orcas Island is characterized by hills, tJJ,e valleys between which are in course of settlement. Blakely Islall(l is all hilly, with l:mt little land fit for cultivation. ·· The hyurographic party in charge of Lieu.tenant Jordan, U. S. Navy_, at work in the vicinity, was furnished with tracings of the shore line of Obstruction, Pea vine, and Thatcber Passes and portions of the shore lrnes of Orcas and Blakely Islands.

Continuation of the survey of the c-0ast of southeastern Alaska, in Frederick Sound and vicinity, Triangulation, topography, and hydrography; determinations of latitude, longitude, and azimuth and of the magnetic elements.-At the beginning of the fiscal year, the party in charge of J,ieut. (now
Lieut. Commander) II. B. Mansfield, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, com mantling the steamer Patterson, had been actively engaged since April 27, 1889, in prosecuting a general survey of Frederick Sound, and connecting it with the survey made during the preceding season by Lieut. Commander (now Commander) C. M. Thomas, U. S. N., since then assigned to duty as Hydrographic Inspector, Coast and Geodetic Survey. The part of Frederick Sound included in the survey of' 1889 lies between Point :Xapean and Point Hugh, Point \Vindham aud Point Fort. Previous to July 1 four tidal statiom; had been established, astronomical ol>sen-atious ma1le at fot1r stations, a base liue measured, anti signals for the triangulation erected. Nearly 900 miles had been run in sounding; in this part of tile work and for transportation, the steam launch Cosnws, which had been lJrought from Port Simpson, was of great service. The first tidal station established during the season was in Cleveland Passage, near the anchorage of the Patter1mn. Tidal olJ.servations were taken da:y and night for a lunar month. Tide staffs were subsequently erected as follows: At Eliza Ilarlrnr to connect with Cleveland Passage; at Snug Cove, Gambier Bay, to connect. witll Bliza Harbor; at Mole llarbor, Seymour Canal, to connect with Snug Cov·e; at Windfall Harbor to connect with l\Iole Harbor, and at Holkham Bay to connect with Taku Harb()r. These gauges were connected hy the methods indicated in the "General Instructions for Bydrographic vYork.'' This last named gauge was destroyed by floating ice before the full series of observations hatl been taken. Planes of reference were thus obtained for the soundings upon the following harbor and inlet hydrographic sheets, upon which the work of the season was represented, viz: Clernlaud Passage and Steamboat Bay, scale 1-10000; Eliza Harbor, scale 10000; Gambier Bay, scale 1-:WOOO; Mole Harbor, scale 1--20000; ·windfall Harbor, scale 1-20000; Holkham Bay, scale 1-SOOOO. Those just named are harbor sheets; the inlet sheets are: N. E. Inlet from Port Houghton, scale 1-80000; N. E. Inlet from Hobart Bay, sea.le 1-80000; Tracy Arm, Holkham Bay, scale 1-80000; Ford's Terror, Endicott Arm, scale 1-80000. The fiood tide enters through Frederick Sound, and sets to the northward and southward from Cape l<'aushaw. In tbe open 8ound the tidal stream is weak. Determinations of latitude and lvngitude by astronomical observations were made at stations in Uleveland Passage, Eliza Harbor, Gambier Bay, Sesmour Uaual, and Holkham Bay. All of the longitudes were referred to Port Simpson, British Columbia, as a standard station. One hundred and five pairs of stars were observed for latitude, and six stations were oocnpied for determiuatious of azimuth. Observations for the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were made at four of the astronomi~al stations. Lieutenant Mansfield devotes much space in his report to full descriptions of the se·ernl harbors, bays, sounds, and anchorages included within the limits of his survey. During the season the Patterson occupied the following-named anchorages: Cleveland Passage, Eliza Harbor, Gambier Bay, Mole Harbor, \Vindfall Harbor, Holkham Bay, Taku Harb-Or, Holkham Blty, and Juneau Harbor. Ile observes with regard to tbe character of tbe country surveyed in 1889 that it is similar to that surveyed in 1887 and 1888. The timber is chiefly hemlock, with a few scattered trees of spruce and cedar; the latter very poor. The trees are rooted in decomposed vegetable matter, with a covering of thick spongy moss. The country is mountainous, densely wooded, and deeply indented. '.fhe wild :flowers in summer are numerous, and the salmon berry grows in profusion in sheltered spots.

76

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Deer are plentiful and a nnmber were shot; many black beari;i were seen during the salmon season, and one was killed. The inlets and bays were full of sea ducks, and a few edible ducks were killed. Grouse are numerous, and in the berry season arc in fine condition for tlw table. The spring run of the salmon was very poor, but later the stre~ms and inlets were full of the dog-nosed awl bump-backed varieties. Within the litnits of the sutTey there was but one Indiau Yillage, a small settlement of the Sumdnm Indians, and this was deserted in the summer. Lieutenant :Mausfiehl states that he conld firul no evidence of general glacial action; all the glaciers seen were e\·itlently local and were rece1ling_ Heferring to Ilolkham Thy aud to its glaciers, he observes: "Holk ham Ba,v consists of two arms. The Tracy, or North Arm, is 221- miles long with an average width of three-quarters of a mile. The Endicott, or South Arm is 25 miles long with an average width of 1 mile. "There are five glaciers in this bay, which terminate at the water. Two at the head of Endicott Arm, called the Dawes Glaciers, have a width at the water's edge of seven-eighths aud one-quarter of a mile respectively. Two at the head of Tracy Arm, called the Sawyer Glacier.;;, have a width at the water's edge of seven-eig-hths and three-eighths of a mile respectively. The fifth glacier is in Ford's Terror, arnl has a width of one-quarter of a mile. "There are, in addition, a great number of glaciers with terminal moraines between the mountain peaks. The la1·gest of these is nearly opposite the entrance to the bay, aud is called the Smndurn Glacier. "The highest peak measured this season lies back of the Snmdum Glacier, and I have named it Mount Harrison. "The scenery in the upper arm is grand, the rocks running up almost perpendicularly, and showing the marks of glaciers which have receded." On September ::m, 1889, field operation,: were closed for the season, and the Patterson left for San Francisco, arriYiug at that port October 15. Tile following named officers we~e attached to the party: Hent. E. J. Dorn, U. S. N ., executive officer; Ensign .A. N. Wood, TJ_ S. N., n:wigator; Ensigns A. U. Almy, A. l'tf. Beecher, J. D.

In the spring of 1890, under instructions dated March 4, Lieutenant Commander Mansfield began preparations needful for an early resumption of field work in A.ta~ka. During the winter his party had been engaged in Sau Francisco in the completion for the archives of the records and results of the surveying season of 1889. These haYe all been forwarded to the office. Tlie Patterson Ien San Francisco April 10, 1890, Lieutenant Commander Mansfield commanding, aud the following named officers attached to his party at tbat date: Lieut. E. J. Dorn, U. S. N., execntirn officer; Ensign II. C. Poundstone, U. S. N., naviQ"ator and astronomer; Ensigns G. R. Slocum, .Joseph Strauss, W.R. Fattst, and I!'. \V. Jenkins, U. S. N.; T. L. Carter, assistant engineer, U. S. N. H. L. Ford, master-at-arms, Sl:'r\'ed as draughtsman, aud J. G. Smith and J. C. Dornin as pay yeomen. Passed .Assistant Surgeon H. T. Percy, U.S.~., was attached as medical officer. By direction of the Superintendent, a party organized for explorations in Alaska under t,he direction of Mr. E. H. Wells, of Cincinnati, was taken on board the Patterson for transportation to Pyramid Harbor. The steamer arrived April 18 at Port Townsend after a long and rough passage. Time signals were exchanged with Marc Island, and 20,000 feet of signal lumber taken aboard. At this port Mr. Wens left the P<itter801~ aud proceeded by mail steamer to make arrangements for the transportation of himself aml party beyond Pyramirl Harbor. After lea,'ing Port Townsend, the Patterson coaled at Departure Bay,and on April 28 anchored off Port Simpson, where observatjons were made at the astronomical station. The steam Iannch Cosmos was overhauled and madP ready for service, and on the night of May 2 the Patterson with the Oo8mos in tow anchored off Cape Fanshaw at the head of Frederick Sound. Next morning, observations having been obtained during the night, the steamer got nuder way and landed the astronomical officer, his assistant, and camp olltfit at Point Lena, Lynn Canal. The Cosmos was then sent on detached service aml the Patterson proceeded to Pyramid Ilarbor where the Wells exploring expedition was landed May 4. The next afternoon Lieutenant Commander Mansfield anchored in Barlow Cove, Admiralty Island, and on the morning of May G began work laid out for the season. This included the triangulation, topography, and hydrograpby of Saginaw Channel, Gastineau Channel, and Taku Inlet. .A.t the dare at which this report closes all of the operations of the Survey were in aetivo progress. Full details with regard to it and statistics will appear in the next annual report. Tidal record continued at the automatic tidal station at St. Pa1il, Kadiak Island, Alaslrn.Assistant George Davidson has continued to direct the tidal observations at the automatic gauge station, St. P~l, Kadiak Island, .Alaska. He has examined the monthly tidal rolls and forward eil these and the tabulations to the office. During his absence from San Francisco, from .August; !!5 to December 12, 1889, Assistant James S. Lawson was in charge. Mr. Fred Sargent continued to sen'e :rn obsen'er. Connection by leveling is made between tbe two bench-marks and the zero of the staff, and this duty is ordered to be regularly performed. The S11n·ey is indebted tu the Alaska Commarcial Company for the use of its wharf for the tide-house and gauge, and also for the facilities kindly afforded for the transmission each way of letter.s awl records. During the wiuter there is no communication with the Island. \V!JenC\'er practicable, Mr. Davidson has asked the services of officers of the Navy and Reveuue Marine to examine the condition of the clock and apparatus, aud he reports that these examinations haYe been cheerfully made. ' In August, 1889, and again in October, .Mr. Ivan Petroff, U. S. Censna Agent for Alaska,

examined tlie condition of the tide-gauge aml the reference to bench-mark and personally :eported that ernrything was in good condition, Tidal ol!sen·ations at lliuliuk, Unalaska .Island, .Alaska.-Reference was made in the la.st Annual Report to the establishment of a tidal station on "Cnalaslrn Island urnler the direction of Lieut. Commander H. E. Nichols, U. S. X., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey. By pe.rmisRion of the Alaska Commercial Company the fixed wooden staff by meaul' of which..t:he observations were taken was secured to the Company's wharf at lliuliuk, Unalaska. \Vi th the exception of a few hours lost, mostly at night, the obser.-ations were made every hour from June 1 to September 2, 1880, and the record:,; have been received at the Office. On the 30th of .Tune, 1889, .Assistant McGrath and Suhassistant Turner, just before leaving Unalaska for their duties on the Yukon aud Porcupine Rivers, established two bench-marks as references for this gauge. They have forwarded to the Office descriptious and sketches of tuese bellches.

Geodetic operations.-Re-oeaupation of stations to complete the connection of tlte triangulation of u:ith the 1n-imary friall[fUlation e:c.tenrling to tlte westward in northern Georgia.-Extension of the triangnlation in eastern Tennes.~te.-Tbe re-occupation of two stations of the triangulation of the State of Tennessee, and one station in northern Georgia, having been found necessary to perfect the couuectiou between the two systems of triaugulation, Prof. A. H. Buchanan, Acting Assistant, was iustructed to take up this work at tl10 beginning of the fiscal year. Station .T ohn's i\Ioun t, Georgia, was re-occupied to observe High Point arnl Cohutta; station Roy t Tennessee, to observe Luper an<l Melton, and station Oocks1)ur, Tennessee, to observe Bean and Roy. Thfl re-occupation of ,John's Mount completed the connection of the triangulation of the State of Tennessee with the primary triangulation extending from the Atlanta base-line over the northern part of the State of Georgia. It had been intended also to obtain a more perfect connection of the station Roy with tlle. poiuts north of it by the re-occupation of st~itions Luper and 1'felton, but the atmosphere was so continuously hazy that even heliotropes were at times invisible. Progress was slow therefore, and the re-occupation of these stations had to be postponed. Ji'ielcl operations, begun ,July 1, 188!J, were closed September 20. Assistant C. U. Boutelle, in immediate charge of State surveys, was kept advised by Professor Buchanan of the progress of t11is \\:ork, and consulted in regard to the plans for its advancement.

A small unexpended balance of appropriation being available before the expiration of tho fiscal year, it was deemed advisable to employ it in a reconnaissance and erection of signals for the extension of the main scheme of triangulation in east Tennessee to connect with the triangulation of the State of Kentucky. Instructions were accordingly issuecl to Professor Buchanan urnler which he took the field June 10, 1890, and began this work from the lines Oockspur.:\lelton and Melton-Luper. The re-occupation of these last-named stations was iuclmlecl in hi.-; instructions. Heference to the progress of this reconnaissance will he made iu the next Annual Reporr.

In .Tune, 1890, Mr. B<1ylor re-occupied the station which he had establislled in 1881 in the grounds of the Staunton House at Chattanooga, Hamilton County, Tenn. The point was well preservetl. The usual two days' observations were made. Heobserrnd also at Knoxville, Knox County, Tenn., where a new station was established in the grounds of the University of Tcunessee. Also at Bristol, Sullfran County, Tenn., in ,Tune, 18!JO, the last station occnpietl in the State during the present magnetic tour. Mr. Baylor had oc<:npied a station here in 1881 on the hill on which observations had been made in August, 186U, of the total solar eclipse. This station had to be s11iftetl in position a few yards on account of the proximity of some electric wires. The new point was well marked, anJ was connected witli the ohl one. Longitude aud azimuU1 were determined by observations for one day on the sun, aud the magnetic tleclinatiou, dip, and intensity on one day. In Te1rnessee, and in the other States in which magnetic stations were occupied, topographical sketcl1es of each statiou were preserved, ant! linear measures made to adjacent objects. Upon the expenditure of his entire allotment for part.v expenses, ,Tune IS. )fr. Baylor closed field work, and proceeded to his home to complete the computation of his re!mlts. He acknowledges the facilities afforded by the officers of the U. S. Army at the stations along the Rio Grande River, and the encouragement received from county omcials a.t the several county towns in which magnetic stations were established. Extension of l·ines of geoiletio leneli1ig from Grei~nfield, Tenn., to Okolona, Jliss.-n.eport was made, under a headiug in Section VHf, of the ge<Jtletic leveling operations in Arkansas, executed in the summer and autumn of 1889 by the party iu charge of Assistant faa.ac Winston. Upon ' the completion of that work, October 23, Mr. 'Winston transferred his party from Van Buren, Ark., to Green1ielt1, Tenn., under iustmctions to fill the gap iu the lines of geodetic leveling thence to Okolona, Miss, The bench-mark at Greenfield, establisheLl the preceding sea.sou, was found to be undisturbed, and the leveling observations were begun on the 23thr the forward measure througlrnut the whole distance being made by l\1r. Winston with geotletic level No. 5, and the backward measure by l\1r. F. A. Young with level No. 6. The line follows the Illinois Central Railroad from Greenfield, Tenn., to Jackson, Madison County, Tenn., a,ud thence tbe 1\Iobile and Ohio Bailroad to Okolona, Miss. Ou arriving at Jackson, Mr. Winston cleemed it advisable to trnusfor hi1' party to Okl>lona, and work from that point towards Jackson, as he was informed that the roads in the vicinity of Okolona became almost impaasable when the spring rains began. The two bench-marks which had been established by Assistant J.B. Weir at Okolona in 1884 were found in good condition, and a remeasurement of their differs.nee of elevation agreed w1t.h his result, thus giving a satisfactory starting point for the work. Progress was delayed to some extent by wet weather and bad wagon roads, the line of the l\fobile and Ohio Railroad in this region running through numerous swamps, and along the banks of creeks and rivers. Precautions were taken a.s osual to protect the levels from the eft'ect of the direct ra,ys of the s11u. Temporary beneh-mark.s were established at intervals of 1 kilow.etre, and permanent one&

in all the towns and villages along the route. Two bench-marks were established at Corinth, Miss., which may be the point of starting for a check line of geodetic leveling to 1\femphis, Tenn. Great care was observed not to allow the discrepancies between the two indeprndent lines of level to exceed tbe limit of error; wben this occurred remeasurements w,ere always made. The elevations of the county road crossings, of the railroad crossings, and of the railroad stations along the line were determined by holding the leveling rod on the ground in the. center of track at the crossings, and in front of the buildings at the railroad stations. Mr. Winston completed his work at Jackson, Tenn., on March 14, and immediately afterwards the party was disbanded. The circuit of geodetic levels-Cairo, New Orleans, :Mobile, Cairo-is now closed, the lines run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey extending from Greenville, l\Iiss., to New Orleans, and thence to Mobile and to Cairo, while the work between Cairo ancl Greenville, Miss., was executed under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission. Mr. F. A. Young, as observer, and Mr. H. D. Mitchell, as recorder, served very satisfactorily throug-hout the season. Aft.er redeter ruining the constants of bis instruments, Mr. Winston proceeded, under instructions, to Washington, D. C., where he took up preparations for duty on the Pacific coast. The records and computations of his leveling work were placed in Mr. Young's hands for completion aud transmission to tho archives.

Continuation of the priinary triangulation near tke 39th parallel to the 1restward from stations in Ohio, Kentuaky, and Indiana.-At the beginning of the fiscal year there remained to close the gap
between the scheme of primary triangulation along or near the 39tb parallel, adrnncing to the westward in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, and the like scheme advancing to the eastward in Indiana, the erection of three tripod and scaffold signals, and the occnpation of eleven primary stations. The prosecution of tlte work in the main triangulation in Kentucky, Oltio, antl Indiana was assigned to .Assistant A. T. Mosman.' In addition to this it was necessary to connect the main series with the Cincinnati Observatory, which had been occupied as a telegraphic longitude station in Jtlly, 1881, and also with the okl observatory on Mount Adams which had been occupied in 1848 as a telegraphic longitude station. Incidentally it was desirable to determine as many prominent objects in Cincinnati and its vicinity as could be located during the occupation of one of the main stations. · On July 11 preparations had been completed for observations at station Tanner, 1 mile west of the town of Florence, Kentucky, and about 11 miles south of Ciucinnati. .A tripocl and scaffold signal 135 feet in height had been built here in 1887. To avoid as far as possible the movement of the signal that would have been caused by its exposure to the sun, the sides of the scaffold were covered with canvas. It was necesssary to open the line Tanner-Dry Ridge, which was partially obstructed by the tops of trees, and for this purpose, and for posting beliotropers at stations Dry Ridge, Stow, Reiziu, and Tate, Mr. Mosman detailed Extra Observer W. D. Fairfield ancl Recorder O. T. Mosman, who had been assignefl to duty in bis party. While away from tlie Btation on this service Mr. Fairfield made a reconnaissance for the connection of the station with the Cincinnati Observatory. He selected also a site for the signal station Mud Lick, and opened lines of sight from station Stevens to Cold Spring Church and to Lookout House, Covington. The weather was very rainy during the whole of July, and the progress of the observations at Tanner was thereby delayed, but Mr. Mosman completed them August 16, and while the instruments wern being moved to the next station, Dry Ridge, be went to station Rcizin, Indiana, to examine the locality with reference to oc copying it as an astronomfoal station. Upon reaching Dr.v Ridge, August 21, be found that Messrs. Fairfield and 0. T. Mosman had completecl all the preparations for its n<;1'.·n1ation. This station is in Graut County, Kentucky, 4 miles north of Williamstown, the con11t_,· ,n 1~. The observing tripod and scaffold are 90 feet high.

From Dry Ridge, the lines of sight, with one exception, that of the line to Culbertson, presented no difficulty in observing in favorable weather. This li11e, 31) miles long, passes just clear al.Joye the tops of several intervening ridges, and consiuerable difficulty was fouwJ iu r;eeing the lwliotropc at Culbertson, but it was successfully overcome l.Jy ~ml,stituting a mirror 4 inches in diameter, instead of the mmal one of 2:1- inches. Very hazy weather prerniled during the first 10 days after arriving at Dr~· Hidge, hut all of the necessary obsern1tio11s were finishetl on September 9. At this date, l\Ir. E. E. Torrey, Foreman, having finished signal building, joined the party, and .:\Ir. C. 'l'. l\Iosman, Recorder, was detacl1ed from it. Station Heiziu, about 1 mile east of Elrod, Hipley County, Irnliana, was then occupied. While the observations for horizontal directions were in progress, an a:strouomical olJservatory was built, and a meridian telescope monnted for observations of time and latitmle, and a 20.inch theodolite for dctermiuations of azimuth. Observations for horizontal directions were l.Jeguu at Reizin on September 2L l\Ir. Fairfield had been sent to re-occu1lY station Stevens, co11uecting with the secondary stations Lookont, House, Price's Hill, Convent, all(] Ci11cirniati Ohsenatory. These stations he subsequently occupied, and ti.ms completed the connection of tl1e telegrapl!ic longitude station of 1881 with the main triangulation. l\Liny prominent olijc<'t.,, in the city of Cincinnati, such as spires of churches, public buildings, flagstaffs 011 the Custom honse, Post-oftice, Cimrt-lwuse, etc., were also determine<l in position. Observations for time were begun at station Tanner September 28, and for azimuth October 4. These were maue uy Mr. Mosman. Ou Mr. Fairfield's return to Reiziu, Octohl;r 9, b\· began observations fol' latitude, an<l fiuished them on the 17th. During this time, tlie ;,;tations at Correct, Glasgow, Cnlbertsou, and Stow were marked temporarily to preserve them in the event of their tlestrnction during the wiuter. Extremely smoky weatlicr and the peculiarly difficult nature of the work in foe city delayed ;ery much the completion of the work in and about Cincinnati. Nearly all of the ob.iect;;; to be determined were situated in the lieart of the city antl were obscured by swoke, except in n·ry clear wcatlier aud when the wind was favorable. The fiual observations were made, howe,er, on November 11, and th~ instruments forwarded to Washington that nigl!t. Between October 2H a1ul Xovember O, .Mr. Mosman was temporarily detached from his party for special duty, reference to whicll is made under the heading "Special Operations'' toward8 the end of Part II of this Yolnme. Soon after his anival in \Vashiugton, he was assigned to duty un(l~r the immediate direction of the Superintendent. In his report of the season's work he refers particularl_y to the l'Cf,\" satisfactor,v sen·ice rendered by Mr. W. B. Fitirfield, all of whose d11ties were performed with energy, intelligence, and accuracy. 1\Ir.

Early in May, 1890, in anticipation of his relief from office duty; Mr. Mosman was instructed to make preparations for resuming the field work of the transcontinental triangulation advancing to the westward in Indiana. Until he could take the field in person, Subassistant \Y. B. Fairfield was assigned to his party to make the necessary observations under his direction, while his

foreman, E. E. Torrey, went to Indiana and visited the several stations to >erity tlleir adjustmeuts. The observing tripod arHJ. scaffold at statiou Glasgow was found to have been struck by lightning in March aud badly injured. Having put it in repair :Mr. TorreJ· weut to station Stow ou May 27 and joined l\Ir ..Fairfield, who had arrived from 'Vashington with the instruments. Observations of horizontal directions were IJr;gtJn at Stow May 28, and, with l\lr. Torrey's assistance, were finished June 5, after which the party was t1·ansferred to station Culbertson, Indiana. At this point an obsel'ving tripod and scaffold 116 feet high 'ms occupied. The weather continuing very favorable for oliservations, work at Culbertson was completed .June 19, and tile party moved to Glasgow, Indiana, on .June 21. .M:r. Mosman, having lieen formally relieved from duty in tbc oftlce of tbe Superintendent on June rn, and directed to 11roceeli as soon as prn(,ticable to Indiana,joinell his party at this station. The theodolite was mounted on the trip-0d, 116 feet high, over Glasgow station on June 23, and a pole adjusted on the 150 feet signal at station Green, reatly for observing the next day. l<'requent showers with very hot weather delayed progress somev;hat at Glasgow, but the statiou was finished .T uly 1, and the party moved on the 2d to station Correct.

1)aralld.-Under instructions issued towards the end of .June, 1889, Assistant George A. Fairfield resumed work on the transcontinental triangulation in Imlia11a, carrying it to t!Je eastward by tlte occupation of stations and by tile building of signals with a Yiew to connecting it whh tlle similar work advancing westward: in the State of Ohio, under tbe direction of Assistant A. T. Mosman. Mr. Fairfield. organized his party on tbe 12th of July at :~forth Vernon, Indiaua, and began field operations for tbe season. He dispatched l\lr. E. E. Torrey, chief of the signal building party, to Holman station, one of the points of the State Survey, to put up a tripod and scaffold sigual 75 feet higll. Included in the Rchcme of work were obscnations on all of the State Survey points visible, so tbat a thorough connection might eventually be established between the trans· continental and the State triangulations. Mr. Torrey and his carpenters were eniployed until the middle of September in signal building, ha>ing erected at that date, in addition to the signal at Holman, three tripod and scaffold signals, each 116 feet high, at the primary stations Glasgow, Correct, au{l Mud Lick. As this completed the building of all the signals neede1l to connect the work of Mr. Fairfield with that of Mr. Mosman, t.he carpenters were discharged, and Mr. Torrey was directed to report for dnty to Mr. Mosman. Mr. Fairfield makes special mention in bis report of the admirable manner in which :Mr. Torrey bas conductecl tlie signal building during several years for bot.h of the primary triaugulation parties, his own and Mr. l\Iosmau's. Among the signals he has built are the highest ones ever erected for the Surve;y, and in no instance has one of them ever been blown down or rendered unsuitable for the work through any defect in construction. The first station occupied was Weed Patch, about 4 miles south of Nashville, the county seat of Brown County, Indiana. This station is said to be located on the highest land in the State, about 1,150 feet above mean sea level. Observations were begun August 3 and completed September 19; they included determinations of time, latitude, and azimuth, and observations of horizontal directions on ten stations, five of which were points of the State Survey. Some delay

occurred owing to the necessity of opening the line to Green station, a distance of nearly 40 miles, and one of the long~st Iine'1 in the triangulation between the Ohio a11d the :Uississippi. The trees obstructing the view were 25 miles from Weed Patch. Miller station, situated on the blnffs, ab()ut 3 miles south of Brownstown, the county seat of Jackson County was next occupied. Observations of horizontal directions were made upon nine stations, and had been nearly completed by the 14th of October, wlien a dense smoke began to fill the atmosphere, making it difficult to see objects at a distance of but 2 miles. This smoke lasted till November 2 with but few intervals of clearing, so that while it prerniled obsernttions coulfl be obtained on only three nights. Both at Weed Patch and Miller stations the obsen·ations of horizontal directious were made, as for some seasons previous, at night, upon signal lights ohtainetl by means of student lamps and metallic reflectors. Upon the completion of work at l\liller station, the allotment of funds for the party having been exhausted, field operations were closed for tlic season, and Mr. Fairfield returned to Washington, reporting for duty at the Office November 8. Assistant James B. Baylor was assigneu to duty in the party at the outset of the season, and sened until October 5.

Dnring the winter Mr. l<'airfieltl was eugagetl on office work, and on April 22, 1890, was directed to take charge of the Office of Weights and Measures, relieving Assistant 0. H. Titt· mann, who had been temporarily detached for special service. He was re1iev~d from this duty :\lay 14, having received instruction;; to resume the fielll work of the transcontinental triangulation and carry it eastward in Indiana to a junction with the triangulation coming westward in charge of Assistant l\Iosma,n. The first station to be occupied was Tripp, about one mile north of North Vernon, Jennings County, Indiana. Mr. Pairfield arri\·ell here May 21, and by the end of the month bad his men in camp and all preliminary arr:wgements made for beginning work. On ,June 2 Ur. J. B. Bou· telle, acting aid, reported for rlnts and was at once sent to post signal lights at the seYeral stll· tions to which horizontal directions were to be observetl. M.r. R. L. l\fcCormick reported for duty as recorder June 21. On that day also the Superintendent made a short visit of inspection to the party. Observations at station Tripp were completed June 2G; the light was then post.e<l for the next station, and teams hired to move the party with the camp equipage and instruments to station Stout. Before a start could be made, however, a violent thnnderstorm came up, torrents of rain flooded the camp ground, and the wind blew almost a hurricane. Next day a telegram was received from the light-kee1Jer at Stout station informing Mr. Fairfield that the signal there had boon blown over and badly wrecked, the storm at that point ba,,·ing developed into a tornado. He decided, therefore, to go at once to Green station, about 12 miles northeast of North Vernon, and occupy that while the si.gna.l at Stout was being rebuilt. Ou .June 30 camp was eRtahlished at station Green, and Mr. E. E. Torrey, foreman in Mr. Mosman's party, W<tS detailed hy him, as desired by M:r. Fairfield, to rebuild the signal at Stout. This signal, 136 feet in height, was with one exception the highest ever I.milt in the Survey, and its destruction caused much dt,lay in the sea.son's work, the line Green-Stout being the one on which the triangulation advancing to the

eastward in charge of Assistant Fairfield was eventually to join with that iu charge of Assistant l\lor;;man, advancing to the westward. This junction was effected later in the season. \Vhile at Tripp station Mr. Boutelle was directed to connect that i10iut with a hench-mark of the transcontinental line of levels. The original mark was established by Assistant Braid in 1870 on the stone abutment of a railroad bridge near North Vernon. Some years ago the top stone of tbi~ abutment had uee1i broken by a wreck 011 the bridge, and it was replaced by another stone, hut as the grade of the roall ltas not been changed, ::\Ir. Fairfield states that he is confident that tl1e mark occupies relatively the same place as the one first made, the change, if any, not exceed· ing a fow inches. Up to ,Jnne 2!0, 1890, the triangulation had co\·ered an area of 206 square miles. Its progress after tliat date will be stated in the uext Annual Report. Pror11·es~ of r1eodetic ope1'<tfions in the State of 1Visao1isin.-D1uiug the summer anu autumn of 188U geodetie operations were resumed in the State of Wisconsin by Prof. ,J.E. Davies, Acting Assistant. He occupied two stations of the Lake Sur··ey, Lebanon and Minnesota Junction, thus effecting a eonuection of the Lake Survey work with that of the \'Visconsin State Survey. Tllis couuection ''ill be strengtlteneLl wheu foe astronomical station Fit11sirnmons is fully connected witlt tlle triangulation of Professor Davies by its occupation aud that of Arlington as geodetic stations. The work of Professor Da.vies was carried on in accordance with a scheme of triangulation decided u1ion after i~ reconnaissance ma(le the year hefore by Assistant Charles 0. Boutelle, in immediate charge of State surveys. J\Ir. Boutelle had occupied Fitzsimmons station in 1887 for the determination of latitude and azimuth, and in this, as iu otl!er State surveys, he continued tlw correspondence with Acting Assistants and the immediate supervision of their work up to the sining of 1890, wheu his health, which had ueeu gradually failing, compelle1l him to ask relief from duty. He was at this time in his sen·nty·sevcnth year, and the oldest officer but oue in his term of 4<i ~"ears' service upon the work. Haviug gone to Hampton, \Tfrgiuia, for medical care and rest, lie died tliere at the home of his sou on J uue 22. :\Ir. Bontelle's unremitting efforts to advance the interests of the SLu,·es iluriug his long crm· nection with it, all(l the ability he mauifested in the discharge of the i·arious and responsible duties assigned to him were the sulijects of a commemorative notice issued by the Superintendent. Rstablishl/lcnt r!f' a meridian line in Toleclo, Ohio.-ln compliance with a request made by the commissioners of Lucas Conuty, Ohio, Subassistant P.A. Welker was instractell to lay out and mark a meridian line at Toledo, in that State, the Commissioners offering to bear all inei1lental expenses of furnishing and setting the stone monuments. A site haTing been selected upon public ground known as vVashingtou and Lincoln Parks, on Forest aveuue, determinations ef the direction of the tnrn meridian were made by l\fr. Welker on two nights li>· observations on a Ursm Minoris, the work being llegLrn May 14. These observations were ma!lt' at the south end of the line near the corner of Prospect and Forest avenues. 'l'he latitude aud longitude of tllis point were obtained by referring its position to the stone longitude post established in 1881 by the U. S. Engineers uear the corner of }fonroe and Michigan stn·ets. The meridian line is 923.375 feet in length. Each end of it was marked by a heavy· granite post 12 hy 12 inches square on the top surface and 3! feet long. Tb.ese posts were set in concrete made of Portland cement, broken stone, and sand. Into the top of each. stone was firmly set a 1-inch copper bolt, 31-inches long, and having cut upon its upper surface a cross with a small hole in the center to mark the ends of the line. Full records of the observations and measurements made, with descriptions and sketches, have heen forwarded to the Office by Mr. Walker. nuty assigned to him earlier and later in the fiscal year is referred to under headings in Sections VII and XVI.

Extension of the triangulatio1i of the 8tctte of Jlinnesota from the Snelling A1:enur Base.- Under instructions issne.d ea.rly in June, 1889, Prof. w·. H. Hoag, Acting Assistant, hall in tliat month organized his party for the exteusiou of the triangulation of the State of ~ii nnesota from tlie \Jase which hall been measured on Snelling avenue, in the city of St. Patll, in tlie autumn of 1888, uy Assistant C. O. Boutelle. During .Tune he was occupied mostly in building signals and observing angles at stations in the immediate vicinity of the cities of St. Paul and l\1inneapolis, and in maki ug a short rcconnaiss:mce for the extension of the triangulation to the northward and uorthwestward from tlie latter city. During the first part of July, he continued mea:mn~ments of huri,,ontal aug-Ie1; at 'Vashlmru Ilome aud at other stations west of l\[inncapolis; to the ectst awl northeast of St. P<tul, and to the r;outlt and southeast towards Prescott, 'Yiseonsin, and when the weather was uufavorable for observations of angles, he pushed forward bis n~counaissance. The latter part of .Tul,r was spent in conductiug a general reconuaissauee to the southeast along tlrn l\iississippi River, and in building signals as selections for stations were made. In the earl,v part of August, tile same kind of work was earrie<l back from the rh·er in 'Yabasha and Goodhue Conuties.

Superintendent when this had been done, so that Assistant 0. H. Sinclair, who had been instructed to lay out the line, eould start at once for Huron. A telegram having been received stating that all of the preliminary arrangements would be completed April 14, 1\Ir. Sinclair left Washington April 10 and arrived at Huron on the 14th. Tue location that had been selected was in the grounds of the Court-house, on the west· side of the building. Ob:scrvations for azimuth were made on the first favorable night, using Polaris at any hour angle, twenty-four poiutings being taken on the star and mark with S-inch theodolite No. 148. The direction of the line having been established, and the south stone in place, the north stone was fixed in posi tiou at a poiut 375 feet distant. Each of these stones is 5 feet long, dressed llown at top to the form of a truncated pyramid, with a base 2 feet square anll sloping to 1 foot sqnare on the upper surface. The north stone has in its top a copper bolt, three-fourths of an inch in diameter a!l(l :3~ inches long, with a slot and expansion bra3s wedge in the bottom to bold the bolt fast when driven down. A drill bole half au inch deep and one-sixteenth of an iuch in diameter, at the intersection of two cross lines cut ou the bolt, marks its center and the north point. On tbe south stone, its center ancl the south point are marked by the intersection of two cross-lines, cacl1 ~i inches long, tbret>·quarters of an irwh deep, and three-quarters of an inch wide. These stones markiug the ends of tbe meridian line arc of pink-tiuted limestone, weighing about 3,100 pomuls each. They pr~ject something O'rnr a foot abo>e ground, and are set in a concrete foundation 2~ feet deep and 3 feet square, so that the bottom of each stone is practically 6~ feet below the surface of tl1e gruaud. On April 17 Mr. Sinclair observed the magnetic decliuatiou with the needle belongiag to tlte theodolite, and on the same day left for Washington. The record of his obser-vations has been deposited in the Archives. Other duty performed by him is referred to under bead iugs in Sections II and XY I. Occupation of sta,tions for e.rtending to the westward in Kansas the transcontinental triangulation near the thirty-ninth parallel.-On ,Jnly 5, 1889, Assistant F. D. Granger arrived at Junction City, Kaus., nuder instructions to 01·gan!ze his party for extending to the westward in Kansas the trans: continental triangulation near the tliirty-nintll parallel. Tlrn first. work nrHlertaken was the erection of signals in advance of the occupation of stations, so that tlw measures of horizontal directions could be carried forwanl uninterruptedly during the sea sou. By .July 1!l signals had been put up at stations Wilmer, Frey, \ine Creek, and Iron Mound west. of the uinety-seYentll meridian, arnl 011 the 26th observations were 1Jegnn at stat.ion Ro!Jbius, 4 miles sont!Jeast of ,Junction City. At this point the theodolite was elernted nearly 20 feet above the ground. Six primary and ten tertinry olij(·cts were obsen:"ed, arnl the station was finished August 9. The party and instruments were then transferred to station Humboldt, 15 miles east of ,Junction City. Observations were begun here August 17 a.Ed finished August 30, four primary and five tertiary points having been ob;;,erved. At this point the theodolite was mounted upon an observing tripod, at an elevation of 40.7 feet abo··e the ground. This elevation wa8 required to render visible one station only, Zean Dak, all of the other stations being in sight from a height of 5 feet. Between September 5 and 13 l\fr. Granger occnpierl station Erricssen, situated about 10 miles to tlw northwest of Manhattan. Riley County. For one of the points observed from Erricssen the theodolite had to be monntetl npon an observing tripotl 50 feet high. Directions to five primary and stwen tertiary o~jects were obserrnrl. \Vilmer station, about 23 miles to the westward, was then occupied, the tueodolite being elevated 40 feet and five primary and four tertiary objects being observed. Upon the completion of tbe work at Wilmer, October 3, the party was transferred to station Ta.dor, 7 miles sonth of Chapman, Di<:kinson County. The weather became very unfavorable for obser>ations just as the work was begun at Taylor, and it was not till October 27 that the atmosphere cleared sufficiently to enable the meiLSurnments to proceed. The theodolite was elevated 41 feet aboYe the ground, and six primary and fourteen tertiary objects were observed, the work being finished November 5.

During the season of 1838 some observations haU. ueen ma<le at station \Yhite, near '\Vhite City, 1\iorris County, for \'ertical anp;les, lmt umlerunfavoraule conditiou::i, snow having fallen to a depth of 20 inches before the work ha<l beeu begun, aml the moisture from this melting snow having produced abnormal refraction. ::\Ir. Granger decided, therefore, to re-occupy stat~on ·white before disl>anding his party for tile season, and obtained there. a satisfactory set of vertical measures by the eu<l of November, 18Sfl. Field operations were then closed, and ::\fr. Granger proceeded to "\Vashington, and was occupied iu office work during the winter until instrncted to proceed to Cllarlestou, 8. C., for duty, a report of which is given under a headiug in Sect.io11 \', Having returned to Washington l\lay D, 18!10, he fonml in,structions awaiting him to resume the work of the transcontinental triangulation in Kansas as soon as lJractieable, and in pursnance thereof he proceeded to Junction City, anll on :\lay 20 took up field operations, beginning hj· a recmmaissa11ee for the selection of points one J.igure to tlw westward of the limits of triangulation reached during tl.Je preceding season. Two points, Heath aud Thompson, forming a quadrilateral with Vine Creek and Iron l\lound, were selected, antl a tripod sigual was erecte1l at each. Heath is situated about 14 miles west 110rtltwest of Brookville, Saline County, and Thompson, 11 miles west-southwest of l\Iiuneapolis, Ottawa County. The progress of the work was somewhat retarded aud its cost slightly increased by the difficulty of getting the ce>nsent of the owner of the la11tl at Thompsou station to have the signal put up 011 his property. Mr. Granger takes occasion, in view of this and similar delays encountered, to suggest tbe advisal>ility of obtaining from tile legislature of the State of Kansas the enactment of laws of like purport to those now in force iu a 1mml>er of eastern State8 and in some of those in the Mississippi Valley, providing for the occuvatiou of points in such localities as ti.le progress of the Survey demands. Arrangements having been finally ma(le which were entirely sath;faetory to the owner of the land at station Thompson, Mr. Granger began the occupation of statiou Frey on June 14. Four primary a.nd nine tertiar,v objeds were observed, and 011 the completion of the work llere the part~· wa8 transferred, June 24, to statiou Vine Creek, four miles west of the town of Uauchester, Dickinson County. Observations were in progress at tlii8 station at the close of the fiscal year. Mr. Granger refers in ·er.r commendatory terms to the services of lYlr. M. A. Coles, recorder in his part,r.

Ex~hanges of signals for longitnde betweeu Uarsou City and Virginia City were made on eight con· secutive nights from .Jul.r l!l to 26, i11clmdn~, the observers J1aYing changed stations between the night of the 2:M and the night of the 23d. Mr. Sinclair then moved the Virginia City outfit to Genoa, :Ke·ada, and the line Carson CityGe11oa was taken up. Longitude signals were exchanged ,Tt1J~- 30, 31, and. August 1, 2, and again, after change of stations hy tlw observers, on iive nights between August 3 and 11.

Eureka, and Eureka-Salt La.ke, differed but 0.068 of a second of time from the direct measurement Salt Lake City-San Francisco. Before leaving Etireka, Mr. Marr made a geodetic connection with Prospect Park station, Nevada. During the three months that the longitude parties had been in the field since July 1, 188!:1, fiftytwo exchanges of longitude signals were malle, six aud a half lines of longitude determined, four stations were prepared, and two others already prelJared were occupied. These results, wltieh are much greater than the average, were due, .l\Ir. Sinclair remarks, primarily to fa>orable weather, and also to the location of some of the stations uear Carson City and to the hearty co-operation of the two parties. · )fr. Frank Jaynes, superintemlent of' the \Vestern Union Telegraph Compan_y at San Francisco, and his officers afforded erer,y facility for the use of tltc telegraph circuit;c: anll are entitled to the thanks of the Survey for their kindness.

Occupation of station.~ fn eontinuatilJn '!t' tlte primary triw1rrulation near the thirty-ninth parallel in western central, Utah.-Reference \Yas made in the last arnmal revort to tlte operation:; carrie(l on by the party in charge of AsRistant \Villiam Eimlieck 11reparatory to tlie occupation of the stations Pilot Peak and Jbapah in western central Utah, these ,;tatious forming pointt> in the great quadrilaforal, Ogden-Mount Nebo-lbapah-l'ilot Peak. Having organized his party before the beginning of the fiseal year am! made all arrnugenll'nts neecled for the occupation of Pilot Peak, the 1st of .lnly, 1889, fonn!l l\Ir. Eimbeck on the summit of the peak, establishing camp and mounting the instruments. ObserYations of horizontal directions and double zenith distances were begun ~Tulr ~~. The number of primary points obst·rvetl upon was six, counting the reference mark as one. Two of of tlic longest lines of the Utah work were iucluded, Pilot-Nebo, and Pilot-Jeff. Davis, both. approximately 14$ miles long. \\ork upon the secondary points was also made as complete as possible, including several of' the points connecting "With the Terrnce and Lucin base-line, 37 kilometres in lengtll, which hat! been measured along the Oentrnl Pacific Railroad by Lieuteuant W'beeler when he was in charge of smTeying parties in this region. All of' these points are marked by st1bstantial ro·~k mounmeuts or cairns. In couuection with the determination of the principal mountain peaki,; throughout the ronnd of tlte horizon, ~rnd of the tertiary points, an exhaustive stU(ly of the country lying to the north and northeast from Pilot Peak was made in order to decide upon a i)lau for the extension of tlle Salt Lake meridiouaJ chain of triangles to the north ward. Of t,Iiis chain, the great quadrilateral already referred to forms the first link. The best figure for this exten:;ion is shown upon the sketch accompa11ying Mr. Eimbcck~B report. Three well-preserved boun1lary stal,es upon the boundary between the State of NeYada autl the Territory of Utalt were identified a11d connected by a local triaugu1ation with the main chain of the geodetic work. The lrnundary, it meritliau line, passes about two miles cast of the station ou Pilot Peak. A comprelteusi,·c scheme of observations of secondary and tertiary points was planned and carried out. For latitude of' the 8tation, twenty.three pairs of stars we re observed on firn nigllts \Vitll the zen1th telescope; and for azimuth of the reference mar.k, obsen·ations were matle on Po1aris at eastern and westeru elongation on five nights. ~\.s an aid to describing the station of observation, a somewhat extensive and fairl~· accurate topographical surTey of tlrn mountain was made. Upon the completion of the work at Pilot Peak, July 25, preparations were madt' for the occupation of Ibapah, a station of an altitude of about 12,300 feet, located upon tlw King I'm k of the Dee11 Creek Mountains, Utah. From Willow Springs, n~ar the eastern 1iase of Pilot 1'eak, the i1arty was transferred by freight teams to Deep Creek Settlement aml lbapah statiuu. :Fooll anu water for both men and animals had to be carriPd as usual. The transfer from \villow SpriHg-::; to Camp Aspen, in Hranits Canon of the Deep Creek l\Ionntains, a <listance of about 120 miles, \\"<1S effected in 5 days. Tbe journey was a laborious and exhausting one, the days being scorchingly

To escape the burning heat of the sun and the desert sands, travel was limited to the early morniug atHl late afternoon . .AJthough the most practicable route for a pack trail had beeu explored and located aud the trai I partly ope11ed iu ad vanee to the top of the mountain, much remained to be done to fiui::;h it. Tllis work, aml the preparation of the summit of the peak and the statiou for occu1Httiou, consumed the whole time of the party from its arri\·al in Granite Canon, August 5 until August ~4. on which day all was in readiness, an1l observations for horizontal directions were begun. These were prosecuted vigorotlSly until Sep tern her 1, when there came a sudden change in the weatller; a period of thurn1er i;torms set in, and when the storm clouds were dissipatecl, the atmosphere was left in a condition unfavorable for obsern1tions. It wai; 11ot, therefore, till the 28th of September that work at the station could be compieted. Ei~ht primary directions were determined at lbapah, awl also the numerous secondary 11oints visible from the :,;nmmit by r11easurcs of both horizontal arid vertical augles. Quite an extc11s1ve loea.l triangu Jatiou was executed for the purpose of connecting two boundary stakes, seemiugly well aut!Jentieate(l, upon the western houudary of Utah, with the main series of triangles. Inci<lentally, this work has lirougltt the United States Land Surnys of that locality into a connection witli the Coast and Geodetic Snrvey main triangulation. It lutd been intended to include the astronomical longitude station of Lieutenant Wheeler, near the relay station of the old Ornrland Pony :Express, at Deep Creek, in tlJe local triangulation, hut a search for the station monument or other mark of the point was unsuccessful. The latitude of Il>apalt was determined by observation with the zenith telescope on tweuty-tlirPe pairs of stars on th·e nights, and the azimuth of the reference <lirection by-observingl'olaris five nights at eastern and western elongations. To obtain data neellful for descriptions of the station and for other pi{rposes, such as the stu<ly of the detlectiou of the plumlJ-liue on the smnmit of mountain peaks, a topographical survey was made at lbariah, similar to that at Pilot Peak. Immediately upon the conclusion of the observations at Ibapah the instruments were di~111mmte1l and camp strllck and packed down to Camp Aspen, preparator;y to the return of the party to Salt Iiake. Tlie. ad\·ance of tile party left Deep Creek on the morning of October~, and arriwd at Salt 1~ake City on the eveniug' of the 7th, after a joumey of 19fi miles through a countQ· as de>iolate as C<lll well lw concei\·etl. ~Ir. Eimbeck states that three of the old pony express station:; are maintained on the route to this day, and greatly facilitate travel through this exteni:;iye desert. Subassistant P.A. Welker joiued the party Jnlr 31, and left it at Salt Lake, October 21, prrn~eetliug· east under instrnctious to complete the records and computations of his field work. Dllring hi;; ;;tay with the party 1Ir. 'Velker rendered valuable and efficient service, the especial t!ut,\· a;;signed to him hin;iug lieen the obser,·ations of double zenith distances and astronomical azimuth at 1hapali. The ohsPrrnti.ons fol' local time m1<l fm latitude at both stationi; were made by 1'.Ir. E. P . .Anstiu, of Salt fotke Cits, who Hen·ecl as extra. observer from Jul,Y 1 to October 25.

Establishment of a Naval Trial Course by la.ying o.ff· a measured sea-mile i-n the Eastern Passcige, Narragansett Bay.-At the request of the ~:ecretary of the Navy, antl with the avproyal of the Secretary of the Treasury, arrangements were made iu July, 188!l, for tlte es ta b1i8hmeut of a Naval Trial Oourse_in Narragansett :Bay. Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U.S. N., Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, was detailecl for this dut,y, and having availed himself of the stations which h:ul beeu already determined in position by the triangulation of the Survey on the shores of the bay, he made the measurements antl established the shore ranges needed to lay off a nautical mile iu the Eastern Passage.. Currents were observed at two stations near the trial course, aml at two stations at right angles to it and in the vicinity of the turning autl maneavering grounds at the end of the course. Successive anchorages were made at the same points, and the currents were obsen-e<l at both spring and neap tides. Tabular statements of Yelocities of currents at the several stations occu. pied accompany Lieutenant Pillsbury's report. N cap tide flood, he observes, is decidedly the most favorable time for auy trial of speed oa the course where a current is to be taken into account· .At the southern end of the measured mile, a.t the strength of the ti1le, the current runs uearly fair with the course. In chaugi11g direction, it turns to tile westward as it diminishes in Yelocity; the temlency, therefore, will l>e to make to tile westward of the proper line. The ehh is stronger tha.11 the flood, and at about neap titles there may be no flood current on the surface while below the flood is running. For the ebh current, the ma.xitnnm at greatest strength of tide was found to be 1}0 kuots, and the aver:-ige of maxima wa.,;; eight,Y-five hundredths of a knot. For the fiood current tile maximum was nine-tenths of a knot, anu the a··erage velocity half a knot. The work was finish<itl Augnst 12. Lieutenant Pillslmry has transmitted to the Office, with his report, diagrams showiug n~locities 111Hl directions of currents, and a projection 1 scale J-10000, on which he has marked the locatiou of the measured mile, of tho ranges at each end of it, antl of the steering range. Of the latter he lta8 sent a photogr~ph so tliat it ma}~ be engraved, on the charts . .Establishment of a Trial Course for the SJ!ced tests <~f the new nat111l l!'m' vessel, Pliita.delplda., off the coasts of Block Island anii Long lslmul.-In compliance with a request from the Secretary of the Navy for the laying off an accurately measmrml trial course to test the speed of the new na,·al cruiser, Philarlelphia, the locality fillally xelected beiug to th13 soutlnrnrd of Block Island arnl the eastern end of Long Island, instructions were issued by the Superintendent to Lil'nt. C. E. Yreelaud, U. S. N., assistant Coast and Geodetic Rurvey, commamling tho steamer Blake, to execute this work so as to obtain a course of 40 miles in leugth as nearly as prncticalilc. awl having its extmmities capable of ready identification b~· range marks. Having been furnished with the prqjections necessary from tlie Office, and having taken on board signal lumber a.t the Navy-Yard, New York, Lieutenant Vreeland left tllat port l\Iay 17, 1S901 and having established the locality of the course outside of tlie 20-fathom curn- off the coasts of ,Block Island and Long Island he proceeded to make a reconnais:mnce for thf'. proper location of range marks. Block Isla.nd back range signal was located on Beacon Hill, tlw highest point ou tlie island. It was a vertical extension of a small building which is used as an olise1Tation point. by summer visitors. Above the building rises a. 20-foot flagstaff, ou which slides a wooden diamond, measuring 6 feet vertically by 5 feet laterally. Tllis diamond was hoisted a fow feet above the roof and was kept in that positi()n till after the trial.

Block Island front range signal is a tripod structure, reaching to a height above ground of 40 feet, this height being increased to 49 feet by a small pyramid mounted on top. At the intersection of the range and course when viewed from a point 20 feet above sea-level, tbe top of the front range is clearly outliued against the back one. For the I1ong Islam] fr011t range, it had been intended to erect, a signal on tlJe beach at the western terminus of the course, but as permission to do this was refusell by property owners, it became 1ie<~essary to seleet some permanent and prominent object on shorn to serve as a front range signal. Upon view in~ the locality from seaward, the tower of tbe Presbyterian church at once 1wesented itself as suitable by reason of its size mHl Jll'Oportions. The body of the church is a high-roofo<l structure standing ou an elevation of about :io feet above sea level, and the tower attains a height of 70 feet above tlte ground. 'l'o enable the obserTer on board sliip to }lick up this object more readily, a 40-foot flagstaff was planted on the beach, and a large American ensign hoisted on it. vYith a po1verful glass, the flag is visible 7 miles off shore. In the hills that extend in an almost unbroken line for some distance, rising to the right a11d left of the tower, there was fortunatrly a slight depression nearly on a range, making an almost right-angled cut, and this was seized upon as a site for the back range, being in fact tbe only })Oint aYailable. The signal erected here stands on an elevation of 55 Jcet amidst a clump of pines, and resembles in general appearance the front range on Block lsland, but its dimensions are considerably larger. Its total lieight abo··e thf'\ ground is 78 foct. Passin~ in either direction, the church tower is lost against tlle back hillR within a quarter of a mile after crossing the range, but when it comes out against the sky tlicre is 110 mistaking it. The back signal has been carried 1~ 111iles to the east, and 2.3 miles to the west of the rauge, and from the lofty decks of the Philadelphia can prob~ibly be carried much farther. When on the course both signals are prqjected against the sky background. The working party on shore numbered from 8 to 17 men according to the necessities of tho case. During their absence the Blake frequently put to sea, in order that the ranges might be examined, as they approached completion, from diffe-rent points on the course. From the time of leaving Hampton Roads, April 21, to tlie couclusiou of the trial the ship was under way in all 14 days and steamed a distance of 2,505 miles. The work of establishing the course was finishe<l .Tune 10, and the Blake was at once headed for New York. Upou his arriv<il, Lieutenant Vreeland receh·ed telegraphic instructions to phtce the steamer at the disposal of tlw Board of officers appointe<l to test the performance of the Phila,delphia, of which Captain Henry Erben, U. S. l'< ., was president. This was done; the Board was taken over the course June lG, and Lieutenant Vrcelau<l was then verlJally instructed to erect such signals and locate such prominent OQjects on the south shore of Long Island as would enablo the second and third vcsselR from the wet-;t end of tlie course to establish tlieruselves upon it at about 10-mile intervals. fla\'iug completed this work and returned to New York, the Blake left on Juuc 2:) to fake up a positiou on tlrn trial course, lmt, owing to fog, was unable to get into vosition until the afternoon of ,J nne ~;>, when the trial was uearly finished. The steamer then returned to Xew Yol'k, arnl 1,i0utewmt Vrce1and began pre1iarations f01' a cruise in the waters south of l\fortha·:.:; Vineyard to obtaiu serial tem11eratures and <knsity ol.Jsen·ations.

UNJTED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

tbe Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was requested by Governor Jaeksou of Maryland and by Governor I1ee of Virginia, in letters bearing date of October 8 aud October 10, 1889, to detail an officer of the Survey to examine and locate that portion of the boundary line in the lower Potomac. In pursuance of thi8 request, Assistant Henry L. Whiting was <lirected to proceed to Baltimore, an<l hold a preliminary conforence with the Commissioners appointed h;'I' the GoYemors of Maryland and Virginia to represent the views held hy those States respectively in regard t9 the location oftbe disputed bomulm'y. Ilaving done this, and placed himself in 11of<session of all the information attainable by the inspection of original charts and documents, and baying met the Commissioners again early in NoYeml>er, and had also a personal conference with Govemor Jackson at his home in 1\Iaryland, and with Governor Lee at mcbmond, nrgiuia, :Mr. \'ihiting was further instructed to exercise his best judgment to bring the matter to a conclusion. The report, which he snlnnitted to the Superintendent uncler date of Nornmber 18, states the conclusions whicb he arrived at after basing his study on the declaration of the award of the arbitrators of 1877. The question turned upon the technical iuterpmtation of the data given in the award aa applied to the 1nojection of a line representing the thread of a stream, and to that of a line along the shore which should conform as nearly as might be to the physical s;.·stem o_f a river as characterized by its area and figure. Mr. Whiting observes that, in the first case, the same rule would be applied as that laid down for the course of tlte boundary line in the Pocomoke River, viz ; " The inicldle thread is equidistant as nearly as may be between the two shores without considering arms, inlets, creeks or affluents, as parts of a river, but mea810-i119 the shore lines fl'o'fn headland to headland. "No other measurements would mathematically determine the middle thread, which must lie a mean direction between the course of the two shores. "Measuring straight lines from headland to headland would uot determine the middle thread of a. stream, because, in tbe bends of a river, straight lines giving equivalent results can not be measured on corresponding or opposite concave and convex sbores." "Again, in the second case" (to quote from Mr. Whiting's report), ·' the same rule would be applie(l as that laid down for the boundary lfae on the Potomac River, viz: " The low-1cater mark i.~ to be measured from headland to headland, without following indentations, bays, creeks, inlets or affluent rivers; for the reason tbat such lateral features are inCidental to the general syst<im of the river, and can not properly he made factors in determining it.s true pbysical limits." "Referring again to the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia, refixNl hy the arbitrators of 1877 on the right bank of that river to coincide with low-water mark; the descriptive text used and the conventional sign adopted can only be regardecl as an intentional avoidance of more specific mention and definition of points and features which time and natural causes might so change as to render their future identification doubtful. Whereas the right bal.1k of the Potomac, in its general features, will always he the rigbt bank Ro loug· as the river itself remains. "The only deviation made by tho arbitrators of 1877 from tlie ruling of the original charter is in adopting the low-icater mark, instead of the high-water mark, as the true line of boundary. Pltysically. the lines are substantially tbe same as features of the river bank, while low-water mark is more in accord with modern regulations pP.rtaining to riparian rights." Finally, Mr. Whiting says that, for the reasons assigne<l in his report, be is prepare<! to ;;tate, ou the part of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, that according to the text of the awanl of the arbitrators of 1877, as descriptive of the boundary line between Maryland and ·nrginia, no mathematical or physical construction can be put upon the meaning of said description which wrn locate and define the cognate boundary line and low-water mark iu any other place, or make it conform to any other course of the ri~er than that which tllcy 11ave ascertained and dPtermiue(l to be tlte low.water mark on the south shore (right bank) of the l 3 otomac River as marked aml sha<led in red upon the coast chart No. 33 of the United States Coast Sun'ey which is filed as part

of the said award and explanatory thereof. This cltlarly illustrates the intendi!il location <Jf the boundary line, and conforms to the terms and meaning of the a ward. Copies of Mr. Whiting's report, duly verified, were sent by direction of the Superintendent to the Governors of l\lar.dand and Virginia. It is published in full as Appendix No.11 to this volume. BpeciaZ survey 1nade at the request of the Fish and Game Commission of the State of Ohio.In compliance with a request made to the Secretar,y of the Treasury by the Gornrnor of the State of Ohio a.nd referred hy the Secretary to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Assistant A. T. Mosman was directed to proceed to Toledo, Ohio, and confer with the Hon. C. V. Osborn, President of the Ohio State Fish and Game Commission, with regard to the establishment of the limits of certain fishing tracts on the shore of Lake Erie. On bis arrival iu Toledo, October 29, 1889, Mr. Mosman was met by Mr. Osbora aud after conferring with him that afternoon a conference was held in the evening, at which were present also the other members of the Commission and the representatives of the large :fishing interests near Toledo. It was then decided to select as the location for smTcy a fishing tract on the south shore of Lake Erie, southeast of Cedar !"'oint, and known locally as Sanely Point. This tract was selected &'I being without dispute owned by one of the large fishing firms present at the conference. Mr. Osborn having then left for his home in Dayton, Juclgc E. D. Potter, of Toledo, remained to represent the Commission, and he made arrangements to furnish Mr. J\fosrnan with transportation from Toledo to Sandy Point, and also with the men and tools needed for the survey. Subassistan t P. A. \V elker, being at his home in Toledo, was instructed to assist Mr. Mosman, and rendered valuable aid in the work that followed, taking part in the tests of the measuring wire and in the measurement of the base line. Sandy Point was so located on the open shore of the Lake as to be inaccessible by land, being but a narrow strip of sa.nd beach from 16 to 20 yards wide, backed by an impassable marRh of from three to four miles in width. It had therefore to be reached by water from Toledo, a distance of 17 miles, and no landing could be made on the beach except when the wind was from the south, or off-shore. These conditions made the work coruparatfrely slow and added to its cost. From October 30 to NoYember 3 the weather was very stormy and all that could be doue was to complete the preparations for the survey. On November 4, a steamer hiwing been chartered and the party landed at Sandy Point, the measuring wire was tested, an<l had been stretched at a tension of 50 pounds on the beach, when the party was signaled to eome at once on bourd the steamer, as the wiud had hauled to the northwest and the vessel was dragging her .ancltor. On November 6 and 7, landings were again effected. 1t had been iu tended to measure a line a mile long, bnt, this being found impracticable on account of the ends falling in marshy ground, a base of 1,~00 metres (3,937 feet) was measured and angles observed on Cedar Point station of the Lake Sun·ey, on Turtle lslaud Light-House, aml on West Sisters Island Light-House. These angles, with others measurecl from Cedar Point Station by Mr. Mosmau and data publishrnl by the Lake Survey, enabled him to determine the geographical positions of station No. 1 and Back Range No. 1 on Sanely Point, and these stations were permanently marked. On No>ember 9 Mr. Welker finished the marking of station No. 2 and of Back Range No. 2, and made a sketch of the line measured. Mr. Mosman was enabled to occupy Cedar Point through the courtesy of Mr. W. 'l'. Bhmt, U. S. Assistant Engineer, in charge of the improvements of Toledo Harbor, who took bim upon his steamer to the station. Mr. Blunt also ran out to the end of Mr. Howell's string of nets extending six miles in one line from Cedar Point, and located the extreme end by sextant angles. The location of this string of nets had been the subject of dispute between Mr. Howell and other fishermen, so that its accurate determination by a disinterested person was very desirable. Before leaving Toledo, Mr. Mosman arranged the field notes of his survey, and upon arriving in W ashiugton took up the computation of the results. He had made it copy of the sketch of the line, and also, on an enlarged sea.le, a sketch of the general location of the tract surveyed: taken from a chart of the I..1ake Survey. These sketches, together with his descriptions of the survey made and of the marks at the stations and back ranges, were transmitted by the Superintendent t.o tlie President of the Ohio Fish and Game Oommission.

S1tri·eys for a prelirninary determination of the Boundary Line between .Alaska anrl British Columbia and the Northicest Teri·itory.-That portion of the plan for a preliminary determiuatiou

of the eastern boundary line of Alaska which involved the location in latitude and longitude of points on the Yukon and Porcupine Hivers at or near the one hundred and forty-first meridian of west longitude having been assigned to the parties in charge of Assistant ,J. B . .McGrath and Snlla1>sistant J. H. 'furner, these officers with their assistants reached their respective camps in August, 1889, Mr. McGrath establishing himself on the Yukou River aml l\Ir. Turner on tlie Porcupine River at localities as near as practicable to the crossings of those ri,·ers by the one hundred and forty.first meridian. The voyage up the Yukon River was made without special difficulty, botll parties h:tving been transported up the river from St. Michael's, Norton Scund, by the Ala8lm Commercial Company'R steamer Yukon and having reached Fort Yukon August 2. Here the parties separateil, Mr. Turner proceeding up the Porcupine Hiver in the steamer with his party, while Mr. McGrath remained at Fort Yukou, awaitiug the steamer's return to convey him up the Yukon to the boundary line or a point near it. \Vhile thns waiting he ma<le observations for the magnetic elements, determined time, azimuth, latitude, aml longitude, and measured a base line and connected it by triangulation with points around Fort, Yukon. On August 12 he started up the river in the steamer for the boundary line aml on the 19th he Wal> landed at the site of an abandoned camp near the bourniary, and began at once the lmildiug of qua1ters for ofticers and men, the erection of au observatory, and all the preparations needed for the winter's work. The reports which have been receivetl from Mr. McGrath bear dates of September 30 and October 31, 181;9, an<l Juue 15, 18fl0. These reports with his daily journals and monthly reports give detailed accounts of the employrneu t of the party and cover tbe time betweun its establishment in camp and the eud of May, 1890. During this entire period, the weather was most unfavorable for astronomical work. The summer had been au unusually wet one, high water and constant floods had stopped mining operations on the branch of the Yukon known as Forty Mile Creek, and this humid condition persisted through the autumn. The winter was milder than any known except the previous one, and the sky constantly co1erell with clouds except on tbe few days when tlte thermometer fell to temperatures which made out-of.door obsen'ations impracticable. Not a single occultation was visible, aud the only lunation that coulcl be observed was that beginning at the end of .March and lasting through the early part of April. The da,ys were beginning to get long then, and it became difficult to take any almanac stars with the moon, except those of the second magnitude. This set being the only one that Mr. McGrath could get for his lougitude determination antl the range of the several values being too large, he decided to remain at his station another winter in tho hope of having more favorable weather. Observations for latitude had been made in November on four nights by Talcott's method. The magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were det1mnined every mouth beginning in September, and the meteorological instrumeuts were read three times a day. The lowest temperatures noted were -54° and _590_3 Fabr. on January 28 and 29, and-550.31 -[i30.9, and -tiF'.3 Falir. on Febmary 5, 6, anti 7, 1890. During these three days in February, the highest tempera· turcs were -32°, -41°.5, and -390.9 Fahr. During the autumn the Yukon Hiver was gauged; lines of sonudiugs were run and 1foat:-< wero sent down to <letermine the velocity of the current. The natural resources of this section of tbe eountr~· being few; much apprehension of a Rcarcity of provisions was felt for a time when news ca.me on the 11th of October of the loss of the steaRJer A.retie between St. J\fiehae1s and tlie mouth of the Yukou. '.l'hh; stt·amer mts carrying supplies for Mr. McGrath's party, and she was expected to arrive about the 20th of :::leptember. Ultimately she was raised and repaired, and the supplies saved from the wreck were forwarded up the Yukon by the steamer St. Michaels and landed September 23 about 150 miles below Fort Yukon. 'l'llere being a scarcity of flour for the party, but five pounds a. month to each man, and many of the

96

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

staple articles of food being either wholl_y wanting or to be had only in exceedingly small quantities, Mr. l\IcGrath deemed it advisable to send two of his men to the point of storage of the supplies with orders to take what care they could of them, and if possible get some up t-0 the party during the winter. These men started on their return journey in February with a hand sled and a toboggan drawn by three dogs, and after trayeling 70 days reached camp May 2, briugiug 200 pounds of flour. They had to cut off the tops of their b(lots to feed the dogs and gave them also deer-skin sinew and liue from the toboggan; their own clothes they cached ou the road, being able to carry besides the flour lmt one pair of blankets, and having on their arrival only the clothes on their backs. T!Je chief pri \"ation that had been felt by Mr. McGrath's party during the winter, next to the lack of tloar, was tfie war:t of illuminating material, the supply of oil having been only enough to allow lights for a few hours each day. :Yir. McGrath expresses his thanks to ltis assistants Mr. Davis and l\fr. Kingsbury for the aid they afforde.d him. The men of the party worked cheerfully and diligently throughout the season. From Mr. Turner, in charge of the Porcupine River pltrty, reports have been received bearing dates of January 1 and 24, 1800. These reached Washington on the 30th of June. After leaving Mr. McGrath at Fort Yukon, the steamer Yukon with Mr. Turner and his party on board proceeded up the Porcupine Biver until the morning of August 6, when Captain Petersen stated that Le had sounded the chaunel ahead and found it impossible to proceed further. He represented also that the rapidly falling water made his safe retum to Fort Yukon problematical were he to delay longer. He therefore landed Mr. 'furner and party with its stores and equipments at a point on the river 37 miles west of the boundary. )fr. Turner expresses his conviction that this action was due to ignorance of the river, as within two days after the steamer's departure the ri,·er rose at least ~ feet, rendering navigation to the boundary perfectl.v practicable, and with short periods of rise and fall, the low water of August 6 was not reached for two weeks or more. It was necessary, therefore, to track the supplies up the river, and for this purpose the whaleboat Lottie brought from San Francisco, and one of the Alaska Commercial Company's lighters, placed at Mr. Turner's disposal by Captain Petersen, were used. On August 8, the lighter with the whaleboat in tow started ou its way up the river. The surgeon, Dr. Kierulff, and one man were left at the lower camp, and Mr. Turner llired four Ind1ans to assist in pulling the boats upstream. Difficulties were encountered at the outset, owing to the rapid current ancl the frequent grountling of the lighter, which finally grounded so heavily that the combined exertions of the whole force failed to start her. Tl.le whaleboat was therefore loaded, aml the lighter left with one man and an Indian boy to remain until the lighter could be sufficiently relieved of her load to be got ofl~ On August 11 the Rampart House was reached during a thunder storm. Olrnernitions matle at the Rampart House placed it in latitude 670 081 north, longitude 9u 27.lm west of Greenwich, or in arc 141° 46'.5, nearly 20 miles west of the boundary line. On August 12, having obtained the loan of a boat, Mr. Turner started up the river, accompanied by Assistant Astronomer Edmonds and three men, for the purpose of locating the boundary and selecting a site for a camp. On August 18, a point having been reached at which observations with the sextant gave the longitude as 9h 23m 58·, or in arc Hoo 59' 3011 (the latitude having been assumed as 67° 25' from observations made a few miles higher up), a site for a house was finally select.ed at the mouth of Sunaghun Hun (Old Wife's River). The Assistant Astrono. mer and two men were left here, while Mr. Turner with one man returned to Rampart House, where bl~ found the lighter and the whaleboat. By the 17th of September the whole party outfit (except some flour and meat stored at l::Oam· part Honse) had been transported fully 50 miles upstream in the face of a rapid cnrrent and despite uumerous mishaps; a space had been cleared in the forest and a houise put up liO feet long aml 15 wide, with a projecting wing 15 by 20. By the 4th of October the house was ready for occupation; the astronomical observatory, a log structure 10 feet square, was finished and the meridian telescope in position. The magnetic observatory was completed October 15. Mr. Tarner noted great daily fluctuations in the ma.gnetio declination, and these induced him to obeerve

once a week the declination through twenty-four hours. This was begun November 4, and was continued without intermission up to the date of his last report. The most formidable obstacle be has had to conteml with has been clomly weather and fog. Solely from this cause he had been unable up to January 24 to secure more than one occultation, tllat of 17 Geminorum, on November 11, 1889, and eleven moon culminations. Ile states that, although the temperature had fallen as low as-45° F., he did not. find cold weather au insurmountable obstacle to observing. Mr. Turner had made arrangements at the dat.e of his last report to undertake in 11arch a sledge jo1uney frolll his camp to the shores of the Arctic Ocean, a distance overland of abont 150 miles. On his returu from this expedition, if successful, Ile proposed to 1:1en<l Assistant Astronomer Edmonds to try and push across the country to the Yukon. ;\Jiuor exploring trips into the surrounding country were also projected. lfo_ will continue his snn·e:ys throughout tl1e winter of

This set consisted of Prototypes Nos. 12 and 27 of the Standard Metre and Prototype No. 20 of the Standanl Kilogramme. It had been deemed advisable, in view of the risks of transportation aml for other reasons, that the United States should possess two copies of the National Prototype Metres and two of the National Prototype Kilogrammes, and also an additional metre bar made of the "alloy of 1874." This was No. 12 iu the set just referred to.

The annual report of Mr. B. A. Colonna, Assistant in charge· of Office aud Topography, aecompanie<l by the annual reports of the chiefs of the several Office Di..-isious, is publislled as Appendix No. 4 to this volume. 1\Ir. Colonna calls attention to the fact that, in accordance with instructions rece1ttly giYeu, the Disbursing Officer of the Survey and the Assistant in charge of the Office of Weights aml ~Iea:mres have submitted their annual reports dil'ectly to the Snperinteudent. Ile expresses bis gratification at tbe continued able support that he has received from the chiefs of the several Dh-isions of the Office and states that no efforts have beeu ornr1ookcll during the past year that would promote the efficiency of the service by irnproviug the proficieney of its personnel aud by complying strictl.v witll the letter and spirit of the Uivil Sen·ice faws. Ile calls attention to the urgent neml of more room for certain of the operations incidental to the printing of charts from copper plates which require the use of much inflammable matter and a comitant fire. TU.est\ operations, for want of space in the press room, have now to be carried on in the basement of the hllilding intended solely for the preservation of the Archives of' the Surve:r. Uetween ,July 2, 188H, and July 8, when the President made the appointment of the Superiutemlent of the Surve.\·, Mr. Colomm performed the duties of Superintendent, so far as necesf'ary for the proper conduct of the 'York, under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasur.v. The Computing Di\·ision of the Office has remained as heretofore in charge of Assistant Ullarles A. Schott. Details of the work of Urn several computers, with the names of officers of the Sun·ey and other persons temporarily assigned to duty in the Division, are given in his annual report. Mr. Schott has directed and sllpervised the work of the computers, furnished from time to time tlw results of the computations, supplied information in connection with the scieutitic correspondence of the Survey, and completed the discussion of much accumulated material relating to terrestrial magnetism. Among the scientific papers which he has submittetl for pn blicntion was one iu which are presented the results of ti.le absolute measures of the maguetie declination, dip, and intensity at Los Angeles, California, during a period of seven :rears, and one in which arn gh·en tile results of the differential observations of the declination at tlw same place :rnd for the same time. fn the latrer paper more than Gl,000 hourly readings ha\·e been subjecte<l to au aual,rsis and discussion which includes au exposition of the lunar and solar rotation efl'('et on the liorizoutal magnet. Tl11.·Re papers are published as Appendices Xos. 8 and 9 to thiR Yolume . .'.\Ir.

Drawings were furnished to the Eugr~wing Division for 2Hl corrections or changes required to be made. on engra-rnd plates of charts. The loss of the services of three exprrie1wed draughtsmen by re::;ignatiou was seriously felt during the year. Notwithstanding this reduction in force, Mr. Dennis reports that tlH· amount of work accomplished will compare fa\·orably witll that of pre,·ions .vears, especially when the size and character of the drawings for new charts are considered. Assistant Herbert G. Ogden submits the annual report of the Engraving Di\·ision, of which lte continued in charge during the year. lncln<led in this <lut_y there is also the direction of the work of electrotyping and photographing and of tl1e chart-printing. Thirteen new engraved plates of charts were completecl and 14 engraved plates of new editions of charts; 11 new engraved cliart plates were beguu, aml fonrt.een plates for new etlitions of charts. Impressions for the chart room were taken from 862 plates, awl 627 chart plates were corrected for printing. There were in hand at the close of the year eugra>ed plates of '..!::i new charts and of 11 new editions of charts. Thirty-three alto and 45 basso plates were made in tlJfl electrotyping room. For tlle use of the draughtsmen and eugran3rs in reductions and for other purposes 277 iwgati ves were made in tlle photographic laboratory, and 702 prints taken from negatives. In tbe printing rooms the total 11 umber of impressions taken from eugraveu plates was 53,0fll; of this number 47,008 were for the chart room. Mr. Ogden obsenes that the number of plates finished during the year is larger than for any year during his charge of the Division, and that the year's work has shown material progress towards completing the series of coast cllarts (st;i1k 1-80000) and general coast charts {scale 1-4(l0000 on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Of the coast charts, but two are required to finish the serit>s of 195 from the nortllcasteru boundary to tlle Mississippi nin~r, aud of the general coast charts two will complete the whole series of 21 from the NE. boundary to the Rio Grarnle. On the Pacific coast the recent publication of the general coast chart (scale 1-200000) from San Diego to Santa Monica has completed the series of those charts from the southern boundary to Cape Mendocino, with the exception of a gap between Point Buchon and Poi11t Piuos, where the surveys arc as yet unfinished. Mr. D. 0. Chapman, aided by Mr. L. P. Keyser, continued in charge of the electrotype a1Hl photograph rooms. Mr. F. l\loore served t!Jronghout tile year as foreman of printiug, witL the usual force of assist.ant printers and helpers. Seven thoasand two hundred aud 1Hty-fonr more impressions >Yere furuished to the chart room thau during the preccdiug year. A still larger number was needed to meet the demand for charts, but the apvropriation for printing wa:,; not enough to permit the employment of printers for the small press during tlle last four months of the year. l\Ir. Ogden commends tbe zeal and fidelity to duty of Mr. John H. Rmoot, clerk in the Division. A list by title of engraved plates of charts begun, completed, and i.n progress tluring the year accompanies bis report. From the beginning of the fiscal year till December 18, Assistant Andrew Braid had charge of tlie Instrument Division, and upon bis assignment to field service Assistant Edwin Smith was directed to take charge of it and has submitted the annual report of its work. Mr. E. G. Fischer continued to serve as chief mechanician. Some changes in the personnel of the force of mechanicians were made witll a. view to obtain greater efficiency. l\fr. Smith observes that the construction of new instrument.R liaR been cou finetl to such as can not be purcllased or made to order except at very muc11 greater cost., bnt. quite a number of instruments were so tlwrongllly remodeled or repairetl that they became practically new ; among these were 12 plane tables, 1 meridian telescope, two 45·incll astronomical transits, and :::1 theodo· lites, 1 of which was regraduated . .Among the new instruments completed were six 8-inch repeating theodolites (begun the _year preceding) &nd 1 tracing apparatus and 1 set of 16 metric weights for the Office of Weights and

French continued to serve as head carpenter and ~Ir. R. C. Glascock as clerk to the division. The report of Mr. A. S. Christie, computer, in charge of the Tidal Division, indicates t.hat a large amount of \'aluable work has l>een done during the year. The manuscripts of the tide tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for the calendar year 1891 were prepared and the proofs read; tidal notes were furnished for 131 stations on 38 charts and for 62 stations for publication in the Coast Pilots. The usual information was supplied to field parties and tidal data were prepared in response to requests from persons not connected with the Survey. Serie:-; of tid:\l observations at tlie following- named ports were under discussion by tbe method of harmonic analysis: 1~ast1iort, Me., 18G2; Boston, Mass., 1869; Sandy Hook, N. J., 1887-1888; and Sammlito, Cal., 1889. All data and records relating to observations of currents were examined in detail antl memoranda preserved in the form of a card catalogne, w that all material for the reduetion of current ousen·ations conl<l be readily referred to aml plaui> of reduction laid out to the hest ach-antage. A paper on tlie use of Obsernttions of Currents for Prediction Purposes was prepared by l\lr. ,John T. llnyforcl, compntcr, and is published as Appendix No. 14 to this volllme. He Las also suumitte<l a paper on the He la tiou between the Harmonic Compoueuts of a Tidal Curve awl its l\fcan .Amplitrnle, and a paper on A. Mo<lificatiou of the Ferrcl 'Tidc-Pre<licting Machine to adapt it to the Prediction of Hourly Or<liuates. A special report Im:-; been made on tla~ results of au elaborate comparison lwtween prediction with the machine a,ud observation uy rneaus of automatic gauges. (See .Appendix :N"o. 15 to tliis volume.) l\fr. Christin has Ruhmitted a paper on a uew method for the analssis of periodical phenomena. 'I'he acquisition of <lll 8-keyed comptometer facilitated in a remarkable degree the 1rnmerieal work of the Divisiou. :\fr . .M. \V. Wines, general office assistant, reports a considerable increase in the business of the :\liscellaueous Division, of which he has continued in charge. Fonr thousand six hundred aud fifty-niue more chal'ts were sent to sale agents than during tlie fiscal year preceding. The annual report of the Superintendent for the fiscal year 1887 was received from the printer and that for the fiscal year li:J813 wa" sent to the pres8. Uf these reports, from the year 1851 to the year 1887, a home distribution was made of 2,928 copies and a foreign distribution of 46:.> copies, making a tl'>lal distribution I.luring tile year of 3,391 copies. Lists of the publications of the Survey received during the year from the Public Printer, with the nnrn ber of copies of each publication printed, are incluJecl in .Mr. Wines's report. Among these were for free distribution to applicants the extra copirs of Appendices to the Annual reports and the Bulletins. Of the Notices to :Mariners issued moutlil.r, or oftener shoulc1 occasion denmnd, upwards of 10,000 copies were distributed each mouth. Mr..Freeman R. Green kept tlie accounts of sale agents for charts and atte11ded faithfully to the other clerical duties of the division. Mr. Wines commends the chief messenger, William H. Butler, who had ser-rnd many years in that capacity, for his faithful performance of duty; also the assi.sta11 t messengers. Assistaut Gersbom Bradford, in charge of the Chart Division, reports that a number of impro\·pments liaYe been made in the routine of chart receipts, corrections, and issues, thereby facilitatin~ the work. A large increase in the labors of those employed grew out of the constantly growing- demand for charts. The issue of charts to vessels of the Navy was about twice as large as dnriug- the preceding year. l\lr. llradforu presents a comparative statemeut of the net issues of charts during the fiscal years 18i'!"l a1H118!:10, showing for 1890 an increase of net issue of 30 per cent. A similar statement of the issues to sale agents 'shows a uet increase of 19 per cent. For the fiscal year 1890 the numbers of these issuer; are 61,882 and 31,146 respectively. Tlw ti tit's of 7 c!Jarts printed from engraved plates, and of 21 charts published by photolithograp11y \Wl'P adde(l to tlrn cata.logue. The· text of a new catalogue of charts was prepared aml it is now i11 tl1P lia111ls of the Public Printer. Tile a111111al report of the Archives and Library Division, suLmitted by Mr. Artemas Martin, who rc111a' ucd in cltarge during the year, shows in detail the number and kind of records, original and <luplicatc, aud of the computations received and registered in the archives; also the numbers

Commander Thomas entere(l upon his 1luties as Ilydrographic Inspe.ctor at the beginning of the :fiscal yetir, relieving Lieut. Comnrnmler \V. H. Brownson, U.S. Na,·y. Referring to the work of this officer he OOSeITe:> tiJat be fo11u1l tlH' partie:> in the fielti SO thoroughly o·gauized and the routiue of the office so admirably arrangetl and systematized that no changes of moment in administration were fouud necessary. In his general summary of hydrographic operations on the Atlantic, Gulf, au cl Pacific coasts CommaTHler Thomas take:> occasion to say with regard to the completion of tLie hydrogrnphy of tile Florida Keys that the snrve.y i>: to be congratn lMell tllM this important and int.ric:1te pieC(\ of work was wholly executed nlHler the immediate supervision of Lieut .·J. F . .!\loser, lJ. S. Navy, an officer whose sarveys have ne~'er been snrp:t~Red arnl sehlom equaled. Lieutenant .'.\loser was <letachecl soon after the close of the fi~cal yea,r. 1t may be a1ldecl that the r~wrts which he has sub mi tte(l during three separate terms of duty on tlrn Snrve~·, oecupyiug ill all a periOll of fifteen years, lrnv·e been models in their cle:trhe5s aud completenes~ of statement, ha,\·e contained many Yaluable suggestions, and could ha,·e em<inatetl only from an officer deeply interested in his work au<l of exceptioual ability as a hyilrographer. For the use of the Gulf Coast Ntn·y Yard Site Commission, Comma nder \Villiam P. l\foCaun, U S.

Cmmrmuder Thomas refers in terms of commenclatiou to the untiring industry exhibited by Lieutenant \\~ood, an11 to the improvements introducecl by him in the details of chart corrections. Under Veutenant ,Jasper the efficieney of the Division has been kept up and important ad\·ances made. His anunal report of work accomplished accompanies the report of the liyllrogr~phic Inspector, and presents in a tabular form lists of hydrographic sheets plotted, Yerilletl, and inked during the yeltr, of reduced drawings of hydrography verified, revised, and corrected, aud of miscellaneous dranghting done, Messrs.

AilSTRA.CT OF THE ANNCA..L REPORT OF THE DISBURSI~G AGENT, U. S. COAS1' AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

On December :3, 1889, Mr. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Clerk of the Treasury Department, who had made tlrn disbursements for thA Coast ancl Geodetic Survey since the close of July, 1885, ~as relieved of the duties clev~lving upon him in connectiou therewith by Mr. John W. Parsons, who had qualified as Disbursing .A.gent of tlw Stuve;; by appointment of the Secretary of the Treasury under date of November 7, 1880. The annual report of the Disbursiag Office for the fiscal year ended Juue 30, 1890, which is submitted by Mr. Parsons, is published as Appendix No. G to this volume. Accompa.uyiug it will be fonlHl the statement of the expenditures of the Survey for tlrn fiscal year, which, by Section 2fi4 of the Revised Statutes, is required to be submitted annually to Cougress . .l\lr. I>arsous observPs that some little time will yet be required before such changes in methods of keeping accounts for both the field and the office as have been demanderl by the appointment of a Disbursing Ageut for the Sun·ey can be thoroughly systematized, antl made to result, aR ultimately they will, in economy of time and money. BLit the great advantage of the Survey's ha·.ing its own disbursing officer bas already become apparent. The accounts rendered to the Depa.rtment during the pa:st fiscal year have almost uniformly been passe(l by the accounting officers of tlie Treasury, but few items having been objected to, aml tlic explanations with regard to these having been satisfactory. From the Atatistics submitted by Mr. Parsons showing the details of work in bis office, it is e·i<lent that nuremittiug and intelligent labor bas been needed on the part of himself and coacljntors to keep his l>ooks up to datti. He acknowledges faithful and capable service rendered by Mr. Willia.tu H. Lanman, clerk, and by Miss Paula E. 8mith, writer.

CONCLUSION.

The de\-elopment. of tlrn resources of A I ask a, and its increasing importance. as a valuable pm1sessiou of tht> U11ited States, has induced the Superintendent to advance as rapid!,\' as possible tlw sn1Teys of its coasts and waters, and to issue preliminary charts based 011 these Sllt\'eys as soon as their results can be made a ntilabll.'. B.v his direction Mr. Charles ,Tnnke11 has been employed as a civilian expert in the reduction an1l a<ljirntment of the triangulation mmle in the course of t!:e li_ydrographic reconnaisisance of southeastern Al<isk<t.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF OFFICE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR THE
ENDING JUNE 30, 1890.
U. S.
COAST AND GEODETIC SUR.VEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., Ovtober 18, 1890. Sm: I have the honor to eubmit my annual report for the Office for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, and along with it the reports of tlie various Divisions thereof submitted by their respee ti vc chiefa, as follows: The Oompnting Division by Assistant Oharlcs A. Schott. 'rhe Drawing Divisiou by Assistant W. H. Dennis. The Engraving Division by Assistant H. G. Ogden. The Instrument Division by Assistant E. Smith. The Tidal Division by Mr. A. S. Christie, Computer. The Miscellaneous Di\'ision by l\L \V. \Vines, G-eneral Oflice Assistant. The {]hart Division by Assistant Gersliom Bradford. The Library and Archives by ~fr. A. 1\lartin, Libraria,n. It will be notetl that tlie Accounting Di,·ision no longer appears a,s a Di..-isiou of the Office. This change was ma.de when on the recommendation of the Superintendent tbe Honorable Secretary of the Treasury appointetl a Dishnrsing Agent for the Survey. This officer befog entirely under control of the Superintendent and dectling with. all the accounts of the Survey, it was deemed best t.o place the Disbursing Office iu the imme(liate office of the Superintendent. No written direction concerning this change has bceu given; it. was made on the verbal (1irection of the Superintendent, after a full nn(lerstau(liug- as to it.s tlesirability on the part of all eoncenH't1. The Office of Weight~ and l\Ieasnres being di:-;tinct from the Ooast ancl G-eotletic Snney Office, and by dirPction of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury placed under t.bc Snperintenilent of the Coast and Geodetic SmTey, he has deeitled not to continue it under the form of a .Di\'i~ion of the Ooast and Geodetic SLuvey Office, either in form or in fact, but to have it under his especial care, the Assistant fo charge of the details of 'Vcig-h ts and Measures work bein~ attach ell to the Superiutendentls immediate office and reportiug directly to him. No written inRtructions have been issue<l concerning· the matter, hnt the chang-e was made in accordance with tlrn Snperintendent's verbal instructions given after a, tlrnrougli understanding of the matter on the part of all concerned. 'fhe Computing Division has producetl the usual amount of valuable scientific matter and lrns kept up with the demands for routine work dnring the year. The Drawing Division presents the usual statistics. Great difficulty is experienced in securing the serdces of suitable draughtsmen; all have to be trained, and salaries are so small in the lower grades that after the young men become proficient they often find more lncrath-e employ. ment and leave us. There has been 292 days' work upon tracing, etc., from onr original sheets to supply demands of persons not connecterl with the Stuvey. Taking into cnnsidcration the time lost by interruptions occasioned in filling these demamls there is cons1m1ffi abont all the time of one draughtsman dnring the year. If the Drawing Division could be relieYed of this it would help mncll.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The Engra\ing Division has put out a larger number of charts than duriug any previous year. It bas reached tbe limit of its capacity to produce with the present facilities and I respectfully urge that both the plant and personnel be increased and that additional room be prm·ided. The Instrument J)ivision coul<l not be "brought to any satisfactory state of efficiency with the old force. Assistant Andrew Braid had displayed both energy and skill in the administration of the affairs of the Di\·ision, but some of the older employfa could not reconcile themselves to new methods and various changes had to be made in the force. Tl1e new men give new life to the work and perform their dnties cheerfully and satisfactorily. Some alterations in the rooms occu11ied are necessary, hut only such as are absolutely required will be undertaken pending the action of Congress in provitling more space. The Tidal Division has progressecl satisfactorily with its work and is improving gradualJy in efficiency. Some transfers aud appointments made in its force have tended much to strengthen it. This Di>1sion pres1mts to-tlay the broadest and most advantageous field for research and investi· gation of any in the Snrwy. The Miscellaneous Division is well conducted and it is largely due to its good management that we have such gratifying increases in the sale of our publications. Tbe umuher of agencies needs to be increased, but in order to do this an additional clerk is absolutely necessary. The Uhart Division while proficient within itself is much crippled and the efficiency of the sen·ice seriously impaired by our inability to supply charts as fast as called for. At the end of the fiscal year its books showed 1,000 charts called for that we could not suppl,y. No one can be belcl responsiule for this. The public begins to know of and to appreciate the cllarts; as they are more widely known they are more in demand and this demand has finally outgrown our ability to supply. l\Iore facilities for priutiug must be furuishecl if we are to meet tl.1e demauds of the public. Tue Library arnl Archives submits the usual statistical information. This Didsion ranks ;,;e1·0111l in importance to 110 other Division in the Office. It 11eeds thorough re-organization, more help, awl a better utilization of the space at its disposal. The fact that our necessities compel us to carry on certain of tl1e operations incidental to the printing of the cu arts from the copper plates in the ha;,;ement of the Archives lmilding, that this requires the use of much infl.ammal.Jle rnaterhil and a constant fire, tlms endangeriug much \aluahle property, has been calleu to the attention of the proper authorities and they have made repeated recommendations to Uongress looking to an abatenwnt if J1otentire eradication of this evil, hut as yet no relief has been obtained. It is a serious matter aml should be promptly attended to. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890, the fo1lowing-nametl pcrsous liave been emplo_yed llllllPr my immediate direction : Dr. \\rm. B. French has con tinned to asBist me in matters of executive detail, to receirn and acconut to me for all moueys from sales of charts, publications, ohl property, etr~.; has ai<Jed in the ofiice corresponuence, received all office bills, adjusted and arranged them on vouchers in proper. form for rny approval, anu tiled a copy of each bill.. Ile has prepared quarterly statements of rnoney1:-1 r('cei vcd, and they Lave been rendered to the Treasury Department arnl the money deposited with the 'l'reasurcr of the United States. Mr. H. l\I. HarTry receipted for and received express packages; registered a large percentage of the mail, forwarded and incoming, and filed correspondence until December 7, when his cou· nectiou with the Snrrny ceased. . Mi.;;s F. B. Bailey acted as stenographer and typewriter during the year aml kept the learn-of absence accouut. Her services have been satisfactory. ~liss F. Gadel has used her typewriter iu a variety of miscellaneous cop;ying during tbe year, in preparing stencils for the" neost;yle," and in tabular statements from the various Divisions of the Oflice. Iler work shows incrased care and bas been highly satisfactory. ::\Iiss K. Lawn also has used her typewriter during tbc year in copying for the annual report under the direction of its editor and in miscellaneous copying, and has been efficient and diligent
as usmtl.

l\Iiss C. B. Tt1rnbull has been occupied in misce11aneous copying, addressing envelopes for monthly Notices to Mariners and for occasional Bulletins, also in copying instructions. On May 27 her resignation was accepted.

Mrs. J. Waddill copied field records until August 10, when she wa.s transferred to the Treasury Department. Mr. E. B. Wills has remained Oil duty dnring the year registering the mail and attending to express matter received and forwarded, arnl has assister! in the miscellaneous work of the Division. Miss I. M. Peck reported for duty lllay 10 and has addressed wrappers for Notices to Ma,riners, copied instructions, and assisted in the Office correspondence. The following-named persons whose salaries are provided for under the bead of" Pay of Office force" have been detailed for special duty, as follows: John Parsons, Accountant in the Disbursing Office, under the immediate control of the Superintendent. He qualified as Disbursing Agent of the Surny under authority givell by the Secretary of the Treasury Sovernber 7, 1889. William B. Chilton, Clerk in the Office of the Superintendent, under his special direction. Ferdinand 'Vestdahl, Draughtsman, Frank vY.Edmonds, Clerk, and Vicente Denis, Messenger, with Assistant George Davidson, ill charge of the Sub-Office at San J?raneisco, Cal. E. Willenbucher, Wiiliam C. vVillenbucher, F. C. Donn, and E. H. \Vyvill, Draughtsmen, and J. H. Roeth, Clerk, in the Office of the Ilydrographic Inspector. In my report for the fiscal year 1889 I said: '' Along witli increased proficiency and business comes increased lallor of all kinds, and the Office has now about reached the limit of its capacity with the present force." Concemiug tliis statement, I think that there has beeu no differeuce of opinion among tlmse aware of all of the circlllnstauces, and effort to meet absolute reqnirementis for work, to promote the efficiency of the service by improving the proficiency of its person11el, and to compJJ· Rtrictl~y with the letter and spirit of the Civil Service laws, has not been overlooked dtniug the past year. Not a remonil has lleen made in any case that has not been solely and absolntpJy for the vurpose of promoting the efficiency of the public service, and not an appointment has been recowrnendt"tl or made ex:cept with this object iu view. It has been hopetl that by proceeding very slrm]y and deliberately any persons not performing their work satisfactorilj, wouhl take waruing and improve. In some instances this has been the case and the disagreeable dllt.r of making an adn·rse report has been avoided. In other instances the parties concerned have not profited by ad\ice or warning. There have been no deaths in the office force during the year. The duties of Mr. F. M. Thorn as Superi11tendent of the U. S. Coast aml Geodetic Surrey ceased with ,lune 30, 1889. His resignation, at the re<ruest of friends, irns withl!el1l for a time at the beginning of President Harrison's administration, and when tendered later was uot acted upon. lVlr. Thorn called the attention of tl!e President aml of the Secretary to tile fact that in his opinion the Office of Superintendent would be vacant ou July 1, on account of a dam;e in the appropriation bill providing for tlle position and salary, in which it was required that tlie Superintemlent of the U. S. Coast and GeOlletie Survey be ''appointed by tl1e President by and with tbe advice alld consent of the Senate." On July l, 1889, Mr. Thorn, without an;r forni<tl action Oil the part of the President or the Secretary,eeased to perform duty as Supcrintendeu t, being uncertain in his own mirnl whether under the circumstances his official acts would be considered legal. On July 2 the Secretary instructed me to perform the duties of Superi11tendeut so far as necessary for the proper conduct of the work. I performed these duties under the Secretars's direction until July 8, when you were :tppointed Superintendent by the President. l subsequcntl_y looked after the work for a!Jout 30 days under your direction aucl pendiug tbc time whcu ;you coulcl arrange your affairs so as to admit of your taking charge of the work in detail. In conclusion, I beg to express my gratificn,tion n,t the con tinned able support that I haxe received from the Chiefs of the several Divisions of the Office, and to thank yon for tlw courtesy which yon have shown me personally and the consideration whicll you have extended to me in the performance of my various duties.

REPORT O.F THE COMPUTISG

DlrISIU11~ D". S. COAST AND GEODETIC ST!RVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR E1·WING JUNE 30, 1690.

COMPUTING DIVISION, June 30, 1890. Sm: In conformity with regulations, I have the honor to submit herewith the usual annual report of work done in tile Computing Di1ision during the fiscal yeareuding with June 30, 1890. 'l'lle charge of tlle Uompnting Dh'isiou was continued with tile muJersigned; the personnel remained the same as last year. Temporary assistance W'l.S given by assigning to duty as computers Assistant E. Smith from July 1 to December 9, 1889; Sub-Assistant H. A. :Marr from October !W, 188fl, to the close of January, 1800; Assistant C. II. Sinclair from November 27, 1889, to February 25, 1890. Mr. J.B. Boutelle was relieved from duty in the Computing Dilision February 28, 1890; JI.Ir. L. J. Schultz, magnetic observer, received instructions in observing and computing between March G and '.:8, 1890; Mr. F. A. Young was engaged in the Computing Division from April 2 to .Tuue 15, 1890; l\Ir. D. L. Ilazard was connected "ffith this Di,-ision on the part of the State of Massaclmsetts on December 13, 1889, aml was engaged ou computations connecting· the triangulation during the years 1885-'89 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey with the State town-boundary Sll!Te~·. It is only with tllis temporary assistance gi>eu that the regular computing force is able to keep pace witll the demands of t.Ue Surrey for results. The duty of directing awl supen·ising tbe work of the computers and of reporting the results, as well as the furnishing of iuformation in connection witli the scientific correspondence of the Survey reforred to me, has been promptl.v discharged. During the time I could spare from these duties I completed the discussion ( seveutll edition) of the accumulated material for the secular variation of t!Je magnetic declimitiou; this paper forms Appendix No. 7, Report for 1887-'88; I also brought out a seeoml edition, for publication in tbe Report for 1888-'89 of the distribution of the magnetic declination in the U niterl States and adjacent parts for the epoch 1890; this paper is based upon the re:.mlts at 3,2:37 observing istations and is accompanied by three charts. ·with the assistance of Mr. Bauer, l was able to bring out th!'. results of the absolute measures of the declination, iuclinati011, and intensity taken at the rnaguetic obsernttory at I1os Angele,:; during tlie .senm ;years, 1882-'89, also to submit the differential otsen'ations of the declination, made at the same place, to analysis and discussion, the lattei· papRr comprisin~ more than 611000 hourly readings. It includes the exposition of the ltmar an<l solar rotation effect on the liorizo11tal magnet. These 11apers form Parts I and II of the results from the Los Angeles observatory, and arc designed to appear in the Heport for 18b!J-'90. I also brougllt out Bulletin No.13 (Telegraphic determination of the longitude of ]fonnt Dam ii tou, Oal. ), aml Bulletin No. 14 {Approximate times of culminations and elongations and of the azimutl1s at elongation of l'o1aris for the :years between 1889 and 1910); also, in connection with Assistant 'rittmanu, Bulletin No. 17 (Relations between certain metric standards of length). The dnties demanded as Civil Ser\·ice examiner were attended to, as well as iuoof-reading of certain appi.rn!liees in the 1887-'88 Report. A.u account of the work performed by ea.ch computer during the fiscal year is herewith preseutell in detail; it is made up from the dail:f and monthl;v reports. gtI ward H. Uonrteuay continued the adjustment by least i:-:quares. of the secondary and tertiar;r triangulations, \'icimty of New York City; made satisfactory progress with the least square adjustment. of the 1;npplcmentary (since the publication of results in Ueport for 1885) triangulation in !llassaclrnsettN iu connection with the State survey, omitting, however, all computations of positions iu which the Coast and Geodetic Survey is not directly iuterested; these latter are in the halllls of 1\ir. Hazard. l\Ir. Courtenay bas charge of the geographical registers and supplies the field parties with geodetic data required by them; he has also charge of the duplieate records of the Snrn:y pertaining to geodesy, astronomy, and magnetism, and supervises the work of Mr. J. B. Boutelle and Mr. D. L. Hazard. l\fyrick II. Doolittle completed the local adjustment of angular measures at primary stations iu Oiiio and Kentucky, 1883-'87; computed the base lines I'oint au Ohevreuil and Atchafalaya giver, Louisiana, 1889, and the triangulation of 1888-'89 of Atchafalaya Ilay and River and adjusted the coast triangulation between Bara.t&ria. Bay a.nd Atchafa.laya Bay, J;ouisiaua. Mr.

Doolittle made the figure adjustment of the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel between longitudes s20 and 84° in West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, involving 35 equations; attended to the station au<l figure a,(ljustments of the triangulation between St Louis and ,Jefferson Uity, Mo., involving 49 equations for the conditions of.figure; attemled to the same adjustments for the triang:11lation between Jefferson City and Kansas City, J\Io., involving 50 conditions of figure, and co11ti11ned the abstracts of 11irections and station adjustments of this triangulation in eastern Kansas, 18,'l:-J-'87. Henry Farquhar completcJ t!te computation for latitude of Station Piney, \V. Va., 18C:\J, compu tl'!l the la~itudes of Stations Needles an<l ~iotmt Hamilton, Cal., 1888-'8!), of Portlanu, On·gou, 181'7, of Camon Oity, Nev., 188f), of Yaquina, Oregon, 1888, of Seattle, \Yash., 1888, of Walla Walla, ·was 11 ., 1887, aml of Station Balch (Portland), Oregon, 188G, com nH~11crt1th e computation for la ti tudc of Howlett, N. Y., 18K~, and made progress with the latitude comptitation for .Altoona, Pa., 1S!JO. Mr. Farquhar also supplied the mean places of stars required b;y field parties, a labor of some magnitude, irn-olving the use of all availaule st<ir ca ta 1ogues (the latest being the (}reenwich 10· year catalog11e, 1877 to 1S8G); the proper motioll and the probable error in deelinatiou are 'rnrked out for each star, excepting fundamental stars. Louis A. Bauer completetl the computation of tlrn magnetic declinations, tlips, and intensities observed b;r Assii;t~nt Baylor, ill 1888, and b:y Suh Assist:rnt l\larr, in 18C:\!); reYised office computations for telegraphic difference of longitude obserrntions of 188.'i-'87, assisted me in the preparation of the }lll}H~rs on the distribution of magnetic declination in the United States by reducing the obsen'ed values to the epoch 1890 and platting the same (about 3,000 statious); computed the obsern1tious for declination, dip, and intensity malle monthly (on three days), at :Los .Angeles, Cal., between 1882 and 1889, and assisted me in the preparation of Parts I and II of the magnetic results at. that observatory, and in particular marked and tabulated the magnetic disturbances in the hourly rec<>rd, and made the necessary tabulation of the differential readings according to lunar liours and phase of the moon. Mr, Bauer also superdsed the work llone by Mr. Young, and attended to proof-reading aml otller miscellaneous work. Charles H, KnmmeU was engaged on geodetic computations, abstracts of angles, triangle side, and position cornpntations and miscellaneous revisions; checked and solved normal equations prepared by Afr. Uourtenay in connection with the adjustment of the secondary triangulations iu Massachusetts and in New York. l\fr. Kummell also computed the triangulation of Duwamish Bay, \'Vashington, 1886, and revised the conditional and normal eq nations of the triangulatioo in Missouri (St. Louis and Kansas City), before they were solved by :\fr. Doolittle. ,John R Boutelle was principally engaged in revising abstracts of angles, com1)Uting triangle sides, and making position i111d miscellaneous computations uu<kr the direction of lilr. Courtenay. Ile also collected g-eodetic data for field parties, and atten.ded to the copying of scientific reports, and assist1~tl iu tluplica.tiug the hourly differential readings of the magnetic declination at Los Angeles, .lames Page. made miscellaneous revisions of magnetic comptltatiomi, and plotted positions; tabulated angles and computed triangle sides of tlie supJllementary triangulation about Uharle.s· ton, S. C., 188!); established the coefficients of a set of ten normal equations relatillg to distrilmtion of magnetic declin:ttion in Alaskan waters ; computed the position of the J effernon pier, District of Columbii1; aided Mr. Courtenay in verifyiug or re>ising abstracts of angles and other computations of the triaugnlatious of New York and of l\fassachmetts, and l\fr. Doolittle in revising his abstracts of directions, triangulations of' :Missouri and Kansas. William C. l\:laupiu was engaged in supplying the descriptions of ::>tations and sketches of trigonometrical Rtations req nired by field aml hydro graphic parties, inserted resulting positions in the geographical registers, and attended to miscellaneous clerical duty. Temporary assista.nce to the Computing Division was rendered as follows: .Assistant E. Smith computed the following tel~grapbic differences of longitude: Salt Lake City, Utah, and Sau Francisco, La Fayette Park, Ca.I., 1887; San Francisco, La Fa;yette Park, and Wa&hington Square, 1887; San Francisco, La Fayette Park, and Portland, Oregou, 1887; Portia.ml, Oregon, and Walla.

.:\larshall P .·Jackson and Ed \\in Hose were principally employed in making traciu gs of original in answer to demands from other departments aml private parties. Mr. Hose resigned 011 the 15th of January and Mr. Jackson on the 7th of .Tune, 1800. l\fr. Charles II. Dietz was also employed 011 tracings in answer to outside calls, and in clerical work from .July l to January 14, when he was sent to the field, returning on the 7th of May, when he resumed llis work. Mr. G. F. Poblers was appointed as draughtsman on the 27th of March. He liafi been e11g:aged in making diagrams illustrating the Gulf Stream currents, and for the Annual Report of tin· Superi11t('!Hlent. The DiYision has been considerably crippled by the resignations mentioned above; it ia diilicult to find draughtsmen skilled in the work called for by the Survey. Of the four who have left the sen·ice, three were valuable assistants, and the fourth, Mr. Rose, gave promise, with practice, of being so, and thus far we have only been able to fin(l one, Mr. Pohlers, to replaco

Notwitllstanding the reduced force, the amount of work accomplished will compare favorably with that of previoas yea,rs, especially when the size and character of the new charts <He consiuered, and that 2!B days work of a good draughtsman, as well as much of the time of the Chief of the Division, was co11sumell in making tracings aml furnishing information in aus1ver to requ,ests from the other Departments and private parties. The" work of the Division during the year may be summarized as follows: Sen'nteen drawings of charts for publication by pilotolithography were completed, and the eh,irts publi;,;lled; the drawiugs of thirteen charts aml five maps we!'e revised and corrected fur pllotolitllogl'.q1liic
reprints; sixty sketches and illustrations were dra,wu or revised for the H0port of the Superintendent for the fiscal year 1888; three drawings were finis lied of clrnrts for public,1tion IJy photolithography which could not be published for want of funds; the drawing,; of twenty-four charts for publication from engraved plates were cnmpletcll, and the drawings of twenty charts were revised aud corrected for new editions from engraved plates. Drawings were furnished to the Engraving Division for two hundred and sixteen corrections or changes on engra>ed plates. Forty.nine topographical sheets were inked, and uincty-1ive field projections made.

The engravers were cmpioyed during· the year priucipa.lly as follows: H. M. Knight, A. Petersen, J. G. Thompson, H. 1~. Bartle, jr., and H. L. Thompson on lettering; W. A. 'rhompson on topography and sanding; ,T. Er1thoffer, R. F. Bartle, and E .· J. En th offer on topography; H. C. Bvans on sanding; E. If. Sipe 011 miscellaneous correctiorrs and lettering; 'l'. '\¥ asserbach and '\V. H. Davis on miscellaneous corrections and additions; \V. A. Van Doren, A. H. Sefton, and E. A. Kuhel on outlines and lettering. All of the engravers except those employed on contract work htive been engaged at cliffereut times on the miscellaneous corrections and additions to the printi!lg plates arising from resurveys and changes in aids to navigation. This class of work consume(l time equivalent to tliat of three and a half men, a slight reduction over tlie preceding year, when the time of fonr men was required. The average time required to correct a plate and the perccntagt~ of printing 11Iatcl'l requiriug correction were ahm less than for t.he vreceding year. The numl>er of platl~s cumpleteu cluring tlie year is greater than for any year in my experience; a result, it is true, that was anticipated from the larger force employed in the office, but is nevertheless gratif~\·ing as demonstrating the prncticability of increasing the product of tile Division \fitl1out incurring too great expense. Thii yea1Js work has shown material progress towards completing the ··Coast Charts" aud "Genera.l Coast Charts;" on the Atlantic a1Hl Gulf coasts; of the former we now require only Nos. 101 on the coast of ::\Jaine and No. lJG on tue coast of North Carolina, to fiI}ish the series from the northeastern boundary to the Mississippi River; and of the latter No. Ga on the coast of .Maine aud No. 19 on the coast of Louisiana to complete the whole series from the northeastorn boundary to the Uio Grande. We ham also published Chart No. G71, San Diego to Santa, l\fonica, cumpleti11g the series of -ff,f<ioo charts 011 foe Pacific coast from the so11tberu bouudary to Cape ".\lt>1Hloei110, with the exception of' a gap betweeu Pt. Bucbon aud Pt. Pinos, where the snn-Pys are as yet incomplete. The revision of a number of important charts has been completed during th(· year and new e<litious publislietl showing the latest hydrographic surveys; among the nllm· her Boston Harbor, :Yew York Harbor, Approaches to Delaware Bay, St. Simon's Sound, aud Brnirnwick Harbor, Florida Bay, Atcbafalaya Bay and U.iver, and the Approaches to San I?raucisco. l\lr. D. C. Chapman has coutirmed in charge of the Electrotype and Puotograph rooms, assisted by .1\Ir. f,, P. Keyser. The requiremeuts in both branches run al>cmt the same as during the pre· cetli11g- year. 1'bree alto plates were ma.de for the Hydrographic Office, Niwy Department. Mr. F. J\Ioore ha.s remained in charge of the Priuting Office during the year, assisted by 1\Iessrs. Hoover, Beck, and Oraufurd, printers, and the usual number of helpers. Seven thousand two hundred and fifty-four more prints were furnished to the Chart Division than during the preceding year; but this number was not sufficient to meet the demand for charts, and would have

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

135

been increased by several thousand b.ad the appropriation for printing permittetl the employment of printers for the small press during the last four mouths of the year. Under these circumstances I cannot urge too strongly the necessity for the increased facilities I have brought. to your attention in successive years past as greatly needed, and that were included in the Superintendent's estimates for the current year. Mi. John H. Smoot has continued to perform the clerical dnties of the Dh·ision with great satisfaction as heretofore, and I cannot too earnestly commend to your attention' his zeal and fidelity. The clerical work has so largely increa:Setl that it greatly interferes with the im1iortant function of proof-reading, now, also, largely iucrea-ieu througll the more fr~quent necessity of making new printing plates; and I must therefore urge upon yon again the assignment or an additional bookkeeper. The customary list of chart-plates completed, commenced, and in progress during tlle year is submitted herewith for file in the Archives. Respectfully, yours, HERBERT G. 0G-DEN, Assistant U. S.

The facilities of the instrument shop have been increased by the purchase of a No. 2 toolgrinding machine by Brown and Sharpe, a large supply of small tools, and a new lathe by Francia Ilill, which latter will not become availaule till September next. Several changes in tl.ie force of the instrument shop have lleen made during the _rear, and it is safe to state that at this date the shop has reached a very satisfactory degree of efficiency, and by keeping up the present standard a greater amount of first-class work will be turned out in the future. Tbe carpenter shop is part of this Division and is really au essential part of the instrument· shop. It bas done a large amount of construction and repairs for instruments having wooden parts, made all wooden patterns for castings, au cl all imcking boxes for instruments to be sent to the field, etc. This shop bas also during th.is last year done a large amount of general carpentry work for the office, the details of which are given in the monthly reports. The force of this Division during this past year has been as follows: Assistant Andrew Uraid, Chief of Division, July 1 to December 18, 1889; Assistant Edwin Smith, Chief of Divisiou, December 19, 1889, to June 30, 1890; R. C. Glascock, clerk; William West, messenger; E.G. Fischer, chief mechanician; E. M. Eshelman, mechanician, July 1, 1889, to April 1:.!, 1890; L. A. Fisher, mechaniciau, July 1 to October 10, 1889, at which latter date he was assigned to duty in the Ofllce of Weights and Measures, and on February 18, 1890, he was permanently transferreu to that office; r. Vierbuchen, mechanician, July 1, 1889, to April 30, 1890; S. A. Kearney, mechanician; 0. Storm, mechanician; 1\1. Lauxman, mechanician; W.R. Whitman, mechaniciau, February 20 to June 30, 1890; 0. E.

r. 8. COAST AND GEODETIC Sr'"RVEY OFFICE, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDLYG Jc]\'E 30, 1890.
TIDAL DIVISION, July 10, 18\)0,

SIR: I_ have the honor to Sllbmit in duplicate tliis my report of the Tidal J)i\·isiou for the :tlscal year ending June 30, 1890. The work done during the year may be summarized as followR: l. An aggregate of 3 years 9 months of record from automatic ti(le gauges with accompanying tabulated half-hollrly heights of the sea, high and low waters, temperature and density of tlrn sea and meteorological data, 103 original and 102 duplicate volumes of observations from staff and box gauges, have been received, examined, and registered, and :.?82 letters prepared. 2. The Tide Tables for the Pacific coast for the :rear 1890, an octarn of 105 pages, ha.-e lieen read and differenced in proof. The Tide Tables for the Atlantic and Pacific coasts for the :year 1891, two octavos of 250 and 111 pages, respectively, h<n-e been prepared and read and difiereuced in proof. In the volume for the ~<\..tlantic coast, the current tables have l>een extendell to include 12 stations in New York Harbor aml approaclies and 3 stations in Delaware Bay and Ri\·er. In the volume for the Pacific coast, type curves with accompanying explanatory text ham been introduced to aid the mariner in an intelligent use of the tables. 3. ':J.'ide notes have been prepared and furnished for 131 stations for 1JUblicatiou on 33 charts, and for 62 stations for publication in the Coast Pilot. 4. Thirty-nine requisitions from field parties have been filled. This includell the preparation of descriptions of 151 tldal bench marks and the computation of half.monthly mean sea level at stations in the Gulf-Key West, Fort Morgan, and Biloxi-for an aggregate of 3~ years. 5. Tidal information, including 12 tide notes ancl descriptions of 56 tidal bench marks, has been prepared and furnishetl in reply to 42 calls from persons not connected with the Survey. 6. Harmonic analyses of tides have been made as follows: Eastport, Me., 1862, has been twothirds finished; Boston, Mass., 1869, one-sixth; Sandy Hook, N. J., 1S87, and 1888, each one-half, and Sausalito, Cal., 1889, one-half finished-that is, the equivalent of two and one-third years completed. 7. :Non.harmonic "1st reductions'' have been made of 63 series, the equivalent of about 9 years of continuous observations, and "2d reductions" of 4 series, the equiv~lent of abollt 5 years of continuous observations. 8. The Superintendent's Annual Reports, the Coast Pilots, the charts, and the records in the archives have been examined in detail and memoranda presen·ed in the form of a card catalogue, by means of which everything hitherto done ~Y the Survey in observation, reduction, and publication of currents may be readily found. This places us in position to collect rapidly and present eYefything of value already attained, and to pusl1 forward the work of observation and reduction intelligently along the best lines. Reductions for fifteen stations have been made and the results introduced into the tide tables for 1891. 9. Au elaborate comparison of })rediction by means of Prof. .Ferrel's tide pretlicting machine with observation by means of automatic gauges, has been made for the year 1889 for Sandy Hook, N. J. The results, which are very satisfactory, will be made the subject of a special report. The following is a statement of the general character of the work of each computer or clerk: Mr. L. P. Shi<ly has been engaged in the responsible work of revising and differencing the tide tables in manuscript and in proof, contributing to their completeness and accuracy; in pre· paring and revising data to fill requisitions, and in inspection, interpretation, and reduction of defective records. Mr. J. W. Whitaker made the major part of the predictions with the machine for the ~;ear 1891, summed the harmonic components for Sandy Hook, 1887, made some non-harmonic reductions and assisted in preparing data, reading proof, etc. Mr. Whitaker was transferred from this Division May 20. Miss A. G. Reville examined and registered the records received, copied reports, sketches, and descriptions of bench-marks and other data, and tabulated tides. Miss Reville does a large amount Qf work of good quality.

UNITED STATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Mrs. Virginia Harrison made non-harmonic reductions, summed harmon!c components, taliu· lated tides, copied sketches and descriptions of bench-marks, copied and differenced predictions, and assisted in readillg proof. J\Irs. M. R Nesbitt predicted for Philadelphi~1 aud Baltimore from curves for 1891, computed mean predicted range of tide for botll coasts for 1891, summe<1 the harmonic components for Eastport, 181l2, and s<>n·ral for Sausalito, 188U, computed mean sea level at Key \Yest, Fort Morgan, and Biloxi, anu ma<le rt large number of non-harmonic reductions. ::\lrs. Nesbitt produces a large quantit:v of computation reasonably free from error. Mr. F. M. I;itt.le predicted Tiith the machine for New York and San Francisco, l 891, made uonhanuouic reductions, summed the harmonic components for Sandy Hook, 1888, and se>eral for Eastport, 180'.!, computed cDrrections to staff, and assisted in the preparntion of data. Mr. Little submitted a paper on JU arch '.!(), on the "Determination of the True Scale of a J\laregram, etc." l\Ir. ,John F. Hayford computed the amplitudes and epochs for machine prediction, 1891, pre· dieted for Newport and Port Townsend, 1891, with the machine, compared machine prediction with observation at Sandy Hook, 1889, selected 11rnl (lrew type cnr>e1'1 for the Pacific coast tide tables, compared the Mission Street, San Francisco, series with the simultaneous observatiousat Sausalito, prepared data to fill requisitions, investigated the subject of obsen·ation, reduction, and pull!ication of currents by the Sur\·ey, and reduced fifteen series of current obserYations. l\lr. Hayford has submitted a paper on" 'fhe Relation between the Harmonic Components of a Tidal Curve and its l\frau Amplitude;'' .a paper "On a Modification of the Ferrel Tide Predicting Machine t-0 adapt it to tile Prediction of Hourly Or<linates ;" a '' Heport on the Records of Current Observations, etc., and thP Use of the ObserYations for Prediction Purpose;;;" aud a re11ort which I am about to submit on the comparison of prediction with observation at Sandy Hook, 1889, is essentially his also. Mr. Hayford bas exhibited throughout the year a remarkable power for doing work, and improving our methods. Mr. Eugene Yeitb was attached to this Division Novemher J!) to 30, preparatory to taking charge of the tidal station on Tybee Island, Georgia. The cltarge of this Division, im·olving the distribution, supervision, and revision of work, preparation of tlie tide tables aml other data, has continued with the undersigned throughout the year. I lia>e given much attention to the improvement of the tide taules, to the correction and extpnsion of tidal data on charts and in the Pacific Coast Pilot, to the preparation of tidal results for publication, and the improvement of methods of reduction. I submitted in March n paper on a iww rnt'thod for the analysis of periodical phenomena. The intrnduction ofa Fell & Tarrant eight· keyed comptometer has facilitated our numerical work in a marked degree.

nespectfully' yours,
ALEX.

It gives me pleasure to testi(r to the general 1·fficiency of the Division, and to tbe markea indiYidual interest of those emplo~-ed in the work, evidenced by their earnestness in promoting the rnp11lit~- and accuracy of the Yarious operations in which they take part. As a result of more experience, v:trious improYements lrnni been made in the routine of chart receipts, corrections, and iss1ws, which have facilitateu tlrn work. A uotable one is the use. of a system of cards for a record of back orders (back order is a term used to designate those charts of any requi1:1ition which for some canse can not be supplie<l at tile time of the receipt of the requisition). 'l'he card system supplants tlw ordina.ry book method, whiclt had failerl to meet our wants. This accumulation of back orders ariSL'S almost excltu;ively from tlrn want of facilities for printing our charts, and all<1,.; largely to the work nf the Ullart DiYision, but the work is absolutely necessary for the S(·rvit'.(' ()f the public. Ifowe\'er mucll to be regretted, the hack-order list will continue to increase as th<· <lemand for clrnrts increases, unless the tlemand he met by increased facilities for chart supply. As the demand for charts is much greater during the summer months, it would be well if exrrn facilities for priJJting clrnrts could he proYided as early as Uarch. There were on our ba('k·on1n li,,it at the ewl of the fiscal year more than a thousand co~iies of <'.harts. Tl1P followillg tal1lc :-;hows t11 at the charts are gaining in fayor uotwithstauding the vexatious and prolonged llPJa:ys ·on acconut of our lack of printing facilities. This year's issue shows an iucre:urn on~r la:>t year's, of 30 per cent., and an increase of circulation through sale agents of 19 per eent. Tiw former sl1owi'I the gross increase of the work of the Division a,<; well as the demand for charts from all srmrce.-;, hut the latter is the direct measure of the increase(l popularity of the charts. Tlw issue of charts to Yesse!s of the Navy was about double this year as compared with the last. T11is wa,s largely due to the fitting out of a number of new vessels.

Twenty i;;ix: nilnmes of computations were hound durmg the fiscal year. A great mass of \aluaule records and computations Rtill remain unbound which ought to haYe been IJonud long ago for their pref:er\·ation arnl for convenience of reference and use. I baye repeatedly in my anuual n~p'Jfl:-l called attention to their comlition 1 and I would once more urge the importance of prompt action, so that these records and computations may be bound, re-arranged by States, and catalogued. During- the Ji"cal year eJl(ling June 30, 1890, there were received in the library :'134 Yolumes of bound books, and 115 -volumes of unbound books, besides pamphlets and the usual periodicals and publications of scientific societies. TIJese figures include duplicates and the various Nautical Almanacs. Two hundred and eighty Yolumes have been bound at the Government bindery for the librar_y during the fiscal year. l\fr. J. :'.\-I. J)nesberr,y has been employed in this Division as clerk throughout the fiscal year. Mr. Archie Uppermau was assigned temporarily to this Division June 12, 1890, and assisted in clerical work lluring the remainder of the fiscal year. l~espectfully, yours,

REPORT OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC INSPECTOR FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDIKG JUNE 30, 1890.
U. S. CO.AST AND GEODETIC SURVEY, OFFICE OF THE HYDROG-RA.PHIC lNSPEC'l'OR,

Washington, D. O., July 1, 1890. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the bydrographic work executed in the field, the routine office duties, repairs of vessels, aud tallles showing the number of naval officers and enlisted men attached to the several vessels of the Survey during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890. July 1, 188U, I relieved Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson,U. S. N., as Hydrograpbic Inspector to the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and it gives me pleasure to state that I found the vessels of the Survey in as good condition as conhl be possibly expected, taking into consideration th.e limited appropriation for repairs, the parties in the field thoroughl;r organized, and the routine of the office so admirably arrangecl aml systematized that it was a comparatively easy matter for me to continue the work as mapped out by my able predecessor; consequeutly no radical cllanges in the method of conducting the business of this office have been found necessarJ. The following is a general summary of the hydrography carrierl on during the fiscal year just closed:
ATLANTIC COAST.

Approaches to Nantucket Sound.-This work was commenced .July 11, 1889, b.r the steamer Bache and party, under the command of Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., and the season en<led October :n, 188U, when tbe Bache proceeded to Baltimore, l\Id., for the purpose of having some
slight repairs made previous to the winter's work iu the vicinity of the Florida Kess. Nantueket Sound.-'l'he continuation of this stuvey was in progress at the beginning of the :fiscal year by the schooner FJagre, the steamer Daisy, aml three steam Iauuches, and party, under the command of Lieut. \Villiam r. Elliott, U. S. N. The season closed October 19, when the vessels, launches, and pttrty returned to the U. S. Navy Yar<l Brooklyu, N. Y. Upon the cou· clusiou of the office work ill preparing the several projection sheets and records for transmission to the Superintendent, it became necessary to break np tbe party nnder the command of Ue11te11· ant Elliott, and distribnte the officers among other vessels .iu order to fill ,·acancies alltl keep the field parties up to their full strength. Coast of Jlfassaclwsctts.-Vicinity of Ca11e Cod. Inshore hydrograpby b;y Assistant IJ. L. Marindin, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Pennsylvania.-Water front of the city of Philadelphia, Schuylkill River. Hydrograpby by Assistant J. Ilergesheimer, Ooast and Geodetic Survey.
GULF COAST.

West coast of Fl<wida.-The Bache, after receiving slight repairs, left Baltimore, Md., January 1, 1890, under command of Lieut. J, F. Moser, U.S. N., and commenced work January 24 on the west coast from Punta Rasa to Cape Sable, in Florida Bay, Barnes' Sound, and Card's Sound; also Florida. Keys from Big Pine Key to Key West. The season closed May 17, 1890, and the hydrograp.lly, of the Florida Keys was completed.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST .AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The Survey is to be congratulated that this important and intricate piece of work was wholly executed under the immediate supervision of Lieutenant J\Ioser during the four consecutive seasons of 1887 to 18!)0 inclusive, and I do not hesitate to sa~~ that this bydrog-raphy, like all the rest performed by I,ieutenant :\loser, has never heen surpassed and seldom equaled by any other hydrographic party. lrcst coa8t of Florida.-Capc- Romano to Shark Hiver. Im;llore hydrograpby by Assistant J. Ilergesheimer, Coast and Geodetic Survey. Fluricla-Pensacola Bay.-The bydrography of Bayous Grande, Chico, and Texar was finished by 8uhassistant P.A. \Yelker, Coast and Geodetic SmTey, for the use of thn Gulf Coast Nrffy Yard Site Commission, Commodore ' ' illiam P. McCauu, r. S. N., president. H'c.st coast of Florida and Alal1ama.-Perdido Bay.-Ilydrograpl1y by Assistant Stehman Forney, Coast aml Geodetic Surn·y. Coast of Louisiana.-Tlle continuation of the bydrograpby bet1Yeen Terre Bonne Bay a.ml Shi11 t:lboal was commenced Decern ber lll, 188!!, by the steamer Bnclearor, aml party, under tbe command of Lieu:t. .A. L. Ball, U. S. N.~ and the season ended May 15, 1890. Owing to unfavor· alJle weather the quantity of work accomplished was much less than anticipated, but I am happy to state tllat the quality of the work pro·ed to be excellent when plotted and verified.
7

PACIFIC COAST.

Coast of Califomia.-The beginning of the fiscal year fonud the steamer Has8le~· and iiarty, under the command of Lieut. D. Delehanty, U. S. N., at work off the coast in the vicinity of Crescent City. The projections furnished to this party were completetl to the 100.fathoms curve in accordance with instructions, and the season ended July 30, 1889. Then the party proceeded to the vicinity of Cape Lookout to search- for reported rockti, returning to San Francisco August 19, and then commencing the preparation of the projection sheets and records for transmission to you. November 25, 1889, the Hassler left San Francisco, sailing to the southward, and on the 27th began work off the coast in the vicinity of Cox's Ilole and Cambria. Work was suspended December l!J, 188!!, on account of continuous bad weather, and the Hassler returned to San Francisco. She left port again Februar;y 12, 1890, for tl1e field, and resumed the survey on the 14tL. The season closed :March 27, when Lieutenant Delehanty returned to San Francisco with tlw vessel aud party under bis command for the completion of the office work and records. The two seasons were highlj successful, and the results, both in quantity and quality, were consistent with the reputation of the competent and energetic chief of party. 8an Francisco lJay and tributaries.-Owing to the long and unexpected delay in the completion of the new boiler for the steamer ,UcArthu,r at the U. S. YaVJ' Yard, Mare Island, Cal., that vessel, uwler the command of Lieut. Dennis Il. ;\J aban, U. S. N., was unable to commence the resurvey of BniHnll Bay arnl Yiciuit.r until April 1 of the present year. The work assigned to the party under Licuternrnt l\Jahan was somewhat in the nature of patchwork, being a resurvey of portions of the work done during tho winter of 1886-1887 in the viciuit.y of Suisun Bay and neartlrn mouth of the Sacramento Hin'r, mnch of tlle previous h,Ydrography being found erroneous and impossible to plot. This dnty wa" completeLl on the la,-;t day of the fiscal year, as anuouneed by telegram. Coast <if Orcgo11.-The opening of the fiscal year fonnll the steamer Ge1lney and partj·, under file command of Li<:nt. J. l\I. Ilelm, U.S. N., at work off the coast from Cape Blanco to Crook's Point,, the S(·:u:;on liaving commenced May 28, 1889, of the previous flscnJ .Yl·ar, aml enued September 11, 1889. The resnlts of this surve.v are thoroughly satisfactory in every respect. Lieutenant IT elm had served a tour of duty under the Coast Survey previous to bis present detail, and it gives me pleasure to add that he rnuks among the very best of hydrographers. Owing to the exhaustion of party fuuds it was impossible to employ the Gedney during the renrnimler of the past fiscal year, so advantage was taken of this opportunity by docking the vessel, thoroughly overhanling the hull fastening, and making other repairs much needed. Interior 1.ratcrs of Washington.-Lieut.J. N. Jordan, U.S. N., assumed command of the schooner Earnest Jnue 15, 1889, relieving Lieut. H. T. Mayo, U.S. N., who bad commenced field work fo the vicinity of Rosario Strait, on May 20, 1889, so that the beginning of the fiscal year 1889-1890 found tho season well advanced, and the hydrography wa.s most satisfactorily continued into

Semiahmoo Bay and Gulf of Georgia, under Lieutenant Jordan, until November 2, 1880, when the Earne.st and party returned to Port Townsend, Wash., and commenced the preparation of records for transmission to the Superintendent. The results as plotted and verified in the office are all that could be desirert. ApriJ 19, 1890, Lieutenant Jowlan and parts in the Earnest commenced their second season in Skagit Bay, Puget Sound, and are so emplo:yed at the present time. Wasltington-P·uget Sound.--Tue h;ydrography in the vicinity of Port Orchard was executed by Assistant J. F. Pratt, Coast and a·eodetic Surniy, for the use of the Pacific Coast :N°a·;r Yard Site Commission, Capt. A. '.r . .Mahan, U. S. N., president. Southe(l,st Alaska.-The long season in Alaska is continuous, covering portions of two fiscal years, generally beginning early in May arul closing the latter part of September; so July 1, 1889, found the Patterson and party, under the command of Lieut. II. B. l\Iansfielt.l, r. S. :X., with the small steamer Cosmos as tender, at work in the vicinity of Stephens Passage aud Frederick Sound. The season closed September 29, 1889, and the Patterson returned to San Francbcu on October 16 following. 'rlie preparation of the phenomenal amount of work accomplislled lJy the party under Lieutenant Mansfield occupied the time from the date of his return to San Francisco u11til April 10, 189(), the date of his again sailing for Alaska. Il.is sheets and data, h:we already heen submitted to you, and from them it will be seen that the quality of the results is only equalled by the quantity, and I am satisfied that the record of geueral work done has never been exceeded by any party, at any time, under the Coast Survey. It gives me pleasure to state that Lieutenant Mansfielcl received his well-deserved promotion to the grade of Lieutenant-Commander on January 3, 1890, so that when the Patterson left San Francisco, April 10, 1890, her commanding oflicer held the higher rank. The working ground was reached May 6, aml covers the vicinity of Lyun Canal, Chatham Strait, Saginaw aml Gastineau Channels, and Taku Inlet, tlms completing the survey of the extreme nortllern arnl interior waters of southeast Alaska. The Patterson1.~ party was still engaged on this work at the close of the fiscal year just ended. By your permission, Lieutenant-Oommander .Mansfield gave passage from San Francisco, Cal., to Juneau, Alaska, to an exploring party of five persons, under the charge of .M:r. E. II. 'Yells, for the purpose of making a reconnoissanee of the interior of Alaska in the vicinity of the Copper lliver, with the intention of following it from its source to its mouth. This party will rPjoin the PatterBOn at Juneau about the middle of next September, for transportation to San Fra neisco.
INVESTIGATION OF THE GULF STR.'EA.M.

Lieut. J.E. Pillsbury, U. 8. N.i commanding the steamer Blake, left Hampton Uoads November 18, 1889, with Lieut. 0. E. Vreeland, U. S. N., as his prospective relief, for the continuation of the inye;;;tigatiou of the Gulf Stream in the Gnlf of Mexico, and in order that Lieutenant Vreeland might have the benefit of his predecessor's personal experience and instruction in the method of coudu{!ting this important work. On December 12, 1889, Lieutenant Vreeland rnlien>d .Lieutenant Pillsbury of the command of the Blake, the latter officer returning to the \Yaslling'to11 Ollico for the purpose of obtaining data from the archives, and for the preparation and compiling of l1is exhaustive report upon the Gulf Stream, derivcl from bis five years' experience on this work, the results of which will surely be of immense benefit to navigation, and of grea.t interest to th(~ 8cientific world. At the end of the fiscal :yeal' Lieutenant Pillsbury is still engaged upoa his report, which be hopes to conclude by tho latter part of next October. .Lieutenant Vreeland occupied about thirty stations in the Gulf of Mexico, suce('Ssfnlly con· tinning the investigation so ingeniously iuaugiuated by his predecessor, closing the season iu time to reach Hampton l{oads by April 9, 1890.
SPECIAL EXAl\11NA'l'IONS AND SEARCH FOR REPORTED DAN'GERS.

The following is a summary of the work executed by the several vessels of the Survey under the above heading: Steamer Bache, Lieut. J. F. Moser, U. S. N., ccmi.manding.-On returning from the completion of the survey of the Florida Keys to Baltimore, Md., this officer was directed to stop at St.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Simon's Sound, Georgia, and make an examination of the bar near the entrance to Brunswick, Ga., for a reported increase in the ·depth of water. He was engaged upon this work 1\fay 16and17, and found a Yery slight increase over that previously indicated on Coast Survey charts, which have since been corrected in accordance with this examination. Scltooncr Eagre, Lieut. Wm. P. Elliott, TI. S. N., comrnanding.-After the conclusion of the season's work in Nantucket Sonnd, and while lying at the U.S. N~wy Yard, Brooklyn, N. Y., Iiieutenant Elliott, with one of the steam launches belonging to the Eagre, assisted by Ensign E. A. Anderson, U. S. N., templ)rarily detached from the Coast Pilot Division of this office, made a. close hydrogragraphic snr·\·ey of 'VallalJout Channel. This work was done hy your instructions between J au nary 15 and February 7, 18GO, in response to a re<Jl1est from the Honorable Secretary of the Xavy, for the purpose of accurately developing the channel previous to commencing much needed dredging. .A shoal spot, with only 17 feet of water 01cr it, having been reported to exist outsi<le of the 4-fathom curve to the southward of the Battery, ~ew York City, by a witness before au atlmiralty court iu a collisiou case, Lieutenant Blliott, under instructions from ~-onrself, was directed to make a thorough examination of the locality specified; and, between the dates March 20 and April 2, whenever the weather would permit, a minute search was made; tlrn lines of soundings were mn as close together as possible, crossed and recrossed, the result being that the reported shoal or lerlge was provetl to he a myth. This f\xamination, however, showed that tbe 4-fathom cur\'e had extended out slightly from the Battery since the last survey was made, and Lieutenant Elliott \\a8 therefore directc1l by you to deYelop the changes in this curve from Pier No. 1, North River, to Uoeuties Slip, East Wnn'. TLis work was executed between May 22-27, and the charts of New York Harbor lrn,\'e lJeeu corrected accordingly. Ellis Island having been designated as tlrn new immigrantlanding station, the Honorable Secretar;r of the Trnasury made a request to you for a resurvey of the waters immediately snrronnding tl1·1 island in order that tile bottom might be accurately devcloperl previous to building wharves out to deep water. This work was executed by Lieutenant Elliott between April 16-21, and in its prosecution he was assisted by l'.lnsign Anderson, who was again tempora· rily <fotached from the Office for this duty. Steamer Endeavor, Lieut. Commander S. M. Ackley, U. S. N., comnwnding.-June 20, 1890, made an examination for a reporte(l shoal off 'Volf Trap Spit, Chesapeake Bay; found and de1·eloped shoal, and correction on charts will be made when next printed. A sunken rock, not cllarted, haviug been reported off Easby Point, Potomac River, opposite the city of Washington, Assistant H. L . .Uarindin, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was detailed by the Superilltenc!ent to make an examination for the reported danger. The rock was found with 9 feet of water over it, and the charts affected have been corrected accordingly. Stemncr Emle£ivor, .Lieut. A. L. Hall, U. S. N., comman11ing.-A 9·foot shoal having been reported off the northern end of Key Biscayne, east coast of Florida, causetl by the grounding of a vessel laden with barrels of cement, many of which were thrown overboard in order to lighten lier, Lieutenant Hall was directed to exawine the shoal while making passage froru the coast of I,ouisiana to 'Vashingtou, D. C. Tllis investigation was made May 31 and June 1, and the result showetl the least depth of water to be 12 feet. The correction has been made upon the charts affected. Steamer lla8sler, Lie1a. I>. Delehanty U. S. N., commanaing.-August 14-16, 1889, inclusive, searched fol' n·ported rock::; off Cape Lookout,, Oregon, without success. This examination having been Yery tl10rouµ;h, carried on both by sounding and sweeping, Lieutenant Delehanty came to the conclusion that the reported dangers do uot exist in the locality designated.
SPECIAL WORK.

The Honorable Secretary of the Navy having requested the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic ~urvey to la.r off a measured mile course in Narragansett Bay, also a 40-mile course to the sontJnvarcl of Long Island in not less than 20 fathoms of water, and a similar course on the Pacific eoast for the spee1l trials of United States vessels of war, this important work was successfully accomplished as follows, viz:

Steamer Blake, Lieut. J. E. Pillsbury, U. S. N. comma11ding.-Juiy 2-24, 1889, a course of one nautical mile was laid off in Narragansett Bay, between Conanicnt Island and Rose Island, with range signals, the northern range being on the former island, the southern range on the latter, and the course range on the land m the vicinity of Fort Adams. Valuable current observations w~re also made by Lieutenant Pillsbury. Chart No. 353', showing this course, has been published by the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for the benefit of naval Yessels. · Steamer Blake, Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, U. 8. N. conwianding.-May 17 to June 10, 1890, a course of 40 nautical miles was laid off in not less than 20 fathoms of water to the southward of Long Island, N. Y., and Block Island, R. I., with large range signals, the westeru range lleing on Long Island in the vicinity of Shinnecock Light-House aml the eastern range ou Block Island. For the 40-mile course on the Pacific Coast the vicinity of Santa, Barbara, Cal., has been determined upou, and Lieut. D. Delehanty, U. S. N., commanding stea,rner Hatisler, has been selected by you to perform this responsil>le duty. He will commence operations iu about two weeks, when bis preparations are eompletecl at San Francisco, Cal. It gives me 11foasnre to state that the ~avy Department, has officially expressed its satisfac. tion with the two courses measured on the Atlantic Coast., both having been satisfactorily tested, and when tbe one on the Pacific Coast is completed I am confident it will gi\'C equal satisfaction. The Hon. John B. Gordon, Governor of Georgia, having requested that an examination be made of the oyster beds of that State, this important work wa.s delegated to Ensign J.C. Drake, U. S. N., commanding tbe scl.10oner Ready. From October 1, 1889, to Fcbruar_y 28, 1800, Ensign Drake was engaged upon this examination, and his exhaustive report is now being prepared for imblicatiou in the form of a special bulletin. This officer's long experience in the examination of the oyster beds of North Carolina rendered him peculiarly well fitted for the super>ision of the duty assigned him.
THE CO.A.ST PILOT DIVISION.

August 5, 1889, Ensign E. Il. Tillman, U. S. N., Chief of the Coast Pilot Di>ision, was detached from duty in the office and ordered to assume comma.nd of the steamer Endeavor for the purpose of veri(ying the sailing directions of Chesapeake Ba.y and tributaries, Part VI. of the Atlantic Coast Pilot. He completed this work Sept,ernl>er 21, 1839, allll re:>ttmr.tl his dnties in the office. October 31, following, Etlsign Tillman, who had been temporarily in charge of the Coast Pilot Division since the detachment of Lieut. George H. Peters, U. S. N., November 25, 188S, was relieved by Lieut. Commander S. M. Ackley, C". S. N., who was specially selected for this responsible position on account of his high standing as a seaman and navigator aud his previous expe· rience of more than three years' service under the Coast and Geodetic Stu,·eJ·. Lientenant·Comma.nder Ackley has been most efficiently assistetl in the labor of compiling the Coast Pilot by Ensign E. A. Anderson, U.S. N., and l\Ir. John Ross, ou permaueut duty under this Division. J nne 14, 1890, Lieutenant-Commander Ackley was ordered to assmne commaml of the steamer .Endeavoi· at the U.S. Navy Yard, \Vashington, D. O., then to proceed to New Betlford, l\lass., for the purpose of making some slight repairs to the boiler and engine of tbe vessel previous to commencing the verification of the Coast Pilot MSS. of the coast of l\Iaiue. fo a few days he will leave New Bedford to prosecute the active field work. The detailed report of the Chief of the Coast Pilot Division will be found annexetl to this report. The Coast Pilot volume of the Atlantic Coast will be subdivided into seven parts, and the follow· ing sbows the limits embraced in each, with the condition of progress at the end of the fiscal year just closed, viz: Parts I and IL-One volume-Eastport, Me., to Cape Ann, Mass. The MSS. is completed and is now being verified in the field by Heut. Commander S. M. Ackley, U.S. N., commanding steamer Endeavor. It will be ready for the printer about the last

I am happy to announce that it is now completed and the MSS. will be received at this office in a few weeks' time. That part of the coast coYerell by the compilation of .Lieutenant Oornmander Nichols is commonly known :u.; Southeast Alaska, and extends from Dixon Entr.iuce, marking the 1ionm1ary line between British Columbia a1H1 Alaska, northward to Yakut:at Bar, embracing all of the interior waters and outside coast line of this remarkable country, far famed for its graml scenery and rug-ged beauty. The rapidly increasing commercial importance of Alaska renders it imperatiYe that tl1is volume of tlw Alaska Coast Pilot sboultl be published at the earliest possible moment for the benefit of naYig-ation. Lieutenant Commander Nichols having had fiYe years' personal experience in Alaskan waters, commanding the U. S. Uoast and Geodetic Survey steamer Hassler and the U. S. S. Pinta,, he was pecnliarl~' adaptetl and C(JUipped for the work assigned ltim. The work eo,·eriug that portion of Alaska to the northward and westward of Yakutat Bay, including the Aleutian Islands, will be compile<l as rapidly as reliable data is obtained, and will be known as Part II. The ,·olume coyeriug .southeast Al,!lska will be Part I.
THE IIYDROGRA.PIIIC DIVISION.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Lieut. M. L. Wood, U. S. N., was in charge of this Division, uncl it gives me pleasure to call your attention to the untiring industry exhibited by this zcalott-< officer, and to sta,te th~tt he was the originator of many improvements in the details of chart c,11·rcdions and iu preparing for publication the monthly Notices to Mariners.

From the above summary it will be seen that all the vessels of the Survey on acti,·c sen·ico have been under repairs during the fiscal year, aml many of the alterations and improYements aud the renewal of worn-out material 4ave been quite extensive. The large amount of work

156

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

accomplished with a limited approprilltion has been rendered possible by utilizing the enlisted force of the ships' mechanics as far as possible, th us economizing greatly on the cost of labor. New boilers are reqt1ired for the En<leawr and Daisy to replace those now in use and which are worn out from the wear and tear of long service. It is hoped that new boilers may be constructed for thei:,e vessels during tile fiscal year 18fl0-'91.
NEW VESSELS AND STEA.1\1 LAUNCHES NEEDED.

I respectfully call you1· attention to tile necessity of a special appropriation for the construe· tion of a vessel of 1,500 tons ilisplacerncnt, costing about $JOD,O()O, for use in northwes-t Alaska. A vessel for this purpose shonld be composite built, of' the strongest construction. sheatLed bow as a protection against ice, great coal endurance, tl'iple expansion engines, and a maximum speed of 12 knots. With a steamer properly designed for this service an excellent reconnoissance of' northwest Alaska could be made in a, periml of three or four years, locatiag the principal shoals and dangers and establislting a"trouomieal station,,; at tlrn most important points, thus adding greatly to our very meagre knowletlge of that immense portion of our country, which is ra1>i<lly growing in importance, on account of the whaling and sealing industry and mineral discoveries, in an increasing ratio from year to year. Suell a steamer wouhl be availal>le for running lines of deep-sea soundings preparatory to laying submarine cables in the Pacific. If the Coast Survey should be called upon for the work here suggested, then· is not a single vessel at its command fitted for such service, of which tlie grcateHt requirement would be coal en<lllrance. A small steamer of 2.30 trms, costing a boat $ 75,000, is necessary for work on the Atlantic coast. A vessel of this size would be economicali and is neerled to fill tlie place of the Gedney, which was transferred to the Pacific coast in 1888. As the Blake is continuously engaged upon the in \'Cstigation of the Gulf Stream, the only two steamers available for hyclrographic work on the Atlantic and Gulf co:asts 11re tile Bar:hc and Endeavor. A third steamer is undoubtedly required. A large t>team launch of 25 tons, costing about $12,000, is needed for work in Puget and Washington Sounds, iu conjunction with tile scl10011or Earnest. 'rile launch Tarry Not, which has been in use with the B1ime~t for many years p<1>st,, is completely worn out, is not worth repairiug, and is know·11 to be unseaworthy. During the present season, in the northern waters of' \Yasllington, the Iairnch Pttea, has been s11lBtituteLl for the Tarry Not, but is unsuitable for the work, and will probably be required ia a Hltort time by the topographical party working in Washington.

U.S.

00A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY STEA.11:ER ENDEAVOR,

New Bedford, 11-lass., July 1, 1890. SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report covering the work of the Coast Pilot Division during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890. At the beginning of the year the first edition of subdivision 22 of the Atlantic Coast Pilot was in the hands of the printer; it was ready for issue December rn, 1889. The manuscript for U. S. Coast Pilot, Atlantic Coast, Part VI, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries, was sent to the printer September 30, 1889, and the proofs are now being recei,·ed at long inten·als. 'fhe manuscript for a ·new Coast Pilot volume coYering the coasts of Maine, New Hampshire, anu Massachusetts, from the eastern boundary to Cape Ann, is practically complete(l; the sailing directions are to be testell and descriptive matter verified as soon as practicable, aft<>.r which it will he ready for the printer. This volume will include Parts I arnl II, of tlle U. S. Coa"lt Pilot, Atlantic Ooa<>t; Part I co>·ering the coast from the eastern boundary to Whitehead, and Part II from Whitehead to Cape Ann. It is to be issued separately to meet the demand for a Uoast Pilot publication COYering the section of the coast included therein, and forms part of the large Yolnrne now in preparation, which is <lesigued to embrace .the Atlantic coast of the l~nitt'd States. l\fucb work has been done in the preparation of the volnrne to cover the Atlantic crn1;;t. The <lata for the coast from the eastern boundary to New York h:i.ve been collected trnd tile field work completed, excepting the verification of sailing lines on the coast of Maim-, aml a few special examinations necessitated by the changes which are constantly occurring along the coast. Very little bas been done between New York and Chesapeake Bay; some data have been collected, but the field work is stiU to be done. Some of tlie data. for t1rn coaRt between ClwRapeake Bay and Key 'Vest have been collected and put in form, but tlte tle!(1 work is yet to be taken up. Over 2,000 miles were run to Yerif.v sailing lines in Chesapeake Bay and descriptions which are incorporated in the Coa.st Pilot volume in the hands of the printer. See the report of Ensign E. H. Tillman, U. S. N., Assistant Coast and Geo(letic Survey, dated September 21, 1889. I will here call your attention to the very slow progress of the Government Printing Office in getting out Part VI, .Atlantic Coast Pilot, Chesapeake Bay and tributaries. The first pages of }lroofs were receh·ed on November 11, 1889; since that date only about one-llalf of the proof has been received, and at tlie present rate of progress this work will be more tlrnn a year in tllP printer's bands, which for a small volume of about one hundred and eighty pages seems ridiculous. Under ;your instructions dated June 14, 1890, the Coast Pilot party was tmnsf'l'rrell from tlle Office to the steamer Endeat·or for work in the field. On our way thither a shoal near Wolf '.l'rnp Spit, in Chesapeake Bay, was de'l'"eloped; the data for this work com;ist of 9~ miles of sounding lines, 528 soundings, 49 angles, 1 signal built and located. The party then proceeded to New York and to New Betlforcl, .Mass., stopping at )fl'W Haven, Oonu., to inquire about the casualty to the schooner Robert ,1/:irgnn. .\. t the end of tlic fiscal year the Endeavor is undergoing repairs at New Bedford, M:ass., preparatory to cm1ti.nuiug tl!e season's work as directed in your instructions. Previous to October 1, 1889, the date of his detachment from the Surrn.r, Ensign E. H. l'illman, U. S. N., had cbftrge of the Coast Pilot work; since that date the Di vision has been under my cl.Jarge. . Ensign E. A. Anderson, U. S ..N, reported for duty in the Division on .Tnl,v, 188!!, aml has been engaged in general Coast Pilot work, excepting from January 13 to 23, both incltisirn, and .A.JlFil 14 to 23, both inclush'e, when he was detailed for hydrographic work in New Fork Harbor unucr your instructions. Since JuniJ 14 he has been engaged in the field work of the party ou board the steamer Endeavor. He is a most intelligent and conscientious officer in the performance of his duty, and his ser\·ices are of the greatest value to the Coast Survey. )fr. John Ross has been employed in the Division, at the Office and in the field, during the entire fiscal year; be has been engaged in revising aml compiling data for Coast Pilot volumes and in the routine office work of the DiVision. Ilis experience in this class of work, combmed

with a general knowledge of the Atlantic coast of the United States, and his intelligent and willing attention to duty, make his services valuable. J\liss Alice F. Carlisle has been employed during the entire fiscal year as a copyist for the Division at the Office. I can not speak too highly of her industry and the satisfactory manner of doing her work. I woulll most urgently call your attention to the necessity of some more systematic and thorough arrangement with the J;ig·ht-Honse Department b.v which this Oflice can be informed of changes in the aids to navigation. They are constantly being matle, and sometimes for months afterwards we lw:ni no knowledge of them a.nd consequently our 11ublications and charts on which they should appear are for the time incorrect.

U. 8. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY OFFICE. lVasMngton, July l, 1890.

S!R: I have the honor to submit herewith the report of the work done in the Ilydrographic Division during the year ending ,fone 30, 1890. The Division was in charge of Lieut. :;'ti. L. Wood, U.S. N., until Jaunary 14, 1890, on which. rlate he was relieved by myself. The force of draughtRmen in the Division bas been the same throughout the year as at the date of the last a11uual report, \"iz, i\fr. E. Willen't:mchrr, Mr. W. C. Willenhncher, Mr. F. C. Donn, and E. H. Wyvill, the three first named being engaged on the work l1ereinafter stated, and Mr. W~·vill performing the varied duties pertaining to the office of the Chief of Division. It gives me great pleasure to testify to the zeal, industry, and ability of these draughtsmen, to whom is due, in a great measure, whatever of credit belongs to this Division. A tabular statement of the work performe:l during the yea1· in plotting, verifying, and inking original hydrographic sheets, in the verification, revision, and correction of reducecl drawings of hydrography,"' and in miscellaneous dmughting, has been prepared for file with the Office reports in the archive8. A o;nmmary of the work upon the original hydrograpllic sheets is present,ed in the following
table:

REPORT OF THE DISBURSING AGENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED .JUNE :30, 1890.

u. s. 00A.S1'

A.ND GMODI~l'IC SrRVEY, D1smJRSINlr OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 31, 1890. Sm.: I have the honor to snbrnit herewith the report of the Disbursing 0ffice for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1890. On December 3, 1889, I relieved Mr. George A. Bartlett, Disbursing Clerk of the Treasur,y Depnrtment, of the dnties devolving upon him in making disbursements for the Coast and Geodetic Surrny, having previonsly qualified as Disbursing Agent for the Survey nuder authority of Departmeut letter dated November 7, 1839. Immediately upon taking charge of the Disbursing Office I found it was uecessary that Mr.Bartlett's accounts should be closed out and t!te available balances in his hamh deposited in the Treasury so as to be subject to my own requisitions. This work was at once entered on, and by the close of the fiscal year Mr. Bartlett's accounts had all been rendered to the Department arnl the necessary tra 11sfers of funds accomplished. These accounts are yet in process of adjustment by the Acconnting 011kers, and in the usual routine of settlement will require more or less explanation in relation to dift't\rt'nces befOi'c they are finally closed on the books of the Treasury Department. The books of tllis Office, howeYer, as far as Mr. Bartlett'.s accounts are concerned, were closetl on June 30, 1890. The attention giv-en to the adj nstment and closin~ of Mr. Bartlett's accounts naturally delayed the progress of my own worlr. Practically, I was compelled during the period from December 1, 1889, to .Tnne 30, 1890, to run two sets of disbursing accounts, and for tl10 time being the work of the Office ma.y be considered to have been doub1cd. This comlition was somewhat emlmrrassing, and that it should ha\·e finally resulted in a large accumulation of arrearages in my own accou uts was but a natllral seque1rne. Moreover, the force in my office was, and had been for some time prior, entirely too small to cope with the amount of work required to be clone, and hence it was that at the close of the fiscal year the uuacJjustcd accounts were several months in arrears. I refer to this merel~· to show the causes which were operating to retard the work and as a response t,o various complaints which have been made from time to time as to tardiness in the adjustment and settlement of accounts. In the near future, with an increased force, and a more equitable distribution of the work of the Office, I hope to be able to make a more prompt settlement of acconn ts than has been possible heretofore. The annual report of expenditures of the Survey, required by the act approved March 3, 1853, for the fiscal year ending June ao, 1890, was transmittell to Congress, through the Trtc~asury Department, on December 18, 1889. The preparation of these reports in their present detailed form is a work of some magnitude, but their advantages as a means of reference, a1mrt from their usefulness as a complete financial record of the Siuvey for each fiscal year, will no doubt more than compensate for the labor expended in compiling them. It will he necessary for some little time to elapse before the changed condition of affairs in the Disbursing Office, produced by the Surve.v having its own Disbursing Officer, cau be lrnrmonized and a new system adopted to meet the exigencies of the case. Ex1·erience is necessary to enable such changes to be made in the methods of work, records, accounting, etc., as may he of adntntags, both to th-e offioer'in the field and this Office, witho11t detra.oting from or materially changing the methods and cn.stom.s with which both have become familiar. The ultimate result of such changes and reforms will, in my opinion, result in a sa.ving of both time and money. The accounts of the Survey rendered to the Depa-rtment during the past fiscal year havo

almost uniformly received the sanction aud approval of the Accounting Officers of the Treasury. Objectfons ha,-e been made to but few items, and in nearly every instance the explanations submitted by tLis Office have proYed satisfactory. The statistics of work accomplished dnring the year, as nearly as they can be stated, are given bclo1v. It L:-1 apparent that many of the duties performed by this Office can not be accounted for in any manner which would be intellig-il>le. Hencl', the figures \Vhich follow, wltile giving t5ome idea of the volume of work, afford hut little eoneevtio11 of the time and lalmr expended in dis posiug of it:

APPENDIX

No. 7-1890.

REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE OFFICE m' WEIGHTS ANn MEASURES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1890.
UNI'fED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SrRVEY, OFFICE OF WEIGil'l'S .A.ND MEASURES,

Washington, D. C., Se11trJmbcr 2, 1800. Sm: Herewith I beg leave to submit a report on the operations of the Weights and .Measures Office, in my charge, nnder ~-our direction, during the fiscal year ending June 30, ISHO. The work of the office has been carried on with the usual force, although the demanus upon it have greatly increased. This was largely owing to the necessity of preparing standards for the 1iewly admitted States, but also to the increased demand from all part of the country for the comparison of weights and measures with the National Standards. I.iegislation relating to the sealing of weights and measures has been left to the se,·eral States, but it is evident that fbr interstate as \\"ell as for international commerce, and for otlier purposes, au ul'licial Yerification by this office of the measures involved is a necessary YOlICbC'r for their correctness. These facts aml considerations and the al;sence of legislation regarding the material representatives of uatioual standards of weights and measures call for a comprehensive legislative enactment in regard to them. The re· ceipt by this Go\'ermneut of the Prototype Metric Standards constrnctell by Yirtue of an international agreement, and 1iow iu the custody of this office, affords a fitting occasion to recommeud strch legislation afl will insure their safo keeping and define tlmir standing as ultimate standards of length and mass. One set of these standards, namely, National Prototype Metre No. 2i and :S-ational Prototype Kilogramme No. 20, was brought from the International Bureau of Weight." and l\leasures near Paris by Assistant George Davicfaon, aud was deposited iu this office on November 15, 1889. They remained under seal in tb.e sta,ndards room iu the Butler Building, whence tliey were taken to tlle Executive Mansion on .January 2, 1890, and opened by the President of tile United States in the presence of the Secretaries of State ancl of the Treasury, aml others who ha(l been invited to be present at the ceremony. A certificate recording the circumstances under which the standards were recei\·ed aml opened was signed by the President and by the Secretaries of State and of the Treasury, and a separate attestation by the other gentlemen present. When the Internationa.] Committee undertook the construction of the standards, 1lti~ Goyern· ment, in view of the risks of trausportation auu for other reasons, ordered for its O\Yll u':'e two sets of these standards and an additional metre bar of similar cross-section and material, bnl made of the alloy of ls7 4. It was intended that after these should have been safely transported to this countr,\· one set should remain here permanently, while the other could be taken back to the International Bureau, whenever it might be doomed desirable, for comparison with the International i~rntot.vpes. The first set and the metre of the alloy of 1874 (l'rletre No. 12) having l:eeu safoly brougltt to this country by Assistant Davidson, I was directed to bring the second srJ from Paris. In accordance with instructions from the Honorable Secretary of State aml yourself, I sailed for IDnrope on April 23, and after visiting the weights and meai:mres offices of London, Paris, aud Berlin,
19ii

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

I received the standards in question (National Prototype J\Ietre No. 21 and National Prntotype Kilogramme .Xo. 4) from the International Bureau, and brought them to this country, depositing them in the standards room on July 14. A. more tletailed statement in reganl to these standards and the certificates accompanying them will be published in Appendix No. 18, to this volume. A collection of the lati:'st State hms relating to weights arnl measures was made during the year, and a circular was issued through tlie Department of State to the United States Consuls asking for information on the weights and measures of the difti.·rent countries to which they are accredited. Replic.s from about forty-fh·e cum1tries l.Jave l1een received. The necessity of furni;;hiug reliable information to the public on the relation of metric to Cl1'3· tomary weights and measures of the United States led to the preparation of a convenient table for the intercciuvcrsion of the units of these two systems. The publication of thfa has been followed by it great demand, awl tlic <listrilmtion of several tl10usand copies to meet it. l3lllletiu No. U, ou the ,·erification of weights and measures, was prepared and issued. Bulletin No. JS, for tht~ reduction of salinometer observations, was prepared for the use of the Coa!'.t aud Geodetic SmTey a1Hl the F. S. Fish Commission. During- my ab;;e1we in Europe on business relating to weights and measures, the office was in charge of As;,;istant Ceorge .A. F<lirliehl frolll April 22 to l.\fay 14, and under the charge of As;;istant F. B. Par,;ons from the fatte1· date to the end of the fiscal ~·ear. On December 31, 188!>, Dr ..J. J. Clark, for many years adjuster of weights and me:isures, a. position the d ritie;; of which lw <lischargetl honorably and with ability, resigned; and this vacancy was filled by tlrn appoi11tme11t ot' :\Ir. L. A. Fischer, who was transferred from the lnstrumeut Di>isiou to thi:,; oue on OctnllC'r fl, 1880, and who was appointed to tbe position of adjuskr Oil February rn, 18110, l\lr. Fischer bas shown much avtitude for the work deYolved ou him, and has performed h::s antics with earnest zeal. Ifo constructed an experimental hydraulic Jift for the comparator, aud made drawings for certain parts of the latter, while his Jll'incipal work has been to make adjustmeut weighings aml length com11arisous. Ml'. Par:<ous attenrled to the clerical work of the office, made aml assisted in thci'Illometer and scale comparisons, au1l 1lctcrmined the irregularities of the screws of the micrometers of microscopes 3 and 4 oft he com para tor.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
INTRODUCTION.

Jn conformity with the general plan pursued for the prosecution of the work of the Coast and Geodetic Surv-ey in terrestrial magnetism, and in cooperation with the work proposed by the International Polar Commission, and supportell on the part of the United States by the participation of the U. S. Signal Service, the Superiutemlent of the Survey, Mr. J. E. Hilgard, uecided to reestablish at th~ most suitable place a magnetic observatory for continuous registra.tion of the changes of the magnetic forcr. Before this similar records hail b2en matle at Key "\Vest, Florida, between the years 1860 and 18G6, and at llla<lisoll, Wisconsin, between the years 1876 and 1881, and it became, therefore, deflirable to select the new station a.;; far remote from t liese places as practicable and iu a region where the Jaws of magnetism were as yet bt1t little understood or only imperfectly developed. A.t the same time, the part which the United States took in connection with the International Polar Ueserircbes, by fitting out two expeditions, one un1lcr Lieut. P.H. Ray, U.S. A., to Point Barrow, the other UIHler Iiieut. A. 'V. Greely, U.S. A., to I,;idy Prnnklin Bay,"' demanded assistance nearer borne in the form of continuous registry of the changes of the magnetic force in order to furnish the means for tile comparison of the magnetic results at all stations taking vart in the undertaking of the International Commission.
LOC.A'l'10N A.ND POSITION OF OTISERYATORY.

C nder instructions issuetl to him :\fay 2u, 1882, As:sistant .James s. Lawson was directed to examine certain localities iu .southeru California, aud Ile finally .selectetl as the most favorable site for the observatory the grounds of the Branch Normal School in Los Angeles as meeting fully the essential reqniremcnts respecting permanency of occupation for several ;years, freedom from local disturhancc::i, supply of pure water, economy of construction of lmilding, anu co1Jvenience of living for the obsen·cr. Mr. Lawson constructed the observatory according to plans furnisberl by the Office with such uecdfnl modifications as suggested themseh·es to him. The maintenance of as uniform a temperature as conld be secured bdng a desideratum for the proper performance of self-registering magnetometers, tile lmilding was a double one, tile inner and the outer walls being separated by an air space of ab0t1t 2:! feet, wliich exteuded also o,·er tile double roof. The walls are formed of planking arnl tile space 1Jetween them is fllle(l with dry earth well tamped in; the inuer and outer walls of tLtc stmcture are of rough uoards ancl battened, the ceiling of the inner shell is composed of tongued-:rnd-grooverl boards, a11d on the top of the joists is a rough board floor eoyerpd ''itlt a layer of earth. The roof is shingle-covered. The outer door is on the south face aud, <tftcr entering, a narrow passage on the west side leads to the dark room attached to the north sitle, whence the instrument room proper is reached. Ventilation is provided for by pipes rum1ing- t.hro11gh tlw roof. Tim 1linwnsions of the building- are as follows: Length, 28 feet; wid t11, 2 L foet; dark rno111, rn h.r 12 foet: hcigli t, abont S feet trJ the eaves. The instrument room measures 1fl by 1 ::! fed. height about 8 feet, jnst i;ufficicnt to aceommodate the Adie ruagnetograph. The thre1: instrument piers, the cloek and lamp piers, were of brick and rested on the same fonn11atioH, aHd the central clock pier was eonnectcd with tile tops of the magnet piers by the stone slabs originally fllrnisherl with the instmments. The wooden floor of the room was <lisconnectell from the pier:,;. The ollscrYator,v was placed on the slopieg ground about 200 feet (61 metres) from 'the nearest wall of tlw school lmilding and almost directly west of it; at the foot of the slope and about 210 feet, or G± metres, to the soutliward and westward (S. 37° vV. true) a small wooden structure was put up for the accommodation of a magnetometer and dip circle used for the monthly absolute

The elevation of the observatory is nearly 312 feet (9.5 metres) above the sea level, and its geograpllical position as determinell by triangulation· is as follows: Observatory north of flag-pole of normal school 135 feet. (41 .1 metres), an<l west of the same 275 feet (83.9 metres); it is also 47.0-11.1, or 5.9 rnetTes south of the astronomical telegTaphic longitude station established here temporarily in tlle western grounds in l'l!arch, 1889, nnd 83.9-5(;.8, or 27.1 metres, west of the same. !'regent gemletic la.titu<le of normal sclwol flag-11ole, 34° 02' 55 11 .9, with vrouable correction of+ 0".8 Difterence of latitude, 1 11 .3 Latitude of magnetic observatory (center), 34° 02' fl7 11 .2, and eorreeted ;)40 02' 58".0 Preseut astrouomical longitude of 1889 station, 1180 15' 22".6 Difference of longitu<le 1".0 Longitude of magnetic observatory, use 15' 23 11 .G, or 711 53m Ol ·.57 west from Greenwich; also 8h 32m 47'.81 west from Got.tingen.t Tbe ele>ation of tlle brick pier for absolute measures is 279 feet, or 8[i metres, abo>e the iwerage sea level. The magnetic ·inst>·ttments.-As early as 18Gl the Survey lmu procured from Kew one of the newly dev-ised Adie magneto graphs, but owing to the then disturl.Je<l state of tlie country, and later on from lack of funds, the instrument rewained in the storeroom until it was decided in the spring of 1882 to bring it into permanent use. In or1ler to test its colllt>letcuess and the proper conditions of the magnets the ins:rument was set up at the Office in Washington in October, 1878, with tlle aid of :Ylr. 'Verner Suess~ mechanician to the Office; the scale values were then roughly determined by the writer and the magnets were fonud to be in a satisfactory condition. Organfaatimi of tlte observatory.-Under instrnctions to Mr. Suess, <lated July 'i, 1882, the instrument wa.R mounted by him at the Los Angeles observatory and roughly adjustell, and the photographic process was brought into a good workiug conditi011. On tlie arrirnl of l\lr. :Marcus Baker, acting assistant, who was placed in charge of the obse1Tatory by instructions from the Superintendent, dated July 19, 1882, the final adjustments were made and t11e scale Yalues of the three magnetometers were det~rrnine<l. The n gular work of the obsen·atory commenced with October 1, 1882, and was continued without any serious interruption to Odober 1, 1889, thus covering a period of nearly two-thirds of a sun-spot cycle a11cl includiug the time of tl1e minimum sun-spot acth'it,y, supposed ha Ye occurred early in the year 11:189. l\Ir. Baker remaiued in charge of the observatory until A.ugust 1, 188!, when Mr. Carlisle Terr.y, jr., aid in the Survey, assumed charge un<ler instructions dated June Hi, 1884. In consequence of failing liealtht l\fr. Terry was relieved from this duty (at his own request) aml Assistant H. B. llalter, who had been aiding llim since November, 1'886, was appointed to tlie ollser'"atory ,fouuar,y 17, 1887, and on February 1 took charge of the same . .l\1r. Halter conducted the work to its close in October, 1889, when it became necessary to discontinue the service in conse<juence of the encroachments caused by tb.e necessity of enlarging the bnildiug accommodations of the public school. Besides the chiefs in charg·e there was but one employc who assisted in the manual labor. The duty of duplicating the reconls§ and making a first computation of the observations, inclusiYe of the reatling off of hourly coordinates of the traces, dernl \'ed upon the chief of the obscrrntory. The. absolute magnetic 111easures.-They are supplementary to the differential measures and were made monthly on three days about the rni<ldle of each month, in order to furuisli the meaus of expressiug the results of tlle difierential measures in terms of absolute units. The portable instruments provided for these observations were magnetometer No. 8 antl Kpw ffip circle No. 21. The magnetometer is of a pattern shown on plate No. 35, Coast and Geodetic Survey report for 1881; it is an old instrument origi11a1Jy made hy .Jones, of London, but aetually

T::ie shorter maglle (Se). suspeu<led during deflections, is about 3 inches (7.6 centimetres) long-; both are co1lirnator'1. 'fhe determination of the astronomical azimuth is more conveniently done with a separate instrnt1wnt for which purpose a small theodolite was provided.

DETERMINATION OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION.

Observations for local time.-The observations for time were generally made once a month and at other times when specially needed. The method was that of equal altitudes of the sun, observed with sextant No. 145 and mercurial horizon; meau time chronometer I'arki11so11 and Frodsham No. 2701 was used throughout the series. It was deemed unnecessary to give here a table of daily chronometer corrections and rates, since in all cases where time is reeorded or referred to in this report it is specially stated whether it is chronometer time (in wbieh case the correction is given) or the corrected mean local time.

STATES COAST A"ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Determination of the azimuth of the declination mark.-This mark was established by Mr. Baker; it consists of a black cross painted on a chimney (abo11t 130 metres distant) with a copper 11ail at the intersection of the cross; its direction from the pier for absolute measures is about 40° west of true south, and about 5 metres higher than the instrument pier. On Jul~· 13, 1887, Mr. Halter establislled a new mark on another chimney of the same house in consequence of an obstruction in the line of sight occasioned by the erection of a building; the azimuth of th is mark was about 430 west of south.* On January 9, 1888, in order to avoid overflow in heavy raius, Mr. Halter raised tlle obsen·ing but an<l the brick pier 3 feet; the foundation of the pier, w!iiclt had been threatening to give way, was better secnmd and the cap stone re-plu mllctl. On July 10, 1889, Mr. Halter virtually re-established the first or old mark by marking a new one 45.7 centimetres (18 inches) aborn it and verifying their line of verticality by means of a plummet. Numerous obsernitions were made by Mr. Bak.er to determine the azimuth of his mark by means of the sun and of Polaris. About one-half of these observations were made with the telescope and horizontal circle of the declinometer ~o. 8, an instrument very ill adapted aud not intendell for snch work;t the other half were made with a IO-centimetre (4 inch) Casella theodolito No. 3416. The observations on the sun are less satisfactory than those on Polari;;, besides they iirrnlni a more exact knowledge of time; I gave these results therefore but lialf the weight assigne(l to those from Polaris. The following table contains the results from 26 sets of observations hy Mr. Baker:

A scrutiny of the tabular values would seem to reveal the cai1se of the sud.den diminution in t1rn observed valnes of the declination in Decem\mr, 1887, aml January, 18:38, this defect in the st·ries being most likely r.-ferable to imperfect elimination of the torsion in tlrn susiwnsion. If this view be correct, the values of the deeliuatiou duriug 1887 seem all too great, as is also rnanifPst by an examination of tlle annual rne;rns. The 1lit'fere11ce between any two consel\uth·e y(>ars should ~1wlually change from 0'.5 at the mi1ldle of the series to l'.!) at tl.Je end of it, eouformaLly to the <lift'erential measures. The latter show only a <liffereuce of 0 1.G Letweea the December, 1887, and the January, 1881:), readings. The annual variation as well as the annual change due to secular variation must be derived from the differential series. The probable error of a sing"le determination of the declination can be deriYed from the tlifferences of each of the three daily v:1lues from the mean of the values; the labor of squaring these differences may be saved by using the formula

- ---------~~-[v l'=0.84t>
./n (n-v)

where [i· stands for the sum of all rlifferenees, a.bstraeting from their sign, n i8 the total number of observations and v the number of means or monthly values. \Ve have

It is evident that between April and September, 18SG, there mnst have been some disturbance which produced au increase of 4'.5 of the <lip over its otherwise normal amount; the nature of this disturbance can oul.r be surmised since the observer makes no other allusion to it than in notes of Augnst 11 and 14, wl1en he refers to the presence of an irou water pipe Hi or HJ metres east nnd north of the station.t In order to get an improved annual mean I substitute for each of the 5 -------------------.-------------------*Wright's notation.

of his "Treatise on the Adjustment of Observations," New \'ork, 181:\4.

t I learn from Assistant R. A. Marr that the snrronndings of the station for absolLlte measures were unfavQrable, due to the vicinity of premises in which wagons were kept, but the cause of the discrepant results appears to me
to be iustrnmental, probably defective adjnstment, since neither tlie declination nar the horizontal intensity mra81<rc8,

monthly dips the respective mean of the dips of the preceding aml following years, viz, 29.9, 30.0, 29.8, ~9.6, and 30.3, corrected by +0'.2, which is the average difference for the other months of tbe year (1885-1886) between the observed value and the mean deduced from the preceding and following year; these figures were also used when taking the monthly means in the last column. These last figures show the insufficiency of the absolute measures to bring out the a.n1mal incq1iality, for which we have to refer to the combined differential measures. "\Vith respect to the annual clwnge it must be noted as an accidental circumstance that the secular variations both for the declination and the dip were in one of tlleir extreme phases during the occupation of the J,os Angeles observatory, and for the dip thi:-< was shown on the chart accompanying Appendix No. 6, Uoast aml Geodetic Survey Report for l885. On this chart the belt of Rtationary di1i or of 110 annual change passes through J,os Angeles iu 1885. Our annual means are insnfficient to fix the precise year and they barely indicate that a decrease has set in; this would make it probable that the belt is now moving to the westward. 'J'he mean dip for the middle period or for April 1, 188H, is 59° 30 1.0±0'.2 The annual inequality of the dip will be derive<l from the differential measures.

Tlte probable error of an obseniation for hm·izontal inten.sity.-This is most readily arrived at by comparing each of the three daily values with their montlily mean and summing the differences. We then have

which is about 1 7\ 10 of the force. The preceding probable error is relative only as shown by its derivation, as no account has been taken of the uncertainty in the measures of tlrn weight of the mass-ring and of the diameters of the same. Making a liberal estimate of the former as ± 0.1 grai11, and of the latter ms ± 0.001 inch, the corresponding probable errors in II would ue ± 0.00002 anll ± 0.00004 dyue, or together ± 0.00005 dyne, which would seem to show that with portable instruments of this kind observations can be made the results of which can be tnrntell within 1 ;,1" 0- part of TI.

The mean of all the values answers to the middle epoch, April 1, 188G, for wltich we have H = 0.27273 dyne; this result is for 10 o'clock a. m., and consequently may be red need to the daily mean, or to tlrn mean of observations from 24 hours by means of the differential series of observations. The annual cliange, or the effect of the sec11lar ,·ariation in one year, is plainly indicated in the last row of the table. The horizontal force is diminishing slowly (as was indicated in 188::i ou the cbart showing the isodynamic curves for that epoch, Coast and Geodet.ic Survey Report 1885, Appendix No. 6). Let a =annual change (in absolute measure and C. G. S. units). H 0 =meau horizontal force at middle epoch t WI' have H 0 =.2727:~ for i 0 or for April 1, 1886. H =horizontal force for April 1 of any other year t; then H =Il 0 +a (t-t0 ) whence we get 7 observation-equations aud fiml a=-0.00009 dyne H=0.27273-0.0000() (t-t0 ) where i 0 =1886.25 Expressed in parts <>f the horizontal force we have a-1=-0.00033, a value considerably smaller than the values (a1) given for San Diego, Santa Bai;bara, Monterey, or San Francisco, in tlic report just referred to. For neither of these places, however, do the observations possess an accu· racy comparable with our present series. Further discussion of the horizontal force variations must be deferred till we treat of the differential observations, and we conclude this part of the discussion by tabulating the resulting values for V and F derived from the preceding tables of monthly results for H and 61 viz : V =ll tan 0 and F=H sec 8

In the preceding part of the account of the magnetic work done at the Los Angeles Observatory by the Coast and Geodetic Survey (Appendix No. 8, 1890), the plan aud object of these observations La.Ye been described ancl the instruments au(l methods for obtainiug the declination, the inclinatioa and the horizontal magnetic force in absolute measure have been explained. The results there obtained will be utilized in this, the second part, which is chiefly devoted to the presentation itud the discussion of the ditl'erential measures as secureu by continuous photographic registration. The d(tferential magnetic -instruments.-Ttrn Adie maguetograph oelonging to the Survey came into use for the first time at Los Angeles in 1882, as has been state11. No detailed description of these iur;truments is here demanded, as this cau be found in "Account of the construction of the self-recording maguetogmphs at preseut in operation at the Kew Observatory of the British Association, by l3alfour Stewart, M. A., taken from the report of the British Association for tlie .Advaucement of Science for 1859, Loudon, 1860, 4to, pp. !!00-228." \.V.e have there gi\'en a full description of each of the three maguctographs, their adjustment, as well as an exposition of the photographic process, accompanied by two plates showing construction (to scale) of i.nstruments and specimens of traces. Tue apparatus is also descrioed and well illustrated on Plates XVII (full view) and XVIII (detail of magnetometers aml recording cylinders) in Vol. I of" A Physical Treatise on Electricity and Ma.guetism, by J.E. H. Gordon, B. A., New York, 1880." The appa,. ratns was originally constructed for the use of gas, but at Los Angeles it was fottlbd more suitable to burn coal oil, for which purpose each lrtmp was provided with a. large copper tank containing fluid enough to last a day anu a half. The photographic process was that followed at the preceding station, Madison, Wis., but about July, 1~86, the gehttino.bromide paper was introduced with the most complete satisfaction. As mounted in the Observatory, the horizontal force and declination magnetometers stood on a magnetically west and east line, with the vertical force magnetometer centrally to the north of it and nearly iu the magnetic meridian. The air in the vacuum chambers was not exhausted, but the nmgnets were allowed to move under the variations of the ordinary atmospheric pre:ssnre.
DETERMINATION OF THE INSTRUMENTAL CONSTANTS OF THE MOUNTED AT LOS ANGELES, CAL. ADIE MAGNETOGRAPH, AS

The Uniftlat· Ma.gnetometer.-As far as known, the relation between the fixed semicircular mirror on the pier and the scale on the reading telescope was not disturbed from the time of the first adjustment after the instrument was set up to the close of the series; nor was there any change iu the suspension of the magnet and its attached semicircular mirror; hence the scale value remained the same. The magnet and appendages were suspended by a thread composed of twelve single silk fibers. The scale is mouuted 011 the reading telescope, with the zero division t-Owards

tbe south and the 500th or last division towards the north. The scale appears erect and the numbers increase from left to rigltt as ~men through the telescope. Increasing nnm bers indicate a movement of the north (srn~ki11g) end of the magnet towards the ea.~t or iucreasi11g east declination. The torsion head is graclnated from oo to 3600, from left to rigllt as seen from abo\·e the center, and iuto degree di visions, and can be read by means of a vernier to 5'. Let l =length of one division of scale~ = 0.0197 inch or 0.05 centimetres. r =distance from surface of mirror to face of scale plus two-thirds of thickness of glass mirror= 42.55inch (to rim of scale)+ 0.01:!5 inch (to its surface),+ ~ x 0.102 iuch = 108.4G5 centimetres, and when corrected for slant measure (see note to scale valne for the hifilar) it becomes 108.348

hence, a= 0'.7941 or 47".65 To determine the corresponding space on the recording cylinder or trace through which the luminous dot will move, we have given: Distance from snrface of paper to surface of mirror + i thickness of mirror = 57.57 inch + 0.068 inch = 146.40 centimetres, I.Jenee tile corresponding space 146 5 on the cylinder or on the paper 00. x .40 0.06756 centimetre, or 100 scale diYisions i or 108.348 791.41 correspond to 6.76 centimetres measured perpendicularly to the base of the unifilar trace. Also, 1 millimetre of the ordinate represents 1'.176 The time-scale or abscisAa aYerages 14. 75 inches or 37.465 centimetres for 24 hours, hence linear value representing one kour = 1.561 centimetre, and length representing one minute = .O:!G centimetre, or nearly oue-fourt.h of a millimetre; tbe length of the trace, however, Yaries slightly with irregularities in expansion and contraction of the paper ancl some lost motion in tile geariug with the clock.· Increa..~ing ordinates from the base denote increasing east d· clination. For reading off the unifilar traces, the observer had provided himself with a triaugular piece of cardboard with the straight edge of its right angle graduated, 100 parts corresponding to 6. 76 centimeters. To place its edge on the time scale, a. ruler bad been made with white pi11wr pastccl firmly to it; upon this the length of 37.465 centimetres had been subdivided into twenty-four equal parts and numbered from 9 hours a. m. (the time approximately of the beginning of the trace) to 9 a. m. of the next day; the hour spaces were subdivided into 5·rniuute spaces. After the magnetometers had been regularly at work for about a fortnight it became desirable to change the adjustment of the unifilar and of the vertical force instruments. The fixed mirror of the unifilar was originally set to read on the scale 250; on October I.':3, 1882, it was ch an getl to 300. This, together with a turning of the other half of the mirror, produced a change of 32.2 divisions,

as found by taking the mean reading (3384.2) frften days before and oomparing the same with the mean reading (370.4) of ten days after October 13. To render tbe tabulation uniform, this oon1itant was added to all readings before that date. The hourly readings of the traces and the corresponding tabulation of the difterential angular mo\·ements of the declination magnet expressed in scale divisionB are doe to th~ respecth·e observers. Occasional short breaks in the series, of one or more hours, had their nilues supplied by inter1mlation. This I effocted as follows: For the missing hourly ordinates were substituted the eorresponding rnontllly mean -values, but correewd for difierence of readings from the monthly mean at the last recorded hour and again at the first recorded hour after the break~ and this difference was distributed equally o-ver the intervening monthly means. All interpolated \·alues are <listiuguished by being incloscd in brackets. All recognized disturbances (above a certain limit) are indicated by an asterisk. These tables are appended. E_ffcct of the rcrtical force magnet upon the unifilar and bifilar niagnets.-In order to determine the effect produced by the vertical force magnet upon the two other magnets of the magnetograph, J\Ir. Baker made a, number of observations on September 25, 1882, alternately removing and replacing tbe balance magnet and noting the difference fa seale readings of the other two magnets. He founcl the effoct to be: Upon thi:i unifilar, to attract its north {seeking) end to the westward 1.8 !'lcale divisions, or 1 1.4; and upon the bifi.lar, to attract its west (north seeking) end to the north 2.3 scale divisions, 1'.9, or 0.00025 parts of the horizontal component of the magnetic force. Connection of the d~fferential with the absolute measures of tM declinatfon.-For this purpose the traces were reacl off for the times near the daily extremes when the absolute observations were recorded. For eaeh monthly.mean of a bsol n te measures on 3 days we have, therefore, corresponding to it, the mean of six trace or scale.readings. This connection is shown in the following table, the resulting absolute declinations being taken from Part I.

With the exceptian of the fi:rst year, the annual means consistently exhibit at first an annual :increase, next a sta.tiona.ry va.lne, and last a decrease of declination; our series th.us includes the epoeb. of maximum ea.st doolioation. When the observatory was established it was not known how aoon the secular variation would change its direction from in.creasing to diminishing ·atues. In my la.test discussiou. co of secular variation, I found the year 1880 to be the epoch of eastern maximum for Santa Barbara, Oa.l., a.ad 1883 the epoch for San Diego, Cal., both stations being near Los Angeles. By the year 1890 the region of stationary direction or of no annual change, acoompanyillg the maxi.mum east declination, had moved considerably out to sea, as shown on the ehart of anniml change illustrating the -di.scussioo. It is known that the seoola.r varia.tion is made up of a principa.I. and a number of minor :ft.uctu. a.tions, and it is these last which especi.aJJ.y obtrude themselves about those years immediately preceding and followi 0 g extreme values, and thus render it difficult to seize the exact year and

Our earliest information respectmg the direction of the magnetic 11eetlle on this coast dates from 1714, wlicn the declination was about 7,} 0 East, aw.I it has been steadily increasing since, though with various rates. Tke annual 'l:ariation of the declinatian.-The numerical exhibition of'tbis inequality, which apparently dt>peuds 011 the suu's decl1natio11, is difficult to give, on account of the length of the period and tile smalluessof the pheuomeuon; it demauds very firmly mounted and und1angeable

instruments, operated for a series of years. With the Adie magnetograph, tbe fixity of the zero direction is assured, but tbe possible develop1uent of torsiou in the sn;.;1.1ension skein must be guarded agc1iust, since such an effect would prooahly !Jave tl..ie same period as tl.ie maguetic inequality uuder co11sideration. The anuual variation is directly deduced from the preeeding table by takiug the difference of 'each moutl.aly mean (scale-reading) awl its corre::;pondiug annual mean aud correcting tQ.e same for effect of secular change.

A sign indicates easterly deflection of the north end of the magnet or increased east declination, a - sign signifies the reverse motion. The numbers of the last column exhihit a regular progression with a maximum easterly deflection in December, or about the winter solstice, and a maximum westerly deflection in June, or about the summer solstice-the total range of the variation being one mmute of arc. Of the above se,·en years uf observation, in one only (18d4-'dJ) is the above conclusion reversed and the last year's work seems feebly to support this. It can not be said that our knowledge of the annual variation is satisfactory iu view of the, as yet unexplained, fact of the greater or less discord or even contradiction of the results obtained at various places located even in the same magnetic hemisphere, as for instauce may l)e seen from the following table.

A graphical representation of tl.te tabula.r values is given on accompanying diagram (Illustration No. 21). It will be se.en at a glance that the character of the daily variation is in general the same throughout tbe year, viz, a single prominent wa>e with its two extreme Yalues at an interval of less than one-fourth of the wlwle period between them, followed by au indication of a very small secondary wave, which in some months can only be made out with difticnlty. To render the systematic monthly changes of the daily motion clearer suitable combinations were made by quarters and by half years, as is evidently allowable; thus the cunes for .Tuut·, July, antl Augnst are almost identical, also those of December, January. and February. Further, there is a most marked contrast between the curves for the summer half year (sun in north declination) aml the curves of the winter half (sun in south declination).

Referring to the hourly means for the whole year, it will be seen that the total diurnal variation of the declination at Los Angeles, Cal., is of tile ordinary type met with in the northern temperate zone, exhibiting generally two principal and two subordinate extreme values each day, with the principal turning hours shortly after 8 o'clock a. m. and sbortly after 1 o'clock p. m.; the average position of the magnet or the mean of the day is reached shortly after half past ten a. m. A small easter1y extreme is reached about two hours before midnight, followed by a small westerly extreme soon after midnight. On the yearly average, the daily range of the priucipal wave is less thau 6', but that of the secondary is sixty times less, or only 0'. 1 For convenience of CQWpariSQll with the da.ily variation at other stations, and for a more H.Ex.80-17

At Key Vvest the Survey secured a 6-:vear series of magnetic observations, absolute and differential, for which certain results are gfre11 in the Coast Survey Report for 1874, Appendix No. 9.

A comparison of the monthly curves of the diurnal variatioll.IJShows them to be -0f tlie same shape even in some minute detail, although with relation to the distribution of land and oceau the two stations are located very dissimilarly. On the yearly average, the diurnal Yariation of the declination at Key West for the epoch· 1864.5 is given by the expression:
0
I

0

d=+l.129 sin ( e+1s 24)+1.182 sin (2e+206 22) +0.506 sin (30+58 03)+0.151 sin (48+279 53)

+ ....... .

How closely these expressions for Los Angeles and Key \Vest represent the obser\·ed values of the diurnal variation may be seen from the following differences, or observed minus computed (0-C) values, viz:

Hence we have the probable error of any single hourly repre$entation for Los Angeles ::1::0'.06 and for Key West ::1::0'.04 The systematic concurrence of< the signs of (0-U) shows that the giveu expressions are not exhaustive. The formulre give the times when in the morning the average declination of the day (mean of 24 hourly readings) is reached, also the times of the daily extreme phases with their amount of deflections, as follows :

CO:MPA.RISON OF TOTA.L SOLA.R·DIURNAL VA.RIA.TIO~ OF THE MAGNETIC DECLINATION A NUMBER OF PROMINENT STATIONS IN NORTH .A.MERICA.

The following oomparative table of the diurnal variation has been prepared in order to exhibit the chang-es which the total solar-diurnal variation undergoes with a change of geographical ptisition within the region of North America. The series of observations admitted exteud over one or more years, and in no instance have any so.called disturbances been excluded. Had the normal or simply the solar-diurnal variation been tabulated the values would not compare perfectly on account of the more or less arbitrary way in which the distmbances were treate~. The year or yea.rs of each series is added t_o admit of a correction for position in the sun.spot period.

A perusal of the tabular values for the localities marked 1 to G, and which represent all that part of the United States and Canada which lies south of the forty-ninth parallel, shows a "Very close accord of the diurnal variation, having an average maxim um easterly defiectiou of 3 1 .2 at about 7h.9 in the morninga.nd an average maximum westerly defiection of 3'.6 at about lh.4 in the afternoon, although the dip varies 20iO between these geographfoal limits. At Sitka. the range reaches already 10'.6 and beyond, with a dip of soo and more, th& diurnal range rapidly rises, attaini1!g 1° 40' nearly at Fort Conger.

and we have seen that this time is subject to an annual inequality which at Los Angeles in the sumruer months displaces it to about IOhOOm and in the winter months to about llh 3om. The tabnlar values are exbil>ited on accompanying diagram (illustration No. 22). The annual inequalities of tlie di11rnal ·rariatfon.-'I'hese inequalities consist in a systematic change in tlie form and the magnitude of the solar-diurnal variation, as is clearly exhibited in the accompan;ying illustration (No. 23) by Jines of dashes connecting the corresponding phases from month to month. The magnitude of the change at the several hours is best shown by the contrast of the diurual variation in the half year when the sun is in north declination and the half year when in sonth declination. Thus by subtracting the annual mean for any hour from the six-monthly mean April to Septem)Jer, inclusive, and again from the sixth-monthly mean October to :March, inclusive, for the same hour, we get the following table of the semiannual inequality at tbe seYeral hours:

The diagram for Key West wonltl differ but slightly from this. ·we have for both places the hour 7 showing tlte maximum change of 3' nearly, and the hour 11 as the one of the next greatest change of 2!j' alJollt. The direction of the magnet is most nearly constant throughout the year about 9h 2om, and again near lh, also near lSh. In Coast Survey Report for 1860, Appendix No. 23, being Part II of the discussion of the magnetic observations at Girard College, Phila<lelpLia (1840-'45), by Dr. A. D.

UNITED ST.ATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Observations for declination a.re frequently made abontthe times of the two principal extremes of the diurnal variation, and the mean of the two directions at these times is then taken to represent the daily mean (from 24 hourly readings). How near this assumption approaches the truth may be judged from the following comparisons:

Both at Los A.ngeles and at Key West the morning or eastern elongation exceeds in magnitude the afternoon or western elongation, the mean of the two elongations, therefore, is too great compared with the meau of the day, hence ea.st declination when deduced from the mean of the two daily extremes must be dimitiished by 0'.3. On the other hand, at Philadelphia, the morning or eastern elongation is the smaller, hence the west declination (deduced from the extremes) at that placr, needs to he diminished; the amount, however, is the same. Generally, therefore, this correction to results from ordinar.r field work may be neglected. Long11eriod inequalities in the total sol<ir-diurnal 'Variation of the declination.-The fact that the annual mean of the diurnal range follows closels the periodic changes in the frequency of the sunspots was noted as early as 1852, i. a large declination range was found to correspond to the time of great activity of the sun in the production of spots and vice 'l'ersa. It remains to show this dependence or relation in the case of the observations at Los Angeles. In consequence of the annual iuequality in the solar-diurnal range, the yearly average values of the dinrual range are alone directly available for comparison with. Dr. R. Wolf's rela.t\ve numbers of spot frequency aml extent. The latter numbers were taken from his latest publication in the "Vierteljahrschrift der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft," in Ziirich; Erstes Heft, 1888, Table III, viz:

The remainder for the year 1887 was taken from the same publication, the numbers being the mean of 3 series. Those for July, August, and December were reduced by l. 2 in order that the annual mean should be preserved as given by Dr. \Volf. The series of numbers for 1888 was copied from Astr. Nachric.hten No. 2887 and the numbers for 1889 from No. 2959. T11ese relati,·e numbers are still subject to corrections. 1887

These numbers will answer for our purj1ose as well as more refined measures, which depend on the amount of spotted area depicted on the daily photographs of the sun.· From these numbers it will be seen that the Los Angeles magnetic observations commenced shortly befat·e the last maximum sun-spot development and extend beyond the minimum recently attained, either in the last quarter of 1888 or more probably in 1889. In the column below beaded R the annual mean values of the relative numbers are given for the se'reral obsen-ing years, October to October. The declination range was obtained by collating the monthly means of scale-readings for each of the hours 6 to 15, also, for mean of day, and forming average values for each of the 7 years of observation. The deflection ( + to the east) for each hour is found by subtracting the mean of the day from that of each hom. Tile scale-divisions were converted into IDinutes of arc and the hourly results were plotted on a suitable seal e in order to find tile intermediate extreme, values as gh·en in the table below.

The adjacent diagram (lllustration No. 24} fnrther illustrates the relation existing between sun.spots and diurnal range of declination. The diagram shows plainly that the morning or easterly deflection is subject to a greater extent to the influence of the sun-spots than the afternoon or opposite deflection, and the same is true, though less marked, for Key West (Coast Survey Report for 1874, App. 9, p. 129.)* ' Ratio of declination ranges ·in years of extremes of sun-s-pot aetivity.-This ratio of the maximum to the minimum declination range is for Los Angeles, 1.37; for Key West, 1.6i; and for Toronto, Canada, 1.51 (Younghusband and Lefroy). Our series is too short to investigate the lagging behind of the magnetic ranges a,s noted elsewhere. So far as known there are at least two dominant inequalities of Jong period in the observed productivity of sun-spots, of which the shorter one, or the eleven-and-one-third-year period, is the best determined and the only one available for comparison with our series of magnetic observa· tions. This period is subject to considerable fluctuations as to length and development to which

the motion of the magnet apparently conforms, and since there can be no doubt of tbe complex composition of the sun-spot curve we must, likewise, consider tlie observe\! daily motion of the magnet as governed by a number of laws, each cause ccrntribnting its effect to the resultant direction. Sepa,,·ation and, analysis of tlte dist?n-banccs; diurnal disturbance-variation and solar-diurnal variation of the declination.-Any observation deviating from what is taken as the normal solartliurnal yariation may be considered a disturbance; more frequently, however, we designate by a disturbance a large deviation from the daily normal motion of the magnet and, in particular, those sudden deflections whfoh simultaneously affect large areas of tlie earth's surface. We may also distinguish at any one station isolated disturbances and perturbed motions persisting for one or several days. For the analysis of the disturbances there is as yet no general agreement as to treatment, and it is largely a matter :or individual experience what process would for any location be most advantageous. A method applicable for continuous registered <lata may fail for eye-observations made at certain hours, and another may apply to an equatorial or middle-latitude station, but fail in the higher latitudes, where the horizontal component of the magnetic force is very weak and consequently the diurnal variation is much exaggerated and apparently irregular. Of the several methods proposed by Sabine, Lloyd, and Broun, and later on by Dr. Wild and J. P. Van der Stok, we give the preference to the practical and hitherto successful method of Sabine, at least as far as it refers to the elucidation of the laws of the disturbances, but it is 1iro. posed here to compare bis values of the normal diurnal variation with the values which can be derived, according to Dr. Wild's proposition, by a selection of all the magnetically quiet days, as exhibited by the photographic traces and by comparing their results. Van der Stok's method is regarded as too laborious to be profitably employed in the present case. There is necessarily some arbitrary step in every method, either as to the limit of what should be regarded a disturb· ance or what degree of smoothness or shape should constitute a normal curve, since we can not know how far disturbances, not recognizable by their size, may affect this shape. Sepamtion and analysis of the larger disturbances of the declination.-In accordance with the method proposed for discussion,· the first step is to settle upon the inferior limit of deviation beyond which an observed value will be marked a disturbance and will be t:ixcluded from the mean of the month; for this we need the mea1i error, 1n, of an observation found by comparing each hourly value with its monthly mean from n values and noting the difference v; we then
have

m=· ITvvl \jn-1
or more simply,

for which we can also write, approximately,
m=!:~53[v 1i-0.5

since n equals either 28, 29, 30, or 31. For a preliminary estimate t we may put m=t of the extreme range of the values for any one hour, for that hour. In determining m it is requisite to include24 hours, or at least symmetrically arranged hours, in order to eliminate the effect of the diurnal variation of the disturbances, and
" See a1110 rema.rks on the method in "Report upon magnetic observations ma.de at the U- S. Polar station, Oogla.amie, Point Barrow, Alaska, 1881-'82-'83," Appendix 13, Coa,st and Geodetic Survey Report for 1883, pp. 3·l8-34ll, and "Contributions to terrestrial magnetism, Appendix No_ 139, pp. 539-548, Yol. 2 of Report ou the Proeeedings of the U. S. Expedition to Lady Franklin Bay, Grinnell Land," by Lieut-' A. W_ Greely, Washington, 1888. [N. 13.0n page 610 of that report the numbers in column headed "Magnetic moment in C. G. S. units" should be canceled as en:onoons.} t Taking the probable error approximately equal to one-seventh of the greatest ra.nge of the errors of observa-

likewise to use the middle year of the series (in our case) to eliminate the sun-spot inequality, and for that year to use every month to eliminate the annual inequality in the disturbances. For Los Angeles, 24 values were obtained, viz, one value ea-0h for October, 1885, at lh and 13h, for November, at 2h and 14h, for December, at 3h and 15h, for January, 188fl, 4 11 aml 16h, and so on to Sepfomber, 1886, at noon and miduigbt; whence average value, ·
m= ± 1.3 scale-divisions.

[The rough method abo>e indicated gave ± 1.5] A first trial was made with the limit 1~ 1n or ± 2 divisions (according to Lloyd), bnt this was found to separate rather more values than was desirable, in other words it cut too deep into the diurnal curve, arnl it was decided t-0 adopt± 2.5 divisions, or ±2'.0, for our limit; hence all observa. tions differing more than that amount from their respective monthly means were marked (large) disturbances; 011 the average every fifteenth was so marked. The limit adopted by me for Key 'Vest series was ± 2'.6; this separated 1 in every 31 observations. At Philadelphia Dr. Bache adopted the limit ± 3'.6, which separated 1in10 observations. At Toronto at first ::l: 3 1.G, afterwards :!: 5 1.0 was taken as the limit, th(} latter separating 1 in 17 observations. In the hourly record of scale-readings all values differing more than 2.5 scale-divisions from their respective monthly means for that hour were considered (large) disturbances and were marked with an asterisk. The bottom line of that record contains the resulting monthly normals for each hour after these disturbed values had been separated.· The whole of this work was performed by Mr. L.A. Bauer of the Computing Division. The tot~l number of disturbed hourly values thus separated was 4 010, and, since the total numher of observations is 61 344 1 we have the ratio 1 to 15 Yery nearly.

(c) The muuber of disturbances whicll detlect the north-seeking end of the magnet to the eastward is greater than those which rleflect it to the westward in the proportion of 1.08 to 1. The same superiority in number of the easterly deflections was found at Tor011 to, Canada (1841-'48), ratio l.17 to 1, and at Key West, Fla. (186()-'66), · ratio 1.33 to 1, and at Lady Franklin Bay (Lieutenant Greely's expedition), 1882-'83, the ratio wa.s 1.30to1. (d) The aggregate magnitude of the easterly defiections is greater than. that of the westerly, in the following proportions: Los ..Angeles, Ual., 1.16 to 1 Key West, ];'la., 1.43 to 1 Toronto, Can., 1.40 to 1 1.63 to 1 (1\Iaguire's series of 1852-'53-'54.)

From these tables we can draw the following conclusions: (a) The distribution of the westerly and easterly disturbances over the several months of the year is the same whether we regard their number or their magnitude. This is plainly shown by the mean ratios. (b) The law of the distribution of the disturbances in the yearly cycle shows maxima. in the eq11inoctial mouths (marked V. E. and A. E.), with September preponderating over March, and minima in the solstitial months (marked W. S. and S. S.), with the most decided minimum in December, but au iutli:tfereut, value in June. This would indicate a semiannual variation, remlering the December value lower and the June value higher than they otherwise would be. The same law of number of <lif·tnrhances as depending on the season of the year holds for Philadelphia, Key West, and Toronto, and any
*C. S. Report for 1874, p. 121; at Philadelphia ( 1840-' 45), the result was indecisive.

apparent displacement of one month earlier or fater than that indicated by the position of the sun could easily be accounted for by au insufficient number of observations. (c) It would also appear that the December minimum for stations in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the June miuimum at stations in the southern hemisphere.· In other words, these minima occur in the cold season of the year. Likewise tll.ere is rna.son to believe that the superior and inferior maxima for the northern hemisphere exchange places in the southern hemisphere. (d) The excess of the easterly over the westerly disturbances is greater in the summer montlJs (April to September inclusin) than in the winter months (October to March inclusive). In the former season the excess is 218, in the latter season -51; -i.e., in winter the westerly disturbances pre>ail. This is also the case for Toronto and for Key West. The respective numbers for Key West are 172 and 32, there being but one montl.t (March) ic1 which westerly disturbances exceecl in number those of opposite direction, while at Los Angeles there were three such months {January, February, and Maroo).

From these tables we gather the following information: (a) The most remarkable feature is tile fact of the easterly disturbances presenting a double progression in a day, whereas the westerly disturbances show bnt one. This is also found to be the case for Key "\Vest, Philadelphia, and Toronto, and is sup11osed also true at other stations; yet for certain places in the southern hemisphere the reverse law seems to obtain. Tl.tis diversity in the law for eastern and western disturbances would point to their having a different origin. With respect to number of disturb~nces, the following comparative table wi.ll best show the accord between the extreme values at difforent stations.

(b) The table shows the simultaneous occurrence at about 2lh of the greatest number of east· erly disturbances and of the least number of westerly disturbances. (c) Irrespective of direction, the most disturbed time of the day is between 9\ 10\ and Uh, and the least disturbed about 17h; less pronounced times are 1\ 2h, and 6h; the former hours greater, the latter less disturbed than the average. If we divide tbe day into two equal parts, say from 7h to 18h iuclusirn, and from 19h to 6\ we find in the first half day, or that of day hours, 2405 disturlmnces, while there are but 16G5 disturbances in the second half or that of night hours. (d) While the easterly disturbances upon the whole predominate over the westel'n ones, we find them most act.ive about .3 hours before midnight, whereas the excess of the westerly m·er the easterly disturbances is most marked about 1 hour before noon, the respective aggregate excess being+ 633 divisions and -361 divisions. From 4 o'clock in the morning to 5 in the afternoon the icesterly disturbances are iu excess in number and magnitude; in the remaining hours of the day the easterly disturbances greatly exceed the westerly ones. The normal solar-diurnal 11ariation of the declinati-On.-In the following table will be found collected the hourly normals as given at the foot of each monthly tallnlation, but condensed into a singlet.able; each value is therefore the mea.n of seven undisturbed ordinates.

UNITED STATES CO.A.ST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Comparing the tabular values of the normal solar-diurnal with the total solar-diurnal variation, as previously given, no change is noticeable in the general character of the variation, aµcl this is true whether we make the comparisou fur the whole year or for the half-years when the sun has north and when it has south declination. The change from one season to the other is plainly brought out in the diagram (illustration No. 25), which also shows that the small secondary undulation during the night hours (persisting for about 6 hours preceding midnight) is only noticeable in the winter half-year, and entirely disappears during the summer half year. The greater disturbances having been removed, the diurnal range is increased thereby 0'.1 very nearly, but at no hour does the difference between the disturbed and the normal ordinates rise to 0'.2 · It would therefore be a waste of labor to rediscuss the hourly normals, and the various laws already brought out for the total solar-diurnal variation apply equally to the normal variation. We have the average daily range during the half-year, sun north of the equator, 7'.8, and during the half-year, sun south of the equator, '1'.8; a·erage for the year, 6'.3 Days of large range of disturbances in decl'ination.-In the preceding investigation we have made exclusive use of the hourly trace readings; thus no account was taken of the disturbances, however large, that may have occurred between these hours.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIU SURVEY.

The diurnal range of the declination is about 6 1 ; this was exceeded two and a half times on tbe :'")3 disturbed days in a total of 2 557 days, or in tile proportion of 1 day in 48. On 4 days only was the disturbed range equal to four times tlte average range. The maximum range on any one day during 7 yea.rs was 1o07'.1, and the maximum detlection from the normal was 40'.2 (No,·ember 17, 1882).
INVESTIGATIO.\' 01'' THE LUNAR INFLUENCl, ON TRE MACNETIC DIWLlNATION AS OllSERYED AT LO~ ANGELES, 1892-1889

Tbe most efficient process to prepare the basis for this investigation would l>e to tabulate anew the ordinates of the traces according to lunar hours; but, on account of the great labor iuYolved, the values already tabulated according to solar hours· may be utilized by marking each with the corresponding hour angle of the moon, and by collecting all the values belonging to a gi1'en lunar hour and deducing a mean value for each of the twenty-four lunar hours. Since a solar hour will as often precede as follow a. lunar hour, the difference iu any case can not exceed half an hour. To find the local mean (astronomical) time of the moon's upper transit O\'er the mcridiau, we take the mean time of the upper transit over the meridian of Greenwich from the American Epl!emeri.s and Nautical .Almanac, and refer the same to the Los Angeles meridian by adding the }1l'Od· net of the longitude (7 11 53.0111 west) and of the lunar-hourly difference. The nearest solar hour thereto was marked in the table U. T., or 0 11 ; similarly the time of the moon's lower transit was found and marked L. T., or 12h. The intermediate tabular .ordinates were thus marked with their nearest lunar hour, and in case the latter fell midway bet\1·een two solar hours the mean of the two.solar ordinates was substituted for the single ordinate. In order to eliminate the effect of the solar.diurnal variation of the annual change and of the annual variation, the difference of each ordinate from the monthly normal corresponding to it was tabulated and entered under its proper lunar hour. From this tabulation all differences previously marked as disiurbances were excluded. Lunar· diurnal variation front observations of tTte magnetic declination at Los Angeles, Oal.-Kl'eil 1n 1841, and soon after Broun and Sabine, also Bache in 1860, have shown that the moon has a minute effect on the declination needle, causing in each lunar day a double oscillation of small am. plitude; these investigations were soon extended to other magnetic elements~ and later on applied to cases depending on position in the lunar orbit. In consequence of the great labor involved in using a 7.year hourly series, the lunar·diurnal variation was brought out for a period of 3 years only, viz, for the Jears October, 1882! to Octo· ber, 1883, October, 1885, to October, 1886, and October, 1888, to October, 1889. The first year is one which includes the time about a sun-spot maximum and the last year probably includes a sun·spot minimum. These years, as will be seen, cover a sufficient length of time to clearly bring

out the variation. The number of observations or hourly ordinate.s involved were:
7 725 in 1882-'83 ~ ~ 322 7 913 in 11385-'86 Which give respectively an average number of values for each 11ma.r hour of 32£1 8 169 in 1888-'89 340

The increase in these numbers is due to decreasing frequency in the number of disturbed ordi· nates. The average number of ordinates for any one hour covering the period of half a :rear would be 165, which is about the lower limit for which a satisfactory result of the variation may be expected. Lunar.diurnal variation derived from 3 years of obser11ation of tlie magnetic declination at Los An· geles, Cal.-A + sign indicates that the direction of the north end of the magnet is ea&t of its normal or undeflected position, a - sign, that it is to the west. Value of one scale-division, ()l.794, or 47" .6 · The consistency of the results for a variation of which the amplitude (half range) is below 10" of angular deflectfon is the best evidence of the accuracy of the instrumental record, as well
"There are more than 61 000 ordinates available, comprising 2 557 <la.ya; the total length of the declination traces when pnt together, end to end, would be nearly one kilometre, or six-tenths of a. statllte mile; for the atudy of the lunar effect (diurnal variation) but 011e-fourth of a mile ofthia ribbou was wied.

In the first place we notice that the effect of the moon on tb.e declination is to produce at all the stations a double oscillation in ea.ch lunar day, ·i. two deflections to th.e east and two intermediate deflections to the west, these extremes lying a.bout 6 lunar hours apart; with a half range varying betweeu 5" and 20'' at different stations. Secondly, it appears that at Los Angeles the lunar-diurnal va.ria.tion comes out the same for the years of maximum, of average, and of minimum suu-spot activity, and is thus shown to be independent of the s11n-spot cycle; the same conclusion was reached by Sabine from his discussion of the Toronto and Hob.arton observations, viz: that there is no systematic iufiueuce in the lnnardiarnal variation such a.s we know to be present in the solar-diurnal val'iation and depending on the san-spot cycle.

tions, tbongbt there was as yet not sufticirnt evidenCP. to flna1ly decide this point. We nf'Xt notice tlie close at:cortl in the range11, with the grf'afest etlect at Tomato and with the lt>ast at Pt>kin; we also ohsnve a ,-ariability of I or 2 Lours iu tlle local tirues of the extreme phases (i<ee tlie u11derlined tabular \aluei,;). The char:tcteristic form of the lunar-diurnal varlation is Nhowu in the accompanying diagram (illustration No. 27) for each of the 3 Jears submitted to analysis from the Los .Angeles Record. The analogy appareutly suggested by such curves between the magnetic and tidal actions has long· since been reruarked, but the manner of action, whether mechanical or otherwi;;e iuductivt-ly intlue11ciug e!Pctric earth currents, is still in a state of mere conjecture. That :the moon, like the earth, should be a magnetic body and posi:1eiss a magnetic axis and poles would seem a reasonable I1n1otbesis, f1om "hich it would follow that mutual magnetic iufluence might h~re be observable as well as a refin action of tlie BUD spot fopquality. 'Ihe double oscillation whieh is cha ractnistic of the lunar-diurnal variation may in part be due to the dynamical stress set up in the earth's body through tidal action, which changes 8ign every 6 lunar hours, and thus may affect the magnetic conditions. A comparison of the lunar-diurnal variation, as ot>served at various places, is best thrown into an analytical expression, viz:

UNI'fED STATES COAST AND GEODETHJ SURVEY.

By reference to annexed diagram (illustration No. 28), which exhibits the lunar-diurn11l variation during the winter half-year and the summer half-year as observed, as well as the computed variation ou the yearly average by the heavy smooth curve which was deri\"ed from the preceding formula, it will be seen that the extreme positions are reached nearly two hours later in summer than in winter; also that the amplitude for extremes occurring just before the upper culmination and about five hours later is increased in summer as comparecl with the winter amplitude, the contrary being the case at the lower culmination. The same law was brought out at Philadelphia, the summer extremes occurring later and the amplitudes being laTger in summer ti.Jan in winter. l111nar c.tfect on thcmugnetic declinntion depending on the moon1s positi<ni in its m·bit.--Thereis still mud1 uncertainty respecting the effect of the moon as depending on its position in its orbit relative to the sun, i. e., on the lunar phases or age of the moon, and the same uns;atisfactory state of our know le<lge exists as to the supposed dependence of changes of the earth's magnetism with respect to thC' moon\; variations in declination and in distance. Difl'el'Cnt investigators foun<l either negative results or effects of uo great reliability, owing no doubt mainly to the smallne,~s of the influence when its existence conld be made ont at all. The results obtained from the Los Angeles reconl necessarily pal'take of this cLaracter; rnwertlleless, they are supposed to assist in the general elucidation of facts. ' Lunar effect dependi11g on the moon's raryin{I phases.-For ~his invest1gation the days of occur· re11ce of new moon, of first quarter, of fn11 moon, and of last quarter were marked in the table of hourly and daily mean readings of the declination; the mean for 29Jt days, i. e, for the synodic month (from new moon to new moon), was then taken and subtracted from the daily means for 3 days before to three days after each phase; the same was done for each lunation, and the respective means for the whole series were united with the following results, derived from the whole series, 1882-1889, or from 86 lunations.

If we conceive the sun, like the earth, to possess magnetic property and to havo its magnetic poles not coincident with its poles of axial rotation, the alternate presentation towards the earth of these magnetic pol<'s during the synodic rotation of the sun might be supposed to exert a meas. urable inductive influence on terrestrial magnetism and in particular on the horizontal com11onent which admits of Yery refin<:d measmes. The first steps tuwanls a recognition of a connection between the solar rotation period and variations in the horizontal component of terrestrial magnetism are due to John .Allan Broun, who, in the year 1858, noticed a tendency, in the Trernnd1um (Southern India) observations, of certain changes to recur at. intervals of about 26 days; the same tendency and relation were rediscovered in 1871 by Dr. Hornstein, of the Prague observatory, and the research was extende1l hy him to the declination and inclination for sever<tl localities, and hi::; method has since been generally followed. The iuvestigations were also made to em brace the vertical force, daily ranges and disturbances; these latest results are chiefly <lne to Dr. P. A. Muller and J. Liznar. The method involves the formation of hourly differences from the monthly mean and the respective daily readings. These monthly tables of 11ourly differences baYe frequently served a3 the basis of general discussions, especially for the elucidation of the laws of disturbances, by some investigators the plain monthly mean for any hour being replaced by the normal or by a mran value depending on certain selected days of supposed trauquil and regular character. Tllis la,_t method was especially advocatetl by Dr. H. Wild for use by tlrn late International Polar Researci1 !Ml ties. The process of reduction was as follows: 'Ihe monthly uudisturbetl uwa11 or tile 11ormal v:1 lue corresponding to any of tbe hourly differential decliuatiou readings was subtractell frow ti.Jc daily readings at that hour aml the remainders were tabulated. All largely disturbed values or tlwse differing more than 2.u scale di visions from their respecti \'C uormals were excluded frow t lw proc· ess. The twenty-four (or less) tabular differences were tllen summed up for each day, i::e11aratdy for the positive and for tl1e negative valut:s, and the respectiYe sums were divided by the nnmber of occurrence. The daily av~rages so obtained, one answering to tile a\erage eastern, tbL~ other to the average western deflection, form'ed the basis of the tabulation. The process was extended over the first and o·er the last year of the.series, i.e., for yenrs of greatest (about) am] least (about) sun-spot activity, each comprising 14 solar rotatiou 1icriods. These daily al·erages were arranged for periods of24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 days, and the means were taken of the 14 entries for each day of every period, viz:

Comparing the mean values d a.t the bottom of the preceding tabulation we notice the aame fact, as already brought out for the "larger disturbances," namely tlie greater magnitude of the easterly in comparison with the westerly deflections from the normal values-this law holds consequently for all disturbances, large or small. The tabular difference amom1ts to Od.05 during the first year and last years. The 11ext step is to represent the variation of the numbers in each vertical column, i.e., for every selected period as a simple harmonic function of the time. The tabular numbers corresponding to any period p may be expressed by

We have next to find the particular value of p 1 which makes the amplitude a maximum, for this purpose we express the amplitude A as a function of the period, viz:
A= a+ fl (p-26) + y (p-26)2 where 26 is a conveniently assumed approximate value for the period. dA d.ji = 0.

For the maximum we put

It is plain that the amplitudes of the a.hove expressions from the eastern deflections do not follow any systematic la.w, and no value for p can. therefore be deduced from them; this failure is evidently caused by the excessive smallness of the solar rotational effect on the direction of the horizontal decH,nation magnet, its angular defieetion on one side and the other,of the undisJ;nrbed direetion being only about 2! seconds of arc.

According to this last result tile synodic rotation period would be between 25Jt and 2~ days, but from the first yea.r't1 disc11ssion it would be 25k days. The minuteness of the effect precludes any closer or more precise statement. The values of the synodic rotation of the sun as deduced from obser'\'ed magnetic phenomena at a number of stations, as giv~n by the several investigators mentioned above, are included between the limits 25.4:7 and 26.69 days; and their average is very nearly 26 days. There is but one other America.u station where the method has been applied, llamely, Fort Rae,· one of the Hudson Bay Company's posts, situated in latitude 620 38'.9 and in longitude 1150 13".8, on an arm of the Great Slave Lake. For this place and for Jau-Ma;yen, also in a high latitude, Mr. Liznart deduees the mean period 2a.85 days, depending on variations of declinations, of horizontal and ofvertica.l forces, during 13 rotations. At Fort Rae the amplitude amounted to 55', presenting a strong contrast to the smallness of the correspondi11g value for the comparatively low (magnetic) latitude of Los Angeles. {At Fort Rae the dip was 820 55'.3; at Los Angeles, 59° 30'.6.]t

THE GULF STREAM-A DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS EMPLOYED IN THE INVESTIGATION, AND THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH.

·
By JOHN ELLIOTT PILLSBURY. Lieut:enant, U.S. Navy. Assistant -U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

[Submitted for publication August 30, 1890.]

PREFACE.

The writer, while executive officer of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey st~amer Blake, devised an instrument in 1876 for the purpose of ascertaining the direction and velocity of the currents at any depth. This was intended to be used from a boat at anchor and to replace the system then in use, viz, floating and submerged cans with a log line. Before the model could be tried he was ordered to other naval duty, and nothing further was attempted with the instrument until he was detaHed for command of the same vessel in 1884. Permission was then granted by the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, at the request of the Hydrographic Inspector, Conummder C. M. Chester, U. S. Navy, to have one o\ these instruments mad(~ with a view of using it on board the Blake while at. anchor in the Gulf Stream. Thi:- current-meter ha::; been used since that time, and the method devilied for auchori11g the vessel has been entirely successful up to 2,180 fathoms, the greatest de1)th attempted. This memoir has been written to describe the methods employed' in the investigation of the Gulf Stream and the result£ of the research. During the five yea.rs the writer commanded the Blake he received every encouragement and support from the officers of the Coast Survey.

The H ydrographic Inspectors, Commanders C. M. Chester and C. M. !homas and Lieut. Commander W. H. Brownson, who were charged with the duty of supervising all hydrographic work, left it to the discretion of the commanding officer to decide all questions connected with the work. The Superintendents, Mr. F. M. Thorn and Dr. T. C. Mendenhall, have been most ~iberal in the allotment of the necessary money, and their instructions ha.ve been only the roost general as to the time and locality of the examinations. As a preliminary to the report of the work of the Blake, a history of previous investigations 0£, the Gulf Stream has been inserted. Great assistance in preparing this portion has been derived from the manuscripts on the subject which were written for the Coast Survey by Dr. J. G. Kohl, Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, and Mr. 0. H. 'l'ittmann, Assistant, and also from the valuable collection of maps at the library of Harvard University, to which I have had free access through the kindness of the librarian, Mr. Justin Winsor.

THE GULF STREAM.
INTRODUCTION.
Geography, the science that gives to us a knowledge of the earth's surface, is divided into two branches: first, all that pertains to the <'Onfiguration, usually called geography, and second, everything relating to tlw natural forces acting thereon, called physical geography. These snhjects are interlaced with the study of nearly eYery branch of human knowledge tending toward the good of the race in its struggle toward impr°'·ement. At first the pursuit of wealth by the disconry of new lands and peoples, brought about a study of the configuration of the surface, but little hy little it was seen that the study also of the physical forces assisted towa,rd this end and to the ease and comfort of mankind at large. The Sun without doubt is the greatest factor in the support of terrestrial life, but his intense heat is tempered and governed by the elements, air and water, without which life as at present constituted on our globe would be unsupportable. The total area of the earth's surface is about 200,000,000 ~quare miles, and of this only about one-fourth fr, laml. The mean elevation of the land above the sea is less than 2,500 feet, while the mean depth of the ocean is probably about 12,000 feet. The total volume of the land above the sea level, therefore, is only about one twentieth of the volume of the ocean. The surface of the ground quickly becomes heated by the direct rays of the sun, but it also quickly radiates its heat into the air, producing an aerial current. The surface of the water, on the other hand, absorlJing the sun's heat, rapidly communicates it to the adjoining stratum, and, radiatiou from its surface being comparatively slow, its currents transfer the heat so acquired to distant points. The tempering influence on the climate is the wind, taking the heat and moisture from thiB neated water and transferring

it to the laml It .is arg-uerl most foffihly that such a stupendous change in the elimatology of the world as existed during the glacial period was cauf'ed hy the preces:.;ion of the equinoxes and the change in the eccentricity of the earth's orhit effecting an alteration in the great heat (foitrilrnt?rR, the oeean currents. To (·.omrner('e aml navigation the study of these cun·ents is of the utmost Yalne. Tlw length of the voyage is sl1ortened, and the chance of safE:>ty to vesst·1, cargo, arn1 lives is increasecl A strong wim1 agninst a currm1t pr(l(1uct-s a. <1angerous sea, aml, by a kuowledge of the la·ws of the water's flow, a \'essel, hy a trifling change of course, ma:~ escape the <la11ger. I venture to quote from a brochure on the subject of the Gulf Stream, hy His Highne;;s, Albert, Prince of l\Ionaco. He says:

Zoological geography may consider them [ocean currents] as higlnn1ys wl1ieh uuite the zones of the ocean, and con:sequeutly cause the dissemination of species, and at the same time by the iutt~nsely progn'8siYe attenuation of salt and the tempernture of thrn.;e waters this highway facilitates the evolution nf spceies. It is thu,.; that t11e enrrents t>nter into the question so important to origin)'-;, mo110geuism, or polygeni:.;m. Anthropology, for example, holds them regp011sible for the solution of the g-reat problem, that of human migrations, which spre1ul en·n to tlte di;;taut archipdagos the different varieties of the race man, at the time when there was scarcely a disceruj.hle ditforpnce lH·t\n-"en man awl lwa:st, aud he had at his disposal only ruilinumtary means for struggling against the brute forces of nature. · ., Botany and zoology ought to be interested in our researches, for the condition:-; of organic life in all its hearingR are governed hy these current:.; either warm or <·old, which give to :mlJterrauean regionR a n·ritahfo e1imate; and it is perhaps owing to certain <listurhlll('t·s whid1 have taken place in the volume, direction, and fr1tqH·n1tun· of tlwse currents that the almost entire disappearance of St'Y(·ral kirnh; of migmtory fhh is attributed, all, for example, that of tlte sanli11e:-;, which formerly lined the coasts of France in

Paleontology itAelf ought to he interested in our researclws, for is it not evident that the rivers, drifting dead bodies aerosR the continents, (1po::;it them on sand banks far from their habitat to become the fossils of the future'f There is another reason for stn<l ying these eurrentH which will ultimately have the most beneficial influence on mankind. It i:3 now known that the currents vary through certain force,;; rtcting upon them, by perio<lic chang·es, entirely according to law, and again through nppanmtly erratic forces. Probah1y e\·ery motion of these rast bodies is absolutely govemf;fl by laws which can be aRcertained. 'The moisture and varying temperatun' of the lmul depends largely upon the positions of these currents ju the oceau, and it is thought that when lve know tlw laws of the latter vrn ·will, with the aid of meteorology, be able to say to tlil" farmer;:; hundreds of miles distant from the sea, "you will han1 an abnormal amount of rain duriug next summer," or "the winter will be cold and elear," and by thes(e predictions they can plan~ a crop to suit the circumstance or provide an unusual amount of food for their stock. \Ve will be able to say to the mariner, at such tin1.e the current will be so much an h01u in such a direction, ::md the percentage of error will be but trifling. From a study of thest> great forces, then, we derfre our greatest benefits, and any amount of \Yell-directed effort to gain a complete mastery of their laws will revert directly to the good of the human race. In the Atlantic Ocean the currents are probably more pronounC'ed than in either the Pacific or Indian Oeertns. \Vithont entering upon H di,;cnssion at this point as to the causes of ocean flo'-Y or of any parti<"nlar currN1t, a brief description of the main streams will not he out of place, for they arp all connected more or less intimately with our own Gulf Stream. The cqirntorial current is usuaJly described as being a broad hand of watt·r moving slowly across the Atlantic in the tropics. The portion situatP1l south of the equator is divided into two part~ npo11 meeting the resistance of Cape St. Roque, the eastern Ralient point of the South American coast. One branch turns to the southward toward the Antarctic, a.1111 the other is forced to the westward itlong the shores of Brazil .and Gu yaua. This

branch is calletl the Guyana Coast current. The equatorial current has north of the equator n.n aJmost uninterrupted progress until it reaches the \Virnlward J5fands, but a portion of it imping·es against the South American coast arnl perhaps increases the volume of the northern branch of the south equatorial current. At the \Vindward Islands all are united, and a portion of the water enter,.; the Caribbean to assist in forming the Gulf Stream. Between the northern and southern portions of the equatorial current is the Guinea current, 8etting towanl the east and southeast into the Gulf of Guinea. It was formerly thought to be a continuation of the North African current, "bnt later i11ve8tigation," Findlay says, "seems to point to the fact that it is a :flowing back of the waters heaped up to the westward by the prcYalent wincls." It scemR to run strongest in the summer months, when it is felt as far west aR longitude 45°, while in the winter it reaches only as far as the twenty-third meridian. In the K orthern Atlantic Ocean the Labrador current sweeps down from the Arctic along the eastern sboreR of Greenland and from Baffin's Bay and passes the coasts of Labrador and"" N ewfoun<llaml, hoaxing with it vast :fiflfrfa of ice a11d enormous bergs. Reaching the Gnlf Stream, it it-< said to undernm the latter, and also in part form a counter-current to the southward along our coast as fa,r south as Cape Hatteras, or eyen to Cape Canaveral. The Gulf Stream, the grandest and most mighty of any tenestrial phe~10menon, receives its wa,ters from the Caribbean Sea through the Straits of Yucatan. It is common! y said that a portion doubles Cape San Antonio and enters the StraitR of .li,lorida at once, while another part, after makh1g the tour of tlrn Gulf of Mexico, joins the first in its flow to the northward. Its waters are characterized by a deep blue color, great clearness, and high temperature. The eye ean penetrate it to considerable depths, and frequently its meeting with the colder water from the polar regions can be at once distingui~hed. It is Lliffir'.ult for the miwl to grasp the immensity of this great ocean river. The ohmrvations taken at its narrowest po1nt were between three and four thousand in number, surface and subsurface, ·and a calculation of the average volume passing Cape Florida in one hour gives the e~~ormous sum of 90,000,000,00P tons. If this one hour's water were evaporated, the

remaining salt would require more than one hundrerl time:; the number of sea-going vessels now afloat in the world to carry it. That this wonderful body is governed by law in all its motions there can b<~ no doubt. It has its daily and monthly variations in velocity, direction, and temperatun·, changing with as perfect regularity as the titles in a harbor. Nor do I doubt that it has also a yearly fluctuation, an<l perhaps others occupying a cycle of many centuries to complete. The Gulf Stream after leaving the Straits of Florida pursues a general northeasterly direction, i:ressing close to Cape Hatteras, passing between Bermuda and Nova Scotia, and as a defined and permmwut strPam is soon afterwards lost. Current8 are found in the vicinity of the Azores Islands setting about southeast, and also on the coast of Africa setting south, which are sometimes mtlled the southeast extension of the Gulf Stream. \V arm water is found off the coasts of Ireland, Scotland, and Korway, giving evidence of a tropical flow, and this is calle(l the northeast extension of tho Stream. Whether or not these currents are wholly formed of the ''vater iRsuing from the Straits of Florida remains to be discussecl later. Man stauds with bowed head in the presence of nature's visible grandeurs, such as towering mountains, precipices, or ice bergs, forests of immense trees, grand rivers, or waterfall:,;.

the time of Columbus\.; grand discovery of the New \V orld the coastin;r Yesscls of the Old must have recognized that there ·were currents in the Atlantic Ocean which were ontirel.Y inrlependeut of the tides; but the first indication that cmTenhi on the coa.st of North America were notice<l is found in the \Yritings of the .Northmen in their tlescription of voyages to America. SeYer,:.i.l suggestive names were giYen to prominent objects of discovery, such as Stranmsoe (Isle of Currents), Straumsfji:ircle (Bay of Curreuts), arn1 Stranmmes (Cape of Currents), hut their exact location can not be identified. Some r·laim that the voyages extended even to Florida, but it seems prohahle from later jnyestigations that the points named were ·all in the Yicinity of Cape Cod. Uol umhus, before undertaking hi:-; voyage of clisc(ffery toward the wc:-;t, resided f(w some time on the island of Porto Santo, and it was liere that he was shown a piece of curiously carved. wood that had evidently <lrifterl there from other lands. Strange woods and other floating objects WfffO continna.lly heing thrown upon the shores of Nonvay, Scotland, and In~larnl, all of which, to a thonghtful mind like that of Columbus, must 1Hn-e i1Hluceil the helief that there were other lnucls at no great distance to the W{'st, awl so it is prohahle th11t to the Gulf Stream in part the world owes the discovery of America. In al'tttal observations in the Gulf Stream, or rather in the currents co11trihutiug to it, Columbus waR the pioneer. It is relatml that September I !J, 14!1~, lw sntuHted with :t deep-sea line, and the lead, passing through the surface drift i11to tl1P dead water below, showed at once that there was a current setting liis Yessels to the southw:u·cl and westward. On his subse<pumt Yoyages lie remarked the Htrong currents of th<~ Caribbean Sea. He says, for example, "When I left the Dragon's mouth" (the northern

entrance to the Gulf of Paria) " I found the Hea ran so strongly to the westward that between the hour of Mass, when I weighe1l :rnchor, and the hour of Complines, I made 65 leagues of 4 miles each with gentle winds." He also says of the currenti:; entering: the Caribbean between the Windward Islands, "I hold it for certain that the waters of the sea move from east to west with the sky, and that in passing this track they hold a more rapid course, and have thus canied away larger tracts of land, anJ that from hence has resulted the great number of iHlandl'i." On his fourth voyage Columbu,; discoYen·d and noted the strength of the current 011 the coast of Honduras, although it is probable that at this thne the Gulf Stream itself in the· Strait,; of Florida lrnrl been found by indepe1Hlent navigators. Peter Martyr says " he left in wryting that sailing from the Island of Guanassa toward the east he fouud the com·se of the waters so vehement and furious agayn:-it the fore part of his ship that he could at no time touch the ground \Yith his sotmding plummet, bnt that the contrary violence of the \vatci·s would bear it up from the bottom.. He affirmeth also that he could never in one day with a good wynde 'vynn one mile of the <>ourse of the waters." Columbus speculated as to the cause of these currents. He thought that the equatorial waters followed the motions of the he:wens about the world--that is, the rotary m.otion by ,,;rhich the star,;; and air ren1ln' about the globe (as was the opinion of the time), so itlho t1ie water was supposed to partake of the same motion . .John and Sebastian Cahot, in 1497, crosRed tlrn North Atlautie Ocea11, rediscovering the coast of Lahrrnlor. From this point they steered to tlw southwar<l and ~vestward, "so coasting still hy'the shor(' that he wns hrouµ:ht so far into the south hy ronKon of the land hending so much to tlw southward that he was then almost equal iu latitude to tlw sen called Fretum lforcnleurn, having the north pole elevate in manner in the l'arne .legree.

It is probable that the Cabots did not double Cape Hatteras and discover the Gulf Stream. It is thought by some that they entered the Straits of Florida, hut from the testimony of Peter Martyr, quoted above, they were north of Hatteras and probably in the vicinity of the Delaware, but in the longitude of Columbus's discoveries in the 'Vest Indies. They did, however, notice the frwt that a gentle counter current existed. The Cortereals, betvveen 1.~00 and 1502, on several voyages extending from Lahrador toward Cuba, probably crossed the Gulf Stream and may have recognized its strength, but very little is known as to the exact localities visited. In the vear 1508 the Island of Cuba was for the first time circumnavigated. Seha::;tian de Ocampo, under tht> authority of the Governor of Hispaniola, sailed along the northern coast of the island through the old llaharna Channel and around the western point, Cape San Antonio. In this vorage eight months were occupied, and as it was against the Gulf Stream it wonld seem that he must have noticed it. As the times demanded however the custom of secrecy on all expeditions, no record has been left of thP fact. The first recor<l, on which the evidence is satisfactory, of the discovery of the Gulf Stream current, is that of Ponce de Leon in his expedition in 1ii13 in search of the fountain of youth. In company with the after mn·ds famous na,~igator, Antonio de Alaminos, he sailed from Porto Rico, alonµ; the northeastern side of the Bahamas, and crossed the Gulf Stream somewhere abnrn Cape Canaveral. After reaching a latitude of about 30° north he tumeil and skirted the coast as far as 'I'ortugas, thus stemming the cm·n·ut for a distau<'e of several hundred miles. Referring to these currents, their jmmrnl sayf' that they saw a cun·ent which, though they had a good wiml, they could not stem. It seemed that they were going through the water fa;.;t, hut they Hoon n,cogniwd the fact tl1at they were being drh·en back awl that the current was stronger than the wind. Two vessels, which were i.;omewhat nearer the coast, came to anchor; the third vessel, a brig, beiug in deeper water, coul<l not ai1d1or, and was soon "carried away by the current and lost from :-;ight although it was a clear day." Ponce de Leon, on this expedition, crm;sed the stream no less than four times, and Alaminos

received his fir:-it apprenticeship in its navigation, which in after years proYed to be of great he11efit to him. During the next few years the Spauiards crossed aud recrossed tlie Stream. between Cuba and Florida many times in their search for gold, and of course gained much practical knowledge of the streugth and Yclocity 1 .{ its currents. It is interesting to note the speculations of the day as to the cause of this startling phenomenon, aucl its result 011 the sailing route t1) Europe. Peter )fartyr in one of his letters 'Yritten in 1515, being· evidently as yet uninfornwcl as to results of Ponce de Leon's expedition, say8; Here we must somewhat <ligresse from cosmograpliy, alHl make a philmiophical discour8e to search the secret of Nature. For when as they all affirm with one conse11t that the sea runueth there from east to west, as swiftly as if it 'vere a ryver falling from high mountaynes, I thought it not goode to let such matter slipp untouched. The which, while I consider I am drawn into no small ambyguetie and doul)t, whyther those waters have theii· course which flowe with so continual a tract in the circuite from the easte, as though they fledde to the weste never to retourne, and yet neyther the weste thereby any whit more (ylled nor the east emptied. If we say that they fall to their centre (as in the nature of heavier things) and assign the equinoctial hyll to be the centre (as some affirme), what centre shall we appoint to be able to receive so great abundance of water, or what cireumft>nmce shall be found wet. They which have searched tho::;e coasts have yet found no like reason to be here. Many think that tliere should be·certayne large strayghts or entrances in the corner of that great land which we describe to be eight times larger than Italie, and the corner of that land to he full of gulfes, whereby they suppose that "some strayghts should pass through the same lying to the weste side of the Island. of Cuba, and that the said strayghts swallowe up those waters and so conveys the same into the weste, and from thence again into the easte ocean or north seas as some think. Others will, that the Gulf of that great lande be closed up and the lande to reach far to the north iu the back side of C~1ba, so that it embrnce the north landes which th frozen sea encompasseth under the north pole, and all the lande of these coasts should joyne together as one fin:rie lande. Whereby they conjecture that these waters should be turned about by the object or resistance of that lande

so temling- toward the north, as we see tlrn watm8 turned about the ernnked baiiks of _t't'rtayne ryvers. Hut this agreeth not in all points, for they also who have i'earched the frozen sea, and savlod from thence into the weste doe likewise aflirme that those w;rth 1"ea8 Howe eontimrnlly toward the weste although nothing 1:10 s,,·ifth·. * * * \Vherefore it ii; not 1mlv more likelv to be tnw hut ~h;o of llP('l'ssity to he coneluded, that.between hotl1 these larnles hitherto unknown, there should he great certayue open places wherehy the waters slwuld thus continually passe from easte into the \VC8tl>, which waters I suppose to Le <lri ven about the Globe by the incessant moviug- and im11uhiio11 of the herLVens, arn1 uot to be s\\allowed up and cnst out again by the hreathing of Demo-gorgon as some have imagined, because they see the seas increase and deen:atle, flowe and reflowe.
The :·mme writer continues at a later date: Let us uow therefore speake some,vliat again of the later news anrl opinion as con(·erni.ng- the Hwift course of the sea towanl t11e west(< about the Coast of Paria. So it is therefore that Andrea::; Moralis, the pilot, and Ouidas (of whom we lun-e 1rnule mentiou before) repayred to me at my house in the time of Matrite. As \Ve met thus together tliere aroHe a c.'.ontention between them two as cou('erning thiH course of tbe oeean. They both agree that tlwse lawfos and n'g-ions pertayning to the Dominion of Castile, tlo with one continualo tract and perpetual bond embrace as one whole finne lamle or continent all the mayne lande lying to tlie north of Cuba awl the other islarnls, being ah;o northwest from both Cuba and Hispaniola. Yet as touching the course of the waters they n1ry iu opinion; for Andrea:,; will, that his violent course of the water he received i11to the lappe of the supposed continent, whieh henueth RO much and extendeth so farre toward the uorth, as we liave said, and that by the ol)ject or rm;istauce of the lande so hendiug awl crooking the wate1· as it were, rehouude iu emnpasse and by the force thereof be driven about the north tiidf' of Cuha amlthe other islands excluded outside the cirde .ea11ed Tropicus Cancri, where the largeness of the sea may receive the waters falling from the narrow streams and thereby represse tlint inordinate course by re<Json that the sea is there very large aud gn·at.

It is eertainly most remarkable, when we consider how imperfect was their knowledge of the form or extent of the continent, that their view~ should have been so near the truth. The Gulf of l\fexico was not discoYered until 1517, and explored the year after, when the current on the \Vestern ::1ide of the Straits of Yucatan must have beeu found. Ocampo, in circumnavigating Cuba, judging from experiences of the present day, cunl\1 have found only the tidal currents in the vicinity of Cape San Antonio. The current in the passages in the eastern Caribbean was known to be strong and westerly, and 011 the Honduras coast the same. Alaminrn; and Ponce de Leon had found the current in the Straits of Florida, and evidently some of the speculators determined that the laud was continuous and in some way the two parts of the flowing stream of water were connected. Antonio de Alaminos was without doubt the most experienced navigator and pilot in the 'Vest Indian waters. He had been chief pilot with Columbus 011 his last voyage, hatl been with Ponce de Leon around and

among the lfahamas and along the coast of I·'lmida from St. Augustine to Tortugas, ·and had ero;;;;t,d and recrosseu the stream several tim~s. He had afterwanls heen witl1 C01·<lova and Grijaha exploring the coast of Yucatan aml the Gulf of }lexico. He was familiar with the fact that there was a passage uorth of Cnha from tlw Gulf to the Ocem1, hut beyond the Straits to thu 1101·thwanl \Va8 unknown tn him. Ile tl1ought, hmvever, as Henera :->ay:-;, "'that the~m mighty eurrent:-5 ought to empty i\Omewhere into au open :-;pace." Upon fitting out the expedition for the couqnest of nfoxico, Corte;.i; gave the chief command of the fleet to Alamiuos, and wheu, later, it was thought necessary to send di;:-;patches arn1 pre::-;eut::; to Spain, he was given the fastest vessel to 1.'.nl'l'y the Envoys. Instructions were given him to hold his course north of Cuba and pass into the Atlantic through the Straits of Florida, llot touehiug at any port or island in the \Vest Indies. Probably this route was sugge8ted to ,Cortez by Alaminot> as being most favorable for a quiek passage, arnl onu by which he would be sure to avoid a chance meeting with an enemy either of his own or of a foreign country. rrhe vessel sailed from Yera Cruz July 2G, 15l:J, and afteJt disobeying his instructions by making a ::;top at the port of l\farien on the north side of Cuba, Alamiuos pa:s::;ed through ~he Straitti of Florida and reached Spairi" iu safety. It is of course doubtful liow far he followed the Gulf Stream, but it is probable that he did so well up the coast toward Cape Hatteras. His voyage changed the cour8e of navigation from the West Indian ports and contrilmted largely toward the growth of Havana. This port soon became the n:wlezvou:,; of the vV est Indian trading fleet, the distributing point of goods from Europe, and the starting port for the return home. During the half century following the remarkable voyage of Alaminos, there \Vere expedition:-; without number to the west Indies aml the mainland, and while there are minute and detailed descriptions of the land, products, and people, yet scarcely anything is said of the sea currents. Sir Humphrey Gilbert, writing before 1576, says t11at all the waters of the ocean "nm hy nature eircularly from east to west, following the diurnal motions of the Primum ~Io bile." He traces the motion of tho waters from tho south of Africa and tmys that from there it strikes over to Ame1·ica. Not fiw1ing free passage "it runs all along the eastern coast of that continent

·181

northward as far as Cape Freddo, being the farthest known place of the same continent toward the north, which is about 4,800 foague:-;." He thinks that even if'this cunent has not been trace(l all along the ('.Oa'"'t of America, "still it must exi8t either in uppermo8t or the nethermost pmt of the sea." For the reason that thi8 current mn8t have n free passage somewhere Gilbert says "it must either flow around the north of America into the South Sea or .it must needs strike over upon the coa:,;t:-; of Ice1arnl, Xorway, and Fim11ark." He adopts the first of the altcruatives, as he is anxious to prove the existence of the Northwest Passage. In the journal of his fast voyage h(:' mentions that in 50° north latitude they saw ice being earried to the r-onthward, and so conjectured that a current must he setting in that direction. Jn 1579 and again in 1583 he made two unsucces:,;ful attempts to establish colonies on the east coast of the present Uuitetl State::;, and it is cuifou8 to see how great was the influence of the Gulf Stream, CYWl at that time, in directing rnwigation. In considering the advisability of taking the southern passage from England or the more direct but more difficult northern one, he says, "by what way to shape our course, either from the soutl1 nolihward, or from the north southward. The firi-1t course, that is, beginning south, without all contraversie was the likeliest wherein WO are U.S1'Ul'ed to have Cornmouitie of the currents, which from the Cape of Florida setteth northward, arnl ·would have furthered greatly our navigation, discovering, from the foresaid cape toward Cape Breton and all these land:,; lying to the north." The adnu1tag(~ of being able to provi8ion the vessel <tt the Banks of N ewfoun<llaud led them to decide upon the northern route ''although coutmriety of currents descending from the Cape of Florida into Cape Breton and Cape Hace would fall out to be great and irresistible impediments unto our further proceeding for that year, a,ud compel us to winter in those northern reg·ion::1." The records of the voyages of Martin 1''robishcr are of great interest a15 showing the gra.dual exten:-;ini1 of knowledge on the subject of nt'.ean currents. He crosi:led the northern Atlantic six timl'S during the years 1!J7G'77-'78. In the account of his third voyage he says:

Sa)'ling toward the northwest parts of Ireland we mette with a great current from out the southwest, which carried UR [hy -0ur reckoning] one point toward the northeastward of our said

com·se, which eurrent seemed to us to continue itself toward Nor'Way nnd othQr of tlte northe:ist parts of the world, 'vherehy we may lw imlun~tl tn believe that thi8 is the same which th~ Portugese lllette at Capo de Huong Speranza [Cape of Good Hope], wh<>re, stri<'king over from thence to the Straits of Magellan and tiw1i11g no pa:;;;age there for the narrowness of the sayde Straits, rmmeth along-ue to the great Bay of Mexico, where also having a let of lawl it is forced to strike back again toward the northeast, as we 11ot only here but in another place also further northward hy goode experience this year have found. How the currents returned to the Cape of Good Hope from the "northe:u;t parts of the world'' ii::\ not stated, hut the general course of the Atlantfo system is vl.:'ry fairly lairl out. About this tirne t~iern appearetl the theory in "La Cosmographie" that the currents i11 the Strait:-; of Florida were caused by the rivers emptying into the Gulf of .l\Iexico, aml this theory has been held by writers at much later dates. In 1596 it is recorded by D. Layfield, chaplain of the Earl of N ortlmmberlaml, that between Bermuda and the Azores they thought they nlJ::>eL'Ve(l a curreut, but shortly before arriving at. the latter they were sure of a current setting southward. The next expedition to that of Gilbert, for 8ettling Virginia and North Carolina, was under Captains Amadas and Barlow. They took the southern pm;snge, as did also all of those under Haleigh. Smrw of these left the Caribbean east of Cuba, and others continued to the westward and passed through the Straits of Yucatan and Florida. Iu 1590 .John ·white, who had been Governor of the colony at Roanoke, referring to the portion of the voyage from Florida Keys to Virginia, i:iar:-i: "\Ve lost sight of the coast and stood to sea for to gaine the helpe of tho cmTent 1 which ruuneth much swifter farre off than in sight of the coast, for from the Cape of Florida to Virginia, all along the shore, are none but eddie currents ;;et ting to the south and southwest." This is the first instance in which thero i;; indicated a knowledge of an approximate position of the ~lXis of the Stream. In 1606 an observation is recorded by Lescabot, which is evidently a meeting of the Litbr<ulor au(l Gulf Stream currents. He noticed that while in latitude 45° and "six times 20 leagues to the eastward of the Banks

He attrihutes this to the ice from the north which 1~omes fion.ting "d11w11 frmn the eoast and :-;ea adjoiuiug to Newfuuu<llaud and Labrador, whieh is brought thitlier by the sea in her natural motiou." The infineuee of tJie Gulf 8tream in the colonization of North Amffirn ·was about tliis time very great. In I GOG the EnpJisli 1liYirled thf·ir pos:sessi01rn into two }H\rts, the northern part of Virg·inia (X ew Eugland and vieinity) "'a.s one, aud the present Korth Carolina :irnl (ihesapeake Bay i·eg-ion tlw otlwr, arnl for eaeh a l'Ompan.Y was ('stnhlished nnd <>ommissioued by the King-. The route us1~<l in going to the fin.;t was tliat trit,d in 1 G02 hy Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold, crossing· tlw A tlantie 011 about the forti(~th pamllel, while the southern expeditions held the old pas,;age through the trades and Carihhean. The Dutch vt>ssels hound to X ew York adopted the We~t Indian route, so that Na11tucket really heca11w the dividiug line of travel, and a difference in destination of a degree iu latitude necessitated a difference of thirty degrees in route. This seems only to he accounted for by the real or imaginary assistance of the winds and currents in one and the impediment of the Stream in the other. After the E11g·lisl1 and Dutcl1 settlements became firmly established m1d erossing the Atlautic a common thi11g, the personal experience of navigators was no Ionw'r tlioug·ht to be of sufficient importance to print, and the time had not yet arriYed for adopting a plan of collecting ilhip's journals and puhlishing- such nautical information from them as would be of value to otheri'i. Tbe writers on the subject, however, must have had access to these journals and corrected and improved their ideas on the subject of currents, and in the latter half of this century many works on hydrography appeared. In 1650 Varenius gave the most complete description of currents n'hich had b&en issued up to this time. He classified them into perpetual and periodical, special and general. The system of which the Gulf Stream forms a part he placed as a perpetual special motion of the sea, and desrribes it as a gigantic Stream beginning at the eastern Capes of Brazil, flowing from

south to north and ending toward Florida. He adds, "a similar current from s<.mth t() north is observed along the Philippine Islands and toward Japan." He also wrote that "some Copernicans, as for instance Keppler, pretend that ~tl,.;o tlrn mcwement of our globe contributes not a little toward it" (tlw cmn~uts), "because the water, not being adherent to the earth but ouly in a loo:-;e cont~Lct with it, cannot follow the quickness of its motion toward tlw east, hut is left behind toward the west, so that the sea <loes not move frum one part to the other, but on the contrary it is the earth which quits or leases the parts of the 8ea, one after the other." In 1GG3 Isaac Vos1Jins wrote a work entirely devoted to the motion of wind and ;;ea, aivl in it particularly describes most of the currents knowD in the present day. He says: \Vith the general eqnato1·ial current, ·the waters run toward Brazil, along- Gunurn, and tmter the Gulf of Mexico. From there, tumiug oblique]~·, tliey pass rapidly through the Straits of Bahama. ( )n tho one si1le the:· bathe the coasts of Florida and Virginia and the <:>11tire shnn~ of 'Korth America, and on the other side they run din·<"tly ea:;t until they reach the opposite shores of Europe and Afril'a; from thern·e they run again to the south and join the first 111m·cmeut to the west, perpetually turning in this manner circuitously.

He cmpha;-;izes this by saying that "a ship without saill-1 and sailors
mig·ht be eonvcyccl ::ioldy by the force of the currents from the Canary blau<ls to Brazil arnl l\lexico, coming back from there by way of the Flori<la, Stream tmvard Europe on a l'Oute some 4,000 German miles in length.') Vossius's theory as to the cause of the ocean circulation was that the heat of the tropical sun attracted the ocean and at the same time increasefl its hulk and formed, as it Wl:'re, a long mouutain of water, "to which the vessels ewm have some difficulty in ascending when they sail toward the line." He concluded that the sun carried this mountain of water toward the ~onth American shore, where it broke and ran along the coasts. A French hydrogmpher, George Fournier, some years later propournfod a theory almost the opposite. It was that the sun evaporated enough water in the tropics to make a deep valley, and therefore the water from the poles was fqrced to run toward the equator along the coast of Africa to replace the lo"t wa.ter. He thought that the depression always

ran before or with the sun and the arriving polar water behinJ the sun an<l the rotatory system of currents was thus produN·d. In 1678 Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit, gave to the world in his "1\1 uudus Subterraneus," the first published chart showing thf' system of oel'an circulation and the Gulf Stream (Illustration No. 31).. HP says of th:' cam1es of the Gulf Stream: This motion touches many things, whether partly from the general motion of the trade winds agaimit the opposing sl1ores of that region and thence again refleetecl, which they call the Sailor's Current, or from wind-storms, or finally from the flow and the reflow caused by the 111.oon's force. He was, however, a strong believer in i-mhmarine aeysses as the caut;e of vortices awl i.;peciaJ currents. In 1685 a German named Hap1wlim published another chart of Ocean currents (illustration Ko. 32) quite similar to Kircher's. In his work he says: The general motion of the Ocean goes from east to west, and it is most obvious in the torrid zone. The sun is the eause of this general course of the sea as well aR of the trade winds. The particular motions of the sea are of two kirn1s, one 011 a Rtraight lino awl the other with a circulating or whirling movement. Of those which run in a straight line some are constant, regular, and perpetual the whole year through. Some show themseln~s only at times and change eYen in direction, are irregular, depending much on the direction of the wind. In the Atlantic from the Brazilian Cape of St. Augustine toward the Antilles and Florida is ::i constant and perpetual course of the Rea from the south to north. About this time the question began to bt> agitated in the minds of scientists as to hovY the strange fruits awl wood8 were <lepoHited on the shores of Ireland, Scotlaml, aml other northern lauds. The molucca bean was frequently found there, and the fact was thought to be proof of either a northeast or northwest passage to the East Indies. In 1696 Dr. Hans Sloan proved that these beans came from ,Jamaica. He says:

It is very easy to conceive that, growing in J amaiea, and ha Ying got to sea by the rivers, they may he carried by the 1vimls and by the current which is forced through the Gulf of Florida,
going there constantly east into the North American St:·a; hut how they should come the rest of their voyage I can not tell, unless it

be thought rea,.;onabl(~ that the beans, being brought north by the current from th(· ( iulf of Florida, are put into the >vesterly ·winds' way, and may lw supposed hy this means at last to arriYe at Scotland. This is pxaetly tlw opinion of many people at the present day.

In 1 702 ancl agaill in 1 7i0 tlw fa<'t was stated that the Gulf Stream ran the stro11gest in rlH:· titraits of Florida during strong northerly winds, mid as an explanation of this phenomenon Professor Lentl thought that it eoulcl only he ac<·ounteJ for liy the supposition that during the north winds in the chamwl in the Gulf ()f }lexicn they were blowing from a more northwesterly
<iiret·tiou, :ma in this way pushed the \vatern of the Gulf into the 8trait:,;

aud :::o fon·(;tl thent throuµ-h the latter with incre::u:;ed velocity. The French routt' from Loui,.;iana to Euro1w followed the Gulf Sti·eam along the Korth Atlantic co:1i't tmrnr<l the Banks of N"ewfounrlland, differing considerably fror11 the wore southern route taken by the Spaniards, but while adopting this mo,.;t ex11editious track they went to the other extreme in sailing from tlieir Gulf to their West Indian po:;;sessious. They followed tl1t> Stream well up towanl th<· Uram! Banks, then :::outh to the trade winds aud west to their }l<fft. Up to thi,.; time, with thf' exception of Kircher and Happelius iu 1679 and Hi8:\ there Reem:'> to haYP been no attempt to irnlicate the Gulf Stream upon the eharts, and eYen tl1ese were more for scientific interest tlia11 for t1w practicaJ benefit of mariners. One chart publisheil iu 1630 Ly the Earl of l:\orthnmherland gave the words "(jorrento verso Greco," placed about half a 1legr(·e from Cape Ifattera"; hut with this exception up to the first lwlf of tlH· ('iglitt,entli <'~ntnry, cliart~ generally unl:y show au inscription l 1etwc·en ( :uh:i awl Florida, "(j:urnlis Bahama Yersuff Septentrionem selllper tluit," nr its tra11slatiou into othnr languages.

OULF STREAM LVVESTia.tTIOYS FROM THE TIME OF FRANKLIN TO THOSE MADE Bl'
THE U.S. COAST SURVEY.

How long the American fishermen ha<l been acquainted with the secret of the Gulf Stream's peculiarities before it was brought to the notice of Franklin it is impossible to state. They kept the secret, howeYer, until, as F'ranklin saysAhout the year 1769 or 1770, there was an application by the Board of CustomR at Boston to the Lords of the Treasury at London, emnplaining that the p:wkets between Falmouth nnd New York were generally a fortnight longer in their passage than the merchant ships between London an<l Hhode Island, and proposing instmul of N mv York that for the future they should be ordered to Newport. Being then concerned in the management of the American PostOffice, I lmppen.ed to be commlted on the occasion, and it appearing stra11ge to me that there should be such a difference, especially when the merchant ships were generally deeper laden and more weakly manned than the packets, and had from London the whole leni-,>ih of the river and channel to run before they left the land of England, while the packets had only to go from Falmouth, I could not hut think the fact misunderstood or misrepresented. 'l'here happened then to be in London a Nantucket sea captain of my acquaintance, to whom I communicated the affair. He told me he believed the fact to be true, but the difference was owing to this, that the Rhode Island captains were acquainted with the Gulf Stream, while those of the English packets were· not. "We are 'vell acquainted with that stream, because in our pursuit of whales, which keep near the sides of it but are not met with in it, we run along the side and frequently cross it to change our side; and in crossing it have sometimes met and spoke with those packets who were in the middle of it and stemming it. We have informed them that they were stemming a cunent that was against them to the value of 3 miles an hour and advised them to cross it, but they were too w ise to be counclled by simple American fishermen

THE- GULF STR[AM

When the winds are light," he added, "they are carried back by the current more than they are forwarcle<l hy the wind, and if t11e wind be good the subtraction of 70 miles a day from their counie is of some importance." I then observed that it was a pity tlrnt no notice was taken upon the charts, and requested him to mak1 it out for me, whid1 he readily complied with, a(Iaing directions for a n1iding it in sailing from Europe to North America. I procured it to lw engTan·d by order from the General Post-Office 011 the old chart of the Atlantic, at Mount & Pa.ge'K, Towel' Hill, and copieK 'Yere sent to :Falmouth for the captains, who slighted it., howeYer, hut it has since heen printed in Frarn·e, of which edition I lH"rcto mm<·x a copy (illustration Ko. 33). Franklin's theory on the subject of tlw cause of tltt· Gulf Stream is· given in the same report. He says: This stream is probably generated by tlw great accumulation of water on the eastern coast of Ainerica between the tropics by the tralle winds which constantly blow there. It i:- kumvn that a larg·e piece of water, 10 miles broad and generally only 3 foet '1eq1, has, by a· strong wind, had its water driYeu to oue side and :-;ustai1wd so as to become 6 feet deep, while the windward sitle was laid dry. Thi8 may give 8ome idea of the quantity heaped upon the · American coast, and the reason of its running down iu a strt ·llg current through the islands into the Bay of l\I exico and from tlH·nee proceeding along the coasts and banks of N Pwfonrn11and "'lwrn it turns off towards and rum; do-wn through the \Vestern Islarnls. Franklin did not press his new chart on the notice of the English ship captains after they had once rejected it, but for the time being suppressed it, for political reasons, until the conclusion of the 'Var of Independence. In the mean time, in 1775-'76, an<l in later years, whenever he made a, Yoyagc across the Atlantic, he took observations of the surface tempernture of the ocean. He says: I find that it [the Gulf Stream] is always warmer than the _ _sea on each side of it, and that it does not sparklf' in the night. I annex hereto ~he observations made in two voyages and may possibly add ~ tlnrd. It will appear from them tha.t the thermometer may be a useful instrument to the navigator, since currents coming from the northern into sDnthern sens, will probably lle found colder than the water of those seas as the currents from southern seas into northern are apt to be warmer.

On his last voyage, in 1785, he made the first attempt in submarine temperatures at moderate depths, using a bottle up to 20 fathoms, and afterwards a cask with valves in each end. Off the Delaware, in 18 fathoms, he discovered that the water at this depth was 58°, which was 12° colder than at the surface. Although Franklin's chart of the Gulf Stream, published in London, had been rejected hy the English sh.ipmasters in 1770, it was certainly adopted by writers on hydrogmphy. The information was given to the public through these ·works, and the name Gulf Stream came into general use. The importance, too, of gaining all possible information about this mighty rinr seem·; to have been realized at this time, and consequently nearly all government vessels were instructed to observe its phenomenon whenever opportunity offered. Among the most prominent investigators was Dr. Charles Blagden, of the Royal Army, while with the British fleet going to and in the American waters in 1776-'77. He observed the temperature in crOBBing the stream off Cape Fear, aud also off the Chesapeake, communicating his results to the Royal Society, in 1 781, in a letter urging the essential advantage to be derived by the use of the thermometer. These two, Franklin and Blagden, \Vere the first to demonstrate the usefulness of that instrument, and, since the time of Alaminos, no discovery of like importance had heen made which bore so directly on the question of utilizing this great river to the purposes of man's welfare. Soon after Franklin's and Blagden's discoveries, Mr. Pownall, formerly Governor of Massaclmsetts, published in 1787 a large chart and a volume on Hy(lranlic and Nautical Observations on the Currents of the Atlantic Oc<,,;:m. On this chart the Gulf Stream is laid down closely approximating to that of Franklin's (illustration No. 34). He also gives the correct com-se or traek8 whieh vessels should take; that to Boston "along and beyond the northern edge of the Gulf Stream." To Virginia and Carolina he urged one iu about latitude 35° instead of running down to 20°, as was usual. Franklin on his last voyage was accompanied by a nephew, Col. Jonathan 'Villiams, who was of great assistance in the thennometrical observations and record of results. Such interest was awakened in the mind of Williams that he was led to continue the experiments begun by his unale.

In a memoir read before the American Philosophical Soeiety in 1790 he confirmed Dr. Franklin's account of the temperatnrt> of the Rtrearn, anrl also advanced the theory that hanks, shoals, and coasts might ht; cliseon~re<l by the use of the thermometer. "\Villiams pubfo1hed a work in 1 7:!~1 on Thermometrical Navigation, containing a chart of the Gulf Stream (illustration Ko. 3i)) and the temperature of the water on adjacent banks. Ill 1800 a paper 'vas read by Capt. "\Villiam Strickland on the use of the thermometer in navigation. In his voyages across the Atlantic he had kept daily and sometimes hourly oh.;ervations of surface temperature, in order to test the theory of Colmwl "\Villiams. His investigation was valuable from the discovery of the warm northeasterly extension of the Gulf Stream, for lie fournl i11 lntitnffo 46° 47' north and longitude 38° 35' west, a temperature of (:)8°. He i-;ays, of this northeast extension, "it probably continues in about a northeast direction entirely across the Atlantic till it ultimately strikes the coasts of Ireland and the Hebrides, after having lost, in its long course in these northern latitmles, much of its heat, and at last being reduced to the temperature of the sea through which it flows." He recommended the employment of \'e8sehi to <lefine the limits of this northern branch behn·en lntitudes 47° arnl G0° by the use of the thermometer. Although others hefon· Striekl:1ml had noticed floating wee<lR and American wood,;; in these northern lol'alitit>,-, and even CarJot had remarked upon the fact of the beer in the hold nf his ,·esr,;el getting warm, thus surmising a warm current, yN 110 mw seems up to tl1is time to ha.ve declared its existence a fact, based upon actual experiuncc aud scientific observation. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the subject of ocean cmrents was a favorite one for investigati(ln by the navigator ~tnd hydrog'rapher. The thermometer wai:; the accepted instru1nent in the research, aw] by the chronometer, which was becoming of greater n1lue and mor<> g"f>llerally used, the difference between the dead reckonii1g and the olisern;tl positio11s could be determinecl with greater accuracy. As we shall i-mP latPJ', from the time of Fmnklin and Blagden, for mm·(~ than a century, all the investigation of ocean currents was based solely upon these two i11;;trnments, the thermometer and the chronometer, and upon, what in effect i:; the same as the latter, the drift of bottles. In the year 1802 the first bottle

experiments seem to have been inaugurated, the English ship Rainbow throwing overboard several in the North Atlantic, and at intervals these experinwnt8 have lwen continued in all parts of the world up to the p1·esent day. A remarkable tlwrmometrical voyage was made in 1810 by tlw packet Eliza, from Halifax to Engfand. It was found that in the midst of the warm water of the stream there existed patches of cool water of 10° to 15° lower teir11wratnre than the surrounding sea, and having a diameter of over :WO miles. They were thought to have been caused by icebergs and Hoe,; which had enkred and been melted in tho Gulf Stream. In 1811 awl 1812, ::-lir Philip Broke made a great number of observations iu the Gulf Htream aud described its characteristics. Among other things he states "that beyond the southern boun<lary of the stream, from the Azores toward Bermuda arnl tl1e Bahamas, there is a strong set to the southwest or westsoutlnn~,_,t, that when this emrntercurrent arrives opposite the outfall of the Florida or Gulf Stream it turns to the southeast along the outer side of the Bahama "'\rdiipelago, receidng into its body a large offset of the Gulf Stn·am which rcmnds the Matanilla Bank." Another alleged characteristic of the current hegan to app{·ai· in the nautical works of the early part of the century: '·That easterly winds press the current toward tho American coast, and that the consequences of this pressure are that the breadth of the Stream aud its distance from the shore iH diminished and its velocitv ., increased, and that in the contrary, winds which blow from the coast produce contrary effects." Capt . .Tohn Hamilton gave to the American Philosophical Society, in 1825, the obsen·ations made by him during twenty-8ix voyages to and from Europe. They consist of temperature of air and water, cmTent of the Gulf Stream for different months, average temperature of the water on sourn1iugs off the Delaware, Georges Bank, and on the coast of Ireland. Sornt· of the eoneluRions arrived at by Captain Hamilton were of great vnhw at the tirnt·. He decided that it was impossible to define thri limits of the current of the Gulf Stream, owing to the variable influence of the wind ; that after it passes the Grand Bank the main Stream proceeds to the soutJnnml, while :-;pn·rnl ramifications, generally not very strong, branch off to the northeast and from that to the east, with countercurrents in the

iutermBdiate spaces; that by the frequent use of the thermometer the navigator mfly alwayti discern where he touches the Gulf Stream, and take advantage of its current or avoid its influence. He further remarks: I was for a long time almost induced to conclude that some of these cun-1mtf.l, particularly those \vhich prevail between the coast of Newfoundland and Europe, were periodically running half the time in 011e direction and half the time in the other, and the foregoing tables seem to strengthen thi.-; conclusion, except the countercuuents near the edge of the stream. \Vheu the current from the northward prevailed to any great extent, a set in the opposite direction near the bank of K e1vfoundland and on the west coast of Ireland were always observed. The celebrated German, A. vo11 Humbo~dt, pu1Jlished iu 1814 a valuable description of the Gulf Stream, the result of his own ob;-;ernltiom; i11 crossing it no less than sixteen times, as well as of all the inforination he could collect from the journals of na~·igators wlu_) had been posse13sed of th(· necessary means for exact astronomical observations at sea. He deci<lcd tlta.t the Gulf Stream was not the same in all season:,; of the year, but that ihi force arnl dire-dion Jepended to a large extent upon the change,,; in the tnufo winds, and also, that the general torpidity of the ice iu the Aretic in the winter, and 'its melting in the summer, influenced it. Regarding the directions of ocean currentl'I he says: Considering the velocity of the fluid elements which, in different latitudes, in consequence of the earth's rotation, i~ different, one should he tempt.eel to think that every current from south tc 1 north ought to have at the same time a tenclency to the ea,_t, and, vice versa, a current from north to south a tendency to the west. He published ~ chart of the Gulf Stream in which he depicteil it:-; changeable limits as he believed they were. During the next few years many navigators cruised in and examinrnl the Gulf Stream, more particularly however in the vicinity of the route between Halifax and Bermuda. One of them in May, 1821, in about 64° west longitude remarked the fact that he observed a vein of cool water of a temperature of 54° between 72° and 73°, which seems to he the fir~t timn this phenomenon was noticed.

He lwlieved that the \Vanner water, though of similar 8pel'ific gTaYity was, in this case, the most dense, and that sea water follmn;.J the same law as fresh water 1vith regarJ to extreme of deusity, being· :i fow <legTees ahnve its freezing temperature. To this he attributed the fact tliat the polar ke in these waters could not extend far to the southward, arnl I I umholllt adopted the same. The latter says: "In those regicius which are warmed hy a current from the southwest, navigation iH uninterrupktl even in tlw n1idst of the strongest winter." Col. E. Sabirw, in l>:l:22 was a member of an expedition organized for the }JUI]lOse of making experiments to determine the figure of the earth. Sailing· from England he went to ~fa.deira and to Sierra Leone, tLrough the Caribbean and the Straits of Florida to Kew York and thence to England, thus making the complete circuit of the warm Atlantic currents. In his ohi,;ervatio11s on ocean temperatures he found in the eastern Atlantic a Lody of water very much warmer than normal, and attributed this fact to .au unusual elevation of the Gulf of .Mexico and the Caribbean, due to abnormally strong tmd.e -..vimlB. The weather was so unusual in the southern parts of Great B1-jtain and in Fi:,~mce as to have excited general remark, as "most extraordinary hot, damp, stormy, and oppressive," and that in November and Decmnber p;a1e8 from the west and southwest were almost without intermission. 'Ve here see, not so much the dii·ect influence of the warm water of the stream on the climate of England and France as the effect of the westerly and soutlnvesterly gales. · During the first quarter of this century the British admiralty-office had col1ceted a g-reat quantity of material on the subject of ocean currents and meteorology, most of which had never become known to the public. Mr. ,James Rennell, who had dernted his life to the subject of geography, and pnrtif'ularl:Y to ocean (·urrnnts, was given the task of compiling and collecting the data. He C'.Ombined the i·esults on large charts of the ocean whfoh were the admiration of the day, and also wrote a volume on "An investigatiou of the 8uhjoct ()f the currents of the Atlantic Ocean." He died, however, before its entire completion, but two years later (1832) it was published by

In the charts were embodied tlw general rourses of the cm~reuts with the limit8 of variations, the <lirediom; of the winds, accompanjed by the date of observation, the depth awl tempernturc of tliu sea, aud some of the tracks of the vessels making 8pecially important seieutific observations. Major Rennell adopted Dr. Franklin's theory a::> to the principal cau::>e of ocean currents and divided them juto two elas:,;e,,;: Drift currents, earrned by the effect of constant or long-continued wimls on the surface uf the wat<'r, and stream currents, which are formed by the ac.cuiUulation of water by the (lrift current meeting an obstacle and thrown sidewa.n; or out of it,.; n,.;ual course. The Gulf Stream he placed in the latter dass, hut eoudmled that it turned south toward the Azores and was lost, while he considered the movement of water in the northern part of the North Atlantic a (lrift current impelled by the prevailing westerly wind:,;, and these abn were the cause of the African current. From his investigations he pronounced it to be abundantly pro,·e<l(1) That there existed a change in the position and breadth of tlH' column of warm water from time to time. (2) That tlw breadth varied at times in the proportion of more than two to one. (3) rrhat these changes had been observed sometimes to be rnry su~l11en-:as, for instance, it had once been found to be 140 miles in width, and ten weeks later at the same spot to be 320 miles broad. ( 4) That these changes did not follow any regular course of season, ·for it was 320 miles wide in May, 1820, and only 186 miles in l\Iay, 1821, nearly at the same place. (5) That on the northern side of the stream the body of warm water is more permanent than to the south, and also that the warmest water is found to the north, as if indicating the stl'Ongest part of the stream there. (fi) That the existence of warm water does not necessarily indicate tho presence of the stream, but must be regarded a:-; an overflowing or deposit of superabundant water, or even form a counter current. (7) That there were without doubt veins of colder water within the body of warm current.

He poiuted out the fact, and, indeed, it exists at the present day, that the position of the Htream east of Cape Hatteras is but imperfectly known, and that notwith::;tanding the great number of ob,;ervatiom; at his disposal, a want of sy::;tem in their collection, the isolated and unconnected facts obrnine<l by different ob::>e1Ters at (liffereut"1:leasoni'.\, and errors in determining 1ongitw1e made it impossible at that time to t-itate where the borders of the Stream should be placed. The observations discussed hy .Major Rennell were of the surface temperature, and we shall 8ee later how great is the influence of the wiucl in spreading- the warm water of the Stream without ('Hrrying the eurreut with it. Hi8 work was the most valuable coUection of re::;ults that had heen made, and while some of his conclusions have since betn1 tlispmverl, it is a remarkable fact that he should have arrived at so near tlw truth in many of them. An index of his fmrrents is shown iu illustration No. 3G.

Isolated observations were made, but no one took the trouble to combine thern int" average results. Reunell's theory of the d(~vat ion of the Gulf of ~lexin> and the Caribbean Sea was much shaken b~- Arago, who called attention to the observations made to ascertain the differences of level of the two oceans at the hthmus of P~nama. Triaugu1ation waH carried from Chagres to Panama, and a report made that the Atlantic might be from 3 to 5 feet lower than the Pacific.* About thii'.' tirm~ :i line of levels was carried across Florida from St. Mary'::i Hiver to Apaladiee Bay, with n difference of 7 ! inches, the latter hcinµ- the highest. It was thought, however, to be due to error of observationH rather than to difference of level. A.rngo believed "that with respect to currenbi the rotation of the earth <!nµ:ht prineipally to he taken into view, and that this, together with the cooling aiHl warming of the water in tho north aud south, is the main cause of their more rapid or slower deviation and pr ogress toward the east or

Ho remarks, too, that "we ought to apply to the ocean the same theory which has already afforded a satisfactory explanation to the trade wind,,; if we will decipher the question of eurreut,,;." During the fin;t half of the century hottfo experiments \n·re nurnerouR.

Auother chart, indirectly relating to rwe:lll currents, wa.s published by )fr. ·w. C. Redfield. It ga...-e the positi011s of ie<·bergs and fields observed by British and American m1vigators in the Atlanti« from the year 1832 to 1844. Orer one hundred of them werl' rnnrk('d 011 thir-; dmrt, and the fiwt observed that they sometimes entered the snppo;;(·<l limits of the Gulf Stream, thus showing the existeuce of an m1tlercmn~nt. In 1838 and 1840 a scientific mission was sent out by the King of France, under the directiol'l of Pau1 Gaimard, to northwestern Europn. Among other subjects they observecl the depth and temperature of the oce:m, and concluded that "a broad current sets through the uortheru Atlantic in a NNE. direction toward the coasts of Great Britain and, passing between the Faroe and Shetland Islands, runs along the coast of Scandinavia as far as North Cape, from which it tm'lls toward Cherry Islands and Spitzbergen." The winter of 1845-'46 in England, and in fact in all of western Europe, was very abnormal. The weather was exc.;eptionall y mild, being 8 degrees ahove the average, and was accompanied by much rain and high southwesterly gales, similar to the winter of 1821-'22, when Colonel Sabine had observea an exceptional extension of the warm water of the Gulf Stream toward the shores of Europe. Struck by the similarity of "\.Yeather, Colonel Sabine endeavored. to discover if the same conditions of oeean tern.perature prevailed, but although hundreds of vessels crossed and recrossed this part of the ocean he could find none on which observations had been taken. He thought it reasonable to believe that tluough a course of years there might be a difference between the usual and extreme initial velocities, and conseque-ntly in some years, as 1776, 1821, and j)erhaps 1845, it might reach the shores of Europe. He thought, too, that it would he of the greatest practical value for Emope to be infonned in advance of the yearly

His idea was that ship:-; might observe its elevation in the Gulf of )fexico and StraitR of Florida;· and that they, sailing fa:-;ter than the flow, migl1t urnke the changes known in England in advance of the arrival of the climate-influencing warm water. After the <leath of Major Rennell the first renewed attempt to take up the ta:-;k of collecting data on ocean meteorology was made by Lieut. .M. F. l\Iaury, U.S. N. While he was collecting, however, the u. S. Coast Survey, under Prof. A. D. Baehe, began, in 1844, a systematic investigation, which continued with greater or lesser regularity until 1860. Before describing the latter, however, we will consider the labors of Lieutenant Maury and other:-; up to the outbreak of the civil war. Lieutenant Jfaury, while Superi11te11de11t of the U.S. Naval Observatory, had collected all the log-books of vessels between the years 1840 and 1850, and averaging the data, gave to the public the results in a series of wind and current charts aml 8ailing directions. After the first edition was published, he proposed a general Maritime Con~ ference for devi~·ling a uniform system of observations at sea, an<l the meeting was held at Brussels in 1853. A plan of obserYatiorn; was adopted and the co-operation of nearly every nation assured. As a re8nlt, a rnas8 of data was collecterl from which other editions of more elaborate charts arnl sailing .directions were compiled. 'l'he charts were issued in condenHed form hy other govern111pnts, and his sailing directions, as well a:-; hfo famous \\'Ork entitled the "Physical Geography of the Sea," were translated into many languages. It is stated in some recent works that it is difficult to ascertain from Maury's writings exactly what his ideas were as to the causes of the great ncea11 currents. He says in "Physical Geography of the Sea:"

But thev [modern investigations] seem to encourage the opinion that tl1e Stream, as well as all constant currents of the sea, are dlw mainty to the constant difference produced hy temperature a!Hl :-;altue:-;:-; in the specific gravity of the water in certain parts of the ocean. Such difference of Rpecific gravity is inconsistent :with nqneous equilibrium, and to maintain this equilibrium these great currents are set in motion. The agents which derange equilibrium in the waters of tlH~ sea, l,y altering the specific gravity, reach from the equator to the poles, and in these operatioJ1s they are as

His belief was, then, iu effect that differences of density caused the main cmTents, and that thi11 might be modified by winds, rain, barometric pressure, evaporation, and the fauna and Hora of the ocean.

\Ve have now reached the point in the history of Gulf Stream investigation where, for tho first time, can he def!cribed a systematic and extensive Pxmnination into its 8ecrets. Research had been going on for years in a, casual way, data collected >vhen chance offered, and at any point, hut under the direction of no one who had the authority to say to the observers when, where, and how they should search. The scope of the Coast Survey only contemplated an examination of the Gulf Stream in the portions af~jacent to the coa8t of the United States, but the laws have since lwen changed so as to iudude the Saxgasso Sea and the Japan Stream, a study of tlwse being considered a(hantageous to the commercial and scientific interests of this country and the world at large. In 18-!~ a report wns made hy Admiral Sir Franci:,; Beaufort urging the British Admiralty to undertake the work. The importance of' au examinntion of the great rivers emptying into the Atlantic, to whose influence the Gulf ~tream had lJeeu attributed, was suggested, and the detaihi of a. plan were given for a survey of the Stream from the Gulf of }1exico to the shores of Europe. This plan proposed the employment of three steamers and one sailing. vcsi'\el. One steamer was to remain in the Gulf of Florida for the purpose of keeping a continuous record of temperature and velocity at that point. The sailing vessel was to drift along in the axis of the Stream, while the other two steamers v·ere to operate from the axis to the edges in conjunction with the sailing vessel. When Prof A. D. Bache assumed the direction of the Coast Survey, he formn1atod a complete method of administration and included in it the systematic exploration of the Gulf Stream. The plan first adopted, based upon the knowledge of the general features of the Stream, was as follows, but it

naturally was modified by deductions and inferences from lWIY faets which were brought to light as the Survey progressed : I. To refer the observations to a medial li1w or axis, 011 each sid1· of which it would be more or less similar in itf' temperatures, and t\l nm "ections perpendicular to thii-; line ~tcross tht! whole withlt of tlw Stn·am.

III. To occupy positions at which the temperatures at difforrnt dPptlis would be <letermined, the frequency of whieh wonld <1e1wrnl upon th(· greater or less rapidity of the change of temperature. As regards seasons for exploratiom;, the summer was reganleil as the mm;t favorable for the greater part of the Stream, for the i:f~ason that the winter season, at which time the storms and eold rendered observation more difficult, is also the season in which the e(1uililirimn of the currents would be most disturbed by the rapid cooling of the water. Soumling in winter in stormy weather (with rope) was hardly practicable, aud the results obtained were liable to great inaccuracies. In the spring of 184fi the brig TVashington >vas 'coirnnit>Rioned and placed under the command of Lieut. C. H. Davis, U.S. N., and the following instructions were giv(m him. The first part is quoted almost in full, to show the clearness with which Professor Bache saw the details lH'ccs,;ary f( ·r such an investigation in order to establish the laws of tlw Stream in the hC'st manner with the instruments available at that time. Professor Bache says : The following questions should he examined : First. What are the limits of the Gulf Stream on this part of the coast of the United States, at the surface an<l helmv the·

Second. Are they constant or Vfl,riable, do they change with the season, with the prevalent and different winds; what is the effect of greater or less quantities of ice in the vicinity f Third.

It may and probably will turn out that there is a certain depth at which the temperature is invariable for the :-1aine position u11influeneed at least hy tieasou or by ·winds, and the asf<emhlage of thest~ points will give a line below the surface co118tant in direction awl velocity, and to detennine this will he a valuable practical result.

This current would produce a position of rest, in which if a lwiffY body attached to a light one at the smface were imnwrserl, tlie light one would drift off down the stream of the superior current. If a light body were sent down to the counter cmTent and then detached, it would i-i.se at a point up the stream of the surfaee current. A hoat might he anchored on it by attaching to it a body which would produce a considerable resistance to motion. Two boanls put together crosswise would answer the purpose well. It may be that if there is no counter current the velocity near the bottom iR so much checked as to cause a variation to be discernible in some such way. The remainder of the instructions is devoted to details of ohserYation. Lieutenant Davis made two or three trips into the Gulf Stream, and although the means of observation were tentative on this first year's work, much valuable information was obtained.

In 1846 Lieut. George l\:L Bache, U. S. K., wa;,; detailed to

the Gulf Stream innJ;,;tigation under praetically the same instructions as his predecesrmr. After a :-1ummer'::; successful work in tracing the temperature across the Stream on three sections, thi~ little vessel was overtaken by a hurricane off th~" Xorth Carolina 1~uast and Lieutenant Bache and teu, of the crew were 8wept overhoar<l lJ_r a sea and lost. The vessel managed to reaeh port almo:-;t a wre<'k arnl the observation:;, made at such a (·o:.;t in life, \Vere preserYc<l. Lieutenant Bache gave the name "Col<l '\Vall" to the rc1rnarkable chang(c in tmnpemture usually found at what i8 suppo8ed to be the inner edge of the stream, and he also confirmed the fact that there were alternation:-; of hot and cold ~vator acro:--1tl tlw ::;trenm.

They a1so called for a resurvey of the section off Cape Henry in order to connect the series of observations made in difforeut yea1·s.

Lieutenant Bache fom1d a second hranch of the Gulf Stream separated by cold ;vater, while Lieutenant Lee found more than one alternation, and the positions of tlw higlwst and lowest temperatures were different in the two years.

After the observations ahon~ mentioned and until 1853, circumstances connerted with the work of tlw Surn~y preventt·<l the prosQcution of Gulf Streani investigation, but in this year a party under Lieut. T. A. ::\I. Craven, U. S. N., on board the steamer Conriu, was directed to run four seetious aeross the Stream from Cape CanaYeral, St. Augusti1w 1 8t. Simon's Round, and Charleston, and Lieut. J. N. ~faffitt, U. S. N., on hoanl the schooner Crawford, to run the sections from Charleston, Cape Fear, and Cape Hatteras. In addition to copies of the instructions that had been sent to the former officers engaged in the work, Professor Bache also is:med. detailed inHtructions as to the special methods of prosecuting the examinations. 'l'he axis of the Stream or the point of highest temperature was to he t1·ac1?tl by zigzagR, by Lieutenant Cnweu, from Kt>y \Vest to Charleston, and afterwards as far north as the latitude of .New York, and, with tlw ex<:eption of the latter, which was urnwoidahly prevented, all the work la.id out was mnst faithfully executed. The suumliug8 takt>n hy both i~artil's wern with rope or by ~las sey's sounding machine, arnl from the depth;:; ohtainecl tlwy ,;upposed there were two 11uhmarine ridge:; running parallel to the crnu1t. The i:>oml<lings since taken with pianoforte wire have proved thii:; to ban· been an error. The temperature curves obtained this year an' of tl1e same form as those previously found farther north, and in the duplication of the Ca pl! Hatteras seet.ion it was found that the sirnilarity of cnrve and the po:;itions of tho various warm aud cold bands ·were remarkable. It was conclmled that there were alternatiom; of tempnature aeross the Gulf Stream, the cold wMer intruding and diYiding tlrn warm, making thus altemate streaks or streaim; of warm and cold water, and it was thought that the observations of Lieutenant. Maffitt, on the Charleston mid Cape Fear sections, showed a counter current where the cold streaks ·were found. That such is not ahvays the case will be shown later in discussing the ohservations of the Blake in recent years. Professor Bache also decided that "the observations of thii,; year ha,-e fully proved that in the Charleston section, and those south of it, the bawls of cold and warm water arP produced by the shape of the bottom of the sea." The progress of the explomtions up to 1853 furnished data for the construction of a dwrt nf tlw Gulf Stream from Cape Canaveral to the section off Sandy Hook, the alterna-

The cmTes limiting the various bamh were not in all eases drawn precisely t!trougl1 the points obtained on the several Hections, hut i11 no case hut one was the distance from the point actually determined aH great as the probable error in the determination of the points themselves. The lmmls appearetl to he invariable in number and position. The supposed axis of the Stream (the highest temperature) was the hest determined. The cold wall "Was the next best to that of the axis, and in the case of the other warm an<l cold hands the limits of uncertainty in their position at the point of croi'sing any section were less than half the average dfotanee between the positions in that part of the 8ection. Iu 1854 it was thought to he desirable to continue the examination of the St. Simon's and Canaveral Hections in winter for a comparison with the surnmer's w1,rk, and Lieutenant .Craven was assig·ned to the (luty. The temperatures obtained showed a remarkable dissimilarity of form from those of the summer. The thermometer at mo:;t of the positions was nearly constant from 20 to 100 or 120 fathoms, and below that depth it changed rnpidlv. At Canaveral the double division of the Stream waR shown, but the " first maximum was about 7 miles nearer the Cape than in 1853, and the secornl maximum "\Yas warmer. \Vhat would generallr, be taken by navigators as Gulf water was G5 miles from the Cape, "hut there had evidently been sonie great disturbance of temperature just before these rei';ultR were olitained.'' Later in the year Lieutenant Craven im·eRtigated the Rnntucket section, running a liue SE. hy S. from the Davis South Shoal light-Yessel and making ohsern1tions at }1hout 20-niile intervals for a distance of 230 miles. lie fonrnl the warmest \rnter at this distance, which was 40 or 50 miles fartlH·r south awl east in October, 1854, than it was in August, 1845. 1'he alternatiorn; of warm and eold water were discernible, hut, as in the case of the warme8t, th('Y were a greater distance off shore. In 1855 tl1e work of research was continued, Lieutenant Craven running a section off Cape Flori(la in l\Iity, and Lieutenant Sands along the axis of the Stream in June, aml also a section off Nantucket in October. The section off Cape Florida was completed successfully and the axis of the Stream followed as far as

Cape Lookout, but iu the attempt to fiuish the Nantucket section only the warm water of the axis was reached. In 1857 a number of interesting obserYatious wore added to tho Gulf Stream exploration. A section wa:-i run from Havana to Sand Key, Florida, the inner edge of the Stream was traced from Cape Canaveral to Cape Fear, the axis was traced from Tortuga:-; to Cape Hatteras, and a line was ruu from Hlllifax in tho <lirection o!' Bermuda. It \Ya8 unfortunate, however, that the thermometers were nnt alway>5 in working order, as many temperature observatiorn; on both tlw HaYmrn and the Halifax lines had to he discarded. During the next three year;; the work was chiefly co'nfined to investigating the temperatures acros:-; the Straits of Florida. Although the plan for the exploration of the Stream contemplated the determination of the density of the water and the direction and velocity of the currents, the actual work peiformed waH the determination of tcmpcratlll'e and depth. The existence of a polar current underlying aurl rnnning counter to the Gulf Stream was aRsumed by Professor Bache, the a,,;:mmptiun being founded mainly upon theoretical considerations, and not on actual eurrent observations. Generally the only record of enrrent was ohtainc«l by the differenee between the dead reckoning and the astronomic;d positions of the vessels, as, for example, in the reeOl'd of observations of 01w party it says: August 16.-A comparison of the afternoon with the. morning· sig·hts for chronometer Hhow a current of 5 miles ea:-itwanlly. The vessel was lying-to in the interval. The meridian obserYations showed a no1iherly current during tlie last 24 hqurs.

The thermometers were as follows: The self-registering instruments of Dr. Rutherford, of Etlinburgh, and Six, of Canterbury ; n metallic tlrnrmometer macle by Breguet, of Paris, and another by }fr. Saxton, of the Coast Snrvpy Office. Rutherford's is a minimum thermometer, the cohesion of the spirit drawing an enamel imlrx to the lowest point ruaehPtl by the coutractiou, where it iH left :i:-i the fluid expand8. To render it applicable to lloep1'\!~a. tmnppmtm'(,s it is inclosell in a gla:;::; ~lobe made ::;trong enough to with;,;tarnl mo(l(:rate pressures. In use it is iiecessary to keep the tnhe horizontal, which i,.; not ahvay:; pos:-;ihle. In u:-;ing rope, too, for lowering, the centrifugal motion caused hy the twisting or untwisting of the rope prevents accuraey or certainty of registration. Six's thermometer is composed of a bent tube of glass, one of the brancheR terminating in a large expansion to form a cylindrical chamber arnl the other only i:;ligl1tly en1argpd at the end. The lower part of the tube contains mercury, which partly fills both branches on either side of the bend. 'l'he upper part of each branch, including the chambers, is filled with highly rectifiell spirits of wine. A rise or fall of temperature ·will cause a greater expausinn or contraction of the spirits in the larger end than in the smaller,' which will cause the column of mercury in that branch to rii;e aud fall, and thus a motion is eomrnunicated to its smface in both hrmiches. A small index of steel, coated with glass -and lightly held in plaC'.t~ hy a delicate spring, i;-; pushed along by the smface of the mercury awl n·mains at the farthest position when the mercury withdraw:5. The Breguet metallic thermometer is constructed on the principle of the u11<·qua1 c·xpansion of metals. The compound bar i:s composed of laminre of lml:-;s a1Hl :-\feel united together and bent into horseshoe form. One end is firmly fixPr1 and the other, being free t.1 move under the influence of the unequal expansion nr contraction of the two metals, gives rotary motion to an index and registers on a dial hy means of an auxiliary hand held hy friction at tlw hig-hest or lowest point of temperature. The whole is iuclmwrl in a brass case made sufficiently strong to wit.hstalH1 pressure. The Saxton thermometer is the same as the Breguet in Jlrinciple, but tlw laminm are composed of silver and platinum and wound in a spiral inst<~ad of heing he11t into horseshoe form. It is heavily gilded and inclosed

The conclusions n<foptt·r1 by Professor Bache from tlw observations taken under hi,, <lirectiou bdween 1854 and 1860 were as follows: That between Cape Florida and Kew York the Gulf Stream is diYided into several bands of higher and lower temperatures of which the axis is the, warmest, the temperature falling rapidly inshore awl more i-;lnwly ouhicle. This is not only the case at the surface; but, with modifications easily understood, at eo11siderahl1; depths. Tliat between the <·cm:-;t awl the :-;trcam tlwn· is a fall in tPmperntnrc so abrupt that it has beeu aptly called tlw "<'.old wall." The cold wall extends, with varying <lime11sinn1' and changes of its peculiar feature:-;, alo11g the coast from Cape Florida i101ihward as far as exami11l·d. Inside this wall of marked colder temperature tht>re is another increar,;e, while out::;ide the warmeRt barn1, which is next the cold wall, them is another warm and one other cold band.

Iu the sectimu; on which the work was duplicated, viz, the Cape Henry arnl the Cape Hatteras sedionR, the p0Ritio11s of the cold wall and axis nf the Stream aµ;reed within 5~ miles, aud those of the succeeding points of maximum and minimum temperature within 7~ miles. After the yeur 1860 Gulf Stream investigation <;eased almost entirely until 1Hfi7, wlwn Prof. lIPnry Mitchell of the Coast Survey sounded betweeu Key 'V l'St and Ha Ymm aud observed the currents to the depth of GOO fathoms, tlw deepest ovPr attempted to that date. The method adopted to observe tlwse current;.; was the following: Two glohcs or cans of <x1ual sul'fill'e wern attaclw1l to each other by a line of the desired length. One of tlw g-lobes was loaded so aR to sink to the length of the connecting line, wl1ile tl1e other was on the surface supporting its mate. "Within the latter mt8 a light reel upon whieh a small log line, passing through an aperture, was wound by a crank from \vithout. To the end of the line was secured a third globe floating freely upon the smface of the water. 'Vhen making an observation tlrn fog liue wat-< reeled in until the surface globes were together. At a signal the reel was released, and, if the currents influencing the two were different, the amount of separation in a given time indicated the relative velocities. A trial v;a8 madt' of surface currents and at 300 and 400 fathoms depth, at a station 3. 7 miles from Fort Chorrera, Cuba, and a Yelocity of about one kuot wat'l found at each. Another trial was made about 3 miles farther off shore, with the result, that at 600 fathoms depth the current ''ms about 10 per cent. less than on the tmrface. From these experiments, Professor Mitchell was led to conclude that "the Gulf Stream_ has a nearly uniform velocity arnl constant course for a depth of 600 fathoms, although its temperature varies in this depth 40° F." In the following year Professor l\Iitchell continued <'urrent ohf<erv~tions in the Santaren and St Nicholas Channels, using an a11clwred buoy for the initial point from which to start the float for service observations. His conclusion was that the water· in these channels was motionless. In 1868-'6B-'70 expeditions were fitted out by the British Admiralty, and, nuder tho scientific direction of Dr. William R Carpenter, :Mr. J. Gwyn ,Jeffreys and Prof. C. Wyville Thomson, sounded and dredged off the coast of Europe from the Faroe Islands to Gibraltar. Accurate tempera-

turn observations were taken, and from these Professor Thomson has given the course of the currents in ·what is called the northeastern extension of the Gulf Stream. By the term Gulf Stream he explaimi: I mean that ma;.;s of heated ·water which pours from the Straits of Florida acrrnss the North Atlantic aud likewise a wider but less defined warm current, evidently forming part of the same great moYemeut of water, which curves northward, to the eaHtward of the West fo<liau Islands. lam mp1elf inclineu, without he1Sitatim1, to regard this stream as simply the reflux of the equatorial enrreut, addell to, iw doubt, during its northeasterly course by the Hnrface drift of the anti-trades which follow in the main in the same direction. Of the cause of the Gulf Stream he ;.;ays: "It 8Cems to me that the Gulf Stream j,.; the one natural pbeuomeuon on the surface of the earth whose origin and principal cause, the drift of the trade winds, can be most dearly and ea8ily traced.n He couclucles that the Stream enters the North Atlantic all(l f1ceumulate8. Finding no free passage toward the northea::;t, a pmiion of it goes toward the Azores, but the accumulation to the iwrthward forces a return eddy current to underrun certain portions of the warmer flow. In 18i3, the Challen,qer expedition, under the command of Capt. Sir George Nares, R. N., with n full staff of scientific gentlemen, of which Prof. c. \Vyvillt\ rrhomson WH8 the hend, added some most valuable data, to the record of Gulf Stream iuve8tigatiou. They eros;,;ed the North Atlantic twice, and made pa8sages north and south along the 8hores of both hemispheres, making the most accurate observation8 of temperature and specific gravity. In tlrn passage of the Challen,qer across the Gulf Stream off New York, and between Halifax and Bermuda, the altematious of warm and cold water were found. 'I'hey also at time8 made observations of the stren~rth and direction of the currents, both surface and sub::;urface, using practically the 8ame method as that employed by Professor l\fitche11 in the Straits of Florida in 1867.

The Coast Survey continued its examinations iu the Gulf Stream in som1ding and dredging during the years 1868 to 1878, with the steamer:-; Bibb, under Acting l\Ias~er Hobert Platt, U. S. N., the Bache, unrler Comnumder J. A. Howell, U. S. N., ai~cl the Blake, under Lieut. Commander C. D. Sigsbee, U.S. N .. Mr. L. F. Pourtales and Prof. Louis Agassiz accompanied the vessels at different times for the purpose of collecting and arrang-

ing the results of tho <ln~<lgiug operations. In 187!1 the investigation was extended into the l:Jt~1:ihbean, awl a theory advanced as to the flow of its waters by Commander John R Bartlett, U. S. N., who commanded the vessel. In his report accompanying- the reconl of the season's work he concludes that the equatorial current, which 8ets directly against the Windward Islands, is by them and their connecting ridges deflected northward, and so following their outer edge pa;o;ses around the Virgin Islands to the westward and through the deep channel to the uorthwar<l. of San Domingo. lfo suggests, also, that 011 roaching Cuba the current divides, a part flowing northwest through tho ol<l Bahama Channel and a part through the 'Vindward passage between Cuba and San D~nningo, and thus hy Cape San Antonio i11to the Gulf of 11exico. His report states that the specimens of bottom taken in the "Wiwlwar1l pasl'lage give evidence that the cun·ent rnoves in depths greater than 800 fathoms awl that it reaches the bottom. He remarks, too: '''I'he current, always found flowing north along the ew;tern side of South America, oil read1ing the island of Tobago divides, part joining the equatorial cwTent setting north along the chain of islands, the remainder following the coast line of Triuida<1 and the Spanish l\fain, and so around the entire circumference of the Caribbean Sea, finding at last an outlet at the ::\Icnm Pas;-;age aucl the Anegada Channel to join the equatorial current on its way to the Gulf of l\iexico." This circulation is so contrary to that found in the later investigation made by the Blake that it is given iu full. Prof. Alexander Agassiz accompanied Commander Bartlett 011 this cruise, and while he quotci-1 the latter on this subject he does not seem to adopt these ideas without question, for he says: "In the present state of our knowledge it is difficult to trace the path of the equatorial water as it is forced into the eastern Caribbean." In 1877 the first attempt was made by the lJ. S. Coast Survey to systematically observe ocean currents from a vessel anchored at sea. The :-;chooner JJrifi was built for this purpose, and under command of Acting 3faster Robert Platt, U. S. N., successfully observed the currents between Nantucket and Nova Scotia, occupying eight stations for varying periods, the longest time being over 90 hotm; and the greatest depth of water 135 fathoms.

In 1XX3 Lieut, J. C. Fremout,jr., U.S. N., in command of tlw schooner DrU~, was <lt·taikd for the first Gulf Stream current iuvestigation to he made from a w:-;sel at anehor.

In ;.;pite of this, Lieutenant Fremont :-;ucceeded in m·eupying :live stmions IH'.ross the ehannd, the deepest anchorage being over 400 fathomt\. The currents were obserrnd by floating cans attached to a log line. It was diseoYered that, 11 contrary to expectation, the greatest n~lncity was not f(rnud at the supposed center of the stream, but somewhat to the wt·:-;twarrl of it.

Before heg:inning- the clcscription of the Blake's examinations of the Gulf t-ltream umler my command there is one other investigation to which allusion should he made. His Ilighuess the Prince of l\fonaeo during· the past ycart\ has hue11 l~ugaged in scientific researches on the coast of Frm)ce. The ohjeet of his examination 1vas primarily for the purpm;e of discovering the canse of the <lepartnre of the Hardines from the Bay of Btt'cay; but in conuectio11 \ritb this he has devoted mud1 of his time to a sttllh~ of the casten1 portion of tlw Gulf Stream. In order to discover the velocity and direction of this cnt'r('llt hi.· adopted the method of floats, hut carried it out in a manner arnl magnitur1e 11ever before attempted. ffo; floats were barrels and butt.le.-; to a lin1itP1l number, lmt mostly were specially cu11::;tn1eted copper globe;.;, awl all wen~ ballasted so as to expose as little surface as possible to the wind and w:wes.

In 1887, nine hundred and thirty-one were set adrift between the Azores and Newfoundland, and afterwards another line farther to the nortlnrnrd and eastward in the region of the supposed northeast extension of the stream near the fiftieth parnllel. Dividing each of the lines into thirds for purposes of study, he found that most of the float8 traveling to the southward came from the southward and middle groups, and of those going to the nortlnvard and eastward most of them helougcd to the northern groups, but there were some from each group which hatl traveled iu the opposite directions. Of those placed between the Azores and N ewfoundlaud, one from near the northcru end of the line and one from near the middle were found in Ireland, others from near the same points traveleJ to the coast of N urway, aml rnore were distributed along the shores of France, Spain, and ..Africa. None of those starte(l near the Azores were found north of Lisbon. Two of those from the northern end of the lino off the coast of France found their way to the ·west Indies.

OUTFIT OF TJIE BLAKE POR AXCHORING AT SEA AND OBSERVLVO TIIE ('C'IIRESTS.

From this hricf history of the Gulf Stream investigation it is seen that. all the theories as to causes, and all the facts as to limits, veioeit.\", and Llirection have been hn,serl entirely upon drift of vessels, or iufore11ees <lniwn frum temperature observations, character of the bottom !:loil, presence of Gulf weed, tide rips, etc., the best of them only giving evidence of the existence of a current when it is strong, aml not one of them giYing anyt liing conclusive or acmirate as to velocity or direction, or an imli('~11ion en~u of a rnµ;ular variation either daily or monthly. The e::.;tablishmeut of tlw axis of the t;tream by the thermometer was at once proved to be an enor, lJy LieutL~wmt Fremont's observations, and it has since been foun<l that a curnmt may be flowing Houth with a much warmer temperature tlian wheu, a few hours later, it i,.; flnwiug- north. It will be 8howu, too, that while a wnnn cU1Tt nt may be tiowing in its customary place, its warm water may })l1 traui:\portrnl hy the wiu<l:,; awl wave8 to other localities, without an aec"1npa11ying curnmt. A COll('.lusion drawn as to the direction or velocity of a cmTe11t hasetl upon temperatures is very apt to he wrong, unless expressed in the mo8t general terms. The drift of ves1mls, while showing the existence of a current -IVithin cnrtain limitH is open to many objections. When iu sight of known objects on lalll1 and iu the smoothest water, the determination of the difference betwee11 tho actual and tho supposed run of the vessel does not accurately show tho current. The errors in steering, of the compass and log, of plotting 011 a chart <li . . torted by unequal shrinking in the process of mauufacture, all tmul toward error. How much less the chance of accuracy when a vess<>l i:-; at sea, the winds and waves driving her to leeward to an unknown amount, the motion of the vessel swinging the compass, the per,.,onal error or lack of judgment in the helmsman, the faulty astronomical position, never

The :-;nrface current too iR continually cl.tanging, and eYen if the drift of ves:-;t~l:-; di(l, by rare good luck, gini the current from the time of one fixed astronomical position to the next, the pm<itions are ~wparatt·d by so wide an inten:al of tinw that it is impossible to detect eYtJll tlie daily Yariation. The nece:-1sity, then, is obviOlrn, that in order to gai!l a k110wl<>11ge of any current, ohsenuthe limit, veloeity, direction, variations, and laws tio11s must he takl'n from a fixed point within tlw current. In attacking the prohlerq of the Gulf Stream, so important to all the commer('ial intere:;ts of the United States, nnd indeed to mo:,;t of tlw eiYilized worl1l, the Superintendent of the Coa:,;t and Geodetic Sun·ey, Prof J. E. Hilganl, authorized the attempt to a11ehor off Jupitt>r Inlet. Commander C. l\f. Chester, U.S. N., the Hydrogn:iphic Iuspector, carri(~dnut tlw scheme, awl the Yalunbh· obserYations of Lieutenant Fremont wen~ the results. Although this attempt at arriving at a kuovdedge uf the nctunl flow of water was ma<le with inadequate instruments, at 11 eonsiderahle ('XlWllS(' of time nnd money and under great difficultit·s, it was the greatest stridt" f(nnud a solution of the problem that had been made. The use of a sailing wi,;sel for the purpm.;(· was found to be impracticable. Tlw long delay in nrriYing :it the station ·when good weather appeared, and the fact that thi:; war:; impossible in a calm, which was the Yery time wheu obserYations would be most aecnrnte; the long hours necessary in l1mn:ing up tl1e anl'hor lJy the hand wirn1lass, and the clanger to the Yessel during this delay if had weather was the cause of clepmiure, all of these reasons brought a bout the decision that in the coutinuatiou of the work a fully eq~ipped steamer should be used. Tlw Blake was decided upon, as she was a substantial steamer, arnl, having the hoisting engines, reels, cte., used for dredging, a slight change in outfit would prepare her for an(~horing. As before Rtated, the :rniface of the ocean is most liable to fluctuations, and it would be 1wcossary to go belo~v the surface and asl·ertain whut were the movements of the volume of the water in order to detc>rmine the laws of the flow. Upon being detailed for the commarnl of th<· Yessel in the smnmer of 1R84, permission was readily granted the writer to try new

The idea always kept in mind wa:-; that none of the parts sliould receive an undue share of strain, and that as far as possible the maRt anrl booms shouhl receive the force exerted upon them in the direction of their length.

The outrio-O'ers or snrcaders are held in i)()sitim1 hY stra1)s at thl'ir 00 . heels, lashings at the rail, arnl n,t their outer ends stc~('l-wire rope jumperstap, set up by turnbuckles to heavy hults iu the ship's sirfo m~ar the. water-line. The guys (m. m. m.) are of Rteel-win~ rope fin:-eig-hths of an inch in diameter, shackling to the horizontal eye::; at the head of the anchoring boom, passing tlmmgh leaders at the ends of the outriggers, ::tnd setting up by heavy turnbuckles to wire-rope straps at the "·arping chocks on the main deck. The guy-leaders are iron sheaYes, G inches in diameter, made to shackle to the wire-rope strap at the euds of the outnggers. The accumulator and foppin;r7-l{lt.-'1'he end of the anchoriug boom projecting over the bow is held up at an angle of about 45 degrees (when with no weight other than its own) by a steel-1Yire rope topping-lift 1 inch iu diameter passir:g to the forema:-;t head, thern~e through a leader on tlw dr·f'k, an<l aft to the hitts on the port quarter (see Fig. 3, illustration Ko. 38). Interposed iu this topping-lift is a rubber accumulator for the purpose, as already stated, of relieving the anchoring rope and the vessel of the sudden jerking strains clue to the pitching. The bolt u, placed in the deck for tlw change of rlirection nf the topping-lift, is situated so that wlwn the anchoring boom is pulled down with the greatest strain alhrn·able, the angle formed by the two legs oi~ the topping-lift at the masthead shall be biscet<_·d by the mast. The anchoring boom being out of the middle line of the wssel to starboard, the topping-lift leads to the port side of the masthead, so that the boom, the masthead, and the bolt in the cleek, previou,,;ly meutioued, are all in the same vertical plane. ·when in use the boom is held by its guys in this same plane, and thus the strains give only a downward thru8t on the mast (see d. b. a. in. Fig. 1, illrn;tration No. 38). Tlw horizontal angle made by the plane of the topping-lift with a vertical plaue throug·h the keel is about 11 degrees, and consequently the axis of the socket at the pawl-bitt points to starboard by this a'\nount. The accumulator, shown in illrn1tration No. 39 is an arrang:ernent of ru l 1her springs devised by Lieutenant-Commander Sigshee for m;e i11 dredgiug, awl afterw~rds changed in some ways to meet the new requirPments in anC'hor~ ~

'l'he middle rod 7i (Fiµ·. ::!, illustration No. 39) is 1! inches in diameter, and the side rods c 1 inch, all of tool i,;tet·l. The rubber buffers a, cylindrical in shape, are 5 inches iu diameter, ::!! inches in thickness, with a cylindrical hole through the middle 1g inches in diameter. These buffers are separated from each otlwr by a bra:-;s tlisk or washer 71 i11d1es iu tliameter a11d one-eighth of an inch in thi<'kncss except at the middle, where an increase in the thick-. ue:-;s of the metal gives a. hearing surface as tlrny slide on the rod, and at the same time prevents the rubber from grasping the rod as it is compressed. The diameter of the washers, it will be notic{'d, is over :2 iuches larger than the rubbers. This is to give the latter a bearing surface as they expand in diarnetl'r when under strain. There are 70 rubbers in all, which will admit an effective compression of about 5 feet. rrhe composition is known m; "Xo. ~i:i" hy the :New York Belting and Packing Company, from whom they han~ always been purchased. In assembling the different parb: of the acrumulator the middle rod is lubricaterl with black lead and tallow, care beiug takeu not to all{lw it to µ:et 011 the· rubbers. Exposure to the sun cause:-; the surface of tlw rubb{m; to cra('k 1'li;:.d1tly, aml undue compression, causes au extension of the cracks. in orclL'l" to prcn'ent unrlue compression an adtlit.ional win~ rope, shown on the frnuti,;piece, is shacklerl to the upper end of the ;:wcumulator and to the uuter end of the anchoring boom. This rope (five-eightl1.i of an ineh i11 1liameter) is t·alled the preventer topping lift, and is of such a length that it 1\ill take the strain when the hnorn is pulled down befiwe the rubbers an~ v11mprei"ised to a dangerous limit. Exeept wit11 a largl! anchoring rope the 1lat1g't'r is but little with new rubbers, but as they become old they are liable tn split.

Hesting as it dol~S immediately beneath, awl with the opeuiug between its jam.; foir with the anchoring rope, it is ouly a moment's work to bl'ar the lattN imo the score and set. up on the 8crew. \Vhen the vessel is rolling- lwavily, tlw clamp, nnt heing bolted to the deck, is apt to capsize, and for this rPal"nn the Rli11g is ma<le which shows on illut-;tration No. 42. Jro111cork.-\Vhenever it is possible, the usc of iron is discourag-ed mul ·wire rope suh-.tituted. Each part is so dependent upon all sustaining tl1(:ir own strain:', that if one gives wny under "stre:;s, the others receh-e th<'ir work at an unexpected angle, and a, wreckage of the "·hole r:;y::;tem is liahk, perhaps with an aceompaniment of loss of life. At fir,,;t, the leaders at th~ euc1s of the outriggers were shackled into eye 1.Jauds, aud a defetti n~ \n·ltl in one of these came near cau::;ing just Ruch an a<"eident. Cpon its hn·aking, the an«horing hoom swung to starboard at an angle of about .J.(1° "ith the keel, until tlw jumper, extending from the boom encl to the ham;e-lwk\ rostrained it from farther clefiection.

As it w11t<, the loss of thP bowsprit was the extent of the damage, and si111·8 that time wire ropl1 straps have replaced the wire bands. In case the anchoring- rope break.-; at or near the surface of the \V-ater, the accumulator, heiug- i'iwldenl y rnlien~r1 of its strain, acts like a catapult 011 the boom end, tewliug- to throw it over 011 the deck.

Within the frame and ring is a freely moving rudder, b, having its stmn in bearings at the major diameter of the elliptical frame. On the sides of the rudder are two firn;, k, of thin metal, to which arc attached levcm; ready to engage one of the notches of the ring whenever ·pressure is brought to bear upon their upper surfaces. A small spring of sufficient strength to overcome the weight of the fins holds the lc-rnr from the notchn:-; until a pressure is. applied in the opposite direction. Attached to the rudder ou the opposite side of its stern and revolving with it i;; tho velocity apparatus d. This consists of 4 cones placed at the extremities of arms or spokes, which are at right angles to each other. The c01ie:-; are attached in such a way that the apices of al1, point in the same direction with reference to the spokes, so that when in a current the hm;e of the cone above the center mid the apex of the one diametrically opposite are toward the current.. They are placed also with the center of their bases and their apices at the same length of radius. At the axis of the system is n 8mall :,;haft, which by a worm actuates geared wheels registering its revolution:,;. The number of these revolutions per kn0.t is determined by the average of many hundred observations taken simultaneously with the meter and log, u,,,ing with the latter a weighted pole 21 feet long instead of a logchip. Below the rudder stem is a compass needle in a weighted bowl, o, which is hung in gimbals, and between the rudder and bowl is a system of levers so arranged that they will lift and hold the needle whenever desired. Passing through the center of the rudder stem at its lower bearing is a small rod, its lower end comnrn1iicating with the levers provided for locking the compass needle and with its upper end attached by the rod f to the fins at the side of the rudder. Pressure 011 the fins, tlH.irefore, simultaneously secures the rudder and the compass needle, thus giving the azimuth of the

To prevent the needle being attacked by galYanic aetio11 it is coated with shellac, ancl when in use this must he done en~ry three or four clays. A deposit of gold or silver 011 the ueedle does not s(·em to be efficient for this purpose. Above the nulder is a propeller having a clutch so arranged that upward motion through the water will give downward motion to a small rod passing through the center of the rudder stem, while motion in the contrary direction will not alter the position of the rod. Its office· is to lock the fins after they ha\·e performed their tluty of ser:uriug th0 rmMer aud compass. The nction then is: the meter i::; lowered to nny desired depth and a certain time allowed for it to register the velocity of tlie cwTei1t. At a given Rignal it is hoisted, and immediately upon starting to ri:-;e tlH"oug·l1 the water the pressure upon the fins secure:'! the rudder and the eompasc; needle, and as long as there ii' a continuous motion in the "ame direction both will remain secured until the surface of tlie water i:,; reached. The propeller, howGver, also begins to revolve at the instant of 110istiug, and, Ju::>hing its rod downward, locks the fins thatI have already caui..d1t tltP eom1 . . " pass needle and rudde1·. A. device has been attached to the rudder by which the revoking ccrnes were held fast in descent and were released upon stopping. Another attnehmeut has been applied, by which the propeller would lock the cones upon hoisting, but both were discarded for this reason: the propeller by quick hoisting may be made to lock the fins through au ascent of but 6 feet, and again by lack of speed it wi"ll not lock through 60. If it was lowe1·ed fairly fast the cones would be certainly stopped, but if through carelessness tht· men should slow or cease lowering they would be released. This uncertainty led to their abandonment, and the following plan was adopted: The record is kept of the i!umber of minutes and seconds occupied in l(nveriug to the de8ired depth and in ascending from this depth to the rmrfaf'e of the water. During this time the ~ones were revolving from their m~wement through the wa.,.ter vertically and also from the passage _of the flowing water transversely.

Tho whole instrument is hung in trunnions at about its f'enter of figure, so that ir maintain!'\ au upright position when in tlw water. The total weigl1t is about :2r> pounds, and to this is added a lead shot of 75 pournh;, and the whole is lowered by a steel wire of .No. 16 gauge. In a stroug cmn~nt, in :-;pite of the smallness of the wire awl si:w of the weight, tl1e nwter is swept far astern. To force it to travel in uearly a vertical direction, the arm, n, illu,.;tration No. 44 (called a traveler), :-;eeu projecting from the balP of tlw rneter, moves down a jackstay wire, which is lrnld against the curreut by additional weight, etc. The traveler ii'\ provided with two rollers or sheaves at its forward end whid1 <'an readily he remoYed. It::; rear end is secured to tlw hale alone, at the trunion:-> and top, so a:- not to restrain the moYablc part>i of the meter iu assuming a vertical position. The jackstay wire is carried on a reel secun·d to the top of the steam capstan, and leads from that to guide wheels on a small wooden bed placed at the ship's side, the length of the traveler forward of the Rotmding machine, frorn whi(~h the meter is lowered (see h, fig 1, illustration Xo. 38, and also illustration No. 45). Attached to the en~l of the jaclrnta,r iH a shot weighing about 200 pounds, and from it a line, called the distance line, secured to the anchoring rope. (See fig. 1.) 'I'he length of the latter <lcpemls upon circumstances; depth of water, strength of current, and depth of current, all of which must be judged before lowering. In shallow water (300 or 400 fathoms) and a strong current, the anchoring rope tendti well ahC'ad, and to lo,ver the jackstay wire to 150 fathoms will require about 100 fathoms of distance line. In 1,500 fathoms of water with the same strength of current, 2f> or 30 fathoms will be sufficient. The point to be aimed at is that the jackstay shall be as nearly vertical as possible. In practice, the distance line is fastened to the anchoring rope after the vessel is at anchor. rrhe wire rope is veered, and at the same time the shot is lowered, care heir~g taken that the former does not exceed the latter, for in that event tho jackstay will be broken. To observe currents to 200 fathoms, 225 fathoms are veered on hoth anchoring rope and jacks~ay,

In a strong <'nrrent, howeYer, the inclination of the anclwriug rope and the pull aft of the distance line, due to the friction of the current, prevents tlw hank from sliding more than a fow fatlwms. It sometimes happens that there ]ws heeu a wrong· eondusion arrived Ht, and the distance line is too long or too sho1i, or an unexpe('t("d change in the volume of tho curre11t ha8 altered tho conditions. The only thing· to do in such a case is to heave in and hernl 011 afresh. The wire used in low'ering the meter is carried on the sounding reel, awl the sounding machine designed by J,1ieutena11t Commander Sigshee is use!l in lowering. The usual depths observed are in fathoms, 3~, L), 30, (jf,, 130, aml :200. 1'he friction of the current sweeps the wire astern iii spite of its i,;mall size ancl the 100 pounds in weight at its lower encl. To determim· how much wire to pay out in order to allmv the meter to reach tl1e desired depth, many experiments were rnade by sending down a prm;sure sounding rod with the meter. In a 5-knot surface current, 195 fathoms of wire is veered to reach 130 fathoms depth, and in this :;;trength of current to attain 200 fathom8 1Yith a fair degree of certainty iR impracticable.

to the wind when 8he i8 dead in the water. The wind is brought, therefore, on the side which will bring the expected current nearest ahead. Thtl ring stoi>per is let go, leaving the anchor hanging from the boom end. \Vhen all is ready, a little steam is turned on the hoisting engine, the reel-brake liftt·d, and the anchor descends at the rate of from 50 to 80 fathoms per minute. If the water is but a few lmudred fathoms deep the higher i:s the ;;peed of veering. If very deep, the long-continued use, combined with high speml, heats the brake strap and reol and runs the risk of charring the wornleu lining of the former. Steam is gradually reduced 011 the l10i8ti11g engine as the leugth paid out i1H'reases, until at last the throttle is closed entirely. The vessel is d1·iftiug liroadside to the wind and the anchoring rope starnfa ·well out on the weatlwr beam. After a while it is noticed that the heading· of the vessel is changing somewhat and the anchoring rope, instead of tending abeam, is ("orning ahead. This shows at once that the anchor is iu dead wnter aud is holding the vessel np against the surface rurrent. A few fathoms before bottom should hu reached the reel is checked, so that the anchor shall not he f(1t1lm1, and the rope shall be fair on the bottom. The rate of paying nut from thi:-; time on depends upon the indications as to strength of curnmt. The ouly sure oue is the speed of the water passing the ve8sel, or after the anchor i::; imrely on the bottom a tremble in the anchoring rope as the anchor drag8. If the current is deep, the vessel, the anchor, and the rope may be J.rifting with it almost as fast. If there are no indications of cnrreut the rope ::;hould he veered very slowly, 10 or 12 fathoms a minute, but nuder some ·circmru;tances 50 fathoms may be the speed. Gradually the rate of veering is diminished as the proper number of fathoms is approadwd, using the hoisting engine for controlling the rope. If the anchor is dragging over a smooth rock bottom and suddenly catches, t~e ,;trnin of lffinging up the vessel is enormous. At the first indication of this, the main engines are startml ahead full speed and the anchoring rope is :-ilackened for an instant. The accumulator, by the amount of its compresl'lion, shows at ouce when the anchor is holding the vessel. If the anchor cea~e8 to hold, the strain is released and the boom jumps. If this is the case another hundred fathoms is veered.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

533

The proportion of anchoring rope to the depth varies witl1 the diaracter of bottom, the strength of current, aud the depth of water~ and somewhat with the size of the rope. In wa,ter less than GOO fathoms from two to three times the depth is required, and in 2,000 fathoms of water 3,00() f;1tl1orns of rope is generally sufficient. \Vith a small rope, an achantage j,, gained by splicing a piece of larger size on the anchor end about 100 fatlwm-; iu length, to give additional weight at that point. \Vlwn the wsst>l iR at :mchor, the distance line is faste1wd to the auehoring: rope and the shot is lowered by the jackstay wire to the length of the former. Tlw order iR then given to veer together. The man at the hoisting engine call;; out as he veers each 25 fathoms, as a mark to the officer at tlw jaC'kstr:y. Tlic· latter, having started ahead by the length of the dii.;tanl'e line, !ms lowerell <luring the interval a. proportionately less number of fatho1rn1, Rn that both reach the desired depth at the same time. The rope i8 then clamped, tlw current meter is connected to the jackstay, an<l the men take their stations for lowering the meter. The officer of the deck and a quartermaster are ou the platform outside the vessel (see illustration No. 4f>); a man is at the friction li1w to control the revolutions of the reel carrying the 1irnter wire, and the Ht>corder i;; at the timepiece in the pilot-house. The officer of the deck order;;, "Ltnver to 3~ fathoms." The instant of striking the surface of the water he f'ries "JVIark," for the Recorder to note the time. 'Vheu the nwter reaehe8 tlw desired depth, the man at the friction line, who has before him the register showing the amount of wire out, cries "Time," and the Recorder again notes the hour, minute, and second. The meter is to remain at the depth 30 minutes from the last entry. Two minutes before the time haR expired the Hecorder informs the officer of the deck, who orders the machine to be n.uumed. The engine is cleared of water, the belt shipped in the V-shaped score and tautened, a man with oil and canvas Rtands ready to gufrfo on the wire, and the quartermastei· and officer of the deck go on the platform. Upon the expiration of the 30 minutes the Recorder calls "rrime," and tlw man at the engine hoists the meter. The instant it reaches the surface ot' the water the officer calls "Mai-k," whereupon the Recorder nwkl';; a record of this time and also the readings of the revolutions and directio11 shmn1

bv the meter as soou as the officer of the de('k has read them. " Lower to 15 fathoms" is the next order, and the work continue::;. At and1or.-The various conditions of ·wind aml tide experienced by vessels at anchor in harbors are of course frmrnl at Rea. The wind and current may form any angle and the vessel headti to the Rtrongest force or a combination of the two. The nlake f'an remain at anchor with the wind blowing a force of six or even more, u11k·ss the wind is accompanied by a heavy sea, or unless it is about contrary to the current arnl the latter is strong. Steam in the boilers is always kept at full pressure and the engines ready to turn over at a moment's notice. The approach of a norther, the probability of collision with a vessel drifting in a calm, the breaking of a jackstay or meter wire, all require the use of the main engines at once. The motions of the anchoring rope and the accumulator when the vessel i>1 anchored in a current are of great value, and in fact are sure irnlications of whether or not the anchor holding. The how of the vessel falls in p1tching. As it does so the strain on the accumulator is partially relieved, and the rubbers expanding, the boom rises. \Vheu the bow chauges direetion, the aecumulator rubbers are compressed at once hy tho strain of lift.ing the wire rope, hut there arc two motions to it, the first part apparently heing caused hy the Jin of the how an<l ·the second by the stoppage and change of direction of the wire rope, which had just beeu de8cending. \Vlwn the anchor nips 011 tho bottom tho acpumulator rubbers are compn·ss1eil steadily. If the anchor breaks ground, the re-aetion cansc~s the boom end to rise more or less suddenly, depending on the character of the bnttoin. If it lmiaks from a rock, the rise is a jump of foet; if from ooze, the motion i:-1 so slow that it scarcely can be :-;een, and breaking out of clay IJ,'i \'t·s a rPsnlt between the two. In dragging, the accumulator will show 1lw fad at 011ce, except in ooze, and in this case even by a close watch ~t nm g-encrally he detected. The cause was con-ectly ascribed in one i11stanee to a foul anchor dragging crown first over smooth rock bottom. In this ease it was the tremble of the rope that gave the indication, there being no diffe'rences of strain to cause the accumulator to show the fact. In a strong cun·ent, the rope haH a vibration due to the passing water, and this is communicated to the wire rope clamp pendant, giving a hum of

535

very low note. Sometimes with a very deep current the vibration seems to be started far down below the surface, and ascending, hPeome8 more and more violent ; but these are not to be mistaken for the trembling that is due to dragging. "When the vessel remains at oue anC"ltorage for a <·onsiderahle length of time, the anchoring rope and jackstay wire are veered 2 or 3 fH·t dail.r to change tlw nip in the pulley8. A man i,; guwrally at the 8hip',; wheel to keep the anchoring rope "up and down" ahead, 8teeri11g the yesr;e] the 8allle as at sea. 'l'he on] Y time \Yheu he is not needeJ, is when there is but little or no current. In order that he can see the rope at nie-ht time a small white cotton flag is attached to it, and this is illuminated b.r a hull'seye lantern fastened to the bowsprit end. Gcttin!J underwa,11.-Two men are stationed in the reel-room, one to guide the rope over the reel by t1H' tackles shown in illustration Ko. 41, and the other to look out for the eng·ines. The metre ii,; sent below, and a man standl:l ready to g·uide on and oil thr jaekstay wire. The man at the hoisting engine lifts the break of tlw red and tums the steam on to its engine. When the reel has turned OYer, aIHl has takeu in the slack between it aml the winch-head, 8team is admitted to the hoistiug eng'iue, the rope isremoved from the clamp and eYerything is ready to heave-in. If the current. is strong or the ves:;el is riding to a strong breeze, the main (mgines are started ahead for a few momellts to relieYe the strain, and afterwards at i11tervals if necessary. The anchoring .rope and jaekstay come in together, the man at the register calling out as each 25 fathoms is pas1md. "When the distance line reaches the how-sprit end, it is cast off and hauled on board with the shot. There is of course more strain 011 the accumulator when heaving in than there is while at anchor in deep water, because of the increased skin friction on the rope due to its upward motion. At first the rate of progTess is slow, not more than 8 or 10 fathoms per minute. The vessel is held up toward the anchor as much a"S possible, and particularly is this necessary on rocky bottom, for if the anchor breaks out at fairly long scope it is liable to catch again with a greater chance of loss. J'he instant the accumulator jumps, showing that the anchor has tripped, the thrott.les of the engine are opened, so as to make the anchor clear the bottom as soon as possible.

536

The speed then iR from 50 to 80 fathoms per minute. If too much steam is on the reel engine:-;, the tension of tlrn rope bdween the reel and the winchhead will be too much, and there ·will be danger of C'rushing the harrel of the reel by the accumulation of pressure. The man at the hoisting engine regulates the speed of both, judging as to the one below by the amount of curve of the rope between the pulleys ou deek. If, on the other hand, it is not running fa8t enough, the rope "·ill either become slack, with danger of kinking, or it will slip on the winch-head. A very much preferable arrangement for reeling the rope under proper tension is one fitted to the dredge rePl of the Fish Commission steanrnr Albatross. By au automatic ~pooliug machine tho wire rope is properly placed on the reel, and by a self-adjusting valve the tension iH maintained fairly constant. vVhen the anchor is off the bottom the vessel's head is allowed to pay-off as it will. A man is sent with t]w open ~match cat-block to the bowsprit end, and another man to he ready to take the rope to the capstan. About 12 fathoms from the anchor a "square-mark" of canvas has been placed, and when this appears the block is hooked, the vessel put on her course, and everything made secure. Sometimes it happens that the anchor becomes caught on the bottom so that it is impossible to release it. The hoisting engine pulls until it can pull 110 more, the last heing only by a single revolution at a time as the hmv fall;:;. If the sea is smooth and tho rope free from kinks the Blake's hoisting- 1mgine can not hreak the rope. If there is much motion to the wsse1, howeYer, it can take in enough to cause the lift of the bow to <lo so, hut there is more or less risk in this method. All the parts of the gear are nrn1er great Hfrain, the sudden relief of which is not unlike an earthquake to the sensations of those 011 hoard. Breaking in one instance 200 fathoms from tlrn how, the anchoring rope was pulled through the wnter so violently, in :-;pite of the great friction of such a length, that a brreat loop was thrown hig·h into the air, falling as it came back arournl the end of the boom.

CHAPTER V.
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GULF STREAM IN THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AND TN THE Yf'CATL\T PASSAGE.

In alluding to the different points of examination, each cross-section of the Stream has, for the sake of brevity, been given a letter, the iuitial one being the first section examined between Fowey Roth, Florida, and Gun Cay, Bahama. This is called Section A, and those to the northward are given single letters, while those to the westward have clouble letters, as follows: Section A, from Fowey Hocks, Florida, to Gun Cay, Bahama. Section B, from Jupiter Inlet, F101;da, to-Memory Rock, Bahama. Section F, from Cape Hatteras Shoahi, about southeast. Section C C, from Rebecca Shoal, Florida, to near Havana. Section DD, from Cape San Antonio, Cuba, to Yucatan Bank. Section E E, across the extreme westem part of the Straits of Flo1;da. This last section has just been completed by Lieut. C. E. Vreeland, U. S. K., now commanding the Blake, and through his kindness I am enabled l:n comhi11e his observations \.vith thm;e made hy myself in former years. The ::;ections to which the iuterveuing lines belong have not been examined. In the first season, work was contemplated on Sections A and D D, but the result:; from the beginning were so surprising, and the methods of anchoring and observing the currents so successful, that I was constrained to ask authority to nhandon all idea of visiting the latter and to devote two seasons to the former section alone. This request was granted, and until the month of June in bot!~ the years 1885 and 1886 all the observations were made between Fowey Rocks and Gun Cay. In the following year, 1887, examinations wm·e made between Rebecca Shoal, Florida, about south to a point 10 miles west of Havana, (Section C C,) and also from Cape San Antonio, Cuba, to Yucatan Bauk (Sect.ion DD).

of 1888 and 1889 the eqnatorial and Caribbean Sea currents \Yere iuve:-:;tigated, in order to ascertain the relation between these and the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida. The research was also extended to the current iu tlw Old Bahama Channel, and, when opportunity offered during the summer seasons, to the flow off Cape Hatteras and Nantucket. The extent of tlw examination, however, that has been made at the latter point:-:: has unt h(·Pn Rufficieut to warrant conclusions on all the phenomena of the localitie;-;, and the results, therefore, are not complete. For those navigating the Gulf Stream the most important questions to he answered nre: 'Vhat is the surface strength of the current arnl what is the <lireetion of the flmv ·~ It is well known that these Yary at many if not at all partli of the stream. Can a fair knowledge of these rnriations lw predicted? Section A, frmn Fou·ey Rocks, Florida, to Gun Cay, Bahama.-Af'. the labors of two seasons were concentrated at this section the results are more l'ornplete than at the others, and in studying these results careful1y we find the key to the solhtion of many of the apparent anomalies at pointR where there are fewer observations on ·which to ba..<;;e conclusions. The whoh· wirlth of the Straits from shore to shore is 43 miles, and between the eunes of lUO fa.tlwms 39 miles. On the east side the bank is abrupt, 100 fathonrn being found ·within one mile of Gun Cay. The current of the Stream snmetinws runs ill as far as the depth of l 0 fathoms, hut genernlly it is farther off shore. On the west side the slope ill more gradual, but still the _surface eurrent freq nently i8 found quite close to Fowey Rocks. The bottom variC's at tlH· difforeut anchorages. At the station nearest the Bahama Ridfl of the clwmwl, the anchors always draggecl a considerable distanee before taking hold. Tlw drwlge twice brought up quantities of small branch coral. At the axis, 11 ~ miles from Fowey Rocks, the anch01· fouled the bottom three tinws, makingit ne~esRary to cut the anchoring rope to get under way. At the otlwr :mchor~ges there were evidences of rock bottom, but itpparently only n,.; nntcroppings, for frequently the anchor or dredge brought up clay or mwL The time actually employed in the observations at Section A amounh·d to over 1,100 hours, and the longest continuous anchorage Hili hours.

possible, but during the second year changes were made from point to point, in the endeavor to discover tho relative velocities at the different parts, and thus to establish, if possible, the axis of the Stream. It will he remembered that the few observations made by Lieutenant Fremont off Jupiter Inlet, in 1884, indicated that the maximum surface flow m1s not situated where it .was supposed to ho by ProfesRor Bache, but at some point farther to the westward. It required hut few observations in the Blakr to determine positively that this was the case. i\t Statiou 1, 8 miles distant from Fowey Rocks, the velocity at times was found to be greater than at Station 2, 7 miles nearer the middle of the stream, while the average at the latter exceeded the average at the former. Observations were then taken at a station midway between the two, and, whenever possible, changes were quickly made from this station to Station 1. Whenever this was done the velocity of the smface flow at the latter was generally less than at the former, and the average of all the observations at Station 1~ far exceeded those at stations on either side. At Station No. 2, however, the total volume 'vas found to be mueh the greater, the area of a section of the prism representing 1 hour's current being 30 per cent. more than at Station No. 1 ~The hourly average in knots of all the observations taken at the various depths and stations is shown in the following table:

These velocities are shown as curves in illustration No. 51 (seep. .550), placed at their proper sbltions in the cross section of the stream, but revolved around the initial point 90° from the direction of the cun-ent F1·orn the table and from the vertical curves, it will he seen, that, with the exception of the

UNlTED S'rA'rEs COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

541

surface velocity, the flow is greater at every depth at Station 2 thau at a corresponding depth at other stations, and that the one exception is at Station q, where the smface velocity is greater than at any other station. Thi,; is the average position of the axis of surface velocity; hut, as will be semi later, its flow is 11ot at all times superior. The position of the maximum at <lifferent times during the month i:;; intimately associated with the ehanges iu the declination of the moon, and indeed, not only the po1:-1itio11 of the maximum but the velocity and width of the whole Stream as ·well. Other factorl'l also enter the problem to cause regular variatiorn~, but they ::;eem to he small in comparison with the influence of the moon. The effect of the barometric prm;sure is (·xerted to cause an irreg·ular variation, and it is diffieult for a single ohl'\eITer to always sure that a certain result is to be assigned to this cause arnl not to imme fixed and invariable law. It itl 11nly by a general average of all the olJservations that this can he reduced to a minimum The monthly variation.-Following the changes in the declination of the moon, the velocity of the stream at any given point is accelerated or 1liminished, but while it is running faster at one place, at another it is rmming slower. It is in fact a reduction in velocity at the sides accompanying- an increase in velocity at the axis, and the reverse, or in effect, an alternate expansion and contraction of the Stream in width. This is not marked on the east side of the Straits of Florida, and, as will be seen later, t11is is hardly to he expected. It is very marked on the west ~;ide of the Stream. Illustration No. 46 showR the changes in the smface velocity for the different· stations. The average of each day's observations is plotted at its proper position with reference to the declination of the moon, using, howeve1\ for the "smface" the observations obtained at 3~, 15, and 30 fath01mi depth. The actual surface current follows the mean curve very closely, but by taking the average of the 3 depths, single euors of observation:- are thus reduced. It will be remarked at once that at northern declination, in the observations of 1886, the velocities at Station 1 were far below those at southern declination taken in 1885. This was a case of an abnormal condition of barometer 'in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic, and the dotted line represents more nearly the true current conditions. In passing the next zero

<leclination tlw curve of Station 1 is excessively high. Thi:-; part 1lept·wls upon half day's observations taken at the time of thP daily maximum. They are in:-;erted to show the decrease in velocity as the moon changes it:> pol'liti011. Above the curves are anows showing the meau direction of the flow of the lower t-ltrata (Gl) aud 130 fathoms). The short vertical lines separnting· the arrows iuto groups are drawn at intervals equal to the changes of declination of the moon, and it will be seen that within the limit of any space, a11 the arrows are inelined in the same direction. Those iucliuiug upwanl indicate a current moving to the westward of north, and those inclining down a movement to the eastward of north. The curYes of velocity at Stations 1 ~ awl ~ increase as the moon approaches zero declination, and at the same time the current at Station 1 is rapidly diminishing. Tho direction of the flo-w, as shown by the arrows, is then inclined slightly toward the east of north or toward the. middle of the 8tream and away from Station 1. As the moon approaehes its g-reatest declination, the velocities at Stations 1 ~ and 2 decrease, the direction changes to the vrnstward of north, and the speed of current at Station 1 rapidly increases. ln this vibration it appears that the maximum velocity at the axis and the minimum at Station 1 arrives at two or three days after zero declination, and in the course of one-fourth of the lunar month the total expansion has taken place and the reverse conditions prevail. During this periodic change, the directions of the currents at the side stations follow the mon~ ments of the axis. At the time when the line of maximum velocity is moving toward east or near low declination, the lower currents at the side stations incliue toward the center, and at the opposite movement of the axis, they incline outward or more nearly parallel with the axis.

the equator, the speed increases aud localize8 at some point to the right and diminishes in velocity at the stations to the left. At Section D D t!w same is inclica.ted, but here, unfortunately, the times at which the westernmost stations were occupied w1:re at the maximum ftow alone. Still another illustration of the monthly change in the Stream following the changes in the moon\; declination is shown in illustration ~o. ~rn. In its constructiou the vertical curves of velocity are divided into gruups i:;imilar to thn8e in which the arrows 011 illm;tratiou No. 4G are separated into high and low (lecli1mtiou. The curves are carried to zero vek1city (not tl1e bottom) and the depths readied are joined by a continuous li11e. Iu plotting the points at the different stations the distances fr0111 tlw shore <ll"t> expanded or contracted to a common width of Strl1am between tlw 100fathum line. The distance below the surface of any part of the curYeti of one station bear8 no rnlntion to the distance of another, for they depend upon the relative velocities at (15 :md 130 fathom.,;. 1'he curves only show that at the same relative point there is a diffei·ence in the depth of the Stream in the same llirectiou at all the sections. At Sections E E and C C it will be noticed that at low declination the curves drop to nearly double the depth of Section A at tlw flame rdatiYe position from the 100-fathom curve, hut that the latter sl1mn; a very <fo(~p Cl1;_rrent on the eastern side at both high and low declination. The cause of this is without doubt due to the inertia of the water which has been flowingeast off Havana and is foreed agairn;t the hank in rounding the curve of the Straits of Florida at Section A. At tlie latter section the lowest point of the western pa1·t of the curves is at hnv declination, and is situated approximately at the point of greatest. contraction of the axis velocity. The lowe,.;t point of high declination is to the left or westward and corresponds to the movement of the axis. At Sections E E and C C the depth at high declination is the greatest on the extreme north, or, as in Section A, on the left of the Stream. There are other points of co-ordination or agreement in tht· curves and directions of the currents, as shown in the plates. At the tinw of high declination at Sections E E and D D, the strongest current being on the left side of the Stream, the eddy current is the strongest on the extreme

right along the Cuban shore, and where the reverse conditioH.s prevail, the axis being nearer the middle of the Stream, the eddies are lessened or entirely obliterated. It seems, therefore, to be abundantly proved that the monthly variation in the Straits of Florina consists of an expansion at high declination and a contraction with an increased localized :speed at low declination; that at the time of the contraction there is a deepening of the current at the axis, and at the time when the Stream has spread out it ha::s di1ninished its depth, hut has increased its velocity on the sides; that the most marked movement at high declination is an increased speed toward the left side and but little toward the right. While this monthly change is taking- place there is another rythmical oscillation, which is also go~crncd by the moon. This is a rgular dail,11 variation in velocity which amounts in some instances to nearly 2~ knots. Sometimes wh,en the wind is favorable for the forma;tion of a "rip" this accompanies it, at which time the velocity of the current has been known to increase over one-half knot in a few moments. On May 21, 1886, when at anchor at Station 1, a rip was observed at 2 p. m., extending about north and south, at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile to the eastward of the vessel. The surface current for the previous half hour had been flowing at the rate of 3.29 knots. In the next 20 minutes the veloc~ty increased to 3.9 knots, during which time the rip reached the vessel and passed to the westward. In the next 30 minutes the speed became 4.6 knots, the rip still very marked and 'moving to the westward. The daily variation is most marked on the surface, and, like the monthly change, is far greater on tho west side of the stream than it is on the east. There are in reality two periods of increase and two of decrease during the lunar day, somewhat similar to the tide and half-tide of the Gulf of Mexico, but this is chiefly confined to the upper currents, while the lower strata frequently flows with but a single daily fluctuation, indicating _a solar influence. In the mean movement of t~e watr, the first or highest maximum generally anives at 9 hours before the upper transit of the moon, and the lesser at 9 hours before the lower transit.

In order to shnw gTaphica11y the regufarity of the changes, a diagram (illustration No. !}O) has heeu eoustnwh~d. The lunar days are rPpn·:-;(·ntt>d by the heavy verticnl lines. The ruean of the hourly observatiom; at all deptlu; at each statiou has lwen plotte1l at it8 proper place with n·frrence to the transit, and as nearly as possible at the declination of the moon at the time. This mean curve forms the lower si<le of the irregular shaded spaees. The upper side of each of these spnees is formed by the cm·ve of snrfoc·e velocities alone, drawn in the same mmmor, in order to show hov· closely the surface variations f(1JlO'w the anwage of the ·whole vohune in point ()f time. T11 left side of the rectaug·ular :-;haded spaces uear the middle li11e represents the time at whiC'h the mean current reaches its maximum, and tlw hours intervening between thiK and the transit of the moqn giYe what m.ay be called the e8tablislmient of the current. This is only intended as a graphic i11ustration, to show tlte n·gnlarity of the changes to the eye. In the data from ·which the actual e:-:tn hlisl1111e11t has been fixed the curves "·ere drawn on a scale suffideutly large to rernfor it an easy matter tu plot one one-~mudreclth of a knot or ~ rniuuh's in time. It has been seen that tl1e c·urreuts change monthly in velocity, following the declination of the moon. This increase and deerease has a great influence in forming the curve of daily changes. At the time of the monthly increase, the minimum current for the day follo,vs the greatest maximum by about 6 hours. In the next 6 hours there is an increa,-;e in Yelol'ity equal to or perhaps greater than the preceding maximum. In the third interval there is a halting or fall in speed to be succeeded by a still greater maximum 9 110urs before the next upper transit. At the time of the monthly decrease in velocity the conditions are reversed, the minimum preceding the maximum aml each sneeeeding maximum or minimum is le:-;::; than the preceding. In the intern1l of change there is a short time of irregular velocities when the maximum for the day arrives before the lower transit instead of the upper, somewhat similar to certain tides in the Gulf of }fexico, where, as the declination changes its uame, a high tide takes nearly the place of a low in time.

The table shows that the daily variation is greatest at the point of greatest average velocity and is also more excessive to the westward of thP axis than toward the east. 'Ve have seen that the surface temperatures vary during the lunar month. In the same manner they change during each lunar day. . The differences are most marked at the extreme Stations, No. 1 and Ko. 5.

it jg during the 12 hours after. In a part of these observations the !noon's transit was such that the 12 hours succeeding included the hours of day when the surface temperature would naturally be warmer. In about onehalf of them, however, the conditions are reversed, the transit being between 6 p. m. and midnight. This daily change in temperature is accompanied by a change in direction of the currents at the extreme stations and is more marked in the lower strata than in the higher. As the moon approaches the transit, or practically during the period of decreasing velocities, the currents at the extreme stations incline toward the axis, and during the 12 hours after the transit they are running more nearly pamllel. The effect of this upon the surface temperature of the intermediate statiom; is to cause a lower temperature with an increasing current, a,s sAen from the following table:

NOTE.- The lower temperatures are in brackets.

These. changes in velocity, temperature, and direction, all point to the fact that the Stream contracts and expands daily as well as monthly. In the daily fluctuations the _expansion is but trifling, and being short in duration in comparison with the monthly change, the surface temperatures at the sides increase with the velocity. As the monthly changes progress, however, the surface temperature is lowered and then raised, reaching its maximum and minimum at some time after the axis has actually changed its direction. The volu:me of {he Stream is best determined at Section A, for he1·e it is confined in width by earth itu;tea<l of water walls, and practically all its

water passes into the Atlantic. At the next section (off Jupiter Inlet) at certain times there probably is an eddy current along the Little Bahama Bank and through the Northwest Providence Channel. Farther to the westward off Hannia a small quantity passes, under certain conditions, through the Old Bahama Channel, but at Section A these variable conditions arc eliminated. In calculating the volume the averages of all the observations at each station have been plotted on a large vertical scale, and from the >< deepest point of observation (130 i~tthoms) the curves hase been continued to zero. The ordinates at different depths were then transferred to a horizontal or plan view, and curves were drawn through corresponding depths alld from the extreme stations to the initial line. Deflections in the direction of the current, which varied much fron1 north, were reso!Yeu into their component parts and only the northerly component taken. The thickness of the laminre used in the computation ·was, 10 fathoms thick from the surface to 50 fathoms, thence 50 fathoms thick to the bottom, and the volume was calculated by Simpson's rules. The result is a grand total of nearly 90,000,000,000 tons per hour, or, to give more nearly the actual :figures, 89,872,000,000 tons, and of this amount almost exactly one-half is carried within 100 fathoms of the surface. It will be noticed by referring to illustration No. 51 that, on the 'vestern slope, the mean depth to which the current reaches is near the bottom. At times, without doubt, it actually did so, and occasionally there was a reverse current. In every instance, however, when the average for the day 1va8 negative at 130 fathoms, the barometer in the Gulf of Mexico was lowest for the month or it was highest for the month a.long ll:he Atlantic coast of the United States. It will be remarked that at Stations Nos. 2, 3, and 4 tlte axerage depth at which zero is reached is uniform at about 325 fathoms. The currn representing ~l~e vertical current line (illustration No. 51) should not in fact reach the zero so abruptly, for without doubt the actual speed diminishes by smaller and smaller increments as the effect of friction becomes greater. The actual volume, however, would be increased but little, probably not more than one or two per cent., a triflh~g amount relatively, although at the same time so large actually that the mind can hardly grasp it.

Station 5 the curves show that the current actually reaches the bottom. In the discussion of the section off Havana the cause of thif-1 phen01nenon will be seen. The Straits of Florida, at Section C C, are about 73 miles in width between the curves of 100 fathoms depth. Situated as they arc near the beginuing of the Gulf Stream proper, with the direction of their flow at right angles to that of both the Straits pf Yucatan and Section A off Cape Florida, they are a most interesting study. The current does not fill the banks as is generally the case at Section A, hut has on its northern side a neutral zone of varying width, in which, at times, there is an eddy current setting to the westward. At Station 1, wMch is within this zone and about 3 miles from the 100-fathom curve, tidal currents were always found except ori one occasion, at which time the barometer was the highest for the month at the Signal Service stations in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, which without (!.oubt caused the abnormal current. 'Vhile the current is generally tidal, it is probable that in this part of the Stream the barometric influence is greater than elsewhere in this section. In the observations actually obtained, the predominating flow was easterly on the surface at low declination, but the. current was so slight that it is difficult to decide in what direction the gentle flow would go with varying conditions. Resolving the directions into their east and west components, it is found that when the moon is near the equator the currents are more easterly than westerly, and when near the highest declination they are the 1·everse, although they are still so weak that, for the purposes of navigation, they are not of much v::tlue and are readily overcome by abnormal meteorological conditions. At Station 2, 16 miles farther to the south, the cuITents are still irregular, this station being on the edge, as it were, of the Gulf Strea1:tl, sometimes wholly within its borders and again iu the variable zone. Whether it has a true Stream current or not depends still upon the moon's declination, but, situated as it is between the Stream and the neutral zone, its lower currents are perhaps apt to partake of the characteristics of the latter when the meteorological conditions cause irregularities.

552

SUI~VEY.

At high declination, as explained previously, the Stream spreads out its limits and increases the velocity ... at its HideR. This fa.ct iR most beautifully exemplified at this station. The first time it was occupied, the wind wmi from the eaRtward and the vm;sel was generally lying broa<hi<le-to. The surface flow was easterly and quite constant in directjou, the intermediate stratum was variable, and the lower current had a, southerly set. Suddenly the surface velocity wou.ld increase a knot or more in 10 or 15 rninutes, forcing the vessel to tail to it for a ;;hort time against the wind, and then return to its original heading. The next time the station was o<·.cupied, the declination of the moon was about the same, near ze1·0, but instead of the surface water setting east, it was irregular, and the intermediate m:d lower strata had a southerly Sl:'t. This difference was probably due tn the meteorological conditions prevailing. The high harometer rneniioned iu connection with Station 1 had passed off, and was fo1lowed by a }11-,y area iu the vicinity of the Mississippi Delta and Mobile, Alabarna. The tuin1 time the station was occupied the moon was within a day of its highest declination. The surface and intern1ediaJe 8trata had a strnng easterly cunent, while only the lower was in-egular. The following table shows the varying cornlitions:

The easterly components of the velocities are shown graphically in Fig. 4, from which it is seen that at hig11 declination the edge of the Stream was well to the northward of the station. At No. :2 it was nearer, and at 2a it was practically to the southward. Although the set was still slightly to the eastward with a variable current of two-tenths of a knot, it can hardly be called Gulf Stream. The position of the axis at Section C C varies during the month in the · :same manner as at Section A, except on its northern side. The uiovement

The tempera.turns show but little, for the reaison that the uh;;ervatiums were taken in two groups separated by an interval of about 3 months. The observations suitable for comparison, taken during the same month, were all on the northern side of the Stream, and in every instance the ·watt·r wa..'-l colder at low declination than it was at high. This i;; to be attrilmterl directly to the changing direction of tho cun-ent, and is the same in principlP ns at Section A, but with this difference in its execution. The latter section is narrow, and the current fills the strait with the axis nearest the ·western (left) shore. The surface is most constant in direction whilo the lower

currents are changeable, thus causing the rise and fall in temperature shown in table on page 542. At Section C C the current does uot fill the Strait, and the axis being nearer the i·ight hank, the left-hand part of the Stream follows the same chauge8 as the eastern portion at Section A, viz, warmer at high declination than at low. · The daily variations at Section C C are not as great as in the narrower part of the Stream, hut they arrive with as great regularity. The time of the esta.blish1nent is computed in the same manner as at Section A, by constructing a moan cmTe from all the observations and taking the average. This gives the time of the arrival of the maximum flow at 911 22m hefore the transit of the moon, but there seems to be a difference between the arri ya} of the wavp at tlw middle and at the side station::;, though this inay simply he a coincidence. The times are, beginning with the northern Rt.ation, No. 2, 811 53m, 9h 24m, 11" 30ru, 91i 28m, and 81i 22ru. Section AshowR nothiug of the kind, hut at the next section to the \'vestward there are indications of the sanw system. The observations at Section D D, extending across the Straits of Yucatan, resemble those of Section A more than those off Hrtvana. T'he profile of the bottom is in general the same, except in depth. It rises precipitously on the 8<.tstern side from a considerable depth, and to the westward tlw slope is more gradual to the 100-fathom curve of Yucatan Bn,nk. The current tloel-1 uot fill the Hpace from_ shore to shore. At' Station No. 1, in 23 fathoms, ~tnd ahout 5 miles inside the 100-fathom curve of Yucatan Hauk, the interference of the St1·eam current with the tidal current is very noticeable. On the surface, the flood tide, combining with the overflow from the Stream, runs about uorthwest for 18 hours. On tlrn ebb tide, the resultant was east at the time of the observations, awl the change frnm one to the other was by way of north. At 15 fathoms the direction was mostly to the eaRtward, the mean being ENE. ~ E. It seems probable that, at high declination of the moon, the overflow from the Stream_ may entirely overcome the ebb-tide current on the surface, in the vicinity of the 100-fathom curve. On the east side of the Passage there was a, light but }Jersistent eddy current from the Gnlf of Mexico into the Caribbean. The general direction

Even if the high pressure had not moved mvay from the Gulf regions at the time of the observations, the effect of its presence would be to make the eddy, ·which was nnming aR a snbcurrent, either too strong or w1·ong in direction, neither of which would affect the principle established, that in this part of the Yucatan Passage the upper cunents move rnntheastwardly a,t low declination of the moon. The other stations at this se<'tion present the same characteristics as Section A. The directiom; of the surface currents ntry but little from uorth, aud the average of all is N. by E. There is no evidence at any station but the one nearest Cape San Antonio, described above, of a movement of the water directly into the Straits of Florida, and this station belongs to the eddy rather than to the main current. The .axis of th(' jlmr is situated 'vest of the middle of the 8tream, the same as at Section A, and the same movement to the right. and left is well marked. At the time of high declination it is without doubt near the 100fathom curve of the Yucatan Bank. Stations were occupied about this time as follows:

The 100-fathom cm·vos from Sections E E to CC converge, awl the forme1' section being at the large end of the funnel and uoar tlw :,;ource fn nn which the supply of watpr comes (taking the source ns either the Caribbean or the Gulf of l\Iexieo), its currents vary gre:itly in dfrection.

It is seen from this table that at high declination the maximum velocity was at Station 1, that it gradualJy diminished to Station 5, and that at Station 6, on the Cuban shore (where the direction was entirely negative-au .eddy current), it increased considerably. At low declination the maximum was at Station 2, a change to the right in its position of about one-fifth the width of the Straits at this point.

Having llrawn conclusions as to the characteristics of the Gulf Strearn in tlw rntrnnver part,;, we will uow continue the oxamiuatim1 at poi11tK when~ a fow isolated ob;,;ervation8 have been taken, to 8ee if there nre indications that the same laws prevail or if new characteristics present il1cnrnelves. ObsmTatious of this kind have been made at Section B, hetween .Jupiter Inlet and J1emory Hock, at Section F, extending about southeast from Capo Hattera,; Shoah;, and in the equatorial current and Caribbean Sea. \Vhilo it],.; a, fact that at. any 0110 of these places the data are insufficient to cfofinite]y establish a law as to the ClUTent, yet it is thought that, viewed h_y the light we lmve obtained through the study already made, we sha.11 be ahle to show that all currents are governed hy the same laws. At sl~ction B, off Jupiter Inlet, two stations were occupied, 0110 Oll the \VeRt sitle of the Stream about 18 miles distant from the light-house and thn other on the extreme ea~t about !) miles from l\femory Rock. The first ohservationR were continued lluring a period of ovur 3 days, heginui.ng at 7 p. m., :May 30, 1886. :F'rom its situation we should place this anchorage very near the axis of the Stream, but as we have no data obtained under otlier couditiom; by which to estahli1-1h the fact, we can only stu<ly it by it:,;elf. Separating the observations into equal periods of 24 hours each we find that the mean of the currents at all depths decreased in velocity, and the average temperature during those periods diminished. The middle declination of the moon for the first day was north and 3 days after passing the equator. The next day's declination was on the dividing line established at Section A between "high" and "low" declination, and the third day was within the limit of "high.'' It will be remembered that as the axis moves towru.·d the east or west the temperature of the water rises and falls,

As far as the ohservatious go, this :'lection seems to follow the laws as determined by the data obtained at the sections farther to the southward. At Section F, oJf Cope IIatteras, the bottom deepens gradually from the extremity- of the shoals, abont 9 miles from the Capt~, to the 100-fathom curve, 21 miles distant. From this point the bottom drops suddenly to uearlv 2,000 fatlwrns in the uext 20 miles. 11 he nrnan position of the three anchorages at Station 1, is about [) miles outsicle the 100-fathom curve, in latitude 34° 52', longitude 75° 15'. Its situation with reference to the general direction of the flow of the current (about NE.), would lead us to look for characteristics resembling those of Station 1 at Section A, where the current iH flowiug north, awl ahio expect that they shouhl :,;omewhat partake of the p(iculiarity of Stations 1 and 2 of Section C C, where the general direction of the Stream is cast; that is to say, as the current off Cape Hatteras fio1';s in a direction which is a mean of the other two, its. extreme left-hand station should resemble the corresponding stations of the other sections. It is very unfortunate that at every time observations were made at th~s station the weather either just before or after was so abnormal that there may he a doubt entertained as to whether the currents actually found were normal or not. It will he seen later, however, that while they may not be normal in velocity, the mPtHorolog-ical conditions were such that the departure in each case will not a,ffect the principle established of changes according to declination, for all were influencec1 in the same way. This station was first occupied on the morning of May 28, 1887, and observations were continu~d ovEtr 50 hours. During this time the barometer was low at the Signal Service stations to the north ward, a clepression developing on the New Englancl coast and moving in a curve to the southward on the 29th, receding toward

It was relatively :shallow and was unaccompanied by «li8turbances of marked strength, but still it is possible that the low arc·a, influenced the current to make it n10re rapid than usual to·ward the latter part of the time of ob8ervatiou. The declination of the moon wa8 11ear the dividing line between the high and low as previou::;ly established by the study of the observations in the Straits of Florida, the tir,.;t half of the time being about 3J days before zc~ro declination. The current during the latter period should he less, according to theory, than during the forrl2.er period, but, in frtct, the l"l'Yerse was the case, the average of all the depths being two-tenths of a kuot grnatt>r. Thi:-; was the time, however, vvlwn tl1e effect of the barometer should he most potent in its intlrn~ncn on thfl current, for th(~ low area n~aehPd it:,; :southern limit 011 the 2~Jth awl tl1t~11 moved :l\vay. The· :'ltnmgtli of the . current was on the surface, the ll·wcr stratum apparently obeying the law, while the upper current:--> were possibly under the influence of the abnormal conditions. The first half of the observations, therefore, was prohahly ahout normal for the declination of the moon at the time, and duriug the la1-1t haJf the velocities were too great.

Hero again 've find evidence of the movement of the axis to the right and left following tho declination of the moon. Illustration No. 52 Rhmvs the curve of surface flow (abov<~ 30 fathoms) at high declination. HaYing no data obtained under opposite conditions with which to compare .it, the illustration is only evidence that, at the time of the ohservati01rn, the axi:-; was situated about' 10 miles outside the 100-fathom curve; that the surface width 'vas practically the same as in the Straits of Florida; that there \Vas a surface eddy current on the south side of the Stream, exactly the same as at Station 1 at low declination; and last, that there was a body of water on the right of the Stream setting to the northeast below the surface. There is reason to believe, and indeed the proof is pm;itive, that the current flowing along our coast is diYided into warm awl cold bands. At two anchorages, Nos. 4 and [,, the Yessel happened to he placed at points where the fluctuations in temperature were exces~ive. A study of the relations existing between ·the directions of their currents and the temperatures at these stations, together with th~ position of the moon, seems to confirm_ the truth of the theory of the movement of the Stream to the right and left. The moon at Station -1 was 16 hours after passing its highest northern declination. At Station 5 it was 2 days before reacl1'ing zero. Roth anchorages were in the year 1889, the first on May 4th and 5th and the second May 9th and 10th. It has been stated that at high declination the direction of the current at the sidesis more nearly parallel to the genera.I direction of the flow than at low declination, and this is more marked in the subcurrents than on the surface. The table below shows the <"urrents in question averaged for each quadrant of the compass, with the number of obs<:rvations:

From this it is seen that at Station 4 the mean direct.ions are much morf! to the eastward than at Station fl. Comparing tlui surface temperatures and directions (Fig. 7) we find that not only i;; the daily movement indicated at each Htation, but also the monthly. At both stations the directions chauged with fair regularity; at Station 4 from the southeast quadrant to the northwest, and in the reverse direction at Station 5. In the first case the temperatm·e cun·c shows an abrupt fall, with an indica.tion of a gradual rise to the end of the observations, and in the other case it is a gradual fall and a quick rise. It seems as if, at the time of the anchorage at Station 4, the maximum flow being on the north side of the stream, the southern edge, as represented by a col<l hand, was situated in its vicinity. At, low declination this cold band had moved out some 13 or 14 miles and was at Station 5. If observations .c-" can be continued for a period of two lunar weeks at either of the stations, it probably will be found that the directions predominate first toward the north and then toward the east, and that the abrupt change in temperature

The observations made within the limits of the Equatorial eitrrent were as follow8: One anchorage· about 60 miles north of Barbados, 8 between that island and Tobago, and also ia all the principal passages between the islands from Trinidad to Cuba. The current reaching the Windward Islands is, according to generally accepted helief, comprnm<l of two bodies of moving water. One part is said to be from the South Equatorial current, which after crossing the Atlantic from Africa divideR atCape'St. Roc1n<~, the eastern salient 0f South America, and forces a portion of its flow to the northward and westward along the coast of Brazil, past the mouth of the Amazon and the l'!hores of Guyan~, until it reaches the barrier of the 'Vindward Islands. The other current is the drift caused by the northeast- trade winds. W11atever may he the component parts or the cause of each it is a fact that the currents in the vicinity of Tobago are of a different character from those near Barbados. The first, moving as it does along the coast of South America, leaves the island of Tobago with a direction about KNW. The other,-fiowing in the general direction of the trade winds, causes a resultant direction at the point of meeting dependent upon the relative velocities of the two. The coast current has the most rapid flow, is deeper, and is probably more changeable than its mate. These conditions, in the combined current where the observations were made, render it difficult to determine whether the

same laws hold good here which have been found farther to the westward. The data obtained in the coast current would at first glance seem to point to a reversal of the law of change following the declination of tlt<-' n10011-that is, instead of the strongest surface current being found on the extreme left at high declination with a movement tmrnrd the rig-ht aK the moon lmsses the equator, there are indications that the reverse is the case. The data are so slight on which to base a conclusion that this is tru(·, nrn1 tho conditions tending to produce irregularities are so strong, it is in-obahh, that the exceptions found are due to variations in the force of the primn 1 cause of the flow. All of the anchorages between Barbados and 'I'ohngo wm·c placed nearly on the line joining the islands, and were made, with one exception (Station 4a), between January 26 and February 13, 1888. Station 1 was about 35 miles from Barbados, while Station 5 was about 3 miles from the 100-fathom curYe off Tobago Island, and rather under the lee of the most salient point of the shoal ·wfiter. At each station the flow of the upper stratum was quite constant in direction, and at 65 and 130 fothonrn depths it was variable, generally between northeast and northwest, and the Yariation was more marked at the northern than at the southern stntiom;, Station No. 32, situated about GO miles north of Barbados, w:u; oeeupied 30 hours, during which time it was calm or the wind 1Yas very light aucl variable. The body of the cuITent therefore may be considered as tJw normal drift for the date and season. The table below showf> the charaeter of the currents. The directions given are means of those falling within the limit of each quadrant of the compass separated by the intercardinal point1'\ The number of observations is also given, together with the velocity.

This table shows that to the depth of 65 fathoms there is a gentle flow to the southward and westward, predominating at W. by S.; that at 130 fathoms the character of the flow has changed from a steady current to a tidal current, but \Vith a predomination to the southward; and that at 200 fathoms the current is again constant but at right angles to that of the surface. The same drift current exists south of Barbados, with the same tidal influenc<:.1 at ·the lower depths, but with the djfference that the stronger coast current, meeting the drift current nearly at right angles, changes the direction of the latter.

Taking the mean of the currents at an-, 15, and 30 as the surface flow, we see that at one extreme of the line the drift has a course of W. ~ S., the same as at Station 32 north of Barbados, and at the other end (Station 5) the coast current sets N. by'W. i W., a cliffererice of six points and threequa.rters. In the portions of the Gulf Stream investigated, where the general flow is not on the meridional line, the differences in the direction of the current at the Bxtreme stations have been found to be as great as those sho~ in the table above, and this would seem to warrant tlrn conclusion that ~e coast current sometimes nearly fills the passage between Barbados

512

and Tobago with a general axial direction of about K"\V. Comparing the directions at Station 1 with those at Station 32, we see that there is a considerable deflection of the lower currents at the forme1·, which is probably due to the coast current. The only stations occupied more than once were Nos. 4 and 5, and from the table it is seen that at high declination the Yelocity at Station 4 is greater than it is at low declination. At Station 5; hmveYer, the Yelochies. show an exception to the rule established. At the first anchorage, ·with the moon midway between the equator and its highest declination, the current was strongest, and at the last anchorage, with the conditions exactly reYersed, it \:Vas 'Weakest. The situation of this station, hO\vever, makes :it probable that its currents are fluctuated irregularly, and particularly so on the sur:face. This fluctuation is due to variations in either the strength or the direction of the trade winds, and is observable to a greater or less degree at all the stations in this passage. Remembering the fact that there are two moving streams of watei·, one along the coast and the other inclined toward it, and assuming that tlH-y arc governed partly at least by the same laws of changes that control the Gulf Stream in the Straits of Florida, the following would seem to reconcile all npparent discrepancies. The surface velocity of the coast cmTent varies daily with great regularity, as will be seen later. The wind, however, is forcing the water toward the shore at a greater or less angle with its current, and the velocity of the escaping \vater depends largely upon this angle and the relative strength and persistency of -the \Yill(l. After zero declination the regular current should be deep and strong at its axis, which, according to theory, should be farther to the northward and eastward, or off shore, than at high declination. At Station 4 this was the case with the lm-:rer "1tratum, but the reverse was true with the surface currents. To account for tlrn latter, however, the wind at. one anchorage was blowing NE. by E. ~ E. with a force of 3, which would cause a le8s velocity to the escaping surface water than at the time of the other anchorage, when the wind was blowing from ESE. i E. with a force of from 3 to 4. The relative velocities of the currents at Station 5 should have been the reverse of those found. but the wind seems also to have been the. cause

of the irregularity. At the three anchorageR this was a8 followH: Station 5, ENE., force from 3 to 7. Station I/', ENE., force from 3 to 1, :uul Station 5t., NE.. hy E. force L1 : that is, for the first two, the same direction of wirnl but with lessening force at the second anchorage, and for the last :mchorag-p a direction more across the current and normal to the shore. The strcrng· current which was observed at 130 fa,thoms on February 5, was found at 65 fa:tho1ns, when the station was occupied a day and a half later, and had again dropped to 130 fathoms at 5u, as the time of the normal maximum had passed. \Vhile the velocity of the surface currrent seems to be governed t~ 1 a con8idernble extent by the wind, the lowe1· stratum is apparently i11flue11(·cil by the phases of the moou, and this helps to mask the declination variation. "'\Vhen we ex~irnino the observatiorn5 "taken at the seven anchorage;; in the passage south of St. Lucia Island, we fiud but little evidence of the effoet of the declinatiou, but every evidence that the lower currentf; vary with the phases. The velocity from the surface to 30 fathorns depth iti remarkably regular and constant, the former having a direction about \VX\V., seerningly the rmmltant of the trade drift and the coast current, and the fatter inclining more to tho westward as the depth increases. At the lower depths there was a decided tidal flow into and out of the Caribbean. The greate::;t daily fluctuation at all depths wa,s found to be at the time of full and change 1 with a predomi11t:tting easterly flow at the lower stratum.

is the curve of the lower velocities. The observations of two days in the passage north of St. Lucia show the same rule governing the deep fl(nY, and with the exception of Station 5, near Tobago, all the anchorages in the passage between that island and Barbados give like indications. Thei·e can he no doubt that this last-mentioned passage is sometimes completely filled by the shore current, hut it probably occms only after a period of abnormally strong tracle winds blowing frnm a point well to the ea.stward. Evi(fonce of this inc1·eased width was observerl on one occasl<m. Observations were made at Station 20, about 15 miles east of the passage between St. Lucia and St. Vincent, and an average surface Ye1oeity of 1.52 knots wa8 found. T·wenty miles farther to the eastward an anchorage was mat1e on the following day, when the surface current \Yas founa to lw 2.28 knots i-;etting- "\VN"\V. Unfortunately, hax1 weather prevented a continuance of tho ohsornltions l1ovo11d five hours, but the same lHmrs of tlte .. previous day, at Station 20, gave an average of 1.()8 knots. It seem;; prohable that either the general strength of the current 'vas increasing during the time 01· else the change of anchorage placed the vessel nearer the axis. ·Upon steaming to Barbados after getting underway, and abo duriug the passage to St. Lucia. tlie day after, the same strong current was fournl. It was common report among the nautical people at Bridgetown (Barbado:s) that the trade winds were and had_ been blowing with unusual 8trength along the South American coast. This strong current was only supe11!icial, however, for, as ·will be seen from the table, the direction at 130 fathonrn was S. by ,V., with a resultant force of but one one-hunch·edth of a knot toward the passage. These anchorages, Stations 20 and 21, happened to be within one day of highest northern declination, but the mridence does not seem to be in favor of increased strength due to this cause. The drrilv z:ariation 8eems to be well niarked at all the anchorage8 here considered, except at Station 32 north of Barbados. An average of 25 maxima in the passages north and south of St. Lucia and south of Barbados giYe for the "establishment," or the time of the arrival of the maximum cnfftmts, 6 hours and 16 minutes before the transit of the moon. 'rhe two surface cm·rent waves follow almost exactly the same fonn as the curve of the tides. The differences between the daily maximum and minimum currents at the

.

576

UNITED STA'FES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

various stations in the vicinity show the mutual interference of the coast with the drift current. At the stations nearest Barbados the average variation is about one-half knot, at Station 4 it is six-tenths and at Station 5 nearly one knot. In the vicinity of the passage south of St. Lucia a mean of all the daily differences in velocity is seven-tenths of a knot, the greatest being observed just after full and probably it also occurs after new moon. The variation north of St. Lucia was found to be six-tenths of a knot. As we proceed north from the island of .Martinique the iufluence of the coast current on the flow of water through the passages disappears. It is seen between .Martinique and Dorninica only at the surface, where the direction is about "\VN"W., with all the lower currents running to the southward aud westward. Its effect is not observed north of Dominica, where the gentle flow of the drift current, complicated by tidal action, has taken its place. ~ In the Anegada, Mona, and Windward Passages a stea<ly flow is not to be found, but only tidal currents, with an inclination in one dfrection 01· another depending upon local causes. In general, the predominating set in all these passages seems to be outward the eastern and toward the Caribbean on the western sides. The opinion advanced by others that the flow through the Windward Passage is always toward the Caribbean, and that it reaches the bottom as evid~nced by the character of the bottom soil sf>ecimens, is not confirmed by the observations of the actual current. .That it is mostly tidal and feeble in force will be seen from the table below. The directions given are the means of all those falling within the quadrants limited by the intercardinal points. Station 27 is nearest Haiti; Station 28 is near the middle of the passage, and No. 29 is nearest the Cuban shore.

It certainly seems that no large body of water passed through the passage iu either directiou at the time of the observations. The eurreut is evidently tidal, with a <lecidecl prominence of northeasterly directions at Stations 27, 27", and 28, and with a southerly set at Station 29. The feehle current always found, and the diminishing velocities ai.; the depth of observation increased, seem to warrant the conclusion that the flow is only superficial. On the southern side of the Caribbean Sea the currents are appai·ently erratic, and yet they probably are governed by the same laws as elsewhere. Between Grenada and Trinidad, at the time the observations were taken iu 1888, the current at the deep-water sta,tion near the miildle of the passage was found to be setting to the eastward at all depths. A year Jater at tho same anchorage the :flow was in the opposite direction, except at 65 and 130 fathoms, where it changed from \VSW. to NE. and back again. These anchorages happened to be undm· almost identically the same conditions of moou'c; transit, age, distance, parallax, etc., and yet at one the set was alway8 outward and at the other it predominated inward. This passage is peculiarly situated with regard to the two streams composing the Equatorial Cun-ent, and it is probable that on their relative strength the direction of the flow in the Grenada Pasi·mge is determined. At the lower depths there is probably a uornml current setting east. The portion of the drift current which can enter the passage in question meets the coast current at nearly a right angle. If the latter is strong the former is deflected to the northward and the current in the passage is to the eastward at all depths. If, on the other hand, the coast current iH weak, the drift current is able to reach the passage, thus causing a westerly surface current, a tidal current at intermediate depths, and probably an easterly set at the lowest. Of course this is in a measure cornplicated hy the phase of the moon. Between Curacoa and the mainland the eddy subcurrent was strong, constant, and peifectly marked. At an anchorage near the middle of the deep water, the current was northwest as far as 45 fathoms and southeast iJelow that depth. Nearer the mainland, but still in fairly deep water ( 425 fathoms), the northwesterly current, only a stratum of 25 fathoms in thickness, was flowing with a yelocity of 1.87 knots at the surface and O.SS knot

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

579

at 15 fathoms. This eddy subcurrent probably does not reach Grenada, for there is a barrier of shoal water extending to the northward from ~lar garita Islands which would prevent; hut the evidence is that there is a similar eddy current in the deep wa.ter leading to the Grenada Passage, which, together with the relative values of the two streams forn1i11g the equatorial cwTent, rule the direction of the surface current between Grenada and the bank off the Dragon's Mouth of the Gulf of Paria. In the western Caribbea,n, m1chorages were made between Jamaica and Pedro Bank, between the latter and Rosalind Bank, and in the shoal water east of Gorda Bank. The passage between Pedro and Hosalind Banks (Station 37), about 700 futhoms deep in the middle, has a, strong·, shallow current, but its direction is much inclined to the general axis of the clunmeJ. It is a Jl~ut of the flow through the Caribbean, and probably ha:; the same characteristics ~ts the current outside the 'Vindward l::,;laudt1 in the vicinity of St. Lucia. The surface has a direction between west and southwest with considerable velocity. The lower current8 incline more to the northward of west as the depth increases, but the strength is maintained to Gf> fathoms, below which there is a rapid diminution until 200 fathoms is reached, where tidal action appears. On the shoal east of Gorda Bank (Station 38), the direction of tbe flow is nearly at right angles to surface current iu the passage mentioned ahove.

CHAPTER VIL
CA V-SES OF THE GULF STREAM A.,YD OF ATLANTIC CURRENTS.

We have nearly completed the examination of the Gulf Stream observations taken in the Blake under my command, and it seems proper to take up the question of causes of the Atlantic currents before drawing conclusions for the benefit of "those who go down to the sea in ships." The facts which I have obtained may not prove positively what these causes are, but in the personal experiences of five years' work, watching the winds and waves and observing the currents, there are many things which may be considered as indicating very decidedly what it is that produces and keeps in motion these vast bodies of water. It is necessary to an understanding of the subject to recapitulate some of the prorn.inent theories which have been advpcated. Although there were many ideas advanced before the time of Franklin, he seems to have be.en the first to give his theories widespread publication. He says: This stream is probably generated by the great accumulation of water on the eastern coast of America between the tropics by the trade winds which blow there. It is known that a large piece of water, 10 miles broad and generally only 3 feet deep, has by a strong wind had its waters driven to one side and sustained so aR to become 6 feet deep while the windward side was laid dry. This' may give son1e idea of the quantity heaped upon the American coast and the reason of its running down in a strong current through the islands into the Bay of Mexico. Humboldt published in 1814 a description of the Gulf Stream, in which he says it is not the same at all seasons of the year, but that its force and direction depend to a large ex.tent upon the changes in the trades, and also that the general torpidity of the ice in the Arctic in the winter and its melting in the summer influences it. He says also: Considering the velocity of the fluid elements, which in different latitudes in consequence of the earth's rotation is different,

581

one should be tempted to think that every current from south to north ought to have at the same time a tei1dency to the east, and vice versa, a current from north to south a tendency to the west. Arago advocateu the same theory in part. He says thatWith respect to currents, the rotation of the earth ought principally to be taken into view, and this, together with the cooling and the warming of the water in the north and south, is the main cause of their morn rapid or slower deviation and progress toward the eaRt or west. * * * "\Ve ought t.o apply to the ocean the same theory which has already afforded a satisfactory explanation to the trade winds if we will decipher the question of currents. Lieutenant Maury, at the time of the publication of the last edition of the ''Physical Geography of the Sea," was without doubt one of the hardest students and the most popular writer on the subject of the air and ocean. Many of his conclusions were entirely new and antagonized the ideas of others. At first glance he seems to attribute ocean circulation in part to forces which act diametrically opposite, viz, evaporation, whereby the specific gravity is increaseq on the surface near the equator, and heat, whereby its density is diminished; but later he expresses his conviction that-

If we except the tides and the partial currents of the sea, such as those caused by winds, we may lay it dmvn as a rule that all tho currents of the ocean owe their origin to difference of specific gravity between sea water at one place and sea water at another; for wherever there is such a difference, whether it be owing to difference of temperature or to difference of saltness, etc., it iR a difference that disturbs equilibrium, and currents are the consequence.
His belief was that while local currents might be caused by winds, rain, barometric pressure, etc., differences of density caused .the grand circulation of the ocean. Prof. C. Wyville Thomson has been a member of several scientific expeditions fitted out by the British Government on board H. l\f. S. Porcupine and Lightning in the years in 1868-'69 and '70, and in the famous Challenger expedition from 1873 to 1876. In both, the investigation as far as currents were concerned was mainly confined to the most accurate determination of temperatures, specific gravity, depth, and character of bottom

582

UNITED ST.A.TES COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

specuuens, from which P1·ofessor Thomson has drawn conclusions as to ocean circulation. He says, in "The Depths of the Sea," on this subject: The investigation i8 one of singular difficulty. Some currents are palpable enough, going at a rate and with a force which make it easy to detect them and even comparatively easy to gauge their volume and define their p~tth ; but it seems that the great movements of the water of the ocean, those which produce the most important results in the tram:;fer of temperature and the modification of climate, are not of this character. Tho:,::e moxc so slowly, that their surface movement is constanth- masked by the drift of variable winds, and they thus produce Ho~seusihle effect upon navigation. The path ancl limits of such bodies of water can only be determined by the use of the thermomett·r. The equalizing of the temperature of bodies of water in contact with one another and differently heated, by conduction, diffusion, and mixture, is, however, so slow, that we usually have hut little difficulty in distingnh·ldng currents from different sources. rrhis statement, in my opinion, is in the main true; for without doubt warm ocean water must come from the equatorial and cold water from the polnr regions, and, whatever may be the cause of the transf~r, the modification of climate js due to the presence of the water and not to the method of its delivery. Professor Thomson says:

By the Gulf Stream I mean that mass of heated water which pours from the Straits of Florida across the, North Atlantic, and likewise a wider but less defined warmer current, mridently fonning a part of the same great movement of water, which curves northw~ml to the eastward of the West Indian l81ands. I am myself inclined without hesitation to regard this stream as simply the reflux of the equatorial CWTent, added to, no doubt, during its northeaRterly course, by the surface drift of the aJ.lti-tra<les, which follow in the main the same direction.
Of the Gulf Stream he says : It seems to me that the Gulf Stream is the one natural phenomenon on the surface of the earth whose origin and principal cause, the drift of the trade winds, can be most easily traced. He conS!ludes that this whole flow, upon reaching the westem shores .of Europe and not :finding a ready exit to the northward, banks down, filling

UNITED STA.TES CO.AST AND GEODE:i'lO SURVEY.

583

the Northwestern Atlantic to a considerable extent. Owing to this resist~nce a portion of the current turns southward toward the Azores, while the accumulation to the northward forces an eddy current of colder water to the southward. The genern1 bottom circulation he supposes comes from the southern oceans. The southe1·n hemisphere is chiefly \Yater, ·vhile the northern includes most of the land. 'rhe Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans, therefore, are merely hays of the great water hemisphere. Later he says:

Over the central part of the water hemisphere, precipitation is certainly greatly in excess of evaporation, while the reverse is the case in its extension to the northwai·d. The water is therefore carried off by evaporation from the northern portion of the Atlantic and the Pacific, and the vapor is hurried down toward the great zone of low barometric pressure in the southern hemisphere, the heavy cold water welling up from the southward into the deepest parts of the northward-extending ti·oughs to which it has free access, to replace it.

In effect, Professor Thomson's theories are that the surface currents are chiefly caused by wind drift, and that the lower currents are caused by unequal evaporation. The most recent exponent of the specific gravity theory is Dr. Carpenter, who we,s a colleague of Professor Thomson on the scientific cruises of the Porcupine and Li,qhtning. He based his belief largely upon the temperature observations of these expeditions, and upon the results of his examination of the current in the Strait of Gibraltar. In a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society, in 1870, to illustrate his ideas, he supposes two basins, one under equatorial conditions and the other under polar, connected by a strait:
The effect of the heat of the tropical basin will be for the most part limite.d to its up1)ermost stratum, and may here be practically disregarded. But the effect of the surface cold upon the ·water of the polar basin will be to reduele the temperature of its whole mass below the freezing point of fresh water, the mrface stratum sinking as it is cooled, by virtue of its diminished bulk and increased density, and being replaced by water not yet cooled to the same degree. The warmer water will not come up from below * * * but will be drawn into the basin from the surface of t11e surrounding area; and since what is thus drawn away must be supplied from a

yet greater distance, the continual cooling of the surface stratum in the polar basin will caus_e a set of water towarcl it to be propagated backward (so to speak) through the whole intervening ocean in cmnmunication with it until it reaches the tropieal area. rrhis is practically the theory of Lieutenant Maury expressed more in det<til. To repeat the oft-told story of -the Mediterranean circulation is unnecessary. Dr. Carpenter eonsiders that it aptly illustrates the whole system of· ocean currents. He says: The vertical circulation is maintained in the Strait of Gibraltar by the excess of evaporation in the Mediterranean over the amount of fresh water returned into its basin, which at the same time lowers it:,; level and increases its density, so that the surface inflow of salt water which restores the level (exceeding, by the weight of salt contained in it, the weight of fresh water which has }Jassed off by evaporation) disturbs the equilibrium and produces a deep outflow, which in its turn lowers the level. * * * Circulation must, on the same principles, be maintained between polar and equatorial waters by the difference of their temperatures; the level of the polar water being reduced and its "density increased by the surface cold to which it is subjected, w11ilst a downward motion is also imparted to each stratum successively exposed to it, and the level of equatorial water being raised and its density · diminished by the surface heat to which it is exposed. * * * Thus a movement will be imparted to the upper stratum of oceanic water from the equator toward the poles, whilst a movement will be imparted to the deeper stratum from the poles to the equator. It is difficult to reconcile this reasoning with what seems to me the actual state of the case. The Mediterranean is lowered by the excess of evaporation over the precipitation, and an inward surface current caused at Gibraltar. The ocean surface current, on the other hand, chiefly flows from the point where the evaporation is greatest toward the point where there is an excess of precipitation. Dr. Carpenter claims, however, that the difference of ocean level is from the difference of expansion due to heat. Without doubt there is a difference in expansion, but it is a question whether he is correct on the matter of level. The temperature of the ocean in the vicinity of the equator reaches 37° at a depth of about 1,000 fathoms, below which the changes are slight

to the bottom. The surface has a temperature not far from 80°. The expansion of the sea water due to this change in temperature iR about .005, which for the column of 1,000 fathoms would be about 30 feet, giving a grade from the equator to the poles of about six one-hundredths of one incl1 to a mile. It would seem as if this infinitesimal difference might be easily obliterated by the excess of evaporation at one place and of precipitation at the other. In the immediate vicinity of the equator the rains are con:o;iderable, hut it is without question that in both hemispheres the rainfall is least within the limits of the trade winds, outside of which it increases somewhat with the latitude. Of the total annual rainfall most of it i;; evaporated from the ocean direct, in latitudes lower than the thirty-fifth parallel. Tlrnre must therefore be much more than the average taken from. the equatorial belt and much more than the average deposited in the polar regions where the evaporation is but trifling, so that instead of an equatorial elevatiou from the expansion o{ the sea water by heat there ought to be a ten<leuc y toward depression due to evaporation. Mr. J. J. Wild, one of the scientific staff of the Challenger expedition, seems to imply in "'l"'halassa" that he is a believer in the ·wind theory as the cause of ocean currents, but he says as a last word on the subject: The southern ocean is the main feeder of its three gigantic offshoots-the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the Indian Oceans-which it supplies through the medium of both surface and under currents. The former, driven by the westerly winds against the west coasts of Africa, Australia, and South America, are driven northward toward the equator; the latter, piled up by the rotating earth against the east coasts of these continents, flow as uuder currents in the same direction, both entering as warm currents toward their old home, the pole. I confess that I am unable to fully understand the meaning of Mr. Wild in ithBr of these statements. Most authorities agree, and, indeed, Mr. Wild i;pves an illustration showing it, that the west coasts of Africa and Australia are included within the limits of the trade winds or the belt of calms. It therefore does not appear how the westerly winds can cause the surface currents which he mentions. The same difficulty is experienced in the matter of the subcurrents which are said to be caused by the earth's rota-

tion piling up the water on the east coasts, for Africa and South America, at least, present a wrong angle to allow the escape of water from this cause alone to flow in the direction of the equator. At this day, after so many thinking men have investigated and have written on the subject of ocean physics, particularly on the Gulf Stream, and have advanced and advocated every possible t110ory as to the causes of currents, the only question for a new explorer t,D decide is toward whicl1 . of the ranks will his own research lead him to incline. We have seen that the two prominent theories are, first, surface drift, due to permanent or semi-permanent winds, and, second, gravity, due. to differences of density of sea water. I place myself with those who a(kocate the wind theory as the chief cause of the Gulf Stream proper and of most ocean currents, but to diffe!-'ences in density we may attribute some variations in surface indications of the current. The prime mover, however, is generally wind, and I think my observations ~f the currents <luring the past five years will add much weight to the theory. The winds, of which the trades are the most permanent, act in two ways to produce a surface movement. The friction of the air causes the particles of water with which it is in contact to move in its direction. Friction between the particles transmits the motion from layer to layer with a co:itinua11y diminishing force as the depth increases. Prof. Alexander Agassiz says in his recent publication, "Three cruises of the Blake:" Theoretically it has been calculated by Boeppritz that 100~000 years is ample time to allow the friction of the particles to extend from the surface to the bottom, say 2,000 fathoms, were the winds to blow without intermission in one direction during that time with the average power they are known to possess. tl1e trade winds predominate in a westerly direction they do change sufficiently to prevent any great depth of current, even if there were no other conditions to prevent its consummation. In the Eastern Atlantic they incline much more toward the equator than they do in the western partst and any currents established by these winds will, by their inertia, attempt to continue in the same course, and will be less&ned in velocity by the cUITents produced by winds from other directions with which they may

come in contact. That there are other causes tending to prevent any great depth of the frictional current is evident from the replrts of skillful navigators, who haYe, in the midst of the region of the trade winds and at points where usually a drift cu1Tent is to be reckoned upon, found a reverse set. Thfo is generally a local influence, extending oYer a small space and for a short interval, but still, every such instance tends to break up or le:-;1'un the pe1·sistency of the flow and to diminish the depth of the frictioual current. The waves formed by the wind carry water to leeward, by the pressur<~ of the wind on the back of the wave, which causes each particle near tho surface to advance to a greater or let'iser extent during each oscillation. This, in effect, is an increase of the frictional current and not readily tlisti11guish~ aLle from it. It is, however, a very shallow movement, depending upon the height of the 'vaves and the strength of the wind. Another and far greater cause of the set to leeward is the ln·eak of tlH· wave. Every ripple as it topples over sends a, portion of its crest a ce1iai11 distance in the direction of its travel, and, in a gale, tons of water drive a hundred or two feet to leeward in a few seconds. Upon meeting an obstnwtion the water must either come to a stop or escape in the line of least resistance. The frictional cun·ent, upon reaching shoal water, becomes less tLnd less m; the friction on the hottom heconws grea.ter. If the obstruction is at right angles to the course of the current there is a stoppage, an escape of a portion at the sides, aw1 a reverse' ullllercurrent. A current of this character does not seem to run readily over i-lwal water1 the interference of the bottom quickly retarding it. The experiern·<~ of our anchorage on the outside of the Grenadine Bank showed a set h(;hnH_m southeast and southwest, which is parallel to the general trend of the shrn11Although the Sal Key Bank, in the Straits of Florida, is in the direct line of the current, there is only the eblJ and flow of the tides over it.

The action of the onward movement. of the wave in causing tlw particles of its upper stratum to move in the same direction has been strongly

impressed upon my mind during the past five years. When at anchor the surface currents were always observed with the meter at a depth of 3~ fathoms, and also by an ordinary log line, using a weighted pole instead of the "chip." This pole was 21 feet long and 3 inches in diameter, weighted at its lower end so that but 6 inches of its length would show out of the water in a smooth sea, and with this slight amount of surplus _buoyancy every wave would go over it. When there happened to be a light current and a fresh wind the vessel would ride to the latter, while the pole, from its small exposed surface above water and its deep draft would tail to the former. As the seas would roll over the pole it always disappeared in an upright position, but when it appeared again its upper end waR alvrnys inclinell in the direction of the traveling wave. This continual knocking or pushing to leeward caused the direction of the current as observed by this means to be an erroneous record, depending in amount on the relative strength and direction of the current and the velocity and height of the wave. The current meter suspended below the wave influence, to which the upper end of the pole was subjected, generally gave a direction from one to three points to windward of that given by the pole. As long as there are waves there is a quantity of water going slowly to leeward by this means. A far greater amount, however, is being thrown violently in the same direction by the break of the sea, and unlike the frictional current it reaches to the very shore. The accumulation of water escapes by the line of least resistance. If the sea is directly on shore, with no chance of lateral e~cape, a reverse undercurrent is caused. This is noticed where the water is shoal by a deep draft and heavily laden vessel being set to windward, where a light draft vessel will he thrown on shore. Harbors are fi.llecl by this accumulation and the tides made very irregular. In the great hurricane at Samoa, which caused such destruction of life and property, the amount of water thrown into the harbor of Apia produced tremendous currents, not only along the beaches and reefs, but setting directly out of the harbor, and this assistance to the great engine power of H. M. S. CaUiope may have turned the balance and rendered her escape from destruction possible. How many times do we read in the accounts of wrecks on shore of the great velocity

of the currents. All along the shores of Long Island and New Jersey the fishermen report abnormal currents at times when the wind is blowing strong tow~1l'd the land. Thm;e are caused, I believe, simply by the escape of the accumulated water thrown by_ the waves, and do not extend far off shore. I doubt if a single ordinary gale will produce an ocean tMrrent having a velocity of one-half knot per hour, and any current that is formed will he very shallow. The gulf weed, so called, shows the effect of the break of the waves. I ts home is the Sargasso Sea, near the northern edge of the trade 1vind region. Transported chiefly by the waves, it is found entering the Caribbean in the passages nOl'th of Guadeloupe, and is in greater quantities north of the 'Vest Indian falands. In large masses, it acts like oil on the water to still the waves, and consequently the break of the sea can only detach fragments from the edges of the mass. As a rule it is seen streaming in Ionµ; lines in the direction of the waves and not in the direction of the curre11t unless the .latter is very strong. In this case it accumulates at a point 1vhere there is a, rip or a changµig current in the same way that drift collects at the edge of an advancing tidal current. The fact of meeting it in strange regions is not necessarily an indication of a current, but that the wind has caused a sea which has thrown the weed to leeward. The influence of the wind to transport the water without an accompanying current is seen in Key West. With a strong southerly wind the ~lear water from the Gulf Stream is thrown into the harbor in spite of au ebb tide, but upon a change of wind from the gulf, its water quickly clouds that of the harbor. Along the edge of the reefs in 20 fathoms, with the wind from the southward, the bottom can easily be seen. The Gulf Stream water has been thrown in by the waves, but the current maintains its normal position. What, then, is the action of the wind in causing the Gulf Stream 't In the tropical regions east of the continent of America, the northeast and southeast trade winds are continually blowing, with an interval of calms between them. The southeast trades accumulate a mass of water on the South American coast, causing a shore current in both directions from Cape St. Roque. The volume of the northern branch (the Guyana current) for

a considerable portion of the year is probably not as great as the accumulation of water thrown against the coast of South America by the northeast trades. The frictional currents of each of these drift streams will be shallow, but meeting each other, as they do, at quite an angle, the resultant velocity will not be the sum of the two. The act of impinging on the coast will give the combination a reduced value, and will form a counter subcurrent running to the eastward, the strength of which will depend upon the velocity and upon the angle of the curreut:s with the coast. The coast current thus formed sets toward the Windward Islands with varying ::itreugth, and, having received its final impulse, leaves the farthest point of its restraining shore (the Island of Tobago) with a course about NNW. The frictional current of the northeast trades has, in the mean time, been sending a certain amount of surface current toward the. Windward Islands, and the two join forces southwest of Barbados. The ·flow then is through the passages between the islands, the strongest being iu the one :south of St. Lucia, and lessening in velocity in the others as the latitude of the passages increases. During the winter months the northeast trades blow from a more uorthed y direction than they do during the summer, a1id at the same time they extend farther towaru the equator. rrhe observations taken 011 board the Blake were during this period, and no evidence was found that the coast current maintains its integrity as a separate current after it encounters the drift of the northeast trades, but there was every indication of a return subcurre11t extending even into the southeastern Caribbean. At the stations outside the St. Lucia Passage the lower currents tended east and south; north of Barbados S. by E., and between that island and Tobago there was generally some indication of a deflection to the eastward. In the deep passage between the Leeward Islands and the mainland it was east below the surface stratum, while south of Grenada the same easterly set was observed at the greater depths. This all tends to show that in thG escape of the accumulation, the surface goes to leeward, while some of the water of the lower stratum returns in a reverse direction. During the summer months the southeast trades reach farther. t,o the westward along the South American coast, while the northeast trade winds

although not extending so far south, have a more easterly direction. There is therefore a larger body of water transported at this season from the African shore into the North Atlantic, and consequently the Guinea current is stronger and extends farthest west, reaching in August, according to Findlay, as far as the forty-fifth meridian. This, I believe, shows simply cause and effect. The inc1·eased volume of the accumulation of water from the south, and the mo1·e easterly direction of that from the north, both tend to produce the reverse subcurrent which appears on the surface farther to the eastward as the Guinea current. The average of all the westerly flow between the islands from St. Vincent to Antigua gives a volume equal to about one-half that fouu<l i11 the narrowest part of the Straits of Florida. '\Ve have seen from the discu::,;sion of the observations of the currents in the Anegada, Mona and "\Vindwar<l passages, that the volume entering the Caribbean through these entrances, is little if any in excess of the outflow. What theu can account for the other halfl I am convinced that it is the water thrown to leeward by the waves, and ·does not appear as a current while it i8 in transit, except indirectly by the assi8tance it gives to the frictional cun·ent. The total width of the passages south of Antigua is available for the entrance of water by this means, whereas the drift current of the trades is confined to the deeper portions only. The waves dash over shoals where a drift current can not flow. The former then have about three times the available space for entrance that the latter has, and, when we include the broader passages to the westward, we can realize what an enormous quantity of water may enter the sea whenever there is a wind to cause a wave. Once in the Caribbean, every wave formed gives the surface current an additional push by its momentum, so that by the time the Western Caribbean southwest of .Jamaica is reached, the :fl.ow has greater velocity than in any of the passages between the Windward Islands or at any of the anchorages outside the islands, with the exception of those near Tobago, which are in the full strength of the Guyana cIDTent. We have thus followed the water, driven by the vis a tergo of the trade winds from the coast of Africa to the Yucatan Channel, from which it flows into the Gulf of }lexico and through the Straits of Florida iuto the Atlantic.

'Ve will leave it for the present to faquire whether there is any force to n-ssist it on its march toward the European coast. It is true the Guyana current is but trifling in volume or velocity in comparison with the Gulf Stream as it issues from the Straits of Florida. But seeing, as we have, what a comparatively short distance the former is projected from its confining bank, one is led to agree with those who doubt whether even so large a body as the Gulf Stream can be driven very far toward the coast. of Europe by the vis a tergo of the trades without the assistance of some force in the northern Atlantic. It seems evident that two contributions are to Knll'W 0· , be found which tend to force the Gulf Stream ' onward.

In fact the whole system of 1vinds in / ~ l ...! 'II0 the North Atlantic tends to produce an oval-shaped t i I flow, with the region known as the "horse lati! I tudes" at the major axis. We have direct evidence of the flow outside the West Indian Islands in the 1110 · observations taken on the line between Great I I Abaco Island, Bahama, and the extremity of Cape c I Hatteras Shoals.

were it not for the fact that the observations at the outside station off Cape Hatteras show the direct effect of the impingement of one 011 the other. At the time of the observation at Station 6, Section F, the full wiJth of the Stream proper ·did not extend as far off shore, and there was an eddy surface current between it and the current coming from outside the islands. The eddy current was but super£cial (see Fig. 10), and the outside current showed itself as a subcurrent setting iu the nor- I 1.w.-·M!L- N.L I ( mal direction of the Stream. The question arises, why did it not appear on the surface and increase ' the visible velocity of the Gulf Stream. The ! answer to this is because its density was less. In order to avoid repetition, the cause of the l!iO alternations in temperature of the Gulf Stream is inserted here, as it is necessary in its discussion to enter upon the question of differences of denFig. io. 1 sity. There has been a great deal of speculation and surmise ou the imbject of the alternations of warm and cold bands in the Stream, the exi8tonco of which Professor Bache established as beyond a doubt. He was led to believe that they are caused by irregularities in the ocean bed over which the current flows. The soundings on which he based this belief,vere made with rope or registering apparatus, neither of which is valuable in (ltmp water or ~n th~ presence of a strong current. By more improved methods it has been shown that the ocean is not <liYided into hill8 and val1Pys along our coast. At one place off South Carolina there is a spot on the subn1ari11~ plateau which has a depth of about 50 fathoms grenfor than the water outside of it, but it seems very doubtful if this can cause n variation in temperature off Cape Hatteras or still farther to the eastward, where the current certainly does not. reach the bottom, nor <·ould it. cause the :fluctuatio~ found in the temperature at points farther to the south toward the Straits of Florida.

It h:u; bueu thought that the cause was to be found in an opposing cold counter-cur:reut forking out the warmer water into bands or ribbons. It iR possible that thi:'.'i may be the case where two currents are direct1y opposed, hut there is no evidence that there is a cold current flowing in a direction opposite to the portion of the Gulf Stream along our coast, and even if such a current doe8 exist, it does not seem to he probable that it can fork the Stream into gra1.lually conTergiug lines which maintain their relative posi- · tion throughout and follow the curves and turning of the Stream its whole length. As l)efore stated, the warm water upon approaching Europe is divide(l into two parts l)y the obstruction it meets. As the uorthen1 extension approaches tlte Arctie regions it is probably more or less forked by alte1nationH j11 the tcmp<·rature, fin· the following reasons: The warm water of the Gulf Stream from its ~renter hmit is of very much less uensity than the polar water, hut, owing to the superior amount of saline matter held in solution, jt Jms :t greater i'!peciric grnvhy. At a certaill time in its progress northwanl it has eoolur1 i-;ufficieutly to hriug its <lernsity down to that of its opponent, and at the same times il'i actually warmer. A fall of another degruu makes its de11Hity even 1e;.;s than the other, at which time the polar wuter gnin1' tlie ascendeuey arn1 ;.;]ip14 over the ·wanner, the two strata arranging tliemselves aeeordiug to their relative weightR. For example, the e<piat.m·ial flow may luwe a density of l.Oi7 at a temperature of 3(:) 0 arnl the opposing Arctic current at 32° a density of 1.028. The latter heing the heavier assumes a lower position, hut when the former has Jost something of its heat it becomes the heavier, and, although still at a higher temperature tlmn the other, it seeks a lower level. The whole width of the opposing waters is considerable and the different parts are under varying conditions.

well as others, the position, the (lepth, and the angle of the liirn \~f nweting is continually changing. In the case of our eqmitorial water meeting the polar, both being under theRe variahfo l~mulitions, t11e sma11 differenevs in dm1sity will determine vvhieh water will overriile the other, and thus prodn<'e the alternations iu the temperature at the Arctic eud of the liue. rrliat tlw alternations exist hoth horizuutally and vertically is almrnlantly proved. Prof. H. ~Iohn, the scientific heafl of the "Voringen" expedition found on the dividing line between the Atlautie and Aretie water very many instances of a1teruations in temperature vertically, the warm and eold layers of water being repeated between the surface and the Lottom, or to some intermediate depth.

of Florida to beyond the liue between Bermuda an<l Halifax. Not only arc the altcrnatiomi found within the supposed limits of the Stream, but they are also both inside and outside of it. They are shown graphically in an illustrntion prepared by Professor Bache, illustration No. 3 7. Another example of the_ actual changes in temperature at about four feet below the ~mrface ii> to lF~ seen in illustration No. 54. These observations were take11 ou board the Blake with a thermometer, which, by an electric current, auto- · matically recorded the temperature continuously. The positions of the various bamh agree fairly with thm;e of Professor Bache. It is seen on both these plate::; that there are :fluctuations imside the Stream, off New York, for example (illu::;tration. No. 5 7), where, according to all belief, there is a current setting to the t>outlnvard. There i::; certainly uo northeasterly current in the vicinity of the inside warmer band extending from Cape Canaveral along the 100-fathom curve to Nantucket. The cause of this one at least can not be a cold current opposing a wann one. In _running liiws of soundings, as the writer has, normal to the coast as far as the 100-fathom curve, and at intervals from Cape Hatteras to beyond George's Bank, it has been generally noticed that in the vicinity of a depth of from. 40 to 80 fathoms, the temperature of the water :mcldeuly changes, the colder being a1ways t(1Lm<l on the laud side. It is very marked on George's Ba,nk, and is probably due to the cold water from the outside being forced ou the shoal by the advancing tidal impulse. It is generally conceded that this tidal impulse is in direction about normal to the coast of the United States, from the fact of ih1 arrival at the salient points of the contiueut at the Rame hour. The Gulf Stream's course is at right angles to this advance. I believe that to this we may loo~ for the cause of the lesser thermometrical variations, and that they are due to an interference of ~uc cessive tidal impulses meeting the obstruction of the shore, whereby a vibratory motion i1' produced on the ocean's surface. This motion causes the altenrntion by what might be called attenuation and c01~densation of . the warmer temperature; that is, in the .former the surface stratum of warm water be~omes thin, and the colder lower stratum rising, tfie temperature of the vertical column is lowered. In the latter the reverse operation takes place.

The differences are more abrupt when the extremes of temperature are closest together; that is, in a shallow hot current or on the northern border of the Stream. They are less noticeable north of the cmTeut because the differences between the surface and lower temperatures are not so great, and consequently tho intermingling of the surface and lower waters can not reduce the temperatures to so great an extent. The t<ame is true south of the Stream, because the current is warm. to a great depth, and also, because the vibrations diminish in intensity 'as the distance from the land increases. These alternations probably will be found on every coast ·where there is a warm Rnrface cun-en!., if the trend 0f the land is nearly at right angles to tlie direction from which the tirlal impulse comes. To return now to the cuffent off Cape Hatteras. The current outsitle the Bahamas curves to the nortlnvard as it meets the resistance of tlw crn1st. Its line of meeting the Gulf Strearn proper varies in position because the latter changes its position accordii1g to the forces acti11g upon it. Tlw width of the Streaf1:1 off Cape Hatteras, however, is such thnt one of the cold bands is near the average position of its southern edge. "\Vhen the outside current meets the Gulf Strearr1 and the edge of the lattc>r is to the northwar<l of this cold hand, the temperature of the lattt·r will be lowered awl it will underruu the former. In the curve of surface temperatures tak<~n between Cape Henry and the Anegada Pa!'Rage (ilhrntrntion No. 54) it will be noticed that there is an abrupt rise at leaving tlie l 00-fathom curve above Cape Hatteras and a fall at a distan<'e of about 35 miles outside. This is the Gulf Stream it~mlf. It is 1mver in tempera.ture than the water next outside of it, althougl1 coming frmn thn Caribbean, because its strong currents aro continually changing in direction (as descrilwd in Chapter V.) and intermingling its waters from the smface to the bottom layer. 'I'he high temperatures just outside the Stream are from the wnters which have swung around from the higlrnr part of the curvP in the Yiciuity of the Islands, the southerly portion with itl'I high tflrnperatnre corning next to the Stream. It is ~varmer than the Stream because ·its currents are R1ow, and are not inte1fered with by the bottom or ~ixed by excessive changes i11 direction. We have no means of knowing the ·width of this outside current except by taking the width of tl1e higher fluctuations in temperature

Approaching the 8hores of Europe the drift current meets an obstruction nearly at l·ight angles to its course, and the "banking down" menti.oned by Sir \Vyville Thomson takes place. A similar banking down is also seen in the temperatures of Station 44, on the coast of the United States, where the outside trade-wind current meets the obstruction of the continent. The

latter escapes to the right inasmuch as that is the only ~ffenue left open. The hanking dmvu on the shores of Europe has room to escape both to the northward and to the southward. Tlrn set to the northward, how(~Yer, quickly encounters opposition in the Polar Sea, hnt is strong enough to overcome the obstacle and force the colder water before it to escape hy tlw Labrador current. This current is :mid to partly uwlenun the Gulf Stream, and partly to flow as a countercurrent inside the Stream along the coasts of NoYa Scotia aud the United States. The countercurrent is certainly very feeble. Practically the i:nain body of the.current underruns the Stream, and, intermingling with its vrnters, joins the southern branch in its tlow pa.st the Azores and along the African coast. This braneh is at>sisted on the way by the prevailing winds of that region, for the westerly \vinds gradually change in direction and merge into the northeast trade wind8. 'Ve must now examine the question as to whf'ther there is a Rerndhle elevation of the water in any part of the Gulf Stream\; flmv. The most accurate levels between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans have probal>ly heen run by the Panama Canal Company in the construetion of the canal across the Isthmus. The result is in favor of the superior elevation of the Atlantic by about three-quarters of an inch, ·which difference may posRihly be attributed to errors of observation. At Nicaragua, the levels run hy tlw promoters of that canal have been of too rough n natur{~ to <letermine sma11 differences, and therefore the two oceans are considered to lw on the Rame mean level. The actual result, howt>ver, was sti11 in favor of tlw Carihhean Sea being the highest. Tho reported difference of abont 40 inches in lernl between the Gulf of Mexico at Biloxi, Mississippi, and the ocean at Sandy Rook i8 prohably largely in excess of the ~Lctual difference, hut at the same time it i8 probably a fact that the former is considernbly higher than the latter. An accurate line has been run by the U. S. Coast arnl Oeoddic Survey from Sandy Hook to St. Louis, Missouri. The levdti from the Gn1f of 1\fexico to St. Louis were executed in part by the Missfasippi Hi.-er Commission, a small portion by the U.S. Coast aml Geodetic Survey, and another part by the U. S. Army as far as Lake Pontchartrain, which wa8 said to be at the same level.as the Gul£ The fact of the conectness of the total difference

In the western Caribbean at Jamaica, and also on the coast.east of Yucatan and Honduras, the winds during the summer months have the most sou~ng in them, thus sending a great quantity of water toward the Y neat.an Passage. Most writers agree that the velocity of the Stream increases during the laW~r part of the yefll". ~indlay places· the strongest current in .the ·winter

months, but other writers state that its maximum flow is at the end of August or at the commencement of September. The evidence is, that the periodic changes of level of the Gulf of Mexico follow the changes in the trade winds, the highest level coming at the time when the winds are throwing the greatest amo'unt of water into the western Caribbean, and that the yenrl y variatiOn in the Gulf Stream's velocity follows this change in the level of the Gulf of Mexico. I am led to the belief that the prevailing winds of the ocean raise the level of the sea on the leeward ~oasts, and, if. we could but measure it, we should find that the Gulf of Mexico and western Caribbean are higher than the western Atlantic; that the Atlantic south of Cape Hatteras iti above the level of the ocean northeast of that Cape; that on the northern European coast it is higher than at Labrador and Newfoundland; and, lastly, that on the tropical African shores the sea is lower than the same latitudes in South America. Prnbabl y, however, all of these differences are very small except that of the Gulf of Mexico. The effect of atmospheric pressure on the surface of the ocean is to force or crowd the wate' away from the point of greatest to one of less pressure, thus cam~ing a depression at the first and an elevation of the i:mrface at the second place. In the case of two well-defined areas of high and 101v barometer over the deeper parts of the ocean there can be no great transfe1· of wa,ter from one to the other. The pressure exerted at one spot simply causes a rise at the other depending upon the relative size and differences of weight ,of the two, and the actual movement of water is along the bottom and is about equal to the amount of the rise. There is probably a trifling flow outward on the surface at the point of highest pressure arid an inward flow at the center of the lowest pressure, but this surface influence can hardly have time euoqgh to extend to any great distance, as the force exerted is but temporary. In .a partially confined body of water the case is different. \Vhile the elevation of water at the point of low pressure is no greater, the transfer of the water into or out of the confined body from the point of high pressure can not take place without an increase of velocity through the connecting strait. The Gulf of Mexico is a confined sea and is so placed that variations

in the pressure between that exerted on its surface and on the ·western Atlautic causes a considerable retardation or acceleration of the current. rrhe How generally takes the direction of the Atlantic because the harometrie variations in that ocean are very much in excess of those in the Uarihbean. A difference of 1 inch in the barometric column, or a.bout one-half ponrnl in atmospheric pres.;ure, i.vill give over 1 foot difft~rence iu tlw 0len1-tin11 of the snrfoce of thn Rea. \Vhen '"'e consi(for what tlrn volume ]s 'vhich it may he necessary to supply to or take away from the Gulf of Mexico, we can inmgine what abnormal variations there must be in the Yelocity of the c,urrent in the Straits of Florida. rrhe study of the obtiervations seems to show that the \·;eaker pmis of the currents are :firRt i11flnencec1; that is, the bottom currents and at the side~ particularly on the left. It is exactly the same~ condition of affairs as is fom1d at the entrnnces of irntny rl-vers, lmrhors, and sounds. Upon the arrival of the flood wave the current slips into the harhor along the bottom and at the sides, while the chb current is still running on the Rurface in the midd1e. If the barometer is high in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras the pressure on the surface of the ~cean probahly elevates it in the neighhorhoocl of the northern end of the Straits of Flo1.j(fa and rt!t:mls the lffwer currents. A lnw barometer in the Gulf of Mexico has tlw same effect, and a high barometer in the Gulf acts in the opposite direction. To explain the action of the variations in prmisurc wo will examine some of the actual ohservationf'i thought to he abnormal from tJ1is cause. The oh:-lervations in the Straits of Florida in 1885 were apparently quite free from the influence of unusual atmospheric pressure. Observations wne in progress from May 7 to 14 at Station 1. On May 10 and 11 a sma11 Atlantie storm was reported east of Cape Hatteras, with a maximum barometer of 29.f)I), but it does not Reem to have affected the currents off Cape Florida. On the 13th, however, a low area appeared off the s~uthern coast, disappearing to the northward on the 15th, with a wiml of 50 mi1es an hour at Block Island. 'rlie currents on the 14th were abnormal at all depths, but particular1:r on the surface where the current was very great. Station F was occupied February 28 and March 1, 1886. The averages in

knots of all the observations at each depth were: 3~ fathoms 2.90, 15 fathoms l.8G, 30 fathoms 1.81, 6!) fathoms 1.4~, and at 130 fathoms a southerly Het with a v<·locity of 0 1 18. Just preceding the time of the:-;o ob:;;ernttirn1" the harometer ·was very low in the Gulf of 1\fexico, the lowest marling for the month at the Coast Stations east of New Orleans being on tlw 27th arnl 2Rth. In the Atlantic there was a st<trm center in the vicinity of N ewfourn1lawl from l\Iarch 1 to 5, 'vith a high harnmeter to the weshv;ml. The high pressure outside arnl the low presslffO in the Gulf of Me.xico nnitti1l in eau:-:ing the reyen;e current at 130 fathoms df"pth. 'l'he cornlitions ltarl 1wen so long co11tinued that all the w·loeitfos w<·re ahnut a knot less than the!- shoulil have heen. Station 11 ·vnts occupied April 30 and May l. The cnffent at 130 fa.tlwms was southerly for about 18 hours, and then change1l to northerly on .May 1, increas]ng considerably in force. At 65 fathoms the niloeity :;tendily increased dm·ing the ancl1omge. The lowest hnrometer f(H" the month 0f Ap1·il at all the Signal Service stations in the Gnlf of }\J exico occurred on April 27, 28, aml 29, 'vith the exception only of KPy 'Yest. This ext(msive and slo,-f moving area of low pressure was the evi<lent em1su of the almormal subcurrent. On May 2 the currents had not retm·Heil to normal, as was shown by a partial olJlitemtion of the daily variation. rrhe next observation of abnormal current was on May fi arnl (}, at which time the surface velocity was far below what it should Iran~ lit'en, followed. 011 the 7th, 8th, and 9th by reverse lower cmTEn1ts arnl a surfaec velocity too srnall by ~wer one knot. The W eathcr Ileview says t11at on the 3d 0£ May an area of high prei'isnre appeared off the southeai'itern coast of the United States, and was succemled by lower prei'isure from the 7th to the 10th. The high area was the evident cause of the low surface velocities on the 5th aml 6th, while the low area is responsible for the TeYenw bottom currents ou the 7th, 8th, and 9th. The next notieeahle variation fron:1 the normal velocity was on February 12, 1887, the anehornge being No. 3, Section CC. The surface velocity was decidedly too higl1, and was caused by the great atmospheric disturbance& of the thrc~e prm-ious days. An al'ea of low barometer had traveled across the country, r . ~aching . the Atlantic coast on the aften10011 of the 11th and causing the lowest barometer

for the month at all the stations from Hatteras to Portland. This was followed by an extensive area of high barometer which arrived at the Atlantic on the 12th and embraced within its limits the entire coast. On account of the accompanying had weather, observations could not be continued until the reverse effect of the latter was felt. The unusual ·velocity observed at Station 1, Section CC, on March 2 and 3, is another instance of atmospheric pressure. At the end of February an area of high pressure was forming in the Rio Grande Valley and on the ht day of March this had extended so as to embra.ce most_ of the Gulf of Mexico, if not the whole of it. The barometer on the latter date was the highest recorded for the month of March at all the stations near tlw Gulf cmt;:\t from Key West to Brownsville. During the evening of Uay 4 and on )fay 5 currents were observed at Station 2"'. On the 2d and 3d there had been an area of low barometer in the Rio Grande Valley and on tlie coast of Texas which had moved north, but its influence was felt at the anchorag·e by the irregularity of the currents found. At Station 1, Section EE, on December 21 and 22, 1889, there was evidently a disturbance which caused a WN"\V. current at all depths except at 130 fathoms. This was the station nearest the edge of the Florida Bank. Examining the weather maps we find that there was an extensive area of l~w barometer extending from tlie Hi~ Grande Valley to British America. The center moved away from the Texan coast into the Gulf of Mexico 011 tlw 22d, and tl~en, curving to the northward, passed over the mouth of the Mississippi, causing heavy winds on the Gulf coasts. This was evidently the cause of the reverse current found by the observers. Sufficient illustrations have been given to show the certain influence of differences of pressure within and without the Gulf of Mexico. In every instance where an abnormal cur~nt seems to he evident' there is reason to be fouml in the state of the barometer. In every instance, when· the barometric differences were sharp at the time of an anchorage in the weaker currents, the effect of the former on the latter is visible. Not being able with one party to observe "the currents at two places in tlie Stream at the same time, it is impossible to assert positively that the "nfl.uence is not felt at all parts alike, but it seems that the weakest portions

UNITED "STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

605

are first influenced, the bottom current is materially lessened or reversed, and the current in what. has been called the neutral zone is quickly clmnged. In one or two instances, wlieu at anchor in the deeper water, the effect of the abnormality on ,the current has not been found, and this is one reason for the conclusion that it h.; the weaker current at the bottom and at the sides which is first influenced. A long-coutinued difference of preslmre will cause the effect to appear in the upper stratum.

CHAPTER VIII.
CONCLDSIONS.

The Gulf StrearTt receives its water from the Atlantic, partly by means of a current driven by the force of the southeast trade winds along the northeast coast of South America, and partly by a current from the northeast trade winds. The water, as a current, flows only through the passages between the 'Vindward Islands, and not through the Anegada, Mona, or 1Vindward Passages. All the water entering the Caribbean as described does not fltWI' the length of that sea as a current, but a portion of it returns to the eastward through the Passages, usually as a subcurrent. In n<ldition there is a large body of water thrown by the waves into the Caribhean through all the passages. The current found along the South American coa8t between Trinidad m1d Curn<;oa is chiefly produced by the e8cape of water thrown there hy the waves, no large body pennanently entering the sea through the passage south of Grenada. The flow of water across the Caribbean is of the same character as that found outside the islands, a scarcely perceptible current on the surface at· first, but increasing in its velocity aH the longitude increases. The water accumulated in the western Caribbean escapes into the Gulf of .Mexico, raising its surface level above that of the Atlantic. The general circulation of the water of the Gulf oi Mexico is erratic in direetiou and feehle in force. Lieutenant Vrooland's observations at twelve anchorages between the Mississippi Delta and the Yucatan Bank show a predominating direction to the southward and westward in the northern half of the Gulf, and also close to the Yucatan Bank, while between the two the flow was to the eastward. The passage of water into the Straits of Florida is sometimes from the Gulf and again from the Yucatan Passage. At the high declination of the moon it is from the latter, and at low declination it is from the former.

Passing through the Straits of Florida, the axis of the stream off Havana is nearest the southern edge of the current prism, but after making the heud between Salt Key Bank and Florida Reefs the axis is from 4~ to 11 ~ mi1el" outside the 100-fathom eurve on the ·west side. There is another body of water to the nortlnvard of the West lmlian Islands, whieh, driven by the trade w1.nds, is moving to the westward. This is a. slow cmTent, but when it joins the Gulf Stream proper off the southern Atlantic Coast of the United States it materially adds to the latter on its way toward the llOrtltern :-;eas. The width of the Gulf Stream off Cape Hatteras is about the sarne as when it leaves the Straits of Florida. It is, ~owever, liable to more fluctuations in directions, particularly along its edges; and iu its progress to the eastward, hy the time the Newfoundland hanks are reaelw<l, it is probable that these fluctuations entirely ohliternte the Stream as a 1--ly <listingui:;;hahlt.' from its mate which has come by the outside passage from the tra<le region. In these latitudes, however (about 40° N.), the whole surface is :;lowly moving to the eastward, driven by the prevailing· westerly winds. Approaching· the shores of Europe it meets the obstruction of the Continent and micapes latemlly, one branch to the southward from the Azores towanls the coast of Africa; the other branch into the .Arctic, when_; it fon·<'S a cn1d retun1 surface current to escape along the shores of Greenland and L:i.hrndor. The characteristics of the Gulf Stream and of also what may he 1·a1Jed its tributaries are as follows: When the flow is in the vic·inity of tlw larnl there is a marked daily variation iu the velocity, caused l,y the elevation or depression due the attraction of the moon and sun. There is a retardation in the effect produced by this tidal influence of about 3 houni. In the open sea the daily variation is not npirked.

more easterly direction. At the time of the moon':'.! low declination the cun-ents are all to the southward and eastward. The following table gives the position of the axis or the point where the greatest velocity may be found on the third day after the moon's highest and after zero declination. The velocity of the current at the point given as the position of the axis at high declination, changes more than at the other point ; or in other words, the difference between the maximum and the minimum currents during the month is greatest near the place where the mo\-ement to the left cea.ses. At the mean position of the axis, however, a good current is always to be found.

It is probable that from Jupiter Inlet to Cape Hatteras, the average position of the maximum cun-ent will be found between 11 and 20 miles outside the curve of 100 fathoms depth, disregarding the irregularities in the curve. To gain the advantage of the strongest current, it is a question of judg~ ment to be decided by the navigator at the time, how much he shall cut off in rounding the bends of the Stream. At high declination he can edge out so as to pasR :F'owey Rocks light-house 7 miles distant, and be sure of a good current, while, at low declination the maximum yelocity at this distance will be found much less, and it will be necessary to go 4 or 5 miles farther to the eastward. The data ol1tained off Cape Hatteras are not sufficient to enable us to assert positively how much the movement of the a.xis is. The width of the Stream at high declination is about 40 miles, reckoning from the 100-fathom curve, which is about the same width as in the narrowest parts ~f the Straits of Florida. It is probable that at low decEnation the position of the axis

at Cape Hatteras is not more than 12 or 15 miles farther offshore than the distance given in the table, but the conditiorni of the current outside the Stream at this point cause a -slow surface flow at times which may lead to the belief that the Stream itself is very broad. I am con viuce(l that the so-called "Cold \Vall" is not the inner edge of the Stream, but is near the dividing line between the Gulf Stream proper and the outside Atlantic current, aud that the maximum velocity will always be found some miles insi(le (to the northward) of it. 'l"'he current outside the Stream is not comparable with the latter in point of velocity. Its speed probably iH never nrnch over oue knot and usually much less. Its direction is to the north ward and westward outside the Bahamas and to the northward and eastward off Cape Hatteras. A steamer bound from Cape Hatteras to Havana or the Gulf ports crosses the Stream off Cape Hatteras. A fair allowance to ·make in crossing the Stream at right angles is 1 ~ knots pe1· hour for a vessel's speed of 5 knots for a distance of 40 miles from the 100-fathom curve. In the run from the southern edge of the Stream to Matanilla Shoal, no allowance for current can be given. Upon sighting the Bahama Bank, time will be saved by running down the Stream on the east side as far as Gun Cay instead of crossing at Jupiter and running the latitude down on the Florida side of the channel. The current is weak on the Bahama side, and on the shoals there is practically none. This route will be difficult and perhaps impracticable until a light-house is built at Matanilla, unless the green water of the northwest corner of the bank is sighted before dark. Arriving at Gun Cay, Bahama, an allowance of 2! knots per hour for speed of the vessel of ~ knots per hour will make a course of west good to Fowey Rocks. This is for the average velocity of the Stream. The weakest current will be experienced about 3 hours before the transit of the moon, and if the crossing is made so as to arrive at the axis at about this hour time will be saved. A vessel running inside the Stream from Cape Hatteras to Cape Canaveral should keep inside the 100-fathom curve, and, after passing the latter cape, as close to the Florida shore as prudence will allow. Along the Fforida Reefs the neutral zone which borders the northern · edge of the Stream probably begins in the vicinity of "The Elbow," near

Carysfort Reef light-house, and gradually widens as the longitude increases, until off RAbecca shoal, it extends from 15 to 20 miles outside the 100-fathom curve.~ It ill narrowest at high declination of the moon, at which time· it probably begins at some point to the westward of "The Elbow." The direction of the current in this zone is ord~narily tidal in its character, but it is easily overcome by an abnormal current caused by differences in atmospheric pressure within and without the Gulf of Mexico. Crossing the Stream from Havana, a fair allowance for the average current between the 100-fathom curves, is ltc> knot per hour for a 5-kn'Jt speed of vessel. A vessel rounding Cape San Antonio from the southward will find an eddy current from the Straits of Florida setting along the Colorado Reefs at a high declination of the moon. Thirty miles off shore it will be setting to the northward and eastward. The current in the Santaren Channel is irregular in direction and very weak. In the St. Nicholas Channel and Old Bahama Channel the direction of the current depends upon the relative elevations of water in the Straits of Florida and Atlantic, and consequently flows in either direction for irregular intervals of time. · The subject of temperatures has already appeared incidentally in these pages. So much has been written on the question in times past, and the belief is so widespread at the present day, that the thermometer may be relied upon to indicate the presence of a current, that I wish to particularly accentuate the fallacy of the idea. In the Straits of Florida we have found that the highest average temperature is at the axis of the Stream, but there are times during the month when the sides are wanner than the axis was at some other recent time. Isolated observations are of but little value, for at the same place the variations are great even in an interval of a few days or perhaps hours. All we can say positively is that cold surface water comes from either a pola1· direction or from a lower stratum. The direction of its flow may he toward any point in the comp&'IS. At Section A the temperatures were the most numerous. They are · given in the table below for each month and at each stat~on together with the number of anchorages. Equal value is given to the observations of each anchorage, whet.her it was 24 hours in duration or 7 days.

I can see no way of utilizing the thermometer f(Jr the purposes of accurate navigation, nor indeed of using it to indicate with certaiuty that the current is favorable or the i:everse. Referring to the table on page 598, it is seen that the smface ~'at Station 44 was 73°, while at Station Ko. G, Section F, it was 77°.5. The current at the first was to the northward and eastward, and at the second to tho southward and westward. At Station 4 the current towai·d the SE. quadrant had an average temperatm·e of 73°.75, NE. quadrant 76°.82, and NW. quadrant 73°.30. In this case it was warmer when flowing toward the northeast. At Station 1, in l\fay, a northeast current had a temperature of 75°.06, and in June, :flowing southwest, it was 80°.19. At 15 fathoms depth the temperatures were 74°.39 and 76°.19 respectively, so the phenomenon could not have been due to the immediate action of the sun's heat. The warm water did not extend to 30 fathoms depth, however, and below it was much colder than at any other point in the Section. Any navigator, in rounding Capo Hatteras, upon meeting_a temperature of ove1· 80° would certainly conclude that his vessel was in a current setting to the northeast instead of toward the southwest. The inner edge of the Stream, then, is not necessarily marked by a change of temperature. An abrupt difference may be encounter~d at the true edge of the current, the cold water may be moving northeast or the warm water may be flowing southwest. It is probable, however, that at about the time of high declination warm water o:ff Cape Hatteras indicates a northeast current, and that at low declination the edge of the warm water has a set in the opposite direction.

REPORT IN RELATION TO A PORTION OF BOUNDARY LINE IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THE STATES OF MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.
U.
S. COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

lrnsltington,

~Yorember

18, 1889.

DEAR SIR: In fulfillment of your instructious of the 4th instant I have examiued the subject

of the bournlary line between Marylaml and Virginia and reRpectfully submit a i;;tatunent of my conclusions as to its location and determination. Iu ;your letter of instructions, after referring to my previous report of my interview on the ground of the boundary with the gentlemen appointed to represe11t the States of Virginia and Marylarnl in considt'riug the question of the boundary line between those States, you say: "I desire that ;you will proceed to Baltimore on or before tlle 13th i11sta11t to meet these gentlemen again 1 and aft.er first putting yourself in pm;session of all the information ohtainabl~', by the inspection of original charts aud documents and listening to an,Y arguments which they may make, you will, I thiuk, be able to bring the matter to a conclusion by defining and determining- said bouwiary line in accordance with your judgment. As I understand the matter you are to lie the sole arbiter in the case, as in the letter of Governor .Tackson of October 10 I am requested to detail an officer' to examiue and locate that portion of the bounuary line near Bog Island, iu tue lower Potomac River,' and in the letter of Governor Lee to Governor Jackson, bearing date of October 8, a COJlY of which was transmitted to me by Governor Jackson, he (Governor J,ee) unites with Governor Jackson in asking the detail of an officer 'to examine and determine that portion of the boundary line now in dispute.' ''This in my judgment gives youfull power, as you have been detailed by me for this purpose, and I trust that you will exercise your bestjudgrneut and without prejudice adjudicate the matter. "When you have done this you will report at once to me at the Office." I understand my examination of this subject to be confined to the declaration of the award of the arbitrators of 1877, which is also a law of Oougress (Forty·fiflh Congress, chapter 19u, :passed March 3, 1879, U. S. Statutes at Large, p. 481) and an interpretation of the same. I have based my study on the conclusions arrived at and expressed by tliese arbitrators which bear directly on Ure case in question, namely, the shore line of the lower part of the Potomac River and the details of its physical features in their relation to this boundary line. The arbitrators express the following opinion, viz: "The intent of the charter is manifest all through to include tlw whole of the Potomac Hi \'er within Lord Baltimore's grant. · · · Oertainl,Y there is nothing there which requires the line to leave the river bank. .Apart from all this it looks utterly improbable that the two termini of this line should both have_been fixed on the south side (right bank) of the river without a pur· pose to put the line itself on the same side. · · · "For these reasons we conclude that the charter line was on the right bank of the Potomac, where the high-water mark is impressed upon it, and that line follows the bank along the whole course of the river, from its first fountain to its mouth." In the text of the award of the arbitrators of 1877 the following declaration is made, Yiz: "The latitudes, longitudes, courses, and distances here given have been measured upon the Ooast Chart No. 33 of the United Sta008 Ooast Survey (chart No. 3 of Chesapeake Bay), which is
621

herewith filed as part of this award and explanatory thereof. The original charter line is marked upon the said chart and shaded in blue. The present line of boundary, as ascertained and de'termined, is also marked and shaded in red, while the yellow indicates the line referred to in the compact of 1785 between Smith's Point and Watkin's Point. "In further explanation of thil'I award the arbitrators deem it proper to add that" 1. The measurements being taken and places fixed according to the Coast Survey, we have come aR near to perfect mathematical accuracy as in the nature of things is possible. But in case of any inaccuracy in the described course or length of a line or in the latitude or longitude of a place the natural object called for must govern. '· 2. The middle threacl of the Pocomoke River is equidistant as nearly as may be between the two shores without considering arms, inlets, creeks, or afll.uents as parts of the river, but measuring tlie shore lines from headland to headland. "3. The low-water ma1·k on the Potomac, to which Virginia has a right in the soil, is to be measured by the same rule; tbat is to say, from low-water mark at one headland to low-water mark at another, without following imlentations, !Jays, creeks, inlets, or affineut r~'\"'ers." ln addition to the above text descriptive of the low-water mark on the Potomac River, so much of said low-water mark as is represented on said chart No. 33 is marked and shaded in red on said chart in the conventional sign adopted by the arbitrators to indicate the location of the boundary line declared to be ascertained and determined on said chart as a part of their award and explanatory thereof. Setting aside for the time the cartographic representation of the boundary Jine, as above described, concerning the signification of which different opinions have been expressed, I submit the following statem1>nt of the technical interpretation of the data given as applied to the projection of a line representing the thread of a stream, and to that of a line along the shQre which shall conform as nearly as may be to the physical system of a river as characterized by its area and figure: In the first case the same rule would be applied as that Jaid down for the course of the boundary line in the Pocomoke Hiver, viz : "The middle thread is equidistant as nearly as may be between the two shores without considering arms, inlets, creeks, or affluents as parts of the river, but meastt.ring tke skore lines from headland to headland." No other measurements would mathematically determine the middle thread, which must be a mean direction between the courses of the two shores. :Measuring straight lines from headland to headland would not determine the middle thread of a stream; because, in the bencls of a river, straight lines giving equivalent results can not be measured on corresponding or opposite concave and convex shores. Again, in the second case, the same rule would be applied. as that laid down for the boundary line on the Potomac River, viz: "The low-water mark is to be measureil"-from headland toheadlandwithout following indentations, bays, creeks, inlets, or affluent rivers; for the reason that such htera.l features are incidental to the general system of the river and can not properly be made factors in determining its true physical limits. Referring again to the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia on the Pot.omac River retixed by the arbitrators of 1877 on the right ba.nk of that river to coincide with the low-water mark, the descriptive text used and the conventional sign adopted can only be regarded as an intentional avoidance of more specific mention and definition of points and features which time and natural causes might, so change as to render their future identification doubtful. Whereas, the right bank of the Potomac, in its general features, will always be the right bank so long as the river itself remains. The only deviation made by the arbitrators of 1877 from the ruling of the original charter is in adopting the low-water mark instead of the high-water mark as the true line of boundary. Physically the lines are substantially the same as features of the river bank, while low-water mark is more in accordance with modern regulations pertaining to ripa.ria.n rights.

CONCLUSION.

623

For the reasons given above I am prepared to say, on the part of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, that according to the text of the award of the arbitrators of 1877 as descripti·e of the boundary line between Maryland and Virginia, no mathematical or physical construction can be put upon the meaning of said description which will locate and define the cognate boundary line and low-water mark in any other place, or make it conform to any other course of the river, than that which they have ascertained and determined to be the low-water mark 011 the south shore (right bank) of the Potomac River, as marked and shaded in red upon the Coast Chart No. 33 of the United States Coast Survey, which is filed as part of the said award and explanatory thereof. This clearly illustrates the intended location of the boundary line, and conforms to the terms and meaning of the

award.

You will occt1p~· at. least one stat.ion at. or in the vicinity of St. Paul do Loanda and abo 011 the Cape of Good Hope atUl the isl:uul;; of" St. Ifoluna aml Asc:en.,ion, it being assumed that. the vessel will lantl at these points to allow of the occt1pancy of tue,;" t1t:~tio11:;. Yoa will l.lear in mind that- yonr first duty is to seeure as much information as possibler,,latiug to gr:tvitv :wd magu"tie,; at tlrn "cvernl -stalious yon a.re :tl>le tu occupy; arnl, while yon "·ii! not undertake anythiug l""·L·'ning to the work of the expedition which will in any way interfere wit.h your performance of this dut~·, it i>< my 1l<;sin' that :·on co-operate with Professor Tolld, who is in c.harge of the Eclipse Expedition,. in every way possilik- :1111[ r1'IHh·r hilll all the a~sistancc in your power. I inclose lwrewith a copy of the letter of the l10uorable Secretitry of the Trea.snry authorizing yonr detail for this work, a copy of whi.-h i-i ak, H ·n t to Profes3or To1ld, together with a copy of these instructions. The·e instruction.; "w»er tlu· ueee;~:tr.v expen~e incnrretl by son for travel t.o join the ship Pensacola at New York and to returu tu 1 lib1 Ollie» fro Ill ~·ny home port made uy ber at tbe conclusion of the work of the expedition. Yon rs respectfully, T. c. l'rfENDEXHAI,L, S11perintendent. Mr. :E. D. l'itE.~T()~. ·.1HXi8fllllt, (:. ::'. Coa~t a>·d Grodetic Sun·e.11, Tras/1ingto11, D. C.

As preliminary to tlie work of tlie \'oya.ge, peudulmn observations were made at the SmithsoniaH ln8titutiou, the Peirce Penllnlums Yard No. 3 and Metre No. 2 being swung, and magnetic observations were made at tlrn Coast a111l Georletic Sun·ey Office in Washiugton. On November 2, after a passagl:l of 17 days from New York, we toucbe(l at the Azores (see IJJnstration .No. 55). Coaling at this point 1letai11ed the vessel but 24 hours. By the kindness of Captain Yates, howe\'er, sailing was delaye<l a few honr8 au1l a full Sl~ries of magnetic observations ma<le on 2'ovemher B. Prom Paya1 wt> :-;teamed directly to Porto Grande, Cape Verde Islands, arriving at 7 p. m. on November 10. Obserni.tions for magnetic declinatiou, dip and horizontal internsity we-re made on tlie 11th. On the l:!t-h we left for the coas~, sightiug the hills above Freetown 011 tlie aft1'lrnoou of the 18th. Anchor was 1lr;1ppecl at 5 p. m.; permission to make the ohservatious was obtained from tlw Governor, and the location of station chosen the same evening. The ll(>,Xt morning at 6 o'clock work heg-an, and one determination of all the magnetic elemrnts was made during the day. Coaling conti1J11e([ dining the 11iglit, and we were off for the Gold Uoast by sunrise the following morniug. Eight 1hiys i:;teami ng, for tbe moi:;t part througl1 the dense haze of a harmattan, · brought u1-1 t.o Utpe Uoa,,;t Castle. So coal coulll be obtained ht>-re aml we ran up to Elmi..ua where a two days' stop was madl~; on both days magnetic observations were made. On tue evening of Non·mber :2," we left 1111der way for St. Paul de Loanda, arriving 011 the e,-e of December 6. This town i,,; sitnate<1 in the prm'inee of .Angola, about 100 miles south of the Congo. The Pensacola ouly remained a <lay licre. A hasty visit to the town ou the morning of the 7th, couvinced me that facilities for Uu~ penrlulnm work were much better at this point than they could possibly oo at Cape Ledo, where the Bclip8e Party were going to establisll their station. I therefore ueterminetl to leave the vessd ancl make the magnetic a11d gravity observati?ns a{ Loanda. The ship sailed ou December 7 iifter lrnviug landed my outfit. Cape Ledo is about 70 miles south of Loanda. It. may be said that the real work of the voyage datetl from this time. '.rhe magnetic observatiom:; at Azore:<, Cape Verde Islands, Freetown and Elmiua were not contemplated in the origual plan al!ll were oul.r made l'ecause th'3 vessel stO(lped at these J!Oints for coal. J;io gravity work was attempted, as tile. time was altogether insufficient. At Loanda tbe basement of the A m'erican :\[i:-isiou honse was ocrm1decl for gravit~,, and the magnetic .measures were made in tbe i.mmeriiate ''iciuity. 'l'lrn plan of operation followed at this station, which may be tal!;eu as a type for all the rrn;t, was to swing two pezululnms ea.cit during 72 consecutfre Lo_urs, and to det;ermine the magnetic lfoclina.tion, dip, and horizontal intensity ou each of three consecutive days. The magnetic work was done on December 14, 15, and 16. One of' the pendulnm!'l '"as swung before December 20 and the
· · A dry :trnl vpry hot wind from the intet.ior of Afri<'.a whi'.11. blo.ws unvards the AtlantiQ Oce.1.n, and is usulJ.}ly 14ccompauied by a haze often thick enough to obscure the s11n.

Lat-itude and Heights at Ascensfon.
At the request of Capt. R. B. Napier, Royal Navy, Commandant of the Island, a few pairs of stars were observed for latitude at the i1eudulmn station iu Bunghole SC]uare. The transit pier was connected by triangulation with the reference point of the Island, a small stone pier near the Captain's Cottage. The longitude of this point was determined in 1877 by Dr. Gill, Her Majesty's Ast.ronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, who passed six: months at Ascension while observing the opposition of J'lfars. The result of our work was:
() / II

Latitude of transit pier ............. ___ . 7 55 47·7 south Reduction to reference point. ....... - . . . +12·8 Latitude of pier near Captain's Cottage.. 7 56 00·5 This depends on obser>ations of six pairs of stars on two nights. The triangulation was done by means of a small (4-inch) Casella thoodolite, reading to minutes. The deduced latitude is probahly correct to the nearest second. The height of the pendulum station on Green Mountain was determined barometrically. Ensign A. H. Scale'l, U.S. N., read the lower instrument in the pendulum room at Bunghole Square. The one at the upper station was read by myself. The baromet.er.s lmercuriaJ, by Green, New York, Nos. 846 and 1390) were ·compared before and after the work, each obsen·er reading his own instrument, thus eliminating personal equation. Readings were made fi-ve times daily at about 9 and 11 a. m. and at 1, 3, and 5 p. m. Observations were continued while the party was ·on the mountain, so that the result depends on more than fifty simultaneous readings. The probable error of the mean value was about one foot. The adopted values were:

A.a an entirely new form of instrnment is about to be introduced into the Ooast and Geodetic Survey Service for gravity determinations, aud as no description of the different forms hithertQ used has yet appeared, it has been thought advisable to insert here a concise enumeration of the several patterns. Large pendulums-that. is, those having a virtual length of a metre or a yard-will probably not be employed in the future for relative determinations of the force of gravity. A half-second pendulnl'l (25 c.m.) appears to give au accuracy in the results equal to that attained with larger forms, a.nd has the great advantage of being much more portable. The

652

present time therefore marks an epoch in the gravity work of the Survey, and a sort of history of the evolution of the instrument will be useful for reference.

Description of di.-fferent forms of Pendulums used in the Ooast and Geodetic Survey previous to July 1, 1890.
.At the above-mentioned date the Survey was in possession of sixteen pendulums, of which the different types are shown in illustrations Nos. 58 and 63. Of these, ten are of the Kater invariable pattern, including one made of silver. One is a Peirce invariable pendulum (Pin illustration No. 58), provided with only one knife-edge; one is the Repsold reversible metre pendulum; and tonr are of the Peirce pattern, and known as invariable reversible pendulums (see pendulums marked Rand I in illustration No. 58). The Kater numbers run from 1 to 10 with No. 7 lackiog. Four forms of these pendulums are shown in illustration No. 63. Beginning at the left, the first figure is the silver pendulum, tlie three tllermometers attached to it being shown in position. In the second and fifth figures are gi\·en two views of No. 4. The tllird and fourth figures are front and side views of No. 8. The sixth figure shows No. 2 in one position. One pendulum iS' unnumbered, but as it is in the same box as Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5, it was probably intended for No. 3. The Peirce invariable pendulum is unnumbered, as likewise that of Repsold. The Peirce reversible pendulums are numbered from 1 to 4, all of them similar in form, and all measuring a metre between the knives, except No. 3, which measures a yard. No. 1 went to Lady Franklin Bay with General Greely in 1881. Nos. 2 and 3 were taken to Afrimt in 1889, No .. 3 to the South Pacific iu 1883, and Nos. 3 and 4 to the Sandwich Islands in 1887, by myself. Lieutenant Very carried the Peirce invariable one to Patagonia in 1882. The Repsold pendulum has been used in Europe as well as iu this country by Professor Peirce, wllo has also done work here with his own pendulums. The Kater forms were used in the Hoosac Tunnel underground work. The following ii.re the dimensions and weights, given in millimetres and grams:

The legs are fastened to the base below and to the head above by means of nuts. This tripod was taken down and set up at each new station. All the Peirce pemlulums, incluuing the inyariable one, were supported on a Lead sllown in illustration No. 57, the head itself being secured to a plank resting 011 some solid foundation or forming part of a stand constructed for the purpo~e. Several forms of this staml have been used. The one employed in the African \VOrk is shown in illustration No. 56.
OBSERV A.TIO:KS FOR THIE.

The determination of the corrections to the timepieces was made entirely from star observations. ·The sun was observed in one or two instances as a check, but these vahws were not. used iu the final computation. From the nature of the circumstances nuder whicll the work Tl'"as done, it was not always in the best interest of economy to insist on a perfect adjustment of the iustrnment or of its position in the meridian before begiuuiug the regular pendulum work. A slight defect in the construction of the ocular of the telescope which could not !Jc remedied immediately made it necessary to have a large collimation error for the first few days at Loanda. Xotwithstandiug the large azimuth which usually existed dllring the first night's work at all the station8, the star residuals are quite a.s small as on the other e;-euiugs, and it was al ways deemed ad visablP to begin immediately on arriving at tlie place of observation, thns detaining the Yessel as short a time as JJOssible. The expenses of the Pensac<>la wero not far from $1,000 per day, and as the length of the cruise was prolonged by the scientific work to about twice the time first estimated, tue observations were shortened iu every way consistent with accuracy. The following tables giYc the 00·1stants of the iustrument anll the corrections to the time-piece at the different stations

REDUCTION OF THE PENDULUM OllSERVATIONS.

The corrections for amplitude depend on a formula first given by Borda., and which gives all the accuracy necessary. The pendulums were usually started at nearly the same arc of vibration, so that the corrections were but slight1y different for the whole work. A table was devised and com1mted by Mr. G. R. Putnam which made it possible to take out the corrections for the separate swings by simple inspection, the entire number of stations only requiring a few hours' work. The temperature corrections employed were as follows :

In correcting for atmospheric effect, coefficients were used which have already been employed for this form of pendulum (Appendix No. 14, Uoast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1888). The usual plan has been followed of first making differential corrections to reduce to the mean tempera· tnre and pressure of each station, and then reducing to a standard condition to which all stations are referred. The coefficients given in the report for 1888 for pendulum No. 4 baYe been used here for No. 2, as they are exactly alike in form and material. The time of oscillation of an equivalent simple pendulum is given by the formula

T:-~hJ1--fr~~~fz
T and t being the times of osciHation with the heavy end down and heavy end up, respectively, and Hand h being the distances from the center of suspension to the center of oscillation for the same positions. As T-t is not more than 0·0002 6 , for any of the pendulums, and as the fraction
Hit (TH-thr1

is less than unity, the radical may be omitted.
TH-th H-h

may then be put in the form

t+H .. H-k
where

( T-t)

H~k =1-.500 for pendulum No. 2 and 1·506 for pendulum No. 3.

By this formula t)le times of oscillation in the two positions were combined. The object in observing with two pendulums was to have a check on any change from acci· dental causes. Their agreement was quite satisfactory. The following table gives the incrPase in the time of one oscillation for heavy end down at the different stations in terms of the Wash· ington period: ·

After having found the reduced times of oscillation for each station, the relative times were calculated with the value at Washington as unity. This waS"'done for each pendulum separately. A mean being taken, we have the final values as given in the table. These quantities are then corrected for elevation by the formula
dt h ( _i- 3 0) Olarkes ' Geodesy, p.326. t=r 46

and for latitude in accordance with Professor Helmert's latest formula for the length of the seconds pend alum (Yerhandlungen, Conferenz der Europiiischen Gradmessnng, Pari's, 1889.) Taking a mean value of t when reduced to the sea le>el and equa~r, and comparing with individual values resulting from each station, we get the following residuals in oscillations per day.

From this it appears that the coast stations a.re light and the island stations are heavy. Barbados seems to fall rather on the side of tbe continental stations, or at least about halfway between the mean island and mean continental value. This might be expected, inasmuch a.a the Windward Islands, besides being comparatively near the South American eontioent, are themaelves

but the summits of a vast submarine plateau.

UNITED ST.ATES OOAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The relative forces of gravity at the sea and summit for both St. Helena and .Aecension are fo11nd by comparing the observations when the pendulum was swinging with the heavy end down. This makes the work comparable with Foster's determination, as he used an invariable pendnlnrn capable of being oscillated in only one position. Besides, there can be no possible doubt as to the correctn~s of the coefficients for atmospheric effect for elevatious nn<ler 3,000 feet. The result is that a pendulum beating seconds at the sea level would lose 5·4 oscillations per da.y at Longwood, St. Helena; anrl 7·3 oscillations per day on Green "Mountain, Ascension. As the correction for elevation in the former case is 7·2 oscillations aud in the latter is 9·~, we have an acceleration due to the mountain matter of 1·8 oscil1ations per day for St. Helena and 2·0 for Ascension. If we assume, as is customary in correcting for continental attraction, the meau density of the lan(l to be one-half the mean density of the earth, we should have a decrease in the number of oscillations from both causes of 4·5 for St. Helena and 5·8 for .Ascension, so that neither island shows as much attraction as this supposition requires. Substituting the relative forces of gravity in tile equation we get St. Helena to be 0·34 of the Earth's mean density, and Ascension to be 0·29 of the Earth's mean density. The specific gravity of the surface rocks is about 2·8, while the mean density of the whole i,sland from the gra...·ity determinations is not far from l ·8 for either St. Helena or Ascension. The pendulum observations embodied iu this paper were not intended to be used for ahsolnte measures of gravity. But as oscillations were made in lJoth positious of the instrument, and as the length was measured iu order tote.st its invariability, a comparison can be made with values of g otherwise deduced. Helmert assumes for the leugth of tlie seconds pendulum at Washington the value
l =0·99299 metres

This is based on his formula 1ueviously cited. Thf' value of l at Hoboken depending on the work of Heaviside, Peirce, and Herschel when reduced to Washingto.u gives

.

I =0·99302 metres

The observations

or our metre penclnlnm give.

We may therefore accept as a close approximation to the value of gravity at. Wa11hington
o=980·05 dynes.

On this Aupposition the absolute values in the table which foll~s have been calculated. It need hardly be added that in deducing these results, both the flexure of the support and the amplitude of oscillatioa of the pendulum were considered. They are, however, still uncorrected for the tlexare of the pendulum head.

No. 13-1890.

ON AN APPROXIMATE METHOD FOR COMPUTING PROBABLE ERROR.
By CHAS. H. KUMI\1:ELL. Computing Division. U.

s .. coast

and Geodetic Survey.

[Submitted for publication January 25, 1890.]

Considering the nature of the quantity usually called probable error; there seems reqnired
by the rigorous method, especially for a great number of observations, far' too much work in pro· portion to the value of the quantity. It is proposed here to develop a method to compute this quantity from each of the residuals if required, but principally from the larg·er oneti, which give

the best value. It is all-important that we keep such a method logically correct if no more may be assumed tor it. Now the fundamental assumption is: Any series of residua.ls resulting from a problem of least squares is as nearly a.s possible an ideal series, or; in other words, such. a series conforms as nearly as possible to the law of error. According to the fundamental conception, we may find by counting, a middle value, which is as often exceeded as not. But we obtain theoreticalJy au identical quantity by using Table IX A, Cbauvenet's Method of Least Squares. This gives the probabilities of a quantity to the argument of its ratio to t.be probable error. Supposing, then, there are m observations Vi, 1'2, v3, ···· 1'm-h Vm, which we suppose here arranged according to their namerical ma.gnitnde, such that 11,,, is the largest residual, then we have very nearly2m-l=proba.bility not to exceed Vm=B(pt'm)

It is important to state here that this quantity r' is, or should be, the middle value of the series. It is not, lwwever, yet the probable error of observation. Suppose the problem involves n unknown quantities; then, if r = probable error of observation, we haver=r'\ - I

Now, each of the values in column r' is a single a.ppliaation of the method, hat they are obviously of very different precision, those derived from the largest residuals being the best.

If -0arried out completcly by .oompnting the snms [ v and rt'] the method can of course 1wt be considered short, not even rigorous. It is .a abort method only, if we confine it to a few values from the largest residuals which should be correctly combined for a final value. In tbe last colunl'u u i I have also exhibited a theoretical .series of resi.duaUi, which show a satisfactory agreement with the actual series There is, however, a still mor.e rough use-0f the method which does not ru.quire the knowledge of tile residuals. We can then use the range which may be considered as the sum of the two largest r.esiduals; dividing this by the COITesponding snm of t 1 we obtain a fair value of r' and hence of r.

The method of least squares furn.isbes the complete solution of the problem of the determina.tion of the mo::>t probable relation between two variables, when the theoretical linear equatiuo. connecting them is known, provided the measured values of one variable be regarded as free from errors of observation.

The values of a and b fonnd from (2) are in general quite different from those found from (3). the difference being due t.o the assumptions concerning the errorti of the observatious of :c and y. In fact, in (2) the observed values of x are regarded aB having a weight infinitely greater than those of y, while in (3) just the reverse assumption is made. It is the object of this paper to set forth a method by which the most probable values of ii and b iu equation (1) can be deduced from observed pairs of values of x and y. The weight of the observed values of x will be taken as g, and the weight of the observed values of y as unity. Formulas for a and b are to be deduced; and these, when g is made infinite, will give the same results as (2), while if g is made zero they will give the same results as (3). 'rhis general solution will be applicable to many classes of observations arising in engineering a.nd physical science. Let x 1 and y 1, x2 and y 2 , etc., be n pairs of observations of the quantities candy, supposed to be oonnected by the relation ax+o-y=O . . . (1) Let the weight of each of the observations xi. x2, etc., be g, and the weight of each of the obser. vations 1JI, 112, etc., be unity. Let n be the number of pairs of observations. Let x 1' and yi' be the adjusted values of the observations x 1 and y 1 so that the corresponding residual errors are x 1 ' -x1, and y/-y1· The fundamental principle of the method of least :Squares requires that the sum of the weighted squares of all the residual errors shall be made a minimum, or,

= a minimum

.

. . (4)

This function is now to be expressed in terms of the observed values and of a and b; then the vanishing of the first derivatives with respect to a and b will furnish two f'..onditions from which their most probable values can be deduced. The values x'1 and y'1 will satisfy equation (1) and so for each of then pairs of adjosted values. This equation is that of a straight line referred to rectangular coordinates, a being the tangent of its inclination to the horizontal. Let a second straight line be drawn through the point whose coordinates are xi' and 1/1' and the point whose coordinates are x1 and Y1, that is, through the adjusted point and the observed point; let a' be the tangent of the inclination of this line to the horizontal; then itB equation is y-y1=a' (x-xi}. Combining this equation with (1) gives the co0rdinates of the adjusted point, thus
1 x'1 =-,--(a'x1

a-a

+ b-y1)

(5)

y'1 = _l__ (a'axi a'-a

+ a1b-ay1 )
(6)

From the ftrst of these subtracting x1 and from the second 1/t gives the residual errors

Substituting in (7) the value of a/ just found it reduces to

Here the expression within the brackets is the condition given by the metliod of least squares when tbe observed >alues of ;v are taken without error, or for the case g=:I').

(10)

from whioh a aml b can be deduced. 'l'he best practical methocl appears to be to first eliminate b, thus deriving a quadratic for a, namel~',
(11)

One of the values of a fouud by the solution of this equation renders (9) a minimum, while the other renders it a max:inmm. In any practical case there is no difficulty in selecting the former root, and then the value of b is,
h= fy]-a

(12)

The values of a and b thus found are the most probable oues deducible from the given observations, and inserting them in (1) the most probable relation between x and y is obtained. Inserting them also in (6) and putting for a' its value the adjusted results for .r 1 aml y 1 are

:r 1 1=~'1-g~a2(ax1+b-y1)1
Y'1=Y1+ g~a2 (ax1+b-y1)

(13}

and similar expressions obtain for each pair of observed v-ahes. Each pair of these adjusted values will exactly satisfy the equation ax+b-y=O. If in (11) the observed values of' x be witliont error, then [}=YJ, and it retluceis to

which agrees with the value ded1rned from (3}. Whatever may be the ·alue of g formula (11) furnishes the means of deriving the most probable value of a. As an example of the application of the method let there be two thermometers having different scales, and let x and y ba corresponding readings when the thermometers have the same exposure. , Then the relation between the two scales is,

ax+b-y=O

and it is required to determine the most probable value>1 of a and b, and then to compute the adjusted readings. Here o=l, n=9, [x]=72, [YJ=72, [x%]=588, [y 2 ]=5&?, [xl1J=582. These substituted in (11) give from which +0·618 or -1·618, the former value evidently being the condition for the minimum. Then from (12) b= +3·056. Hence the most probable relation between the two scales isy=0·618 x+3·056.

Next from (13) the adjusted values of x and y for any pair of observations arex' l =X1 -0·4472 (0·618 X1+3·056-yi) Y11c=y1+0·723G (0·618 X1+3·056-yi)

and putting x 1=6o and y 1 =7° there is found x'1=6°+0'·11 and y'1=7°-(}0 ·17. In this manner the following results are deduced for the adjusted values of the readings:

The points located by these coordinates all lie upon the line whose equation is y=0·618x+3·056. The sum of the squares of the residual errors will ue found to be 2·30, and this is smaller than for any other system of adjusted points. If in the above observations the values of x be regarded as free from error there will be fouml by (2) the relation y=0·5 x+ 4. If, however, the values of y be taken as free from error there is found by (3) the relation x=y. For the first case the sum of the squares of the residual errors is 2·4, a11d for the second case it is 3·0, while tbe correct adjustment gave 2·3. Let the >alues of a given by (14) and (15) be called a1 and a 2 , the former being for the case when the observed x's have no error and the latter for the case when the observed y's are without error. By comp:uing the expressions for these values with the coefficient of a in (11) it is seen that the value of that coefficient is P--a2, and hence (11) ma~· be written

From this formula<£ can be computed when a1 and a2 have first been found. Thui,; for the above numerical example a 1 =0·51 a 2 =1·0 and g=l; hence w+a-1=0, as before deducP-d. The last formula may prove of use in computing the value of g when a is known a priori. For instance, let the following six pairs of observations be the results of the estimation of the stellar magnitudes of six stars by two observers,
X1=8, X2=9, X3=lO, x.,,=10, X5=lO, Xe=12, Y1=9, Y2=9, y 3 =11, Y4= 9, y5=lO, Y6=11.

The weight of each observed y being unity it is required to find the weight of an observed x.

No. 14-1890

ON THE USE OF OBSERVATIONS OF CURRENTS FOR PREDICTION PURPOSES.
Report by JOHN F. HAYFORD, Tidal Division, U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

[Submitted for publication April 18, 1890.]
PREF A.TORY NOTE.

It is believed that the paper here presented on the use of observations of currents for prediction purposes points out a practical method of deriving from current ouservatious results which will be of value to the navigator, and which may be represented graphically on the cltarts. The paper has been prepared by .Mr. John F. Hayford, of the Tidal Division, at the request of Mr. Alex. S. Christie, chief of that Division, and was submitted as a report to the Assistant in charge of the Office of the Survey. Material for discussion has been found in the observations of currents which have accunmlated in the Archives since the year 1844. These observations Mr. Hayford has carefully art'angcd and tabulated with reference to dates, localities, and methods of observation. The systematic prediction of currents, based whenever practicable upon long series of observations, arnl referred at any given locality to the predicted times of high and low water, will soon become a necessary adjunct to the Tide Tables. T. C. MENDENHALL, Supcrinte1idcnt. The principal discussions hitherto made in the Coast Survey of current observations for prediction purposes are: Three reports on the currents, on Nantucket Shoals, Mnskeget Channel, and northeast coast of l\lartba's Vineyard, and in Long Island Sound, by .Assistant C. A. Schott (now in charge of the Computing Division), published as Appendices 48, 49, and 50 of the Report for 185!. A report on the ''Physical Hydrography of the Gulf of Maine," Appendix No. 10 of the Report for 1889, by Assistant Henry Mitchell. And a "Report on a New Rule for Currents in Delaware Bay and RiYer," Appendix No. 18 of the Re,port, for 1881, by Assistant Henry llfitchell. The three appendices referred to of the Report of 1854 may be considered as the beginning of current prerliction in the Ooast Survey, many of the results there deduced beiug publishe1l as current arrows on charts and as current tables on the margins of charts. The times of maximum current and of slack water are in these predictious referred to the moon's transit, foe observed !uni-current intervals being corrected to the mean. I uni-current intervals on the assumption that the semimonthly inequality in the !uni-current intervals is the same as the semimonthly inequality in the luni-tidal interval In the various Coast Pilots which have been published by the Survey there are a number of tables of predicted currents in which the times are referred t.o moon's transit as above. And from time to time many such tables have appeared on the Coast Survey charts and a few of them in the Reports, in all of which the times were referred to the moon's transit. In the Ooast Survey Bulletin No. 8, bearing the date December 18, 1888,"" the curreuts of six

stations in New York Harbor and approaches are referred to the tides at Sandy Rook. That is instead of using the interval from tho moon's transit to any phase of the current as a means of prediction, the interval from Sandy Hook high water or low water is used, and the cnrrent predictions are thus based upon the tide predictions. This Bulletin was made the basis of information and tables relating to currents in New York, Bay and Harbor, on pages j26-227 of the Tide Tables for the Atlantic Coast for the year 1890, and thus forms the beginning of current 11redictions in tlie Tide Tables. In August~ 1889, the systematic prediction of currents having been assigned to the Tidal Division, a careful study of the subject was undertaken as a necessary basis for thorough future work. From the study of the pbc11omena, as shown by the observations, and from a study of all that could be found in the published works of the Survey, and in a few other miscellaneous publicatio11s, together with the suggestions derived from a number of letters received from various assistants aud naval officers in the Survey in response to a request for their written opinions, a method of reduction for prediction was decided upon. As a. test of the adopted method, nine of the longest and most reliable series that could be found were then reduced, and the residuals of the reduction carefully examined as an index of the accuracy of the method. · The method is perhaps best explained by the following example of the method of reduction, with the appended explanation. ·

The first five columns are results taken directly from tbe records of obser\·ation, and hence need no explanation. The values in the column headed "Slack interval" are obtained by subtracting in turn each time of H. W. (or L. W.) from tl.1e time of the corresponding slack. Similarly the values in the column headed "Strength interval" are obtained by subtracting the time of B. W. (or L. ·w.) from the time of the following strength. The column headed '"Velocity-Slack" is ruled to provide for the tabulation of the velocity at slack for those f:lt.ations at which the current never completely ceases but merely reaches a minimum velocity at about the time when it is changing direction most rapidly. By one-quarter ebb, or flood, is meant that phase of the current which occurs mi<lway in time between the slack and strength of the current. Similarly the phase called three-quarter ehb or fiood occurs after the streugtll or maximum of the current and midway in time bet'1"ee.11 it and tbe following slack. Since in this case slack before ebb occurs on an average at Jb 41m and strength of ebb at
/=P 41rn+411 3lm\ after 2 Governors Island H. W. or lh 25m (=3h oom_p 41m) after slack before ebb, in the aYerage. Hence the column of times of one-quarter ebb may be filled out either by adding 3h oom to each of the observed times of Governors Island H. W., or by adding 1 h 25m to each of the observed times of slack before ebb. In general the first method of procedure should be used, but in cases

like the present in which the times of slack are quite accurately determined the second method is allowable. The time of three-quarter ebb is in the same way made to depend on the time of L. W. at the reference tide station, or on the time of slack before flood, by the addition or subtraction of a constant quantity. Similarly for one-quarter and 'three-quarter flood, the general rule being to make each quarter point depend upon the nearest slack or upon the H. W. or L. W. at the reference tide station corresponding to that slack. The reference to H. W .'s or L. W .'s is decirledly preferable in all cases except those in which the slacks are very accurately determined. Having put in the times of quarter points the filling of the corresponding velocity columns is a mere question of interpretation of the record at those times. From the means of the various columns the following tabular statement may be made:

Having tabulated direction observed at each of the times given 1n the reduction as one-quarter ebb, the mean of these directions is the value gfren in the table. Similarly we obtain the mean directions corresponding to the other entries in the table. In an cases the currents are to be referred finally to one of the principal stations of the Tide Tables. ·when simultaneous tidal observations were not made at such a station the currents may usually be first referred to some subordinate tidal station in the vicinity at which observations were made at tl.ie same time as tbe current observations, and the results may then be referred to the principal staiion by means of the tidal differences. When no tidal observations were made at the same time as the current observations, which will but rarely be the case, the tides for those particular days at the principal station may be predicted- and these predicted tides used in the reduction. This method of reduction of currents for prediction purposes depends upon the following assumptions: I. That the inte1·val from high water, or low water, at the current station to the following slack water at the station is a constant. II. That the interval between high water, or low water, at the current i;tation, and the preceding: or following strength of current is a constant. III. That the interval between the time of high water at the reference tide station and the time of high water at tll('. current station is a constant. The sa.me assumption is made with respect to the low waters at tl1c two stations. IV. That the velocity anll direction of any phase of any ebb (or flood} current is the same as that of the corresponding pbase of any other ebb (or flood) current at the station. ~one of these assnmptions are strictly true and there must be small errors in the resuJts due to the errors of the assumptions. But theory and the records of observations confirm each other in showing that for the region from Hell Gate to Cape Henlopen the errors arising from the assump. tion are smaller than those arising from the errors of observation, especially if that term is used to designate the discrepancies between the velocities and directions as shown by the record, and the

velocities and directions which would be facts at the station if no causes were acting except the astronomical forces and the forces due to c01istant winds, currents, and fresli-water outflows. If in any region the errors dne to these assumptions are small as compared with tne errors of observation, as defined above, it is evident that no further complication in the method of reduction and prediction is desirable. And, indeed, it will be showu later in this report that there are other reasons why more accurate methods of reduction are undesirable. It is probable that the error introduced by assumption (I) is very small. It should be noticed that according to this assumption the time of slack water is supposed to be subject to tlie same periodic variatious, due to the moon's phase, declination, and distance, ancl the sun's declinations and distance, as the times of high water and low water at the station. Assumption (II) involves the same idea as assumption (I), but it also invokes the suppo.,;itlon that the interval from high water to the following low wa.tcr, or from low water to the following high water, is a constant. This is not true. But since only a part of the error is iutroduceu into the resul1; it is sufficiently near the truth. (III) is an assumption alrea<ly familiar from its use in referring the subordinate stations of the Tide Tables to the principal stations. Its error is probably insensible with tbe distances usually involved. Assumption (IV) declares that there is no variation in the velocity (or direction) at strength or at the quarter points corresponding to the daily, semiruontllly, and other periodic variatiom; in the height of high water and of low water. There can be no doubt but that such variations exist, but, as will be shown later, they are so small as to be nea1·Jy masked by the errors of obscrni.tion. For a test of these assumptions we may look to tile numerical results of nine of tue lougest; and" most reliable series that co1lld be found. The location of each station a.u<l the lengtli of the series of observations is given below. ''No. 3, Hell Gate. 1857," is near the north end of tile channel between Blackwells Island and Manhattan Island; eight days of observation. :'No. 4, Hell Gate, 1858,'' is near the north end of the channel bfltween Blackwells fal:rn~l and Long Island; nine days of observation. "No. 6, Hell Gate, 1857," is off Polhflmus Dock; eight days of observation. "No. 2, Hell Gate, 1858," is between Lawrence Point and Sunken Meadow, in East Rh"er; eight days of observation. "G, New York Harbor, 1858," is in the Narrows in the middle of the chanuel oppo~itl' Fort Tompkins Light; four days of observation. "No. 9, New York Harbor, 1858," is near the west side of East Bank; nine day;s of obsernttions. "Pettys Island, Delaware Hiver, 1886," is near the foot; of that island at Philadelphia.; five days of observation. . "New Castle, Del., 1886," is off New Castle~ about one-third across the river from the Delaware shore; seven days of observation. "Cape Henlopen, Del ware, 1886," is near Oape Henlopen, about 1 mile west of the whistling buoy; three days of observation. Although the series just named a.re not unbroken the breaks are short, and the length given above refers to what is left after the breaks are deducted. The measurements were made with Jog and line at all of the stations except Pettys Island and New Oastle, on the Delaware, where Price current metres were used.

The ordinary formula

A& the variation most likely to ooour iu these quantities. ou account of the error of the assumptions, is that arising from the semimonthly variation in the tide due to the moon's pbase, a column is adderI showing the time of the moon's transit at the beginning and end of tl.te observations. 'rlH· nnder;;:coring shows the cases iu which there is a well-defined grouping of signs of

But, on the other hanll, the grouping of the signs of the residuals in six cases out of thirty-six suggests a semimonthly >ariation due to the error of the assumption. But it is only ~t suggestion, and might or might not be \·eritied by a longer series of observations. It may be Llue to mc~teorological causes which may be classed as accidental.

The probable error of a single observation as derived from the final means, is: Velocity at strength, 0.15 knots, or 7 per cent. of total value. Velocity at one-quarter, 0.17 knots, ol' 9 per cent. of total value. Velocity at three.quarters, 0.18 lrnots, or 10 per cent. of total value.

([vvr was used in deducing the mean error of a single observation in each 'Vn-1 case, and the probable error taken as two-thirds of the mean error. As before, the underscoring indicates a well-defined grouping of the signs of the residuals. The average value of the probable error is so small that it can easily be accounted for as arising from the errors of observation-using that term as defined abo\·e. The residuals do not indicate any diurnal inequality corresponding to the diurnal inequality in the height of the tide. In sixteen eases out of fifty-four the residuals show, by a grouping of signs, a, regular increase or decrease dnring the period of oh~ervation. This is probably due to regular perioclic variations in the current, corresponding to similar variations in the tide, which are so small as to be concealed by the errors of observation in the other cases, and are nearly concealed in these case;-;. It should be noticed that for the two stations where the Price current meters were used the mean errors are considerably smaller than at the other stations. In making the reduction for these nine stations only nine observations of time were rtiiected and twelve observations of velocity. For a comparison of methods, a second separate reduction was made for each of these nine stations in which the times of slack and of strength were referred to the moon's transit. The residuals were treated in precisely the same way as in the other reduction. .As an average from the nine station, the computed probable error of a single reference of slack water to the moon's transit

is 15 minutes, as compared with 11 miuutes in the case of the reference to highs and lows, with thfrteen cases in which the residuals showed a grouping of signs as compared with four cases. The probable error of a single reference in both cases for strength is 23 minutes, with three cases of well defined gwuping of signs of residuals in the reference to transit and two in the reference to highs and lows. In comparing the two methods of prediction it must be remembered that there is no sensible error in the predictions of the moon's transit, while there must be au error in each prediction of a high or low water which will produce the corresponding error in the current predictions. But even when tbis is considered, it is still probable that the errors will be smaller in predicting by reference to higbs and lows than by the other method. In so far as any conclusion can be dra.wn from the residuals from such short series as those dealt with, the errors of approximation involved in the adopted method of reduction are smaller than the errors in the results due to errors of observation, as defineil above, for the region _from Hell Gate to Cape Henlopen. Judging by the character of the tides this conclusion probably holds good for all the Atlantic coast north of Cape Henlopen, except perhaps in the region about Nantucket, where there js a marketl interference between two tidal systems. In extending the use of the method beyond the region in which it bas already been used it will be necessary to be cautious. It is quite evil,}ent that it can not be used without modification on the Pacific coast, on account of the large diurnal inE>qnality of the tides . .As bearing upon the validity of assumptions (I) and (Ill), that tlie inten·al !Jetween high or low water at the reference tide station and the corresponding slack water at the current station is a constant, the following table of results deduced by the party of .Assistant G. Bradford from observations made during the years 1871-'i5 may be interesting. It is reasonable to suppose that the error in this assumption would be shown clearly by the difference between the value of the interval as derivell from the higher highs (or lower lows) aud the value derived from lower highs (or higher lows) in San Francisco Bay, where the diurnal ixrnquality in tlte tide is quite large. Let L,. be the interval in each case from lower low water to the slack before the large flood and S,. be the interval from higher low water to the slack before the small flood. Let LE aud S 11 have the same meanings with respect to the ebb currents and high waters. Then the results obtained are shown by the following tables:

At each station about three da,ys of c11rreut obsel'vatioui; were taken. The result shows that even with such peculiar tides as those in San Francisco Bay assumptions (I) and (III} are allowable. In deciding what degree of accuracy is desirable in a method of reduction and prediction it is necessary to consider not only the magnitude of the accidental error:s arising iu the course of the observations, as has been done above, but the rapidity of the Yariation of the current with a change of position must also be considered. P1·edictious made from observations taken at a single point can in strictness only be claimed to apply to that single point. Bnt predictions, to be of any practical use, must apply to some area, large or small as the case may be. In making a IJrediction which is to apply to an area by using obser>Tations at a, point or points witltin that area it. is evident that the error made in the extension of the data will depend direct!~' npon the rapidity with which the current varies with a change of position. Hence the degree of :\ccuracy desirable at a. point will depend on the rapidity of this change. That the velocity of tidal currents, as well as of riYcr current~, ucpeuds so closely upon the shape of the bottom aud shores and the total area of the cross section of the channel, that in most cases there is a rapid change in velocity in pn.ssing from point to point is a well established fact. And this fact makes the allowab1e errors of approximation in the methods of reduction and prediction, at least in so far as the velocities are concerned, much larger tlian they wonld he otherwise. But the variations of the times of slack and of strengtl1 of the current with a change of position are much slower, and hence, in the prediction of these times, more accuracy is desirable tlian in the prediction of velocities. For the same reason the value to the mariner of the prediction of times is greater than that of the prediction of velocities. In passing across a channel there is usually found to be a ntriation of a few minutes rn the times of' slack and of strength. In many cases it has been found that slack water and the reversal of direction of the current occurs first in the more sheltered portions of the channel and later in portions of the channel where the water has more freedom of motion. In passing from point to point lengthwise a channel, keeping in the deeper imrt.s, the times of slack and of strength vary in general with about the same rapidity as the times of11igh water and of low water, and therefore the variation in the intervals local high water to local slaek before ebb, local high water to strength of ebb, etc., is comparatively slow.

To sum up briefly, the following statements rnay be made ]n regard to current predictions:

Current observations have been made by Coast Survey parties at more than 1,800 statious, the length of series at each station \'arying from a few hours to 14 days. In addition to these observations, much general current information has been gathered, principally in connection with the Coast Pilots. While these observations are iu most cases somewhat defective in having been made by crude methods and with instn'lments not admitting of accurate observation, their principal defect for the purposes of prediction is the shortness of the serfos. This shortness of the serieA makes it impossible to E>liminate the accidental errors to any considerable extent, and leaves but a slight basis for tl1e estimation of the magnitude of such errors. But a much more serious difficulty is that such series furnish no adequate means of determining the semimonthly or other periodic variations; nor- of testing satisfactorily tke validity of assumptio'IUI 01i which the methods of reduction an(l predictwn are based. Three or four series of one month each of continuous observations, with the instrnrncuts now available, at widely-separated stations-at least one of them being on the Pacific coast-would serrn to put current prediction on a sound basis and would add greatly to tlte worth of the observations ali-ea,dy recorded. Such would be the immediate practical value of a few long series, even though their scientific beariug on tidal theory and physical hydrography be ignored. Of the current observations actually made but a small proportion have been used in making current predictions. Until 1888 the predictions made were published as tables in the Coast Pilots and on charts, supplemented on the charts by arrows placed at the station of observation showing the direction and velocity at various phases of the current. In all these tables the times, if given at all, are referred to the moon's transit~ Now that by means of accumulated tidal reductions the tides can be predicted quite closely on all important parts of our coast it seems desirable that these cni:rent predictions should be referred to the tidal predictions instead of to the moon's transit, although the latter reference was probably the better of the two at the time when it was made. Such a reference of the currents to

the tides is fully ~s convenient for use as the reference to moon's tl'ansit aml is to be preferred because it will probably represent the facts more accurately. This new system of reference was commenced in Bulletin No. S and is extended to :fifteen stations in the Atlantic Tide Tables for 1891. As to the exact method to be used in the reference of the currents to the tides, that ii:; 11 matter which must be determined by future experience and which can only be settled on a sound b;tsis by tlle treatment of a few series of at least one month's observations. The method set forth in this report has the support of such series as have been treated, and promisei:; to apply with sufficient accuracy and rapidity to the Atlantic coast of the United States north of Cape Henlopen.

COMPARISON OF THE PREDICTED WITH THE OBSERVED TIMES AND HEIGHTS OF HIGH AND LOW WATER AT SANDY HOOK, NEW JERSEY, DURING THE YEAR 1889.
A report by ALEX. S. CIIRISTI:FJ, in char~e of the 'L'id<tl Division, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. of' the results of an investigation made under his direction by John F. Hayford, t.idal computer.

[Submitted for publioatilm July 18, 1890. 1

The tidal station at Sandy Hook, New Jemey, at which two automatic gauges, Saxton C. & G. S. Nos. 30 and 40, have been in simultaneous operation since December 1, 1886, is located on the west side of the Hook, at the terminus of the New Jersey Southern Railroad, in the nortbern edge of a small recess or cove of Sandy Rook Bay calletl the Horseshoe, in latitude 400 26' 52" N., longitude 740 00' 12" W. from Greenwich. The times and heights of bigh and low water annually published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in Tide Tables for the Atlantic Coast of the United States have been predicted, beginning with the volume for 1885, by means of Professor Ferrel's maxima and minima tide-predicting machine, the amplitudes and epochs of the tidal components used in tlle setting being taken from Professor Ferrel's Report on the Ilarmonic Analysis of the Tides at Sandy Hook, Appendix No. 9, Coast and Geodetic Snrl"ey Heport for 18~3. Professor Ferrel's analysis covered the six years, 1876-'81, and as tl.te observations for that period were made at a station in Horseshoe Cove within a few hundred feet at tbe most of the site of the i1resent gauges, a comparison of the predictions with the present series of observations seemed a fair test of our power to predict for that station, using the resnlts of the harmonic analysis in Professor Ferrel's synthetic machine. It seemed highly desirable to institute such a. comparison. No extended and thorough com. parison, with adequate discussion, had yet been made for the purpose of testing the whole apparatus engaged iu the proc.luction of the annual Tide Tables-the observations upon which they are based, the method of the harmonic analysis of tides, the sufficiency of the tide-predicting machine, the faithfulness of the operator, the copyist, the compositor, and the proof reader. The station lies close to the pathway of an enormous commerce, and here, if anywhere, we should know exactly what we are doing; the more so that our predictions of the tidal currents in that locality have recently been referred to the times of high and low water, instead of to the moon's meridian transit as formerly. The observations for the calendar year 1889, although not absolutely continuous, nor wholly free from email defects both in time and height relations, were better than those for any other year, and they were accordingly selected for tbe purpose. The times and bcights of high and low water were read from the tidal curve produced by gauge No. 30, of wl!ich the scale is approximately sions, which were few, supplied when possible from the curve of gauge No. 40, of which the scale is approximately ~.

record-and omis-

The reading scale was set to give directly the heights on the staff

used since September 2, 1887, and the times were corrected for the clock error noted on the tidal roll. This-last-mentioned record of clock error was somewhat defective, and there is reason for believing that errors of 8 or 4 minutes, and occasionally of double that amount, affect from H. Es:. 80-45 105

time to time the values adopted. The number of tides occurring a.t Sandy Hook during the year was 705 high and 705 low waters; 700 high and 701 low waters were observed by means of the two gauges. These were tabulated and compared with the tides afforded by machine prediction. In order that the heights derived from observation and prediction might be directly compara. blc it was necessary to reduce the observations t-0 the plane of mean low water of the charts, which was not poss1 ble for lack of proper references of the chart plane to extant benchmarks ashore. Nor were the levels between bench mark and tide staff sufficiently frequent or precise during the progress of the earlier self-registering series at this station (1875-'84) to warrant the adoption of the low-water plane of that series. To obtain an approximate plane I proceelled as follows: The half-tide level, derived in October, 1888, from the high and low waters observed from the jnception of the present series, December 1, 1886, to March 31, 1888, including therefore 16 com· plete and 2 incomplete lunations, reads on the staff used in 1889:

The mean range, derived from several series from 1844 to 1858, aggregating abou.t 3 years of record, is 4.6(i feet, and the semi-range is 2.33 feet, with an unknown probable error estimated at 0.1 of a foot; hence, the reading upon the staff of 1889 of the plane of mean low water derived from 3 years of observations is ·
Ft. Ft.

4·59 :l 0·10

The predicted heights of high and low waters are given to tenths of feet, the observed heights are also tabulated to tenths; hence, for the purposes of this Ct>mparison, we reduced the observa.. tions of 1889 to the approximate or assumed plane of reference of the charts and tide tables by subtracting 4.6 feet from each individual height. The observations are made in Eastern Standard (75th meridian) time, which is 5 hours slower than Greenwich mean civil time; the predictions published for 1889 are in mean local civil time. For this comparison we subtracted 4 minutes from the published predictions and thus reduced them to standard time. The fundamental harmonic elements at Sandy Hook, used iu the published predictions and in this investigation, are given in the following table. A is the amplitude or semi-range and Ethe lag. In addition to the published predictions it was decided to compare two other sets of pre. dictions with the observations, and hence it will be well to define the methods of setting the machine to obtain the several sets.

The following facts noted while doing the numerical work are important as bearing upon the problem of determining to what extent the observed differences between prediction and observation are due to meteorological and other causes not connected with the machine, and to what extent they are due to error in the moobine. The error in height usually has the same sign for all four of the predicted points occurring during any one day. Then. ie a tendellOy for ciU the height diiferences to retain the same sign for several days at a time. -

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

Both the abo~e remarks apply to Ute time differences also; but to a mncb smaller degree. There is no rt.llltion apparent between the signs of the height differences and the signs of the time differences occurring on the sarue day. · There is no relation apparent between the magnitude of the height differences and the magnitude of the time differenct>s occurring on the same day. In general the error in the range is less than the error in the height. As shown both by the tabulated individual diflerences and by the tabulated means. sums, etc., the three independent predictions agree with eack Qther much t1wre closely than any one of them agrees with the observations. As shown bJ' the tables of monthly means of the diflerences, during about one-half the year tbeforenoon high water time differences are slightly greater than the afternoon high water time differences, and the reverse is true during the otlwr half of the :rear. Tl.le same statement is true with respect to the low water time differences. During any particular month when the forenoon bigll water time difference is greater than the afternoon high water time difference, the forenoon low water time difterence is nsnally less than the afternoon low water ti me d1ffere11 ce, and dee i·er .~a. Similarly, there is a slight diurnal inequality in the height differences for both low water and high water, whicL in each ca:m persists for about six months before clianging sign. For a11y one month the sign of this height inequality is usually the same for highs as for lows in contrast to the difference in sign in the case of times. Any error in the position of the sliding frame of tbe machine which bas a horizontal motion will at this station affect heights but slightly, and will cause the times of both highs and lows to be in error in the same direction by the same amount in tbe mean. Any error in the position of the sliding frame of the machine which bas a vertical motion will affect the times but slightly, and will change the range and tend to cause the error in high water height to have the opposite sign from that of the error in low-water height. As bearing upon the question of how large a rart of tbe recorded differences between prediction and observation eau be accounted for as errors in registering the tides and in interpreting the record, the following statement is pertinent here. From a comparison of 14~ highs and 148 lows observed with a self.registering gauge at .Mission Street \Vharf, San Francisco, Cal., Septem· ber 28-Decemlier 15, 1889, with a simultaneous self-registered record at Sausalito, Cal.: Probable error of a single observation of high-water time . · =±5.Sm. Probable error of a single observation of low-water time =±4.7m. Probable error of a single observation of height at high or at low water =±0.1 foot. These deduced results depend upon the assumption that the difference in time and height of the tide at tlie two places is a constant. The error in this assumption must have the eftect of increasing the deduced result. Illustrations Nos. 66 and 67 exhibit graphic~lly the distribution with respect to magnitude of the discrepancies bt>tween prediction by method III and observation. As explained on the plates . themselves, the broken lino represents the distribntion of the actual discrepancies, the discon· tin nous liue is the same, but rendered less jagged by four successive bisections of chords, and, for comparison, the smooth curve has been added to represent tLe theoretical <listribution of the same number of errors purely accidental. To obtain a measm·e of the error of adjustment and setting of the machine, the :first twenty days of January were 1nedicted five consecutive times by method III, the machine being re·adjnsted before each setting. The probable error of adjustment and setting so found isFor high-water times ± 3·1m. For low-water times :±3·2"'. For high-water heights ± 0·03 foot. For low-water heights :±0·03 foot. The following conclusions are based upon the results of the preceding investigation: (1) The plane of reference of the son1.1lings and charts at Sandy Hook being lost and blrecoverable, for lack of a. permanent benchmark ashore connected with the tide staff by levels, t.be tide.

tables can not be made to exactly fit the charts at that station. But as this discrepancy is most probably not in excess of a half foot, it is rather a theoretical than a serious practical detect, the rise and fall being of more importance than niceties in the absolute deptbs. Ne\'ertheless it is a defect easily avoidabh~, and it should always be avoided, by the esta!Jlishment of shore marks of a permanent charactt·r. The quantity-two-tenths of a foot-by which the ob::ierved appear to exceed the predicted heights in 1889 (see Table 8) depends for magnitude aml sign upon a plane of reference derived through doubtful levels from a sel'ics other than that used in reducing the soundings, and hence has no special significance for the problem in hand. The mean range of the tides predicte1l and published for 1889 was less than that derived from observation by only twohundredths of a foot. Setting the machine by Mr. Hayford's method (HI) reduces the discrepancy to two thousandths ancl reverses its sign. In both cases it is practically zero. (2) The Ti<le Tables for 1889 on an average gave the times of high water too early by i2m, and the times of_ low water too early by ism. Having carefully adjusted the machine and set it by l\fr. Hayford'H method these numbers wonld bave Ileen 2m anti 9m, respectively. Hence, setting the machine by Ur. ll;iyford's method after careful adjnstment and putting the solar hand forward 5m we should expect the machine to give the high waters 3m late and the low waters 4m earlyquantities of the same order as the unavoidable errors of careful adjustment and setting of the machine, and from every practical poiut of view insignificant. But until the matter is teilted by another actual experiment it would be unsafe to say thact we can predict another year, by any method, with so small an average error for the year. I would prefer to say that this constant part of the error would not exceed 6 or 8 minutes. (:3) There is a barely perceptible failure in the predictions to take full account of the diurnal inequality, probably due to a slightly erroneous value of the amplitude and lag of the component of sidereal speed. With this ex:ceptioo, tbe v11riable part of the d~screpaucy between prediction and observation is accidental, meteorological, hence non-predictable. The non-predictable part of the discrepancy is considerably larger than the constant part considAred in the preceding para· graph, antl greatly in excess of any failure to take account ot: the ti(lal components themselves. (4.) Method II, in which the machine is set for time, afterward for height, the year being rnn through for each setting, is unnecessarily laborious. The use of a compromise setting and tLe prediction of both times and heights by running through the year once, which is a part of Professor Ferrel'i; system, is fully justified. Tbe compromise setting proposed by .Mr. Hayford (III) seems better than the one hitherto in use (I) and will be employed iu the predictions for 1892. Metholl I is the traditional one in the tidal division, but as it differs from the compromise method published by Professor Ferrel-formula (19), pp. 258, Appendix No. 10, &port for 1883-in multiplying the amplitudes by the factor ii.-+:i0 on both sides of themachine, I suspect that it may have arisen from
·

"c

~i1

some misunderstanding of Professor Ferrel's verbal directions at a. time when tbe machine and the whole process was novel. Professor Ferrel's formula (l9) will be used in the next comparison of prediction with observation. The process of comparison is a laborious one and I found that it was not advisallle to go farther with it this ;rear before beginning the predictions for 1892. A slight modification of the amplitude on the outer cranks, and of the epochs of the diurnal components, to correct for the yielding of the parts of the machine, resorted to in Method I (see Table 2), does not seem necessary, nor to be jnstifiable in principle, from an inspection of the machine in operation. The working of the mechanism is in·leed freer frl'm defects, and the errors a.rising from sncb mechanical defects are smaller, than woulcl appear probable at first sight. There is some slack. motion in ep()ch, more marked. of course in the larger cmnponents, but this is symmetrical about a mean position (with which initially the setting should ooincide), is small, and is partl_v,eliminated by non-agreement of sign among the several components. This is the most thorough test to which Professor Ferrel's tide predicting machine has yet l>een subjected. It may be reiterated that the comparison is a test of tlie character of the observation8 in 1876-'81, and in 1889, of the predicting ma.chine, of the correctness of Professor Ferrel's analysis of the Sandy Hook tides (Appendix: 9, &port for 1883), of the prmciples of the harmonic analyllis of tides, of our ability to use the combined apparatus for predictiou purposes and 800 that the published 1>redictions are not vitiated by cleriea.l a.ud typographical errors.

714

Tbe result is a very gratifying one. It enables us to assert that our predictions for Sandy Hook are almost as perfect as they can ever be made by any means whatever, and, in view of meteorological disturbances, as pertect as it is desirable to have them. We are now also able to state with precision how large the meteorological disturbances usually are and bow often disturbances of an assigned magnitude arc likely to occur. In short, we now know what we are doing, what more we should endeavor to do, and wl1at can not be done. This work has been execntell with charact~ristic ability and tho1·ougbness by Mr. John F. Hayford, and this paper is essentially his. For the results of former comparisons of the machine predictions with obsel'vatiou, I would refer to page 271, Appendix 10, lteport for 1883.

ON THE RELATION OF THE YARD TO THE METRE.
By 0. H. TITTMA.NN. Assistant.

[Published June 15, 188\J.

Submitted for republication, with additions, January, 1891.]

PREFATORY NOTE. The paper prepared by Assistant O. H. Tittmann, with the title "On the ltela.tion of the Yard to the Metre," was first published in June, 1889, as U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey Bulletin No. 9. It. has been deemed desirable to republish it as an appendix: to this report, not only to give it a more permanent form, but also because the results reached by Mr. Tittmanu ha\'e since been confirmed by some comparisons made between English standards and the metric standards of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, as shown in his concluding statement. T. C. MENDENHALL, Superintendent of ·weights and 11foasures.

It ha_s seemed to me highly desirable to investigate the sources of the discrepancy iu the values assigned to the ratio of the yard to the metre. The inherent clifficnlty of comparing a line measure, such as a :yard, with an end measure, such as the French metre, Rtandards which have no aliquot part iu common, and the uncertainties introduced by the difference in the standard temperatures and in the materials of which the standards are composed, have been deemed sufficient. to account for the divergencies ·alluded to. On the other hand, the values usually cited were deduced by men skilled in the art of comparing standards, and not only perfectly familiar with t!Je knowledge of their iimes, but who were themseh·es the authorities t-0 whom others looked for information. I therefore sought for the cause in the standards which they used, an(l ha··e succeeded in reconciling the discrepancies within unexpectedl,y narrow limits by referring all the observations to a common standard-the present British Imperial Yard-using the Committee Metre (the D.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey standard) as the metric unit, and as the intermediary by means of which this was made possible. It will appear from the following brief statement tliat by means of our knowledge of the coefficient of expansion of our Committee Metre, the absolute cxpa11sions of the following length measu10es involved in this discussion cian be established with a greater or less degree of accuracy:
TS.-The U. S. Troughton scale of 82 inches, comparnd by Hassler in 1817 with the Committee Metre, OM. No. 6.-An iron metre belonging to the U.

The results of Kater's comparisons b in 1818, bet.ween the Shucklmrgh scale and the Royal Society's Platinum Metre a traits PM., and with a platinum metre a bout, as computed by him, gave the well-known value 39·37079 inches. Before we can reduce his observations, it becomes neces1-1ary to deduce tho coefficient of expansion of the Roya.I Society's metre a traits P~I., which we can do with much accuracy, as follows: The coefficieut of OM. iR 11·795 x 10-6 , The ~·elath·e expansion between CM. and No. 6 is expressed by the equation hetween these bars C.:\I.-No. o = 0·00000i3m ·000000124 t;

RAIL Y'S COMPARISONS.

fl

In 1835 Baily made an extended and very carefully conducted series of comparisons ,, between the Uoyal Astronomical Society's scale and PM. He assumed a coefficient of 5·05 x 10-· for 10 Ji'.= 9-<l9 x 10-· for 1 o C. for P:\f., whicll agrees so closely with the one deduced by me from actual obser·'ations on its relative expansion, namely, 9·126, as previously shown, that a recomputation of bis numerous results does not appear necessary. His comparisons were made at temperatures varying between 28·60 and 80·9° F. The mean temperature (according to· his way of combiniug the observations) of his comparisons was about 54 F. = 12·2o C., and therefore, by introducing the coefficient deduced by me, his value would be changed. by only 12·2 x 39·37 x ·000000036 = ·000017 inch, by which amount. it must be diminished. The final result as ginm by him is .P.~i. = 39·368985; diminishing this Yalue by the quantity 0·000017, we obtain as bis result PM. = 39·368968 inehes of the Hoyal Astronomical Society's scale; but since this scale, as compared with the present Imperial Yard, is standard at 60·78° F.,c we obtain, using Baily's coefficieut for the scale, viz: 10·48 x 10-a for 1° F., PM.= 39·36947 inches of the Imperial Yard; substituting for PM., its Yalne in terms of OM., we get, as the result of Baily's observations·

It should be noted that Baily also compared PM. with his own Tubular scale No. 5 and with Simms' Tubuhtr scale No. 4, and his mean of the:m comparisons differs only .000026 inch from the result of the comparison wrtlt the Royal Astronomical Society's scale, being that much greater;

lrnt as their values depend on the correctness of the metre distance on the Royal .Astronomical Soei<>ty's scale, the result would not be sufficiently independent to IJe quoted here.

The value 39·37043~, usually quoted as Clarke's Yalue of the metre, is derived .tom ltis admirable comparisons of the yard with certain Toises (reduced to the Toise du Perou), whence the value of the metre was inferred from the legal definition of its ratio to the Toise; but it is not derived from tbe comparison of the yard with the Metre des Archives or auy 'vell antl1>.'uticated copy. If Arago's certificate accompanying the Royal Society's Platinum 1\.Ietre refers to tbe .:\letre of the Observatory as the standard, the correction+ 17·59µ given by him i;;lwultl be diminished by -about 3µ, the excess of the metre of the Observatory over that of the Archives, found iu 1826." But there is reason to believe that Arago's certificates can not be relied on to give the (kgree of accuracy implied liy their wording. It is shown in this paper tlrnt. the Platiumn Met.re of the Royal Society is about 7;1 too short.

This is derived from comparisons of the U. S. Lake Survey Standard Metre (R:\L ;" witll a steel en<l yard, eompare(l by Colouel Clarke, R. E., 'vith Standard Yard .'J5. of the Onlnanet~ Snrvey. The length of the U.S. Lake Survey standard (ltM.) was compared at tl.ie International Burean of Weights aml Measures at Paris, and through the adopted Provisional International Stam1anl it is referrecl to tlic Metre des Archives.

From this it appears that the Shucklmrgh sea.le was taken to the International Bureau of Weigh rs and Measures near Paris, and that the space 0-39·4 of the scale was compared with the metric standards of that Bureau. It was found that at 9·3rn° C. the space 0 - 39·4 Shnckburgh = 1m·000624. .As stated on a previous page, this space = 39·399393 incnes at 150.99 C. Taking the coefficient of expansion of the Shuckbnrgh scale = ·00001886 per degree C., and reducing the comparii'ous made at tlrn International Bureau to this temperature, we find that at 15·990 C. 0-39.4 = 1'0 ·000749, and hence
39 ·399393 - 39·36990 · ·h lm - l ·OOU7 49 - ' me es, which tends to confhm the relation of the Yard to the Metre found in the preceding discussion, and also to confirm the value deduced for the Royal Society's Platinum l\fetre PM.; that is, PM.= 1m_ 7·0,u at (}O 0. Another value is furnished by the Spanish four-metre bar, so well known in the history of motleru geodesy. The length of tliis bar in terms of the Imperial Yard was determined by Clarke iu 1869 to be 4·37493562 yards at 160·25. Its length in terms of the Interuatioual Prototype Metre, as determined at the International Bureau of 'Veights and Measures in 1885, was found to be

Mr. President aml Delegates of the International Geodetic Association: An Act of Congress at its last Session authorized tlie President of the United States of America to appoint a delegate to this Association; and on the 7th of September Professor Mendenhal1, the recent1y appointed Superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, gave me, after two conferences, the necessary instructions to appear as the representative of that great national work. I bring from him kindly greeting and good will to you all, a hearty sympathy with the objeetR and labors of the Association, and a conviction that its views will grow with the breadth of the New World before it. For myself and my colleagnes in the Coast aud Geodetic Survey I"repeat the sentiments of the Superintendent; and feel that we shall ]earn much by the free interchange of experiences and opinions with you all, personally an<l officiall;y. The Superintendent directed me to bring such outline schemes of the later progress of the work of the Survey in its different branches as would enable mo to make explicit explanations of the objects, scope, methods, means, 1·ate of progress, and prospective views of the Coast aml Geo· detic Survey. I did not expect to give more than a verbal description or the work, but in oruer to conform to your system in the Conference, I feel compelled even at such short notice to put my remarks upon paper. Before I take up the snbject-matters retened to i11 m,y instructions, it will be well for us to bear in mind the extent of tlw territary of the United States, excluding Alaska. It stretches from the sixty-seventh nearly to the one hundred and tweut~'-fifth degree of longitude, arnl from the forty :liuth to the twenty-sixth tlegTee of latitude. The leugths of the diagonals from the northern part of the State of Maine to San Diego aucl from Key West in I<'lorida to Cape Flattery at the Strait of Juan de Fuca are nearly equal at 2 880 statute miles, or 4. 64:0 kilometres. Tue line along the parallel of soo is 2 628 statute miles in length, or 4 250 kilometres. On the north we have the Dominion of C;rna.da, some of whose scientific atltlrnrities J1ave expressed their liope of co-operation with the Uniterl States in the measurement of arcs of the meridian and of the parallel, so. that we can stretch northward to the Arctic Oceall. On the south lies our sister Republic of .Mexico, through wltose territory the great central are of the meridian can be carried as far south as latitude 10°. Bnt for our present purpose we are necessarily restricted t.o the limits of the territory or the Uniood States as I haYe rougltly describell them. The views of the Coast and Geodetic Survey ltave expantled with the acquisition of new territory and the new demands of all our. industries; and their influence has been far-reaching and yet eminently practical. The dift'erent States have become interested, a.ud many of them are

conducting trigonometrical surveys based upon standard lines furnished by our work. The Go\·ernment of the United States has called upon the Coast and Geodetic Sur"\'"ey for the deter· mi1iation of fundamental positions in tlrn boundaries of the llewer States; and it is only this season that two of our parties 11ave been dispatched to the Yukon and Porcupine Hivers in northern .Alaska, to fix tlte position of tlrn one hundred and forty-first meridian, "\\hich marks vart of tlw boundary between Canada ant.I the United States. The nrnn·elons ,1evelopnw11t or commerce, agriculture, and manufactures upon the Pacific coast of the United States within the last forty years demanded norel methods for the rapid production of preliminary but safe charts; and the increasing needs of 1Hn·igation ha\'C within the last few years demanded a new feature by the execution of topographical reconnoissauces "\\ith the plane table of those wild and forested parts of the uortheru coast where land transportation is extremely difficult, and which the regular operations will be a long time in reaching. Hundreds of miles of this rocky coast were :,;uccessfnlly stirYeyell in one Rl10rt season. The PITYSICAL :FEATURES of the surface of the territory of tlm United States will bear a few words of explanation arnl description. Along the coasts of tile Atlantic an<l Gulf of l\foxico the shores are low arnl nearly all sandy. The "landfall" is g<merally made hy a Yesst>l when slle is "·ell on soundings. Far hdiinrl this low coast lies the tl1e range of mountains, attaining an cle\·ation of oYer 6 000 feet (1 s:m metres), and extmali1ig from .Maine to .Alaliama. These mountains are invisible from seaward, except in the northeast. 'iYestward of tlii,; ra11ge lies a broad rolling conutry, extensh·e prairies, arnl then the enormously long-, gentle, and t1·eclcss RlopeR to the high flank of the Hocky Mountains. The great range of the Hock;r Mountains extends north and south through and hr~·ornl the territory of the United States, and is the backbone of tlie conutr,v. 'l'heucP westwanl the mon11tains and the high 11late;H1s and the intervening valleys reaeh to the Pacific Ocean. Along that cmlRt the Sierra NeYada and Cascade Mountains amt 11w jmmediate Coast Uanges lie iJarallel with the coast line. lnstPatl of the low Rhorrs of tlrn Atlantic and Gulf coasts, we ha vc on the Pacific, mouutai11s that reach au elPY:ttion of 5 000 feet (1 iJ30 metres) within less than three mih.·>; (fi·e kilometre8) of the short'. Thu'' landfall" is made at se·ent,1 ancl eight)· uautical miles (l~;"J to 145 kilometres), far within which distance the plateau of the bottom of the Pacific Ocea11 1caelies the profonnd depth of 2 000 fathoms, or 3 660 metres. These liolrl aml extraonliuary foatures of the coast have compelled the Coast and Geodetic Sur>ey to increase the breadth of its topograph· ical work, :rnr1 to <·arr:y it far t·mmgh iulaml to em brace the CI'<·stline of the immediate coast moun· tains ns :.::een from s<>award. Thron;:rh part of tbe mountainous country between the eastern line of the Hocky Mountains and the east.-rn flanks of the Sierra NeYada and tlrn Casca(le :\lo1111tainl'< the climate is exceptionally dry, the h>mperatnre Yery high in summer and very lo\V in winter, the Rky gt>nerally cloudlefls and the land arid. Yon will therefore readily understand that throughout that section of the country, where elevations of 13 000 feet (3 !)65 metres) have to be occupie!l with large instruments commnnding lines over 100 miles (160 kilometres) in le.ugth, and where no or .-ery few roads exist, and the population is extremely sparse, the execution of the work is Yery ReYcrc upon offi· cers, men, ancl animals; and the cost is relath·ely large. The mouutaius in that region are treeless; but on the Pacific coast the mountains north of 38~ degrees of latitude are co\·ered with enormously large timlwr to their i;:mmmits; and either large areas of this forest must be cleared at eaclt station or very bigh observing structures must be erected. (l>er this hroad and many featured country the Coast and Geodetic Survey twenty years since connected the triangnlation of the Atlantic coast with that of the Pacific by t<>legraphic longitude; and projected the transcontinental arc of the parallel to link the two schemes by a strong chain of triangles. It would be im11racticable ancl too tedious to place before you t11e mass of interesting and instrnctfre materials which the progress of the Coast and Geodetic Survey has de-voloped; or to speculate upon the magnitude and importance of the practical work which it sees ahead; and so I come back to the short and succinct memoranda which I have made upon the points which the Superintemlent has briefly mentioned in his instructions. If at any point I shall venture to express views that are open to differences of opinion, I beg

that yon will believ~ that I express them without bias, freely and independently, and with a sincere desire to correct my jurlgment.
I.-THE PLAN OF THE TRIANGULATION ALONG THE COASTS OF TFIE e!S"ITED STATES.

Primarily the United States Coast Survey was organized by the GoYernment for the sur.,-ey of the coast, as its name clearly implies. This necessarily involved the obtaining of information to give the geographical positions of islands, headlands, anchorages, harbors, and dangers to navigation, the determination of the proper location and character of aids to mn·ig-ation; the depth of water on the bars at the entrauces to harbors and ri·ers, and tLe courses and depths of the rivers to the heads of navigation; the collection of data for the prediction of the tides, and for the course of current8. Then followed the pulllication of seacoast and harbor charts, and the later pu~Jlication of " <Joast Pilots," compiled from the charts, and gathered from the experience of the officers. These are some of the first legitimate results of such a seherne. TU.is principal object ha.>! been per»isteutly and faithfully adhered to in the administration of the Survey, as is shown hy the publication of many hundreds of charts, of lists of gr-ograpliical positions, of" .Metl10lls au<l Resnlts," of ti(le tables, of notices to mariners, and of the Coast Pilots; and of special correlated in vestigatiorns. Through snch an extended seaboard as that of the United States it must be e>ident to yon all that the most trustworthy results c~w only lm obta,ined by tlle liigh character oftlrn triangulation upon wllich the project i.s founrletl, allll liy till~ practical Yalne and iwport:mcc of tl.le topography and bydrograph_y. In tile execution of these correla.tP(1 branches the material lrns nPcessaril,y heeu acqnirt>cl for the measurement of arc,; of the meridian in various sections of the coast. A8 the Sun-ey developed, and as new territory was acquired, and new applications were found for tl.le work, jt was seen that larger schemes of trian~ulati<m would be IH:ceRsary, both as a matter of economy and gn·ater accuracy, and because they wonld furnish a higher and more e:x:teusini class of measures for Gt>odetic pnrposes. E>'ery pr.wtical 1h>111aml upoll thP. service has been promptly met} and with increaset1 efficiency. \Vlrnuen~r the Sttn-ey has s11own to tlie Con;::rcss of the United States the ad ntntage.'i and the neces,,ity for hrna.1ler scope in its 01rnratiou, it has recei>ed the attention and the active support of that angntit body.

Tliis are of the parallel will be more explicitly rrnmtioned undm: the heading UL It "-as int<·n<kd primarily to connect the ::>chemes of the triangulations following the coast liuPs of the Atlautic and the Pacific seaboards. i.\Iy earliest duties on the Pacific coast Lad bt>en, among other things, the determination of the latitude aml longitmle of important headlamh;, blarnls, aud harbors, before a continuous triangulation was foasible along a coast that had then more than :i 000 nautical miles (5 550 kilometres) of shoreline. The triangulation was in progress, I.mt its exeeu· tion was carried on in mauy localities where commerce demanded aids to 11a·ig<iti011. Early in 1869 the telegraphic <liff'erence ill longitude between San Francisco an<l the eastern tl'iangulatio11 was effectell; and all the triangulations were subsequently connected. But as the principal triangulation on the Pacific expaudell, tlie Superintendent decided to carr;y a li11e of triangulation as uroad as possible acro,;s tlte continent. This would afford means and data to clJCck important State boundaries, to afford standard lines and geographical positions for the use of tl10 rntkpendently conducted State surveys; and would incidentally gi;·e the data, for tho measure of so loug an arc. The Government approved of this scheme of triaugnlation, and has annuall.r supported it by appropriatious. The Pacific coast tria,ngulations had been dependent upon base lines measured with secomlmT apparatus at each locality. This new departure demauded a higher class of base apparata>;, and to-!lay the western end of the chain depends upon the meaimrernent of the Yolo base line, wllich also serves for the expansion of the Pacific arc of the meridian to the north and to the south. Aud probably it will be as well to introduce in this place the different operations which have boon made nt all the stations on the Pacific coast, and in the adj a.cent scl1emes. The stations so occu· pied numl>er twenty-throe from the Sierra Nevada westward, aud tift.een or more to the ea.st ward. I present to the Association several ''progress sketches" which are also regularly published in the annual reports of the Superintendent. On these are exhibited the lines observed, the base

figures acljusted, the parts already reconnoitered, and the spaces yet unfinished. One of these sketches exhibits not only the western part of the chain of triangles, !Jut the extension of the triangulation for the Pacific arc to the south and to the north. At all the stations of the main triangulation on the Pacific coast and extending eastward therefrom along the arc of the parallel of 390, tlie ohser,atious comprise the following: Hori;;ontal dircctions.-These are made under all conditions of the a.tmosphere, when the sig· nals cau be seeu with tLc telescope. No more than two sets of observations are made in any one morniug or in au afternoon. Each set consist8 of an observation with the telescope and circle direct, and one with the telescope and circle reverse. For lines umler 100 miles in length (160 kilometres), 46 ohsen-ations have been made in twenty-three positions; all(l for li11Ps OYer 100 miles in leugtb, fi9 sets of ohsenations were made at the last stations. Two sets have hrretofore been made in one position of the horizontal circle, but my experience dictates that hereafter only one set shall ue made in one position, and the number of positions will necessarily be nearly doubled. In 187G the methotl of using thl~ ocular micrometer was introduced at Mount Diablo station, and the obser\·ations have been impro,-cd tllcreby. The theodolite cil'cle is !.m inches or 50·8 centimetres in diameter, and is read by three microscope micrometers. The objective is 7·i3 centimetres in diameter. Tile instrnmeut rests upon a specially devised position circle which is cewented upon the stone or brick. pier. A::iuwth obsl'rrntions.-The tbeodolite which is employed for the horizontal directions is also used fol' the determination of tlrn azimuth of one of the lint's of the triangulation, or upon a reference station tllat is usnally 6 to 10 miles distant. The stars ~1sually obser\'ed upon are a Ursro Mi11oris mid 4165 B. A. U. at opposite elongations, and as uear elongation as practicable. The series generally includes observations before and observations after elongation. I Jiani made the same number of observations at each base-line station as at all the other stations. lJatitiule o/Jserrntions.-These are made with the Zenith t(>lescopc or with the DaYi<lson Meridian I nstnmw11t according to the Talcott method, and generally em brace observations upon 2;'; to 30 pairs of stars through 7 to 10 nights. I baYe made tbe same number of ouservatious at each base-Hoo station as at all the otbers. 1'he north polar distances of the stars are obtained from ahont thirty original authorities. Obserration.~ for lieight.-Douhle zenith distances are measured upon tile signals at all the other .,tatio11s hetweeu the hours from noon to one or two o'clock in the afternoon. They are continued through as many day.-; as practicable. The vertical circle is usually 12 inches (or 30 centimetres) in cliamete1·. O/i.yerrations /01· 11utg1tetib'11z..-Observations for intensity, dip, and declination are made with portable inf!truments uriou three or more days at ever.r station. Tl1e 8ignal.<; ustd iu this work are always heliotropes m·-en for the base-Jiue stations; aud the area for the silvered glass is determined by formula for the distance observed, with an abitrary :ulditio11 for n. smoky and hazy atmosphere, as suggested by experience. These signals ha\-e been .st~Pll with tlw unassisted eye at distances to 160 miles or 256 kilometres. A curious optical featnre of tht>se images is the decomposition of the solar light into the spectrum red, white, and blue, or more rart>ly into red, yellow, and green, iu lines that are oYer liO or 70 miles in length, the inter veniug :tir acting as a prism. At important stations in the main triangulation a topographical sunJey has been made so as to embrace an area of about 4 sq tiare miles arouncl the station. I 11 tliis survey tbe conto!lrs are drawn in for eYery 10 or 20 feet of vertical height. All the foregoing operations are canietl on simnltaueously, and the observations of horizontal directio11R goveru the time of the oceupation of each station. The period of observation reaches 60 days when the stations are numerous and the distances great, and the principal drawback to progress is the very smoky atmrn;phere of summer in the Great Valley of California. ThiH smoky atmosphe1·e rises to an elevation of 8 000 feet (2 410 metres); antl as the coast mountai11s reach from 3 !JOO to 7 000 feet (1190 to 2 140 metres), the smoke necessarily lies in the line of sight. Tlte personnel of a party.-Tb.e largest number of persons at one of the Sierra Nevada stations when the party had to go through deep snow, ancl oorne out through deei> and extensive snows, was as follows: Chief of party and three assistants, one packer, one cook, aml five men. Six or eight pack animals. Hired wagons for general trausportntion wl1ere roads exist.

725

At ea.ch distant station which is observed upon there is one beliotroper, who cooks t0.: himself. .At some very difficult stations there are two beliotroper.-; who relieve each other. A system of heliotrope signals is used to signify to the heliotroper the character of his work, when to f~hange his direction to another station or for any of the usual movements of the party. At the Rouncl Top station of 1879 the party experienced a. temperature below zero of Fallrenheit; wind that blew 100 mile's (or 160 kilometres) per hour, and deep snows. When the observations were finished the party came ont through snow drifts 2! feet (over 7 metres) deep; and the general depth was 6 feet or 2 metres for many miles. All the instruments and material hafl to be carried into and from this station for the last 800 feet (250 metres) of elevation. In the occupation of Mount Conness in the Sierra Nevada next spring, my party will be forced through tlie snows of the Yosemite Valley, or possibly re~ich the station through the State of Nevada from the eastward. 'J'be heig-ht of this station is 13,000 feet, 4,000 metres. Local deflection of the pliunb line.-In these operations of the triangulation the observations of the latitude and azimuth have exhibitell great irregularities in tile local deflection of the plumll line at the various stations. In the meridian the range of defiection from the mean which llas been adopted amounts to nearly seven seconds of arc plns and minus, and in the prime Tertical to nearly the same amount. This has led to the adoption of provisionally standard geodetic data for a given station and for a given line; that is, a certain station has assigned to it a, given latitude aml longitude, wliich is very closely the meaus of all the stations reduced tliereto, and the azimuth from that station to another given station is adopted as tlie true azimuth thereof. The direction of these deflections of tlie plumb line can sometimes be predictml from surrounding geological and orographical comlitions, but in ~mme cases, as on the Plains of Los Angeles, large deflection was found where none ha<l been anticipated. In this connection I may say that the Superintendent has directed me to present to the Association twenty or more pbotographR which exhibit some of the physical features of the trigonometrical stations which have been occupied in the line of the Sierra Nevada by the party under my direction. Besides this they giv~ proof of the frequent clearness of the atmosphere in showing sharply mountain outlines that were at least sixty miles (96 kilometres) distant. One of these exhibits a summer view of the Yosemite Valley through which the triangulation party will pass to Mount Conness.

I shall enumerate these very briefly. 1. The Nantucket arc of the mm·idian: 3*0 have been finished, and it will be extended to 60. It lies between 41 o 15' and 470 30'. 2. The Pamplico-Chesapeake arc of the meridian: 4p ha ye been finished, and it will be extended to ll!o between the latitudes 350 and 46~o. 3. The Lake Superior and Gulf of Jfe;i:ico arc of the nie»idian: 10° 121 of this arc were executed before 1878 by the Corps of United States Engineers, and it will be extendecl by the Coast and Geodetic Survey to the Gulf of Mexico, making a total length of 1so 35' between the latitudes 300 10' and 430 45'. 4. 'l'he Pac(tie arc of the mer-idian. The triangulation has been exec11tetl from about latitude 39° to latitude 34P, and it will be extended through California, Oregon, and Washington to the boundary between the United States and Bl'itish Columbia in latitnd<>. 400; makiug a total of 150 within tlie limits of the United States. Northward 0f the United States it ca11 be carried through British North America to the Arctic Ocean. Within the limits of the U nitetl States this main triangulation is carried on between the Sierra Nevada or the <Jascade Mountains on the east, and the Coast Range on the west, and in rnlves lines of great lengtli. The longest line yet observed bas been 192 miles or 307 kilometres; and the long. est .reconnoitred is 244 miles or 390 kilometres. This great scheme was inauguratrnl to check and control tile immediate triangulation of the coast that had much shorter sides, and was much im· peded by the peculiarities of the rocky or forest-covered coast raoges which lie very close and par· allel to each other.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY .

.A.a early as 1859 I made some observations upon the Sierra Nevada from the station Mount Tama Ipais in the western most of the coast ranges. The distance was about 165 miles or 260 kilometres, and as I was already familiar with the relation of the coast range& with the Cascade Iia.nge and the Sierra Xe\·ada, I foresaw the development of a great scheme of triangulation to the north and south between these mountain ranges, with extraordinarily favorable opportunities for measurillg base lines of almost any desired length in the nearly level illaius of the Great Yalley of Oaliforuia. Since then this scheme of triangulation has been carried out, and that of the transcontinental arc of the parallel inclndes and starts uearly from this Tamalpais 8tati011. 5. The Oblique Arc oJ the Atlantic Coast has been executed for a length of 17° '.H', anrl will be continued southwestward to the shore of the Gulf of l\iexico, and northeastward to Oape Breton in the Dominion of Canada. The total length will be 20~0, equal to 1 202 miles or 1 !J20 kilometres, and that small part to the northeast of l\Iaine will necessarily be executed by Canada. G. ..A nmnber of sub arcs have been executed on different parts of our coasts. There-are 19 of these, and they have au average length of 138 miles or 224 kilometres. 7. The Great Central Arc of Longitude on the parallel nf39°. It extends from Point Arena on the coast of California t-0 Cape May on the Atlantic coast, and ha1:1 a total leugt.11 of 48lf 0 lougitutJ.c, equal to 2 628 statute miles or 4 230 kilometres. Thirty-foLU' degrees of this arc have been executed in four sections. I h~we already stated t.hat this great transcontinental arc was projected to connect the scheme of tlie triangnlatiou on the Atlantic a.nd Pacific coasts. Along this line the telegraphic longitude observations arc nearly completed, the geodetic levelings have progressNl from tlte Atlantic to beyond ti.Jo Missouri River~ rrnd the gravity determinations will be made systematical!J· from ocean to ocean. I need say little about the character of the triangulation upon this parallel. In some parts of the country it iis made with difficulty on account of the heavy forests and the absence of prominent heights. There, aud in other parts, the lines are necessaril.v shorter than is desirable, but Lase liues will be more numerous, and a..<1tronomical observations will be frequently repeated. From the eastern line of the Ifocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean the size of the triangles, qnatlrilatera1s, and pentagons is snfficiently large for the highest character of work. As a general rule the atmospheric contlitions are fa>orablc, bnt the difficulties to l>e o>ercome in such an arid regiou, very sparsely populated, are extreme. It requires the utmost devotion and exertion to carry forward the work, and especially when a part;\' is caught at a station from 10 000 to 13 000 feet elevation (3 050 to 3 urn:; metres) in the cold weather of the early winter. The Association ca11 learn the character of the work near the western extremity of this arc from the pul>lished accounts of the measnrement of the Yolo base line and the treatment of the geomet· rical figures comprising "the Davidson quadrilaterals." As observers we are sath;fied that we ha Ye gone beyond the llest efforts of the instrument rn~kers, and we now demand a higher class of instruments of precision-especially theodolites arul base apparatus. 8. Tbe secondary arc of the parallel of 428. This arc was commenced by the Corps of United States Engineers, who executed nearly one half of it, and since 1878 it has been extended l>y the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. It stretches from Cape Cod, in longitude 700 to longitude 88°, near Chicago, and is 17p in length; equal to 500 miles, or 800 kilometres. Al.lout twothirds of the arc has been finished. fl. I'n~jccred arc of the 11ieridian. This great Central jlrc of Latitude extends from Urn southern bourn.lary of British Columbia, in latitude 49°, to the boundary with Mexico, on the Rio Gmude, in Jatitn<lf~ :26°, through 230 oflatitude. Its length within the territory of the United States is there· :(ore 1 600 miles, or 2 560 kilometres. But it cau he extendell southward through :M:exieo to Point Sacrificios ou the Pacific coast, in latitude 100; and northward through British Columbia to the Arctic Oeean. It is projected, near the meridians of 9go and 990 west. 10. It is 111·oposed that tuio great Transcontin-ental Arcs of the Pamllel be hereafter measnred, principally within the limits of the Unite!l States. The northern one will extend through Goo of longitude, from Cape Disappointment, at the mouth of the Uolnrnbia l~iver, in latitmle 46010' and longitude 1240, eastward to the Great Lakes, and tbence tbrongh the Dominion of Canada to Cape Breton. This arc will cross the Pacific Ooast arc of the meridian in longitude 120io; the Great Central a.re of longitude in 990 or 930; the Lake Superior and

Its length will oo abont 2 850 statnte miles, or 4 :;so kilometres. 11. The second proposell Transcontinental Arc of the Pa,r<illel will extend through ;;:-;no of 1011gitude, from the southern extremity of the Island of San Ol~mente, on the Pacific coa"t, in latitude 330 401 antl longitude 118io, wholly through tlie territory of tlle United State:-; to tlw vicinity of Charleston, on the Atlantic coast, in longitude 'i9TI 0 west.

On the Pat~ific coast. the first etlition of my Coa1'.t, Pilot of California, Oregon, and vVashington ·was published when the Aurve.rs of the whole coast had been in operation but seven years. Necessarily a different type of description was adopte1l, that dealt largely in generalities, which were fortified so far as riracticahle with details of special localities. During the last fort.y years these generalities haYe largely given place to details, and the fonrth e11it.iou of this Coast Pilot, with many illustrations, brings to <late tbe data and the experi· encPA of that period.

Y.-THE MANNER OF MEASURING THE BASE LINES 01" THE THIANGULATION" AND THE SPECIAL

DIFFICULTIES TO m-; OVERCOME IN A NEW COl,'NTRY.

Tbe first base line for the U.S. Ooast Survey was measured by Ferdinaml R. Ho.ssler, who was the first Superiutendent of the Coast Survey. Ile used four 2-metre steel bars placed in line, and this he designated as one, using two microscopes to mark the ends of each measure of this quadruple system.

728

UNITED STA.TES GOA.ST A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The next apparatus was a compensation apparatus of steel and brass, devised by Superin· tenucnt Bache wuo trned the Be!:!sel lever of contact in the measures. With this apparatus the base lines on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, except the first base line, were measured, and were generally 5 or 6 miles long (8 or 10 kilometres). On the Pacific coast when transportation was very difficult and costly, the prices of labor excessively great, and the demamls for immediate practical results, imperative, local base lines of 2 to 6 miles in length (3 to 10 kilometres) were measured with secondary apparatus of various characters. After the schemes of triangulation had largely de,·elopcd, and the transcontinental arc of the parallel had been commenced, the present apparatus of Assistant Schott (composed of steel and zinc bars, very nearly compensated aud using the slide contact) was sent to the Pacific coast in 1881 for the measurement of the Yolo uase line of 17 486 metres. I had chosen the location of this line because it was one side of the first quadrilateral leading through three quadrilaterals to the line 1\Iouut Diablo-Mount Helena in the Coast Range; whence a.notber quadrilateral stretchell across th~ Great Valley of California to the Sierra Nevada with lines from 117 miles to 142 miles (189 to 229 kilometres) in length. The base line passed over several water courses nearly at right angles; tbrough ploughed tields and across country roads. It should be particularly borne in mind that, while the Sur my 1·ecei ves the snpport of all tho State Governments, it can not enter any man's property without his conscut, so that we are thrown >ery much upon the good will of the proprietors and the tenants of tho lauds crossed. It is tberefore a consideration to disturb as little as possible the actual snrface of the ground. Y\'c can only put a temporary gate in the fence surrounding any property by consent of the owner, and by paying for any damages incurred. Moreover the expense of properly grading so long a line would be excessive in a. country where wages are exceedingly high. Therefore in measuring these bases all these matters must largely govern the choice and decision of the officer in charge of the selection and measurement. In the Yolo baseline I decided to do no grading except in one or two places where the surfac{'I presented some abrupt change. From what I have read of the descriptions of the base lines in Europe, the conditions of the surface are wholly distinct. On the Yolo base line there was one place where the surface of the "adobe" (a tough clay soil) was so deeply and genemlly cracked by shrinkage that it reqnirell some judgment to properly place the plates for the tripods to rest upon. It bappened on this line that there was no grade to exceed five degrees, ancl the largest inclination was near the northwest end. In the measurement of the Los Angeles base tilere were greater surface difficulties to be over. come. For more than one-half the distance the land was in its natural condition; it bad 1iever been ploughed, and bad innumerable irregularities. It was covered with large tussocks of stiff grasses which were the only obstructions removed; it was cut across by several deep sloughs, and it crossed t.wo railroads diagonally. Only in four or fl ve places was the spade used to cut through a sand hillock or a clayey mound, to fill in a water way or to lessen the abrupt change to another water way. We prepared it at the beginning of tlle raiuy season, and when the first measurement was being made we were compelled to stop operations on account of hmLvy rains; when the weather cleared we found the apparatns bogge<l in a broad shallow basin of clayey soil. These :rnd other practical ditiiculties were sometimes almost disheartening, and they, together with the character of the apparatus, decided me to measure tlie bases not less than twice, and three times if the appropriations would permit. Tue rna11uer of measuring the base is simple and may be exemplified by a condensed record of a day's work. Early in the morning th~ two field bars msed in the measurement are compa.rcd witil the " fielll standard bar ' 1 ; tl.J.e adjustments of the sectors an(l of the aligning telescopes are examined. The first bar is lllaced in line aud the after end adjusted over the base mark or the mark of tl1e previous day. The second bar is brought into line and. the after end is 1aised or lowered to the height of the forward end of the back bar; the Borda scales and the thermometers and the sector are read after the bar and tripods have been slightly tapped to relieve any undue

strain in the supports; contact is made under slight magnifying iiower and tbd after bar with· drawn and carried forward. The measures proceed under a. movable canvas cover carried by a framework mounte<l on four wheels; this cover is 51 feet long, and the officers and the men who carry tlrn bars, and tlwse who handle the foot plates and the tripo!ls are the only ones admitted within this cover which four men move forward. In crossing water courses the bars are carried on a central wooden structure :firmly built in the line and wholly distinct from tbe footways upon which the wlieels of the movable cover run, and upon which the men handle the apparatus. At certain times during the day, before and after crossing the railroads or especially difficult places, at the half kilometre stones and at evening, the end of the forward bar is translerred l)y a transit sector to a proper mark fixed in a heavy piece of stone sunk to the surface of the ground. The apparatus is under charge of a watchman at night. The tripods supporting each bar are strong wooden oues shod with heavy brass points, and weigh 35 pounds each; the iron plates UllOil which they rest, and whicb are well fixed on the sur· face of the ground, weigh a little over 9 pournls. Each bar with its beam and covering weighs 162 pounds and. is handled by two men. After all the men become familiar with the modus operandi, there arises among them an ambition not only to make no mistakes, but to execute the measures as rapidly as practicable. This spirit is fostered not only for the economy involved, but because I believe it is best to allow the bar to remain upon such supports through the least possible time. The whole line of the Yolo base ww1 subdivided by kilometre stations marked on copp6r bolts in heavy granite blocks sunk below the surface of the ground, aud also by similar marks placed nuder all the fences which were encountered. The Los Augeles base line was subdivided by half kilometre stations marked as in the Yolo base. On both base lines each measurement was referred to all the kilometres, fence, and half kilometre stations. I need not mention the rapidity with which the Los Angeles and Yolo base lines were measured, because I believe the Association has received from the Superintendent of the Survey a preliminary report on the subject. The nnm ber of officers employed in the actnal m~asarement wa.s three; the number of employes, excluding the watchman and extra driver, but including the four men, moving the movable cover, was eleven. I would, however, ask your patience still longer while making a few remarks upon the pre· cautions I have taken to get the best possible results from this apparatus, and to express an opinion upon some other form of bar. Ha"\"ing had serious doubts about the use of two metals, such as steel and zinc, as a Borda thermometer, and although the apparatus was furnished with very se1rnitive thermometers, I was induced from my experience in the Yolo l>ase measuremeut to incase the outside wooden case a!Hl jron beam of the Standard field bar with blankets, boiler felting·, mul canvas, to the thickness of about three quarters of an incl1, say 2 centimetres. In the measurement of the Los Au~eles base line the measuring bars were similarly incased; and the result has been that the change of temperature through the additional covering has been very slow. Sometimes the change of the tem11eratnre of the outside atmosphere has not exhibited itself in the tht~rmometer for 21 hours. 'Vith this experience I believe in thoroughly incasing the base bar in ~· non condncting material, and in performing all the operations of comparison and measurement at such times and under such cover as I have nsed. I would use a i;ingle hollow metal bar of steel or platinum wit11 sensitive thermometers placed as experiment directed; or, perhaps still better, I would ham this hollow metal bar filled with mercury with proper appliances that should indicate tbe mean temperature of the bar. Difficulties present themselves to the practical application of this idea, but it js possible they may be overcome. I ~hould determine by preliminary experiment wlte01er to use two bars with the slide contact and moderate magnifying power, or one bar with the traces and the necessary microscopes. If one bar and the microscopes proved satisfactory, I should then propose to the Superintendent of the Bnrvey to :11ermit me to measure a short base line of about 1 000 metres twice with the apparatus of the Yolo and Los .Angeles base lines, and twice with the single uar and micro·

scopes, using a line wl1ere tbe surface features of tbe ground would be nearly like what we have already worked over and may expect to work over. By such com1iaratfre t<>sts a fair criterion wonlll be aff'ordetl of tlie relative value of the two systems in accuracy and cost. These are 80me of tlrn suggestions which my experience has forced upon me, for in my judgment we b;cn·c not ,Yet reached the best apparatus nor the best method. I would like to mention here that in selecting the location of the J._.os Angeles !Jase line I prescribed that it should he oue side ofa quadrilateral lying to the southwest, aml of another quadrilateral lying to the sontheast, aud that all the stations of those two tignres should be intervisible. Suell are the conditiom; which uow surround this base li11e; aud I am very sorry tlrnt I bl'Ought no traciug of the schenw to exhibit to the Association, but I will have a drawing made ancl forwarded to tlw perrnaneHt secretary, Dr. Ilirsch.

In this series the lowest station is abont 100 feet, or 3:) metres, above the level of the sea, and the highest station is 10 GOO feet, or 3 230 metres. The observations comprise the me<1snre of simultaneous aml reciprocal zenith distances every hour, for as many as twehre days and nights on the l\Iount Diablo-Martinez Jine; observations of the barometer; obsern1tions of the temperature of boiling water; aml spirit leveliugs repeated.

The practical value of the deductions in these iuYestigations is seen in the numerous :md importaut calls made for the Yari<ttiou of the nmguetic needle at giYen epochs when the early surveys of the country were made almost wholl;".. by comp<tS3 courses a111l distances. Except where special ex.pedit.ions have been fitted out, the magnetic obsen..ations are made by the triaugtllation parties during the occupation of a station, and ne,·er interfere with or prolong the regular work. In the transportation of a parby for long distances, as in the earlier geographical expeditious to Alaska, and in the present mo\"erneut of the parties to the Yukon and Porcu11ine Rivers, acl\'antage is taken of every stop1>age to obtain magnetic as Wf'll as astronomical obse~n1tions. Two magnetic ohsen'atories have been m:1intaiuecl by the Snrn·y where the rc('ords of tire different instruments are made by photography.

XIl.-·THE HYDROGRAPHIC WORK OX Tfrn
SEABOARD~

AND THE DEEP-SEA INVESTIGATlO:'\S.

For the use of the navigator, the depths of the water along the coa,st. :ire usuall:r· carrie1l to moderately deep soundiugs. The <listances from shore are i11en·.ase1l as the immediate demands of close shore work arc filled. 'l'he Atlantic arHl Gulf seacoast cleptlrn differ wlwll,y from those along the Pacific coast at the same distances. A broad snbwa.rine plateau exists off tlw ea.stern coast; on the Pacific const there is no such plateau. The depths reach 2 000 fathoms in a dis· tance of fifty or sixts miles off the California coast, aucl the·. coast monnta.ins attain au eleYation of 5 000 feet within less than three miles of t,lw sea. On the Atlantic and Gnlf' :-;:·aboanls tl1c hydrogeaphic work is well aclvrurned, and more attention is permitted to tile iuvestig-atioa of c1U"rents and tbc study of bar formations. As far back as 184G the Superintendent of the Survey instituted investigations in the off, shore waters of the Atlantic seaboard, in order to embrace the whole of tho conrsP of the Gnlf Stl.'eam. The work has been continuously carried on, aud has led to the examination and study of the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The methods and meaus of deep-sea in>estigation have l>een thel'eby thoroughly developed by the officers of tho Uuite<l States ~avy who execute this work nuder the direction of the Sut>erintendent. The breadth, velocit.r, and direction of tho cuneuts of the Gulf Stream and the temperature of the water are determined for the surfaee and for differ· ent depths; they are also measured for different times of the year aud for different years. The

732

UNITED STATES COAST .A.ND GEODETIC SURVEY.

temperature and movement of the adjacent colder waters are determined with equal care. In connection with these practical problems the Survey has materially aided the investigation and study of the deep sea flora and fauna, as shown in the earlier work of the elder Agassiz and of Pourtales: and in the later work of Alexander Agassiz detailed in his "Three Cruises of the Blake." Ou the Pacific coast the hydrographic surveys have developed some curious features along the seaboard. To this d:otte no Jess than eleven submarine valleys of great depth, narrow, with very steeply inclincil sides h1wc been discovered, heading directly and. very close in to the shore. In snme instances these submarine valleys head directly upon the low sandy shores, as off Point Hueneme in the Santa Barbara Cliarmel, off Monterey Ilay and other locations. In other instances they head directly on the shore under hold mountains that reach as much as 4 256 feet (1 300 metres) eleYation within a few mi1es. Tl1ese !atter examples are principally under the coast rauge near Cape Mendocino, ab~mt latitude 4.0°. These curious features have a practical importance as affecting tlrn current im1rn1diately u1Hler the shores; they may affect the position of the vessel, and their great depths may mislea<l the navigator who approaches the coast in foggy weather and depends upon llis dead 1·eckoning and soundings. 'l'hey lta\·e another value to the geologist as affording data in the study of the rise and sullside11ce of the coast; and to the naturalist in the distribution of the fauna along the immediate seaboard. The investigation and study of littoral currents, and of the currents at the mouths of rivers and the entrances of bays and harbors, bas occupied the continued attention of the Survey not only fo:i: the purpmies of the navigator, but to suggest improvemeuts in channels and the best form and location of jetties and breakwaters.
XIII.-TIDAL STATIONS; SELF-REGISTERING TJDE GAUGES.

I ltave already mentioned that lung series of tidal o\}servatious have been continued at impor· tant locations oa the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Ou the Pacific coast these self.registering tide gauges have been in operation for abont 36 years. At Sau Diego on the south and at Astoria on the north, obser,·atious were contiuueu without any important break for more than 20 ~-ears; at Port Townsend and at St. Paul, Kadiak Island, Alaska, for shorter periods. At the Golden Gate of San Francisco the self-registering gauge has been recording the tides for about 35 .)'ears, and the station is still maintained. The transcontinental line of levelings will be referred to the bench-marks of this gauge. Besides these gauges the Survey has at different times established serf-registering gauges at Mazatlan, under the dircctiou of a Mexican t11giueer officer, and at Cape San Lucas, the southern poiut of Lower California. Betwt:en these principal stations numerous Aecondary stations have been establishe(1; where obserTations hrffe been carried on through two or more lunations. F1·0111 the discussio11 of the 01Jspr1'atiuns at tl10 primary or continuous stations the prediction of tl10 titles is practicable, a.u1l tables are uow published annually giving the times and heights of ev<'r,v high alHl low water thronghont tlie sear for the principal ports, with constants to apply thereto for obtaining the times and heights at all intermediate ports. One of the incidental records upon the self-registering gauges is that of the earthquake waves whieh reach the shores of the Pacific coast from great earthquakes in rlistant parts of the world; such as that at Krakatoa, when the Sau Francisco record showed some profound disturbance long before the locality or the cvcut was otherwise known.
XIV.-ALASKA.

'rhe shore line of the coast of Alaska, including the islands and the great sounds, amounts to not less than 26 000 statute miles, or n 600 kilometres. 'J'lie first explorations by the Coast and Geodetic Surrny were made by my parties in 1867 and 1869, and a Coast Pilot was published in the latter year. ·within the laRt ten yea.rs Congress has made appropriations for the survey of those interior channels of the Archipelago Alexander, which are traversed by the United States mail steamers and other vessels. The shores are rocky, high, very forbidding, and covered with a dense forest of large trees to the water's edge. There is no plain in this Archipelago, although

it has mainland and island shore lines amounting to nearly 8 000 miles, or 12 800 kilometres. There is no opportunity whatever for a base line so far as very extensive examinations have been made. And yet, novel devices have been adopted, so that a preliminary triangulation and smTey of the shores is being executed as a basis for the necessary hydrograpllic sur>eys. Ew·ry year a Oonst Survey steam Yessel, under the command of naval officers attached to the Surnly, has been imshing the surveys with Yigor to answer the pressing demands of commerce. 'l'he longitudes ha>e been determined by differences from Port Townsend, "\Vashington, and from the primary station of 1867 and 1869 at Sitka. I.atitude observations are made with tile Davidson mf>ridian instTument by the Talcott method. ~fost of the channels are extremely deep, the currents are stJ·ong, and the unseen dangers to nav-igation v-ery numerous. Seasons of gootl weather are uncommon, and, therefore, astronomical observations are difficult. With further appropriations from Congress, it is expected that preliminary surveys will be canied up the river courses to egtahlish points on the houndary line between southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. These surveys and explorations may probably develop the feasibility of measuring some base line, whence a triangulation can be carried amoug the high peaks of the almost inuumeraule islands, and thence through the different channels. I recall no country where the peculiarities of tbe high islamls densely wooded, and the deep channels with rocky sbores, and the wet and r~lmuly 1>,limate, conspire so completel,v to rntard geodetic progress. This concludes tile summary which I have written since the Conference of October 2, and I :;hall now present briefly the suggestions which the 8nperintendcnt has made in his instructions: (1) The Superintendent directs me to call atte11tio11 to tlw a.drh;ability of a remeasw·ement of the Penwia.11. arc. There are probably not two opinions concerning the weakness of this arc, on account of its peculiar location and the fewness of the astronomical determinations. W c helie>e the arc should be remeasured with all the resources and skill of tbe present day, and that Frauce should. within a re:isonable period, undertake this dut.y. I understand that at tlie coming meeting of the Delegates from the American States, at Washington, tbe subject.matte.r of the remeasurement of this base, or the measurement of another base nearer the level of the sea, and not so surrounded by great mountains, will be brought to the consideration of the Delegates. Information will then be solicited about the prallticability of measurinb a new arc of 50 or 60 iu length near the equator in British Guiana. It is, perhaps, premature to say what country or countries should measure this arc if it be practicable. (2) The Superintendent instructs me to express the view of the Coast and Geodetic Sur\°'ey as adverse to the 1tse of Perro for the initial longitude of sume of the map.~ in the repoi·ts of the Associatio11, because it can hawi no real scientific weight. Ile hopes that. the adoption of tlie prime meridian will be in accordance with the decision of the Tnterna.tional Conference at Washington. The Coast and Geodetic Survey has no partisan feeling in this matter whatever, and is simply nnticipating by a few years what will very probably become universal :.it the enll of the century.

It iR the puqiose of this pape1' to gi\e a history of the new Naiioual Prototypes of the Uetre and Kilogramme recently received by tht> United States, and to preface it with a oriefaccouut of the "Teights and JUeasures in customary use in this country. Tlrn Constitution empowers Congress to "fix the standard of weights and measures," but it will presently lie seen that while Congress has from time to tiuw consitlerell the subject, ir, lias not. deemed it expedient to enact much legislation in regard to it. ~Y:isbington, in his messagt> to the ·First Cmigr·,ss. sai1l : '' rniformity iu the currency, weights, and measnreR of tl1e e1.it<'d States is an ohject of grl'at importalil'e, arnl '"ill, 1 am persuadHl, be duly attended to." Acting upon this s11gl:estion the Honse ·of H('JH'l'Scntati\·es rd'crrcd tbe matter to Jefferson, who was tlieu SecrNars of Statl', for a report, and iu July, 17!W, lie Hnbmitte<l two plans, min of whid1 propost·d to define alld l't>!Hkr nniform the existing Bystem; tho other "to reduce eH1ry branch to tlic decimal ratio already ef<ta1llished for cnin:;, aud thus hriug the calcnL1tiou of the principal affair!' of life within the aiithmetic of c>ery man who call rnnlriply and divide.''

After the war of 1812 tlH' subject was ag;ain takt>n up in compliance with an urgem appeal of Pre~ideut Madison. Tlle Senate, as ht the case of ,J eflernon, rl'i:erred tlw mattPr for n, report to the Secretary of State, ,Tohn QniH(',Y A<laml'I, wlio, aftPr mnch ;;tudy, made his well-kuow11 report, at the c.:mclnsion of whicb he sulnuitted ltis plan, wliidr was: (1) To fix tbe standard with the 11:1rtial uuiformit~· of which it. is ~msceptibll', for tht.· present excluding all innovaticu.

While Cougress was considering this matter, the exeet1tive branch of tlie Government acquired certain standards, among them a platinum kilogramme and metre of tlle same material, procured

to Great .Uritai.u.

From tbe preceding record it appears that the Troy poand of the Mint was adjusted in 1827, with a high degree of accuracy to the British Troy Pouml of 1758, which becaurn the Imperial standard of weight afrer ~fay l, 18:!5. This Imperial standard and tbe stand~ml yard of Great Britain were destroyed by fire in 1834, and IH'W starnlards were constructed about 1844-. Certain copies of the Imperial Troy pound of 1758 were mwd to deri,·e the new Imperial standard of weight, which is an Avoirdupoi" pouud containing 7 OOfl of 1rnch grains, of which the lost starnlard contained 5 760. The llistory of national legislation iu this country in regard to TI"eights and measures may be resumed with tlrn passage of a resolution by the Senate, l\1ay 29, 1830, directiug the SecrPtary of the 'rreasnr;y to cause a comparison to be made of the staudards of weight and measure used at thP principal custom-houses in the United States and to report to the Seuate at its next se8siou. Conformably to this resolution comparii>ons were instituted, and large discrepancies were disclosed in the weights anti measures in use. By virtue of the general powers vested in it, and iu execution of the Constitutional provi,;iou that the duties, imposts, and excises sltall be uniform throughout the United States, tho Treasury Department r1·porteil to Congress, as the outcome of the comparisons, that it had adoptL·d t.lle Trough ton scale as the unit of length and the Troy pound of the Mint as the unit of weight from ·wl1ieh the .A.voirdupois Ponud was to be deriV"ed, so that tlie ratio of its weight. to that of tlie Troy poulld 1:>hould l>c as 7 000 is to 5 760. For liquid measure the \Vine Gallon of 231 cubic inches, and for dry measure the Winchester Busl1d of 2 1J0·42 inches, according- to the stantlanl of the English Yard referred to in the report of the Department of March 3, 11'31. In ,June, 183G, Congress passed tlle following resolution:
That the Secretary of th~ Treasury be and he hereby is directed to ca.use a complete set of all the woights aud measures adopted as standanls, aud uow either made OL' in the progress of manufacture for the use of the several

No other legislation than that cited in the foregoing pages bas been passcrl in reganl to our customar.Y measure:;. Its bearing ou particular representatives of the units of length, weiglit, and capacity can now be recapitulated under the respective headi11gs referring to tl.Jem.
CUS'l'Ol'liA.R¥ LENGTH MEAS"CRE.

There is no difference between the customary unit of length of the United States and of Great Britain. The Treasury Department adopted the ~-anl compri8etl between the twenty· seventh and .'iixtythird-inch divisions of the 'l'roughton Scale as its yanl. This was supposed to be equal to the British ya.rd, bnt had never been direl'tly com1wn·d 1yith it. It was assumeu to J,e standard at 62° F. until indirect comparisons between it and the vrcsent Iru1wrial Standard prO'ved it to be too long by 0·00083 inch at tllat temperature. Comparisons lla ve shown it to be equal to the Imperial. Stamlanl at 59·fio F. It has alrea<ly been stated that the British standard of length was destroyed by fire iu 1834. A new standard, known as the Imperial Yard, '\Vas coustrncted, um1er the direction of the Committee of 1843, liy reference to accredited copies of the one destroyel1. 'Vhen the new Imperial Standard was constructed, about fifty additional copies were made and compared with the former. Two of these copies, known respectively as I,ow ~Toor Iron Su. Di" and Bronze No. 11, were prcsentell to the United States, anll were recei-.ed in 1856. 'l.'lw trnt· length of the Tronghton-scale yard was derived from comparisons with these. No.11 and No. 57 were taken to Euglaud antl again compared directly with rl1t· Imperial Standard between 1876 and 1888, and their relation to the latter is koo"»ll with the lliglL·st degree of accuracy attainable. Hecourse is hall to th est· .' ards "·hene>er great precisiun i8 re11 uired; the Troughton scale being unsuitable for a standard on aecount of its form anu on account of the coarseness of its defining lines.
Ct:STO:;\lARY STANDARD O.F WEIGHT.

The Troy ponnd of the 1\fiut lrnH been declarecl h~- Act of Congress to be tlrn standard according to which the coinage of the United States shall be regulated. The .Avoirdupois pound adopted by the Treasury Department was derived from the ::\lint Troy pound. As the densiticm of these weights are uot known, aml as they are made of brass, a material which oxidizes readily under atmospheric influences, the~~ are not Ruitable for Htandanls of precision. The Troy pound from which our A >oirdupois pound was deri\e<l is a copy of the lost Imperial Standard of 1758, aud since the present Imperial Standard was deri-.ecl from the :rnrne standanl, it may be inferred that there is no difference between the Avoirdupois ponull of tlie Duited States and that of Great Britain. The British Imperial Standard of weight is the Avoirdupois ponud, a platinum mass. standard in vacuo. The British Commercial pound is an ideal pound, lta>ing tho same mass as tlrn Imperial Standard, but of suclL a density that its proper proportional part, ~LZD~, woul,l exactly counterpoise tbe lost Standanl of 1758 iu air of a definite lmoyancy. When the present Imperial Standard was constructed, certain secondary standards of weight were also rnadt·, and one of tbPm, lrno'lln as No. 5, was presented to tlie United States in 1856. Upon its recdJlt comparisons were matle l>etween it and the Treasury Stantlard, which gave au outstanc1i11g difference between the latter and the British commercial iw1md of ouly al10ut one one-thousandth of a grain.
C.A.P A.CITY ME A.SURES.

The capacity measures adopted by tlrn Treasury Department a.re tlrn wine gallon of 231 cubic inches ancl the Winchester busliel of 2150·42 cubic inches, which were lawful standards before the separation of the Colonies from Great Britain.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.

The following is a list of the standards constructed by tliis Office and furnished to tho States. Length: Oue Metre, end measure. One Metre, line measure, divided. Weight: One Kilogramme. One Demi-Kilogramme. Oue Gramme, with subdivisions. One ten Kilogramme. Capacity : One Litre. One D1·calitre.
It will he noticed that, as in the case of the customary standards of length and weight, Con· gwss did not "pecify auy particular material representatives of the l\letre and Kilogramme. The staIHlanb made for distribution were therefore constructed to represent, as closely as could be

detPrminNl at the time~ the length and mass, respecth·e]y, of the legal l\fetre of France, kIJown as the JUtrc des A.rehires, and that of tlrn legal Kilogramme of France, known as the Kflogramme des .-1 rcliii·e.s. · rn 18GG the copies of the legal French standards in use in different countries lliffered among tliermieh·eH, and their relation to their prototypes was not known with a clegree of precision in kct·piug with tl1e requirements of science; and the standards of the Archives themseh·es, made in tht> latter part of the last century, were not constructed ·>ith the degree of perfectiou attainable in rnodt>nt times. These considerations, aml the spread of the metric system, induced the Government of France to invite the GoYernments of tlrn world to sern:l delegates to Pari8 for tbe purpose of formi11g an Int£·rnational Commission, baying for its oqject the construction of a new :\fetre as an International Standard of length. In response to t!tis irffitation Prof.·Toseph Henry arn1 Mr. ,T. E. Hilgard were appointed by the President scientific delegates, without diplomatic functions, to represent the United States. A first meetiug was held at Paris in August, 1870, but, owing to the existing political complications in Europe, little was done until the second meeting, in 1872, when a general plan was ontlined and definite propositions as to the mode of procedure to attain the olJjccts in view were adopt.en. The most important of these propositions were to make the International l\Ietre a line measure, whose length at ()e> C. should he equal to that of the 111Ctre des Archfrcs, and to make the mass of the Kilogramme equal to the mass of the Kilogramme des Arcll'ives in its actual state, and to use for the material of the standards an alloy of platinum iridium containiug 10 per cent. of iridium, with a tolerance of 2 per cent. in excess or deficiency. Tlte cross-section of the metre bars was also decided upon. It is that proposed by M. Tresca, and is that which was ultimately given to the prototypes. It is shown in the accompanying figure.

The shape adopted for the Kilogramme is that of a cylinder, whose height is equal to its diameter, and having slightly rounded edges. On l\Ia;r 20, 11:175, a metric convention was signed at Paris by the representatives of seventeen GoYernrnents, among them that of tbe Uniteu States, for the purpose of establishing and maintaining, at the common expense, a scientific and permanent International Bureau of \Veight:< and Measures near Paris. By this treaty, the operations of the International Bureau are put tmdcrthe exclusin_~ dire.ction and supervision of an International Uommittee, which latter is umler the control of a Oeneral Conference composed of delegates from all the contracting governments. According to "Article fl'' of the convention, the International Bnrean of Wt.ight1:1 and Measures is charged with(1) All comparisons and verifications of the new prototypes of the metre and kilogramme. (2) The custody of the International Prototypes.

(3) The periodical comparison of the National Standards with the Internatim1al Protot;n>es and with their test copies, as well as the comparison of Standard thermomett>l'"· (4) The comparison of tlrn prototypes with tlrn fumlamental l'!tandards {1f 11011-metrical weights and measures USl'd iu different countries for scientific purpose.s. (5) The Htamlanlizing of aud comparison of geodetic measnl'ing liars. (6) The comparison of standards aud scales of precision, the verification of which may be reque.Hted by Gon~ruments or scientific societies, or e\·ea by coustructon; or men of scieucc. On the basis of this convention the International Burean wa~ organized antl established in the Pavillon de Breteuil, iu ShT(~S, Hear rariti. Before its establishment, howei·er, the International Commission began its J:1hors by making }lfe1imiuary studies of the questions iuYcln~d, aud ttrn Committee cl1argeri with the crm~tn<.c:tion of the prototypes prC'parerl an ingot weiglliHg _;G(· kilogramnw:.; of platiuum il'it1ium, kuown as tlw alloy of 187 4. This did not meet tlle rl;quirements established by the Uommis;.;iun iii'. to tliP p::rir7 of material, nevertheless sen~ral ha rs ·were p1'eparetl of this allo,y and one of them i.~ in the po3se:;;sion of this Government. The bars malle of this alloy, however, form a sepal'ate group from the> International and National Prototypes, the constrnction of which will uow bo briefly de::;,TibL·d: The alloy wa;i pr"pared by Messr;s, .Johnson, :\Iatliey & Co., of Lorn1on, in tile following· ILianuer: Finely powdereu platinum :.iud iridium wen· weighed in tbe prc.seribecl proportions aud wero thorongllly mixed ia qnautities of 10 kilogrammes at a time. Eacll of these quantities was compressed into a cake and heated. to n'd bent iu a cm·ered platinum crucible. Each cake was then put in a furnace of pure lime aud nrnlt~r1 in an oxyhydrogen flilme; the alloy was then f)OU!:'t~tl into molds also ma<1e of pure lime. 'rhe ingots thus obtained were eleaued witli dilute bydrochloric acicl and washed in distilled boiling water. They were then put into a muffle fhruace. The interior of tlie muffle was lined with thick sheets of platinum and was heated with the i·apor of one of the heavier h,ydrocarhon oils (!wile lourde), burning in compn·ssed air, according to the method of Sainte-Clair Deville. The heat thus obtained was cont-:tant, and the interior of the muffle waR freed from dnst and const:quentl.v from iron. The ingots, having been firnt heatetl to the temperature. of melting gold, were forged under a powerful trip hammer, and after ead1 forg-ing the hammer and anYil of polished steel were carefully cleaned with leather ancl pov.dert·<l li:ne. The metal was then passed lletweea oil<'<l and polislled steel cylinders so as to reduce it. to plates ahont ~ millinwtres thick. Eaeli plate was cut into three parts, which were cleaned in a solntio11 of boiling caustic soda and treated with dilute hydrncbloric acid. :N'otwithstanlling all tlw precautions taken during the forging, the plates wern discolored by oxide of iron. To remon~ this they were kept in coutact during five hours with potassium liisulphate in a state of fusion in a, m·er'ed platinum n~ssel. Specimens of each plate were sent to Paris and Brussels for analysis. From the begHL1dJ).; it was require<l that the alloy o;honM be remelted three times in order that it should beco1m~ per· fedly homogeneous, The chemists of the International Committee and of tbe French f:S<·ction baviug found tlie metal satisfactory after the second casting, the thir<l casting was made on :'.\lay 26, 1884-, with perfect success in a large fomace of purt1 lime containing the whole mass (65 kilo.

grammes).
'.fhe metlll thus obtained was heated with oxyhytlrogen gas in a furnace specially constructed for this purpose of blocks of lime. 'Yheu the surface bcgau to melt, it was remon·ti and put under a trip hammer and forged i11to ~ rectaugnl;n bar 5~ centimetres long, 7 centimetres thick. Tlds bar was in turn heated in a 1\lllfilc lined with pure platinum with vapor of·' hnile lonrde," into which air had been forced. It was then rolled between steel csliudern which transfonne1l it into a c.rliu<lrical liar 200 centimetres long- aud 4-! millimetres i11 diameter. .A.t tllis sta.ge iww specimens were taken from the bar and aual_ysed. The analyses fihowed it to be free from ruthPnium arnl from iri<linm in a free state, that the rhodium present was well within the limits of tlie pre· scribe1l tolerance, and that the proportion of iron present was less than Tufi·!i-ifini· The bar was then cnt illto40 cylinders, and each one being inclosed in a collar was then snbjected twelve times to a pressure of 360 tons. They were then sent to Paris, · Tbe metal for the metre bars was prepared in about the same way. After two meltings 1 the mass was divided into five lots. These having been examined and found pure and homogeneous

were each divided into three parts. Tl.Jese were then arranged in groups made up from each of the 1he Jots, melted together and cast into ingots each of which contained sufficient material for one standard. Tbe bars after having been forged were passc>d between rollers. until they assumed approximately the shape desired. They were then put upon a specially de\·ised planing machine which gave them their final sliape. The work of straightening the bars, making the edges sl.Jarp and the neutral snrface plane, as well as cutting the bars to the required length, was iutrnsted to Messrs. Brunner Brothers, in Paris, who finished tlieir part of the work in 1886 and 1887. · The defining lines were then trnced ou the bars at the Uonservatoirn des Arts et :\Ieti(irs. Small surfaces near each end of the bar were highly polished and on tilese tile lines wem ruled. Three lines uearly 0·5 miliiruetre apart are traced near each end, tile distance between the middle lines of each group being the lines which define the metrP.
COEF:PlCIEN'.f 01<' l!:XPANSION OF TH1: .ME'l'RE EARS.

The necessity of adopting a thermometric scale presented itself at the outset to the International Committee, and very elaborate and so.ceessfu1 thermometrie studies were made, as tlrn result of which the indications of mercurial glass thermometers can be made strictly comparable. Jn October, 1887, the International Commission adopted a statHlard centigrm1e tliermometric scale based 011 the expausion of hydrogen uuder certain detiuite condition:.:. General formnlm were developed for reducing tLe iu(lications of mereurial thermometers ma<le of certain kiu<ls of glass to this standard scalP. The coefficieut of expansion of the Of1TS was determined relatively to the coeft1eient of one har whose expansion had been determined by absolute measurement of its incn·ase in Ieugth, with increasing temperatures. Tile coefficieut thus determined was >erified by determin· ing the expansion of small sections of the metal cut from the ends of the bar when it was being reduced to its standard length. This method is based on the measurement of the displacement of interference fringes of light, produced between two plane surfaceR by their cliffierential expansions. The coefficients of the several bars were found to be nearly iclentical. The bar!' were also examined for the purpose of determining their coefficient of elasticity, and
this was founcl equal to about 19700 _Kg2 mm
The thirty.om· prototype bars n-ere then all comparc>cl with each other aml with an auxiliary bar whmm length in terms of the J'lfotrP des Archives had been cn.refully determined. After tlie comparison had been made, one !Jar, ti1e length of wbicb at O:> C was found equal to that of tlrn 1\Ietre des Archives, was selected for the International Prototype. The othm· bars beiug intended for distribution to the various Governments are called National Proto· types, and their rc1atioe to the Interuationa1 Prototype is known with the highest degree of accuracy attaiuable. 'I'he degree of accuracy may be inferred from the estimate placed upon it by the International Committee. The probable error of cornparisou of the National Prototypes with the International M~·trc was found from the observation to be ± 0·04 µ,whereµ stands for micron, or the one-millionth part of a metre. Taking into account tbe uncertainties in the coefficient of expansion and otiler sources of error, it is estimated that the probable uncertainty in the lengths at temperatures between 200 and 250 centigrade lies between ±: 0·1 p anll ±: 0·2 µ. 'l'hc sncceRs with which the pl a us for the construction of the prototype metres were carried out is stated by the International Committee, in general terms, to have Leen such that among the new prototypes three or four hitd so nearly the true length of the metre that it was almost a matter of imlifierence which of these should be selected as the International Prototype. Exactly one-half of the prototypes were longer, the other half shorter, than this length, and the mean length of all is found to be exactly equal to the length striven for. Tlie difference on one side or the other from this mean length was rarely as large as one-half of the prescribed tolerance of error, and jn most cases it fell considerably below. .

CONS'l'RUCTION OF THE KILOGRAM::\IES.

745

The metholl by wbicb the metal was prepared has already been described. The densities of the several Kilogrammes were careful1y <leterminell by b:ydrostatic ·weighings. After tbey bad been intercompared tlie;r were compared with tbe International Pmtotype, the weighings being made on a 1ml:rnce constructl:'d for comparison!'! in vacuo, but the weighings were made in air, because it conlcl be done with much greater ease, and because the densities of the Kilogrammes were so nearly alike that the minute correction for buo.rancy of air could be applied without sensible CrI'or. The ualance was so constructed that the necessary manipulation could, by certain mechanical appliances, be made by the obsen·er at a distance of about 4 metres from the balance. One of the Kilogrammes witb which all the others were compared has become the Iutermitioual Kilogramme, antl it i:<i prese1Ted at the Interm1tional Bureau togetlrnr with the Prototype ~~ . The accuracy of the comparisons was sucb that the relation of any one of these Kilogrammes to the International Prototype was determined to within less than the one-lmndr(~cltli part of a milligramme. When the construction of the metric prototypei; had been completed, a General Conference was convened. in Paris in September, 188!), and by it the labors of the Commission were approved and the prototypes finally accept£·d. The <li:.;tl'ihntiou was effoctecl by lot, and tho,se apportioned to the United States wer6Metres Nos. 21 and 27. Kilogrammes Nos. 4 and 20. Each of the metres is accompanied by small sectious of the hars, cut oft' when the bara were being reduced to the required Ieugtl1, and by two mereuriat thermometers, the errors and constants of which were carefully determined by the Interuatioual Burea!l. They are made of" verre dur," and are numbered respectively 43:n, 43.12, 43:33, 4334, 4335, and 4336, the last two belonging to Metre No. 12 of the alloy of 187 4, previously referred to. The standards having been accepted were packed and sealed under the direction of the r nited States delegate, Dr. B. A. Gould, a copy of whose report is appended, and were transfered to the care of l\ir, Whitelaw Reid, t.he Unitecl States Minister to Paris. From him M.etre No. 27 and Kilogramme No. 20, and also 1\fetre No. 12 of the alloy of 1874, were recei>ed by Prof. George Davidson, Assistant, United Rtates Coast arnl Geodetic Sur..,-ey, by whom they were hronglit to Washington and tlepositcd iu the Office of 'Yeig;hts and Measures. The cam with wl1icl1 tliey were transported is attested by one of the appenued doc1m1ents. On January 2, 1890, Metre No, 27 and Kilogramme So. 20 were carried to the Cabinet room in the Executi\e Mansion, where the ceremouy of breaking the seals upon the boxes was perfm·rned in the presence of the President of the United States, tbe Secretary of State, arnl tlle Secrl."t:ll'y of the Treasury, together with a distinguished company of scientific men. A. formal certificate declaring the condition of these standards at the opening of the boxes was signed by the Presiuent and witnessed by tho Secretary of State and tlJC Secretary of the Treasury. A somewhat similar cer· tificate was signed by the other gentlemen prcsen t. Iu consequence of this official act of the President of the United States, Metre No. 27 and Kilogramme No. 20, '.lil! be guarded as our National Prototype Metre and Kilogramme .. The Metre No. 21 and Kilogramme No. 4 belonging to the United States, which, at the re(]uest of the United States Minister, remained deposited at the Intemat.ional Bureau of \Veigllt" :rnd Measures in Paris, were brought to '\Vashiugton by l\Ir. 0. H. Tittmann, .Assistant, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, whose report on their safe transportation is appended. All i.hese standards are now deposited in the fireproof standa,rds room of the United States Office of Weights and .Measures. Each metre is inclosell in a wooden case lined with Yelvet, aud this in turn fits into a cylindrical brass tube. The manner in which the Kilogrammes are kept is shown in the plate (illustration No. 68) and requires no description. The Kilogrammes rest immediately on a quartz plate of about the same diameter as the standard. The whole support is coyered by two glass bells which exclude all dust.

The standards prepared by the Committee were submitted to the General Conference, together with a detailed report of the work of the Committee, and au account of the standards constructed under their direction and .supervision ; as also of the results of the seYeral comparisons between these, and the selection of those which are to serve as the international or fundamental prototypes. This report, iu printed form, has been transmitted to the United States Government, in the usual way, through the Legation at Paris. The work and results of the International Committee received the unanimous indorsement and sanction of the Conference, and on the 26th of September, the International Protot_ypes of the Metre awl Kilogramme were formally adopted. Thereupon they were cleposited in tha subterranean chamber constructed for the purpose, and the door was secured by three locks, the keys of which were respectively given to the Superintendent of the Archives of France, to the President of the Committee, and to the Director of the Bureau, as provided by article 18 of the "Reglement" annexed to the '' Ocuvention du Metre" of May 20, 1875. With ea.ch of the International Prototypes were deposited two other and similar standards which had been comparell with them with the same care as that bestowed up-0n the National Prototypes prepared for distribution The assignment of the National Prototypes to the several States w;1A determined hy lot. The m1mber of metre prototypes was thirty, twenty-sev.en of which were thus distributed. Those falling- to the United States bear the numbers 21 and 27. Four metre standards had been constructed and eompared, made from the "alloy of 1874." Of these the United States had called for one, and that assigned by lot to their share bears the number 12. The Kilogramme Prototypes falling to the share of the United States are those numbered 4
and20.

'J'he length of the metre standards received by this country is as follows: For the two Prototypes,

No. 21 equa.ls 1 m+ 2·5µ + 8·665µ T No. 27 equals 1m-1·6µ+8·651µ T

+ 0·001µ Tl + 0·001µ Tl

For the standard from alloy of 1874, No. 12 equals lm

in which equationsµ denotes a micron or thonsanclth part of a millimetre, and T represents the number of degrees of the Centigratle scale of the hydrogen thermometer. The mass, or weight at normal altitude, of the two kilogramme prototypes i>l as follows: No. ·i equals lkg - 0·075mg-, its volume being 46·418rnl. No. 20 equal:> lkg- O·O:)Omg, its volume being 4fr402rnl.
It may not be amiss to adtl here that the probable error of a comparison of the metre bars does not exc~eed two-tenths of a micron, and that of a comparison of the kilogramme 11rototypes does not exceed ti ·e-thousanclths of a milligram me. The t1uee metre staJl(lanls aml the two kilogramme t-itarnlarus ::1bove mentiorwll, were oifieially accepted in behall" of tlle Uuited States, by the undersigned, using the form herewith inclosell * aud marked "A." This was then exchangeLl for a second receipt giYcn by the Direc·t.or of the Bllreau iu tile form of which a <\opy is likewise inclosed, .. marke(l "B." By this tlw Director engaged himself t.o t::tke the i>ame care of these standards as iu the p:ist and to hold tlH·m sttbject to tl!e order of the undersigned. On the 2Stb of September I again personally examined each of the lh-e prototype:,;, according to the instructions of the Honorable Secretar.1, and satisfied myself that tltey were iu per-feet order for safe transportation, auil arranged in conformit,y with the rule.;; established for tbe pnrpuse by the International Committee. After closing the inner cases I placetl my personal se<tl up;·n ea~h in such manner that they can not be oper1ed without breaking the seals. Tliis is a, (}ot!1it· letter, (§, surmounted by a crest, and the same as that used for tlie en\'elope of this report. The cases containing thH metre prototype. No. 27, and standard So. l:!, and Urn kilogramme prototy1)e No. 20, were theu carefully packed at the Bureau under my owa superdsion, and the same seal was placed over two of the screws with which the lid of each box is fastened. Tliese were then delivered to the Minister of the United States, l\Ir. Reid, who took pernoual charge of them, giving me his official receipt therefor, and conveying them to the Legation ]n his own carriage. The other two prototypes, viz, Metre No. 21, and Kilogramme No. 4, remaiued deposited at the International Bureau, after having recei>ell the i,:;eal of tlte United States Legation. Tlte pre,·ions receipt from the Director of the Bureau was then exchanged for a similar one by which tiley were held subject to tlrn order of the Minister of the United Stat.es, who then relieved me from further responsibility by giving me his official receipt for these also. Instructions for the transportation, unpacking, ant! safe keeping of the prototypes ha>e been prepared by the International Committee, and priutetl copies will be given to persons to whom their transportatior1 is intrustell. A CGpy of tllese" Indications" i;; herewith inclosed,* antl gives detailed instructions as to the manner in which the cases should be opened and their contents withdrawn. Boxes 1-1irnilar to tho:,;e containing the Kilogramme prototypes, but specially marked, accompany each of these, anll contain the hell glasses under which tho Kilogrammes are to be k·~pt after remo\'ing th~m from the metallic covers which are to protect them d11ring transportation. Bnt inasmuch as it is desirable that the m<~tallic covers be used. only during travel the KilogmmmP Xo. 4, now at the Bureau, wi!J remain for the present under its dollllle lleU glass. Conse<lUflntly it will be necessary to break the seals when it is prepared for transportation. ~Witll each metre bar is inc1osecl a small piece of the same metal, cut from the end of the bar previous to itsgracluation. Aud in the boxes containing the bell glasses for each Kilogramme is a package containing the ring which is to support them, aucl tlie plate of rock crystal upon which the prototype is to rest. Finally, a small case is sent c011taining the pincers to be used in llan· dliug the prototype.

Whitelaw Reid, Minister of the United States to :Franoe, to delinn to rne one set of tho National i1rototypes of the Staudard Metre and Kilogramme of the "Bureau International des Poids et Mesures;" and the instructions of the Superintendent direct and empower me to receive the same from him. and to carry and deliver them at \Vashington. I presenteil copies of the three letters to the .:llinister of the l:'nited States and conferred witll birn :lhont the transfer. Ho had Rttended one conference of tho" Confc'rencc (h~nerale dei; Poids <'t 1\1csnrc", ''awl at. tlw next con· fercnce he wonl<l rccci ve one set of prototypes and hold the.m until I was ready to srart for the Unlted States. I verLall,\· communicated tbo fact of my appointment as Learer to Dr. B. A.

Di-. Gould saicl he was going <lirect to Boston and not to 'Vashiugton, that his health was not strong, and that hr, foH unlike assuming the responsibility of the care and transportation of such valuable instrnments. · On the afternoon of the 27th of Se::itemher I visite(l the" Pavlllon cle Bretellil ''at Senes, the estahlislnnent. of the "Bureau International des Poids tJt Mesures," and was cordially rticeived by Dr. Reue Benoit, the Director At my request be exhibited to me the three prototypes 12, 21, 27 of the standard metre. then replaced them, and with Dr. Chappuis I sealed the metallic tubes with the ordinary s e a l ® of th" Bureau. The tube::; were left to he

I have not seen it since. I did not see the other prototype of the standard IHlogramrne. On tho :30th of Septemher I visite<l Hon. \V11itelaw Reid anJ he informed me that ho had received from the "Bureau International t1es PC>ids et :!>fesur<·"" the above prototypes, and that he held them snhject to my reqnieition.

Robert T. Lincoln, Minister of the Unibed States at London, he cffoeted this object. On Saturda~·, October 26, I received a telegram from the United Sta tee Legation at Loudon, stating that the boxes woultl bo admitted into England withont examination. On Sunday, the 27th of October, at 2 p. m., I received from the United States Minister tho following boxes: Oue box made of half-inch "deals,'' 47 by 6! by 6t inches, stencil-marked 12, with no other designation; sealed in dull-red wax at each end of the top over a screw h()ad, with lion rampant over old English G.

On the 15th of November the steamship rea.chod New York, and the bos:es were carefully transferred to a pa.Jaco oar for 'Washington, wlrnre they were deposite<l in the fireproof buildit1g of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on tho afternoon of that clay, until I made this written report and transfer to Superiutondent Mendenhall. Up io thi~ time the boxes have been constantly under my eye or locked in my room in my absence; I have witnessetl each h:mdliug, accC>mpauiel each transfer, and thoro has been no shock to thorn, and no vibration oxcPpt such as is inevitable to railway and stoamship travel. Even this vibration has been very much lossened l>y the cushions or rag~ upon which the boxes have ueon placed.

O:F!'ICE OF °'WEIGHTS A~D MEASURES,

Washington, D. <J., .l~tly 18, 1890. At the i11sta11ce of T. C. 2\lendenha11, Superintendent U. S. Coast anu Geodetic Survey, the Secretary of the Treasury requested th~ Secretary of State to charge me, the undersignetl, with the duty of bringing these Standards from Paris to Washington. The letter of instructions from the Secretary of State, preparell iu accordance with that request, is dated J\Iarch rn, 1890. It contemplates the performance of other correlated duties which are more fully set forth in a letter of instructions from Snperintendeut Mendenhall, dated April 19 1
18fW.

After the performance of the oti1er duties I presented my&elf again at the Uni tell Sta Le& Legation in Paris, and on July 4 received the receipt which Dr. lteue Benoit, Director of the Interna· tional Bnreau of "Weigl!ts and 1\feasnres, had gh'en to l\Ir. Whitelaw ltcid, United States l\linister to France, when the latter deposited the standards for safe-keeping at the International Bureau of Weights aud .'.\lcasurcs, subject to his, the United States Minister's, orders. Ou the presentation of this receipt, by preYious appointment, on the afternoon of July 4, 1890, at 3 o'clock p. m., the sealell metallic case containing MetL·e No. 21 was taken from an iron safe in the International Bureau lmilding by Dr. Guillaume, Scientific Assistant of the Bureau, in my presence. The case ·was sealell with three seals, that of t.lie United States J,egation, tllat of Dr. B. A. Gould~ and that of the International Bureau. The seals were examined hy me and were found intact, hut were not touched. Tue case con. taining the metre mHl the small box containing the enu pieces cut from the metre bar, after having been wrapped in paper, were put in a deal packing Lox fillell with hay, the lid of which was then screwed down. Kilogramme?'\ o. t, mounted on its base under its double bell-glass oov~r, was then taken from another iron safe. The bell-glasses were sealed to the base in such a way by two seals (Dr. Gould's private seal arnl the seal of the United States legation) that access to the Kilogramme could not be hacl without breaking the seals. Having identified them, and having assured myself that they were intact, I broke them in order that the Kilogramme might be packed for transportation. In the presence of Dr. Gnillaume, Dr. Chappuis, and myself, Dr. Benoit took out the Kilogramme aml packed it for transportation in accordance with the method prescribeu by the International Commission. The bcll~jars and other accessories were also packed in my presence. The complete set of standards was thus i1acked in three boxes. These were immediately taken to a carriage in waiting and deposite(l inside. Taking my place along side of them I was driven to Paris, where I depositetl the boxes in my room at the Hotel de la Tamise~ at about Gp. m.

I>ESCRIPTION.

The transverRe section of the bar has the shape called X, the sides of the circumscribed SfJ.nare of which are 20 n1illirnetres long. Tho upp<'r surface of the medial rib, on which the lines a.re traced, is in the plane of the neutral axis; it was ma.de to coinoide with tlrn mean height of the section hy slightly thinning the lower legs of the X. On tile polished snrfaccs near each extremity three lines, from 6 to~ microns.wide, are traced O·;J millimetres apart. The length of the o;taudllrcl is <lefiued by the distance between the mi<ldle lines of each of these two group~. The position of tho a:s.is is <lefiue<l by two longitudinal lines 0·'2 millimetres apart, ruled on the polished surfaces. On tho upp<'r surface of the upper flange, cut with a graver, on t!Je left is the inscription A.27, on the right B. Z7. Tho two i;pecirneus, which accompany the prototype in a separn.te bo.it, haye the same numbers aud letters cut upon them with a grayer as the ends from which they were cut.
CHE~IICAL CO~lPOSITION.

The preparation of the platinum and iridium used for the alloy of the ingot from which the bars were drawn was controlled by Mr. Stas, m1m1llcr of the Academy of Scieuces of Brussel.~, delegate of t-be International Committee, by Henri Sainte-Claire-Devillo, and after his death by Debray, members of the "Institute of France," and delegates of the French section. The analysis of the alloy waa made by these savants by means of several specimens taken directly from the finishetl bars. According to tbe results of these analyses the alloy containell no trace of iridium in a free state, nor any rntl1eniurn, and only an extremely small quantity, one or two ten-thousandths, of rhodium, and one ten-thousandth of iron. The percentage of iridium was found equal to 10.08 to 10.09. · .Mr, Tornoo, Aide> in the International Bureau, took part under tbe direction of Mr. Debray in tho nnalyaes ma.de in tlrn laboratory for advanced Bttulies of the normal high school in Paris. .After the death of Mr. Deli ray, Mr. Tornoo edited a detailo·l r"port on those analyses, which is publishe<l in volume VII of tho "Travaux et Memoires" of the International Bureau.
DETERMINATION.

Coefficient of expansion.-The tletermina.tion of the coeftlcient of expansion was intrusted to Mr. R. Benoit, principal as~istant of the International Bureau, with the co-operati,onof:Ml'. Ch. Guillaume, at.tach6 of the Bureau. This
determination w:i.s llla<le by comparing Prototype No. 27 with the International Prototype [ll in tbe trough of tbe comparator for expansions, a.t eight different temperatures comprised between 0·1° and 3?"4". The expansion of the International Prototype had been previously determined by the :ibsolutc method l1y means of the comparator for expausion as well as by Fizeau's methotl. These observations gave the following result.: Coefficient of expansion of Prototype No. 27 from oo to P

Length nt zero: The comparitsons for length were made on the Brunner comparator, in t!Jc water trough, under the immediate direction of the Director, Mr. Broch, l·y Messrs. Boinot and lsaachsen, Aides in the Uureau. The :National Prototyp.cs, numbering 30, wern compared among themselves in 11 crossed gro111·s-that is to say, in;, groups uffi bars and in 6 groups of 5 bars. Besides, each one was compared on the cue band wit.h tbe })rovisional protot~'l'"' I,, l·elonging to tho International Bnreau, and which was compared in 1882 with the Metre des .Archiv-es of FrntH'·', and on the other hand with tbe new International Prototspe 9;)l. Finally these two, I, and !iQ, were compare<l ,,·ith each other. Iu each group the comparisons were ma.de in all possible combinations. Each complete comparison ·consisted of four i udividual con111ariso1rn in the four different positions into which the bars could be put relatively to the two microscopes and to the ohservers. Tho result of these 196 complete or 784 individual comparisons gave for Metre No. 27 Prototype No. 27= lm-1'6µ The equation of this prototype is therefore·

EARLY EXPLORATIONS IN THE REGION OF BERING SEA AKD STRAIT.

In 1648 the tide of exploration and adventure setting eastwanl through Siberia impelled the fitting out of seven small trading boats on the Kolyma River. Three of these, in charge of Simeon Deshneff, Gerasirn Ankudinoff, and Feodor Aie:xieff, rm'l11ectively, reaehed Bering Strait. ..A.nkudinoff's boat was wrecked ou East Cape, but his party were accommodatetl by the others. There were hostilities with the Chukchi, the two boats were separated, and DesbnefPs alone finally reaclied Kamchatka. Next year he constructed the trading post on the Anadyr ltiYer, subsequently known as Anadyrsk. Tlmre is a tradition that in 1654 a trader named Taras Stadukin followed DeshnefFs route, made a portage across the neck of East Cape, circumnavigated Kamchatka, diC'covered the Kurile Islands, and finally reached the Gulf of Penjina in safety. In 1711 an emissary named Peter Iliunsen Popoff was sent to East Oape by the Russians, to indnee the Clmkchi to pay tribnt. In this be failed; but brought back an account of islands beyond East Cape, :ind of a continent reported by the Olmkchi to exist beyond these islands. Some statements which be made in regard to the people of this continent were regartled by geograp'l!ers of the last century as fictitious, but, with our better knowledge, they set the seal of authenticity upon Popoff's report, and show that his journey was really made.~ ~The political disorders which prevailed in western Ilussia a.bont this period prevented any attention from being directed to the reports of these explorations, which were preserved in the archives at Yakutsk. Somewhat later the attention of geograpl.iers was directed toward tllis unknown corner of the world, and the subject was brought to the notice of Peter the Great. He took great interest in it, d~w up instructions for an expedition with his own band, and <lelinired them to Count Apraxin, with orders to see them executed. A few days later, in January, 1725, he died; but the Empress, desiring to carry out all the plans of her deceased husband as closely as po'ssible, ordered tlieir execution. Fleet-Captain Vitus Ivanovich Bering was nomiuated to the command of the expedition, and Lieutenants Martin Spanberg and A.lexie Chirikoff to be his assista.n ts. ""
"Por instance, he reported that the Chukchi said that the natives on the great llLud opposite East Cape wore tails. This was regarded by M!iller, to whoru we owe all oar knowledge of Popoff's journey, a.M manifestly absurd. Bnt a.Ii wbo are familiar with tho Eskimo of the American side of Bering Strait know that, on formal occasions, at dances or festi vale, they do tie a wolf's or dog's tail in the middle line of the back as if it grew there; so that the Chukchi report to Popoc11' waa quite trne.

Bering and Spa.nberg were Danes who had taken service with R11ssia, Obirikoff was a Russian, and so was Peter Chaplin, one of the mostpromisiug cadets of the Naval College at St. Petersburg, who was detailed for service on the expe<litiou. The literature resnlting from this expedition, our sources of information about it, and t11e practical results obtained for geographical research have been detailed and discussed by the writer in a recent publicati(ln,· from which the introductory paragraphs of this paper hm~e been taken. To that the reader is referred fo:;- most of the details. It coufaius a complete translutiou of Beriug's official report, which previously was accessible Ollly in tlrn Russian tongue aud in a rare and little-known periodical. This report had heen used by variom; writers, abstracted or paraphrased in some of its parts, hut not completely rendered iuto any of the lauguages of western Europe. .A.notlter source, which may be regarded as uearl.r original, is the abstract by Vasili Bergh of the journal of Peter Chaplin, one of tlw members of tlHJ party. Bergh found this in tbe arclliYes of tbc Imperial :Naval Col1eg(', of which Chaplin was a cadet. Be also had access to the journal of Alexie Chirikoff, oue of Bering's lieu: ena11ts. l·'rom these sources he compiled a liistory of tlie YOJaget, which was printed at St. Petersburg, in 1823, in the Russian lauguage. This hook lrns been ust>d, through the medinm of a maunscript translation, by Peter Laurid1:Sen, the latest bjograplier of Bering. A somewhat condensed translation of Lauritlseu's book has recently appeared in this country. 'The original appeared in Danish. Lauridsen clitl not quote exaetly from Bergh or indicate preci;;cly what part of his book was derivetl from that source, and, lia\'ing 1lltt·rcd. through three tra11slatious aud 1ieen twice abridged, it is evident that whate,-er originality appertains to Bergll's material in the first place can in no wise have been preserved. Be.-<ide the diftlculties refPrred to, a 1rnmlwr of serious errors, typographical or of the translators, make tlle value of Lauridsen's book antl its Euglish abritlgment, for historical purposes, very sliglit indeed. I have, therefore, while quite aware of the slenderness of my own cqnipment as a Russian scholar, thought that a straight-forward rendering of the facts preserved by Bergh would be an acceptable document to those who are intereste(l in the history of the exploration of our nortl1western coasts and the region of Bering Sea. TLe book is now exceedingly rare. I am indebted to the kind offices of Daron NordernskiOld and to the extraordinary liberality of the University of Upsala. for an opportunity of examiniug it.:j: 'Iberc are two or three copies in St. Petersburg and one in the library of the Bl'itish J\fuseurn. I have been unable to trace any others. Bergh does not alway8 state his facts in t:haplin's own language, though be has done it in what seemed to him important matters. It is quite evident, however, that all l1is facts not derived from /\liiller are from the journals of Chaplin and Chirikoff, except where he states otherwise. I have therefore extracted from Bergh, in the notes hereto appendeu, all the facts he gives about the expedition, omitting uearly all bis reflections upon them, ancl all that be derived from Mi.iller and otller accessil>le authorities. The Russian language in 1823 was less fully formed than it is to day, and many of tbe words used in Cllapliu's journal arc archaic, obsolete, or veculiar. The transla· tion ha.-; therefore been somewhat difficult 1 yet it is bt·fowed to be free from serious error, D.nd is submitted to the elmritahle judgment c·f the render. The publication first of Bering's report and now of the summary of Chaplin's journal puts before those wlto read English the onl;y original documents hitherto printed, which lian_i not, np to tlie preseut time, lie<'n accessible to students. In brief it may he said that the expedition crossed northern Asia with wagons, barges, boats, sledges, or pack horses, observing latitude and variation of tlie compass when possible, and work. ing out their longitude h.r tlie computation of directions and liistances.

On the 8th of Fe1Jrnary the party ani\·ed at Vologdic, an(l on the 14th were joiue1J hy I<'leet Captain Vitus Ivanovich Bering, Lieutenant Spanberg, 3 mates, and 3 sailors. Instructions had been drawn up for Captain Bning by the Tsar Peter I, December 23, 1724, and were comprised under the following three heads:

berg, the surgeon, 2 mates, 2 geodesists, and other members of the party. On the 16th Lieutenant Cbirikoff arrived with 7 barges. Six hundred horses loaded with flour were startecl for Okhotsk, divided into three parties. At the same time Captain Bering obtained from the Voivod the services of the monk Koznireffski. Brother Kozuireffski had borne an important part in the subjection of the northeastern extreme of Siberia. Ho was first stationed, in 1712 aud 1713, near the Kurile Islands, and obtainetl information about those arnl other islands. He servel many years in the settlements at Kameliatka, Oliutorsk, and Ana<lyrsk. He recei\·ed the tonsure in 1717, and entered the convent at I,o,rnr Kamchatka. In 1720 he came to Yakutsk, where excellent reports of him were received from the local traders of Kamchatka., when the Yakubk authorities as well as Captain Bering soup;ht him out. On the 7th of June Lieutenant Spanl.Jerg left Yakutsk with 13 barges and 2041rnople. Wbi1e at Yakutsk Bering detached on special serYice tile noule lvau Shestakoff, who aftt>rward went to make war ou the Chukchis witl1 his uncle, At!rnasins Shestakoff, Hetman of Co&sacks. Chaplin's journal notes that he bought of the noble Ivan 11 oxen, for which he paid 44 rubles, or about $32. All the material and pro,·isions being started for Okhotsk, Bering himself departed for that plaee on tlw Hitlt of August, 17261 with Chaplin and others, leaving Lieutenant Chfrikoff bebiml to follow in the spring. The latter determined the latitude of Yakutsk as 62° 08' aml the varia· tiou of the compass 10 57' easterly. In tlte last days of March, 1;27, an epidemic of measles developed in Yakutsk, i;o severe that by the miudle of Apr(l every one was ill, wllere none hall been ill uefore. No such pestileuce bad been known for balf a ceutnry and uone such occurred for 4t> years afterward. ~4-p1·il [Query, August'?] 29, 1736, there were forwarded to Okhotsk, ;JS oxen, ·1 cows, au<l 2 pigs. "Okhotsk settlement,'' says Chaplin, "stands on the bank of tlle I'in~r Okhot:t and contains 11 houses built of logs. The inhabit.ants subsist chiefly on the fishery, as grain is not grown. There are many tributary nativeB in the vici11ity of tlie place. The Lamuts call tlle Okhotsk Sea Lamo." By the !.l7th of October 278 horses with 54G sacks of :ftonr had arri;-cd at Okhotsk, less than half of those which bad been starteu from Yakutsk. Lieutenant Span berg (who bad started by water, i11 the hope to reach a laIJd-mark erected by the Siberian pioueer:,; uear the Yudoma Hiver, a crucifix: known as tile Cross of Yuuoma) was caught by frost near the moutlt of the Gorbeh River a long rlistance from his destination. Artisan Kozloff lost during his jonrney 24 horses, aml left their pack8 of flour at Yudorna Cross. The surgeon Jost 12 horses, and of 11 o:xeu only 1 arri\·erl. ..Nor did the horses at Okhotsk fare better. Chaplin states that on the lltlt of Novem· ber, of the remaining horses 121 were dead. During November the party were all engaged in getting; out timber for houses. Ou the 19th there was an extraordinary bigh tide which flooded the 'IV bole town, the latter being situated ou a low gravel spit. During the whole month the wind blew from the north. On the 2d of December Captain Bering occupied a newly erected houl'ie. 'l'he set.ting iu of winter found Spanl.Jerg in a barren and uninhabited J'egion where nothing could he }ll'Dcured. His party were obliged to proceed by land to Yudoma Cross and for food were rednc0(i to the greatest <~xtremity. On tlte 21st of December a I'eport from him was received to the effod that his party was on the roa<l wit.h 90 sledges, having left a mate and !) soldiers in charge of tlin hargcs; the next day 10 sledges of provisions, and twenty-four hours later 39 men with ~7 r;ledges, were dispatched to his relief. !17:.!7.] Early iu January, 1727, Spanberg arrived with 7 sledges at Okhotsk. On the 14rh of Pchnmry a party with 7G sledges started to bring in Spanberg's goods, returning two week" later, and by the Gth of April most of the rna.terial had aI'l'iVell at Okhotsk. Towimls tbe end of April the clerk, Tnrchanino:ff', hecame insane-a rmw wbo until then had been trnl'ted by Bering with serious or dangerous duties witl1 perfect confidence. He was imme· diat<·ly pnt under a strong guard and sent to Yakutsk to be returned to St. Petersburg. In the month of June, 172i, everything being madl3 ready for transportation to Kamchatka, the newly built vessel, named the Fortuna, was launched June 8 at Okhotsk. Ou the 11th Lnzhin and the remaining goods arrivecl from Yudoma. Cross. Toward the end -0f the month the vessel ha.cl been rigged and loaded with cargo for Kamchatka. Chaplin determil!ed tho latitude of Okhotsk to be 590 13' N.

July 1 1 1727, Spanberg sitiled for the Bolshoia. River, Kamchatka, in the Fortuna. Two da,-s after Lieutenant Cbirikoff arrivml from Yakutsk with the goods which had been left there, 110 horses and 200 sacks of flour in chf.l.rge of Quartermaster Borisoff. On the 10th a boat arrived from Boisheretsk belonging to the Treasury Department, and bringing two commissioners who had been sent out in 1725 to collect the Ka111cuatkan tribute. This was the same vessel which made the first voyage from Okhotsk to Kamchatka in 17 LG. Parties with additional supplies of flour, to the amount of about 600 sacks, arrived durin;,; this month and 50 oxen to supply salt beef for the cxpedi'tion. On the !20th a sergeant "ith reports for the Admiralty College was sent off." August 4 the old Yessel, having been repaired, was launched. On the 7th a high winll from the sea drove in a multitude of ducks wl11ch the whole expedition i;:et out to capture, briu~ing in 3,000, while as many more escaped or were a.llowe<l to get away. On the 11th of the month Lien· tenant Spauberg, with the Fortuna, returned from Bolsberetsk. Augnst 19, li'..!7, the command went on boarcl the vessels, Bering and Spanberg on the Fo1·tzrna, Chirikoff and Chaplin on the ohl vessel, whoso name is not mentioned. On the 22d tht~:r set sail. The vessels kept company, and the notes which follow were taken by Chaplin on his own vessel. On the 29th they saw the coast of Kamchatka in latitude 5;P 151; came to anchor and sent a boat for water to a river which was called Krutogoroff by those acquainted "ith the coa~t. On the 1st of September, in the afternoon, they "eighed anchor and stood to the southward. At 3 o'clock on the 2d they arrived at tho mouth of the Bolshoia River, and at 6 p. rn.. they were joined by the Jtortuna. It was highwater at 7:30, four hours and fifty-four minutes before the moon's transit over the meridian. The latitnde was 520 43' N. The difference of longitiule between Okhotsk and Bolslrnretsk was computed to be 130 43'. The place was ol>sern'd to be in latitude 52C> 45', aml the n1.riatiou was 100 !?8' easterly. At noon on the 6th of September, Beriug, Spanherg, and the surgeon went ashore and were followed by most of the party in small boats. On the 9th Lieutenant Chirikoff also left hi:,i Yc»scl for foe shore. Most of the monlh was employed in taking cargo in small boats up the river Bolshoia as far as possible to sani labor later ou. About the middle of the month Span berg left Bolsheretsk on his way to I.ower Kamc.IJ.atk:L settle·

ment.
There. were 17 houses at Bo1shere.tsk1 accordmg to Ohirikoff's journal. On the 6th of October the above-mentioned boats arrived at Lower ['! Upper] Kamchatka, · tlte only losses being 2 anchors ancl 8 sacks of flour. [1728.J Janum·y 4, 1728, 78 sledges of different goods aml the commander's baggnge set out for Upper Kamchatka settlement. Januar.r l'l, :Bering- himself, and his whole part.v followed. January 25 all arrived safely at Upper Kamchatka, a distance of 4SG \'erst;; from Bolsheretsk. This settlement of 17 hom1cs was situated ou the left bank of the Kamchatka River, aud priu· cipally occupied by tlie officers who collected the tribute and their employes. The set.tlemcnt of Upper Kamchatka, acconliug to Chirikoff's journal, contained 40 Russians. It is situated in latitude 5i 0 28', and toe \c-ariation of the compass is 11° 3±' ertsterly. [Krasbininikoff wintered llere in 1738, when there were 22 Louses and 56 Russian re!'irleu t )(.] Here Be1·ing remained 'l weeks supervising the dispatch of goods ou sledges to I~ower Kamchatka, for which place he and the rest of his part.r startell ou the 2(1 of .March, arriving there safely 011 the l lth. The settlement was on the right bank of the Kamchatka River, and consistell of about 40 houses, scattered along the bank for the distance of a verst. SeYen ..-ersts to the SE. by E. are the hot springs, where there was a church and 15 house.,;. Here Span berg· was recruiting, his !Jealth bBing impaired. From Upper KaIUcllatka, to Luwer Kamchatka. the <1istance was regarde<l as 3!J7 versts, so'that all the goods and material hatl been transported 85~'1 versts.
"These <lispatches took nearly a. year to rPach tbcir destination. A not.e and abstra.ct in the archives of the Uni\'Ol'sity of Upsala, filed with 'Va.:iwhi chart of the e:x:pedit.irm of 1741, states that o.n the 28th of August, 1728, the .Admiralty College ordere<l that from the journals and charts sent hy Captain Bering a clmrt should be prepared showing his complete ruute, of whlch n11 al>stract follows, which st.ates that for that part of th~ journey beyond Okhotsk no report had a.t the time of writing been received.

On the 4th of April, 1728, all the party joined in !Jeginning tlie construction of the vess9I. Bering issued a b{)untiful allo\Vaace of wiue fo all harnl~. By ollservation the I.ttit111le (of Lower Kamclrntka} was found to be 5GO 10'. On tile 30th of l\fay Lientet1<tnt Ch1rikolf arrived with all the remaining people of the commaml. Iu March, April, and l\Ia~·, strong southerly gales were experienced. On the Hth of .Tune the newly lrnilt T"essel was dedicated and name<l the Gab;·iel, with re:igious services, aud successfully launclted. The commu.mler celehrated the occasion by the free distribution of two aml a half bnckets of wine. Un the 9th of .July all was pllt on board the vessel, arnl on the 13th, with all sail set, they left the mouth of the river Kamehatk<l an:l entered the seu.. The surveyor, r~uzhin, was left behiml un account of illness. [Ile was tlie man who ha(l been sent by Peter the Great, in 17Hl, to explore for gold the six: Kurile Islands.] Four soltliers were ahm left as a gnard for the barrac~ks awl stores. J,ieutenant Chirikoff says: "Below this place, near the mouth of the Kamchatka l{i\·er, on the coast, the point from which we took our departure was reckoned in longitm1e as the first meridian to whid1 it fa necessary to a<hl the differenr~e of longitude from St. Petersburg. Starting with tlrn longitnde obtaiuetl by the obsernition of an eclipse at Ilimsk, October 10, 1725, tbe sum of all the calm1Iated longitudes to this place (Lower Kamchatka.) is 12G0 01' 49"." "Tue respected Ubirikoff, in his statement of the longitude observed at I!imsk," says Bergh, "bas ma1le au important error. Obsern1tiou:-i of his on shipboard are much more accurate. llis journal of the ri\·er Yoyage from Tobohk to Ilimsk: makes the whole longitude ;3G 0 44', which is admitted at present; the observation abo\"e mentione;l oaly 3oc:i U'.

At smll'ise the \'ariation was 19° 37' B.; three hours later 25" 21' E. The course was NE. by N. ¥- N. (true) until 11 a. m., when the wind dietl away. Tlie whole shore along which they s;1ilerl was bordered by high mountains. One of them, which still retained snow in se-rnral places, was namerl Pestrovitlnoi (Harlequin) Mountain. Forty-eight miles were made good and tile latitude obserrnd to be 610 3'. July 24.-A.t noon the water was warm and pleasant; the vessel becalmed off the coa,st. lu the evm1ing the willll strengthened and bltJw in gusts from the mountains. July 25.-After noon rain witli a steong breeze, which lessened toward evening and was followed b.f a lleav,\' sea. To the north they saw a prominent cape,. which im~jected from the high range of mountains. The latitude by ob:,;en·atiou was GP 32', which agree1l well with the ship's reckoning. The Yariation was 210 00' E . · July 26.- Wiu(l light, with clear weather. The >essel was coasting aloug }Jarallel with the shore under all sail, at a distance of about twenty miles. In the eveniug foey saw a bay 1,ving to the ~W. b.Y :X. (snppose1l by Bergh to be the estuary of the Khatirka Hivei:J. Eighty milPs were made good on this day, and the variatious ot' the compass were determined on two occasions as 210 05' anil 210 10' easterly, respecti>el~·. July ~7, 1728.-Light changeable winds and bright sunshine. A cape w·as passed at a distance of 3 miles, the general trend of the coast parallel to the vessel's course being dist(int about 15 miles. In this vicinity a river appears to enter the sea. Near the cape [St. Thaddeus} many whales, seals, walrus, and different bin.ls were seen. Soundings were had hereabouts in 'i'O to 87 fatuoms. During the calm weather many eatable fish were caught, of tlle salmon family. July 28.-Light wincls and rain. A current was observed to the SE. b.r S. of a knot an honr. Porpoises, whales, sea lious, walms, and birds were abundant. Umler all sail 30 miles N. by 1-V. were made. At noon the shore was distant about 15 miles, and high craggy mountairn; were observed close to the sea. July 29.-Variable winds and overcast foggy weather. The land which had hitherto bflen bordered by high mountains now appeared to be less elevated. Soundings were had in 12 fatl10ms, fine sand. 'l'hirt_y.four miles were made good to the NW. by N. this day. At midnight Captain Bering ordered the ves::;el laid to uutil daybreak, when slw proceeded along the land at a distance of a mile and a l.Jalf, the lieptJ1 being lOk fathoms. July 30.-0vercast weatlrnr and changeable wind. At fl p. m. raining; the shore being distant a mile and a half the vessel anchored in 12 fathoms, an(l Chaplin was sent to find a watering plat\e near which sheltered anchorage could be had. On re[;ching the shore he found neither a watering place nor a safe anchorage, t>oxcept perhaps at fiooll tide. The bay could be ascended only with difficulty, as the shoals were not visible. On Chaplin's return they weighc1l <lHchor and stood along the shore in about 14 fathoms water. July 31, 1728.-The whole day foggy and overcast. The shore to the NW. and NE. was occasionally visible. The vessel made 85 miles in a. NE. directiou. The depth of the water continued to be from 10 to 13 fathoms. Abollt noon they observed that the water began to be dis· colored and changed its appearance, which was explained by the appearanun, P\"Cr,nvhcre to the north, of 1antl which was very near by. A:ugut<t 1, 1728.-Dark, foggy weatltw, with rain, the wind gradualls rising. As they wen~ sailing only 3 miles from the high and rocky coast Bering maue all sail to the S. and S\V. to make an offiPg. Against the current the sails made nothing remarkable. At 2 in the morning tacked ship and carried away the iron traveler to which the l.>0om tackle was made fast.

As the day was the Grmco·Russian festival of the Holy Cross, Bering garn that name to the bay in which they were, and called the river Bolshoia (Great) Uiver.* .Augiist 2.-Ualm overcast weather continued until 8 p. m. The depth was 58 fathoms, muddy bottom. At 8 a moderate hreeze sprang up and at midnight land was \'isible to the ENE., 5 miles distant. The depth here, was 12 to 14 fathoms, stony bottom. At noon the latitude was observed to be G:;o 2:>' . ..iugust 3.-'Veather dark antl wind moderate.

August 4.-0vercast weather and mouerate airs. Beyond the southeast poiut of entrance to Holy Cross Bay the vessel sai1ed parallel to a high rocky coast and made .36 miles to the ESE. Tlie depth was about 12 fathoms, grave1ly bottom. ~lugust 5, 1728.-Calm and gloomy weat,her. The course and shore continued about the same. Nothing of importance occurred. August 6.-Moderate breeze and cloudy weather. From 1 to 9 o'clock carefol wa,tch was kept for any watering place, the stock on board having uecome reduced to a single cask. At G o'clock they approached high rocky monatains extending to the northward like a hi;,?;h wall. At a valley between tile mouutaius a small bay was discovered and anchorage had in 12 fathoms gravel. In lwnor of the church festival the bay was narne1l Preobrazhenia, or Transfiguration Bay. Aitgust 7.-At noon Chaplin was sent with 9 or 10 men to bring fresh water aml sketch the shore line. From a small mountain stream fed by the snow on t!Je peaks they obtained 22 casks of water. They also fouud an empty but, which appe:ued to ha>e been recently occu11ied by Chukchi. In mauy places foot pat us were noted. B~- seven the sketch of the bay was done [but no cop>· of it is now discoverable]. August 8.-W"ind moderate, weather cloudy. At noon weighed anchor and proceeded SE. by S. aluug tlte coast, which continue(I high autl rocky. A~ :> o'clouk a bay was observed, which exteu<led to the N~E. with a width of about 9 miles. At 7 o'c1ock a,. m. a canoe was seen paddling toward the Rhip, containing 8 men. There were on tlrn ship two Kariak interpreters, who were directed to address the people in the canoe. Tile natin~s said they were Chukchi, and inquirecl wheuce and why the vessel came. Uaptain Bering told the interpreters to ask the natives to come to the ve8sel. After a good <leal of delay one of tlie men at last came swimming to the vessel on iutlate\l sealskius. TlH' Chukchi said that many of their nation lived along the coast, and that tliey had hearu of the Uussians a long time ago. Being asked where the .Anadyr River was, they replied a long way to the westward. On a fair day, at a narrow cape not far from them, the Chukchi said an i::iland would be visible near the uoast. ({eceiving a small gift from Captain Berfug the native returrwtl to his canoe. 'l.'l1e interpreters asked him to persuade uis companions to come np uear tl1e ,·,·ssel. They approachell for a 8hort time, then made off again. The interpreters said that there was 11111c:h <liffer·ence betweeu the Kariak dialect and that of these Chukchi, so that they were not able to get from them all tlrn inforirnition that would have been dP.sirable. The Chukchi cauoe was ma(le of skins. Tlie latitude of the place where they saw these Cliukcbis was 640 41'. August 9.-Calm, cloudy weather. They were all <lay getting round the Chukchi Cape, and sailed only 3.:i miles on variou:-; courses.

This is mi<rr<preserrted on La.uridsen's so-called reproduction of Bergh's ma.p. \Vitbont the origi,nal log book it is impossib!t1 to test this theory, but it is ct\rta.inlynwre in acoordanee with some of the faet&now known tbau th~ supp<>sition that Bering entered the sba.llow estuary now known as Holy Cross Bay, although the latter is repr.,stmted ou llering's chart.

Sailed this day :!9 miles, which was augmented by current S]i- miles, as meutione(l by Bering, from SSE. to NNW. "At noon," says Chaplin, "we saw high laud behind us, and also alJout 3 o'clock saw high mountains~ which were pr·obabiy on the continent." At noon the latitude was reckoned at 660 41 1 · August 15.-Light wind, cloudy weathei·. At noon saw many whales. Since the 12th of Aug· ust the sea water had been discoloretl, the depth, 23 to 36 fatlioms. Sailed 158 miles this day, to which the current added 8~ more. Augitst 16.-IJight wind, cloudy weather. From Hoon to 3 p. m. sailed to the NE., making 7 miles. Then the course was change;} to S. byW. ~ \V. The journals of both Chirik:off and Chaplin say, ''at 3 o'clock Captain Beriug announcerl that it was necessary for him, in spite of his instructions, to return and put the vessel about, with orders to steer S. by SE. b.Y compass.'' The latitude of the point froru which Bering turned back was 678 18', and it was reckoned to be 3!P 17' E. from Lower Kamchatka. According to Bergh, who does not give the exact language of tlie journal, there was a fresh wind, anrl the vessel made over 7 knots an hour on her southerly counie. At!) a. m. they saw high mountains on the starboard (right) hand, ''on whiclJ/' says Chaplin," lin· Cl.mkchis," and later to seaward (on the left hand) au island. According to Bergb, Bering namet1 this island St. Diomede, in honor of the saint of the day, as was customary.* This day 115 miles were sailed, and tlie latitude was reckonetl at GG 0 02'. Augnst 17, 1728.-Fre.sh wind and moderate weather. The course was parallel to the land, on which numerous natives were seen and at two places dwellings v1ere obsern'\d.

SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS.

On the 14th of .July, ha\·ing been. rejoinetl by Lieutenant Spauberg, Bering i,;ailed for Okhotsk, where he arrived on the 23d of the month. The party celebrated their return by firing a salute of 51 guns, \Vhicll was repeated from the shore. The vessel was beached aud dismantled. On the 29th of July Bering started by land with horses for the Cross of Yudouia. Ou the journey be met Afanasius Shestakoff, Hetman of Cossacks, who was on his way to open the Chukchi country by force of arms, and who was, in l\larch of the following year, routed and killed near Pe11jinsk Gulf by a body of natives commanded by their chief, Slielagin, whose name is appro· priately preserved to posterity on charts of the .A.retie coast of bis country, through the medium of the Shelaginskoi Cape, in latitude 700 N. Bering reached Yakutsk, August 29, 1729, and Tobolsk in October, where he remained some time, finally reaching St. Petersburg March 1, 1730. Chaplin, whose journal has, through the medit1m of Bergh, preserved many facts in regard to this remarkable expedition, was recorded in 1723 as one of the most promising mwal cadets. On joining the expedition he was made midshipman; on their return, in 1729, promoted to be sublieutenant, and in 1733 to be lieutenant. He is said to have died at Arcliangel, in Russia, in 1764, having attained the rank of Captain· Commander. The joumal itself, with many other documents,· is deposited in the arcbh'es of the Naval College of the Admiralty in St. Petersburg. In oruer that the differences of calendar and account, and the errors of previous pnblica.tions may lie more easily avoided, I add a carefully corrected itinerary of the expedition reduced. to the modern dates. In some cases, where the authorities are discrepant, I have adopted the date which from all the circumstances seems most probably correct.

NOTES ON THE :MANUSCRIPT CHART [Illustration No. 69] OP BERING'S EXPEDITION OP 1725-'30, BELONGING TO THE COLLECTION OF BARON ROBERT KLINCKOFSTROM. STAFSUND, SWEDEN.

In the article in the National Geographic Magazine, already referred to, l have girnn a summary of existing information in regard to the cartogrnphic results of Bering's first linmchatka expedition. We may infer from the facts known to us that a rough chart of the land journey was made from day to day and also, when practicable, during the i:w·a voyage, and tlmt with the monthly report to the Admiralty College, which was required by his im;tructionR, copies of these rough sketches were forwarded when opportunity served. Bering had two professional cartographers beside Chirikoff and Chaplin, educated Naval surveyors. After his return to Kamchatka be wintered at the settlement near the mouth of the river known as Lower Kamchatka and during this time, without doubt, supervised the preparation of a chart of the voyage as well as his report. He returned to St. Petersburg in March, 1730, bringing a chart with him. It is probable that

772

tracings of this chart and brief abstracts of bis i·eport were sent out as matters of news, as the custom then was, and oue of these sketches was published b.r tlle Jesuit father Du Halde as an appendix to his monumental work on the history and geography of Chiua. ,\.11 the copies, even of this simple sketch ou a >cry small scale, which were printed before 174~ were more or less imperfect, but what seems to be a complete rendering of it appears in Campbell's edition of Harris's collection of voyages in 17 48. 'rl.1is was rt small engra>iug on copper measuring a bout 12·5 by 32·0 centimetres on the neat lines. After Bering's arriYal in St. Petersburg it is probable that a general recomputation rwrl revision of his data was made, and we are informed by La.uridseu that the charts (wllich we may regard a.s official and fiual) w-ere prepared at Moscow in 1731. These were much more elaborate and detailed chart;;, with ethnological, topographic, b_vclrographic, and magnetic details upon them which arc eutirely wanting in the earlier maps. This map, tl10ugh a number of copies must have beeu sent ont, was ne\·er engraved or published. Other geographers may and probably did use data compiled from it, hut the map, as a whole, never appeared in print. The remarkable results of the great Siberian expedition, of which Bering was the executive officer, may have drawn attention away from the earlier work. \VhateYer the reason, until now, this document so interesting from its bearing on the geographical histor,y of Amerim· arnl the progress of discon:ry, a.ud not without attractions for the stmlent of terrestrial magnetism, is now for the first time prcseutecl to the public. The title, enshrined in a flue oruamental escutcheon, reads in translation:
Geographic chart from
Tobols.~

to tlie Chukchi [Cap"], marie d11ring tlie Siberian E.rJH'difion undel' tlie comma11d of Fleet-

Captain [a 1>1:1nk space].

The blank space with which this inscription terminates was intended to receive the autograph of Bering, which for sollle reason was not appentle<l; thougll, in at least one of the other copies known, it is present. This copy was evidently prepared for use in Sweden. The Russian words mul names are (rather badly) transliterated into their supposed phonetic equh,alents in .Roman or Italic letters. Under explanatory remarks, thus transliterated, is a rendering of them in archaic Swedish. At the northwestern angle of Chukchi-laud is a legend stating that "this region is called Shelagin's." SheJagin was the Chukchi leader, who, shortly after Bering's expedition in 1730, defeated the Uussian forces in a pitched battle and killed Shestakoff, their commander. Sbelagin's uame is retained in modern maps !Jy the northernmost point of Siberia east from the Kolyma l{iver, Cape Shelaginski, sometimes shortened to Shelagskoi. The northern coast of Chukchi-land bas a note to the effect that "'This land is put down from older cllarts and information," so that for the erroneous extension northward of a part of it neither Bering uor .Miiiler are JJ1arnab1e. The high range of mountains along the eastern shore of Kamcliat;ka carries the following note: "On these mountains the snows lie in summer and winter, and from them there are violent squalls or gusts of wind." On the northern iiart of Kamchatka peninsula is written, "Here live tributary Kamchadals speaking several dialects." In the northern part of the Okhotsk Sea, beginning at the river Okhota, it is stated~ "From this river around to the river Krutogorova is put down from older cbarts and information." In the south-western part of the same sea, "This coast is according to older maps." At Cape Lopatka, here called Osnoi (which is a corruption of Osernoi in reference to the lake Oser, just behind it; or, more probably, of U zhnoi, meaning southern), it is noted this is tbe "south· ern poiut of the laucl of Kamchatka." Elsewhere ou the map arc phrases evidently derived from Bering's Report, as near Okhotsk, '' Hereabout:s live the trilmtary reindeer Tunguses," and "These hereabouts are Lamuts." Farther west" From tile 1frer Vitim and on the banks of the rivers [eastwarcll beyond live the so·<..~lled Yakuts arn:J. Tnngnses, who paj· tribute to the Russian Crown." 'l'ho whereabouts and religious state of various other tribes are indicated by similar inscrip· tions at various points on the western part of the map. 'l:his map measures 51 by 20~ inches between the neat lines. It is in black and white, the mountains washed iu, the only color being small green trees as a conventional sign for wooded

country. There is no name of draughtsman or place or 1late of making. The geographical part has been made with an ink which has turned brown with age. The ornamental escntcbeon was drawn by a different hand in anotller kind of iuk whicll bas retained itl'i eolol'. There aee t~ro manuscript maps in tbe Royal archiYes of Sweden of this gcueral elrnracter, which have been hriefly noticed by .E. Dahlgren.· They are more elegantly nnd profusely ornamented and differ slightly in names, and one has a number of souucliugs between St. Lawrence Island and the Diomede Islands. The~· are of the same size and douhtless were made at the same time as tlrn Klinckofotrom chart, bnt, being intended for au exalted personage, were mor<' highly ornamented. TLc geographical peculiarities of this, as compared with otller charts of the tirst yoyage of Bering, are discussed in the Xational Geographic :'.\iagazine (YoL. u, No. 2, 1890) as previously mentioned, and to that paper is referred Urn reader who desires fuller and more tecllnical details. It is only just to call attention to the liberality of Baron Klinckof.striim in permitting this val. uable relic to go heyond the seas for the information and accomrnodatiou of Ameriean students of geography, and to express for tl1is courtesy onr sineere gratitude.

NOTES ON THE ORIGINAL CHART BY WAXEL OF THE VOYAGE OF BERING IN 1741. fll111str11tion No. 10. J

Lieut. Sven \Vaxel, executive officer of Bering's vessel, was a Swede in the Hussian service. In June, 1741, he sailed from Avaeha Bay in the ship St. Peter. Later on in the voyage, as the scurvy with which they were scourged rednced the commander, Bering, to suul.t a state that he was obliged to take to his !Jed, \Vaxel practically commandeQ the vessel. After their return from the island. named after Bering, who died. and was buried upon it, \Va.xel was senior officer, and when the forces of i.he expedition were gathered at Tomsk in Siberia, where tl1ey remainetl until 1745, according to Lauridsen, Waxel for a time was in general command. The manuscript chart, of wl1ich the accompanying outline is a fa.cE-imile, is supposed. to have been made for \Vaxel's own use l.>y some draughtsman nnder his supervision, or from his own notes, RO that it represents what were to him the geographical rnsults of the >o;yage of the Bt. Peter. The results obtained by Chirikoff on the St. Paul, which early in the voyage became separated from the St. Peter, were of course different, and to some extent discrepant. 'l'he attempt to combine these two discrepant charts has made the charts of 1\fiiller and otherR muell more confused and confusing than either of t.hc odginals would have hcen separately. The opportunity of examining this valuable historical relic is due to the liberality of the authorities of the Uni\'ersity of Upsala, Sweden, of whose library it forms a part. By reproducing it we place in the hands of Rtudents another original rlocurnent which hithei·to bas been inaccessible, and the data of which were available only to such as were acquainted with the Russian language . .A part from its geographical interest, which will be considered preseu tl,r, this chart has another interest. It is well known to naturalists and those familiar with Alaskan history tllat the crew of Bering's vessel discovered on Bering Island, or living about its shores, an enormous species of manati or sea cow, which affonled excellent meat, and which was so hunted for food within a few years aft.erward that it soon became extinct, and is now known only by some morn or less imperfect skeletons and a dried fragment of its hide. This animal was descri-bed by Steller and is known as Steller's sea cow (Rhytina stelleri or giga.~). lt had a very tbick rongh skin marked by deep folds which enabled it to bend itself with more facility, and its posterior flippers wpre shape(] like the tail of a whale, more or less forked. Steller made a drawing of it which is known onl.Y by a copy, the original being lost, and the form of the tail has been in dispute owing to au alleged ambiguity in the original description, and the fact that some of the other tiea cows hase a rounded tail and not a. forked one. In the absence of Steller's original drawing of the northern sea cow, the sketch on this manuscript is probably the only existing protrait of that animal which was ever

seen by anyone who had seen the living animal itself. As it shows the forked tail, the question in regard to it"s shape is thereby settled beyoml controversy. There are also two fur seals very well portrayetl on the chart, aud the fact that these are drawn with remarkable fidelity to nature allows one to in fer that the portrait of the sea cow is not less faithful. The cxarniuation of the chart with regard to its geographical features snggests an answer to several questions which haYe hitherto been in controversy owing to the manner in which the charts of the voyage ha.Ye been confused together. In the first place, if this chart had been published separately, the confusion as to Bering's first anchorage on tlte American coast neecl never haYe arisen. Kaye Island, witlt Cape l\fartin opposite, in Controllers Bay, are perfectly reeognizab}{'. This was long ngo determi11e1l to he the case by Sokoloff', who publishe!l in the .Tonrnal of the Russian Bydrographic Department the sketch chart ma.de by Khitroff, "\Yaxel's mate, of the island and harbor. But this Jinblication is a rare and almost inaccessible book and the information was slow in sprea<ling. The expedition was prevented by fog or darkness from observing the passage north -of the Kacliak group, but a cape wltich is probably Cape Greville is represented b;y Waxel, and though not named on this drnrt is likely to be t bat mi med IIermogenes by the expedition. The identifica· tio11 of Cape 8t. Ilermogene.:< with l\larrnot Island made by Cook receives uo confirmation from this chart. The fictitious island of St. Stephen is absent from Waxel's chart, but the hau ks northeast from Ohirikoff l Uk.amok or :Foggy) falanfl are detailed with mauy soun<lings, and the ideutification of Foggy (Tumannoi or on tlus cha.rt Tomauo) Island with that now called Chirikoff Island is complete and can not he rf'aso11ably questioned any longer. The Semidi ishnds are in their proper place with .Aghiyuk l:;;land aud Uhigiuagak Volcauo uorthward from them. In this matter Sokoloff was right, as usual, in l1isjudgiuent of the question. The Sbumagin islands have beeu illcutified correctly from the beginning. This chart shows that the anchorages of the Ht. Peter were between Nagai aucl Little Koninslli, and that the unfortunats seaman for whom the grouv was named was probably buried on the eastern sicle of Nagai Thence westward is a Jong gap until we reltch the Yiciuit.y of the mountain named on the cllart St. John. Here the positions are so wil<l awl the islands so little characteristic that a guess is all tltat can be hazarded. The general circnmstarH·es suggest that this might be the high JJeak (about 6,000 feet) on tlie north Nal of A<lakh tslantl. Tlrn ''high snow-capped isla11d" named by tlie expedition St. l\larciau would then probably be tlie i8lan<l of Tauaga; it coul<l not be the island of Amchitka, as alleged by Lauridsen, since that it1 lo"~, flat, and without any peaks. Taking tlte relatiYe positions into account it is not improbable that the island next laid dowu, under the name of St. Steplteu, or St. Stepan, is intemled for Semi1wpochnoi, whiclL is·hi~·b a ml has several islets near it. St. Abraham, the last of the Aleutians seeu by them, is probably Kyska, tile 0111~~ island in that part of the chain with a smaller island close to its northeastern shore. The latitude of the vessel observed that day was 520 :n 1 , which is conformable with this supposition. The itlf'utiftcation of this with the Semichilo"I'-, rocky, islets is absurd, and would not ha Ye been macle by anyone familiar with the islands. Be1·ing fafaud and its surroundings are depicted in a manner to cause astonishment. There am scYeral nonexistent islets shown, an<l tile largest~ which ma_y Le meant for Copper Islandt is altogc)ther out of place, yet tile party were more than six months on Bering Island. The \'fant of discipline conse11ueut on the death of the comnrnnder, all{l the quarrels and illness among the officer;;, are proba!J1.v responsible for the eharacter of this part of the map. l !Jani assumed that tlw party on.the Et. Peta dill not see anything of the Nearer island,;, Attn, Agattu, etc. They appear, however, to haw1 been seen by Cltirikoff; and the attempt to identify what was sJen hy one party with different things seen b;y the other party has resulted in tlw eonfusion of l\ltiller's and other charts based on this ill-judged conglomeration. If the log hooks of the two vessels could be published verbatim many of these interesti11g historical problems might, by the aid of modern charts, be brought to a satisfactory solution. As it is, however, one must be satisfied with adding something to the stock of a.ccessible information, and with the hope th.at the remainder will be brought to light at some futu.re time.

:NOTES ON AN EARLY CHART OF LONG

ISLA~D

socsn AND ITS APPROACHES.

[Sullmitted for publication llfarc11 : ·. 1!'191.]

The recent discovery in the British Hecords Office, by Capt. Clinrles Hervey Townsht'ml, of New Haven, of an elaborate chart of the North American coast from Cape Uod to the Xavesink Hills, including Long Island Sound and approaches, has been deemed of suftlcicut importance to ·justify the publication of an accurately traC('U copy in this report. [ Illustratim1 No. 11.] Captain Townshend is of opinion from eYidencn afforded by the chart itsel:f; and by the copious notes it contains relatiYe to the coasts, sl1oals, aml passages embrn.ced within its limits, that it was constructed b;,T a 11ydrographical sur·ey party, composed of Hri:ish uaYal otllcers, between the yea.rs 1715 ancl 17'.m. There are, however, some indlcations tlt:<t parts of it 1rnd an origin from ~Oto 30 :years earlier. The geographical and historical va-lue of charts of tLis chara-ctcr has long lwPH admitted. For reference with regard to tbe early spelling of geographical name<', tile ide1ttification of localities, and the changes in topographical and hydrographical featares, they are worthy of careful study. From the full description of this old chart, which has becu communicated by Captain Townsheml to the Superintendent, the following abstract has beeu made for publication her1' :
The chart furnishe~ positive proof of the existence of one of the close<l p;cssages that. tra<1 it ion sa.H existed in early times through Cape Cod, and sustains the sta~ment of Capt. Ba.rtholomt>w Gosnold, in 1602, that CuJ>e CoJ ·was then an island. That one of these passages remained OJ)en as lat,e as 1717 is shown b;.T a marginal note on tl1e chart commenting on the loss of the pirate ship Whido, a.R follows: "Ye pla.ce where I ca.me through with a whale boat, being orJen>il by yo Governor to look niter Y" piratt' ship Whido, Bellamy commander, castaway Yll 2Gt1Hlf1y of A prll, 1717, wl><'re l bnrie1t ono h nndrod anll twu nwn dr<»n>e<L'" Rutch~nson's History ofMassachnsef<tR B:ty, volt1mP 2, page 2K~ . sta.tes that in tlrn tuonth of April, 171:', a pirnfo ship, Urn JYhido, of 23 guns and 130 men, Samuel Bellamy commander, ve11turcd upun the coast. of ~ew Englm1d, near Cape Cod, and after having taken se,·eral vessels seven of tho pirates were pnt on hoard of one of them, who soon got drnnk and went to sleep. The lll[t5ter of the vessel whieb Lad been taken. h:n·ing been left aboanl "·ith the J>rize crew, ran her ashore on the back of the cape, and tbe s;>.¥eu pirat,es were secured. Soon after the pil'ate ship, in a storm, was forced ashore near the tablc-l:intl, and the wlu1h· en'''" c>xccpt one Englishman au<l one Indian, were drowned. Six of tile prizo crew, whid1 wen· ;;aved as hcfore r:l<'ntioncd, upon trial by a special conrt ofadmi!'.alty, were pronounced guilty and exccut<·d at lloston, Nonm1l·<'r 1:-., 1717. The maiu passage used by small vessels, which i· here. showu, was pfain1s l.ai<i down tlJroug-li t lJc f,, 11·"'' of Eastham, Chatham, and Orleans, on Cape Cod. This p:tssage was mnch nn·<l in earl~- colonial times by small Y1's8els and boats when making voyages from the bay of Maine to Virginia. It is showu on t.be t'atly Dntch ;rnd Frnneli charts, a.nd on thtil oue sketched by Schipper A1lriau Bl'lok, iu 1614, and this may h:in:i l>eeu the passagn urnntiDnetl h~· Capt. Thomas Denner, in 16HI, whfln he wa.~ making his boat voyage from :Mona11igga.n r ;',bin1>\ to Yirginia. It is inten·sting also to note that ill this very passage, in a salt marsh, has lately llcen disco>·cred th» rnmi;i n~ of an aucien t ship, which was exhumed by the action of the sea May 6, 1~6:3. It la.y within the l:rndR uf what is now the town nf Orlen.us.

"This officer was probably Ca.ptain Cypiau Southack, a Boston pilot, who commaude1l a ship iu the cxpeditiou against: Quebec, 1690. On his return, September 16, 1G90, to Bosbon, he saved South Church from tlie tlames.

UNITED STATES COAST AND GEODETIC SUUVEY.

These voyages, with the well-susta.iued tradition handed down to us from the Eaton and Davenport settlers, who came to Quinnipiac in 1637-'31', after a voyage of 14 <lays in boats via a passage aero~ Cape Coil, a.nil the fact of the return of Rev. Ezekiel Rogers from Qninnipiac to Rowley, Mass., the next year, in a pinnace which he sent to fetch them, is abundant proof to me of the then existence of this passage, or others, and the investigations of the late Professor AgaS11iz give also conclusive evidence thereof. The:;e memorable passages were closed up, as I have b<ien tol<l by Capt. '\Villia.m Foster of Brewster, Mass., abont 150 J ears a.go, during a f11rious gale of wind, which waR accompanied by a tidal wave. This herculean effort of the elements changed the whole east and south shore of the Cape, and deposited in the salt marshes and lowlands sanu hills sixty feet high, and completely washed away a s:uid point off Nauset, where to thi~ da.v, at extreme low tidelil, atnmp!l of former trees have been laid 1.Jare, which hr1\'e been seen by men now Jiving who visited the spot for that purpose.

Ikfore following tbe navigable approach to Long Island Souud, as shown on this c.:hart, through the waters of Nantuc.:ket aud Uarthas Viue,yanl Sound and the "Sea of Rhoad Jsland," brief mention may be made of the follo\\ing facts: (1) That the Hos(i and Crown Shoal, then (1717) marked "dry," has at this !late (1891) 12 feet of water m·er it, and (2) that the islands of Nantucket and ::\farthas Vineyard are on this chart i,;hown as six islands, an illustration of tbe action of tlle sea during the past two centuries in moulding the shore. Aeross the east entrance to Long Island Sound are giYeu the names of numerous islands, viz: Fisher's Island, Gull Island, and Plum Island, forming with sunken reefs a continuous chain.
The site of the Pequot fort, now in the town of Groton, and marked with the Mason monument, is called J"anthorn HiU, and New London is here mentioned as follows: "A small river, brrt with a good liarbur and farms; navigable for ships and small vessels; a place of great trade; they build many ;-essels here.'' Pine Island oft' the east point, and Bartlett's Reef off the west point of tho harbor, are located, with the mention of tide, full and change of the moon at 10 o'clock, souuding outside 25 fathoms of Blue Owse. Hereat '\Vinthrop Point, is gi vcn a sketch of Governor Winthrop's ho11se, and the Governor's name is noted ; also a church and several houses. The Connecticut River is mentioned as being a very long river, and having a great many fine towns and farms on the sev<>ral branches of it, and as being navigable for small ··essels. On the chart is added: "Ye seaboard town to the ri\·cr is Shorbrook (Saybrook). They build a great many small vessels here, and much copper om rninerl.'' The Long Island towns are also carefully located, and Peconfo Bay, about tlrn site of River Head, is noted. Here itie writton: "1 commanded ye first ship that ever was in this place, in 1692,'' and as seYeral anchorages are marked in thi· backwater, and a canoe "place" or portage is marked down between this, through the south beach to the ocean west of Shinnicook, it is quite probable that at this date there existed a boat passage which was usetl by Colonel Meigs during tho Revolutionary war, when he captur;id Sag Harbor with au expedition fitted out from New Haven and returned without losing a man. Gnilford and Branford, on the Connecticut shore, are mentioned as having small river11 a.ud goon farms, an<l both noted as having chnrches.· These towns, it is added, lie n(lrth of the "Sea of Connecticut," with the Hundred Islands (Thimbles) and Falcon's (F'aulk:ner's) Islands off the coast. The ironworks at Stony River, East Haven, have a special mention and are shown as being on a considerable Tiver, and as this was the third ironworks an<l l>loomery in America., it was then considered of much note. It will be perhaps of interest to state here that I have collected a mass of original material concerning these ironworks, which will at a later date be published. The ironmaster(Jobn Coopor or Cowper's) house (stone built), in old English style, is still standing in a good state of preservation on the west bank of Stony River, near the stone bridge. This, with the overflowing milldam and red gristmill nearby, imbedded in a greenfoliag<'l during the summer, backed by the brown· faced evergreen Saltonstall mountains, while in tho distance appears the graceful spire of East Haven stone meetinghouse, with other Rcenery, rewards excursionists for the eJl'ort made to visit one of the most picturesque and pretty bits of landscape in this section of the country. Bnt we must not tarry here at this secluded spot, but push on to the more pretentious harbor of the Qninnipiac (or New Haven of our day). Here laid down on the chart is noted tlrn time of high water, 9 o'clock on the full and change of the moon, and opposite the harbor, which is only sketched as the entrance of a small river g11ar<le1l by a rocky channel, wi~h soundings 10 fathoms off its entrance, it says (in th-0 noteB) there are many govd farm11. It is ehown on the chart as having a pretentious church, and several houses are sketched, giving an air of importance to the vicinity. t ·-·-- - - - - - - - · - - - - - - - · ·And here Sa,chem'" Head, which was the scone of a tragedy when Uncas, chief of the Mohigans, captured a pursued Pt1qnot s:10hem, :mil, after shooting him to death with arrows, cnt off his head, which was set in the crotch of an oak tree and remained for years after the tree had growu, holding it thereto.

Directly ;i,eross the sound from our harbor on Long Island is noted the village of 'Ve,ding (now Watling lfrYCr), so called as it is navigable for boats, which can he towed inside by wading the river. The uotto:n of the sound is blue owse, depth 20 to 25 fathoms, anti the tide runs full 13;ea at 1 o'clock. Milford, Stratford, arnl Fairfield are all located as good faTrns, wliile the islands off the Housatonic River and locatell by Block iu 1Cl4, are marked saml bankB, and a.re now waslied away save the dan~erous remnant known as Stratford shoals. whid1 liaq lS fat!1orns cloec to [new chart 27 fathomAJ. This clemands more than easnal mention, as they with Faulkner's IBlan<l, illnatrate the powerful effect of the wind and ticlal force on tlrn shore of tllis arm of the sea, as has l1ec·n )J(:foru rcnrnrkctl. Proof positive is still extant of my theory <>f the dispersion of the islands of the souurl, aml tLe late Captain Moore, a noted shipbuilder of Brid,;oport, Conn., informed me that he had ·>ioiiod Stratford shoals e:arly in t:Lis century at low tide for shellfish, and had ohserw~<l sedge and other marine grasses growing there, and had a\,;o examinc>d walking sticks alltl canes cnt from groYc or scrnh cedars which stood on this islarnl allont i:in yearn ago. The canes are still jn the possf·ssion of some of the residents of the neighbol'l1ood of Port Jctfor~on, Len~ folan<l. I l1ave lrnen told by Mr. James Park, pun"r of the steamer -Yonowan 1'1'c l)f the Port .Jefferson arnl Ilridgcport routP, :rn<l wlio was ten years master of the i'itratford light-ship; that in 1860 Captain Kuinis of Port .J pfforRou, Long Is1and, tl1en about 75 years of age, to1d him he had cut rushes ou Stratfort1 shoal grounds. There is also a tradition to the same effect from Stratford towns from people who had the ownership of lands of these islands, anll Capt. Joel Stone informeu me that the Stratford light-ship keeper fold him he had walked 40 yards on Stratford shoal when laid ham at extreme low spring tide, which occurred during a continuous weRt gale in the month of l\fard1. Mr. Henry X. Beardsley, of Bridgeport, writes that his father has seen Stratford shoal gronnu often bare for six rous. The i;ite of Penfield reef and bar in 1720, called Lewis I:.Iaml, now marJ.:ell with a light-house, off Dlack Rock and Fairfield, is shown as a continuous rocky cllain, and served to locate the most eastern island of t11c archipelago (Norwalk Island) of the first explorer, and tltere is still at low tide a long l1are sand 1>pit which connectA the Jand. Could this or Charles Island, Milford, have been the "m:uriagP point" rccommernled by Captain Davenport to Governor Winthrop for settlement after the recent conquest, 1U37? Opposite, on Loug Island, art" designated the two points, Eaton and Lloyd, ouee part of the estates of Gov. Theophilus Eatou and his kinspeople, the Lloyds. Here Long Island is mentioned as lmving "iine towns on it, and on the west end many good farms, but towards the east end is much barren land, though there are some places where there are good farms." :M e.ntion is also made of Huntington, Oyster Day, Whitestone, an<l Flushing, on the Island shore ; also Greenwich, Mamaroneck, East and Westchester, on the continent, which terminates at Manhattan lslan<l; also ther<i is given a desCl·iption of this a.rm of the sea and its shores at the entrance of the "Inferno" of the Dutch, and in full view of "Hell Gate," the terror of ancient mariners. Ha.-ing com1lleted the. description of this ancient cha.rt, savo 1.irief mention of some of the most western Long Island towns laid down thereon, viz, Jericho, Jamaica, Bedford, and Gravesend, also numcruus small inlets for "yo llmall 'i'essela on ye north side" and IL ferry from the now site of Brooklyn to Manhattan Island, Sf\parated from" ye main by ye Spyten Divil Creek" [or Harlem River], there remains only to make mention of the meetin:.:- of tlie tides of the East and North [or Hudson] Rivers, and at their junction at Nntting [or Governors] Island connected to Long Island at low -water with a narrow sand spit, oycr which within the past 100 yea.rs cows were driven at low tide to pasture from LQng Island to Governors Is1and, and through which a channel has now been forced (by the encroachment by docks on East River), and now known as" Buttermilk Channel." Here at the meeting of these waters off the Battery of oar day are shown tho magnificent upper and lower harbors of New York, and southward Staten Island and Sandy Hook, and still farther in the distauce> tho waters of the broad Atlantic.
