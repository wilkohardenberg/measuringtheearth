REPORT.
Co.AST SuRVJW STATION, CooPER, WARRINGTON COUNTY, MAINE,

September 23, 1859. Sm: In compliance with the law· of 1853, and with the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to present my report on the progress of the Coast Survey of the United States during the surveying year, from November I, 1858, to November 1, 1859. As the seale of the work, depending upon the amount of the appropriation made for its progress, is the same this year as the last, the report will go O\"er nearly the same extent of ground as the former one. A general view of the progress from the real commencement in 1832, to the present time, is shown in a map prepared for the purpose, (Sketch No. 36,) and will presently be referred to particularly. The survey has again been in progress in its land work, hydrography, or office work, in the twenty-two seaboard States, and Territories of the United States, in which it is not essentially completed. I propose to retain the same divisions in the present report as in those immediately preceding it, namely, the introduction, the description of operations, and the Appendix. I. The introduction discusses briefly the progress of the work under separate heads and gives the estimated progress for the next year, and the means necessary to secure it, thus bringing together the work done and the appropriation required for that amount of progress. II. In the second part a detailed account is given under the head of sections, arranged geographically, of the field, hydrographic, and office work done during the year. The sections are numbered from one, beginning at the northeastern boundary, to nine, terminating with the southern line of Texas, and including the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States. Sections ten and eleven, including the western coast, begin at San Diego, and terminate at the forty-ninth parallel of latitude. Under each bead the work is described in the general order of its execution, as 1. Triangulation; 2. Topograph:·; 3. Hydrography, with statistics of the several operations, and other particulars relating to the work. Each chapter is prefaced by a brief reference to the progress m:.>de in the sections, and by a statement of the office work pertaining to it. III. The Appendix contains information useful to navigators, commercial men, surveyors, and men of science, with such lists and papers relating to the work as could not conveniently be introduced into the body of the report. It is subdivided, for purposes of ready reference, into the following beads: 1. Field, hydrographic, and qffice details, embracing general lists of the parties and their occupation as distributed along the coast; the names of officers of the army and navy attached to the work; data furnished from the archives in reply to applications made within the year; the statistics of field and office work; a list of surveys made on the Western Coasti the developments made in the course of the regular hydrography; tide tables

IlEPORT OF THE SCPERINTE::\DEXT OF

for navigators, and a table of the depths at important port entrances on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Western Coast; detailed reports of work performed in the office divisions; lists of the topographical and hydrographical sheets regi;;tercd within the last two years; and lists of the geographical positions furnished by data received from the field "·ithin the same period. 2. Special operations and scientffic discussions relating to magnetism, tides, and currents. 3. Local surveys, comprisiug descriptions of special localities, their topographical features, and their resources. 4. ll:fiscellaneous scientific matters relating to methods and instruments. 5. Uori-espondence incidental, to the operatirms q( the snrvey. 6. Light-hmise matters referred to the Board for c011sideration. The first part of the introduction shows the progress ancl gives the estimates for the next year's progress. The last conta1ns remarks upon work done, and especially upon the parts which are not referred to in the body of the report.
GEOGRAPHICAL SECTIONS-ESTIMATES OF PROGRESS AND COMPLETION.

In my report for 1857 I estimated the time of completion of the work on the Atlantic and Gulf at from ten to twelve years, estimating upon the "present resources and regular rate of progress,'' and showed how this could be accomplished by the same resources frum the direct estimates and the aid derived from the Navy, War, and Interior Departments. In my next report I stated that "the available means from different sources for this last fiscal year, (1858-' 59,) were ninety thousand dollars less than for the former," (1857-' 58.) "These appropriations were less by $30, 000 than those for the previous year, 1857-' 58, besides which, no appropriation was asked by the Interior Depa.r~ment for the sur>ey and marking of the Florida keys, and of the islands off the Western Coast, ma.king a diminution of $90, 000 in the available means for the progress of the survey in 1858-' 59. '' The portion of this reduction which fell upon the field and office work of the Atlantic and Gulf sections was $40, 000, being about eleven per cent., or more than one-tentl1, requiring an increase of rather more than one year in ten, in the estimated time of completion. It is not to be expected that this decrease will show itself iu a marked way in two yea.rs, except in those sections which have suffered most from it, but I cannot be responsible for it when it does appear. I have carefully i·evised the estimates of progress and completion presented in my report of 1856-' 57, and, adopting the same order of discussion as given in that report, now proceed to give the results, which will be found in accordance with the statements then made. SECTION I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith, including the coast qf the States qf Maine, New Harnp.~hire, Massachusetts, and Rlwde Island.-The primary triangulation is carried to the northeastern boundary of the United States, requiring merely the occupation of certain stations passed by in order to advance the coast work, to complete the original scheme from Point Judith (Rhode Island) to the limits of Maine. Three secondary triangulation parties will nnish the triangulation in six years, and the progress will show whether this is the best course, or to press on the topography, employing only occasionally a third triangulation party, so as to complete the triangulation in seven and a half to eight years. The completion of the primary work of this section will give means from the estimates to furnish the additional topographical parties needed to keep fully up with the secondary triangulation. Two hydrographic parties with steam vessels and one with a sailing vessel will keep the hydrography close upon the triangulation and topography. The progress made this season shows that there will be no difficulty in this respect.

Allowing a margin of two years brings us to the estimate of my report for 1856-' 57, namely, "ten to twelve years" from that date, or eight to ten from this, even without the additional year already referred to. A map has been marked off with the limits of average progress, as determined by the statistic;; of the survey, to be expected in the triangulation of this part of the coast, and will enable me to regulate the progress accordingly. In two years the same may be done for the topography and hydrograpby. SECTION IL From Point Judith to Cape Henlopen, including the coast ctf Connecticut, .Neic York, New Jersey, Penn11ylvania, and part of Delaware.-The parties which, from time to time, can be. spared to work upon the rivers of this section and upon revision, will easily bring to a clo8e the small portion of outstanding work within the time estimated for the completion of the other sections. SECTIOX III. From Cape. Henlopen to Cape, Henry, including the coast ef part of Delaware, and the coast of Maryland and part qf Virginia.-The remaining work in this section, which is small, compared with that already executed, between one and two t-enths, is provided for in the estimates and steadily advancing. It will easily be completed Kitl1in the time named for the other sections. SECTION IV. From Ca.pe Beiff'J/ to Cape Fear, hicluding part qf the coast qf Virginia and North Oarolina.-The primary triangulation of Pamplico sound and its rivers, not commenced at the date of my report of 1856-' 57, has had one season's work llpo11 it, and will regularly ad,·ance to its completion. The parties are provided which will bring all the work of this section to a close within the time estimated for section I, and that without burdening other parts of the survey. The plans for prospective operations are quite matured. SECTION V. From Cape Fear to the St. Mary's river, inducling pa.rt qf the coast ef North Carolina and the coast qf South Carnlina ancl Georgia.-The same numLer of parties should be kept in this section for another year as heretofore, after which one or more can be spared for other work, and yet complete the section in the time required for section I. Two secondary triangulation parties would complete that work in five years. The question of the character of the primary work, and of bases of verification, will be settled, probably, in another year, certainly in two. The hydrograp11y of the section is well advanced, the ocean part of it especially.
SECTION

VI. From St. Mary's river to St. Joseph's bay, including the eastern and western

C()(J,8fs

qf the peninsula qf Florida, and the Florida reefs and keys.-The expedient of a line across the head of the peninsula, by which the triangulations of the .Atlantic and Gulf coasts will be connected, changes essentially the character of the triangulation necessary around the peninsula, and alone renders possible the completion of this section within the time required for section I. In fact, it will require great exertion and steady execution of plans to succeed in this. Three triangulation parties on the eastern side, and two on the western, will be required to make this sure. I rely upon parties available after two years, from other sections, to bring up any arrears which we may find in the section; but it may be most prudent to add a year to my estimate of 1857, and to make it eight to nine years from the present date, which is the same limit as of section I. The topography keeps well up with the triangulation, and so does the hydrography, the reef being nearly completed, so that the time of completion of this section may be safely estimated as not greater than for section I. The reduction of thirty thousand dollars, furni8hed

4

HEPORT OF THE SUPERINTEXDEXT OF

by the Interior Department for the Land Office surveys prior to 1858 foll heavily upon this section.
SECTIOX YII. From St. Joseph's bay to 11Iobile bay, inclMding part qf the coast ef Florida and the coast qf Alabama.-Of this section I stated in my report for 1857 as follows: "This was the last section commenced, and it is perhaps between one-sixth and one-fifth done. It will require additional force to put it through in ten to twelve years. This may probably be had as the Atlantic f-!ections require fewer parties to. bring them to a close; but I cannot foresee positively yet. Good progress has been made since we commenced this work, in 1852, add there are three centres of operation-near Pensacola, near Apalachicola and St. Mark's, and near Ccd·1r Keys. If we had means to employ a steam vessel here ·throughout the season there would be no doubt of the completion of this section with the others." I shall make a strong effort to procure an additional hydrographic party for section IX, so that the steam ve:.;sel available for this section shall be constantly employed here. No effort shall be spared to bring the section up to the others in its progres,;. The reduction of the appropriation has preveuted the supply of an additional party during the last two ,years. SECTION VIII. From Mobil,e bay to Vermilion bay, including the coast qf Mississippi and of part of Louiliiana.-The work in this section makes steady progress, and the topogrnphy is kept close to the triangulation, being, in fact, connected with it generally. Vl'ith the force now~ in the section it will not be difficult to finish the triangulation, as estimated in 1856-' 57, in eight years from this present date, and to complete the work at the same time with section I. As remarked in my report for 1856-' 57, no one of the parties at work here can be spared for other sections, if this one is to be completed within the time estimated. SECTION IX. Frnm Vermilion bay to the southwestern boundary, including part qf the coast qf Lou·isiana, and the coast qf Texa8.-ln my former report I supposed that additional force wo11ld be required to complete this section in time, and I am now sure of it. It may lag behind the other Gulf sections, unless means a.re furnished to push it onward. My notes show that I had intended t.o furnish another triangulation party to the section, had means sufficient been available, two years ago. WESTERN CO.A.ST.

X AND XI. From San Diego to the forty-ninth parallel, including the coast qf California and Oregon, and that qf Washington Territory.-It would be premature to attempt to estimate
SECTIONS

for the completion of this work, only commenced in 1850. The progress has been quite satisfactory, considering that the appropriation only provides for two triangulations, two topographical parties, another for triangulation and topography, and one hydrographic party. The harbors of this important coast have been surveyed, except those of Washington Territory, only a part of which are yet completed; and, besides a general reconnaissance, and the important work connected with the northwestern boundary between the United States and Great Britain, the general hydrography has been steadily prosecuted.
GENERAL STATEMENT OF PROGRESS.

The survey on the Atlantic and Gulf coast is nearly two-thirds done, and with the means appropriated for 1857-' 58 can be finished, as then stated, in from ten to twelve years from that <late. The revision of my estimates of time has, as already stated, confirmed this conclusion; and, at the present diminished rate of appropriation, we shall probably fall but one year behind

THE F'.'\1T:ED STATF.R COART RCUYEY.

that period, if the present system is strictly persevered in to the close. In my report oi' lm;t year I frankly stated the difficulticii of accomplishing this result, and the circumstances under which alone I deemed it practicable. I would merely call attention to these, that I may incur no responsibility not properly belonging to such an arduous task. I propose now to state, in the most brief form, the general progress of the survey. It will be seen, by reference to the general progress sketch, (No. 36.) that the triangulation of the Atlantic coast is continuous from the northeastern boundary of the United States to Little riYer, near the boundary between North and South Carlina, an extent of more than twelve huudred miles measured from point to point, and a proportional part of tlie whole Atlantic coast of two-thirds, as estimated in the same T·:a:_r, or of three-fourths as estimated by shore-line. I do not mean to say that the work is complete between these limits, because the secondary triangulation in some portions, and the primary iu others, is not complete; but the work is a connected one, and as such is available for preliminary purposes. With an interval of but sixty miles, it is again connected to St. Simon's entrance, on the coast of Georgia, two hundred and h\·enty miles, leaving an interval of about thirty miles to the St. Mary's. From the St. John's it is nearly complete (with an interval of but eight miles) to Matanzas river, (St. Augustine.) T1rn parties will probably be at work this wintef, advancing towards each other, from St. Augustine south and from Indian River in]et north; and, as soon HR the appropriation will admit, a third will be p]aced here, to proceed from Indian river s,)uthward. In the aggregate, the secondary trimigulution of about seven-eighths of the Atlantic coast iR completed. From Cape Florida to the Marquesas the triangulation is continuous one hundred aud seventy miles, and one or two seasons more will finish the intricate work of the inner ke.n· :rnd coa1<t of Florida bay. The triangulation of Charlotte harbor is nearly completed; that of the Gulf coast extends from Chassaho1vitzka river to Cedar Keye-fifty miles; over Ocilla emrauce; then from St. Mark's, beyond Apalachicola, to Indian Pass; over St. Andrew's bay; tl1en from the middle of Santa Rosa sound to Pensacola entrance, including also Pensacola bay and its principal dependencies; from Mobile entrance, and up Mobile bay (westward) to Point Fortuna, in Isle au Breton sound, one hundred and thirty miles, and through Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain, to New Orleam;; over Bay Rondo and the passes of the Mississippi, and over Isle Derniere and Caillou bay; over .Atchafalaya and East Cote Blanche bays; from East bay, (Galveston,) southward and westward, over Matiigor<la and .Aransas bays and tlJeir dependencies, one hundred and ninety miles, to A.ransas Pass, which is about a hundred :md forty miles from our southeastern boundary. The topography and hydrography based upon these triangulations have kept close pace with them, in some of the sections requiring the communication of results by the triangulation parties to the topographical parties, and in others by both triangulation and topographical parties directly to the hydrographic parties as soon as completed in the field. The harbors of the Western seacoast of the United States, and many of the more important ones in the vast navigable sounds of the Pacific coast, have been surveyed, and the general triangulation from San Francisco as one centre and Santa Barbara as another, over Columbia river, in Oregon, in Washington sound and its dependencies, the Straits of Haro and Rosario and the islands between, to the northwestern boundary and southward into Puget's Sound, have been ateadily pushed forward, and the topography and hydrography have followed closely. The astronomical work has been kept up along the whole coast, as far as the progress of the

6

REPORT OF THE SGPERINTENDEKT OF

other operations rendered advisable. The latitudes and longitudes of the headlands on both coasts have been determined, and, with the intermediate stations, these make a total of seven t110usand one hundred and seventy-eight points of which the geographical positions have been computed. Preliminary determinations of longitude from Europe have been made by the best methods known to science. The telegraphic method of longitudes, perfected in connexion with the survey, has enabled us to connect the distant points-Calais, in Maine, and New Orleans, in Louisiana-with a certainty hitherto impossible. 1 aru satisfied that a few signals by telegrap11 from America to Europe will enable us to determine the difference of longitude with a degree of accuracy which neither long-continued astronomical ob!'-ervations nor the transportation of d1ronometers have yet reached, or can ever reach. This is one of the works specially enjoined upon the Coast Survey by the plan of reorgauization, and to which unvarying attention has been directed from the dcite of that plan until tLe present time. The tide tables for navigators (Appendix No. 14) have been further revised for determining, by simple rules, the times and heights of high and low water in our different ports. The magnetic elements, so important to the navigator and surveyor, have been further determined, and the tables now contain the result~ of observations made at over two hundred stations on all parts of the coast. No lesi,; than three hundred and thirteen charts or sketches of harbors, inlets, shoals, sounds, bays, &c., have been drawn, engraved, and published, founded upon the land and hydrographic work of the survey.
PROGRE:SS FROM NOVEMBER 1858 TO NOVEMBER 1859.

The first table in the Appendix (No. 1) shows the distribution of the parties along the coast in the different sections, the officers employed, and the general limits of the work executed. A map of each section shows the work in some detail, and with convenient signs to denote the tmveral operations. I give in this connexion a condensed account of the progress made in the field and office work, subdivided according to the eleven geographical sections of the isurvey. SECTTON I. Coast ef .Jfaine, New Hampsliire, Massacliusetts, and Rhode Island.-( Sketches .A and .A bis, Nos. 1 and 2.)-The primary triangulation has been extended to the northeastern boundary of the United States, Howard mountain, near Machias, and Western Ridge, Cooper, Maine, having been occupied during the season. Observations for latitude and azimuth, and for the magnetic elements, have been made at the same stations, and the baee on Epping Plain has been connected with the general triangulation. Chamcook has been occupied for the triangulation of PassamaquoddJ-· bay and the St. Croix. The secondary triangulation has been continued in Penobscot bay, and connected with that extending southward and westward, over Muscongus bay, to Damariscotta river. The topography of Wiscasset bay has been completed, and progres8 made in that of Sheepscot river. The plane table survey of the Kennebec river and Merrymeeting bay has been nearly completed, and that of Casco bay has been extended eastward nearly to Harpswell. That of Cape Cod bay has been extended ea'lt and west, including the shores of Barnstable harbor, Mass., and verification of the topography done in the section is now in prog;ess. The hydrography has been extended from Cape Newaggen and Damiscove island to Cape Small Point, outside of Kennebec entrance, and soundings have been made in Casco bay to join with former work abreast of and between Portland light and Green island.

The in-shore hydrography has been extended from Cape Elizabeth to Kennelrnnkport, l\fe., and soundings have been made between the Isles of Shoals, N. H. Deep-sea lines have been run from Cape Ann, across Cashe's Ledge, to Seal island, N. S., and thence by traverses to Machias, :Mount Desert rock, Matinicus, and l\fanhegan island, to Portland entrance; and from Cape Elizabeth (southward) to :Nausett Centre light, Cape Cod. The off-shore hydrography has been continued off the coast of Massachusetts. Revision work has been done in Salem aud Hyannis harbors, and work for the examination of changes in parts of Boston harbor. Special magnetic observations have been made at Portland, Me., Portsmouth, N. H., and at several stations on Cape Ann, Mass. The tidal obE<ervations at Boston have been continued, aud a tidal station has been established at Eastport, l\fe. Experiments with a new pressure tidegauge have been made at Charle8towu, Mass. The drawing and engraving of additions to the chart of Boston harbor have been completed, as also the drawing of those of Portland harbor, Lynn harbor, and a new edition of that of Muskeget channel; and the engraving of the preliminary charts of Kennebec river and Rockport harbor.

SECTION II. Coast ef Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and part qf Delaware.(Sketch B, No. 7.)-The triangulation of the Hudson river has been extended from Hudson northward, to connect with the work from .Albany southward, at New Baltimore, and additional points have been determined near Yonkers. The topography of the Hudson has been continued, with intervals, north from the former limit to near Sing Sing on the eastern shore, and to Rock mountain on the western shore, including the delineation of the Palisades; that of Harlem river has been completed, and that of Long island, back of Brooklyn and Williamsburg, and in the vicinity of South Jamaica, has been :filled in. The outlines of the new piers at Sand Point and Great N eek have been traced. The hydrography of the Hudson river has been in progress from Newburgh north to Poughkeepsie. A resurvey has been made of the shore off the Battery, New York city, for changes. Magnetic stations have been occupied at Hartford, Conn.; Springfield, Chesterfield, and Deerfield, Mass.; and at Rutland, Vt.; and minute current observations have been made off the western end of Long Island. Tidal observations have been continued at Brooklyn. Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of coast map and chart No. 22, New York bay and harbor, and in the drawing of the map of Hudson river, from its entrance to Sing Sing. New plates of the middle and eastern parts of the chart of Long Island Sound have been engraved, and the old plate of the chart of Captain's it!lands, East and West, has been re-engraved.

MAPS .A.ND CHARTS.

A series of projects of maps and charts, on suitable scales, has been prepared, for which the work now affords materials on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. The projects for coast maps and charts on the scale of 80·1nio· as described in my report of last year, are one hundred and thirteen in number, embracing forty-two connected series. Those for the set of general coast charts, on the scale of "iTo.1000, are sixteen in number; and for a set of preliminary charts, on the scale of roi"oTo· the projects are thirty-three in number. The preliminary charts, with preliminary editions of harbor and other maps and charts, enable us to keep up with the work of each year. The electrotype process is especially valuable in enabling us to carry on this work without loss of the previous portions of the engraving. The application of photography, which is very far advanced, is making great changes in the facilities for reducing maps and charts. In another place I will present, at more length, a statement of our progress in this application. Sixty-seven sheets have been worked upon in the drawing division within the past year. Of this number, two are finished charts, twenty-three finished maps and charts, thirteen finished maps, six preliminary charts, two comparative charts, nineteen sketches, and two sheets of diagrams. Thirty sheets have been completed and thirty-seven am in progress. Of those completed, four are finished maps, three preliminary charts, two comparative charts, nineteen sketches, including those showing field progress, and two sheets of diagrams. In the engraving division, five first-class maps and new editions of three have been completed during the year, and twenty-one have been in progress. Of these last, eleven were commenced in former years and ten in the present year. Eleven second-class maps or charts and sketches have been completed within the year, nine of which were begun in the present year, and six of the same class are in progress. These, with five plates of diagrams, give a. total of twenty-four completed and thirty-two in progress, or of fifty-six plates engraved or engraving within the year. In addition to those engraved upon copper, five charts and sketches have been engraved upon stone, under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Printing. The complete list, giving the titles of the maps and charts, will be found in Appendix No. 17. The general list of all the ma11s, charts, and sketches engraved up to the present date also accompanies the same Appendix. It includes two hundred and ninety-nine titles, of which sixty are first-class maps. The list is exclusive of twenty progress sketches which have been engraved, and receive additions from year to year, as the field-work advances. The following list contains the titles of maps and charts, finished and preliwinary, and of sketches and diagrams, accompanying this report, arranged geographically. The letters in the margin refer to the different sections; .A. to Section I, B to Section II, and so ou. The

use, and yet useful for the purposes of the office. I believe that this may be accomplished for the next report, a plan which meets my approval having been finally hit upon after much experimenting. The application of photography to the regular reduction of our maps and charts has made good progress. It is estimated that the cost of reducing one of our sea-coast charts by photography is but about one-fourth of that by the pencil and pen. The questions yet unsolved in this application are merely questions of detail, and it is to be considered as one of the processes fully applicable to the reduction of our maps and charts for engraving, no important difficulty in relation to which remains to be mastered. The report of the assistant in charge of the office, and of George Mathiot, esq., in charge of the photographic operations, give many important particulars in this matter, (Appendix No. 17.) Prints have been produced of reduced maps in which the severest tests could detect no error beyond the tolerated limits. Mr. Mathiot is of opinion that we can profitably publish many of our preliminary maps by the photographic process without engraving at all, by issuing copies of the photographic prints themselves. Experiments will be made upon this at the earliest date practicable. The operation of putting the print of the reduced map directly upon the copper, so as to avoid an intermediate tracing by the erigraver, those of photo-lithography, and others, are in the course of experiment. Some successful trials have been made of photographing microscopic objects from the specimens of bottom of the sea collected in sounding.
ESTIMATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1860-'61.

The estimates are in the usual form which attaches the work to be done, to the expenditure necessary to accomplish it, and so indicates the rate at which the survey is to be prosecuted, a larger expenditure being required to finish the work sooner, a smaller decreasing the work to be done, and therefore involving the time of completion. I have already, in last year's report, called attention to the fact that the entire appropriation for the fiscal year 1857-' 58, exceeded by $90,000 (including the means furnished by the Land Office) that of the fiscal year 1858-' 59, which was the same as that of 1859-' 60, the item for the pay of engineers being introduced on the withdrawal of naval engineers from the work. As it is absolutely essential in such a work to have latitude in regard to the details of progress of operations in order to conduct it efficiently, the sums assigned for the several sections are joined in the acts of appropriation into one, allowing to the Treasui-y Department, which controls by law the direction for the work, and under which the Superintendent acts, discretion in details, and merely confining the separate expenditures to the great divisions of the work, as the Atlantic aud Gulf Coast; the Florida Coast, reefs, and keys; and the Weatern Coast. The whole of the expenditures for field and office work, including the pay of the civilians employed, is brought into these estimates. They include the expense of deducing the results, and drawing and engraving the maps, as well as of the surveys in the field. These estimates suppose the same aid from the War and Navy Departments as heretofore. Should any part of this be withheld, the proportionate progress of the survey must of necessity be diminished. The estimates were reduced in 1857-' 58, during the great stress upon the treasury, and have not since been raised to their former level. This involves a less rapid completion of the work than the former rate, but in the uncertainty in regard to the means for the fiscal year, I have not ventured to recommend an increase. The several items now presented are the same

14

in amount as have twice met the approval of Congress. An additional item, as compared with the last two years, for fuel and quarters for officers of the army serving on the work, is to pay the emolument derived by law and no longer paid by the Quartermaster's Department from the general appropriation for fuel and quarters of the army. It is not a new item, but is intended to replace the balance of a former appropriation which permitted its omission in the estimates of last year and the year before, during the straightened condition of the treasury. This balance is now exhausted. The assistant in charge of the work across the Florida line, Captain M. L. Smith, U. 'S. Topographical Engineers, advises me that the cost may be greater than was originally estimated by the officer who made the reconnaissance. I have, however, preferred to extend the time for completing the work rather than to ask an increase of the item for its execution. Even if Captain Smith's present estimate should be exceeded, the cost, of the work will not reach one-fourth that of a continuous main triangulation around the coast, such as would be needed to connect the main work on the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. No item of the estimates has been increased. That for the Wes tern Coast has proved sufficient to keep the mmal number of parties there in consequence of the work executed under the law for the Northwestern Boundary Commission.

DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCOVERIES.

The general list, up to 1858, inclnBive, is given in Appendix No. 8, and contains one hundred and sixty-one references to matters geographically arranged. My attention having been called by Geo. W. Blunt, csq., to the alleged grounding of a vessel on the Battery shoal, where it had been supposed there was water enough to float her, a re-examination of the shoal was made by Lieut. Comg. Craven, and the alarming state of things was developed which is stated in his report and in my letter to the New York Chamber of Commerce, copies of which are given in the .Appendix No. 13. The following is a list for the last year: I. Only eighteen feet at mean low water found on the rock one mile to the southward of Seguin island, coast of Maine. 2. True po8ition of the Hussey Rock, in Casco bay, determined, correcting the erroneous one assigned on previous charts. 3. Determination of the position of the "Hue and Cry," the "Old Proprietor," and other dangerR off Cape Elizabeth, Maine.

4. Development of a rock off Ogunquit, bare at low tides and very little known. 5. A fishing bank sounded out off Wood island, coast of Maine. 6. Huzzey's Rock, south of Fletcher's Neck, ~faine, determined in position. 7. Development of a four-fathom bank off Cape Porpoise, :Maine. 8. Determination of the position of a small rock with less than four feet at mean low water, near the channel, and in the vicinity of Great Rock, Hyannis harbor, Massachusetts. 9. The existence of a seventeen-foot spot on the shoal off the battery, New York liarbor, the extension of the shoal towards the channel, and the shoaling of the water generally between the shoal and shore. 10. The existence and character of sub-currents ascertained, as bearing on the physical condition of New York harbor. 11. Changes developed in the shore Imes at the entrance of Little Annemessex river, Chesapeake bay. 12. Less water found off Cape Roiriain by prelimina.ry examination than has been heretofore assigned. 13. Further explorations in developing the character of the Gulf Stream in the Florid« channel. Changes were reported in Boston inner harbor which made a resurvey desirahle, and the occasion was taken of the presence of one of ·the hydrographic parties in the vicinity to execute the work more fully reported under the head of Section I.
SURVEYS OF THE WESTERN CO.AST.

The reconnaissance of this coast having been made, and its chief harbors and entrances having been surveyed, the annual list heretofore giveu will he replaced by a biennial one. During the past year, at the request of the authorities of San Pedro and Crescent City, miuute surveys of those harbors were made and charts prepared on a larger scale than the previous charts of the same localities. A survey of Gray's harbor was directed, but circumstances preventing the land party from co-operating in it, a simple hydrographic reconnaissance was made. The suJ:"Vey of Coquille river entrance was also ordered, and would have been accomplished but for an accident to the hydrographic vessel. Special arrangements have been made by Commander Alden for its execution. On the 15th of September the Treasury Department issued an order placing the steamer Active at the disposal of Lieutenant General Scott, and at the last advices from the Western Coast that vessel was undergoing repairs at the Mare Island navy yard, to be in readiness for such service as might be required under his orders.
TIDE TABLES.

The tide tables for navigators of the ooast of the United States have been revised in the Tidal Division of the office, and additional results for the diurnal inequality in the ports of the Pacific coast have been interpolated from the observations and reductions at the regular tidal stations. These tables {Appendix No. 14) contain the corrected establishment or mean lunitidal interval of one hundred and ten ports; the rise and fall of mean, spring, and neap tides, and the mean duration of flood, ebb, and stand. Simple rules for computing the time and height of high water, and for correcting the same for half monthly inequality, and for the daily

22

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

inequality where it is sufficient in amount to require notice, arc given. The different peculiarities of the tides on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States are stated as derived from nume1·ous ob;iervations. Easy rules for the tidal currents on the sea-coast of the Atl!\ntic are also embodied in the explanatory notes to the tables.
TABLE OF DEPTHS.

In Appendix No. 15 is preseuted a revision of the table of depths which accompanied my report for 1857, with additions derived from results received at the office since that repQrt was published, and from the latest data furni;;hed by the Tidal Division. The table contains the depths that may be carried in at the entrances to principal ports and rivers, and that may be found at some of the more important anchorages on the several coasts of the United States. The compendious form in which this information is presented has been found very convenient for purposes of general reference.
LIST OF GEOGB.APHICAL
POSI'l'IO~S.

The practical character of the triangulation is well shown in the resulting determinations of the latitude, longitude, and air-line ditances from each other of numerous points on all parts of the coast which have yet been reached in the operations of the survey. ThMe are furnished by computation from tbe notes and journals of observations kept at the stations by the several field parties which occupy them. As being of general interest and of direct practical use to surveyors, navigators, and others, the geographical positions, as increasing in number, have been given in the reports of alternate years, beginning with that for 1851. In Appendix No. 20 of this report, one thousand six lrnndred and sixty-two additional positions are furnished, including points in all the sections of the coast, excepting Section IV. The progress sketches show the locations of the points, the latitudes and longitudes of which, with the bearings and distances from each other, are given in the form of tables. The whole number of points determined, and of which the geographical positions have been published, amounts to seven thousand one hundred and seventy-eight.
TOPOGRAPHICAL .A.ND HYDROGRAPHIC SHEETS.

In my report for 1856 lists were given with the scales, dates, and register numbers of all the plane·table sheets and original charts then on file in the archives. The lists given in the Appendix Nos. 18 and 19 contain the titles, &-c., of the topographical and hydrographic sheets received and registered since that report was issued. To serve as an index for reference, the titles are arranged in geographical order, as in the former list.
INFORMATION FURNISaED.

Under an arrangement in the department which specially authorizes the communication of such data as the archives and records of th.e survey may furnish, on the conditions that due credit may be given for the same, and that the actual expense of copying the records be borne by the applicant, the usual calls have bt>en met as heretofore-(Appendix No. 6.) As regards the general purpose of the work, this practice is merely incidental, but it requires no enlargement to show that all parts of the Union partake of the advantage derived from the regulation. The information, furnished on the terms alluded to, without nny extra cost to the government, may be readily traced in general and elementary publi-

cations, and so has, in a measure, already returned of its first fruits to the people at laq,e. Wherever interest is found in questions concerning the general geograph3~ of the country, it is clear that an accurate coast-line must ever be regarded as an important feature.
STATISTICS.

A revised table containing the statistics of field and office work is given m Appendix No. 7. It will readily be seen that the nature of the data given in some of the items renders the compilation of such a statement a matter of considerable difficulty and labor. Many of the plane-table and hydrographic sheets being required for purposes of reference in joining the new to former work, the statistical data which they would furnish without hindrance to the operations constantly going on at the south during winter, and at the n01·th in summer and autumn, can be reached only by degrees in the process of distributing under the head of each year the work which properly belongs to it. This has at length been as nearly ac<::omplished as the nature of the material and necessities of the work will allow. A systematic revision has been made of all the data, and provision for continuing the same from year to year upon a regular plan and with the same supervision, so that uniformity in the comparisons may be insured.
DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS AND MAPS.

The lists kept at the office now contain the names of about four thousand individuals and public institutions to which the annual reports are sent regularly, as they are published. These lists have received additions, from year to year, of addresses referred by senators and members of the House of Representatives, and some have been registered on considerations connected with the known vocation and standing of the persons and institutions applying for them directly. About three hundred institutions of learning are embraced in the general list. The total stated is exclusive of a number of copies sent in exchange to foreign governments and societies, and of the miscellaneous distribution to individuals. In numerous cases calls made by the constituents of members of Congress after their complement of copies was exhausted have been supplied from the office, as are also the special applications constantly received from all parts of the Union, and from pa.rties connected with the merchant service in the coasting trade. All the vessels of the navy and revenue marine, light-house inspectors, a large number of officers of both branches of the military service, custom-house officers, and others connected with the General Land Office in the States, and the Chambers of Commerce, Boards of 'l'rade and Underwriters in the principal seaboard cities, have been regularly furnished in the same way. 'l'he total number of copies distributed within the year was six thousand one hundred and seventeen. Of maps, charts, and sketches, over fourteen thousand impressions have 'been distributed since the date of my last report. More than half of these were sent to the principal departments of the government, to foreign institutions, and to certain libraries and other public depositories designated by members of the House of Representatives in their respective districts throughout the entire country. It is expected that the Coast Survey Report for 1858, ordered by the last Congress to be printed, will, with its maps and charts, be published by the energetic Superintendent of Public Printing in the early part of the session, anticipating by many months the former rate of publication.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF TWENTY.

At their meeting in 1857 the American Association for the Advancement of Science appointed a committee of twenty,* to examine anew into the character and progress of the Coast Survey. A report had been made by a committee in 1849, and a new examination wafl desired. The conclusions of this committee, after a most elaborate investigation of the subject, are given in their report, t a8 follows: . ''With these voluntary ~nd emphatic testimonies to the character of a work as magnificent in its scientific aspects as it is valuable in those which are purely utilitarian-testimonies, moreover, emanating from sources which rank, in point of authority, among the highest known to the scientific world-the committee might be justified in closing a report already protracted beyond their expectation. After the extended review, however, which they have taken of the purposes in which this great undertaking originated, of the history of its growth, and the expansion of the processes involved in its execution, and of the brilliant results which have already crowned itB diversified labors, it will probably be expected of them that they ~hould condense the final expression of their opinions into a form sufficiently concise to be compre· hended at a single view. As the succl.nct recapitulation, therefore, of the conclusions at which they have arrived, the committee, with entire unanimity, concur in stating the following propositions : "1. The American Coast Survey, in its inception, was a work imperatively demanded by a due regard to the industrial interests of the country, dependent, as they are, greatly upon the prosperity of commerce for their free development. '' 2. The indecision which marked the early policy of the government in regard to this survey, and the consequent delay of its efficient operations, and postponement of its beneficial results, were of manifest disadvantage to the material welfare of our people, and cannot but be still subjects of serious regret. '' 3. The economical value of such surveys is attested by the univer.ial voice of all como L Judge J. R. Kane, 'President Amer. Phil. Society, Penna. 2. Gen. Joseph G. Totten, Chief Engineer U. S.

mercial men, and by the concurrent practice of all commercial nations, no less than by the melancholy records of marine disaster annually occurring upon every unexplored coast. "4. Their scientific vulue is witnessed, in the instance of the American Surve.Y, by the spontaneous tributes of approval frequently and freely bestowed upon it-no less in regard to the ability, energy, and skill displayed in its management than to the magnitude, variety, and oftentimes curious interest of the results it has wrought out-by individuals and organized bodies of men whose high position as scientific authorities renders their opiuions upon subjects of this nature entirely conclusive. "5. This work has conferred many valuable benefits upon science, indirectly and incidentally, in the invention or perfection of instruments, in the improvement of methods of observation or of computation, in the development which it has given to special subjects of interesting inquiry, and in the stimulus which it has furnished to the scientific talent of the country, especially in the field of astronomical observation and investigation. "6. A careful study of the progress made from year to year, especially since the enlargement of the scale of operations under the present Superintendent, affords ample evidence that the work has been expeditiously prosecuted, and that the amount accomplished up to the present date is materially greater than has ever been accomplished in any other country in the same length of time and with the same means. "7. Compared with similar surveys executed or in progress of execution by foreign govern· ments, the American Survey has been conducted with remarkable economy. '' 8. Compared with such foreign surveys, the quality of the work done in this will bear the test of any standard that has ever been anywhere set up, and is such as to reflect honor on the scientific character of our country in the eyes of the world. '' 9. Every consideration of economy, of humanity, and of regard for the reputation of the country, demands that the work should be prosecuted with undiminished activity until every portion of our coast shall have been as thoroughly explored and mapped as those have been already in which its operations commenced. "10. Conclusive reasons, involving other weighty public interests no less than this, but connected also with the project of verifying in the happiest manner the geodesy of our extended and circuitous coast, conspire to render the triangulation of the great Appalachian chain of mountains a most desirable undertaking, and encourage the hope that our government will very early direct that most important work to be executed. "11. The publication in full of all the observations upon which the published results of the Coast Survey are founded, together with the methods employed in the reduction and discussion of the observations,. would be a contribution to science, and especially to the science of geodesy, of inappreciable value, besides being necessary to secure the records against loss; and the committee earnestly hope that the government may not fail to provide the means for the adequate and rapid proBecution of this work. '' 12. The existing organization of the survey, judged in the light of the experience acquired by our own and by foreign governments in the management of such works, is, in the deliberate opinion of the committee, preferable to any other that has ever been suggested. "These propositions have not been hastily sketched, and are not lightly thrown out; but they are an110unced as the result of mature reflection and careful consideration. With their 4

announcement, the duty of the committee, under the resolution appointing them, is discharged. The committee cannot, however, forget that they have another duty, unprescribed by any resolution, to fulfil; which is to express, on behalf of the association which has charged them with their present reRponsihility and of the world of science, which they may claim for the moment to represent, their deep sense of the obligation which they feel to be due to the enlightened statesmen who, whether in the executive branch of the government or in the legislative halls of Congress, have sustained the work to the present hour by their liberi;tl recommendations or their able advocacy, and have labored to conciliate to it the popular favor by their intelligent and manly expositions of its objects and its value. ''Among the distinguished men who hold in their hands the destinies of the country are still to be found statesmen no less enlightened aBd no less liberal. To such. therefore, with whatever branch of the government they may be connected, the committee, 'in conclusion, most cordially commend the important work which they have been reviewing, and, in the name of the associated science of the country, they solicit for it the continuance of the executive favor and legislative support which it has hitherto enjoyed."
TELEGRAPHIC LONGITUDES.

The work oi reductions of telegraphic longitudes, under the direction of Doctor B. A.. Gould, has made excellent progress, besides which, a working list for a catalogue for selecting proper stars for the latitude determinations of the survey has been carefully prepared, The recent longitude determinations of Calais, Bangor, Mobile, New Orleans, and Albany, New York, are far advanced in their reductions, and it is expected that all the reductions of work of former years will have been completed, and put in the shape for publication before the expiration of another year. A new determination, connecting Apalachicola with the main series, will be undertaken this winter. Careful investigations have been made of the determination of the probable error of reading off the Morse fillets, and of chronographs of different kinds, as well as to a suspected personal equation in reading off the several registers, and the results have been highly satisfactory. as showing the readings made to be affected with smaller mean errors than any other chronograph readings to which the party had access. The personal scale of the readers, too, was tested with satisfactory results, showing the distribution of readings of even the hundredths of seconds to be equable and satisfactory. The special report upon the circumpolar catalogue was published in the Astronomical Journal for January, 1859.
BASE OF VERIFICATION.

The base of verification measured upon Epping plain~ in :Maine, in 1857, bas been connected with the primary triangulation, and the verification has been most complete. The approximate leugth of the measured base, as deduced from the office discussion up to 1859, subject yet to some small change for the full result for the expansion of the comparison bar, and the connexion with the standard metre is 8, 715.845 metres. As derived through the primary trian· gulation from the mean of the Fire island and Providence bases from computations to 1859, the same base is 8, 715.837 metres in length, differing but eight millimetres, or three tenths of an inch from the former value. The verification is much within the corrections to be derived from expansion and comparison w~th the standard metre.

.MAGNETIC <1BSERVATIONS.

A memoir prepared by me for the Smithsonian contributions to knowledge and published therein containing a discussion of the magnetic and meteorological observations made between 1840 and 1845, at the Girard College of Philadelphia, under my direction, and the patronage of the American Philosophical Society and of the War Department of the United States, is given in Appendix No. 22. The observations themselves were made in connexion with the extended series under the patronage of the governments of Europe, and were published in extenso by the Senate of the United States. The results arc of practical value in connexion with the discussion of changes daily and annual, and others in the magnetic variation, as well as of scientific interest in reference to the periodical character of the disturbances ob!!erved. The discussions given in my previous reports have proved useful, in a great variety of cases, to surveyors and others, so that the correspondence in regard to them has at different times been quite interesting, from the number and character of the questions raised and settled. The facts given in this paper will, I feel convinced, find in like manner useful applications in practice. In a scientific point of view the connexion between a well determined period in the daily variation of the needle and in its disturbances, and the period of change in the sc¥.ar spots, must be considered not merely curious but important, as proving one of the links connecting the phenomena of the earth's magneti:srn with the general phenomena of the solar system. The subject of the secular change of the magnetic declination (variation of the needle) has again been taken up, and the former discussions given in my annual reports for 1855, 1856, and 1858, have been extended. The results are now tabulated and put in a practical form for ready use. Appendix No. 24 presents the report of Assistant Charles A. Schott, on the last results from the discussion of the secular cbauge of the magnetic declination, accompanied by tables showing the declination (variation of the needle) for every tenth year from the date of the earliest reliable observation, for twenty-six stations on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of th~ United States. The report, after pointing out the change made in the method of treating the observations adopted since the date of the discussion given in my last report, describes in general outlines the character of the secular change. The formulre deduced for each station are then presented, acoompanied by tables of the declination at every tenth year and the deduced epoch of minimum west (or maximum east) declination with its corresponding amount; and also the annual changes for the three epochs 1840, 1850, 'and 1860. Results for several stations outside of the limits of the United States are also given. The paper concludes with a list of the observations used in the discussion, but which have not yet been published in either of my former reports. In the sttmmer Assistant Schott determined the magnetic elements at a number of stations in the New England States; further notices of which will be given under the heads of Section I and Section II, in the body of this report. The results deduced from his observations are stated in tabular form in Appendix No. 23. A new map 0 f the magnetic variation of the world for 1858, compiled from various authentic sources, has been published under the auspices of the British admiralty, by F .·J. Evans, master, R. N. This has been carefully examined by those officers of the Coast Survey whose studies have led them into this field, and meets with high approval. The results have been transferred (Sketch No. 38) to the polyconic projection used in the Coast Survey, and are

GULF STREAM.

The observation~ in the Florida channel have been completed during the past year, and have yielded the most interesting results, of which a report is given in Appendix No. 25. 'l'he form of the bottom of the strait is shown to be simply that of a deep trough, the deepest part o( which lies on the Cuban side of the straits. The cold water from the north is found at the' bottom of this trough, having a temperature of thirty-four degrees. The overlying warm water of the Gulf Stream is without bands, alternately colder and warmer, as it should be if the figure of the bottom determined the formation of these bands, as has been supposed. .A.t Cape Florida the stream is narrowest and shoalest, and the cold water here comes near to the surface, makiug this a comparatively cold band in the longitudinal direction of the stream. The depth of the strait only five miles from Havana is eight hundred fathoms, and close to the island of Bernini three hundred fathoms. This great depth is no doubt caused by the wearing action of the polar current. 'fhe form of this trough renders it probable that the main stream of the Gulf is that which makes the circuit of the Gulf of Mexico. The "old wall" along the coast of the United States is traceable along the Florida keys and to the Tortugas. Some investigations, by experiment, of the effect of pressure on the Saxton metallic thermo· meters are given in the same article of the Appendix.
TIDES .A.ND CURRENTS.

It will be recollected that the physical survey of New York harbor was first commenced at the request of the Commissioners on Harbor Encroachments, and that the expenditures for so much of the work as exceeded the requirements of the Coast Survey have been defrayed by the State of New York, the Coast Survey officers, under anthorfty given to the Commissioners by the President of the United States, and under the directions of the Treasury Department, having carried on the survey. Its results have thus served the double purpose of the new Coast Survey map of the harbor of New York, which in a preliminary form was published in my report of lb57, and which is in progress of engraving in its finished condition, as well as of the Commissioners' map of the harbor. In regard to the physical survey, it is not too much to claim for the observations made, which have now been continued through several years, that they have developed in a general way the causes of the channels and of the shoals of New York harbor and bar, and of the changes above and below water. The curious and unexpected fact of rotary currents at and below the surface at the entrance to the Hudson, rotating in a vertical direction, so that while the water on the surface is running ebb to the south, below the surface it is running flood, or northward, is fully established by the observations, and is of itself of very great practical value . .A.bout nine thousand observations of currents, of which three thousand were taken below the surface, and seven thousand four hundred and ninety observations of the tides, were made in the course of this work during the past season. Observations at current stations beyond the light-ship show that the constant currents, inde· pendent of those from the drainage of the land waters, sweep the Bay of the Five States. One of these stations was nearly sixty miles east-southeast from Sandy Hook. The motion of these

currents sometimes extends to the whole body of the sea, and at others is more or less superficial. The currents near the south shore of Long faland were observed by casting into the sea large shells previously marked, and noting the places and times at which they were thrown up on the beaches. Nearly one-third of the shells were picked up, and their motion established the existence of an excess of easterly current, independent of the effect of winds and waves. The existence of this easterly drift has often been asserted, and yet the spits of the inlets make to the westward, seeming to disprove the fact of an excess of easterly current. To unravel this many observations were made, and the clue seems to have been found in them, but their full discussion is required before pronouncing upon this. This probable clue is in the movement of the waves. Appendix No. 26 contains the report of Assistant Mitchell, by whom the observations were made.
RECORDS AND RESULTS.

The inquiries in regard to this publication are constant, notwithstanding the notice given in my last report of the inadequacy of the appropriation to publish the work. The utmost that can be done with the present means is to keep pace with the records in preparing the work, and this imperfectly. .A volume of Gulf Stream results will, it is expected, be published within the next year ; but if this is accomplished, it is all that can be done, as stated in my last report, with the means in hand from former appropriations. I have no doubt of the importance of resuming this work as soon as the state of the treasury ·will permit, as it secures the records from possible loss, and enables us, while those are connected with t.he survey who have executed the work to be published, to have full scientific criticisms of the results. It has been the reproach of such surveys that there is great delay in publishiug results, so that they appear only years after the work has ceased, and wl1en tlie observations are in a degree obsolete. I should like to avoid the application of this remark to our "vork, if pos8ible.
PROJECTION TABLES.

These tables, as given in Appendix No. 33, were arranged by Assi8tant J. E. Hilgard, and are the extension to lower latitudes of similar ones which appeared in my annual report for 1856. They are based upon a polyconic development of the earth's surface, which supposes each parallel of latitude to be represented on a plane by the development of a cone, having the parallel for its base, and its vertex in the point where a tangent to the paralle'. intersects the earth's axis. In this system the degrees on the parallel preserve their true length, and the general distortion of area is less than in any other geometrical mode of representing a given portion of the earth's surface. Bessel's constants, which have been adopted for projections required in the Coast Survey, were used in tlie formation of the tables. Table I gives the length in metre~ of one degree of latitude and longitude for each degree of latitude from 0° to 54°, and the value of the corresponding radius of the developed parallel. It also gives the values of the angle subtended at the vertex of the cone by the developed parallel, for ten degrees of longitude, by means of which the tables may readily he extended. Table II gives the rectangular co-ordinates for thirty degrees of longitude on each parallel, from latitude 1° to 54°, the numbers in the table corresponding to the actual dimensions of the earth in metres, and only requiring to be divided by the proper number for any desired scale. Notes explanat.ory of the tables precede them in the Appendix.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS.

An apparatus for deep-sea soundings, based upon his examinations of this subject, has been devised by Professor W. P. Trowbridge, assistant in the Coast Survey. A full description of the instrument will be found in the .Appendix No. 34, and views of its several parts on Sketch No. 39. The principal feature of this sounding apparatus is new, but simple, and it is hoped that a great improvement on the present modes of sounding in great depths may result from itR application. The friction upon the line in the descent of the lead is avoided, and the consequent freedom of descent secured by having the line compactly coiled along with the sinker, the uncoiling taking place in the descent of the apparatus. It is proposed to test the practical working of the instrument during the coming season. The experiments with the pressure tide-gauge of Captain Hunt, of the Corps of Engineers, have been continued, and show that the instrument must in many cases be a very useful one. By filling the tube which communicates between the pressure bag and the indicator with alcohol, we expect to he able to use the instrument at low temperatures and when the surface of the water is covered by ice. The experiments of Mr. J. M. Batchelder, in continurttion of those noticed in my report of last year, are 8tated in Appendix No. 35. In the report of Assistant Henry Mitchell (.Appendix No. 26) v.rill be found descriptions of improvements in apparatus for detecting and measuring sub-currents, and also of an improved form of pile for securing structures upon shoals or along the open coast, where the heavy sea prevents the use of ordinary means. These devices are illustrated in Sketch No. 40. In the use of the improved current apparatus the velocities of the drifs in the lower water strata are compared with the superficial movements of tl1e sea by measuring, during a specified interval of time, the separation which takes place between a floating body and a system of globes or shafts let down to great depths. When in use the apparatus is in no wise connected with the vessel, so that no discordance in the observations can result from the motions of the latter, and the experiments may be made accurately even in a heavy sea . .Assistant Mitchell's improved pile is a device borrowed from nature, be having observed that certain seed vessels, by virtue of their forms, bury themselves in the earth when agitated by wind or water. This pile, instead of being torn up by the waves, is impelled steadily downward. It may be hewn out ever so roughly, its success in practice depending upon very simple conditions described in the report which I have referred to. In his past season's operations Mr. Mitchell has made ·successful use of apparatus comprehending the improvements he describes.
OFFICERS OF THE ARMY.

Between November 1, 1858, and the same date of the present year, five officers of the army have deen detached from the Coast Survey, and two detailed for service. Captain E. B. Hunt, of the Corps of Engineers, has not been regularly detached, but has, in fact, been so occupied with engineering duties as to render it impracticable that he should give any portion of his time to the Coast Survey. Captain A. H. Seward, U. S . .A.,detached on his promotion, has rendered good service, and shown remarkable adaptation to our work in charge of a triangulation party in the very difficult region of the inner Florida keys, and the loss of his experience to the survey is much to be regretted.

THE 'C"NITED STATES COAST St:RVEY.

31

Lieutenant J. C. Tidball, U. S. A., had been in charge of the drawing division of the Coast Survey for several years, and was a very efficient officer. Lieutenants J. P. Roy, and Rufus Saxton had been serviceable both in the field and office. The experience of all these officers is now lost to us in their several positions. Appendix No. 3 contains a list of the army officers .now attached to the Coast Survey.
OFFICERS OF THE NAVY.

During the past year we have lost by detachment the services of two of the most expe· rienced chiefs of hydrographic parties. Lieutenants T . .A.. Craven and J. N. Maffitt, U. S. N., have thoroughly indentified their names with the Coast Survey, and wherever their labors have extended, from Maine to Texas, have left the mark of their special abiliry for the work. During the last period of their service they were but temporarily attached to the survey, it being understood that the Navy Department would soon need them in highly responsible positions connected with the general service, but they, nevertheless, both found time, the former on the Florida reef, in New York harbor, and in the Gulf Stream, and the latter in organizing a system of repairs and equipment, to cause that short period to be remembered as important to the survey. By the kindness of the Hon. Secretary of the Navy, my letters of acknowledgment to these officers were transmitted to them in the most complimentary way.-(Appendix No. 39.) Lieutenant W. G. Temple, U. S. N., was detached from the command of the steamer Corwin in October, 1858, and from the F>urvey in April, 1859. Ho had been in charge of a party less than two years, but his preliminary experience in the work, and his intelligence and industry, rendered every day of his connexion with it useful to the survey. Lieutenant '!'. B. Huger, U. S. N., was detached at the close of his summer's work, having earned the name of a zealous and intelligent chief of a hydrographic party. Of the chiefs of parties who have replaced these officers, Lieutenant Wilkinson and Lieutenant Phelps have had considerable experience in the survey in former years, as junior officers of parties. The names of all the officers now on duty in the Coast Survey are given in Appendix No. 5. The deficienc) in the number of naval officers, by which only one lieutenant is now allowed to each hydrograi>hic party, has made a radical change in our service. The master's mates allowed to the parties will, in time, be trained to the work, but thus far the difficulties have been much increased by the want of experienced officers. The rules r~quired ~o give a form of organization to this branch of the service have been adopted, and their working will be carefully observed. All the engineers of the Coast Survey vessels are now civilians, and their entire emolument is derived from the Coast Survey appropriations. Under the regulations of the Treasury Department they are employed by the chiefs of hydrographic parties at fixed rates of pay, their employment lasting, as a rule, only while the vessels are in commission.
HYDROGRAPHIO DIVISION.

The advantages to be derived from this division have been fully realized by the activity of Lieut. J. N. Maffitt, U. S. N., who was in charge of it at the outset, with Mr. A.. Balbach as the draughtsman. Commander 8. S. Lee, U. S. N., who has replaced Lieut. Maffitt, will no doubt maintain all its efficiency.

32

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The duties of hydrographic inspector, which are combined with those of the charge of this division, are of great importance, and Commander Lee has ~lready shown the efficiency and economy which must come from the new organization devised by Lieut. Maffitt, and commenced under bis immediate supervision. By the kindness of the Hon. Secretary of the Navy, and of Commodore Smith, chief of the Bureau of Docks and Yards, the necessary store-room has been assigned to us in the New York navy yard, and the order and method introduced into the laying up, repairs, and fitting out of our small vessels, and into the charge of them while laid up, will prove not only a sou~ce of efficiency, but also of economy.
AIDS TO NAVIGATION .

.A.s the hydrographic work advances, and developments are made of the known or hitherto unknown dangers to navigation, the practice has been, with the chiefs of parties, to report upon them, with such recommendations in regard to buoys or other marks as in their judgment . are necessary. Their remarks on the aids required for safety in navigation are from time to time referred through the department for the consideration of the Light-house Board . .Appendix No. 40 contains a list of the caRes reported within the year, and Nos. 41, 42, and 43 my communications relative to the special localities and character of the marks required for the purposes of mariners.
OBITUARIES.

-

The survey has lost during the past year, by death, the services of Lieut. John K. Duer, U.S. N., who was in charge of one of the hydrograpbic parties in the Gulf of Mexico. This officer discovered in 1857 the new channel east of Dog island, leading into St. George's sound, and to Apalachicola, so important to the future development of that part of the coast of Florida, and was engaged in completing the survey of the approaches when he died. He was a zealous and industrious officer, regarding always the public service rather than bis own health or convenience, and died of a disease of the heart aggravated by the labors and responsibilities of his position. _,,, Mr. Gustavus Wiirdemann, in charge of the tidal observations on the Florida reefs and in the Gulf of Mexico, died at his home in New Jersey on the 29th of September. His health had been failing for some years, and during the last year he had discharged his duties with great difficulty, owing to physical debility. Mr. W iirdemann entered the survey under my predecessor, and served until the period of his death with a fidelity and singleness of purpose that has never been exceeded. Exact truthfulness was the leading trait of his character, and his observations were reliable in the most minute as in the largest points. It is easily seen that it is no exaggeration to say that such a man in his place was invaluable, and an example worthy to be held up as the type of faithfulness. During the discharge of his laborious duties he found time and opportunity to make collections in natural history, which have been acknowledged by the Smithsonian Institution as among its most valuable contributions to the knowledge of the fauna of Florida. Mr. F. Dankworth, one of the oldest and best engravers in the Coast Survey Office, whose employment dates from 1843, died on the 19th of April. He had been in infirm health for the last year, but continued to the last to work at his art, to which he was successfully devoted.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

33

I proceed now to give, in the usual geographical order, detailed statements of the field-work done on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States, under the head of sections, the limits of which have been already defined. In each chapter the work is described generally in the natural order taken iu its execution, as triangulation, topography, hydrography· Notices of the office-work done in Washington precede the several chapters, each of which corresponds to one of the sections. SECTION I.
FROM PASSAMAQUODDY BAS TO POINT JUDITH, INCLUDING THE COAST OF THE STATES OF MAINE, NEW H.A.MI'SHIBE, M.A.SS.A.CHUSE'ITS, AND RHODE ISLAND.-(Su:rcH .A., Nos. 1
AND

2.)

The progress in the field-work of this section is stated under the following heads: 1. Georletic and astronomical observations.-The primar~T triangulation and the astronomical and magnetic observations connected with it have been carried to the boundary, and Chamcook station has been occupied for the survey of Passamaquoddy bay. 2. Triangulation connected with Epping base.-The primary triangulation has been connected with the base of verification on Epping plains, measured in 1857. The verification from the first approximate mmputations is highly satisfactory, the length as measured and as computed from the triangulation differing but three-tenths of an inch in five miles and four-tenths. This brings the results much within the range of uncertainties of expansion of measures and the like. 3. Trianqulation of Pen0b8cot bay.-This work extends over the entrance, embracing the islands as well as the main. 4. Triang-ulatiori of Muscongus bay and sound.-This work has been extended from the Sheepscot river over the Damariscotta and over Muscongus bay and sound to a junction with the Penobscot work. 5. Topography qf Wiscasset bay.-A stretch of about four miles above and below the town of Wiscasset has been completed, joining with the work of the previous year on the Sheepscot. 6. Topography qf Merryme,eting ba,y and qf Bath, Maine. -This is a continuation of the survey of the shores of the Kennebec river. 7. Topography of Casco ba,y, Maine.-This is a continuation of the survey of the main and islands of Casco bay, and extends to Harpswell Neck. 8. Plane-table survey of the Isle of Shoals and adjacent coast. 9. Topography of Barnstalk harbor and approaches, Ma.ss.-This forms part of the topography of Cape Cod, which remained to be executed on the inner shore.

10. Hydrography of the approaches to Sheepscot ba,y and Kennehec river, Maine.-These were
nearly completed. The least depth of water upon "Mile Ledge" was found to be but eighteen feet at mean low tide. 11. Hydrography qf Gasco bay.-This is in continuation of the soundings of the lower part of Casco bay. The well known "Hussey Ro~k" was found to he erroneously laid down in position on the best charts. The shoal artificially caused off Union wharf, Portland harbor, has been nearly removed. 12. In-s"IJ<yre hydrography between Cape Elizabeth and Cape PorpoiM, coast qf Maine.-This is nearly connected with the hydrography of the approaches to Portland harbor. Cape Porpoise,

5

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Stage Island, and Wood Island harbors were surveyed in connection with this work. The developments here were numerous. 13. Off-shore hydrogrophy, coo.st of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.-Important contributions to this have been made. 14. Examination qf Salem harbor.--This was an extension of the examination of last year. 15. Rock determined in Hyannis harbor, Mass. 16. Magnetic observations at localities extending from Portland to Cape Ann. 17. Tidal observations. This work has occupied three triangulation and magnetic, four topographical, and two hydrographic parties during the whole or parts of the season. Office-work.-The drawing and engraving of additions to the chart of Boston harbor have been completed, as also the drawing of those of Portland harbor, Lyn,n harbor, and a new edition of that of Muskeget channel, and the engraving of the preliminary charts of Kennebec river and Rockport harbor. Progress hall been made in the drawing and engraving of general coast chart No. II, from Cape Ann to Gay Head, and of preliminary coast chart No. 3, from Cape Small Point to Cape Cod; in the drawing of coast maps and charts, No. 7, from Muscongus bay to Portland harbor; ~os. 9, 10, and 11, from Cape Neddick to Hyannis harbor, and No. 14, from Cuttyhunk island to Block island; also in the engraving of coast maps and charts, Nos. 12 and 13, from Monomoy to New Bedford; the views for the&e charts, the finished maps of Kennebec river and Lynn harbor, and the new edition of the chart of Muskeget channel. Geodetic and astronomical olA·ervations.-The party under my immediate direction was organized at Washington early in June for the purpose of completing the primary triangulatiol!l of the coast near the northeastern boundary of the United States~ The preliminaries required in the erection of additional signals and posting the heliotropers were executed by Assistants C. 0. Boutelle and G. W. Dean, and the preparations necessary in occupying the stations were, as usual, made by Mr. Thomas McDonnell, artificer in the Coast Survey. Station Howard, situated on the western side of Machias bay, and in the township of Machiasport, Washington county, Maine, was first occupied. Owing to unfavorable weather, arising chiefly from the prevalence of sea fogs, but little progress was made until the middle of July, when the measurement of horizontal angles was commenced. From that period the work advanced well, and the various operations being satisfactorily completed by the 15th of .August, arrangements were made for the immediate transfer of the party and instruments to the station Western Ridge, in Cooper township, in connection by a primary line, as may be seen by reference to sketch No. 1, with station Howard. The operations at Howard included t11e measurement of twenty-four horizontal angles with the thirty-inch theodolite; vertical angles with the eight-inch Gamhey circle, C. S. No. 57, upon six pointtl; the determination of the latitude with the zenith telescope; azimuth obser~ vations with the thirty-inch theodolite; the determination of the magnetic elements; levellings for ascertaining the height of the ste.tion above the sea, l\lld the usual meteorological observations. These several particulars, in connection with others, will prese:atly be noticed more in detail. The moo.surements of horizontal angles at t1tation W estem Ridge were commenced on the 30th

35

of August, and the work was pressed forward until the 27th of September, at which date all the geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic observations were brought to a successful close. For extending the triangulation so as to include the northeastern boundary in the vicinity of Passamaquoddy bay, Chamcook station, near St. Andrew's, New Brunswick, was occupied by Assistant Dean between the 13th and 28th of October, and satisfactory measurements made of the angles required to conclude the primary work. 'l'he facilities extended to Mr. Dean by T. B. Wilson, ei;q., of Chamcook, and Capt. Thomas Jones, U. S. consul at St. Andrews, while prosecutiug the operations in that vicinity, are acknowledged in his report. 'l'he following statistics exhibit in brief the work executed by my party in this section during the past season: Triangulation.-Atstation Howard 1,066 observations were made with the thirty-inch theodolite· C. S. No. 1, upon ten signals and an elongation mark. The vertical angles for determining the heights of the principal stations were measured with the eight-inch Gambey vertical circle, C. S. No. 57, aud for this purpose sixty-seven sets each, coni;isting of six measurements of the angle, were made upon the signals of six stations. At Western Ridge station I, 103 observations were made w~th the large theodolite upon eleven signals and the elongation mark. Nine stations were observed on for the vertical angles, and 560 measurements were made. At station Chamcook 464 observations were made with the large theodolite upon four signals for horizontal angles. Vertical angles were measured by 234 observations on the same signals with the circle No. 57. The most distant signal observed on during the season was that on Mt. Desert island, as seen from Wes tern Ridge. 'l'his line, between tbe two stations, is about fifty-eight miles in length. From Wes tern Ridge the highest peak of Mt. Katahdn was observed on incidentally at a distance of about a hundred miles, and with observations of the same kind made at Mt. Desert in 1856, upon the same point, the geographical position of that remarkable feature of the interior of Maine will be approximately determined. The primary triangulation completed during the season embraces an area of 1, 150 square miles. Latitude and time observations.-At station Howard two hundred and ninet~en observations were made with the zenith telescope, C. S. No. 5, upon forty sets of stars. The arc value of a revolution of the micrometer was carefully obtained from one hundred and twenty-two observations on Polaris near its eastern elongation, and the value of a division of the level was found in the usual way by thirty observations upon a collimator with the micrometer. With the forty six inch transit, C. S. No. 4, the local time was determined by a hundred and three observations on fifteen standard stars, zenith and circumpolar. At Western Ridge two hundred and twenty-three observations were made with the zenith telescope upon forty sets of stars. The arc value of the micrometer was ascertained from a hundred and twenty two observations upon the star 51 Hev. Cepbei near its eastern elongation, and the customary means were taken for finding the value of the level scale. Local time was determined from seventy-three observations on twenty zenith and circumpolar stars. The observations for latitude and time were made by Sub-Assistant Edward Goodfellow, aided by :Mr. Henry W. Bache . .Azimuth.-The azimuth of the trigonometrical lines at station Howard was determined, as in other cases, with the thirty-inch theodolite, aud for that purpose one humlred observations ·were

36

SUPERINTEXDE~T

OF

made upon Polaris near its eastern elongation, besides seventy-two on Ursro Minoris, near the upper culmination, in connection with two hundred and eighty observations upon the elongation mark. At Western Ridge the azimuth was determined from seventy observations upon}. Ursro Minoris, near its upper culmination, and one hundred and twenty-six observations on the elongation mark. Magnetic observations.-The geological formation at station Howard indicated that the magnet would be affected by 1ocal attraction, and the experimental observations made at several points near it proved this to be the case. After selecting tho most favorable position, one hundired and forty-seven observations were made for declination, the magnet used being freely suspended during three consecutive days. The inclination was measured with the nine-inch dip-circle, :five complete sets of observations being made with two needles. The horizontal intensity and moment of inertia were deduced from two sets of experiments on different days. At Western Ridge the magnetic declination was ascertained by one hundred and ninety observations on four days, and the inclination from three complete sets made on different days. At station Chamcook the declination was determined by one hundred and thirty-five observations on three days, the inclination from four sets of experiments on different days, and the horizontal intensity and momer1t of inertia in the usual way. Observations were also made at Eastport, :Maine, and in its immediate vicinity, for determining the magnetic inclination and local intensity. The declinometer D. 22, C. S. No. 1, and dip-circle, C. S. No. 4, were used in all the observations made at the several stations. The azimuth and magnetic observations were made by Assistant Dean, aided by Messrs. R. E. Halter, R. H. Talcott, and C. S. Peirce. While the astronomical and geodetic operations were in progress at Howard, :Mr. Talcott made a series of levellings from the station to a bench-mark which had been established by careful tidal oboiervations made by Mr. McDonnell, who also ran a line of levels between the same points. Meteorological ob.servations--The usual journals were kept at the several stations by Mr. Talcott, and in the course of the working season two hundred and ninety readings of the barometi:ir, thermometers, and evaporating point, were recorded. All the original records were duplicated, and the computations from the latitude, azimuth, and magnetic observations nearly completed, before the party returned from the field. These, making a total of fifty volumes, have been deposited in the archives at Washington. Assistant Dean and Sub-Assistant Goodfellow are about to resume the prosecution of longitude determinations on the Gulf of Mexico. Reconnaissance.-The primary triangulation which has been carried through New England having approached the northeastern boundary of the United States, it became desirable that stations should be chosen for closing the series in that quarter so as to include the St. Croix river and Passamaquoddy bay. In the latter part of June Assistant C. 0. Boutelle proceeded on this duty, first re-erecting on Mt. Desert island the primary signal which had been destroyed by a storm subsequent to the occupation of that point by my own party in the autumn of 1857, and placing the heliotropes necessary for the measurement of horizontal angles formed at the two remaining stations (Howard and Cooper) west of the boundary, intended to be occupied at a later period in the present surveying year. Ample facilities for the work were afforded in

THE rXITEn STATES COAST SCRVEY.

37

the use of the U. S. revenue cutter Jackson, by her captain, Joseph Noyes, and by Robert Burns, esq., collector at Eastport, Mc., under authority from the Treasury Department. The official sanction of the colonial authorities of New Brunswick having been received, Mr. Boutelle selected and marked a station at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from the bluff on the north side of Dark harbor, Grand Manan island, and erected a signal at Chamcook, in the vicinity of St. Andrew's. Both of these points (Sketch No. 1) were observed on from the station occupied by my party in September. The reconnaissance was so made as to settle also the availability of points for the secondary triangulation in the vicinity of Passamaquoddy bay, and for its connection with the primary work. Two signals of the second order were erected-one at Prince Regent's Redoubt, (Moose island,) near Eastport, and the other on Trescott Rock. The positions of these, and the general plan proposed for the smaller triangulation, are shown on Sketch No. 2. As8istant Boutelle was aided in this service by Mr. C. H. Boyd. In the early part of the surveying year his party was employed in Section V, and afterward8 completed the triangulation work, in the vicinity of the Epping base, as will be presently noticed. In the course of the season he visited and examined the lines leading from the two primary stations-Gunstock Mt., in New Hampshire, and Wachusett Mt., in Massachusetts-which had been passed by in the progress of the general triangulation through New England, and which yet remain to be occupied. Triangulation ccnnected with Epping base.-This duty was commenced on the 17th of September by Assistant Boutelle, from whose report, made on the completion of the work, the following extract is taken: " In occupying as stations the east and west ends of the base, the theodolite was protected from sun and wind by a temporary structure, and the observing tripods by a couple of screens of light canvas, each of the size of the surrounding scaffold. These were spread on the windward sides, and kept the platform on which the theodolite was placed in perfect steadiness. At the west eud of tbe base the wind blew almost a gale from the northwest on the evening of the 15th and morning of the 16th of October; and although the scaffold was over forty feet high, eighteen feet wide at the base and nine at the top, the protection from the screens was such that t.he observations were not materially interfered with. It would have been impossible to observe without them, and I consider them a great addition to our means of observing in the southern sections where tripods are more frequently required." The connection of the base with the primary triangulation was effected by occupying, besides the two ends, the three adjacent stations, namely: Burke, Pigeon Hill, and Tunk Mt., all of which, and also the relative situation of the base line, are shown on Sketch No. 1. Each of the horizontal angles was determined by a hundred and twenty measurements with the ten-inch Gambey repeating theodolite, C. S. No.43. The vertical angles were measured by means of the eight-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 24. Mr. Boutelle observed a series of consecutive tides near Pigeon Hill, and carried a line of levels to that station, determining its height above the mean level of the sea.

ABilistant Boutelle was aided in the :field by Mr. C. H. Boyd. All the records of the work were duplicated before the return of the party from this section. Mr. Boutelle had been previously engaged in Section V. Triangulation ef Penob.scot bay, Me.-This work, which was begun last year, has been con· tinued by the party of Sub-Assistant J. A. Sullivan. The stations established by Sub-Assist· ant Harris were in part occupied, and angular measurements made from them on others above and below the primary line Ragged - - - Isle au Haut, shown on Sketch No. 2. Progress was made in extending the work upwards between the 23d of July and 23d of September, when the schooner Peirce, which attended the party, was despatched for New York. Observatio'ls were continued by Mr. Sullivan until the 5th of October. Sixty points of the third order were determined in position. These and the measurements of secondary angles were made with the Wiirdemann theodolite, C. S. No. 86. As every precaution was taken in erecting signals for continuing the triangulation up the bay, there is a fair prospect that the future progress in that direction will be more rapid. The number of observations made in the course of the season was five thousand one hundred and twenty. Messrs. R. :M. Stiles and J. D. Bradford served with zeal and efficiency as aids in the party. The previous occupation of Sub-Assistant Sullivan will be referred to under Section VI. Sub-Assistant Harris, who was last year engaged on Penobscot bay, has sent to the office duplicates of his notes of horizontal angles and descriptions of the signals erected at the outset of the work. Triangulation over Muscongus bay and sou11il, Me.-On the 6th of July the p<trty of Sub-Asi,iistant F. P. Webber, commenced the erection of the remaining signals necessary for extending the secondary triangulation eastward of the Sheepscot river, over the Damariscotta river, and over Muscongus bay and sound. The signal at Edgecombe and some others in the vicinity, having been blown down in the spring, were re-erected, and twenty-one others, mostly of the third order, for topographical purposes, were put up. The reconnaissance and preliminaries being complete by the end of July, Mr. Webber, aided by Mr. Julius Kincheloe, commenced the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles, and occupied fifteen stations with the theodolite, at seven of which vertical angles were observed on the signals of the thirty-four stations embraced in hi.s field of work. It will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 2 that the secondary triangulation conducted by Sub-Assistant Webber has been pushed to a. connection with that of the lower part of Penobscot bay, on the line which joins Manhegan island with a station on the east side of St. George's river. Fifty-nine points were determined in position within the scope of the triangulation.

Duplicates of the field·notes made in the triangulation over Damariscotta river and Mus· congus bay have been deposited in the office with the descriptions of the signals as now standing. Topography ef Wiscasset bay, Me.-The sheet containing this work was taken into the field by Sub-Assistant W. H. Dennis on the 1st. of A11g11st. On the south it joins. with the work done last year on the Sheepscot river by Assistant Hull Adams. As far as now completed, the topography represents the town of Wiscasset and its environs, and the details found at Edgecombe, on the opposite side of Wiscasset bay, including also the mouth of the Sheepscot, above Wiscasset, making altogether a stretch of about four miles above and below the town. Owing to the nature of the surface the features in detail were f01md very difficult of delineation. Sub-Assistant Dennis was efficiently aided in plane table duty by Mr. J. L. Tilghman.

Topography of Merrymeeting bay and Bath, Me.--The supplementary topography required for the chart of the Kennebec river, in the vicinity of Bath, was taken up on the 24th of June by Assistant R. M. Bache. Sub-Assistant W. S. Edwards was attached to his party, and worked with a separate plane·table on the details of the shores of Merrymeeting bay. Assistant Bache traced in the streets and wharves of the city of Bath, which is continuous for about five miles along the west bank of the Kennebec. The very uneven surface represented on the two sheets referred to made the field-work tedious and necessarily slow in execution. The locality is shown OB Sketch No. 2.

Topog'l"aphy <f OMOO bay, Me.-The work of the season on the sh<>res of Casco bay, and on the islands east of Portland harbor, was in charge of .Assistant A. W. Longfellow, and consisted of filling the interior details and contour of ground of the outstanding sheets, of which the shore line had been previously traced. Assistant .A. 8. Wadsworth was attached to the plane table party1 a.nd Mr. James Gilliss served as aid. The topography was resumed on the 11th of July and continued until the 4th of November. Assistant Longfellow completed the survey of the shores of the Presumpscot river, a.nd of th· main shore of Casco bay, from thence north-

ward to a point beyond Sturdivant's island, from which it was extended by Assistant Wadsworth in the same direction abreast of Prince's Point, and there joined to a portion of work also finished by Mr. Longfellow. The topography of the interior of Long's and Cousin's island was completed, as also that of Great Jebeig, Hope, Crotch, and Jewell's islands. The location of the three plane-table sheets worked on, and of which the details are now complete, may be seen in Sketch No. 2. On two other sheets, which embrace Yarmouth river and Harpswell Neck, progress has been made in the shore line survey.

The party of A~sistant Longfellow used the schooner Meredith for transportation and quarters while working in Casco bay. Plane-table survey qf Saco "bay and vimnity, .Me.--In order to facilitate the early completion of the charts of soundings to be made between Cape Elizabeth and Kennebunkport., Me., Sub-Assistant C. Fendall was attached to the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Murray, and traced the entire sl10re-line from Prout' s Neck and Stratten island southward, and westward to Kennebunk river. His work, the limits of which, as contained on four plane-table sheets marked on Sketch No. 2, embraces the shores of Saco bay, Wood island, Fletcher's Neck, and all the islands and coast intermediate between the last-named point and Kennebunk river. The Isles of Shoals were also surveyed, and were mapped on a separate topographical sheet. Topography of BarnstaUe harbor and vicinity, Mass.-The survey of the shores of Cape Cod bay was commenced on the 7th of July by Assistant A. M. Harrison. Two plane-table sheets were projected-one to include Barnstable harbor, and the other to extend the work westward. The topography was taken up at Scargo Hill, near North Dennis, and in its course westward embraced, besides the usual surface details, the village just named, and also Yarmouth, Yar· mouth port, Barnstable, Pond Village, and West Barnstable, together with the Great Marshes in that immediate vicinity, Sandy N eek, and the entire shore of Barnstable harbor. Very few of the details of the vicinity yet remain to be traced on the sheet. Its limits are shown on Sketch No. 2. From the shore line of the harbor the survey was carried back to an average breadth of a mile and a half. Sub-Assistant P. 0. F. West and Mr. .A.. W. Thompson were attached to the plane-table party, and rendered efficient service. The character of the country in the vicinity of Barnstable prese_nts almost every variety of ground, and much of it is thickly settled. The Cape Cod railroad is represented in the stretch from West Barnstable to Dennis Pond, where it turns to cross the peninsula. As1listant Harrison closed work on the 21st of October, but, before leaving the field, visited the triangulation points on which his work was based, reset the station marks, and prepared for the records of the office new sketches of them, accompanied by descriptive notes. The following synopsis of statistics is ta.ken from his report:

The plane-table sheet embraces a coast reach of rather more than ten miles, measuring east and west of Barnstable harbor. Verification qf Topography.-After closing special field service, which will be referred to in the following chapter, Assistant H. L. Whiting examined the plane-table work done this season in the vicinity of Wiscasset, and that on the shores and islands of Casco bay and in the neighborhood of Barnstable harbor. The examination was made with reference to the amount and character of the topography, and was fully reported on by :Mr. Whiting as being in all respects satisfactory and thorough in detail. The localities mentioned are amongst the most difficult of representation that have yet been passed over by either of the plane-table parties. Hydrography of tlte approaches to Slwepscot bay and Kennebec river, .Jiainc.-l'"nder circum· stances unusually favorable for work afloat, the hydrograpliy of the approaches to the Sheepscot and Kennebec rivers was completed in August by the party of Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinson, U. S. :N'., assistant Coast Survey, working with the steamer Corwin. The upper limit of the soundings is on a line passing from Cape N ewaggen across and about three miles to seaward of Dami,;cove island, from whence the work was prosecuted southward and westward to the meridian of Cape Small Point, where it joins the completed hydrography of 185G-' 57. The resulting chart will extend several miles to the southward of Seguin island, the soundings in that vicinity being made as supplementary to the hydrography of tbe Kennebec entrance, executed in the surveying season of 1855-' 56. Sketch No. 2 shows the locality and the limits referred to. The tidal observations required in plotting the soundings were made at a station in Booth bay. A small sunken rock, known as "Mile Ledge," lying about a mile to the southward of Seguin island light, and which is marked on the old charts as having four fathoms, was found by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson to have only eighteen feet water at mean low tide. The rock is in the track of vesEels bound into Kennebec river, and bears from the light-house S. 9° 30' E., (true,) or south a little to the westward by compass. The range and other particulars for determining its position were made known to the department in September, in a :)Ornmunication, a copy of which is given in .Appendix No. 9. A summary returned on concluding the hydrography of this vicinity presents the following statistics:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Hydrography of Casco bay, Maine.-The soundings required to complete the hydrography of the lower part of Casco bay were made in the latter part of August and early part of September by the party of Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, working with the steamer Corwin. A space embracing about twenty square miles al1reast of Portland light, and included between Peak's island and Green island, is shown on the chart. Within ·its limits occurs the Hussey Rock, the position of which has been hitherto erroneously laid down on the best charts of Casco bay, and which, in the course of the operations conducted by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinsol}, was found to be more than a quarter of a nautical mile northwest of the position heretofore assigned. Bearings and ranges from the true position to fixed points on the main and adjacent islands are given in Appendix No. 10. The Ilussey Rock is small and has only twelve feet on it at mean low water. The locality in which the soundings were made may be seen by reference to Sketch No. 2, by which, also, it will be observed that the in-shore hydrography of the section has been pushed as a continuous work as far to the northward and eastward as Cape N ewaggen, with the exception of a small interval at Cape Elizabeth, the advance of the season not admitting of a final junction between the lines run by Lieutenant Commanding Wilkinson and those of Lieut. Comg. Murray, the site of whose work will be referred to presently. Tidal observations were made with a staff-gauge at Peak's island while the party was sounding in that vicinity. At a period since the date of the survey made by Lieutenant Commanding Maxwell Woodhull, U. S. N., the water at one point in the channel off Union wharf, Portland harbor, had This was made the subject of examination by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, and it shoaled. appeared that by the sinking of a schooner laden with granite the depth had been for some time decre11sed. The obstruction is now removed and the depth nearly restored to what it was when the preliminary chart of Portland harbor was :first issued. The following is a summary of the hydrographic statistics:

Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson has turned in the note-books containing the entries of soundings and tidal observations made in Casco bay and in Portland harbor. The hydrographic sheet showing the soundings made at the entrance of Casco bay by Lieut. Comg. Temple, U. 8- N., in the previous"'Surveying season, has also been received. In-shore hydrography be,tween Ca[Je Elizahdh and Cape Porp<Yise, coastqf Maine.-This work was resumed in July by Lieut. Comg. Alexander Murray, U. S. N., aasistant Coast Survey, at last year's limit, near Kennebunkport, and from thence was prosecuted northward and eastward to the vicinity of Cape Elizabeth, the lateness of the season and duty required in the lower part of the section only preventing a junction with hydrography of the approaches to Portland harbor. Sketch No 36 shows in a general way the present condition of the in-shore soundings on this.

part of the coast, and the progress sketch (No. 2) the limits of the several sheets executed this season. The soundings were carried about eight miles out from the coast line and into depths varying between fifty-five and seventy-five fathoms. Within the limits of this work are several small harbors, with a good depth of water and fine holding ground. Surveys were made of Cape Porpoise, Stage island, and Wood island harbors, and the plotting of the sheet containing them is well advanced. Sub-Assistant C. Fendall was attached to the party, and furnished plane-table data as needed in the hydrography. A tide-gauge was set up at Wood i;;land harbor and regular observations referred to a benchmark were duly recorded as the soundings advanced in that vicinity. Among the important developments of the present working season on the com;t of this section are the following, made by the party of Lieut. Comg. Murray, in the surveying steamer Bibb. The four-fathom bank off Cape Porpoise, Maine, completely sounded out. A fishing bank developed off Wood island. Hussey Rock, off Saco bay, and to the southward of Fletcher's neck, determined in position.-(See Appendix No. 41.) Th~ position and development of a rock off Ogunquit, bare at low tide, and but very little known.-(See Appendix No. 11.) Determination of the position of the ·'Hue and Cry,'' the "Old Proprietor," and other dangers to navigation off Cape Elizabeth.

The sheets containing the plane-table work done by Sub-Assistant Fendall are now on file with the archives. All the original note-books of soundings and anglel:l and the chart of last year's work have also been deposited in the office. Being incidentally at Portsmouth harbor, N. H., with the steamer Bibb, Lieut. Comg. Murray rendered acceptable service to another branch of the government at the request of the commandant of the naval station, Captain John Pope, U. S. N., whose r.cknowledgment of the same will be found in Appendix No. 37. Mr. W. B. McMurtrie accompanied the hydrographic party, and took views for the charts of the Kennebec entrance, Portland harbor, Stage island harbor, and of several points in the vicinity of Saco bay. Off-shore hydrography, coast ef Maine, New Hampshire, and .Jfassachusetts.-In passing to the upper part of the section in the steamer Bibb, Lieutenant Comraanding Murray started from a position eastward of Pollock's Rip light-boat and ran a line of soundings due north to the parallel of Cape Ann, and thence to the Isles of Shoals. From Cape Aun a line was afterwards carried across the southern part of Cashe' s Ledge, and as far to the eastward as Seal island, N. S. The greatest depth found on this line was a hundred and sixty fathoms. In crossing Cashe's Ledge the soundings showed a depth of 16 fathoms. From Seal island, N. S., soundings . were made on the course to Grand Manan island, and from thence traverse lines were carried

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

to the westward close in by Mt. Desert Rock and by Matinicus and Manhegan islaHd to Cape Elizabeth. While in the vicinity of Passamaquoddy bay Lieut. Comg. Murray made a reconnaissance in the waters around Campo Bello and Cross island, and extended soundings on a line from Grand Manan towards the main as far as Sail Rock. The several courses run in making off-shore soundings are laid down on Sketches Nos. 1and2. Saxton's metallic thermometers were used, and gave for depths of a hundred fathoms an. average. of two and a half degrees in temperature less than that found at the surface. Specimens of the bottom were preserved and the positions from which they were taken duly noted. A summary of the off-shore statistics is appended.

Other deep-sea work executed by the party·in the steamer Bibb will be mentioned under Section IY. Lieut. Oomg. Wilkinson, in returning southward from this section with the steamer Corwin, carried soundiugs on a straight course southward from Cape Elizabeth to a position six miles to the eastward of Nausett Centre light (Cape Cod peninsula.) Thirty-two casts were made with the lead, at each of which a specimen of the bottom was brought up. This line is marked on Sketch No. 2. Examination qf Scilem harbor, Jfass.-The review incidentally made at the close of the last working year being directed to but few points in the harbor, a more extended examination was made by Lieut. Comg. Murray after closing work in the northern part of the section. In reporting the results, that officer says: "All the main features and dangers in the harbor were determined in the original survey, and, with few exceptions, they arn properly delineated on the chart of 1855." Resurvey in Boston harbor.-After completing general hydrographic duty in this section a re examination was incidentally made by Lieut. Comg. 1\forray of the upper part of the inner harbor at Boston. Commencing at Mystic river, his observations were continued outwards, and in their course to a point beyond Castle island the following changes were noticed: A deposit abreast of the timber dock at the navy yard, the soundings showing two feet less of water there than the survey of 1847. A making out of the fiats between Commercial wharf and Bird Island shoals. A shoal-spit projecting from East Boston, east of the Cunard wharf; and running out into the channel. The partial wearing of Bird Island shoals. The extension of the Boston :fiats towards Bird island. Referring to a line rnn from the northeast extremity of Boston flats to the wharf east of Cunard wharf, Lieut. Comg. Murray says: "It is observable that the eighteen-feet curve has been pushed out so far that the channel is contracted at that point nearly one-third, though the depth is retained. The section from Bird· Island flats to Boston flats developed the fa.ct that the channel is moving towards the Bird Island flats, and that those ftats are diminishing in size.

THE UNITED ST.A'l'ES COAST SURVEY.

Black buoy No. 11, (off Slate Ledge,) which marks the outer edge of the Boston fiat<', now making towards Bird island, is directly in the mid-channel of 1847, which then had a depth of thirty-four feet. Now the most water found on that line at mean low tide is twenty five feet, and at the buoy sixteen feet. The channel in that vicinity has become much more serpentine, and great caution is required to prevent the heavier class of vessels from bringing up on the shoal-spits." .A. comparison line run from South Boston to Governor's island showed no changes of a marked character as having occurred since the former sun·ey. Rock in Hyannis harbor, lffass.-Tbe position of a small rock reported by Commander M. Smith, U. S. N., light-house inspector of the second district, as existing not far from the breakwater in Hyannis harbor, and the vicinity of which bad been marked by a buoy, was determined by Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson on the passage of the steamer Corwin from New York northward at the outset of the working season in thiR section. The crest of the rock wasfouud to be about eight feet square, and the depth on it three and a half feet at mean low water, increasing abruptly to twelve feet all around it. 1''rom the rock in question Great Rock spindle bears N.NW. j W., (true,) or N. by W. ft W. by compass, and is distant two hundred yards. The ranges for finding its exact po~ition are given in a communication from Lieut. Comg. Wilkinson, which I have placed in the Appendix (No. 12.) The journals of soundings and tidal observations made in the course of the examination have been sent to the office. Magnetic observations.-These were made during the month of July by Assistant Charles A. Schott, aided by Mr. J. L. Tilghman. The series extends from Portland to Cape Ann, and includes in all fifteen stations, several of which wiU be referred to under the head of Section IL In this section the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were determined at Bowdoin Hill, in Portland, Me.; at Kittery Point, opposite Portsmouth, N. H.; on Plum island, near Newburyport, and at Ipswich, Mass.; also at Beacon Hill station, near Gloucester; at the primary triangulation station, Thompson; at Annis Squam, and at Rockport, on Cape Ann. The five last-named stations were occupied for procuring data to apply to several of the harbor charts of the vicinity, and for adjusting computations of the secular change, as well as for studying local distribution on the peninsula of Cape Ann, the results, so far attained, marking that region as somewhat anomalous with respect to the magnetic elements. Observations were also made at Quebec and Montreal, as additional means for rectifying the ch~rts of isogonic lines, published in 1856. The instruments nsed were, for declination and intensity, the magnetometer, by Jones, (C. S. No. 6,) and its attached magnetic theodolite; for dip the Barrow dip circle, (C. S. No. 9 ;) time was noted on the chronometer (No. 1411) of Parkinson & Frodsham. The time and azimuth were determined by observing the sun'8 altitude and azimuth, six sets being made, and three separate observations recorded for each. For declinations the readings were generally continued through a period of three hours at each station. The intensity was ascertained from two trials, each of which gave five independent results from a hundred and fifty vibrations. .A.t three of the stations the deflections were observed to guard against possible accident to the magnet. The observations for dip consisted generally of six sets with the needles No. 1 and No. 2, the polarity being half of the time reversed.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Before setting out and after his return Mr. Schott made, at Washington, full sets of observa· tions for vibration and deflection, in order to determine the magnetic moment of intensity for magnet H. Other instrumental constants were ascertained in the same way, at the station near the Coast Survey office. The index error of the dipping needles used was determined by comparing them with many others. In the Appendix Nos. 23 and 24 the immediate results obtained by Assistant Scbott are given, and their application to questions of great interest as connected with the laws of terres,, trial magnetism. The original noteE' and his compntations have been deposited in the archives. Tidal observations.-The series heretofore referred to as continued at Charlestown, Mass., has been maintained during the past year with great regularity, by means of the self.registering gauge, kept in operation by Mr. T. E. Ready at the U. S. dry dock. Preparations have been made to occupy a permanent tidal station at Eastport, Me. SECTION II.

The operations in this section have been the following, in continuation of those of former years, and employing one triangulation party, and one double topographical, one magnetic, one tidal and current, and the occasional time of three hydrographic parties: 1. Triangulation of the Hudson river. This has been continued northward so far as to join the preliminary work of 1856 at New Baltimore. 2. Topography of the vicinity of New York, in New York and New Jersey, being in part a continuation of the surveys for the commissioners. 3. Hydrography of the Hudson river, which has been extended to above Poughkeepsie. 4. Resurvey of Ilempstead harbor, Long Island sound. 5. Resurvey of the shoal off the Battery, New York harbor. 6. Tides and current" in New York harbor and its approaches. 7. Magnetic observations. 8. Tidal observations. Office-work.-Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of coast map and chart No. 22, New York bay and harbor, and in the drawing of the map of Hudson river, from its entrance to Sing Sing. New plates of the middle and eastern sheets of the chart of Long Island sound have been engraved, and the old plate of the chart of Captain's islanas, East and West, has been re-engraved. Triang1dation ef tlte Hudson river.-The work of triangulation on this river was resumed at a station a little below Hudson, by Assistant Edmund Blunt, on the 7th of July, and has been extended northward to a junction, at New Baltimore, with the preliminary work done in 1856 between that point and Albany. .A bout fourteen miles of the course of the Hudson falls within the triangulation. In the vicinity of Y onkors fifteen stations were occupied, and data furnished to the pla.netable parties working there under 'the charge of Assistant Whiting. The progress made in both localities is shown on Sketch No. 7. Mr. Blunt was assisted in the field by Lieut. W. R. Terrill1 U. S. A., and Sub-Assistant G.

Mr. Blunt has sent to the office the records of last year's work and descriptions of the signals then observed on. Topography qf South Jamaica; vicinity of Brooklyn arul Williamsburg; High Bridge, Yonkers, and Morrisania,· and qf Hudson City, New Jersey.-The duty of filling in with details several sheets of the survey of Long Island and of the shores of Hud,;;on river in the vicinity of New York city was resumed by Sub-Assistant F. W. Dorr on the 28th of June. Messrs. Cleveland/ Rockwell, and McLane Tilton were assigned as aids in the plane-table party. After surveying a small space of the interior; to complete the sheet of the vicinity of Jamaica, Long Island, the party was divided, Mr. Dorr proceeding to Morrisania and finishing a sheet, of which he had executed the principal details in a former season, and Mr. Rockwell taking up the topography of Hudson city, New Jersey, and its environs. Amongst the additions referred to as made by Sub-Assistant Dorr were surveys of the towns of Morrisania, Melrose, and part of Mott Haven. His party was then transferred to Williams· burg, and until the 1st of October engaged upon the section bounded by Green Point, Williamsburg, and until the 1st of October engaged upon the section bounded by Green Point, Williamsburg, and Brooklyn on the west, joining with the work of the city surveyors; to the east as far as Maspetch, Evergreen cemetery, and Ea.st New York; to the Long Island railroad on the south, joining with topography executed by Assistant S. A. Gilbert; and north to the limit of previous work by Assistant H. L. Whiting. The sheets of the locality referrnd to embrace one of the most thickly settled portions of Long Island, and include the district through which flows Newtown creek and its branches. Two new wharves, erected since the former survey, at Sands' Point and Great Neck, Long Island Sound, lnd important as being the landings of steamers during the summer season, were determined in position and laid down by Mr. Dorr on the original sheets. , Under the direction of Sub-Assistant Dorr, Mr. Rockwell, after completing the survey of Hudson City, New Jersey, proceeded to High Bridge and filled in the topography required 011 the east bank of Harlem river, between that town and Kingsbridge. Part of the Croton aqueduct is represented on the sheet of that quarteo. Two sheets of the survey above and below Yonkers were then taken up, and some progress in additional details made on the one extending upwards from the town. The other, which begins half a mile below the village and extends to Spuyten Duyvel creek, including also a stretch of two miles along the Palisades on the west side of the Hudson, was completed by Mr. Rockwell on the 15th of October. Like all the other sheets worked on, the shore line, excepting a portion on one sheet, and some portions of the details, were executed previous to the outset of the present season, the features delineated being required for the finished map of New York harbor.

The early part of the surveying year was employed by Sub-Assistant Dorr in Sertion YI, and by Mr. Rockwell in Section V. The care and attention given by }Ir. Tilton in chaining for the plane-table survey are especially commended in the report of Sub-Assistant Dorr. Since the opening of the year the topographical sheets executed by this party in the last working season have been inked and sent to the office. Mr. Dorr is now preparing to return to Section VI. Topography ef Hudson river, New York.-Two plane-table parties, under the charge of Assistant H. L. Whiting, took the field on the 15th of July, for the purpose of extending the detailed survey required for the finished maps of New York harbor and Hudson river. One of these, conducted by Sub-Assistant N. S. Finney, under the immediate supervision of Mr. Whiting, advanced t11e work on both sides of the Hudson, from Spuyten Duyvel creek as far upwards as Hastings. The other party, directed by Sub-Assistant John Meehan, completed the topography on both sides of the river between Irvington and Sing Sing on the east, and from Piermont to Rock mountain on the west bank. A portion of the details between Irvington and Hastings yet remains to be filled in. Within the scope of the completed limits the survey includes the villages of Yonkers, Tarrytown, and Upper and Lower Nyack in addition to those before named; the Palisades and the shores of the Tappan Zee . .All the plane-table work executed within the season in the vicinity of New York was verified by Assistant Whiting, and is reported as being thorough in character and accurate in details. In reference to it he says: '' Great credit is due to the gentlemen who have been on duty with me, not orily during this, but in former seasons, for the zeal and interest manifested and the particular attention given.in aiming at and effecting a uniform system and style.of work." From Yonkers north and south to the limits of Mr. Whiting's work, the surrey was carried back from the shore of the river to the old post road lea.ding from New York to Albany, which, as being a well defined boundary, yet gives sufficient breadth to include all the characteristic river topography. "On the western shore of the Hudson the only feature presented is the range of the Palisades, which opposite to Yonkers attain the greatest height. The details on that side were carried back sufficiently fat to show a fringe of topography uniform in breadth with that of the lower sheets of previous years." "The character of the work generally is complex and difficult. Th-e details of contour on the eastern shore particularly were very numerous, embracing a range of hills from a hundred and fifty to four hundred feet high, with a great variety of artificial features." The parties working under the direetio11 of Assistant Whiting clo&ed field. operations on the 24th of September. Sub-Assistants Meehan and Finney, who ha.d both been employed in <lif-

Huger, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, proceeded, in the latter part of August, to determine the position of several rocks within the limits of Hempstead harbor. This duty was performed with the schooner Agassiz, manned by a part of the crew of the steamer Walker. The survey was completed before the end of September, and includes the greater part of the space passed over in the previous examination.

The general duty executed by this party will be stated under the head of Section VIII. Examination of the Battery shoal, New York harbor.-Attention having been invited in reference to the question of a decrease of depth on the Battery shoal, an examination of the vicinity was made by Lieut. Oomg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, after his return from duty at the south. The result shows that at a spot off the Emigrant Depot the present depth is only seventeen feet and a half, and that in the angle formed by the line of the battery and pier No. 1 there has been a very rapid filling up. With respect to the changes noticed there, it is added: "The three-fathom curve has been pushed outward eighty yards beyond the line of 1856; the seventeen-feet spot in the outer part of this section is extending towards pier No. 1, and there is an average decrease of three feet in depth throughout that section.'' The subject of the changes and their causes are discussed in the report of Lieut. Comg. Craven, wh'ich will be found in Appendix No. 13, with my communication to the President of the New York Chamber of Commerce, in transmitting the results of the recent examination. The action of the Chamber is given in the report of their committee, in the same Appendix. Hydrography of Hudson river, N. Y.-The soundiug of the Hudson was resumed by Lieut. Comg. C. M. Fauntleroy, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with the schooner Varina, at Newburg, where the work had been discontinued by the party -0f Lieut. Comg. Moore in a previous season. From thence upwards about fourteen miles and a half, to a point some distance above Poughkeepsie, the entire bed of the river was sounded out between the 1st of August and the close of September. Sketch No. 7 shows the particular stretch referred to. The hydrography of the Hudson is now complete from Poughkeepsie to the bar at Sandy Hook.

Tide,s and currents in New York harbor and its app1·oaches.-This work, which has been going on under my immediate direction for several sea&ons past, was completed at the end of the summer by Assistant Henry Mitchell, so far as the principal field labors are concerned. It ·was commenced with the view of ascertaining the causes of certain important changes in the hydrography of the harbor us developed by the comparison of charts of different dates. All the natural forces, such as tides, currents, winds, and waves, which might be supposed to concur in producing the physical effects noticed, were included in the series of observations, and the large amount of information thus obtained will, no doubt, when fully discussed, determine the conditions under whieh the harbor exists. In my last report reference was made to the discovery of a class of sub-currents the motions of which were found to be quite at variance with those of the surface currents. The observations made during the present season connect these sub-currents with the pat.h of the Hudson in its course through the waters of New York bay, and for their full development it was found necessary to extend the current stations about sixty miles outside of the bar, and also along the coast of Long Island. In the latter vicinity the effect of the land. waters was traced quite beyond the reach of the tidal drifts. ObBervations were made in the same quarter with a view of developing the conditions under which tbe inlets on the south shore of I,ong Island are maintained and for ascertaining the causes of their change in position. Thirty-seven current stations were occupied, the records from w!1ich contain over eight thousand observations. More than three thousand of the entries are for points below the surface. Appendix No. 26 contains the report of Assii!tant Mitchell on the season's labors. Ilis report contains remarks on improvements in the apparatus for observing currents at great depths below the surface, and refers also to an improved form of pile for securing tide-gauges on the sea-coast. Assistant Mitchell was efficiently aided by Mr. W. T. Bright. The schooner Gallatin was used in the work connected with the physical survey of New York ba.rbor . .All the original note-books and journals kept by Assistant Mitchell while prosecuting the pbservations on currents have been received and filed in the archives. ~agnetic observaticms.-In the course of a series of observations at a number of stations in $ect.ion i, Assistant C. A. Schott, aided by Mr. J. L. Tilghman, occupied several stations in the interior of New England for ascertaining the secular change, and in order to determine the precise location of the isogonic lines, charts of which were published in 1856. The declination, dip, and intensity were determined at Hartford, Conn.; at Springfield, Chesterfield, and :Pe~rfieid, ¥ass., and at Rutland, Vt. Details have been given under Section

I in regard to the instruments used at all the stations, and as to the method pursued in observ· ing for the several magnetic elements. The results obtained are set forth at length in the Appendix Nos. 23 and 24. Mr. Schott has deposited his notes and computations in the office. Tidal observations.-The self· registering tide gauge at Governor's island, New York harbor, has been kept in operation by Mr. R. T. Bassett. Interruptions in the series during the winter were met by observations with an ordinary box-gauge at the Atlantic ferry dock, in Brooklyn.

SECTION III.
FROM CAPE HENLOPEN TO CAPE HENRY, INCLUDING THE COAST DF PAR1' OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND THE COAST OF .MARYLAND AND PART OF VIRGINIA.-(SxJl'TCH C, No. 9.)

One triangulation, one triangulation and topographical, one topographical and one hydro· graphic party have been employed in this section. 1. The triangulation of the Potomac river has been continued from the entrance to Brittan's bay. 2. Triangulation of Hampton Roads, This has been connected with the main work of the Chesapeake, and a base of verification for the deta..:hed triangulation between Richmond and Old Point has been measured. 3. Triangulation and topography of Chincoteague and Sinepuxent bays. This tertiary triangulation was necessary from the scarcity of points furnished by the secondary. 4. .A plane-table survey of the Patuxent river, giving merely the shore-line for purposes of the hydrography, and leaving the usual interior work for subsequent filling up, was carried from Holland's Point to Hall's creek. 5. The topography of St. Mary's river was continued to a point about eight miles above its entrance into the Potomac, and St. Inigo's was also included to the distance of about a mile and a half from its mouth. 6. Topography of Milford Haven and Horn and Winter harbors and the vicinity, Chesapeake bay. 7. Shore-line of James river from Coggin's Point to Little Brandon, completing the shoreline and hydrography of the James and .Appomattox riven; from Richmond and Petersburg to the mouth of the river on Chesapeake bay. 8. Hydrography of the Patuxent river to Hall's creek. 9. The hydrography of the St. Mary's river was completed, and its approaches and Cornfield harbor sounded.

10. The outstanding hydrography of the James river was also finished this season. 11. The hydrography of Big and Little Annemessex rivers, connecting with the work of Tangier sound, was completed. 12. The tidal obRervations at Old Point and at the Washington navy yard were continued with the self-registering gauges. Ojfice-work.-Tbe chart of York river, from King's creek to West Point, has been drawn and engraved. The topography and lettering of coast maps and charts No. 31, Chesapeake bay, from it1:1 head to Magothy river, and No. 33, from Hudson river, Md., to the Potomac; of the finished chart of Patapsco river, and the outlines of coast map and chart from Green Run inlet

to Little Machipongo inlet, (from a photographic redur.tion,) have been engraved. Progress has
been made in the drawing and engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 35 and 36, from Pocomoke sound to the entrance of Chesapeake bay; in the drawing of general coast chart No. IV, from Cape May to Currituck sound; of coast maps and charts Nos. 28 and 29 (the latter mainly by photography) from Cape Henlopen to Little Machipongo inlet; No. 33, Chesapeake bay, the sheet of James river, from Richmond to City Point, and coast map and chart No. 37, from Cape Henry to Currituck sound; and also in the engraving of coast maps and charts No. 32, Chesapeake bay, from Magothy to the Hudson, Md., and No. 34, from the Potomac to Pocomok'e sound. Examinat-ion qf stations on Oliesapeake bay.-The duty of examining the stations of the trian· gulation, which includes both shores of the Chesapeake bay, was performed in October and November by .Assistant G. D. Wise, who commenced at the head of the bay, and visited all but a few in the series connected with the work done in its lower part. ''The stations were found in much better preservation on the low lands of the eastern shore than on the higher lands of the western. Lieut. Seward, who examined them in 18541 had marked them so securely that in no case had the marks been removed except from natural causes." :Mr. Wise used the schooner Howell Cobb in this service. He has turned in sketches of the stations, and full descriptions and references to guide in finding the marks in future. The duty conducted under his direction in the former part of the surveying season will be stated under the head of Section VII. Triangulation ef the Potomac river, Va.-The stations necessary for extending the triangulation of the Potomac upwards, from the mouth of the St. Mary's to Britton' s bay, were selected by Assistant John Farley in the latter part of October, 1858. His party used the schooner Guthrie in that service for transportation. Frequent storms retarded the general operations, and the observations with the theodolite were also much hindered by unfavorable weather. This triangulation, as may be seen on Sketch No. 9, stretches up the Potomac to Tower Hill, a distance of about nine miles from the station occupied last year on George's island. On the lower side of the river three stations were occupied at the mouth of its branch known as the Yeocomico. Mr. Farley was assisted in the field by Sub-Assistant S. A.. Wainwright. An abstract from the records gives the following summary of statistics: Stations occupied · · · · · , · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 10 Angles measured · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .. · . . . . . 24 Number of observations · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . . . . . . . . 696 Assistant Farley was employed until the 20th of December in the measurement of angles, and used for that purpose the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 76. As the work: advanced he furnished points additional to those determined in 1857 for the plane-table ·survey of the St. Mary's river. An area of about thirty-seven square miles is comprised within the limits of the season's work on the Potomac. The occupation of the party at a subsequent period of the surveying year will be stated under the next head in this chapter. During 'the intervals between the seasons for field duties the computations of the triangu·

lation were kept in hand by Mr. Farley and completed. These, with an abstract of the results and duplicates of the records of horizontal angles, are now in the office. 'Triangulation qf Hampton Roads, Va.-Tbe triangulation, whichJ:ias advanced steadily downwards from City Point towards the mouth of the James river, has been conn<:~cted with the main work on Chesapeake bay by a series of triangles carried over Hampton Roads by Assistant Farley. The junction was made on the line, Old Point Comfort-Willoughby, at the entrance of the river, as shown on Sketch No. 9. For the purpose of verifying the entire triangulation between Richmond, Va., and Old Point Comfort., a base was measured in May at a point on the north side, and about fifty miles above the mouth of the James river. One of the intermediate stations used in the iriangulation corresponds with a terminus of the base, and both termini were connected 'With the station at Claremont, on the south side of the river.-(Scc Sketch.) The computations resulting from the data for the verification of the work are now in progress. The triangulation and operations connected with the measurement of the base near Claremont occupied the party until the 22d of June. The schooner John Y. Mason, which had been employed in the work, then returned to Baltimore. Sub-Assistant Wainwright assisted Mr. Farley in the several localities in which his party was engaged in this section.

The record of horizontal angles, notes kept during the measurement of the verification base, and descriptions of the signals used this season, have been furnished by Assist.ant Farley. Triangulation and topography of Chincoteague and Sinepuxent bays, Md. and Va.-Ati a basis of the plane-table survey north of Chincoteague inlet, Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson made, in the latter part of June, a careful reconnaissance and tertiary triangulation between Snead Signal (Sketch No. 9) and Robbins's Point, on the main coast of Maryland. The two stations Hardy and Snead, erected in the secondary triangulation of 1849 1 being found undisturbed in position, were reoccupied, and six others chosen for connecting .A.ssateague island with the coast. In the selection of the sites full attention was given to the requirements of the topography, and also to the means for rendering the stations permanent, for purposes of future reference. This triangulation extends about twenty-one miles north and east from Chincoteague inlet. Exclusive of the sta.tions occupied with the theodolite, five points were determined in position for plane-table reference. The statistics of the triangulation are as follows: Stations occupied . · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·, · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · ·. · . . . . 8 Angles measured ..... · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · , · · · · · · · · . . . . . . . 24 Number of observations·.· .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · ·. · .. · ...... 1, 100 Mr. Ferguson used in this work the six-inch Brunner theodolite, C.

Sub-Assistant Ferguson had been previously employed in Section VI. The schooner Dana was used in the triangulation and topography of Chincoteague bay. In the course of the season the plane-table sheet of Chincoteague island and vicinity, surveyed last year, was inked and sent to the office. Plane-table survey of the Patuxent river, :J:ld.-As a basis for completing the supplementary soundings required in the Patuxcnt, Assistant I. Hull Adams started on the 19th of April, at Holland's Point, and traced both shores of that river northward to Hall's creek, using points furnished by the triangulation of Lieut. J. P. Roy, U. S. A. The mouths and lower portions of Swanston creek and Hunting creek were included in the working sheet, on which were also marked the steamboat landings at Benedict, Trueman's Point, Holland's cliff, Magruder's Ferry, and Lower Marlboro'. About fourteen miles of the course of the Patuxent (Sketch No. 9) are represented on the map of this season. The length of shore-line traced and furnished to the hydrographic party is about thirty-seven miles. This service was completed by the 16th of May, when the plane-table party in the schooner Dana was transferred for similar duty to the James river, Va. The stations used in the triangulation of the Patuxent were visited by Assistant .Adams, and found in good preservation. Topograpliy qf St. Mary's river, Md. -This work was begun by Assistant Adams on the 17th of November, 1858, and prosecuted until the end of that year. The limit reached corresponds to the upper line of the plane-table sheet marked on Sketch No. 9. Both sh.ores of the river were traced upward, the eastern from Ket's Point, and the opposite side from the southern shore of George's island, respectively, to Milborne's wharf. This point is nearly eight miles above the entrance into the Potomac. .A.bout four miles above its mouth the St. Mary's river receives from the eastward St. Inigo's creek, the course of which was traced by Mr · .A.dams to the distance of a mile and a half. The shores of Oarthagena creek, emptying in on the western side, were also defined for some distance. The shore-line traced on the working sheet makes an aggregate of thirty-eight miles within an area of about twenty-eight square miles. This survey is based on the triangulation executed by Assistant John Farley in 1857. Assistant .A.dams was aided in the plane-table work by Mr. J. G. Macawley. Progress in the field was much hindered by heavy rains, fogs, and gales of wind. The sounding of the lower part of the St. Mary's was executed in the latter part of the

surveying season of 1857-' 58, as stated in my last annual report. Sketch No. 14, accompanying this report, shows the result of the labors of the :field and by hydrographic parties. Mr. .A.dams discontinued work on the 5th of January, and proceeded to Baltimore in the schooner John Y. Mason, which had been in the service of bis pariy on the St. Mary's. The vessel was 11oon after transferred to the party of Assistant Farley and employed in the triangulation of Hampton Roads, as already stated. Assistant Adams is now preparing to return and fill in the details required for a finished map of the St. Mary's. Topography of Mi?ford haven, and Horn and Winter harbors and vicinity, Ohl:sapeal·e bay, Va.The survey of the western shore of the Chesapeake, between Rappahannock river and York river, was resumed by Assistant John Seib on the 15th of August, with a party in the schooner John Y. Mason. Two sheets, connecting at the Wolf Trap, will contain the detailed topography of the Piankatank river, Hill's bay, Milford haven, Haven creek and its branches, Garden creek, Horn harbor, Winter harbor, Mobjack bay, with East, North, Ware, and Severn rivers, and the western shore of Chesapeake bay from Cherry Point southward to New Point Comfort. In most of these localities the plane-table work was completed by the end of October, leaving only :he three last-named rivers and Hill's bay for survey in the next year. The limits of both sheets are marked on Sketch No. 9. When these are completed, there will remain outsta11ding only a few small detached portions of topography on the shores of the Chesapeake, which can be readily finished without applying the entire working season of the party which has been heretofore employed on it. Reference will be made under Section V to the previous occupation of Mr. Seib.

Share-line 3Urve:y of James river, Va.-On closing the la.st plane-table operations on this river, the shares of a stretch extending about five miles between Coggin's Point and Little Brandon yet remained to be traced in order to complete the preliminary survey. This duty was executed in the latter part of May and early part of the following month, by Assistant Adams, after closing work on the Patuxent, to which reference has already been made. The entire course of the Ja~es river, from its entrance upward to City Point, lms now been traced, and the shores of its two branches above, to Richmond on the main stream and to Petersburg on the .A.ppomattox. The stretch represented on the sheet of this season (Sketch

Before resuming the work, with a view of extending the soundings upward so as to complete a chart of the river, some discrepancies being noticed in the determination of the positions of signals used in the two operations, the hydrography was verified by new lines traversing the former work. Supplementary soundings were also made below the mouth of the river, and in the channel of the Potomac between it and Point Lookout, so as to include the small cove known as Cornfield harbor. The locality and its connection with the Chesapeake are shown on Sketch No. 9.

In regard to the capacity of the St. Mary's as a harbor, the following remarks made by Commander Muse in his report on the work done in 1857 are again quoted: "The largest vessels can enter the St. Mary's river with ease, and be well protected. Its short distance from Chesapeake bay would enable vessels to leave in the severest winters, while others remain blocked in ice at most of our large cities. At convenient distances the river is indented by bays, which admit of vessels remaining at anchor to load and unload without interfering with the main channel.''

Hydrography qf James river, Va.-.A. portion of the James river, below City Point, which had not been reached in the progress of the hydrography upward, was sounded out in August by the party of Commander Muse. The space referred to is comprised between Coggin' s Point and Little .Brandon, (Sketch No. 9,) and embraces a reach of about seven miles. This work completes the hydrography from Richmond to the entrance in Chesapeake bay.

SECTION IV.
FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF THE STATE'! OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CARQL1NA.-(8Kll:I'Oa D, No. 15.)

The primary triangulation of Pamplico sound has been resumed i11 this section; work of veri. fication in the neighborhood of the Cape Fear has been done; the topography between Cape Henry and Currituck sound has been completed; in-shore hydrography of the coast near Bogue and New River inlets has been executed, and off-shore work between Cape Lookout and Cape Fear. Notices of these several operations are given in this chapter. Office-work.-Comparative charts of the Cape Fear entrances, showing the changes from 1851 to 1858, and diagrams illustrating Gulf Stream explorations, have been drawn, and the former engraved upon stone under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Printing. Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of preliminary coast chart No. 11, from Cape Hatteras to Cape Lookout; in the drawing of No. 12, from Cape Lookout to Cape Fear; in that of coaBt map and chart No. 48, from Bogue inlet to Barren inlet; and in the engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 40 and 41, Albemarle sound. Triangufution of Pamp!,ico sound, N. 0.-The preliminaries necessary for the primary triangulation of Pamplic-0 sound were commenced early in January by Captain T. J. Cram, U.S.

OF

Top. Eng-inecrs, A8sistant Coast Survey, his party having sailed from Bflltimore on the 27th of December, with the requisite equipage, in the schooner Bancroft. Such general facts as had l1een gathered in the reconnaissance made by Major Prince, U. S . .A., in 1851, were applied by Captain Cram, who proceeded to develop from them a scheme for working, by th11 minute examination of points chosen with reference to their availability for the purposes of triangulation, as wcH as for proper connections with the main coast series to the northward and southward. To that end stat.ions at the upper part of the sound, connectin,g with the base on Bodie' s island, were selected, and signals prepared for them of the kind reqnired in the mea:mrement of primary angles. These points, and others at proper intervals on both shores of the sound, are marked on Sketch No. 15, which shows the plan as finally adopted for the triangulation. Some of the tripmfa aml signals necessary for observiJJg with the theodolite were erected, and for those which were not 8et up oaterials were prepared and fitted by the party before closing for the season. Five stations of the first order wore erected in tho course of the season, and seventeen points in all chosen by preliminary measurements. The party discontinued work on the 12th of April, and is now reorganizing under the direction of Capt. Cram for resuming and prosecuting the triangulation during the coming winter and the spring following. Venjicat,ion ef triangles in tlte vicinity ef Cape Fear, N. C.-Tbe revision of the system of small triangles laid 0·1 t on the coast of North Carolina was resumed by Assistant A. S. W ad11worth on the 10th of November, 1858, at a station about five miles north of Federal Point. Most of the signals which had been used between it and Smithville having been lost, as well as the marks at the north and south ends of the base on Smith's island, (Cape Fear,) others were established, and a new triangulation made across the mouth of Cape Fear river. The scheme of triangles as remeasured may be seen on Sketch No. 15. l!'or the purpose of verification a new base site was selected, corresponding as nearly as possible to the line measured on Smitli' s island, with the additional advantag-i that the ends are coincident with two stations used in making the triangulation from Federal Point southward in 1851. "The site passes over a level beach, and·is as permanent in character as any available line can be in that vicinity. At any state of the tide the north end is easily accessible in boats." In order to test the geodetic value of the small coast triangulation, steps will be taken as early as practicable for the measurement of the base of verification. The ends were connected with the triangulation of this season at the stations at Fort Johnston (Smithville) and Fort Caswell, as shown on the progress sketch, (No. 15.) Assistant Wadsworth closed work on the 7th of April, and reported at the office in Washington, where he made the resulting computations and duplicated his record of angles. In the field-work he used the six-inch Brunner theodolite C. S. No. 59.

The latter part of the season ·was more than usually unfavorable for field-work in the vicinity of Cape Fear. In .July Mr. WadRworth proceeded to Section I, and engaged in the topography of Casco bay. Topograpl1y between Cape Henry, Va., and Cnrrituck 8ound, J.."'. C.-The entire outer coast line of Virginia, and the region immediately adjacent to it, from Cape Henry and Lynn Hav"n bay south ward to the boundary line, in connection with the district comprising the upper part of Currituck sound, have been passed over with the plane-table by Sub--~ssistant John Meehan, and the details inch1ded within the limits referred to lia ve been completed. On the outer coast of North Carolina the work of this season was extended to a junction, at Fresh Pond Hill, with surveys made in previous years by the late Assi11tant J. J. 8. Hat'ls1er, mention of whose death was made in my last annual report. The point referred to lies about thirty-one mileR below Cape Henry. The upper shores of Currituck sound, the eastern shore of Knott's iRland, and the western side of Back bay, had been traced by Mr. Has;;ler, who also executed some detached portions of topography while prosecuting the triangulation in the direction of Cape Henry. Sub-Assistant Meehan took the field on the 25th of November, and was aided during the season by Mr. F. R. Hassler. Bad weather prevailed generally while the party was at work; out by employing the unfavorable intervals in chaining and in ordiuary plane-table determinations, the details of four topographical sheets were filled in by the e:wl of May, completing the survey between .Albemarle sound and Cape Henry. In going south"·ard from Chesapeake bay,· the work of this season embraces the continuous shores of Lynn Haven river and inlet, Long creek, Broad bay, and Linkhorn bay, which separates the desert of Cape Henry from the interior. To the southward was traversed a closely-settled belt of coast, broken only b~- Rudy inlet, which is about seven miles from Cape Henry light-l1ouse. Lower down, North bay, and, in connection with it, the eastern shore and the islands of Back bay, were surveyed, as also Knott's island and Mackay's i8land, in the upper part of Currituck sound. On the sheet containing the survey of Back bay is represented a feature of the outer coast which has been often mistaken for Cape Henry when seen from veBRels approaching the land. Its position, as well as the limits of the several sheets now under notice, are marked on Sketch No. 15. The following remarks are made in reference to this vicinity in the report of Mr. :Meehan : "Back bay is divided from the ocean on the east by a sand beach, the southern extremity of which is dotted with high sand dunes, and oak, pine, and cedar hummocks, containing the huts of numerous wreckers and fishermen, and known as the ' Wash Woods.' Further north are the 'Wash Flats,' a low smooth strand, so near the general level of the sea as to be submerged during strong easterly gales. When viewed from a vessel at sea, it seems a continuation of the ocean, and, with the high sand-hill range and trees of the 'Wash Woods,' presents so near a resemblance to the entrane~ of the Chesapeake at Cape Henry as to have been often taken for it, with disastrous effects; hence it is called 'False Cape,' or the 'False Cape of the Chesapeake.' The sand dune.ii at Cape Henry are in some places eighty-five feet above the ocean level." From the upper part of Currituck sound, the plane-table work was extended northward to a point two miles above Pungo bridge, so as to include the shores of North river, an important

On his return from this section, Sub-Assistant Meehan was assigned to duty in the vicinity of New York city. In the course of the summer the sheets of the region between Cape Henry and Currituck were inked and sent to the office. Hydrographic.-Qtfice-wo1·k.-Two sheets containing the soundings executed during the sur· veying year 1857-'58, in Pamplico sound, have been received from Commander W. T. Muse, U. S. N., and registered in the archives. In-shore hydrography between Bog'll-13 irdd and New River inlet, coast qf North Garolina.-ln continuation of the hydrography extending from Cape Lookout towards Cape Fear work was resumed on the 6th of April by Lieut. Comg. Alex'r Murray, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, at Bogue inlet, and carried down the coast of North Carolina at favorable intervals between that date and the 1st of June. A stretch of about thirteen miles coastwise, terminating as shown on Sketch No. 15 at New River inlet, was travereed by lines parallel to the shore and crossed by others going off to an aY'jrage distance of ten miles from the land. This duty was executed in the surveying steamer Bibb. The following synopsis of statistics was returned by Lieut. Comg. ~furray at the end of the season: Miles run in sounding· · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · - · · . · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 232 Angles determined··· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · 714 Number of soundings· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 3, 262 Off-shore soundings, from Oape Lookout, N. 0.-While prosecuting the in-shore hydrography with the steamer Bibb, Lieut. Comg. Murray, ran, at favorable int~rva1s, several lines to the northward of Cape Hatteras and others between Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, in order to furnish data for filliug the project of the general coast chart No. V. At the termination of a line carried broad off between Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout a specimen of bottom was brought up in the axis of the Gulf Stream, the Massey sounding apparatus, used in that instance, indicating a depth of 2, 059 fathoms. The material found was grayish mud or clay. In reference to the current uuderrunning the Gulf Stream, Lieut. Comg. Murray remarks: "The wind was N.E. and light; the steamer lay with her head to the southward and eastward, and the line went from the stern, tending to the northward, but upon reeling it up we discovered that an uudercurrent had carried it to the southward. This occurred twice under similar circumstances.''

The party in the steamer Bibb, after its return from this section, refitted at New York and passed the remainder of the season in prosecuting the general hydrography of Section I. SECTION V.
FROM CAPE FEAR TO ST. MARY'S RlVE'R, INCLUDING PA.RT OF THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA., AND THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA.-(SKETCn E, No. 16.)

The usual number of parties has been employed in this section, namely: one m making astronomical and magnetic observations, one in primary and secondary triangulation and in astronomical and magnetic observations, one in secondary triangulation, one in secondary triangulation and topography, two in topography, and two in hydrography. The work accom· plished is stated under the following heads: 1. Astronomical and magnetic observations near Cape Fear entrance. 2. Triangulation and topography westward of Tubbs' inlet, N. C. 3. Astronomical and magnetic observations at St. Helena island, S. C. 4. Primary triangulation, coast of South Carolina. 5. Triangulation of Beaufort, Chechessee, and Colleton rivers, 8. C. 6. Triangulation of Doboy and Altamaha sounds, Ga.-· 7. Shore-line survey from St. Helena sound, S. 0., to Savannah river entrance. 8. Topography of St. Catherine's sound, Ga. 9. In-shore hydrography from Cape Fear westward to Tubbs' inlet, N. C. 10. Off-shore hydrography from Cape Fear to Charleston harbor. 11. Hydrograpby of Bull's bay, S. C. 12. Hydrography of Port Royal entrance, S. C. 13. Hydrography of the Checbessee and Colleton rivers, S. C. 14. Hydrography of Sapelo bar and its approaches, Ga. 15. Tidal observations. O.ffice-work.-In the drawing and engraving divisions, additions have been made to the chart of Charleston harbor. The chart of Sapelo sound has been drawn and engraved and the engraving of preliminary coast chart No. 14, from Cape Romain to Savannah, has been in hand. Progress has been made in the drawing of coast mapR and charts No. 53, from Charleston harbor to St. Helena sound, and No. 58, from St. Mary's river to the St. John's, Fla., and in that of the chart of Ossabaw sound. Latitude observations at Smithville, N. 0.-The adjustment of the triangulation on the coast of North Carolina requiring that the latitude of a point in the vicinity of Cape Fear shonld be closely determined, as well as the azimuth, an astronomical party was organized on the 1st of .April, under my immediate direction, and placed in charge of Assistant G. W. Dean. A station was erected at Fort Johnson, Smithville, N. C., and the necessary preliminaries for astronomical work were arranged by Mr. Thomas McDonnell. Sub·Assistant Edward Goodfellow was detailed to assist in the observations. Those for the latitude and time were made by him with the zenith telescope C. S. No. 5, and forty-six-inch transit C. S. No. 4. With the first-mentioned instrument twenty-nine pairs of stars were observed by one hundred and seventy-four sets of observations. Fourteen Atandard stars were observed on with the transit, and ninety-six observations recorded. The value of the micrometer threads was ascertained by one hundred and twenty-two observations on the star 51 Cephei, near its western elongation. Forty-six observations were made with the micrometer upon a collimator adjusted to a stellar

focus, for determining the arc value of graduations on the level of the zenith telescope, and the corresponding divisions of the transit instrument were tested by comparisons with it . .As far as practicable, the stars observed for latitude were taken from the Greenwich Twelve Year Catalogue, the sets, as heretofore, being completed from that of the British .Association. :Mr. W. H. Odenheimer aided Sub-Assistant Goodfellow, and recorded the observations. Unusually good weather prevailing during the stay of the party, all the requisite determinations were completed by the 7th of May. .Azimuth.-The azimuth for the lines of the triangulation was determined by .Assistant Dean'. For that purpose nine sets of observations were made with the twenty-four-inch theodolite ( C. S. No. 2) on Polaris at its lower culmination, and six sets on 8 Ursae Jiinori8 near its eastern elongation. In each series six paintings were made on the star with the telescope direct, and the same number with the instruments reversed. A.n elongation mark was set up and connected in the usual way with the triangulation, twelve sets of pointings being made on it with the telescope direct and reversed. The mark was referred to three geodetic signals by four hundred and thirty-six observations made at six different periods, each embracing the observations of an entire day. In making them the circle of the instrument was used in five different positions. The azimuth observations were recorded hy Mr. McLane Tilton. Magnetic observations at Smithville, N. G.-For the declination of the needle at the astronomical Rtation (Fort Johnson) one hundred and forty-seven observations were made on three days by .Assistant Dean and Sub-AssiRtant Goodfellow. Four sets were made on three days for the magnetic dip, and two sets on two days for the horizontal intensity and moment of inertia. The im;truments used were declinometer D. 22 (C. S. No. 1) and the uine-inch dip circle C. S. No. 4. ~ The usual meteorological journal was kept by Mr. Tilton, while the observations were going on for latitude, azimuth, and the magnetic elements. Imm~diate1y after the return of the party the records kept at the astronomical station were duplicated by Sub-Assistant Goodfellow and placed in the archives, with his computation for latitude, with that of Mr. Dean for azimuth, and lists of the stars used in observing for latitude. In June the party was transforred to Section I, and remained until the close of the season under my personal direction, as stated in a previous chapter of this report. Triangulation and topography westward ef Tubbs' inlet, N. 0.-The coast triangulation below Cape Fear has been extended westward by .Assistant C. P. Bolles, to the immediate vicinity of the boundary line between North and South Carolina. The details of the plane-table work:, which has been prosecuted in connexion with it, have been completed to Tubbs' inlet, and the shore-line survey advanced westward to Little river, (Sketch No. 16,) or near the present limit of the· triangulation. On the 10th of December work was resumed at Shallotte inlet, Mr. 0. Hinrichs, the aid in the party, conducting the topographical survey, while Mr. Bolles carried forward the triangulation. Most of the angular measurements were made with the six-inch Brunner theodolite C. S. No. 67.

In the principal series eighteen angles were determined, the last being formed at a station a short dist..,nce above Tubbs' inlet. From thence southward and westward to Little river, the smaller chain of triangles was completed to serve as a basis for the topography. The impeuiments from standing wood and undergrowth on this part of the coaRt increase the natural difficulty of laying out and determining primary lines which pass over a level surface. Avenues, making in the aggregate an extent of more than fourteen miles, were traced and opened by the party so as to admit of observing with the theodolite. Assistant Bolles furnished in the course of the working season the data requisite for fixing the positions of shore stations for the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead. The_ plane-table work comprises the following statistics: Beach-line surveyed· · · · .... · . · · · · · · · .. · . · ............ · · · · · . 21.6 miles.

Shore-line was furnished as needed for the in-shore hydrography, which was in progress at the same time. Six volumes containing the original records of horizontal angles measured in extending the field-work westward from Cape Fear have been placed in the archives, as also the topographical sheet executed last year under the direction of Assistant Bolles. A8tronomwal and magnetic observations at St. Hel.ena L~land, S. G.-As part of the duty devolving on his party in this section, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle set up the zenith telescope C. S. No. 5, and transit No. 3, at Port Royal station on St. Helena island, and made a series of observations for latitude between the 8th of January and the 1st of March. Both instruments were supported by wooden posts set three feet in the ground and strongly trussed by cross and diagonal braces above and below ground. The azimuth also was determined at the same station with the twenty-four-inch theodolite 0. S. No. 2, and Gambey theodolite C. 8. No. 43, an artificial horizon being employed in making the observations with the last-named instrument. For local time observations were made at intervals from January 8 to May 7 in:::lusive, with transit No. 3, in connexion with the sidereal chronometer No. 207, and the solar chronometers Nos. 211, and 2,458. For latitude six hundred and seventy·eight observations were made on sixty-two pairs of stars. The places of forty-eight were taken from the Twelve Year, and the rest from the catalogue of the British Association. Seventy-two observations for value of the micrometor in the zenith telescope were made upon four elongations of Polaris. The value of levels A and B were determined in terms of the micrometer by a hundred and twenty observations on the cross hairs of a sector set up fifteen feet north of the zenith telescope and used as a collimator. Between the 10th of February and the 16th of March ten elongations of Polaris were observed in the usual manner for azimuth. Two hundred and sixty-three observations were made on star and mark, and one hundred and eighty-six for connecting the elongation mark w·th itations in the second~ry triangulation.

For local time three hundred and thirty-nine transits were observed on sixty-one nights between January 8 and May 7. Mr. Boutelle also observed a series of azimuths upon Polaris in various parts of its orbit, making thirty-three sets of four repetitions each on three nights. These formed imgles between Chaphir signal and the star, and were observed alternately direct and reflected in a mercurial horizon. The po8ition of the astronomical 8tation on St. Helena island, and its connections with the coast triangulation are shown on Sketch No. 16. The declination of the magnetic needle at Port Royal station was determined with the declinometer C. S. No. 5, by two hundred and thirty-six observations made in parts of ten days lJetween January 23 and February 5, on two collimator m13gnets. For the dip, the circle No. 9 was used, and ninety-six observations were recorded. In the astronomical work, and in the general operations yet to be referred to, Mr. Boutelle was assisted by Lieut. Thomas Wilson, U. S. A., Assistant Coast Survey, and Sub-Assistant W. S. Edwards. Mr. C.H. Boyd was attached to the party as aid. Duplicates of the rccordti of observations made this season for latitude, azimuth, and time have been deposited in the office. :Mr. Boutelle has also turned in his revised computation for the latitude of .Allston station, determined in a previous season. Primary triangulation, coast of South Carolina. -For the extension of the series of primary triangles southward and westward from the Edisto base and in the direction of Savannah, Assistant Boutelle erected a tripod and scaffold at Port Royal station, and made the preliminary measurements necessary for including a point in the city of Beaufort, S. 0., in the general scheme. The positions of these, as falling in with the chain of work already completed, may be seen in the progress sketch (No. 16) of the section. The lines to be observed on in carrying the main triangulation across St. Helena island were partly traced and cleared for the measurement of horizontal angles while other operations were going on. This service was performed by Sub-Assistant Edwards, under the direction of Mr. Boutelle. The party reached its working ground in the schooner Petrel from Charleston, at which port the vessel had been laid up during the winter. Lieut. Wilson, U. S. A., and Mr. C. H. Boyd, assisted in the duties now under notice, and in those to be mentioned under the next head. The records of the primary triangulation of previous years have been deposited in the archives. Triangul,ation of Beatifort, Checkessoo, and Colleton rivers, S. 0.-From its entrance into Port Royal sound, Assistant Boutelle laid out and completed by the 19th of April the triangulation of Beaufort river upwards to the city of Beaufort. The length of water course included in that work is about twenty-nine miles. His party was then transferred in the schooner Petrel to Foot Point, and in that vicinity a triangulation was carried from Broad river up the Chechessee and its branch known as the Colleton river. The triangles were madet o extend about two miles and a half above Foot Point and four miles below it, so as to provide for the topographical survey, and for hydrographic purposes, reference to which will be made hereafter.

The eight-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 24, and ten-inch Gambcy, C. S. No. 43, were used in the augular measurements. In the several operations prosecuted between the Edisto base and Foot Point :Mr. Boutelle was assisted by Lieutenant Wilson and Sub-Assistant Edwards. Mr. C. H. Boyd was attached to the party as aid. The schooner Petrel was despatched for New York on the 16th of' ~Ia.''i and was there re· paired and refitted for the continuance of work in the coming season. While the triangulation party was at work in Februar_\-, the United States steamship Brooklyn passed into Port Royal sound and an.;hored near the Parry island buoy, between Broad and Beaufort rivers. Assistant Boutelle visited the vessel, and, as no professional pilots are known in that vicinity, tendered his services in conducting her up Beaufort river. The offer being accepted by Captain Farragut, of the Brooklyn, the steamer was moved to a position within four and a half miles of the city of Beaufort, and there anchored. A communication addressed to me by Captain Farragut, in reference to his visit in Port Royal sound, is given in Appendix No. 38 . .After reporting at the office, Assistant Boutelle proceeded to Section I. His occupation during the summer and autumn has been stated under that head. Lieutenant "'Wilson, on returning from Section Y, was assigned to duty in the charge of the Drawing Division, and Sub-Assistant Edwards took up plane-table work on the Kennebec river. Triangulation qf Doboy and Altamalw Soun<ls, Ga.-The secondary triangulation on the coast of Georgia has been continued southward from the Sapelo base, and between it and the work at St. Simon's entrance a preliminary connexion has been made by a series of tertiary triaugles carried along the outer range of islands below the entrance to A.ltamaha sound. Sub-Assistant F. P. Webber, wl10se operations last i;easou closed at the upper part of Sapelo island, resumed work there on the 20th of December, with a party in the schooner Hassler. The triangulation was taken up at the line which joins Julien ton with a terminus of the Sapelo base, the location of which is marked on Sketch Ko. 16. To the southward and westward stations were erected at suitable intervals, so as to include in the secondary series Mud river and North river, with their branches behind Sapelo island; Dobos sound, and Altamaha sound with the lower parts of its tributaries. A number of subsidiary stations were occupied within the same area sufficient for the purposes of a topographical survey. :Mr. Webber measured also a series of tertiary triangles, in order to define tlrn courses and direction of the ·waterpassage which separates Blackbeard ii;land from Sapelo island, and south of the 1Utamaha entrance extended a similar triangulation by observing alternately at stations on St. Simon's island in connexion with others erected on the chain lying between it and the ocean. The teu-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 63, was used in measuring the angles. At a station about thirty miles below the Sapelo base, as measured along the course of the triangulation, a junction was made with one of the tertiary lines observed on by .Assistant A. W. Longfellow in the survey of St. Simon's sound. Sub-Assistant Webber there closed for the season on the 15th of .April. It is expected that a connexiqn by triangles of the second order can be made early in the ensuing year. Mr. Julius Kincheloe was attached to the party as aid, and served efficiently in the field-work and in making computations. While the hydrographic survey of Sapelo bar was in progress, the points requisite for it were 9

It is probable that lines from four to six mileR long can be found across the opening to the west of St. Simon's island, but in proceeding southward it will be necessary to erect two or three scaffold signals, perhaps twenty-five feet high, as the lines will extend over fresh water marsh, the reeds and shrulis of whivh reach to a height of twelve and in some places twenty feet, while the hard ground is nearly level with the surface of the marsh." Records of the horizontal angles and descriptions of the signals erected this season have been received and filed in the office. The schooner Ilassler with the party of Mr. Webber reached Portland, Me., on the 2d of May, and during the summer wmi employed in work east of the Kennebec. On her outward passage to the south, the vessel was forced to take refuge in Provincetown harbor by severe gales, and while again on her way was damaged off Long Island in a storm, which also destroyed her stern boat. The necessary repairs were made at Savannah. Sub-Assi,;tant Webber is now making arrangements for returning to continue work on the coast of Georgia. Shore-line survey from St. Helena sound, S. C., to Savannah river entrancc.-This includes the outlines of tho Hunting islands, Eddings' island, the islets and water· passages between them and St. Helena island, the entire shoTe-line of Port Royal entrance, and part of that of Parry island, at the confluence of Beaufort and Broad rivers, Daw i;;laud and Colleton Neck, the outline of Hilton Head island, and the western i;hore of Calibogue souud, from Pinckney island to SaYannah river. The work was executed by Assistant John Seib, whose party arrived in the section and anchored in Harbor river on the 10th of January. .After joiniug with the plane-table smvey made in 1856 on the upper part of the Hunting islands, Mr. Seib pushed steadily in the direction of Tybee entrance, tracing, as he advanced, the shore-line of Harbor river, Fripp's inlet, Story creek, Trenchard's inlet, Skull inlet, and Pritchard's inlet. and pa1:1sing through Station creek, the preliminary work was carried into Port Royal sound. On the outer side of the islands which bound the lower part of the coast of South Carolina, the ocean-line was traced from Skull inlet to Bay Point, at Port Royal entrance. Thence, proceeding northward and westward, the shores of Port Royal sound were surveyed, from Bay Point to Land's end, as also the shores of Beaufort river to a point three miles above its mouth; the northern shore of Broad river, beyond Pany island, and its southern shore as far up as Lemon island. In that vicinity Mr. Cleveland Rockwell, the aid in the party working under my immediate direction, with a second plane-table traced the outline of Daw island; the 8hores of the Chechessee river, from Pinckney island upward to Lemon island; and the shores of Colleton river to a short distance southward of Foot Point. The tougue of land embraced between the

THE l:NITED STATES COAST srRYEY.

67

two rivers, and designated as Colleton Neck or Victoria Bluff, was surveyed somewhat in detail. A tracing from the topogra}Jhical sheet of Mr. Rockwell was furnished early in .May for the guidance of the hydrographic party in sounding out the adjacent channels, more particular reference to which will be made presently. The coutinuoml preliminary work of' As:;istant Seib iu going southwan1 from Port Royal sound embraced both shores of the pasgage known as Skull creek, between Pinckney island and Trench's or Hilton Head island; the shores of Oalibogne river, in connexion with it and with May river: and tbe shore-line of Calibogue sound, to lfungen Point. The outer side of Hilton Head island also was traced and joined with the surveys already mentioned. As measured in a direct line, the cl1ain of i:;lands included in t11e work of the sea;;on stretches about thirty-five miles below St. Helena sound. Tl1c aggregate of shore-line represented on t1ie five plane-table sheets brought from the field is about two hundred and fifty-eight miles. Four of them were worked on alternately by AEl&istant Seib and Mr. Rockwell, progress being made at the same time in inking plane-table sheets of the previous year. The limits of the sheets embracing the preliminary survey between St. Helena sound and Savannah river are marked on Sketch No. 16. Field-work was closed for the season on the 12th of May. The schooner Bailey, which had been in the service of the party, then sailed for Smithfield, North Carolina, and was transferred to Lieut. Comg. Bankhead, and employed in the hydrographic work of this section. At the end of April I visited the party of ARsistant Seib, in passing so11thward on a tour of inspection. The work then in progress, and since completed, is intricate in character and was not favored by more than an average of fair weather for field duty. The large return in results is mainly due to the constant energy of the chief of the party, and to the able support given by Mr. Rockwell. Mr. Seib was employed dnring the summer in plane-table duty in Section III, and Mr. Rockwell in Section II. In the corresponding chapters of this report notice has been taken of tho occupation referred to. Topography Qf St. Catharine's sound, Ga.-The party assigned to this work, in charge of Sub-Assistant H. S. Du Val, commenced the survey on the 27th of December and continued in the field until the 23d of May, using data furnished by the triangulation of Lieut. ~L W. Evans, U. S. A. No interruption from unfavorable weather occurred to break the plan of operations, and, as a result, the survey of the shores of the sound was essentially completed, including the shores and branches of that part of the "Inland Passage" known as Bear river, which connects St. Catharine's with Ossabaw souncl. The plane-table sheet also embraces the shores of the Medway opposite to the entrance of St. Catharine's sound, the mouth of North Newport river leading from it southward as part of the inland passage to Sapelo, and tho outer shores of Ossabaw and St. Catharine's islands, in the vicinity of the entrance. These localities, as well as the general limits of the sheet referred to, are ma,rked on Sketch No. 16. A. reconnaissan0e was made in the course of the season, and points were established for the survey of the interior of Ossabaw island, on which the work will connect with a surn~y made to the northward by Assistant A. M. Harrison iu 1857-' 58, but the advance of the season did not admit of the execution of the topographical details. These will be filled in during the coming winter, the party being about to resume duty on the coast of Georgia. The northern part of St. Catharine's island will be represented on the same sheet, and the detailed work

extended southward to meet that completed on Sapelo sound, which is already connected with it by a shore-line survey along the outer side of the island. As returned to the office the topographical sheet of St. Catharine's sound exhibits the following summary of 11rogress made by the party in charge of Sub-Assistant Du Val: Shore-line · ......... · · · .................................... .

Mr. J. D. Bradford aided iu the field-work. In June the party returned to Portland in the 8Chooner Meredith. The vessel was then transferred to the party of Assistant A. W. Longfellow for service in Casco bay. Sub-Assistant Du Val makes special mention in his report of the facilities tendered by residents on St. Catharine's island as tending to the furtherance of his work. \Yithin the present serLson Assistant Longfellow has inked and sent to the office the planetable sheet containing hi,; survey of Sapelo sound, and one of the sheets of work executed by his part.r at Brunswick lmrbor, Ga. I11-slll;rc J1ydrogmpliy from Cape Fear westward to Tubbs' inlet, N. C.-The hydrographic party detailed for duty in the northern part of this section sailed from Baltimore under the command of Lieut. Comg. J. P. Bankhead, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, in the schooner Crawford, and reached Charleston on the 7th of February. A period of stormy weather setting in made it expedient to defer the outside soundings and employ the interval in another locality, wl1ich was accordingly done, a;;; will be noticed presently. The coast soundings from Cape Fear westward to Tubbs' inlet were executed between the 5th of May and the 12th of .August, favorable intervals bei11g taken between those dates for also running off-shore lines, to be alluded to hereafter. The in-shore work connects with the completed bydrogra.phy of Cape Fear entrance and the Frying Pan shoals, and represents a space of twenty-five mile:s in length (Sketch No. 16) by rather more than ten in average breadth. Assistant C. P. Bolles, in charge of the triangulation, furnished data for establishing the shore stations required in executing the soundings.

Referring to the character of the bottom and to the capacity of the several small inlets which break the coast of North Carolina at intervals between Oak island and Tubbs' inlet, Lieut. Comg. Bankhead remarks: "The bottom is uniform in character and clear of rocks or shoals, and the shore can be safely approached, in clear weather, by any class of vessels to within one nautical mile." ''The inlets are impracticable for any but vessels of very light draught, and their bars change with every shift of wind. A few fl.at-bottomed schooners are the only vessels that

THE L:SITED STATES COAST f:ll'RYEY.

fi9

attempt the passage, and then only on tho top of high water, when not more than s1x feet can be carried in under the best of circumstances." The in-shore hydrography from Cape Fear westward was executed with the schooners Crawford and Bailey, the latter having been assigned for that duty on the close of topographical work conducted in this section by Assistant Seib. In the course of the autumn the soundings were plotted under the direction of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead, at W ashiugton, and the resulting chart left at the office. The original records and transcripts of the soundings and tidal observations made at the Cape ·Fear entrances in 1857-' 58 by the party of Lieut. Comg. T. Il. Iluger have also been received and deposited in the archives. Off-shore hydrography from Cape Fear to C!iarleston harlior.-The working season proving to be unusually stormy along the coast below Cape Fear, effective progress iu off shore soundings could he made only by employing favorable intervals, the in-shore work already referred to, being from time to time suspended for that purpose. In allusion to the precautions taken in prosecuting the off-shore hydrography from Cape Fear, southward and westward, to Charleston harbor, Lieut. Comg. Bankhead, says: "Nearly all the lines were run with a fair wind, smooth water, and in clear weather, and all the principal positions were determined by actual observation. The soundings were made with care, and of the specimens of bottom brought up such have been preserved as were at all curious or different from the general character already known.'' The following reference is made in the season's report to the probable existence of a bank off Cape Romain, the full development of which will be made in prosecuting the in-shore hydrngraphy southward from its present limit.: "I am satisfied that the continuance of the survey off Ca]'Je Romain will develop less water in some places than has been genera Uy supposed to exist. as I have found six fathoms and water breaking in heavy weather where we should have inferred a depth of nine or ten fathoms from the general chart.'' The o[4lhore soundings made by the party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead in the schooner Crawford were carried to an average depth of a hundred fathoms, or from sixty or seventy miles from the coast, and were executed between the 7th of .March and the 5th of August. During the last two months of the season every effort was made to obtain current observations, but excepting at two stations in the vicinity of Cape Fear, without success. The statistics of the off-shore hydrography are given in the following summary: Miles run in sounding . · .... · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · Number of soundings ...... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 1, 462 1, 193

.A.n unusually late period of the working season at the south having been reached, the schooners Crawford and Bailey sailed for New York, and there underwent necessary repairs. The plotting of the off-shore chart was then taken up, at the office, and completed. Arrangements are now in progress for the return of the vesl:lels and continuance of the in and off shore work in this section. Hydrography ef Bull's bay, South Carolina..-This duty was executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. Bankhead, with the shooner Crawford in March and April, the boieterous character of that part of the season not affording the usual opportunities for pushing soundings outside of the main coast. In connexion with the bay, the inland passage leading to the southward and westward, was sounded out as far as Capers' s island. The limits of the sheet containing the

70

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

hydrography are marked on Sketch No. 16. Regular tidal observations were made during the period occupied in the work. Lieut. Comg. Bankhead thus refers to Bull's bay aR a harbor of refuge: "l doubt whether it will ever be used except as a harbor of refuge for coasting vessels, for which purpose, however, it is well adapted, being easy of access, affording good holding ground, and having abundant water (in the channel) for that class of vessels. The small channels that traverse the bay are too narrow and irregular in their depth for anything but boats of the lightest draught." The following allusion to the inland passage is made in the same report: ''The inland passage connecting with the bay I find to be too narrow and crooked for any vessels other than very small steamers and flat boats, there being but one foot of water at mean low tide, and a width of only fifty feet at the narrowest part.'' The following are statistics of tlrn hydrography: Miles nm in sounding · · . · · . · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 308 Sextant angles taken .. · · .... · .. · . · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 736 Number of casts of the lead· . · · · · · · · . · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 20, 345 Area sounded (square miles) · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·

The chart of Bull's bay resulting from this work has been plotted and is now on file at the office. While engaged on l1is working ground in this section Lieut. Comg. Bankhead furnished to a deputation from Charleston, sent to examine in regard to the availability of Bull's bay for a quarantine station, such hydrographic data as could be supposed to bear on the question. Hydrograpliy ef Port Royal entrance, South Carolina.-Early in June, Lieut. Comg. C. M. Fauntleroy, U. S. N., assi~tant Coast Survey, having completed the hydrographic duty assigned in two other localities of this section, commenced an examinlation of the several channels leading into Port Royal entrance in order to determine the character of the bars. This duty was completed before the close of that month, and, after plotting the soundings, it was reported as the result of comparison that ''little or no change has occurred since the date of the hydrographic reconnaissance made in these waters by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt," (18.55.) In connexion with the hydrography of the east channel the soundings were carried northward and eastward to Hilton Head, and so extended in that vicinity as to include Joiner's hank. The limits of the work are marked in the usual way on sketch No. 16. A recommendation from Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy in regard to buoys for the east channel passage into Port Royal was communicated to the department in July, (Appendix No. 43.) The United States sloop-of-war Brooklyn, having touched on a sand-spit at the mouth of BMufort river, South Carolina, on the occassion of her visit to that branch of Port Royal 1:1ound in the early part of the season, to which allusion has been made under a previous head of this chapter, the locality in question was carefully examined by the hydrographic party. No obstruction was found in the channel which leads up the river, the point of the spit referred to being "on the port hand of the channel way, dividing it from a deep water pocket on the port hand of that again." It is hence to be concluded that when the vessel touched she had not fairly entered the channel of Beaufort river. No professional pilots were cruising in Port Royal sound at. the period of her visit.

A tidal station, as usual, was occupied for hydrographic purposes. After some needful repairs at Charleston, the Varina sailed for New York, and arrived at that port on the 8th of July. The party then took up the hydrography of Hudson river, as stated under Section II. Hydrography qf the Ghechessee and Colleton rivers, S. C.-~fter completing a survey, which will be described under the next head, the party of Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy was transferred in the schooner Varina to Broad river, S. C., and proceeded to sound out the more important parts of its tributaries, designated as the Chechessee and Colleton rivers. From the point of their junction behind Daw island, as shQwn on Sketch Ko. 16, the hydrography was carried about two miles northward and westward up the Chechcssec, and about tllree miles southward and westward in the bed of the Colleton river. The vicinity of Foot Point was thoroughly sounded, as also the Chechessee river from the point of Colleton N eek downwards about four miles to Pinckney' s island at the head of Port Royal sound or Broad river, where tho work joins with the hydro. graphy executed by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, U. S. N., in 1855. My report for that year was accompanied by a preliminary chart of Port Royal entrance, which is therein marked as Sketch No. 22. In reference to it Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy observes: "The previous survey shows that the bar of the Checl1essee river affords twenty feet at mean low water, with a mean rise and fall of 6. 6 feet. The depth increases in passing upward, and vessels that enter Port Royal sound will find in the Colleton river at the Neck, and at its confluence with the Chechessee, a capacious, completely protected and easily accessible anchorage in fr<'m four to seven fathoms water." In the Appendix (:Ko. 29) further extracts are given from the report of Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy bearing on the commercial facilities of the vicinity of Colleton Neck. This hydrographic survey followed the shore-line as traced by Mr. C. Rock· well, and was completed between the 13th and 21st of :May. The resulting sheet is now on file in the Coast Survey office. The rate of the currents was observed at two stations, and the rise and fall of the tide determined as usual, the record being made for a complete lunation.

Hydrography qf Sapldo bar and if.8 approaches, Ga.-The survey of Sape1o river and sound, including its entrance and approaches, has been completed; the supplementary soundings and requisite tidal and current observations having been made this season in the vicinity of the bar by Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy. Two vessels, the schooner Varina and steam tender Fire-Fly, were used for this service. Inside of the entrance the additional soundings were joined with the work executed in 1857-'58 by the party of Lieut. Comg, J. H. Moore, U.S. N., and from thence carried ten miles seaward to a depth of eight and a half fathoms. North and south the hydrography of the approaches was developed within a stretch of about ten miles. On the resulting chart, the limits of which are marked on Sketch No. 16, the character of the approaches is shown within an area of ninety-four square miles.

The importance of Sapelo entrance as a harbor is well Bet forth in some remarks contained in the report of Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy, extracts from which will be found in Appendix No. 30. Surveys made by this party subsequent to the completion of wo1tk at Sapelo bar have been described in this chapter, and under the head of Section II its more recent occupation has been noticed. Two sheets, containing the hydrography of Sapelo sound and river, were received from Lieut. Comg. :Moore, previous to his detachment from the Coast Survey. Tidal observations.-The permanent self.registering tide-gauge at the custom-house wharf, Charleston, S. C., under the charge of :Mr. W. R. Herron, has been kept up with great regularity throughout the year. SECTION VI.
FROM ST. MARY'S RIVER TO ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, INCLUDING THE EASTERN AND PA.RT OF THE WESTERN COAST O!i' FLORIDA, WITH TH~ FLORIDA REEFS AND KEYS.-(SKET(JH F, No~. 2() and 21.)

The progress made in the survey of the Florida reefs and keys has permitted additional parties on the main coast. There have been at work in this section-one party on the line across the head of the peninsula; one triangulation party near St. Augustine; one near Indian river; one on the inner keys, between Cards' Sound and the Gulf of Florida; one in Charlotte harbor; one topographical party on the coast of Key Biscayne and Cards' sound and the keys near Cape Sable; one at Charlotte harbor; one hydrographic party upon the reef and in the Florida channel and Gulf Stream. Observations of the tides have been completed at three stations, and the permanent tidal station at the Tortugas has been kept up for comparison. The following chapter gives an account of the operations of these several parties, under distinct heads, as follows: 1. Air-line triangulation across the Florida peninsu!a. 2. Triangulation of St. Augustine harbor and North river, Florida. 3. Triangulation of Indian river inlet, Florida. 4. Triangulation of the Florida keys. 5. Triangulation of Charlotte harbor, Florida. 6. Topography.-Key Bie.cayne bay, Cards' sound, and Florida keys, near Cape Sable. 7. Topography of Charlotte harbor, Florida. 8.

Office-work.-Progress has been made in the drawing and engraving of coast map a11d chart No. 68, Florida reefs from Key Biscayne to Carysfont reef, and in the drawing of Nos. 70, 71, and 72, Florida reef and keys from Long key to ::llfa~quesas key. Air-line triangulation ac:ross the Florida peninsula.-This work was resumed in January, and continued until the 4th of June. The party engaged in its prosecution was conducted by Capt. M. L. Smith, U. S. Topogra]Jhical Engineers, Assistant Coast Survey. Messrs. J. S. Bradford and ,V, H. Gardner were assigned as aids at the outset of the season, and Mr. J. C. Young before its close. In allusion to the progress made and impediments found as the triangulation advanced southward and westward from Big creek and Padgett station, both of which are shown on Sketch No. 20, Capt. Smith remarks: ''It was supposed at the commencement of the season that the ground to be passed over would prove more favorable than that met with during the previous year, hut the contrary was the case. New River swamp, which, according to the maps of the interior, our lines should have missed, covers much of the ground traversed by one of the sides of each triangle. The section of country through which they pass is more or less densely timbered, and the lines forming their sides had to be opened foot by foot with the axe. When it is considered that thick pine woods offered the most favorable cutting required in carrying the work forward, the remainder and about an equal portion being through the swamps and matted bogR of the south, the extent of the labor may be judged of. The opening of the lines constitutes the main item of expense attending the triangulation." Mr. J. S. Bradford was in active charge of the party under the direction of Capt. Smith, and is mentioned, in conjunction with Messrs. Gardner and Young, as having pressed the work with constant energy and interest. In opening the lines, which stretch in the aggregate a hundred miles, the patient endurance of the aids was such as to call forth the warm commen · <lat.ion of the chief of the party. The work has now advanced from Fernandina about eighty miles in the direction towards Cedar keys, and two more seasons' work, with favorable weather, will probably complete the line; but with impediments like those encountered this year it would require throe. Operations were closed for the season at Waldo station, which is about twer1ty-eight miles southwest of the station at which the triangulation was reRumed in January. Five signals were erected, and ninety angles measured in extending the triangulation to its present limit. A topographical sheet, embracing the tract over which the season's work exter.ds, has been filed in the office. Triangulation Qf St. Augustine harbor and North river, Fla.-The survey of the western coast of Florida was commenced on the 4th of January by Sub-Assistant Benjamin Huger, jr., in the vicinity of St. Augustine. After selecting a site suitable for a base line on the pine barren about a mile west of the city, a triangulation was laid out to extend over the harbor, and north and south of it along the coast. The preliminary base was measured early in June with the contact slide apparatus d(>vised by Assistant Hilgard, and deHcribed in rny report for 1857. Sketch No. 20 shows the location of the line, and also the system of triangles connected with it. The angles were determined with the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 74. Above St. Aug11stine the completed triangulation stretches twenty miles, and embraces throughout that distance the course of the North river. The scheme was laid out and signals erectefl aloug the shores of :Matanzas river for carrying the work twelve miles i:;outhward from

the base, but the late period of the season reached in the performance of that service made it necessary to postpone the measurement of the angles until the coming winter. Mr. Rufus King, jr., served as aid in the triangulation party. The progress made in the field-work is exhibited by the summary of statistics given below: Stations occupied· · · · ......... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Signals observed on · ..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Angles measured · · · · .·..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Num her of observations ..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area of triangles, (square miles)· . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·

Field operations were continued in the neighborhood of St. Augustine until the 23d of June. Sub-Assistant Huger, after returning to the north, duplicated and turned in the records of his observations, and then commenced the computations connected with the work. In the latter part of April, while on a tour of inspection at the south, I visited the site then occupied by the triangulation party, and was gratified with an examination of the arrangements for working in accordance with the plan laid out. In reporting on the progress of the party, Mr. Huger expresses his obligation to G. R. Fairbanks, osq., Yice president of the Florida Historical Society, for information in regard to localities falling within the limits of its operations. The arrangements of the party are now in progress for returning to extend the coast triangulation southward from St. Augustine. Triangidalion qf Indian River inlet, Fla.-In the field arrangements made at the opening of the surveying year a new centre of work was selected for extending the triangulation of the eastern coast of the Florida peninsula, the execution of the details being entrusted to SubAssistant J. A. Sullivan. The intention of commencing in the immediate vicinity of Cape Canaveral, and pushing the work towards St. Augustine, was found to preEent greater obstacles without a corresponding advantage over a beginning made lower down tae coast, and in consequence the party proceeded to Indian River inlet. Mr. Sullivan made a reconnaissance in the middle of January for a base site and for stations to connect with it, so as to lead either northward or southward, mi might prove most expedient in prosecuting the triangulation. The site chosen rests on the narrow strip of land which separates Indian river from the Atlantic ocean, and i;i marked on Sketch No. 20. A preliminary measurement, without correcting for the temperature of the rods used, gave for the line an approximate length of 2, 860 metres. Sub-Assistant Sullivan made a topographical survey of the immediate vicinity of the base, and on his return deposited in the office the sheet containing it. .A.s the line passes close to the water margin of the Atlantic, the ends were referred back eight metres from the beach, and carefully secured by placing stone posts on a sand ridge above the ordinary action of the ocean swell. Each terminus was marked by two stone blocks about two feet in length, surrounded by wooden curbs, and having range marks cut on them to correspond with the terminating points of the line laid out on the beach. The preliminaries being completed, five stations were established, with signals visible over the high mangrove keys which lie inside of Indian river and abreast of the inlet. These connect with both ends of the base line. The scaffolds erected are twenty-five feet in height. Two of the stations rest on the western side of Indian river, as will be seen by reference to the Sketch; the others on the strip of land south of the inlet. The time allotted for observations with the theodolite proving unfavorable, materials were

prepared for the second order signals required along the shores of Indian river, in which duty the party was occupied until the 25th of March. Sub-Assistant Sullivan commends the zeal, perseverance, and hearty spirit of co-operation shown by his aid, Mr. R. M. Stiles, in all the labors of the season. Special reference is also made in the field report to the courtesieR and assistance rendered to the party by Major W. F. Russell, of Fort Capron. The schooner Benjamin Peirce, which was used in prosecuting the work at Indian river, was caught in a gale and damaged. on the return passage, off Cape Canavaral. After the necessary repairs at Savannah, the vessel proceeded north, and was laid up at New York. In June Mr. Sullivan was assigned to duty in Penobscot bay, the details of which have been giveu under the head of Section I. His party is uow about to return to continue the triangulation near Fort Capron, Fla. Triangulation qf the Florida keys.-For continuing duty on that part of the Florida reef which approaches nearest to the Cape Sable base, the party of Lieut. A. H. Seward, U. S. A., Assistant Coast Survey, took the field on the 13th of December, using the schooner Torrey for transportation. After putting up the requisite signals, the triangulation inside of the reef was resumed at Lignum Vitre key, and extended eastward sixteen miles to Pigeon key. The triangles laid out and measured, as well as the genera.l progress made in the survey of the keys, will be seen by reference to Sketch No. 21. At several of the stations used by Lieut. Seward tripods, for the theodolite, were found necessary, the platforms of which were elevated to a height of twenty-eight and thirty feet from the surface of the keys on which they rested. The work was somewhat retarded by the difficulty of passing the vessel through the intricate channels of that part of the reef, favorable winds only enabling the party to move from one station to another. Lieut. W. Myers, U. S. A., assisted Lieut. Seward in the field. The angular measurements were made with the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 15. It will be seen by Sketch No. 21 that this triangulation connects with the work of last year, stretching from Cape Sable, and that it reaches well towardR a junction with the triangulation which extends along the main of the peninsula from Cape Florida into Barnes' s sound. The statistics for the season, terminating on the 2d of April, are as follows: Stations erected· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Stations occupied · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of observations········· · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area included in triangles, (square miles)···· · · · · · · · · · · · · ······ ······ 11 ··· · ···· ···· 11 · · - · · · · · · · ·. 2,598 ··· · ··· · ··· 62

Descriptions of the signals, and a duplicate of the record of horizontal angles, have been received at the office. On closing for the season the vessel was despatched for New York, and was there laid up during the summer. The keys yet remaining to be defined in position and outline are surrounded by water so shallow as to render the approach to them very difficult. Triangvlation ef Okarwtte harbor, Fla.-This work has been continued and nearly completed by a party in charge of Lieut. W. R. Terrill, U. S. A., Assistant Coast Survey, who made a reconnaissance for its extension above Captiva Pass in the latter part of December. Signals were erected on the chain of islands which lie outside and abreast of Charlotte harbor, and along both of its shores to a distance of thirty miles, terminating at Mangrove Point, the position of which is shown on one of the progress sketches of this section, (Sketch No. 20.)

76

ItEPORT OF THE 6l!l'EHIN'I'ENDE1'T QI.'

'l'he signal at Captiva Pass, erected and used in the winter of 1857-' 58 by Lieut. J. C. Clark, U. S. A., had been washed away, and, in consequence, it became necessary to reoccupy the station connecting with it to the southward on Captiva island. At three stations in the range of this season's work Lieut. Terrill observed from Rcaffolds fifty feet in height, the lines passing over dense mangrove, t}1rough which cuttings for sight on the signals would have involved great expense of labor and time. The measurement of angles was begun early in January with the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 81, and was prosecuted at all favorable intervals until the 1st of April, the completed-, observations then resting for the season at station Oso, lying outside, and station Torrey on the eastern shore of Charlotte harbor. Both of these stations are marked on Sketch No. 20. Points for the use of the topographical party, conducted jointly by Sub·A.ssistants Dorr and Ferguson, were provided as the triangulation advanced. Sub-Assistant Clarence Fendall joined t11e party of Lieut. Terrall at the opening of the year, and assisted him in the field until the 13th of March. Mr. 0. B. Baker served as aid during the season. The i:;chooner .Bowtliteh reached New York, on her return from this section, on the 14th of April. In the report made by Lieut. Terrill the following abi:itract ii:i given, showing the progress made by the party while working under his direction: Number of signali:; erected .... · .... · .. · .. ·. · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · ·. · · · Stations occupied· .. ·. · · .. · .. · . · ..... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Signals observed on .... · ......... · · · · · .. · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Angles measured· · · · · · · · ...... · .. ·. · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of observations·· ... · .... · ... · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ···· 24 ···· 11 ···· 24 ···· 75 · · · · 4,316

The triangulation completed this season covers an area of about a hundred and thirty Hquare miles. The original records of angles, as observed in the prosecution of the work, and descriptions of the stations and signahi, have been received at the office. Lieut. Terrill resumed field duty in June with the party of Assistant Edmund Blunt, reference to which was made in describing the work done in Section II. Sub-Assistant Fendall was at the same time assigned to plane-table duty, as stated under Section I. Topography-Key Biscayne bay, Cards' sound, and Florida keys, near Cape Sable.--With a view of pmlhing the plane-table work in the vicinity of the Florida reef as far as practicable with a single party, the schooner Agassiz was despatched from Baltimore on the 28th of October, 1858. Much rough weather delayed the vessel, and, in consequence, the working station in Key Biscayne bay was not reached until the 20th of November. After making a reconnaissance, and setting up signals on the western i:;hore of the bay, Sub.Assistant C. T. Iardella started with the plane-table at Shoal Point, and traced in the main shore of the peninsula of Florida, southward and westward to Clay Point, a distance of over thirty miles in a direct line. Tho tongue of land which from thence projects towards the reef was followed up to the narrow creek dividing it from Key Largo, and the survey of the weRtern side of that key wari completed. The shore of the main within the limits just stated is broken by thirty-three small creeks, all of which are represented on the plane-table sheetB. Several Bmall keys lying in the lower part of Key Biscayne bay, and in Cards' sound, were also surveyed. This work is embraced on four sheets, the localities included in each of which are marked on Sketch No. 21

The triangulation in Barnes' s sound not admitting of further progress in the topography until

pushed southward, Mr. Iardella n10Yed his party to the vicinity of Buchanan key and projected two sheets to include the numerous small keys intervening within the stretch of about Rixteen mi.les between it and Sandy key in the direction towards Cape Salile. These fall within the triangulation executed last year by Lieut. A. H. Seward, U. R. A. Twenty-three keys were surveyed, the largest of which is about three-quarters of a mile in length. The positions of the principal ones are shown on the progress Sketch, No. 21. Sub-Ass.istant Iardella discontinued work on the 6th of April, and on the 22d of that month reached New York, where the vessel was laid up. Mr. F. F. N es aided in the topographical work, and rendered satisfactory service in the several duties pertaining to the field operations. In the two localities in ·which the party was employed great obstacles exist to retard steady progress and to render the work very difficult, and in some places hazardous. Notwithstanding these, the amount of work embraced on the six sheets shows a result which nothing but patience and great energy could have accomplished. The remark just made is also borne out by the statistics, which are as follows: Shore-line surveyed· · · · .. · · · · .. · .. · . · · . · · . · · · · .. · . · ......... . Marsh~line traced· · · · · · .. · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · · · · · · .. · ..... · Area represented in detail, (square miles)··· · · · · · · · · · · · .. · · · ... ·

168 miles. 16 " 40

The operations were carried on OYer an area of more than three hundred square miles. All the sheets containing the work have been inked and deposited in the archives. As descriptive of the character of this part of the coast of the Florida peninsula, the following extracts are given from the report of Mr. Iardella : "The main shore, from Shoal Point ten miles southward, consists of a strip of uneven breadth of prairie land called the ' Bunting Grounds.' At Rome points it is quite narrow, but at others it stretches to a distance of six miles from the western shore of Key Biscayne bay, and is backed by a ridge of high land about a quarter of a mile in width. The ridge as far as Fender Point is covered with large pine trees, but below it, and as low down as Barnes' s sound, it bears a heavy growth of black mangrove and other trees. Throughout the entire distance of thirty miles the shore is overflowed by high tides, in some places to a breadth of three or four miles. "The weistern shore of Key Largo from Jewfish Point to Largo North, a distance of thirteen miles, is also overflowed at high spring tides; and on many occasions, while engaged there, the surface was found so soft as to require a foundation of mangrove branches for the plane-table. Beyond its western shore this key is covered with buttonwood, mangrove, sea-grape, and other woods. In an extended reconnaissance over that part of Key Largo, very little fast land was * * * * * found, and no soil fit for the growth of yegetables. "The small keys between Lignum Vitre and Sandy key are surrounded by extensive mud flats, and are entirely covered with water at high tides. Great difficulties were experienced in obtaining stations for the plane-table, the surface being of the nature of quicksand, into which a man of ordinary weight would at once sink to the waist. Here a triangle of wood six feet on a side was necessary to support the plane-table." Topography qf Charlotte harbor, Fla.-The progress made in extending the smvey of this harbor is shown on Sketch No. 20. Early preparations for resuming work were made at the opentng of the surveying year, by Sub-Assistant F. W. Dorr; but the schooner Dana, which

78

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

sailed from Baltimore on the 25th of November, 1858, with the equipage and instruments of the party, was kept nearly a month on her passage to Key West by storms and head winds. Sub-Assistant Charles Ferguson was associated with Mr. Dorr; and after making arrangements for working jointly to the best advantage, the topography was taken up at the limit reac·hed in the previous year. The work was thus prosecuted northward until the 27th of February, when Sub-Assistant Dorr, in accordance with my instructions, returned to the north, leaving the vessel and party in charge of Mr. Ferguson, who continued plane-table duty until the 16th of March. The ·work executed this·senson includes both shores of Charlotte harbor above its lower entrance from San Carlos bay, and nearly the same extent to the northward as fell within the limits of the triangulation, notice of which has been made in this chapter. The shores are formed by a range of narrow islands and keys on the west, and by Pine island on the eastern side. On the two sheets of this season, both of which have been inked :i.nd placed in the office, are represented the northern half of Sanibel island, Captiva island, La Costa island, the western side of Pine island, and the keys, patches, and reefs scattered over the surface of that part of Charlotte harbor which is included between San Carlos bay and Boca Grande. The distance between these last named localities, on a direct line thro11gh the waters of Charlotte harbor, is about twenty miles. Lieut. W. R.. Terrill, U. S. A., who conducted the triangulation in advance of the plane-table party, furnished the points necessary for the adjustment of the topography. The following is a synopsis of statistics taken from the notes on the planet.able sheets: Shore-line of islands and keys surveyed ....... · ......... · .... ·.. Outline of shoals, etc., traced · · · . · · . · . · · .. · ....... - · - · · . · . · - · · 270 miles. 48 "

In reference to two of the outlets from Charlotte harbor to the Gulf of Mexico, Sub-Assistant Dorr re mar kR :

'' Blind Pass, between Sanibel island and Captiva island, is merely a boat channel, for although the passage is deep in some places, the bars both inside and outside preclude the possibility of carrying through any vessel of draught." '' Captiva Pass is about five hundred yards wide. Vessel'!! drawing not more than five feet of water can pass through, but the channel is somewhat intricate.'' The following is an extract from the report of Sub-Assistant Ferguson: ''Boca Grande, the pass between La Costa and Gaspari11a islands, is the proper entrance to Charlotte harbor, containing, at low tide, fifteen feet of water, and inside of the bay three or four fathoms. Vessels passing through can carry eighteen feet some fifteen or twenty miles beyond the northern extremity of Pine island." In the Appendix (No. 31) other extracts will be found descriptive of the features peculiar to the shores of Charlotte harbor. During the summer Sub-Assistant Dorr was engaged in pla~e-table duty in Section II, and Mr. Ferguson in similar service in Section III. Hydrography of the Florida reef.-Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., having been reassigned for duty on the Coast Survey soon after his return from the expedition to the Atrato river, resumed the command of the surveying steamer Corwin, which had become vacant by a call for the services of Lieut. W. G. Temple, U. S. N., who condugted the hydrographic operations of last year on the Florida reef, as stated in my annual report. The Corwin sailed

THE I!NITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

79

from New York on the 19th of March, and on her arrival at the reef the general hydrography was taken up a little below Eagle cove, where it rested last season in its progress eastward along the outer line of keys. The soundings were continued in the same direction rather more than eight miles, and off the keys about six miles and a half, reaching to an average depth of forty-seven fathoms. .At its upper outside limit, as Rhown on Sketch Ko. 21, the work now connects with soundings made in the vicinity of Coffin's Patches, by Lieut. Comg. Craven, in 1854. The following statistics are derived from the journals of the present season: Number of positiom1 for angles··· ... · · · . . · .. · .. · ..... · · ..... Angles taken ............ · · · · · · · .. · · · ... · · · .. · · .. · · · · · · · · · ~files run in sounding ..... · . · · · · . . . · · . . . . · . . . . · · .. · · · · · · · .. Number of casts of the lead······ · · · · · ... · · .. ·. · ... ·. · · . · ·. · 1,206

The resulting hydrographic sheet will exhibit an area of about sixty square miles. Since the opening of the seae:on two charts have been plotted from soundings made by Lieuts. Comg. Craven and Temple, and placed in the office with the original journals and records of the angles. These connect with each other, and contain the hydrography between American shoal and Eagle cove, where the upper limit of the most northern sheet joins with the work last executed. The steamer Corwin returned to New York early in May, and after being repaired was transferred, under the command of Lieut. Comg. John Wilkinson, for duty, which has been referred to under the head of Section I. Before leaving the Florida reef, Lieut. Comg. Craven ran two section lines across the Gulf Stream, between Cape Florida and the Tortugas, more extended notice of which will be taken presently. In passing to the southward the steamer Corwin stood in below Cape Cafiaveral, and carried a line of soundings along the coast of Florida as far as St. Lucie inlet. The distance from land being estimated, the depths found have been marked as reconnaissance soundings on the Progress Sketch, No_ 36. As the result of bis experience in navigating along the eastern coast of the peninsula, Lieut. Comg. Craven says: "The entire coast south of Canaveral is safe at two miles from shore until within five miles of Cape Florida. South of latitude 27° N. the shore is bold. I have never had soundings with twenty fathoms, lead 'up and down,' within two mifos of the shore. On the passage down. the rate of the current below Jupiter inlet was about two miles an hour, which is more than usual, the wind then blowing from the southeast." All the journals containing angles and soundings taken this season on the reef have been returned and deposited in the archives. Tided observations.-At Fort Clinch, near Fernandina, Amelia island, Fla., observations have been kept up by means of one of the Saxton self-registering tide-gauges, the instrument being under the charge of Mr. F . .A. Rebarer until the middle of December, 1858, and since that time in charge of Mr. J. A. Walker. The self-registering gauges established by Mr. Gustavus Wiirdemann at Tortugas, Charlotte harbor, and Tampa bay, have given very satisfactory results during the entire year, and are now about to be transferred to stations lying further westward along the Gulf coast of the

80

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDEXT OF

adjoining section, (VII.) The plan laid out is to set them up so as to form a chain of stations, at which the results may be comparable with each other and with others in this section through the standard station of reference at Tortugas. It has been found impracticable to trace out the anomalies of the tides of the Gulf of Mexico from the detached and comparatively short series of observations heretofore obtained in the progress of the survey; but by the method now adopted, the observations embracing a full year at each station, and being minutely comparable with each other, the different tide waves can be followed, as it were, step by step in their advance along the coast.
GULF STREAM.

In the southern part of the Gulf Stream observations of much interest have been added in the course of the past year. These were made by Lieuts. Comg. T. A. C_raven and T. B. Huger, U. S. N., assistants in the Coast Survey, after closing the general hydrograpliic work conducted by them in Sections YI am] VIII, respectively. Two lines for depth and temperature were run across the stream by Lieut. Comg. Craven, in the steamer Corwin, one from Carysfort light-house (Florida reef) to Orange key, (Bahama

bank,) and the other from Sombrero key (Florida reef) to Double Headed Shot key, (Salt Key bank.) 'l'he data thus obtained, taken in connexion with the development of the Cape Florida section by that officer in 1855, and of the 'l'ortugas section by Commander B. F. Sands, U. S. N., in 1858, have furnished important information concerning the form of the bottom, the depth, and the temperature of the water in a part of the Gulf Stream to which general obser· vation would assign as its main peculiarity only the velocity of the surface current. The bottom of the Strait of Florida slopes, at first gradually and then more rapidly, from the Florida to the Cuban side, the deepest water being found near the shore of Cuba. In this deep portion of the trough the cold polar current lies, the temperature at six hundred fathoms, off Havana, being but thirty-eight degrees of Fahrenheit. The deepest part of the strait is off the opening from the Gulf of Mexico, and it shoals towards the line from Cape Florida to Bernini, from eight hundred fathoms to three hundred and fifty. .A.s there is but one general slope to the bottom, so there is but one band of temperature in this strait, the division into cold and warm bands beginning only to the south of the shoal portion in the Atlantic, where the bottom takes its corrugated form. A discussion of the recent observations is given at greater length in a paper accompanying this report as Appendix No. 25. The results are graphically shown on Sketch No. 35. On his homeward passage from the Delta of the Mississippi, in the steamer Walker, Li';)ut. Comg. Huger took soundings on the course towards the Tortugas, and from thence ran across to Havana. The observations made between the last named places verify the results obtained on the same line by Commander B. F. Sand!!, in 185~. In the explorations this year, two hundred and thirty-five observations were made for depth and temperature, and twelve specimens of the bottom procured.

Office-work.-The drawing and engraving of the preliminary chart of the eastern part of St. George's sound have been completed, as also the engraving of the preliminary chart of Pensacola harbor. The drawing of the preliminary chart of Apalachicola bay has been finished at the office, and has since been engraved on stone under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Printing. Ooast triangulation south ef Homosassa 1·iver, Fla.-Two partie;;, operating jointly as heretofore, left Ba1timore on the 15th of December, with the schooner Joseph Henry, to continue the triangulation and topography of the western coast of Florida, below Cedar Keys. Suh-Assistant G. H. Bagwell, in charge of the triangulation, resumed duty at a station near the mouth of Homosassa river, and carried the work twenty-five miles southward, to the vicinity of Bayport, where be closed for the season at the end of March. Sketch No. 23 contains a scheme of the triangles, and shows also the progress which has been made in the other branches of the survey in this section. It will be seen, by referring to the sketch, that the reefy and broken character of the coast approach, as represented on the preliminary chart of Cedar Keys, (Sketch No. 33, C. S. Report for 1855,) holds as far as the parties have advanced to the southward from that centre of work. Mr. Bagwell thus remarks, in reference to that part passed over since the opening of the present surveying year, as connected with the stretch lying northward of it : ''The main surface consists of vast flats and shoals which extend miles to seaward from the western shore of Florida, the water gradually deepeniug off among the daugerouil rocks of St. Martin's reef.'' "Most of the stations observed from were occupied with scaffolds, some of which were built as high as thirty feet, in order to see over the thick hammocks of palmetto and mangrove that obstructed the view. The coast over which the work ex.tended presents many obstacles to triangulation. The cha.in of keys and shell reefs, on which the outer sides of the triangles rest 11

from Cedar Keys southward to Chassahowitzka Point, end at the latter place, and below it suitable outer points could be established only by building stations in shallow water. At these a foot or more in depth is left at low ti<le.' 1 In the course of his work, Sub-Assistant Bagwell determined positions for the use of the topographical party of Sub-Assistant Finney, who co-operated also, as far as practicable, in pushing the triangulation. The field statistics are as follows : Stations occupied - . · .. - - - · . · · · · · · · · · - · · · · Signals observed on. - - - · . · · · · · - · · · · - - · · · · Angles measured . · · · · · - · · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of observations ..... · . · · · · · . · · · · · ···· ···· ···· ···· ··· · ··· · ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ···· ·· ······ ···· 12 29 78 2, 060

The observations were made with the-eight inch Wiirdemann theodite, C. S~ No. 86. During an interval unfavorable for the measurement of angles, Mr. Bagwell made a reconnaissance of the coast from Bayport southward, and through St. Joseph's bay to the southern limit of the section. About thirty miles below Bayport a fine site for a base was found on a straight level strip of sand beach at the north end of Chaldee' s key. The length practicable for measurement he reports as being nearly three miles. Between Bayport and Anclote key, a distance Of fifteen miles, the difficulties before alluded to in regard to outside stations remain to be encountered. As the result of his observations in reconnaissance beyond that, Mr. Bagwell says : '' Southward from .A.nclote key the triangulation can readily be extended with sides of from two to :five miles over St. Joseph's bay and Clear Water harbor." :Mr. M. 0. Hering rendered acceptable aid in all the operations of the triangulation party. Before taking the field, the records of last year were duplicated and sent to the office with the observer's computation of results. In April the schooner Joseph Henry returned to New York and was laid up for the summer. Sub-Assistant Bagvrnll soon after joined the party of Assistant Edmund Blunt, and aided him in the triangulation under bis charge in Section II. Tr£angulation east and west from St. Mark's, Fla.-The triangulation from St. George's sound, which rested last year at the eastern end of St. James's island (S. W. cape,) was taken up at that point, by Sub-Assistant Spencer C. McCorkle, on the 16th of December. After making a reconnaissance for pushing the work eastward towards St. :Mark's and Ocilla river entrance, a system of short lines was determined on, extending over Ocklokonee bay. Such of the lines as required cutting were then cleared and the necessary signals erected. The angular measurements were commenced on the 25th of January, and continued until near the end of April, when a junction was made between the triangulation thus carried from St. George's sound and that executed at St. Mark's river by Mr. McCorkle in 1856. Stations were also erected eastward of St. Mark's and preliminary measurements made in the series of triangles designed to connect that work with tho triangulation of Ocilla river. A.s the operations of the party progressed on the shores of Ocklokonee and Dickerson's bays, points were determined and furnished for the use of the plane-table party of Assistant Wise. An abstract of the statistics is given below, as contained in the report of Sub-Assistant McOorkle: Stations occupied · . · · .. · · · ...................................... .

The instrument used was the six-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 55. Sketch No. 23 shows the arrangement of the triangles. The distance from the starting point of the season's work (S. W. cape) to St. Mark's light-house is about twenty-five miles. In his general report Sub-Assistant McOorkle commends the zeal and intelligence shown by Mr. A. W. Thompson, who aided him both in the field and office work of his party. On closing work, the schooner Franklin, which had been used for the transportation of the party and materials for the stations, was laid up at Apalachicola. Mr. McCorkle has sent to the office the original and duplicate of the record of angles measured this season, together with his computation for the lengths of triangle sides. Triangulation ef Santa Rosa sound, Fla.-This work was taken up by Assistant F. Il. Gerdes in March, after closing similar duty at the Mississippi delta, reference to which will be more particularly made in the next chapter. The triangulation of Santa Rosa sound joins with that of Pensacola bay on the line connecting Fair Point with a station near the western end of Santa Rosa island, as may be seen on the progress sketch of the section, (Sketch No. 23.) From thence a chain of triangle;; extending six miles eastward was laid out and measured with the Wiirdemann theodolite, (C. S. No. 87,) the points requisite for the topographical survey being also determined as the triangulation advanced. A synopsis of the statistics is appended: Signals erected . · · · · · · · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - - · · · · · · · · · - · - · · · · . · · · Stations occupied ........... · ·. · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · · · · ·. · · .. ·. · Angles meas'lued · · . · .... · . · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ..... · · · · · · · .. · · .. · · · Number of observations · · ·. · · · · · · · · ·. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 10 10 30 288

Assistant Gerdes was aided in the field by Mr. G. U. Mayo. Soon after the close of work the record of angles observed was duplicated and sent to the office, with an abstract in the usual form. Topograpl;y north and soutli Qf Ho11WS(J,SSQ, entrance, West F"lorida.-The party in charge of this duty was conducted by Sub-Assistant N. S. Finney, and, as heretofore, co-operated in the triangulation work in its progress southward from Cedar Keys, special notice of which has already been made in this chapter. Mr. Finney resumed the plane-table survey at Mangrove Point, two miles southwest of Crystal reef signal, and traced in outline the entire barrier of islands, rocks, and sheJl reefs, which extend about seven miles to the southward. These form the most strongly-marked feature of that part of the coast of Florida. The sheet containing the det::.iled work was terminated at the mouth of the Homosassa river. An additional vessel for the use of the topographical party not being available, it was found necessary to pass by for the present season a few miles of the coast below Homosassa entrance, in order to keep pace with the triangulation, the same vessel serving for the transportation of the two parties. Plane-table work was therefore taken up at the Chasaahowitzka entrance, (Sketch No. 23,) and carried southward about seven miles further to Raccoon Point, the triangulation being still a few miles in advance of it. The characteristics before alluded to apply also to the coast south of the Chassahowitzka river. Both of the sheets containing the results of the survey are marked in positive and in relative proportions on the progress sketch of the section, but the reduced scale gives, of necessity, only a partial idea of the peculiar features contained on the originals. Exclusive of portions of the shore-liue of the main land and numerous shell reefs, the sheets represent two hundred and thirty-six soft, marshy islands

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

as existing within an area of thirty-five square miles. In some places the belt of islands extends five miles beyond the main shore. Above the mouth of the Chassahowitzka the islands are covered at high water, but the marsh of which they consist lies somewhat higher, is much less broken than in other localities, and the zone of patches which lie between the deep water of the Gulf and the firm land of the peninsula becomes narrower. The plane-table survey was discontinued for the season at a station about five miles north of Bayport. In the report of Sub-Assistant Finney favorable mention is made of the services rendered by Mr. J. L. Tilghman, who accompanied him in the field as aid. The statistics of work are thus given in the same report: Plane-table stations occupied········· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · 413 Points determined···· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·. · · 1,320 Shore-line surveyed at high water, (main, islands, and reefs)· · · · . · · · ·.. . 176 Shore-line at low water· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area of topography, (square miles)·· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 54 35

In tho field report :Mr. Finney expresses Lis obligations for courtesies extended by Captain .James Tucker, of the mail steamship Madison, and for assistance rendered to his party by Colonel E. H. Richards and W. P, Peginan, esq., postmaster at Cedar Keys. Sub-Assistant Finney was employed during the summer in Section II, as stated in the corre-

sponding division of this report. Topography of Ocklokonee bay and St. James's island, Fla.-The party of Assistant G.D. Wise, having last season completed the plane-table survey of St. George's sound, started early in January at the terminating limit on St. James's island of the topography commenced and partly executed by Sub-Assistant C. T. Iardclla in the season of 1857-' 58. The survey of tho northern part of the island was completed by Mr. Wise, and on the same sheet the work extended so as to include the shores of Ocklokonee bay. Some progress was also made on a second sheet projected to contain the details of ihe vicinity of Dickerson's bay and of the coast running from its entrance towards St. Mark's. The localities of the work are marked on Sketch No. 23. The return in statistics is as follows: Shore-line surveyed· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Roads surveyed · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Area of plane-table sheets, (square miles)· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 88 miles. 10 " 46

This survey rests on the triangulation executed within the present season by Sub-Assistant S. C. McCorkle. Mr. C. W. Duval served as aid in the plane-table party. The work was prosecuted with the use of the schooner Howell Cobb, and on the close of operations the vessel left for the north, and was laid up at Baltimore. With reference to the Ocklokonee sqoal, which lies off the eastern end of St. James' s island, .Assistant Wise remarks: "The shoal having only two or three feet of water, and being right in the track of a large trade, Las occasioned the loss of many valuable cargoes. The bell-buoy which was placed on it soon broke adrift, and, after wa.Bhing ashore on St. George's isl~nd, was

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

85

finally lost. It is the opinion of many shipping-masters of the vicinity that, a light-ship would best answer the purposes of navig ition here as a beacon to mark the shoal." Topograpl1y qf Santa Rosa sound, Fla.-.A.fter completing the triangulation de8cribed under a previous head, Assistant F. H. Gerdes proceeded at once with the plane-table, and surveyed that part of Santa Rosa island which lies in the immediate vicinity of Little Sabine bayou, having an extent of about six miles of Gulf coast on the outside, and the same of inner shoreline. The topographical sheet includes also the opposite shore of Santa Rosa sound from Deer Point eastward to the present limit of the triangulation. .A.n aggregaie of twenty-two miles of shore was traced within an area of ten square miles. Sketch Ko. 23 shows the limits of the plane-table work. This survey furnishes all the topographical details necessary for the chart of Pensacola harbor, an edition of which in a preliminary form ha8 been issued from the office. Mr. G. U. Mayo aided in the triangulation ·md plane-table survey of Santa Rosa sound. The work was continued until the middle of May, when Assistant Gerdes proceeded north and reported at the office. His party had been previously employed in Section YIII, as will be noticed further on. Re-examination qf the Cedar Keys channel8, Fla.-On his way to Section YIII, Lieut. Comg. T. B. Huger, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, with the hydrographic party in the steamer V?alker, stopped at Cedar Keys and sounded out the Main, the North key, and the northwest channels leading into that harbor. The work was performed in the early parl of January, and under disadvantages arising from fogs, rain, and northerly windf:!. .A.s a consequence of the prevailing wind during the period of the stay of the party, the rise and fall of tl1e tide were reduced much below the average, the fall in particular being greater for sGveral days than had been observed in the course of the preceding year. Lieut. Comg. Huger states that the breadth of the bulkhead across the maiu channel varies from one hundred to three hundred yards, and, in his opinion, the surface of it could readily be removed so as to afford a depth of twehe feet at low water. .A.n examination made by the party confirmed the facts heretofore reported in regard to the structure and character of the bar. Lieut. C<MDg. Huger says: "It is composed of a crust of sand and shells easily penetrated, and after passing through it the bottom is soft, consisting, I think, of mud and sand. I had it sounded with an iron rod, a.nd on trying the heavy lead and specimen cup, founJ no difficulty in sinking it sufficiently deep to obtain a good specimen." The soundings made at Cedar Keys were plotted at Pensacola while the steamer was taking in supplies, and the chart on being completed wa;,, sent to the office, with the following abstract of statistics:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Having been fitted out for hydrographic duty in Section VIII, the vessel cleared from Pensacola on the 15th of January for Atchafalaya bay. The work done by the party subsequent to that date will be described in the next chapter. Hydrography ef St. George's sound, Fla.-'I'he party of Lieut. Comg. J. K. Duer, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, resumed work in the vicinity of Apalachicola with the steamer Vixen on the 3d of December, and executed portions of the hydrography jm;ide and abreast of the West Pass. The new channel leading into the sound past the eastern end of Dog island was thoroughly examined, with results confirming those reported after the reconnaissance made last ;year, that it is by several feet the deepest pass into St. George's sound at all seasons. But the lrnown irregularities of the tides affecting the depth of water in the eastern part of the sound render the determination of the mean rise and fall somewhat difficult without a wider range in the observations than is ordinarily necessary for hydrographic purposes. In mder to elncidate the normal peculiarities of the tide wave in its progress along that part of the Gulf coast, series of observations have been directed to be made with eelf-registering gauges, and arrangements for commencing them are now in band. The hydrographic work allotted in this section for the early part of the season was frequently interrupted by bad weather. Soundings were continued until the 10th of March, the vessel and party being then transferred for duty to Section IX, the operations in which will be described in another chapter. Lieut. Comg. Duer, who had preceded the return of the steamer Vixen to Apalachicola, died at that place on the 14th of June, after wliich the charge of the party devolved on Mr. A. W. Muldaur, as executive officer, until the assignment of Lieut. C. C. Sims, U. S. N., who took command on the 1st of July and proceeded with the vessel to New York. As part of a summary report made at the end of the season by Mr. Muldaur, the following statistics are given of the work done in St. George's sound: Miles run in sounding· .... · · . · ....................... · . . . . . . . . . . . 564 Angles measured. · ..... · . · · . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 499 Number of soundings ........ · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25, 060

In the death of Lieut. Comg. Duer the survey has lost the services of a zealous and industrious officer, whose career on the work seemed ever to be marked by devotion to its best interests. He was prompt to act, and thorough in the execution of details assigned to his charge. His discovery of the new channel into St. George's sound, and which now bears his name, will closely asi;ociate his memory with the hydrographic history of this section. I have elsewhere more i;pecially alluded to the circumstances attending his untimely death. My public acknowledgment is here due to Lieut. Sims for the important service rendered by him in accepting the charge of the steamer Vixen when the official command of that vessel was left vacant by the decease of Lieut. Comg. Duer. In March, while the party was employed near Apalachicola, assistance was rendered to the schooner Lucy W eltham, of Wilmington, N. C., which had gone ashore on tl1e east bank of the West Pass. Similar service was afforded from the Vixen to the mail steamer Galveston in June, when grounded on the east side of the entrance to Apalachicola harbor. TiilaJ, observations.-The self-registering gauge established at Cedar Keys for recording observations simultaneous with those made at Egmont key, Charlotte harbor, and Tortugas,

has been kept in working order, and has given satisfactory results. The gauges were attended to by Mr. Gustavus Wtirdemann, who devoted to them his usual care and attention. I am indebted to S. Thayer Abert, esq., civil engineer at Warrenton navy yard, for the records of a self-registering gauge, the charge of which he kindly undertook when it was set up at that station. Through the interest taken by that gentleman in the subject, the records, as received at the office, have been found highly satisfactory. As intimated under the bead of Section VI, a series of stations are about to be established from St. Mark's westward, along the shores of St. George's sound, and extending as far as Cedar keys to the eastward. By these it is expected that the anomalies noticed in the tides of this part of the Gulf coast may be fully developed. SECTION VIII.
FROM MOBILE BAY TO VERMILION DAY, INCLUDING THE COAS'l' OF THE STATE OF IIHSSISSIPPI AND PART OF THE COAST OF LOUISIANA.-(SKETCH H, No. 2G :i

Two triangulation and topographical parties, one a double party, one topographical party, and one hydrographic party, have been occupied in this section, and their progress is described in the following chapter under the heads of1. Triangulation and topography of Isle au Breton sound, La. 2. Triangulation of the :Mississippi delta, La. 3. Triangulation of West Cote Blanche bay, La. 4. Topography of Lake Pontchartrain, La. 5. Topography of the Mississippi delta, La. 6. Topography of West Cote Blanche bay, La. 7. Soundings in the Rigolets, La.. 8. Hydrographic reconnaissance of Pass a l' Outre, :Mississippi delta. 9. Hydrography of Atchafalaya and Cote Blanche bays, La. Office-work.-The preliminary chart of Atchafalaya bay has been drawn and engraved, and the engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 91 and 92, Mississippi sound and Mobile bay, from Bon Secours bay to Grand island, has been in progress. Triangulation and topography of Is7e au Breton sound, La.-Connecting with stations of the primary triangulation westward of .Mississippi sound, others have been occupied suitable for carrying a branch southward from the general series of triangles, so as to include the survey of Chandeleur sound and that of Isle au Breton l:!OUnd. This duty was in trusted to Sub-Assistant Stephen Harris, and has been successfully accomplished, as "Vill be seen by the plan given on Sketch No. 26, the triangulation now extending as low down as Point Fortuna, or within twenty miles of the Mississippi river. In order to join properly with the completed range of triangles resting on Lake Borgne, Mr. Harris was directed to reoccupy the station Nine Mile Bayou, which had been used in the primary work, but the granite block placed there as a mark in 1852 could not be found. The shell bank in which it was then fixed had in tl10 interval been removed as material probably for roads. After making ar reconnaissance to the southward with the schooner Twilight, Mr. Harris resumed the triangulation at station Sand Fly early in December. In passing towards Isle au Breton sound, numerous tertiary points were marked and plotted on a plane-table sheet, on which was afterwards traced in a large portion of the irregular shore-line forming the western side of Chandeleur sound. This was done with the plane-table at intervals which

REPORT 01'' THE SDPERIXTENDENT OF

would not admit of observations on the longer lines of the triangulation. 'l'he work being in that manner completed some distance southward, the vessel was moved to Isle au Breton sound for more convenient access to the stations remaining to be occupied. In addition to the angular measurements in that vicinity and others at stations connecting with the triangulation of Chandeleur sound, a second plane-table sheet, commenced in 1857, was completed in the course of the season which closed in the latter part of }lay. The reconnaissance made by Sub-Assistant Harris extended over an area of about two hundred and thirty square miles.

The Wiirdemann theodolites, ten inch, No. 79, and six inch, No. 84, were used at the stations. One hundred and fifteen miles of shore-line were traced and marked on the two plane-table sheets. Great care was taken in regard to the triangulation points; and in reference to the means most proper for their preservation, Mr. Harris observes: "Having noticed the causes which led to the destruction of some of the stations, I adopted precautions in the following particulars: 1. 1'he selection of stable ground not likely to be exposed to the action of water. 2. The use of a number of marks for each station, situated at such distances from each ot.her and under such different circumstances, as to make it unlikely that all will be displaced by the same cause. 3. Distinguishing and determining each mark so that it may be recognized and its position known in case of the loss of all the other marks at the same station. 4. Making all the marks entirely separate from the observing tripods and scaffolds." Full descriptions of the stations and signals used this season, and of the marks placed to identify them, have been made by Mr. Harris and placed in the office. He has also turned in his computations and records of the previous year. The field operations of the party were aided by Mr. R. E. Halter, who executed the greater part of the plane-table work, and by Mr. H. W. Bache. After his return to the office, Sub-Assistant Harris engaged in the computations depending on the work of the season. Trmngulation of the Mississippi ddta, La.-In continuation of the work in this quarter, Assistant F. R. Gerdes resumed operations at the opening of the year, and prosecuted the survey of the delta until the middle of March. He was assisted by Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns and Mr. G. U. Mayo. After replacing and determining the positions of the signals displaced by recent storms, Mr. Gerdes reoccupied six of the 1:1econdary station1:1, and connected with the general scheme of triangles a number of tertiary points suitable for the plane-table survey of Southeast P&.ss, Pass ii.1' Outre, the North Pass, the ruuq fiats in that vicinity, and Robinson's reef, together with the shores of Bay Rondo, and the banks of the Mississippi at the head of the passes. The plan of the work, as far as executed, may be seen by reference to Sketch No. 26. Notice of the topographical survey will be taken in a subsequent part of this chapter.

In my report of last year allusion was made to the difficulty of finding localities on the delta in which the station-marks could be secured. Assistant Gerdes reports that the peculiar obsta· cles arisiug from the nature of the surface increase on advancing towards the outlets, the soil being too unstable to admit of any ordinary expedients for guarding against their removal or displacement. Though insufficient iu rmwber and in their distribution as points for future reference, the light· houses and a few buildings with cupolas, being determined in position and connected with the triangulation, in some measure lesson the natural disadvantages under ·which the survey is advancing in this part of the section. On closmg for the season at the delta, Assistant Gerdes transferred his. party to Pensacofa, and took up the survey in that vicinity, described under the head of Section VII. In the course of the summer the records of the triangulation. of the delta were duplicated and turned in, with abstracts of the measurements for secondary and tertiary work. Triangulation ef West Cote Blanche bay, La.-Towards the end of l\fan:h Sub-Assistant Oltmanns having reached his working ground, in the schooner Gerdes, from the delta of the Mississippi, where he had been occupied during the winter in the party of A.ssistant Gerdes, placed himself in communication with the hydrographic party, and furnished the data necessary for sounding out the western part of A.tchafalaya bay. On taking up the triangulation it was found that nearly all of the stations westward of Point au Chevreuil had been disturbed by natural causes. Some of the stations which had been marked with the usual care were entirely lost, and neither of the blocks placed to distinguish the ends of the base on Point au Chevreuil could be found. Mr. Oltmanns resumed work at the line Marsh island, North - - Point Malone, (Sketch No. 26,) and extended the triangulation over the greater part of West Cote Blanche bay, including also C6te Blanche island. .All the stations were well secured by screw piles, or by surrounding marks deemed sufficient for their preservation. One of the hindrances to progress in the prosecution of the survey on this part of the coast arises from the shoaling of the water in going westward. The bay, however, narrows in that direction, and Sub-Assistant 6Itmanns reports, as the result of his reconnaissance, that the triangulation may, wit.h lessening difficulty, be carried into and across Vermilion bay.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The observations and computations resulting from them have been furnished in detail for the records of the office. Topography ef Lake Pontchartrai11, La.-Steady progress has been made in pushing the planetable survey westward from the connection between Lake Borgne and J,ake Pontchartrain. Sub-Assistant W. S. Gilbert proceeded from Lis former limits in that quarter on the 17th of January, and laid out two sheets to coutain the features of the northern shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Two others were at the same time projected for extending the work along its southern shore westward from Chef Menteur. On the most eaetern of these the shore-line and adjacent featurefl of the north side of the lake were filled in beyond Bayou Bonfouca, the lower part of that bayou and its branches being a]so fo11owed and included with the topographical details. Further westward, (Sketch No. 26,) and on the same side, the shore-line was traced as far as Ragged Point. The line of woods ranging with the water line was chosen as the limit for the minute survey. From Chef Menteur, on the southern side of Lake Pontchartrain, the detailed work was continued southward and westward to Li'ttle river, and in the same direction the shore-line survey extended to the .Jefferson railroad. The limits of the several sheets are marked on the progress sketch No. 26, on which is also shown the line of junction with the work of last season. In prosecuting the survey on the north shore of the lake, it was found, in many cases, necessary to build stations for the plane-table, the ground passed over being soft marsh. With regard to its general character, the remarks made in my previous annual reports, in reference to the district between Lakes Borgne and Pontchartrain, apply also to the tract under notice.

Sub-Assistant Gilbert was aided during the early part of the year by Mr. R. E. Evans. The field-work was continued until the 13th of June, and the latter part of the summer occupied by Mr. Gilbert in inking his sheets.

Topograpl1y ef the Mississippi Delta, La.-While engaged in the triangulation, Assistant F. H. Gerdes projected a plane-table sheet for the survey of Bay Rondo and the northern part
of the delta, and determined the points necessary for filling in the details. .A.bout two-thirdi of the area intended to be repreRented now appears on the she~t, progress on which was made as the triangulation advanced. Both shores of the Mississippi at the head of the passes, and from thence eastward the shores of the main outlet, with its two branches, the Southeast Pass to the Belize, and the entire course of Pass a l' Outre, were surveyed. The sheet, as marked on Sketch No. 26, contains also the mud flats in the vicinity of the North Pass, part of the details of the system of lagoons existing to the westward of it, and those of Robinson's reef, on the north side of Bay Rondo.

Mr. Gt1rdes thus remarks on the local characteristics of the eastern part of the delta: "With the exception of the Gulf shore, which, north of the delta, is open and composed
partly of beach and hard marsh, the plane-table could be nowhere used, the cane and reeds growing so high as to prevent any sight for sketching in the details. In making the topo~raphica.1 s~rvey, flags of distinctive shape or color were placed at each turn of the riv~r and.

its outlets, and their positions determined from two trigonometrical stations by the theodolite or
sextant. At one reach several miles of the stream were surveyed by means of a signal hoisted on a boat and moved from point to point as occasion required, according to the method proposed . by Mr. Norris. So far as opportunity has offered for verification, the details thus obtained have been found correct." The unfinished portions of the sheet will contain the survey of some interior lakes, small bays, and bayous adjacent to the main eastern outlet of the delt.a..

Mayo aided in the triangulation and topography. .Assistant Gerdes found advantage in his labors at the delta through the interest manifested by the inhabitants generally in regard to the p~ogress of the survey. He acknowledges also the facilitieR and aRRistance rendered to his party by the Pilot Association of the Belize. Part of the plane-table duty conducted by Mr. Gerdes has been noticed with the work done in Section VII. Topogruplty ef 1Vest Cote Blanche bay, La.-Following his own triangulation of this season, Sub-A.ssistant Oltmanns surveyed the shore which fell within its limits, as shown on Sketch No. 26, and included also the northeastern part of Mari:;h island. The plane-table sheet contains an aggregate of about forty-eight miles of shore-line . .A.n extract from the report of Mr. Oltmanns, descriptive of the topographica1 Latures of the vicinity of Cote Blanche bay, is here appended: ''The shores are all very marshy, excepting thm;e of COte Blallche i01land. :Marsh island is so soft and swampy that the utmost cam must be taken in setting up an instrument. Its shores are.subject to frequent and rapid changes. Of late years the island ha<i been cut through in several places, and the interior lakes and bayous are changed or enlarged by almost every storm." " The northern shore of the bay, from COte Blanche about two miles eastward, and westward about eight miles, or as far as Dead Cypress Point, consists of hard clay and is very little broken." " Cote Blanche island, like Belle Isle, is one of those remarkable formations of firm land standing out at intervals along this part of the coast of Louisiana from surrounding marshes. It is about a hundred and twenty feet high, and contains an area of, perhaps, two thousand acres of land, on which are raised sugar-cane, cotton, and tobacco." Having passed the working season at two localities in this section, Mr. Oltmanns sailed for Pensacola, and, after reporting to Assistant Gerdes, proceeded eastward with the vessel and reached New York on the 12th of June.

Soundings in the Rigokts, La.-At an interval in his plane-table duty, in Februar.Y, Sub· Assistant W. S. Gilbert thoroughly sounded out tbe entire course of tho principal passage from Lake Borgne to Lake Pontchartrain, and kept records of the tides \Yhile his party was so engaged. Specimens of the bottom were taken on most of thfl traverse lines, so as to supply full information in regard to the character of the bed of the channel. The tidal

observations developed only a slight variation in the water level, amounting in rise to no more than seven inches in twenty-four hours, and often only four inches and a half. A strong current at that time pmised constantly out of Lake Pontchartrain during both rise and

fall of the tide. Hydrographic reconnaissance ef Pas8 d l' Outre, Mississippi delta.-The party of Lieut. Comg. T. B. Huger, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, arrived at the delta on the 15th of May, having been previously employed with the 8teamer ·walker in the western part of the section. A tide-gauge was at once set up at the revenue station and a careful reconnaissance made of the entire course of tlie Pass a J' Outre from its head, in the Mississippi, to the bar. The vessel then proceeded eastward, 1.aking a line of deep-sea soundings across the Gulf in the direction to Hava11a. The reduction from the chart of soundings made in PasR a l' Outre, under the direction of Lieut. Comg. Huger, comprises also the plane-table work executed by Assistant Gerdes.

Hydrography cf Atchafalaya anrl Cute Blanche bays, La.-The hydrography of Atchafalaya bay has been completed by supplementary soundings carried westward from the limit reached last year by the party in the steamer Walker. In order to facilitate his operations, the draught of the vessel not admitting of her general use in sounding, Lieut. Comg. Huger established a camp about sixteen miles distant from his anchorage, at the entrance of Bayou Sale, Cote Blanche bay, or nearly midway between Point au Ohevreuil and Point Malone, (see Sketch No. 2G.) A second party was detailed to work from the ship. Under this arrangement, after joining on the line to which the work had been extended by Commander B. }'. Sands, and setting the necessary signals and tide-gauges, the soundings werE> continued westward into Cote Blanche bay, with only the impediments duo to the frequent"recurrenco of bad weather. The two divisions of the party were occupied in this duty between the 27th of January and the 14th of May, the latter part of that interval being devoted to the hydrography of the approaches to Atchafalaya bay . .A. summary of statistics derived from the records turnod in by Lieut. Comg. Huger is given below:

FROM VERMILION HAY TO THE BOUNDARY AT THE RIO GRANDE, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF LOUISIANA AND THE COAST OF TEXAS.-( SKETCH I, No. 28.)

The following operations have been in progress by the parties in this section : 1. Triaugulation of Espiritu Santo, San Antonio, and Aransas bays, Texas. 2. Topography of Espiritu Santo and San Antonio bays, Texas. 3. Hydrography of Matagorda bay, Texas. Otfice·work.-The reconnaissance sketch of the entrance to Brazos river has been drawn and engraved, and progress has been made in tho drawing and engraving of coast maps and charts Nos. 106 and 107, from Galveston bay to Matagorda bay; also in the drawing of coast maps and charts No. 105, Galveston bay, and No. 108, Matagorda bay. .A. general reconnaissanco sketch of part of the coast of Texas, from Matagorda bay to Aransas Pass, has been drawn at the office, and was engraved on stone, under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Printing. Triangulation ef Espiritu Santo, San Antonio, and Aransas bays, Tex.-The experienee of previous seasons on the coast of Texas having indicated the opening of the calendar year as the most favorable period for taking up field operations, Assistant S. A.. Gilbert organized a party and reached the limit of his completed triangulation, to the southward of Matagorda bay, on the 5th of January. For the extension of tho work towards Aransas Pass, a close reconnaissance had been made, as stated in my last annual report, which was accompanied by a reduction from the resulting sheet, marked as Sketch No. 28. Such of the signals then erected as required adjustment were properly secured, and others were set to replace those ,,·hich had been destroyed by accidents of the weather in the course of the preceding year. Tlie scheme fixed on for the triangulation took in the lower part of Espiritu Santo bay, the shores of San .Antonio bay, including its upper waters, known as Mission bay and Hines bay ; in connection with it, to the southward and westward, Mezquit bay, and beyond that, in the same direction, the shores of Aransas and Copano bays with their dependencies. These several bodies of water are formed, as may be seen on the progress sketch No. 28, by the intervention of Matagord:.< island and St. Joseph's island between the main coast of Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. The most eastern of the stations occupied for tho triangulation range along the outer or Gulf shore of the two islands just named, the lines from them crossing the several bays before enumerated, and terminating at stations on the main . .Assistant Gilbert continued in the field until the 9th of June, having then pushed the triangulation about forty-eight miles southward and westward from the eitartiug p()int in Espiritu Santo bay. .A summary given in his report shows the following statistics of work done within the season : Stations occupied . · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Points determined in position· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · .Angles measured · · .. · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · Number of observations···· · · · · ·, · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 32 66 180

The triangulation covers an area of about six hundred and fifty square miles. Some of the requisite signals were erected, and a partial reconnaissance made for continuing the work over Corpus Christi bay; but the summer winds set in so strong before the party was disbanded as to render further progress in triangulation impracticable for the present year. Mr. Gilbert was efficiently aided in the field by Mr. Charles Hosmer, who also rendered good service in making computations of the results, and iu duplicatiug the records of the observations, all of which have been turned iu at the office. The following reference is made in the season's report to the general features of the site of work: ''The character of the country we were engaged upon is more diversified than any other portion of the coast of Texas over which my operations have yet extended. Low sandy islands, varying from one to four miles in breadth, stretch along the Gulf coast, with sand hills upon them from ten to forty feet in height. These range along the outer shore, and occupy a space from a quarter to half a mile in width. A fine prairie, averaging three-quarters of a mile in breadth, slopes gradually to the marsh and bare sand flats that form the bay shores. The islands afford an excellent range for cattle, sheep, and horses, there being amongst the sand hills and in the sinks of the prairie an abundance of fresh water, except in the dry season of the year. During all seasons fresh water may be had by digging anywhere among the sand . bills, or in the high prairie, in the strata immediately above the level of the surrounding salt water." "The sheets of water lying between these islands (Matagorda and St. Joseph's) and the main are divided by chains of other islands, by oyster shell reefs, or by the configuration of the shores, into four large bays: Espiritu Santo, San Antonio, Copano, and Aransas bays; and six smaller: Mission, Hines, Mezquit, St. Charles, Refugio Misflion 1 and Puerto bays." Of each of these a general description is contained in the report of Assistant Gilbert, extracts from which will be found in the Appendix, (~o. 32.) I must here commend the character of this report, which is so well adapted to the circumstances of the country through which Mr. Gilbert's work was carried. The original journals containing the notes of horizontal angles and an abstract of the geographical positions determined by the triangulation, have been received at the office. Topography o/ Ewpi.ritu Santo and San Antonio bays, Tex.-The plane·table work in this section was prosecuted by a party in charge of Sub-Assistant W. H. Dennis. .After completing the survey of the city of Indianola, as supplementary to one of the sheets executed last season by Sub-Assistant M. Seaton, Mr. Dennis moved his party to Matagorda island, and there joined with the topographical limits of .Assistant Gilbert, who, as alrnady stated, has been more recently engaged in pushing the triangulation of the coast of Texas towards Corpus Christi. Of the three plane·table sheeta projected by Mr. Dennis, two were entirely :filled and the other partly completed. These include a stretch of twenty miles coastwise, and represent the whole breadth of the middle parts of Matagorda island, the shores of the lower part of Espiritu Santo bay, Mission and Rind's bays, and the shores of the greater part of San .Antonio bay, with the mouth of its principal tributary, the Guadalupe river. The limits of the several sheets iire marked on Sketch No. 28. In general, the surface of the country passed over by the party favored operations with the plane-table, the marsh being tenable, and the fast land mostly level prairie. The only impediment found is thus alluded to in the season's report.: "The survey of Mission bay, with the point extending from it into San .Antonio bay, was attended with some difficult.y, the shores being covered with ca.nebreak some twenty feet high a.nd nearly

Mr. T. C. Bowie served as aid in the topographical party. The report of Sub-Assistant Dennis contains the following remarks relative to the natural features presented on the shores of San Antonio bay: "There is very little timber land within the limits of the work of this season, exce}Jting on the banks of the Guadalupe river, which bas a narrow strip of oak, cedar, etc., on either side. The water at the mouth of that river is fresh, and when the stream is high the fresh water extends nearly to the first chain of islands. The mouth of the Gaudalupe has been dredged out, and a channel has been made through the first chain of islands, by which a steamer from Indianola regularly passes to a landing forty or fifty miles up the river." Sub-Assistant Seaton has inked and placed in the archives the sheets containing his surveys of last year on tl1e shores of Lavaca, Garcitas, and Chocolate bays. The supplementary sheet Ahowing the vicinity of Indianola has also been turned in. In July Sub-Assistant Dennis was assigned to topographical duty in Section I. Hydrograpliy <f .JJfatagorda bay, Tr.x. - I t has been mentioned in a previous chapter th1\t the hydrographic work allotted to be done in this section was assigned for the latter part of the working season to the party of Lieut. Comg. J. K. Duer, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey, the former part being occupied in Section VII. The steamer Vixen, in accordance with this arrangement, arrived at Matagorda on the 19th of April, and at once took up work on the inside of the peninsula, in the immediate vicinity of the city, and between that date and the 3d of June sounded out the portion of the bay which is comprised between lines crossing from the peninsula to the main at Matagorda and Palacios Point. The reach referred to is about sixteen miles in length, by nearly tive in average breadth. Sketch No. 28 shows its location, and the limits of the sheet containing the hydrography. This work was done under the direction of ~fr. A. W. lluldaur, in the absence of Lieut. Comg. Duer, who teturned to Section VII immediately after the arrival of the party in Section IX, and died at Apalachicola on the 14th of June, as already stated. The particulars in regard to this untimely event, and the measures taken for the subsequent disposal of the party and vessel, have also been mentioned.

The usual number of parties has been employed in this section, and their progress is described under the following heads: 1. Primary triangulation near San Pedro, Cal. 2. Triangulation of Santa Rosa island, Cal. 3. Triangulation and topography of San Pedro harbor, Cal. 4. Primary and secondary triangulation north of San Francisco, Cal. 5. Latitude and azimuth. 6.

Soundings off the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco bay, Cal. 11. Resurvey of Humboldt bay, Cal. 12. Hydrography of Crescent City harbor, Cal. 13. Tidal observations. The primary work, which for some years has not made progress proportional to its former development, has this year been placed in the hands of .Assistant George Davidson, whose wellknown zeal, and energy, and skill have all been shown in its prosecution, so that the advance has been entirely satisfactory, under difficulties which have required all his resources to sur· mount. The resurvey of San Pedro and Crescent City harbors was called for in consequence of the improvements made or contemplated in those localities and in the back country which finds access to the sea at those ports. O.ffice-work.-The engraving of the charts of San Diego bay, the entrance to San Francisco bay, Marc Jsland straits, and Humboldt bay, has been finished. Progress has been made in the engraving of the chart of ~an Pablo bay, and additions have be.en made to the sheets of Alden's reconnaissance of the Western CoaBt. The map of San Francisco city has been en· graved on stone, under the direction of the Superintendent of Public Printing. Primary triang1llation 'IU'ar San Pedro, Cal.~I~ adjusting the triangulation along the coast of t.&e:Santa Barham channel, it was found necessary to reoccupy several of the stations conneeting with the preliminary base measured near San Pedro. This duty was performed by Assistant W. E. Greenwell, between the 5th of November, 1858, and the 6th of March following. The revised triangles are laid out on Sketch No. 30. On being tested. in the usual way they were found to close within the limits allowed for general accuracy.

The horizontal angles were measured with the eight-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 44. Mr. Greenwell used the schooner Humboldt for this and other service performed in the section. Duplicates of the notes of horizontal angles observed in the primary work of last year have been furnished for the records of the office. Triangulation of Santa Rosa island, Cal.-This work was commenced by Assistant Greenwell on the 8th of June, by the measurement of a short base on the northern part of the island, the location of which may be seen by reference to Sketch No .·30. The triangulation., as far as completed at the end of August, embraces the northern half of the area of Santa Rosa, and the work was then in active progress. Strong northwest gales prevailed between the dates mentioned, tending very much to retard the advance of field operations. A summary of the statistics is thus given in the report of Mr. Greenwell:

Assistant Greenwell ha"' sent in duplicates of the observations recorded in the triangulation of San Miguel and San Nicolas islands, and notes of the measurement of the preliminary base on Santa Cruz island. Triangulatinn and topography of San Pedro harbor, Cal.-This duty was executed by Sub.Assistant W. M. Johnson, and the data necessary for the hydrography furnished to Commander Alden. The scheme of triangulation laid out to include the shore of the harbor at San Pedro is shown on Sketch No. 30. With the view of following at once with the plane-table survey the necessary points were determined while the preliminary work was going on. )fr. Johnson then projected a sheet and pushed on the topography to completion. The sheet containing his survey embraces an area of about thirteen square miles, over sixty miles of snore-line, and nineteen miles of roads. Sub-Assistant C. M. Bache was attached to the party. The triangulation emlmiced nine triangles within an area of fifteen square miles. Four hundred and eighty-six. observations were made in the measurement of angles. Primary and seoondary trianguloti<m 'IWrth of San Francisco, Oal.-This work and the astronomical observations connected with it were taken in charge by Assistant George Davidson on the 14th of November, 1858, immediately after his return to the Western Coast. In the primary triangulation Table mountain, a precipitous height which rises from the shore of Ballenas bay, and Sulphur Peak, a high mountain well up the course of Russian river on its eastern side, were occupied as stations with the theodolite, and horizontal angles measured so as to co~plete, with the exception of Ross mountain station, the coast series of triangles from Monterey and over San Francisco bay to the last-mentioned point, the position of which may 13

be seen on Sketch No. 31. .At Mount Diablo, one of the primary stations in the general scheme and in immediate connection with Table mountain, the labor and expense of transporting a solid signal to the summit, which is 3, 800 feet above the nearest dwelling, were obviated by Mr. Davidson, who thus describes the expedient employed for that purpose: "The signal was constructed at San Francisco, and consisted of six pieces of two-inch Oregon pine fitted to six appropriate inside bearings, PO that, when put together, the whole presented externally the appearance of the frustrum of a cone thirty-five feet high, with a diameter of fifteen inches at the base and ten at the top. The separate pieces and their bearings, being previously provided with screws, were carried up the mountain and fastened together in half an hour. Stout iron bands were driven on to bind all the pieces firmly together, and the hollow shaft was then set and secured in its proper position. Even with the advantage of the method employed, the handling of the parts of the signal in passing to the summit proved to be v.ery hard labor. If the canadas of the mountain side had afforded a solid piece of timber of similar outside dimensions, no u vailable power could have taken it up." Vertical angles were measured from the station on Table mountain, and also from that on Sulphur Peak. Ross mountain, which lies near the coast and a few miles north of the mouth of Russian river, will be occupied next in order by the party of Assistant Davidson. The secondary and tertiary triangulations, extended this season over Drake's bay and Point Reyes are also shown on Sketch No. 31, and from Table mountain, Point Reyes Hill, and Point Reyes Head, horizontal angles were measured to determine the positions, extent, and heights of the islets ·which form the middle and north groups of the Farallones. The reconnaissance necessary in advance of occupying stations for th(l primary and secondary work was made by }fr. E. H. Fauntleroy, one of the aids in the party. .At the date of .Assistant Davidson's report Mr. Fauntleroy, in conjunction with Mr . .A.. T. Mosman, who was detailed as an aid to this party in June, were reconnoitering the tract lying northward and westward of Sulphur Peak. The privations to be borne in the performance of such duty over a country naturally wi.ld and rugged, and totally devoid of facilities for travel, are very great. The labors of the triangulation party in pushing the work to its present limit, as set forth in the report of Mr. Davidson, have been attended with unusual hardships and difficulties.

divisions of the vertical circle No. 80. Those of the levels A and B of zenith telescope No. 3, and of level A of transit No. 2 were determined at Sulphur Peak by using the vertical circle No. 28, and a hundred and sixty-two observations were made for that purpose. In the ensuing season Ross mountain will be occupied as an astronomical station. Meteorological journals were kept while the party was employed in the field. Ten volumes, containing the original records of the triangulation and astronomical observations, and seven others, duplicates of the same, have been received from 1\fr. Davidson. His computations depending on the original notes of the work have been completed. The journals kept by Assistant G. A. Fairfield while the work north of San Francisco was under his charge havtl been filed at the office. Triangul,a,tion ef Crescent City harbor, Cal.-This duty was executed under special directions in April, by the party of Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson, before taking up the general field-work to which it had been assigned in the adjoining northern section. A preliminary base was laid out in front of Crescent City and measured twice with a twenty-metre chain, previously adjusted for that particular purpose. The measurements gave a mean result of 1,018.6 metres for the length of the line. Stations were then erected at intervals along the coast from a point a mile west of the light-house to another four miles to the eastward of Crescent City, and on all the prominent rocks in the harbor. Twelve signals were set up and sixty objects in all observed on in determining the angles. In addition to these, readings were taken on a hundred and fifty objects, the results of which, as determining them in position, were computed at once and plotted for use in the topographical survey. Sketch No. 31 gives a plan of the completed triangulation.

A duplicate of the record of horizontal angles observed by Sub-Assistant Lawson is now on file at the office. Topography of Santa Oruz island, Oal.-The survey of this island was resumed by Sub. Assistant W. M. Johnson, after completing :field-work at San Pedro, of which notice has already been taken in the former part of this chapter, and has been prosecuted along the north shore so as to include Prisoner's harbor and Chinese harbor, with only such interruptions aa are incident to its ex.posed position. The report of Mr. Johnson states that there are but three places on the island available as centres for working, by reason of the great difficulty of procuring wood and water, and that great impediments are found in the violent northwest winds, which set in daily at 10 a. m. during summer and continue until sunset. The progress made is shown in the following statistics:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Topography qf OrescenJ, (Jity harbor, (Jal.-The triangulation requisite for the plane-table snrvey and hydrography was made, as already stated, by Sub-Assistant J. S. J,awson, in April. Having provided a sufficient number of points, Mr. Lawson traced, in the shore-line of the harbor and the adjacent coast from Hall's bluff west of the light-house, as seen on Sketch No. 31, to the eastern limit of the triangulation, or about four miles eastward of Crescent City. ''Especial care was taken to determine the position of every rock bare at low water. Between Battery Point and Preston's island many of the plane-table stations were reoccupied as near the time of low water as possible, for securing accuracy of details in that respect.'' A tracing from the working sheet was promptly made and furnished to the hydrographic party of Commander Alden. The original was soon after inked and sent to the office with the following memorandum of statistics: Shore-line surveyed .··... · · .. · .. · .. · .. · · ·.· · · .... · · · · · · · · 8. 2 giiles.

Sub-Assistant Lawson was accompanied by Mr. Alexander Agassiz as aid. Hydrography qf San Pedro harbor, Oal.-As part of the regular work of the season, the anchorage at San Pedro and its vicinity were sounded out anew by the party of Commander Ju.mes Alden, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, with the steamer Active. Sketch No. 30 shows the limits of the sheet, which was projected so as to include the hydrography of the approach eastward and southward by Point Fermin. The resulting chart (Sketch No. 32) verifies the soundings made in the reconnaissance of 1852, and in reference to it Commander Alden says: "The bar at the entrance to the creek remains about the same. At mean low water, throwing out the half tides, only two feet of water can be carried over it. The steamer Active could go in easily at high water." Sub-Assistant Johnson traced the shore-line for the use of the hydrographic party. The following is a summary from the journals of soundings and angles: Miles run in sounding · · · · · · · · · · · · · · . · · · .......... · . . . . . . . . . . 209 Angles measured ....·... · · · · · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1, 208 Casts of the lead . · · · · · .. · · · .. · · · · . . . . . . . . . . . · · · . . · . . . . . . · . · . 5, 866 Soundirn.JB off the Golden Gate, entrance to San Fran<,isco bay, Oal.-At favorable intervals during the winter of 1858-' 59 the hydrography outside of San Francisco bar was executed by the party of Commander .A.Iden, with the surveying steamer Active. The work was extended about thirty miles abreast of the entrance, as measured from Point Reyes southward and eastward along the line of junction with the soundings carried from the inside of the bar in 1854. From the bar, broad off to seaward, the hydrography now extends about twenty-five miles westward, or five miles beyond the meridian of the Farallones. The limits of this work are marked on the Progress Sketch No. 31. In making the soundings sixty-three specimens of bottom were brought up from different localities of the space passed over by the vessel.

The survey of the approaches to the Golden Gate was essentially completed by the end of February. Resurvey ef Humb&dt bay, Oal.-On the upward passage of the steamer Active for duty in the adjoining northern section, Commander Alden incidentally made a resurvey of Humboldt bay above and below the entrance, as shown on Sketch No. 31. The soundings were taken between the 11th and 22d of July, and were applied in completing the chart which accompanied my last published annual report as Sketch No. 31.

Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson made the plane-table survey in a previous season. The original sheet containing the soundings last made is now at the office. Hydrography ef Crescent City harbor, Cal.-This work was based on the triangulation and topography executed in the early part of the year, as already detailed. The soundings were made in July by the party of Commander .A.Iden in the surveying steamer Active. In reporting on the completion of the hydrography, Commander .A.Iden remarks: "During the progress of the survey of Crescent City harbor we found several new and dangerous rocks, but as tf:ey are not lying immediately in the channels followed by the steamers, and do not interfere with the anchorage in use, it does not seem necessary to notice them further in advance of the publication of the chart, as every one now trading there knows that vessels drawing over nine feet should be very cautious in venturing out of the beaten track. The rocks at that place are of a peculiar character, standing isolated like bayonets, with their points juet below the surface, and ready to pierce any unlucky craft that may encounter them. After we finished the survey and I had selected a particular fair way for a sailing line, we discovered a very sharp rock almost directly in the passage, with its point only three feet from the surface, and deep water all a.round it. I mention this to show that although the greatest care was taken in the survey, the character of the points of rock is such that it cannot be surprising if a new one is found for several seasons to come. Still, by following the track: which has been passed over so often by heavily laden steamers, no danger need be apprehended." An engraved reduction from the sheets containing the survey of Crescent City harbor accompanies this report, as Sketch No. 33. The original chart is now at the office. .A. summary of the hydrographic statistics is thus given in the report of Commander Alden: Miles run in sounding .... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · 101 .A.ogles measured · · ... · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 701 Number of casts of the lead · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · - · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · · 3, 221 After completing this work: the party in the Active proceeded to Section XI, under which head further notice will be made of its occupation.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

SECTION XI.
WESTERN COAST, FROM THE FORTY-SECOND PARALLEL TO THE NORTHWESTERN DOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE COAST OF OREGON A.ND THAT OF WASHINGTON TEBRITORY.-

(SKnml K, No. 35.)

The regular work of this section has necessarily given place to that connected with the boundary, and has been further impeded by the necessity for placing the hydrographic vessel, the steamer "Active," at the disposal of the War Department. (Appendix No. 36.) The following work has been executed in this section, and is reported upon in this chapter: 1. Triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia, W. T. 2. Reconnaissance of Coquille river entrance, Oregon. 3. Hydrographic reconnaissance of Gray's harbor, W. T. 4. Tidal observations. Qtfice-'WQTk.-A new edition of the reconnaissance sketch of Washington sound, W. T., and the chart of Port Townshend have been drawn and engraved, and the engraving of the charts of Port Gamble and Semi-ah-moo bay has been completed. Triangulation o/ the Gulf o/ Georgia, W. T.-The field-work in this section was confined mainly to the triangulat,ion of the Gulf of Georgia, abreast of Point Roberts, and in the vicinity of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, but owing to the prevalence of smoke in the atmosphere during the entire season the progress expected at its outset has not been made. Sub-Assistant James S. Lawson, who conducted the operations and improved every opportunity for advancing the triangulation, says, in allusion to the hindrance from this cause: ''Thus far, during the present season, the weather has furnished another illustration of the experience of former years, that each alternate season is very dry, and consequently that the immense fires started by the Indians sweep over a vast extent of country, so that it is often ivipossible to see, at the same time, both shores of the channels. During the last three months of the working season of 1857 we were often anchored within a quarter of a mile of the shore and could not see it. Last year was just the reverse, owing to the quantity of rain that fell tending to extinguish, or at least retard, the progress of the fires." * * * * * * "In carrying the work forward from the limits of last year, I laid out a scheme of triangulation ~hich seemed the very best that the conformation of the country would allow, as it tended to carry the work to the forty-ninth parallel with the least number of triangles. The lengths of the sides, however, were too great for observing on through the smoky atmosphere, and I have been compelled to change the plan and adapt my operations to circumstances." The stations occupied or observed on by Mr. Lawson, as will he seen by reference to Sketch No. 34, range along the northern shores of the chain of islands bounding the Gulf of Georgia, from Patos island westward to a station on the upper part of Galiano island. Theee connect by lines with several stations established on Point Roberts, the positions of which are marked on the Progress Sketch. The following is a summary of the statistics of the season:

The horizontal angles were measured with the ten-inch Gambey theodolite, C. S. No. 20. Vertical angles also were measured by Mr. Lawson, and a hundred and thirty observations recorded for determining the height of the two summits of Mt. Baker, and that of the limit of snow. The snow range was computed by Mr. Alexander Agassiz, the aid in the party, to be at an elevation of 3, 145 feet. A further remark made by Sub-A~sistant Lawson, in !1is report, refers to one of the most perplexing hindrances found in .prosecuting the triangulation in the northern part of this section: ".A. necessary result of such a state of the atmosphere as that which I have mentioned is a remarkable range in refraction, but in no case have I ever seen it equal to what was experienced at the last station occupied. In one of the angles there was a range of 41".3 in the various sets of observations, and in each of two others the range was as much as 35". 7. This large refraction occurs almost invariably at times when, during the whole or part of the day, the atmosphere has become remarkably clear and when the signals show very plainly and steadily. There is then no way of discovering the refraction except from the observations themselves. Usually it shows itRelf by the distorted appearance of the shores." Copies of all the plane-table sheets traced by Mr. Lawson during last season were furnished to the commissioner on the northwestern boundary, Archibald Campbell, esq. The originals are now at the office. The mark at the southern end of the base on Lummi island having been washed from its place by a gale in the winter of 1857-' 58, Sub-Assistant Lawson occupied the stations connecting with it, and took suitable means for re-establishing the mark. He is now supplied with the improved apparatus described in my annual report for 1857, and having already graded and leveled the site of the base, the line will be remeasured as early as practicable in the ensuing season. A meteorological register was kept, while the party waA at work, of barometer readings, temperature, kind and amount of clouds, direction and force of the wind, and a record of the quantity of rain. The duplicates of field notes were made, and abstracts and computations of the triangulation kept up to date as the work advanced. Those connected with the operations of last year are now at the office. Four volumes, containing the recorded meteorological observations made in this section in previous seasons, have been turned in by Assistant George Davidson. The brig Fauntleroy was used by Sub-Assistant Lawson for transportation and quarters in the Gulf of Georgia. At the c1ose of the working Reason the vessel returned to San Francisco. lleooMai88a11ce qf Coquille RitJer entrance, Or~n.-With a view of making a hydrographic examination of the bar and channel of the Coquille river, Commander James Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, attempted the entrance with the steamer Active, on her downward passage from his field of duty in connection with the Northwestern Boundary Commission, and found it, a.s was e'Xpected, inaccessible for vessels of ordinary draught. .An accident to the centre shaft of the steamer, while in that vicinity, made it indispensable for the safety of thti vessel that her voyage to San Francisco should not be at that time delayed. The purpose of Commander .A.Iden is to approach the Coquille entrance by land from Port

REPORT OF THE !SUPERINTENDENT OF

Orford, before the close of the year, if practicable, and t-0 make a reconnaissance and soundings so as to fully determine the character of the river as a harbor of entrance. Hydrographic recoonaissance of Gray's harbor, W. T. -In laying out the programme for the season's operations in this section, it was expected that the only field party for which the means are available might probably complete the special duty enjoined, in connection with the survey for the commissioner on the northwestern boundary, in time to admit of taking up the triangulation and topography of Gray's harbor within the present surveying year. This expectation, in consequence of the unfavorable weather, which, as already stated at the outset of this chapter, interfered materially with field progress in the northern part of the section, has not been met, and the basis of the hydrography is yet wanting. The impediments referred to being within the knowledge of Commander .Alden, a visit was made to the harbor in the steamer Active, and such an examination conducted as could be made in advance of the close determination of points along the shores by the land party. In allusion to his reconnaissance Commander Alden says : "The result shows that t.he harbor has a bar over which can be carried from two and a half to three and a ha.If fathoms of water. It was tolerably smooth during the flood, but when the ebb tide made: the sea broke entirely across the entrance. The soundings made inside correspond very closely with those on the chart of the U. S. Exploring Expedition ; and it would seem, as there is no bar laid down, that the snrvey just referred to was not carried quite out to it, or that thel"e has been an important change since it was executed in 1841."

OFFICE-WORK.

The Coast Survey Office in Washington city has, during the year, remained under the charge of Captain W. B. PaJ,mer, U. S. Topographi,caJ, Etu)i,neers, who has, a8 usual, administered it efficiently and acceptably. In the intervals of hill absence, the duties devolving on him were discharged by IM:utena:ni A. P. Hi1J., ll. S . .A., whose connection with the office and efficiency as general assistant have been referred to in my previous annnal reports. The report of Captain Palmer, given in .Appendix No 17, and accompanied by detailed atatements from the chiefs, of the several office divisi()ns, show the occupation of the persons engaged in them within the year, and the scope and relation of the office as connected with the field· work of the survey. No change has been made in the allotment of the material received from the field, the past working of the divisions, as organized several years ago, having eD.ntinued to meet the requirements of the survey and the calls incident thereto. In the order in which the office divisions have been heretofore named, summary notices are here appended of the employments in each.

King served temporarily in this division duriug poirt of the year. DRAWING DrvrsroN.-Until the end of June this division remained in charge of Lieut. J. U. Tidball, U.S. A., and his effective supervision is referred to in the report of Lieut. '.f'}wrna.s Wi"8on, U. S. A., under whose direction the duties have been carried on since that date. The distribution of work has been as follows: Assistants W. Ji. C. Fai1:fax and .ilI. J. McClery on reductions of topography, the llltter also in maJ.:ing additions to the Congress map; Jlr. A. Boschke on projects; Mr. A. Lindenkohl on reductions, projections, and verification; 11fr. A. Ba'lhach, during part of the season, on hydrographic reductions, and now on general duty as draughtsman in the hydrographic division; Mr. E. Hergesheimer on verification and hydrographic reductions; Mr. W. P. Sc ulz on reductions of various kinds, progress sketches, projects, and projections; Mr. L. D. Williams on fine roduetions and verification; Mr. A. Strausz on soundings for charts; Mr. W. T. Martin on topographical drawing; Nr. P. Witzel on projections and preliminary charts; Mr. S. B. Linton on lettering, and in making additions to the progress sketches; Mr. F. Fairfax on general topography and tracings; and Mr. B. Hooe and Ariijicer J. A. Campbell on tracings generally. ENGRAVING DrvrsroN.-The duties of this division were conducted by Lieut. Rufus Saxton, U. S. A., until the 1st of April. Since that date the division has been temporarily in charge of Mr. Edward Whart.ou. The allotment of work to the engravers regularly employed has differed but little from tha.t of

Sipe, on progress and other sketches, and miscellaneous work. ELECTROTYPE AND PHOTOGRAPH DrvrsION.-The report of Mr. George JJ.fothi'.ot, subjoined to that of the assistant in charge, in .Appendix No. 17, gives in detail a statement of the work done in tho division within the year. In addition to his regular duties, Mr. Mathiot bas made numerous trials, resulting at length in the successful application of the photographic process as r. sub;;;titute for hand reductions for the engraver. I have already stated at more length the progress made in this important branch of the service in the introduction of this report. In all the labors of the division Mr. Mathiot was assisted by lur. IJavid Hinkle, whose application to its various duties are specially mentioned in the report already referred to. MISCELLANEOUS DrYISION.-Uuder this head are classed the printing and distribution of maps and charts, and the distribution of the office complement of the annual reports. The report of Lieut. J. R. Smead, []. S . .A.., who took charge on the detachment from the Coast Survey of Lieut. J. P. Ruy, U. S. A., in last June, shows that the activity required in this division has been fully kept up. Over fifteen thousand copies of various charts have been distributed during the year, and an aggregate of six thousand eight hundred and seventeen copies of the annual reports and accompanying sketches. Lieut. Smead bas been assisted by Mr. V. E. King, who also performs clerical duty in the oflice of the assistant in charge. The printing has been performed, a.ii! heretofore, by Mr. J. R-utherdale, aided by Mr. J. Barrett.

Mr. F. Holden continued, until near the close of the present surveying year, on duty in the map room, and was employed in backing and preparing paper to be used as projections for plane-table and hydrographic sheets. This duty, since the 1st of September, has been performed by Mr. W. Mertz. The space required for the constant additions to the archives of the survey is referred to by
the assistant in charge as being yet unprovided for. Part of the inconvenience felt arises from the risk of transferring for deposit the original maps and charts to any but a thoroughly fire· proof building.

In the carpentry, the various calls and requirements incidental to the work of the survey have been met as usual. The labors of the shop, which have been conducted, as heretofore, by Mr. .A. Yeatman, are stated in detail in the report of the assistant in charge of the office, as are also those of the instrument shop, in which the work is directed by .Mr. J. V-ierbuchen. Captain Palmer specially commends the zeal and ability of his principal clerk, .A.. W. Rus· sell, esq.

Assistant L. F. Pourtales, in charge of the tidal division, and Professor JV. P. Truicbrirlge, whose duties connected with the preparation of a portion of the records for publication ha,-e been before alluded to, have rendered acceptable assistance in certain special discussions conducted under my immediate direction. Commander S. S. Lee, U. S. N., took charge of the hydrograpbic di Yision of the office on the 1st of September, and has discharged, also, the duties of hydrographic inspector, attending to the repairs and outfit of the vessels used by all the parties of the survey. The knowledge possessed by Commilnder Lee of construction and equipment has, under the general rules and arrangements adopted first at the suggestion of Lieutenant :\faffitt, introduced an efficiency into this branch of the service which insnres for the future decided economy. ]Jfr. A. Balbaclz has assisted in the hydrographic divit1ion as clerk and draughtsman. I have only to reiterate the expression of the opinion which I entertain of the great value of the services of Samuel Hein, esq., general disbursing agent of the Coast Survey, and of those of the principal clerk in the Superintendent's office, TY.

COAST SURVEY STATION,

Near Lane's Brook, Maine, Septcmbe,r 27, 1859.
DEAR Sm: The report that one or more ve;isels had struck upon the shoal off the Battery, where it was generally supposed there was deep water, induced one of the pilot commissioners, George W. Blunt, esq., to call my attention to the desirableness of a resurvey of the shoal. It was assigned to Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, then assistant in the Coast Survey, who having been charged with the hydrography of New York harbor, for the commissioners on harbor encroachments, was familiar with every part of the shoal. His report, recently presented to me, gives in detail the changes which have occurred, and shows prospectively those which may be expected. It is important, and I therefore beg leave through you to call the attention of the Chamber of Commerce to it. The filling up between pier No. 1 and the Castle may readily be avoided by dredging, and no doubt the entire completion of the Battery work would retard the now rapid increase of the shoal. The shoal must, however, in a general way, be related to the new shore, line as the old was to the forill;er shore, and thus the shoal while

changed in form must be pushed out to a distance, not equal, but corresponding to the addition to the shore-line of the Battery. Yourfl, respectfully, .A. D. BA.CHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey. PELATIAII PERIT, Esq., Pre.~ident Chamber of Cornmercr, New York.

Ooa.~t

NEW YORK, September 20, 1859. Sm: In compliance with your directions in .July last, I made an examination of the shoal off the Battery, New York, for the purpose of ascertaining what changes have taken place in that locality, and I herewith submit to you a map of the survey, scale -,/-075 , on which I have also had the soundingR placed from the surveys of 1855 and 1856 for comparison. The soundings of 1855 and 1856 are in red figures, and the curves are alt>o distinctly drawn. In order to make this discussion as explicit a~ possible, I divide the shoal into sections, and call your attention to each position separately: you will be much interested in observing

the rapidity with wbich the shoal is accumulating, and with what regularity the deposits are being made: Section I, from pier No. 1, North river, to Castle Garden. In the angle formed by the line of the Battery and the pier tbere bas beeu a very rapid filling up, the 3-fathom curve has been pushed outward eighty yards beyond the line of 1856; the 17 feet spot in the outer part of this section is extending towards pier No. 1, and there is an average decrease of three feet in depth throughout this section. Sectwn II extends to the 3-fathom curve of 1856. In this portion of the shoal the change has been not less considerable than in the angle of pier No. 1. The 3-fathom curve was, in 1856, about seventy-five yards south of the Castle, it will be seen that it has extended towards the Castle wharf, and embraces a considerable area where formerly we had five fathoms; outside of this curve, we find in this section a general decrease of five feet in the depth. Sectwn III embraces the general shoal to the southeastern portion of the curve of 3 fathoms. Excepting in the part already indicated, there has been no material change in the general contour of the shoal, but in following the curve to its southernmost point it will be seen that it has extended about one hundred feet to the southward. Section IV extends from last section to the East ri.ver piers. In calling your attention to this section, I will merely refer to the knoll lying auout W.SW. from pier No. 1, East river. This knoll has eighteen feet water upon it, is very small, and has deep water outside and close to it; there is no change in depth on the knoll, but it is extending itself towards the north, and it will be seen that in that direction there is a decrease of two feet in the depth near the shoal. East of this knoll there is no apparent change. Drawing a waved line from the last mentioned

134

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

knoll to the Castle Garden, you mark out the eddy waters of this part of the river; the currents of the two rivers meeting here at ebb and dividing at flood; this portion of the stream being too sluggish to carry off matters held in suspension, they are rapidly and constantly deposited . .Although from natural causes there must always have been a shoal off this point of the island, its accumulation has been evidently aided to a startling degree by the extension of the Battery. The currents which formerly flowed between the Castle Garden and the shore, made the greater portion of their deposit so near the shores as to cause no great injury to the operations of commerce, and the process of deposit was so gradual that it would have required an , interval of many years ere the sl10al would have seriously encroached on the waters of the bay, but the battery extension has already accomplished that which would have required a half century of the operations of nature, having pushed the shoal out as the shore line was changed. In illustration of this assertion, we have but to look at the extraordinary heaping up of the earth in the angle formed by the Battery wall and pier No. 1; a heaping up, made by the ebb current of the North river, ·which as it comes around the pier is now turned back and formed into eddies by the Battery walls. This current formerly ran through the spare now covered by the filling in, and poured the suspended matter into the East river, off White Hall, from whence it was carried away and distributed in the deep waters of the bay, but now a large portion of the sediment brought dmvn by the ebb is doubtless filling in the space here with great rapidity; its effect8 are still more strongly visible in the section off the Castle, where we see changes of six and eight feet in the space of three years; this is due to the united efforts of the ebbs from the two rivers, and the time cannot be far distant when, unless dredging is resorted to, the entire space from the Castle to the head of pier No. 1 will be quite filled in. In addition to the material damage done by thus forcing out into the stream a shoal which was heretofore of little consequence, it may safely be presumed that in filling in for the Battery extension very liberal supplies have been contributed to the shoal from tho dirt carts, as without the security of a regular sea wall, immense quantities of the loose earth must from time to time be washed away and added to the shoal, and it is probable that when t.he slowly progressing enlargement is completed and the walls finished the changes will be less rapid. The injury is now without other remedy than that of hastening to its completion a work which has proved so seriously disastrous to this already crowded part of the harbor, and by legislation preventing any extensions beyond the lines of the city as defined by the harbor comm1ss10ners. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, T. A..UGS. ORA. VEN, Prof. A. D.

REPORT ON HARBOR ENCROACHMENTS.

Mr. G. W. Blunt presented the report of the committee on the subject of harbor encroachments, as follows: The committee appointed to report upon the evils arising from the extension of the Battery, having been requested to ext.end their inquiries in order to ascertain if a.ny and what other

THB l;'NITED STATES COAST SCRVEY.

135

abuses existed in the harbor, beg leave to report a few of the most important, and to propose a mode of abating or remedying them. First in order among the abuses is that of an encroachment. The committee would mention West Washington Market, where five acres have been taken or filled in from the waters of the North river; likewise pier No. 51, North river, extended thirty-three feet beyond the exterior line established by law. These are the acts of the city authorities. The Lowber extension at the foot of Fourteenth street, East river, and the piles just driven at the outer end of pier No. 29, East i·iver, which vier was already some twenty-five feet beyond the established limits, are instances of encroachments by private parties. Next in order is the sewerage. It has been ascertained that the slips in the harbor have been filled up nearly eighteen inches each year, by material discharged from the sewers, of which only four out of one hundred and ten discharge at the outer end of the piers, the remainder discharge into the still waters of the slips or basins, where there is no current to carry off the deposits.

Dumping grounds.
These are the places where the dirt swept from the streets of the city is deposited by order of the city inspector. They arc eight in number, viz: At the foot of Vesey, Watts, Gansevoort, and Twenty-sixth streets, North river; Rooseveli, Stanton, Fifth, and Twenty-third streets, East river. The dirt is continually being dropped into the waters of the harbor and filling up the slips, from the practice of heaping it up on the piers and bulkheads. During last month the pier at the foot of twenty-third street, East river, gave way from the accumulation of dirt upon it, and 3,000 cart loads were thus thrown into the river.

Remedies.
All parties encroaching upon the waters of the liarbur, beyond the established limits, should be punished by sufficient penaltiefl, and the harbor commissioners should have power to remove the encroachments at once, the offending parties to pay all expenses incurred in such removal. All new sewers should be carried to the outer ends of the piers, (which we believe to be the intention of the Croton Aqueduct department, which has charge of the construction of sewers,) and, where practicable, the termination of those now built should be changed so as to empty in like manner with the new ones. The cisterns at the corners of the streets communicating with the sewers should invariably be cleaned out weekly, which would be the great preventive of filling up the slips from the sewers. No dumping should be permitted upon or near the piers or bulkheads, under a penalty; and the city inspectors should be required to have scows or other vessels provided and ready to receive the dirt from the carts, there being no good reason why dirt should have a preference over ii,ll other articles in the use of our piers and bulkheads. The shore-line belonging to the State of New York, in the harbor of New York, under the control of the harbor commissioners, is over seventy miles in extent; no part of it can be extended into the rivers beyond the established limits, without doing injustice to the harbor and injustice to those who respect the law. An instance is before us in the case of pier No. 51, North river, extended beyoud the line as above stated; the comptroller of the city having allowed the lessee of pier 52 one thousand dollars reduction en hia rent, on account of the damage done to him by the illegal ~xtension.

The committee would recommend to the chamber that application be made to the legislature to legalize the remedies suggested in this report, and to the corporation of this city, that measures be taken to finish the extension of the Battery at once. In closing their report, the committee would bear testimony to the great and continued interest shown by Professor A. D. Bache, Superintendent of the United States Coast Survey, for the preservation of our harbor, in having obtained and furnished to it all the information necessary to the forming of an intelligent opinion upon the subject under consideration.

APPENDIX No. 14.
Tide tab'lesfor the use if navigators, prepared from the Coast Survey observations by A. D. Bache, Superintendent. (Furnished, by authority qf the Treasury Department, to E. &: G. W. Blunt, New York, and revised October, 1859.)
The following tables will enable navigators to ascertain the time and height of high and low water iu some of the principal ports of the United States. The results are approximate, the observations being still in progress; but they may safely be used for practical purposes. The number of places of observation, and the time during which many of them have been made, are steadily on the increase as the Coast Survey advances. The tides on the coast of the United States, on the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, are of three different classes. Those of the Atlantic are of the most ordinary type, ebbing and flowing twice in twenty-four hours. and having but moderate differences in height between the two successive high waters or low waters, one occurring before noon, the other after noon. Those of the Pacific coast also ebb and flow twice during twenty-four hours; but the morning and afternoon tides differ very considerably in height, so much so that at certain periods a rock which has three feet and a half water upon it at low tide may be awash on the next succeeding low water. The intervals, too, between successive high and successive low waters may be very unequal. The tides of ports in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Cape St. George, ebb and flow, as a rule, but once in twenty.four hours, or are single day tides. At particular parts of the month there are two small tides in the twenty-four hours. The rise and fall in all these ports is small. East of Cape St. George the rise and foll increases; there are two tides, as a rule, during the twenty-four hours, and the daily inequality referred to in the Pacific tides is large.

THE UNITED ST.A.TES CO.AST SURVEY.

137

These peculiarities require a different way of treating the cases, and in some of them separate tables. I propose to enable the navigator to find, from the Nautical Almanac and the following tables, the time and height of high and low water at any date within the ordinary range of difference produced by winds and other variable circumstances. I will endeavor to divest the matter of unfamiliar technical expressions as far as practicable, though, for shortness' sake, some such terms may be employed after defining them. The discussion of the Gulf tides has not been carried so far as to enable me to present the results in as definite a form as the others. As is well known, the interval between the time of the moon's crossing the meridian (moon's transit) and the time of high water at a given place is nearly constant; that is, this interval varies between moderate limits, which can be assigned. The interval at full and change of the moon is known as the establishment of the port, and is ordinarily marked on the charts. As it is not generally the average of the interval during a month's tide, it is a less convenient and less accurate quantity for the use of the navigator than the average interval which is used on the Coast Survey charts, and is sometimes called the '' mean'' or '' corrected establishment.''* The following table gives the principal tidal quantities for the different ports named in the first column, where they are arranged under specific heads. The third column of the table gives the mean interval, in hours and minutes, between the moon's transit and the time of high water next after the transit; the fourth, the difference between the greatest and the least interval occurring in different parts of the month, (lunar.) A simple inspection of this column will show how important it is to determine these changes in many of the ports where they amount to more than half an hour, or to more than fifteen minutes from the average interval. The fifth, sixth, and seventh columns refer to the height of the tide. The fifth gives, in feet, the average rise and fall, or average difference between high and low water. The sixth gives the greatest difference, commonly known as the rise and fall of spring tides; and the seventh the least difference, known as the rise and foll of the neap tides. The average duration of the flood or rising tide is given in the eighth column; of the ebb or falling tide in the ninth; and of the period during which the tide neither rises nor falls, or the " stand," in the tenth. The duration of the flood is measured from the middle of the stand at low water to the middle of the stand at high water; so that the whole duratiof! from one high water to the next, or from one low water to the next, should be given by the sum of the numbers in the eighth and ninth columns. At most of these places given in the list a mark of reference has been established for the height of the tide. I have omitted the description of these marks (except in the following localities) as of no pQrticula.r interest in this oonnection. BENCH-MARKS.

· Bee remarb on page 144 and following.

Non.-Tbe mean interval ln column 3 bas been increued by 121&. 26m. (half a mean lunar day) for oome of the pol'll! in Delaw...., river and Obe1&peake bay, "" u ID aoow the 1u..ceuion of times from the mouth. Tb·refore, 124. 26m. ourbt 10 be subtraeted from the 0B1ahliabments which are sreater than that quantity before WIWg them.

The foregoing Table I gives the means of determining, roughly, the time and height of high water at the several ports named. The hour of transit of the moon preceding the time of high water is to be taken from the Almanac, and, the mean establishment being added, the time of high water results. Thus: Exam]k I.-lt is required to find the time of high water at New York on November 5, 1854. The American .Almanac gives Oh. Om. as the time of transit of the moon on that day. The mean interval for New York, from Table I, column 3, is Sh. 13m., which, as the transit was at Oh., is, roughly, the time of high water. The moon being full, the height is that of spring tides of column 6, viz: 5.4 feet. If the soundings on the chart are reduced to low water spring tides, 5.4 feet are to be added to them to give the depth at high water. If the soundings are reduced to mean low water, the rise and fall of mean tides being 1.1 foot lees than for springs, the rise or increase of depth will be half of this, or 0.6 of a foot lees than 5.4 feet, which is 4. 8 feet, or nearly four feet ten inches. Example II.-Required the time of high water at Boston on January 23, 1851. From the

THE L"NITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

141

American Almanac we find the time of the moon's southing or transit, on that day, 5h. 18m. a. m., and from Table I the mean interval at Boston dry dock is llh. 27m. We have then 5h. 18m. time of transit; To which add 11 27 mean interval from Table I.

16

45

time of high water, or 4h. 45m. p. m.

If the Greenwich Nautical Almanac is used, add 2m. to the time of transit of Greenwich for every hour of west longitude, and its proportional part for less than an hour. It will suffice to take the half hour which may be over any number of hours, as the correction for less than this would be less than one minute, and need not be taken into account. Thus, Boston is 4h. 44m. west of Greenwich. The correction to be applied to the time of transit of the moon is, for the four hours, eight minutes, and for the 44 minutes, one minute. The time of transit on the date assumed in the preceding example is 1711. 9m. of the 22d, or 5h. 9m. a. m. of the 23d, to which add nine minutes; the correction just found gives 5h. 18m., as before ascertained from the American Almanac. In using the United States Nautical Almanac, in the astronomical part of which the transits of the moon are given for the meridian of W asington, the corrections required may, in this first approximation for the Atlantic coast, be neglected. To find the time of the next following low water add from Table I the duration of ebb tide. This gives 4h. 45m. p. m., time of high water. 6 13 duration of ebb tide from Table I. 10 58 p. m. By subtracting the duration of flood tide we obtain the time of the preceding low water, I Oh. 32m. a. m., recollecting that 4Ji. 45m. p. m. is the same as 16h. 45m. reckoned from midnight. The height of this tide, corresponding to the transit of 5h., will bring it nearly to a neap tide, and the rise and fall obtained from column 7, Table I, is 8.5 feet. The next following high water may be had by adding to the time of low water the duration of flood from Table I. Thus: lOh. 58m. p. m., time of low water January 23. 6 13 duration of flood from Table I. Sum 17 11 or 5h. llm. on January 24. On having found the time of high water, the time of the next following high water may be found by adding the duration of :flood and ebb together, and their sum to the time of high water found, thus: 6h. 13m. duration of ebb tide, from Table I. 6 13 duration of flood. Sum 12 26 duration of whole tide. 4 45 p. m., January 23, time of high water. Rum 17 11 or 5h. llm. a. m., 24th January, time of the next succeeding high water. Subtracting the same quantity will give the time of the preceding high water, thus: 4h. 45m. p. m., or 16h. 45m. from midnight, is the time of high water. 12 26 duration of flood and ebb tide. 4 19 a. m. of the 23d for the preceding high water.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The duration of the flood and the ebb being reckoned from the middle of one stand or slack water to the middle of the next, the time of beginning of stand of ebb or flood will be found by subtracting half the duration of stand or slack water given by column 10, Table I, from the time of high or low water, and the time of the end of the stand of ebb or flood by adding the same. A nearer approximation to the times and heights of high water may be obtained by the use of Tables II and III.

In these, tht variations in the interval between the moon's transit and high water are shown for some of the principal ports contained in Table I. These variations of intervals depend upon the age of the moon, and as they go through their values in half a lunar month, are known as the half-monthly inequality of interval. The table extends from the Oh. of transit, midnight of the calendar day, or full of the moon, to 11~ hours. The numbers for change of the moon correspond to tboso of Oh., and for 13 hours (or lh. p. m. of tho calendar day) to 1 hour, and so on up to 23 hours. The ports for which the numbers are given arc designated by the heading of the columns. The mean interval, it will be seen, does not occur at full and change, but nearly two days afterwards, 011 tho .A.tlantic coast. At Key West it occuri:1 more nearly at full and change, and at San Francisco still more nearly. The same remark applies to the heights; spring tides occur about two days after the full and change of the moon, and neaps two days after the first and last quarters. The use of this table of nearer approximation is quite as simplo as that of Table I. Ruk to find the time of high water-Look in the Almanac for the time of moon's transit (or southing) for the date required. In the table corresponding to that time, will be found the number to be added to the time of transit. Exampie III.-Required the time of high water at New York, October 1, 1856. Using the United States Nautical Almanac, we find the time of moon's transit lh. 24m., astronomical reckoning, or lh. 24:m. p. m., calendar time. From Table II, we have, under the heading of New York, for lh. 30m., (the nearest number to the lli. 24m. in the table,) Sh. lOm. Thus, to lh. 24m., time of moon's transit, Add 8 10 interval found from Table III. ---The sum, 9 34 p. m., is the time of high water on the 1st of October, 1856. If the sum of these numbers had exceeded twelve, the tide would have belonged to October 2, and we must have gone back to the transit of the day before, and computed with it, to obtain the tide of October I. R'llk to find tlie hei,ght of high water.-Enter Table III, column 1, with the time of moon's transit. In the column headed with the name of the place, and marked A, will be found the rise and fall correspouding to the time of transit; in column B, the number to be added to

144

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

soundings on the chart, where the soundings are given for mean low water; in column C, the number to be added to charts of which the soundings are given for low water, spring tides. Iu the foregoing example, (III,) the time of transit being betwee~ 1 and 2 hours, we find from Table III, the rise and fall of tides on 1st October, 1856, between 4. 9 and 4. 7; the number to be added to soundings given for mean low water 4. 5 feet, (column B,) and for low water spring tides, (column C,) 4.9. feet. Having found the time of high water, that of low water may be obtained nearly by adding the duration of ebb from column 9, Table I. The time of the next preceding low water may be found by subtracting the duration of flood from column 8, Table I. The time of the next following high water may be found by adding the duration of both flood and ebb; and of the next preceding high water, by subtracting the same duration of the whole tide. Example IV.-To find the next high water following that of Example III. The duration of flood, column 8, Table I, for New York, is 6h. Om.; and of ebb, from column 9, is 6h. 25m.; the sum is 12h. 25m. To 9/t. 34m. p. m., October 1, time of high water found, Add 12 25 duration of flood and ebb. Sum 21 59, or 9h. 59m. a, m. of October 2, the time of the next high water.
TIDES OF THE PACIFIC COAST.

On the Pacific coast there is, as a general rule, one large and one small tide during each day, the height of the two successive high waters occurring one a. m. the other p. m. of the same twenty-four hours, and the intervals from the next preceding transit of the moon are very different. The inequalities depend upon the moon's declination; they disappear near the time of the moon's declination being nothing, and are greatest about the time of its being greatest. The inequalities for low water are not the same as for high, though they disappear and have the greatest value at nearly the same times. In Puget Sound the inequalities for the interval of high water and for the height of low water follow this rule, but those for the interval of low water and height of high water disappear about one day before the moon's declination is greatest, and are greatest about four or five days before the greatest declination. When the moon's declination is north, the highest of the two tides of the twenty-four hours occurs at San Francisco about eleven and a half hours after the moon's southing, (transit;) and when the declination is south, the lowest of the two high tides occurs about that interval. 'l'he lowest of the two low waters of the day is the one which follows next the highest high water. The nature of these tides will probably appear more plainly from the annexed diagrams. In them the height of the tide is set off at the side on a scale of feet, and the hours of the day are at the top. At 12 noon, for example, the tide-gauge marked 6. 7 feet. Joining all the heights observed in the twenty-four hours, we have a curve like that marked in the figure.

declination is south, Table IV is to be used; if north, TalJ!e V. Tables IV to IX, inclusive, have been recomputed, using· more complete data for the inequalities above referred to, and to those for San Franci8cO similar tableR have been added for San Diego, As1oria, and Port Townshend. 'For the other places on tlie Vil estern Coast given in Table I the following rules will give sufficiently clo,:;e approximations. To obtain the times of high or low water for San Pedro, Cuyler' s harbor, and San Luis Ouispo, compute first the time for San Diego, by Table IV, V, or VIII; then add to the Lime thus obtained 30 minutes, to obtain the time for Sau Luis Obispo, and subtract 13 miuutes for Cuyler' s harbor. At San Pedro the time of high or low water is sensibly the same as at San Diego. For Monterey, South Farallon, ~fare island, Beuicia, Ravenswood, and Bodega, compute first the time for San Francisco, then subtract from the time thus obtained 1 h. 44 m. for Monterey, 1. h. 29 m. for the South Farallon, and 49 m. for Bodega, and add 34 m. for Mare island, 1 h. 4 m. for Benicia, and 30 m. for Ravenswood. For Thunderbolt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, compute first the time for .Astoria, then subtract from it 40 m. for Humboldt bay, 1 h. 16 m. for Port Orford, and 9 m. for Neeah harbor. For Steilacoom and Semi-ah-moo bay, compute :first the time for Port Townshend, and add to it 57 m. for Steilacoom, and 1 h. for Semi-ah-moo. 'l'he approximation will be only a rough one for Steilacoom. For the heights, Tables VI, VII, and IX for San Diego, can be used without change for San Pedro, Cuyler's harbor, and San Luis Obispo. These tables for San Francisco are also applioable to Monterey, South Farallon, and Bodega. For Mare island, add 1.2 foot, for Benicia, 0.9 foot, and for Ravenswood, 2. 7 feet to the quantities for San Francisco. For Humboldt bay, Port Orford, and Neeah harbor, the table:i for .Astoria may be used, subtracting 1. 7 foot for Humboldt bay, alld 1.0 foot for Port Orford. For .Keeah harbor, the tables will give approximate re:iults without change. For Semi-ah-moo bay, add one foot to the quantiti1:Js iu the tables for Port Townshend. For Steilacoom, a rough approximation may be obtained by adding 4.6 feet to them.

REPORT OF THE

SUPERlNTENDE~T

OF

If we disregard the daily inequality, the column headed San Pranci8co m Table 11 would give us, as in the examplPs on the Atlantic coa~t, the means of determining the time of high
water. Example V:-Reqnired the time of high water at North Beach, San Francisco, Cal., on the 7th February, 1853. 1st. The time of the moon's transit at Greenwich, from the Nautical Almanac, is llh. 41m.; the longitude of San Francisco Sli. lOm.; requiring a correction of 16m. to the time of transit for San Francisco, which is thus found to be 1 lli. 57m. 2d. The moon's declination i:; south, and at the time of transit about two days after the greatm;t. Ent.ering Table IV we fiud 12h. {or Oh.) of transit, the nearest number to llli. 57 m. which the table gives j and following the line 11orizontally until WR come to two days after the greatest declination we find 13h. 14m. To llh. 57 m., time of tramiit of the moon, February 7, San Francisco, Add 13 14 from column Oh. transit and two days after greatest declination. or lh. llm., February 8, is the time of high >Yater corresponding to 11 Tl1e sum 25 the transit which we took of February 7. If we desire the tide of February 7, we must go back to the moon's transit of the 6th. The example was purposely assumed to show this case: llh. lm., time of transit February 6, 1853, 13 31 number for llh. transit and one day from greatest declination. Sum 24 32 time of high water Oh. 32m. a. m. February 7.

The height ql higl1 water.-The height of high water is obtained in a similar manner by the use of Table VI and Table VII, entering these in the same way with the time of transit and daYS from the greatest declination. Talilc VI is for south declination, and Table VII for
north.

NOTE:.-To use these tables with a cbart on wbicb the

sounding~

are referred to mean low water, substract 1.2 foot from the nlftnberl!! in the tablea

from San Diego

to

Astoria, 1.7 foot for Ne6-a.h harbor, 2.3 for Port Townshend, and 2,7 for Scmiahmoo and Steilacoom .

Examp!.e, VL-In Example V, to obtain the height of tide on February 7, the declination being south, we enter Table VI, for San Francisco, with Oh. of tram;it, and two days after greatest declination, and find that the tide will be 4. 5 feet above the mean of the lowest low water, or that 4.5 feet are to be added to the soundings of a chart reduced to the mean of the lowest low waters of each day. If the soundings of the chart were given for mean low water, then 1. 2 feet ought to be subtracted from the Tables VI and VII; thus, in this example, it would be 3. 3 feet. The approximate time of the successive low and high waters of the day will be found by adding the numbers in Table VIII to the time of the first high water already determined. The table gives the numbers for the different days from the greatest declination.
Tables containing numbers to be added to the time of high water found from Tables IV and V, to obtain the succesb'ive low and high waters.

The days from the greatest declination are written in the first and last columns of the table. The second, third, and fourth columns refer to south declination. and the fifth, sixth, and seventh to north. The second column gives the number which is to be added, according to the declination, to the time of high water, obtained by means of Tables IV and V, to give the next low water, which is the small low water b of Diagram I. The third contains the numbers to be added to the same to give the second· or large high water c of Diagram I. The fourth, the numbers to be added to the same to give the second or large low water d of Diagram I. The succeeding columns give the numbers to be used in the same way for north declination, to obtain the low water b (large) of Diagram II; the high water c (small) and the low water d (small) of the same diagram. The rise anQ- fall of the same successive tides may be obtained by inspection from Table IX, in which the first column at the side contains the time of transit, and the successive columns tbe numbers corresponding to that time and to the number of days from greatest declination. The arrangement of this table is like that already given. The numbers for the small ebb tide ab of Diagram I, or c d of Diagram II, are first given; then those for small low and large high waters b c of Diagram I, and de of Diagram II; next, the large ebb tide c d of Diagram I, or a b of Diagram II; and, lastly, from the large low water to the small high water d e of Diagram I, or b c of Diagram II.

Exampl.e VIL-Thus, in Example VI, the high water of :February 7 was found to be 3.3 feet above mean low water. The declination being south, Diagram I applies, and this high water is the small one. To obtain the fall of the next low water or small low water, we enter Table IX, for San Francisco, with Oh. of moon's transit, and two days after the greatest declination in the first part of the table, and find 1. 9 foot, which will be the difference in height of this high and low water. Entering with the same transit and day in the second part, we find 3. 0 feet, which is the rise of the large high above the small low water; the difference between I. 9 and 3.0 or 1.1 foot is the difference of height of the two successive high waters. It is easy to see how, in this way, the soundings of a chart can be reduced to i.vhat they would be approximately at all the successive high and low waters. A similar set of tables is in preparation for Key West and some of the other ports on the Gulf of Mexico, where the tides are of the same character.

160

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

TIDES 08' THE GULF OF MEXICO.

On the coast of Florida, from Cape Florida, around the Peninsula, to St. Mark's, tho tides are of the ordinary kind, but with a daily inequality which, small at Cape Florida, goes on increasing as we proceed westward to the Tortugas. From the 'l'ortu~as to St. Mark's the daily inequality is large and sensibly the same, giving the tides a great resemblance to those of the Pacific coast, though the rise and fall is much smaller. Between St. Mark's and St. George's island, Apalachicola entrance, tb8 tide8 change to the single day class, ebbing and ·, flowing but once in the twenty-four (lunar) hours. At St. George's i,;land there are two tides a day, for three or four day::;, about the time of the moon's declination being zero. At other times there is but one tide a day, with a long stand at high water of from 6 to 9 hours. From Cape St. Blas to and including the mouth of the Mississippi the single day tides are very regular, and the small and irregular double tides appear only for two or three days, (and frequently even not at all,) about the time of zero declination of the moon. The stand at high and low water is comparatively short, seldom exceeding an hour. To the west of the mouth of the Mississippi the double tides reappear. At Isle Dernicre they are distinct, though a little irregular, for throe or four days, near the time of the moon's zero declination. At all other times the single day type prevails, the double tides modifying it, however, :in the shape of a long stand of from 6 to 10 hours at high water. This stand is shortest at the time of the moon's greatest declination, sometimes being reduced to but one hour. At Calcasieu the tides are distinctly double, but with a large daily inequality. The rise and fall being small, they would often present to the ordinary observer the same appearance as at Isle Derniere. At Galveston the double tides are plainly perceptible, though small, for five or six days at the time of moon's zero declination. At other times they present the single day type, with the peculiarity that, after ~tanding at high water for a short time, the water falls a small distance and stands again at that height for several hours, then continue~ to fall to low water. Sometimes it falls very slowly for nine or ten hours following high water, and then acquires a more rapid rate to low water. At Aransas Pass and Brazos Santiago the single day tides prevail. Small, irregular double tides are only perceived for two or three days at the moon's zero declination. .A.tall other times there is but one high water in the day, with a long stand of from 6 to 9 hours, during which there are often small, irregular fluctua· tions or a very slow faU. In the following table the mean rise and fall of tides at the above stations are given. The highest high and the lowest low waters occur when the greatest declination of the moon happens at full or change; the least tide when the moon's declination is nothing at the first or last quarter. The rise and fall being so small, the times and heights are both much influenced by the winds, and are thus rendered quite irregular.

TO DETERMINE THE RISE .AND FALL OF THE TIDES FOR ANY GIVEN TIME FROM HIGH OR LOW WATER·

It is sometimes desirable to know how far the tide will rise in a given time from low water, or fall in a given time from high water, or to approximate to the time which has elapsed from low or high water, by knowing the rise or fall of the tide in the interval. If the proportion of the rise and fall in a given time were the same in the different ports, this would easily be shown in a single table giving the proportional rise and fall, which, by referring to Table I, showing the rise and fall of the tide at the port, would give the rise and fall in feet and decimals. The proportion, however, is not the same in different ports, nor in the same ports for tides of different heights. The following Table XI shows the relation between the heights above low water for each half hour for New York and Old Point Comfort and for spring and neap tides at each place. Units express tho total rise of high water above low water, and the figures opposite to each half hour denote the proportional fall of the tide from high water onward to low water. For example, at New York, three hours after high water, a spring tide has fallen six-tenths (sixty hundredths) of the whole fall. Suppose the whole rise and fall of that day to be 5.4 feet, (Table I,) then, three hours after high water, the tide will have fallen 3.24 feet, or three feet three inches, nearly. Conversely, if we have observed that a spring tide has fallen three feet three inches, we may know that high water has pas11ed about three hours.

TIDES IN COASTING.

By observing the time of high water and low. water along the coast we find the places at which they are the same. The map of co-tidal lines (Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857,) shows that it is high water nearly at the same hour all along the coast from Sandy Hook to Cape Canaveral; of course, not in the bays and harbors and up the rivers, but on the out~r coast. It is high water exactly at the same hour all along the line marked XII, seen on the chart, near Sandy Hook, and north and south of Hatteras, and, with small interruptions, at Cape Lookout and Cape Fear, all the way to near Cape Cafiaveral. This same line extends eastward to near Block i1:!land, and south of Nantucket~ and then passes away from our coast. .A.t full and change of the moon, along this line, (approximately,) it is high water at XII o'clock, Greenwich time, the local time of high water depending upon the longitude of the place; or, to speak more correctly, in the average of a lunar month it is high water so many hours after the time of the moon's passing the meridian of Greenwich. By these lines, called co-tidal lines, we can determine what tidal currents the navigators must expect to meet in coasting; and for this purpose we divide the ports of the coast into two sets, those south and those north of New York. The sailing lines of coasters bound to southern ports this side of the straits of Florida are marked upon the map, and also of those bound through the sounds to eastern ports, and, outside, to Halifax and European ports.

VESSELS TO AND FROM PORTS SOUTH OF NEW YORK.

South of Sandy Hook, New Jersey, the line of XII hours is nowhere more than 18 miles from the coast; that of XIi nowhere more than 35 miles; that of Xq nowhere more than 48; and XI nowhere more than 110. The distance of these line8 of XII to XI hours, (corresponding within four minutes to VII and VI of New York time,) from different parts of the coast, is shown from Table A, where the first column gives the name of the place, and the second, third, fourth, fifth, respectively, the distances of the co-tidal lines of XII, Xli, XI~, and XI hours. The distances are measured from the ports on perpendiculars to the co-tidal lines. They may be taken as if measured on the parallel of latitude at all the points for the line of XII hours, and at all between Sandy Hook and Cape Hatteras for the lines of XI!- and XI~ hours .

The co-tidal lines are in such directions that at 10, 20, and 30 miles from the coast, between Sandy Hook and the St. John's, there is but a variation of seven minutes, and even to Cape Caliaveral only of eight minutes. Keeping ten miles from the shore, the coaster would pass from XII hours at Sandy Hook to XI hours 45 minutes at Hatt.eras, and increase again irregularly to XII hours 7 minutes at the St. John's, as shown more explicitly in table B. These three tracks of 10, 20, and 30 miles are inside of the cold wall of the Gulf Stream, and generally in the cold current, except at Cape Canaveral.

It follows, then, as a general thing, from these two tables that the coaster, in passing from Sandy Hook to the St. John's would have the tides the same, within some fifteen minutes, as if he remained at Sandy Hook. So that leaving, for example, a high water, he would, according to the elapsed time, have the ebb and flood alternating every six hours and a quarter, nearly, as if he had remained near Sandy Hook. As the flood tide sets in generally to the northward and on shore, and the ebb to the southward and off shore, he would know by the time that elapsed from his departure and the period of the tide at which he started what tidal currents he might expect to meet as be passed along the coast. This, of course, is not peculiar to Sandy Hook as a point of departure, but would be true for any cf the entrances given in the table, taking care not to mistake the time of tides within for that at the entrance. By referring to George W. Blunt, esq., I have obtained the tracks of sailing and steam vessels passing from New York to ports to t.he south of it, as shown by the lines on the chart accom· panying this paper.-(See Sketch No. 65, C. S. Rep., 1857.) Tracing these on the map of co-tidal lines, I have determined how the navigator would find the tides as he passes from port to port. The results are shown in the annexed table, (C,) in which the port between which and Sandy Hook the mariner passes is at the head of the table, and, at the side, the place off which the co-tidal hours will be found, as stated in the table.

Thus, from Sandy Hook to Delaware bay, starting with XII hours 5 minutes, off Barnegat there would be, at the same instant, XI hours 57 minutes, and off Cape May XII hours 10 minutes, so that the navigator would have the same succession of tides, whether he remained at Sandy Hook or passed onward to Delaware bay, or whether he came from Delaware bay to Sandy Hook. So from Sandy Hook to Charleston he will find, at the same instant, XII hours 5 minutes at Sandy Hook, XI hours 57 minutes off Barnegat, XI hours 45 minutes off Cape }fay, a.nd so onward upon the parallels of latitude for the several points. For all practicc.l purposes, then, qf coasting, the succession of the tides, and, qf course, qf the tidal currents qf flood and ebb, wi"U be the same as if the navigator remained stationary. Leaving at low water, he will meet the flood for 6 hours 15 minutes, and then the ebb for another 6 hours 15 minutes, and so on. It is the simplest of all rules that bas thus come out of this investigation. That remarkable change of the temperature between the waters of the inshore cold current, and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, occuring in so short a distance that Lieutenant Bache called jt the ''cold wall,'' takes place at distances off the coast of from 170 to 29 miles, (see Table D,) between Sandy Hook and Cape Canaveral, measured from the several points named in the table, at right angles to the direction of the course, or measured along the para1lels of latitude of the points, at distance from 195 to 28 miles between Assateague and Cape Canaveral.-(Table D.) The points where the parallels north of Assateague meet this division line have not been accurately determined. The annexed table shows these distances, measured at right angles and on the parallels.

The coasting line of thirty miles keeps inside of the cold wall all the way to Canaveral, and all the routes traced on the chart from Sandy Hook to southern ports are on the inside of it. The Gulf Stream lines drawn on the chart show how the route to Bermuda and to the Bahamas cuts the alternate bands of warm and cold water of the Gulf Stream.

Vessels to and from ports eaist ef New York.
The plate shows the sailing lines of vessels bound from New York to eastern ports and to Halifax, outside. The annexed table (E) gives the Greenwich time of high water off the several points named in the first column on the routes to and from the places named in the heading of the table. The distancee are measured at right angles to the co-tidal curves.

In pa::ising from New York to an eastern port, the first great change in the tides and tidal

currents is between the East river and Long Island Sound; the difference between Governor's island and Negro Point, on Ward's island, at the eastern entrance to Hell Gate, is two hours and forty-five minutes. Between this point and Throg' s Point the change is small. The mariner is now in the full tide of the sound, and between Throg's Point and Fisher's island there is a difference of time of but two hours and twenty minutes, the greatest part of which is at the head of the sound and at its entrance-that is, near Throg' s Point and Fisher's island. From off New London to off Sand's Point the difference is but one hour and forty minutes; so that if the mariner, instead of remaining at Throg' s Point, passes onward to Fisher's island, be would lose but half a tide in the whole passage. In other words, he would have the same succession of rise and fall, according to the time elapsed, whether stationary or passing onward within two hours and a half, or less than half a tide. The tidal current lines show that even a le;;s allowance is to be made for the change of current than for the change of tide, the difference in the change of current between Throg's Point and Fisher's island, along the middle of the sound, being of no practical importance. Passing out of Long Island Sound, the tidal hours grow earlier, until off Block island that of Sandy Hook is again reached. The co-tidal line of Sandy Hook and Block island being the same, it is the struggle of the same tide through New York bay and the narrow East river and obstructed Hell Gate, and through Fisher's island and Long I::iland Souud and to Throg' s Point. The tidal currents meet near Throg's Point. The lower part of Narragansett bay has the co·tidal hour XII hours nearly. Buzzard's bay has nearly the same co-tidal hour, the tide wave reaching the shore at nearly the same time all around the bay. It would be impossible to give in a small compass a minute account of the tides of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sound. In geueral it may be said that as far as Holmes' Hole and Wood's Hole they resemble those of Block island sound, and afterwards those of }fonomoy at the eastern entrance i but this generalization is tmsatisfactory without more details than there is space here to give. In these sounds takes place the remarkable change of between three and four hours, the greatest change of our coast, dislocating, as it were, the times of high water at places south and west and east and north of Nantucket. The whole of this change takes plac~ between the eastern entrance of Nantucket sound and the western of Martha's Vineyard, giving rise to quite a complex condition of both tides and currents, which it has occupied much time to unravel. The dominant co-tidal line of our coast, from Block island to Cape Canaveral, is that of XII hours of Greenwich time; that of our eastern coast, from Nantucket to Passamaquoddy, is, in general, XV hours. Passing out of Nantucket sound, coasters carry nearly the same co-tidal hour to Cape Cod, and thence vary their time about half an hour in passing to Boston, to Portsmouth, to Portland, or to Passamaquoddy. It has long been known that the tidal almanac for Boston might practically be used for eastern portR. Vessels from New York to Halifax, and New York to Europe, which keep outside, and should keep well off the Nantucket shoals, and off George's, as shown by the track on the chart, vary their co-tidal hour but little, keeping between the lines of XIl and XIl until quite well on their course, and beyond Cape Sable. The same rule will apply to their case as has been given for vessels between New York and a southern port.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 17.
Report of Capt. "ff~ R. Palmer, [J. S. Topographical Engineers, Assistant Coast Survey in charge ef the qf!ice, and sub-reports cf tlie chiefs cf qffice divisions.
C'oAST SURVEY OFFICE,

October I, 1859.

DEAR Srn: In conformity with the instructions of the Superintendent, I have the honor to submit herewith the usual annual reports of the chiefs of the different divisions of the Coast Survey office. These reports narrate with critical exactness the amount of work executed in

this office since my first report, dated one year ago. It will doubtless be apparent to tbe Superintendent, from a close examination of these reports, that the quantity of work done has been so great that it could only have been accomplished by steady industry and attention to duty on the part of those engaged in it. The character of the work and the execution of the finished maps, in my judgment, merit high praise; yet the loRs of some three or more able assistants during the past year is i;everely

felt by this office; industry, zeal, and intelligence on the part of those who have succeeded to
their duties will soon, I hope, enable them to thoroughly fill the places of their predecessors. Three officers of the army, viz: First Lieut. J.C. Tidball, 2d artillery, First Lieut. R. Saxton, 4th artillery, and First Lieut. J. P. Roy, 2d infantry, have been detached from duty within the past year, and two officers only, viz: Fir&t Lieut. J. R. Smead, 2d artillery, and First Lieut. Thomas Wilson, 5th infantry, have been assigned to duty here. I shall now refer to the different divisions of this office in their order of precedence, commencing with theComputing Division.-This division, the varied labors of which includes all the computatiom and comparisons necessary in the primary, secondary, and tertiary triangulations, the astronomical, chronometric, and magnetic observations, measurements of bases, and, in addition, many incidental calculations, remains under the charge of its experienced chief, Assistant C. A. Schott. One of the computers (Mr. J. Wiessner) resigned on the 1st of .April last, to .ioin one of the western exploring expeditions. The report herewith submitted will furnish the Superintendent with the details of occupation of bis six assistants and himself duriug the past year. Tidal Division.-Tbe tidal division is under the charge of .Assistant L. F. Pourtales, who is assisted by five regular computers, and such "aids" as may be available from time to time in the intervals of their field service; their names and occupation are given in the annexed report of the chief of the division. In addition to the regular duties of this division, in reducing and furnishing to the office the requisite tidal data for our charts, it has other special occupations under the immediate direction of the Superintendent, as will be seen by reference to Appendix

No. 27. Drawing .Division.-This division, First Lieutenant J. C. Tidball, 2d artillery, in charge until
30th of June last, has not only promptly executed the various demands that have been con· stantly made upon it, in the projecting, upon the sheets required by the parties in the field, of the astronomical and trigonometrical points, in the furnishing of many tracings for the different departments and burea~IX. of the l:OVetnment, for office use, for public corporations, and for

THE PNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

many private citizens, (these latter tracings being given only with the sanction of the honorable Secretary of the Treasury,) but has also ·with a reduced force gained a further advance upon the engraving. In the language of First Lieutenant T. Wilson, 5th infantry, who, three months since, succeeded to the charge of this division, '·Confidence is felt in its ability to meet in a prompt and satisfactory manner every demand that can be made upon it." The Superintendent will doubtless concur with me in the expression of regret \Yhich all who have been associated with him feel at the loss to this office of the services of First Lieutenant J. O. Tidball, 2d artillery. He received orders to join his regiment on the 12th of August last, thus dissolving his connection with this work. Lieut. Wilson's report, hereto annexed, and the lists accompanying it, will acquaint the Superintendent with the progreas of the division, and the special occupation of each of the draughtsmen during the past year. Engraving Division.-The division of the Coast Survey office to which I deem it my duty most particularly to invite the attention of the Superintendent at the present time is that of the engraving, which, notwithstanding the increase in force in various grades of engravers a few years since, is hardly at the present time able to keep up with the Drawing Division. A thorough study of the details of this subject will, no doubt, enable us to apply the remedy . .As you have this subject under special consideration, I do not deem it necessary at present to enlarge upon it. The charge of this division for the first half of the year continued with First Lieut. Rufus Saxton, U.S. .A., when his detail by the War Department for duty at the United States Military .Academy, at West Point, deprived this office of his valuable services. During the past six months Mr. Edward Wharton succeeder] to the duties of Lieut. Saxton. His zeal and industry merit my commendation. Electrotype Division.-Under the direction of Mr. George Mathiot, chief electrotypist, assisted by Mr. D. Hinkle, this division has made during the present year eighty-seven copies of engraved plates, eighty-three being for the use of this office and four for other departments of the government, thus preserving unimpaired our original or standard plates, and using, in lieu of them, the electrotypes for printing. I had the honor to state, in my previous report, that increased success had followed the experiments in photography, especially with a view to its u~e in the preparation of the reductions from the original plane-table sheets, and I have now the satisfaction of st.ating that, to a great extent, these reductions have proved successful. I would in;;;tance that of coast chart No. 29, from Green Run inlet to Little Machipongo inlet, Virginia, a proof of which was submitted to the Superintendent on the 28th of July last, after having been engraved from the photographic reduction. I have examined with care the criticisms of both the Drawing and Engraving Divisions upon it; it has been pronounced accurate. The cost of this reduction did not exceed one-fourth the cost of making the same reduction by hand. Two other reductions, viz: San Pablo, California, 8 wt><io· and New York bay and harbor, also sTITo· having been subjected to the closest criticism of experts in both the Drawing and Engraving Division, and proving accurate, are being now engraved as received from the photographer. The report of the chief electrotypist, hereto appended, promises additional results by the use of photography in other branches of the survey.

REPORT OF THE SPPERINTENDEXT OF

Archives and Library.-.!rhe arrangement for the archives continues unchanged. The very limited space remaining for the records of the survey at tho date of the last annual report is being rapidly £lied, and great inconvenience is felt from the want of sufficient room for the proper disposal of those turned in from day to day, from the various field and hydrographic parties. There have been added to the library, during the calendar year 1859, one hundred and sixteen volumes, of which fifty were presented to the survey from home departments and institutions, and from those of foreign governments. Miscellaneous division.-As stated in my last annual report the miscellaneous division, con- ' sisting of the printing and distribution of maps, d1arts, and Coast Survey Reports, had only then been organized less than a year and had improved upon its previous separate working. The experience of the year exhibits a large advancement upon the results then stated, without an increase in the number of its employes. The number of impressions from Coast Survey maps, charts, and sketches printed, amounting to over fifteen thousand, including proofs for distribution, quarterly records, &c., against near twelve thousand of the previous year. With this increase, still, the number of impressions taken is scarcely up to the demand made 11pon the office by our sale agents and for the distribution to libraries and other institutions authorized by the Treasury Department, which amounted in the last year to far more than double the number distributed in the previous year, including seven thousand eight hundred impressions of thirteen charts, sent to the principal departments of the government to foreign institutions, &c., and to certain libraries and other public depositories designated by members of the House of Representatives in their respective districts throughout the entire country. The distribution of the Superintendent's Annual Report for 1857, from the time of its reception from the congre:;sional binderF., was made in less time than in any previous year. The annual report for the past year, it is confidently hoped, will be ready for distribution by the commencement of the corning session of Congress. It will, doubtless, be a source of much regret to those who have heretofore received the results of the operations of the Coast Survey in this form, that the number of extra copies ordered by Congress was reduced to five thousand from the twenty thousand, heretofore distributed by members of Congress direct to their constituents, and from this office to foreign governments and institutiont1, the libraries of our vessels-of-war, of colleges, and scientific irnstitutions, and to iudi \-·iduals interested in science, commerce, and navigation throughout the Union. This division is under the charge of First Lieut. J. R. Smead, U. S. A., wbo, in June last, relieved his predecessor, First Lieut. J. P. Roy, U. S. A., the valuable services of the latter having been called for by the War Department. I would respectfully call the attention of the Superintendent to the details of work as reported by Lieut. Smead, which is hereto submitted. Carpentry.-The carpenters' work necessary for the use and transportation of instruments for the surveying parties has beeu at all times during the year promptly executed. There have been made twelve new stands and thirty-three fine cases for instruments; twenty-six drawing and plane-table boards; seven large cases for books, maps, and copper-plates; five large vats, and eighteen frames for electrotype and photograph purposes; patterns for castings, and one hundred and forty·three packing boxes; the wood-work for two self.registering tide-gauges, and new instruments for magnetic observations; a machine for winding sounding-lines, and a vibrating stand for comparing base rods. .All the instruments sent to and returned from the fi~ld partjes pave been packed and unpacked, and repairs made where neede<;l; fifty tin tubes

THE UNITED STATES COAST St:RVEY.

179

for filing original maps and charts have been painted and numbered, and the requisite repairs and additions made to the Coast Survey buildings. The work of the carpenter's shop is execl).ted by Mr. A. Yeatman, master carpenter, assisted by one carpenter and one apprentice. In.~trurnerlf Shop.-The instruments made during the year are twenty-eight geodetic, three astronomical, sixteen magnetic and telegraphic, twenty-two telegraphic, ten hydrographic, twelve drawing, sixty-two engraving, and nineteen miscellaneous. Repairs have been made upon sixty-seven geodetic, five astronomical, six magnetic and telegraphic, ninety-six topographic, sixty hydrographic, thirty-five drawing and engraving, and three miscellaneous instruments. The force employed consists of Mr . .J. Vierbuchen, master instrument maker, whose services and management a.re Ratisfactor:-·, and five instrument makers. I would express my acknowledgments to Commander S. S. Lee, U. S. N., who has recently been assigned to the charge of the Hydrographic Division of this office; to Prof. W. P. Trowbridge, assistant in the Coast Survey; Samuel Hein, esq., general disbursing agent, and .Joseph Saxton, esq., assistant to the superintendent of weights and measures, for their prompt and cheerful co-operation with, and aid rendered to, the office on all subjects pertaining to their respective duties. First Lieut. A. P. Hill, 1st artillery, U. S. A., still acts as general assistant; his merits are so well known to the Superintendent that it is superfluous for me to enlarge upon them. In concluding this report I would add that the chief clerk in my office, A. W. Russell, esq., performs his duties with characteristic industry and ability. I shall, from a sense of duty, in a separate communication, strongly recommend an increase to the compensation of one or more of the gentlemen comprising the clerical force of this office, in order that they may be placed more nearly upon an equality, as to pay, with those of no higher grade or merit in the other departments and bureaux of the government. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. R. PAL:\IER.

Report qf Assisf,ani Ohar'les A. Schott, in charge qf the Computing Diviswn.
Co.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE, October 1, 1859. In conformity with the regulations of the office, the usual annual report on the occupation of the several computers for the year ending October 1, 1859, is herewith respectfully submitted. During a part of the year the number of computers was less than in the previous year. Mr. J. Wiessner resigned his position in this division on the 1st of April, to join one of the western wagon-road expeditions. The somewhat contracted state of the records i-eceived in the first half of the year permitted to continue the reductions of the current work without filling the place vacated by Mr. Wiessner, although it necessitated an increase of, and close attention to, duty on the part of the computers in general. During the month of July, in accordance with instructions received from the Superintendent,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

I was eng·aged on a m:Jgnetic survey, extending to Sections I and II; these observations were partly reduced by myself~ and fully discussed in regard to the secular change of the magnetic declination, on which subject a report at some length was submitted in answer to a call from the Superintendent. The least square reduction of the primary triangulation between Kent Island and Washington was considerably advanced by me and reported on. The ordinary routine business of the office has all been attended to; it comprises principally the furnishing of geographical positions to topographical and hydrographic parties, and the examinations and reports of all computations, discussions, and revisiom;, either geodetic, astronomical, or magnetic. The general distribution of the reductions has remained the same as in lust year. The following statement eontains in detail the amount of work done by each computer during the year ending October 1. Assi8tant Tl1e0Jore TV. Werner computed the triangulation between St. Helena and Calibogue sound~, Section V; reduced ARsistant Gerdes' triangulation on the Mississippi delta; made out a least square abstract of horizontal angles at station Humpback, Section I; reduced and com· puted rectang-ular co·ordinates of the Charlotte harbor triangulation, Section YI. He also computed the triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia, W ash1ngton Territory; made a second calculation of the astronomical latitude of yard, Section II; reduced the triangulations of Chandeleur sound, Section VIII, and near the mouth of the Potomac, Section III; also the triaugulation connecting St. George's and St. Mark's, Section VII, computing new L. M. Z. for tho whole work; the reduction of the triangulation between Sapelo and St. Simon's, Section V, 1858-' 59, completes the work. 1Wr. Eugene Nulty computed the astronomical latitude of Pensacola and Warrington, Section VII; of Lower Missi~sippi, Section VIII, and the azimuth of Plantation Hill and Warrington, Section VII. and of Humpback, Section I; also, the latitude of Humpback, Rutherford Obser· vatory, N. Y., and of New Orleans. He also made a second reduction of the Seaton latitude, and reduced time and azimuth, and the latitude at station Smithville, N. C. Jfr. James ..1.lfain made t!ie revision of the two independent computations of the following astronomical work: The azimuths at Santa Cruz, Section X; at Allston and New Cut, Section V, and of Plantation hill, Section VII; the latitudes at Allston, Breach inlet, East Base, and Savannah, in Section V; of Pensacola and Warrington, in Section VII; of Thomas' hill, Bangor, and Hump back, in Section 1; of New York city and Washington city. He also revised the mairnetic reductions at Humpback and Mississippi city, computed the magnetic constants for magnet C. 6, and mflde a reduction of my magnetic observations in July last. Dr. Gottlieb Rumpf attended to the revision and insertion of the geographical positions in the registers; made the second least square reduction of the horizontal angles at stations Hill, Cuusteu, a11d SeminaQ', Section III; made a second reduction of the James river triangulation of 1857, revised the reduct.ion of the Mississippi delta. triangulation, reduced the triangulation of Tomales hay and Petaluma creek, Section X, and of Sub-A&sistant Harris' triangulation in the vicinity of New Orleans. He alilo made a least square abstract of the horizontal angles of the primary triangulations in Section Y, and assisted in the reduction of vertical angles for eleva· tions in Section I. He also reduced Assistant Blunt' s work on the Hudson river, completing the triangulation up to Hudson City; assisted me in the discussion of the secular change of the magnetic declination, and in the prcpMation of the lir·t of geographical positions printed m this year's report. J!r. John Weissner computed the triangulation of SheepRcot river, Section I, and assisted rn

the discussion of some magnetic reductions; he also supplied the L. M. Z. to the observers' computation of the Tomales bay triangulation, assisted in the least Rquare reduction of the primary triangulation near Washington, and in the computation of L. M. Z. to the triangulation near New Orleaus. He completed the reduction of vertical angles for heights in the vicinity of the Sheepscot river, 1855-' 57, and reduced vertical angles at stations Saunders, Sebattis, and Ragged, of the primary series. Mr. \Viessner's resignation took effect on the first of April last. Afr. Will-iarn D. Starke assisted in the reduction of horizontal angles at Humpback, Section I; reduced the triangulation on Pensacola bay, 1858, and of Sub-Assistant Bagwell's triangulation south of the Cedar Keys; computed the triangulation of Assistant Bolles', south and west of Cape Fear river bntrance, 1855 to 1858; made himself acquainted ·with the reduction of transit observations, and assisted in the preparation of geographical positions for the present report. He also reduced the horizontal angles at Smithville, N. 0., in connection with the astronomical azimuth; assii;ted Mr. Rumpf in the L. M. Z. computations on Hudson river triangulation, and also assisted in the preparation of the statistical table for this year. il'Ir. John T. Hoover attended to the clerical duties of the d:vision, and principally assisted in the preparation of the geographical positions for the 1859 report, duplicating and revising the same. He also made a number of diagrams. R. Freeman supplied the extra copying required for field or office.

Report ef .Assistant L. F. Pourtaks, in charge of Tidal DivUi·ion.
November 1, 1859. The following report. on the occupation of the computers in this division during the past year
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

is respectfully submitted: Mr. R. S. Avery has finished the discussion of the nine years' series of tidal observations at Boston, and has made comparisons of twelve years' observations with the predictions made by means of the coefficients obtained. He has also prepared ephemerides for future years. Mr. S. Walker has examined and registered the observations received from the tidal stations, and has had charge of the correspondence with the observers. He has also read off the sheets of the self-registering tide-gauges, and supervised the gauge established at the navy yard in this city, besides making miscellaneous computations. Mr. John Downes has made graphical decompositions of the tidal curves of the Florida stations, and reductions and comparisons of the results obtained. Sub-Assistant 0. Fendall was attached temporarily to this division from April 11 to June 16, and made decompositions of the tidal curves from the Florida reef, and worked out the diurnal inequality for some of the same. Mr. J. Gilliss wa;;i engaged from November 26 to January 17 in making ordinary reductions, working out daily inequalities, drawing diagrams, and miscellaneous work. Mr. R. E. Evans joined the division May 25, and has since been engaged on ordinary reductions, diagrams, and decompositions of tidal curves. Messrs. J. Donega,n, 0. Henrich, and T. 0. Bowie were engaged for short periods, in the inter· vals of their field duties, in miscellaneous work, chiefly ordinary reductio1Js of tides.

182

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Mr. A. W. King made, during part of the year, ordinary :first and second reductions by contract. The meteorological observations of the Pacific coast have continued to be discuAsed by M. Thomas, who has also done miscellaneous work and copying. Most of the reductions of the observations of the permanent stations were made by S. D. Pendleton.

Report of Lieut. Thomas Wilson, U. S. A., assistant in charge qf the Drawing Division.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Novembe,r 1, J 859.

Pursuant to instructions, the following report is respectfully submitted of the operations of the drawing division of the United States Coast Survey office during the past official year, under the supervision of my able predecessor, Lieut. J. C. Tidball, U. S. A., until the 30th of June last, and since then in the charge of the undersigned. During this time I have bad the benefit of the assistance of Mr. G . .A.. Porterfield, whose experience in the office of several yean! has been successfully given to further the best interests of the di\'-ision. It is a material and gratifying fact that the division has been equal to the demands upon it by the extensive operations of the field and afloat, and the work is marked with great accuracy and superior professional ability and elegance.

Below are presented the details of the duties and labors of the several draughtsmen employed. This outline of the past year's labors of this division furnishes some idea of its ability for promptly realizing in form and presenting in tangible shape the topographical and hydrographical results of the active service in the field and afloat. As an incident to the draughting duties proper, yet of no ordinary importance, is the exact and methodical arraugement of the returns of the field service and other archives on which our maps and charts are founded. This arrangement is kept up wich punctilious attention, and in such a manner that now and hereafter the maps and charts produced can be brought to the immediate test as to accuracy of the original data upon which they are founded, or renewed in the future, should every vestige of our present labors disappear by time or circumstance. It is proper also to report that not only have we kept pace with the field service, furnished projections to field parties, made projections on copper, and attended to these and other miscellaneous dutieoi, legitimate but incidental, yet also are we still in advance of the engraving division, as, indeed, our system requires; so that not a moment is lost, nor the least delay possible, in its receiving from our hands a constant and abundant supply of material. For tho purpose of presenting this fact more practically to the Superintendent, the paper marked A has been prepared, that he may see at a glance how the work on the projects in the drawing division stands with regard to its engraving. It is a gratifying fact, too, that in co-operating with the purposes of a just and prudential economy of the Supexintendent, we have been able to realize his wishes in a reduction of three during the past year; and with our present reduced force, looking to its efficacy, zeal, and

Mr. Edward Whart011, acting in charge

of Engraving Division.
October 31, 1859 .

Co.AST SURVEY OFFICE,

I have the honor to present the annual report of the operations of this division during the year ending October 31, 1859. The division remained under the charge of Lieut. Rufus Saxton, U. S. A., from the date of the last annual report until .April 1, wl1en he was relieved from duty. Since that time the division has been under my charge. The engraving force at present consists of twenty-one ' engravers, of various grades. The division has met with a serious loss in the death of one of its oldest and most skilled engravers, Mr. F. Dankworth. who had been attached to the offic<i since 1843, and whose death occurred last March. :Mr. Daukworth ranked among the first topographical engravers in this country, and it gives me pleasure to testify to the faithfulness with which he discharged his duties, and the ability and skill be evinced in the execution of his work. His place will be difficult to supply. The engraving of the finished maps of Patapsco river, Md.; entrance to Pensacola bay, Fla.; San Diego bay, Cal.; Mare Island straits, Cal.; and San Francisco bay, Cal., have been completed; and the two plates of the middle and eastern part of Long Island sound, commenced some years ago, have been also completed, to take the place of the two already published. Various changes and additions have also been made to the charts of Boston harbor and Charles· ton harbor. The second class maps and sketches of .A.tchafalaya bay, La.; entrance to Brazos river, Texas; Humboldt bay, Cal.; Port Gamble, Port Townshend, and Semi-ah-moo bay, Washington 1'errito:ry, have also been engraved, and a new edition of Canal de Haro and Strait of Rosario.

Report ql Mr. George Mathiot, in charge qf the Electrotype, Divisi'.on.

U. S. Co.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE, Septemher 17, 1859. I respectfully present the following report of the operations of this division since October 1,
1858.

By the electrotype process we have made eighty-seven plates, of this number llfty were in basso, and thirty-three in alto. I append tables of the plates. We have also made /our plates for other departments of the government. During the year the experiments for employing photography in the production of the charts of the survey have been zealously prosecuted, and I am now enabled to decisively say that the photographic method of reduction, is now in successful operation in the office, and I doubt not that before long it will prove far preferable to all other methods for delineation and accuracy, and has incomparably the advantage in economy and rapidity of execution. I have sought to make use of the photograph in the <Xmlltruction of our charts. I emphasize ixYMtructUm. in order that I may direct attention to the true object of my labors. That facility, which the photograph offers for copying, and its almost universal employment for this purpose,

200

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

causes the idea to be very generally entertained that we are endeavoring to multiply copies of our charts by photography. Snch, however, would be to employ photography for the multiplication or publication of the charts, instead of their con.struction. But, the latter being the true purpose, and the construction of the chart being an operation founded on the methods and purposes of every department of the surve.Y, it will be seen that tile _proposition to employ photography in making the charts involves no trifling considerations, and prospectively may affect every branch of the survey. That facility which the camera offers for producing reduced copies of drawings is the· element which I have sought to introduce; of the many ways in which this might be done, the following is the method which has been chosen, after the experience of the multitude of experi· ments I have made for the purpose during the last five years. It ·must be borne in mind that a small scale chart is not merely a diminished picture of a .chart comitructed on a large scale; that the same things are rrot found i'n both charts; that the same things are represented differently on the different scales, and that numerous large scale charts combine in the composition of the small scales; and, lastly, that the configurations in the large charts not only change their size, but alter also their shape in entering the reduced charts, aml this according to the part the object occupies in the reduced scale. The elements of the charts are hydrographic and topographic sheets, constructed on shipboard by the bydrographer, and on the plane-table in the field by the engineer; these sheets become distorted by the hygromet:ric action of the paper, and hence are not true maps, and require the hand of man for their rectification; but as the error is only that of a variety of scales on the same sheet, the rectification does not affect the value of the sheet for its data, and can always be made in its reduction to the smaller scales. This is effected in the photographic method which has been adopted, in the following manner: On a piece of transparent vellum the latitude and longitude lines of the sheet are laid down anew on the same scale as the sheet, but in a form corresponding to that which the area will form in the reduction; on this projection the squareB of the minuteB of latitude and longitude will not perceptilily differ from the squares on the Bheets; the plan iB, then, simply to lay the transparent vellum on the sheet, so as to make the minute lines for a square on the vellum coincide with those on the sheet; then with a pen trace the geographfoal delineations on the sheet upon the vellum, and omitting all such parts as are not desired to appear on the reduced chart; in this way the sheet is copied square by square, and all errors of shrinkage rectified, a selection of the desired parts made, and prominent objects made to ret11.in their conspicuousness in the reduction, by increasing their size. In this operation both the judgment of the topographer and the skill of the draughtsman are required, and here is also a great occasion opened for gaining knowledge by experience. What objects to trace and what to omit, and how to trace them, are matters not easily determined; experience, judgment, deliberation, and consultation of the most able topographers and engineers of the survey will be required to decide this. The work being transferred from the sheet to the vellum, the next operation is to produce the reduced photographic copy; for this purpose it is put up against a white board, and the camera placed at such distance as will insure the required reduction j a · 'collodion negative'' is then made of it, and from this "negative" a paper photograph is produced, which is a reduced copy of the tracing. The photograph is then placed in the hands of the engraver, who transfers it to the copper plate; sheet after sheet being thus reduced and transferred to

the copper by their latitude and longitude lines, the :finished chart at length appears in the print from the engraved plate. Although the method here described is now in successful practice, there still remains an enormous mass of matter, relative to the conventionalities of the charts and their different scales, yet to be decided, and it is easy to fore.;,ee that even years will not suffice to wholly determine these points. By the method I have described, I have, during the past year, constructed four charts of the survey, as follows: Sau Pablo bay, which I announced in my last annual report as having been successfully reduced from 60 ~ 00 to aTl>TI, has been twice constructed on so-lroo scale from the original sheets of the survey; the selections, however, in the first tracings, not being deemed acceptable after examining the appearance of the reduction, the sheets were again traced, and a second reduction made; this last reduction I have learned from the office is entirely satisfactory, and will be engraved. No. 29 of the eastern series of 80 }.0 charts has been constructed and engraved as far as the survey has been completed. New York bay and harbor, 811 !- 00 , has also been photographically reduced as far as the original sheets have been verified by the resurvey; the work, as far as done, is, however, already in the hands of the engraver. I have given but a mere synopsis of the photographic method of constructing the reduced charts. A detailed description would be too voluminous to be given here, and, moreover, the various operations now employed may be superseded ·by others as experience is gained. I would be pleased, however, to prepare a full account of the photographic method of reducing for publication; and this should at some time be done, as many of the processes are original, and have been acquired by the expenditure of time and money. I have also, as time would permit during the year, conducted other photographic experi· ments for the purpose of employing photography in other departments of the survey. Partial success has attended some of the experiments, particularly those I have made in conjunct.ion with Mr. L. F. Pourtales, in charge of the tidal division, for photographing the minute shells found in the specimens of bottoms. In this labor I believe we have trodden an unexplored field, for, so far as I am informed, success bas not elswhere attended the efforts to produce enlarged photographs of opaque microscopic objects; but there is still room for improvement in our efforts here. Though we have successfully introduced the work of photographing the soundings, other and no small part of my labors have been wholly fruitless thus far, yet p0rsevering industry will ultimately succeed. During the past year I have been assisted by Mr. D. Hinkle. He has applied himself both in the electrotype and photographic operations. I desire to commend him to the office for his assiduity in the work.

COAST SCRVEY OFFICE,

TVashington, 2'lovember 1, 1859. The miscellaneous division, comisting of the printing ofiit:e, the map room, and office for distribution of the maps and charts, and of the Coast Survey Report, was placed under my charge in the latter part of June of this year. Lieut . .James P. Roy, U. S. A., was in charge from the date of the last annual report up Lo the time of my being ordered to the survey. The records of the division are kept by Mr. V. E. King, who also has charge of the map room, and distribution of maps, charts, sketches, and Coast Survey Reports, aRsisted by Mr. F. Holden up to September 1, subt:equently by Mr. W. Mertz, the former having resigned his position on that date. Since then I have learned with regret of the sudden death of Mr. Holden from paralysis. In addition to these dutief', Mr. King assists in the clerical duties in the office of the assistant in charge. In the miscellaneous division his services are invaluable, from his intimate acquaintance with the details of duty, bis constant attendance, aurl the celerity with which he accomplishes his work. Mr. W. Mertz, successor to Mr. Holden, in addition to his duties in the map room, backs and stretches paper, and backs and repairs plane· table and other sheet:'>, for use in the drawing di vision of the office. He has only been employed since September 1, but so far gives entire satisfaction. In the printing office, Mr. Rutherdale, as printer, with his assistant, Mr. J. Barrett, have been industrious, and very constant in their attendance. I have caused to be prepared, and herewith respectfulJy transmit, a statement of Coast Survey maps, charts, and sketches distributed during the year: of these 600 copies of each of thirteen different maps or charts, viz: Annisquam and Ipswich harbors, Massachusetts. Boston harbor, Massachusetts. Plymouth harbor, Ma&sachusetts. Provincetown harbor, Massachusetts. Long Island sound-eastern sheet. Long Island sound-middle sheet. Long Island sound-western sheet.. Eastern part of southern coast of Long faland. Middle part of southern coast of Long fafand. Western part of southern coast of Long Island. York River entra11ce, Virginia. Beaufort harbor, North Carolina. Cape Fear River entrances, Korth Carolina, have been presented. "in conformity with an act of C~mgress and by direction oi the Treasury Department,'' to different ins ti tu tions, societies, individuals, &c., both in this country and abroad. I also transmit a statement of the distribution of Coast Survey Reports, and of thl:l maps, !'harts, sket9hes, and. miscellane~?s matter.· prii;t~d siuco the q.ate of tlie last. annua.l report.

List o/ geographical. p<>sitions <letermined by the Uniwd State,s Ooast Survey, and continued from reports of 1851, 1853, 1855, and 1857.
'l'he present list is a continuation of that published in the annual reports for 1851, 1853, 1855, and 185'1, and contains the geographical positions of points determined astronomically and trigonometrically, since the date of the former reports, with the repetition of a few points previously published for convenience of reference. The following explanations will give all the information required for the use of the tables. For the purposes of the survey, the coast is divided into eleven sections, in all of which the work is carried on simultaneously. The survey being in different stages of progress in the several sections, and new results being added from year to year to those here given, the same divisions have been adopted in the publication. The several sections are defined as followi,; : SECTION I. From Passamaquoddy bay to Point Judith. SECTION II. From Point Judiih to Cape Henlopen.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

SECTION III. From Cape Henlopen to Cape Henry. SECTION IV. From Cape Henry to Cape Fear. SECTION V. From Cape Fear to St. Mary's river. SECTION VI. From St. Mary's river to St. Joseph's bay. SECTION VII. From St. Joseph's bay to Mobile bay. SECTION VIII. From Mobile bay to Vermilion bay. SECTION rx. From vermilion bay to the Rio Grande. SECTION X. Coast of California, San Diego bay, to 42d parallel. SECTION XI. Coast of Oregon and Washington Territory, 42d to 49th parallel. The tables give the latitudes and longitudes of the trigonometrical points in each section, and their relative azimuths or bearings and distances. The manner in which these data have been obtained may be briefly explained here. In each section a base line of from five to ten miles is measured with all possible accuracy. A. series of triangles, deriving the length of their sides from this base, is then established along the coast by the measurement of the angles between the intervisible stations. In this primary series the triangles are made as large as the nature of the country will permit, because the liability to error increases with the number of triangles. On the bases furnished by the sides of the primary triangles a secondary triangu1ation is next established, extending along the coast, and over the smaller bays and 8ounds, and deter· mining a large number of points at distances a few miles apart for the use of the topographical and hydrographical surveys. The distances between the poiuts thus determined, as given in the tables, are liable to an average error of about one foot in six miles, until a final adjustment between the base lines shall have been made. In some parts of the survey the base lines for the primary triangulations have not yet been measured, or the connection between the secondary and primary triangulation has not yet been made, in which cases the distances depend on preliminary base lines, measured with great care, and they are liable to an average error of one foot in three miles. This applies to the positions from the Savannah river to Sapelo sound in Section V, to a part of those in Section VI, and to the positions in Sections VII and IX, to a part of those in Section X, and to Section XL .A.s on the completion of the primary or main triangulation in each section the several series form one connected chain, the different bases afford verifications of each other, and of the triangulation connecting them. The first four sections are thus connected, the last section and part of the fifth, however, only in a preliminary way. Observations for latitude and azimuth are made at a number of stations of the primary trian· gnlation in ooch section. The differences of latitude, longitude, and azimuth between these and other stations are then computed, under the supposition that the earth is a spheroid of revolution of the following dimensions, which are those determined by Bessel, from the reliable measurements made at the time, viz : Equatorial radius= 6377397.16 metres. Polar radius .= 6356078. 96 metres. Eccentricity= 0.08169683. It has been found that the differences of latitude and longitude, as computed in this manner from the di*nce and azimuth between two stations, and which an' (':alle<l g-eo<letk differ from

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

those obtained by astronomical observations at the several stations by quantities whic11 are greater than the errors of the observations. Such disagreements are due to local irregularities in the figure and density of the earth, and the error resulting from them in the determinations of latitude and of the meridian plane is designated as station error. It amounts, according to the result~ obtained at present, to betweeu one and four seconds of arc in the eastern section of the survey, and to about one second and a half in the sections south of the Delaware. Ia order to eliminate the influence of 8tation errors on the general result observations are made at a number of stations; the results are referred to a central station by means of the ·, geodetic differences, and the mean of all is used for the computation of the positions given in the tables. The geographical positions must therefore be considered as liable io future changeR from the accumulation of uew observatioris, and from the final discussion of all the results obtained. The dijferencts qf longitude are obtained, as has been stated, by computation from the distances, latitudes, and azimuths of the triangulation. In adding up the differences from station to station an accumulation of the incidental errors is probable. They are checked, however, by differences of longitude determined by means of the electro-magnetic telegraph in every section where the introduction of the latter makes it practicable. Seaton station, in Washington city, has been selected as the centre for the telegraphic differences of longitude. The sections at present connected by telegraph are Sections I, II, III, IV, V, and VIII. The first three being also connected by primary triangulation, the check on the geodetic differences of longitude is here obtained, and the agreement is very close. 1'he longitudes from Greenwich in the first :five sections depend directly, and in other sections indirectly, upon that of Cambridge observatory, as determined by chronometric differences between Liverpool and Cambridge, and by occultations, eclipses, and moon culminations, observed at various observatories in the United States, and referred to Cambridge by means of telegraphic differences. The following statement shows the result up to the present time.

Explanation qf the ialile.s.
The first :::olumn on the left contains the name of the several stations or triangulation points. Their general locality is indicated by the heading at the top of the page, by means of which they may be readily found on the sketches accompanying the tables. Sub-headings in the first column indicate the locality more minutely where it is practicable. The stations are generally either prominent objects of permanence, such as Epires, light-houses, beacons, &c., or they are points on prominent hills, capes, and points of land where signals have been erected for the purpoEes of the survey, and which are marked on the ground. In a small number of cases in the first three sections, but much more frequently in the southern sections, where settlements on the coast are sparse and few permanent objects are to be found, the stations have no other distinguisl1ing mark than the signal erected on the spot, and, after. its decay, the mark left in the ground, to designate the station point. The latter generally consists of p_osts or stones set around the point, while the centre of the station is designated by an earthen cone or glass bottle buried under the surface of the ground, and marked on the top by a stone or post. Where the station is on a rock, a copper bolt or a hole filled with lead or sulphur will be found to designate the exact spot. The sketches showing the configurati.on of the land, as well as the relative positions of the stations, no great difficulty will be experienced in finding the latter, when desired for local surveys or reference. In any case where minute descriptions of particular points are required they can be had by application addressed to ihe Coast Survey Office. The second and third columns contain the latitudes and longitudeR of the stations named. The fourth column contains the azimuth of the line joining the station named in the first column with that named in the fifth; that is to say, the angle which that Jine makes with the meridian of the former station, reckoned from south around by west tl1rongb the whole circle. The sixth column gives the back azimuth of the same line, or the angle which it make::1 with the meridian of the latter station, reckoned as before; the difference between the azimuths in

220

the fourth and those in the sixth columns being 180° less the inclination of the meridians at the two stations. The seventh, eighth, and ninth columns give the distances, in metres, yards, and miles, between the stations named in the first and fifth columns. The relation of the metre to the yard, used in obtaining these results, is:

I metre= 1.0935696 yard, or 39.368605 United States standard inches.
For ea.ch station the azimuths and distances to two other stations are given. ln every case , the lines so given have actually been observed. In each section the stations of the primary triangulation a.re distinguished by being printed in small capitals.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 21.
Rqxirt of Prof. 0. JJl. JJfilchel, director, on the moon milminations observed for the U. 8. Ooasi Survey at Cincinnati observatory.
CINCINNATI,
DE.AR

Ohio, Septem'be.r 24, 1859.

Sm: I have to report the observation of forty-nine moon culminations made during the

past twelve months. The· mode of observation and record remains the same as in the past years, the only change being the introduction of a new system of wires into the transit instrument on the 5th of July last. The number of wires is the same as before used, (fifteen,) but they are grouped differ· cnt]y, being now in five groups of three wires each. The equatorial distance between groups is about eight seconds of time, and the interval between the wires of each group is four seconds equatorial. The reduction from mean to middle wire has been obtained from a discussion of fifty-nine obt:ervations of stars within twenty degrees of the eqm;.tor. The observations were made and reduced by my assistant, Henry Twitchell, esq., who has
charge of the transit.

Yours, respectfully,

0. M. MITCHEL.

INTRODUCTION.

Ju co-operation with the scheme adopted at the British colonial observatories, a series of magnetic and meteorological observations were made at the Girard College mai"netic observatory, in Philadelphia, wit11 instruments purc_hased under the direction of the trustees of the college, the observatlons being made under the patronage of the American Philosophical Society, and finally completed for the use of the Topographical Bureau of the War Department. 1 These observations were made under my immediate direction, and were afterwards left under my general superinter.dence. The series commenced in May, 1840, and, 'vith short interrnp· tions, terminated in June, 1845, thu~ furnishing a five years' series of magnetic observations, taken bi-hourly up to October, 1843, and after that date hourly. The readings of each magnetic

element were united into mean values, arranged according to hours of the day and days of the month and annual values, and presented graphically, under my direction, by Joseph .S Ruth, esq., who had taken part in the observations, and who was at that time employed in the Coast Survey. As, owing tu other laborious duties, the record could not tllen be submitted to a complete reduction and discussion, I have resumed the subject, with the aid of Charles .A. Schott, esq., assistant in the Coast Survey, by whom, under my immediate direction, the dis· cussions contained in this paper have been made and prepared for publication. It is proper to state that this work has been performed out of office hours by Mr. Schott, as my assistant in this special matter, and at my own expense. Although the magnetic observations furnished by their judicious geographical location, a basis for the generalization of their results, it is, nevertheless, desirable to combine other results with them as confirmations or as corrections. In the investigation of the disturbance law at Point Barrow, as compared with the same at Toronto, a very remarkable mutual relation was developed, and further examination may bring to light other dependencies of a mutual character. According to the latest determination, the position of the Girard College observatory is in latitude 39° 581 23", (north,) and in longitude 75° 101 05"=5h. OOm. 40s. 3 west of Greenwich.1 From Philadelphia, Tomnto bears 38° 45' west of north, (true,) and is distant 40° 50' in arc, or about 334 statute miles. It is proposed, in the present paper, to investigate the law of the eleven-year period, or, as it is more frequently called, the decennial period, there being yet an uncertainty as to its precise length. It is supposed to have some direct or indirect connection with the solar spot period, which, according to late investigations by Prof. R. Wolf, 2 is said to exhibit corresponding disturbances. The diiscussion is a contribution towards the determination of the epoch of the occurrence of a minimum (as to number and magnitude) in certain phases of the magnetic variations and disturbances, corresponding to a minimum in the solar spot period. The method of reduction is substantially the same as that adopted by General Sabine, and explained in his discussion of the Toronto and Hobarton3 observations.

Investigation of tlte eleven year period in the change of the ampl,itude o/ the sdar-diurnal variation of tli.e magnetic declination, compi·ising the regular as well as tlte disturbed diurnal variation.

While the magnitude of the deflection is the only criterion for the recognition of a disturbance, the adoption of any limit of deviation from the n()rmal value for the same hour, month, and year, must necessarily remain in some measure arbitrary, or, in other words, there must always remain, after the separation of the disturbances, a certain small amount of their effect in the remaining regular diurnal progression. General Sabine has shown that the results are

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

not sensibly affected by a small variation in the line of separation of the disturbed from the undisturbed readings.1 To effect the Reparation, I made uRe of Peirce's criterion' for the rejection of doubtful observations, applying it, however, to observations following a law different from the regular one. a From an examination of 465 hourly observations, distributed over different hours of the day and different months of the year, the following was the limit of separation: 9d.3 from six months in 1840; 8.1 from six months- in 1843; 6.0 from six months in 1845. The mean of 7.8 divisions, equal to 31.6 of arc, has been adopted provisionally. Accordingly, all numbers in the printed record of obtiervations, differing 7.8 scale divisions (or 10.3 divisions for June, and up to July 18, 1840,) for the mean monthly value of each hour of observa· tion, were marked in pencil. It was found that the :ratio of the disturbed observations to the total number was l: 9.6, or for th~ years 1843, 1844, 1845, 1: 13.3 nearly, (the yean 1843 and 1845 being incomplete, and omissions only approximately allowed for.) For comparison with the Toronto observations we have the ratio 1: 9.4 for the series 1841 to 1848 inclusive,· and 1: 13. 6 for the series 1843, 1844, 1845, 5 both for the limit 3'.6, which was afterwards raised to 5'.06 · It was thought desirable iu comparing these results, and especially as the Girard College observations do not extend either way to years of maximum of disturbance, which would other· wise require the enlargement of the limit to preserve the limit as pointed out by the criterion; hence a deviation from the normal of 8.0 scale divisions as a convenient number, 8'.64 of arc, has been adopted for the present discussion as constituting a disturbed observation. Previous to July 18, 1840, the declinometer had a different scale, one division being 20".7, making the corresponding limit for the first month and a half 10. 6 divisions. All observations, therefore, differing 8.0 scale divisions from the mean monthly value of their respective hour were marked by a pencil line; a new hourly mean was taken, omitting values so marked, and each observation was again examined with reference to its deviation from this new mean. The process was repeated, when necessary, so that in all cases values differing sa. O or more from the final mean were excluded. The last mean thus obtained for each observ· ing hour and each month has been called '' the normal 11 The following tables of normals present the mean monthly declinometer readings for each observing hour, free from all disturbances, deviating either way 3'. 64 or more from the normal position of the. magnet for the respective hour, month, and year. The observations having been made at the even Gottingen hours, the local times are 19& minutes after the even hour. 7 The time given in the tables is mean local time, counting from midnight, or Oh. up to 24h. Increase in the scale readings corresponds to a decrease of westerly declination. The value of one division of the scale is 0'.453.

The mean readings, thus corrected, of the tirat 18 days of J11ly, were then properly combinc1I with the mean of the remaining day:> of the month. f In the month of September, hour8, the comparhmns were made with the half-monthly means, owing to the tapid dn.nge of the readings. t On U1e 23d. of Novemb~r the index of the de-clinometer bar Bhifled lY.5 ~cale divisions.

REPORT OF THE

SPPERINTENDE~T

OF

In general during the year 1841, the readings are more changeable than during the follow-

ing years. The re-arrangement of the instruments, and consequent shifting of the index of the scale, allmled to in tlrn preceding notes, interrupted the observations between .January 1 and January 12. The normal for October, 14li, was obtained by comparing with the half monthly means aml taking the mean of the two results as in a similar case for tho month of September of the previous

year.

The hourly readings commence on October 1, and are continued to the close of the series. To make the readings of the odd hours of the months of October, November, and December comparable with those of the even hours during the whole year, the means of the even hours for the months of October, November, aud December (1843) were compared with the corrected annual means respectively, which gave the corrections for the even l10urs; and the corrections for intermediate odd hours were obtained from those of the nearest even lwurs. The deductions from the series of observations at odd hours have but one-third of the weight of those obtained from the even series.

Owing probably to the several accidental changes in the suspen,;ion of the bar, and consequent uncertainty in the precise amount of scale correction, the mean readings of each year, when compared with one another, exhibit differences not actually due to inequalities occasioned by declination changes. This question, however, does not directly bear upon the present investigation, which mainly depends on differences of readings; and it i;:; proper to remark that the observed increase, giving the weight one-half to tlie mean of 184() and of 1845, is under the supposition of a uuiform annual change between these yeurs equal to 4'. 50. From Mr. Schott' s investigation* of the secular change of the declination at Philadelphia, supported by observations between the years 1701 and 1855, the annual increase between the years 1840 and 1845 is 4'.98, a result which accords tolerably well with actual observations. According to his formula, the declination on the first of .January, 1843, the mean epoch of the present Eeries was 3° 32' west, with a probable error of ± 10', which corre<lponds to the scale reading 560.31, deduced by taking into account the weights of the ammal means. We now proceed to the investigation of the inequality int.he diurnal variatiou, chauging the preceding formula, for greater convenience, into the following:

To show the agreement between these expressions aud the corresponding observed quantities, and to exhibit to the eye the character of the diurnal variation, the results have been thrown into curves. The observed bi-hourly means are represented in diagram 2, Sketch 37, by dots, and in no instance do they differ from the computed values by as much as 0°. 8 or 0'.3.

By means of the preceding formulrn the following values were computed: 1. The time when
the north end of the magnet reached its extreme eastern position, or, in other words, the epoch of the eastern elongation. 2. The corresponding maximum scale reading, or, more properly, the corresponding minimum of western declination. 3. The time of the occurrence of the western elongation; and, 4. The corresponding maximum reading of western declination. In the last two columns the difference of the scale readings, or the amplitude of eastern and western elongation, i;; made out in Reale divisions, and also in minutes of arc. The inequality of this amplitude next requires our attention.

The inequality constituting the ten or eleven year period is plainly exhibited in the last two columns of the above table, the progression in the numbers being quite regular. The year 1843 is clearly indicated as the year of the minimum range of the diurnal fluctuation, but whether the period is one nearer to ten or to eleven years cannot he decided from the Girard College observations, since they do not embrace a year of maximum amplitude. The epoch of the minimum, however, can be determined with more precision. For this purpose only, the values in the last column are rcprc!>ented by the formula,

That portion of the ten or eleven year period which results from the preceding discussion of the differential observations of the magnetic declination, free fJ om the effect of the disturbances, as far as the latter can be eliminated, is shown grapl1ically in diagram 1, Sketch No. 37. The month of May, in the year 1843, is indicated by the formula aR the epoch of the minimum amplitude. We nuw proceed to the discussion of the disturbances as far as they bear on the decennial inequality, taking in also some collateral results. The total number of observations for changes of declination recorded and discussed amounts to 24,566; of these, 2,357 were separated as disturbances differing eight scale divi8ions or more from their respective normals, leaving 22, 209 observatlons, from which the preceding results were deduced. There is one disturbed observation in every 10.4 observations. The discussion of the disturbances divides itself into two parts, that of the number and that of the amount of the larger deflections. Owing to partial incompleteness in the number of observing months in some years, it became necessary to fill out the number for the annual inequality from the results of the complete years. Their number for each month in the complete years is given in the following table, the numbers for 1844 having first been divided by two, in order to make the hourly observations comparable with the bi-hourly in the years 1841 and 1842:

The _ratios in the la.st column sho'.V the annual inequality in the distribution of the disturbances. The principal maximum occurs in October,* the secondary in April; the two minima, nearly of equal amount, occur in the months of February and June. The progression of the numbers is regular. If we separate the numbers in accordance with westerly and easterly deflections we obtain the following table, deduced as in the former case. It may be remarked that on account of the separate ratios used for the interpolation of the westE>rn and eastern deflections, their sum in any one month does not give the corresponding number in the above table exactly, only the yearly sums having been preserved; and the same is true in regard to the table, showing the amount of the disturbances. Interpolated values, as before, are enclosed between brackets.

At Toronto this maximum occurred in September; the first minimum is likewise one month earlier at thla station than

at Philadelphia.

The ratios show a general correspondence in the number of westerly and easterly deflections; the westerly deflections seem to occur most frequently in .August, while the easterly predominate in October; the secondary maximum of either series is in April. The minima remain nearly as before, one minimum of eastern deflection occurring in January. With respect to the whole number of westerly and easterly deflections, we deduce the proportional sums from the following table:

On account of the incompleteness of the record in the years 1840, 1843, and 1845, the number of eastern and western disturbances relative to the total number cannot be ascertained with accuracy. Th"Y are about equal in the record. .At Toronto the eastern predominate over the western in the proportion of 1. 17 to 1 (for the years 1841 to 1848,) and nearly to the same ex.tent for each year, taken separately. The numbers in the column headed "sum" do not indicate the law of the eleven year period as plainly and systematically as they did the investigation of the diurnal amplitude; yet giving half weight, on account of the want of record, to the sums for 1840 and 1845, the minimum number falls in the year 1843. More consistent results would, no doubt, have been obtained if the year 1845 had been complete.

O.M

Maxima and minima values are distinguished by an asterfok.

The numbers in each vertical column show a regular progression; and the number of disturbance:::, irrespective of their direction. have a minimum at 2 p. m. and a maximum at 2 a.m. * 'l'he principal contrast is between the hours of the day and the hours of the nigl1t; in the former case the numbers being below, but in the latter above the mean value. This is in close correspondence with the Toronto results. The most striking result of the above table is, that the westerly disturbances have their minimum precisely at the hour (8 p.m.) when the easterly lwve their maximum value; and the exact coincidence of this result with that deduced by General Sabine for Toronto is not less remrukable. For the westerly disturbances, the hours 6 a.m., (maximum,) and 8 p.m., (minimum,) and for the easterly disturbances the hours 2 p.m., (minimum,) and 8 p. m., (maximum,) are specially contrasted. These results also agree with those found at Toronto; and tbe accordance with that station even goes so far as to exhibit the secondary minimum of eastern disturbances at 8 a.m. In connection with this subject it may be here stated that the same distinguished magnetist found a singular mutual relation to subsist between the phenomena at Toronto and Point Barrow, on the shores of the Arctic sea-the laws of the easterly deflection at one station being found to correspond for the same local l1ours with those of the westerly deflections at the other station, and vice versa. This contrast ho1dR good for Philadelphia as well as for Toronto. We now pass to the co11sideration of the amount of deflections caused by the disturbances, classifying the same according to years, months, and hours:

The table includes only the series of bi-hourly observations, the reduction of the numbers from incomplete year,; to tho correct sum for the whole year being effected by means of ratios, as in the discussion of the unmbcr of disturbances. For comparison the average value of a disturb:mce at 'l'oronto is added. It mm;t be remarked that the amuunt of deviation from the uormal, constituting a disturbance, was nearly but not quite tho same at Toronto as at Philadelphia, so that the ratio,; of the corresponding numbers in the last two columns should be compared. The eleven year period is well marked in the aggregate value of the disturbances as well as in their average value in the different years; and the year 1843 is decidedly indicated as the mm1mum. To find a more precise value for the epoch of the minimum, the formula ~= 7'.09--0'.930 (t--1840.5) 0'.149 (t--1840.5) 2 has been constructed, which represents the observed values as follows:

The last column of ratios of the aggregate value of the disturbances of each month to the mean of all corresponds very closely to the analogous ratios deduced in a preceding table for the number of disturbances, giving the law in reference to the number and amount of disturbances in a year as the same, or nearly so. The maximum amount of disturbances occurs in October, (at Toronto in September,) the minimum amount in June, (thfl same at Toronto;) the secondary maximum occurs in April, (as at Toronto), and the secondary minimum in February, but at Toronto in January, from comparison with the years 1843, 1844, 1845.

If we compare these ratios with the corresponding numbers in the preceding tables showing the bi-hourly distribution in regard to the number of disturbances, we find, irrespective of the directions of the deflections, the 2 p. m. minimum preserved; the maximum occurs at 10 p. m. At Toronto, from a five years' hourly series, commencing with 1844, these hours are respectively 1 p. m. and 9 p. m. A.t Philadelphia, as at Toronto, the ratios are nearly invariable from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m., being then below unity; and again from 8 p. m. to 8 a. m., when they are above unity. The easterly maximum and the westerly minimum at 8 p. m., appear again as a decided feature, and in general the respective ratios exhibiting the diurnal distribution of the disturbances, both in an easterly and westerly direction, show almost a perfect correspondence in regard to both number and amount.

The law governing tho cli~turbances during a solar day is clearly shown, and systematic in character. If we plot the disturbance curve on the same scale, or actually superpose it on the curves of the regular diurnal variation, (diagram 2, sketch No. 37,) the difference would hardly show to the eye. The diagram (No. 4) showing the disturbance variation has, therefore, been plotted 011 a larger scale. The curve has but one maximum and one minimum; its most prominent feature is the easterly deflection at 8 o'clock ( 19~ m.) p. m., (at Toronto it is at 9 p. m.) At that hour the maximum deflection amounts to 32" of arc, and to 45" at Toronto. The greatest westerly deflection occurs at 6h. (+ 19~m.) a. m., and amounts to but 14"; the Toronto hour is 8 a. m. with 6", and from a five years' series of observation with 31" of deflection. The range of the disturbance variation equals 46 11 *. The disturbance amplitude, as well as the regular variation amplitude, is greater at Toronto than at Philadelphia, the occurrence of the maximum and minimum disturbance deflection seeming to be about one hour earlier at the latter station. From three in the morning till five in the afternoon, the mean effect of the disturbances i.s to deflect the north end of the magnet to the west, and during the remaining hours (principally at night) to the east. The westerly and easterly disturbance deflections during a day balance within 0 11 .02. The annual inequality in the amplitude of the diurnal disturbance variation might be satisfactorily shown by the proper combination of the results for consecutive years, comparing each two-year series successively; but owing to the small amount of the amplitude itself, and the incomplete or partly interrupted series of observations in the years 1840, 1843, and 1845, it was thought best to i:estrict the present discussion to the mean disturbance variation. It is my intention to continue the discussion of the observations made at the Girard College observatory.

He finds a very close correspondence between the computed and observed values of (3, and gives in a table Dr. Lamont's and his own results between tlie years 1835 and 1850. He also reaffirms liis former value for tlie average length of the solar spot period, viz, 11.11 years± 0.04 years, the limits of variation being 8 and 16 years. This period is deduced from observations of maxima and minima since 1626. For Philadelphia we have (3 7'.080 0'. 039 a, representing the observed amplitudes as follows:

The correspondence between the observed diurnal amplitude and the same derived from observations of the solar spots is further exhibited by diagram 5, Sketch No. 37, the heavy line representing the magnetic, the other the solar, amplitude curve. The dotted curve is from the Toronto magnetic observations, merely multiplied by ·~to reduce (approximately) to the Philadelphia scale. The next maximum amplitude, according to the solar spot observations, would be in 1848, amounting to 11'. 00; and the whole range of the inequality in the amplitude of tho diurnal motion would, therefore, be 11'.00-7'.46 = 3'.54. The last quantity. it must be observed, is slightly variable with each period; thus, according to the solar spot observa· tions, the year 1837 was a maximum, amplitude 11'.41; and the year 1856 a minimum, amplitude 7'. 24, the difference being 4'.17. It is much to be desired that this interesting branch of physical inquiry should be further studied, as it forms one of the links connecting terrestrial with cosmical phenomena.

COMPUTING DIVISION, COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Nove:mhtr 4, 1M9.
DEAR Sm: In accordance with the Superintendent's letter of January 21, 1859, I have prtl· pared a set of tables for practical use, giving the secular change of the magnetic declination, and showing for every tenth year, from the date of the earliest reliable observations to the present time, the magnetic declination (commonly called the variation of the magnetic needle) for stations on or near the northeastern coast of the United States, and also for some stations on our southern and western coasts-as derived from my several discussions of the secular change, in which have been included the latest data in possession of the Coast Survey. For the eastern and southern coasts the following papers may be referred t-0: Coast Survey Beport for 1855, .Appendix No. 48, pp. 306-337: Coast Survey Report for 1858, Appendix No. 25, pp. 192-195; and Appendix No. 26, pp. 195-197. For the western coast, Coast Survey Report for 1856, Appendix No. 31, pp. 228-235, may be consulted. In general, the secular change of the declination appears to be of a periodic character, but

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

297

in no instance has a whole cycle been completed on either coast. Its length, therefore, remains necessarily in a great measure uncertain, and the tentative analytical process so far followed has for its main object the proper representation of all reliable observations made at any one station, so as to furnish the means of interpolation, and also to enable us to calculate the magnetic declination for any required place and date within the limits of the discussion. In the investigation of 1855 a linear function was used in the discussion, which does not involve the duration of the period, and on this account the results were, in regard to time, of rather limited extent.-(See remark on p. 337 of Report for 1855.) For the Western Coast stations, I still prefer to retain this form of the discussion. Subsequently, by means of the knowledge gained in that discussion, an attempt was made to substitute a circular function, directly involving a period or periods, the length of which, as well as all other numerical co-efficients in the formula for the secular change, has been determined by applying the method of least squares. The use of a circular function-commenced in 1858 with two stations-is now extended to eighteen, within the limits stnted above, and it has also been applied to some stations in Canada, the southern coast of the United States, and Central America, in order to furnish material for the generalization of the law, so far as ascertained, in reference to epochs and rate of change. A secondary period within the first was traced at several stations, its length, however, being much more variable and uncertain was found fluctuating between one-half and one-fifth of the primary period, while its amplitude was on the average fifteen times smaller than that of the primary wave for stations forming group 1, or within the geographical limits of Portland, Burlington, and Williamsburg. This smaller amplitude was found nearly constant, and equal to 0°.4. To make the present paper more complete, it contains also the record of all observations used in the discussion not heretofore published in the Coaist Survey reports. As long as the cause producing the secular change remains altogether unknown, it is not safe to trust too far to the continuation of the law thus empirically derived; and in the following tables no value, deduced by the formula, has been inserted antecedent to the first observation by more than ten years. The tabular values may, therefore, be regarded in the light of a strict interpolation between actual observations; and since the analytical treatment will equalize and remove, in a measure, accidental errors of observation, they may be considered as certainly more trustworthy than any single observation, particularly in cases where the number of observations available for the discussion exceeds half a dozen, properly distributed in relation to time. The probable error of any single representatiou will be found in the second table. For all ordinary use by the surveyor (or navigator) the tabular values are sufficiently precise; when greater accuracy is required, the annual inequality of the declination and the diurnal variation for the time required must be taken into account. The former correction will probably not ~xceed, in any case, one minute, and the latter may amount in summer, in maxima, to minus or plus eix minutes, and in winter to minus or plus three minutes-numbers which were derived from Prof. Bache' s discussion of the Philadelphia observations. The table will also answer for intermediate places, for which they furnish the necessary data of int.erpola· tion. It is proper to state that the present formulre should be considered as liable to future changes and improvements depending on the accumulation of additional observations; and it is hardly necessary to state that their number also may hereafter be considerably increased by the accession of new material. The utility of a publication of tables showing the declination for

NOTs.-At Cambridge, Ma.88., the olnlervations after 1£155 require furtbere:r:aminatlon. At Williamsburg the values between 1700 And 1770 were not The expression for Baltimore dependd for lf"ngth of period and time of minim am on tbe Washington farrnula .

. The total number of observations upon which the tabular values and the formula are batmd is 180; the average number for any one station is 10; and the average probable error of any single representation is ± 11'. If we arrange the stations geographically, we find that at the eastern stations the minimum (west) declination occurred earlier than at the more western and southern stations; thus, from six stations, between Portland and Providence, it occurred about the year 1777 in the Connecticut and Hudson valleys, and along the sea-coast as far south as Washington; the year of the minimum does not differ much from 1797; Williamsburg, in Virginia, give8 1815. The transi· ti on, as we pass from the New England States, is somewhat abrupt, but too well marked to be accidental. Extending the investigation further north, I find for Quebec, Canada, the year of the minimum 1769; going further west, we find that at Toronto it must have occurred before the yea.r 1842; and at York Fort, Hudson Bay, I find the year 1842, (as already ascertained by Gen' l Sabine, after the receipt of Capt. Blakiston' s observations of 1857.) This latter station is nearly halfway across the continent; and if we proceed to the Western Coast, we find that the eastern declination there has not yet reached its maximum, (equivalent to a western minimum,) but it is highly probable that it will reach it before the close· of the preseut century. The present reverse, or western motion of the isogonic lines in our eastern States, which commenced about the year 1777, will gradually be communicated to the more westerly stations, and will, it is highly probable, be participated in on our Western Coast before or at the close of the present century, the direction of the motion in this latter locality being at present still to the eastward and southward, though with a diminishing rate.- (Seep. 235 of Coast Survey Report of 1856.)

Proceeding in a southerly direction, the next station discussed outside of the boundaries of the United States is Havana, Cuba, latitude 23° 09 1, longitude 82° 22', for which place I found D =- 4°.82 - 1°.45 cos (1.3 n + 26°) with 1810 as the year of maximum east declination. The values collected for Jamaica were not discusstJd, but the 9 values I was able to obtain will be found in the appended record. For Panama, New Granada., lat.+ 8° 57', long. 79° 29', the southernmost station discussed, I find D = - 6°.9 - 1°.04 cos (1.2 n + 74°,) an equation satisfying the observatiom1, but not considered as preferable to the following expression: D 5°.57 - 2°.21 cos (1°.2 n 34°,) which supposes the maximum to occur in 1802. Going westward and northward, I found for Vera Cruz, Mexico, lat. 19° 12', long. 96° 09', D = - 4°.2 - 5°.04 cos (1°.l n 7°,) with the maximum east declination in 1824.

The next station discussed, south of California, is San Blas, Mexico, lat. 21° 32' north, long. 105° 16' west of Greenwich, which gave the following expression.-(See p. 234, Coast Survey Report of 1856.) D = - 8°.63 - 0.042 n - 0.000 31 n 2 , which equation, when compared with those above, shows a reversal in the sign of the co-efficient of n51 , or an opposite curvature. The annual easterly increase at San Blas in 1850, according
I

to the above formulro was 3.3 per annum.

This station, however, is already within the area of the peculiar form of the isogonic lines, which position may possibly render an immediate comparison impracticable. The station Sitka, in Russian America, is the next place, north of Washington Territory, discussed. I find for it the approximate formula: D = - 28°.12 - 0.0607 n - 0.00025 n 2 · It depends for its latest declination (1858) on the tabular value assigned by Mr. Evans on bis late map of the lines of equal magnetic variation reduced to 1858.

APPENDIX No. 25.
Gulf Stream explorations.-Third memoir: Distribution ef temperature in the water ef the Florida channel and straits: By .A.. D. Bache, Supt. U. 8. Coast Survey. (Communicated, by authority ef the Treasury Department, to the American .A.ssociation for the .Advancement ef Science.)
The results of the explorations of the Gulf Stream in the survey of the coast have beA~ communicated to the Association from time to time, as phenomena of peculiar interest have been developed. The original plan of these explorations having been carefully studied, and having proved successful, has steadily been adhered to. The more recent observations have been directed to that part of the stream, between Havana and Cape Florida, known as the channel and strait of Florida. I have now to present four sections, showing the depth and temperature in this most important region of the Gulf Stream. These results are from the observations of Commander B. F. Sands and Lieut. Oomg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistants in the Coast Survey, whose names have already been mentioned before the Association in connection with explorations of the Gulf Stream, and furnish a sufficient guarantee that the results have all the reliability which care, experience, and zealous labor could give them. Section No. 1, (Sketch No. 35,) from Cape Florida to Bernini, was run by Lieut. Comg. Craven in May, 1855; Section No. 4 by Commander Sands in May, 1858; and Sections Nos. 2 and 3 by Lieut. Comg. Craven in April and Ma.y of the present year, 1859. Sections 2, 3, and 4 are perpendicular to the direction of the stream at distances of about fifty, one hundred, and two hundred miles from Cape Florida. The lines of sections are shown upon the chart marked .A. The Florida strait is funnel-shaped, being about ninety miles wide at Havana and about forty-five miles wide at Cape Florida, the narrowest part.

Form

ef

bottom.

The area of the water way and the form of the bottom are represented on diagrams 7, 8, 9, and 10, (Sketch No. 35.) The Arabic numerals at the top represent distances from the Florida coast (the keys) in miles, and the numbers below them the positions at which obBervations were made. The numbers at the left hand represent the depth in fathoms. Commencing at the Cape Florida section, it will be seen that there is a rapid descent of the bottom to the Havana section, from three hundred and fifty fathoms to eight hundred fathoms, or twenty-seven hundred feet in a distance of two hundred miles. The most shallow, as well as the narrowest part of the stream, it1, therefore, at Cape Florida. The deepest water follows the coast of Cuba and the Grand banks, the depth being eight hundred fathoms at a distance of only five miles from Havana, nearly four hundred fathoms within five miles of Salt Key bank, and three hundred fathoms close to the island of Bernini. The descent from the Florida side is for the most part gradual, but from the opposite side abrupt. This t.ffect seems to have been produced by the action of the sub-current in wearing a deeper channel upon the concave side of the stream. At Havana there is an abrupt descent of nearly a mile within :five miles of the shore, while on the side of the Tortngas and Key West the water is comparatively shallow and the descent gradual. This fact goes to confirm the conclusion that the stronger current

307

of the Gulf Stream makes the circuit of the Gulf of Mexico; since, if it impinged directly upon the islands of Key West and the Tortugas, we should find its effects in the wearing of a deeper channel on that side.
TEMPERATURES.

Change of temperature -with depth.
In a former communication the law of change of temperature with depth was discussed, and types of the curves representing the law were given for different parts of the stream. These curves were all merely modifications of a more general form. Thus, the cold water between the Gulf Stream and the coast gave one form, the axis of the stream another, and the water beyond the axis a third form, while in the Strait of Florida a fourth was developed. It would be natural to expect, in the course of many years' explorations by different individuals, with different instruments, not even of the same class, that general phenomena of this character should present ~ome contradictions and some inexplicable results. Experience, however, has confirmed the first conclusions and the constancy of the phenomena. It is not difficult, having the curve representing the temperatures at any position from the surface to the depth of several hundred fathoms, to determine, from the temperatures alone, in what part of the stn~am they were taken.

Temperature in a direction perpe:ndicUlar to the stream.
Diagrams 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Sketch No. 35) show the changes of temperature for the same depth in each of the sections, and diagrams 7, 8, 9, and 10 the depth for the same temperature.

Bands

of warm and cool water.

In the section from Cape Florida to Bernini the division of the stream into bands is plainly exhibited, though more faintly than in the northern sections, and the form of the bottom in this section shows also elevations and depressions corresponding to the divisions. In the sections south of Cape Florida all traces of the bands seem to disappear, as well as the ridges of the bottom. The bands, therefore, seem to have their origin near Cape Florida; and the conclusion stated some years ago as the probable one is strengthened, that they are caused by the ridges a.ud valleys of the bottom parallel to the general course of the stream, and along which the stream and ~<mnter-stream have their course.
The Oo'ld Wall. The Cold Wall, as an exception to the remark made above in reference to the bands, is traced as far as the Tortugas, and is plainly shown in all the sections with more or less distinctness. In the Sombrero key section (No. 3) it is strongly marked at depths ranging from seventy to a hundred fathoms, while in all the sections the warm water at the surface overflows the Oold Wall and reaches quite to the shore. Diagram No. 6 represents the comparative curves of the Cold Wall in different sections of the Gulf Stream, including those in the Straits of Florida.. The figures at the top show the dista.nees of the cold wall from the shore in the different sections, and the numbers on the left the degrees of temperature. The curves are drawn for different depths in the several sections, as shown in the notes at the bottom of the diagram. The dotted curves, g, 11, i, k, represent the Cold Wall in the four sections under consideration.

Longitudinal sections.
It has been found very difficult to deduce any sati'E;factory law for the decreaFe of sm face temperature along the axis of the stream, owing to the variability of the temperature of the waters of the regions from whence the Gulf Stream is supplied. Two modes of investigating the subject have been pursued ; oue, by following the stream from the Gulf of Mexico, and making hourly observatious of the temperature of the water, and the other by comparing the mean temperatures of the various sections with each other and with the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico. In the first method the vessel must be allowed to drift with the current of the stream, a difficult condition except in the best weather, even for a day, and to float along thus for hundreds of miles would rarely be practicable. .Any motion communicated by sails or by steam must carry the vessel beyond the water in whiGh she commenced her voyage, and the lateral overflow carries the water constantly from the axis towards the edges of the stream. In the comparison of mean temperatures of the different sections the fact has been establii>hed that the temperature of the water of the stream at any point may be higher than at a point nearer the source, and hence vessels in running along the stream may, and generally do, pass through water not of a constantly diminishing temperature, but from cool to warm, and the reverse. 'l'his is to be explained mainly, though not entirely, by the variability of temperature at the source. Ry taking the mean temperature of any one section and going back to the date of the departure of the waters from the Gulf of Mexico as determined by the velocity of the stream, and comparing the temperatures observed with the temperatures of the Gulf waters, it was supposed that a solution of the question might be obtained. The temperatures were taken from the most authentic meteorological records of the Gulf for a series of years, and those periods sought which corresponded to the dates desired. The uncertainty of the temperatures of tho waters of the Gulf of Mexico, as obtained from air temperatures taken here and there along its shores, rendered the results unsatisfactory. Enough seems to have been determined, however, to show that the surface temperature of the Gulf Stream along its course is variable; that a vessel sailing aloug the axis at a more rapid rate than the motion of the stream will pass through water of higher and lower temperature, depending generally upon two conditions, viz: the distance from the Gulf of Mexico, and the temperature of the Gulf at the time the water entered the straits of Florida; and further, that the latter cause is t~ predominating one in the parts of the Gulf Stream adjacent to the Atlantic coast, where the current is rapid. The influence of the form of the bottom in forcing the cold counter current of the bottom upward has been adverted to, and the fact appears to be well established in the cross sections, where the ridges and valleys parallel to the direction of the stream separate it into bands of wa.rmer and cooler water, and this conclusion, as has just been stated, is strengthened by the fact that the bands and ridges simultaneously disappear sontb of Cape Florida. This pbenom· enon fo moreover strikingly exhibited in the longitudinal section of the bottom in connection with the lower temperatures. The shallowness of the stream in the Strait of Florida, connected with the fact that the bottom falls off rapidly to the north and south, afforded an excellent opportunity for testing this question. If the cold water of the under polar current follows the bottom it should appear in the shallow part of the strait, and here the warm water of the surface and the cold water of the bottom would approach each other. Diagram No. 1 shows the curves of 40°,

45°, and 50° (bottom temperatures) along the deepest part of the stream, commencing at Sandy Hook and running as far as the Tortug;as. .All these curves rise with the -bottom and pass over the ridge which divides the bed of the Atlantic from that of the Gulf of Mexico, and again fall with the slope of the bottom towards the Gulf. In the narrowest part of the strait, where the depth is three hundred and fifty fathoms, the temperature, from the surface to the bottom, ranges between 80° and 40°.

On the effects qf pressure on Saxton's Deep-sea

thermomele~·.

In the explorations of the Gulf Stream the t(>mperatures below one hundred fathoms have mostly been determined by Saxton's metallic thermometer, and although the results have been consistent amongst themselves, and have agreed well with the indications of other thermo· meters, yet it was thought advisable to determine the effect of pressure by direct experiment. Saxton's thermometer consists essentially of a compound ribbon of silver and platinum. fused and pressed together by rollers. This ribbon is wound in a spiral form, one end of the i;:piral being firmly fastened to an interior t<olid axis, and the other left free. Upon the free end is placed an index arm, which moves over a circular graduated scale, carrying with it a friction band or indicator, which is left at the extreme point of the arc reached by the true index. The instrument is enclosed in a case, to which the water is freely admitted. A variation of temperature is immediately noticed, as the effect is to give a rotary motion to the index. The experiments to determine the effect of pressure were made at my request by :Mr. J. ~I. Batchelder, ~ith means devised by Mr. Thomas Davison ut the Novelty Iron Works. The following description of the apparatus employed is given by the last named gentleman. "The gauge (Sketch No. 35) consists of a brass cylinder H about eight inches long, into which a steel plunger is fitted, tbe upper part of the plunger at A being . 70 of an inch in diameter, and the lower at B about . 786, so that the difference in area of the ends is equal to one-tenth of a square inch. The cylinder is bored out a little larger than the plunger, except for about a fourth of an inch near each end, at C and D, where both are accurately fitted. To the branch Ea pipe connects, communicating with the hydraulic cyllnder, and leading the water into the centre of the gauge, which it reaches after passing through the chamber F, filled with sponge to prevent any impurities in the water from reaching the plunger. The upper end of the plunger connects by a wire W to a spring, as shown in the sketch at G, so constructed as to indicate presimre from 0 to 450 pounds, the spring being so strong that 450 pounds produce a movement of the plunger equal to three-eighths of an inch. It is evident that, as the difference in area of the ends of the plunger is one-tenth of an inch, one hundred pounds pressure from the water on this surface, as indicated by the balance, would equal a pressure of water of 1, 000 pounds per inch, or a pressure ten times as great as that indicated by the balance throughout its scale. The only difficulty in the use of the gauge is that of fitting the plunger to the cylinder, so that, while it is perfectly free to move, it is also water· tight. 'l'his difficulty, however, has been overcome, and much advantage was also derived from Mr. Batchelder's suggestion for supplying tho wear of the plunger and cylinder by depositing brass on the plunger through the galvanic process. " Connected with this gauge by a pipe is a strong wrought-iron cylinder sixteen inches long by four inches in diameter, in which the thermometer was placed, the opening being firmly closed by a screw plug. This second cylinder w9! immersed in a tub of water for the purpose

of regulating the temperature. The thermometer once placed in the cylinder is not again removed, the index being read by means of a mirror until the observations are completed. By the use of this apparatus tl1e effect of pressure up to 4, 000 pounds per square inch was observed upon two thermometers, and the results are given below. The observations were made to indicate the effects of 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 2,500 pounds pressure, &c. Seven series of experiments were made with thermometer No. 5, and five series with No. 10. The mean results show that. a pressure of 1, 000 pounds per square inch has no effect upon the ther-. mometer ; at l, 500 pounds the effect is less than one degree ; and from 1, 500 to 4, 000 pounds ' per square inch the effect is to diminish the readings, the maximum effect being seven degrees. The diagram (Sketch No. 35) exhibits the law of diminution by increase of pressure, and the depth con:esponding to different pressures. The correction to be applied varies with the depth· For thermometer No. 5 it is only four-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit at the depth of 600 fathoms. For thermometer No. 10 it is one degree at the same depth. At 1,500 fathoms the corrections are respectively five and a half and seven degrees. Nearly all the temperatures observed in the Gulf Stream have been taken at depths less than 600 fathoms.

Report qf Assistant Henry Mitcliell on the physical, surveys of New York harbor and the coast qf Long Island, with descriptions qf apparatus /or observing currents, &c.
September 30, 1859. Sm: I have the honor to inform you that the field-work comprehended in your plan for the physical survey of New York harbor bas been completed by the operations of the past season.
BosTON,

At the commencement of this work it was quite impossible to foresee the form it would ultimately assume, the questions t-0 which it would give rise, or the investigations to which it would lead. Neither the precise character of the observations to be made, nor the extent to which they should be carried, could be estimated in an undertaking in many respects qui:e novel and without precedent. Certain changes in the forms of shoals and channels had been revealed by the comparison of the early surveys with those of more recent date, and the questions arose-To what causes are these changes due? and-To what end do they progress? What are the natural forces which build in one direction shoals and beaches, while opening elsewhere new channels, or wearing away the shores? These wern the problems for the solution of which the physical survey was instituted. The general plan of this work, to which you first directed my attention, has been adhered to throughout; since your subsequi::nt instructions have referred to the limits of each season's work, rather than to the character of it. By this plan we have been required to observe, and make note of, every natural operation, whether of tides, currents, winds or wiwes ; in fine, to compile for a certain period a complete physical history of these elements from a systematic course of inquiry. The field over which our observations have spread includes not only the harbor proper, but its approaches in all directions, extending up the Hudson river to Fort Washington, into Long Island sound as far as Execution light, through the kills, over the bar, and sixty miles out to sea. Throughout this field the periods, velocities, and paths of the various currents are determined, as a1·e also the experiences of the tide waves (both from the sound and the ocean) in the different channels and avenues which they traverse. The disturbing effects of winds and freshets, the appearance of rips and eddies, together with general meteorological phenomena, have all been noted carefully. The whole number of tidal and current stations which we have occupied exceeds one hundred and fifty, and at these the observations number many thousands. Many of the tidal stations were occupied one or more entire lunations, and at some of the current stations the observations were continued in unbroken series of half-hourly records for seven, nine, and fourteen days. The aggregate amount of time spent on the field-work has not exceeded twelve months. &ugh computations of our observations were made in the intervals between the working $e&Bons, and these acquainted us with the progress we were making, aud pointed out the direction which succeeding inquiries should take. From the results of our labors we gained at each step confidence and encouragement. What appeared at first a tangled skein of accidental or inconstant causes, we ultimately recognized as orderly and harmonious relations; and, our

methods of observing improviug steadily, tLe work advanced to its close at a pace constantly accelerated. The observations of the past season were confined to no special locality, but were made at various points where previous operations were incomplete or required connecting links. Our field-work commenced the first of June, and the quiet weather which prevailed during this month was improved for the occupation of the more exposed stations-those near shallow portions of the bar and along the outside coast. We had designed to occupy a station which, should, if possible, lie quite beyond the reach of the New York harbor drift, an:l enable us to determine whether any oceanic current sweeps into the great bay formed by the coasts of Long Island and New Jersey. For this purpose we anchored, in thirty fathoms water, nearly sixty miles east-southeast of Sandy Hook, where, during a period of fifteen hours, we measured the currents at the surface, and at depths of twenty-three and one hundred and fifty feet, besides a few determinations of the mean motion for the e_µtire depth. At this station, nearly forty miles from the nearest land, we found regular tidal currents, nearly as strong as those observed at the light-ship the previous season. No oceanic current could be detected, but the augmentation of the ebb current, caused by the drainage of the land waters, was very.appreciable. The velocities of the currents are not so regular at this station, from the fact that the depth of the moving water stratum is variable, at ·one time extending to the bed of the sea, at another reaching but a short distance below the surface. The directions of the flood and ebb drifts were found to be respectively west-southwest and east by south; which, making due allowance for the disturliing effects of the land waters, would indicate that the tide-wave has here a westerly motion. The land waters of which we have spoken are doubtless the combined drainage from X ew York harbor and the various inlets; for, extending our observations along the south shore of Long Island, we found that they outlive the tidal currents, and establish themselves as a constant coastwisc stream along the eastern portion of Fire Island beach. The stations outside of the bar were eleven in number, at which above seventeen hundred observations were recorded, and of these more than five hundred were made at points below the surface. The greater part of our season's work lay in the lower bay or in the vicinity of the bar, where there remained some localities unexamined and .others at which previous examinations had given discordant results. From the computations which followed the field-work of 1858, it appeared that where observations were sufficient1y numerous the causes of a certain class of shoals were immediately deducible from the data obtained. It was ascertained, on making a composition of the currents at each station, with the assumption that they are to be regarded as forces acting simultaneously, that the resultants take directions towards the shoals as focal points; making it evident that the sand which form1:1 these sboals is gradually swept together from the neighboring channels. Simple as the dynamics of this natural process may be, its form can only be developed from the most accurate determinations of the elements. The resultant, for instance, may be a very small quantity from a station at which the adverse currents are very violent. In a case like this, the slightest error of observation, or even the selection of an unsuitable period, may give us a false result and lead us entirely astray. If the observations are not sufficiently frequent, they may foil to give the exact durations of certain phases of the currents; or if the positions

313

of the stations are not closely determined, errors enter into the directions of the forces. .Again: if the observations are not continued long enoug·L. to elimi11ate the diurnal inequalities, an undue weight will be given to some of the elements which enter into the problem. .At the commencement of the past season, forewarned of these difficulties, I placed in the hands of my observers printed rules for their guidance, and required of each person a strict conformity to them. Twenty-one stations were occupied in the portio11 of the work to which I have just referred, and at these the aggregate number of observations reaches nearly five thouimnd, of which above eighteen hundred are from points uelo\v the surface. At these stations the observations were usually kept up in unbroken serieB of twenty-five hours each . .A. more suitable period for observatioug of so exact a character could ;;;carcely have been chosen; our operations were rarely suspended by bad weather, and few delays of any kind occurred. In making observations upon bars and shoals, the disturbing effects of gfrong winds cannot be disregarded; for it not unfrequently happens that they change the direction of the current, or wholly reverse its course. In districts of shallow water the waves created by the winds have a motion of translation whose effect upon the log is very great; and although the observer is able to distinguish this sudden and uncertain motion from that of the more steady current, he cannot introduce a correction for it. Where the sea is deep, the impulses it receives from the winds result in simple undulations, giving to the log no horizontal motion whatever, so that, even when the swell is very heavy, accurate current observations are possible. As far as our experience has gone, we have never observed in the waves any power of transportation where the depth of water exceeds three fathoms. Above the Narrows there were eight stations occupied-three in the main channel of the harbor, two in the Hudson, and three in the East river. At these there were recorded over seventeen hundred observations, of which above eight hundred were made upon the subcurrents. The stations in the harbor, as well as those in the Hudson river, were designed to furnish us with additional data relative to a class of remarkable counter-currents di:ocovered the previous season. The former observations had established the fact that along the main channel the currents of the lowest water stratum maintain velocities and directions quite at variance with those near the surface. It, however, remained to be proved whether the phenomena obBervetl were continuous from station to station or mere local conditions; and if their continuity could be shown, the exact limits of their domain were to be ascertained. The information now in our hands affords, I am convinced, a full and faithful exhibit of these points. The three stations in the East river lie in positions which the previous work had shown to be important, as embracing the terminus of the Hell Gate interference current. .A.t one of these stations, which lies in the deep basin westward of the point of Blackwell's island, some curious conditions of the sub-currents manifested themselves. Here the axis of the ebb (west· erly) drift was observed to lie about twenty feet below the surface throughout the entire duration of this currenti in other words, the current is stronger at this depth than at any other point above or below. There are resemblances between this phenomenon and those already referred to as appearing in the main channel of the harbor, but I am doubtful whether we can class them together. In the discussion of our results, we propose to group the currents of the upper harbor according to tidal hours obtained from the self-registering gauge at Governor's

island, and those of the lower harbor and its approaches, according to tidal observations made simultaneously by eome of our own party at Sandy Hook. The closing work upon the physical survey of New York harbor, which we have briefly described, did not occupy us during tlie entire season, and there proved to be ample time for the other operations directed by your instructions, viz: inquiries into the physical conditions of the bays and inlets along the south shore of Long Island. · Glancing at a chart of our coast, one may see on the south shore of the island of N antuck;et a series of small ponds separated from the sea by narrow reaches of sand. On Martha's Vineyard the same features may be observed along the outer shore, except that here the larger basins or lagoons have occasional outlets through the strips uf sand beach. Further to the westward, upon the coast of Long Island, appear similar basins, so extensive as almost to form inland seas with outlets uf considerable depth, through which vessels may pass. Here are fully established the forms which may be distinguished as the leading characteristics of the Atlantic coast to the southward, and of the entire Gulf shore. From the past history of the sandy portion of our sea-coast, it appears that the outlets to which we have referred are never permanent, but continually shift their positions, either by gradual encroachments and recessions of the sand reaches, or by suddenly closing up at one point and breaking away at another. The design of our study was to ascertain, if possible, the causes which maintain these extended sandy reaches, and the agenc]es which create the channels through them. In this undertaking, the line of stations, to which reference was made in the former part of this report, extending along the coast, at intervals of from five to twelve miles from Coney island to a point twentyfive miles east of Fire Island light, gave us all the requisite data for a complete knowledge of the shore currents; and we added to these series of current observations at Fire island, Crow Gut, and Rockaway inlets, besides others from stations in the Great South bay. By half-hourly records at gauges temporarily erected, the form of the tide wave as it enters Fire Island inlet was compared with that observed at Sandy Hook on the one hand, and that at the eastern extremity of the Great South bay upon the other. At some of the outside stations we threw over sinking articles, hoping to find them again upon some portion of the beach, and thus be able to determine the direction of the movements on the bottom of the sea. The first class of articles we tried were baUs made of cement, with corks enclosed, giving them what we supposed to be the requisite specific gravity. On a former occasion these cement balls were used quite successfully along the shores of Sandy Hook, but we now found them to fail entirely on this coast, where the currents are more feeble. We subsequently had recourse to the large skim. mer shell (maclra solidissima) which we collected from the shores, and marked with drills. Some of these, cast over in three fathoms water off Oak Beach, travelled eastward, and cross· ing Fire Island inlet, were swept on shore four miles to the eastward of their place of deposit· In the performance of this journey they were occupied over two weeks, during a prevalence of easterly winds. Of three hundred shells cast into the sea, one hundred were recovereda much larger proportion than we could possibly have expected to find among the shifting sands and the miscellaneous stranded articles upon these beaches. The easterly preponder· ance in the movements of the currents along the bed of the sea, which the journey of these shells revealed, corresponds with the results from previous observations of the surface drifts As our inquiries proceeded, it became evident that th(I currents, powerful though they may be to scour channels and form the ocean bed, cannot alone effect the peculiar changes which are observed to take place in the beaches, but that the waves take a part, not insignificant, in

these operations. In the sl1allow waters along these alluvial shores the wavel'I, driving in from the ocean, acquire violent horizontal movements, and dash along the beach with a force in comparison with which the strongest currents are quite impotent. In order that we might the better understand and determine the precise action of the waves and the relation of their office to that of the current, we made a very careful examination of the conditions in miniature forms of bays and inlets, where the limited :field of observations afforded us a comprehensive view of the natural activities at work. The results of this examination have already been laid before you with such conclusions from them as were immediately obvious. In the course of this and former reports I have referred repeatedly to the obsen·ations of currents at different depths, and it has occurred to me that some description of the apraratus in use should here he given, in order that the reliability of the results should be established.

Descriptions

ef

.Apparatus.

For observations upon the surface currents we use a "tube-log, n which is simply a tin cylinder four inches in diameter and six feet long. This tube is partially filled with water, so as to sink nearly its whole length and maintain an upright position; and a graduated line being attached, the observations are made as with an ordinary ship's log. We have found that a log of less draught than this is liable to be affected by the wind. When we desire to obtain the mean motion of a stratum of greater depth, we use twentyfour foet tubes, and in some cases those as long as forty-eight feet. If the velocity of the current in the lowest water Rtratum is desired, we take the following course: Two copper globes of equal dimensions are connected by wirn rope of the smallest possible size compatible with the strength required. One of these globes, being filled with water, is allowed to sink the whole length of the c.:onnecting line, while the other, being empty, or only partially loaded, swims at the surface of the sea. To the upper globe the log line is secured. The velocity with which the globes, thus connected, will move, is a mean of the rates at which the upper and lower water strata are flowing; and if simultaneous observations are made with this apparatus and the surface log, before described, we are furnished with the means of obtaining by calculation the velocity of the lowest stratum. This method may be employed where the water is uot so deep as to give to the connecting wire rope an extent of surface which, exposed to the current, may require consideration in the problem. The instruments I have described thus far are similar to those which have been used in determining the discharge of canals in Europe. In the application of these to inquiries on a larger scale, I have found it necessary to make certain modifications of them to insure accuracy. It not unfrequently occurs that the velocity of the surface drift is many time;i greater tLan that of the lower stratum, or holds altogether a reverse direction, so that the motion of the globes is quite at variance with that of the surface log. In a case like this, the graduated line secured to the globes is borne away by the surface current, and the observer is deceived. The full extent of this difficulty will be appreciated when it is cons~dered that the line of which I ba>e spoken is necessa1·ily of considerable size, the strength of six men being sometimes required to draw in the globes. I propose to obviate this difficulty by the following arrangement: Within the upper globe, made of wood in this case, a reel is placed, upon which a small log-line, passing in at an aperture at the pole, is wound by a crank frr:nn without. The extremity of this log-line is secured to a third globe, which swims freely upon the surface of the sea. When making an observation, the log-line is wound up until t 1rn floating globes are

316

brought together; then, at a signal, the reel is loosened; and now, if the surface and ~u b currents differ in velocity, the free globe separates from the others, and the obsen'er notices the number of divisions of the log-line drawn out in thirty seconds. In this experiment the apparatus is in nowise connected with the vessel, but the observer follows in a boat until the trial is completed. Figure 1 (Sketch No. 40) shows the relative position of these globes during the course of the observations. In this figure A and R are the connected globes, while C is tho free float. The weight of the globe B causes the swimming globe A to sink nearly to itei pole, and the free float C is loaded so as to sink about the same distance. The graduated line,' which measures the separation of the floating globes, may be seen, one end fastened to a ring upon the free float C, the other passing in at the pole of the globe A. Figure 2 is an enlarged representation of the globe A, opened so as to show the reel within. The water, which enters the globe freely, acts ae a check, preventing this reel from acquiring an undue momentum with any sudden jerk of the line caused by the waves. In this figure may be seen the position of the crank by which the reel is wound; this crank is, of course, removed after the floating globes are drawn together. Upon the outside of the globe containing the reel every ten degrees are marked that the observer may note in his record the amount submerged. In the reduction of these observations the extent of the wetted surfaces of the two connected globes must be considered, since, in the case of a difference of velocity between the upper and lower strata, the effective areas of the surfaces exposed to the two streams enter into the problem. In all positions the effective surface which a globe wholly immersed presents to tho current is a great circle. The velocity attained by the connected globes is a s£mpk mean of the velocities of the superficial and lower strata when the effective surfaces are eq11,al,· and when these surfaces are unequal, the mean by weiyht. If x = velocity at surface, y volocity at lowest point; then with equal surfaces we obtain velocity of globes = £ (x y). If tho effective surfaces opposed to the drifts (portions of great circles) are unequal, and their areas be repre·

+

sented by a and b, we have the velocity of globes= a

~ b (ax +

This expression rep-

resents the immediate result obtained by the original manner of using the globes if the vessel be at anchor; but, in our modification, the result of our experiment is the difference between the motion of the free and that of the connected

The ext.ent

of the wetted surface of the free globe will not affect the result, but it is convenient to have this globe of the same size as the others so as not to be greatly affected by winds. lf the paths of the surface and sub-currents do not lie in the same vertical !'lane, the con· necteJ globes take an intermediate course, with velocity= a

In place of the two connected globes in the fore· going description, a hempen line is used, (perhaps two inches in diameter,) terminating in a wooden pole above and a leaden cylinder below, the former serving to fl.oat the shaft, while the latter sinks and straightens the line, and the reel is transferred to the free globe. (See Fig. 8, Sketch No. 40.) The apparatus, thus modified, will serve to exhibit the difference between the

surface drift and the mean velocity of a stratum of water whose depth equals the length of the immersed. If we know the surface velocity we may readily obtain the velocity of the lowest point reached, if we suppose the change qf velocity from point to point to be uniform, by subtracting the surface rate from twice the mean velocity. This supposition is not always correct, and must be tested by the following experiment: The log-line having been unfastened, the pole is passed through a copper globe, and the line drawn up until the globe can be secured at a point which will occupy a middle position of the wetted surface on again letting the shaft sink as far as it may.-(See Fig. 4, Sketch No. 40.) U pan a new trial, if the velocity observed is still the same, we may conclude that our supposition is correct; if not, we may, by shifting the position of the globe again and again, making at each remove an observl\tion and record, or by using simultaneously several such shafts, calculate apvroximately the conditions of the sub-currents and tbe curve at which our deep shaft hangs. The globeri which we have used measure two feet in diameter. Before closing this rapid sketch of our devices for obtaining the data required by your instructions, I would refer briefly to a new form given to a pile used in securing a tide-gauge at Fire island, and which, I think, possesses some peculiar advantages for use upon sandy coasts where there is a heavy sea. This pile is of oak, or other heavy and strong wood, and is so cut that the lower portion of it, for a space of Bix or eight feet, presents the appearance of a number of inverted frustrums of cones, placed one above another-the series terminating in a sharp and heavy shoeing. As a whole, it is required t-0 have a greater weight than the sand and water it is intended to displace. On working this pile int.o the sand, by swaying it to and fro, in the usual manner, each cone, as it sinks, acts upon the sand <ibove and beww, as at once a lever and a wedge, giving to the whole a continual downward thrust. In the same way the waves, instead of tearing it up, cause it to work deeper and deeper, and thus the lateral oscillation of the sea is converted into vertical motion, and brought to our a:id. Of course this downward tendency of the pile can be easily checked if too great for our purposes. .As my description of this pile is not altogether clear, I annex: a diagram, (Sketch No. 40,) which will require no explanation. Very respectfully, yours,

The stations have, during the past year, given generally good results. The station at Fort Clinch has, however, suffered an interruption by the sickness and subsequent sudden leaving of the observer, and the inexperience of the person he had left in charge. The stations on the Western Coast, under the supervision of Lieut. G. H. Elliot, U. S. Engineers, have continued to give very satisfactory results. The temporary stations were not numerous. The tide-gauge at the Washington navy yard is still kept up. Owing to the frer:pient changes of the officers in the ordnance department of the yard, it was found more advantageous to have the gauge attended to by Mr. Walker, of this division of the office. Tho stations mentioned in last year's report as having been established by Mr. Wurdemann at Charlotte harbor, Egmont key, and Cedar keys, have, together with the one at Tortugas, afforded very satisfactory results. The series being extended over more than a year, the gauges will shortly be transferred to new stations at and to the westward of St. Mark's. Mr. Wiirdemann has suffered greatly from sickness superindnced by exposure, and was obliged to leave that Rection at the approach of warm weather, without detriment, however, to the observations, thanks to the careful training he had given to the observers. On his way north, Mr. Wiirdemann visited the tide-gauges at Fort Clinch, Charleston, and Old Point Comfort. The self-registering tide-gauge established at Warrenton navy yard, Pensacola, Fla., by the kindness of S. T. Abert, esq., civil engineer of the yard, gives very good results, and will supply a useful link in the chain of stations which it is intended to establish successively along our shores on the Gulf of Mexico. Good self-registering observations were obtained at Benicia, Cal., under the direction of the hydrographic party of Commander J. Alden, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey. A fo1t of the observations received during the year is herewith presented. It contains, as usual, only those which were made under the direction of this division of the office, and not those made by hydrographic parties for the reduction of their soundings.

OFFICE·WORK.-The follm'l-·ing persons have been permanently employed during the year: R. S. Avery, S. Walker, J. Downes, M. Thomas, and S. D. Pendleton; and the following temporarily for longer or shorter periods during the intervals of their duties in the field or in other departments of the office: Lie.ut. J. P. Roy, U.S . .A..; Sub-Assistant C. Fend all; James Gilliss, R. E. Evans, 0. Hinrichs, J. Donegan, .A.. W. King, and T. 0. Bowie. :Mr. A very has continued the discussion of the Boston tidal observations. Having computed a set of co-efficients from a period of observations extending over nine years, he has compared the times of high water computed by means of them with the observed times for the whole period of twelve years over which the series extend. The difference; between the computed and observed times came out generally quite small. The readings of the sheets of the self-registering tide·gauges were made by .Mr. Walker, who has also had charge of the correspondence with the observers, of the examination of the observations returned by them, and of the tide-gauge at the Washington navy yard. This combination of duties has been very useful, as by reading the sheets no defects in them could escape him, and the remedy could be pointed out more intelligibly from the experience gained in managing a tide-gauge himself. The ordinary reductions of tidal observations were made chiefly by S. D. Pendleton, and part of the year by contract, by .A. W. King; also, occasionally, by Lieut. J. P. Roy, and J.

Gilliss, R. E. Evans, 0. Hinrichs, and T. C. Bowie. They thus keep but little behind the receipt of the observations. The whole sets of reductions of the permanent stations on the Western Coast were revised by Mr. Walker. The graphical decompositions of the tides observed simultaneously at the four stations Cape Florida, Indian key, Key West, and Tortugas, have continued to be made and the results to be reduced and compared by Mr. Downes, with the assistance for part of the time of Messrs. Fendall and Evans. This discussion is now nearly completed, and some progress has also been. made in the decomposition of the observations at the next stations-Tortugas, Charlotte har· bor, Egmont key, and Cedar keys. The daily inequality was deduced from a part of the ordinary reductions of the above stations by Mr. Gilliss. The meteorological observations made at the tidal stations of the W estem Coast have continued to be tabulated by M. Thomas, who has also read off some of the self-registering sheets from Florida, and plotted the result preparatory to decomposition, besides copying and miscellaneous work.

UNITED STATES SURVEYING SCHOONER VARINA,

Colleton river, S. C., May 21, 1859. The hydrographic work was commenced at Pinckney' s island, connecting with the survey of Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, in 1855. That survey sho1vs that the bar of the Chechessee river affords twenty feet at mean low water, with a mean rise and fall of 6. 6 feet. The depth increases in passing upward, and vessels that enter Port Royal sound will find in the Colleton river at the Neck, and at its confluence with the Chechessee, a capacious, completely protected, and easily accessible anchorage, in from four to seven fathoms water.

Colleton N eek, Foot Point, or Victoria Bluff, as it has been more recently called, is only eleven miles from the Charleston and Savannah railroad, and, by reason of the fact before stated, offers a very eligible site for purposes of trade and commerce. In the event of blockade of the southern coast by a naval power this point could be easily made a sure protection to the inland commerce passing between Charleston and Savannah. The bluff is considerably higher than the adjacent island, and is said to be healthy. The approach from Broad river is used by steamers continually, and might be improved so as to enable vessels of fifteen feet draught to pass. At present I think it safe to say that but ten or twelve feet at mean low water can be carried through. So soon as I can obtain the requisite tidal observations the soundings will be reduced and a chart sent to the office. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, CHAS. M. FAUNTLEROY, Li,eut. Comg. U'.

Sm: I have the honor to report the completion of the field-work and hydrography requisite. for a chart of Sapelo sound and river, including the bar and approaches, from a limit ten miles seaward of the entrance. The soundings in the vicinity of the bar were made by the party of Lieut. Oomg. C. M. Fauntleroy, U. S. N., assistant Coast Survey, who closed the operations there at the eud of April. I append some remarks made in the report of that officer, bearing on the commercial advantages of Sapelo sound as a harbor, and suggestions in reference to buoys and beacons for aiding vessel8 to enter it: "This harbor derives its importance commercially from its ea8e of acceRs and from the good depth of water in its main approach. Sixteen feet at mean low water may be carried throughout to safe anchorage inside of the entrance. As a cut-off connecting with it affords a convenient and safe inland passage for traders bound south coastwise during the winter season, this entrance is preferred to the more difficult entrance at Doboy. While the soundings were in progress in March and April, more than fifty schooners and steamers (chiefly the former class) passed into Sapelo sound and through Mud river. "At present the channel over the bar is marked by two buoys. The inner one ('No 3') should be at once removed and replaced at the extreme northeast point of the shoal designated as ' Consort shoal.' "There is both a swash and a beach channel here, and vessels drawing from five to eight feet of water may enter the harbor against northwesters-a facility uncommon on our Atlantic seaboard. "Upon a rough comparison (before plotting the soundings) with the survey made by Lieu· tenant Glynn, U. S. N., in 1841, there appears to have been little or no change since, either as to depth or in the direction of the main channel-way. "Masters of vessels, if not well acquainted, avail themselves of daylight for entering at Sapelo. It would be of important service t-0 the coasting trade if two small beacon lights were established, instead of the two beacons now on the point of St. Catharine's island, as such an arrangement would prevent confusion with the Doboy light. The schooner 'Blooming Youth,' lost off Sapelo entrance in March, could have made the harbor in safety with such guides as those now proposed." Regarding the aids for navigation recommended by Lieut. Comg. Fauntleroy as of general interest to masters of vesseli; engaged in the coasting trade, I would respectfully request that a copy of this communication may be transmitted to the Light-house Board.

APPENDIX No. 31.
ExtractR from reports made by Sub-Assistants F. W. Dorr and Charles Ferguson, describing t!te topographical and other features ef Charlotte harbor, Florida.
BosTON, March 29, 1859. The work of the season was resumed on the western :rnlf of * * * Sanibel island at a point. where its breadth is about two miles and a quarter. From thence the island runs in a W.NW. direction five miles and a half, and gradully narrows as it approaches Blind Pass. The inside shore is very irregular and broken by large lagoons, which connect with each other by narrow tortuous channels. On the outside a fine sloping beach, composed of sand and shells, is washed by the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The interior of the island is open prairie, bearing only scattered clumps of palmettoes. Mangrove, buttonwood, &c., are found fringing the shores of the lagoon8, and this growth occasionally attains a breadth of a quarter of a mile. The entrance to Blind Pass, as the channel which separates Sanibel from Captiva island is called, is almost entirely blocked up from the inside by extensive shoals, which arc dry, or nearly so, at ordinary low water. On the southern side of these shoals are eight small keys, called the Lawrence keys. They are scarcely anything more than clumps of mangrove. Blind Pass is merely a boat channel; for although the passage is deep in some places, the bars both on the inside and outside preclude the possibility of carrying through a vessel of any draught of water. Captiva island overlaps Sanibel island at Blind Pass for a distance of a mile and a half, and from that opening stretches in a N.NW. direction upwards of ten miles to Captiva Pass. This island, or key proper, scarcely averages a quarter of a mile in width. I say the key proper, as two other keys of some size, completely separated from it, have hitherto been supposed to join it; all three being comprised under the name of Captiva island. Captiva, like Sanibel island, has a regularly curving beach of sand and shells on the outside, while the inside shore is skirted with mangrove, and is very ragged. Extensive flats, too, make off eastward from most of the prominent points of land on the inside. Captiva Pass, the opening between Captiva and La Costa islands, is about five hundred yards wide. Vessels drawing not more than five feet of water can pass through; yet the channel is somewhat intricate. * * * * * Yours, very respectfully,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

La Costa island is similar in character to Captiva island, as described in the report of SubA.ssistant Dorr. Pinc island forms the eastern side of Ch11rlottc harbor, or what may be more correctly termed the Charlotte harbor approach. It is about ten miles in length and three in widtli. A pine barren runs through the centre nearly its entire length, and its western shore is lined with a belt of keys and i8lands. Lagoons break the western side and run in towards the interior of Pine island. This island is remarkable as having been a favorite burial place of the aborigines. There' are several huge mounds on the keys along the shore. The largest are at ''Brown's'' station, a small fishing ranch on Pine island, (nearly opposite the middle of La Costa,) where some are found sixty and eighty feet high and four hundred yards in circumference. Here also may be seen the remains of a canal which has passed at a former period quite across the island. Its site is now 80 overgrown with mangrove, pine, and palmetto that the trace is barely discernible.

0., August 23, 1859.

Sm: * * * * * * * * * Espiritu Santo bay. is about fifteen miles long, northeast and southwest, by about :five miles in width. It communicates with the Gulf of Mexico through two small bayous at the northeast end, and connects also with Matagorda bay at Pass Cavallo. Through one of the bayous (l\fcHonry's) the State authorities of Texas have caused a channel to be opened affording a depth of four and a half feet at average high water, and the digging of a channel of ten feet from the bayou into Pass Cavallo, to form a harbor or dock for steamers and other sea-going vessels, has been undertaken by private enterprize. The town of Saluria is situated at the east ewl of this bayou. Throughout the bay there is an f\Verage depth of seven feet, the li>ottom being generally soft mud and shells, except in one locality, known as tho "Middle Ground," which is sand, and a portion of which is usually bare at low water. The shores are low and marshy on all sides. Along the northwest shore is a range of marsh islands, approaching towards the cluster designated as the "First chain," which di vi des Espiritu Santo from San Antonio bay. Through these also the State has opened a channel to the depth of four and a half feet, but flats are forming rapidly at both ends, and constant attention will be required to keep it open. San Antonio bay is of an irregular and somewhat triangular shape, the greatest length being, from north to south, about twenty miles, and the width ranging from four to eighteen miles.

It has no direct communication with the Gulf of Mexico, and is, therefore, but little affected by the Gulf tides. Frequently the water is made fresh by the discharge from the Guadalupe river, which enters at its northeast end, and it is almost always muddy. The average depth of the south half of the bay is about six and a half feet, with soft mud bottom, except in the vicinity of the oyster shell reefs, of which there are many. One of them, "Panther Point reef,'' extending through the middle of the bay, north and south, about fifteen miles, is awash in some places and in others has five feet of water over it. In approaching the mouths of the river, the water of the bay shallows, and the bottom becomes very soft, and is covered with eel-grass and other sea-weeds. The State, in the spring of 18.58, opened a channel of four and a half feet from the southern mouth of the Guadalupe to a like depth in the bay, which 1vas found at the distance of a mile, but it is now much obstructed by drift logs. Without the use of artificial means, the average depth of water into either mouth of the river would not be more than eighteen inches. The shores of San Antonio bay are varied in character. Along its south and east sides are the low marshy shores of the islands, (Matagorda island and others,) which are the re Ro rt of immense numbers of water fowl. Thousands of swans, geese, brant, and ducks of several varieties, cover the waters and prairie of this region during January, February, and March; and in all seasons the pelican, cranes of perhaps every variety, the snipe, and other sl1ore birds, are found in countless numbers. Oysters are plenty, and also redfish and trout, when the water is not too fresh. N oar the north end, on the east side of the bay, the prairie of Matagorda island comC's to the shore in a bluff twenty feet high, along which (for several miles) are scattered cluster:; of oak and hackberry trees. This locality, known as "Long :Motts,'' contains fifteen or twenty houses. The northwest shore is the delta of the Guadalupe, a low alluvial formation, scarcely raised above the level of the adjacent waters, and covered with a d~rnse growth of cane-grass, jungle, and forest trees. On the west shore the elevated prairie also comes to the bay in a bluff or bank of twenty feet, and is likewise dotted over with the houses of settlers, and with oak and hackberry trees. The soil is fertile, the range for stock excellent, and the locality is said to be very healthy. At one place on this side a singular range of sand hills, known as the ''Sand Mounds," approaches the shore. The highest peak is about seventy.five feet above the bay. The mounds are covered with bushes, and the valleys between them filled with tr~es, so that, at a distance of five or six miles, the whole presents the appearance of a forest of live-oak or similar timber, forming a marked feature in that otherwise level prairie region. Deer, wolves, and wild turkeys are plenty, and rattlesnakes and other reptiles numerous. In the direction towards Lamar, a distance of about thirty miles, there is now but one dwelling, and hence the wild game has not been much disturbed. Mission bay is a limall, shallow sheet of water cut off from the head of San Antonio bay, on the east side, by the delta of the Guadalupe river, and having uot over eighteen inches of water into or through it. A small bayou, entering on its east side, drains Green lake, which is a small sheet of fresh water lying some miles further up the delta. Hi'MS bay, on the west side of the delta, is of the same character, but is larger, being about three and a half miles i1.1 diameter and shaped like a horse-shoe. It is also deeper than Mission bay, affording about three feet of water to its head. On the north side is the swamp of the

326

HEPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

delta, but on the south a prairie bhlff twenty feet high boundB the shore, and here, within space of three miles, some twenty or thirty houses form what is called "Crescent Village." San Antonio bay is divided from Mezquit bay by a chain of islands known as the "Second chain,'' and by an oyster shell reef, designated as "Ayre' s reef," through which a four-feet channel has been opened by the State. The small islands composing the Second chain arc mostly covered with lignum vitre and mezquit bushes, from six to eight feet high, and in these the smaller varieties of crane have their building place. The bushes are covered with ncstB_ and thronged with cranes all spring and summer, -there being no similar resort for a hundred' miles either way along the coast. Mezq~tit bay is about five miles long, northwest and southeast, and about three miles wide, with an average depth of four feet throughout, and soft muddy bottom. It has direct communication with the Gulf of Mexico through Cedar bayou, into the north end· of which there is but one foot of water, through the bayou about ten feet, and at the Gulf outlet, or south end, about four and a half feet. Its length is three miles, and average width about a hundred and sixty yards. The oysters of this bay are noted as being the best on the coast. Fish are abundant, and to be had at all seasons of the year. The shores of Mezquit bay arc marshy, except on the northwest side, near which lie two islands, with oyster shell ridges, ranging from five to fifteen feet in height, and covered with chaparral. It is separated from Aransas bay by the cluster of islands called the ''Third chain'' and by two oyster shell reefs. Through these the State has opened a channel of four feet. Aransas bay is about twenty miles long from N.NE. to S.SW., and· of an average width of about six miles. About five miles from the north end lies an oyster shell reef, called "Long reef," which extends across the bay, from St. Joseph's island to Lamar. This is bare in several places, forming islands much subject to change in outline and extent by the action of the waves during the prevalence of the summer winds. There are several channels through the reef, two of which are nearly a quarter of a mile wide, with six feet water; and that is about the average depth of the bay north of the reef. South of Long reefthe bay is open and free from obstructions, with an average depth of ten to twelve feet, and soft, muddy bottom, excepting near the shell reefs and shores. The beach is composed of hard sand, and the bottom, out to a depth of five feet, is of the same character, except in a locality about eight miles from Lamar, whe1·e it is rocky, a remarkable bed of natural concrete being developed there. At the bluff the formation is six feet in thickness above the surface of the water, and appears to extend about ten feet below it. I have no knowledge of any similar formation along the coast, except in the high prairie back of Copano bay, near the mouth of the Aransas river, the bed there being entirely above the level of the bay; and in Laguna Madre, about thirty miles southward of Corpus Christi bay, in which instance the formation is said to be who1ly below the water level. The rock in question has been used in building walls and chimneys at St. Mary's. While in place it is soft and easily cut, but after exposure to the atmosphere it becomes as hard as ordinary limestone. The color is a dirty white, and the fracture irregular. From the point at which the rock occurs a sand-flat ranges northward along the northwest shore of the bay, covered to a depth of five or six feet with ''turtle grass.'' Large numbers of green turtle are caught here, and shipped t.o New Orleans during the spring and summer. There are occasional beds of oysters throughout the bay, and an abundance of fish of all the varieties that inhabit tlie Gnlf.

Aransas l:Jay connects with the Gulf of Mexico through Aransas Pass, which is said to lie subject to changes in depth at the bar and in the channel. During last winter and spring there was an average of more than eight and a half feet over the bar at low water, as we were informed by the pilot. At the close of the working season in June arrangements were in progress for running a line of steamers from the bay to New Orleans or Mobile. The communication with Corpus Christi bay is through a narrow and crooked channel between islands and mud fiats for about five miles, called Corpus Christi lrnyou. Its natural depth is about four feet, but a channel to admit vessels drawing six feet has been opened by a private company. The entrance to Copano bay, between Live Oak Point and Lamar, is over a mile in width. Lap reef, much of which is bare, lies at the west side of the entrance, but there is a channel nine feet deep leading through it into Copano bay. This entrance forms what is known as "Lamar harbor,'' a space of about six miles in area, over much of which there is a depth of twelve feet water, with soft. bottom. The harbor is sheltered either by reefs that are nearly or quite bare, or by land, on all sides. The shores of Aransas bay are low on the south and east. On the north a chain of small islands divides it from St. Charles bay; and on the 11ortlnrnst side stretches Live Oak peninsula, with its high sand bluffs and hillP., some of which are fifty or sixty feet high, and covered with a scattered growth of live-oak and other trees, and an undergrowth of many kinds of bushes and vines. The Mustang grape, a native of the soil, aud from which is made a very fine flavored wine, grmvs here in abundance. Fresh water is plenty, but the range for cattle on the peninsula is not good. There arc at present but four families living on it, within an area of fifty square miles. The town of Lamar lies between the outlets of St. Charles and Copano bays. St. Charks bay is about nine miles long north and south, by about a mile in average width. A nan-ow, crooked channel affords about two and a half feet of water into it, but after the main part of the bay is reached the depth increases to four, and in some places as much as eight feet. Cavasso creek, coming in about six miles up, on the west side, and Salt creek, at the head of the bay, are merely drains for the rain water which falls on the adjacent prairie. ln tbe dry season their beds are filled with salt water from the bay. The shores of the bay are mostly marshy, but at many points the marsh is interrupted by prairie bluff of eight feet or more in height. .A.long the east side stands a body of wood known as ''The Black Jacks.'' The soil there is sandy, and the general surface marked by numerous hills, as at the Sand Mounds, at Lamar, and on Live Oak peninsula, and by fresh water springs and ponds. In all 01.her localities within my knowledge along the coast of Texas there is no fresh water below the surface except immediately along the Gulf shore, on sandy islands. In many other placea I have dug, but always found the water salt, ~s in the Gulf. Oopano bay is about fifteen miles long from northeast to southwest, and about seven miles wide. It is divided nearly across the middle by an oyster shell reef called "Copano reef,'' around the south end of which passes a channel of nine feet at an average stage of water, and that depth may be carried to the head of the bay during the ordinary summer tides. There are other obstructions to navigation throughout the bay to be developed in the progress of the hydrographic work. Copano creek empties into tho northeast end of the bay; Mission river through Refugio Mission bay, on the northwest side; and Aransasriver at the western angle of the bay. All these are inconsiderable streams, there being no more than one foot of water leading into them from the bay. The shores are mostly high, and along the north and west

328

HEPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

shores, except near Mission or Refugio bay, the prairie fronts the water-line .as a bluff, rising from fifteen to thirty feet high. That portion between the Aransas and Mission rivers is wooded; the rest is prairie, with occasional spots of timber in view. The southeast shore of Capano bay is formed by Live Oak peninsula, and is marshy along the water-line, but a short distance back rise the high sand ridges and prairie that characterize these localities. The two towns, Copano and St. Mary's, the former one of the earliest settlements made in this part of Texas, lie on the northwest side of the bay, and are still but small villages. The land s;eems to be valued only for grazing, although sea-island cotton and corn have beeii successfully cultivated in small tracts. Puerto bay is a ,;mall arm exten<ling from the southwest corner of Copano bay, about five miles in a southwest direction. The entrance to it is shallow, and the depth inside is only four or five feet. The shores are generally low and marshy. A small creek, which is merely a surface drain, discharges at the head of the hay. R(fugio bay is about three miles across in either direction, and is very shallow. The climate of this part of the coast of Texas is generally considered very healthy, and the quarter is frequently resorted to by persons who have become sickly from residence on the alluvial bottoms along the rivers. The temperature during January and February of the past winter averaged about 56° Fahrenheit, the lowest being 28° for a few hours only toward8 the close of a "norther," which lasted three days. During March and April it was about 70°; and for :May and June, which are said to be the hottest months of the year, the average was 84°. The highest temperature recorded was 91° on the 27th of May. There is almost a constant breeze from the Gulf day and night after the middle of April.

Tabl.es for projecting maps ef large f,:dent, arranged by J. E. Hugard, Assistant U. S. O. S.
These tables are based upon a polyconic development of the earth's surface, which supposes each parallel of latitude to be represented on a plane by the development of a cone having the parallel for its base and its vertex in the point where a tangent to the parallel intersects the earth's axis. The degrees on the parallel preserve their true length, and the general distortion of area is less than in any other geometrical mode of representing a given portion of the earth's surface. Denoting by a the equatorial radius of the spheroid, e the eccentricity, then the normal to any point on the parallel of latitude L, produced to the minor axis, is

The radius of curvature in the meridian is
a(J-e2) a Rm= (1 - efl sin 2L) 2

The radius of the parallel, RP = N cos L. The radius of the developed parallel, or the side of the tangent cone, r = N cot L. Designating by n any arc of the parallel, or difference of longitude to be developed, and by 0 the corresponding angle subtended by the developed parallel at the vertex of the cone, then the length of the given arc will be n RP= n N cos L, and also Or= {} N cot L whence {} n sin L. To determine the rectangular co·ordinates x and y for projecting from the middle meridian the points of intersection of the meridians and parallels, we have simply, the developed parallels being arcs of circles, x r sin fJ, y r versin fJ. Table I gives the length, in metres, of one degree of latitude and longitude for each degree of latitude from 0° to 54°; also the radii of the developed parallels which may be used to describe the parallels by means of beam compasses when the scale permits. It also gives the values of {} for 10° of longitude, by means of which the tables may readily be extended. Table II gives the co-ordinates for thirty degrees of longitude on each parallel from latitude 1° to 54°. The numbers correspond to the actual dimensions of the earth in metres, and are to be divided by the proper number for any desired scale. In order to project a map by the aid of these tables draw a straight line as middle meridian of the map, on which space off the required degreeR of latitude by the values given in Table I. Through the points so marked construct lines perpendicular to the meridian and parallel with each other, which will be tangents to the parallels of latitude at their intersections with the middle meridian. On these tangents lay off from the middle meridian, for each required longitude, the corresponding x from the table\!, and off-set y perpendicular to it, towards the pole. Through the points so found draw continuous curves for the parallels and meridians. The tables are based on the following constants, being Bessel's latest, and those used in the Coast Survey: 6. 80464346 Equatorial radius of the earth· · · · · · · a = 6 377 397 metres, log.

Description of an apparat1is devised b.IJ Assistant W. P. Trowbr_idge, and of the method o/ applying it in determining ocean depths and obtaining specirnens of bottom.-(Sketch No. 40.)
U.
DEAR S. COAST SrrRVEY OFFICE,

April 6, 1859.

Sm: In my report to you of May 31, 1858, I had the honor of presenting the results of an investig~tion of the laws of descent of heavy bodies in the ocean, under the conditions required in deep-sea sounding. The object of that investigation was to ascertain and develop fully the causes of failure and error in deep sounding8, and to devise a more certain and reliable mode of measuring the depth of the ocean in the off-shore hydrography of the Coast Survey, and especially in the swift current of the Gulf Stream. I have now to present for your further consideration a sounding apparatus based upon the developments given in my former report, and the result of further study and experiments on the subject. The distinguishing feature of the method herein described, though exceedingly simple in its application, has never before been proposed, inasmuch as its necessity could hardly have been felt without a careful analysis of the circumstances of descent of the sounding lead and line. In the method of sounding heretofore employed, the influence of the friction of the water upon the line, or '' endwise resistance,'' as it is called by Prof. Airy, was known to exist, but the amount of this endwise resistance in pound8, and its ultimate effects at great depths, had not been determined. It was supposed that by making use of a weight of thirty or forty pounds and a small fishing line, this resistance would be reduced to an inappreciable amount, or at least that its effect in retarding the descent of the lead would not be sufficient to destroy confidence in the results. It appears, however, from the investigations referred to, that a weight, such as is ordinarily used in sounding, will be practically held in suspension at no very great depth, even when the line used is the smallest that will sustain the weight with safety in the air; and, in confirmation of this conclusion, the fact is well established that, notwithstanding repeated experiments made by the most skilful officers and with the utmost care, the bottom of the ocean has never been reached in its deepest parts ; and even where the bottom has been attained, arid specimens brought to the surface, the uncertainties of the results have given good grounds for controversy with regard to the depth. These failures and uncertainties do not arise from the magnitude of the distance to be measured, nor from the impenetrability of the fluid through which the lead has to pass. Distances infinitely great and infinitely small in the universe, above and around us, have been measured with precision, and the unexplored depths of the ocean are occupied by a medium freely and equally penetrable at all depths. Yet, in this field-a field daily traversed by the commerce of the world-a distance of a few miles only has baffled all attempts to measure it. The diftic'lllty lies in the simple ca.use stated above, viz: the "endwise resistance," or friction upon thif sounding line, which prevents the lead from going to the bottom where the depth is great. The appar&tW!I which I have devised is designed to avoid this friction upon the line, while at the same time the line is not dispensed with, but is made use of as in the ordinary mode.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Before describing this apparatus, I will briefly refer to some of the results given in my previous report on this subject. The rate of descent of an iron globe or sphere, as the simplest geometrical form, was first determined when falling freely in the ocean, and it was found that a sphere will attain a certain maximum velocity within twenty-five feet of the surface, which velocity will be kept up without sensible increase or diminution to the bottom. For a 32-pound iron shot this uniform velocity is about sixteen feet per second. _ The conditions of descent when a small line is attached to the sphere and drawn down with it were then discussed, the line being uncoiled from a reel on the deck of the vessel, and drawn down by the weight of the sphere. The friction of this line in the water causes a remarkable change in the rate of descent. Nearly the same maximum velocity at sttirting is obtained, but the velocity becomes rapidly reduced until the sphere becomes sul:lpended nearly motionless in the water. Taking the simple case af a 32-pound shot attached to a small fishing line, the shot attains its maximum velocity of sixteen feet per second within twenty-five feet of the surface; but before a hundred fathoms of the line is drawn into the water this velocity is reduced to eight feet per second-a diminution of half the velocity from the friction of one hundred fathoms of line. At five hundred fathoms the velocity is again reduced half, or to four feet per second; and at three thousand, to about one foot per second; where.as at this d,epth, if there is no line attached, the shot wil,l fall with its origintil velocity q/ sixteen feet per seoond undiminuihed. Below this depth we may determine iu the same way the circumstances in the two cases; the shot falling freely still retains its uniform velocity of sixteen feet per second at four, five, and six thousand fathoms depth; while with the line attached, at five thousand fathoms the velocity is reduced to a few inches per second, and at six thousand fathoms the descent is not perceptible under ordinary circumstances. The time of descent becomes an important element also in practice. In the tV'to cases given the shot falling freely will descend to the depth of three thousand fathoms in twenty minutes, and to the depth of six thousand fathoms in forty minutes; while, with the line attached, it will require two hours to descend three thousand fathoms, and eight hours to descend six thousand fathoms. These effects were shown to be due to the friction alone; the amount of which in pounds was determined for different cases in which different forms of weight and different sizes of lines were used; and the entire inapplicability of the ordinary mode of sounding for great depths, and even for ordinary depths, where tbe object is to obtain a correct knowledge of the depths, was demonstrated. Methods have been pToposed in which a line is dispensed with by detaching a float at the bottom when the plummet strikes, and watching for the return of the float to the surface; but this is impracticable, as there is no material applicable, within our knowledge, that will float to the surface from the bottom of the sea, on account of the great pressure which condenses the bulk, so as to render bodies specifically lighter than water at the surface heavier than water at even moderate depths. A line must therefore be used to bring back to th~surface, any machine by which the depth may be registered in the descent, and the motion of this line in an extended form in the water must be avoided. The apparatus which I have devised is designed to secure this object by attaching to the sinker a tube or case in which the sounding line is compactly coiled, a.nd from which it will be

discharged freely, thus causing .the plummet to carry down the coil, while one end of the line is held fast at tho surface; the line being uncoiled from the descending sinker, in the manner that a spider falling from a height gives out a thread in his des~eot by which he retains communication with the point above to which the threaJ is attached. The motion of the line in an extended form through the water being thus avoided, all the conditions of free descent are secured, and the plummet will descend to the greatest depths with a rapid and uniform velocity. The depth is ascertained in the manner heretofore known as Massey's method, by a helix or curved blade, which is caused to revolve by the motion of the apparatus through the water. Instead of Massey's Indicator, however, which from its faulty construction does not give accurate results, I have adapted Saxton's Current ~fetre, a much more delicate instrument, to this purpose. A specimen tube is also used, differing somewhat from those now in use in construction, but not in its essential points. The lower end of the line is attached to the register and to the specimen box, which weigh together only two or three pounds; and as the line is hauled in from the bottom it brings up the register and specimen box, leaving the plummet and attached case at the bottom. The details of construction are shown in the accompanying drawings and description of the apparatus. Besides overcoming the principal difficulty in sounding, there are other important advantages secured by this arrangement which simplify rather than complicate the problem. These are as follows: First. There is no strain upon the line in the descent, except from its own weight, no matter to what depth or with what velocity the plummet may descend. It is possible, therefore, to employ a very small line; a single thread of silk may, in fact, bf' extended to the bottom of the ocean. This permits of the use of a line which may be coiled compactly within a small space, the strength of the line being made just sufficient to insure its being hauled in with safety, bringing up at the same time the specimen box and the register. The strain brought upon it in hauling in will depend upon the velocity of the upward motion, which may be regulated accordingly. Secondly. .A. rapid and uniform des0ent being secured, the indications of a revolving register will be reliable when attached to this plummet, while in the present mode of sounding the slow motion of desc.eut at great depths renders such a mode of registering the depth uncertain and unreliable. Thirdly. There being no strain upon the line in the descent, and the motion being uniform, it is practicable to determine the depth by the time of descent, making use of a small insulated wire as a sounding line, and determining the instant that the weight strikes the bottom by an electrical signal transmitted through the line. An apparatus was devised as long smce as the year 1845, for ascertaining the moment when the weight strikes the bottom by elel}tricity, but in the mode of sounding heretofore employed no particular advantage would result from this, while the danger of breaking the electric continuity is very great, owing to the strain brought upon the line in the descent; and the plummet as now used descends with such a varying velocity that even with the time of dellcent given no calculation will give the depth. The method has, therefore, never been put in practice. Whereas, in the method proposed, there is no strain upon the line in its descent, and the plummet will fall through each 1:mccessive 46

hundred fathoms in the same time ; the, time <f deJJcent will thua furnish a simple mea118 f!f' cal.ciilating the depth. In this process it will not be necessary to recover the line, and the time required to sound the ocean at any point need only be that required for the plummet to sink to the bottom, moving with any velocity which may be desired. I have made many experiments on the best method of coiling the line so as to secure its uncoiling with certainty, and without the possibility of a strain upon the line or the occurrence of a kink. I have also given much attention to the ·quality and size of the line to be used. Upon these points the practical working of the apparatus in a certain degree depends, but being merely mechanical questions they are easily settled. They are fully discussed in the description which accompanies the drawings. The importance of the problem which is thus sought to be solved, ~n connection with the survey of the coast, bas never been questioned; a knowledge of the configuration of the bottom of the sea adjacent to the coast is necessary to the solution of many questions of importance to navigation and to science, and especially that of the ruling foature of the Atlantic Coast, the Gulf Stream; but besides these considerations the question bas become one of great public interest in connection with the laying of submarine telegraphs, the risks of such enterprises being diminished in proportion to the accuracy with which the depth of the sea is known at every point of any proposed line, and the ultimate practicability of such operations across the Atlantic being yet to be demonstrated by new and more accurate soundings.

retarding force to the descent from the line itself. Any desired velocity of descent may be. given to the plummet by increasing or decreasing the weight W. Fig 1 a shows the method of c.oiling the line. There are various modes of doing this which are in common practice m twine and cotton factories; that which is here exhibited is the method of coiling in balls, all the balls exhibited in the tube being formed of one unbroken line, the line drawing out from the centre of each, until it is all drawn from the tube. The machinery for winding these balls is very simple. The essential points in the coiling are to coil the line in as compact a space as possible, so as to insure certainty of discharge without danger of kinking. Two other modes of coiling are now under consideration, either of which may be better than the method by balls. One is to wind upon a spindle, and the other to lay the line iu a sort of compound coil, directly in the tube. All these methods are now practiced in the factories on a large scale for winding twine and cotton. The lino used should be about five hundredths of an inch in diameter, and as strong as it can be made of that 11ize. A braided line of Holland ilax or silk of five hundredths of an inch in diameter may be made to bear a strain of forty or fifty pounds, which is abundantly strong for the purpose, as the weight and case are left at the bottom, the register and specimen tube only being brought up.

Tube.
The tube may be made of tin in sections of eighteen inches in length, with stove-pipe joints and bayonet fastenings. The object of this is to adapt the length of the tube readily to the amount of line which it is to contain. A tube four inches in diameter will contain nearly a mile of line to each foot of the tube.

Sinker and specimen tube.
The sinker is made of cast iron or lead of any desired weight, depending upon the desired velocity of descent. A weight of twenty-five pounds has been adopted. The sinker is conical and is inserted into the lower end of the tube containing the line and fastened to this tube by screws or by a bayonet joint and fastening. The weight has a conical hole or cavity through its entire length, through which the small specimen tube passes in the manner shown in the drawing. The specimen tube is a tube of thin brass passing through the weight and attached to the lower end of the line within the large tube. This specimen tube is .fitted with a valve open· ing upwards in the bottom, which closes when the tube is drawn up, thus retaining the mud which is forced into the tube when the weight strikes bottom. The specimen tube fits loosely in the bottom of the weight so that it may be easily drawn out as the line is hauled in.

Cap.
The cap ie used for two purposes: to contract the upper end of the tube containing the line so that the line cannot rise in bulk out of the tube, and for supporting the register. It is formed in the shape of the frustum of a cone, cut away on one side as well as open at the top, so as to a.llow the line to be discharged freely. A flat strap is fastened to the top of the frustum nearly in the line of the a.xis of the tube, and upon this strap the register is set, as shown in the drawing; the register is kept in its place by loose collars.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Register.
The apparatus for measuring the depth consists of a helix or curved blade attached to a vertical axis, and wheels gearing into an endless screw upon this axis. The revolutions of the helix, caused by the motion through the water, are communicated to the wheels, which are graduated so as to indicate the number of revolutions of the helix. Two registers are attached to one plummet by attaching them together in the manner shown in figure 2, by means of brass plates. The blades are made to turn in opposite directions, and will operate as chocks upon each other, and also counteract the effect of any rotary motion in the plummet. The construction of the blades and wheels and the mode of gearing them with the endless screw are shown in figure 3. The wheels are differential wheels; that is,. they are concentric, one of them having one hundred teeth and the other one hundred and one teeth. The cross bar (b) has a slight motion, carrying with it the wheels; this motion is governed by a spring s. To gear the wheels the cross bar is pressed towards the endless screw until the teeth gear with that screw and the bar is there locked, as shown in figure 2 at gg. The revolution of the blades will now cause both wheels to turn, and after one hundred revolutions the wheels will be found separated by one tooth or one division. The differences thus measure hundreds of· revolutions. In the register from which the drawings were made, the blades revolve once in two feet; one hundred revolutions will therefore correspond to two hundred feet, or one division of the scale of the register to thirty-three fathoms. When the register is hauled up, the arms at gg, figure 2, drop, and the springs cause the wheels to ungear and :fly back, where t~ey arc held motionless by a projecting point at n, figure 3. The arms are made to drop by means of a small wire, which is attached to the cap, as shown at (u,) figure 1. This wire is fastened to, or hooks over the ends of the arms, and when the register is drawn off, the arms fall.

Mode of attaching the lir..e to the register and specimen tube.
Before the line is put into the tube it is attached to the specimen tube at a point four or five feet from the end of the line, the spare end is passed through the tube, and when the balls are all put in the tube the extreme end of the line coming out at top is attached to the register, after taking a few turns around the top of the strap, the register being in its place. The line is thus attached to the specimen tube and register only, and not to the large tube_ or weight. When the plummet strikes the bottom a part of the line will remain in the tube coiled ; by hauling in the line this part will, however, be uncoiled, and on coming to the bottom of the coil the specimen tube will be drawn up through the large tube, and after the specimen tube comes out the register will be drawn off the strap, and thus the large tube and weight will be disengaged from the line, specimen tube, and register, and by continuing to haul in, the register and specimen tube will be brought to the surface. The plummet on striking will, under most circumstances, remain sticking in the mud in an upright position. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. P. TROWBRIDGE,

BOSTON, August 30, 1859. Srn: * * * Eelow are given the results of eighty observations made with the pressure tide-metre when the bag, tube, and guage were filled with air. The mean differences and error are also shown, but it is probable that the actmil error is less than the result given in the column so designated, as the greatest difference occurred when the surface of the water was agitated, and the least when it was most calm. To determine the effect produced by the escape of air, the bag was fully distended, and immersed to the depth of thirteen feet, and the position of the index noted. The instrument was then taken up and one-half of the air allowed to escape from the bag, but on being again immersed to the same depth the index remained as before. No observations were made with reference to temperature, as the change of volume of the air from this cause would be very slight as compared with the distended and half-filled bag.

" higher, as in the tenth line. The intermediate observations would be equally accurate if the dial-plate of each instrument was graduated by marking the position of the index at each successive tenth of a foot immersed, beginning with a depth of not less than three or four feet. The bag, when in use, should always be at this depth below low-water mark. The differences noted at the same depth of immersion (column nine) are mainly due to oscillation of the water, and in a very slight degree to friction of the index gear.

Srn: I feel too deeply indebted for the sympathy and hearty co-operati,;m manifested by you while attached to the Coast Survey to permit the occasion which returns you to general duty in the naval service to pass without expressing my sense of the value of your labors. Apart from the devotion shown as one of the naval assistants, it is natural to suppose that your early experience in the work gave enhanced interest to your later efforts, and I cannot but regard the long period of your co-operation in the survey as one of the happy incidents of my superintendence. The large share which you have contributed to the hydrographic results of the Coast Survey would alone permanently associate your name with that national work. Those with whom you have acted will have also in memory the ready spirit for co-operation, the uniform courtesy, and the qualities of head and heart that never fail in contributing to success. Receive, my deoc sir, the assurance that my kind wishes will ever accompany you to whatever field of duty you may be called in the range of your profession. Yours, respectfully and truly, A. D.

Where so many arc employed, relative merits and special efficiency can be per· ceived and appreciated only by one charged with the general superintendence; and in that light it is now a pleasure to say that your labors in the prosecution of the hydrography must ever rank in my estimation as of the highest order. Your career during the extended period of your service, and since your recent assignment to Coast Survey duty, was marked by that

rare aptitude and intelligence in regard to the work which assist in planning, and by perseverance which left nothing to be desired in reference to the time of its execution. A comparison shows that in hydrographic results your efforts have been seldom if ever excelled by those of any other officer. The high estimation in which I have regarded them would be weakened by specification in addressing one so fully qualified for the widest range of duty in the naval profession. A.s nothing has occurred throughout the long period of your connection with the Coast Survey to stay the increasing regard won by your even courtesy and manly bearing, my regret in taking leave of you is the greater. I shall ever recur to your name as one of the most efficient of naval assistants of the Coast Survey with feelings of pride and pleasure. Yours, respectfully, A. D. BACHE, Superinknde.nt U. S.
