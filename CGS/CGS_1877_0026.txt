REPORT.

CO.A.ST SURVEY OFFICE,

D. C., December 20, 18i7. SIR: I have the honor to report herewith the progress made in the survey of the A tlantfo, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States during the year ending Jnne 30, 18ii. The allotment of parties is shown in geographical order in the A11pendix No. 1, which mentions the localities and the class of work done in 4'\acb. With the reduced appropriation it was inexpedient to retain all the force heretofore employed ill field-work and hydrography, but the ad\·ance made in the work has be{'n commensurate with the means, and the results are highly satisfactory. In one or another of its branches work has been continued in each of the sea·board States of the Union, exclusirn of the determination of geographical points in several of the interior States. But this distribution, wide as it has heen, left untouched much work designated in special calls that could uot be met for want of meaus. H has been necessary to balance closely between requireme11ts so as to meet as many as possible with the limited amount which would not suffice for all. This condition has been a subject of special regret. After reducing tile force an1l fixed expenses to tile lowest limit consistent with effilliency the amount left for :field-operations was inadequate to maintain constant activity. As already explained in a separate communication addressed to the department, the cost of placing a party in the field, and the cost of taking it out of the field, is the same in amount whether the working season be long or short. Frequently it has been necessary to discharge hands after a short season, and when a small additional sum would have told largely ou the progress of the work without increasing the unavoiJable expenses. In the course of the year all parts of the Atlantic coast were swept by gales of unusual force, and storms were uncommonly frequent in the Gulf of Mexico. The vessels used in the ser\'ice are genemlly small, and of necessity sultject to all the hazards of the sea, but it is gratifying to record that in the pai;t season, although several were in great peril, no vessel belonging to the Surve,y has bet>n lost. Of the only three instances that stand in the records of former years as sad exceptions, one in 18!6 involved loss of life, including the commander, and part of his crew, and damage to the vessel. By a collision off the coast of New Jersey, in 1860, one of our steamers was sunk and lost with twenty of the crew. In 1851 a small steamer intended for h,rdrographic work on the wel5tern coast was shattered in a hurricane off the coast of Patagonia, but since that date no vessel employed in the survey has been damaged in any storm beyond the reach of repairs. In October, 18i6, one of the schooners was injured by a heavy gale on the coast of Maine, and another by a violent storm near Sandy Hook in the following December. The incidents in these cases will be more particularly referred to in describing the work in which the parties were then engaged. In Indian Rivt>r, Florida, in October, 1876, the small Yessel there employed was saved only bj- great efforts, though the violence of the hurricane was such as to carry away all the signals that bad been erected, and, by the lashing of the waves, even the ground that held most of them. The steamer engaged in sounding along the eastern coast of Florida encountered heavy storms, and upwards of twenty gales are noted in the records of the hydrographic party that passed the season in running lines of soundings in the Gulf of Mexico. As no year bas passed without a recurrence of severe storms alo11g our Atlantic sea-board, the meteorological conditions which precede and attend them have been judged as subjects of inqniry likely to yield information of great importance in the interests of na\"igation. The operations of laws recognized as general in regard to the motions of the atmosphere ha,-e been ably discussed by Mr. William Ferrel, of the Coast Sarvey, aud the inference is ready that however 01· whernver the S.Ex.12-1

cyclones here referred to may arise, the exceptional disturbance must soon become su~ject to some general law, or at leaRt he modified by such law. The great range of storms of this character adds to the proballility of the inference. The inquiry is new, the end is important, and 1<0 far as the sulucct has been pnrsned there is no reason to doubt that the discussion will develop principles which may yield knowledge in advance respecting the direction of storms and their rate of motion. The leading part of Mr. _Ferrel's discussion was given in tlle Appendix (No. 20) of my rt>port for the year 18i5. Another subject of interest to navigators, and of which the study has been unavoidably postponed, was entered upon in June last. The tidal-currents of the open sea were then for the first time observed with success, and their characteristics recorded at stations on which soundings gave depths of more than one hundred fathoms. The great importance of results already derived from these observations will be explained nuder a separate head before closing the introductory p,art of this report. Of scarcely less consequence than the soundings on charts, which result from the labors of the hydrographic parties, are the compasses denoting tlle variation of the magnetic needJe. Jn fact the course at sea is paramount in importance when the navigator is not in the vicinity of rocks or shoals. But at sea onJy approximate results can be bad, and observations to the degree of exactness requisite for determining the laws controlling the variation of the compass cannot be made; hence, of necessity, the knowledge needful for developing its peculiarities has depended entirely upon observations ma.de on land. These, moreover, must record the magnetic c-0nditions at many points, imd if practicable the stations should lle distributed over the entire continent. Our extensi rn coasts are traversecl at different angles by the curves of equal magnetic declination, and to project the lines out to sea, the curves on land must be determined with precision. The variation of the compass claime<l attention at the outset of the survey, and no opportunity bas been lost for acquiring information on the subject. All known records of magnetic variation near the Atlantic coast since the year 16!9, and of the variation stated subi,;equently for other points as settlemcuts spread over the continent of North America., have been carefully collated aud ui,;ed for discussion. While some of the earl,v notes are now known to have been much in error, others were found to be less so. All observations recorded within the la.st forty years and accepted for di8CU8sion in the Office of the Ooast Survey are trustwortlly. When consistent with each other in respect of date and measure of variation, even the early and imperfect observations become important in a series, being confirmed by the law that has been deduced in recent years frolll observations of which the validity is unquestionable. Frolll these last it is well known that the compass-needle pointed truly to the north in the year 1875 in the immediate vicinity of Oape Fear; and that about the year 1800 the same was true at some point about one hundred and seventy-five miles distant, in a straight line, or near Chincoteague, on the coast of Virgima, where the compass-needle now points three degrees and three-quarter8 west of north. These general facts and others concerning the varying rate of chauge in the deviation of the needle at various localities, as developed by successive discussions within the last twenty years at the Coast Survey Office, have been made known in several of the annual report.-.. In a system of lines passing through places on a map of the United States, at which places the compass had the same variation, little, much, or nothing in the year 1875, the line marked zero, and along which there was no variation of the compass-needle in that year, would pa.':!s from the east end of Lake Superior across the continent in a southeast direction, and, as before istated, would cross the coast at Uape F~ar. North of that cape, lines marking successive degrees of weisterly variation would converge in passing inland from the coast. South of Cape Fear, and so on westward t-0 San J<'ra.ucisc-0 and then north ward to and beyond Sitka, in Alaska, the successive lines would mark easterly variation, and the lines themselves would converge in passing towards the magnetic pole in British America. As the line of no variation shifted from Chincoteague southward to Cape Fear in seventy-five years aud is still passing to the southward, it will be readily seen that the entire s,vtStem ofJines marking westerly and easterly variation along the Atla.ntic coast was eorre8poudingly shifted, and that they are all passing southward. But on the Pacific coast the lines of easterly variation are also passing southward, just as westerly lines do on the Atlantic coast, aud eonsisoontly it is noticeable that one of the lines pass-

ing through Mexico, and along which the variation is easterly, has remained for some years without change. Assistant Hilga.rd suggests that if the stability of the variation along that Jine continues northward to the magnetic pole, the fact that everywhere east and west of it the variation is increasing, would seem to imply a southerly movement of the magnetic pole itself. At present that pole is near the Arctic circle in a region near the meridian of Omaha. From this condition it results for the Atlantic coast that wherever the variation is westerly, the westerly variation is increasing, and as the easterly variation is !liminishing on the coast of our Southern States, that on lines expressing but little easterly variation the variation must soon become westerly. On tl1e I>adfic com;t, however, at all points above the peninsula of Lower Ualifornia the easterly variation is still increasing. In the determination of the magnetic elements the hydrographic parties cannot co-operate. By the field-parties and in former years, as incirlental to the work in which they were engaged, the variation of the magnetic needle has been aseertained at upwards of four hundred stations. The results are of great value and were procured without any cost as additional to that of the field-work which was at the same time in hand. Alread,r their discussion has served for generalizing tile lines of equal magnetic variation and for pointing out positions at which observations will bear systematically towards greater accuracy in drawing the series of lines for succe."sfre years in the future. At the close of June an observer was assigued to this special duty, and with suitable instruments the summer was passed in occupying stations which had been previously indicated. The details of the work will he given in my next aunual report. Disputes ahont land-boundariei,;; frequentl,v involve questions in regard to the compass-bearings in earlier times. For some years inquiries of that kind have been referred to the Coast Sur>ey Office, and the needed information is promptly given. The calls even from interior States are increasing in frequency. It is therefore fortunate that,, in addition to records of the variation gathered from the incidental labors of the field-parties, and which have yielded much information in regard to the secular chauge between certain dates, early means were taken for ascertaining the laws that govern the earth's magnetism. For their successive study it is requisite to keep up, at a few selected places, continuous observations of the phenomena, and this is most conveniently done by automatic registration. Such observations are maintained in the British Dominions at certain points in both hemispheres. On the pa.rt of the Coast Survey they were formerly made in \Vashington City in co-operation with the Smithsonian Institution, but before the series \\'as far advanced an emergency arose for moving the apparatus to Key 'Vest, where observations vrnre continned during six years, a period which is the least for deriving the laws that govern at any given locality. The particulars concerning the Key ·west station were given at length in Appendix No. 9 of m~· annual report for the year 1874. At a point far distant the magnetographs formerly used at Key West were again pnt in operation within the year. The new station is at Ma.dison, Wis. In pursuance of an arranl-{ement with the authorities of the Stare University a suitable underground building was established b.v that institution. The instruments are to be maintained in running Ol'der at the extiense of the Coast Sur. yey in accordance with terms arranged by Assistant Hilganl with the authorities. Assistant C. A. Schott has been charged with the duty of securing efficiency in the operation of the instruments. To that end he will in the present fiscal year· personally visit the station, adjust the instruments, and determine their scale values. The readings of the photographic traces, their tabulation, and the.computations and discussions connected with them will also be in his care. The magnetic observatory will be in the local charge of Prof. J. E. Davies, of the State Uuiversit~· of Wfaconsin. As forming part of the establishment at Madison, the difforential observations near there will be checked and supplemented annuall.v by observations of the absolute measure of the declination, the dip, and the intensity of the magnetic force. · It is in contemplation, when means are available, to establish thre.e similar observatories, one to the westward of Madison and two upon the western coast. Many advantages would result from the simultaneous study of magnetic observations made with delicate instruments at widely distant places. In Appendix No. 7 will be found the pa.rticulars connected with the establishment of the magnetic observatory at Madison.

ESTI11U.TES.

The aggregate of the following estimates which were submitted t-0 the department in October last, although greater than the amount appropriated for the current year, is urgently needed. Resurveys of most important localities, as Long Island Sound, New York Harbor entrance, Delaware Bay and River, and others, in all of which great changes have occurred since the charts were issued, call for a sum in addition to the amount required to maintain the regular progress qf the survey of the coast. The estimates for continuing the survey of the .Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States, during the year ending June 30, 1879, are intended to provide for the following progres::;: FIELD·WORK.-To continue the to1mgraphy of the western shore and islands of Passamaquoddy Bay and its estuaries; of the coast east of Penobsc_ot Bay, towards Narraguagus Bay: and of the shores of the Penobscot, near Bangor; for the determination of heights at some of the principal trigonometrical points between Boston and the Saint Croix, and of co-efficients of refraction; to complete the hydrograpby of Penobscot Bay and River, of Isle au Haut Bay, Blne Hill Bay and Frenchman's Bay, and continue soundings in the coast approaches, eastward of Penobscot Bay; to continue a topographical and hydrogmpbic survey of Portsmouth Harbor; to make such additional triangulation as may be requh1ite for that and other surveys on the eastern coast, and determine ~he position of new light-houses between Eastport,, Me., and N<>w York; to continue soundings along the coast of Maine, and other off-shore bydrography between Cape Cod aud Man an; make special examination for the sailing lines for charts; to continue the obsen·ations of sea aud tidal currents in the Gulf of Maine; to continue tidal observations, and to make such astronomical and magnetic observations as may be required; to oontinue such topographical and hydrographic resurveys of the coast between Cape Cod and New York as may be found necessary; to continue

execute such other hydrographic work as local demands may require; to continue tidal and current observations at the Golden Gate, and observations on the ocean currents aJ.ong the coast of California; to continue the triangulation, topography, and hydrography of the Columbia River; to complete the detailed survey between Cape Sebastian and Crescent City, and off.shore hydrography at Crescent-City reef; to measure a base-line and continue the triangulation of the Strait of Fnca, and the topography and hydrogra}Jhy of Puget Sound and adjacent waters; to continue the triangulation ea.stward to connect the surveys of the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and measuring a ba.se-liue; to continue the reconnaissance of the coasts and islands of Alaska with observations for tides and currents, and to make the requisite astronomical and magnetic observations; to continue the field-work for the description of the coast and verification of the Coast Pilot of the coasts of California, Oregon, and V\Tashington Territory; to continue the organized system of magnetic obsenations required for a complete magnetic survey; and to run lines of levels connecting points in the main triangulations with the sea-level. OFFICE-WORK.-To make the computations from observations recorded in the field, including a."itronomical, geodetic, geographical, magnetic, and tidal observations; to continue the publication of the Coast Pilot of the Pacific coast; to prepare tidal predictions for 1879; to continue the reproduction of the original topographical maps, and to plot the hydrographic surveys; to draw and engrave the additions on the general chart of the Pacific coast of the United States; to continue the drawing and engraving of the charts of the coast from San Diego to Point Concepcion, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3; to continue the engraving of a new chart of San Francisco entrance and harbor from resnn·eys; to continue the drawing and engraving of charts of the coast from Point Arena to Cape l\lendocino, No. 8, of that from Cape Mendocino to Saint George's Reef, No. 9, and of that from Saint George's Reef to the Umpquah River, No. 10, Shoalwater Bay, Puget, and Washington Sounds; to complete the drawing and engraving of the chart of Columbia Hiver to Kalama, and to continue that of the local harbor charts of the coast, with those of the northwestern coast; for material for drawing, engraving, map-printing, for electrotyping, photographing, and· for instruments and apparatus. . Total for the Pacific -0oast, iuvolving work in :live States and Territories, will require $:!75,000. For repairs and maintenance of the complement of vessels used in the Coast Survey will require
$50,000.

For continuing the publication of the observations made in the progress of the Coast Survey will reijliire $10,000. For general expenses of all the work, rent, fuel; for transportation of instruments, maps, and charts; miscellaneous office expenses, and for the purchase of new instruments, books, maps, and chartt1, will require $40,000. At Urn Treasury Department it was deemed inexpedient at this time to vary considerably in estimates for work abo\'e the amounts given in recent appropriations, although larger appropriations had IJccn made in pre,·ious years. Accordingly, in November, the estimates for continuing the work of tLe survey during the next fiscal year were reduced to an amount equal to the appropriation for tJ.ie year ending June 30 1877. The reduced estimates were transmitted to the department with the following remarks: "The estimates submitted in October are such as, in my judgment, after full consideration of the necessities of the work and its economical progress, would best conduce to a completion of the survey in a reasonable period of time. As the work is to be confined to certain limits, and the orgauizatiou of the forct> is thorough, the more rapilll.V it is executed the greater the economy, the less the total cost, and the more quickly will the public have use of the results. . "Eighty per cent. of the amount of the estimates exceeding the appropriation for this year would apply directly to field-work, and would yield as results not less than two and a half times the amount obtained from the present appro1>riation. If the cost of placing a party in the field is $:JOO, and the cost of keeping it at work is $.300 per month, withdrawing it from the field at a cost of $.iOO gh-es an aggregate of $1,500 in one month. Adding to this an additional $1,500 quadruples the amount of field-work by merely doubling the expenditure. Upon these grounds my estimates were su!Jmitted in October. "The appropriation for the current year proves to be entirely inadequate for the work without a radical change in the organization, and tends to loss in economy, and delay in the completion of

chart;s of the coasts. I have therefore, after personal explanation, with your consent and direetion, reduced the estimates from the amounts submitted in October to the amounts which were appropriated for the year endiug June 30, 1877, alter a most careful examination of the work lly a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representati\·es, at the head of both of which was the present Speaker. EY~ the amount then appropriated was a great reduction from prcYious appropriations."
SEA-CURRENTS.

In compiling data for the Coast Pilot the want of information concerning the currents along the outt-;ide coast has been, more than ever before, pressed upon my attention. To obtain such information by systematic inquiry has always been a purpose recognized by the Coast Sun·fl,r, hut from tbe want of suitable vessels, the estimates for which, submitted during se\·eral snccessfre year,;;, were thrown out of the appropriation by Congress until 1876, it has been postponed from time to time. The weather suitable for making good observations far out at sea, or in dangerous proximity to unsbeltere!l shores, it was feared, would be passed before tbe Yessel could reach the destined station; or it would be consumed in the observations themselves, and replaced by a storm, with au anchorage too near a lee shore. I have long been con>incfld that a staunch and carefully equipp('d vessel ought to ride safel,v at anchor anywhere along our coasts in depths less thau one thousand faLhoms, at the proper season, and that the difficulties were exaggerated. Quiet weather aud smooth water are not infrequent at any season, but th('y are of ,;;hort dnrntion, and it is onl,y b,y patient waiting-not iu port but upon the spot where the work is to be executed, through all states of the weather-that success can he assured. When at last, in the appropriation for 1875-'76, Congress included the special sum nect>ssar,r for the purpose, I had the little schooner Drift constructed, with every requirement of a good geaboat, an1l when equipped sent her to sea under command of Acting Master Robert Platt, L. S. :;s-, Assistant Coast Survey, with instructions to lie out at anchor on stations in the Gulf of :\Iaine, iu depths varying from thirty to one hundred and fort.r fathoms, till the 1mrticular project of woek which I had arranged should be completed; returning to port only for supplies. I am happy to say that Acting Master Platt, seconded very earnestly and efficiently b~- Ensign .J. P. Underwood, lias successfully begun this important work, and llis early observations (only hastily examined as yet) give promise that the completed series will be far more important a8 aidis to na,igation, and far more interesting as an addition to our scientific knowledge, than I had anticipated. The completion of the soundings in the Gulf of Maine had brought out upon tbe chart the ex tent and limits of the shoals lying between Nantucket and Cape Sable, which form, in cftcct, a bar or sill at the entrance to the great tidal basin between Massachusetts aml Noya Scotia; all(] Prof. Henry Mitchell, Assistant Coast Survey, who bas special direction of this work, as also that 1Jf the general physical hydrography of the Coast Snrvey, had been able t-0 complete, from the tidill information of the various ports, how much flux and reflux of the sea, in the average, must occur at the bar or sill we have named; but how the velocities making up the average discharges over the sill disposed themsel \'es among the shoals and channels, or how their exact directions or their time,;; of recurrence should be stated, could only be made known by actual observation. If we draw a straight line from Sankaty Head Light pfantucket Island) to Seal Island Light, off the southwest point of Nova Scotia, we find, in a distance of two hundred and eighteen miles, tl1e greatest depth one hundred and forty-five fathoms and the average seventy-eight, giYiug a section of six hundred and twenty-two million square feet. This line lies across the entrance to the Gulf, but it is wit-bin the bar. If, with this line as chord, an arc of a circle of one hundred and thirty-four and a half miles radius be de.scribed, we have a distance of two hundred and fifty-two miles, in which the average depth is but forty-two fathoms, giving for the section three hundred and eight.y-six miJlion square feet, a reduction of thirty-eight per cent. from that of the chord, notwithstanding the greater length. It was this arc, suggt>sted by Professor Mitchell as the sill of the Gulf, that I desigued to have gauged. Actiug Master -Platt's stations, eight in number, will be occupied for periods varying from thirteen to ninet.y-two hours, with observations at less than balfhonr intervals. The stations are as near this arc and as near the proper relative distances upon S. Ex.12-2

it as could be expected of a sailing.vessel. I have no doubt we shall be able to issue tahles, very shortly, by which the navigator may ascertain the velocity and direction of the current on any date and at any hour that he may find himself on this bar or sill. Jn the course of the oh:servations many incidents occurred .to impress the officers of the Drift with the importance of' their work, among others, the. following: Wishing to go from one station to another which lay to windward, the party arranged their time of leaving and their tacks so as to lee bow the tidal current and thus make it do duty in their favor, at the same time observing that a brig, which occasionally came into view, was, from ignorance of the direction of the tidal current, working on an opposite rule antl making no progress whatever; and long after reaching their station-indeed, for a period of thirty-six hours-they observed the brig returning again and again to her original position, when she should, with the knowledge that every sailor on the Drift already possess'ld, have been a hundred miles away on her tme course. Thtise incidents occurred in the neighborhood of George's Shoal, the most formiuable danger in the track of our northeastern coast commerce, marked at that very time by the projecting to11-masts of a vessel whose hull lay buried in the sands bt>low, and whose crew bad probably perished. Acting l\faster Platt reports the existence or recurrence of many violent tide-rips, which will now reeei \·e, for the first time, definite location. He will also, in addition to the sea-current stations along the comparat.ivel;r shallow arc of the Gulf, occupy current-stations along the outer coast of Cape Cod and between Cape Cod and Cape Ann, 80 as to complete the information required for the approaches to the harbors of Boston and Salem, Gloucester, &c. To Prof. H. Mitchell has been assigned the work of' discussing and obtaining final results from the observations made by Acting ::\laster Platt.
CENTENNIAL EXHIBI1'ION.

Among special attractions that distingnishcd the International Exhibition, at Philadelphia, in
1876, from precetling representations of the same kind, was the exhibit on the part of the United

States Government of objects pertaining to the operations and results of its Executive Depart_ ment'3. It is now gratifying to record that the presentation suggestive of the resources and of the value of man.v practical operations in public work was in itself au imposing exhibition,· even when surrounded. by the splendors and profusion which illustrated the industries and luxuries of all the nations of the earth. The requisite authority and provision in part for the governmental exhibit were granted by Congress early in 1875, and when the time approached for opening the Exhibition a government bnildiug erect.et! in the Centennial grounds was partly filled by representative contributions from all the departments excepting the Treasury. The space in the building and the sum allotted to that department for incitlental expenses were found to be inadequate, and at a late day it remained tloubtful whether any exhibit could be made by the Coast Survey or other branches of service under the charge of the Secretary of the Treasury. Hence, although further provision was ac· corded in space and means shortly before the opening, only Jimited preparations at this office could be authorized or completed, the date which restricted the forwartling of articles being then near at hancl. Richard D. Cutts, Assistant in the Survey, who had been one of the United States Commissioners sent to the Vienna Exposition, made the arrangements needful at the Coast Survey Office and at Philadelphia. The articles deemed most suitable for the occasion were !!elected, a descrip· tive catalogue was made, ant! within the space allotted in the government building that officer designated the position which each of the objects was to occupy on its arrival from Washiugt-0n. By the unremitting exertions of General Ontts, and the activity of the mechanicians who acoompanied the packages to Philadelphia, the various articles were in their assigned positions and. ready for inspection 011 the 10th of May, the opening day of the Centennial Ex:hibition. In the space allotted to the Coast Survey were arranged for convenient examination: I. Characteristic specimens of instruments and apparatus employed in the geodetic, astronomical, topographical, and hydrographic operations of the survey, al::Jo for recording the tides and n1agnetic v11riation, aud illustrative of the oruer, cha.ra.cter, and precisiop of the field·work, and adjunct operations. II. Results of the field and hydrographic operations as embodied in three hundred of the

charts and sketches of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the United States, published for the benefit of commerce and navigation. III. Reports and other publications in which th~ methods adopted in the field antl at the office are described and discussed, and which have been published for the advancement of scitonce. IV. A complete set of the standard weights and measures of the United States, including also those of the metric system, and of the balances an<l comparators used in their adjustment at the Office of the Coast Survey. The dl:'scriptive catalogue, preceded by a short historical sketch of the organization of the survey, will be published in the general report of the Centennial Board on behalf of the Execn tive Departments. On the 1st of July, 1876, when all the details connected with the Coast Survey exhibit at Philadelphia, and the accounts for the expenditures incident to the arrangement of the articles were adjusted, General Cutts resumed fteld-work, further mention of which will be m.ade under the head of Section II in this report. He was succeeded at Philadelphia by Assh1tant George W. Dean, who remained in charge of t!Je Coast Survey property there until the close of the Centennial Exhibition. Notwithstanding the uncertainty at the outset and consequent restriction in the time needful for preparation, the expre;ision of iutelligent vb;itors was that this exhibit of articles sent from the office showed evidence of earlyand steady foresight in regard to the requirements of commerce and na\'igation. Several of the most eminent scientific men of Europe after being at Philadelphia passed on to Washington, and in visits at the office cordiall;y re<1ognized its exemplification and results as worthy of a nation which is second to none in most of the practical appliances of life.
OBITUARY.

Since the close of the year, the labors of which will be detailed in this report, the field record has been marked by the unmmels loss of one of the most talented and energetic of the assistants. Franklin Pierce Webber died in bis tent near Woodville, Ala., on the morning of July 25, 1877, in the forty-first year of his age. Through life he had been of robust constitution, and was in the prime of ul:feful powers when seized with remittent fever, which proved fatal in the course of ten days. We deplore the sa<l event, therefore, as a loss somewhat exceptional in the rnortuar,y record of the service. Our deceased associate was a grandson of a former president of Harvard Colll:'gc. His father, an officer of the Army, was in early manhood an intimate friend of the eminent citizen who afterwards became President of the United States. Of a lineage so honorable. Assistant ·webber ably sustained his own degree. He entered the service of the Coast Survey at the age of sevcntL>en, and even then manifested special aptitude as a .computer and astronomical observer. Being by nature methodical and v-ery discreet, be wa-s soon assigned to field· work, and in after ~·ears steadily evinced sound judgment and energy in prosecuting the coast triangulation. Subsequently ~e conducted some im1JOrtant hydrogra.phic surveys, and thus his uame is intimately associated with several classes of work on the Atlantic coast aml Gulf of Mexico. In 1873 Mr. Webber was entrusted with the geodetic operations going westward from the Atlanta base-line t-0wards the Mississippi River. In that responsible work he overcame natural difficulties that to many wouhl have seemed insn1>erable. His own personal exertions in the field doubtless induced the disorder wl1ich terminated fatally. He was earnest, loyal, and sincere towards his associates, and manifested the same "l,;terling quali ties in the conscientious performance of all his public duties.

PAR.T II.
Under the hcmls of sections, beginning at the northeastern boundary on Passamaquoddy Ba;\·, and followi11g the Atlantic coast :rnd Gulf of Mexico to the Rio Graude, separate statements will now be given of the work done in each locality to which a party was assigned in the course of the year ending ,Tune ~10, 18i7. The uotiees will be arranged in geographical orller going southward, but for the Pacilie coast the most southern locality will be mentioued first, and all others in geographical order going nortlnvard. In Lletails relating to the transportation required by field and hydrographic parties, including also the outfit and repair of vess!'ls, the service has had during the year the able co.operation of Commander Edward P. Lull, U. S. N., as hydrogTaphic inspector of the Coast Survey. All original sheets marked with sou111lings are verified under his direction in a<lvance of their acceptance in the office as materials for charts. Commander J,ull was assisted by Lieut. H. E. Nichols, U.S. N., until the 16th of April, when that officer was a<>signed b.v the Navy Dt>partment to service in the Meditem.mean. In .August he was rqilaeed by Lieut. ,V, II. Parker, jr., U. S. N. To tl1e experience of Commander Lull in surveying, his professional skill, readiness in conference, and >igilance in regard to expenditures for outfits and repairs of vesseh, I am indebted for rdief from much anxious care and labor in.bydrographic details.

Coast hydrograplty off Mount Desert Island, Me.-For extending the coast h~·drography to the northward and eastward of Isle au Haut a party was detailed in June.of the present year to work umler the charge of Lieut. J. F. 1\toser, U. S. ~.,Assistant Coast ~urvey, in the steamer Endeavor. After prO\·iding lumber for signals, the vessel left Rockland on tbe :!6rh, and at the close of the fiscal year the party was engaged in a geneml examination of the site of work. The prqjection sent to Lieutt·nant .Moiser will in the course of the summer be filled with soundings recorded in the sea approaehes to l\ionnt Desert falaml, and as pertaining to the work of the present fiscal year the details will be given iu my next annual report. Lieutenant Moser is aided in tl1is section by Masters .T. B. Murdock and F. E. Greene, U. S. N. H,ydrographic operations by the same party will be 8uhjects of mention under Sections II and IV in this report. Hyrlrngraplty of Eggemoggin Reach, Me.-In the work of 11revious Reasons the hydrography of Eggemoggin Reach l1ad been extended from its northern entrance in a direction southward allfl eastward nearly to the mouth of Benjamin lUve~ in the vicinity of the town of Sedgwick~ For completmg the work, Ueut. J. M. Hawley, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Surw·y, sailed from' Boston on th!' 24th of July, 187(), with his party in tbe schooner Earnest. A. few days aftt'r a tidegaug·c was i:;et up 011 Cltatto's Island, Centre Harbor, and by the close of the month tbe party was employed in ereeting signals along the shores of the reach. The steam-launch Sagadahock, after slight repairs at Bangor, ultimately joined the party, and was used for hydrogra.phic sel'vict·. Soun<lings were begun by I1ieulena11t Hawley on the 7th of August, and the work advanced until the middle of Se11temher with favorable weather. The next fortnight was employed by the party a~t Nortl1west. llarbor, Deer Isle, in the development of shoal spots which had been partially sounded hy IAeuteuant Hawley last year. While so engaged a dangerous sunken rock was deYelo!Jed near tile middle of the channel between Eagle Island and Bradbury Island. The depth on the rock ioi ele\·en feet at mean low water. Directions for aYoiding this dangel' were promptly reported by Lieutenant Hawley.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.
The work here under notice WM still in progress on the 9th of October, when Lieutenant Hawley rPcei-..ed directi~ns for sounding a harbor at the lower end of Isle au Haut. The vessel was detained at Brooklin, Me., by fresh gales until the 13th, after wliich date tbe incidents which resulted in great damage to the schooner and imminent peril to her officers and crew will be separatelj- mentioned undt>r the next head. Head Harbor, coa.~t of 1lfaine.-I11 t11e plan of work for last year were included directions for developing the waters at tbe south end of Isle au Haut, and the party sent to that Yiei11ity was accordingly furnisbed with a pr~jeciiou for plotti11g the soundings intended in Bead Harbor. But owing to delays by bad weather at the general working ground the party was constrained to return at the close of the season without entering U}JOn the hydl'Ograph,y at the south end of Isle au Haut. Early in September of the present year urgent re.quest was made by a corporation interested in the shipment of ice for the information needful for passing vessels in and out of Head Harbor. The schooner Earnest, then in senice near by with the party of Lieutenant Hawley, was in consequence assigned to make the sonrn:lingR. On the morning of October 14 the vessel got under way, stood out of Brooklin Harbor with fresh wind from tlie soutbeast, aud at half past ten wa.s at anchor in Head Harbor, which is entirely open to the sea from south around to west. The afternoon was spent in setting up a tide-gauge and in erecting and determining the positions of signals, as usual, in advance of running lines of soundings. Snow fell t-0 the depth of three inches, and the wind was strong from the northeast. At eight o'clock in the evening of the 15th the wind ba{lked to northwest and increased in force. As the schooner had a high hill for a lee, no uneasiness was felt on board, but close watch was kept upon the ancbor-cbaimi. Up to that hour tl.ie >essel had not dragged from either of tbe two anchors. In the course of the next hour, or about nine o'clock at night, the wind suddenly shifted to west-southwest, and blew a heavy gale directly frolll seaward into the harbor. The schooner dragged, struck, and swung broadside to the shore. Lieutenant Hawley promptly hove up the port anchor, in lieu of the chain bent on a fiYe-inch hawser, and had the anchor carried well out to wind ward. B.r that expedient the Rarnest wa.." hauled out, and, ueing upon a lee shore in a harbor too narrow to work in, the starboard anchor was raised and sent out with fifteen fathoms of chain in hopes that both anchors might. hold in the new position. Hut as the wind hauled to southward and westward the se.a, increased rapidly, and in about fifteen minutes the vessel commenced thumping urnler the starboard quarter upon a rock.'- bottom. l'erceiving that this unfortunate condition was due to the fall of the tide, Lieutenant Hawlt>y immediately gave orders to heave in on tbe hawser and starboard andwr, and the Earnest wa8 again clear of the rocks. Presently the starboard anchor came home, but had quickly bent to it the other end of the hawser, and the anchor was taken out and dropped well over towards the opposite shore. After midnight the sea was too heavy to admit of sending out chains, but the vessel st.ill held by her hawsers. Lieutenant Hawley for additional security made a long line of tbe fore and arnin sheets aud peak halliards, and had one end of it fastened to the western shore. The \'essf\l then showed about an equal strain on each of the three fastenings by which she was hel<l. As the tide was falling rapidly the precaution was taken to draw the .-essel towards deep water by occasional pulls on the lines, and that expedient was effective until three o'clock in the morning of tbe 16th. But in the course of the next half hour, sea and wincl increasing, the starboard hawser parted, the schooner swung around broadside to the wind, parted the shore line, and dashed violentJ,,- on the rock8, at the same time bringing home the port anchor. All resources beariug ou the safety of the vessel being exhausted, the officers and crew left the schoouer. By the force of the sea the g;ig was dashed into small pieces on the roeks. Not.withstanding the cold and the excessive labor which all had endured for many hours, another line was made fast to the port quarter of the vessel and hauled taut, in hope that the schooner mig·ht float when the tide (about ten feet) was again high. Bnt as water appeitred in the hold, Lieutenant Hawley ordered the movable property to be taken ashore. This was done hy the exertions of .M:asters Richard .M:itchell, G. C. Ilanus, and A. H. Cobb, U. S. N., who were faithfully seconded by every man in the crew of the vessel. Lieut. H. E. Nichols, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey Hydrographic Division, was at

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Head Harbor as soon as possible after the disaster and co-operated with Lieutenant Hawley and his officers in relieving the vessel. Subsequently it was found that the schooner bad lost.tier keel, garboa1d streaks, and well logs. In that condition, however, the ,·essel w~1s raised and beached at Head Harbor, aud being subsequently filled with empty casks at low tide, was at high tide of November 14 snccessfnlly floated t-0 Belfast, where temporary repain; were made, in order to secum the ve8sel for tile winter. The Earnest was subsequently repaired and thoroughl~· refitted at Belfast, awl during ,June of tile present year was nse<l for prosecuting hydrographic work in the approaclles to Penobscot Bay. When tlle misllap occurred at Head Harbor Mr. ~William E. Woodall, of Baltimore, the builder of the vel:!sel, immediately proceeded at hil:! own cost and, on Yiewing the schooner, offered advice aml assistance for lier recovery. Tlle Earnest having been built in composite style, iron frames and beams with wood planking, a style unknown to seamen on the coast of Maine, the knowledge of the constructor was of great use in rt>lieving the vessel from her perilous situation. Great interest had been excited in regard to tlle ability of any composite vessel to withstand severe trial;.i of strength, and this qnes'.ion was about to be solved. ·\Vhen taken out of the water at Belfa8t astonisllmeut was expressed by searueu a11d ship-builders at the small amount of damage to the hull of tlle Earnest. The declaration was general tllat if the vessel had been eutirely con8tructe1l with wood scantling, she must inevitably have gone to pieees on the rocky bottom of Head Harbor. As the composite style of building was adopted for the Coast Sur\·ey sen·ice after careful consideration, the issue of the severe te.~t to which the Earnest was su~jected has been at least some offt;et as against the cost of subsequent repairs. The refitting at Belfast was done by builders who bad no concern whatever in the construct.ion of the vessel. For the disinterested action of Mr. Woodall, who declined reimbursement even for his traveling expenseR, I take pleasure in recording here the a-0knowledgment of my obligations. Tidal observations.-At North Haven, on the coast of Alaine, the series of tidal and meteorological observation;.i which were commenced in January, 1870, have been continued dming the 11reseut year by Mr. .J. G. -Spa11lding. The self.registering tide-gauge there in use is of the best construction and is furnished with heating apparatus to prevent the formation of ice near the float. By the care and attention of the obserYer interruptions in the series have been generally a>oided. As mmal, the record has been kept up hy means of a staff-gauge when it has been neccsMry to stop tlie self.registering apparatus for cleaning or for repairs. The series at N ortb Haven is, so far, one of the best on record. Topography of tke Penobscot River, Me.-'rhe survey of the Penobscot was resumed early in August, 1876, by Assistant A. W. Longfellow, and has been extended along the west bank from Hampden up to B.ingor and on the east bank from Orrington to Brewer Village. Mr. C. H. Van Orden was attached to the plane-table party as temporary aid. Among the details mapped arc the line of railroad witllin working limits on the east side of the river, and on the west side the terminus of the Alaine Central Railroad at the city vf Bangor. County roads within the same limits were traced and mapped, as were also the surface features of the gTound and improvements in their Yicinity. The work was con tinned until the 25th of October, The part of the Penobscot remaining to be surveyed lies betwern the work done this season and the dam which limits the flow of the tide at a point about one mile above Bangor.

Hydrograpky, /::Jaco Rivel' entrance, Me.-1for the supplementary soundings needful in the approaches to Saco River a party was detailed early in September, 1876, to work under the charge of Assistant F. F. Nes. After establishing a tide-station and erecting signals, soundings were extended beyond previous limits abreast of Ferry Be.i.ch, to include the vicinity of Eagle Island

and Ram Island, on the north side of the entrance t-0 the Saco, and also to the southward from the shore-line of .Fletcher's Neck beyond the Hussey's Rock buoy.

Triangulation in New lla.mp.~hire.-Thi8 work lias been fnrther advanced by the occupation of two primary stations to the southward and westward of l\fouut vYashington. Prof. E.T. Quimb;y took the fiel!l Parly in Jnne, 1876, established his party on the summit of Whiteface :Mountain, in the town of ·waterville, and was tlH·re eug·aged until August. The party was then transferred to l\fonnt Lafayette. Unfa\·orable weather hindered the observationi< at both l"tations, but the angular measurements at Mount Lafayette were completed by the end of September. In addition to careful measurements on primary signals, numerous secondary and tertiary objects were observed on from the statinnR occupied b;y Professor (~uimb.v. The summer months of 1876 are noted in the field-records of this party as unprecedented in the mountain region of New Hampshire for heat, drought, haze, and forest fires, all temliug to retard the progress of work. During twenty consecutive da:ys in August no outlying siguah; could be seen from 1\fount J,afa.ydte. 'l'he observations of this season by Professor Qnimhy for connecting Mount Washington with the State scheme of triangulation were all directed to the iron chimney of the new hotel as a signal. The statistics of the season are·: Stations occupied . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Angles observed, principal _- - . - ____ . . _______________________ . _. ___ ...... _ 27 .Angle8 oboierved, secondary, &c ............................... _. _.... . . . . 51 .Angular measurements, horizontal _..... _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . l, 371 .Angular measurements, vertical . . . . . . . . . . . . . _....................... _. · . 1, 0~)2 The work here under notice falls in a quadrilateral, of which the points yet to be occupied are Mount W a8hington and, southeast of that peak, a mountain known as llearsargc, in Carroll Uouuty, New Hampshire. ·when the poRition of the last-mentioned mountain was dete~mined approximately in 1851 by angular measurement from adjacent stations, the name of the station so determined was entered m the Coast Survey record of the triangulation as "I'equaukct," a designation then warranted by oecasional use in the county, aud adopted mt her than the uarne Kean;arye, as beiug conveniently distinctive in the record. 1t was known to the observers that one of the mountains in l\lerrimac County had been called Kearsarge for many years, and that it bad probably borne no other uame. Whether or not the mountain in Merrimac was the first so named in New Hampshire, the fact, bas been brought to light by reference to the records of the official surveys that the mountain in Carroll Cmmty was known by the name Kearsarge in 1784, aud }lrobably ea1·lier; aud H is t<m monly so designated at, this day. Old records, examined in the course of the re s1 arcl1, ~bow ali>o that the name "Pequauket" applied about two hundred years ago, not to the mountain, hut to a plain Tiear it8 base, which plain was the site of one of the early settlements of New Eu gland. 'The use of the name "I'equauket" serYcd iu the Coast Survey record to distinguish in 1851 tl1e ~tat ion in Carroll Connt_y from the mountain (subsequently occupied with the theodolite) in 'Mt·rrimac, but eopies of early maps now on file in the Coast Survey Office prove tbat up to the year 1816 the mountain in Carroll was known ouly as "Kearsarge," and close inquiry shows that persons of great age and yet living have passed their lives near by without heariug any other name applied to it. The name "Pigwackett," as applied to a mountain upwards of three thomiand feet high, appears firtlt on the map published by Philip Carrigain in 1816. He thereon inserted the name a;; "Pig· wackett,formerly Kiarsarge." But map publishers since the year 1816 have, with few exceptions, restored the name "Kearsarge" as attaching to the mountain in Carroll.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

As the printed records of the Coast Survey must become part of the permanent matter used for reference in the future, it seems proper to enter therein the names of the two mountains of New Hampshire so that the record may conform with the usage which Las been most general in past years. The mountain in Carroll will therefo1·e be designated in the Coast Sur>ey record "Kearsarge .!Yorth,'' and tue mountain in .;\Ierrilllac '' Kearsarge South." While prosecnting fieltl·work in New Hampshire, Professor Quimby hi1s had the ad\'antage of direct correspondence with Assistant Hichard D. Cutts, whose knowledge and experience have become the sources of valuable suggestions for seeurillg success in triangulation. Tidal obseri:ations.-Until the rniddle of February, when Uie recorder died, the tidal and meteorological observations were kept up at the Charlestown navy-yard, near Boston. The observer, Mr. H. Howland, a clerk on the receiving-ship, had been some time in bad health, but until his death hall the occasional aid of friends in maintaining tLe tidal records. The series of observations at this station was closed on the rnth of February and discontinued. A very complete series of observatfons of high arnl low water had bel'n recordetl at the same station for a period of nineteen :-.·ears. For predicting the tides the results have already become available by discussion iu the office. Since the year 1872 a self-registering tide-gauge of improved construction has been in use at l'rm-itlence, R. I., the observations being maintained at the expem1e of the city. During four years tlie tidal registers and the forms furnished for tabulating have been regularly sent to the Coast Survey Office as an equi>alent for the use of the apparatus. The observations thus recorded will nrnterhilly aid in the i1ffestigation of the tides of Narragansett Bay. Tidal currents, Gulf nf 1lfaine.-For the purpose of recording observations on the tidal currents between Nantucket autl Cape Sable, tue schooner Drift was refittetl, and left New York early in June with a party under ch~rge of Acting Master ltobert Platt, U. S. N., Assistant Coast Sun·ey. At Hyannis, Assistant Henry Mitchell joined the party for oonference, and suggested m detail the methods for securing and recording the desired observations. On a chart stations were marked at which the vessel was to be anchored while currents in the vicinity were observed At the first station, to the ea,,;tward of Nantucket, the Drift was anchored on the morning of the 6th of June in sixty fathoms of water. The day was passed in recording observations, and the record for the station was completed on the following day, showing the rate of current at the surface and downward to a depth of thirty fathoms. Tlie density of the water was also noted and recorded. Acting l\faster Platt remarked that the flood-tide, swell, or sea showed distinctly just before the last of tue ebh. "These swells begin and increase until about three-quarter flood; then the sea becomes more r1niet, and at high tide they become regular. As the ebb-tide makes, the swell begins to go down autl at about three-tprnrter ebb it becomes quite srnootli." North of Nantucket other current stations will be occupied in the course of the summer. The work then executed will be mentioned in further detail in my next annual report. Ensigns Albert l\lcrtz and J.P. Underwootl are attached to the party in the schooner Drift. lu October and Novernuer, 1876, repeated attempts were made by the party in the schooner Drift to obsen·e for current8 in the Gulf of Maine, but the weather was then too boisterous to admit of keeping tLte vessel at anchor for a period sufficient for completing observations at either of the . intellfle<l stations. At the end of November the Drift returned to New York. Triangul<ition of Taunton River, Mass.-In a preceding season the triangulation of this river was exteuded from the head of Narragansett Bay upwards to North Dighton. Subsequently the detailed topographical survey was carried as far up as Weir Village. To provide for completing thP survey to the head of navigation, a party was sent to determine points intermediate between Dighton and the city of Taunton, and from the city eastward to include the manufacturing village knolVn as Squaw-bet.ty. For this work .Assistant A. M. Harrison took the fi<>ld on the 14th of August., 1876, aided by Mr. C. H. Sinclair, and during part of the season also by Mr. W. C. Hodgkins. The banks of the river being thickly settled and affording no prominent hills, special care was exercised in the selection of points that woultl be intervisiule without interfering with the numerous patches of forest trees, orch1:1rdH, or tree-borders of roads. By the courtesy of residents, the roofs of a number of' houses were marked wit,11 signals and subsequently occupied as stations with the

theodolite by the use of a platform so contrived as t.-0 be easily removed from one and mounted on another house-t.-Op. Ground-stations were marked as usual to insure identification if the point shoald be needed at any future time. Of the fifty-two stations at which angl1.>s were measured, fif. teen were on houses. The triangulation was com11lcted on the 28th of No·ember, and the work comprises the following in statistics: Signals erected. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 54 Stations occupied. . . ........... , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . · 5 .Angles measured.................. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 320 Observations with theodolite .............................................. 5, 668 Before leaving the vicinity of Taunton River, Mr. Harrison traced and added to the plane-table survey of the pre,·ious season several miles of the line of the Old Colony Railroad, to make the road appear continuous on the sheets above Fall River, the parts omitted in the survey being somewhat beyond the limit adopted for the detailed topograplJy. -In preceding seasons most of the topographical details of the shore,,; of Narragansett Bay were mapped by Assistant Harrison. Soon after the completion of that work Prof. N. S. Shaler, of Harvard College, made a special study of the geology of this part of the coast, aud iu doing S(l relied on the rPsults of the plane-table survey. He thus refers to the advantage which tbe to11ographieal representation afforded for his researches: "So perfectly has the topographer caught the expression of the surface of the country, that by studying the map of Aquidne.ck or Rhode Island, I baYe been able to determine the position of geological faults and the general character and dip of the ruck even before visiting the localities, and at points where the uneducated eye would percei·rn novariety in the character of the surface. Most of the satisfaction and success which I ha>e bad in my work is due to the excellence of the plane-table survey.''

Topography of the t:icinity of New Haren, Conn.-The detailed surrny of the Yicinity of New Ha\'en bas heen extended hy parties working under the charge of Assistaut R. M. Baehe. For the purposes of tb~ plane-table work twentJ·-six points were determined by triangulation. On the eastern side of the harbor the details of topograph;y were filled in to include the Yicinity of Lake Saltonstall. From 'Vest Haven, ou the opposite side of the harbor, the plane-table work was continued northward to the limit reached in other parts of the survey. Field operations were discontinued late in November, 1876, but were resumed at the opening of spring. The sun·ey was steadily prosecuted until the end of the fiscal ;year, and is yet in progress. At the end of June the statistics of work added to the previous survey were :

Pendulum experiments.-The work which lms been prosecuted by Assistant C. S. Peirce was resumed at New York on the 1st of February, 1877. For determining the fiexure of the pendulum stand nnmer-0us measures were made during Febmary and March. Experiments with the automatic relay were then commenced, and the force of gravity was ascertained on the Repsold stand. These operations were continued until the middle of May, and similar experiments were made upon another form of support. Subassistant Edwin Smith, under the direction of Mr. Peirce, commenced time obserYations early in March, and these were repeated on thirty-one nights preceding the end of June. In April a very extensive ser-ies of measures of the length of the pendulum was made, and at intervals these were repeated in May and June. At the same time optical measures of wave-lengths were recorded in good weather for the determination of a standard of len,~th, S.Ex.12--3

REPOHT <JF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

In the latter part of the fiscal year Assistant Peirce made a full set of experiments with the pendulum, uniform with a set whic11 he had made in Europe for ascertaining the force of gravity. Of the opt·rations here noticed further mention will be made in my next annual report. 1'rian[J11l11tion.-At the opening of the fiscal year Assistant Hichard D. Cutts relinquished tlie charge of the Coast Snrvey exhibit which he had arrange<l as part of the International Exposition at Philadelphia, and early in July, 187G, resumed field-work in this section. At South Adams he found that the residents of tliat vicinity had opened a road to the summit of Oreylock Mountain, am! thus his party was euabled to proceed at once to the primary station wllich would have been ocenpied last seaRon if facilities for reaching· it had then existed. A temporary observatory was 8et up, the inRtruments were mounted, and camp wa8 pitched on the summit of Greylock by the 12th of July. Between that date and September 9 the requisite horizontal and vertical angles were measured. Heliotropes were employed at Mount Tom, on Monadnock, on Greenwich Hill, on Ifoklerllerg, and at Pro8pect Mountain. The lines to these several stations vary from 38 to 62 miles in their distances from Gre.rlock. Duriug August the work was retarded by causes that are somewhat eommon in other districts in tliat month, but which especially affected the atmosphere in the valley of the Hudson. A drought prevailed, and consequently continuous haze, and the smoke from furnaces at Troy and elsewhere along the riYer hecame, to an unusual degree, a hinderance to progress in recording the observations. 'l'he hPliotropes could be seen only after a north or northwest wind or a rain storm from the west, the effect of which was to clear the air of the valley. From Greylock, A>Jsistant Cutts transferred his party to Helderberg, a summit 1,824 feet above tide, au<l about seventeen miles westward of AJlJany. Observations were begun at that statiou iu tlie middle of September and were concluded on the 15th of November. In cloudy weather, genera II,\-, the heliotropefl proYed ineffective, but under clouds the atmoRphere occaRionally became such as to bring into Yiew the diRtant signal-poles, when, at the same time, the 11eliotropes could not be St'en. 'l'o the westward ollservatious were made on the signal of a station in Otsego County, about thirty-Rix miles (Iistant from Helderuerg. A>Jsistant Cutts was aided in the field by ~Ir. J. F. Pratt. The following are statistics of the triangulation:

In reference to means for ascertaining the heights of the triangulation-points above the sea, Assistant Cutts remarks in his report: "As it was very desirable that the leveling should start from a correct base, connected directly with tidewater, the altitude above mean tide of the station-mark on Mount Rafinesque was determined, in the course of the season, by a line of spirit-levels forward and back. By means of this base, the heights of l\Ionaduock and Mount Tom, of the primary triangulation to the eastward, ·could he checked, and the heights of stations in the interior of the country could be determined with unusual accuracy. The spirit-leveling up the Hudson River, by the Coast Survey, as far as Stuyvesant's Landing, was accepted as correct. :From the bench-mark at the Landing to the bench· mark at Lansingburg the leveling done by Mr. R. H. Talcott (the mean of three separate and close lines of levels) for the improvement of the Hudson River was accepted as equally correct; and from the bench-mark at Lansingburg to the station-mark on Mount Rafinesque, the leveling was done under my direction by George R. Talcott, an experienced observer." The original records of this work, and of the triangulation, have been duplicated and deposited in the office, with abstract8 of angles and computations showing the lengths of triangle-sides, the heights of stations above mean tide, and the resulting values of the coefficient of refraction. While. at this station, and generally during the season, Assistant Cutts maintained correspondence with the several observers who have been accepted for the work of determining geodetic

points in the States of the Union in which geological or other surve:vs are now in progress. His readiness and large experience in the field have been specially useful to the acting as,;iio;tants in New Hampshire, ~ew Jersey, Penm;ylvania, Kentucky, '£ennessee, and \Yisco1rni11, who, being professors in colleges, need only the information which cannot be gained except by ma11,y years of observation and traversing all varieties of country through which triangulation has been prosecuted. l\Ir. Cutts has discussed the character of the work, so far a8 done in the Statt-s, with reference to the standard of accuracy deemed requisite for the operations of the Coast Surve~-, and, hy his knowledge of the requirements, has secured the unity so desirable in regard to plan and metl1od for the work already executed in the States, and upon which must ultimatel,y he based the detailed surveys of their areas. Tidal obser,vations.-The series of tidal obser\'ations at Govt>rnor's faland, in New York Harbor, has been kept up b,y l\fr. R. T. Bassett. Hot water is used freely during severe weatlier in winter, a.<; without that expedient the continuity of observations could not be maintained. 'l'hi:-i series wa8 begun on the 12th of December, 1852, but for several years immediately following, on account of frequent stoppages in cold weather, observations were omitted during winter. High and low waters were, bowe,·er, recorded for tho8e periods by a box-gauge on the Brookl,vn side of the harbor. In 1861 winter obsen·ations were again re1mmed, and, with some unaniidable interruptions, they have been kept up to the present time. 'fhe apparatus in u8e is of the old form, and without recent improvements, but the experience of the obscrnr has enabled him to furnish good records of the tides. The same obsernir makes day observations at Hamilton Avenue Ferry wharf~ in Brooklyn, for comparison with the series at Go,·ernor's Island_ The series of tidal observations started with a self-registering gauge at Sandy Hook, in October, 1875, has been kept up by l\fr. J. W. Banford, at the station on one of the wharves of the New Jersey Southern Railroad. The obsen'er having charge of the depot, and with a party of lrnnd s subject to his direction, is well furnished with facilities for keeping the tidal apparatus in order. Good observations have been returne<l, though at times the surface of the sea becomes quite rou!!,'h. At this station the tides are greatly affected h;y wind81 a8 must he the case in the immediate vicinity of the open sea. The position occupied by the tide-gauge seems to be as near the ocean as it is practicable to maintain the apparatus iu steady operation at the entrance of New York Ba~·. A. continuous series of observation8 at thi8 8tation is very desirable. Verification.-In November, 1876, my attention was called to a supposed decrease of depth 11ear Buoy No. 2, in Gecluey's Channel, entrance to New York Ilarhor. The sclioouer Drift hadng shortly afterwards returned to New York, 1lirections were gh·en to Ading Master Hobert Platt, U. S. N., to examine the locality in question. For that purpose the vessel was got under wa~' 011 the morning of the 7th of Decemher, and soon after came to anchor near the railroad wharf at Sandy Hook, to note the condition of the self-registering tide-gauge before beginning the soundings 11eedful in Gedney's Chan11el. The Drift remained comfortably at her a11ehorage during the night of the 7th, although the breeze was strong from the westward. Next morning the wb1d was quite fresh from the northwest, hut.as it moderated at !J a. m. the vessel proceeded to the workinggronnd and recorded soundings near Buoy No. 2 until two o'clock in the afternoon, when the wind began to blow hard. A.s the weather at the same time became ,.eQ· cold, Acting .MaHter Platt recalled the sounding-boat, and returned to his anchorage iusille of Sandy Hook. At umlnigbt the barometer did not indicate much change, but the temperature had sunk to 20° ahove zero. The wind at that time was from the southeast, with snow-squalls. The vessel was held by two anchors, and when the land could he seen good ranges were taken, and it was 11ot deemed necessary to change the position. Early next moming the wind suddenly shifted to northward and westward, making Sandy Hook a lee shore. In half an honr the anchorage was i;:wept by a hurricane, the barometer sunk rapidly and the thermometer stood at 100. The sea l·ecame very rough, the schooner shipped much water, and ice formed thick and fast on the deck. Presently the vesi.;el began to strike the bottom at every heavy swell of the sea. Signal8 were made to several tng boats that lay near the railroad wharf, and though one of them instantly moved towards the Drift, the attempt to reach her was twice unsuccessful. In a third eftort a second tug joined, and by hard work passed a hawser on board the schooner. The Drift was then towed in near the railroad wharf.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Three schooners and a steamboat were thrown on the beach by the hurricane; the damage sustained b,r the Drift was inconsiderable. At the opening of the season the vessel was refitted, and has since been in service in the Gulf of Maine. Acting :Master Platt's report on the incidents attending the hurricane encountered in Raritan Bay, states that the officers, Acting Ensign George Glass and Mates L. F. Lee and .J. A. Smith, and the crew of the Drift behaved with great spirit and energy notwithstanding the extreme cold to which all were subjected. Triangulation in New Jersey.-At the end of July, 1876, field-work was resumed near Calrlwell where it was hoped that a station might be found for connecting the primary triangulation which crosses the State of New Jersey with the 8ystem of triangles laid out under the direction of Prof. G. H. Cook, to the northward of l\forristown. Early in August, Prof. E. A. Bowser commenced the erection of signals at stations which he had previously selected. When requisite, in order to bring others iuto view, he also put up ele>ated scaifolds to sustain the theodolite while angular measurements were in progress. Of the stations selected, Goat Hill and Mount Rose were occupied in the course of the season. Under the direction of Professor Bowser, a line of levels was run from a bench.mark near the lock of the Delaware and Raritan Canal feeder, at Lambertsville, up to Goat Hill station, with a view to determine the height of that triangulation-point above mean tide. Field-work was discontinued in January, but was resumed in May of the present year. The observations required at Goat Hill, }fount Rose, and Newtown were completed in the month following-and as the triangulation in Eastern Pennsylvania connects with those stations directly, and thus also with the completed primary friangulation of New Jersey, the length of tl1e triangle sides in Pennsylvania will become readily known by computation. As yet no base-line has been measured in either of the two States.

N., Assistant Uoast Survey, with the schooner Bache. In a previous season 8oundings had been extended from the entrance npward to the vicinity of Tom's River. At that limit the hydrography was resumed by Lieutenant Moser on the 23d of August, 1876, and was carried forward with the schooner as long as was found to be practicable with a vessel of that draught. Subsequently the barge which had been in use while the plane-table survey was in progress proved available for completing the soundings above the mouth of Tom's River. That branch of the bay, and also Mosquito Cove, Kettle Creek, and the lower part of Metitiniconk River, are included amongst the details on the hydrographic sheet. While soundings were in progress a tide-gauge was kept for record at Sea Side Park. Later in the season a second gauge wa.<; established in Kettle Creek, and after the middle of September observations were recorcled with a third tide-gauge in Tom's River. The hydrography of the bay and its branches was completed by the 5th of October. Some of the points established in the triangulation of Barnegat Bay had been obliterated by the action of the sea, but enough were identified by Lieutenant .Moser to suffice for the hydrographic srirvey.

Coast Pilot.-Thc work of compiling and preparing for publication the Coast Pilot for the Atlantic coast has been continued by Assistant J. S. Bradford. In October, 1876, with a party in the schooner Palinurus, he examined the coast of New Jerse;r between Sandy Hook and Delaware Bay. The daugers incident to navigation along the outer coast were c:arefnll,v noted, and special examinations were made of Little Egg Harbor and AbRecon. Jn proceeding up Delaware Bay search was made for a shoal spot said to have only six feet of water to the westward of Brandywine Shoal, but no danger to navigation was found in the place indicated, nor was its existence known amongst the bay pilots. The examination of the Delaware was extended as far np as Trenton. As heretofore, views of prominent points on the bay and river were drawn by Mr. John R. Barker, who accompanied the party in the Palinurus. In passing the coast of New ,Jersey the entrances were sketehed as mmal for the Coast Pilot, and the views were as soon as practicable etched for printing. Lieut. Frederick Collins, U.S. N., accompanied the party in the schooner l'alinurus, and at the close of work, which will be noticed in the next section of this report, took command of the vessel for duty on the southern coast. The preparation of the notes compiled for the second volume of the Coast Pilot, including thirteen views drawn in the course of the season, is well advanced and the matter will shortly be in readiness for publication. Triangulation in Pennsylvania.-Field-work was resumed in this State in the middle of Juue, 1876, hy Prof. L. M. Haupt,, and was prosecuted until tllc 26th of November. The reconuaissance for points of triangulation was continued until the co1inectiou of the scheme in Eastern Pennsylvania with the scheme of triangles laid out in ~cw Jersey proved to be entirely satisfactor.r. By the selection near Allentown of a station intenisible with a summit in the upper part of Bucks County, the system of work was further improved, and to the southward and westward stations were finally chosen for extending the triangulation to the Susquehanna River. In order to adjust the scheme in its approximate geographical position, Professor Haupt measured a short base in the preceding year and obserYed for latitude and azimuth, but no site bas yet been found suitable for a base on the measurement of which the lengths of the triangle sides will depend. A site in the vicinity of Lonsdale, on the line of the North Pennsylvania Railroad, bas been under consideration, and may be M'ailable if required for the desired measurement and for connecting properly with the triangulation above Philadelphia. Some of the southern stations in the scheme laid out by Professor Haupt may prove to be intervisible with points occupied in the triangulation of Chesapeake Bay, in which case no base of verification will be required within the present limits of the field-work in Pennsylvania.

REPORT OF THE SUPERTh'TENDENT OF

SECTION III.
ATLANTIC COAST AND BAYS OF MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA, INCLl'"DING SEAPORTS AND RIVERS.
(SKETCH No. 6.)

Goa~t Pilot.-In November, 1876, after closing work in Delaware River, Assistant J. S. Bradford, accompanied by Lieut. Frederick Collins, U. S. N., proceeded with the schooner Palinurus southward of Cape Henlopen. The coast approaches and inlets along the seaboard of Delaware and Virginia were examined by Mr. Bradford, and, under his direction, views of special localities were drawn by Mr. J. R. Barker both of the outer coast and of points along the shores of Chesapeake Bay. The weather proved to be exceptionally severe, but work was continued until the 7th of December, when fort.her oper.itions were stopped by the prevalence of ice at the head of the bay. Assistant Bradford, in consequence, returned to Baltimore. The command of the vessel was there transferred to Lieutenant Collins, and preparation was made for continuing examinations and the preparation of sailing directions, etc., below Cape Henry. )lention of the work done by the party in charge of Lieuten:tnt Collins will be made under the head of Sections IV and V, in this report. Upward of fifty views were drawn by Mr. Barker, of points indicated by .Assistant Bradford, along the outer coast and the shores ot' Chesapeake Bay. During the winter the material collected uuder hiR direction was compiled at the office and arranged for publication. In addition to the personal oversight of details relating to the Coast Pilot, :M:r. Bradford retained charge ot the Engraving Division of the Coast Survey Office unt.il the end of March, when he was relieved by .Asshitant L. A. Sengteller. Positions of United States life-saving stations.-Last year the positions of life-saving stations north of the entrance to Delaware Bay were determined by Assistant F. H. Gerdes, and were carefully marked on the original plane-table sheets proper to the localities of the stations. In continuation of the service, Mr. Gerdes proceeded to this section late in September, 1876, and in the following month determined in position the stations at Cape Henlopen and Indian River, on the coast of Delaware; at Green Run Inlet, on the coast of Maryland; and at Chincoteague, Cedar Island, Hog Island, Cobb's Island, and Smith's Island (Cape Charles), on the coast of Virginia. The inRpector of the life-saving stations, Capt. J. H. Merryman, of the United States Revenue l\farine, afforded many facilities for the work of this and the preceding year in giving notes of the hest routes for reaching the stations and in regard to their approximate positions. With these Assistant Oerdes was enabled to identify the localities by examining the plane table sheets, and, as data for the fielll operations, tracings were made of the vicinity of each of the stations. Various methods were used for determining positions. When the locality could be identified on the topographical tracing, angular measurements were recorded, the object in such case being light-houses, old buildings, or sharp and well-defined points in the topography. If no conspicuous object was iu view, linear measurements were made, to determine the distance from the station to tl!e nearest objects that had been previously ascertained in position ; tllese, in a few cases, being points used for the coast triangulation. The report of Assistant Gerdes was accompanied by sketches aud descriptions of the stations. After his arrival at the office in Washington positions were carefully plotted from the field·notes, and the original topographical sheets were marked to correspond with the positions of the life-saving stations of the fifth district. Assistant Gerdes was aided in the field by Mr. Hugh Caperton. Baltimore HarbQT'.-For the special sur..-ey of the harbor of Baltimore, for which work means were apJJropriated by the legislature of the State of Maryland, a careful triangulation was made by Assistant .J. W. Donn, in July and August, 1876. Subsequently the entire wharf-line was measured carefully as a check and for comparison with the determinations of the plane.table. As usual, the work was done entirely on the ground, the only record being the delineations shown by the topographical sheets. Comparisous were constantly made with the measured lines of the wharves, piers, and docks, and tbe a~rreement left nothing to desire in point of accuracy. "ln extending the survey along such parts of the harbor-line as were not occupied by wharves or piers, and which could not be clearly determined otherwise, a leveling instrument was used t.o

mark out the line of mean high water. Tbi8 plane wa8 ascertained by a o;eries of day anr1 night observations extending through two lunar months. Tide-stations were established at Hemlerson'8 wharf, Fell's Point; \Voodall's floating dock, Locust Point; Bollman's wharf, Canton; and at vVinam;' dock, on the Patapsco River front. The series was recorded at the Fcll's Point gauge, and, duriug a calm season, free from winds and abnormal tides, simultaneous observations were made to determine differences of period of maxima of fiood and ebb. These differences were found to be less than :fifteen minutes, or practicably inappreciable in the limited tidal flow of the harbor, which the mean of one hundred and fifteen tides shows to be 1.16 feet or four-hundredths of a foot less than that established for the station at Fort Carroll." Soundings were commenced early in October and were continued uninterruptedly until the part of the harbor known as Spring Garden was closed by ice. While the hydrography was in progress, Assistant Donn surveyed the shores of the Patapsco on both sides of the harbor, and mapped the results on a scale of 300 feet to the inch.~ The Rpace between the head of the basin and the water front of Canton was surveyed on a scale of 150 feet to the inch. On the south 8hore of the Patapsco the details were mapped from the Long Bridge to the bulkhead at the :Marine Hospital. The hydrography represents the depths found between Spring Garden, Ferry Bar, Bush Point, at Brooklyn, and a liue extended from the bulkhead of the Marine Hospital to the lower wharf of the Stickney Iron Company, at the Lazaretto. The area of tbe basin and harbor to Canton was sounded, and plotted on the scale of the topographical sheets that cover the same locality. During intervals of weather unfa.vorahle for work in the field or afloat, the reductions, computations, and other detail8 pertaining to the work were completed. Assistant Donn closed active operations at Baltimore at the end of the year, and resumed the survey of the James UiYer, Ya., as will be mentioned under a separate head in this chapter. On the 1st of June of the present year the special sur-rny of Baltimore harbor was again taken up at Spring Garden, and along the Patapsco between the drawbridge and BrooklJ·n, and west of the bridge. The recordecl details show that in the course of the snrvey seventeen thousand four hundred soundings were made, and that one thousand four hundred and forty-three angles were measured for determining the positfon of the boat while sounding in midwater. The posithms of the ends of the lines were ascertained by means of the plane-table. The principal lines of soundings were run parallel to the meridian, and cross or check lines were run at right angles to them. Lines of levels were run between the tide-gauges at Henderson's, Bollman's, and vVoodall's, but no appreciable difference of planes was detected. The same result was folllld by recortling simultaneous observations of the tides. The following is an extract from the concluding report of Assistant Donn: "The kindness and consideration of the mayor of Baltimore, Hon. Ferdinand B. Latrobe, were manifested on many occasions during the progress of the survey. Previous to the conclusion of arrangements with the State comptroller for a supply of funds, and when money was needed to forward the work, the ma,yor advanced means, which were subsequently replaced from the State appropriation by Hon. Levin Woolford, the State comptroller. .As chairman of the harbor board of Baltimore, the mayor issued a request to pilots and captains of veissels to gh·e the right of way throughout the harbor to the sounding-boat while at work, and thus the progress in hylirograpli:r was greatly facilitated, as the reque8t of the mayor was generally acceded to." This elaborate survey is represented by five topographical and five hydrograpbic sheets, all of which will be in request for the uses of a board uonstituted by the President of tlie United States, in May, 1876. As defined in the direction from the President, the duties of the board include "the survey of the harbor of Baltimore City and the adjacent water8, and the establishment of the river and bulkhead lines thereof.'' The members are, General A . .A. Hnmphreys, Chief of Engineers; the Superintendent of the Uoast Survey; and Maj. W. P. Craighill, Corps of Engineers. Magnetic obseri1ations.-The usual annual observations for the determination of magnetic declination, dip, and intensity were recorded by Assistant Charles A. Schott, on tl1e 14th, 15th, and 16th of June, 1877, at a station on Capitol Hill, in Washington City, intermediate between the

24

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Capitol and the station at which observations bad been regularly made in preceding years, and which was of necessity abandoned when the ground on which it stood was required for buildings. At the two sites, the magnetic dip and intensit~' are very nearly the same, but declination at the new station is affected by differential local disturbance, although the position is only nine hundred and fifty feet northwest of the old station, which was first established in the year 1866. Boundary between 1lfaryland mid Virginia.-:M:ention was made in my last annual report of the assignment of Mr. Charles J unken for the topob·Taphical survey of such parts of Smith's Island in Che;;apeake Bay as might be deemed requisite by the boundary commissioners of Maryland and Virginia, when the members, who were present at Crisfield early in July, 1876, were in conference respe(jting the dividing line between the two States. In accordance with their request Mr. Junken made a complete map of the island south of Mister's Thoroughfare, and another showing Jlarts of the country west ~f Pocomoke River, in the vicinity of the boundary. Maryland was represented at Crisfield conference by the Hon. Isaac D. Jones, and Virginia by the Hon. R. T. Daniel and Hon. Vi'illiam J. Robertson. The special requests of each member of the commission in respect-of measurements uetween indicated points were complied with. Mr. Junken also endeaYored to identity the outlines of tracts of land on Smith's Island, described in deeds of 1685 and 1693, in which reference is made to the diYiding line between the States. Early in January of the present year, when the arbitrators on the di11puted part of the boundary were about to enter upon their duties, and in accordance with application made by their chairman, Hon. J. S. Black, several hacked copies of the engraved chart which represents Chesapeake Bay, eastward from the mouth of the Potomac River, were furnished for the use ot the board. One of the sheets, duly certified as being a copy of those retained by the board, and marked correspondingly with the line indicated by the arbitrators, was returned by them, and is now on file in this office. If the division line thereon marked is accepted by the two States, the sheet will be of interest as showing the !lettlement of a dis1mte of very long standing in regard to State limits. Topography of.James River, l'a.-This work was resumed early in February, 1877, by Assistant J. Vi'. Donn, whose party had been previously engaged in the special survey of Baltimore Harbor, as stated under a preceding head. Between Westover and points near Richmond signals had been set up early in 1876, and some of the stations were partially occupied before the party was recalled from the sect.ion, on account of danger to the vessel fi·om ruuuing ice in the river Fortunately the points remained withou~ disturbance and were available for the uses of the plane-table party. Resuming work at City Point, Assistant Donn occupied in succession all the stations with the theodolite, and perfected the triangulation of the river to Richmond. Subsequently the shore-lines were traced and the usual margin in topographical details was mapped, including the lower parts of creeks, or branches of the main river as far up as Kingsland Creek, or within nine miles of the city. One of the features delineated on the topographical sheet of this season is the Dutch Gap Canal, in reference to which Mr. Donn observes: "Important changes in the hydrography of the river have followed the opening and deepening of the canal both below and aboYe that work. The great bend of the river, cut off by the severance of FaITar's Neck, has shoaled, and at the western curve a bar is forming that will render navigation difficult or impossihle at no distant day. At the present time the large steamers of the Old Dominion Line pass around the bend when the currents through the gap make its passage difficult for vessels of considerable length. Above the gap the changes are slight, except_ where obstructions were placed during the war." Field.work was closed below Richmond on the 25th of May.

TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SUIWEY. resumed work in the special 8LU'\ey of that harbor, of which notice has already been taken i11 this chapter. Norfolk Harbor 1 l'a.-)lention was malle in last year's report of a physical survey executetl for, and partly at the expense of, the harhor commissioners of Norfolk and Portsmouth, Ya. Si11eP the completion of the field-work of tliis survey much labor lias been nec~~sary to reduce the data to proper form for easy reference and irne; and the Coast Survey has, at the request of the Uuitml States advisory hoanl to tlie aforesai1l eornmissi011, furnished the necessary computer:;; without charge. To give the utmost simplicity to the results of the current observations they Lave been tabulated so as to present in ea,ch case three observe(l and two deri\ed elements. The observed ele. ments are width, depth, and velocity; the derived data are mid-area and mid-volume. The observed elements when plotted de\·elop two cun·es, one of which is the perimeter, the other the transverse curve of velocitieR-the former actnall;y existing as the profile of the cross-section, and the lattBr no less real. If, for instance, standing at a height above the stream, one were to strew floats across frorn shore to shore, Le would see tl1em begin immediately to heml from tl1e straight line, those at the axis of the stream moving faster thau those near the shore, etc., so that after the lapse of our unit of time the floats would lie in a curve-and this is the transverse cnr>e of Yeloc._ ities above mentioned. This cnr,·e of' forces is seen to be related to the curve of depth, and if the bottom is yieldi11g, the profile of the section is seen to he tliat which the forces ha,·e impressecl upon it ; in other words the cliauncl is in a general way the mold of the forees grouped within it. This statement of the general ('.ase loses somewhat its simplicity of meaning when titlal harbors are in question, hecause then sncceso;in; gronps of forces in opposite directions alternate!~- appear; but the proposition hol1ls. The depth excavated in a muddy bottom is a measure of the highest scouring power; and where ebb awl flood streams are respectiYely compared with the profile of the section it is generally found that thr, stronger current is that which has left its furrow. Usnallj· the ebb stream is the stronger, hut not in eYery section and not even in e.-ery part of the same section. The practical bearing of these studies lie:-; in the use of their results as guide,; in the laying down of port-wanlen lines or lines beyond wl1ich no encroachments can be authorized. Such linei; have too often been drawn upon the authority of legislati,·e committees or commissions without an~T stated reasons, and have as often been abrogated upon as good authorit;r and equally without stated reasons. A physical objection to the further prc~jcction of a wharf, while it may be inadequate as against the deyelopment of great commercial advantages, is exceedingly Yaluable as weight in the scale when rival commercial iuterests are baJa,nced, because the wlwle community are taxed in the Yiolation of a natural law, and will not permit it to be done with impunity. The determinations of mid-area and mid-\olmne as gnides in the pr<~jection of harbor-lines were introduced by Mr. Mitchell of the Coast Survey, and are regarded as furnishing better criteria than the lines of equal depths (suhmerged contours) and the lines of equal Yelocity (isod.rnamic liues), although these elements are still considered of great value. In alluvial channels that are not in process of change he finds then two elements coincident, aml therefore concludes that to bring the banks of a channel into a state of re1lose, the tendency of all constructions must be towards imshing together the axes of sectional area and discharge. The tables containing the data from t.he physical survey above referred to were prepared by l\Ir. John B. Weir, aid in the Coast Snrvey, who, having made the original observations in the field under my instructions, was deemed the most reliable computer for reducing the results. Topography eaAJtwa.rd of Norfolk, Ya.. -For extending the plane-table sun·ey in this quarter Assistant C. l\I. Bache took the field on the ht of October, 1876, with a projection made to reooiYc the topographical details found between the eastern branch of Norfolk Harbor and the south side of Chesapeake Bay. The ground passed over presents no elevations, bnt is much intersected by tide-water creeks with numerous branches. Eastward the plane-table snrwy was extended to Kempville. The upper waters of Tanner's Creek were traced, as also Broad Creek and other water-courses found between it and the beach, together with the line of canal that joins Tanner's Creek and Little Creek. All the roads within the limits of the plane-table sheet ~·ere traced and mapped.

Predous to 18i3 much difficulty in II\aintaiuing- the series was experienced with the use of au ordinary pendulum clock, for giYing motion to the apparatus, by reason of the jars caused when steamers touched at the wharf. A very decided improvement in the record was gained by substituting a clock with balance-wheel and lever escapement, and clocks of that kind arc now ern11Ioyed for all stations subject to disturbance. The tide-gauge at Fortress Monroe is fnrniRhed with an enameled wrought-iron float-box, to obviate the difficulties noticed in regard to that part of the self-registering apparatus at this and other stations. Reconnaissance.-Iu September, 1876, Assistant S. C. 1\IeCorkle resumed tlle examination for Rtations of triangulation to connect the primary work in the Shenandoah Yallry with points on the Obio Rirnr, across 'Yestern Virginia. The region of the Kanawlrn Rh-er wa-s traversed, but no suitable point east of the Elk was fonnd for extending the scheme of t,riangulation westward. In reference to the country west of Charleston, the field report represents that the topography presents natural difficulties to progress in triangulation. "Continumrn ranges of bills and peaks, varying but little in height, and all, or nearly all, heaYil,y wooded, are met in going westward. Every promising peak was visited, and it seems probable tliat lines of ordinary length for primary work can be observed only from elevat<:Jd scaffolds." Toward the Ohio, the prospect seemed e-vcn less favorable for long lines between intervisible stations. The reconnaissance was continued until the end of Nm-ember. Mr. McCorkle, on his return from this section, filed descriptive notes of the region about Table Rock 1\Iountain and Gibson Knob, in Kanawha County; of Pigeou, or ::'.\Iiddle Creek Mountain, in Lincoln County; of Lick Creek "!\fountain, in Putnam County; of Hich Knob, in Cabell County; and near the Ohio HiYer, of 'Villiams' Knob, in \Vayne Couut_y. These notes include the approximate bearings of outlying points; mention of the ebarader of each station ; and the roads and directions for reaching the points mentioned in the list. SECTION IV.
ATLANTIC COAST AND f-\OCNDS OF NORTH CAROLINA, INCLUDING SEAPORTS AND RIVERS.(SKETC!tE8 Nos. 7 AND S.)

Primary triangulation in Yirginia and North Cnrolina.-At the opening of the present fiscal Assistant A. T. Mosman was engaged with his party at .Flat 'l'op (l'eaks of Otter) in extending the triangulation southward along the eastern slope of the Blue lUdge. Rain prevailed at that station in July, 18i6, and the weather proved to be very hazy in .A.ugust; but tl1e measurement of horizontal angles at Flat Top was finally completed on the 2d of September. Buffalo Mountain, lying to the southward and westward, was next occupied with the theodolite, and, under more fa>omble conditions of the atmosphere, the work requisite there was finished on the 16th of October. The camp was then transferred by 1\lr. Mosman across the Blue Ridge t-0 Moore's Mountain, in North Carolina. The necessity for determinations of lat,itude and azimuth at this station involved much labor in th transfer of the instruments to the top of the mountain and in mounting them suitably on stone piers. These requisite preliminaries occupied the party until the 6th of November, 1876, and a few days after the astronomical observations were begun. Generally, the weather was such as to favor the observations that were recorded at night for latitude and azimuth, and to

retard the measurement of horizontal angles; which last-mentioned work -was continued at :Moore's Mountain until the 2ith of December. Immediately afterward heavy snow-storms made the roaus impassable for ten days, but as soon as practicable the instrnmentR 11sed at the astronomical 8tation were 8afely stored at the foot of the mountain. Of the tllree primary points llere noticed, Flat 'l'op Mmmtain i8 about four thousand feet high. Buffalo Mountain ha8 nearly the 8arne elevatiou. 'fl1e height of the ;;t.atiou on Moore's l\Iountaiu is upwards of fifteen hundred feet. I<'rom each of the points vertical angles wert> mea:mred to determine the relative heiglits of outlying stations; and, as usual, horizontal anglt's were recordt'tl to determine the lines of direction to subsidiary objects ti.mt could he rPeognizetl by the obsernrs while they were engagetl at the primary statious. · One of the lines of sight included in the operation~ of the triangulation party of tl1is season is eighty-two miles long, and auother, leading from the same statiou, is sixty-nine miles in leugth. :From his station on Buffalo )fountain, AsRistant :\Iosman exchanged signals with Assistant Boutelle, who, in recent years, has advanced the lll'imary triangulation to the northward and eastwanl from the base-line near Atlanta, Ga. Nine nights were employed at llloore's Mountain for determinations of the latitude and azimuth. For ditrerenee of heightR, ninety-eight sets of ollscrvations, including seven hu11drcd and thirty-seven measurements with the micrometer, were recorded hy Assistant Mosman and the two recorders in the party, Messrs.

Two hundred and fifty-two observations ·were recorded in addition, giviug the direction of subsidiary oltiects from the primary stationR. In April, 1877, Asi;;i;;tant ::\losman reorganized hi,; party, aud ag·ain occupied J\Ioore's :M:ountaiu, at which station observations were completed by the end of l\lay. The instruments were then moved and set up at Cahas station, where observations were in progress at the end of the fiRcal year. The measurements requisite at that point were conclmleu on tl1e 1:3th of ,July, and the statistics are embodied in the synop;;is already given. The expediency of employing, in connection with astronomical azimuth measures, a collimator placed near the theodolite while it is in use for measuring horizontal angles at the geodetic stations, or for using a transit instrument to Rerve both for the determination of azimuth and aB collimator has for some years been under consideration in the office, and from time t-0 time the method bas been urged on the attention of some experienced olJserven;, but has not ~:et heen brought into general use in fi.eld·w6rk. In November and December last, Assistant Mosman put the sugge::>tions into practice at Moore't;; Mountain, using for the azimuth determination the 48-inch transit Kn. 8 of 2;J-inch aperture, fitted with au eye-piece micrometer-screw. The instrument was mounted in the meridian of the geodetic station on a solid pier, with a rock foundation, and only seven and a half feet distant from the theodolite which was in m~e for measuring the horizontal angles of the triangulation. Merely as an additional test in details of the method, and for the alignment of tlie transit, l\Ir. Mosman directed tlrn theodolite and transit on an ordinary distant azimuth mark, both instruments being preYiously adjusted for collimation. and moved the transit till its center wire was bisected by the cross in the theodolite, but, as he rem'arks, if full assurance of stability in regard to the transit can be bacl, the azimuth mark may be dispensed with by observing for azimuth with the transit at a time as near as possible to the obsen·ations for horizontal angles, and collimating the two instruments without delay. By the method employed at Moore's station, Mr. Mosman reduced not onl;r the direction to the azimuth mark but also the line of collimation of tile tram;it itRelf, to every line of the triangula · tion, and thus obtained two results for azimuth, one on the mark in the usual way, and the otht>r on the transit itself. He further remarks:

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

"Now, if the transit remained .~table, by making the proper correction for its azimuthal deviation, a secoml result is obtained, and by comparing mean results from all the observations of azimuth during the night, reduced to any station by the theodolite, in all the twenty-three different positions used, we have a test of the amount of change in the direction of the transit." The two azimuthal results proved fairly accordant, the difference being 0 11 .36 as found by Assistant C. A. Schott, chief of the computing diYision, but in this case a theodolite was used that requirell a large number of positions of circle ou account of tlie graduation, as stated by tlie obser>er. Under the head of Section X mention will be made of the determination by Assistant Davidson of azimuth by means of a second telescope used as a collimator. In imch case the collimator iR not of necessity placed in the meridian of the geodetic station, as when properly adjusted it becomes a complete substitute for the distant azimuth mark heretofore used by obserYers in the field. The principle relied on in substituting for the distant mark a collimator, whether that be,a plain telescope, a transit instrmnent, or merely an object lens supplied with focal threads, and provided that its stability can be insured, is the fact that the cross-threads become the best and most. convenient reference mark for azimuth that could hy any possibility he })l'Ocnred. Coast Pilot.-As already mentioned under a preceding head in Section III, the special examinations and compilation of sailing notes and descriptions for the Coast Pilot were continued after ,January, 1877, by Lieut. Frederick Collins, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast Survey, with a party in tlle schooner Palinurns. From Baltimore that officer proceeded directly to the coast of Georgia~ and afterwards along the coast of South CaroliTia, and was there engaged until the 17th of Jnne, as will be mentioned in more detail under the head of Section V. In this section Lieutenant Collins subsequently examined the coast from Hatteras to Oregon Inlet. At the end of the fiscal year the vessel returned to Baltimore and was refitted for service in Section III. Masters Francis Winslow and A. II. Cobb efficiently aided in the work of the season. Jfydrogmphy.-In five localities of this section the hydrogTapl1y has been extended hy Lieut. Richard Wainwright, U.S. N., Assistant in the Coast Surrey, with a party in the steamer Arago. Between the !!u of November, 187u, and the 12th of l\Iarcli following, the work was advanced in the northern part of Pam11lico S<oamu. Vl'ith a se11arate projection the vessel then proceeded to Ocroooke Inlet, aud was there employed until the 12th of April. The remainucr of that month was occupied in sounding Hast I1ake, one of the branches of Albemarle Sound. H,Ydrographic work was begun by the party in Currituck Sound on the 4th of l\lay and completed in ,July, after which additional soundings were made in North Lauding Hi'i'er.

Latitude and azimutlt.-For the determination of azimuth at stations of the triangulation of Pamplico Sound, ,'.'I, C., a party in the schooner Uaswell was organized in July, 1876, to work under the charge of Subassistant Edwin Smith. The vesRel left Norfolk ou the 1st of August, but being delayed by head winds was unable to reach the station at Hog Island until the 7th of that month. The observations made between that elate and the 28th of August were: "Twenty-nine observations of thirteen stars on seven nights, to derormine the rates and cor· rections of the chronomewrs. Sixty-seYen o11servations of sixteen pairs of stars were made on sewn nights to determine the latitude of the station. Fourteen sets of observations of six measures each were made on four nights for the azimuth of the line from Hog Island to Ocracoke Light." "At this station observing was attended with many difficulties. The island is marsh, covered with a dense growth of reeds, below the roots of which the mud is very soft.

On the platform the ouserver moved a1iout with gTeat can·, so as not to <listnrb the instrument, hnt all other persons on the island were required to remain as quiet as possible. In thi:; manner the time aml latitude obsen·ations were recorded with good results.'' At Hog Island the azimuth observations wen' made from the top of the tripod signal, which was occupied for the triangulation i11 1870. As the telescope wa8 more than fifty feet abo,·e the ground, azimuth observations could lw recorded only when the nights \wre calm; but hy using· all precautions agaim;t llisturlmnce, Snhassistant Smith obtai1wll re:-;nlts "hich Laye 1n·on~<l satisfactory. The astronomical party was transferred to the io;t.ation at J,ong Hhoal Point on the l:-;t of Heptember, aud there the work was completed on ibc 22d of that moutl1. "Thirty.four 01Jsenati01rn of tweut.r-two stars were made ou seveu nights for corrections arnl rates of the chro11ometers; sixty-nine obserYatio11s of sixtf'en pairs of star8 were recorded 011 fiYf' nights to determine the latitude of tbe station, and eighteen sets of ohserYatious of six rneasurei-< eaeh were reconled on fi,·e nigLt8 for determining t11c azimuth of the Iiue from Long Shoal Point to Sandy Point.

Rydro,qraphy of Core liound, X. 0.-For completing the snrve;y of Core Sound, a party was organized by Lieut. J. F. :Moser, U. S. N., Assistant iu the Coast Suryey, on board the steamer Fathomer, aml reached the working ground in the middle of December, 1876. Operations were begun immediately, but were frequently interrupte<l by the unusual severity of the weather. At one time during the stay of the party the sound was frozen over from bauk to hank, and on seYeral occasions the work was prosecuted in open boats while the temperature was only 3."i° Fahrenheit. Having identified the station-marks of the triangulation adjacent to his work, Lieutenant Moser carefully replaced them, and secured, b.r additional marks, such points as seemed t-0 he in dauger of displacement, by setting in the ground heayy cedar stubs with the usual center mark. Harbor Island Bar had been sounded in a. previous season, but a new channel having brohn through during the heavy gale of September, 1846, the bar was rnsurveyed by the party in the Fathomer. From that limit, after connecting properly with the work in Pamplico Sound, Lieutenant Moser extended the hydrography southward to Piney Point, on the south side of Nelson's Bay. Late in February, the work was there joined with the hydrograph_y of the lower part of the sound, which had been executed in the pre·dous season. Lieutenant; 1\foser states, in his concluding report, that he waB ably seconded in all the operations of the season by Master J.B. Murdock, U. S. X, and :Ensign 0. ·w.

After completing the surrny here under notice, the steamer Fathomer was passed to the south'mrd of Beaufort, :X. C., for service, which will be mentioned under the next head. Hydrograpliy of Bogue Sound, K. 0.-For the completion of soundings in the inlanu waterllassagc west of Beaufort, X. C., the party of Lieutenant 1\Ioser was transferre(l from Core Sound, where it had been employed witll the steamer :Fatl10mer until the close of February, 1877. In Bogue Sournl,'hydrographic work was resumed on the 15th of March, and, '\ith slight interruptions, -was continued until the 21st of April, when soundings were completed. The hydrography is comprised between Mill Point aml Bogue Inlet. In regard to the tides of Bogue Sound, J,ieuteuant Moser remarks: "The tides are received from Beaufort Inlet as far as Broarl Creek with height and velocity Yarying with the distance from the entrance. Between Broad Creek and Fresh "\Vater Point the tiues meet, and to the westward of Fresh Water Point the tide from Bogue Inlet is receiveu. A southwest -wind causes a low tide; a northeast, wind makes a high tide." l\Iaster Murdock, r. S. N., assisted in the hydrographie work in Bogue Sound.

Primary triang1dation.-For extending the primary triangulation through South Carolina in a direction northward and eastward from the Atlanta base, the party of Assistant C. O. Boutelle again took the field in June, 187G, near Spartanburg, in the northern part of tha.t State. Upon the roof of Wofford College an observing tripoli and scaffold had been erected by permission of tlie collegiate authorities, and thus was established the only point suitable in that region for contlncting the primary triangulation across the boundary into North Carolina. The high signal at Wofford having been observed on last year from three of the stations then occupied, one of the observers of the party was sent to adjust the several signals, and arrange for their aeeurity while observations were in progress at the station on the college. Mr. H. \.V. Blair erected a li!ignal at

the primary station Benn, and also on Mount Mitchell, or t11e "Black Dome," in "Xorth Caroliua, the recorded barometric height of wl1ich is 6,707 feet above the level of the sea. H~- angular mcaRurements made in the course of the season the position of that mountain was approximate}~- dt·h·rmined. At 'Vofford observations were commenced on the 6th of .Tuly, 187(), witll the 20-inch themlolite, the instrument lJeing on a platform, ninety-eight feet aboye the ground on "-hich the eolleg-e lmilding stands. From that height the signal on King's Mountain wa~ clearly visible onr thP intervening ridge. The measurement of horizontal angles was completed on the ith of Augm;t. Additional observations were made in order to free the resultR from the effect of any waHt of stability in the structure which supported the theodolite, and from t!Je effect of heat on the lJrick walls that sustained the temporary scaffol<ling. \Yhile observing vertical ang·les one person watched the level while another re-0orded, neither of them moYing until the entry was complete. "~otford station was marked by hnrying four stone posts in the college grounds, two of them 1-;outh and two east of the station point. Deep diagonal grooYes are cut in the lieads of the posts, and lines d1·awn throngh the intersection of the diagonals will meet at tlw station, on the site of the college, if the lmilding should ever be removed. For many courtesies during the nccupanc_y of the station the party was indebted to the president of the college, Prof. J. II. Carlisle, and also to the Rev. Dr. -Whiteford Smith, aml Professor Dn L're. At this station six primary signals were observed on, aml for approximate position and elevation, twenty-two subsidiary objects. _AJkr closing observations the instruments were transferred to Hogback l\lountain, wl1ere angular mea1<urements were begun on the lfith of August. The weather proving exceptionally favorablf", all requisite obsernLtions were completetl hy the 2d of September. /~t this station the signal on :Mount J\Iitchcll, which is iirolJably the highest snmmit in the Fnit<·1l State:; ca:-;t of the H<wk~1\Ionntaius, wa;,; wdl seen and cai.:efully obse1Tctl on, as were also sen·n primary sig11als of the triangulation, arnl for approximate position and clcyation fort~--fonr subsidiaQ- ol_\iects, inclmliug many of the highest mountains in North Carolina. The station on Hogback ::\fountain is marked by five istone posts, the positions of which are carefnll,r described in the reconls. Jn order to improve the scheme of triangulation, Assistant Boutelle dett>rre<l operations at King's Mountain, an!l passed on to Young's J\fountain, in hope of finding it practicable as a statiou visible from King's and from other 1irimary point.":. At Young's an obsen-ing scaffold fifty feet 11igh was erected, and when the theodolite was in place all the signal:=;; connecting with it were in view. Ilorizontal and vertical ohserYations were complet~tl at Urnt station on the 11th of November. }~ight primary points and thirteen snb;;idiary object._.;; were ohsen·e<l on. Assistant :Mosman then at Buffalo Mountaiu exchanged signals with the party ou Young's Mountain. The distance between the two primary stations is nearly seventy-four miles. Five stone posts were set in tht\ usual manner to mark the triangulation point at Young's. Azimuth observatious were made upon Polaris as heretofore. ]<'or latitude forty-two pairs of stars were observed in two sets, one being observed by )Ir. Blair, the other by Mr. J, B. Boutelle. Having transferred his party to King's l'.f ountain, Assistant Boutelle conunencetl obserrntion;. there on the 2Hth of November, but bad weathe:i; frequently recurred after that date, and in the mouth following, signals only forty miles distant coulcl rarely be seen. As a consequence the measurement of horizontal angles could not be completed before the close of the working seasOll. During the dull weather, however, arrangements were made for determining the fatitude. By the two aids, forty pairs of stars were observed in two sets, between the 4th and 14th of December. Azimuth observations were deferred, as no good image of the star could be obtained in the mercurial horizon, the narrow rocky crest at the station point being jarred by the winter winds. On the 24th of December snow' fell on King's Mountain to the depth of a foot. Storm suceceded storm, and the party was detainell at the summit, the eleYation of which is 1,700 feet, until the 6th of January. In the eourse of the winter the records and computations of the work were completed and sent to the office. Assistant Boutelle resumed field-work on the 30th of April, 18i7. After adjusting and securing the signals to be observed on, the camp was again pitched on King's llfountain, but it became almost immediately necessary to remove the instruments and equipage. Fire, carelessly left b~' bee-hunters, started at the southwest base of King's Mountain, and rapidly swept towards the sum-

mit, bringing into jeopardy the persons of the party and the property in their care. This unmmal condition of dauger continuerl for tliree days and uig·hts, hut by constant exertion all loss was tinally averted. During thirty consecutive da~·s ending with the 7th of June no rain foll. aml the mountain was enYeloped in smoke and haze. Distant signals could uot he seen, hut the night ohi,;ervatious were less hindered. A good azimuth was obtained between 1\fay :w and the 2d of June; thirty-three series were observed. The azimuth here noticed giyes a connectt>d chain of azimuths at each end of a series of geodetic lines extending from the Atlanta base to l\Ioore's Mountain, in North Carolina, a distance of more than three hundred miles. This sweep of triangulation i:;kirt;.; the soutllern and eastern flank of great mountain masses tlJat attain their maximum height in ~Western North Carolina. The azimuths, as noticed hy Assistant l3outelle, are a fine exhibit of s.vstematic local deflections of the force of gravity, or, as more comrnouly stated, of the direction of the plumb-line. He Rtates the results for each of seYen astronomical azimntl1s, and the discrepancy of ten secomhl between the most southern arnl most northern of the series he ascribes to local tletlections. Dividing into three groups, the first. and last showing two azimuths each, and the middle one three azimuthal results, he observes "that the mean of each group is larger than the preceding, showing a i:;tcady twist of the gcorletic cmTe or north meridian towards the west (in the direction of the mountain masses), as the ohser.-ations go easterly. 1t will be noticed that the first gTonp (azimuths at the base an<l at tlawnee Rtation) ha\'e tlw monntain masses hearing northeast of them; that the middle group (azimuths at Cnrrahee, Paris, and King) wouhl be afl:'ectetl about erptall,\·; while the two azimuths of the tllird group (Young and :Moore's) have the masses bearing i:;ont.hwci:;t of them, with the center of the area nearly at the same distance from a i1oi11t mid way from Young station to ~Ioore station, and from Sawnee station to the Atlanta base." At the southwestern station;.; the smaller azimuths, as compared with a rneau of all the azimuths referred t.o one li1w, which is about midway in the chaill of fjnadrilaterals, indicate that the zenith is detlected to the westward, whereas at the northeastern stations the azimuths being g-reater indicate that the zenith is deflected to the eastward. These facts seem to be accounted for by the local attractions of the mountain masses to the westward of the system of triaug;ulation that follows the Blue Hidge from Yirginia to Oeorgia. \Yhen the fieltl-work is complete, these and like deflections in the observed latitudes and longitudes will he thoroughly tlii:;cussed in the computing division of the office. Having previously provided magnesium lamps, ARsistaut Iloutelle made arrangements early in ,J uue for using them for the measurement of horizontal angles, the record of which had been much delayed at King's Mountain, and frequently at other stationg. :l\Ir. Blair having re;ioiuecl the party was sent to the station on \Y offord College. The magnesium lamp was adjusted there for the direction to King's Mountain, thirty-nine miles distant, and was readily obsernd on by Mr. l3outelle throngh the telescope of the theodolite. On the 19th of June :l\Ir. Blair showed signals with the same lamp from Paris l\Iouutain, nearly sixty-five miles distant. The light was always sc<>n through the telescope at King's, and during periods of greatest brilliancy was visible to the uaked eye. The difficulty generally found in regard to steady deliYery was so far remedied hy Mr. l3lair that during the last half hour of bis oper~tions on Paris ~fountain tile lamp was intrusted to the heliotroper, who succeeded well in showing a signal with t11e lamp. At both stations the magnesium rihhon was burned in the focus of an eight-inch paraboloid reftector, and the clock was adjusted to deliver the ribbon at the rate of fifteen inchers 1>er minute. The measurements of' horizontal and Yertical angles on the outlying primary stations, and subsidiary OQjects in view from King's Mountain, were completed on the 27th of ,June. Assistant Boutelle tllen remo\·e<l the in;.;truments to the mountain sta1ion Benn in North Carolina, and in ,J nly resumed operations, of which notice will he taken iu my next. annual re110rt.

Fernandina had been decided upon at the opening of the fiscal year, but the arrangcnwnts re()L1isitc for commencing the record of observations at the station were not then complete. The uew gauge was therefore sent to Philadelphia, and appeared i11 the Centerrnial Exhihition, with other instruments and apparatm; belonging to the Coast Surn~'· Early in March hist, Mr. H. S. AYery, of the Tidal Division of the office, having pre>iously packed and shipped the tide.gauge for Feruandina, proceeded to that port, and on arriYal called upon the Ilou. D. L. Yulee, whose wharf, at the foot of Beech street, was found to he Rpecia.lly favorable as a site for tlte ticlal station. \Yith characteristic courtesy, a place was assigned for the structure and all needful assistance in its erection was tendered uy Mr. Yulee. After the erection of the tide-house and tlie establislunent of the gauge inside, :Mr. Avery securely placed three bench-markR on Beech street. One of these, at tl1e intersection of Second street, coincides with the top of a piece of hard-burnt drain-pipe, al.lout three feet long, set upright in the ground; another was made b;y setting upright in the ground, near one of the pi.ers of the verandah of the Egmont Hotel, near its southwest comer, a cut block of granite; and for the third, copper nails were driven, at the level of the top of the granite hlock, into the trunk of a water·oak tree which stands two hundred and twenty feet westerly from the second, or granite bench-mark. Apart from the self-registering gauge, and separate from each other, two tide-stafl:8 were set up in places convenient for observing. These, as at other self-registering stations, will serve for recording during any emergency that may require the repair or removal of the self-registering apparatus. From the several bench-marks, Mr. Avery carefully leveled to each of the tide· gauges aud recorded the height of each bench-mark above the zero of the gauge. When the meteorologica:I. instruments were securely fixed in place, l\fr. ll. ,V. Bache, as observer, took charge of the station.

McGirt's Creek, which enters the riYer on the western side, a fow miles south of ,Tacksonville, was snrYeyed and sounr1e<l in connection with tl1e work done in this part of the Saint .Joi.m's. In the conrse of the month of Noyember the topograp1tical snrn·y of the banks of the riYer was brought to Buckley's Bluff. 'l'he triangulation was resumed at J\fandariu Point in December, aml thence on until near the close of the season tlle several branches of work adYanced together. At the end of l\fay the plane-table smTey had been extended to Patricio Point; the hydrography was brought t-0 the same limit early in J unc, and by the close of the fi;;cal year the triangulation had been carriell as far south as Tocoi, or about ten miles beyond the limits of work on the plane-table and hydrographic sheets. Among the topographical details mapped this season are the wharf-lines of the city of Jacksonville, 1\IcGirt's Creek and its branches, Doctor's I .. ake, Julington Creek, Black Creek, and Governor's Creek. Generally all tixed ohjects found within a mile of the shore-line are represented ou the plane-table sheets. Two Yillages, Mandarin and Green Cove Springs, appear, and a much larger aggregate in roads than is usual withili the same limits in southern sections. The soundings made in the riYer will be plotted as soon as possible. In reference to the channel, Assistant Ogden remarks that the h;nlrographic work of this season developed onl,r one middle grournl, and that the channel, as far as sounded, is clear from a point about one mile south of ,facksonville. The middle gronn<l here mentioned is a narrow ridge lying north and south with only about four feet of "·ater on it at low tide. The channels on either side haYe a depth of two fathoms or more, and the chart will probabl.Y show a channel of good width without obstruction between the middle ground and Hogarth's Bay. A8 being somewhat exceptional in river beds, 1\[r. Ogclen notes also that a number of deep holes were de>eloped by the Rmmdings. Twenty-nine miles of the course of the Saint Jolrn's will he represented b~· the resulting sheets of the season. l\laster A. C. Dillingham, U. S.

N., Assistant in the Coast Survey, was furnished with a pr~jection from the office, and sailed from Norfolk with his party, in the steamer Bache, on the 24th of September, 18i6. As soon as practicable, signals were set up along the coast between the intended limits of work, but these preliminaries were interrupted by the hurricane of October. At intervals, soundings were recorded in the course of tlrn winter, but the weather was generally unfaYorable for operations afloa,t. Many signals cast down by storms were several times repla-0ed. Whlle the hydrography was in progress, the tides were observed at Saint Augustine and also at a station on the north side of Mosquito Inlet. The lines of soundings run between the two inlet.a extend from the coast to seaward, several of them going to a depth of thirty fathoms. In a future season these will be crossed by Jines par-

Arrangements were made for rrnmming work at th1~ opeuing of the fiscal yEar, but tlie prevalen<'e of ;rellow fever on several routes to Jacksom·ille, and the difficult,'\· of finding means of trans11ortation between the Saint .John's and Indian Rivers, caused dela,y, so that operations could uot be resumed until the middle of September. Subassistant Joseph Hergesheimer, with the party in the sloop Steadfast, set up signal8 needed for tbe triangulation on the outer coast and along the shon·s of llauana Hiver abreast of Cape CafiaYeral, and was joiued hy Assistant Hosmer on the Ulth of October. The night of tliat day and morning of the 20th were marked iu the record of the season by a terrific lrnrricane, which destroyed all the signals and greatly imperiled the lh·es of the party and the safety of the Yes·wl. Field-work was resumed on the 23d of OctoLer and was continued until the 11th of the following May, when the detailed smTey had lJeen achanced to }10ints twent;y-four miles south of Cape Canaveral. Besides the outer coao;t, hoth shores of Bauana Hiver were mapped with the })lanetable; also the shores of New Found Harbor; and a sketch was made of Indian River correspond· ing with the limits of the snn-ey below Cape Caiiavera1. The lower part.s of Banana River and Indian River were developed by soundingo;. It will be seen by the statistics that, notwifustanding frequent interruptions by stormy weather, good progress was rnade by the party.

.Survey north and south of Cedar Keys, Fla.-The SllI'Yey of the western coast of the Florida peninsula has been advanced by extending the triangulation southward from Horseshoe Point to Cedar Keys, aml from thence eastward to the mouth of 'Yaccasassa Rfrer. The topographical survey and hydrography have been completed within the same limits. Assistant }'. Perkins resumed work in this section with his party on board the schooner Ready, on the 3tl of October, 1876, and closed work in July of the prel'lcnt year, after the measurement of a test base on Daughtry's Island in Cedar Keys Harbor. In passing along to the southward from Saint Mark's a material change was noticed in the characteristics of the coast on nearing the Suwanee Hirnr. ''The shore-line is more broken and is fringed with innumerable islands and keys. A series of reefs runs nearly parallel with the coast, and outside of the reefs the Gulf bottom is very irregular. Deep channels run in different directions, and shoals of considerable extent rise abruptly to the surface from deep water. The almost unbroken line of reefs that commences about two miles northwest of the Suwanee River stretches to Cedar Keys, a distance of about twelve miles, and forms a considerable bay of shoal water. Directly off the eastern mouth of the river the reef has gained about ten feet to· seaward in the course of the past year, and although this is probably more than the average growth, the fact that the oysters are all dead in the river slope, while those in the outer slope are alive, seems to show that for the present a steady change is going on in that direction." The lines of soundings were extended from the shore-line about ten miles into the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The results show that neither labor nor pains have been spared in the development of shoals and channels. On reaching the vicinity of Cedar Keys from the west.ward, Assistant Perkins connected his work with the survey made some years ago of that locality, and then joining on the eastward extended the work of the year so as to include part of "\Vaccasassa Bay and its approaches. The details of the field-work serve for the delineation of thirtJ·.two mi.Jes of the coast above and below Cedar Keys. .A synopsis of statistic:; is appended:

Hydrography of Saint Andreu"s Bay and the Gu~f Goa.st of Florida.-Lieut. R. D. Hitchcock, U. S. N., Assistant in the Coast Survey, with his party in the steamer Gedney, arrived at Pensacola on the 20th of November, 1876. Before taking up work to the eastward, for which projections had been made, some additional lines of soundings were run for developing the approaches to the bar of Pensacola entrance. After their completion signals were set up along the beach east of Choctawhat~hee for a distance of seventy miles. This part of the work involved much labor, and the necessity of moving from point to point, during several months, along the beach, as lumber could nowhere be brought to the shore from the interior. Preparations for sounding were finally completed early in April, ud either of the numerous signals which had been put in position could

be seen in clear weather for at least ten miles off shor(·, in the Gulf of Mexico. 11Inch 1iad weatlwr occurred in the course of the winter, tending to retard the hydrograph;.~, hut all fa:rnralJ!e interyalR were employed in sounding until the close of tltc season. In March tind April many of tlie sig1ials were totally destroyeu by hea,7 gales which swept ihe coast with unusual seYerity, nuwy honRt''at Pensacola being at the same time uuroofed. 'l'he fifty.four signals required for sounding in Saint Andrew's Bay were made entirely of trees cut by the party. Until the 1st of ,Tune tlie steamer was engaged, with a ste;nn-lanuch iu compau.r, iu rnnui11g lines of soundings normal to the coast between Choctawhatchee and Saint Andrew's entrance, depths being recorded out to ~· distance of tea miles from the beach. The h,v(lrograpl1y along the coast was extended so as to include the approachei-1 to Saint Amll·ew's Bay, the waters of whicl1 were developell by souudin~s in the latter part of the season. Iu reference t{J it Lieuternmt Hitchcock says : "Saint Andrew's Bay is a most beautiful Rheet of water, and e\·erything about it is pleal'ing to the eye. Jt, abounds in fish of a11 kinds, arnl o~~i,;ters. Large quantities of pompano, Spa11i1'li mackerel, blue fii,;h, rctl fish, grouper, sea trnut, and mullet are taken. Oystcrn found in the eastern part of the bay are eaten at all times of tl!e year, lmt those of the north and west parts ouJ,,· during the winter months. "During summer the shores of tile hay arc resortet1 to h;.· families from Xortltern Florida aud Southern Georgia, who thus aYoid tlie i11trn1Kc heat of the interior, and the Ko-callml .m'amp /crer, a fatal disease that prevails in hot weather at places on!~- sixty miles from the Gulf coast. Saint Andrew's Bay is said to he one of the healthiest placeii along the Gulf of )lexico. The climate iu winter iR delightful, aml in Kummer, though the air is alwayK warm, the wiml blows almost constantly from some southerly direction dnrillg the day, arnl b~- this wind tlw temperature i,,; kept down." To the westward of the general limits of his h,YdrogTaphic work, Lieutemrnt Hitchcock den;]. oped off Santa Hosa Island some depressions in which the deptli of water is seyentel'n fathomR, or considerably greater than the average depth along that part of the Gulf coast. '\Vhile souudings were iu progrelis the tides were obsen-ed at the wharf uear :Fort Pickens, and for the hydrography of Saint Andrew's Bay, at th1·ee points on its shores. Upwards of sixteen thousand observations were recorded. Specirnem; of the bottom, lJrought up iu soumliug, were preserved, and the temperatures of the water there and at the ;mrfacr were rrcorded.

Page took the field in tllc middle of June, and continnerl work until the 13th of Octohcl'. Additional ground was examined for extending the triang·ulation. One of the lines selected for a base was measured approximately and was joined with the nearest stations of the scheme of work in the vicinity of Shelby City. In the mnge of ninety miles between CumlJerlantl Gap and Lancaster Court-House, three quadrilaterals and two triangles have been laid ont. 'l'he lines vary in length from fourteen to forty-seven miles, and the altitudes of the ~tati01rn range between 9j6 feet aud 3,460 feet, as determined by means of the barometer.

through the district in which the work lies, remarkable discrepancies in existing maps, in regard to topographical features, were apparent. These errors ha,-e been the subject of previous mention, and are thus referred to again by Professor Page in his last field report: "To give an idea of the inaccuracy of the best existing maps of t!te Stat{', the sketch of my work, which falls within about twenty-five hundred square miles, was reduced to the proper scale and placeLl upon the corresponding part of the g·eologieal map so a,,; to coyer what purµorts to he the general topography of the same region as given on the geological map. 'l'he discrepancies are very striking, but it seems vrohable that the tlelineation is most defective in the tract included in recmmaissanee. 'fhe State geological snn·ey is eudea>oriug to represent the topography of parts of the State, but is necessarily dependent upon the triangulation for the proper connection of the detacl1ed surveys. l'.Iappecl in patches and with whateYer degree of accuracy, the general result would of course be such as appears in the region between Cumberland Gap and Lancaster, in which the relations in distance between r1rominent topographical features haye not lieeu adjust{)d by means of a previous triangulation." The progress of the work in Kentucky aml in other States, in regard to the determination of points, has been carefully scanned by Assistant Richartl D. Cutts, with whom the sen;ral observers communicate directly a,; they have need of addce in the details of field-work. 'Triangulation in Tcnnessee.-The work of determining poiuts in the State of Tennessee was commenced by Prof. A. II. Buchanan on the 9th of August, 1876, and at favoralJlc intervals wa:.; prosecutetl until the entl of June, 1877, l1y that obsen-er, with thoroughness, rapidity, and ecouom;y. East and west through the region of about one humlrctl and sixty miles, between ~ashville arnl Knoxyille, an exeelleut sche111e of triangulation has been laid out after thorough and patient examination of the eountry. 'l'he ground passed oYer does not afford go()(l sites for base-lines, but is otherwise favorable for geodetic operati0ns. Near Lebanon l>rofessor Buchanan selected and reported a site of a line that woultl admit of measurement, and tlrnt would also connect readily with the triangulation. This site, as being probably the only one aYailaulc for the work, was visitetl l'y Assistant Richard D. Cutts, near the end of Nm-ember, 187G, anrl after careful consideration, antl com11arison with seYeral other sites pointed out by Professor Buchanan, was adopted. It was then arranged with reference to tlie measurement of the base in the ensuing summer, that faYorahle intervals were to be employed in clearing the summits in tlie vicinity, for connecting the c11d,,; by migular mca,;urement with stations of the quadrilateral near Lebanon. Thi,,; wa:s <lone at the opening of the pre:.;eut season. Profe;;8or Buchanan also placed underground all(l surface mark,;, and over tllelll erected signals. I~or such details .Assistant Cutts haying giyen all needful information, aml also in regard to clearing and marking the line for actual measurement, returne1L to other duties in December, antl in the following J\Iay, after forwarding from the office the sixrneter iron contact slide-rods, again repaired to Lelianon. Professor Buchanan had completed all the requisite preliminaries. The hands selected by him, and to be relied on for the movement of the bars, were i111mediately drilled by Assistant Cutts. The measurement of the line was begun without !lelay, and went forwal'd to the entire satisfaction of that experienced officer. Arrangeuwnts for his ow11 ileltl-party being then in progress, Mr. Cutts proceetled to Section I, leaving the c:ompletion of the measurement in charge of Professor Buchanan. The ·work on the line was closed in ,June last, giviug for the length of the base 7,282.ll meters, or rather more than four and a half miles. All the records of the work have been received, and fonnd to he satisfactory. Reconnaissanee.-Wheu my last annual report closed, Assistant F. r. Webber was in the field with his party south of Iluntsville, Ala., and had erected signals on !toe's Mountain antl Warnock's Knob, two stations lying westward of the points to which the triangulation bad been extended from the base-line near Atlanta, Ga. Difficulties peculiar to this region have been met in the prosecution of field-work, and from the nature of the ground can be only partially overcome. The mountain ridges being very nearly equal in height, this district presents few of the advantages for triangulation that are to he expected and are generally found in a hilly country. The pfau of work calls for a chain of quadrilaterals t-0 go westward across the mountain ranges, and hence ou1'>tacles have be~n encountered of necessity that would not ha-ve interposed if the work was to be pushed in the direction of the mountains. After great labor, Assistant Webber selected stations for carrying the triangulation to points westward. of Decatur, and in doing so found that

The main ollstaeles are the Saud 1\Ionntain plateau, ten mile:> cast of G unter'8 ::\Iouutain, and a ridge to the Wl'8twan1 of that tria11g11lationpoint. The party con tinned iu the field until the dose of the year, and as far as in·aeticahle eompleted a 8cheme for three additional quaurilaterals.

The steamer ]Hake was then t\\"O Jnmdred and fifty-1-dx miles westward of Cape ·nomano, aud the intent.ion wai,; to Ronntl on a line going northward. The Rea continued heay~-, but, on the morning of the :!0th of Sm-ember, I.ieutenant-Commander SigRlJee, when about twenty-seven miles to northwanl, snccee1led in recording a deptl1 of 1,726 fatlioms. Hy using wire, soundings were obtained along this line until the depth waH found to he only one hundred fathoms; and thence on, the ordinary rope was employed, as nsnal. ThiH line of sournlings terminated iu twelYe fathoms near the entrance to Choctawhatchee Bay, on the afternoon of tlle 2'.!d of Novrmher, after a run of two hundred and sixty-nine miles. In crossing the several line8 of soundings i·uu in tlie preYious season hroa<l oft· into the Gulf from the western coast of Florida peninsula, the deptl1s were fouml to correspond well. After small hut needful repairs to the boiler of the steamer at Pensacola, Lieutenant-Commander Sigshee started a line of ~onrnlings, to go sont11ward, from a position near the mouth of l'erdido Itiver, anJ. at the last of twenty-one 1·ositions found the de11th to he 1,52H fathoms. At the outset the temperature of the air was only :380 Valirenheit.. "Little trouble was experienced, excepting· iu the record of water-temperatures. '.l'he surface of the water generally showed Goo, bnt the temperature of the air was generally below 500. The conditions were such that dependence could not be placed on the minimum side of the water-thermometers unless their indicationi;; were below 50°, or whateYer the air-temperature migl1t be; nor on the maximum side, unless it read over 60°, or more than the surface-water temperature. "\Vhen the temperature at any depth was of a degree intermediate between the temperature of the air and that of the surface-water, the reading of the thermometer at that lfopth was erroneous. To meet this difficulty, the thermometers were kept in warm water until the moment of stopping them on tile line when the minimum side had acquired a tem11erature of about 700. On hauling in, if the mercury was not touching tlie· needle, the reading of the minimum side was accepted. By this method water-temperatures were recorded with only an occasional break in a series." The greater part of the line south of J>erdido entrance was run while a heavy "norther" JlreYailed, but however rough tlie sea, the party on board succee1fod, in most cases, in hauling back the heavy sinker wl1ieh was attached to the sounding-wire. While tlle "norther" was yet bl~wing, the course of the vessel was changed to due west at a point one hundred and ten miles to the southward and. eastward of the Delta, aud depths were found decreasing gradually at thirty-six positions interTening between the point of departure aml the meridian of Vermilion Bay. At the western end of this line the course was changed and the steamer passed due north. Sounding&

were taken OH the fifth line, which was terminated in the vicinit,\· of Trinity Shoal, "·here the Blake was anchored on the 7th of December, to await a clear sky for ohseryations. A gale during the following night made the position of the Yessel unsafe, and Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee was conf-ltrained to seek anchorage 11ear Ship Shoal Light·Honsc. 'l'he sixth line of soundings run h,r the part,\· wai,; commenced in the channel uorth of Ship Shoal, antl was extended eastward to the entrance of Soutliwest l'ass, Mississippi Delta. After recording chronometer ouserTations at PHot Town the steamer passed up t~1 New Orleans. l:Jnder conditions the least nnfayoraule that offered iu the course of several weeks, Lieutenant-Commander Sigshefl left the Southwest l>ass on the :nst of December, bnt 80011 pnt hack, thus aYoicling a gale of extreme Yiolence, and remained at anchor off Pilot 'l'om1 until the weather cleared. Ou the 2d of January the Blake again put to sea aud commenced a line of 8oundings which was extended southward arnl \rnst\Yard to the meridian of Ship Shoal. Tlle steamer then proceeded to the Yicinity of Ship Shoal and there started a line to pass due south, on which soundings were COll1J)leted on the 4th of .January. 'J'his line was continued to latitude 270 11', and then turned due west, soundings being carried in that direction somewhat to the westward of the meridian of Oalcasieu Pass, and along tllat meridian to the neighborhood of Calcasieu en1rance. On the line going westward, althoug·h most of the ltydrography during the season had ueen prosecuted in lieavy weather, occurred the> only cast that was attended with the loRs of any wire, and in that. instance the lo8s was due to the drawing of a 8plice, and not to a break of tlle wire. The weight of thirt.r-four ponntls use11 in sournling was in all other caRes drawn np with the wire in depths not greater thau seyen hundred fathoms. Ou the night of the 7tli of .TannaQ· a li1w of soundings was run southward fi:om Sabine Pass, and then due west to the approach of Galveston J1ar. Ahont sixteen miles south of Sabine Pass the depth, at one cast, l'l1owed only four and three-quart~r fathomR, at a position comparing tolerably with that marked on some charts as the site of a suppo;.;ed shoal. On approaching Galveston Ifar the steamer encountered a seYere ''norther,'' but soundings were continued until the Yessel was brought to anehor. LeaYing Gah-eston with hi;; party 011 the 24th of .January, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee developed the Gulf hydrography between Galveston and the month of the Rio Grande by eighteen lines of soundings, the courses of which had been prenously indicated and marked on the project of work for the season. These lines were so arranged as to cross anu verity each other. The steamer then proceeded to New Orleans, and after taking in a further suppl.}· of coal left the Southwest Pass to run southward aml westward. Ten miles from the Delta the current wai,; found to be running west at two knots the hour, but five miles further on the current was northnortheast at less than half a knot. Here the approa-0h of a gale from the southward made it expedient to return to the Delta, and on the way back it was noticeable that tlie rough sea disappeared as the vessel again passed into discolored water. ·with some difficulty, owing to the fog and unusually stroug current, tLe steamer reached Pilot Town and there remained dmiug a stron~ gale from the southward aml eastward. Leaving Pilot Town on the 4th of March with some prospect of good ohservations, a line was sta1tetl southwest so as to cross six other lines of soundings on the run to Sabine Pass. The position of the line was well determined, arnl the soundings showed the same well-defined depressions that had been reported in connection with preYious deep-sea work by the party in the Blake. On this line of fifty-two miles eleven soundings were recorded. The ,·essel was then turned westward, but had made little way when a northeai;terly gale set in. Soundings were however continued in the trough of the sea, all customary data being secured, and good observation:; were obtained for position, but the vessel was of necessity hove to before reaching the end of the intended line. The wind, after repeated changes,. again favoring work, soundings were continued on a line to the northward and westward, and tl1e vessel finally anchored in nine fathoms. Goad observations were recorded at the anchorage for the adjustment of soundings. From this position the line ·was continued to the vicinity of Sabine Pass Light-Hom;e. One of the soundings on this stretch gave only three and three-quarter fathomR, there heing six and one:half fathoms inshore of it. Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee states that the position of this shoal is several miles outside of the range of visibility of Sabine Light.

OF

011 the 8th of March the 8teamer left the anchorage off Sabine Pass, and successfully carried a line of 11oumlingH direct to Cakeston Bar. Continuous bail weather nrnde it impracticable to pro8ecute further hydrographie work during that month, anll, under the necC'ssity of refitting the yessel, Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbcc returned to New Orleans. The Rteamer again left Southwest PaHs early iu Ma~-, anrl sournled southward and westwanl to a 1lepth of eiglit lrnudred and st~vtmt)·-lin' fathoms. Near tlw termination of this line another waR 1·ornnwnced in 1·Jt·y1m hn111lred and senmty-1fre fathoms, and was eoutinnetl due south to the Yucatan l~ank. Four of the somtdi11gs in that run 11how depths of more than two thonsaml fathoms. J,eaYing Alacran, a line was started in longitude 89° west, and was extended nearly five lm11tlred miles westward to the coast of .l\lexico, in latitude :!3:1° north. Fifteen consecutive soundings garn depths of upwards of two thousand fathoms. Starting off Tampico Bar, on the 18th of l\fa;v, soundings were recorded on a course due eaRt to the vicinity of Cay Arenas. Anotlter line was then >;tarted near the Triangle Islands and was extended due west and finished off Tnspan Har, l\foxico. :From flwnce, aftn taking in coal, tlte steamer ran down the coaHt to a poAition north of Yera Cruz, and from that station subsequently sounded eastward acros,.; the Gulf of Campeche to the Yttcatan Bank. Off the rnontl1 of Cazone/'i River Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee determined the position of a fiYe-f'athom bank at about twenty-three miles distance from the anchorage off Tuspan Bar. ~\s seen from the yessel the bottom presented the appearance of coral, but the lead fouled in the attempt to procure a specimen, aml was recon~retl only after corn;iderabl1\ lahor. 111 general tl1e weight u,;e!l in sounding was left at the bottom in deptlt8 gTeater tlian one thousand fathoms, hut in f:.worahl1· instances the sinker \~a:,; ln·ought again on board from depths aH great as seYenteen hundred fathoms. 1n somuling ea:,;t, of\'era Cruz, across the Ba~· of CamprchP, the 11eepc:,;t water found was thirteen hundred and eight fathoms at about a hun<lrml miles from the .:\lexican coast. This line was closed in twenty-fi,·e fathomH on the Yucatan Bank, as before Rtated. rassing on to Alacran, the :,;teamer was anchored insille of the reef on the 6th of .June. After securing obsPr\'ations for positions on the laRt line of son111lings, tlw Rlake ;;tarted from a poKition north of Alacra11, to nm somidings westward along the pamllel of 240 :n' north, tht· dPpth at t;ie first position l1eing two thousand arnl fifteen fathoms. i::le,-euteeu consecutiYe sonrnliugs on this line gaYP npwanls ot' two tl1om;a1Hl fathom;;. The work was continuetl westward, and closed near the eoast of l\lexico in eight fathom8. On the 1~t11 of .June the RtPamer was again got under wa~· and stf~amed 11p the coast to Brazos Santiago. After a short rest at anchorage a line was started off tlte Laguna Madre and was rnu with 801mdings due eastward t-0 the meridian of the }1is11issippi Delta, and closed at a df'pth of sixteen hundred and forty-seyen fathoms. From this position tl1e :Blake started for New Orleans. Good ohserYations for chronometer corrections were obtained at Southwest Pass. Repairs needful to enable the Yesscl to reach Xew York were, complet('(l at New Orleans as soon as pra{~ticable. The ,.;teamer left Pilot Town on the 30th of June, and passing south to the latitude of the last-mentione<l line of somuliugi< reHmned work for ext.elllling the line eastward. Soundings were successfully recorded in an easterl,v run of about two hundred miles, closing in a depth of se\·enteen hundred and ninety-four fathoms. To the northward an1l westward another position wa11 chosen in the merid.ian of Mobile entrance, arul fi:om thence a line was run with soundings tlnc south to the Y ucatau Hauk. 'J'hc deepest water found was nineteen hundred and eighty fathoms. From the bank, soundings were recorded on a northeast line as far as the twenty-fifth parallel. The usual temperature obserYations wert', made, arnl the last thermometer came up from a depth of eight hundred fathoms. J.'rom this position the Blake steamed out of the Gulf and reached New York on the 14th of ,Jul,y. The reports and reeords of the work done hy the hydrographie party in the steamer Blake show that no pains have been spared for securing precision in respect of position and depth. Suc1·ess in the development of the hydrography of the Gulf has been mainly due to the intelligent energy of Lieutenant-Commander SigRbec. Until February last, when coutinued ill-health conNtrained him to seek relief, Lieut. J. :E. Pillsbury, U. S. N., remained as executive officer on board the Blake. He was replaced by Lieut. S . .l\l. Ackley, U.S. N. Lieut. W. 0. Sharrer, U.S. N., and Masters 1\1.1''. Wright, W. E. Sewell, and Henry McCrea, U.S. N., have continued in service during the eutire season. The statistics are:

From the outset the surve:r has been prosecuted iu accordauce with plans and methods furnished h,\· Prof. Henr,\" :Mitchell. The first operation of the present Reason waR the careful topographical survey of tlw new lands which have formed outside of Uuhitt's Gap. Ai,; part of the history of that gap, the ilt>ldreport mentions that in 18!)2 it was merely a boat-passage opened in order to give aecesi,; to oyster lleds which lay outside. The cut was made through a strip of marsh, not over four hnndrell feet wide, that separated the main river from the ocean, about threl', and a half miles above the head of the Passes. At present, as shown hy the sm·vp_v of the year, the gap is over three thousand frt>t wide, with depths of water as great as one hundre!l and thirty feet on the site of the former marsh. Be.rond the gap, new landi,; created by the deposits of mud from the river extend seaward, forming a subsidiary delta, with something like a circular development oyer a radial distance of about four miles. The area of dry land there formed since the opening of tlte gap is threl' thousand two hundred and nineteen acres, and its average elevation ii,; about one foot above ordinary high-water. The whole ii,; curnred with wgetation, mostly reeds, but willows now grow on the parts that were first formed. Assistant Marindin's topographical sheet shows that the new territory is disposed into uroke11 radial strips and islands with water-spaees twice as great in area as the visible land, but the waterspaces, except in the main pass, are very shallow for the greater part of their coursei,;. The maiu pass was carefully sounded, as it has been some time in use for light-draught vessels. 1\Ir. Marindin found the outer bar about two miles l.Jeyoud the limits Qf the land, or six miles from Cubitt's

Gap. '.rhe depth of water on the bar is somewhat less than four feet at low title. In tracing the shore-lines of the other passes and bayous much difficulty was experiencml in passing with small boats. Henee only the main pass of the delta of Cnbitt's Gav wa8 developed by soundings. Iu the :Mississippi RiYer, l\Ir. l\farindin completed soundings between the 11ead of the r>aso:es and the lower side of CL1bitt's Gap. The bydrography done there includes the bed of the river for about two miles of its course, and in reference to it Professor Mitchell points out the fact that the river has one-tenth less area of section below than above the gap. It remains to he shown hy careful comparison with former smTe,\'S whether or not the loss of water through Cubitt's Gap is a probable cause of this relative diminution of section. In Southwest Pass the party of .Assistant Marindin working with the schooner Uesearch extended the hydrographic survey seven miles beyond the limits reached in the preceding season. At nine reaches of the stream, some in the main river and others in Southwest Pass, sections were determined not only by depths but by observing free floats of various draughts for ascertai11ing the movements of the water. The results of these operations will be given when the computations on which they depend have been completed. Similar data, from the work of the preceding seasou, seemed to indicate that a general formula would develop the profiles of cross-sections and the transverse curves of velocity, provided that certain coefficients, dependent upon the radius of curvature in the course of the stream, could be ascertained from observations. Assistant Marindin was efficiently aided by l\fr. John B. ·weir. In .Appendix No. 9 will be found a description of the apparatu1> employed by the party, and by means of which tbe currents were determined at four hundred am! ninety-six positions under and at the surface of the waters of the Delta. Operations in the physical survey were continued until the 13th of August and included the measurement of thirteen short local base-lines. For the current observations sixteen hundred and ten angles were recorded. The statistics of the shore-line Rurvey and h:_\·drograpby are:

Tidal ob.~ert1ations.-Tbc height of the water at ~ew Orleans has been regularly recor<led at intervals of six hours from January, 187~, to January, 1877, by J'ifr. G. Faust. Daily fiuctuatiom; being small are disregarded, but the changes of level due to annual floods, and intervening dQ' seasons, and which amount to eleven or twelve feet, are interesting, and as these changes show a considerable approach to ret,rularity in periods, the records are expected to give data for predicting approximately the state oft.he )fississippi River at New Orleam; throughout the year. Suri1ey of tlw Mi..~sissipp-i Rfoer.-For continuing the detailed survey above Bonnet CaITe, the party of Assistant C. H. Boyd was reorganized in October, 1876, on board the steamer Baton Houge. Triangulation hatl been carried in the preceding season tu l~elle Point. :From that limit it was extended in tbe course of the present season as far up the rirnr i:.s Point Houruas, which is about se\·enty-five miles west of New Orleans. The fieltl-report contain8 the following remarks: "Tbe difficulties encountered in this work, besides such al-! are incident in all regions destitute of natural elevations, are-the twhitiug of tl1e scheme of triangulation to avoid expensh-e cuttings through pr~jecting points of cypress swamp; the high leYeeR coming in the middle of quadrilateralR, being sixteen feet, more or less, in height above fields in which the stationR fall; and the avoidance of numerous buildings and valuable treeH in their vicinity." The topography was resumed in November. Those lands were first surveyed which hall. been flooded by the Bonnet Carre crevasse, and which wm·e trace<l in the spring of 1876. The office has now on file topograpbical and hydrographic sheets showing the conditions of that locality in April and November of that year. :For the detailed work three sheets were projected covering the river to a point near Donaldsonville. These include all surface-featmes on both sides of the river as far back as the forests, making a belt of alx>ut six miles in width. The river-banks are represented as thickly settled, and as presenting the appearance of an almost continuous forest of fruit

The signals were ~-pt standing and the surface marks at the ends of the line had not been dii-tmbed. In company with Assistant J. A.

haze, rain, and snow, a plan of work was rnar1rnd out to lead eastward of Clark's ~lounu and Sugar Loaf, but, on account of the lateness of the season, this could not be Yeritied before the approach of winter. Ju the middle of December Mr. Fairfield returned to the office. He was ag·ain at Saint Lonis iu April, and after Yisiting the projected stations, decided that their iuterYisibility could be ascertained only by lines run with the level. Four stations were tlHt8 connected, liy an aggregate of sixt;y-five miles, with the level. In returning to the initial point by a circuit, the error in leYelling, al-\ shown by the record, was less than two inches. The field-work was closed in ,June. A general examiuation made hy Assh1tant }?airfield, in adnrnce of taki11g np field-duty iu another section, shows that the stationR which he selected in IllinoiR are not obstructed by interYening ridges, and that they will probably he intenisible from ohsening scaffolds of ordinar~' height; bnt aB no appropriation was made for continuing the work after the end of ,Tune, the final adjustment of the scheme of triangles has been of necessity deferred. Trilingulation in Missouri.-I<'or extending the geodetic connection betwef'n the Atlantic a1Hl tl1e Pacific, beyond the limits which had been reached in previous semmns west of Sai11t Vmis, Assistant ,J. A. SnlliYau started from that city early iu September, 1876, and in the course of a mouth made a general reconnaissance of the country westward as far as Pike's Peak. 'l'he region in the Yicinit~· of Fort Scott was carefully examined, and ground l1ctween that point and Kansas Cit~-, with reference tu the Relectiou of stiitionR that would he Yisible from points in western MisRonri. From Kansas City Jlrfr.

Subsequently views were obtained h~ nscending· Gra.'·'s Peak, Bras 1\Ionntain, and )fount Lincoln. Returning hy way of Derwer City, Mr. SulliYau liasse<l scycral days of the early part of October in examining a considerable area of the plains near Ui\'er Bend. Cattle-owuers having thorough knowledge of the region were then on an expedition to "round up" their cattle, and it was found advantageous to accomiiany the part~'· l\Iuch local information "·as thus noted that would otherwise have inYolved labor a111l delay. After Iris return to Saint Louis, :Mr. Sullivan made suitable arrangements for selecting and marking points for triangulation west of the line to which the work had been carrietl b;y Assistant Boyd. From tl.ie stations "Gasconade" and ""\Vinter" the ground was examined westward. 'l'wo points on the Gasconade Hiver were selected for au a<hlitional quadrilateral, and other points iu the same direction as far to the west as Jefferson City. Early in ,January, 1877, the work was discoutinne<l for the season, the roads 11eing then blocked by smrn·, awl the trees ~o co\'ered with ice that they eonld not be used as the ordinary means for overlooking the surrounding country. The following is an extract from the report of Assistant SnlliYan. "The region immediately south of the Missouri River, through which this reconnaissance was made, is traYerseu by the Gasconade and Osage rivers, tributaries of the Missouri, and is hilly and broken iu the extrenw; a collection of densely-wooded ridges without commanding elevations, and thinl;r settled. The greater part of the cultivated laud is along the small bottoms of the rh·ers and their numerous small tributaries. "To aYoid felling trees as much as possible, the reconnaissance was carried on by putting up flags or disti11gnh;hi11g colors in trees or the higher points in the region, and endeavoring from tl1e trees to ascertain the iutervisibility of these points. In obtaining these results seventeen flags were put up in trees at high points, and avenues were opened on two lines across the tops of inter,-eniug ri;lges.'' Early in l\fay of' tlw preRent year Assistant Sullivan resumed field operations, and continued the reconnaissance to the westward of' Gasconade Uiver until the middle of June. In the latter part of that month further examination was made of the country on the line of the Atchison auu Santa Fe Railroad, and also along the linion Pacific to Omaha. Mr. Sullivan returned to "'ashington on the 29th of June. The results of his reconnaissance show that the chief' difficulties in imssing westward of Saint Louis, and by which the progress of the triangulation has been rrt::mle(l, will, to a large extent, disappear in the western part of Missouri, and tlrat it will be feasible to lay out a good scheme of triangles for the geodetic connection as far eastward as the

Halter, who selected sta,tions for carQ·ing the triang1tlatio11 sout.hward. of Corpus Christi Bay. !faying completed his arrangenwnts for resuming :field-work, Mr. Halter again proceeded to this section in the latter part of September, ism. The party was detained upwards of a week at New Orleans in coneequence of existing quarantine regnlationH in the port,s of Texas; but :finally reached Corpus Christi on the l~th of October. ny the dose of that month a working camp was established at the north eml of I>adre Island, anil one of the new stations was connected by angular measurements with the conclmling line of the triangulation of Corpus Christi Bay. Northers were very frequent during the winter, and the weather was such that the signals were rarely intervisible. At all clear inten·als the measurement of horizontal angles was pushed, so that by the middle of .April the triangulation had been adrnuced southward as far as it was found practicable t-0 work from the :first-establh1hed camp. J\Ir. IIalter then transferred. his party to a station twenty miles lower down on the coast, and at the dose of the :fiscal year was engaged at stations on the shores of Laguna Madre, iu the vicinity of the expansion known as Baffin's Bay. The chief impediment to progress is tlte occasional lessening in the depth of water in the Laguna, dependent upon the direction and force of the winds. The statistics of the triangulation are:

Coa.~t rcconnai.~.rn.11ce nortluce.~t of San I>iego, Cal.-For perfecting- the scheme of triang-ulatiou partly laid out in the preceding season, Assistant \I. E. Greenwell took the field at Santa Barbara till the hit of September, ism. Proceeding towards the Sau Dieg-o uountlary, he Yisited, in SUC· cession, the stations which 11ml been selected, aud otlicrs, to inclmle mPans for defining the coastline. Additional points were chose11 for extending the triangulation quite across the boundary ltetween the L"nited States and J\fexico. Tlte region embraced in this reconnaissance was found well adapted for plans of triangulation, aml, excepting for the labor of reaching the stations and the hanl:ship incide11t to their occupatiou, rapid progress could he made with adequate means. From most of the snmmits Yisited by Mr. Greenwell the islands off the coast were in Yiew. One of the stations near the San Diego boundary pron'd to be upwards of ri,ooo feet in height. Standing on that summit, the ollserYer hacl iu full de''"' though one hundred miles distant, the IJeaks of Santa Catalina Island aml of Sau Clemente falallll, the coa:st-line and mountains, the great Colorado desert aml the mountain:s to the eastward of the deRcrt. Bc;rnnd tllese runs the Yalley of the Colorado 1-U>er, respecting which it is noted iu the joumal of the i·econnaii-;sance that a moying Yolmne of smoke was judged as marking- the course of a steamer in passing up the ri\·er. At the close of XoYember, l\Ir. Greenwell had passed oyer all the ground intervening between Santa Barbara and San Diego. On tlie return northward, Le took the road b;y wa,y of San Pasqual and Pala, and again explored the region in which Pa1amar Mountain (4,riOO feet high) is a conRpicuous point. Previous obser,·ations were confirmed, and tllat i;;tatiou was included in the Rcheme of triangulation. A bont two lrnnllred fr~et below the snrnmit a spring of good water n·freshed the party after toiling- mauy 11onrs in tlw asceut. The scheme was yerified by additional tPHto:, and the party pa:-;sed ou to Anaheim, "·hich point "·as reached late iu December. Of all the stations marked, Yer;y few remain in doubt in respect of intervisibility, aml deRirahle conditions are generally fulfilled by the arrangement of the triangles and quadrilaterals. field-operations in this quarter were discontinued in the middle of .January. Topography of Catalina Island, Cnl.-Tbe party of Assistant Stellman Forney was reorganized in the middle of August, 187U, for taking up the topographical survey of Santa Catalina, for which purpose the triangulation had been in part completed in the preceding year. Plane-table work was eommenced at tbe western end of the island, and was prosecuted, at intervals, as far eastward as Goat Harbor 011 the north and I"ittle Harbor on the south shore. Catalina Harbor and Isthmus Cove were included, aml, as usual, the ele,·ations of ground between the shore-lines were repre· seuted by contour lines on the topographieal S'l1eet. In addition to the plane-table work, the triangulation was taken up at the limit reached last year, and was extended to the eastern end of the island. About one-half of the area is shown 011 the resulting topographical sheet of this Reason. The sl10re-line is exceedingly bold, and so difficult of access that its delineation·by means of the planetable would be regarded hy man,\· topographers as impracticable. " Santa Catalina Island lies broad oft' the coast from San Pedro anchorage, at a distance of nineteen miles. The island is t.wenty-one miles long and has an average breadth of three miles. The highest peak on the island rises to an elevation of 2,110 feet." During calm weather, boats ean laml safely at many points both on the Rorth and south shores of the island, and near some of the landings are springs of good water. All are clearly marked on the plane-table sheet. The island is used entirely for grazing, aml is said to be the only one of the Santa Barbara group on which the rattlesnake has been found.

Inspectimi of topography.-After examining the topographical features which border the waterR of WaRliington TerritoQ·, to ·wliich refere11re will he made under the head of Section XL Assistaut II. L. "\Vlliting returned to San Francisco, aJHl exte11ded a reconnaissance northward aloug the coast through parts of l\If'nrlocino aud Ilnmhohlt Counties. Thr dense arnl enormonR timber of tliat reg'ion presents unusual difficulties in fiel<1-operatio1rn. Characteristic localities were thoroug·hl~ examined and described in the final report, which was turned in after his return to the oilier in December, 1876. That report include;; also the results of inspection conducted along the coast of" California, and extended to San Diego. The lack of timher and ground-surface cont-0nr along thf' southern coast are remarked on as in contrast with certain parts of the northern coast. All the considerations, practical and economical, that are of aceouut in devising plans for the survey in reforence to the ground to he represented, are mentimwd in the cmwlrnling report of J\lr. "\Yhitiug. He comments Rpecially on the necessity of' aptitude and J>erception in the topographer wl10 would successfully delineate Rnch coast features as came under his own observation while on reconnaissance. Triangulation of Santa. Barbara Ghannel.-In September, 1876, the party of As.sistant 0. H. Tittmann was transferred to Auacapit Island, and immediate preparatiouR were m:ule for occup~·ing the primary station with t,Jie theodolite. As a means for the needful supplie8 of water and provisions, and for visiting the signals requisite 011 the adjacent islands, the schooner l\latinee was employed temporarn_.,-. Of three heliotro1rnrs engaged for the work, one was stationed on the main at San Pedro primary station, one was placed 011 Santa Barbara falan<l, and the thinl showed signals, when practicable, from a point on San Nicolas Island. On Anacapa Islaml fires had been set hy sheep-owners to clear tl1e ground of weeds, and during an extended period the resulting dust had not heen settled by rain. As :t consequence, the condition of the atmosphere was such that the measurement of horizontal angles coul<l not he completed until the Gth of December. So commonly was the \"iew hid in one direction or rnor{' that, during the stay of the part,y, an unbroken series of angles was mea,sured ou onl.r one day of the season. After completing the requisite observations a Rignal was set up on the highest peak of Anacapa, and approximately determined in position, to furnish a base and direction for the original topographical survey. Lea,ving the heliotrope at San ~icola:;i, Assistant Tittmaun next occupied the station on Santa Barbara Island. On the 25th of December he obse.rved on the signals at San Nicolas and Anacapa, and included in the round of angles two topographical stations on Santa Barbara Island for orienting its plane-table survey. The uncertainty of obtaining additional observations beiug great, Mr. Tittman returned with the schooner to Anacapa on tlle 28th of December, and next day larnkd the instruments and equipage on the main at San Huemweutura. Laguna Station, on the main and opposite to Anacapa Island, was next occu1iied. After closing ohserrntions there the party proceeded in the schooner to Santa Catalina Island, and erected signals on the two ltigltest peaks to serve as a base for the determination of points on San Clemente Island. The aid of the party, Mr.]). B. Wainwright, was meanwhile dispatched with the vessel t,o erect signals on the fast-named island, and to measure the angles. The signals were in place on the 6th of March, hut owing to the prevalence of fog the observations requisite could not be complete<l~ Assistant Tittmanu remained in camp until the 8th of May on Catalina Island, and then closed operations.

To the eastward of J'oint Corn·epcion, J,ieutenant Conrtis joined with inshore work done in a previous year, aml extemlell soundings along· the coast fifteen nautical miles to a junction with the hydrograpl1;y of a preceding 8eason. "Thile this work was in progress, the. tides were observe1l at Gaviota wharf. 'l'he depthR Rhown on tlie two resulting chartH are from six feet to seventy-eigltt fathoms. At the limits of the work, ea::;t and west lines were run quite across tlie channel to Santa Cruz, and al~o towards Sau Miguel falaml. .Lieutenant Court.is remarks as follows on the performaucc of the new steamer during the run between Mare Island and Santa Barbara: "\Ye left San :Francisco on the 3<1 of l<'ebruar_y, a.ml arrived oft' Santa Barbara early on t.he morning of the 5th, after a pleasant trip down.

The ship worked well during the season. No drawback occurred except the loss of the starhoaru anchor on the 6th of March while the vessel was on dut~· to the eastward of Point Ooncep· cion.

Rccnnnai1<sancc.-Iu order to perfoct the scheme of triangulation which had heen in part (lcYeloped hy Assistant \Y. E. Greenwell in the preceding season, he again took the field on the :?5th of l\Iay of the present year. Proceeding from Los Angeles with a Yiew of selecting points that would connect properly with stations which haYe been already occupied at Sau lluenaYcntura aml GaYiota, it was found that the s~m Lucia ::\Iountai11s shut out the i·iew of the coast, uut without 'llfording along the crest of that range lines of imitable length for primaT:Y triangulation. The 1eco11naissance was intended to hring into the scheme, if practicable, a 1piaclrilatcral adjaeent to Point Concepcion, three of its stations heiug quite near to the coast, and the fourth at 'l'epusquet, which is about thirty miles northeast of Cape .Arguello. The month of ,Tune was passed in the endeavor to perfect the scheme, bnt in addition to local difficulties, the constant haze made it impossible to identify distant summits. At the end of June, Assistant Greenwell was :vet in the field, hut was authorized to defer the reconnaissance for the selection of stations until the Jlre\ailiug fogs aml haze had in a measure disappeared.

Geodetfo conncction.-At the opening of the fiscal year te wltich this report corresponds, Assistant George ])ayid;;;on was engaged at Mount Diablo in the measurement of horizontal angles for connecting that statiou with poiuts which had been selected in tlJe Sierra Nevada l\Iountai11s. BxclnsiYe of the azinmtl1-mark, eight, signals were obse1Te<l on, tl1e most distant being one lnm1lred and thirty-cig·ht miles from the theodolite; another was one liumlre<l and twenty miles from 1he ohsener; arnl the remaining six lines of sight aYeraged sixty miles in length. The season is reported as hrwing lieen excessiYely smoky, and tlic observations were, in coni;e1p10nce, dela.'·ed. ::\[eanwhile, howeyer, preparations were made for the latitude, time, and azi· muth observations. The latitude obserYations awl the measurement of Yertical angles from Mount Diahlo were eutrust-0d to Assistant "William Eimbeck, of Assistant Davidson's party. By means of an improved heliotrope, which shone through haze when the top of the mountain on which the instrument was placed could not be seen, Mr. Davidson succeeded in obsening on the most distant stations. Horizontal angles were mea8ured with the 20-ineh theodolite, No. 5. The instrument was used in many positions for the purpose of testing the graduation.

'Ihe customary observations were also made for value of the micrometer, exclusive of many thousand,; for te8ting the parts and graduation of the theodolite. 'Yhile ob8ervations were in progress at .Mount Diablo, the opportunity wns taken, as in otl1er instances, to note tbe direction from that station of t11e principal peaks that could be identified in the Sierra::-\ ev:Hla range of mountains, and thus adding to the lio;t of geograpl1ical positions. For the elevations of the subsidiary points, vertical angles were recorded. After closing the observationR, the trai1sit instrument, zenith telescope, vertical circle, and other instruments, were cleaned aml the chronometers were adjustecl for rate. In preference to trusting the instruments to other hands, l\1r. Davidson himself performed this important adjunct service. In September the instrument,; aud such of the equipage as could not be dispensed with, were transferred to l\Iount Helena, and after great labor were placed in position on the summit. To protect the ohserdng tent from the violent winds by which the others were occasionally torn down, a wall th·e feet high was found requisite on the north side, and another somewhat less in height toward,; the south. By such expedients and close watching the instruments were preserved, although the stoutest of the men employed in the party were frequently blown over by the force of the winds. In October, during a heavy southeast storm, seven and a half inches of rain fell at the observing station, aucl in the Sierra Nevada the summits were coYered liy a heavy fall of snow. The heliotropers at Hound Top, although much exposed and snowed in to a distance of thirty miles from immediate relief, kept at their duty. Arrangements had been previously made by contra.ct with mountaineers accust.omed to snow-shoes, to bring off the heliotropers, if such a{)tion seemed absolutely necessary for their safety. 'l'he great storm was followed by clear weather. Assistant Davidson, by working during every favorable moment, was enabled to close bis obsernitions on the line to Round Top (one hundred and forty-six miles in length) by the 6th of November. The l~ola Mountain heliotropers, fearing i11 advance the consequences of the great storm in October, having left the station, the two who manfully remained and showed signals from Round Top during the snow blockade, readily agreed to do service at Lola, and by great industry they reached that station on the 13th of November.

Snow Mountain the heliotropcr, though aJone and snowed in, branJy kept his post and showed signals when practicable. By thh; steadiuess Mr. Davidson was enabled to close obserYations on the lines to Round Top and Lola on tlic 27th of N O\'cmber. At the station on Mount Helena, in additon to the ordinary elongation mark ahont seYen aml one-third miles distant, Assistant Davidson set np near the large theodolite a collimator for tl1e determination of azimuth. Great care was taken in the construction of the pier of this second telescope, and in regard to its adjustment; and munerons obse1Tatious wen· recorded for indepemlent 'leterminatious of azimuth by the method commonly employed at fiekh;tations, aml also h;y means of the collimator. At permaucut ohserYatories collimating telescopes are in common use. 'J'he only difficulty, and one which hitherto has inclined ficlll-ohscn~crs to prefer the distant azimutlinrnrk, is in obtaining a stable stand for the collimator, so that 1JO change may take place in the interYal between the night observations for azimuth aml the reduction of the azimuth t{) adja-0cnt lines of the triangulation, which last work must be done in the da:r-time. Assistant Da,idson expresses confidence in the stability of the pier wliich supported the collimatur at Helena, aud the hope of obtaining results tliat may warrant the sulmtitution of that methotl for the record of measurements on the onlinary azimuth-mark. The two sets of observations recorded by his 11arty will in due time be discussed under the expectation that as the use of the distant azimuth-mark is not conveuient in the regiou of the Sierra NeYada, the method of oliseniug fur azimuth by meaus of a collimator may be applic!l with foll couti!lcncc in the results. The work at )fouut Ileleua Station included ohse1Tations upou the seYcn prirn:u.Y stations of the triangulation, and also upon Snow l\fountain signal. The elongation mark ohsened on was thirty-two hu11dre1l feet below the ,;ummit of Ileleua. For latitmle four lmudred and thirt;r-ihe observations were recorded dming fin.) nights upon twent.Y·two iiair,; of stars; aml time was a:,;certained from two hundred and sixty-five oh:o;ervations of the tnm:-;its of tl1irty-cight stars. The or· dinary statistics of the geodetic work are thus stated in the field-report: Telescope-readings for lwrizontal augles .. _....... _........ _.... __ ... __ ..... 1, 778 Ocular microscope pointings .... _.......... _................ _. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7, 6\13 Observations for vertical angles _. _.... _..... _. __ .... _. _...... _.. ___ .. __ .. _ 1, i70 Azimuth obseryations ....... _........ - ......... _.... _.............. _..... 1, ll!J Including the stations of the scheme of triangulation, the direction and height, by Yertical angles, of twenty-two objects were recorded at Mount Helena. Before leaving the station a topographical sketch was made of the summit. Assistant Davidson, exclusive of the records of regular processes in the geodetic work, made numerous observations for testing the various parts of the instruments which he ltad in use. llis journals contain an aggregate of thirty-seven thousand observations in thirty-five nilurnes. All the field-notes have been duplicated as usual. An important result of observations made by Assistant Davidson in the course of the season was the connection of Snow l\fonntain with the scheme of geodetic operations, the iutervisibility between that station and Hound Top :Mountain not hM-· ing been previously ascertained. That determination insmes both diagonals, one of which is one hundred and sixty miles long, in the great western geodetic link, which will he designated the "Davidson Quadrilateral." At the beginning of the iiresent ~-ear 1\Ir. Davidson accepted the charge of the tidal stations on the l'acific coast, a service for which the survey had bceu preyiously indebted to the care and attention of Col. G. H. l\lendcll, United States Engineers. Assistant Daviclson's proposed transfer of the tidal station from :Fort roiut to Sancclito was ett"ected by keeping a self-registering gauge in operation during three months at each of the two positions. Th~datum-plane was transferred across the Golden Gate instrumentally. At the 1''ort Point side the three bench-marks were connected by levellings with each other and with the tidestaff, and then a mark was set up near the fort for transferring to a mark at Lime Point the two marks, as referred to the surface of the Golden Gate, being on the same level. From Lime Point levellings were carried to the Saucelito tide-gauge, where bench-marks were made and proper].)· secured. .A.s an additional precaution in the transfer, simultaneous and reciprocal vertical angles were measured between the marks on opposite sides of the Golden Gate, accompanied by readings of the barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer.

HEPORT OF TIIE SUPERIXTESDEST OF l!nder the direction of Assistant Davidson the observations needful in the transfer of tl.e tidal station were made by Snbassistaut B. A. Colonna and 1\:Ir. J. I<'. l'ratt. Upwards of a thousand obser>ations were recorded while this work was in hand. ln order to connect the new Boneta light-house with the coast triangulation, an<l to locate t1ie new buoys on thfl har, the same ohsen·ers were directed to reeoYer tlw marks for identif,ri11g the a11j:went stations, to establish an additional station on tlrn summit of Point Lobos, and also to determine the position of the flag-staff of the Ocean Beach Hom;e. From these it will be easy at any time to locate any ohject off or in the Golden Gate. l:"or this work 1\Iessrs.

From a positiou upwards of eight thousand ii.~et high on the flank of l\Ionnt Nebo, snow and ice fields not permit~ ting- a higher ascent, pointings were made with a theodolite in all directions. Sa,lt Lake, eighty miles distant, was seen in tl1e uorthwe!'lt, antl in the northeast the eathcdral-like domes of the Uintah Mountains were Yisihle. 'Vestwardly, ornr numberless inferior ranges, the Snake Range Mountain;; and others were in view, one hundrrnl and t\nmty miles dh;;tant, in Nevada. North of Beaver City summits could be readily seen; and, after careful examination, no doubt remained in regard to the practicability of crossing the Wasatch Mountains with triangulation.

On bis return westward, ::\Ir. Rodg·ers crossed the Tusliar J\Iountains below Rid1fiel1t and made a detour to northward as far as Fillmore. The country in that region was carefully examined, and observations were noted as at other localities. The field-report states that in the valky W{'St of tlie village a site for a base-line of inde1i11ite length could be readily had. This is important, the station being interme<liate, in a chain of quadrilateralR proposed for tl1e geodetic eonuecUon between the Atlantic and Padfic. AS8i:;;tant Hodgers states that da.il,r, aftt·r leaYing Salt J,ake City, ai1d nntil the !Ith of .Jn11e, l'quall;; of snow were noticed on tlie molmtains borderiug his line of trayel. After leaving :Fillmore, the party went southward and westward, by UoYe Creek J.'ort and Heaver City, to :'.\Unersville, and from thence west1Yardly to Hot Springs, in the E;;calante Desert. Of tlte spriugs, the followiug remark i;; made il1 the rnport: "They hoil out of a mound ten feet high and a quarter of a mile long, in the midst of a va8t plai11 of alkali and sage-brush.

'l'opograpliy from Timber Gulch to Stcicart's Point, Cua st of California.-A. t the close of the fowa I year 1875-'7fi, .Assistant L.A. Scngteller was engaged iu the vicinity of ]<'ort Hoss in reconnaissmwe for triangulation to the northward along the coast, :t.'-' a b:u;;is for extending the topographieal sm'vey iu the same direction. The dense forest that :;;kirts the coast of Sonoma County made th1· 1letermiuation of points extreme}~- difficult, as lines of sight could be bad only by cutting awa~· tlw iuterYeniug timuer. One of the stations adopted as the mo;;t available, on account of mauy local impediments, was the top of the trunk of a tree, cut oft' eiglity-two feet abln'e the ground. This was occupied with the theodolite) and the expedient proved, as in otl1er likf'. cases in the experienee of Assistant Sengteller, a matter of great iHlYautage in a r1·gion that otherwise could not have beeu mapped with eYen ordinary accuracy. In a previon;; instance his theodolite was used on a tree after it had been cut off one hundred aud thirty-three feet aboYe the ground. In regard to tile region he remarks: "From Russian River to Point ..Arena, aml commencing again about four miles north of l'oiut Arena and running to Noya RiYer, there is no mountain visible from the coai;t. 'l'he want of eleTations ha;; been much felt in developing the tertiary triangulation, and in its junction with the larger triangulation even more difficulty may be found." The plane-table survey wiis re;;umed 011 the 21st of ,July, 1876, near Timber Gulch, where the topographical work had closed in tlle preceding seasou. :From thence, northward and westward, the coast details were mapped to Stewart's l'oint Landing, or .fifteen miles from the point at whieh the plane-table work was resumed. A moug the features shown on the two sheets resnltim~ from the field-work ar;e all roads within a mile of the coast, all rocks in view at low water, and co1111eete<l with tl1e rocky shore-line all the Ian.dings hetween Port Ross and Stewart's Point. " The character of the topography prosecuted duxiug the season presents a continuous broken shore-line with precipitous and rngged bluffs, and numerous outlying rocks, all backed hy country that rises rapidly from the water-line to heights of fourteen hundred to sixtee11 lnnulred fret in the distance of one or two miles." )Ir.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Having closed in accordance with directions, Assistant Sengteller reported in person at the office, and o the 1st of April of the present year was vlaced in charge of the Engraving Didsion. Reconnais.~ance for primary triangulMion north of San Fmncisco.-The primary triangulation of the coast aboYC San Francisco Bay rests for the present at the line joining Ross Mountain and Sulplmr Peak. Thes(i stations were selected and occupied by Assistant Davidson some years ago, arnl were supposed to be favorably situated for extending a chain of quadrilaterals further to the northward and westwanl along the coast of California. In order to decide upon the most etlectiYe scheme with the least number of points, Assistant Cleveland Rockwell was detailed in August, 1876, to make the reconnah;sance abff\e Russian River, and with a small camp outfit, carried on pack-saddles, his party had traversed part of the region before the close of the following month. l\Ir. Rockwell was taken ill at Cloverdale, but in the middle of November rejoined the party, whicl1, under his direction, had p:tssed on in charge of the aid, l\Ir. E. F. Dickins, and visited in succession six stations to the northward of the line of completetl work. Mr. Rockwell left J{ound Valley on the 17th of November, aml a few days after visited the snmmit of a mountain near Spruce Grove. Subsequently he occupied Mount Pierce, which lies about teu miles to the eastwar1l of Cape Mendocino. A station was >isited nea:c Shelter Cove, and partial observations were made at subsidiary points as data for the adjustment of the most desimhle scheme for the triangulation. \,Vi th reference to prospective wants, this reconnaissance will he made to include points for connecting the coast series of primary triangles with the stations of an~· main triangulation that may be prosecuted hereafter in the mountain region of Northern California:. Field-operations were closed by Assistant Uockwell on the 7th of December. He then engaged in the work of J>lotting the observations and embodying notes and Rketches to perfect the results of the reconnaissance, so that the stations ultimately selected may be identified hereafter. The summits visited range iu height from three thousand feet to six thousand feet. All are carefully described in the fieltl-uotes, and four of the principal points were mapped topographically to represent the cont-Our of the summits a<ljacent to the proposed points of triangulation. Early in April of the present year Assistant Uockwell again took thll fielcl for the purpose of Relecting points to meet the comlitiom1 of being intervisible, and to be ;;o related as to form desirable quadrilaterals. These couditiorns do not readily conjoin in a region which is covered even to the mountain summits by a dense growth of redwood. As reported, the timber growth presents the main obstacle. Lines of sight coultl not be opened without unusual labor in cutting. Other poiut:s were visited in succession in going northward towards Klamath J{iver, and at the end of the fiscal year J\lr. Hockwell had adjusted a series of quadrilaterals as far as Bel Uiver, an<l expected little difiieulty iu extending the scheme as far north as the Klamath. SECTION XI.

Oonst hydrography of Uregon.-Lieut. Commander George ·w. Coffin, CT. S. N., Assistant in tLe ·Coast Survey, with bis 1111rty in the steamer Hassler, left San Francisco on the 17th of June last, and reached Astoria after a b-Oisterous passage of four days. Stress of weather made it expedient to put into Drake's Bay, and afterwards to seek shelter at Crescent City, Ohetko, and Port Orford. After the anival at Astoria a party was dispatched without delay to set up signals along the Clatsop beach. As soon as practicable soundings were commenced by running lines normal to the coast off the Columbia River entrance, and to the southward as low down as Tillamook Head. The lines extencl to an average of fifteen miles from the shore-line. For the adjustment of soundings on his chart, Lieutenaut-Commamler Coffin from the outset had tidal observations recorded at .Astoria and also at a station in Baker's Bay. Hy erecting signals forty feet high it was found practicable to keep them in view as far out to seaward as the sounding-lines were carried. This advantage for accuracy in the hydrograpbic work is, however, offset in part by the strong current and tide iips which make it a matter of difficulty to hold the vessel on any course normal to this part of the Pacific coast.

OF

· Bs an international commission, of which }fr. Hilgard was a member on the part of the United States, arrangements were concertecl for securiug exactness and uniformity in comparisons of Yarions national standard;.; of length and weight. The dt>liherations of this commission, at me,etings held in 187:! and 1874, re;.;ulted in the establishment of au International Bmean of \Veights aml l\leasures, at Paris. The itffitation tendered to Assistant Hilgarcl to accept the directort>hij) of the bureau marks the sense held in that emiiwntly scientific hody of bis special Jitnes."l for organiziug antl eomluctin)! au institution so exacting in its scientific demands, and so noYel in political inception. \\rhile declining the proftered honor, lie will none the less continue his c-0-operatioa as a nwmbcr of the International Committee of 'Veights arnl Measures. In the summer of 1871i, bnt without r!'mitt.ing in execntiw· duties pertaining to the Coast Sun-!'y Office, Mr. Hilg:ml acted a" oue of the jndge1:1 011 scientific aml mecllauical apparatus at tile Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. His intimate knowledge ·respecting instrnmeuts of precision associated him ll8 a leading member of the board of judges, which included somfl of the ahlest. scientist,; of Amnica aiul Emope. Subseque11tly, on invitatio11, lie deliYered a course vf twenty lectures for the .Johns Hopkins l.'.uh·ersity, in Baltimore, on the sul~ject of extended territorial surveying, tlms contributing- the benefit of his long experience to the training of .rnnng men for a work which is one of the great 11t>edi; of our country-the accurate mapping of its entire surface. Hy all other cidlized ;;;tates in which snch work has not hef'n accom}llii;he(l it i1' actively prosecuted. Before recitiug ill some (ldail thtci operations of the seYeral divisions of the oftke, I will call attention to some special result;.; that have :u:cn1ecl during the year, a part of which form the sub· jects of papers appendecl to tllis report. In Appendix No. G will be found a cliseussion of the results of two meridional arcs, aggregating eight degrees of latitmle, that haYe been measured incidental'.y during the progress of the coast sur\·ey. Their bearing upon the general figure of the earth is considered, but the conclusions reached must nece1>sarily be modified by the introduction of the great ohliqne arc from the Saint Croix River to Central Georgia, which ha.'! been completed since the date of this report. .Attention is callecl to tile great number of maps and charts publishecl during the year by the method of plwtolithog;raplly. Their titles will be found in .Appendix No. 4, and the perfection that haR been reached iu tlw proceHH may be judged from tbe cb:irt of Han LuiR OhiHpo Ba.y an<l approiwhes, No. 21, of this volume. Tlte new engraved chart of the .Atlantic c-0ast ·from Cape Hable (!lailing-cllart A) also deserves special notice. It comprises charts of the principal harbors upon the same sheet with the general chart, tile former being copies of tile separate charts t.ranRfened upon the 11Iat<:i by the electrotype procesl'l. The list of latitmle-stars, printed iu a former report. with approximate places only, for purposes of Releetion~ was reprinted with as e.s:act places as could be rcadils obtained without reobserrntion, as Appt1ndix No. 7, lteport of 1876. In the matter of instrnmeuts, important progress has been made. Three 20-inch theodolites, constnwted h,Y l\lr. 'Yilliam "'urdemauu for the Coast Survey, were carefully tested as to graduation at the office, and subsequently by aC'tual use in the field, and have been found to gh·e results of RH}Wrior acconlauc:e than heretofore ohtaincd with instruments of a similar clasR. 1\.ppendix .No. 11 gh'rs the detail:-; cstahlisbing these facts. A leveling instrnm('llt of j..,'"l'cat precision, for ll!le in geodesic leveling, has been designed and construeh·ll at tile otiicP. .A fnll account. of it will he gh-m1 after thorough trial in the field. In Appendix No. rn will he found a description and illustmtion of au "optical densimeter," intendCll to determine the density of' sea-water by its refractive power, offering the advantage over a h;ydronwter or "stemtloat" that its imlications are not affected by the motion of the ship. In this connection the water Hpecimen-cup, of the "drop-cylinder" pattern, described in the report of JJieutenant Collins on his examination of the salinit.y of the waters of Chesapeake Bay (.Appendix No. 14), should also be mentioned. The compensating apparatus for measuring primary base-lines haYing previously received the ad1lition of a difterential or "Rorda" temperature-scale, was compared with the standard bar at the lowest temperatures during the winter, and subsequently in summer at the highest temperatures which the comparing-rnult attained, in onler to obtain the relation between the temperatnrescales and the compensation.

Mr. J. Main, another experiencml computer, has been compelled to retire from illhealth. The force in the diviRion heing th11:,; weakP.ned, and still further reduced m consequence of diminishe(l appropriations, it has demanded the moRt unremitting effort on the Jlart of the remaining computers, aided by the occaRional services of field-officers assigue(l to office duty, to make tlic progress of the work commensurate with that of the ol>servatious made in the field. In addition to the direction aud supervision of the computations, Assistant Schott has made a number of special investigations during the year, among which may be mentioned the following: lreport on the telegraphic longitude of Key 'Vest, I<'la., determined in 1873-'74, including computation of transits observecl at the United States Naval Obsenator;r; establishment of twcntyseven conditional equations fiw the adjustment of heights of stationR between Kent l:slaud, l\ld., and Har1)er's Ferry, Va.; comput3tion, combination, and discussion of three American arcs of the meridian, the Nantucket arc (Massachusetts, New Hampshire, aml 1\laine); the I'amplico-Chl'sapeake arc (North Carolina, Virginia, a11d 1\farylaud), and the l'erudau arc in South America; pre. paration of a new edit.ion of the paper oil obser,·ations of tenestrial magnetism; notes on the method of observing horizontal angles and directions in geodt1tic surveys; collection of data, extension and additions to discussion of secular change of magnetic declination.

Hoover, in charge, distribution is made of the charts to sale agents in the principal sea-ports of the l'uited States, aml of the annual reports of the Superintendent to librari<'s and public institutions both at home and abroad; the papers embml.ving the methods aml results of the survey are kept on hand to supply constant demands from colleges, scientific associations, and persons interested in State and otbcr smT(·ys; records are kept of all instruments sent to or from the field; supplies of sfattionery are furnished UilOD requisitions from the <livisions of tbe oftice, or from field-parties, and the accounts of office expenditures and dislmrsernents are kept. · In the archives :Mr. G. ~.\. Stewart bas continued to })erform the duty of receiYing and registering the original and duplicate field-records, and of filiug for reference the original t{Jpographic and 11:nhographic maps and charts. 'fhe lists of these original sheets l1a\'e Jwpn hronght up to date aml publishe<l as appemlices to the report of the Superintendent foT 1845. During the year, nineteen thonsaml four lnrndretl and seYenty copies of cl1ai·ts aiid skt·tches !Jase been printed. The 1uesses have been worked by Mr. Frauk l\Ioore, aided hy Mr. D. N. Hoover. Hixteen thousand seven hundred and se\·enty-fi rn copies of maps and charts have been issued from the chart-room, nuder the immediate charge of Mr. Thomas l\IcDonnell. This aggregate nnmhPr is an i11crea8e oyer that of last. ;year h,y upwards of four thousand copieR, and indicates the growing demand for maps and charts based upon aceurate surveys. Of the annual reports of the Superintendent, two thousand eigl1t hundred and thirty copies of Yarious years ha,-e been issue1l, an increase o\·er the distribntion last year of se\·enteen hundred antl ninety copies.

Saegwuller has had the supervision of work in the instrurncnt-sl1op, including the com;trnction arnl repair of instrnmentR, and the teRting of their adjustments for fiel1l-parties. Among the improvements iutroduc~ed by JI.Ir. Saegmuller may be mentioned the process of clotl1-11ustil1g, hy means of which tlie surfaces of brass, which would otJ1erwise reflect light in a way trying to the eyes of an obRrrver, are covered with a fine coating of green cloth. 1\f r .·Tohn Clark, since his return from dnt,y connected with the care of the Coast Survey exhibit at t11e Ceutennial Exposition, has been engaged mostly npon the preparation 0f tbe primary-base apparnt11;; for Jiel<l-senict' on the Pacific coast; these preparations involving improvements in its com;truction, whidt have been cxecut.ed hy J\Ir.

On a.ccount of failing health, Mr. Samuel llein, at the age of sixty-eight, after having Jlerformed the duties of disbursing agent of the Coast Suryey for many years, tendered his resignation. This was reluctantly accepted, to fake effect on the 1st of March, when, at greatly reduced compensation, he entered UJlOU duties more suited to his age and physical strength, but effective b,r reason of bis experience and knowledge of 4letails in the service.

THE l'A:MPLICO~CIIESAPEAKE ARC OF THE MERIDIAN AND ITS COMBINATION WITH THE NAN'JTCKET AND THE l'ElffYIAN ARCS, J'OR A DETERMINATION OF THE FIGURE OF THE EARTH FJW)I AMERICAN ~IEA~l;RE8. REPORT BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, A8SISTANT.

CO"l'YIPUTING DIVISION, February 17, 1877. The Pamplico-Chesapeake arc of the meridian is the second arc measured by, and incidental to tllc ordinary geodetic work of the Coast Survey. Its southern extremicy is at Ocracuke Inlet, NortL Caroliua, iu latitude 330 041 .0; its nortllern extremity is at present at the heacl of Chesapeake Ha~-, in Maryland, in latitude 390 35'.5 It is :situated nearly in longitude 760 08 1 or 5h 04m.5 west of GreenwieL. The primary triangulation of the arc is shown on plates 6 and 7 accompanying this report. Leaving the Atlantic coast just south of Ocracoke Inlet the arc crosses Pamplico Sound :mu Albemarle Sound, passing oYer the marshes and low lands of North Carolina and Virginia; it then enters CLer;apeake Bay and extends near and over jts eastern shore, which is low and almost lc>el ground. The total development of the arc is nearly 4° 31'.5, about equal to 502 kilometres or ~n'.! Rtatute miles. Compared with our first arc, for which see Coaoit Survey Heport of 1868, App<'rnlix No. !l, p. 147 and following, it exceeds the length of the Nantucket arc by very nearly mw-third. The geodetic and astronomical work was executed between the years 1844 and 187G, under Superintendents A. D. Bache, B. Peirce, and the present head of the survey, and 1>rincipall;.- h~- tlw following Assistants: ,J. Ferguson in upper Chesapeake Bay, 1844-'45; E. Blunt, in 111hh1le an<l lower Chesapeake Ba~-, 1846-'53; R. D. Cutt;;, vicinity of entrance of bay, 1867-'69; R E. Halter, in Currituck Sound, 1873; \V. M. Boyce, in Alb~niarle Sound, 1847-'49; A. A. Humphn·yis, U. S. E., vicinity of Ifoanoke and Croatau Sounds, 1850; and G. A. Fairfield, in Pamplico Sound, 1870-'75. The aboye statements refer to the principal triangulation which is supported b;.- scYeral base-lines, the statistics of' which may be given as follows :

The middle of the arc is in latitude 3iO ~0' nearly, and the meau of the 14 astronomical latitudes is 370 Hi' nearly, the station Wolf 'l'rap being nearest to this latitude it hai:; been used for the determination of the geodetic latitude of the arc. There are two other stations withi11 tl1e limits of the arc, yiz: Taylor, determined in May, 184i, by T .·J. J,ee, arnl Shellbank, determined in l\larclt and April, 1847, by 0. 0. Boutelle. They are omitted to aYoid unequal subdiYisions of the arc, '.l'aylor falling between Webb and Marriott, and Shellban1: between SteYenson's Point and Sand Island.

Owing to the apparently systematic elmracter of the local deflections, the first mean yalue is preferable to the seco11d. It may also be noted here that the geodetic latitude of \Yolf Trap, based upou a large 11muber of astronomical obsmTations of the primary triangulation between Maine and Virginia, is :ri 0 24' 01".40, ~howing that our are may possess, as a whole, an appa.rent local deflection (common to all points) of +2 11 .:1; but more likely the difference is due to a defective spheroid of developmeut; in fact, this is almost certain. A + sign of the apparent station-error indicat<:s a deflection of the plumb-line towards the sea or the disturbed zenith lies north of the geodetic zenith.
RESlTLTING AZDffiTHS DETERMINED ASTRONOMICALLY.

The theodolites employed were a three-decimetre Gambey at stations Nos. 4, 5, G, 7, 8, 10, and 13 i a three-decimetre Brunner at stations Nos. 11and12 i a two-foot Trougbton at Rtations NoR.1, :~, 9, and 10~; and a thirty-inch Troughton and Simms at station No. 2. Polaris was observed at all stations except No. 7, when ·11 Cephei and J. Ursa> :Ylinoris were used. At No. 3 some other stars besides l'olaris were obsen-ed. The probable errors given are those arising from the errors of obscrYat.ion combined witl1 thoRe in the measure of the ai1gle between the azimuth-mark and a direction in the triangulation.

The systematic character of the apparent deflection in azimuth is more pronounced than in the case of the latitudes; a + sign of the apparent station-errors iudicates a deflection of the plumbline tmrnrds the land or the disturbed zenith east of t11e grotlctic zenith. The geodetic azimuth derived from many stations in the principal .Atlantic coast triangulation is 140 28' 27".25, indicating an apparent deflection of the whole arc of about +3".i. Respecting the larger wave of disturhm1ee in the resultant dil'ection of grirrity, we t.lms see that along the arc the plumb-line appears relatively attractt'd north1card in localities between the head of Chesapeake Bay and Bodies faland, and soutltwan1 (or seaward) lietween Bot.lies Island and the southern terminus, near Ocracokc Inlet; also the 11lumllline appears attracted 11,estu:ard between the head of Chesapeake Bay and Tangier Island, and eastward (or seaward) between Bodies Island and Oeraeoke Inlet. Superposed on this more general wave of deflection there are other local ones of small extent, though comparable in magnitude with the larger one. In general, for all that part of the arc traversing l\Iaryland, the plnmb-line appears deflected northwesterly toward the .Blue Ridge; whereas for the opposite end of the arc, traversing North Carolina, the plumb-line appears deflected southca.~terly, or toward the sea. These two OJlposed directions appear more or less neutralized over that part of the arc which is situated in Virginia. This points to the further conclusion that the crust of the earth forming the adjacent sea-lwtt-0m is comparatively dense. The apparent station-errors as given partake more of the character of rclatfre deflection;; than absolute ones; yet, after deducting the supposed part of the deflection to which the arc, as a whole, may be subject, probably enough remains to bear out the above general statement. At present we have no means of knowing the absolute deflections . .According to Hitchcock and Blake's geological map accompanying the third volume of the Statistics of the Ninth Census of the United States, 1870,· the arc traverses, in the south, fur threefourths of its course, a formation of alluvium. In the northern quarter it reaches tertiar_y and cretaceous formations, and it nearly extends, at the head of the hay, to the eozoic rocks. In order to find the linear distances between the parallels of the astronomical stations, the same process as used in the Nantucket arc has been followed, viz: to redevelop the elliptic arc contained between any two parallels, making use of the geodetic latitudes already existing. Tl.ms the triangulation originally placed on Bessel's spheroid is to be redeveloped from the same surface; but before doing this a correction to the geodetic latitudes is needed to change them into the values

The unit of length in which the linear measures are expressed is the "conunittfle metre," the property of the American Philoso1lhical Society of Philadelphia. It is one of the original metres remitted by the French Committee of the year VII to .Mr. Tralles, who gave it to l\Ir. Hassler, and by whom it was brought to America in 1805 and presented to the Philosophical Society. It was again taken to Paris and compared (August 24, 1867) with the standard platinum metre of the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, and was found, at the temperature of melting ice, =lm.00000336 of the platinum metre of the Archives.· To express, therefore, our linear results in terms of the prototype metre, they require an increase of their 29-{619 part, or their logarithms require an addition of 0.00000146. The distances given in the following table have been increased by this quantity.
· See a.coount of the comparison by F. A. P. Barnartl, (then) Assistant in the Coast Survey, arnl H. Tresca, of tlrn Coneervatoire, in Coast Survey Report of 1867, Appendix No. 7, pp. 134-137.

COMBINATION OF .ARCS OF THE MERIDIAN.

Although two arcs theoretically suffice to deduce a result for the figure of the earth, considered as an ellipsoid of revolution, yet the two arcs measured by th<> Coast Survey have their mean latitudes too close together to he suitable for sul'l1 a purpose; but b;y combining them with the Peruvian arc, measured between 1735 aml 17 44, we may obtain a fair result for the earth's meridional ellipse passing through North America in the average longitude of 75° 09' west of Greenwich. The data of the N autucket arc of the meridian (in longitude 70° 23' west of Greenwich), measured by the Coast Survey bet.wen 1846 and 1867, I take from my report of November 30, 1867, published in Coast SmTey Heport of 1868, Appendix No. 9, pp. 147-153:

Bessel's arcs are sitnated in Europe and Asfa, with one arc in America (the Peruvian). Clarke's arcs arc situated in Enropei Asia, Africa, and America (the Peru>ian). The Coast Survey arcs are in the Western Hemisphere, near to the average longitude 750 09' west of Greenwich. The arcs are all in its northern quadrant excepting a part of the Peruvian arc which lies across the equator. Owing to an absence of measures in a high latitude our special combination must necessarily be weak for the determination of the compression; this is sufficiently shown by the large probable error assigned to the above value. This probable error, however, includes within its range the best >alue for the compression, as far as known. As a special combination of arcs for North America the results indicate that the curvature of the meridians is probably not materially differing in the two hemispheres (the Eastern and Vi'estern), but that our two arcs demand a spheroid of somewhat larger size than that given by Bessel's numters for the earth as a whole. This will appear clearer if we adopt for the compression -,,i "' and determine by means of our equations the corresponding values of the semi-axes; they become a = 6378iG9 and b = 635714G very nearly. The surface of this spheroid lies about563 metres outside Clarke's spheroid and is concentric therewith, wbereas for our firnt spheroid its surface at the equator lies 152 metres inside, and at the }Jole 591 metres outside Clarke's spheroid, wbich latter it therefore intersects. If the form of the meridian was uot restricted to an ellipse it is probable that in our middle latitudes the average surface would pr<iject be;youd the elliptic "surface. The result from the combination of the three American arcs, which is of most interest t-0 us, is the preference it gives to Clarke's spheroid over that of Ilessel't'l; an early abandonment of the latter as the fundamental surface upon which to de'Velop the triangulations of the Coast Survey is thus indicated. Our triangulation thus being supposed developed on too small a surface (Bessel's spheroid), our geodetic latitudes in the north will apparently be too great, and the so-called station-errors, astronomic minus geodetic latitudes, will have a - sign predominating; those in the south will appear too small, and the apparent station-errors will have a + sign predominating.*' If we suppose the geodetic latitude t-0 refer to t11e middle latitulle 400, geodetic results for i10sitions differing from it in latitude 50, north and south of it, would be affected by nearly 2~ seconds (of arc), that is about their mo part; the actual increase needed will probably be less, and may be estimated as one part in 9000, for quantities depending on the dimensions of Bessel's spheroid. No change in our geodetic data is at present contemplated, nor would it be timely to enter into any further discussion of these arcs, since we may confidently expect that both Coast Survey arcs will ere long be extended northward. Besides, we shall have the additional testimony of the nearly completed oblique arc of the primary triangulation, supported uy numerous astronomical stations between Maine and Georgia, which arc has already reached an extent of nearly 17:1°· Under the supposition of an elliptic equator Captain Clarke nnds (Comparisons of standards of length, appendix, p. 285) the minimum quadrant to lie or intersect the equator in longitude 74~0
·In the coast triangulation between Maine and North Carolina appearances support this view; for the southern part of the Blue Ridge primary triangulation the value A-G is about+ 3".5; the work, h<>wever,is as yet incomplete.

west of Greenwich, almost precisely the average longitude of our three arcs. Their resttlt as given above is not particularly favorable to the assumption. I may be permitted to remark that geodesy would deriYe much benefit from a remeasure and extension of the Peruvian arc, which it will now probably he conceded falls short of the precision which its favorable position on the earth's surface demandli; being at the equator, it has great effect in the combination with arcs in high latitudes for the deduction of the earth's :figure; hence its apparent fair accord with other arcs is no sure proof of the accuracy of its determination. Its chief defect lies in the paucity of astronomical latitudes (there lieing but the necessary two), and this in a cmmtry where large local defleetions of the plumb-line must be expected. The arc of nearly one degree and a half, measured in tllc htst century in connection with the establishment of the boundary between the States of Maryland and Delaware, hy ::\Iason arnl Dixon, which lies not far east of the northern part of the Pamplico-Chesapeake arc, ha" uot been taken into account in tlie foregoing discussion. Its accm·acy, although fully equal to the Lest '\ork of its day, falls far short of geodesic measures made within the last fifty years, aml the small am1ilitude of the arc makes its value ineffectiYe in any estimation of the magqitude and figure of the earth from geodesic operations accomplishell up to this time. Au account of the ::\Jason and Dixon arc is given in the Philosophical Transactions of the Ho,\' al Societ.v, 17138, and in reft·rence to it, the the Astronomer l{oyal of Great Britain, Sir George B. Air~-, in his treafa;e ''On the Figure of the Earth" (Encyclopmdia .Metropolitana, 18~0, p. !!09), uses the followiug language: "The results of this measure n;rnst, we think, be received as Rqnal in authority to tho1ie of any othf'r nwa;;;nrc.'' It is, therefore, only owing to the increased perfection of instrumental means aml methods that we now dismiss from further consideration the first measured North American arc, which, moreover, is now superseded by the present measures. An account is given in the Comptes Hendus (Paris) 1867 of a meridional arc of nearly 100 then being measured in Chili by Mr. Pissio. Judging from the statemeut of insirnmental means used, the impression made respectiug its accuracy is rather an n11favorable one. :Xo report of the results having since been published, it has not been introduced into this discussion.

APPENDIX No. 7.
THE 111AG.KETIC OBSERVATORY AT MADISON, WIS.-REPORT HY CHARLES A. SCHOTI', ASSISTANT.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

Washington, D. G., October B, 1877. Sm: In conformity with your instructions of September 3, 1877, charging nie with the duty of examining into and providing for the efficiency of the Magnetic Observatory at Madison, Wis., I applied to the assistant in charge of the office for the photographic traces and records,· and on their recei11t, at once computed the scale-values of the instruments, prepared the necessary reading-scales for the traces, and partly read them off, and scrutinized the results. The tinifilar nwgnetometer appears to be in a satisfactory condition, and six months of traces were available for tabulation on the 1st of September. One division of scale equals 1'.159 (times the torsion factor). The bifilar magnetometer produced traces of almost straight lines, and its failure is due to want of sensitiveness of adjustment. By the method of angles (record recovered by me), one division of scale equals 4 &" ; by the method of weights (the more reliable), 4 i 6 of the horizontal force. For efficiency this amount should haYe been about ten times smaller. Respecting the temperature compeusation, we have uo precise information. 'L'he vertical:force magnetometer appears to have done tolerably well in the first month (March), but soon after lost its stability, its construction not bearing so high a degree of sensitiveness as was given to it. Perhaps a small percentage of the traces may be found useful in the discussion. The scale-value was well determined, and one division I found to equal 7 b 8 part of the vertical force. A few traces have been read off and tabulated. The temperature-compensation appears to have been well made. The purely photographic work is, upon the whole, effective, yet it will bear improvements. September 13 I arrived at Madison, accompanied by Mr. Suess, and, after inspecting the mag· netic observatory, called on Mr. Van Slyke, one of the trustees of the university, to arrange for the proper ventilation of the vault, a point of importance not only for the comfort of the observer, but for the performance and preservation of the instruments and the reliability of the scale-values of tlle force~magnetometerR, they being affected by deposition of moisture. Through the liberality of Mr. Van Slyke, the work for ventilation was immediately attended to; a six-inch earthenware pipe was laid below the level of the floor, with an opening in the center of it, and with a slight inclination southward. The approaches to the observatory, which in wet weather J1ad been almost inaccessible, were graded and the sides sodded. After this the inner -walls of the vault were perfectly dry, and no inconvenience was felt by us for want of fresh airi though engaged for hours in the adjustment· of the instruments. The brick stove, though not in use, and the old vertical air-duct, were left untouched, serving still as ventilators. I have no apprehension whatever of any further trouble on account of moisture or foul air. While the work of digging and relaying of floor went on, Mr. Suess was engaged in cleaning the instruments and in instructing Mr. Mason respecting improvements in the photographic process; also in fastening the wooden isupports ou the top of the piers bearing the scales, telescopes, cylinders, and clock, which had become loose, warping from the effect of moisture. The funnels on the lamps were lowered to give ascending slope to escape-pipes. The lamps were fastened to their stands, and the metallic reading-lamp, which had frequently disturbed the vertical-force magnet, was replaced by a stearine candle, fastened in a block of wood. In the mean time, with the assistance of Mr. Braid, whom I found engaged in making a new determination of the absolute magnetic measures, I made a small local triangulation connecting three magnetic stations with the triangulation of the State, and described. the stations.

'l'hiH was douc with tho aid of the steam lauuch attached to the l?escarch tlti:,; seaso11, and which throughout the season was of great assitlt:mce to the party. \Yhile engaged in sounding this part of the ifrer the days u11faYorable to the prost>cntion of this \rork were employed in running the shore-line of the new lands formed in CulJitt'ti Gap since in; opcuiug. The topogl'aphieal smTey of the Gap, with the necessary tifaugnlatiou, tog·pther with tl1c Rotmdings in the riYer Rpoken of ahove, engaged the party from l\farcl1 3G to .lune 3ii, l 'p to the 31st of l\fay tlle weather ltad be,en very unfavorable for current obserYatious, with the exccptiou of a Yer.r limited 1111mher of days, and none were attempted until the 33d, when the party hegau obserYations ou a section of the main stream aborn Cubitt's Gap. As it hacl heen found necessary to ohtain closer results than h_y the method heretofore usell, viz, that, by ohscrving from a stationary boat with float and liueti, a llc8criptiou of the manner of ohst·rYing aud of the floats uHctl will he gfren below . . \t the dose of the sun-cy of the Gap, which inclmlrd the h;i·drognqih;r of the main pass of thc> Gap from the llOint where last year's suryey left oft' to the outer face of its bar, a distance of a hout fiyc mile8, tho part~- ;;;ailed for Houthwcst rass, where Ute plt;ysical l1;plrngrnpl1y was conti11m·1l, 1·xtern1ing it to a section in rass it l'Outrc.

J\Ir. \Yeir's suggestions in regard to the apparatmi used iu the current-obSCITations have been tried in many instanceR and have proved very satisfactory. H<J.ving received your instructions, the part.v was dissolved on the 20th of August. The schooner Research was laid up at t.he head of South Pass and housed o>er witb lumber ; all the boats, including the steam-cutter, were placed on board-platforms built on shore, and housed over. The whole was Jeft in charge of H. T. Hntchinson, carpenter's mate, assistt>d b;r S. E. 0. 'Wheeler, qnartermaster, as ship-keepers.

Base-liues were ac!'nratel.\· me<Jsm·i·cl at the poi11t;o; s<>lected for cross-sPct.ions; t.hP.'le were laitl out so as to be iiarallel to the axis of the stream. .At the ends of the hase, angles were measured on the passag·e of the floats m·er tl1e ranges, the lower instrument.

They can he loaded easily fro:n any material at. liarnl, sncb as olcl mtilio:, iron filings, c>arth, or Rallll, anti are larg·e enough so that the wincl cnn have little influence on tlicrn. Su/Jeurrentjfoafg and ob.~erration.~.-All the snllcnrrent oh!-lP.r,·atio11s have been of the frpe-tloat kind (with the exception of a fow trials of HeYJ'fl current-meter), arnl ai,; the form of the apparatus used wa:s somewhat change1l from t.iiat ]lrt'.Yionsly in ust', a detailed description i:;; girnu b!llow. It had sl'emetl desirable to do away, if pmisihle, with eorreetious for influence of surface-float, in snhm1rre11t oh>wn-ati011s; or sinee, theoretieally, this cn.irnot he dmw, at least so to reduce it that. it would practieally amount to uothing. 'Yith thiR ('lid in view, Uw :uea of the surface-float a111l tlw size of tlrn connecting-wire WPre 11111cl1 rrclnced aud the area of the subtloat greatly enlarged. ThP form o!' the surface-float was also changt>d so as to give the greatC"st buoyancy with the least resi>it:mc1; to the current. 'l'he connected surface-float is a semi-ellipsoid, the vertieal section being a semi-ellipse, with major axis ::::: 0.5 feet and semi-minor axifl = 0.2 f'Mt, and the horizontal sN·tion a circle. It is m:ule of thin sheet-copper, water-tight, witl1 slightly convex t-Op, so as not to increase its sect,iou materially when it tlip>i below the surfac{"' and at the same time prevent the water from remaiuing on it. The srction oppo,;eu to the currm1t has au area of 0.071'+ square feet or about 11.3 square inches. The connecting-wire is the finest piano-wire, with a diameter of 0.0!!~+ of an inc11. B\-en ti11t\r wire 01an tllis could he used, hut with i11c11~aS<'<l care in manipulating it. The snhfloat is a common wooden barrel, without top or bottom; the sinking-weight is fast1.med at the lower inside edge, so that the barrel sl1all tlrn1t nprigltt if left free; to it is added the weight of buoyancy of UJlper float les" the weight of counecting-wire wileu immersed. The mean diameter of tl1is iloat is 1.4 feet aull its hPight 1.89 feet. The area of section exposed to the current is three hundred and eighty-one square inches, giving a ratio to section of surface-float of 35 to 1, am] to the latter, combin<'d with the st>ction of sixty feet of connecting-wire, of 14 to 1. 1''rom the ahove data we may find to what extent tlie surfa{~e-tloat affects the motion of tl1c snbfloat at ue11ths ·where differences of velocity occur. Taking, for example, an ollservatiou at sixty fret depth, and assuming a difforence of velocity between surface and suhcurrent of 0.5 nan· tical mile 1wr hour, or 0.843H foot per Reconu, and eornp11ti11g the impulse on the surface-float due to this Yelocity b.v \Veishach's formula fo1· the resistance of iloatiug- bodies, we find the theoretical value of an obs('rvation made with these tloats to be as f'ollowfl: The retardation (or acceleration) of lower float = 1.8 feet, or a distance 8Jightly in excess of the diameter of the subJloat; the inclination of the connecting-wire is 1° 42'; aull the lifting of the subtloat = 0.03 foot, i.e., instead of floating at sixty feet 1lepth it moves at a depth of 5!cl.97 feet. This result tends to show that very reliable observations can ue made with this form of floats without having to make any correction for the influence of the connected surface-float.

OPTICAL DENSil\IE'l'ER FOR OCEAN WATER.

'l'he determination of tbe densit.'1- of tl1c ocean in diflereut parts of the world aud at various dt·pths is admitte1l to be au element of the pl1ysical condition of our globe which it. is important to determine \\ith great precision. As the object of this notice is only to describe it new instrument for finding snch densitieR, there i;;; no oocasfon to discns8 the importance of their ascertainment further than to consider the degree of precision requiRite for useful resultR, and which can be reached h;i~ the instrumental me~ms antilablc on ;;;hip-board. Account is taken only of the density of ocean-water uninfltwncoo by the irnmediat._, proximity of fre-sh-water streams. .As the se11sible em'ct of snch is va.riable in different sefl'5ons and at different stages of the tide, no great precision i11 any 1'iugle obserYation of the deusitj· of the water is miefnl, hecanse the densities will differ 8m1i;ibly in adjacent threads of the current, and the \·alue can only be obtained by the average of a great number of observations of approximate accuracy.

These consideratious are equally important with regard to the density of oeeau-water in different Jlarts of the surface and at Yariom; tlt·pths. If tlw spedmem; secured 1\cmld be presern~d without :seusible change tmtil llwy couhl be opportunely submitted to a laborator;y iuYestigation, the task of the nand oJticer would be rnluced to eoll<>etinp; Rpeeimens and hermetically sealing them up, hnt it i8 reasonaLly to he i:;uppoRt·d that lie· would have a llc::;irc to ascertain the results for himself.

The damp act,; upon a collar 11ear 011t· ernl of tlw axis, and the eoulaet-surfaces are so adjn,,;ted as i11 cla1upin~ to exert a ,.light <lowmrnnl 1wessnrt', tl111s in-oiding all rh;k of lifting tlie telescope from the Y is. Second, the use of a shield of ,;beet-brass which coYers the limb, concealing it from Yiew, except for a space of about 10:; at one side "-here an opening in the shieltl au<l a pointer permit the l'iettin~ of any 1h·sirl·tl reading, or the reading of :my 11ointi11g'.

The principal object of the dtiel<I is to proh·ct the limh from the effect of 1111equal temperatures in obseryiug. As, in actmil field-practi<·(1, lhe light and heat always come from one siue, and as the limb remains fixed i11 pmdlio11 througl1 an~- onP '' pm;itiou ''of tilt? instrnnwnt, there is a tendency for one <;ide of the im;trnuwnt tu lw1·on1<· mon· l1Pafrtl than thl' other·, aud dis1~n·pa11t ohse1Tatious um_y result.

This instrument was not recefred at the office until the latter part of .April. The examination wa!' immediately taken up, aud t11e three sets of observarions were made on May 1, 2, and 3. The examination was couducted accor1ling to the method used i11 the preceding cases, but the place and manner of mounting were different. The instrumeut was mounted upon the iron stand belonging to it, and the examination was made in the instrument-room of the fire-proof bnilding adjoining the Coast Snrvey building. The stand rested upon the floor, an<l was consequently su~ject to slight jar as the obsen-e1· moYed around it, but as absolute stabilit,v of the stand is not essential to accnrnc,'1-, no source of error wai; thereby introdnced.

The differP1we of 0<1.24 hetwt>en tlw tinal mt>anfi of the two sets probably fill(l::; its explanation in an altered relation between the mil'roo;cope and limo.

The eighth, ninth, ~··gij~~~~§~~~j~flilEB3-s· and tenth columns giYe the errors of trhsectiou, corrt'ctcd for eccentricity, or the "residual errort:i of graduation and readi11g·." Three sets of obserYatious were made upon each instrument, in order to eliminate, in a great degree, the errors of reading, and thus have the final means represent, as nearly as possible, the reisidual errors of graduation. Following are the reductions:

It is readilv seen that this gins directly the value of e sin (r - p) for eYery even 10° in the value of r. The intnmediate Yalues of rare interpolated. In Table III the second, fourth, and sixth colmnns contain the "mutual errors of trisection," uncorreeted for eccentrieity.

EJ·amination <!/"limbs of '..!O-i111·!t theodolile8 1rith n:fercn<'I' to paiodicity of errors 1ritliin .50.
The oesign of these observations, and their general results, are gi\en befon·-1mg·es 1 li to 119 of this report. The follmYinp: differs from what has already been giYen only i11 hei11g; more full aml giYing the indiYidnal resultr:; for each 5 1 space measured. Tlie design of the ohsen-er iu mca;;ming from 24° to :.!!l0 , instead of from !,!50 to 3<)0, docs not appear. _.\s it is a ·1uestio11 of l'Omparisou of eveu 5° spaces, we must consider the degree between 2.io and '..!.J 0 as corresponding to that between '..!!1° and mJO. It ir:;, therefore, called the 5th degree, and from 25° to 26° is considered the 1st degree. The examination consisted merely in measuring with oue of the micrometers each 51 sp:we for 50 aud comparing the results directl;.-. J<Jach mea~mrement consisted of two pointings upon each end of each 5' space. 1u measuring aBy space, as from 5' to 101, a pointing was made upon the 5' line, then upon the 101, upon the 101 again, and back to the 3'. The range in the readings in several pointings upon the same line Yery rarely exceeded 0.5 division. It will be noticed that the mean value of micrometer is somewhat tliflercnt on the difforent dates of ohservation. Tue presumed explanation of this difference is giver1 on pages 10 and 11. In expressing the values of the 5 1 spaces, the 50 spaces are assumed to be equal to 50, and the value of the ;; 1 spaces are expressed according to their differences from the mean micrometer yalue of the 5' Hpace for that set.

That statement, which was also separately printed and widely distributed, has elicited numerous expressions of satisfaction from Yarious quarters, because it set at rest doubts which had arisen from Yarious causes aR to the identity of the British and American standanls of length. It appearR to he useful to pnblh;h throngll the same channel the detailR of the ohserrntions npon which refit the relations at present mi;;i~ned to different, stamlards of length in order t-0 fully Rnhstautiate the statements of this office, mHl likewise to bring to thr knowledge of thm;e interested in foe mn.iuteuaure of standards the variations which han· taken place in time, influenced probably by chaug't's of temperature, in tlw relative length of bars, not only of different but eYen of the same material, at least when tl.iat material is an alloy of metals of widely different chemical aud mecl1a11ical properties, as i>! the allo_y of the Briti>lh standards. \Yith this Yiew, I smhmit to yon this concb-;e record for pnhlicatiou in the Coast Snrve~- Rt>port for 1877.

MEABFRE OF WEIGHT.

Elaborate comparisons, made at yarious times from the year 11~5:3 np to the present Jate, of this troy pound, containing !"i, 7GO grains, and of the commercial or avoirdupoi.~ pound, contaiuing 7,000 grains, derin1d from the former, with copies of similar Wt'ights de1'iYed from tlJe standard pound of Greiit Britain, have shown that there is not so much a,; one-tlJommndth of <1 grain out· standing hetwt>en tlie money standarcls of thr two couutries.
::lffiASURE OF CAPACITY.

Of the rneasureR of capacity, wlJiclt are not measures of great precision, it is only necessary 1o say that the old British wine-gallon of 231 cubic inches, anJ tLe old vViuchester hnshel, containiug 2 7150.4 cnhic inches, are the recognized standards in the United States, as they were the lawful i;tandards before the separation of the colonies from Great Britain, no subsequent enactment lun-iug· been made.
MEASVRE OF LENGTH.

The measure of length, which is the yard of 36 inches, is legally in the same eomlition a5 tlie measures of capacity. The standard yard of Great Britain was lawful in the colonies before J ilu. By the Constitution of tLe United States the Congress is charged with fixing the standard of weights and measures (Art. I, sec. 8); but no such euactment has ever been made hy Congre:;;s, and therefore that yard which was standard in England previous to 1776 remains the standard yard of the United States to this day; the same being also true of the commercial or avoirdupois pound and of the g·allon and bushel, as above stat~d. It must not be supposed that this is a matter which, iu Yiew of the great questions of public policy engrossing the attention of Congress in early years, had remained without due cousi11eratiou. 'l'be journals of both houses of Congress show that committees were earI.r appointrd for t!Je consideration of the subject. A Senate committee reported on March 1, 17M, that "it wonhl not. be eligible at present to introduce any alteration in the measures aud weights which are 110w used in the United States." Other reports were made from time to time, and in .January, 1820, a committee of the House of Representatives 1n·esented their eouclnsions, which were: "That little should be done; that standards conformed to those in most common use among us should be accu. rately made and carefully preserved at the seat of government; that correct models should be placed in different districts of the country; and that the proportions and relations between these should be ascertained."

HEPOHT OP THE SUI'ERINTENDEXT OF

Agltiu, uu March 11, 18'.:l'.!, a connnittee report was submitted to the same bocly, makiug recomrnemlation,.; for remleri11g "nnifor111 :t111l staole the measure:" amt weights which we at present possess." . Tlrns, aftf'l· f11ll 1:on.~it1Pratiou for thirt,r years, it wa,<; agreed tliat tlte matter wa.s in a Rat.isfa,ctory Rha11e, in Yirtue of our inheritance aud tntditions, arnl that. no legislation was addsahJe_ J.'iually, in 1836: au act was passetl directing the Secretary of the Treasury to cause copies of the weight;.; and mea:;ures atlopted hy the department as standards, for the use of custom-h<msel'i, to h1· o;npplied to ead1 State, "to the end that a uniform standard of weights and measures may he estahlishe<l tl1nmghont tl1e Uuitet1 8tateR.'' (Annex I.) Tlie standards so "adopte1l" were tlw.~e of Great J{ritai11, as hetin·p rehlteu_ 'l'l1e aPtnal 1-'taml:ml of length nsed was a bronze scale or 82 inches, subcliYidetl on silver to tP11th,.; of inches, which ha<l been prepare·l for the Coast Survey of the Unifocl States hy Troughtou, of Lorn1on. 'l'he :m incl1es comprised bet.ween the 27th and 63d inches, found equal to the aYerage of the wl1ole ,.;cale, were taken as the sbrntla1·d yard, and the temperature at which this was consi<len·11 to 11P a standar11, that is to say, equal to the Uritish Standard Yard, was presumed to he (;:!'.:i F. lt lmd, however, nen·r heen directly compared witll that standard, lmt was simply <'Opiell from Troug-hto11'R own scale without subsequent. yerificatio11. ln l~ng[aJl(l, t.lie old starnlard yard, knowu as Bird's Standard oi' 1760, had in the mean time heen found to he irnulPquate iu definition for the increasing requirements of science, and a new set of starnlards of lt·ngth, wei~01t, and capacity was constructed between 1816 ancl 1836 of stlf'lt finished workrnanship a111I prceif>e definition as was require1l by the science of tl1e time, and eyery effort was madu to reprod1wc, with tlte grealest possible exactness, tlie oltl 1-ltandard pound and yard. Not long after this important work had J.)(~en accomplished, the standards so constrnctecl were dPstroyetl hy tlw lmmiug of the Parliament builclings in 1834. 'l'lley have since been reproduced hy reference to all of the former accredited standards with which they had heeu originally compai·ed, and are now known as tlie ''Imperial Rtandards." Some fifty copies of these standards were c011strncterl and iutercompared, and certain of these have heen sent to the United States. The a\·oirdupois pound of 7,0-00 grains is found to agree within one-thousandth of a grain with the aYoirdnpois iion1Hl of the United States, derived from the )fiut-pound heretofore mentioned-an agreeme11t which leaYes no question ontstaruling as to tl1e itlentity of the units of weight of Great Britain arnl the Unitr~1l RtatesThe comparison of the Troughton scale heretofore mentioned with the Bronze Stamlanl Yard ~o. 11, receiYe<l from Great Britain in 1856, shows the former to be longer by nearly one-thousandth of an inch in t11e yard, or, more precisely, 0_000!)2 inch. By very recent comparisons, however, made by m,rself at the British Standards Office between the standard Imperial yard and Bronze No. 11, the latter was found to be 0.000088 inch shorter than the former, which may be stated in the form that it is of standard length at a temperature of 63°_25 F. Hence we infer that at 620 the 'rronghton scale is too long by 0.00083 inch, or that it is standard at 59.6 F. instead of 62° as formerly as;mmed; arnl this correcU011 will apply to all measures thnt have been derived from itTliis cliange, althoug·li sensible in operations of extreme scientific precision, is really of no consequence in onlinary practice, as it amounts only to the l :40,flOOt.li part of the whole length-a degree of accuracy which is seldom refJnired. The correction does not exceecl 1he t.bickness of one of the lines that defiue the yards supplied to the States. Extreme aecmaey in this matter is beset with great difficulties, for in addition to that of ascertaining for each particular bar the rate of dilatation by temperature, there is an uncertainty in regard to permanence in. the length of the bars themselves. Of the two standard yards presented to the United St.at{'s. one ill of bronze (No. 11), and the other of Low-.1\loor wrought iron (No. 57). These are found t.o haYe change<l their relafaye length by 0.00025 inch in twenty-five years; the l1ronze har \wing- now relatiwly shorter by t.hat amonut. This su\!je<'t. is undergoing further investi ga.tion_
RELATION OF YARD TO METER.

Statements iu regard to this relation have varied excessively, c-0mparison between the two standards being sn bject to two great difficulties: first, their different nature and definition, and

RE.PORT OF THE SUPERINTE:NDENT OF

It is not practicable to attain greater precision in comparison until after the completion of the new international meters now in course of construction at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. \Vhen the construction of these slrnll have been perfected, and when they shall have been thoroughly intcrcompared, it will be useful onee more to attempt to iuriYe at a closer comparison of the yard aml meter than we now possess. In order to make such a comparison with the least number of sucecssfre operations, I have devised the following scheme: Divide a ;vanl into four parts by successfre bisections; dividing again the sum of three of these partis iuto eiglit equal parts by snccessi\·e IJisections, one of these eighths addetl to the yard will gfre the length of the meter with a degree of precision readily within the rmwh of <tll:Y comp<trntor; tlmt is to sa;.~, the length "·ill be 3!1.375 it1ches. Two bars correspomlingly divided lnwe been prepared for this purpose, aml int<>rcomparison is in progresR.

the accidPntal nature of the difference hetweeu the two ii-; enormous, and, admitting the absence of changt> in the actual "alne of the coefficient, the difference must be due to something special in the condition;; of the two RerieR. ThiR iR probably connected with the fact that only two thermometers wPrP usp,d to indicatp, the mean temperature of the 10-foot bar, and with the changes which Captain Clark!' made after the first o;eries with a Yie'W to n~chwc the larp· residual errors of that rseries.

Early in l\rny, 1877, 1·m111iariso11s were again made l)etween tltN1r· ~·ards hy a different ohsf>n·er, antl with another apparatus, in the basement of the Butler lmil<ling. The arrangement for comparing wafl as follows: Along one shlP of a woodm1 trestle a brass beam-compass extended. To thifl were fastened two microscopel'l, whicl1 could he damped at any required distance apart. 1'he microscopes were held on horizontal anm;, which projected Rutncientl.r to allow the hars to be brought under them. B~· nwa11s of a s<·rew at 011e end of the hcam-compass a lon~itudinal motion could lie given to it. B,v tli is rnea11s the right-haml micrometer was made to reatl, as nearly as possil11P, the same for hoth harR, and nearly all the dilform1ce was measured on thr· lcft,-hand micrometer. 'fhe bars were place<l parallel to each other about !: inch a1mrt, and were supported about 9 inches from the ends on brass rollers ahont -h inch in thickness. These in turn rested on a wooden i,;lide, which could be moYe<l tran8Yersely to the beam hackwarll and forward, stops being so alljusted as to arrest its motion wh(·u one or the other bar was under th11 microscopes. The tt>.mperature at which the comparisons were made was obtained by two thenuometers, oue laid on the surface of each bar. After the comparisons of l\Iay 2 the microscopes were transposed. The bars were shifted three times to bring tliem alternately next to the observer. A box made of thick paper, throng·h which the microscopes projected, scrl'ened the hars and thermometers from the influence of the oh~ervPr'~ person. 'fht> time oce1111iecl in makin~ thre11 1~omparil'lons wa~ ahont ten minut~s Light was ohtained by artifit-ial illumination. 'I'l1c ohserrntiom; were made hy Mr. H. ·w. Blair.

As an atlditional precaution agaim;t the intlueuce of the heat radiated by the obsern~rs' b0tliei:;, the barR and thermometers were covered with cotton. The same thermometers used in the comparisons made in the "strong room" were i1se1l in the "to\rnr," with thP addition of one, Xo. 12765, which, dnriug the previous compariRons, was not aYailable, being at Kew for comparison. They were laid on the surface of the bars. The methotl of eondncting the observations was eutil'ely similar to that pursued in the "stronp; room," and the reductions are made on the same assumptions. In both the "strong room" and in the "tower'' c-0mparisons, the work was done by the aid of artificial illumination.

Although the inferred relation gh·en above between No. 1 and the irou bars caunot be accepted as of final accuracy, it is sufficiently evident that a change has taken place between the lmperia Standard and these bars, aud that this change has been in one direction. 'Ve are, therefore, not justified in accepting the conclusion of the Warden of the StandardH that no change has occurred in the absolute lengths of the Imperial Standard and the three Parliamentary copies. See "An 11ccount of the comparisons of the Parliamentary copies of the Imperial Standard." London, 1877.

On the other hand we find that a wrought-iron bar (No. :J7 Low Moor iron) which bas been Ruhjrcted to tlie Rame vicissitudes as No. 11 bronze has not only maintained its relative Ie11gth to the Imperial Standard, but appears somewhat longer through the comparisons with No. l l by an amount 0.000108 inch, which may possibly be covered by the errors of observation. In order to obtain further evidence on this point, Iron Yard No. 57 has been sent to England for dfrect comparil'lon with the British standards, and particularly with its fellow, Low ~foor Iron No. 58, the onlJ· one of the original J·ar<lR of the same material an<l construction as No. 57. The persistence of the dimensions of material reduced to the plastic condition il'l strongly con· tirnwu hy the comparisons maue in 18G7 between one of the original iron meters long in possession of the United States Coast Survey anu the platinum meter of the Comervatoire des Arts et Metiers, made about 18()(), which exhibited no dift'erPnce of so much as the thousanrlth part of a millimeter after so many years, involving two transportations Mross the ocean and extreme vicissitudes of temperature.

DE$CRIPTION OF INSTIWMENT$ EMPLOYED.

As the proposed plan was to sectll'P water specimens at i11te1Tals of t\YO fathom8, from tlw s1uface to the bottom, it became ne,ce88ary to proYide an instrument by wliiclt tlwy conlll be obtaiue<l with facility, and, above all, with ab11olute eertainf.I/ that each speeimen should be brought from the exaet depth required. The Coast Survey Office wa;; in posi;;ession of no apparatus, nor was any known to it that fulfilled completely these requirements. Cylinders with Yalrns operating by the action of the water in ascending and deseeuding were looked upon with distrust, especially since the experiments of' Lieuteuaut-Comumuder Sigsbee,Assistaut iR the Coa8t Survey, had demonstrated their unreliability; and while the instrument devised by him appeared admirably adapted to ordinary deep-sea work, the fact that it must ascend t.hrongh at least oue fathom of water to close its valves, rendered it entirely useless for serial specimens at such short iuten·als as now proposPd. Fpon consideration two wa_ys of effecting the desired result presented themselves. One was the use of a pump (used with lead pipe, by Prof. H. Mitchell, .Assi!'tant in the Coast Survey), and a suf.SoaZe .- -tficient length of rubber tubing for suction-hose, suggested by Commander Lull, Hydrographic Inspector; the other a new apparatus, a sketch of which accompanies this report. The use of a cylinder closing over two fixed disks was suggested by Professor Hilgard, ASBistant in charge of office. The special form adopted was devised jointly by Mr. Saegmuller, instrument-maker, and myDrop-cylin<ler Water-cup. self, subsequently modified, as practical experience showed to be advisable, to the form exhibited in the drawing.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The apparatus, designed to bring np one pint of water, consists of the following parts: .A. stC'm or spindle 0".u in diameter and ~011 in length, terminates at its lower end in a ring for the attachment of the souutling·-lead, and at its upper end, in a slotted head, in which is pivoted the detaching trigger. This trigger is 3" ..3 in length. It is pivoted at one end in the slotted head, and termiuates at the other in a liook, cur,·ed upward, in which is placed one end of a rubber spring, as showu in the drawing. ~ear its milldle the trig·ger carries a swivel for the attaehment of the !;Onmling-line; two curved lugs 1m~jeet from its lower side, and work, one on either side of the head of the spirnllP, Ho that wlwn rither is closed against it, by raising or depressing the free end of the trigger, the otlier will be open. I·'or convenience of reference, the lug farthest from the free end of the triv;gt>r iH 1lesig11ated t!te rear and the other the.front lug. Below the slottPd head, at a d1,.;tance of 3" from the piYot of the trigger, the spindle carries an arm 3" in length, pr~jecting in the plane of the trigger, arnl on the same side of the spindle with it. This also cuds in a hook cttr\"Cd d0\n1 ward, over which passes the lower end of the rubber Rpring before mentioned. Thi.; arm slides on the spindle and is furnished with a set-screw, so that itH distance from the trigger rna.Y be increased at pleasure. At a distance of 811 .4 below this arm the spindle carries a fixed disk 2".6 in diameter, below thiis at a distance 4".(), avother disk 3" in diameter. Pasising freely over the former, and closing water-tight upon the h1tter, is a sliding· cylinder G".4 in length. This cylinder is open at both ends, the upper end being furnished with a cros;;.bar and collar, working smoothly on the spindle, to guide the cylinder in sliding up and down. Attached to this cross-bar is a wire sling, ending in a loop, and of such a length that when this loop is placctl oYer either of the lugs of the trigger, the lower end of the cylinder will come flush with the lower surface of the upper disk, as shown in the left-hand figure. A spiral spring, coiled around the spindle between the projecting arm and the collar of the cylinder, tends to force the latter firmly down on the lower disk. The method of securing the specimens with this apparatus is as follow;i : A lead of sufficient weight (10 to 50 pounds, depending upon the depth of water and strength of current) is bent on close to the lower ring of the spindle, and a line, marked to fathoms, to the l'Wivel on the trigger. If, now, the bottom-specimen is desired, the in;;trument is prepared by Rliding up the c;yliuder and placing the loop of the sling over the rear lug of the trigger. A. rubber spring is then stretched over the hooks of the trigger aud projecting arm, this spring being of such a strength as to yield to the weight of the lead when the apparatus is suspended by the sounding-line, thus allo!fing the rear lug to close against the head of the spindle, preventing the cylinder from ;;liding down and closing on the lower disk. Tlms prepared, the ::.pparatus is lowered into the water. On reaehing the bottom, the weight of the lead being taken off, the rubber spring draws the hooked end of the trigger downwards, tlmi-1 allowing the wire sling to disengage itself from the rear lug. The cylinder, forced down by the spiral tipriui.;, closes o\'er the disks, and thus the specimen from the stratum in which it rested is secun·d an(l drawn to the surface. For the intermetliate Rpecimens the apparatus is prepared by placing the loop of the sling over the front lug of the trigger, and tiupplyiug a rubber spring of sufficient Rtrength to hold the free end of the trigger down when the instrument is suspended by the sounding-line, thus keeping the lug closed. The line is then made fast t-0 the rail of the boat or vessel, at such a place as will allow the mark indicating the number of fathoms from which the specimen is desired to be at the surface when the line has run out taut. The instrument is then put overboard and allowed to descend freely. .A.sit re,a,ches the desired depth the line is tautened, the rubber spring yields to the shock of the arrested motion, and the cylinder closes ins:tantly, as before. In order to be able always t-0 secure the; proper relation between the strength of the rubber spring and the weight of the lead, a number of the springs of different. strengths should be supplied with each instmment. If a slight increase only in the strength of a spring is desired, it may be giving by sliding the arm down the spindle and confining it at the necessary distance with the set-screw.

A little experience soon enables one to graduate the springs with the greatest ease, so as to secure the best results. The pump used during the first part of the season for obtaining specimens \\"as a small portable hand-pump furnished with twenty.five fathoms of extra four-ply rubber hose of 0".5 interior diameter. The capacity of the pump was so related to that of the hose that a single full stroke was sufficient. to empty approximat.ely a length of one fathom. For conYenience of use the hose was divided into three lengths of eight fathoms each. In practice the lower end was bent on to a sounding-line, marked to fathoms, and at such a distance as to bring its orifice at the required depth when the lead was on the bottom and the line hauled taut. FiYc times the number of strokes of the pump actually necessary to empty the whole length of hose out were then given before taking the specimen. This number, it was thought, was sufficie11t to insure getting the water unmixed from the place where the orifice of the hose rested. To tei:;t this important matter several experiments were made, water from the same spot being taken simultaneously with both hoi:;e and cylinder side by side. 'l'he specimens were then tested with the hydrometer. The results gave conclusive proof of the reliability of the pump and hose thus ui:;ed, as is shown by the following record of one of the tests :

Although thus satisfied of the reliability of the pump and hose, they were so much less convenient of manipulation~specially in a strong tideway when the resistance of the hose caused much troublf'_,-that we soon discarded them entirely °for the c~·liuden;, which appeared to fulfill all the required conditions, for moderate depths, perfectly. The specimens, having been brought to the surface, were usually corked in Congress water bottles, to each of which was attached a tag bearing t.l1e following data necessar.r for its complete identification : · Number of the section. Lett.er of the station. Depth. Stage of the tide, and on the lowest specimens the character of the bottom at the station.

All specimens were then immediately entered in a journal in which were recorded the foregoing data, with the bearings or angles necessary to fix the position of each station. The bottles were then packed away in racks provided for the purpose to await a favorable opportunity for the
DETERMINATION OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY

of their contents. The instruments used for this purpose were the salinometers devised by Prof. J. E. Hilga.rd, Assistant in charge, figured and fully described in Appendix No. 10 to the Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey for the year 1874. The i:;ketch is republished here. They com· ·prised a series of three floats, each about 9" in length. The scale of the first extended from 1.0000 to 1.0110; that of the second from I.OLOO to l.0~10, and that of the third from 1.0200 to 1.0310. Each unit in the third decimal place, or thousandths of the density of fresh water, is represented

The floats were accompanied by a copper can of a capacity of one pint, with a thermometer inserted within the cavity, which i8 glazed in front. The improved form of this can, with which we were furnished, terminateR at the top in a short cylinder of glas;,; which allows the reading of the salinometer-scale either above or below the capillary meniscus. Accompanying the instruments were tables for the reduction of the observed readings to the standard temperature of 600 Fahr. Since with instruments of such delicacy, the motion of the vessel, e''en though slight, would interfere with the accuracy of the observations, the experimt>nts for density were always made when lying at anchor on favorable days, every precaution being taken to secure the utmost attainable accuracy.
~rETHOD

OF CARRYING OX THE WORK.

In making sections of five miles or les8 in leugtl1, the exact location of the section having been determined upon and the stations marked on the chart, our mmal course was to anchor the vessel as nearly as possible 011 the middle 8tation, and then tix her position accurately by the three-point problem when proper o~jects were available for the purpose, otherwise as well as possible by crossbearings. Two boat8 were then sent out to occupy the stations on l'ither side, they fixing their positions by ranges, bearings, and mast-head a,ngles a.s fournl practicable. By these means, and the assistance of the 80llll<lings, it was found possible to occupy the p~ determiued stations very apt1roximately. In sections of' greater length than five miles the Yessel was m<ffe1l aml rc,anchored a sufficient number of times to afford mast-head angles large enough to insure a satisfactory determination of the positions of the boats.

EXPLANATION O.F THE TABLES ACCOMPANYING THE FT'LL RJ:PORT DEPOSITED T~ THE ARCHffEf' OF THE COAST SCRYEY.

The first column contains the letters of the sti1tions occupied; the second shows the depths from which the specimens were taken; the t,hird giYes the obserYed readings of the saliuometer; the fourth, the temperature of the 8peeimeu at thf' time of reading the saliuometer; the fifth, the 8alinometer-rea<lings reduced to the standard temperature of ooo I·'ahr.; the sixth~ the stage of tl1e tide at the time of securing the specimens; the sevent.l1, the ehamcter of the bottom at tlw stations; the eighth, the bearings and distances of prominent o~jccts from each station. The last specimen recorded under each station was im·ariably t:tken from the bottom. The salinometer-readings are given to the fourth place of decimals, as the instruments ust>tl could readily be rea.d to each unit iu that place (see page 1'.!). It does not folio"·, however, that tl.Je <lrmsit.ies are reliable to that degree of precision. An extended series of experiments is about to be undertaken b~· the Assistant in charge, to determine the probable limits of error. Until that is concluded but little can be said on the subject. From my experience in the matter, howeYer, I conclude that the results ginm are not to be tlepcnclcd upon within two units of the fourth-decimal plaC'e on an aYerage: while 01·cm;ional dis· crepancies considerably larger may be expected.
