W. B. Chilton, Clerk. H. M. Fitch, Confidential Clerk. THE WORK OF THE YEAR.

Full details of the work of the year are given in the following pages, and they will show that gratifying progress was made in all directions in work devolved on the Survey. This is true of the work along new lines, as well as of the resurveys which are made necessary by the con!>tant chang-es of the coast line and the depths in rivers, harbors, and ocean bars, the increase in the draft of ships, and by the addition of new features continually added by commercial and other developments. Through the cooperation of the Chief of Engineers, U. S. Army, this Survey is enabled to make fu.l use of the valuable information obtained by the Engineer Corps in their work of river and harbor improvement. It is the policy of this Bureau to utilize to the fullest extent possible all available sources of information, and thus to avoid duplication of work. The regions in which work was done are briefly recapitulated as follows: Astronomic determinations were made in Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, the Philippine Islands, and Tennessee. Base lines were measured in the Philippine Islands. Coast Pilot work was done in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Philippine Islands, and Rhode Island. Gravity was determined in Michigan .. Hydrographic work was done in Alaska, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, New York, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, Virginia, and Washington. Leveling work was done in Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. Magnetic observations were made in Alabama, Alaska, Arizo1~a, ·Arkansas, Atlantic Ocean, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, South Catalina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

Reconnaissance work was done in Alaska, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, and South Dakota. Tide observations were made in California, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, New York, P.ennsylvania, Philippine Islands, and Washington. Topographic work was done in Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Ma:ryland, Massachusetts, New York, Philippine Islands, Virginia, and Washington. Triangulation was done' in Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Philippine Islands, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. The field work necessary for the revision of two volumes of the United States Coast Pilot, covering the coast from St. Croix River, Maine, to Point Judith, Rhode Island, was completed. In Alaska surveys were continued in Icy Straits and Prince William Sound, and the geographic position of points on St. Lawrence and Nunivak islands was determined. In Porto Rico hydrographic work was continued in the harbors and bays and offshore. The director of coast surveys in the Philippine Islands, an officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey (with a detail of assistants), in cooperation with the Insular Government, has continued the important work of charting the imperfectly known waters of the archipelago. The largest vessel belonging to the Survey was also on this duty throughout the year. Detached surveys, based upon astronomic determinations, and including base measure, triangulation, topography, hydrography, and tide observations, were made at various points, and many additional telegraphic longitudes were determined. Magnetic observations were continued. The work of the suboffice of the Survey in Manila was executed with promptness and dispatch. Sixteen new charts were issued during the year, and the following volumes of sailing directions were also issued:
I. II. III. IV. V. North and 'Vest Coasts of Luzon. Southwest and South Coast of Luzon and Adjacent Islands. Coasts of Panay, Negros, Cebu, and Adjacent Islands. Coasts of Samar and Leyte and East Coast of Luzon. Coasts of Mindanao and Adjacent Islands.

Excellent progress was made in the various operations of the magnetic work of the Survey. Magnetic work at sea on board the vessels of the Survey was inaugurated. The determination of the absolute elements of terrestrial magnetism was made in 416 localities, embracing 461 stations, distributed over 31 States and Territories and three foreign countries. Additional details in regard to mag-netic work are given under the Office of Inspector of Magnetic Work and in Appendix I to this Report. Magnetic observatories were maintained at Cheltenham, MarJ1!and; at Baldwin, I<ansas; at Sitka, Alaska, and at Honolulu, Hawaii, and a magnetic observatory was established on Vieques Island, Porto Rico. A continuous record of the changes in the earth's magnetism was obtained at these observatories. Special observations were made at the observatories during the year on the 1st and 15th of each month at the formal request of the German Government, in order to cooperate with foreign observatories in international magnetic work during the time of the antarctic expeditions which were sent out from Germany and Great Britain.

Annual Report for 1902; List and Catalogue of Publications 1816-1902; United States Coast Pilot for Chesapeake Bay and Tributaries (revised edition); Catalogue of Charts (revised edition); Tide Tables for 1903 and 1904; United States Declination Tables for 1902. The usual Monthly Notices to Mariners were prepared, published, and issued each month. In the Office the current work was kept up to date and very satisfactory progress was made in the various branches of its work, including computation, reduction, platting, and discussion of results of field work, and the preparation of results for publication by chart and othenvise. A large amount of special work was also done for other Departments, notably for the State Department for use in the preparation of the United States case for presentation to the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, including special drawings and maps, the photographic reproduction of numerous old maps and their preparation for photolithographing, and the preparation, verification, and general supervision of two atlases. Satisfactory results were obtained during the year at the latitude observatories maintained under the direction of the Survey at the expense of the International Geodetic Association at Gaithersburg, Md., and Ukiah, Cal., for the purpose of measuring the variations of latitude. The Superintendent was appointed a member of the commission created to re-mark the boundary line between the United States and Canada from the Rocky Mountains westward, and two officers were detailed for the field work. Two officers were detailed to assist in the preparation of the United States case for presentation to the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, and the Superintendent also aided in this work personally and by preparing material at the office in Washington. One officer continued on duty as a member of the Mississippi River Commission. The two officers appointed by the United States Supreme Court to retrace and mark the boundary line between the States of Virginia and Tennessee completed that duty and joined in making the final report which settled a controversy a century old. The officer assigned to make a resurvey of Mason and Dixon's Line, at the request ot the commission created by the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, continued the work of reestablishing the old monuments. One officer was detailed to the charge of the triangulation of the city of New York, and another to the charge of the preparation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. One officer took charge of the survey of the Louisiana oyster beds, in cooperation with the State oyster commission. Five speed trial courses were verified at the request of the Navy Department. A portion of the boundary line between Esmeralda and Nye counties, Nev., was established by astronomiC observations at the request of the county authorities, and one officer assisted in laying a cable to the Farallone Islands, off the coast of California. Details in regard to the field work of the year can be found ~n Appendix I to this Report. The appropriations for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey on account of the fiscal year of i903 amounted to $849 460. Of this amount the sum of $210 245 was

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903·

for the pay of officers and men· and to man and equip the vessels of the Survey, and
$29 ooo was for the repairs and m~intenance of the vessels of the Survey. The sum of $40 ooo was for Office expenses. The remainder of the appropriation was about equally

divided between expenses of parties in the field and salaries of the field and office forces.

The Inspector visited the field parties engaged in the hydrographic survey of Chesapeake Bay in the fall of 1902 and made numerous trips to inspect the different vessels and supervise the repairs of the vessels while in progress. He also performed such special duties as were assigned to him from time to time. In his absence Assistant Wainwright took his place as Acting Inspector and performed such duties as required immediate attention. Assistant Wainwright devoted the greater portion of his time to special work which was assigned to him. An account of this work is given under his name in Appendix I.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.

All matters of detail connected with the hydrographic and topographic work in the field and with the vessels of the Survey received attention .and the usual routine duties of correspondence and of keeping the record of the ships, including enlistments, discharges, hospital service, ratings, etc., necessary in revising the pay rolls were kept up to date. Orders and instructions to the hydrographic and topographic parties were prepared for issue by the Superintendent. The work of the Coast Pilot party is under the direction of the Inspector and details are given under the heading, '' B. -Coast Pilot party.'' The Inspector calls attention to the fact that the party while engaged in collecting information in the field for the revision of Coast Pilot volumes, as stated in Appendix I, located 97 rocks and ledges, 50 of which had not been previously reported, and that this information required 29 separate items in the Notices to Mariners to give the necessary information to the public. Assistant Ogden states in his report that the officers and clerks under his direction rendered most efficient and satisfactory service.
THE VESSELS AND THEIR HYDROGRAPHIC WORK.
THE STEAMER BACHE.

Assistant P. A. Welker, Commanding.

On July r, 1902, this vessel was at Baltimore, Md., undergoing repairs. On the 16th she sailed for her working grounds at Hyannisport, Mass., arriving there on the 24th, and during the summer was engaged in hydrographic examinations in Nantucket Sound and a resurvey of Pollock Rip Slue. In October a special examination was made at Rockport, Mass., at the request of the Navy Department, and on October 20 fit>ld work was closed and the vessel returned to Jersey City, N. J., to outfit for the next season's work in Porto Rico. On January 13 she sailed for San Juan; P. R., arriving there on the 20th. She was engaged on the hydrography of the west coast of the island in the vicinity of Mayaguez until March 27, when she sailed for Key \Vest, Fla., to make some special examinations in that vicinity requested by the Navy Department. On June 9 she sailed from Key West to Fort Monroe, Va., arriving there on the 14th, having stopped en route at Charleston, S. C., for magnetic observations. On the 19th she sailed for Baltimore, Md., to complete arrangements for repairs, and at the close of the year was still there.
THE STEAMER BLAKE.

Assistant R. L. Faris, Commanding. Assistant D. B. Wainwright, Commanding.

On July r, 1902_, this vessel was at Baltimore, Md., refitting for work on the New England coast, and on the 20th she sailed for Hyannisport, Mass., arriving there on the 23d. During the summer she wa.s engaged in examinations and resurveys in Nantucket Sound that had been requested by the Navy Department. She continued on this work until September 20, and then proceeded to New Bedford to locate a rock discovered by the CJ. S. S. Brooklyn when leaving that port after the summer maneuvers. She remained at Buzzards Bay making further examinations until October 8, and then

14

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903·

sailed for Baltimore, Md., to undergo extensive repairs before proceeding again to Porto Rico. On January 21 she sailed for San Juan, P. R., arriving there on the 27th. She was engaged during the season in Porto Rico in a survey of Vieques Sound. On May 30 she sailed for Fort Monroe, Va., where she arrived on June 5, and after receiving bids for repairs sailed for Baltimore, Md., on the 9th. She arrived at Baltimore on the 10th, where additional bids for repairs were secured. The repairs having been awarded to a Norfolk firm, she sailed for Norfolk on the 22d, and was placed in the hands of the contractors, where she was at the close of the year. On the arrival of the ship at Baltimore in October she was extensively repaired to strengthen her for the yoyage to Porto Rico. Several of the main-deck beams were renewed and a new main deck was laid. She was also refastened and remetaled. The hydrographic survey of Vieques Sound was executed with great care and more than ordinary detail. The statistics show an average of r5Yz linear miles of sounding lines and over 400 soundings to r square mile of area. As an additional precaution in the execution of this work two leadsmen were employed at all times, but the soundings of only one leadsman was recorded, the second leadsman being used as a check upon the first. The limits of the previous season's \vork seem to have covered the area of the irregular bottom, as Assistant Faris reports that during the last season the average depths were from r 2 to r 5 fathoms, the only shoal spot having been developed near the center of the Sound with about 7 Yz fathoms. On July 15, 1902, Assistant D. B. Wainwright assumed command of the ship during the temporary absence of Assistant Faris. He was relieved on August 13, Assistant Faris having returned to duty.
THI,; SCHOONER EAGRF..

Assistant J. B. Boutelle, Commanding.

At the opening of the year this vessel was employed upon experimental work in connection with the wireless telegraph in the vicinity of New York, and on July 16, 1902, she sailed for Oxford, Md., to resume the hydrographic survey of the Choptank River. Her operations included the hydrography along the shore of the bay from Poplar Island to Jaynes Point. On the 16th of December she sailed for Baltimore, and was put in ordinary for the winter. She was not put in commission again, as her disposal had been decided upon, and she had been offered to the Navy. The negotia:tions were still pending at the close of the year.
THE STEAMER KSDHAVOR.

Assistant F. A. Young, Commanding.

On July r, 1902, this vessel was at work on the Kettle Bottoms, Potomac River, and continued on that survey until December r8, when she sailed for Baltimore, Md., for a general overhauling and repairs. She was laid up at Baltimore during the winter under a reduced crew until May 29, when she sailed for Colonial Beach, Va., to resume work on tJ1e Kettle Bottoms, and at the close of the year she was still engaged upon that survey.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at Eastport, Me., engaged upon a field revision of United States Coast Pilots, Parts I-II and III, extending from the eastern boundary to Narragansett Bay. She completed this work and arrived at New York on October 22, and in Washington on November 1. On November 12 Assistant H. W. Rhodes was assigned to the command, and she proceeded on the same date to Chincoteague Inlet, Virginia, for a resurvey of the shoals off Fishing Point. This work was completed on December 18, when she sailed for Norfolk, Va., on her way to Key West, Fla. The necessary repairs were put on the ship while she was at Norfolk, and she sailed on January 31 for Key West, arriving there on February 4. While at Key West the position of Smith Shoal Bank that had recently been discovered north of Northwest Passage was determined, and the triangulation was extenqed to redetermine positions on the Keys as far as the Marquesas to facilitate the hydrographic surveys to be undertaken later by the steamers Bache and .lf'.ydrographer jointly. On the 31st of March Assistant Rhodes was relieved of the command of the vessel by Assistant W. I. Vinal, and from that date until the close of the season the H_ydrographer' s work was continued in conjunction with the steamer Bache. On June 9 the field work was closed and the vessel sailed for Norfolk, arriving there on the 16th, and proceeded to Baltimore on the 19th, where she was at the end of the year, awaiting the award of proposals that had been invited for repairs.
THE SCHOONER l\IATCHLUSS.

Assistant G. L. Flower, Commanding.

At the beginning of the year this vessel was at work in Tangier Sound, and, completing the surveys in that vicinity, sailed for Baltimore on October 23, for a necessary overhauling. On November 19 she proceeded to Elk River, Maryland, and made a further examination of the hydrography near the mouth of that river. She returned to Baltimore on December 14, where repairs previously arranged for were put upon the vessel, and on February 6 she sailed for West River, Maryland, to take up the hydrographic and topographic surveys of the bay southward, to include Herring Bay. She continued on that work until April 17, when she sailed for Annapolis and began a resurvey of the Severn River, upon which work she was engaged at the close of the year.

On July 1 this vessel was engaged in a survey of San Bernardino Strait and vicinity, Philippine Islands. Subsequently surveys were made of San Pedro Bay and the south coast of Samar to Sungi Point, and before the close of the season on the southwest coast of Leyte, including a search for Carmen Rock, and to define the limits of Danajon Bank. The surveying season closed with March, and the ship proceeded to Hongkong, China, to be overhauled, arriving there April 12, and was still there at the close of the year.
THE STEAMER PATTERSON,

Assistant

J. F. Pratt, Commanding.

This ship was at Seattle, Wash., at the beginning of the year, and sailed from there for Dutch Harbor and Bering Sea on July 19, arriving there on the 30th. She was engaged during the season in transporting chronometers between St. Michaels and St. Lawrence and Nunivak Islands and Dutch Harbor. The field work was closed at the end of September, and on October 7 she sailed for Seattle, Wash., arriving there on the 24th. The crew was immediately reduced to a minimum and the ship put in the hands of the contractor to complete certain repairs that had been deferred until a convenient time. 011 January 24 she was put out of commission, and early in May was again put in commission, and sailed for Sitka on the 17th of June in compliance with instructions to proceed to Controller Bay and Prince William Sound, and incidentally on the outward voyage to run sounding lines Cape Flattery-Sitka and Sitka-Prince William Sound that had been requested by the Chief Signal Officer U. S. Army.
THE STEAMER YUKON,

This vessel was laid up at St. Michael, Alaska, at the dose of the season of 1900, and has not been in service since that date, but in the fall of 1902, when the Patterson had completed her trips with chronometers in Bering Sea, she was brought down to Dutch Harbor by a crew detailed from the Patterson and hauled out at that place and remained there at the dose of the fiscal year.

Special examinations were made in the locally disturbed area~ in the vicinity of Mackinac Straits, Michigan, and Duluth, Minn., and the regions around Phoenix and Flagstaff, Ariz., were examined to ascertain whether it was practicable to establish a magnetic observatory near either place. Magnet£c work at sea.-A series of observations to determine the magnetic declina·tion, dip, and intensity was made on board the steamer Blake in January, during her voyage from Baltimore to Porto Rico, and on her return trip in May and June, and the ship was "swung" three times on the outward and twice on the retun1 voyage. A series of magnetic observations was made on the steamer Baclze, with her standard compass, on a voyage from Key West, Fla., to Norfolk, Va., in June, "swinging" the ship three times. Similar observations were made on the steamer Patterson on her voyage between Seattle, Wash., and Sitka, Alaska, in June, and the ship was "swung" twice. These surveying vessels belong to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and all the vessels of the Survey will hereafter aid in this work at sea to the extent permitted by their instrumental outfit and the exigencies of the service upon which they are engaged.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

Magnetic observatory' work. -Continuous magnetic records were obtained with selfregistering instruments throughout the year at the four observatories maintained, at Cheltenham, Mar_yland, Baldwin, Kansas, Sitka, Alaska, and Honolulu, Hawaii, and after March 1 at Fort Isabel, Vieques Island, Porto Rico. All of the observatories cooperated, in special observations, with the Antarctic expeditions, and with Professor Birkland in connection with his Norwegian polar light work, to the extent permitted by their instrumental outfit. The Ziegler North Polar Expedition and the expedition of the Baltimore Geographic Society to the Bahama Islands were supplied with the necessary instruments, the observers were instructed in their use, and a memorandum was prepared for the Superintendent, suggesting directions in detail for the guidance of these two expeditions in their magnetic work, in response to requests made to him by the officers in charge.

The disbursement of the funds of the Coast and Geodetic Survey is made not only by payments directly from the Disbursing Agent, but also largely through the medium of its Assistants and other officers when acting as chiefs of parties. These officers, on approval of the Superintendent, receive advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent in lump sums, under authority of an Executive order dated March 26, 1886. In conformity to this order there are now 56 officers of this Survey bonded in the sum of $2 ooo or more each. When acting as chiefs of parties these officers receive from time to time such advances of public funds from the Disbursing Agent as are required to meet the necessary current expenses of the work in hand. A ledger account is kept in the office of the Disbursing Agent with each chief of party receiving an advance, each one being charged with all advances made to him, and, on the other hand, receiving credit for all proper expenditures made by him when presented on regularly supported vouchers after such accounts have been audited in the office of the Disbursing Agent and found to be correct. All of these accounts, with their supporting vouchers, are then sent to the First Auditor of the Treasury for examination and audit by him. This system has met the needs of this service, and results, in the main, in economy and good order in its expenditures. The statement of expenditures in detail will be submitted to Congress as usual in a separate report, and will appear in the Annual Report of the Superintendent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904.

The following officers of the Survey died while on active service during the fiscal year: William C. Willenbuchcr, one of the most expert hydrographic draftsmen in this country, died of heart disease at Providence Hospital on the 2d of July. Mr. Willenbucher entered the Coast Survey Office as assistant to his father, the then principal hydrographic draftsman, in 1873, and in 1892 succeeded to his position. His long 1::xperience, both in field and office, together with a peculiar natural aptitude, had developed a power of interpretation of hydrographic work which has rarely been equaled, and his loss to this Survey is one th(ft will long be felt. W. E. Gordon, an Extra Obsenrer, in the Philippine service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, died of cholera at Danao, Island of Negros, Philippine Islands, on November 11, 1902. He was born at Rosedale, Ind., March 9, 1869, and completed his education by a two-years' course at the Missouri State University. After leaving college he entered the service of the United States as a civil engineer on river improvement work under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, in 1893, and remained until 1894, when the work upon which he was engaged was discontinued. He was then employed as a surveyor by the Mendota Coal and Mining Company of Mendota, Mo., and remained in their service until he entered the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Philippine Service, except for a short time during the Spanish war, when he served four months in 1899 as first-class sergeant, Sixth Company, U. S. Volunteer Signal Corps, until mustered out with his company, and received his discharge with indorsement as follows: ''Service honest and faithful. Character excellent. Served in command most satisfactorily." He entered the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Philippine Service, February, 1902, and after reaching the islands received an appointment as Extra Observer, and the Director of Coast Surveys has stated that he rendered "excellent and faithful service.'' Charles Albert Thompson, Watch Officer, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was born at Newport, R. I., on September 30, 1850, and died at Providence Hospital, Washington, D. C., on November 17, 1902. He attended St. Johns College, Fordham, N. Y., and the Military School at Middletown, Conn. He graduated in the public schools in New York and at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1872. After graduating at the Naval Academy, '1e served seven years in the United States Navy, and also served in the Spanish war as ensign, United States Navy, July 2, 1898, to February 8, 1899. He entered the service of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as a Watch Officer on July 1, 1899, and remained in the service until he died. He was buried in the national cemetery at Arlington with the honors of the service accorded him by the officers and sailors of the steamer Endeavor.

While engaged on inspection duty in the Eastern Division Assistant Bauer made magnetic observations at the following stations in .!Jfaryland: Cheltenham, Fort McHenry, Linden, and Upper Marlboro; in .!Jficltigan, at Harbor Point, Houghton, Mackinac Island, Marquette, Round Island, and Saulte Sainte Marie; in Pennsylvania, at Allegheny, Doylestown, and Greensburg; in Hlisconsin, at Milwaukee. Four stations were occupied on Mackinac Island, and one on Round Island, Jlfichigan. He also occupied a station at Fort William, Ontario, Canada. At the stations in Michigan and Wisconsin the regular observations to determine declination, dip, and horizontal intensity were made with a magnetometer, and dip circle obsen·ations were also made with a Lloyd-Creak dip circle, standardized at the Cheltenham Observatory, to determine dip and relative total intensity. Asst. Surgs. G. C. Ballard and J. H. Egbert were instructed in the use of instruments and methods in the field at Upper Marlboro and Linden, JlfarJ1land. After receiving the necessary instructions Doctor Egbert made observations at three stations in llfaryland, Boyds, Dawsonville, and Rockville. S. A. Deel, magnetic observer, was assigned to extend the magnetic survey in Pennsylvania under direction of Assistant Bauer, and made observations at the following stations between July 7 and 25: Bedford, Butler, Kittanning, Somerset, and \Vayneshurg. He closed work on July 26 and returned to \Vashington.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

The Eagre reached Oxford on July 20, and took on board the party (five officers and five seamen) landed there during the previous month in charge of Watch Officer Moser to continue the hydrographic work during the absence of the vessel, and resumed the work in the Choptank River and tributary creeks with the full complement of officers and men. On August 1 r the vessel was moved to Harris Creek at Tilghmans Island, and from this· anchorage the hydrographic work in the creeks named above at the mouth of the Choptank River and on the shoals on the eastern side of Chesapeake Bay between Poplar Island and James Point was completed. A survey was also made of the r 5-foot shoal about 3 miles south and west of James Point. On October 29 the vessel proceeded to Cambridge, Md., and continued the survey of the Choptank River as far as Cabin Creek until December r6, when the work for the season closed and the vessel went to Baltimore. The weather was favorable until November and the work made good progress, but during that month and in December there was much delay on account of bad weather.

The topographic survey of the Potomac River was in progress on July l by a party under the direction of Extra Observer J. W. Donn, and was continued until November 29, when work was suspended for the winter. During this time the survey of the west bank of the river was completed from Accotink Creek to Roslyn, Va., opposite Georgetown, D. C. Advantage was taken of the proximity of this work to Washingfon to assign several Aids, recently appointed, to the party for instruction in the topographic methods used in the Service, and during July and August four aids; Messrs. Loren, King, Carpenter, and Libby, were ordered to report to Mr. Donn. None of these young men had had any experience in togographic work, but they all had a desire to learn, and Mr. Donn gave them earnest attention. Unfortunately for the purpose in view the exigencies of· the Service demanded their assistance elsewhere, and it was necessary to relieve them before any of them had received a month's instruction. It was impracticable to secure suitable quarters in the vicinity of Mount Vernon, and the party was established at Alexandria. In many respects this place proved to

be very convenient and the work was easily reached on both sides of the city. The weather conditions were unusually favorable throughout the season, which made it possible to complete the work, very much in detail, within the limits stated. Topographic work on the Potomac River was resumed by a party under charge of Extra Observer Donn on May I, and continued during the remainder of the fiscal year. The preliminary arrangements were made previous to that date, and the party was fortunate in securing the use of an unoccupied house where a mess was established. The country is sparsely settled, and it was not possible to secure board within a·reasonable distance of the working ground. The party was subsisted with difficulty at this house, but it was conveniently located, and this plan of living was the most feasible that could be adopted under the existing conditions. . The few existing roads \Vere in bad condition and the necessity of using· them delayed the work considerably. It was necessary to traverse a large portion of the area on foot, which also caused delay. The area surveyed extends along the Maryland side of the Potomac River from :eiscataway Creek to Indian Head. This work was completed by the end of the fiscal year and preparations were in progress to continue the topographic work on the Virginia side of the river after June 30.

FAIRFIELD.

Triangulation: 7 stations occupied. 30 geographic positions determined .

On July I the connection of the coast triangulation and the primary triangulation of the Eastern Oblique Arc of the United States along the Blue Ridge Mountains was in progress under the direction of Assistant Fairfield, who was making the necessary observations at the station Dewey Rose. Stations Owens, Beulah, Little Mountain, Mauldin, Six Mile. Mountain, and Currahee were then occupied in the order stated. The unfavorable atmospheric conditions prevailing in the region during the greater portion of the season caused serious delny in the work. Thunder storn1s were of frequent occurrence during the summer, and when there was no rain the haze or smoke was so thick it was impossible to observe on the lights over the longer lines. On these lines two lights were used, one above the other and 15 inches apart, in order to increase the brilliancy, but this plan failed to secure a signal bright enough to be used in observing when the lines were 40 miles long, or longer, except in clear weather. The station at Six Mile Mountain was added to the scheme of triangulation for the purpose of determining the geographic position of Clemson College. It is a sharp peak, heavily wooded and difficult of access, but it is prominent and commands a view in all directions. The observations were finished at Currahee station on September 30, thus completing the connection between the coast triangulation and the primary triangulation along the Blue Ridge Mountains. All the necessary preparations for closing work in this region were completed, and on October 10 the party was disbanded. The stations Mauldin

and Currahee were re-marked in a substantial manner. The geographic positions of all prominent ohjects, such as church spires, court-house domes, tall brick chimneys, etc., were determined when it was practicable to do so. Two acetylene signal lamps, one mounted above the other and 15 inches apart, were used on all lines 40 miles long or longer, and on dear nights they showed as a small bright point, but a very little haze cut them off completely. On lines up to 30 miles in length a single lamp showed very well in fairly dear weather. The vertical angles were generally measured after the observations for horizontal angles were completed, usually from 11 to 12 o'clock at night, and they were measured whenever it was possible to do so. · HVDROGRAPHY.

On July I the Blake was at Baltimore, Md., making preparations to take up hydrographic work in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts. ' These preparations were continued until July 19, when the vessel left Baltimore for Hyannisport, Mass., under the command of Assistant D. B. \Vainwright, who was temporarily in command during the absence of Assistant Faris on leave of absence. The Blake reached Hyannisport on July 23, and the work of building and locating the signals necessary for the season's work began immediately. The hydrographic examination of the channel south of Cross Rip light-vessel was taken up and such progress was made as the weather conditions permitted. The incessant foggy weather caused great delay during the latter part of July and the first part of August, but this work was nearly completed by August 13, on which date Assistant Faris relieved Assistant Wainwright of the command of the ship, and continued the examination of Cross Rip channel for three days, when the work was completed. The channel through the middle of the Horseshoe Shoal was examined between August 19 and 25. An examination of the channel on the north and west side of the Horseshoe Shoal, including the development of Eldridge Shoal and the broken ground to the eastward of the Horseshoe, was begun on August 26, and was nearly complete on September 20, when the ship proceeded to New Bedford, Mass., for the purpose of finding, locating, and developing the rock upon which the U. S. S. Brooklyn had recently struck in the approaches to New Bedford Harbor. The search for this rock afforded au excellent opportunity for testing the efficiency of a new chanuei sweep or drag recently devised and constructed at the Coast and

After the Brooklyn rock was found the region about it was closely develop~d by sounding from a steam launch, and afterwards line_:; were run over it with the drag set at various depths in order to ascertain the minimum depth of water over it. This \vork was completed on September 26, and Assistant Wainwright left the ship on that date.

localities were examii1ed, the drag being used in all cases, set to clear the niinimum depth indicated by the latest chart of the locality under examination. This work served to test the efficiency of the drag, and proved its practicability and m;efulness in close hydrographic development work. When running at the usual speed the drag retards the vessel's speed about r knot per hour. On October 4 the vessel returned to :Nantucket Sound and removed the water signals erected for use during the season; and on October 7 closed work and proceeded

to Baltimore via New Bedford, arriving there on October 11. In all of the hydrographic work with the Blake two leads were used, one on each side of the ship, and the record of the soundings was made in such a way that there is no difficulty in determining on which side of the ship any particular sounding was made. In Nantucket Sound it was necessary to erect hydrographic signals out on the sand bars in from 9 to 14 feet of water, and six such signals were used. They consisted of 3-inch gas pipe put together with the ordinary coupling and pumped into the sand IO or 15 feet, with targets above the top of the pipe. Only one of these signals was carried away by the sea, but all were removed at the close of the season, as they were considered dangerous to sailboat navigation. The work in Buzzards Bay and in the approaches to New Bedford did not require the building or the location of any signals, as the excellent foresight shown in the previous survey by the detem1ination of prominent objects enabled the work to be taken up without the usual delay resulting from building and locating signals. In concluding his report Assistant Faris expresses his appreciation of the work of his officers, and states that what was accomplis.hed during the season was largely due to their zeal and intelligence.

The extension of the magnetic survey in the States of New Jersey and Pennsylvania was assigned to Aid Fleming and the work in the field began on September IO. The work was continued whenever the weather permitted until November 17, when it was suspended on account of the unfavorable weather conditions. Ten days were lost as the result of bad weather during September and November. During October the weather was generally fair and the observer was able to complete the observations at 19 stations, and also verified several county meridian lines. At Scranton a meridian line was established by request of the Engineer's Club of that city, who provided the marks and placed them in position. All, except two, of the stations occupied were marked in a permanent manner. The declination was also determined at eight county meridian lines, and five county meridian lines were verified.

The resurvey of certain portions of Chesapeake Bay was in active progress under the direction of Assistant Flower on July 1, 1902, and the immediate work in hand wa8 a resurvey of Tangier Sound and hs tributary waters. The hydrography of Kedge Straits, Holland Straits, and Tangier Sound, between latitude 38° 02' and 38° 09', of which about one-half was finished during the previous fiscal year, was completed on July 19; the hydrography of Big Annemessex River was completed on August 4, and of Manokin River on August 19. Work on the hydrographic sheet covering Hoopers Straits, a portion of which had been completed during the previous year, Tangier Sound north of latitude 38° 09', and a portion of Fishing and Monie bays east to Great Shoals light-house was then taken up and completed on September 18. From 8.eptember 19 to October 2 the vessel was in Baltimore being repaired. The hydrographic examination of, Elk River began on October 3. Lines of sounding were run at intervals of about 400 meters normal to the shore and as nearly coincident with the old lines as possible, for purposes of comparison, and two transverse lines were run at right angles to these. Additional lines were run across the bar at the mouth of the river. This work was completed on October 23, when the vessel returned to Baltimore for repairs and remained there until November 18.

River on November 19, and additional lines of soundings were run between those already established, and the survey of Elk River was completed on December 12. On December 14 t11e vessel again returned to Baltimore for repairs and remained there until February 6. On that date the Matchless proceeded to West River, and the survey of the unfinished portions of the shore line was completed. The hydrography of Herring Bay and of the shoal waters along the bay shore northward to Franklin Point was completed on April 10. The weather was very unfavorable for field work during February, March, and the first week in April. ·Ice, strong No.6. winds, or thick weather pre!>O' 76 00' vented field work during at 20' least one-half of this time. Signals were blown down and had to be replaced, and several built near the shore line were washed away whh the shore line, and it was. necessary to determine new ones. Work in this vicinity proceeded until April r 7, when the vessel sailed for · Annapolis to take up the 10' resurvey of the Severn River above that place, leaving J.C. Landers, Aid, with a topographic party to complete certain portions of the work in the vicinity of Fairhaven. Two old triangulation stations, Gram 1898 and Greenbury Point light-house, were Nautical Miles recovered, and the lines beI e-"" · l 0 tween them formed the base Kilometers ss·oo· ;;; from which the triangulation was extended up the river. Twenty-six triangulation stations were selected and marked and signal poles Hydrography. Chesapeake !lay. were erected. Having completed the work assigned him, Mr. J. C. Landers returned to the vessel and began topographic work on the south shpre of the river on May 3, and was still engaged on this work at the close of the fiscal year. On May 7 Assistant Flower began topographic work on the north shore and completed it to Arnolds Point. The hydrography was completed to Arnolds Point on June 4. On the 6th the vessel was moved to Round Bay, and J. W. Maupin, Aid, was instructed in the use of the plane table.

FORNEY.

Topography: 62 square miles area covered. 62 miles shore line of rivers surveyed. 55 miles shore line of creeks surveyed. 82 miles of roads surveyed.

A portion of the topographic work in the resurvey of the Potomac River was assigned to Assistant Forney. He transferred his party and outfit from Chesapeake Bay to Chapel Point, Maryland, and began field work Oil the river on July 11. The work continued from this date to the close of the fiscal year, except during the period December 23 to January 21, when it was temporarily suspended. The survey of the shore line was completed from Lower Cedar Point to a point 1 Yz miles below Clifton Beach in Maryland including Port Tobacco River and Nanjemoy Creek, and from Rosier Point to Marlboro triangulation station Oil Marlboro Point in Virginia, including Upper Machodoc, Gambo, Jotank, Potomac, and Accakeek creeks. The interior topography covering the country back from the river to a distance varying from r to 2 miles was completed from Lower Cedar Point to Riverside in Maryland and from Rosier Point to Stiffs Wharf in Virginia. A comparison with the previous survey made forty years ago shows very little change except at prominent projecting points. The work was seriously delayed by unfavorable weather, and on many days no field work could be done. A naptha launch was assigned to the party, but it was out of use, undergoing repairs, a great portion of the time. Assistant Forney makes special mention in his report of the kindness and courtesy extended to the party by Mr. James A. Arnold, light-house keeper at Lower Cedar Point. In addition to boarding the party at considerable inconvenience to his family, he gave the use of his sailboat and his own service, without charge, during a period of ten days on one occasion when the launch was out of order.

4 stations occupied.

Advantage was taken of the fact that in Febmary, 1903, the Straits of Mackinac, :Michigan, were frozen over with ice thick enough for teams to cross, and magnetic observations were secured at four stations over the water at varying distances from the shore for purposes of comparison with similar observations on shore. This work was assigned to Assistant French, who left Washington on February 22 and arrived at :Mackinaw City, Mich., on the 24th. It was desirable to select the positions of the . four stations so as to distribute them in a uniform manner over the area included between McGulpin Point, St. Ignace, Mackinac Island, and Bois Blanc Island. Station A was located about one-third of the way from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace; Station B about 2 miles west of the north end of Bois Blanc Island; Station C at a point about 2 miles east of Mackinaw City, and Station D about 2 miles east 0f Station C, or 4 miles east of Mackinaw City. ' The rough condition of the ice made it necessary to locate the stations at the points indicated as the nearest practicable solution of the question of carrying out the original plan. The large car ferry running between St. Ignace and Mackinaw City prevented the location of any stations between A and B and C. The rough condition of the ice prevented the location of a station farther north toward Mackinac Island by the expense involved in making a road in this direction. The geographic p~sitions of the magnetic stations and the necessary azimuths were determined from the triangulation points established under the direction of the United States Engineers in the sun·ey of the Lakes in this vicinity, through angles measured at the magnetic stations. The instruments were mounted on the usual tripod, the legs being driven into the ice, which was sufficiently stable, as proved by the fact that level did not show any material change while the observations were being made. The tent pins were driven into holes bored in the ice and held very well. The base of the tent was attached to a wooden frame which was fastened to the ice. These precautions were necessary to resist the strong winds which prevailed. A complete set of observations to determine the three magnetic elements was made at each of the ·four stations and work was completed on March 3, after much delay on account of unfavorable weather.

The determination of the position of certain lighthouses on the coasts of Maine and Massachusetts was assigned to Assistant Granger. He began work at Bar Harbor, Me., on July I, and the positions of the following lighthouses in Maine were determined as directed:
Bear Island. Cape Neddick. Cuckolds Fog-Signal Station. Egg Rock. Goat Island. Goose Rocks. Great Duck Island. Indian Island. Nash Island. Portland Breakwater. Prospect Harbor. Ram Island. Rockland Breakwater. Spring Point Ledge. Two Bush Island.

Butler Flats Lighthouse, in New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, was also determined, and the field work for the season closed September 19.

HAYFORD.

The Survey was fortunate in securing an opportunity, through the courtesy of Prof. Fred. W. McNair, of Houghton, Mich., of determining the force of gravity at the North Tamarack copper mine, near Calumet, Mich., at the surface of the earth and at points beneath in the mine itself. It was necessary for the Survey to furnish a skilled observer and the instruments required, and to pay a certain portion of the expense involved. This interesting work was assigned to Assistant Hayford, and he left Washington on September 4, after swinging two sets of pendulums at the base station in Washington and making all other necessary preparations. He reached Calumet on September 6, and between that date and September 20, when the work was completed, the pendulums were swung, with the assistance of Professor McNair, for fifteen periods of approximately seven hours each on the surface of the earth at the entrance of the mine, for nine periods of about the same length at a point in the same vertical line as the surface station and about 4 600 feet below it, and for four seven-hour periods at a point a few hundred feet distant from this vertical line and about I 200 feet below the surface, or at sea level, as the entrance to the mine has an elevation of 1 200 feet above sea level. Whenever a pendulum was swinging beneath the surface in the mine a similar one was swinging at the surface, and the two were being timed by the same chronometer, whose rate was determined by astronomic observations at the surface station. The surface and underground stations were connected by telephone and by complete metallic circuits, so that all observations at the underground stations were recorded on the chronograph at the !iurface station. Many extraordinary difficulties . were encountered and overcome, and the observations were successfully completed.

This success was due to the familiarity of Professor McNair and of his two assistants, Professor Fisher and Mr. Osborne. with the conditions which were encountered in the mine, and to the uniform helpfulness of everyone connected with the mine who could assist in the work. The officers in control at the mine rendered assistance by furnishing men and material, and responded· at once to all reasonable requests, even to the extent of stopping certain operations in portions of the mine at considerable inconvenience to themselves. The genial and enthusiastic manner with which the officers of the mine aided this purely scientific undertaking, at considerable cost and inconvenience to themselves, was inspiring. The final computations have not been made, but the preliminary results indicate that the value of gravity was determined with a high degree of accuracy at all the stations, on the surface and underground. An ideal condition with respect to constancy of temperature existed at the lower underg~ound station, which was far below any other station at which gravity observations have been made, as determined from published results. The results obtained can be fully utilized in connection with the known density of the materia.1 in the mine.

Triangulation: 91 square miles area covered. 20 stations occupied. 40 geographic positions determined.

On July r the work of determining geographic positions on Chincoteague Island, Virginia, was in progress under the direction of Assistant Mosman, as stated in the report for the preceding year. The work was continued until July 1 r, on which date ~he operations in thi.~ vic;nity were completed, and on the 14th Assistant Mosman, proceeded to Frankford, Del. Mr. E. E. Torrey, foreman, reached this locality several clays earlier, and was engaged in searching for the stations of the old triangulation in the vicinity of Fenwick Island Lighthouse. This search was continued until July 20, but no old stations were found. Two days were spent in making a reconnaissance for triangulation south of the mouth of the Delaware River, and field operations then closed for the season. On July 29 Assistant Mosman reached Gloucester, Mass., under instructions to determine the geographic position of certain lighthouses on the coast of Massachusetts. A sufficient number of stations of the old triangulation in the vicinity of the lighthouses were recovered, and the lines between them were used as bases from which to determine the geographic positions desired. The positions of the following lighthouses were determined: Annisquan Harbor, Deer Island, Easten1 Point, Ipswich, Long Island Head, Marblehead, Narrows, Nauset, Straitsmouth, and also the position of the towers of the Marcopi wireless telegraph station near South \Vellfl.eet. The Marconi towers are four in number, arranged so as to form a square, with their centers 2 ro feet apart on the sides of the square. Each tower is 25 feet square at the base, 9 feet square at the top, and 210 feet in height. The observations at the station

Considerable changes in the shore line of the entrance to Sheepshead Bay, Long Island, New York, having been reported to the Office, Assistant Nelson was instructed to proceed to Manhattan Beach, Long Island, and examine the changes and secure the data for making the necessary corrections on the charts. He proceeded to the locality on July 2, and completed a preliminary survey of the entrance on July 7. The resurvey of Monomoy Island, Massachusetts, was then taken up, and K~istant Nelson reached Chatham on July 8. A party No. 17. was organized and several 70~0· days were spent in making a reconnaissance, in recovering stations in the former triangulation, and in erecting signals in the vicinity of Chatham and l\fonomoy Island. Continuous heavy rains, .'12' dense fogs, and strong gales of wind caused considerable delay, but the work was completed on August r4. The party then proceeded to Nantucket Island for 31" the purpose of locating the breakwater protecting the harbor and its approach, and of making a resurvey of the shore line of the harbor and of the new cut at the eastern end of Nantucket Bay. This new cut changes during every severe storm. Long sand spits are on each side of the entrance and they are constantly shifting. The work mentioned above Sta.-wi.. Miles was completed and the party !l 1 t i; 0 proceeded to Marblehead, Mass., on August 20, to take 0 11 3 up the topographic resurvey Topography, Massnchusetts. of Marblehead, Marblehead Neck, Salem, and Beverly. This work was continued until October 30, when the field work closed for the season. Many changes have been made since the previous survey in 1849 and 1850, and a complete topographic survey was made of the town of Marbl~head and of Marblehead Neck. Many changes were also noted in the shore line and interior topography in the vicinity of Salem and Beverly. New roads have been opened, railroads have been built, and hundreds of modern houses have been erected. Assistant Nelson reported for duty at the Office on October 3r.

In December the extension of the triangulation along the Pasquotank River and in Albemarle and Croatan sounds was assigned to Assistant Nelson. He proceeded to Elizabeth City, N. C., and reached that place on December 28. The work of reconnaissance was taken up immediately. Two old triangulation stations, Manns Point and North Base Bodies Island, were recovered and the triangulation was extended from the base furnished by the line between these stations. Launch No. 22, which had been assigned to the party and brought from Baltimore, was found to be unsuitable for use in the rough waters over which the work extended, and a small steamer was chartered and used as quarters for the party and as the means of transportation. In January the reconnaissance was extended from Bodies Island to Elizabeth City and it was necessary to place all except two of the stations on low, marshy ground, which required observing tripods and scaffolds from 10 to 40 feet in height. The lumber used in erecting these signals was towed on a barge "as near as possible to the stations and then rafted ashore and landed with much difficulty, as the water near the shore is very shallow. Cypress and juniper swamps cover the shores in this region, which change greatly as the result of wave action during storms. The party was compelled to use Elizabeth City as the base of supplies, and long trips were necessary to secure coal and prov1s1ons. In marking the triangulation stations, reference marks were placed in secure positions to guard against the loss of the stations by erosion. The triangulation was continued from February r to March 7, when the field work closed. Wind, rain, and smoke or haze prevailed during the greater portion of the time and seriously delayed the work. Assistant Nelson reports the efficient and valuable service rendered by Signalman J. S. Bilby.

A portion of the work of extending the Magnetic Survey in Virginia was assigned to Assistant Preston, and he was making magnetic observations at Wytheville, Va., on July I, in continuation of his work during the previous fiscal year. He continued this work until July 28, when he closed his wo~k in the field and proceeded to Washington, D. C., and made observations at the base station at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. The stations named above were occupied during the period stated, except the stations Bowling Green, Hanover, and Spottsylvania, at which magnetic observations were made between April 25 and May 2, when Assistant Preston was again in the field in Virginia, temporarily. Field work _finally closed for the fiscal year 011 May 2." The work in July was delayed by the difficulties of transportation, away from the railway, where the roads were of the roughest character and the journeys in wagons were long and tedious.

Extensive changes in the shore line at the entrance to Sheepshead Bay, Long Island, New York, having been reported to the Office, a resurvey in this locality was made under the direction of Assistant Rhodes. He reached Sheepshead Bay on August 18, and field work began on the 20th. Two stations, Bay View and Ruffle Bar 2, of the old triangulation were recovered, after spending considerable time in searching for other stations, and the line between these No. 20. stations was used as a base from Bay View which to determine the geographic positions necessary for the resurvey. The topographic work was extended as rapidly as the weather conditions permitted, but it was delayed by stormy weather and the difficulty of entering Sheepshead Bay at low water. The survey began at the hotels on Manhattan Beach and was extended far enough to the east to show all material changes. Two important changes were developed -a new entrance into Sheepshead Bay opposite the mouth of Hog Creek and the extension of Rockaway Point westward three-quarters of a mile. In September, Mr. C. A. Thompson, watch officer, was assigned to· the 1 party to assist in the hydrographic work, and the hydrographic examination of Rockaway Inlet began on Stab.rte Miles the 23d.

The resurvey of the shore line and hydrography at Chincoteague Island, Virginia, for the purpose of determining the changes that had taken place in Fishing Point and Chincoteague Shoals, was assigned to Assistant Rhodes, commanding the steamer Hydrographer. He took command of the ship at Washington on November 12, and started the vessel immediately to Chincoteague Island, via Norfolk, for supplies, in charge of First Watch Officer C. L. Green. The ship was delayed several days in Hampton Roads by unfavorable weather, and did not reach Chincoteague Island until November 2r. Assistant Rhodes joined the ship on November 24. The work consisted of a topographic resurvey of Fishing Point, extending as far back as the Assateague Beach Life-Saving Station, the hydrographic development of the anchorage inside the point, and as much work outside on the shoals as it was possible to do before December 18, on which date the work was suspended on account of continued unfavorable weather, and the vessel proceeded to Norfolk, Va. The weather was very stormy, with fresh breezes and gales of wind, and the work was necessarily carried on under unfavorable conditions.

The collection of the information necessary for the revtston of the Coast Pilot volumes covering the coast from St. Croix River, Maine, to Point Judith, Rhode Island, was in progress on July r under the direction of Nautical Expert John Ross. The ports and harbors within the limits stated were visited and inspected. At these places and along the routes followed changes affecting the Coast Pilot were noted, sailing lines were verified, and additional information regarding navigation in these waters was obtained from the captains of steamboats and coasting steamers and from fishermen. Special effort was made to obtain the draft of the largest vessels entering the different ports. Numerous isolated rocks and ledges were located and their positions determined. In a number of cases it was necessary to use a drag in searching for the rocks. The field work for the season closed on October 24, and the vessel proceeded to Washington, D. C. Mr. Ross reports his appreciation of the assistance rendered by the members of his party, Messrs. Graves, Green, Peerce, and Ogden, and states that the successful prosecution of the work was due to their able and careful cooperation.

The work at the Magnetic Observatory at Cheltenham, Md., was continued under the direction of L. G. Schultz, Magnetic Observer, and the record of the self-registering instruments for the year is practically unbroken.. Two sets of these instruments were in use at the base station and both were in operation almost all the time, and one or the other all the time. Continuous thermogram records were obtained in both the rooms where the self-registering instruments were in operation. Observations for absolute values were made four or five times each month during the year, and during July, August, and September two sets of instruments were used for absolute observations. Observations were made to determine the constants. of the large Edelmann magnetometer No. 26 from July to November, and this instrument was . used as the standard intensity instrument after September. The inductor No. 26 was used as the station standard beginning with April.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, I903.

The regular international term-day observations were made on the 1st and 15th of each month with the Adie eye~reading instruments and with one of the instruments in the obsen·atory for absolute observations. 'rhe Eschenhagen magnetograph "·as run on the two-hour rate during the term hours and from the 2d to 8th in December, January, and February it was run on the two hour rate for two full hours each day in cooperation with the Birkeland Polar Expedition. Observations to. determine atmospheric electricity were made on thirty-one days between October 1 and April 1 and on five of these days the observations were extended over twenty-four or thirty-six successive hours in order to obtain complete daily curves. These observations were the first to s:10w the peculiar conductivity effects about sunrise and sunset, which have since been noted on Mount Vesuvius, Italy. These observations also show in a remarkable manner the intimate relation between the daily variations of temperature and the electrical potential gradient of the air. The daily potential cun·e deduced from the observations at Cheltenham agrees very closely with the curves obtained from the observations made in Paris, France, at the Eiffel Tower, with the most refined instruments.

On July I a topographic party under the direction of Assistant Yinal was at work on the Potomac River. The work was continued until November 17, when the field work closed for the winter. The area surveyed lies between Lower Cedar Point and Blakistone Island in l\faryland, and between Rosier Creek and Komini Cliffs in Virginia. The topographic details were surveyed inland for distances varying from one-fourth to three-fourths of a mile. All buoys within the limits of the topographic sheets covering the area sun·eyed were carefully located on the sheets. Colonial Beach, Va., was the only place in this locality where the party could secure quarters during the summer excursion season, and consequently it was often necessary for the party

72

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

to travel long distances to and from work, which resulted in serious delay. As soon as practicable the party moved to River Springs, Md., to be nearer the working ground. The work was also delayed by sickness, which compelled two members of the party to return to their homes. C. A. Thompson, watch officer, was attached to the party from July 10 to September 16. Mr. W. G. Emory served faithfully and showed intelligent interest in the work until October 12, when he left on account of sickness.

Hydrography: 5 square miles area covered. 353 miles lines sounded. 15 212 soundings made. 3 hydrographic sheets completed.

A hydrographic resurvey of certain localities in the vicinity of Key West, Fla., was in progress on March 31,.under the direction of Assistant H. W. Rhodes, commanding the steamer Hydrographer, and on that date Assistant Vinal assumed command of the vessel, relieving Assistant Rhodes, whose services were needed elsewhere. On April 1 he reported to Assistant P. A. Welker, commanding the steamer Bache, who arrived at Key West on that date with orders to take general direction of the work in the vicinity. By direction of Assistant Welker, sounding in the anchorage was discontinued and the hydrographic development of the Sand Key Channel was taken up by the party on the Hydrograpker. Tide observations were made at the· Sand Key Lighthouse and on the lighthouse wharf at Key West, to furnish data for the reduction of the soundings. Sounding lines were run at intervals of 35 meters, and a large portion of the lines was also run over with the channel sweep, set to a depth of 5 fathoms. Isolated rocks were buoyed and developed by radial lines of soundings. The weather conditions during the season were fair, but the working ground was at a considerable distance from land, and the character of the survey required light winds and a smooth sea, so that only a portion of the time could be utilized for sounding. The vessel left Key West on June 9, and reached Norfolk on the 16th. Assistant Vinal reports that all the officers of the ship rendered faithful and efficient service, and expresses his appreciation of the aid he received from them.

WAINWRIGHT.

On July 1 experimetital work with wireless telegraph apparatus was in progress under the direction of Assistant Wainwright, for the purpose of ascertaining whether this method of sending signals could be adapted for use in the telegraphic longitude work of the Survey. As stated in the previous Annual Report, the tests were made between the Marconi wireless telegraph station at Sagaponack, on the eastern end of Long Island, New York, and the schooner Eagre, at various distances. The plan was to have the Eagre establish easy connection with the station on shore and then proceed

74

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

away from the station to determine the greatest distance at which it was practicable to exchange signals such as are used in the telegraphic longitude work. The standing rigging of the vessel consisted of wire rope set up with turn-buckles, which gave a continuous metallic connection from each topmast of almost 125 feet, and the vessel was used in this condition during the first tests, as stated in the previous report, which did not yield satisfactory results. For. the next trial, hemp rope was substituted for the wire rope of the standing rigging of the topmasts at the request of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, and at their expense. The tests were then repeated, other conditions remaining the same. The vessel went to a point about 30 miles west of the Marconi station and established the connection by exchanging signals, and started toward New York, after ascertaining that the conditions were favorable. Signals were exchanged between the vessel and the shore station every half hour as the vessel proceeded westward, and continued for an hour or more after the last intelligible message was received on hoard, at a distance of 63 miles. On board the schooner a break-circuit chronometer was included in the circuit of the battery and the sparking coil, by use of suitable relays, and in this way each break made by the chronometer was automatically sent as a time signal, which was recorded on the tape of the Morse recorder at the shore station. This method proved to be very satisfactory, and the results indicate that regularly spaced signals sent in this manner can be utilized for longitude determinations at a greater distance than it is possible to use verbal messages by the Morse code. The work closed on July 11. Later in July, Assistant Wainwright was assigned to the temporary command of the Blake, during the absence of Assistant Faris from July 16 to August 11. He took command of the ship at Baltimore on July I6, and sailed on the 19th for Hyannisport, Mass. The Blake reached Hyannisport on the 23d, and the hydrographic examination of a portion of Nantucket Sound lying south of Cross Rip light-ship was nearly completed before August I I, the date on which Assistant Faris resumed command, and the details of this work are included in the statement under his name. On August 12 Assistant .Wainwright resumed his duties in the office, and on September 20 proceeded to New Bedford, Mass., and went on board the Blake to install and test a channel and harbor sweep which had been devised at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. A description of this channel sweep is given in Appendix 6 to this Report. The apparatus was successfully installed and numerous tests were made, which demonstrated that the channel sweep was entirely practicable and satisfactory. The tests were concluded on September 30, and Assistant Wainwright returned to Washington. From January IS to 26 he was again in the field in charge of the installation of a channel and harbor sweep on board the steamer 1£.ydrograp!ter, and also engaged in testing a navigational sounding machine arranged for quick sounding. After the tests were over the sounding machine was brought back to the Office and some improvements were made, and it was again tested in May (5 to 7) while attached to a naphtha launch. In smooth water and not exceeding 5 fathoms in depth, and where the bottom is moderately regular, I5 soundings can be obtained per minute. The instant of contact of the lead with the bottom c~n he determined when the speed of the vessel is 5 miles per hour as accurately as when the speed is reduced to 3 miles per hour.

On the 24th the vessel was taken to the working ground and preparations were made for the resurvey of portions of Nantucket Shoals, and work on Pollock Rip Shoal began immediately. Until August 6 the weather was almost continuously foggy and very little was accomplished, but after that date the conditions were favorable, and the survey of this shoal was completed on August 20.

the use of the smaller boats except on a few days. The hydrographic survey in the vicinity of Monomoy Slue and Shovelful and Handkerchief shoals was then taken up. On account of the shoal water, breakers, and very strong currents it was necessary to do this work with small boats, and almost calm weather was required for .most of it. The work was difficult and the progress slow, but the work was completed on September 17. The water signals used in the work were removed, and on the r 8th the vessel proceeded to Boston.

only to the work executed by the party on the Bache in the survey of Southwest Channel. The necessary signals had been erected and their positions were known, so that the hydrographic work began without delay. Sounding lines were run approximately paralld to the axis of the channel and at intervals of 25 to 75 meters. The lines were crossed by other lines approximately at right angles to them, and about the same distance apart. All spots showing indications of shoals or coral heads were afterwards carefully examined and developed. The localities with less than 5 fathoms of water were examined for shoal spots by going over them with a drag. In all of the

work two leadsmen were continuously used, but only the starboard leadsman called out his soundings, except, that in cases where the port leadsman obtained less than 5 fathoms, his soundings were also called out and recorded. During the progress of the work the steamer Bao~e was twice called upon for special service. On May 2 the U.S. S. Atlanta grounded in the vicinity of buoy C17, and the commanding officer called for assistance, which was promptly rendered. The Baclte reached the Atlanta at 6 p. m., but the tide was unfavorable and nothing was accomplished before being relieved by the navy tug Osceola at 1 r p. 111. On Mays buoy C17 was moved to a new position in response to a request fro:n the Light-House Board. Tide observations were made at the wharf of the LightHouse Establishment, Key West, and at Sand Key Lighthouse, where a tide staff was established. The tide staff at the light-house wharf was connected with the United States Engineers' bench mark at Fort Taylor and referred to the one at Sand Key Lighthouse by simultaneous observations, thus reestablishing the old plane of reference for use in reducing the soundings. The field work was closed for the season on June 6, the vessel sailed for Old Point Comfort, Virginia, on the 9th, and reached that place on the 14th. HYDROGRAPHY. TOPOGRAPHY. TRIANGULATION.

COAST AND GEODETIC Sl:RVEY REPORT, 1903.

The resurvey of Kettle Bottom Shoals was in progress on July l under the direction of Assistant F. A. Young, commanding the steamer Endeavor. The work continued whenever the weather permitted until December 18, except during the period August 23 to September 2, when necessary repairs were being made, and from September 3 to 5, when the vessel was on other duty. A regular system with lines at intervals of 100 to 150 meters was carried out in making the soundings. All lumps were developed with care and all regions where lumps were shown as the result of former surveys were thoroughly examined. Nearly all these old shoals were found and several new ones were developed on the north side of the river. Soundings were made in a new channel passing close to Neals Point, which was dredged under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army. Tide observations were made at Colonial Beach during the whole season. On October 21 the vessel proceeded to Mattawoman Creek and completed a hydrographic and topographic survey along that creek to a point 6 miles above the mouth on November 2 r. Tide staffs were eo;;tablished at Stump Neck and at Grinders wharf, where observations were made for use in reducing the soundings. The vessel returned to Colonial Beach on November 21 and closed work for the winter on December 18, on which date the ship sailed for Baltimore. The Endeavor left Baltimore on May 29 and proceeded to Kettle Bottom Shoals to resume work. After stopping at various places on the way, the vessel reached Colonial Beach on June 4. The hydrographic work begun earlier in the fiscal year was continued from June 6 to 30, but the weather was unfavorable and the progress was slow. The statistics of the work done during this period are given above, and the work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

On July 1 the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was actively in progress under the direction of Assistant Bowie, with Assistant 0. W. Ferguson in charge of the second observing party, and Signalman Jasper S. Bilby in charge of a party engaged in the construction of the necessary observing tripods and scaffolds, which were all built in advance without delaying work of the observers. The organization of the parties and the instructions under which the work was done were stated in the previous report in connection with the work executed before July 1, and it is not necessary to repeat these details. On July I the observing parties were at work in the vicinity of the El Re_no Base in Oklahoma Territory. Rapid progress was made by both observing parties and the stations between the El Reno Base and the Anthony Base, in Kansas, were occupid previous to August r6, on which date the connection with the triangulation north of Anthony Base was completed. On July r 2 the signal building party went south, and the erection of signals between Bowie Base and Lampasas Base began on July 19. All the signals between these points and including the stations of the Lampasas Base net were completed on September .28. The

outfit was placed in storage and on October 3 the building party was disbanded and Signalman Bilby joined the observing parties. This closed a notable performance in the construction of observing tripods and scaffolds for use in triangulation, both in the time involved and the number of signals built. The success attained was made possible by the efficiency of Signalman Bilby and by the continuous employment of a trained party. The observing parties began work south of the Bowie Base net on August 28 and completed the work to the Lampasas Base, including the entire base net, on October 25 . . All the necessary preparations were made for closing the field work, and on Novembe~ 4 the party was disbanded. During this season, which began in March, as stated in the preceding Annual Report, the two observing parties occupied all the stations necessary to extend the triangulation 640 kilometers along the meridian. This invoh·ed the measurement of horizontal and vertical angles at 75 primary stations, and the season's work is remarkable for the distance covered and the small cost per station, a result which reflects great credit upon the two observers. Horizontal directions and vertical angles were measured during the day and at night petween 3 and half past I I p. m. Heliotropes were used until sunset, and observations on the lamps began about one hour afterwards. The signal lamp used is a modified acetylene bicycle lamp mounted on a frame capable of being leveled and easily pointed in any desired direction. This lamp was very satisfactory; it can be easily centered and pointed; is so constructed that it can not become overheated; is easily kept in order, and the flame is quite steady and is not materially affected by wind. It requires charging several times each night, which is a disadvantage, but not a serious one. Any necessary instructions were communicated to the light keepers by means of a code of signals. The tripods were not protected against wind during this season and guys were rarely put on the scaffolds. The signals were very rigid e,·en in strong wind, and only a few days were lost as a result of heavy vibration. The tripods were usually in the sunshine, but the observations showed no signs of twisting, and the levels on the instruments did not change materially during the observations. Observations were never discontinued at night on account of the lights being unsteady, but the observations in the afternoon did not begin until the heliotropes were steady enough to insure pointing within a range of two seconds between successive readings of the circle. The daily programme was to begin observing vertical angles at 3 o'clock in the afternoon on the heliotropes, if showing, or on some part of the signals if they were not visible, and these observations were usually made between 3 and 4 o'clock. As soon as the vertical angle observations were completed the observations of horizontal angles were begun if the atmospheric conditions permitted and were continued until a few minutes before sunset, when work was suspended for an hour and then continued until half-past 10 or I I o'clock, after which vertical angles were again measured. This usually concluded the work for the day, but occasionally the measurement of horizontal angles was resumed after the vertical angles had been measured. The following is quoted from the report of Assistant Bowie:
The success attained during the season is due to the faithful and efficient service rendered by the entire party. Special mention should be made of the ability and cooperation of Assistant Ferguson and Signalman Bilby, who were in charge of the second observing party and the building party,

As stated in the preceding Annual Report leveling along the ninety-eighth meridian was in progress on June 30 in Oklahoma Territory, near the Kansas line, under the charge of \V. H. Burger, aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey. After July r the work was extended north from Wakita, Okla., along the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad to Anthony, Kans., where connection was made, on July 12, with. bench marks established at this place in a line brought from the north during a previous season. The party then proceeded to Bowie, Tex., and began work on a line from that phce to Shreveport, La. The line began on the bench marks used by the party earlier in the season, during the previous fiscal year, in starting the line north to Anthony, Kans., and was extended along the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway from Bowie to the crossing of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway, 9 miles out of Fort Worth, and thence along the latter railway to Fort \Vorth. From this place the levels were carried over the Texas and Pacific Railway to Dallas; the line was compteted to that place on August 22. From Dallas the levels were carried over the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway to Shreveport, La. The distance between these places is longer by this route than over the Texas and Pacific Railway, but the officials of this latter railway refused permission for the party to use velocipede cars on their tracks and the longer route was selected as the velocipede cars greatly facilitate the leveling operations. Ralph L. Libby, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Survey, was assigned to the party for instruction in the methods of work, and reported for duty on October l. After this elate Mr. Libby made the observations about one-half the time, with Mr. Burger as instructor and recorder, and acted as recorder the rest of the time, while Mr. Burger made the observations. The line was completed to Shreveport, La., on November 18, when connection was made with the permanent bench marks established at that place under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, and connected by the U. S. Engineers with the Coast and Geodetic Suryey levels at Little Rock, Ark., Vicksburg, Miss., the mouth of Red River, and at other places.

The leveling party then returned to Fort Worth, Tex. , for the purpose of extending the line along the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway from that place to Granbury, Tex., en route to Comanche Peak, a station in the triangulation along the ninetyeighth meridian. The work was continued until November 30, when 23 kilometers of progress had been made. On this date Mr. Burger was relieved, and Mr. Libby was placed in charge of the party, and the account of the work subsequently executed is given under his name. The line was always leveled in both directions at least once, and such secti.ons as showed more than the allowed discrepancy between the results of the forward and backward lines were leveled more than once. Permanent bench marks were established at comparatively short intervals, with additional temporary bench marks between them, for the purpose of comparing the results obtained from the forward and backward lines. Over half the distance from Bowie to Fort Worth, the route was through a rough and heavily wooded section of the country, and the railway has numerous curves and heavy grades. In August, between Fort Worth and Dallas, the temperature was unusually high, and the party suffered a good deal from the lack of water, as the refusal of the railway company to permit the use of velocipede cars prevented the transportation of sufficient water for the use of the party, and the supply in that locality was limited and could not be readily obtained. Between Greenville and Shreveport the grades on the railway were very heavy and made the use of the velocipede cars very laborious.

Reconnaissance: 3 9<X> square miles area covered. 40 triangulation stations selected. Signal Building: 16 signals erected.

The extension of the reconnaissance along the ninety-eighth meridian northward from the vicinity of Mitchell, S. Dak., was assigned to Aid Burger. After making the necessary preparations at the Office, he proceeded to South Dakota and reached Mitchell on April 13. Signalman J. S. Bilby had been sent to Lampasas, Tex., in time to procure the necessary outfit for the reconnaissance and signal- building parties, stored at that place, and bring it north by rail. He also reached Mitchell on the 13th, and the preparations for active field work were completed. The triangulation stations Freeman and Wieters, established by Assistant F. D. Granger in 1901, were visited and found undisturbed, and the line between them was used as the base from which to extend the reconnaissance northward. After selecting two new stations the party returned to Mitchell, and Signalman Bilby, with Foreman William C. Nohl, began the work of building signals, while Aid Burger continued the work of reconnaissance. Signalman Bilby remained with the building party a short time to train the men, and then joined the reconnaissance party at Canova, S. Dak. The work of the building party proceeded

steadily, and they erected signals at 16 triangulation stations, with an aggregate height of 680 feet before the end of the fiscal year. In the early part of the season extremely heavy winds constantly prevailed and there was much cold weather. The condition of the roads made traveling difficult and also delayed the work. The scheme of triangulation was gradually swung eastward and carried across the northeast corner of South Dakota and up the east side of Red River. A base line was selected in Brown Valley, near the town of the same name, in South Dakota. and the ends were marked with heavy masonry piers. Forty triangulation stations were selected before June 30, which extended the scheme of triangulation from latitude 43° 30' north and longitude 97° 30' west to latitude 47° north and longitude 96° 3o' west. Aid Burger reports the valuable assistance rendered by Signalman Bilby and states that the work accomplished was due to a great extent to his intelligent and unceasing labor. The work of reconnaissance and signal building was in active progress at the close of the fiscal year.

On July 1 a leveling party was at work in Nebraska, under charge of Mr. \V. C. Dibrell, Aid, Coast and Geodetic Sun'ey, extending a line westward along the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, from a point 31 kilometers west of Chadron. Rapid progress was made, and on August 4 the line was completed to Orin Junction, \Vyo., where a junction was inade with the le\·els brought north from Cheyenne, Wyo., during the previous season. This completed the large circuit Abilene, Kans.; Denver, Colo.; Orin Junction, \Vyo., via Cheyenne; Norfolk, Nebr.; Abilene, Kans. The party then proceeded to Rock River, Wyo., to extend the levels westward from Rockcreek, formerly a station on the Union Pacific Railway, where the leveling work ended in 1899. Since that date the route of the railway has been shifted to straighten the road and improve the grades, and Rockcreek is now 11 kilometers off the railroad. The work began on three bench marks established at Rockcreek in 1899, two of which were found to have retained relative elevations determined when they were established, and the line was carried across the country to Wilcox, a point on the railroad 3 miles west of Rock River, and then continued along the· Union Pacific Railway to Red Desert, \Vyo., a station 80 kilometers west of Rawlins, where the work for the season was closed. The outfit was stored in the railroad-station building at Creston, Wyo., the only available place within a reasonable distance of Red Desert, through the courtesy of Mr. E. J. Krathmohl, the day telegraph operator at Creston, and the Survey is indebted to him for this favor and many others extended by him to the party. The party was discharged October 15, except one man, who proceeded with the Chief to Greenriver by rail, for the purpose of setting several stone bench marks which had been distributed along the route as far west as that ?lace. The return trip

to Creston was made on a velocipede car and the work above mentioned was done en route. Eleven stones were placed in position and two bench marks were cut on bridge abutments, and the work closed on October ig. Velocipede cars were used by the party throughout the season, except for a short time after leaving Rockcreek, when there was some delay in securing the necessary authority. The usual method of work was followed and the line was leveled at least once in each direction. Permanent bench marks were established at comparatively short intervals along the route, and intermediate temporary bench marks were determined for the purpose of comparing the results obtained from the forward and backward lines. The elevation of the top of the rail on the track in front of each railroad station on the route was determined. It was difficult to maintain the party at its full strength on account of the demand in this region for labor and the prevailing high wages, and after July I the party was shorthanded most of the time. Whenever one man was absent it was not practicable to protect the instrument from the wind and sun at the same time, and the instrument was used most of the time exposed to the wind, which was constant and very strong on the line west of Rockcreek. Very rapid progress was made at times during the season, and on one occasion 12.9 kilometers of double line were completed in one day. Mr. Dibrell reports his appreciation of the service rendered by the members of bis party, and makes special mention of George \V. Myers, rodman, who remained with the party during the whole season. Mr. King joined the party on September 12 for instructions in the method of work. He served until the close of the season, and used the instrument nearly all the time during October.

The extension of the standard levels of the Survey in Texas after December 1 was assigned to Aid Libby, who was already engaged on this work under the direction of Aid W. H. Burger. The account of the work of the party previous to that date is given under Mr. Burger's name. On December 1 Mr. Libby relieved Mr. Burger of the charge of the party and continued the line between Fort Worth, Tex., and the triangulation station Comanche near Granburry. Mr. Libby began work at a point 21 kilometers south of Fort Worth, and completed it to Comanche, a distance of 75 kilometers, on December 17. The route followed the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railway from Fort Worth to Granburry, and then across the country to the triangulation station Comanche. The party then returned to Fort Worth and extended the work southward to Temple, following the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, a distance of 199 kilometers. From Temple a line was leveled along the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway to Lampasas, a distance of 86 kilometers, to determine the elevation of Lampasas Base. This line determined the elevation of the triangulation stations Lampasas Northeast Base and Gilmore. The party returned to Temple on March 27 and extended the line south along the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway to Holland, Tex., a distance of 26 kilometers, where the work closed on April 9. The line was leveled in both directions, and temporary bench marks were established at short intervals to afford a means of comparing the results obtained on each line.

The work of extending the magnetic survey in Oklahoma and Texas was assigned to Assistant Little. He reached Amarillo, Tex., on July 26, and made observations to determine the three elements of the earth's magnetism in Texas and Oklahoma at the stations enumerated above. This work continued until December 25, except during an interval of twenty-three days when work was prevented by illness. At most of the stations a meridian line was established and marked. In nearly all the counties visited the county authorities were anxious to have a meridian line established and willingly furnished the necessary marks and the labor required. Field work in the Middle Division closed on December 24, and was continued in the Western Division.

A portion of the work of extending the magnetic survey in Kansas was assigned to Assistant Preston, and he left Washington on September 3, proceeding to Baldwin, Kans., where he tested his instruments by observations at the Magnetic Observatory, the base station to which work in this region is referred. The work continued until December 10, and during this period the stations named above, except Coolidge and Syracuse, were occupied, and observations were made at each to determine the elements of terrestrial magnetism. At several stations the work was delayed by unfavorable weather. At nearly all the stations a meridian line was established and marked, using stones and labor furnished by the county authorities. At a few places the county surveyor was not a practical surveyor and showed no interest in the work, and at these places a meridian line was not established, but the bearings of all prominent objects in sight were recorded. About the middle of the season the observer visited Baldwin and again tested his instruments at the observatory. Field work in Kansas closed on December 10, and Assistant Preston proceeded to Williams, Ariz., to continue work in the Western Division. He returned to Kansas on April 8, after completing work for the season in the Western Division, and occupied two stations, Coolidge and Syracuse. He completed the work at the latter place on the 14th, and then proceeded to Washington, D. C., to test bis instruments at the Coast and Geodetic Survey base station.

Hydrography: 501 miles lines sounded. IO 252 soundings made. 3 tide stations established. 2 hydrographic sheets c:>mpleted.

The hydrographic survey of San Juan Channel and Griffin Bay was assigned to Assistant Dickins. He made the necessary preparations and organized a party at San Francisco early in March. On the 7th Aid Jewell was directed to proceed to San Juan Island to obtain necessary local information, and on the 12th Assistant Dickins and his party sailed for Seattle. The steam launch Fuca was put in order for the use of the party, and on the 2 r st the launch Vi'xen was turned over to the party. On March 23 the party left Seattle on the launchesFuca and Vixen, and reached San Juan Island the next day. The field work began immediately in Griffin Bay. Old triangulation stations were recovered, the necessary signals were erected, and a tide staff was established at Argyle wharf, where observations were made day and night from March 29 to May 9. The hydrographic survey of Griffin Bay was completed on May 4, and the party moved to Richardson, where another· tide staff was established and connected with the one at Argyle wharf by making simultaneous observations during three days. Tide observations were made at Richardson day and night between May 5 and 29. Triangulation stations in this vicinity were recovered, the necessary signals were erected, and the hydrographic work began on May 12. The work was continued whenever the weather permitted until May 29, when the field work closed to enable the officers in the party to report for duty elsewhere. On May 30 the party returned to Seattle, and was disbanded on the 31st. Assistant Dickins reports that special credit is due Watch Officers Hunter and Stanford for the able manner in which the hydrography was done. Aid Jewell acted as recorder in the hydrographic work.

The survey of Lake Washington, Washington, was assigned to Assistant French, who reached Seattle on July 25 and organized a party immediately. A reconnaissance of the lake was made, and the work of opening the lines and erecting the signals began without delay. The instruments were not received as soon as expected, and no observations were made until August 15, when the chief 'of the party began observing horizontal angles. Mr. F. B. Loren, Aid, continued the erection of signals until that work was com.pleted on the 19th, when he began observing, and Assistant French took up the topographic work. The triangulation was extended across the city of Seattle from the line between Freeport and Alder 2, two stations in the Puget Sound triangulation. In extending the work around the lake, single triangles were used, but all the angles were observed. Nearly all the observations in the work covering the southern half of the lake were made by Mr. Loren. The numerous geographic positions determined made the topographic work comparatively simple, but the dense growth of brush, etc., along the shore line made it impracticable to extend the topography far away from the shore

line without too great an expenditure of time and money. A width of at least a quarter of a mile was covered around the greater portion of the lake, and the contours were sketched as far back as necessary to develop the elevations up to 100 feet, but the contours are only accurate in a general way, as the woods and brush prevented their precise location without unwarranted expense. All the topographic work was completed between August 19 and September 22, and the work of sounding began 011 August 25 and was continued as rapidly as practicable until the survey \Vas completed. The lake may be described in a general way as a large basin with steep slopes near the shores, and having a depth, in the main body, of about 200 feet. The bottom is much more smooth than the relief of the surrounding country indicates, and with the exception of a small ridge just west of East Seattle, the bottom of the lake is practically a smooth trough with its sides parallel to the shores of the lake, and with its depth varying with the width of the lake. A tide staff was erected at Madison Park, and readings were made on it nearly every day from August 13 to November 25 for the purpose of obtaining a plane of reference for the soundings There was a range in the depth of water during this period of about 1 foot, but no effect clue to the direction of the wind was obsen·ecl. The hydrographic work was completed on November 20, the party was disbanded immediately, and Messrs. French and Loren proceeded to \Vashington, D. C. The extension of the triangulation northward from the vicinity of Eugene, Oreg., was assigned to Assistant French, who made the necessary preparatiops and left \Vashington on April 1, and reached Eugene on the 12th, after stopping at San Francisco long enough to select such outfit as was suitable for his work from the Survey property stored at that place. The preparations for field work were completed and the work of reconnaissance progressed as rapidly as the weather conditions permitted. A preliminary examination was made between Eugene and Portland before the end of April. D. A. Lewis, foreman, joined the party in the latter part of April, and rendered efficient sen-ice in the reconnaissance work. Unfavorable weather prevailed during more than two-thirds of the month of May and caused serious delay in the work. A building party began operations on May 21, under charge of foreman Lewis, and visited and prepared seven triangulation stations before the encl of June. This party marked the stations, erected stands for instruments and lights, prepared camping ground for the observing party, opened trails or roads to the stations, and collected information to facilitate the work of the observing party. The observing party reached the foot of Saddle Mountain, upon which Station Roman is located, on May 29. A trail 7 miles long was opened in order to reach the station. Owing to the difficulty of procuring extra labor this work delayed the party until June 9, when it was completed. During the remainder of the month fogs and clouds prevailed most of the time, but the necessary observations were obtained and the station was completed. 'fhe lack of training and attention to duty on the part of the heliotropers also delayed the work. The work was actively in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

The extension of the standard levels west from Red Desert, Wyo., was assigned to Mr. H. D. King, Aid, and he reached Rawlins, Wyo., on May r 6. A party was organized, the necessary preparations were made, and the field work began at Red Desert on the 20th. The work continued during the remainder of May and during June, with the results shown above, and was in progress on June 30, on which date it was completed to a point r 3 miles east of Greenriver, Wyo. The route followed the Union Pacific Railway, and velocipede cars were used as the means of transportation. The line was leveled at least twice, once in each direction. Temporary bench marks were established at short intervals to afford a means of comparing the results of leveling in opposite directions, and these sections of the line were releveled when the discrepancy developed exceeded the allowable amount.

The extension of the standard levels east from Ogden, Utah, was assigned to Aid Libby. He reached Ogden on April 29, organized a party, and on 1.fay 2 began the field work. The route followed the Union Pacific Railway, and on June 30 the line had been completed to a point a few miles from Spring Valley, Wyo. The heavy grades, strong prevailing winds, and four tunnels on the line seriously delayed the work. Two of the tunnels were short enough to carry the line through them by using lanterns aud reflectors, but at each of the others it was necessary to carry the line over the mountains, as repairs were being made in one tunnel and the other is nearly 2 kilometers long. The mountains are rough and steep, and the wind on the western slopes was unusually strong, rendering the work very slow and laborious.

Magnetic work in the Western Division was assigned .to Assistant Little, and on December 25 he started to Phoenix, Ariz., to make special observations in cooperation with Assistant Preston, who had also gone to that place, for the purpose of comparing the instruments in use. These observations and the necessary computations extended over the period January 2 to I2 and the office work continued until January 17. On the 18th Assistant Little went to Yuma and began magnetic observations at the series of stations assigned to him, which are included in the list given above. Work was continued, except during twenty-six days, when he was not well enough to work, aud during thirty-eight days when he was engaged on computations. On May 16 magnetic observations began at Lordsburg, N. Mex., and were madeat the series of stations named above, and the field work for the season closed at Deming, N. Mex., on May 30.

A portion of the work of extending the magnetic survey in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico was assigned to Assistant Preston, who reached Williams, Ariz., on December 13. Magnetic observations were made at Williams and at Ashfork, and the observer then proceeded to Phoenix. A snow storm at Williams delayed the work at that place. At Phoenix special observations were made in order to compare the instruments used by Assistant Preston with those used by Assistant Little, who was also at Phoenix for that purpose. A special investigation was made to determine the most suitable location for a magnetic observatory in the vicinity of Phoenix. A number of stations were occupied and a desirable location was found. The special observations were concluded on January 13. A similar investigation was made in the vicinity of Flagstaff between February 24 and March 2, and detailed reports were made giving the results of these investigations. Magnetic work was continued in Arizona until March 16, and the stations named above

The suboffice of the Survey in San Francisco was continued under charge of Assistant Rodgers, who attended to numerous duties, many of them matters of routine, as the representative of the Superintendent on the Pacific coast. He purchased and forwarded outfit to the various parties in the field when requested to do so, and arranged for the transportation of men between San Francisco and Manila. Many matters requiring immediate action on the Pacific coast were referred to Assistant Rodgers by telegraph. From December 11 to January 31, Assistant Rodgers was absent on other duty, and Assistant Fremont Morse was in charge of the suboffice. Various officers were attached temporarily to the suboffice during the year and others were on duty there completing records of field work. On October 16 Assistant Rodgers inspected the Bluff Point speed trial course, under telegraphic orders, and reported its condition to Capt. F. W. Dickins, U. S. Navy. On October 27 William J. Diercks, messenger attached to the suboffice, died suddenly, after many years of faithful service in the field and office. H. S. Ballard continued on duty as tide observer at the Presidio Station, anfl rendered faithful service in securing observations during the year. Mr. John S.

On July I the steamer Gedne;i, Assistant Dickins, commanding, was at Seattle, \Vash., completing preparations for a season's work in southeastern Alaska. The Gedne;i left Seattle on July 3 and proceeded to Icy Strait, Alaska, via Victoria and Union Bay, British Columbia, where stores and coal were taken on board. On July IO signal lumber was taken on board at Ketchikan, Alaska, and the vessel went to Fanshaw Bay and anchored for the purpose of determining the position of a lighthouse which had been erected on southeast Five Finger Island. After considerable difficulty some of the old triangulation stations in the vicinity were recovered and a base was secured from which the geographic position of the light-house was determined. The vessel continued her journey on the 14th, and about 7 o'clock that evening, while steaming up Stevens Passage, the \veather being perfectly clear and 110 drift logs or floating ice in the strait, a sudden shock was felt, and an examination disclosed the fact that the vessel had lost one blade of her propeller. The vessel proceeded to Juneau with reduced speed and reported the fact hy telegraph. While waiting for further

The GedneJ' left for Sitka on the 22d and was detained there until the 30th putting the Cosmos and launch No. r r 7 in working order. The vessel reached Hooniah ou August 1, and the work in this vicinity began the next day. A tide staff was erected

102

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

at Hooniah, and a reconnaissance was made of the upper part of Port Frederic. An attempt was made to establish a tide staff in Bartlett Bay, but the floating ice prevented. Ou August 6 the vessel left Bartlett Bay for Inian Cove, and in crossing the entrance to Glacier Bay, where the ice floes were very thick, was caught in a heavy swi~l and was struck by a large berg, which smashed in three planks, an iron frame, and one of the cabin portholes. The floating ice was thicker than usual, and caused considerable trouble and delay during the season. A tide staff was erected in Inian Cove on August 7, and tide observations began. Mr. Weld was left in charge of operations at Inian Cove, and the commanding officer returned on the Cosmos to Hooniah and made tide observations for three days in connection with those at Inian Cove. While at Hooniah Mr. Atkinson, watch officer, reported on board the Cosmos. The Cosmos left Hooniah on August I I, and an examination was made of Willoughby Cove and Mud Bay for the purpose of finding a location for a tide staff and a safe anchorage for the Gedney, but the ice was too thick in both places, and the Cosmos returned to Inian Cove. Good progress had been made in erecting signals, and hydrographic and topographic work were begun at once. On August 17 Mr. Palmer was relieved from duty and sent to Hoouiah, en route to San Francisco. The supply of coal and lumber was nearly exhausted, and on August 30 the vessel proceeded to Juneau for a new supply. On September 1 the vessel was beached near the Douglas Island wharf, and the propeller blade opposite the one that was lost earlier in the season was cut off. The vessel left Juneau on September 5, and returned to the working ground. A tide staff was erected in Mud Bay and connected by simultaneous observations with the tide at Inian Cove. The work was continued in the vicinity of Mud Bay until September 25, when a tide staff was erected in a small cove on the east side of Idaho Inlet and connected by simultaneous observations with the tide at Inian Cove. The hydrography and topography of Idaho Inlet were completed on October 3, and the vessel proceeded to Mud Bay. The tide staff there was verified in position, and another was erected in Flynn Cove and connected with Hooniah and Mud Bay by simultaneous observations. A reexamination of Pleasant Island Reef, which bares at low water, was completed on October 7, and on the following day the tide staff was· removed and the work of the season closed. During the season the geographic positions of the light-houses at Five Finger Island and at Sentinel Island were determined, and the hydrography and topography of Icy Strait from Point Adolphus to the Inian Islands were completed, closing the gap between the surveys made by the Patterson and the GedneJ' in 19or. A plane table triangulation of Dundas Bay and Idaho Inlet was made, and the hydrography and topography at these points were completed. The hydrography was executed by Messrs. Atkinson and Stanford, using steam launch No. 117, which was fitted with a wire sounding reel, the hand lead being used only when approaching the shore in shoal water and in developing reefs and shoals. The sounding lines were generally about a quarter of a mile apart, and the position of each sounding was determined. In approaching the shore the soundings were taken often enough to develop the dangers thoroughly. The topographic work was done by Messrs. Weld and Parker. Mr. Weld used the ship's launch and did most of the work in the vicinity of the anchorages, returning to the ship at night; while Mr. Parker lived on board the Cosmos and did the work distant from the ship, only returning once a week for coal and supplies.

The shore line was carefully surveyed and many peaks visible from it were located and their heights determined, but the ridges generally rise so abruptly from the shore that the topography was necessarily sketched from the opposite side of the strait. The country as a rule is densely timbered from the shore to an elevation of 1 500 to 2 ooo feet, above which the ridges are clear of timber and the mountains are capped with snow. On October 9 the vessel left Hooniah for Sitka and reached there next day, having left the Cosmos at Killisnoo. Launch No. 117 was hauled out and housed, minor repairs were made, and the ship rdurned to Killisnoo on the 15th. The next morning the Gedne;', with the Cosmos in tow and with the McArthur following, sailed for Seattle, and arrived there on October 23. Assistant Dickins refers to the work done by his officers and reports that he found Mr. Weld "an able assistant and a competent officer;" that Mr. Atkinson" performed all his work and duties in a creditable manner;" that he found Mr. Parker "a competent assistant and officer and that he performed all his duties cheerfully and well;'' that Mr. Stanford was ''steady and industrious and performed all his duties cheerfully and well." James Mitchell, assistant engineer in charge, the boatswain, master-at-arms, and carpenter all receive favorable mention for the cheerful and creditable manner in which they performed all their duties.

The magnetic work at the Sitka, Alaska, Magnetic Observatory, was continued under the direction of H. M. Vl. Edmonds, Magnetic Observer. W. B. Keeling, Magnetic Observer, reported to Mr. Edmonds on July 16, 1902, and assisted in the work after that date. Necessary improvements were made to the buildings and grounds. The hard-wood caps to the piers on which the instruments were mounted proved to be unsatisfactory and marble was substituted. An astronomic station was established on the reservation near the magnetic station and the station previously used was marked by a concrete block and two brass bolts marking the astronomic and 111agnetic stations. The record of the declination and horizontal intensity obtained on the self-registering instruments was practically continuous throughout the year. Observations for declination and horizontal intensity were made twice a week to furnish the data necessary to reduce the relative observations obtained from the record of the self-registering instruments. Observations for dip and for relative total intensity with loaded dip needles were also made twice each week. Special observations were made twice each 111onth in accordance with the plan for international cooperation in magnetic work in connection with the expeditions sent out to the south polar regions. In connection with the magnetic work, time and azimuth observations were made as required, meteorological conditions were noted and maximum and minimum thermo111eter readings were made every day.

metric method was assigned to Assistant Eirnbeck. He proceeded to Seattle, Wash., and reported on board the Patterson, Assistant J. F. Pratt, commanding, on July 10, for duty en route to his station. The ship reached St. Michaels on August 14, and the necessary :material and outfit were landed immediately. A station was selected and a concrete pier and wooden observatory was erected under the direction of Assistant Pratt, this work being completed on August 16, and then Assistant Eimbeck assumed charge of the station as chief of party, under his instructions from the Superintendent. The astronomical transit was placed in position on August 17, and observations for time were made on the same date and chronometer comparisons were made on shore and on the Patterson. The observations and comparisons were repeated daily whenever the weather conditions permitted until the 23d, when the concrete pier began to settle unequally, due to heat conducted to the frozen ground on which the pier was built, all ground in this region remaining frozen continuously a short distance below the surface. The necessary changes to secure permanency were made on the morning of the 24th, under Assistant Pratt's direction, and the ship left at 110011. After the departure of the Patterson to carry the chronometers to the other stations, intercomparisons of the three chronometers at the station were made daily and time observations were made whenever the atmospheric conditions permitted. Four comparisons between the chronometers on shore at St. Michaels and those on the Patterson were made during the season, which extended to September 27, when the Patterson sailed from St. Michaels. During- the equinoxial period the weather was changeable and decidedly unfavorable for astronomic work at night, while the afternoon hours were frequently clear. A star list suitable for observing in daylight was prepared and observations were made whenever the weather conditions permitted day or night, and thus nineteen sets of time observations were secured, the last being made on September 24. The three chronometers at the station were always compared before and after each set of observations for time. The passage of the sun's center over the meridian of the station was also observed a few times by placing a screen over the object glass of the telescope in order to cover all of it, except a quarter inch aperture or slit at the center. The magnetic declination was determined at one station previously established and at four new stations. These stations were referred to the astronomic station by triangulation and tape measurement.

The duty of making the astronomic observations at Nunivak Island, Alaska, which were required in com1ection wit~1 the determination of the difference in longitude between St. Michael, as the base station, and Cape Mohican, the western point of the island, by the chronometric method, was assigned to Assistant Morse. On July I he was attached to the steamer Patterson, Assistant J. F. Pratt, commanding, for duty en route to his station. On August 6 the ship reached Nunivak Island, and a site for the astronomic station was selected at the nearest landing place to Cape Mohican, about twelve miles to the eastward. A rough building co.1taining a room for the observatory, with concrete pier for the transit, and rooms for the officers at'1d men was immediately erected under Assistant Pratt's direction, and the ship's writer, two men, and the cabin steward were assigned to duty under Assistant Morse to aid in the exectltion of the work under his charge. Solar observations were made on August 7 for time and latitude, a comparison was made between the chronometers at the station and those on board ship, and the Patterson sailed for St. Lawrence Island the following night. Preparations were made immediately to make astronomic observations on every clear night and to connect the station and Cape Mohican by plane table triangulation. A base line was measured and progress was made on every fair day. The necessary signals were erected and their positions and elevations were determined previous to August 24. A survey of the shore within reach of the station was made and as much interior topography was surveyed as the time permitted (see illustration 31). This work was very laborious, as no means of transportation existed, and all material was necessarily carried by the men. Long distances were traversed on foot, and work near Cape Mohican involved walking from ten to twelve hours per day. In spite of all obstacles the desired connection was successfully accomplished. Obsen·ations from time were made on every clear night, and observations were also made to determine the latitude a;1d an azimuth. The Patterson returned to the island on August 26, September 5, and September 23, and a comparison was made on each occasion between the chronometers at the station and those on board the ship. On September 5, Mr. A. L. Giacomini, deck officer, and a seaman, were also assigned to duty under the direction of Assistant Morse, and aided in the work after that date. On September 23, Assistant Morse and party were taken on board the Patterson, and the work at Nunivak Island closed.

the officers of the steamer Patterson, with Assistant Pratt in command. Assistants Eimbeck, Smith, and Morse were instructed to join the ship, reporting to Assistant Pratt for the purpose of performing such duties as were assigned to them while on board, and upon teaching their destination to take station at St. Michael, St. Lawrence Island, and Nunivak Island, respectively, and occupy astronomic stations as chief of parties while on shore. At the end of the se~on these officers again reported to Assistant Pratt, and served on board the ship on the voyage home. Details of the operations on shore at the three astronomic stations mentioned above are given under the names of the three· officers in charge of the stations. The Patterson sailed from Seattle, Wash., on July 19 for Dutch Harbor direct and reached that port on July 30. The voyage was uneventful except that the ship sailed for a portion of one day through floating lava (pumice stone) 200 miles off the Davidson Banks. While the ship was taking on coal and water at Dutch Harbor, time observations were made at the astronomic station at Unalaska. On August 2 the ship sailed for Nunivak Island and arrived there on the 6th. A site for the astronomic station was selected at the nearest landing place to Cape Mohican, about 12 miles to the eastward, and a rough building, containing a room for the observatory and rooms for the officers and men, was immediately erected. The ship's writer, two men, and the cabin steward were assigned to Assistant Morse to aid in the work at this station. On August 8 the ship proceeded to St. Lawrence Island and reached the Northeast Cape at daybreak the next morning, and the vessel was anchored after making a careful examination of the shores on the north and east sides. A site for the astronomic station was selected about 2~ miles to the southward from the extremity of Northeast Cape and a building similar to the one at Nunivak Island was erected. Don R. Jewell, Aid, two men, and the wardroom cook were assigned to Assistant Smith to aid in the work at this station. The ship started to St. Michael on August 13 and arrived there the following day. The pier at the astronomic station already established at this place was not l~rge enough to mount the transit which had been assigned to the station, and it was necessary to remove the original pier, a cylindrical log·of wood erected in 1890 by Assistant Turner, and construct a concrete pier of larger size. An excavation was made down into the ice, a concrete pier with an enlarged base was erected, and a small wooden observatory was constructed around it. Assistant Eimbeck took charge of the station without the detail of any men from the ship. The steamer Yukon was launched and put in temporary condition and sent to Dutch Harbor under command of Watch Officer Throckmorton. The ship then proceeded with the work of carrying chronometers between the astronomic stations and the exchanges were made as rapidly as the local conditions permitted, and resulted in the determination of the westerly end of Nunivak Island and of the Northeast Cape of St. Lawrence Island three times from Unalaska and four times from St. Michael. A hydrographic reconnaissance was made along the routes of the ship between the astronomic stations by making 874 soundings on 3 666 miles of route traversed. The soundings were plotted on three hydrographic sheets. During the night of September 11, with the worst storm of the season prevailing, the rudder stock was carried away. The ship was hove to under sail until daybreak, when a temporary steering geer was constructed and the vessel proceeded to Dutch Harbor for repairs. The weather had become so unfavorable that the vessel started

north on September 20, to pick up the shore parties as soon as possible and return to Seattle. All the men and material (including the remaining outfit which was stored at St. Michael) had been taken on board by September 27, and on that date the vessel started south. At Dutch Harbor five days were spent in laying up the steamer 'Yukon and the launches Alpha and Delta. On October 7 the vessel sailed for Seattle and reached that port on October 16. The following extracts are taken from Assistant Pratt's report:
I wish particularly to emphasize the great assistance Mr. Morse rendered me in organizing the party and in equipping the expedition at the outset and in completing the details of office work at the close of the season. All the work pertaining to the shipping of men devolved upon Deck Officer Giacomini, and he executed it in a most satisfactory manner. Assistant Surgeon MeLoughlin, in addition to his regular professional duties, intercompared the chronometers on shipboard and assisted generally in the office work, and after the ship became short handed he took regular day's duty as acting watch officer. Doctor McLoughlin is professionally unusually well qualified for his position, and, due to his high, stable character and desire to assist whenever he may be useful in the work, is a most desirable adjunct to the service. Mr. Hathaway, acting captain's clerk, proved to be a most excellent young man and became efficient and perfectly satisfactory.

SUMMARY OF RESUL'l'S.

Hydrography: 320 miles of deep-sea soundings. 68 soundings made. ·Magnetic observations: 3 stations occupied.

The survey of Controller Bay, Alaska, and of a portion of Prince William Sound was assigned to Assistant Pratt, commanding the steamer Patterson. He was also instructed to carry a line of deep-sea soundings from the entrance to Juan de Fuca Strait to Sitka, Alaska, to obtain information desired by Gen. A. W. Greely, Chief Signal Officer, U. S. Army, for use in laying a cable from Seattle to Alaska. All necessary preparations were made, and the Patterson sailed from Seattle, Wash., on June 17 via Union Bay and Victoria, British Columbia. The vessel reached Neah Bay on the 22d, and was detained there by unfavorable weather until June 25, on which date the work began. During the latter part of the 26th and first part of the 27th the sea was running too high for sounding, and five hours were lost on the 28th as the

The survey of Prince William Sound, Alaska, was in progress on July 1 by a party under the direction of Assistant Ritter, and the following statement applies to the work of the whole season, but the statistics refer to the work executed between July 1 and September 30, when the field work closed. On that date the weather had become stormy, and afte_r some delay on account of unfavorable weather the party returned to Orea on the small steamer Taku, which had been used by the party during the season. The outfit was stored and the boats were laid up, the Taku being left under the charge of a ship keeper. Assistant Ritter reports that the thanks of the Survey are due to Mr. Walter Storey, the superintendent of Alaska Packers' Association cannery, for his kindness in extending facilities and aid to the party. The party left Orea on October 15 and arrived at Seattle, Wash., on the 24th. The area sounded covered the western end of Valdes Arm, from a point ? miles east of the narrows to Point Freemantle, including Jacks Bay, Galena Bay, the two arms extending inland from the southern side of Valdes Arm, and the bay on the north side of the arm, locally known as Sawmill Bay. This portion of Valdes Arm is about 18 miles long. At its western end it is 8 miles wide, and gradually narrows to I mile at the narrows. Galena Bay extends inland about 7 miles and is from 1 to r ~ miles wide. Jacks Bay is 1 mile wide at the entrance and one-half mile wide at its upper end. It extends inland about 7 miles. Sawmill Bay has an average width of about half a mile and extends inlaJ1d about 2 miles. From the western end of Valdes Arm the soundings were extended in a southerly direction as far as the southern end of Bligh Island. The area covered extends from the western shore of Bligh Island out to deep water and includes the development of the submerged reef and shoal lying to the westward of the island. Soundings were made between Bligh Island and the mainland connecting Valdes and Fidalgo arms and the.adjacent bays, called Virgin, Cloudman, and Boulder, and a few lines were extended out from the southern shore of Bligh

Island. Assistant Ritter reports that Messrs. Henry Bernhardt, C. I. Rhodes, and George B. Lorenz assisted in the hydrographic work, and states that much of the success of the season's work was due to their commendable proficiency and cheerful cooperation in meeting the disagreeable conditions frequently met with in executing field work in this section. Tide observations were made for the purpose of reducing the soundings on tide staffs in Jacks Bay and at Rocky Point. A number of observations were made to determine the strength and directions of currents by using a weighted pole, with 18 to 20 feet of its length immersed. This pole was allowed to drift and was followed in a boat to determine its position at interrnls of ten minutes. The topographic work consisted of the completion of the shore line along the northern, western, and southern shore of Bligh Island, and on the southeastern encl of Glacier Island, by surveying between the isolated portions previously surveyed. The survey in Prince \Villiam Sound and adjacent waters was continued, under the direction of Assistant Ritter, in May, 1903. He left San Francisco with his party on May 1 and reached Orea, Alaska, on the 17th. Necessary repairs were made to the steamer Taku and to the launch and boats assigned to the use of the party, and the party went into camp at Snug Corner Cove. Hydrographic work began on May 28 and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year.

Astronomic observations determined: 1 azimuth. I latitude determined. I longitude determined. Topography: 90 square miles area covered. 25 miles shore line surveyed. 100 miles shore line creeks and ponds surveyed. 1 topographic sheet completed.

The duty of making the astronomic observations on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, which were required in connection with the determination of the difference in longitude between St. Michael as the base station and Northeast Cape, on St. Lawrence Island, by the chronometric method, was assigned to Assistant Smith. He proceeded to Seattle, Wash., and reported on board the steamer Patterson, Assistant J. F. Pratt, commanding, on July r 1, for duty, en route to his station. The ship reached St. Lawrence Island on August 8, but the shores were uninviting and'no landing could be made until the next clay. A station was finally selected well back from the shore and about 2 0 miles to the southward from the extremity of Northeast Cape. Lumber, equipage, instruments, stores, etc., were landed, and a rough building, containing a room for the obsen·atory, with concrete pier for the instrument, and rooms for the officers and men, was erected under Assistant Pratt's direction, and Mr. D. R. Jewell, Aid, two men, and the wardroom cook were assigned to duty, under Assistant Smith, to aid in executing the work under his charge. Time observa-

tions were obtained on August I2, and the Patterson sailed for St. Michael on August I3. Preparations were made to make a topographic survey of as much of Northeast Cape and vicinity as could be reached from the station (see illustration 31). A base line was measured and the signals necessary for the plane table triangulation were erected. No means of transportation existed and long distances were traveled on foot, which made the work slow and laborious. Mr. Jewell executed part of the topographic work and deserves credit for the energy and ability displayed. Fogs prevailed a por.tion of the time and delayed the work. Observations for time were made on I8 nights, and for azimuth on 16 nights. The latitude was detennined from observations made on four nights. The Patterson visited the station on August 25, September 9, II, and 24, and a comparison was made on these dates between the chronometers at the station and those on board the ship. On September 24 the work closed and the party and outfit were taken on board the steamer. HYDROGRAPHY. MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. RECONNAISSANCE. TOPOGRAPHY. TRIANGULATION.

Johnstone and Knowles Head was selected as the base from which to extend the triangulation to the entrance of the sound. A self-registering tide gauge was established on an island in Mosquito Bight on the southeast shore of Port Etches. On July s a consultation was held with Assistant Ritter who was already at work in this locality, and all available information concerning the waters with which he was familiar was obtained. On July 12 a sufficient number of triangulation stations had been selected and prepared and on that date the observation of angles began. On July 16 a topographic party under Mr. Christman was organized on board the Schooner Olga, which was chartered for the purpose and placed at work in the vicinity of Johnstone Point. On the 22d Assistant Flynn was left in charge of the topographic party while the McArthur went to Orea for coal, but resumed work on the triangulation when the ship returned. All branches of the work progressed as rapidly as the weather conditions pennitted until September 24, when the field work was closed for the season. Storms and thick weather delayed the work considerably, and on some occasions it was necessary to get up steam and leave an anchorage which had become unsafe from a change in the direction or force of the wind. The results accomplished are shown in the statistics given above and indicated on the accompanying sketch. The ship was ready to sail from Orea on September 28, but a gale caused delay until October 2, when the vessel proceeded to Flynn Cove, Cross Sound, to consult Assistant Dickins, commanding the Gedney, who was anchored there. While on the way examinations of reefs were made and information was collected for use in the Coast Pilot. The. vessel proceeded to Killisnoo, via Juneau, and on October 16 sailed in company with the Gedney for Seattle, via Union Bay and Victoria, and reached that place on October 24. Assistant W estdahl in his report commends the officers in his party for the faithful performance of the duties assigned to them, and mentions especially the skill and energy displayed by Assistant Flynn in executing the triangulation.

The work in the Hawaiian Islands, except the Magnetic Observatory, was continued under the direction of Assistant Alexai1der. The preparation of the register of the geographic positions determined by the triangulation of the islands, under the direction of the Hawaiian government, before the annexation by the United States, was continued. The portion of the register covering Kauai and Oahu was completed and forwarded to the Office in December. A list of capes, rivers, towns, etc., in the islands was prepared to supplement the list of Hawaiian geographic names already furnished. A table of the magnetic declination at various stations in the islands was compiled from the records of the Territorial survey. The register of geographic positions and elevations on Molokai was completed. The automatic tide gauge at Honolulu was kept in operation. Assistant Alexander aided in conducting civil-service examinations and in rating examination papers when required, and performed other special temporary duty in addition to his regular work.
ASTRONOMIC OBSERVATIONS. HAWAII.

EDWIN S:\HTH.
FREMONT MORSE.

The completion of the submarine cable between San Francisco, Cal., and Honolulu, Hawaii, furnished the means of adding this important station to the telegraphic longitude system which has been extended over the continental portion of the United States by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Assistants Smith and Morse were instructed to make the necessary preparations and take station at Honolulu and San Francisco, respectively, to determine the difference in longitude between these places. Permission to use the cable for this purpose was courteously granted to the Survey by Mr. George G. Ward, vice-president and general manager of the Commercial Cable Company, and the thanks of the Survey are due his company for this generous privilege. On a previous occasion, many years ago, Mr. Ward had shown his interest in this important work by doing all in his power to aid the observers in the determination of the transAtlantic difference of longitude when he was an operator in the cable office at one end of the line. Assistant Smith visited Mr. Ward in New York and secured much useful information as to the best method of exchanging !->ignals over the cable. Based on this information, an apparatus for automatically recording signals over the cable was devised and two sets were constructed at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office. Other necessary preparations were made, and Assistaut Smith proceeded to San Francisco, where he arrived on Mar~h r6, and was joined by Assistant Morse. The preparations for work were completed at this end of the line by connecting the astronomic observ116

atory with the cable office over a wire belonging to the Signal Corps, U. S. Army. This connection was made by direction of Lieut. Col. James Allen, Signal Corps, U. S. Army, who kindly placed the line at the disposal of the observers. The Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Company generously put' telephones in the cable office and the observatory for the use of the party free of expense. Observations for personal equation were made by Messrs. Smith and Morse, but only two nights' work could be obtained before April 2, \\·hen Assistant Smith sailed for Honolulu. He arrived on the 8th and made an examination of. the ground before selecting the location of the astronomic station, which was placed in the grounds of the United States naval station, by the permission of the acting commandant, Lieut. Commander Hugh Rodman, U. S. Navy, who facilitated the work in every way in his power. The location of the observatory of the Territorial survey was unsuitable for the purpose in hand, and all other stations at which observations had previously been made were unavailable. The observatory was connected with the telephone system and all other preparations were completed before April 14, but unfavorable weather prevented observations until April 20. On the 29th the necessary observations had been obtained and the observers were ready to exchange stations. Assistant Morse left San Francisco on May 2 and reached Honolulu on the 8th, but it was necessary for Assistant Smith to wait until the 13th for a steamer to San Francisco. During this time the observers succeeded in obtaining observations to determine their personal equation on one night, observations being prevented on other nights by unfavorable weather. Assistant Smith reached San Francisco on May 19, but unfavorable weather prevented observations until June 2. On June 13 the necessary observations were completed and preparations were made to determine the difference in longitude between Honolulu and Guam and between Guam and Manila, P. I., which would soon be possible as the result of the completion of the cable. Assistant Smith sailed for Guam, via Honolulu, on June 2r. He reached Honolulu on June 27, and at night the observers made observations for personal equation. Assistant Smith was det~ined at Honolulu until June 30, but no other observations were possible on account of unfavorable weather. The following is quoted from Assistant Smith's report:
I wish especially to mention the courtesy we have received from the cable officers in Xew York, 8an Francisco, and Honolulu, who have advanced the work in every way in their power. I also wish to state that with the apparatus for the automatic recording of cable signals we can now determine longitudes over cables with as great accuracy as over land lines and with almost as great facility.

MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

The magnetic observatory at Honolulu, Hawaii, was assigned to the charge of William Weinrich, jr., Magnetic Observer, on July 1, and continued under his direction until the close of the fiscal year. Differential observations were recorded on every day in the year, and only a very small per cent of magnetograph records were lost. Absolute observations were made every Monday during the year except on one day when the suspension fiber in the magnetometer broke several times and the observations were made on the following day. Special observations were made in accordance with the plan adopted for international cooperation during the absence of tht! polar expeditions. The instrumental outfit \Vas the same as during the previous year, except that a

The important work of surveying the coasts of the Philippine Islands was continued under the direction of Assistant G. R. Putnam, who remained in charge of the suboffice at Manila, representing the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in all matters of detail requiring imn1ediate decision. In performing this duty he adopted plans for the field operations, issued instructions for field work, compiled all data secured, and prepared and published charts of the waters surveyed. Notices to Mariners and Sailing Directions were prepared and published. He was aided in this work by such advice and instructions issued from Washington as became necessary and the conditions surrounding the work and the necessities of the case required. The work continued under the plan of cooperatiou between the Philippine Commission and the Coast and Geodetic Survey adopted in 1901 and stated in the Annual Report for 1902. Field parties were at work almost continuously during the fiscal year under the following chiefs of parties: J. E.

Mr. Dow also went to the field for the purpose of collecting information, in September to Iloilo and in October to twenty-five Philippine ports and to Sandaken, Borneo. He also made five voyages, as follows: To San Bernardino Strait, January 6-13; around .!lfindoro, January 28-February 8; to Paragua, March 6-29 and May 5-15; and to northern Luzon, June 26-30. I The following pamphlets of Sailing Directions were published during the year: Section I. North and west coast of Luzon. Section II. Southwest and south coast of Luzon and adjacent islands. Section III. Coasts of Panay, Negros, Cebu, and adjacent islands. Section IV. Coasts of Samar and Leyte and east coast of Luzon. Section V. Coasts of Jlfindanao and adjacent islands. Sections VI and VII were prepared and sent to the printer. The seven sections cover the Philippine Archipelago. E. R. Frisby, chief Computer, was engaged in the examination of records from the field, in making computations necessary for the construction of charts, and the preparation of the data to be retained in Manila when the original records are forwarded to Washington. Mr. F. F. Pangan, junior Computer, assisted in this work after October, and also took care of the self-registering tide gauge at Manila. P. B. Castles, chief Draftsman, has continued in charge of the preparation of charts. The force of junior draftsmen (Filipinos) numbered 8 in January, and was increased to 10 before the close of the fiscal year. These men are efficient, painstaking, and industrious, and are interested in their work. Fourteen charts were published in Manila by lithography during the year, as follows:

On June 30, 1903, the force at the Manila suboffice consisted of 17 persons, as follows: Assistant in charge, 1 chief computer, 1 nautical expert, 1 chief draftsman, I clerk, 10 junior draftsmen, I junior computer, and .1 messenger. Various members of the field force were on duty at the suboffice for short intervals. The steamer Researcli was laid up from April 10 to June 22 having a new boiler installed, the machinery overhauled, and repairs made. The Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Patl!ftnder, with Assistant Gilbert in command, reporting direct to Washington, continued at work until April 9, when she sailed for Hongkong to have repairs made. Assistant Gilbert completed very important work off the south coast of Samar and the southwest coast of Leyte, and details of this work are given under his name. All possible assistance was given to this vessel. At the request of the Director of the Philippine Census assist~nce was given to his office, and a list of the islands in the Archipelago, showing the area of each, was prepared for his use. Those whom the work affects are becoming more interested in the Survey, and much information was sent to the suboffice by the Engineer Officers of t11e Army, the officers of the Division of Military Information, the Bureau of Coast Guard and Transportation· (including Light-House Service), Census Office, Customs Service, Army Transp0rt Service, Masters of merchant steamers, and others. Information was supplied by the suboffice in response to numerous official and private requests.

Astronomic observations: I azimuth established. Base measurement: I base line measured. Hydrography: 425 square miles area covered. 709 miles lines sounded. 4 171 soundings made. Triangulation: 19 stations occupied. 70 geographic positions dctennined.

The triangulation in the vicinity of Manila Bay was assigned to Assistant Bowie and the work in the field began on February 3. A base line was located and measured on the beach south of Manila and from this the triangulation was extended across and down the bay, including the islands at the entrance. All prominent objects, such as church spires, mountain peaks, etc., were observed upon from two or more stations. Vertical angles were measured on the mountain peaks to determine their ele¥ation. Observations to determine an azimuth were made at the northern end of the base line. Except when working in the immediate vicinity of Manila a chartered steam launch was used and the party lived on board. The work was completed on April 13. Prepa-

SUMMARY OF RF.SULTS.

Astronomic observations: 1 azimuth established. Base measurement: 1 base line measured. Hydrography: 482 square miles area covered. 1 526 miles lines sounded. 39 321 soundings made. 4 tide stations established. 6 hyclrographic sheets completed. Topography: 19 miles shore ljne surveyed. 1 topographic sheet completecl. Triangulation: 15 stations occupied. 50 geographic positions detenninecl.

The survey of the entrance to Cagayan River at Aparri, northern Luzon, was in progress on July 1 by a party under charge of Assistant Denson. The work continued until August 25, when it was completed, after much delay resulting from unfavorable weather conditions and from sickness in the party. On November 1 the hydrography of L~ngayen Gulf was taken up by Assistant Denson and was in progress at the close of the fiscal year. The party lived on shore in tents, or houses when available, and the work was done with a steam launch. During December, January, and February the prevailing winds in Lingayen Gulf are from the northeast, and as the gulf opens to the north, there were many days during this period when work was prevented in the open gulf. Unfavorable weather conditions prevailed from November to March, but much progress was made by taking advantage of the shelter afforded by the numerous islands along the west coast where work was done when it would not have been practicable to work elsewhere. After the middle of March the weather was favorable for the hydrog:aphic work except on a few days when a strong northerly wind prevailed and heavy seas rolled into the gulf.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS.

Astronomic observations: 3 azimuths established. Base measurement: 2 base lines measured. Hydrography: 729 miles lines sounded. 21 021 soundings made. 4 tide stations established. 8 current stations occupied. Magnetic observations: 2 stations occupied. Topography: 50 square miles area covered. 93 miles shore line surveyed. Triangulation: 132 square miles area covered. 37 stations occupied.

Surveys in various localities in the Philippine Islands were assigned to Assistant Derickson, commanding the steamer Research, furnished by the Philippine Commission for use in the work. The work of the party, stated in the order of execution, may be briefly summarized as follows: Triangulation was extended on the shores of Albay Gulf and south end of Tabaco Bay. A topographic survey was made of a portion of the shore line of Sula Eass and the south shore of Albay Gulf. Hydrographic work was done in Sula Pass and Albay Gulf, including tide and current observations. The magnetic declination was determined on the shore of Albay Gulf. Between November 20 and February 5 a survey was made of Puerto Galera, including base measurement, triangulation, azimuth observations, topography, and hydrography (including tide observations). The triangulation of this survey was connected with tpe church spire at Batangas, Luzon, and the flagstaff at Calapan, Jl1indo;o, two stations whose latitude and longitude had been determined. The topography was extended along the south coast of the promontory and around Varadero Bay. The inshore hydrography of Puerto Galera and around Point Escarceo and Varadero Bay was done with the whaleboat and alco-vapor launch under charge of Messrs. Grayson and Elliott. The offshore hydrograpllfY was clone

The northeast monsoon is drawn down by the high range of mountains to the westward and sweeps the promontory with great violence. On February 12 the survey of Mangarin Bay and Ilin Pass, J/findoro, was taken up and included base measurement, azimuth observations, magnetic observations, triangulation, topography, and hydrography (including tide observations with a self-registering

Heavy wind again delayed the work, which was, not completed until April 7, when field work closed and the Researclt proceeded to Manila for repairs. On June 21 the ship sailed 'from Manila to take up the survey of Danao River entrance, Negros. The work began on June 23. A self-registering tide gauge was established, and the work was in progress on June 30.

SUMMARY OF RRSULTS.

Astronomic observations: 1 azimuth established. Base measurement: 2 base.lines measured. Topography: 16o square miles area covered. 8o miles shore line surveyed. 243 miles shore line lagoons and rivers surveyed. 8o miles roads surveyed. 50 miles streets surveyed. 6 topographic sheets completed. Triangulation: 54 stations occupied. 141 geographic positions determined.

The extension of the triangulation and topography along the west coast of Luzon, from Vigan to San Fernando de Union, to connect the astronomic stations at those two places was assigned to Assistant Fairfield. The necessary preparations were made at Manila, and on January 28 he sailed for Vigan and reached that place on the 30th. A party was organized, the necessary outfit was secured, and on February 4 the field work began. It was found impracticable to use ponies as pack animals, and the ordinary bamboo "bull cart" of the country, drawn by a bull, was substituted. Two of these were used during the season, one for the triangulation party and one for the topographic party, and others were hired whenever necessary. A base line was measured at Vigan, and azimuth observations were made at the longitude station. From the base line the triangulation was extended to the south ·by Assistant Fairfield, and Aid Dibrell followed with the topographic work. The difficulties of transportation and the necessity of using native laborers, who were slow, and most of whom understood only their· own dialect, prevented rapid progress. The party lived in native buildings in the pueblos and barrios along the coast, and procured supplies from the army and civil commissaries. The triangulation covers a strip of the country adjacent to the beach from 2 to 4 miles wide, extending from the beach to the foothills, which are from 400 to r 300 feet in elevation, and are covered with small trees and a dense growth of underbrush. Beyond the foothills the mountains are high, abrupt,. and difficult to ascend .. At Candon three old triangulation points were recovered and used in the work, these being the longitude station and the ends of the base line measured at that place. At San Fernando de Union six old triangulation stations were recovered and used. At San Fernando a base line was measured and azimuth observations were made. Mr. Dibrell rendered valuable assistance in the triangulation and did all the topographic work, which covered the coast line, the rivers, lagoons, creeks, ponds, and roads along the coast, including pueblos and barrios, and covering the country within an average width of 2 ~ miles from the coast line.

The weather was favorable and there was little delay on this account. On two days observations were prevented during three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon by flights of locust, which filled the air to such an extent that objects 300 meters distant could not be seen. In his report Assistant Fairfield expresses his appreciation of the' rapidity and thoroughness with which Mr. Dibrell performed the duties assigned to him and of the interest and efficiency shown by the recorder, Mr. Weigle.

The extension of the triangulation along the coast north of Vigan, Luzon, was assigned to Assistant Flynn. He reached Vigan on January 30 and beg:an field work iinmediately. As the triangulation progressed a topographic survey was made of the shore line and of a narrow strip of land in its immediate vicinity. The work was in progress at the close of the fiscal year and at that time had reached Bangui, northeast of Cape Bojeador. No detailed report of this work had been received when this Report went to press, and consequently no statistics are given. ASTRONO:llIC OBSERVATIONS. BASE MEASUREMENT. HYDROGRAPHY.

The survey was completed on August 9 as far north ~.J Bingay Point, at the entrance to Albay Gulf, and south to a junction with the Spanish surveys. After consulting with Assistant Derickson, commanding the Rcscarcli, the survey of the southern shore of Albay Gulf was taken up by both vessels and completed on August 15. The Patlt.fiudcr then proceeded to Matnog, and a survey of that port was made. On August 21 the vessel proceeded to Cebu for coal and supplies. Cholera still prevailed and· a strict quarantine was established on board the ship, which caused delay. The self-registering tide gauge at Cebu had become disabled, and it was dismounted and taken on board. Coal and provisions were on board by September 1, and the ship sailed that day, returning to Albay Gulf. On September 3 one of the whaleboats was wrecked in an attempt to land on the rocky shore of Rapurapu Island. The topography

On the 26th the vessel proceeded to Manila ancl remained there until November 13, when she proceeded to Tacloban, Leyte Island. A self-registering tide gauge was established and two triangulation stations of the harbor survey were recovered and the line between them used as a base from which to extend the triangulation around San Pedro Bay. The survey of this bay was completed and a survey of a small a ea at the south entrance to San Juanico Strait was also made. Some hydrographic work was also done in Cancabato Bay. On December 31 the triangulation under charge of Assistant Yates covered the work in San Bernardino Strait, a portion of Albay Gulf, San Pedro Bay, and a small

The topography covered all the coast of Luzon Island from Matnog Bay to a junction with the work previously completed in Albay Gulf; all of Poliqui Bay; the south coasts of Cacraray and Butan islands; all the shore of Rapurapu Island, except that portion along Rapurapu Pass; all of the shores of Samar and Leyte islands bordering on San Pedro Bay, and a few miles of the shore line at the entrance of San Juanico Strait. After January r the survey was extended along the coast of Samar Island east of Point Capines. The hydrography with the launch had been under charge of Watch Officer Fitzgerald, but his health had becoi;ne seriously impaired, and this work was assigned to Deck Officer Westdahl. Assistant Yates continued in charge of the triangulation and base measurement, and the commanding officer personally executed the topography and the hydrography with the ship.

work on account of the number of mangoe svvamps encountered, and it was necessary to do a great deal of the work while ·tanding in the water. As a result of the numerous bays, bends, and small islands, the distance of 30 miles between Point Capines and Point Sungi includes 150 miles of shore line. The hydrography, on account of the numerous reefs, was nearly all done from the launches, and much of it was done in a rough sea. Observations for azimuth were made at Raton Island by Assistant Yates, who also made observations with the compass declinometer at several stations. A self-registering tide gauge was maintained at Tacloban from November 18 to March 9, and staff gauges were established at Binabasian and Raton islands, and the hydrographic work in the vicinity was based on the plane of reference deduced from observations at these places. The work proceeded without interruption, except on two occasions, when brief visits were made to Tacloban

for coal and provisions. Heavy seas breaking against the cliffs prevented the survey of the outside coast of Calicoan Island. The work undertaken by the party was completed on March 7 and the vessel returned to Tacloban. The self-registering tide gauge was dismounted, and on the 9th the vessel proceeded to Cebu for coal and provisions, and while there. established the self-registering tide gauge, .and on the 13th proceeded to make a hydrographic examination of some reefs and shoals in Cebu Strait and a survey on the west coast of Leyte Island. The vessel was anchored close to Canagoa Island, a tide staff was established, and tide observations were made every day and during three nights. A base line was measured on Leyte Island, from which the triangulation was extended in both directions, and reached a point within 6 miles of Maasin. Observations for azimuth and magnetic observations were also made on Canagoa Island. The topographic survey was extended from Iilegos to the astronomic station at Maasin. The hydrographic work was extended from Iilegos to a point within 3 miles of Maasin. A careful search for Carmen Shoal failed to develop any indications of it in the position where it had been reported. Careful search was also made for a reef reported near Metalom, but it could not be found. The field work closed on March 28, and on that I date the vessel started to ~Ianila, via Onnoc, and reached that port on April 1. The following is quoted from Assistant Gilbert's report:
I have only praise for all the officers associated with me during- the past year. Mr. Yates has attended to the triangulation, measurecl two base lines, occupied two azimuth stations, taken observations with the compass declinometer, ancl assisted in the hyclrography. \Vith some assistance he has made all field computations ancl inkecl ancl duplicatecl his records. Mr. Baird, except when assisting in the base measurement and in the hyclrographic work on a few occasioBs when it was done with the ship, has been constantly engaged in plotting the hydrographic sheets. Mr. Fitzgerald, \Vatch Officer ancl Executive Officer, had the direction of the hydrographic work with the launches previous to January I, when the condition of his health became alarming and he was excused from field work on the advice of the surgeon. He continued to attend to all other duties until the micldle of April, when he was relieved from all cluty, mHl left for the United States on April 25. :\Ir. Fitzgeralcl had been a most satisfactory officer nrnl 1 wa~ very sorry to part with him. Mr. Daniels has proved to be an efficient and valuable officer. Since the first of the year he has been taking one angle and recording in the starboard launch, has generally had charge of the sounding machine when sounding with the ship, and has taken current observations when practicable. Chief Engineer Goldsborough has kept everything in his cl.epartmeut in excellent condition, with the result that we have required but few repairs. Dr. Hawkes has been most commendably attentive to his duties. He has also responded most cheerfully to every call for other service, whether to take sextant angles or to assist in the office work. I believe him to be thoroughly con:petent, ancl that he stuclies aml he keeps up to elate in his profession. :\Ir. Deichman, besides carefully and efficiently attending to his especial duties, has reconled and taken one angle in launch and ship hyclrography a large portion of the time, ancl is very efficient in this work. l\1r. \Vestdahl has heen in charge of the launch hydrography since the 1st of January and always assisted :\lr. Fitzgerald before that time. Since Mr. Fitzgeralcl was relievecl about the miclclle of April he has been acting executive ofiieer of the l"at!ifi11dcr, and has performed the duties of that important office in a most intelligent and satisfactory manner.

Astronomic observations: 12 azimuths established 14 latitudes determined. 14 longitudes determined. Magnetic observations: ·s stations occupied.

The determination of astronomic base position~ was assigned to Assistant McGrath and Aids Mitchell and Hill. This work was in progress on July r, with these officers in charge of cooperating parties. The longitude of the following places was determined during the fiscal year:
Batangas, Luzon; base station Romblon. Boac, JJfari11duq11e; base station Romblon. Cagayan, llfi11da11ao; base station Dumaguete. Calapan, Mindoro; base station Romblon.

Tacloban, Leyte; base station Ormoc. Vallehennosa, Negros; base station Dumaguete.

On July 1 Assist.ant McGrath was at Pasacao,·Luzon, determining the longitude of this station. The place is situated at the mouth of a narrow gorge, which extends inland about north and south, and the southerly monsoon drew into this funnel-shaped opening with terrific force during July and August and unfavorable wt:ather was almost continuous. The observations to determine t11e longitude were completed on August 3, and after waiting until September 1 without being able to make any observations to determine the latitude the station was abandoned, and the observer sailed for Masbate September 2 on the quartermaster's launch Bangor, through the courtesy of Maj. Arthur Williams, Twenty-sixth Infantry, U.S. Army. He arrived at Masbate on September 3 and remained there until October 18. During this period observations for personal equation between Messrs. McGrath and Hill were made and signals were exchanged with Calbayoc and Carigara. After serious delay, on account of unfavorable weather, the necessary exchanges of signals with the two stations named were completed on October 14 and the observer proceeded to Manila on October i8. Assistant McGrath arrived at Dumaguete on November 12 and was tendered the hospitality of the army officers' quarters and mess. His report expressed his appreciation of the kindness extended to him by Captain Paine, U. S. Army, and the officers under his command, and Reverend Mr. Hibbard, his wife, and Doctor Langheim, officials of Silliman's Institute, a local educational insti-

tution. The work was delayed by unfavorable weather and by a break in the cable, and tht exchanges of longitude signals with Iligan were not completed until December 5. After more delay on account of unsatisfactory conditions on the cable lines the necessary exchanges of time signals with Cagayan and Vallehermosa were made on December 30. The weather in January was very unfavorable, and the exchanges of time signals with Loon were not completed until January 29. On February 28 Assistant McGrath reached Romblon and determined the latitude and longitude, .established an azimuth, and made magnetic observations. 'He remained at Romblon until May 21, and during this period the necessary time signals were exchanged with Calapan, Batangas, and Boac. On June 16 he reached Ormoc and remained there until the close of the fiscal year. The necessary exchanges of time signals were completed on June 27. From July~ to August 12, Aid Mitchell was at Legaspi, Luzon, occupying this base station and exchanging time signals ·with the observers at Pasacao and Sorsogon. He then occupied the following stations and exchanged the necessary time signals with other observers between the dates specified and with the base stations named in the list of stations determined:
Catbalogan, August 13 to September 18. Calbayoc, September 18 to October 19. Tacloban, October 21 to November 2. (Reoccupied to close a loop.) · Iligan, November 6 to December 9. Vallehermosa, December 20 to January 14.

An azimuth was established at Catbalogan and Calbayoc and latitude and magnetic observations were made at Catbalogan, Calbayoc, Iligan, and Vallehermosa. Aid Mitchell closed field work in the Philippine Islands on January 14. Aid Hill reached Sorsogon on July II, and after that date occupied the following stations and made the necessary exchanges of time signals, between the dates stated, with the base stations named in the list of longitudes determined:
Sorsogon·, July I I to August 3. Masbate (base station), August 15 to September 2. Carigara, September 24 to October 27. (Used as a base station October 14 to 27). Cagayan, December 15 to January 3. Loon, January JO to February 3. Masbate (base station), March 2 to March 23. Calapan, March 25 to April 7. Batangas, April 9 to April 24. Boac, May 9 to May 18. Surigao, June 13 to June 29.

Latitude and azimuth observations were also made at Sorsogon, Carigara, Cagayan, Loon, Calapan, Batangas, Boac, and Surigao. Magnetic observations were made at Calapan, Batangas, Boac, and Surigao. Observations to determine the personal equation between Messrs. Hill and Mitchell were made at Iligan, November 7 to 17. The unfavorable weather conditions and the absence of direct and rapid transportation between the stations caused serious delay at all the stations.

The survey of Port Gubat, Luzon, was in progress on July I, under charge of Aid :\-Iorford. The work was almost completed during the previous fiscal year, and it only remained to run a few miles of sounding lines and to reoccupy four triangulation stations to connect the work with the San Bernardino Lighthouse, a station in the triangulation of· San Bernardino Strait. Unfavorable weather prevented observations to establish an azimuth. On July 14 the party proceeded to Sorsogon to make a survey at that place. It was difficult to secure laborers and boats, and the weather was so unfavorable that very little progress was made in July. Considerable progress was made in August, and the work was continued until August 30, on which date l\Ir. John Bach, recorder, who had been assisting in the work, was placed in immediate charge of the party, and Mr. .Morford proceeded to :Manila. ·l\fr.

Unfortunately, Mr. W. E. Gordon, Recorder, died, as the result of an attack of cholera, on )fovember Ir, 1902, three days after the work began. It was impracticable to <lo any hyclrograpltic work, as the necessary assistance could not be obtained. Field work closed at Danao on December 9, and ::VIr. Morford returned to ::Vfanila.

R. F. Sop1;R 1 11fa_i:11etic Obsen·cr.

The duty of inaugurating magnetic observations at sea on board the \'essels of the Coast and Geodetic Survey was assigned to Assistant L. A. Bauer. He made the necessary preparations for this work and to establish a magnetic observatory in Porto Rico, and on January I9 reported on board the steamer Blake, Assistant Faris, commanding, with his assistant, R. F. Soper, and ·the necessary outfit for the work. Assistant Faris was instructed to transport the party and outfit en route to Porto Rico, and to afford i\ssistant Bauer all necessary assistance in carrying out the work assigned to him. The Blake sailed from Baltimore on January 21, and arrived at San Juan, P. R., on the 27th, and at Fajardo Roads on the 30th. The ves.-;el was swung three times, in order to obtain the necessary deviation corrections due to the ship's magnetism, in Chesapeake Bay on January 2I, at sea on January 24, and in Fajardo Roads on January 30. While the Blal.:c was at anchor in Fajardo Harbor, the necessary magnetic observations on land were made on Obispo Cayo on January 3 I, and on February I the magnetic declination was determined on the main island at Cueva, on the west side of the harbor. The vessel proceeded to Port Mulas, Vieques Island, on February 1, and landed the party and outfit for the magnetic observatory at Isabel Segtmda. Hon. \V. H. Hunt, governor of Porto Rico, courteously assigned to the Survey the quarters necessary for the establishment of the magnetic observatory on the ground floor of Fort Isabel, on Vieqttes Isla1id. The work was facilitated by the commander of the insular police, the mayor of the town, and by the corporal in charge of the fort, and b); others who were able to render assistance. During the period February 2-18, the quarters were adapted for observatory purposes, the instruments were installed, the necessary adjustments were made, the instruments were compared, and the constants were determined. Under the direction of Assistant Bauer, the observatory was placed in charge of Mr. R. F. Soper on February 19, and from that date to June 30 a continuous record was obtained with the self-registering instruments. ObserYations for absolute yalues were made once a week, and the regular international term tlay observations were made on the. 1st and 15th of each month. Special observations were also made in cooperation with the expeditions sent out by foreign governments to the polar regions. Assistant Bauer left Vieques Island on February 19 and made magnetic observations at Aibonita, Csguas, and :'.1.fayaguez for the purpose of investigating the conditions on the main island with the view of determining the final site for the magnetic observatory. On February 25 he left San Juan and proceeded to do some special work outside the United States.

The Blake reached San Juan on January 27, and sailed for Fajardo Roads on the 30th·, to complete the magnetic observations by swinging ship at that place. Assistant Bauer's party and outfit were landed at Port Mulas on February 2. On the same day hydrographic signals were erected and a self-registering tide gauge was established at Port Mulas. A continuous tide record was obtained at this station from February 3 to May 25. Simultaneous staff readings of the tide were made at this station and at Target Bay on several days during the season, but no material change was noted in the time and range of the tide at the two stations. Unfavorable weather retarded the progress of the work during the earl,ier part of the season, when the weather was frequently too rough to permit sounding. The shoals in Port Mulas.Harborwere resurveyed and the 18-foot spot immediately to the southward of Corona Reef was examined. The area covered by the season's work included all the unsurveyed portion of Vieques Sound to Grampus Shoal, Barilles, and Hftrmanos Passage on the east, and to the north to a line along the reefs and islands forming the north side of the sound. A number of special surveys of verification were made in the vicinity of Target Bay at the entrance to Great Harbor; on Blake and Hodgkins shoals; at Point Arenas bell buoy; at Mosquito Reef, and at Port Mulas. Especial care was taken in the examination of Blake and Hodgkins shoals. In this work two leads were used as usual and the channel sweep was also used. The sounding lines were run very close together with.t~p:-ei..the lowest speed which the necessity of controlling the ship permitted. The passage between Culebra Island and Southwest Cay was also carefully examined with the channel sweep. Magnetic observations were made in several places about Vieques Sound during the season and the three magnetic elements were determined at each station occupied. On May 24 magnetic observations were made at a shore station and on the ship on the 25th for compass errors. The hydrographic work closed on May 25, and the ship sailed from San Juan for Old Point Co1nfort, Va., on the 30th, and arrived at that place on June 5. On the trip from San Juan to Norfolk complete sets of magnetic observations were made every day, and the ship was swung at sea about midway between San Juan, P. R,., and Cape Henry, Virginia. The result of the work was the detennination of the magnetic declination in nineteen different places bet,veen the points named above. The compass observations were made by Watch Officers Furman and Jenkins, who performed the work with much care and interest. In his report, Assistant Faris expresses his hearty appreciation of the manner in which the officers under his command cooperated with him in executing the work assigned to the party, and makes special mention of the kindness and co~rtesy extended to him by Capt. Andrew Dunlap, U. S. Navy, commandant of the San Juan naval station.

The steam launch RudJ' was taken from storage and put in order, and the party started in the launch to Parguera on February 2, reaching there next day after being delayed all night at Cape Roja by rough weather. Mr. Sparrow joined the party at Parguera with the outfit brought from Ponce, and a camp was established. Old triangulation stations \vere recovered, and from these additional hydrographic stations were determined when necessary. A tide staff was established and observations began at once. Soundings were made February 12 to March 6, except during one week, when the engineer was disabled as the result of accidental injury received in line of duty. On March 6 the boiler gave out and was repaired, but after two days' use it failed again, on the 12th, and an examination showed that a large portion of the tubes had burned out. New tubes were received from. New York 011 April 16, but proper tools were lacking, and the launch was not ready for use until April 25. From that date until l\Iay 23, when the field work closed, the launch was in use continuously and did

The hydrography from the limit of the work previously completed by Assistant Flower off the entrance to Guanica Harbor to the western end of Margarita Reef was well developed out to the 10-fathom curve, except over a 5-fathom patch 4 miles south of the town of Parguera, over which lines of soundings were run 200 meters apart in one direction, but no cross lines were run, because comparath·ely calm weather was needed for such work in a small boat, and there was not enough of such weather available. North and south lines were nm from Margarita Reef 1 mile to the westward, but these lines had no lines run across them.

Hyclrography: 145 Rquare miles area cm·~red. 895 miles sounded. 18 924 soundings made. 3 hydrographic sheets completed.

Hydrographic work on the west coast of Porto Rico was assigned to Assistant \Velker, commanding the steamer Bache, and he sailed from New York on January I 3. He reached San Juan on January 20, took on coal and supplies, and proceeded to Mayaguez 011 January 26. The field work began immediately, and hydrographic signals were erected and the positions determined whenever necessary. Work was continued until March 20, on which date the hydrography was completed. It reaches from Mayaguez Harbor to Point Jiguero and extends about 10 nautical miles offshore. Tourmaline Reef was developed, and also the region about a spot marked as possibly dangerous to the northwestward of the reef. The region was thoroughly sounded and dragged and no dangerous rock was found, but there is an extensin~ bank at this point which rises out of deep water to a depth of 13 fathoms, the least depth deyeloped. There were no indications of shoals in the immediate dcinity of the spots marked ''Guadeloupe Bank'' and '' Peregrina Reef,'' though shoals were found within 1 or 2 miles of these places. Special examinations were also made whenever required. The sounding lines were run at Yarying distances apart, in accordance with any n~cessity

indicated by the soundings. These distances varied from 25 meters for close work to I 600 meters in deep water ( roo to 400 fathoms). The shoals iI1 this region rise very abruptly, and great care should be exercised in navigating these waters. It is not unusual to have the depth change suddenly from 100 to 5 fathoms. During the season the weather was almost continuously fair, but on account of the strong trade winds which prevailed there were very few days available for close developNo. 49·

The field work closed on March 20, and on the 23d the steamer proceeded to San Juan. Assistant Welker in his report expresses his appreciation of the faithful and intelligent manner in which the officers and men under his command performed their duties, and states that much of the success of the season's work was due to their efforts.

MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. L.A. BAUER.

Advantage was taken by Assistant Bauer of his presence on duty in Porto Rico to return by way of San Domingo and Cuba, to secure magnetic observations in those countries. He determined the elements of terrestrial magnetism in San Domingo at San Pedro de Macoris and at San Domingo City, and in Cuba at Baracoa, Gibara, Habana (two stations), and Santiago de Cuba. His report expresses his appreciation· of the courtesy extended to him by Father Gangoiti, who did all in his power to facilitate the work.
SURVEY OF LOUISIANA OYSTER BEDS.

J. B.

BAYLOR.

In response to a request for the survey of the natural oyster beds and reefs in the State of Louisiana, made by the United States Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries, Assistant Baylor was assigned to execute the necessary work in the field in cooperation with the Louisiana Oyster Commission, recently created by the State legislature. All available material bearing on the work was collected at the Office, and on February 15 Assistant Baylor proceeded to New Orleans for consultation with the State Commission. He made an examination of the region to be surveyed and returned to Washington on March 2. On March 24 he went to Louisiana to 'begin the field work of the survey. A small vessel and steam launch was provided by the Commission, and the necessary men and outfit were provided by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Extensive changes have been made along the coast of Louisiana by wind and water since the former survey, and most of the old triangulation points have been washed away. It was necessary to use the line between Ship Island Lighthouse and Biloxi Island Lighthouse as a base from which to extend the triangulation required in the work in hanc;l. The new positions of Cat Island Lighthouse, Murrell Shell Bank Lighthouse, Lake Borgne Lighthouse, and St. Joseph beacon were determined, changes in the position of these lights having been made when they were rebuilt. Eight new triangulation stations were established and securely marked along the shores of Mississippi Sound and in the Louisiana marshes. The positions cf these points were determined and the work progressed until June 12, when it was suspended for the summer.

The survey covers the portion lying between Twelfth and Fourteenth streets and between B street and a line 500 feet to the north. This space was divided into squares by a system of lines 50 feet apart, and the various buildings, etc., within the area were located from fixed points on these lines. The elevation of a number of points within the area was determined with a spirit level. After completing the field work a report and a topographic sketch were prepared and forwarded to the Supervising Architect.
RESURVBY OF MASON AND DIXON'S LINE.

HODGKINS.

The resurvey of Mason and Dixon's Line, the boundary line between the States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, was in progress on July I under the direction of Assistant Hodgkins who had been detailed for this duty in response to a request from the joint commission established by the States named for an officer of the Survey to direct the work which is done at the expense of .the States. The work during July and August included the survey of the boundary strip from the summit of North Mountain to Sideling Hill Creek, a distance of about nineteen miles, and the monuments were set as far west as the summit of Ragged Mountain. The plan of placing monuments of cut stone at regular intervals of r mile was abandoned by Mason and Dixon at the eastern foot of Sideling Hill, 132 miles west of the northeastern corner of l\faryland, on account of the impossibility of taking wagons across the mountains without building roads. A considerable number of stone monuments which had been transported to the locality, now Washington County, Md., were also abandoned. These stones were utilized by many of the farmers as door steps and window sills, and some of them were broken in pieces for other purposes. A number of them, still in fair condition, were secured and used as originally intended. Mounds of earth or stone, placed at irregular inten·als and generally upon the summits of the high transverse ridges, were the only marks used on the line from the summit of Sideling Hill westward to the end. \Vhenever the evidence established the authentic character of a mound a monument was placed at its center and the mound was restored. As these mounds were placed at intervals of 2 to 5 miles, it was necessary to establish additional monuments between them, and these new monuments were located with reference to the adjacent mounds on each side, on a line between them, with the curvature prescribed by Mason and Dixon. The new monuments were placed at the most suitable points without any attempt to make the inten·als between them exactly equal, though these intervals were made as nearly equal to r mile as the topography and other conditions permitted. In No,iember and December the work was greatly delayed by uiJfavorable weather conditions and all work was suspended from December 20 to 31. On January 1 the party resumed work at Hagerstown, Md., and preparations were made to complete the work from the Blue Ridge to North Mountain, across the Cumberland Valley. The weather was unusually severe during January and February and considerable delay resulted. The work progressed as rapidly as the weather conditions permitted until February 18, when Assistant Hodgkins was ordered to other special duty and the work was again suspended until early in March, when it was resumed by Messrs. R. H. Blain, transitman, and E. R. ::\fortin, foreman, working under instruc-

The work was continued until the end of :i\fay, when operations were suspended until the end of June. Assistant Hodgkins '\Vas absent on duty connected with marking the Virginia and Tennessee boundary July 13 to August 31, and after February 18 on special duty, except for a short time, April 27 to May 4.

\V. C. HODGKINS. J. B. BAYLOR.

The work of remarking the Virginia and Tennessee boundary, under an order of the United States Supreme Court, was in active progress at the close of the previous fiscal year, as stated in the Report for that year. Assistants Hodgkins and Baylor continued the work as members of the Commission created by the court for that purpose and good progress was made until September 16 when the field work of the Commission was completed. The work proceeded from Clinch River westward to Cumberland Mountain, on the sharp summit of which the monument marking the extreme western end of the line was placed iu position in the latter part of August, and on Monday, August 25, the working party was disbanded and Assistant Hodgkins started to \Vashington. Assistant Baylor remained in the field until September 16, engaged in placing monuments on the line and in inspecting monuments already in position. Cut-stone monuments weighing over 500 pounds and lettered '' T V '' were placed on the line on all public roads and at many other important points along the entire length of the line. Ninety-nine of these monuments were used in addition to the distinctive marks cut on numerous trees adjacent to the line throughout its length. The boundary line was referred to the following triangulation stations, previously established by the Coast and Geodetic Survey: "Damacus," on Holston l\Iountain; "Dunn," vicinity of Bristol; "Cloud,'' on Holston River; "\Vildcat," on Clinch Mountain; "Powell," on Powell Mountain, and '' l\finter.'' It is interesting to note that the Commission was able to find trees marked a century before, which enabled them to reestablish the line beyond question. In many instances the marks were found imbedded several inches inside the body of the tree, with only faint indications of the original marks on the outside bark. The date when the marks were made was verified by the Bureau of Forestry, Department of Agriculture, and the marks were of the greatest importance in fixing the position of the '' Diamond'' line as originally traced upon the ground. After conclusion of the field work the necessary records and maps were prepared and the final report of the Commission was filed in the Supreme Court on January 5, 1903. This report was confirmed by the court on June I, 1903. Assistant Hodgkins was absent from the party in the field July 1 to 12, and August 25 to September 16 engaged upon other duty.

The work of verifying the length of the trial course off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, was in progress at the close of the previous fiscal year under the direction of Assistant Marindin. The necessary range marks had been placed in position by the civil engineers of the Fore River Ship and Engine Company, and it was found to be impracticable to make a direct measurement of the distances between the range lines. A base line was selected and measured, and the length of the trial course was determined by triangulation from this base line. The marks at both ends of the course were shifted to new positions for the purpose of increasing the facility and accuracy of their use. This

to Bridgeport, where he boarded a navy tugboat, and after some delay, caused by thick weather, made an examination of the waters between Stratford Shoal (Middle Ground) and the northern shore of Long Island Sound. It was evident that the position of buoys placed on the course could be determined in clear weather by using the triangulation stations along the northern shore of Long Island, but from an examination of the shore in this vicinity it was also evident that the unfavorable topographic features made it impracticable to establish range lines on that shore. It was necessary to have a number of signals determined on high points from which the trial course could be located, and the Tesla tower, erected for use in wireless telegraph experiments, was used as one of these. It is the most prominent object to be seen from the Sound in this locality. Field Point Lighthouse was also used and four other points were selected. These stations furnished the basis from which the p0sition of the buoys on the trial course were determined by sextant angles measured at the buoys. Three buoys, one at each end and one in the center of the course, were established and their positions determined. 01i account of unfavorable weather conditions and the desire to use the trial course without delay, it was necessary to determine the position of the buoys, marking the center and the east end by observations at night on the lights in this vicinity. The work was completed on March 18.

MARINDIN.

Assistant lVIarinclin continued his service as a member of the Commission and performed such duties during the year as were necessary. On November 6 he left Washington and proceeded to St. Louis, where he attended a meeting of the Commission, which was followed by a low water inspection trip down the river to New Orleans. He returned to the Office on Kovember 19. March 21 to April 3 he was absent attending a meeting of the Commission at St. Louis and on a tour of inspection of the improvements on the river between Cairo, Ill., and the Head of the Passes. A considerable amount of time during the year was devoted to work incident to membership in the Commission whenever other assignments to ~uty permitted.

FREMONT MORSE.

The work of establishing a speed trial course off Potrero Point, San Francisco Bay, California, was assigned to Assistant Morse. This trial course was established to comply with a request from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company to the Secretary of the Navy, and referred by him to the Secretary of the Treasury. This course is located off the shore of the bay opposite the southern section of San Francisco, and extends from a point about half a mile off Potrero Point southeasterly to a point about the same distance off Hunters Point. It is 2 miles long, and the quarter and half mile points of the first mile from the northern encl were indicated hy marks. Three stations of the bay triangulation were recovered and the lines between them were used as bases from which to determine the points on the trial course. The ranges were marked by rows of piles dri\'en in the shallow water of the bay out to the 3-fathom course, as requested by the resident superintendent of the Hollatid Torpedo Boat Company.

A speed trial course in Peconic Bay, off New Suffolk, Long Island, New York, was verified at the request of the Holland Submarine Torpedo Boat Company. This work was assigned to Assistant Nelson, and he left Washington for New Suffolk on November 3. Many of the principal triangulation points in this region could not be recovered and proper transportation was not furnished, consequently the work required much more time than was anticipated. The work of verification was co111°pleted on Novemper 20, and Assistant Nelson returned to the Office on the 22d.

SINCLAIR.

In response to a request from the county authorities of Esmeralda County, Nev., for the determinati~n of a certain portion of the boundary line between that county and the adjoining county of Nye, Assistant Sinclair was instrttcted to proceed to the locality and execute the necessary field work at the expense of Esmeralda County. He left Washington on August I and proceeded to Tonopah, Nev., via San Francisco, Cal., to procure an outfit, and Carson City, Nev., where observations were made to determine personal equation with Mr. C. \V. Friend, who kindly cooperated with him in determining the longitude of Tonopah from the observatory at Carson City. The telephone line from Candelaria was connected i.vith that from Sodaville, and a metallic circuit was thus secured oyer which signals were exchanged between Tonopah and Carson ·City. The latitude of the station was determined by observations made on four nights. A base line was then selected and a scheme of triangulation developed to locate on the ground the intersection of the parallel of 38 ° north latitude with the meridian in longitude 40° 07' west from Washington, which point locates one end of the oblique boundary line between the two counties named, and is about 6 miles southeast of the astronomic station. Lone Mountain station of the transcontinental triangulation was connected with the local triangulation for the purpose of comparing the astronomic position of the astronomic station with its geodetic position. Between September 10 and October 6 a base was measured and observations were made at the IS stations of the triangulation. Lone Mountain station was visited and recovered, but it \vas not occupied for observations, as the trail up the mountain was found to be impossible for pack animals without extensive repairs. The geographic position of the northwest terminus of the boundary at Hot Spring was determined by connecting it through triangulation with Basalt (Pilot) Cone, a peak connected with the transcontinental triangulation. The azimuth of the boundary line was then computed and the line was traced in the vicinity of the town of Tonopah, thus completing the work

SINCLAIR,

Asst"slant.

The necessity of remarking that portion of the boundary line between the United States and Canada lying west of the summit of the Rocky Mountains having become apparent, the Secretary of State of the United States was authorized by Congress to take part in this work, and a Joint Commission was appointed by Great Britain and the United States to have charge of the necessary work in the field. Mr. W. F. King, Chief Astronomer of the Canadian department of the interior, was appointed Commissioner to represent the British Government, and Messrs. 0. H. Tittmann, Superintendent United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, and C. D. Walcott, Director of the United States Geological Survey, were appointed Commissioners to represent the United States. The Commissioners each assigned certain officers of their Bureaus to have charge of the necessary work in the field. Assistant Sinclair was detailed for this purpose from the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and Assistant John Nelson was assigned to duty in his party. Numerous preparations, including the purchase of instruments and outfit, were made before leaving Washington, and on May 27 Assistant Sinclair started with Assistant Nelson to Seattle to complete the outfit and to organize the party. Gateway, Mont., is the nearest railway supply point to the field of work, and at that place horses were purchased and men engaged to complete the party. High water in the Kootenai River flooded the railway and delayed the arrival of men and outfit. As there was no ferry over the Kootenai River near Gateway, it was necessary to carry all the supplies across in a small boat and then transport them by pack train to the westward more than 20 miles over a mountain trail. On June 30 two parties were at work on the line, one on the west side of the Kootenai, opening a line across the summits along the chord joining monuments. Nos. II and 12, 16.5 miles apart, and the other opening the line across the summits along the chord joining monuments Nos. 7 and 8, I3 miles apart (in the Wigwam Valley). More details in regard to this work will be given in the next Annual Report.

----·--·-·------!
The Miscellaneous Section is a part of the immediate office of the Assistant in Charge, and the manifold and arduous duties pertaining to it were performed by Messrs. H. C. Allen and C. W. Jones. The details of the work in this section are given under the heading '' Miscellaneous Section'' in this Appendix. The duties of the other members of the personnel mentioned above were of the usual routine character. The following extracts are taken from the report of the Assistant in Charge:
I have the honor to submit the annual report of the office for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1903, accompanied by the annual reports of the various divisions, namely: Computing Division, Division of Terrestrial Magnetism, Tidal Division, Drawing and Engraving Division, Chart Division, Instrument Division, Library and Archives Division, and Miscellaneous Section .. The Computing Division continued under the charge of Assistant J. F. Hayford, whose report shows a large amount of work accomplished during the year, as follows: 1. The completion for publication of the reduction of the Lake Survey triangulation to the United States Standard Datum. 2. A new adjustment of the precise level net. 3. 'fhe computation of all the triangulation in California south of Point Conception and its reduction to the l:nited States Standard Datum was nearly completed. 4. A new investigation of the form of the geoid in the United States. 5. The computation of the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian. The routine work of the Division has received clue attention, and the demand upon it in regard to geographic positions and for copies of descriptions of stations, although smaller than during the previous year, was quite heavy.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

The Division of Terrestrial Magnetism continued under the charge of Assistant L. A. Bauer, who, as Inspector of Magnetic Work, is also charged with the supervision of the field parties engaged on magnetic work. Much of his time while in the office was necessarily occupie<l with his duties in the latter capacity. The correspondence and routine work and the distribution of magnetic information have. received prompt attention. Among other works accomplished by the Division may be mentioned the discussion of the international magnetic observations made during the solar eclipse of May, 1901, the preliminary discussion of magnetic observations made on the Blake 011 her trip from Baltimore to Porto Rico, and the making of observations to standardize various instruments, as occasion required. The Tidal Division remained under the charge of Mr. J.,. P. Shidy, and his report gives full information as to the work accomplished during the year. Mr. R. A. Harris has been engaged in the study of tidal phenomena and has constructed a cotidal chart for the northern Indian Ocean. Similar work is in progress for other regions, and a preliminary cotidal chart has been completed for the Eastern coast of the United States. The Drawing and Engraving Division continued under the charge of Assista1it \V. \V. Duffield, and his report shows in detail the work accomplished in each of the five sections of the Division, and gives the usual statistical information. I may here mention that a complete and thorough examination of all charts of various scales of the coast of Maine was macle in view of the proposed naval maneuvers on that coast. In the Drawing Section, under the immediate direction of Chief Draftsman E. H. Fowler, a large amount of work has been accomplished during the year. The illustrations for the Superintendent's Annual Report also received due attention. It may be mentioned also that a large amount of work was performed for the Alaska Boundary Tribunal, including the preparation of two atlases and numerous special drawings and maps. In the Printing Section, under the immediate 1lirection of Foreman D. N. Hoover, the usual large amount of work has been accomplished, over 80 oco impressions being the procluct for the year. The demands upon the Photographing Section during the year have been very great and its capacity has been taxed to the utmost. In the Electrotyping Section the output has not been quite as large as during the previous year, owing to the fact that for nearly three months work was suspended during the installation of the new plant. The new plant is now working ,-ery satisfactorily, ancl the time lost during the installation will soon he made up by the more rapid output that is now possible. The Drawing anrl Engraving Division has also supplied information in response to a large number of calls involving areas, shore lines, distances, tracings from original sheets, maps of obsolete ancl canceled charts, and miscellaneous blue prints, etc. 'fhe Chart Division, constituted by the Chart and Hydrographic sections, has remained under the charge of Assistant Gershom Bradford, Inspector of Charts. The issue of charts for the year r903 has been considerably larger than in any previous year. In the Hydrographic Section the work of indicating chart corrections, prt>paring the monthly Notice, to :Mariners, etc., was attended to in a very satisfactory manner. The Section sustained a severe loss hy the cleath on July 2, 1902, of l\Ir. \V. C. \Villenbucher, the chief hydrographic draftsman. His successor, Mr. J. T. \\'atkins, has attended to the work in a ,·ery satisfactory ancl thorough manner. The Section has had the assistance from time to time of field draftsmen when they were not engaged upon field work. The Instrument Division continued under the charge of Mr. E. G. Fischer, the chief mcchanician, and the usual amount of work has been accomplished, which consists mainly of repairs to instruments, the construction of such new instruments as are not obtainable in the market, the issue of instruments, camp outfit, and general property to field parties, miscellaneous correspondence relating thereto, keeping the necessary accounts relating to the distribution of instruments and general property, etc. Among the special items mentioned in Mr. Fischer's report are the construction of 12 new plane table alidades, the reconstmction of 2 Gambey theodolites, the regraduation of a 10-inch Gambey theodolite, the construction of 9 "Harbor and channel sweeps" for discovering shoals, rocks, etc., in harbors, and the construction of 12 pairs of telemeters with metallic ( magnalium) hacks. Valuable assistance was also rendered the Electrotyping Section during the installation of the new electrotyping plant. The Library and Archives Division has continuecl under the charge of Mr. E. J.,. Burchard. Cood progress has been made in the indexing of the library ancl special attention has been gh·en to

The compilation and preparation for publication of the "List and Catalogue of Publications of the Survey, 1816-1902" was completed, and progress made on the manuscript on bibliography of the Mason and Dixon line. The Miscellaneous Section, under the immediate direction of Mr. H. C. Allen, attended to the purchase and distribution of supplies required for the OffiC'e, the making of requisitions for printing and binding, the issue of stationery to field parties and office divisions, the custody of the publications of the Survey, and the keeping of the records relative to their disposition.

The average effective force of the Computing Division during the year was 17. This force \'aried between the extremes of 11 in January and 21 in December, and was about 50 per cent larger than during the preceding fiscal year. The work of the Division shows a corresponding increase in amount in spite of the fact that a considerable portion of the increase in force consisted of aids holding temporary appointments and of others who were assigned to the Division to acquire practical knowledge of the methods in use. The more important computations upon which the Computing Division has been engaged during the year are as follows: First. The completion for publication of the reduction of the Lake Survey Triangulation to the United States Standard Datum. This work was completed in September,
I 992.

Second. A new adjustment 'of the precise level net. The first adjustment was completed in 1900. Since that time so much new leveling has been done that the new net, as now adjusted, contains over 30 per cent of new leveling. Third. The computation of the triangulation in California and its reduction to the United States Standard Datum. This was begun in August, 1902, and at the end of the fiscal year it was nearly completed from the Mexican boundary northward to the vicinity of Point Conception, near the west end of Santa Barbara Channel. Fourth. On October 23, 1902, the work of making a new investigation of the form of the geoid within the United States wa<; commenced and good progress was made before the end of the fiscal year. Fifth. The triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian in I 902, including the occupation of 75 primary stations, covered about 6 ~ 0 in length in latitude, or 444 miles. The field work was completed in October. The computations, including all secondary and tertiary points, as well as all computations of elevations, were completed in June, less than eight months from the date of the last field work. This computation is equivalent to about one-fourth the computations required in connection with the whole Transcontinental Triangulation, and this makes a record of which the Computing Division may be justly proud. The routine work of furnishing information to the officers in the field and to persons outside the Survey in re8ponse to requests for information was very heavy, and is constantly increasing. During the year the manuscript was prepared and the proof was read of Appendix 3 of the Report for 1902, "Triangulation in Kansas," which puts in printed form all the information available in regard to the triangulation in Kansas. The manuscript of two more appendices was nearly completed at the end of the year, namely, an appendix on precise leveling, and an appendix on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation in 1902, both of which are printed as appendices to this Report.

DETAILS OF OFFICE OPERATIONS.

The following extracts are taken from Mr. Hayford's report:
During the first three months of the year Mr. T. Russell, assistant engineer, Mrs. M. E. C. \Valker, l\liss B. l\l. Chase, and Miss K. R. Macqueen were engaged for various periods in finishing the computations of the Lake Survey Triangulation, these being persons who were paid by the Survey of the ~orthern and Northwestern Lakes, and who were doing the work under my direction in the Computing Division. l\fr. A. L. Baldwin acted as Chief of the Division during my absence therefrom, September 4-30, December 14-18, D~cember 22-January 3, March 11-14, and March 26-April 8. He was engaged during the last half of April, more than half of May, an<l all of June on special work. This was a serious loss to the Computing Division, as the Chief of the Division depends upon him as his first assistant, he being the only person in the Dh·ision having the necessary training and experience in both office and fieldwork to make him fully capable of taking charge during the absence of the chief, or of sharing in all parts of the chief's work when the chief is present. Of the members of the Computing Division, individually and as a group, I may reiterate with all sincerity what was said in my last annual report, namely, that with a "great deal of pleasure, and perhaps with some pride, I may state that on the whole each member of the Division has rendered zealous, efficient, and interested service throughout the year." Mr. :VI. H. Doolittle, the oldest computer in the Division, in rapi<lity of computation and especially in rapidity and accuracy in making complicated and difficult least square adjustments, is still unexcelled by any of the younger computers. · Miss Lilian Pike supervised all computations during the year connected with precise leveling and the adjustment of the precise level net, and has also done much in the way of editing and proof reading. In both of these lines of work, and especially in the latter, she has shown marked ability, and has saved the Chief of the Division from a great deal of the attention to detail which would otherwise have been necessary. During the last two and a half months of the fiscal year, while l\Ir. Bal<lwin was available for computing duty but a small portion of the time, l\Ir. C. R. Duvall has been depended upon as my first assistant, to have direct supervision over various computations in progress in the hands of the computers. He has shown steady improvement in ability in that direction, which is making him of great value to the Division. Miss Lelia ],,Harvie, appointed August 18, 1902, has been given a rather unusual opportunity, for a new computer, to learn the methodi; of complicated least-square adjustm~nts during the first year of her service. During the greater part of this year she has been working under the immediate direction of l\Ir. Doolittle, in cooperation with him on least-square adjustment. She has risen to the opportunity and has become an adept in making such computations.

The revision of the computation of the magnetic observations made by the field parties was kept nearly up to date and was practically completed at the close of the fiscal year. Two appendixes, ''The Magnetic Observatories of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in operation July r, l 902,'' and ''Results of Dip and Intensity Observations" (1897-1902) were prepared for publication in the Annual Report for 1002, and the proof of the United States Declination Tables for 1902 was read. A discussion of the magnetic observations made by several nations during the soiar eclipse of May 17-18, 1901, was completed and the results published; also, a preliminary discussion of the magnetic observations made at sea on board the Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer Blake between Baltimore and Porto Rico was completed. The Division prepared compass data to be used on 87 charts and for 20 places on the coast of Maine and 1 2 places on the coast of Massachusetts, to he used in the preparation of the Coast Pilot. The routine correspondence work of the Division was 20 per cent larger than during the preceding fiscal year. Mr. L. A. Bauer was absent on field duty during the greater portion of July, from September 15 to November 13, and from January 19 to April 16. A large portion of his time while in the Office was occupied by the duties assigned tohim as Inspector of Magnetic \Vork. During the absence of the Chief, his duties were performed by Mr. D. L. Hazard, computer. Mr. C. J. Houston, computer, was absent on field duty from April 19 to June 30. Numerous temporary assignments to the Division were made, usually for the instruction of the persons assigned in the use of instruments and in the methods of computation, so that they did not materially acl,·ance the progress of the work in hand.

Harmonic analyses were completed for a year each of hourly heights at 4 stations, and also for ten shorter series. This work, together with that in progres,; at the close of the fiscal year, is equivalent to the complete harmonic analyses of eight years of continuous record. N onharmonic reductions were made for 82 stations, at one of which six years were reduced, and four years at another, while the other series ranged from two years down to half a month. This work is equivalent to first reductions for twenty-six years of continuous high and low waters. The plane of reference for the reduction of soundings was determined for 69 stations. About twenty-eight years of self-registering tide-gauge records were. tabulated as high and low waters, and also as hourly heights of the sea. Tide notes were prepared for 236 stations upon 56 charts and 68 original hydrographic sheets. Tidal information was furnished to the field parties and in response to requests from i11di~iduals not connected with the Survey in 297 instances, involving the preparation of descriptions of 563 bench marks. tidal data for r 588 stations, and current data for 2 r stations. There were received, examined, and registered an aggregate of about nineteen years of record from self-registering tide gauges at r 6 stations, together with about five years of record from box and staff gauges, consisting of 104 original and 59 duplicate volumes of tide observations made by 34 hydrographic parties at 71 stations. Tidal records from outside sources were received as follows: July 1 to March 3 r, with self-registering tide gauge at Reedy Island, Delaware, maintained by the Philadelphia Maritime Exchange; six years' records of observations at the entrance to St. Johns River, Florida, were loaned to the Survey by the Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army,

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903·

and one month's record of observations on Culebra Island, Porto Rico, by the Navy Department. Copies of the predicted tides for Wellington and Port Russell, New Zealand, with tidal differences for 80 subordinate ports, were prepared and furnished in response to a request from the Secretary of the Marine Department of New Zealand. Some questions connected with the flow of water under the action of gravity were studied by Mr. R. A. Harris. These relate chiefly to th~ velocities of tidal streams over their entire cross sections at various depths from the surface and at different distances from the center of the stream. He also constructed a cotidal chart for the northern part of the Indian Ocean. His studies of this region show that the tides there are primarily due to local oscillations. Waves progressing at nearly the rate due to depth occur in most of the shallow arms of this ocean. Such is the case in the Persian Gulf, in the Gulf of Kutch; in Palk Strait and Bay, in the Gulf of Cambay, in the Gulf of Martaban, in the western part of Malacca Str~it, in most of the gulfs and bays along the northern coast of Australia, and in Sharks Bay. Similar work is in progress for other oceans, and a preliminary cotidal chart for the eastern coast of the United States was completed. The Tide Tables for the year 1904 were prepared for printing, and the proof was read, before the close of the fiscal year. These tables contain current diagrams for Boston Harbor, Nantucket and Vineyard sounds, Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay, in addition to those for New York Harbor which were given last year. The sunrise and sunset table was recomputed and arranged according to the sun's declination, with the approximate corresponding date as a rough argument when desired.

This Division is divided into five sections-the Drawing, the Engraving, the Printing, the Photographing, and the Electrotyping sections. Each section executed the work indicated by its title, and the combined result is shown by the charts published and issued by the Survey. During the year 332 requests for information were received and answered in the Division. These involved the measurement of areas and shore line and distances between various points, the preparation of tracings from original topographic and hydrographic sheets, copies of old and canceled charts, and the construction of special maps.

174

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903·

Two of the new charts published, those of San Francisco Bay, are intended as examples of the method used in producing them. They were made 11p from engraved plates showing the hydrography, contour curves of the bottom, som1dings, etc., and the topography was added by photolithography from drawings made on a larger scale and reduced to fit the chart. Color was used on the charts published by lithography to a greater extent than ever before, and extended in many instances to the water areas to distinguish areas of the same depth. The preparation of plates by the heliogravure process was continued and five plates were completed. From May r until June 20, Mr. E. H. Fowler senred as Acting Chief of the Division during the absence of the Chief.

In addition to the foregoing 514 charts were revised (including second and third revisions of the same chart), corrected and verified for new editions or new prints. Twenty-one projections for topographic sheets and 35 for hydrographic sheets were constructed for the use of the field parties or in the Office. Three hundred and fiftyfour topographic and hydrographic sheets were inked, lettered, plotted, revised, or made ready for the approval of the Office. A large number of illustrations (more than 100) were prepared for publication in the Annual Report of the Superintendent for 1902, and 40 illustrations were prepared for the Report for 1903. A great deal of work was done at the request of the State Department in aiding in the preparation of the United States' case for presentation to the Alaska Boundary

Tribunal. This work included the preparation, verification of the maps in two atlases, and general supervision o\'er the publication of the same, one of which contained 25 sheets and the other 30. In addition to the large maps, numerous special drawings and maps were prepared, including four bromide enlargements (4 by 10 feet). The work of the Drawing Section was under the immediate direction of Mr. E. H. Fowler, Chief Draftsman, who deserves great credit for the efficient manner in which the work has been carried on and the introduction of time and labor saving methods. The Chief of the Division reports that the men of this section have shown steady improvement in their work, and, being faithful and attentive, deserve credit for the high standard maintained and the amount of work completed.

During the year there was a considerable increase in the number of new charts engraved as compared with the preceding year. A large portion of the time of the engravers was used in making extensive corrections to the printing plates, and, while the number of plates corrected for printing is not so large as during the previous year, the corrections have generally been more extensive. On all the plates for new editions of charts the form of the notes was changed to accord with the standard in use at present, and this involved a great deal of work. The continued use of the standard alphabet plates insured uniformity in all titles.

The work completed in this section is less than during the previous year, the result of three months enforced idleness of the plant while new machinery was being installed and repairs were being made. The plant is an excellent one and the facilities for work have been largely increased.

A comparison of the total issue of charts for the fiscal year with the issue in previous years, except for the years 1898 and 1899, when the issue for governmental purposes was abnormal, shows the total to be much larger than that of any other year, or 54 per cent larger than the average annual issue, and 32 per cent larger than the issue for the previous fiscal year. The above statement does not include the charts published and issued at the suboffice in Manila, except those sent to Washington for distribution.
Hydrographic Section.

The work of indicating the chart corrections and preparing the monthly Notices to Mariners was performed with marked ability'by Mr. Wyvill. Mr. Watkins was employed in plotting and verifying field sheets, in the revision and verification of proofs, charts, . and drawings, and on ot)ler miscellaneous work, which included the supervision of t~ work of various draftsmen temporarily detailed to duty fu the Division.

On July 2, 1902, the Division was deprived, by death, of the services of the chief hydrographic draftsman, Mr. W. C. Willenbucher, who entered the service in 1873, and rendered faithful and efficient service until death closed his useful and honorable career.

The energy of the Instrument Division during the year was largely devoted to repairing the numerous instruments in use by the field parties of the Survey. During the year l 024 instruments were cleaned, adjusted, a,nd sent to the field. Work on new instruments was done whenever more pressing duties permitted and the 12 new plane. table alidades begun during the previous fiscal year were completed. Twelve pairs of telemeters were made, using a joint piece of improved design, made of ruagnalium, an alloy of aluminum and magnesium. Telemeters, with metallic backs, made in this way are as light as those made of wood and are sufficiently strong and rigid to resist very rough usage in the field without losing their usefulness. The difficulties arising from the oxidation and corrosion of the silver films on sextant mirrors, as the result of their use in the hydrographic work, was overcome by coating the mirrors sent to the Office for repairs with a mercury-tin amalgam. Various instruments were remodeled and repaired. A working design for a channel and harbor sweep, based on suggestions made to the Chief of the Division by officers of the Survey, was made and 9 of the sweeps were constructed for use on the vessels of the Survey. A description of this apparatus is given in Appendix 6 to this Report. The preparation of a design for a quick-sounding machine was undertaken in accordance with suggestions from officers of the Survey, and good progress was made in perfecting such a machine. A

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

considerable amount of work was done in repairing and improving the magnetic instruments of the Survey. Considerable progress was made in the construction of a new tide-predicting machine. The usual routine work, including the verification of property returns and inventories of instruments and general property, was kept up to date. The Chief of the Division was assigned to special duty on several occasions. In July he took part in the experiments with wireless telegraph apparatus, made for the purpose of testing the availability of the Marconi system for use in the longitude work of the Survey, as described in Appendix r to this Report, under the name of Assistant Wainwright. He made the arrangements necessary for the installation of an electrical tide indicator in the office of the Maritime Association of New York; examined an 8-inch alt-azimuth instrument belonging to the Trigonometrical Survey of Trinidad, British West Indies, at the request of th~ officer in charge, after extensive repairs had been made; supervised the construction of a leveling instrument of the same design as that used in the Survey, at the request of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway Company, and arranged for placing a contract for the construction of a tape base apparatus for the Brazilian Government, at the request of the authorities of that country. The continued applications made to the Superintendent for the service of experts to supervise the construction and repair of instruments of precision in this country, belonging to foreign governments, are gratifying evidences of the feeling of high esteem with which the Coast and Geodetic Survey is regarded abroad and of the confidence felt in the officers and methods of the organization. In closing his report Mr. Fischer states thatThe conduct of the employees of the Division, whose work is of a much higher class than that given to employees in the same class of work in private establishments, is worthy of praise. They have shown zeal and conscientious interest in the performance of the duties assigned to them.

The routine work of this section was kept up to date and was larger in amount than during the previous fiscal year. The mopey available for the Office expenses was larger than usual and a greater number of publications were received and issued, as shown in the following lists. The issue of the monthly Notice to Mariners, involving 1 600 addresses, was assigned to this section 011 July 1, and they were mailed promptly as soon as received from the printer. The use of an addressograph, purchased for the p~rpose, greatly facilitated the work of mailing the publications of the. Survey and rendered it possible to accomplish the large amount of work performed by those engagec upon it. ·

c;ENERAL S'l'A'l'R:\[gN'l'.

This appendix is a supplement to Appendix Ko. 8 of the Report for 1899, entitled ''Precise Leveling in the United States.'' The purpose of that appendix was, as stater! in its introduction, ·'To bring the publication in detail of the results of precise leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey as nearly as possible up to elate; to set forth the methods employed in making a general adjustment of the precise level net covering the eastern half of the United States and inyolving leveling hy other organizations as well as by the Coast and Geodetic Suryey; to put into print in convenient form for ready reference a concise compilation of the corrected elevations resulting from this general adjustment; and, finally, to make available in form for general use, examination, am! criticism the more important items of information and opinions in regard to precise leveling which have been acquired during the course of a long and careful investigation of the problem of making such an adjustment and of securing the highest degree of accuracy in future precise level observations consistent with a reasonable degree of economy and rapidity." The purpose of the present appendix is to furnish such additions and corrections as will bring the information in regard to precise leveling in the United States up to 1903. Four new lines were nm by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1900, with an aggregate length of 1 525 kilometers ( 948 miles). One of these lines extends from Cincinnati southward through Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama to Binningham. It connects at Knoxville, Tenn., with the thousand-mile loop of precise levels which had been run in 1896-1898 by the United States Geological Survey from Morehead City, N. C., to Brunswick, Ga., via Raleigh, Asheville, Knoxville, and Atlanta. It also connects at Decatur and at Birmingham with the lines Corinth to Decatur and Meridian to Birmingham, respectively, which are shown in Appendix No. 8 of the Report for 1899. This line, together with the Geological Survey line with which it connects, serves then to break up the single large circuit, Washington-Hagerstown-OclinBiloxi-Washington, of the precise level net of 1900 (see sketch opposite page 42+, Report for 1899) into five smaller circuits, and to furnish accurate elevations for the southeastern group of States. A second line was run in 1900 from Norfolk, Nebr., to

Sioux City, Iowa. It served to add a new circuit, Kansas City-Sioux City-NorfolkAbilene-Kansas City, to the precise level net of 1900. The two other lines run during 1900 by the Coast and Geodetic Survey were from Norfolk, Nebr., to Page, Nebr., to connect with the Page Base, and from Solomon, Kans., to Anthony, Kans., to connect with the Anthony Base. Three new lines were run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1901 with an aggregate length of 851 kilometers (529 miles). Two of these lines, namely, from the Page Base westward to Chadron, Nebr., and from Cheyenne, Wyo., to Orin Junction, \Vyo., served to bring a new circuit of the level net nearly to completion. Tht. third line was from Decatur, Ala., to Corinth, Miss. After the level line of 1900 had been run from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Birmingham, Ala., by way of Decatur, it became evident that there was a large error' of o. 7 meter or more in some one of the level lines in Alabama and Mississippi. The evidence indicated that the error was probably in the line Corinth to Decatur, which had been run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in 1895. It was determined, therefore, to relevel this line, even though it was run originally with great care by an excellent method and with good instruments. The releveling of this line developed a discrepancy of ·I meter near the western end of the line, as set forth later in this publication. Four new lines were completed by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1902. The aggregate length of these lines is 2 ooo kilometers ( 1 243 miles). The line from Dobbs Ferry, N. Y., to Greenbush, N. Y. (now Rensselaer), as used in the adjustment of the level net in 1899, was known to be of an iilferior degree of accuracy. In view of the facts that a large amount of new water leveling and precise leveling was being done in the region of the Great Lakes by the United States Lake Survey, that the officers of that Survey were very desirous of securing as high a degree of accuracy as possible in the determinations of the absolute elevations of the Lakes, and that any uncertainty in the elevation at Greenbush affected directly all of the assigned elevations throughout the Great Lakes, it was determined to rerun the line Dobbs Ferry to Greenbush and supersede the old line, and this was done early in the summer of 1902. The second line of ·1902 was from Chadron, Nebr., westward to Orin Junction, Wyo. It served to complete the great circuit, Abilene, Kans.-Norfolk, Nebr.-Orin Junction, Wyo.-Cheyenne, Wyo.-Denver, Colo.-Abilene, Kans., and thus to secure fully checked accurate elevations connected with the net as far westward as Cheyenne and Denver. The third, line of 1902 (finished in 1903) reaches from the Anthony Base in southern Kansas southward to Bowie, Tex., and eastward to Shreveport, I~::i.., with spur lines to Bowie Base and by way of Temple to Lampasas Base and. to Holland, Tex. This line is connected with the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation at various points between Anthony, Kans., and Lampasas, Tex., in addition to those named. The portion of the line from Anthony, Kans., to Shreveport, La., by way of Bowie, Tex., and Fort Worth, Tex., forms the west side of a great circuit, Monroe, La.-Little Rock, Ark.-Harrisonville, Mo.-Holliday, Kans.-Abilene, Kans.-Shreveport, La.Monroe, La. The fourth line of 1902 was from Rockreek, Wyo., the former western terminus of the precise leveling, to Red Desert, Wyo. It is proposed to continue this line

westward, via Ogden, to Seattle, where it will connect with sea level on the Pacific Coast. Besides the above new lines by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the following lines run by other organizations have been added to the precise level net: First. The loop of precise levels run by the United States Geological Survey from Morehead City, N. C., to Brunswick, Ga., via Raleigh, Asheville, Knoxville, and Atlanta, 1 674 kilometers ( r 040 miles), has been already referred to in connection with the Coast and Geodetic Survey line in 1900 from Cincinnati to Birmingham, ·with which it is connected at Knoxville by a Coast and Geodetic Survey spur line. A line by the United States Geological Survey from Cleveland, Tenn., to Chattanooga, Tenn., connects the loop again with the Cincinnati-Birmingham line at Chattanooga. Ten lines of the Geological Survey in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, with an aggregate length of l l 28 kilometers ( 701 miles), were also added. Second. The line from Biloxi, Miss., to Fort Adams, Miss., via New Orleans and Baton Rouge, 407 kilometers ( 253 miles), was run under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission in 1897-98 and 1900. This line enters directly into the level net, superseding the lines between those points formerly run by the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Mississippi River Commission. 'fhere can be little doubt that the e1trlier leveling should be superseded, partly because the later leveling is probably of a higher degree of accuracy and partly because there are good reasons for supposing that the elevations of many of the intermediate bench marks have changed since the earlier leveling. Third. The line Pittsburg, Pa., to Lawrenceburg, Ind., 79 r kilomet~rs (491 miles), was run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in 1896-97 and 189cr r 900 in connection with surveys of the Ohio River. This line is continued westward beyond Lawrenceburg to Petersburg, Ky. The line Pittsburg to Lawrenceburg crosses and is connected with the line Grafton to Cincinnati, at Belpre, Ohio, and it therefore adds two new circuits to the level net. Fourth. The lines Brainerd to Lake Itasca, 205 kilometers ( 127 miles), and Cass Lake to Grand Rapids, 98 kilometers (6r miles), both in Minnesota, run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, were added to the net as spurs. Fifth. The line Lima to Monaca in Ohio, 380 kilometers ( 236 miles), nm by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, was furnished for incorporation in the net by the United States Geological Survey. It divides one circuit of the former net into two. The line Harrisburg to \Villiamsport, by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, was also incorporated into the net from their bench mark book. Sixth. The new line of levels run by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1902 with instruments and methods similar to those now in use by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, from Washington, D. C., to Foley, Pa., 283 kilometers ( 176 miles), was incorporated in the net. It is connected with the leveling formerly used in the net at Hancock, W. Va., and Cumberland, Md., as well as at Washington, D. C. Seventh. The United States Lake Survey made the most important addition to the level net received from outside the Coast and Geodetic Survey. It furnished a new line of precise levels from Green bush, N. Y. , to Oswego, N. Y. , 3 13 kilometers ( 194 miles), several short lines between the Great Lakes, and a series of new or revised water levels covering the whole reg~on of the Great Lakes. The water levels are in part a revision

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

of old observations and in part new observations, and supersede all the water leveling on the Great Lakes formerly used in the level net. The Greenbush-Oswego line supersedes all former lines between those points in so far as the adjustment of the level net is concerned. This contribution by th<.: Lake Survey of 4 27 5 kilometers ( 2 656 miles) of water leveling, and of 564 kilometers (350 miles) of land leveling lines, nearly all of the highest degree of accuracy, serYes to strengthen greatly all that portion of the level net between Greenbush, N. Y., and Tibbetts Point, X. Y., on the eastern, and Chicago and Duluth on the western portion of the net. Eighth. Certain lines nm by the Board 011 Deep \V:aterways and hy the New York State Barge Canal Survey in New York, which were connected at both ends with lines of the level net, have been used to furnish the elevations of certain permanent bench marks established along them. They have not, however, been used in the adjustment of the level net. The proper corrections have been applied to make them fit the net, and the corrected elevations have been introduced into the list of published elevations. In each case the lines used in the level net between the same encl points are of a much higher degree of accuracy than these levels. There has thus been added to the level net since it was adjusted in 1899, 4 300 kilometers (about 2 700 miles) of precise leveling hy the Coast and Geodetic Sun·ey and 3 200 kilometers (about 2 ooo miles) of leveling by other organizations. Of these lines only the last two in Minnesota are on spurs from the net. All the other lines form links or parts of links of the net and are therefore concerned in the adjustment. \Vhen there is added to such a level net as that which was fully and carefully adjus~ecl in 1899, so much new and accurate leveling as is indicated above, it is not easy to decide upon the best course of procedure. It is a great convenience to have fixed assigned elevations for bench marks-standard elevations, so to speak-to which all other elevations in surrounding regions shall be referred. Every change in the assigned elevations of the principal bench marks is apt to cause inconvenience by making extensive changes necessary in computations based upon these assigned elevations. On the other hand, however desirable it may be to have fixed values for the elevations of the principal bench marks, it does not seem possible to decide upon a final standard elevation for any bench mark, unless it is known positively that no more precise leveling connected with the net is to be done, or else that, if done, it will not be utilized to improve existing assigned elevations. If all new leveling is to be utilized to the fullest extent in securing elevations of the highest degree of accuracy in every part of the net, then whenever new leveling forming links in the net is secured the whole net must be readjusted and the old adjusted elevations must be completely superseded by the new. A conservative procedure intermediate between the two radical plans indicated above-namely, that of holding all old elevations without change and merely fitting new leveling to the old, and that of superseding all old elevations by new ones-seems to be best and has been followed in this appendix. Whenever a new adjustment of a net is made on account of the introduction of new lines of levels the di.anges in the old elevations and differences of elevations are necessarily greater in the vicinity of the new leveling than. in regions more remote. At any junction point in the net for which the change in U1e assigned elevation required by the new adjustment is very small, or, in other words, for which the ele\'ations from the old and new adjustments agree closely, it seems best to hold the old assigned elevation. Especially goes it seem certain that

199

whenever the change called for by the new adjustment is considerably smaller than the uncertainties in the new adjusted elevations no change should be made. So also when for any link of the net the new adjustment gives a difference ofelevation for its two ends which agrees with the old adjusted difference of elevation within the limits of uncertainty of the new adjusted difference it seems that the old difference of elevatiot1 should be held without change, even though a constant correction to the elevations along the line be found necessary. It happens that the new leveling fntroduced into the net in the 1903 adjustment supersedes the two most· important connections with mean sea level-namely, at Kew York from the northward and at Biloxi from the westward-and that in each case foe effect is to increase the assigned elevations of points in the interior. Hence, it was found in applying the above principles to the adjustment of 1903, that very few of the elevations could be held without change. It was found, however, that some of the differences of elevations could be kept unchanged, or, in other words, that there "·as a group of lines for which simply a constant change in the elevations was required to bring them sufficiently near to the theoretically best values. The composition of the level net as adjusted in 1903, including all spurs, hut excluding all superseded lines, is as follows:

"fhe new leveling added since the adjustment of r899 was made constitutes more than 30 per cent of the net as now adjusted. ,· The adjustment of 1899 fixed the elevations of 4 200 bench marks. The 1903 adjustment fixes the elevations of 6 900 bench marks, all published in this appendix. The complete list of elevations as adopted for the present is published in this appendix. It is believed that these adopted ele,·ations are substantially as good as any that can be deduced from the leveling available at this Office up to date CJ uly, l 903). Descriptions are published in this appendix for all bench marks introduced into the net for the first time, and revised descriptions or additional notes to descriptions are introduced as a result of information acquired since the last publication, or to correct mistakes in that publication. Aside from acknowledgments made at other points in this publication, the author feels that he should acknowledge here his indebtedness to Miss Lilian Pike, Computer, for her supervision of the computations of the leveling for 1901 and 1902 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey and of the preparation of the new list of elevations of the bench marks for the whole net, for a portion of the work of adjustment, and for much verbal assistance in preparing this text; to Mr. 0. M. Leland, Computer, for aid in the adjustment of the level net, and to Mr. \V. H. Burger, Aid, for supervision of the computations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey le\·el lines of 1900, and assistance in gathering some of the material for this text.

NEW PRECISE LEVEi,.

Commencing with the summer of 1900 a new type of precise level was put into use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and a method of observation was adopted which has remained unchanged except in unimportant details since that time. Three seasons of leveling have furnished a thorough test of the instrument and mdhod. The train of events leading up to the change is of little importance now. The justification of the present instrument and method must be found in the accuracy., rapidity, and·cheapness of the recent leveling. Hence, in this appendix, the first official publication in which the results of these three seasons of leveling appear, it is appropriate that detailed information in regard to the degree of success attained in the leveling since the change was made should be fully set forth. The following description* of the new instrument is reproduced, with a few and unimportant changes, from a description written by Mr. E. G. Fischer, Chief of the Instrument Division, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the designer of the instrument. When it became necessary to provide additional instruments for carrying out the geodetic leveling planned for the season of l 900, opportunity arose to embody in a new design the fruits of the deliberations of the committee on precise leveling of l 898-99, i" whose conclusions had been tried and proven with the three geodetic levels Nos. l, 5, and 6, remodeled in the instrument shop of the Survey in the spring'of 1899 and used in the field during the whole of. that season. A careful study of the results obtained with these instruments proved conclusively that the use of the new alloy of iron and nickel, which was first applied in their reconstruction, and the reduction of the distance between the level and the line of collimation were decided improvements and practically eliminated errors due to temperature effects. · These facts were kept in view in designing the new instruments. As the newly adopted method of observation obviated the use of the reversible stride level and the rotating telescope, the distance between the level and the line of collimation could be reduced to a minimum by placing the former in an opening cut into the telescope and the latter could be placed within a tube-shaped support, at one end of which two pivot screws provide a horizontal axis around which the telescope can be rotated and the line of collimation put into the horizon by means of a fine motion or micrometer screw mounted at the other end. By making the support for the telescope tubular, it was not only given the strongest and lightest form, but it could be made to serve at the same time as a protection to the level mounted in the telescope. The level-reading device, in principle the same as that usec:I in the reconstruction of levels Nos. 1, 5, and 6, being mounted at the side of the telescope at binocular distance from it, offers, with the exception of a small mirror, which is almost horizontal and fastened neither to the level nor the telescope, no additional surface to wind pressure and enables the observer to stand with head and body erect while observing the rod with one eye and the level with the other.

of the latter disposed of within the head of the tripod; thus not only affording room for an unusually long and therefore more durable and rigid center, but also bringing the center of gravity of the instrument much nearer to the plane of support.
TH!,; :\lATHRIAL IN THB NEW LHVE!,.

For all those parts upon which depend the constancy of the relation between the line of collimation and the level--the telescope, the tube incasing the level vial, the drawtube, reticle ring, and the supporting cylinder-the material selected is the same as that used in the reconstruction of geodetic levels Nos. 1, 5, and 6 in the spring of 1 899. The nickel-steel alloys brought out by Dr. Ch. Ed. Guillaume,* of the International Bureau of Standard Weights and Measures, had attracted considerable attention by reason of their low expansion coefficients (down to 0.000001 per degree centigrade). Inquiry established the. fact that tubing and castings, almost indispensable in the construction of instruments, could not be obtained, because attempts to produce them had not yet been successful. Mr. George T. Ennis, of Washinton, D. C., who furnishes the brass castings required in the shops of the Survey, was persuaded to undertake a series of trials in 1899 of alloying various kinds of steel and iron with nickel. A quantity of what in the trade is called ''machinery steel'' and commercially pure nickel was weighed off in the proportion of 64 of steel to 36 of nickel, the same from which Dr. Guillaume obtains a coefficient of less than one-millionth per degree centigrade. The furnaces of brass founders being supplied with air only by natural draft, it was with considerable difficulty that sufficient heat could be developed to melt the steel, and when mixture with the nickel was finally accomplished the temperature was still too low to allow impurities to rise freely to the surface and leave the casting sound and solid. In another attempt steel turnings from the large gun forgings being assembled at the Washington ordnance yard were used, but the trial castings also proved porous. The coefficients of these specimens, as determined from the temperatures of o 0 and about 60° C., were, however, quite low, namely, three-millionths, nearly. The melting point of cast iron being much lower than that of wrought iron or steel, a trial was made with it, using the same proportion. But while the castings were now sound and free from pores the coefficient had increased to nearly five-millionths. The results of Dr. Guillaume's investigations showing that but a slight variation from the above given proportion caused a change of several units in the sixth place of the coefficient, it was thought likely that a loss of one or the other of the two metals by oxidation during the melting and mixing was the cause of this increase. For this reason a number of alloys were made of different proportions, of which one of 66 ;:3 parts of a medium-grained cast iron, furnished by the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company, of Providence, R. I., and 3373 parts of which is called "grain nickel" was finally adopted. It can be cast free from sand and blow holes, and has a coefficient of 0.000004. No thorough tests as to strength, etc., were made of this alloy, but so far as shop practice reveals its physical properties it can be said to be rather brittle, easily worked in the lathe and with the file, entirely unmalleable, and behaving practically like the better and softer grades of cast iron. i· It can readily be brazed and soldered, and,
*These alloys are protected by patents. t As soon ns nickel-steel tubing can be obtained the instruments may be considerably improved by its use. Such material will not be brittle, like the material here described, and moreover will probably have a much lower coefficient of expansion.

· unlike cast iron, very easily takes an exceptionally fine polish, resembling that of nickel. The smoothness with which it wears against itself, even under considerable pressure, should be particularly mentioned. . For instance, the nickel-iron drawtubes of the three remodeled instruments of 1899, though moving in bearings of the same metal, do not show the slightest wear or looseness, though they were used in running 200, 300, and 600 miles of leveling line, respectively. None of the acids except aqua regia will readily attack it. A rectangular piece submerged in water for twelve days showed formation of what resembled iron oxide, but only along the sharp corners and without pitting, while the surfaces remained bright. A rough test proved the specific gravity of the alloy to be between that of iron and of nickel, but below that theoretically deduced from their proportions. The nickel used in these experiments was purchased at a cost of 42 cents and the iron at 6 cents a pound, making the cost of the two-to-one alloy 18 cents per pound, which is 2 cents less than that of good brass. The pointed screws pivoting the telescope, the screws holding in place the level tube and by'which the level is adjusted, the screws holding and adjusting the reticle ring, and the fine-motion micrometer screw, upon all of which depends the constancy of the relation between the line of sight and the plane tangent to the middle point of the level vial, and which require to be of a material much harder than the casting above described, are made of nickel steel, with a coefficient of o. 000001, obtained from the Societe Anonyme de Commentry-Fourchambault, 26 Place Vendome, Paris. This alloy is well adapted for screws of all kinds, and should now entirely replace steel in the manufacture of all measuring screws, such as micrometer screws for astronomic and surveying instruments, micrometer calipers, gauges, etc., used in mechanical engineering, provided, of course, that the nuts into which such screws are threaded are made of the same material, for it is obvious that a screw with a coefficient of 0.000001 could be made to fit closely in a nut of brass whose coefficient is 0.000018 only at one certain temperature. The material used in the construction of other portions of the instrument will be named in the description of those parts.
THI~ TRIPOD OF THE .Nmv LRVEL.

The tripod is of the usual form. The three legs, separating some distance above the feet into two rectangular rods, pivot in the head by means of bolts about Icm diameter at points forming a regular hexagon. The feet consist of pointed hollow sockets· about 14cm long and :3Yzcm diameter at the top, fitted and fastened by screws to the legs. They are made of 10 per cent aluminum bronze, an alloy but little inferior to steel in hardness and toughness. The two rods forming the leg are made of black walnut, 2c by 3Yz 0 m, and fastened together at two points by walnut braces which are screwed between them. The tops of the legs are brass bound to guard against the splitting out of the bolt holes. In obtaining the length of the legs, which should be made to suit the observer's height, their normal angle with the ground was taken to be 60°, the vertical distance between the bolt holes in the head of the stand and the line of collimation begin 13°m. The head of the stand, also of black walnut, is 4_% 0 m thick and carries sunk into its upper surface the three V-grooved plates forming the supports for the foot screws of the instrument. In a circular recess in the lower surface is held by a ring-shaped plate marked a in fig. 1, a washer, b, shaped so as to form a seat for the convex shoulder of

the nut c, which is threaded on the screw d. This screw, 1cm.3 in diameter and of a pitch of 8 threads per centimeter, enlarges at its upper end to a cup-sha~;ied nut, which can be screwed upon the lower end of the center socket of the instrument. The washer b is not confined in its recess so closely but what it can move laterally and adapt itself to any position the vertical axis may assume in relation so the head of the stand. When the instrument is set upon the stand the lower end of the center socket will come to rest upon the cup-shaped nut before the foot screws can touch their supports, thus leaving it in an unstable position and making it practically impossible for the observer to forget to secure the instrument to the stand before it is carried to the place of work. The nut c is loosened before observing, and tightened only when the it~strument and stand are to be carried from station to station.
THH lNSTRUMF.NT BASE AND CJ.:NTER.

The instrument base, designated by e on the diagram, is a single piece of hard and fine-grained cast iron, furnished by the Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company. In its three 'legs, at a radial distance of 9cm, are threaded the foot screws f, of 9Yz"" diameter and 15 threads per centimeter, and having a bearing of 2c 111 .3. The screws are of such length as to permit a motion of 6m"' above and below the normal position, thus allowing the instrument to be leveled even under unusual inclination of the head. of the tripod. No position of the foot screws can prevent the fine-motion or micrometer screw from freely passing over them. The ends of the legs are split in the usual manner and provided with milled-head screws for clamping the foot scre\vs. The clamp arm g, with its clamp screw Ii, is fitted into a groove near the top of the center socket, and carries at the outer end the fine-motion screw i for moving the telescope horizontally in azimuth. The central portion of the instrument base is bored out conically and affords a bearing throughout its length for the unusually long center (rocm), which is made of the hardest grade of tool steel, Sanderson's No. 6. It is secured against being withdrawn by a small nut screwed to its lower end. Upon its upper en<l is fastened permanently, by screwing and riveting, a disk or flange}, of s"m.s diameter, made of hard cast iron, which fonns the base of the supporting cylinder.

THI> SUPPOR'NNG CYLINDER OF THJ~ 'fRI,lIBCOPE.

This, indicated in figs. 1, 2, and 3 by k, is a nic.kel-iron casting, as stated above. Its length is 21c"'.6, its outer diameter 5c"'.9, its inner diameter 5c111 .4, leaving a thickness of wall of 2mm.5. At its middle point is a cylindrical boss or hub (l in figs. I, 2, and 3), of the same diameter as the flange of the center, to which it is firmly fastened by four steel screws. Two lugs, 111 in fig. 2, are threaded to receive the pivoting screws n, which are made of nickel steel, and, with their points 2mm.6 below the center of the supporting cylinder, form a horizontal axis for the telescope~ At a distance of 1c111 .2 from the rear end and below is fastened, by two screws, the nut o (fig. 1), made of nickel iron, which carries the fine-motion or micrometer screw p. This latter, of 39 threads per centimeter nearly ( 100 per inch) and 7"'m diameter, is provided at its upper end with a small tip of glass hard steel, a~1d carries, below, an adjustable micrometer head of white zylonite q, which is 4cm. 1 in diameter and is dfvided into xoo parts. A hard rubber disk with milled edge, projecting beyond the micrometer head, not only protects the graduation from the fingers, but, by reason of its large diameter, facilitates

206

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

the setting of the sensitive level. An index for reading the micrometer head is provided. The supporting cylinder carries a removable eccentric ring r inserted into its forward end (figs. 1 and 2), of which the inner diameter is such as to permit the telescope pivoted between the screws n to rotate slightly without touching. A similar rings (figs. 1 and 3) at the rear end, liowever, is cut out so as to permit the telescope to move up and down, above and below the normal or horizontal position, by about 2"'m, while the sides of the ring permit of no lateral play, but form a guide for that amount of vertical motion. Directly in front of the micrometer screw is fastened to the supporting cylinder a small case holding an eccentric which can be rotated by a lever handle at the right siae of the instrument. When the lever handle is turned up the eccentric pushes against the telescope, lifts its weight off the micrometer screw, and presses it gently against a spring sunk into the upper part of the ring s. In this position the instrument can be carried without the risk of jarring the telescope and thereby disturbing the level adjustment. This device is not shown in the diagrams but can be seen in the photographic view (fig. 4). Against the hub l, on the right side of the instrument, is fastened a bracket carrying a small universal level, which is easily observed from the eye end of the telescope by means of a mirror mounted above it at an angle of 45° (see fig. 4). At the fonvard end of the supporting cylinder and below is mounted a post t (fig. 1 ), reaching downward between the horizontal pointing screw i and the spring case of the clamp arm g. The upper part of the supporting cylinder has cast into it a rectangular opening with a framing u surrounding it. A piece of plate glass, fitted into this framing by dovetail grooves, closes the opening against dust or air currents, hut can quickly be moved forward for the purpose of adjusting the level by loosening a small milled head screw (see fig. 4), and turning up a hinged locking piece. 0Yer this opening and against the sides of the framing is mounted by brass arms 1,1 the glass mirror w, arranged so as to permit of a small rotary adjustment for the purpose of adapting the level reading device to individual observers. It may be stated here that the opening in the supporting cylinder was placed as near as possible to its rear end and away from the middle of the instrument, because the level could at that place be put closer to the line of collimation without entering the cone formed hy the apertures of the objective and the reticle ring. Small grooves around the ends of the supporting cylinder afford the means of fastening, by wire rings or narrow metal bands, the leather cones x (fig. 1). They are fastened to the telescope in a similar manner, and effectively shut out dust and air currents without in the slightest degree preventing the telescope from assuming the position determined by the pivotiw.g screws at one end and the micrometer screw at the other end of the supporting cylinder.

the eye end and at a distance of gem from it are two constrictions forming the bearings A ring z is fitted and soldered into the telescope at the place where the 60° points of the pivoting screws 11 are bored into it (2s 0 m.9 from the eye end) for the purpose of strengthening it to resist strains caused by undue tightening of these screws. The drawtube, cast solid of nickel iron and bored out, is fitted closely into its bearings, and carries within an enlargement at its outer end, by means of four nickelsteel screws, the nickel-iron reticle ring. Great care was taken to fit the threads of these screws very tightly to insure, as much as possible, invariability of the position of the reticle. One vertical and three horizontal spider threads of the finest grade obtainable are mounted upon the reticle ring. The horizontal threads are equidistant and the upper and lower embrace a space of 3ocm at a distance of 10om. Two Steinheil eyepieces, of 12 01 m.5 and 9mm.5 (one-half inch and three-eighths inch), equivalent focus, to suit different weather conditions, are supplied. The objective lens is mounted in a cell cast of nickel iron. It is held in place by a spring ring, fastened with three small screws, in such manner as to hold it firmly in position, without restraining it from expanding and contracting with changes of temperature. It has a clear aperture of 4c 01 .2 and a focal length of 41c01 , giving a magnifying power of 32 diameters with the 12mm.5 and of 43 diameters with the 9mm.5 eyepiece. The drawtube is moved into focal distance in the usual way, by means of a rack and pinion, and has sufficient range to enable the observer to point on an object as near as 3. 5 meters. Just within or under the leather cones ;l' the telescope carries two enlargements or collars, which are turned to equal diameters, and serve the purpose of placing the pointing line into the geometric axis of the telescope. This adjustment is made in the shop permanently. It is done by laying the telescope, with these collars, upon two metal wye supports provided with leveling foot screws. Pointing on an object and rotating the telescope in the wyes reveals any want of parallelism between the axis of the two collars and the line connecting the intersection of the vertical and middle horizontal threads and the optical center of the objective. This is corrected by means of the four screws holding the reticle ring. Since the spider threads move with the drawtuhe, it also must move in a line parallel to the axis of the collars, in order to preserve true collimation in any position required by focusing upon the rod at different distances. To insure this parallelism, great care was taken in making the telescopes. The objectives were centered with special care, and the collars were turned true at the same chucking under which the drawtube bearings were bored. Inasmuch as any error of collimation enters into the result of leveling only to the small amount due to differences between back and fore sights, it may be said that these instruments, as far as collimation error is concerned, are practically faultless. In the same wye supports above mentioned, the level attached to the telescope is adjusted so that its axis is parallel to the vertical plane containing the line of collimation. This adjustment eliminates what is commonly called the "wind" of the level, and can not readily be made in the field. The position of the forward drawtube bearing and that of the micrometer screw were selected with the view to sufficient rigidity of that part of the telescope which rests upon the micrometer screw. The point of contact with the hardened tip of the screw is a small hardened steel plate a,. fastened into the telescope at the forward drawtube

bearing. The distance between the axis of the micrometer scre\v and the axis of 1otation formed by the pivoting screws 11 is l9cm. 15 nearly, which, with the screw pitch of 39 threads per centimeter, gives a value of about 2".6 per division of micrometer head. The distance between the axis of rotation of the telescope and the vertical center is 9c111 .8.
THE LEVHr. VIAr, OF THE NEW INSTRUMENT.

The level vial was made by A. Pessler, and is of the chambered type. It is l lcm.5 long, lc 111 .5 in diameter, and carries a graduation gem long in 2 11 " " spaces. The length of the bubble used is about 25 div., or 5c 111 .o. The value of a division of the level vial is 1 ".94 for level No. 7 and l".86 for No. 8. The mounting of the vial has been attended to with special care, with the aim of securing the greatest possible constancy of adjustment. The glass vial rests within a tube of nickel iron upon the ends of four small screws b,, piercing the tube, two at each end of the vial, 120° apart. A small tip c,, at the end of a flat spring fastened to the tube and also piercing it, presses with sufficient force upon the vial at each end, exactly over the supporting screws, to hold it firmly in place and yet permit it to expand and contract independently of the tube. Longitudinally the vial is confined by two cork rings d,, one at each end, which, however, leave a small clearance, so that the vial is free also in that direction. This is the manner in which all level vials, excepting only the smaller ones, have been mounted in the shops of the Survey for the past thirteen years. The level tube, with the vial thus supported, is secured to the telescope, sunk through an oblong opening close to the cone formed by the apertures of the objective and reticle ring. At the forward end it is held by a screw holding it down to a rounded support e,, screwed to the telescope, upon which it can be moved laterally by two opposing screws for adjusting the ''wind.'' The other end is made adj ustahle in the vertical for the purpose of keeping the level parallel to the line of collimation. This is the only adjustment required on the part of the observer in the field. A square-headed vertical screw .f., of about 27 threads per centimeter and fitting closely in the level tube end, is threaded tightly into that part of the telescope forming the forward <lrawtube bearing. Two strong helical steel springs, one on each side, press the level tube tightly upward against- the shoulder of the screw .f.. A socket wrench, with a lever arm 7c 111 .5 long, permits of applying rotary force to the screw without exerting any other pressure against the instrument and thereby displacing the pointing of the telescope, as is the case when using a screw-driver or capstan bar, so that this delicate adjustment is made quickly and with ease, ancl seldom requires to be repeated. As already stated, the adjustment of the reticle is made permanently in the shop, the observer having no means of testing it in the field. It is of great importance, therefore, that the reticle ring should not be disturbed, hut that, when necessary, the level be moved into parallelism with the pointing line. In the instruments as originally constructed the heads of the four screws holding the 1 eticle ring were exposed in the ordinary manner, as shown in illustration 4. Now ( 1903) the design has been so improved that the heads of these screws are completely inclosed in a protecting case and are inaccessible to the observer in the field. The observer, carrying the instrument from station to station, readily learns to hold it in such position as to prevent any change of the length of the bubble by establishing communication between the chamber and the interior of the vial. . In the vials used for these instruments the openings in the chambers are not at the bottom, but slightly to the side.

The first of the new instruments to be used in the field was put in adjustment at Washington and sent by express to a point in Kentucky. The observer there, on beginning work with it, found it still in adjustment and continued to use it for one and one-half months, during which time the angle between the tangent to level vial at its middle point and the line of sight ddined by the three horizontal lines never exceeded 3". At the end of that time the angle suddenly became 9" and the instrument was a~ljusted. After constant use for nearly one and one-half months more the record showed the greatest value of this angle to be 3".6. The mean algebraic value of the angle during this time was a little more than 1 ". This behavior in the matter of holding adjustment has been frequently approached in later work with instruments of this type. The constancy with which these instruments retain their adjustment testifies to the fine work put upon them. for which credit is due to Mr. C. Jacomini and 0. Storm, instrument makers. ·
THH LJ<:V!U,-RBADING DEVICB.

The operation of reading the position of three fine lines, the spider threads, projected upon the graduation of the level rod, is a trying one under the best conditions, and subjects the observer, when the air is hazy or unsteady, to severe strains. As it is of the highest importance that these readings be taken only at the instant when the level indicates horizontality of the line of sight, the instrument should be designed particularly with a view to the observer's comfort, so as to enable him to observe the rod and the ,level as nearly as possible simultaneously. It is thought that the levelreading device provided for these instruments fulfills all requirements, since only the time required for transferring mental attention from one object to another need elapse between the two observations. It is a modification of that used by Berthelemy, of Paris, in his precise level,* which consists of two adjustable prisms mounted upon the stride level and three prisms mounted in a casing fastened to the wye support of the telescope, with a short tube immediately on the side of the latter reaching as far as the eyepiece. Besides the objectionable feature of the overloaded. stride level, the design has the fault of requiring the observer to shift his head between observations upon the rod and the level. The modified form here described was applied in the spring of 1899, when precise levels Nos. I, 5, and 6 were remodeled, and it was amply tested in the field during the season of that year. In designing an entirely new instrument it was possible to improve greatly upon the manner of its application. Two clamp rings g, fig. 3, · support an aluminum tube with an eye end reaching back to a point even with the eyepiece of the telescope when focused for an average distance. Against this tube is screwed a dovetail bar h, (illustrations 6 and 7) upon which move, within the tube, two slides i, and}, carrying the prisms k, and l,. These slides are connected by arms with a lever mounted upon a stem with a milled head m,, the rotatioti of which moves the prisms equally toward or away from a central point between them. This motion is provided to adjust the distance of the prisms accurately "to the length of the bubble, which, during the day's work, may vary by reason of temperature changes. Those faces of the prisms which are directed toward the eye are ground to such curvatures
*See page 423 and illustration opposite, in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1899, Precise Leveling in the United States.

as, with the aid of a lens mounted between them and the eye end, to reduce to that of distinct vision of the normal eye the distance from the end of the bubble to the eye, by way of the mirror w, the reflecting faces of the prisms k, and / and the lens. For the benefit of the observer required to use glasses the eye cap of the level-reading tube is arranged to hold such a lens as he may require to enable him to observe without spectacles.

The distance between the level-reading tube and the telescope can be changed to suit each individual observer, and provision is made for the rotary adjustment of the prisms and the mirror necessary in consequence of any such change, as can be seen in fig. 3.

The lines forming the graduation upon the level \~ial are marked by small dots in such manner that symmetrical lines, or lines equidistant from the center of the graduation, are readily distinguishable, thus relieving the observer of any strain in guarding against mistakes.

The telescope throughout its length-with the exception of the eye end of the draw tube and the two collars turned to equal diameters-the supporting cylinder, and the level tube were covered with a heavy coating of cloth dust of a bluish-gray color. This coating is put on by painting the parts with a mixture of Japan varnish, turpentine, and

linseed oil, which is colored with white lead, lampblack, and ultramarine blue, to the same shade as that of the cloth dust; the latter is sifted over the freshly varnished pieces through a hair screen and pressed in with the hand. After allowing it to dry for two days and brushing off all loose cloth dust, a coating of a dilute solution of bleached shellac in alcohol is applied. The finish has the appearance of a fine quality of cloth, and affords considerable protection against sudden and temporary changes of temperature. Other parts of the instrument, as the instrument base, mirror frame, level-reading tube, etc., are finished in black enamel of the kind introduced so extensively through the bicycle industry. It is heavy, hard though elastic, and surpasses in appearance and durability any of the black lacquers heretofore used in the art of instrument making. The weight of the instrument is 5k".2. :N"o doubt this can be considerably reduced when tubing made of nickel steel is obtainable in the market. The thickness of the cast tubing-about twice as great as would be necessary if wrought metal could be substituted-is considered as small as is safe to use in view of the loose texture of the alloy. The weight of the tripod, 7k".2, is somewhat greater than that of stands formerly used for the same class of instruments. This is due to the much greater length required in order to enable the observer to stand erect, which is considered of sufficient advantage to warrant a small sacrifice in the matter of weight.
RODS AND ROD SUPPORTS.

The rods and footplates need not be described in detail here, as they are the same that were formerly in use and have already been described.* The only important change made with reference to rod supports has been that hardened steel pins having a broad head carrying a spherical cavity similar to that in the old footplates have been put into use, t and have steadily gained in favor. During the season just ended the footplates were used but little by Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling parties. The cross section of one of these pins is shown in illustration 8. Some of the first pins were made of tool steel and turned down to shape. The more recent ones were made of machinery steel and tool steel, as indicated in the illustration. The pins are driven with a wooden mallet.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRECISE LEVELING.

The general instructions issued to the levelinp- parties in 1902 are given below. Those issued in 1900 and 1go1 differ from these only in minor matters and in not being so complete. In order that the reader may comprehend fully the spirit of the general instruc·· tions shown below, it may be well to call special attention here to three main points in regard to the new instrument: First. The instrument is irreversible and as simple as possible. The telescope is supported directly on trunnions between the objective and the middle of the telescope and on the point of a micrometer screw near the eye end. It is therefore not capable

This makes it necessary to test the adjustment by a modification of the well-known peg method, as indicated later in the instructions.

A device for reading the bubble has been supplied which enables the observer to stand erect at all times and see the bubble and the rod alternately in quick succession without moving the eye and without even refocusing the eyes, the only change required being a mere shifting of the attention from one eye to the other. Third. Great care has been taken in all the features in the design of the instrument to prevent errors in observation due to changes in the relative temperature of different parts of the instrument.
GBNF.RAI, INSTRUCTIONS FOR PRF.CISI· LF.VIU,ING.

1. Except when specific instructions are given to proceed otherwise, all lines are to be leveled independently in both the forward and the backward direction. 2. The distance between successive bench marks shall nowhere exceed 15 kilometers. The line of levels is to be broken up by temporary bench marks into sections from I to 2 kilometers long, except where special conditions make shorter sections advisable. 3. It is desirable that the backward measurement on each section should be made under different atmospheric conditions from those wliich occurred on the forward measurement. It is especially desirable to make the backward measurement in the afternoon if the forward measurement was made in the forenoon, and vice versa. The observer is to secure as much ditference of conditions between the forward and backward measurements as is possible without materially delaying the work for that purpose. 4. On all sections upon which the forward and backward measures differ by more than 4mm.ovk (in which K is the distance leveled between adjacent bench marks in kilometers), both the forward and backward measures are to be repeated until two such measures fall within the limit". 5. If any measure over a section gives a result differing by more than 6 millimeters from the mean of all the measures over that section, this measure shall be rejected. Ko rejection shall be made on account of a residual smaller than 6 millimeters, unless there is some other good reason for suspecting an error in this particular measure, and in such cases the reason for rejection must be fully stated in the record. 6. Whenever a blunder, such as a misreading of r decimeter or of r meter, or an interchange of sights (the backsight being recorded as a foresight) is discovered in any measure after its completion, and the necessary correction applied, such measure may be retained, provided there are at least two other measures over the same section which are not subject to any such uncertainty. 7. 'I'he programme of observation at each station is to be as follows: Set up and level the instrument. Read the three lii1es of the diapl~ragm as seen projected against, the front (or rear) rod, each reading being taken to the nearest millimeter (estimated), and bubble being held continuously in the middle of the tube (i. e., both ends reading the same). As soon as possible thereafter read the three lines of the

214

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, r903.

diaphragm, as seen projected against the rear (or front) rod, estimating to millimeters as before, and holding the bubble continuously in the middle of the tube. 8. At each rod station the rod thermometer is to be read to the nearest centigrade degree and the temperature recorded. 9. At stations of odd numbers the backsight is to be taken before the foresight, and at even stations the foresight is to be taken before the backsight. IO. Tlre maximum difference in length between a foresight and the corresponding backsight is to be 10 meters. The actual difference is to be made as small on each pair of sights as is feasible by the use of good judgment, without any expenditure of time for this particular purpose. r 1. The recorder shall keep a record of the rod intervals subtended by the.extreme lines of the diaphragm on each backsight, together with their continuous sum between bench marks. A similar record shall be kept for the foresights. The two continuous sums shall be kept as nearly equal as is fea:>ible, without the expenditure of extra time for that purpose, by setting the instrument beyond (or short of) the middle point between the back and front rods. The two continuous sums shall not be allowed to differ by more than a quantity corresponding to a distance of 20 meters. 12. Once during each day of observation the error of the level should be determined in the regular course of the leveling and recorded in a separate opening of the record book, as follows: The ordinary observations at an instrument station being completed, transcribe the last foresight reading as part of the error determination, call up the back rod and have it placed about ro meters back of the instrument, read the rod, move the instrument to a position about IO meters behind the front rod, read the front rod, and then the back rod. The rod readings must be taken with the bubble in the midclle of its tube. The required constant C to be determined, namely, the ratio of the required correction to any rod reading to the corresponding subtended interval, is C __(sum of n_ear rod readings) - (sum of distant rod_ reac!~ngs) - (sum of distant rod intervals)-(smn of near rod intervals)' The level should not be adjusted if C is less than 0.005. If C is between 0.005 and the obsen"er is advised not to adjust the level, but if C exceeds 0.010 the adjustment must be made. If a new adjustment of the level is made, ·c should at once be redetermined. It is desirable to have the determinations of le\·el error made under the ordinary conditions as to length of sight, character of ground, elevation of line of sight above the ground, etc. 13. Notes for future use in studying leveling errors shall be inserted in the record; indicating the time of beginning and ending of the work for each section, the weather conditions especially as to cloudiness and wind, and whether each section of the line is nm toward or away. from the sun; and such other notes as may be of value in studying errors. q. The instrument shall be shaded from the direct rays of the sun, both during the observations and the movement from station to station. 15. The maximum length of sight shall be 150 meters, and the maximum is to be attained only under the most favorable circumstances. 16. At the beginning and end of the season, and at least twice each month during the progress of the leveling, the three-meter interval between metallic pl11gs on the

face of each level rod shall be measured carefully with a steel tape, which shall be continuously kept in the party throughout the season for that purpose. The rod temperature at the time of each of these measures must be recorded. The purpose of these measures is to detect ~hanges in the lengths of the rods rather than to determine the absolute lengths. 'fhe absolute lengths are determined at the Office between field seasons. 17. The field computations and abstracts are to be kept up as the work progresses. As soon as each book of original record is out of use it is to be sent to the Office by registered mail, and the corresponding abstracts are to be retained in the field until the observer is informed of the receipt of the original record. No duplicates of the original record are to be made, except of the descriptions of bench marks, of which the duplicate is to be kept in a separate volume. It should be added, in justice to the observers, that in verbal discussions of the manner in which precise leveling should be done they were urged to keep the length of sight great enough to make it necessary to do a moderate amount of re-running. The accidental errors seem to increase rapidly as the length of sight is increased, under given conditions, beyond that at which the apparent vibration of the graduation on the rod becomes sufficient to make accurate estimation to millimeters difficult. If an observer is extremely cautious and confines all his observations to sufficiently short sights to insure easy reading of the rod, it is possible to work month after month almost without re-running, but th~ progress will be slow. On the other hand, it is certain that an attempt to take sights of the limiting length, 150 meters, at all times would lead to a very large amount of re-running and the progress would not be rapid. The writer's opinion, frequently expressed to the observers, is that the maximum speed consistent with the required degree of accuracy will be secured by continually keeping the length of sight such that the percentage of re-running will be from 5 to 15, and that an extremely small percentage of re-running is sufficient evidence of excess of caution on the part of the observer. The occurrence of a moderate amount of re-running on each line is due, therefore, to an attempt on the part of the observer to attain the maximum speed consistent with the required degree of accuracy, and not to inability to secure such observations that little or no re-running would be necessary. The observers have found a convenient rule in fixing the length of sight to be to shorten sights whenever the upper and lower thread intervals subtended on the rod are found to differ frequently by more than a selected limit. Each observer fixes the limit from his own experience by noting the relation between such a provisional limit and the amount of re-running found to be necessary while using it. Such a rule is based upon the idea that the additional errors which are encountered when the length of sight is increased are in the main those due to increased accidental errors in reading the rods. It should also be noted that although there is no limit placed in the instructions on the rate of divergence between forward and backward lines, the writer has urged the observers to watch the rate of such divergence continually, and to make an effort to keep it small. It has been the opinion of the writer, and many of the observers, that a large steady rate of divergence is in general due to a systematic rising or settling of rod supports, either foot plates or pins. This opinion has been frequently expressed to all the observers. The usual practice has been for the observer, when he noticed a steady tendency for his lines to diverge rapidly, to study the manner in which the foot plates or

216

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

pins were handled, and to make tentative clianges u'ntil the tendency to rapid divergence disappeared. Sometimes the change from foot plates to pins produced the desired effect, or from placing the rod supports between the railroad rails to placing them at the edge of the ballast, or even out on the undisturbed ground beyond the ballast. In one case it was found that as soon as a certain rodman was relieved and another put in his place the tendency to divergence promptly disappeared. For observations with the present methods and instrument the writer has been unable to find any explanation of a steady divergence between forward and backward lines which is quantitatively sufficient, except that indicated above, based upon the supposition that foot plates or pins have a systematic tendency to rise or settle, according to the manner in which they are handled and the character of the ground on which they are placed. The writer has noted that of the ohseP:ers who have come under his observation those who have acted upon this theory most consistently have had the greatest success in preventing rapid divergence.

Only the distant rod readings need be corrected for curvature and refraction, and the two corrections for the two distant rods may be combined as indicated. Note that if the transfers of figures across from page to page are made as indicated all subtractions arc made right side up~ Do not carry C to more than three decimal places. \Vhen the instrument must be adjusted, due to too large a value for C, do it by raising or lowering one end of the level vial and 1101 by moving tlze 1·ct1c!e. The adjustment is made as follows: Point to a distant rocl with the bubble in the middle of its tube, and read. l\love the telescope so as to raise the middle line hy an amount equal to C times the rod interval. \Vhile holding the telescope in this position bring the bubble to the middle of the tube by raising or lowering one end of the level vial. If C is negative the middle line must of course be lowered on the rod.

The following examples of the record and computation will serve to explain the method of observation still further:

The explanation of the symbols used after the words ''Sun'' and ''Wind'' is printed on the bottom of the computation form shown later. The unit in the record is the millimeter. The instrument stations (not turning points) are numbered consecutively throughout the day. A rod once placed at a point stays there, both for the foresight and backsight, each rodman thus being front and rear rodman alternately . . To carry out the requirement of the general directions, that at stations of odd numbers the backsight is to be taken before the foresight, and at even stations the foresight is to be taken first, it is only necessary to remember that this is equivalent to the statement that one particular rodman must always show his rod first after each placing of the instrument. The position of the rod is indicated in the record on the foresight only. The temperature is read by the rear rodman just before he moves forward, and is called out to the recorder when the rodman passes. The columns headed ''Thread interval'' show the intervals between the lower and middle threads as seen projected on the rod, and the middle and the upper, and finally the total interval. The columns headed ''Sum of intervals'' show the continuous sum of the total intervals, and as these values are proportional to the sums of the backsight distances and foresight distances, respectively, they enable the observer to keep these two sums nearly equal at all times, as required by the instructions, for the purpose of eliminating instrumental errors. Such portions of the computation as are shown as forming a part of the record are kept .up by the recorder as the work progresses. The instrument is not moved forward from any station until the recorder announces that the readings at that station check properly. The recorder uses, as a short method of computing the mean of the three thread readings, the fact that the difference of the upper and lower intervals divided by

2r8

COAS'f AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

three is the correction to be applied with the proper sign to the middle thread reading to give the mean of the three. But little explanation is needed in connection with the computation form shown below. The forward line from B. M. 68 to B. M. G. on this form is that for which the record is given. The fifth column on the left-hand page is derived from the fourth by using the sufficiently exact relation that 287 millimeters subtended on the rod corresponds to 100 meters along the line, regardless of the lengths· of the separate sights. The corrections for curvature and refraction shown in the first column of the right-hand page are those due to the slight differences of corresponding foresights and backsights, no correction being necessary when the corresponding sights are exactly equal. The correction is usually inappreciable and seldom exceeds o. r millimeter under actual conditions. It may be applied very quickly by the use of properly prepared tables and a rapid inspection of the record books. It is important to note that this is in the main a correction for curvature, a quantity which is not uncertain, the uncertain refraction being upon an average about one-eighth as great as the curvature. The level correction shown in the second column of the right-hand page is equal to the constant C (defined in the general directions for leveling) times the value in the sixth column of the left-hand page. Its sign is fixed by the signs of the two factors. This correction will very seldom exceed o. 3 millimeter under actual conditions, and will not sensibly differ from zero on most sections, since the instructions require (paragraph 1 I) that the smn of the foresight rod intervals on any section shall be nearly equal to the sum of the backsight rod intervals. The third column gives the correction due to the excess of length of the rod at zero degrees, this particular rod being o. 28 millimeter too long on each meter. The examinations of the rods made at the Office show that the error of graduation is. with sufficient accuracy, proportional to the distance along the rod. The next column gives the correction due to the expansion of the rod from zero to the temperature of observation, computed with the known coefficient of expansion of the rods, namely, 0.000004 per degree Centigrade. The sum of the quantities in the third and fourth columns in any line gh·es the correction due to the excess of length of the rod at the temperature of observation. For these particular rods, which are long, even at zero, the correction in each of these columns will always have the same sign as the measured difference of elevation. The last four columns on this form are for use whenever special studies are to be made to determine if possible the sources of the principal errors of leveling. It should be noted that the times of the backward and forward runnings of any section, as indicated in the last column, have no fixed relation to each other4 The two runnings are sometimes made on the same clay, sometimes on different days, and in some instances they both occur in the forenoon, at other times both in the afternoon, and frequently they occur in opposite halves of the day. Any long portion of the line will show corresponding forward and backward measurements having all possible relations to each other as to the time of day. In the comparatively rare cases in which it is necessary to apply an index correCtion, to take account of the fact that the zero of graduation and the foot of the rod are not exactly coincident, it should be entered in the second column of the right-hand page of the computation, no separate column having been provided for it.

CORRECTION TABLES.

For convenience there are inserted here three tables which are useful in making the foregoing computations. The table of total correction for curvature and refraction is for use in computing C, in making river crossings, and in general wherever the total correction is required. In computing this .table the refraction was assumed to be equal to one-eighth the curvature.

The table for the differential correction for curvature and refraction is for use in deriving the corrections shown in the first column of the right-hand page of the com-

putation indicated on page 219. The table was computed upon the assumption that the refraction is one-eighth of the curvature, and that the stadia interval for the instrument is such that the distance from the instrument to the rod in meters is one-third of the interva_l subtended on the rod in millimeters. An inspection of the table will show that it is sufficiently accurate for use even though the stadia interval differs from that stated by 10 per cent or more.

APPENDIX NO. 3.

PRECISE LEVELING IK THE UNITED STATES.

223

STATISTICS OF NEW COAST A:N"D GEODETIC SCRVEY I.EVE!, UNES.

The principal items of information in regard to the Coast and Geodetic Survey level lines are given in table;; below, which have been arranged in such a manner as to be conduci\·e to comparisons between the lines. The details in regard to the lines will be given later. Instruments Nos. 7, 8, and 9 are of the new type; instruments Nos. l and 6 are the modified instruments which were the immediate predecessors of the new type, and which involve many of the es.<>ential features of the new instruments. The method of observing was substantially the same with these instruments as with the new instruments. For a description of these instruments and the method of observing used with them, see Appendices 5, 6, and 7 of the Report for 1899. The rods used in the leveling of 1900-1903 are all alike and are of the type referred to on page 2 l l. The number of permanent bench marks includes all with which the leveling was directly connected, regardless of whether they are new bench marks or bench marks previously established by some other party or organization. The average distance between bench marks was obtained by dividing the total length of the main line by the number of bench marks. The speed has been obtained by dividing the total length of the lines run by the interval in months from the date of the first leveling to the date of the last, inclusiYe. The divergence in millimeters per kilometer was obtained by dividing the total divergence on the main line by the length of the main line in kilometers. The probable error of the mean result for a section was computed by the formula r"=o.674

J -4--s

~d·

in which d is the discrepancy between the forward and backward leveling over a section, and s the number of sections. The probable error for l kilometer, r,, was derived by assuming that the average length of a section is to l kilometer as (r")' is to r,·.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.
CINCINNATI-SOMERSET LINE.

This line of levels was run by Assistant 0. W. Ferguson, between June 6 and August 31, 1900. Level No. 1, one of the modified levels which immediately preceded the present type of level, ·was used up. to July 23, after which level No. 7, one of the new type, was used to the end of the season. This line forms the first section of.the line from Cincinnati to Birmingham, the purpose of which was to strengthen the southeastern portion of the level net. It connected with the triangulation of the eastern oblique arc and with the thousand-mile loop of precise leveling in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia by the U. S. Geological Sunrey, and entered the large area in the southeastern group of States in which there was no precise leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The line runs over the Queen and Crescent road, as indicated in the illustration opposite. It starts from bench marks Y 4 , Z4 and A 5 , in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Ludlow, Ky., which had been fixed by the leveling from Gibraltar to Cincinnati in 1899. It connects at Somerset, Ky., with the next section of the line which was run by Aid W. H. Burger in 1900. The velocipede cars were not used during this leveling. Rods T and U were used by Assistant Ferguson and rods V and W by Aid W. H. Burger on the lines between Cincinnati and Birn1ingham throughout the season of 1900. The index corrections of the rods T and U at the close of the season of 1899 were -0.3 millimeter for'T and -0.4 millimeter for U, the zero of the graduation being below the bottom of the rod. At the end of the season of 1900 these rods eacl1 had a correction of -o. 5 millimeter. The average correction for rod T was therefore -0.4 millimeter and for rod U -0.45 millimeter. Thus the correction for index error is practically zero and was not applied except in the cases where a reading was taken on a bench mark without the use of the rod. In these cases a correction of 0.4 millim~ter was applied in such a way as to affect only the height of the one bench mark. Another reason for not applying these very small corrections is that they are largely compensating in character and would change the final elevations very little. No separate column is provided for the index correction on the computation form shown on page 219, as it seldom needs to be applied. When it must be applied it should be entered in the second column of the right-hand page of the computation. The index correction for rod V at the beginning of the season was zero and at the end of the season was -o. I millimeter, with an average of -0.05 millimeter. For rod W the same values respectively were zero and -0.2 millimeter, with an average of -o. i millimeter. As these corrections were very small they were not applied at all in the office revision of the work. While in the field the rods were measured by means of a steel tape, graduated to millimeters, used direct and reversed, and read with the aid of a pocket reading glass. The temperature of the rod thermometer was always noted in connection with these measures. Care was taken that the rods and tape should be at the temperature of the atmosphere so that reliable comparisons could be made. These measurements were made in order to detect, if possible, any change in the length of the rods during the season. The results of these measures are given in the accompanying table. The part of the rod measured was between the fine lines on the silve.r plugs at the first and thirty-

The values given in the table are relative only, as the correction to the tape was not applied. As far as rods T and U are concerned no change in length is noticed, the measurements at no time differing by more than 0.2 millimeter from the mean, with 0.4 millimeter as a maximum range. Rods V and W show apparently a very decided change in length, a maximum range of 0.9 millimeter in the former and r.3 millimeters in the latter. Furthermore, the change seems to have been a gradual change throughout the season, the rods becoming longer. At the periods August 22 and November 22, there appear slight jumps in the series. These two breaks divide the total series into three parts and for computation purposes, namely, correction for length of rod, a corresponding division was made. The total absolute changes in the lengths of the rods, as indicated by the measurements in the Office of Standard Weights and Measures before and after the season of leveling, are shown in the following table. The coefficient of expansion used in the reduction to o° C. was 0.000004 per Centigrade degree.

Rod T shows a shortening of o. l 43 millimeter and rod U of o. l l 7 millimeter between December 22, 1899, and January 21, 1901. This shortening is very slight. In making the corrections for length of rod a mean value for the two rods of 3.001324 was taken. Therefore the correction applied was 0.441 millimeter per meter of difference of elevation and numerically increased the difference of elevation between bench marks in every case. Both rods V and W show an increase in absolute length by the measurements of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, a confirmation of the results of measurements by tape in the field; and as these field measurements seemed to show the change· to have been gradual, with but the two above-mentioned breaks, it was decided to use for computation purposes a mean of the June values for the period up to the first break in the series, or from July 23 to September l, to use a mean of the January values for the period from November 20 to January 9, and a mean of the two means for the middle period. These values are, respectively, 3.000854, 3.001762, and 3.001308. Expressed as corrections for length of rod, they are +0.285, +0.587, and +0.436 J millimeter per meter of difference of elevation between bench marks. This slight increase in the length of rods V and W during their first season of use is in acc<;>rdance with previous experience with paraffined rods on this Survey. The general tendency is for the rods to increase slightly in length during the first season and to preser\re nearly a constant length thereafter.

SOMERSET-KNOXVILLE LINE.

This line was run by Aid W. H. Burger between July 23 and November 3, 1900, using instrument No. 8, one of the new type. The portion Somerset to Harriman Junction, of this line, is the second section of the line from Cincinnati to Birmingham, of which the purpose is indicated under the heading '' Cincinnati-Somerset Line.'' 1'he portion from Harriman Junction to Knoxville was run for the purpose of connecting with the Geological Survey 19op in the vicinity of Knoxville. The route of the levels is over the Queen and Crescent to Harriman Junction, and thence over the South~rn Railroad to Knoxville, as indicated on illustration 9, page 227. A side line about 20 kilometers long was run from the vicinity of Elverton, Tenn., to Melton triangulation station for the purpose of controlling the elevations determined by measurements of vertical angles along the eastern oblique arc triangulation. This side line was run over ordinary roads and across country, and some very steep grades were encountered. The velocipede cars were not used on any portion of the line from Somerset to Knoxville. The lengths and index corrections of rods V and W, used on this line, have already been given on pages 229, in connection with the line Cincinnati to Somerset.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

The line from Cincinnati to Birmingham ran through very mountainous sections of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama, over railroads with many high trestles, heavy grades, and sharp curves. An interesting feature of the work was the fact that of the 28 tunnels encountered on the line, 24 of them were in the section of 98 miles from Somerset to Harriman Junction. In general, the topography of the surrounding country was such as to render it impracticable to carry the levels around, and so the line was run through all tunnels but one, this one being considered too dangerous to permit working through it. The problem of illuminating the rods in the tunnels, many of which were long and dark, gave the observers some trouble. Several methods were tried, such as lighting by lamps, candles, and lanterns, but the best results were obtained by using an acetylene bicycle lamp. On clear days, and when the form of the tunnel permitted this, very satisfactory results were had by placing a mirror at the end of the tunnel and throwing a beam of sunlight upon the rod. With the latter method the rods could be accurately read at a distance of 120 meters. The elevations given in the tabulation which follows are in continuation of those shown in the Cincinnati-Somerset line, and are therefore based upon the elevations printed in Appendix 8 of 1899 for bench marks A 6 and Z,, in the vicinity of Cincinnati. The two short side lines, IO kilometers each, at the end of the tabulation, viz, from Knoxville to Caswell and from Knoxville to Wright, were nm for the purpose of securing checks on the connection at Knoxville with the Geological Survey line.

HARRIMAN

JUNCTIO~-WOODVILLE

J.INE.

This line, which forms the third section of the line from Cincinnati to Birmingham, the purpose of which is explained on page 2;:z6, was run by Assistant 0. W. Ferguson between September 4 and December 3, 1900, using level No. 7, one of the new type. The leveling followed the Queen and Crescent Railroad from Harriman Junction to Chattanooga, and thence over the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis and Southern railroads to Woodville, Ala. (See illustration 9, p. 227.) A side line from Woodville to Gunter triangulation station, about 15 kilometers long, shown at the end of the tabulation, was run to control the elevations determined by measurements of vertical angles along the triangulation of the eastern oblique arc. Velocipede cars were not used on any portion of this leveling. w The lengths and index corrections of rods T and U used on this line have already been given on page 226 in connection with the line Cincinnati to Somerset. The elevations in the following tabulation are based upon the elevations of A 2 , B2 , and C 2 at Harriman Junction, as determined by Mr. Burger on the Somerset-Knoxville line, and therefore depend upon the elevations published in Appendix 8 for bench marks in the vicinity of Cincinnati.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903·
WOODVILLE-BIRMINGHAM LINE.

The line forming the last section of the line Cincinnati-Birmingham, of which the purpose is explained on page 226, was run by Aid W. H. Burger between November 7, 1900, and January 9, 1901, using level No. 8, one of the new type. The line followed the Southern Railroad from \Vooddlle to Decatur and the Louisville and Nashville from Decatl.lr to Birmingham. (See illustration 9, page 227.) It is connected at Decatur with the line Corinth-Decatur, run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in 1895, and at Birmingham with the line Meridian-York-Birmingham, run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in 1897-98. Both of these lines have already been published.* The lengths and index corrections of rods V and W, used on this line, have already been given on pp. 229 in connection with the line Cincinnati to Somerset. The elevations in the following tabulation are based upon those determined at Woodville by the prececfing sections of the Cincinnati-Birmingham line, and therefore depend upon the elevations published in Appendix 8, Report for 1899, for bench marks in the vicinity of Cincinnati.

These field measurements are made merely to determine whether the rods change in length. .They are not directly comparable with the Office measures, made with great care to determine the absolute lengths. These measurements show that the rods retained so nearly a constant length throughout the season that it was decided to use the mean of the rod lengths, as measured at the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, in making the computation, the correction for length being therefore omm.45 per meter. The index corrections to the rods in November, 1899, were: For R., o.o millimeter; for S, -0.2 millimeter; and in January, 1901, for R 2 , -0.2 millimeter; for S, - o.6 millimeter. The elevations given in the tabulation are based upon those printed in Appendix 8, Report for 1899, for the bench marks N ,, 0 ,, aud P, at Norfolk, of the line AbileneNorfolk, run by A. L. Baldwin' and B. E. Tilton in 1899. (See Appendix 6, Report for 1899.) The line connects at Sioux City with bench marks established on the line St. Joseph-Sioux City, which was .run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in
1892.

The elevations in the tabulation for stations marked thus: (Sta.·Norfolk), refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.
NORFOLK-PAG~

257

LINE.

This line was run by Aid B. E. Tilton between June 22 and July 27, 1900, using instrument No. 6, one .of the intermediate type. The purpose of this line was to connect the Page Base with the precise level net and ultimately to form a part of the great circuit Abilene, Kans.-Norfolk, Nebr.-Page, Nebr.-Chadron, Nebr.-Orin Junction, Wyo.-Cheyenne, Wyo.-Denver, Colo.-Abilene, Kans. The leveling followed the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railway from Norfolk to Plai1i\riew, and the Pacific Short Line to Page. Velocipede cars were used between Plainview and Page, but not between Norfolk and Plainview. The necessary information as to the index corrections and length of rods is given in the account of the preceding line, NorfolkSioux City. The elevations given in the following tabulation are based upon those printed for bench marks 0 1 and P 1 at Norfolk in Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus, (Sta. Hadar), refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.
SOLOJ\10N-ANTHONY LINE.

This line was run by Aid B. E. Tilton between July 31 and October 12, 1900, using level No. 6, one of the intermediate type. The primary purpose of this line was to connect the Anthony Base with the precise level net and to control the elevations determined by the measurement of vertical angles along the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. Connections were made with the triangulation stations Kingman and Pretty Prairie. The line forms a part of the great circuit Abilene, Kans.-Anthony, Kans.-Bowie, Tex.-Shreveport, La.-Monroe, La.-Little Rock, Ark.-Harrisonville, Mo.-Holliday, Kans.-Abilene, Kans. The leveling followed the Union Pacific RailNo.

PAGE-CHADRON LINE.

This line was run by 0. E. Carr, Observer, and Aid G. E. Selby between July 13 and November 23, 19or. Level No. 8, one of the new type, was used, except for a few days during which it was sent to the Office at Washington, and new lines were placed in its diaphragm, the old ones having been accidentally broken. Level No. 6, one of the intermediate type, was used during these few days. This line forms a part of the

great circuit already named in connection with the line Norfolk-Page, of which the principal points are Norfolk, Orin Junction, Denver, Abilene, and Norfolk, and which will serve to carry completely checked elevations, depending upon the best grade of leveling as far west as Orin Junction, Cheyenne, and Denver. The leveling follow'ed the line of the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, and velocipede cars were used over the whole line.

1902.

The office measurements of the rods indicated that rod V shortened 0.38 millimeter, and rod W 0.33 millimeter, on the 3-meter interval, or an average of one-eighth milli~ meter per meter. The field measurements of the rods show a confused indication of this change. As the field measurements do not give sufficiently clear indication to decide upon the time of shortening, or whether it occurred slowly or suddenly, it was decided to use the mean of the four determinations of the rod lengths in computing the elevations, viz, an excess of length of 0.53 millimeter per meter. If the length of the rods in the interval between the two office determinations of their length never varied outside the range given by the two office measurements, the mean length used in the computation must have been correct at all times during the field season within one-sixteenth millimeter per meter. As the total range of elevation encountered during the season was from 600 to I I So meters (viz, 580 meters), the uncertainty in the elevations due to rod length is probably muc:h less than 36 millimeters, this being the correction at the rate of one-sixteenth millimeter per meter on 580 meters. As it is probable that the rod changed in length gradually during the season, the uncertainty in the elevations is much less than 36 millimeters. The index corrections to the rods at the beginning of the season were, for rod V, -0.1 millimeter, and for rod W, -0.2 millimeter; in January, 1902, for rod V, -0.2 millimeter, and for rod W, -0.2 millimeter.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903·

The elevations given in the tabulations are based upon those given by the line Norfolk-Page, which in turn are based upon the elevations for bench marks 0 1 and PP at Norfolk, as printed in Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus (Sta. Page) refer to the top of the rail in front of the station named.

CHEYENNE-ORIN JUNCTION LINE.

This line of levels was run by Aid \V. C. Dibrell, between July 31 and October 15, 1901, with level No. 7, one of the new type. This line forms a part of the great circuit already named in connection with tbe line NorfolkNo. 13. Page, and of which the principal points are Norfolk, Orin Junction, Denver, Abilene, and Norfolk. The line follows the Colorado and Southern Railroad. Velocipede cars were used over the whole line. The party lived in tents, but secured their meals elsewhere. Rods R. and S were used until August 21. On that date rod T was substituted for rod S, the graduation upon rod S having become indistinct. The lengths of the rods ~t o° C. before and after leveling, as determined at the Office of Standard Weights and Measures, were as follows:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

The office measurements of the rods show but slight changes in lengths. The field measurements show no variations except those which may be accounted for as errors of measurement, with the possible exception of the measurement of rod T on August 22. This measurement was apparently subject to some large error.· The evidence as a whole, therefore, indicates that the rods held a constant length with sufficient accuracy throughout the season. In making the computation the mean of the four measurements of R, and S was used up to and including August 21, viz, 3rn+ Imm. 15, or 0.38 millimeter excess of length per meter. During the remainder of the field season the mean of the four measures of R, and T, 3m+ 1 mm. I I, an excess of length of 0.37 millimeter per meter, was used. This latter correction was also used in computing the line Decatur-Corinth, run immediately after the completion of the line CheyenneOrin Junction. The index corrections to the rods in January, 1901, were: For rod R,, -0.2 millimeter; for rod T, --0.5 millimeter; for rod S, -o.6 millimeter; and in January, 1902, for rod R,, -0.2 millimeter; for rod S, -o.6 millimeter, and for rod T, -o.6 millimeter. The elevations given in the following tabulation are based upon those printed for bench marks B and E at Cheyenne, in Appendix 8 of i899. The elevations given in the tabulations for stations marked thus: (Sta. Silver Crown) refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

DECATUR-CORINTH J.INE.

This line was run by Aid W. C. Dibrell between October 24 and December 9, 1901, using level No. 7, one of the new type. The purpose of this line was to locate a large error of o. 7 meter or more which it seemed certain must exist somewhere in the leveling in Alabama and Mississippi. An examination of the leveling in that vicinity, after the
No. 14.

I,eveliug route, Decntui-, Aln., to Corinth, Miss.

completion of the line of 1900 from Cincinnati, Ohio, to_ Birmingham, Ala., indicated that an error probably existed in the line Corinth-Decatur, which had been run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers in 1895. The determination to rerun the Corinth-Decatur line was based upon the evidence fumished by this examination, though

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

it was known to have been run originally with great care by an excellent method and with good instruments. The rerunning developed an error of 1 meter near the western encl of the line, as shown in the comparison between the old and new lines following the tabulation of the new line. The new line of levels followed the Southern Railway from Decatur to Corinth. The old line of levels also followed that railroad between Corinth and Tuscumbia, and there are frequent bench marks between these points common to the two lines. The old line, however, from Tuscumbia toward Decatur, followed the railroad to Florence, and from that point ran along the Tennessee River and the Muscle Shoals Canal to Decatur. The old and new lines, therefore, form a circuit, Decatur-Tuscumbia-Florence-Decatur. The agreement between old and new lines is indicated in the table following the tabulation of the results of the new work. The length and index corrections of the rods R, and T, which were used on this line, are given in connection with the preceding line, Cheyenne-Orin Junction. The tabulation is given in two parts, Decatur-Tuscumbia, a double line, and Tuscumbia-Corinth, which is a single line as a rule. All the elevations in the tabulation are based upon that of P. B. M. so, in Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus: (Sta. Decatur) refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

The very close l 24 kilometers over the new line, the difference, 1901-1895, being over this whole distance always within 9 millimeters of 0.3160, indicates both level lines to have been of an extremely high degree of accuracy. In view of the abrupt change in the difference, 1901-1895, between Iuka and Burnsville, of almost exactly an even meter, and of the fact that an error of that sign and approximately that magnitude had been indicated by external eviG.ence before the line of 1901 was run, there seems to be no good reason to doubt that an error of one meter was made in the older work. In the formation of the difference of elevation, Tuscumbia 9-Corinth V, for line 151, page 355, a mean was taken of the two determinations for Tuscumbia 9-Iuka, 3; for Iuka 3-Burnsville r, the Coast Survey line only was used and a mean was taken agaiu for Burnsville 1-Corinth V.

----------------------· agreement of the old and new lines from Decatur to Iuka,

This line was nm by Aid \V. C. Dibrell, between April 16 and June 13, 1902, with levd No. 7, one of the new type of instruments. The line from Dobbs Ferry to Greenbush used in the level net adjustment of 1899 was known to be of an inferior degree of accuracy. In view of the importance of an accurate determination of the elevation of the Greenbush bench mark, as set forth on page 196, it was decided to supersede this line by leveling of as high degree of accuracy as possible. The line follows the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad along the east bank of the Hudson River. It connects at Dobbs Ferry with the old line from Sandy Hook and N'ew York, run in 1886-87 by Subassistant J. E. McGrath and others. At Greenbush it connects with the Gristmill bench mark and therefore with the old Engineer line of levels of 1875 to Oswego; with the two Deep Waterways Board lines to Oswego direct and by way of Lake

At the time the computations were made the rods were still in the field, in use on another line, from Rock Creek to Red Desert, \Vyo. As the above field measures showed that if any change had occurred in the lengths of the rods it must be very small, the lengths measured at the beginning of the

season were used in making the computation; that is, a correction of 0.37 millimeter per meter was applied. This assumption that the rods held a constant length is reasonably safe, since past experience shows that rods ordinarily hold a constant length with considerable accuracy during each season after the first. ~oth of these rods had been· used for many months during preceding seasons. The index corrections of the rods were in January, 1902, for rod R,,--0.2 millimeter, and for rod S, --o.6 millimeter. These index corrections were used throughout the season on both the Dobbs FerryGreenbush line and the Chadron-Orin Junction line. The elevations in the following tabulation are based upon the elevation of bench mark Vat Dobbs Ferry, printed in Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The elevations given in the following tabulation for stations marked thus: (Sta. Ardsley), refer to the top of the rail in front of the railroad station named.

Leveling route, Chadron, Nebr., to Orin Junction, Wyo.

Orin Junction, Denver, Abilene, and Norfolk. The leveling followed the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad. Velocipede cars were used. The heavy grades encountered over a considerable portion of the line made the work of pulling the cars

APPENDIX NO. 3.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

wearisome, but in spite of this the work was done with unusual rapidity, the whole line· being run at the average rate of 98 miles per month. Rods R. and S were used. Their lengths and index corrections are given in the text in connection with the line Dobbs Ferry-Greenbush, which precedes this line. The elevations in the tabulation are based upon the elevation of bench mark C4 at Chadron, as fixed by the Page-Chadron line, and depend therefore upon the elevations printed in Appendix 8, Report for 1899 for bench marks 0, and P, at Norfolk. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus, (Sta. Whitney), refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.
BOWIE-AN'fHONY LINE.

303

This line was run by Aid W. H. Burger between April 3 and July II, 1902, with level No. 8, one of the new type. The line No. 17. forms a part of the circuit Abilene, Kans.nl.lumy, S.E. Ba.s· 4, Fs · Anthony, Kans.-Bowie, Tex.-Shreveport, La.KANSAS Monroe, La.-Little Rock, Ark.-Harrisonville, Mo.-Holliday, Kans.-Abilene, Kans. The line follows the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad from Bowie, Tex., to Medford, Okla., and the Santa Fe Railroad from that point to Anthony, Kans. It is connected with Bowie Northwest Base, near Bellevue, Tex., by a branch line, and with the following triangulation stations along the ninety-eighth meridian by other short branch lines: Duncan, Carson, Elreno East Base, Waukomis, and Enid. The line ends at Anthony Southeast Base, which was also connected with the line Solomon-Anthony, I 900. A The line serves therefore to control the elevations determined by measurements of vertical angles along the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation from Kansas to northern Texas, and to fix the heights of two base lines. Various connections were also made with bench marks which had been established by the United States Geological Survey in Indian Territory and Texas. Velocipede cars were used over the whole j · Ninn.e/uUo. P length of the line and the conditions as to I fzn Ru.&h Sprillg·. TBM95. grades were very favorable. The leveling was j Riuh Sprvtgs. N, 13~9 done with unusual rapidity, 105 miles of line j M 1331 j fta.rlow. L,A3t Sta. being· completed during the .month of June, and j INDIAN the average speed for the whole line being 91 Dun.ca.n.. J. Jl27 miles per month. Rods V and W were used. Their lengths at o° C. in March, 1902, as determined by the · A~ton, 918,£ 883 Addington. National Bureau of Standards, were, for V, 875Boun.J.a,ry 111 3m+ r'"m. 18, and for W, 3m+ 1 m.63. The mean of these is 3111 + Irnn'.40, or an excess of length of 0.47 millimeter per meter. As these rods had already been used in the field as T early as 1900, and therefore were presumably holding a constant length, and as the following measures of the 3-meter interval on Kilometer· the rods showed no variations greater than '° I can be accounted for as errors of observation, :i.evcliug route, Dowie, Tex., to Anthony, Kans. the lengths as determined at the Office at the beginning of the season and given above were used in making the computation.

The index corrections of rods V and\\', as measured in January, 1902, were each o. 2 millimeter. The elevations in the following tabulation are based upon that published for bench mark 1124 Gainv. by the United States Geological Survey (21st Annual Report, pt. 1, p. 485), this being one of their bench marks. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus (Sta. Bowie), refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

BOWIE-SHREVEPORT LINE.

This line was run by W. H. Burger, Aid, between July 14 and November 18, I902, with levels Nos. 8 and 9, both of the new type. The change of instruments was made on account of the breakage in the field of the spider lines in the telescope of looel No. 8. During the last few weeks of the leveling, R. L. Libby, Aid, was with the party preparing to take charge of it, and alternating v.-ith Mr. Burger in observing. This line served to close the circuit Shreveport, La.-Monroe, La.-Little Rock, Ark.Harrisonville, Mo.-Holliday, Kan!'>.-Abilene, Kans.-Bowie, Tex.-Shreveport, La. The line followed the Chicago, Rock Island and Texas Railroad from Bowie to Fort

\Vorth, thence the Texas and Pacific Railroad to Dallas, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad to Shreveport. At Shreveport and Bodcau, La., the line connects with two permanent bench marks established in connection with the leveling by the Unitt,: States Engineers from ~Ionroe and Smithland, La., to Shreveport, La. Velocipede cars were used over nearly the whole length of the line. Many heavy grades were encountered, and during a considerable portion of the time the weather was hot, the thermometers in the rods reading at times as high as 53° C. (127° F.). In spite of these two disadvantages the leveling was done with unusual rapidity, namely. at an average speed of 81 completed miles per month.

Rods V and W were used. The field measures of length showed no appreciable change, and their corrections were assumed to be the same as during the leveling between Bowie and Anthony, Kans. (See p. 303.) The index corrections were also assumed to be unchanged. The elevations in the following tabulation were based upon the assumed value, 342.8141 meters for bench mark l 124 Gainv. at Bowie, that being as close an approximation to the final adjusted elevation of that bench mark as could be made at the time the computation was commenced. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus (Sta. Bowie) refer to the top of the rail in front of the railroad station named.

FORT WORTH-COMANCHE LINE.

This line was run by Ralph L. Libby, Aid, between November 22 and December It is a spttr from the level net. It starts at Fort Worth from bench marks of the Bowie-Shreveport line, and ends at Station Comanche of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, fixing its height, and through trigonometrical leveling the height of the Stephenville base line, which is in sight from Comanche. The line follows the Fort Worth and Rio Grande Railroad. (See illustration 19.) Velocipede cars were used. The rods V and W still showed no change of length, and the same correction for length and for index errors were used as on the BowieAnthony line (seep. 303). In the following tabulation the final elevations obtained from the adjustment of 1903 are given.
18, 1902, with level No. 9, one of the new type.

FORT WORTH-LAMPASAS LINE.

This line was run by Ralph L. Libby, Aid, between December 20, 1902, and March
25, 1903, with level No. 9, one of the
No. , 9 ,

new type. This line starts from bench marks at Fort Worth of the BowieShreveport line and ends at the Lampasas Base of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, of which it fixes the elevation accurately. It also connects with and fixes accurately the elevation of Gilmore triangulation station, near the Lampasas Base. These connections, together with those made by precise levels at Bowie Base, and at Comanche triangulation station near the Stephenville Base, already referred to, serve to fix the elevations of the stations along the ninety-eighth West meridian triangulation from Bowie E1:1.,,Hott Base to Lampasas Base. The line follows the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad from Fort Worth southward to Temple, Tex., and then westward over the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad to Lampasas. Velocipede cars were used. Unfavorable weather delayed the leveling considerably. Rods V and W were used as of the same length as· on the Bowie-Anthony line (seep. 303), the field measures having shown 110 F change. The index errors were asLeveling route, Fort Worth to Holland, 'l'ex. sumed to be the same as on that line. In the following tabulation the elevations as fixed by the adjustment of 1903 are given. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus (Sta. Alvarado) refer to the top of rail in front of the railroad station named.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPOR'f, 1903· TEMPLE-HOLLAND LINE.

This line was run by R. L. Libby, Aid, between March 27 and April 9, 1903, with level No. 9, one of the new type. It is the beginning of a line southward from Temple to control the elevations on the southern portion of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation and to furnish a new connection with sea level at some point on the Texas coast. The line follows the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad. The remarks as to the velocipede cars, weather, and length and index corrections of rods made in connection with the Fort Worth-Lampasas line apply to this line also. In the following tabulation the elevations shown depend on the adjustment of 1903.

ROCK CREEK-RED DESERT Ll:r-..'E.

This line was run by W. C. Dibrell, Aid, between August 11 and October 13, 1902, with level No. 7, one of the new type. It extends the leveling westward from the former western terminus of the precise leveling at Rock Creek, \Vyo., toward the Pacific. It forms a part of the line from Rock Creek via Ogden to Seattle, Wash., at which point a connection with mean sea level will be obtained. The line follows the Union Pacific Railroad, and velocipede cars were used. Very steep and long grades were encountered.

I,cvcling route, Rock Creek to Red Desert, 'Vyo.

Rods R 2 and S were used. Their lengths at o° C., as determined by the National Bureau of Standards, were, in March, 1902, Rii=3"'+omru.86 and S=3m+1"'m.39, and in December, 1902, R 2 =3m+o111 "'.80 and S=3m+rrnm.34 There had evidently been no change in length during the season, and the mean of the four measures, or an excess of length of 0.37 millimeters per meter, was used. The elevations given in the following tabulation are nearly correct. To make them correspond to the 1903 adjustment, -0.0926 meter should be applied to the tabular elevations. The elevations given in the tabulation for stations marked thus (Sta. Aurora) refer to top of rail in front of railroad station named.

MOREHEAD CITY-BRUNSWICK LINE.

The details in regard to this line, run by the United States Geological Survey, may be found in the annual reports of that Survey, Eighteenth Annual, Part r, pages 295301; Nineteenth Annual, pages 247-25 r; Twentieth Annual, pages 370-384, and in the Transactions of the American Society of Civi1 Ei1gineers, Volume XXXIX, June, 1898, pages 366-375. The observing was done by Messrs. W. Carvel Hall and E. L. McNair in 1896-1898. The type of instrument used is illustrated in Appendix 8 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for I 899, page 394, illustration .No. 5, and in the article iu the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers referred to above. The instrument was made by Buff and Berger and is of the type ordinarily known as the Van Orden level. The rods used were nonextensible target rods about 10 feet in length, with a T-shaped cross section, made of pine treated with paraffin. The target readings were taken to thousandths of a foot. The leveling was done by the double simultaneous method continuously in one direction. The micrometer screw was used simply as a quick leveling device, the target being placed in the horizon of the instrument. The method, instrument, and rods used on this line were similar to those used on lines r 38, 140, and 142* in New York and Pennsylvania by the United States Geological Survey.
~-----------·-··-------------

*See Appendix 8, Report for 1899, p. 421.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

The line connected with mean sea level at Morehead City and at Brunswick, and is now connected with recent leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey at Knoxville (see illustration 9). A short line, run by approximately the same method by the United States Geological Survey in I 902 from Cleveland to Chattanooga, Tenn., connected this line a second time at Chattanooga with the Coast and Geodetic Survey line from Cincinnati to Birmingham.
OTHER UNITED STATES GJWLOGICAL SURVEY LINES.

Nine other level lines in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio run with methods and instruments similar to those used on the Morehead City-Brunswick line, were also furnished by the United States Geological Survey for incorporation in the level net. These lines are: Canton to Cleveland, Ohio; Buffalo to Dunkirk, N. Y.; Leboeuf to Irvineton, Pa.; Salamanca, N. Y., to Irvineton, Pa.; Hornellsville to Charlotte, N. Y.; Elmira, N. Y., to Williamsport, Pa.; Utica to Bainbridge, N. Y.; Hancock to Sidney, N. Y., and Hancock to Poughkeepsie, N. Y. The United States Geological Survey also furnished, in manuscript, the results of leveling by the Pittsburg, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, of the Pennsylvania system, from Monaca, Pa., to Lima, Ohio, with a connection with the Canton-Cleveland line of the Geological Survey at Canton. These lines furnish many new circuits and well-determined elevations in the three States named.
BILOXI-FORT ADAMS LINE.

Full particulars in regard to this line, run under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission, may be found in the Chief of Engineers' Report for 1900, part 7, pages 4622-4740. The field work was done under the direction of W. S. Williams in 1897-98 and 1900, the observers being W. S. Williams, E. J. Thomas, and E. L. Harman. Kern levels and rods were used and the methods of observation are the well-known methods which have been used for many years by the Mississippi River Commission, and are known to give results of the highest degree of accuracy. Some minor improvements have been made in these methods in recent years. In the Chief of Engineers' Report for 1899, page 3649, will be found a statement of the present method as improved. This line supersedes the old Coast and Geodetic Survey lines between Biloxi and Carrollton, Carrollton and Smithland, and from Smithland toward Vidalia as far as Fort Adams, and also supersedes the old line run under the direction of the Chief of Engineers between Biloxi and Carrollton. There were good reasons for supposing that the bench marks between Fort Adams and Biloxi had probably settled since the old leveling had been done, the settling being in part due to a probable general movement of the Lower Mississippi delta region. Results of the leveling show that such settling took place. The new line should therefore supersede the old lines, both because of its undoubtedly higher degree of accuracy and because of the settling of intermediate bench marks, and it has been so used to supersede the old lines in every respect in this publication. A branch line has also been run, under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission, in 1897-98 from New Orleans to the mouth of the South Pass. This line has

APPENDIX NO. 3.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

347

not been incorporated in this Appendix because it is upon especially unstable ground, on which the bench marks are likely to settle, and because the connectioi1 with sea level by tidal observations at the end of this line is not of the same high degree of accuracy as the sea-level connection at Biloxi, and has not been utilized fully as a mean sea-level connection by the Mississippi River Commission. It should be noted that although the line from Biloxi to Fort Adams is also over unstable ground it begins on ground at Biloxi which the evidence indicates to be stable, and it ends on presumably stable ground at Fort Adams. The elevations as carried from Biloxi to Fort Adams are therefore subject only to the uncertainties due to possible changes in the elevations of the bench marks dnring the comparatively short interval from 1897 to 1900, during which the leveling was in progress.
PIT'rSBURG-BELPRl<~

AND BELPRE-LAWRENCEBURG LINES.

These lines form a part of the line of precise levels from Pittsburg, Pa., to Petersburg, Ky., run along the Ohio River under the direction of the Chief of Engineers. The details in regard to this line have not yet been published. The Chief of Engineers kindly furnished to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, in manuscript, a short report upon this line by Mr. R. R. Jones, chief assistant engineer, under whose supervision the leveling was done. The portion from Pittsburg, Pa., to Marietta, Ohio, was run in 1896-97 and the remainder in 1899-1900. The line starts at P. R. R. B. M. 100 in Pittsburg, connects with the Coast and Geodetic Survey line between Grafton and Cincinnati on bench mark XL at Belpre, Ohio, and connects again with the Coast and Geodetic Survey line between Cincinnati and Odin on bench mark U at Lawrenceburg, Ind. It thus adds two new circuits to the precise level net. (See illustration 22, opposite p. 372.) The instrument used is that referred to above in connection with the Morehead CityBrunswick line, which is described in Appendix 8, page 394, illustration No. 5, and in the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, Volume XXXIX, 1898, pages 356-358. The level was made by Buff & Berger and is ordinarily known as the Van Orden level. Target rods were used. The precise leveling was restricted to hours between 9 a. m. and 3 p. 111., all of it being thus done during the middle of the day. The instrument was carefully shaded from the direct rays of the sun. Each mile was run both in the forward and in the backward direction. A failure to agree within 0.01 foot per mile caused the entire mile's work to be thrown out and rerun. The agreement was usually within 0.005 foot per mile. The level rods were provided with universal levels, and two sets of readings were taken each time, as follows: First, a foresight; second, a backsight; third, a foresight; fourth, a backsight. Both sets- of readings had to agree or the sets were repeated until they did.
BRAINERD-LAKE ITASCA A:-;-D CASS LAKE-GRA:-;-D RAPIDS LINES .

... ne details in regard to these lines, run under the direction of the Mississippi River Commission, will be found in the Report of the Chief of Engineers for 1901 in the supplement, which is a report of the Mississippi River Commission and the Missouri River Commission, pages 69-125. The observers were Messrs. \V. S. \Villiams and E. L. Hannan, and the work was under the general direction of Mr. Williams. Both

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

lines were run in 1900, using Kern instruments and rods and the well-known methods of the Mississippi River Commission, which have uniformly furnished results of the highest degree of accuracy. The details in regard to the present method of leveling by the Mississippi River Commission as used on these lines will be found in the Report of the Chief of Engineers for 1899, page 3469. The line from Brainerd to Lake Itasca starts from a bench mark in Brainerd, on the line from St. Paul to Aitkin, which has already been published. The line from Cass Lake to Grand Rapids is a branch line which leaves the Brainerd-Lake Itasca line at Cass Lake. (See illustration 22, opposite p. 372.)
THE BALTIMORE AND OHIO LINE, WASHINGTON, D. C., TO FOLEY, PA.

This line was run for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in 1902 by 0. E. Carr, who formerly had considerable experience as recorder and observer on Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling parties. The results were kindly furnished to the Coast and Geodetic Survey, for incorporation in the level net, by Mr. J. M. Graham, chief engineer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. The instrument used in this leveling is a copy of the new type of Coast and Geodetic Survey precise level. From Washington, D. C., to Hancock, W. Va., Coast and Geodetic Survey rods T and U were used. Beyond that point Molitor self-reading precise level rods, graduated to hundredths of feet, were used. The method of observation was substantially that followed at present by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Foot pins were used for rod supports. The accumulated discrepancy between the forward and backward line (B-F) was at the end of the line +o. 1865 foot, or +56.8mm on 282km, or +o.2omm per kilometer. The line connects at Washington, Hancock, and Cumberland with Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling. The route is shown on illustration 21.
THE LAKE SURVliY LINES.

The following general statement indicates the extent and location of the lines furnished by the United States Lake Survey. They commence with a line of precise levels from Greenbush, N. Y. (now Rensselaer), to Oswego, N. Y., connecting with nearly all of the old bench marks along. the line run by the Lake Survey in .1875, and also with those of the Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways and of the State engineers of New York, along this route. Oswego is connected with Olcott to the westward and with Tibbetts Point, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, by water levels on Lake Ontario during the summer months of 1899 to 1902; inclusive. At Tibbetts Point a connection is made with the line of precise levels down the St. Lawrence River. From Olcott, N. Y., a line of precise levels, run in 1901, extends the chain to Buffalo, N. Y. Water levels on Lake Erie for the four summer seasons of 1899-1902, inclusive, extend the chain to Erie, Pa., Cleveland, Ohio, and Amherstburg, Ontario. A short line of checked Wye levels extends from Amherstburg, Ontario, to Trenton, Mich., on the Gibraltar-Lexington precise level line run in 1898-99 and l 901. Recent water levels combined with old water levels on Lake Huron and Lake Michigan connect Lexington, Sand Beach, Mackinaw, Detour, and Escanaba, Mich., Milwaukee, Wis., and Chicago, Ill. A precise level line run iu 1901 extends along the St. Marys River from Detour,

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903,

on Lake Huron, to Point Iroquois, on Lake Superior. The old line of precise levels, Escanaba to Marquette, run by the Lake Survey in 1876, also connects Lake Michigan with Lake Superior. Recent water levels along Lake Superior connect Point Iroquois with Marquette. Water levels of the past eleven years, 1892-1902, extend the work from Marquette to Duluth, Minn., completing the chain through the Lakes. All these lines were furnished for incorporation in the level net, through the Chief of Engineers, by Maj. W. L. Fisk, in charge of the United States Lake Survey. All the lines referred to as precise lines were run with instruments and ·methods sufficiently similar to those used on the Mississippi and Missouri River Commissions to warrant. the supposition that they are of the same grade of accuracy, and they have been weighted accordingly. The instrument used first by Mr. Molitor, and described on pages 420, 421 of Appendix 8 of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Report for 1899, was used on some of these lines. The water leveling consisted of series of gauge or staff readings of various lengths. The weights assigned to this water leveling by the Lake Survey and adopted in this adjustment were fixed by considering that eight months (four summer months during two years) of simultaneous readings of self registering gauges at two points, or sixteen months (four summer months during four years) of simultaneous tri-daily staff gauge readings at two points, were equivalent to a precise level line of the highest . . . . h f 1000 grade between t h ese pomts, an d should be given a we1g t o L . Senes which were longer than the limit stated were not given any increased weight; but the weight for shorter series was reduced. As already stated, these lines supersede former lines in the same locality. As they are of a very high grade of accuracy, they make the level net very strong in the region bounded on the east by Greenbush, N. Y. (near Albany), to Tibbetts Point (at the east end of Lake Ontario), anq on the \vest by Chicago to Duluth. As it is expected that full details of these lines will soon be published in the report of the Chief of Engineers, it is. not necessary to make a more complete statement here.
LINES FITTED TO THE NET IN NEW YORK.

The following lines have been fitted to the net in New York, but have not been used in the adjustment of the net: Greenbush to Oswego, and Buffalo to Olcott, Albany to Buffalo, Syracuse to Clyde, and Phoenix to Clyde. The details in regard to the first two of these lines will be found in the Report of the Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways, 1900, Pt. I, pp, 392, 393; Pt. II, pp. ro15-1023, ro37, 1038, and of the last three in the Report of the State Engineer of New York, 1901, pp. 619-707.
CONDENSED STATEMENT OF DIRECT RESULTS OF OBSERVATION.

On the following pages there is shown in condensed form for convenient reference the direct results of all the leveling, which is included in the level net in this appendix. For each long line of leveling there is stated in the following tabular form the location and designation of the terminal bench marks, the distance between them measured along the level line, the observed difference of elevation, and a reference to

APPENDIX NO. 3.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

351

the authority from which these facts are obtained. The sign affixed to the difference of elevation indicates the elevation of the first named referred to the other. As the desirable information in regard to tidal observations and in regard to the observations fixing the relations between certain bench marks which are common to two or more level lines at their junction points can not conveniently be put in this tabular form, it is placed immediately after it in paragraphs, which are numbered to correspond with the relation which they bear to the tabular matter. The numbers assigned in the tabulation and the following paragraphs serve also to indicate approximately the order in which the corrected elevations and descriptions of bench marks are given. Another distinction may also be made between the paragraphic matter and the tabular matter. All elevations or relative elevations which are stated in the paragraphic matter are determined by the observations with so high a degree of accuracy, as compared with the relative elevations stated in the tabular matter, that they are treated as fixed quantities in the adjustment, or, in other w~rds, are assigned infinite weight. In the following tabular form all lines introduced into the net since the preparation of Appendix 8, Report for 1899, in which the preceding adjustment was set forth, are indicated by italics. The numbering of lines has been retained unchanged from Appendix 8, Report for 1899, as far as possible.

·In con1bining, the n. \V. leveling "·as given twice ns 1nuch weight as the New York State leveling.

The weight

assigned to the portion of the line Oswego-Greenbush is 71?, as it consists of three runnings instead of two. See page 628 of the State Engineer's Report. t The difference of elevation. -26.0940 meters, obtained by converting 85.61 feet from the tabulation of this line in the Report of the Deep \Vatcrways 1900, Part II, pages rn2g-1036, was used by n1istake in establishing the equations. The difference is due to the conversion of the original tneters into feet and keeping the hundredths only, and then the conversion of the approxintate feet into n1eters again. 1~he mistake was not discovered until too late to correct the equations, but the true value was used in distributing the correction on the line and in forming the circuit closure.

B. M. T (City B. M. No. l) was connected with B. M. U on the court-house at Lawrenceburg, Ind., by the transcontinental line of levels in 1879. These two bench marks were connected again by the line of levels between Gibraltar, Mich., and Cincinnati, Ohio, in i899. The difference of elevation, T- U, as determined in 1879 was +18.443s meters, and in J899 +18.482s meters. The mean of these two, giving the leveling of 1899 double weight, was adopted. The distribution of the corrections through the lines between these bench marks fixed the differences between T and o., and T and As. The bench marks T and As were connected again by leveling from Y 4 to As in the line from Cincinnati southward in 1900. The discrepancy thus developed was distributed over the new line only. The differences fixed as indicated above areCincinnati, T-Lawrenceburg, U=+18m.469s; distance 37 kilometers. Cincinnati, T-Cincinnati, o.= + r6m. 7277. Cincinnati, T-Covington, As= +4m.0849.

No. 58.-WASHINGTON, D. C.

The elevation given on page 410 of Appendix 8, Report for 1899, for the Capitol bench mark depends upon five years of tidal observations at the navy-yard. Additional tidal observations are now available. The elevation here given and used in the adjustment of 1903 depends upon ten years, 1892-1901, of hourly heights 011 the water surface of the Potomac River, obtained from self-registering tide gauges located, first, at the navyyard, later at the Seventh street wharf, and finally at Easbys Point. These gauges were all connected with each other and with the Capitol bench mark by spirit leveling. The total range of the 10 annual means all referred to one point is 0.4565 foot=o. 1391 meter, and the probable error of the mean is 0.0297 foot or 0.0091 meter. According to these tidal observations the Capitol bench mark is 90.3966 feet= 27.5529 meters above the mean river level. Retaining as before the assumption that the total fall

'l'ESTS OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF 1899.

As the net now to be adjusted is the same as that adjusted in 1899 with a few additions, and as the same method of adjustment is to be used, it will be interesting to note at the outset how well the differences of elevations given by the new lines agree with the same differences as determined by the adjustment of r 899, and with the differences as given by the most direct connections between the same points by old lines before any adjustment whatever had been made, and even before the correction for systematic error a<; set forth on pages 441-444, 446 of Appendix 8, Report for

1899, had been applied. Such tests will serve to indicate whether the· corrections· applied in the 1899 adjustment improved the results. The difference of elevation, Cincinnati, T-Birmingham, P. B. M. 2, as given by the new lines via Somerset, Harriman Junction, Woodville, and Decatur,* is - 14.9176 meters. The most direct route by the old leveling is by way of Odin, Cairo, Corinth, and Meridian,t and according to this the difference, Cincinnati, T-Birmingham, P. B. M. 2, is -16.5538 meters. If from the old leveling Birmingham and Cincinnati be considered fixed in elevation by the best lines connecting these two points with sea level, and the difference then taken, the result will be as follows: Birmingham, P. B. M. 2, as fixed from the sea-level connection at Biloxi by the lines via Mobile and Meridian, has an elevation of + 181. 5925; Cincinnati, T, as fixed from the sea"level connection at Sandy Hook by the lines via Harrisburg, Hagerstown, Grafton, and Belpre,§ has an elevation of + 166. 7167; Cincinnati, T, as fixed from the sea-level connection at Washington by the lines via Hagerstown, Grafton, and Belpre,11 has an elevation of + l 66. 5268 meters. From these two elevations for Cincinnati and the elevation of Birmingham as fixed from Biloxi result the differences, Cincinnati, T-Birmingham, P. B. M. 2= -14.8758 and -15.0657, respectively. The difference of elevation, Cincinnati, T-Birmingham, P. B. M. 2, as adjusted in 1899,ll~ is -15.0858, which, it will be noted, agrees more closely with the new observed difference than any of the old observed differences except the last. The difference of elevation, Cincinnati, T-Corinth, V, from the new lines Yia Somerset, Harriman Junction, \Voodville, Decatur, and Tuscumbia,** is +28.9882. The same difference derived from the old line via Odin and CairoH is +27.7792 ll)eters. The elevation of Corinth, Y, as derived from mean sea level at Biloxi via Mobile and Meridian,!! is +r37.2595 meters. Combining this with the two values for Cincinnati, T, derived from Sandy Hook and \Vashington as indicated above, there are obtained the differences, Cincinnati, T-Corinth, V=+29.4572 meters and +29.2673 meters, respectively. The difference, Cincinnati, T-Corinth, V, as adjusted in 1899,§§ is +28.7285 meters, which agrees more closely with the new observed difference than do any of the other unadjusted differences cited above. The difference of elevation, Corinth, V- Binning ham, P. B. M. 2, from the new lines via 'I'uscumbia and Decatur, 1111 is -43.9058 meters. The same difference as derived from tlie old lines via Meridian ~I~: is ·-44. 3330 meters. The difference, as adjusted in 1899,4fl is -43.8143 meters, agreeing very closely with the new line. In the computations of the two preceding paragraphs the old line between Corinth and Decatur (lines 97 and 98, App. 8) has been ignored on account of the 1-meter error which has lately been discovered in it. If, however, it had been taken into account after being corrected 1 meter, the comparison would stand substantially as shown, since after correction it agrees Yery closely within 7'"m. 7 with the new line between the same points. ----------·---··-----·- -··-- --- ·- -- - --·--·-----*Lines 150, 157A, 157B, 158, 159, 6A, of this **Lines 151, 153, 157A, 157B, 158, 159, 6A. appendix and Appendix 8, Report for 1899. tt Lines 33, J.f, 35, 36, 7, 6A. t Lines z49, IoI, 100, J2, 3J, J4, J5, 36, 7, and 6A. tt Lines 29A, JO, 31, 32. ~~Appendix 8, Report for 1899, p. 449. t Lines 29A, JO, JI, loo, 101, 149. ~Lines 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, 168, 166. ii II Lines 150, 153, 15 !. ~~Lines 149, 101, 100, 32.

The difference of elevation, Sioux City, P. B. M. 399- Norfolk, N,, as determined by the new line,* is - l 28. 9789 meters. The same difference from the old lines via Kansas City and Abilenet is -129.1125 meters. The difference, as adjusted in 1899,t is -129.0661 meters, the adjustments having applied such corrections as to bring the adjusted difference of elevation nearer to the difference of elevation as ohserved later. The difference, Solomon, C, -Salina, H,, as obsen·ed in l 900 on the line SolomonAnthony (p. 261), was -15.3095 meters. The same difference as observed on the old line, Holliday-Salina,§ was - 15. 3359 meters. The difference as adjusted in 1899 JJ was - l 5.3322 meters, the adjusted difference thus being slightly nearer to the new difference observed later than the old observed difference. The difference, Norfolk, K,-Cheyenne, B, from the new lines via Page, Chadron, and Orin Junction,-;\ is - I 383.3802 meters. The same difference from the shortest of the old lines between the same points, viz, via Abilene, Solomon, Salina, and Denver,** is - 1383.5769. The difference as adjusted in 1899 H is - 1383.4059 meters, an extremely close agreement with the new observations. If for the line between Solomon, C,, and Salina, H,, as adjusted in 1899, there is substituted the new line run between these points, 17 A, run since the adjustment of 1899 was made, and the adjustment of l 899 as otherwise left unchanged, the difference Norfolk, N, -Cheyenne, B, becomes - r 383. 3832, agreeing within 3 millimeters with the new lines from Norfolk to Cheyenne via Orin Junction. The difference, Greenbush, Gristmill-Dobbs Ferry, V, as observed in 1902 ti is +r.2897. The same difference by the old direct line§§ between those points is + r. l 249 meters. The difference as adjus.ted in 1899 JI JI is + r. 2027 meters. The effect of the adjustment was, therefore, to correct the old line in the right direction but by an insufficient amount. The elevation of Smithland, XLV, as brought from mean sea level at Biloxi by the new lines through New Orleans and Baton Rouge9iT9if is+ 14.8235. This same elevation as brought from Biloxi over the old lines is+ 14. 6001 meters if the Engineer line is used between Biloxi and Carrollton,*** and +r4.6474 meters if the Coast and Geodetic Survey line is used between those points. Ht The elevation of Smithland, XLV, as adjusted in 1899!!! is +14.7917. In other words, the adjustment of 1899 corrected the observed differences of elevation in such a way as to bring them nearly into agreement, within 3i.8 millimeters, with the observed difference of elevation, which was not known at this Office at the time the adjustment was made. The difference of elevation, Fort Adams, XLIX-Smithland, XLV, from the new line (line 147), is +6.0760 meters. This same difference, a<; determined by the old line between Smithland and Vidalia, line 40, is +6.0439 meters. The adjustment of 1899§§§ gave Fort Adams, XLIX-Sn1ithland, XLV, as +6.0402.

correction applied 'by the adjustment to the old observations in this case was apparently in the wrong direction. The difference of elevation, Braddock, 88-Belpre, XL, from the new lines* is +63.2107 meters. The same difference by the old lines, by way of Grafton,+ is +63.2110 meters. The adjustment of 1899 t gave the difference, Braddock, 88-Belpre, XL, +63.3424 meters, farther from the new observed difference than is, the old observed difference. The difference of elevation, Belpre, XL-Lawrenceburg, U, from the new line,§ by way of the Ohio River, is +41. 1523 meters. The same difference by the old line direct between these points!! is +4i.2147 meters. The difference as adjusted in 1899·j· was +4r.4041 meters, the adjustment having again apparently corrected the old obsel\·ations in the wrong direction. The difference of elevation, Abilene, Y, -Shreveport, 46, from the new lines,** by way of Bowie, Tex., is +290.9862 meters. The same difference by the old lines, H by way of Holliday, Kans., and Little Rock, Ark., was +291.8105 meters. The adjustment of 1899 gave +291.2892, much nearer to the new difference than is the old determination. The difference of elevation, Oswego, A-Greenbush, Gristmill, from the new lines,tt by the Lake Survey, is +12.5510 meters. The same difference from the old lines§§ was +12.5800. The adjustment of 1899 gave +12.5632. The correction applied in the adjustment was therefore of such a sign and magnitude as to make the adjusted difference nearer to the new difference than is the old difference. The difference, Washington, Capitol-Hancock, F, from the new Baltimore and Ohio line (line 225) is -100.6856 meters. By the old leveling (lines 58A, 59A, 59B, 4C) this difference was - roo.4882. The adjustment of 1899 gave -100.5393, the correction applied being therefore of the right sign to force the adjusted result toward that given by the new leveling. The difference, Cumberland, I-Hancock, F, from the new Baltimore and Ohio line (line 226) is +61.9468 meters. This difference from the old leveling (line 4B) was +61.8102. The adjustment of 1899 gave +6i.8334, the correction again being of the right sign to force the adjusted result toward that given by the new leveling. In the above comparisons many new lines which have been introduced into the net in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the south of New York have not been considered, as they are of such little weight that the new direct determinations of the differences of elevation of their en9. points is of little if any greater reliability than the old indirect determinations. Such lines serve. the purposes of fixing the elevations of intermediate bench marks along the lines rather than of fixing the differences of ele\·ation of the end bench marks. The new Lake Survey lines are in part revisions of old lines and it is very difficult to get from them comparisons of value similar to those made above. The other new lines do not connect such points that comparisons similar to the above may be made.

adjustment of 1899 could be made if such comparisons were not limited to the most direct of the old lines between the points in question. Such a limitation is, however, evidently proper. 1t will be noted that if two of the comparisons made above, viz, on the lines Braddock-Belpre and Belpre-Lawrenceburg be omitted, in the remaining eighteen comparisons the difference of elevation from the adjustment of 1899 was found to be nearer to the difference as observed later than were the old observed differences upon which the adjustment was based, in sixteen out of eighteen cases. The two exceptional lines, Braddock-Belpre and Belpre-Lawrenceburg, on which the adjustment apparently had the wrong effect, are the only new lines which are not either Kern leveling by the Engineers or leveling since l 899 by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the two classes of leveling to which it is now certain that the greatest weight should be assigned. Taking the comparisons as a whole they indicate that the adjustment of 1899 had anticipated the effects of later leveling to a considerable extent by making the adjusted elevations agree closely with results which were yet to be obtained by such later leveling. To have accomplished such a feat is a triumph for the adjustment. It is also a remarkably satisfactory proof that the theories upon which the adjustment was based are in the main correct, for the best possible proof that a theory is correct is an agreement, such as that noted above, between prediction and subsequent observation. These tests of the adjustment and other tests made from different points of view led to the decision to make the adjustment of 1903 by the same methods as the adjustment of 1899. The above decision carries with it the application of the systematic corrections to the Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899 as applied in the adjustment of 1899, the comparisons made above being between the old differences of elevation without systematic correction, the adjusted differences of elevation involving systematic corrections, and the differences of elevation from the new leveling. It is especially interesting to note that on the long line from Abilene westward to Denver, which was a portion of a spur from the level net when the adjustment of 1899 was made, the correction + 64.0 millimeters which was applied for systematic error,* was of the right sign and amount to produce an almost exact agreement with the later leveling, as indicated in the preceding comparisons.
THE CIRCUIT CLOSURES.

The 50 circuit closures are reproduced below in a table for convenient reference. The circuits are arranged in the order of the magnitude of the closures expressed in millimeters per kilometer, the best closure being placed first. Only simple circuits are used; i. e., there are no circuits given in the tahle which are divided by cross lines into smaller circuits. The last column shows the character of the lines forming the circuits, the different grades of lines being mentioned in decreasing order of the number of kilometers entering into the circuit. The symbols 1899- and 1899+ in the last column refer, respectively, to leveling by Coast and Geodetic Survey previous to 1899, and leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899 and later. The leveling referred to by the word '' Engineers'' was done under the direction of the Corps of Engineers, mainly by the Mississippi and Missouri River Commissions, with Kern instruments and the corresponding methods.

THE LEVEL NET ADJUSTMEN'I' OF 1903.

The relative positions of the varions lines forming the level net to be adjusted are shown on the illustration here inserted. The lines have been drawn nearly in their true location, but the drawing has necessarily been somewhat generalized, and in a few cases it has been necessary to exaggerate distances between points in order to make them show as separate points. Inside each circnit formed by several level lines there is printed the closing error in millimeters and the total circumference of the circnit in kilometers. A plus sign on the closing- error indicates that the elevation as carried around the circuit in a counterclockwise direction is too great. On all circuits of which the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, or Chesapeake Bay form one side it is assumed that the mean sea snrface is everywhere at the same level on the Atlantic, Gulf, and the Chesapeake. It is evident that in these closing errors there is information of the highest value as to the actual errors of the leveling. The concrete problem in hand is to adjust this net by distributing the closing errors in such a way as to obtain as close an approximation as possible to the truth. Illustration No. 22 shows the net used in the adjustment of 1903. It should be noted, however, that the line St. Augustine-Cedar Keys, across Florida, does not enter the eqnations of the adjustment, as it does not connect with any other line; that the lines Old Point Comfort-Richmond-Washington and Annapolis-Washington do not enter the equations for the reason that they are tied to sea level at each erid. Before beginning the adjnstment, the question of what relative weights should be assigned to the different classes of leveling was again carefully considered. The same criterion for determining these relative weights that had been used in I 899 was again used, viz, that after the adjustment is made the mean value of j;v2 for each of the five groups into which the leveling is divided with respect to assigned weights should be as nearly as possible the same. As even a large change in relative weights produces but small changes in the computed elevations, it is-not advisable to change the weight assigned to any class of leveling nnless the evidence is clear that a change of at least 25 per cent should be made. It was found necessary to make a large reduction in the weights assigned to each class of leveling except the first, namely, .the class including Engineer lines, Coast and Geodetic Survey lines in 1899 and later, and water leveling.
*The tidal series at ench end of this line extends O\'er one year only, and at each end the local conditions nre such that the tide observations may he subject to considerable wind effect. See Appendix 8, Report for 1899, p. 3¢.

PRECISE LEVELING I::-1' THE l:NITED STATES.

3 73

The new line from Pittsburg, Pa., to Lawrenceburg, Ind., was classed with the \Vye levels run under the direction of the Corps of Engineers and the Board on Deep Waterways, and was therefore assigned a weight of 3';. The use of target rods and a method of observing which extended the observations at a given station over a considerably longer interval of time than is necessary with the Kern leveling or the later Coast ,and Geodetic Survey leveling, made it certain that this line should not be assigned to the class having the greatest weight. The care with which the work seems to have been done and the fact that each portion of the line was run in both the fonvard and backward directions, each indicated that it should not be assigned to a lower group in the scale of weights. The weights'used in the adjustment of 1903* are as follows,/, being the length of the line in kilometers: ------------------ - - -

The net is connected strongly with mean sea level at Sandy Hook and at Biloxi, and there are weak connections with mean sea level at \Vashington, D. C., :Morehead City, N. C., and Brunswick, Ga. At Washington the adjustment is based upon the assumption that the mean· level of the Potomac at W ashin~on is 88 millimeters higher than mean sea level. (See p. 362.) The net of 1903 involves 106 links and 48 circuits, including those of which water levels along the Gulf and Atlantic form one side. The adjustment of 1899 invoh·ecl 54 links and 25 such circuits. . Before making the least square adjustment, all of the Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to l 899 was corrected for systematic error according to the formula derived in 1899 (see pp. 442-444, 446, Appendix 8, Report for 1899), and the corrected values are given in the column headed ''Observed differences'' in the following table.
*It may be of interest to note that the pv 2 from the adjustment of 1903 were examined nfter the adjustment was completed to determine whether these weights seemed to be correct. The test indicated that groups 1, 3 1 and 5 have been assigned the proper relative weights, and groups 2 and 4 weights which are probably somewhat too large. "l'he evidence was not sufficiently decisive, howe\"er, to warrant any changes in weights. t If a series of simultaneous self-registering gauge readings at two points was less than eight months long (four summer months during each of two years), or a series of simultaneous try-daily staff gauge readings less than sixteen months (four summer months during four years), the weight assigne<l

to the line joining these points was rcducc<l helow

COAST AN'D GEODETIC SUR\'EY REPORT, 1903.

An examination of the evidence afforded by the new lines added to the net since 1899 indicates that a new computation of the constants of this formula would give values agreeing closely with the old values. For convenience of reference, the systematic corrections are shown in the tables on pages 382 to 386.

APPENDIX NO. 3.

PRECISE LEVELING IN THE UNITED STATES.

379

The probable error of an observation of unit weight, i. e., of the observed difference of elevation on the two ends of a line of such a length as to be assigned unit weight, was found to be ± 32.8 millimeters. In the adjustment of 1899 this quantity was found to be ±32.9 millimeters. The probable error of unit weight, ±32.8 millimeters, corresponds to a probable error of ± i.04 millimeters for a single kilometer of leveling assigned to Group 1 in the scale of weights (p. 373), i. e., for either Kern leveling by the Corps of Engineers, or leveling in l 899 or later by the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The probable error of the elevation of bench mark K 3 at St. Louis is found from the 1903 adjustment to be ± 32 millimeters. The probable error of this elevation computed from the 1899 adjustment was ± 65 millimeters. The contrast between these values expresses forcibly the great increase in the strength of the level net due to the added leveling. It is an even chance that the elevation computed from the adjustment of 1903 will not be changed more than 32 millimeters by any amount of new leveling, and it is almost certain that it will not be changed by as much as o. 15 meter or 6 inches.
ADOPTED ELEVATIONS OF JUNCTION POINTS.

Having thus secured the theoretically most accurate elevations for the junction points, the question of adopting as standard elevations for present use such values as will produce the minimum disturbance in past publications,, and the minimum inconvenience in the revision of past computations, now arises. This question has already been touched upon in the general statement at the beginning of this appendix (see p. 198). It is desirable to make as few changes as is allowable in the elevations and differences of elevations already published in Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The following decision is based upon the supposition that an arbitrary decision to hold old elevations unchanged or to correct a group of them by a constant which is an integral number of centimeters is allowable, Provided, l. That by so doing a considerable number of old elevations or differences of elevation are retained unchanged; 2. That every assigned elevation agrees with the elevation derived from the latest adjustment within the probable error of said elevation derived from the latest adjustment; 3. ·That every assigned differenceof elevation between junction points agrees with the value of that difference derived from the latest adjustment within the probable error of observation of said difference. It was decided in accordance with these principles to add 60 millimeters to the elevations printed in Appendix 8, Report for 1899, at Smithland, La.; Vidalia, La.; Shreveport, La.; Monroe, La.; Rayville, La.; Vicksburg, Miss.; Wilkersons Landing, Miss.; Little Rock, Ark.; Memphis, Tenn.; Cairo, Ill., and Odin, Ill., and to the elevations of all bench marks on the direct lines joining these points. The differences of elevation therefore on all these lines remain unchanged. For all other junction points in the net the elevations given by the 1903 adjustment were adopted.

Table 3 shows the same corrections as Table 2, expressed in millimeters per kilometer. The different links have been rearranged and placed in Table 3 in the order of rnagnitude of the total correction in the adjustment of 1903 in millimeters per kilometer, and serial numbers on this basis have been assigned. The table serves to place the links in order of accuracy as shown by this standard, the most accurate line being placed first. In the column headed ''Character of line'· a single entry indicates that practically the whole link was of that character. I~ there are two or more entries, the link is a composite one, in which the character of the longer portfon is mentioned first. The symbols 1899 and 1899 - refer to leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1899 and later, and before 1899, respectively.

COMPARISO~

OF VARIOUS ADJUSTMEXTS.

In the table given below the elevations for the junction points resulting from various adjustments are placed side. by side for comparison. The four adjustments shown in columns 1 to 4 depend upon the data which were available in 1899. The adjustment corresponding to column 5 depends upon the data which were available in 1902 at the time that adjustment was made. Column 6 shows the values resulting from the adjustment of 1903. The differences between elevations in columns 5 and 6 and those in columns 1 to 4 are therefore due in part to the utilization of additional information.
·On link 4A the systematic correction was applied only upon the 85 kilometers of leveling by the C. and G. S. previous to 18gi. Similarly on link 12 the whole systematic correction was applied on the 185 kilometers by the C. and G. S. previous to 1899.

The close agreements between columns r to 4 among themselves and between columns 5 and 6 indicate to what a slight extent the derived elevations are dependent on the judgment of the computer in fixing the relative weights and the fonn of the computation. The various adjusted values for any one junction point furnish an indication of the probable accuracy of the elevation of that point derived from the last adjustment. The explanations of the six adjustments corresponding to the six separate columns are given after the table. The integral number of meters for each junction point is given but once in the table, and the decimal part only given in the remaining columns.

· The adjustment of which the results are shown in column r is published on pages 431-433 of Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The net adjusted was composed entirely of Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling previous to 1899, with the minor exception that 33 kilometers of Kern leveling by the Engir.eers between Greenville and Wilkersons Landing in Mississippi was used. The net involved r r links, forming 5 circuits. The weights assigned to each hne were equal to

The probable error corresponding to unit weight was

found to be ±450 millimeters. The adjustment of which the results are shown in column 2 is published on pages 434-437 of Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The net was made up of 17 links forming 7 circuits. The net was composed in the main of Kern leveling by the Engineers and water leveling along the Great Lakes. In order to form a net suitable for adjustment it was necessary to supplement such leveling by introducing a few other lines presumed to be of a lesser degree of accuracy and assigned smaller weights.

This adjustment dealt with all the available leveling connected with the aet up to and including 1899 and, therefore, involved observations of various grades of accuracy. The net was composed of 54 links forming 25 circuits. The lines of Kern leveling by the Engineers, of water leveling along the Great Lakes (with one exception), of Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling in 1899 and later, were assigned weights equal to

The same leveling was used in this as in the preliminary general adjustment indicated in column 3. The difference between

the two adjustments is that the weights were greatly changed for all Coast and Geodetic Survey lines run previous to l 899 and for the Geological Survey and Van Orden lines,* and that corrections for systematic error were applied to all Coast and Geodetic Survey 1000 l~veling previous to 1899 before the adjustment was made. Weights equal to -ywere still retained for the leveling of the highest grade of accuracy. The probable error corresponding to unit weight was found to be ±32.9 millimeters. The adjustment of which the results are shown in column 5 was made in 1902. It included- all of the available leveling connected with the ~let up to the date of the adjustment in the fall of 1902, t and the net was composed of 66 links, fom1ing 31 circuits. The weights assigned to the five classes indicated on page 373 were !!?LO<l., ~r,

As already stated, the adjustment of which the results are shown in column 6, is that made in 1903 and for which the details are shown on pages 372 to 379. It involved much new material, being composed of 106 links and 48 circuits as contrasted with 66 links and 31 circuits in the adjustment of 1902. · A comparison of the results of adjustments of 1902 and of 1903 is especially interesting, as showing how little change in the elevations of 1902 was made by the large amount of new material added in 1903 and the large changes in relative weights then introduced. An adjustment was also made in which all leveling was weighted in inverse proportion to the length of line only, that is: P=

"!....p, without

regard to the class in

which it belongs. This adjustment was based on the same data as the adjustment of 1902, except that the 1899-leveling was not corrected for systematic error. ·The resulting elevations differed from those derived from the 1902 adjustment from 1 to 30 centimeters, but the test for weights, namely, that the average pv' for each class of 1 for .leveling should be approximately the same, showed that the weighting used,

°;:°

all, was not correct, and that the different classes should be assigned weights which differ greatly, and are in the same order as those used in the 1903 adjustment. The further test by the comparison of the corrections on the links in millimeters per kilometers, similar to table 3, page 384,- showed the same relative positions for the different classes of leveli1ig and indicated conclusively that the corrections can not be forced away from this relative order by any change in the weighting.
*Compare the tables of weights on pp. 438 and 448 of Appendix 8, Report for 1899. tThis did not include the new and revised Lake Survey lines nor the eleven new lines by the U. S. Geological Survey in New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, which are referred to on pages 346 and 348 as having b~en introduced into the 1903 adjustment.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903. SPEED, COST, AND ACCURACY OF LEVELING WITH THE NEW INSTRUMEN'T.

The average rate of progress of a party with the new instrument for a whole line has varied from 52 to 98 miles per month,* the time being counted without any deductions from the first to the last day of leveling. The rate of progress has seldom fallen below 50 miles per month even for a single month. The average rate of progress on all the lines here published run with the new instruments has been 66 miles ( 106 kilometers) of completed line per month ( 2 440 miles in 36. 9 months). Every mile of progress represents a mile leveled at' least twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. If the first two results on any section did not check within the specified narrow limits the section was releveled in each direction, except as indicated in paragraph 6 of the instructions, p. 2 l 3. The following instances of rapid leveling occurred in the ordinary course of the field work. In every case except that given in the following paragraph similar examples closely approaching it can readily be found by examining the records. Between April 3 and November 18, 1902, Mr. \V. H. Burger, Aid, ran 640 completed miles of leveling between Anthony, Kans., and Shreveport, La., his average rate of progress being 85 miles per month. This period included two months of very hot weather, during which many miles were run with the thermometer buried in the wooden rods reading more than 40° C. ( 104 ° F.). For comparison with other leveling of the same grade of accuracy it may be noted that recent leveling under the Mississippi River Commission was done at a rate of 38 completed miles per month, i' and under the Lake Survey at about 40 miles per month. During the month of June, on the line from Anthony to Shreveport, by ::Vlr. Burger, 105 miles were completed, the leveling proceeding on twenty-five days during the month, and the total length of single line was 223 miles, or an average of 8.9 miles of single line per observing day. This feat was not accomplished by extra long hours. Making no allowances whatever for any delays or interruptions except the stop in the middle of the day for lunch, the average number of hours of leveling was 7 }.( per day, and the average speed was therefore for a whole month I.2 miles of single line per hour during the progress of the surveying. The average length of sight during this month was 274 feet (83 meters). The party under Mr. W. C. Dibrell, Aid, ran 103 completed miles during the month of July, 1902, a remarkable record when it is considered that the party encountered many heavy grades on this work in \Vyoming. On July 29, 1902, Mr. Dibrell ran 15.8 miles of single line, none of which was afterwards found to need rerunning. The observing was done in 9 hours and 40 minutes, making no deduction for delays except dinner, or at an average rate of r.6 miles per hour. The total number of instrument stations on this day was 147. Assuming that the observer moved from station to station on the velocipede cars at an average rate of 6 miles per hour, the time actually spent at the stations was 7 hours 2 minutes, or 2.9 minutes per station. This includes the time of leveling the instrument and
*The very short line, Temple to Holla11<l, Tex., 17 miles, at the rate of 37 miles per month, is excluded from this statement. t See Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, XLV, June, 1901, pp. 174, 175, 179, 187, 188.

making other manipulations as well as the observing, being the interval from the instant the instrument struck the ground until it was back upon the car. Similarly, the same observer, a few miles east of Rawlins, \Vyo., ran 4 miles of levels, none of which required rerunning, in l hour 53 minutes, or at the rate of 2. I miles per hour. The cost per completed mi1e foi certaiii of the lines run with the new instrument for which the facts are now obtainable are as follows: Cincinnati to Somerset and Harriman Junction to Woodville, $10.60 per mile. Somerset to Knoxville and Woodville to Birmingham, $9.50 per mile; Page to Chadron, Nebr., $8. 80 per mile; Cheyenne to Orin Junction, \Vyo., and Decatur, Ala., to Corinth, M:is.s., $10.30 per mile; Anthony, Kans., to Shreveport, La., $6.70 per mile. The average cost per completed mile for all these lines is $8. 70 ($5.40 per kilometer). The variation in cost between the above lines is due to various causes; to the weather conditions, whether boarding places were near together and near to the work, whether velocipede cars were used, whether heavy grades were encountered, and, finally, to the difference between observers. The above figures represent the actual cost of the leveling, including the establishment of the bench marks, with the exception of the cost of instruments and stationery. It includes the transportation to and from the field paid by the Government, and all wages and salaries, including the chief of party and recorder. The salary of each member of the permanent force is charged to the leveling for the ·whole period during which he ·was engaged upon work incidental to the leveling, including the time spent in travel to and from the field, the time spent in preparing for the field, and of completing field reports aud records aud computations at the end of the season. One-eleYenth has been added to the salary actually paid each officer during the time he was connected with the leveling, to take account of the fact that the Government pays its permanent employees twelve months' salary for eleven months' work upon an average. Various comparisons with the cost of other leveling might be made. Perhaps the most interesting comparison is with some of the most recent leveling under the Mississippi River Commission of which the costs are available to the writer, namely, the line New Orleans, La., to Biloxi, 1vliss., 85 miles, cost $16 per mile; St. Paul to Aitkin, Minn., 222 miles, $13.85 per mile; Brainerd to Lake Itasca and Cass Lake to Grand Rapids, Minn., 204 miles, $16.73 per mile.* Other leveling of as high a degree of accuracy as this and the recent Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling has in general cost more than $I6 per mile, and in some cases has cost double that amount. (Seep. zS7, preceding reference.) As to accuracy, it should be noted at the outset that the instructions under which the observers on Coast and Geodetic Survey leveling have worked since 1899 (see pp. 21 I) are such as to cause the accidental errors discoverable by the discrepancies on each section between the forward and backward lines to be of the magnitude measured by probable error of about ±omm. 7 or ±omm. 8. It is true that the instructions contain no reference to this probable error, but the 4"11"vK limit of di\'ergence between the forward and the backward lines on any section, coupled ·with the verbal injunction to the obsenrer (seep. 215) not to be so cautious and slow as to have no rerunning, has practically the effect of preventing the probable error from departing far from these values in either direction (see pp. 224-225).

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

The real test of the accuracy, however, is the most severe test, namely, the corrections which are found necessary when the lines are adjusted as part of a net, these being the corrections which must be made in order to close all circuits. The whole group to which this leveling done with the new instrument has been assigned has been found to be of the degree of accuracy measured by the probable error of ±Imm.04 for a completed line I kilometer long Or ±32mm.8 for a completed line I 000 kilometers long. In comparing this value with the value ±omm. 7 or ±omm.8, calculated in the preceding paragraph, it must be noted that the value, ±1mm.04, computed from the adjustment of the n~t includes all systematic errors which become evident when a line is incorporated in the net as well as the purely accidental errors which become evident from the rerunning of short sections. The leveling with the new instruments has been classed with the levels run under the Corps of Engineers with the Kern instruments and with accurate water leveling through the Great Lakes (see weight table on p. 373). The probable error of ±1'"m.04 applies to the whole group. The attempt was deliberately made in fixing the methods used since 1899 to make the new leveling of the same grade of accuracy as the leveling under the Corps of Engineers, and to reduce the time and cost as much as possible rather than to increase the accuracy. Is the leveling which has actually been done with the new instruments as accurate as the leveling under the Corps of Engineers? The writer believes it to be of at least the same degree of accuracy. The two best tests available to settle this question are furnished by the tables on pages 371 and 384. According to the latter table, the 1899+ links range from 1 to 43 in the serial numbers assigned in the order of magnitude of the corrections in millimeters per kilometers, whereas the Engineer leveling ranges from 2 to 65. For the 1899+ links the maximum rate of correction is 0.074 millimeter per kilometer, and for the Engineer links 0.20 millimeter per kilometer. This test indicates that the 1899+ leveling is of a higher degree of accuracy than the Engineer leveling. In the equations on pages 374 to 376 both the 1899+ leveling and the Engineer leveling have been weighted on the same scale, namely, weight= ~ 0 ; hence, if the two kinds of leveling are of the same grade of accuracy, the average pv2 for the 1899+ links should be the same as for the Engineer links. The average pv2 for the 1899+ links is 756 and for the Engineer links is 1233. This difference is a strong indication that the new leveling by the Coast and Geodetic Survey is more accurate than the Engineer leveling. Taking all the evidence set forth in this Appendix into account, and much more voluminous evidence not set forth for lack of space, which corroborates fully the following conclusions, it may be confidently stated that the leveling done in the Coast and Geodetic Survey with the new instruments since 1899 is fully up to the highest standard yet attained in precise leveling in the United States, and that the cost per mile with the new instruments has been from 25 to 80 per cent of the cost of leveling of approximately the same grade of accuracy with other instruments and methods.

ELEV ATIO~S.

In deriving the adopted elevations of the following list the same methods have been followed as were set forth on page 451 of Appendix 8, Report for 1899. The local differences of elevation as adopted, as shown on pages 36::> to 366 of this appendix, have been preserved unchanged. The adopted elevations of the junction points are shown on page 378, and in general the adoption of an elevation for each junction point fixes the elevations for a group of bench marks around it in accordance with the preceding sentence. The- elevations being thus fixed at each end of each line which forms a link in the level net, for intermediate points the c9rrections to the observed elevations have been interpolated between end points on the supposition that the correction varies at a uniform rate in millimeters per kilometer along the line except in two classes of cases, viz, first, if a line is composed of two classes of leveling which have been weighted differently as indicated on page 373, the corrections have been supposed to vary on each part of the line at different rates in accordance with the assigned weights; second, if a

bench mark is common to two or more lines between fixed points-as, for example, certain bench marks between 'Washington and Richmond which were connected with both the line of ,1883-84 and of 1895-a mean or weighted mean of the two corrected elevations is taken as the adopted elevation. Such bench marks common to two lines serve to break each of them into sections, each of which, if it contains any intermediate bench marks, is treated as a link having fixed ends in deriving the elevations of these bench marks. ' On each line which is a spur from the level net, or, in other words, is connected with it at one end only, a constant correction has been applied to the observed elevations equal to the correction applied at the origin of the spur. 'I'he elevations are given in the following list to tenths of millimeters. 'I'his does not imply that the tenths are known. For bench marks not more than 2 kilometers apart the difference of elevation is uncertain in the millimeters and tenths; for those which are from 2 to 200 kilometers apart the centimeters are also uncertain, and for greater distances there may be in some cases an uncertainty in the decimeters. Similarly, the uncertainty in the absolute elevations varies with the distance from the nearest tidal connection. For the convenience of those who may wish to compare the elevations here given with others which are expressed in feet, or vice versa, the following conversion table is here inserted:

BM No'rE 18.-About the time that the line Dobbs Ferry to Greenbush was completed, the railroad company had all the mileposts (except between Rensselaer and Troy) removed, with the intention of putting in new stone ones. These new mileposts are to be about 20 Yz rails (rails 30 feet long) south of where the old ones were.

M. 45, opposite Shreveport, La., which is said to be the same as the triangulation station West Base of the Shreveport Base Line, was reported in 1902 to be a wooden post 6 i~ches square, of which the top is rotten. The post is also reported to be loose in the ground, and of no value as a permanent bench mark. Page 707. I~ was reported in 1901 that old B. M. U. S. at Decatur, Ala., has been disturbed in its elevation by a change in the bridge-seat stone. Page 707. It was reported in 1901 that P. B. M. 48 at Decatur, Ala., is probably lost, as the bolt could not be found, but the hole supposed to have been left by the [,olt was found. Page 707. It was reported in 1901 that the elevation of P. B. M. 49 at Decatur, Ala., had been disturbed. Page 7 ro. The description of T. B. M. 63 should have been inserted after T. B. M. 6o, near the bottom of the page, as follows: "T. B.

TRIANGULATION SOUTHWARD ALONG THE NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN IN 1902.
By
JOHN

F.

HAYFORD

Inspector o.f Geodetic Work; Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Survey.

GENERAL STATEMENT.

The purpose of this appendix is to set forth fully in convenient form the results of the triangulation of 1902 southward along the ninety-eighth meridian from its former terminus near the southern boundary of Kansas to central Texas. The work of l 902 is the most rapid and economical triangulation of a primary degree of accuracy yet .executed in the United States, and so far as the writer kno~s it has not been equaled in these respects in any other country. This makes the methods employed of tmusual interest. From the point of view of the geodesist it is always interesting to know the method of adjustment of a triangulation and the accuracy attained in the field observations. The informatio~ as to the accuracy attained is of more than usual interest in this particular case as the methods have been somewhat novel, and it is important to know accurately and to what extent the novel features have been justified or condemned by the outcome of the season in regard to accuracy. The information in regard to accuracy has therefore been set forth with unusual detail in this report and with an unusual number of comparisons with past work, the purpose being to show in full whether accuracy has been sacrificed in the attempt to secure rapid triangulation at relatively small cost. The engineer, intent only upon securing the necessary information to enable him to extend this triangulation or base other surveys upon it, will find the information he desires in the latter part of this appendix commencing with the explanation of positions, lengths, and azimuths. The index of positions, descriptions, and elevations, used in connection with the sketches at the end of the appendix, will enable him to find quickly the data he desires for any given locality. At the beginning of the season of l 902, the southern limit of triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian was in the Anthony base net, near the southern boundary of Kansas, the base net being not yet complete. The triangulation of 1901, and the triangulation adjacent to it to the northward, is reported upon in Appen4ix 3 of the Report for l 902, entitled " Triangulation in Kansas." The reconnais.sance from the stations Arlington and Sunflower, in southern Kansas, to the Rio Grande had been

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

made by Assistant Stehman Forney in 1898 and 1899. Six of the seven bases necessary to control the lengths along the triangulation from the Anthony base to the Rio Grande were measured by the party under Mr. A. L. Baldwin in 1900.* The only base remaining to be measured is the one at the extreme southern end of the arc near the Rio Grande. The triangulation party of 1902 in eight months of field work extended the triangulation from the vicinity of the Anthony Base to the Lampasas Base, in central Texas. No astronomic determinations hav~ been made along the arc so far completed, sa,·e one determination of longitude made in advance of the triangulation and for a special purpose. Hence no part of the arc is available as yet for the determination of the figure of the earth. It is believed that the astronomic observations can be made more economically by special parties than by the triangulation parties during the progre~ of their work. Several different members of the Computing Division and several field officers temporarily assigned to the Computing Division have taken part in the preparation of this appendix. Mr. M. H. Doolittle, assisted by Miss L. J. Harvie, made all the difficult least square adjustments.
THE PARTY OF 1902.

The field organization of 1902, all under the direction of Assistant William Bowie, consisted of a building party, two observing parties, and five light-keepers. The building party consisted of three carpenters and three hands, under the direction of Signalman J. S. Bilby, a man of long experience in the building of signals. The equipment and work of this party will be treated later under the heading ''Signals and their Constn1ction.'' The first observing· party consisted of Assistant William Bowie as observer and in charge of the whole work of the organization, a foreman in charge of the camp and aiding the party in various other ways, a recorder, a driver, and a cook. The equipment of the party consisted of the necessary instruments and camp outfit of tents, bedding, cooking utensils, etc., a heavy covered spring wagon and two horses.
The chief of party, foreman, and recorder traveled in this wagon on the moves between stations and carried the instruments and observing tent.s. They usually reached the new station and had the signal ready for observing before the freight wagons arrived. The outfit weighed about 4 ooo pounds, and was carried in tltree farn\ wagons hired for each trip from farmers ·or ranchmen living near the signals.t

The. second observing party, in direct charge of Assistant 0. W. Ferguson, who acted ouserver, was similar in organization to the first observing party except that it contained no foreman. '' 'I'he outfit was practically the same as that of the first observing party, but slightly lighter in weight. Only two freight teams were necessary." The work of the two observing parties were similar, except that Assistant Bowie, of the first observing party, being in charge of the whole organization, which was scattered widely, and being responsible for all accounts, had a heavy correspondence to be

as

*See Appendix 3, Report for 1901: "On the Measurement of Nine Bases along the Ninety-eighth Meridian.'' tThis quotation, as well as many others which follow, is from the season's report by Assistant William Bowie, a concise and admirable statement of the season's operations, which has been utilized to a much greater extent in the preparation of this report than is indicated by the quotations from it.

attended to in addition to the other office work of the party. Mr. Bowie recommends that when another double party is organized an additional man be placed in the first observing party to aid in this office work, and that a foreman be added to the second observing party. The corps of light-keepers consisted of five men. Their work will be. described later under the heading ''The Light-keepers.'' The parties were organized at Bowie, Tex., early in March, 1902, and progressed northward toward Anthony, Kans., which was reached by the building party in July and the observing party in August. As soon as the connection with the work of the preceding season, neat Anthony, had been completed the parties returned to Bowie, Tex., and progressed southward until the Lampasas Base was reached in October by the building party and in November by. the observing party. Operations were commenced at Bowie, Tex., rather than at Anthony for the sake of keeping the party in more favorable weather than would otherwise have been encountered. The building party and equiJ?ment arrived at Bowie, Tex., early in March, and the building of signals was begun on March 10. It completed its work ·and disbanded at Lampasas, Tex., on October 3. Between these dates, in an interval of less than seven mon~hs. the signalman and his party of six built 70 double observing towers or signals of an average height to the instrument of 42 feet ( 1 3 meters) distributed over the whole length of the belt of triangulation 444 miles ( 715 kilometers), had revised the reconnaissance in certain regions where such revision was found to be desirable, and had placed the permanent station marks in position at the triangulation stations. Assistants Bowie and Ferguson, the two observers, arrived at Bowie, Tex., on March 10. They finished the organization of the observing parties and reached their first stations, the ends of the Bowie Base, on March 17. Between that date and October 25, an interval of but little more than seven months, they made complete horizontal and vertical angle observations at 75 primary statio·ns and at several secondary stations, thus extending the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridan 6° 27 1 , or 444 miles ( 7 I 5 kilometers) to the southward from its former limit. Their parties were disbanded at Lampasas, Tex., le5s than eight months after their arrival at Bowie, Tex., in the spring.
THE ll!ETHODS OF 1902.

All of the angle measures were made by the direction method. Each series of observations consists of successive paintings on the various stations in order, from left to right, with corresponding readings of the horizontal circle with three micrometer microscopes, followed immediately by pointings on the same stations in the reverse order after reversing the position of the horizontal axis of the telescope in the wyes and turning the alidade 180° in azimuth, each pivot remaining in contact with the same wye as before. Each observation of an angle consists therefore of two paintings on each station involved, one in each positioll of the telescope, together with the corresponding 'micrometer readings, 24 in all, both a forward and a backward reading of each micrometer being made in each of its positions. Mr. Bowie used direction theodolite No. 167, and Mr. Ferguson No. 168. These are duplicate instruments of the same type that had been in use since 1899 on the ninetyeighth meridian triangulation. These instruments are fully described in Appendix 8

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

of the Report for 1894, entitled, "Notes on some Instruments recently made in the Instrument Division of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.'·' These theodolites each carry a horizontal circle 30 centimeters ( 12 inches) in diameter graduated to 5 minute spaces and read directly by three micrometer microscopes to single seconds. The clear aperture of the telescope is 61 millimeters (2.4 inches) and its focal length 74 centimeters (29 inches). Each observer made all paintings for horizontal angles by using two parallel vertical lines in the diaphragm of the telescope, placed so as to subtend a horizontal angle of about 20 seconds. The center of the image pointed upon was placed as nearly as possible midway between the two lines. This arrangement of lines in the telescope is not new, having been used for many years,* as well as the oblique cross. It is believed that the triangulation of I902 furnishes strong evidence in favor of the use of such parallel vertical lines. In brief, it is claimed that when all cotiditions as to brightness are favorable to accurate pointing the same accuracy is obtained with the parallel vertical lines as with the oblique cross, the difficulty of bisecting accurately by eye an interval of nearly 20 seconds being more apparent than real; that with an extremely bright image of a heliotrope or light the lines of a cross are apt to disappear or be apparently burned off near the image, but the parallel lines under these conditions remain apparently undisturbed; that in making pointings in the darkness upon au extremely faint image of a light, the very faint illumination necessary to make the lines visible will cause the image of the light to disappear or nearly disappear <when an attempt is made to secure a pointing by placing the image pointed on very near the intersection of the oblique cross, but the illumination of the parallel lines under the same conditions will produce comparatively little effect upon the faint image nearly ro seconds away; and therefore in both these ~ifficult cases better pointings will be secured with the parallel vertical lines than with either of the other arrangements, and in some cases good observations will be obtained with the parallel lines when observations with the other arrangement would be impossible. It was necessary to elevate the instrument considerably above the ground at nearly every station. Two reasons led to a decision to build a low signal even at the stations from which observations could have been taken at the height of the observer's eye above the ground. The observing tents used to shelter the instrument and described later in this report, in connection with the signals, were designed to fit on the outside of and be supported by the framework of the outer tower or scaffold. Either a special tent or a special framework would have been necessary if the observations were taken with the observer upon the ground. It was also believed that the elevation of the instrument a few feet, so as to lift the lines of sight above the lower strata of air, in which the more erratic refraction occurs in the immediate vicinity of the station, would increase the accuracy of the observations and lengthen the daylight observing period. The minimum elevation of the instrument was therefore 1 r feet (3.4 meters), the signals in these cases being one section high. The average height of instrument above the ground for the season was about 39 feet (I I. 9 meters). The maximum elevation was 75 feet (23 meters). The lights and heliotropes were usually

shown from a fixed table 5 feet ( r.5 meters) above the instrument. The maximum height of a light above the ground occurred at station Burson, 138 feet (42 meters), the light at this station being placed far above the instrument, as it was discovered, after the height of the instrument had been fixed by building the signal, that one line of sight was obstructed. The following extracts from, and comments upon, the general instructions under which the observers acted will ·serve to indicate the more important features of the methods of observation. The first paragraph of the general instructions reads:
In making the measurements of horizontal directions you will measure each direction in the primary scheme sixteen times, a direct and reverse reading being consi<lered one measurement, and sixteen positions of the circle· are to be used, corresponding approximately to the following readings upon the initial signal:

When a broken series is observed the missing signals are to be observed later in connection with the chosen initial, or with some other one, and only one, of the stations already observed in that series.

In regard to the positions specified in these instructio~1s 1 it is important to note three points: 1. In each of the. four groups of four positions each, the readings of the three microscopes on the circle corresponding to pointings on the initial station will be nearly uniformly spaced at intervals of approximately 15° over the whole 360°, and therefore the mean values of the angles from each group of four positions will be but little affected by periodic errors of graduation. In connection with this statement it is necessary to keep in mind that, during each measure, the alidade is turned 180° between the direct and reverse readings when the position of the telescope is changed, and therefore the three microscopes which are at intervals of 120° furnish readings at nearly uniform intervals of 60° during each measure. 2. In each group of four positions the micrometer readings corresponding to the initial station, and therefore those corresponding to each station, are nearly uniformly distributed over the 51 interval covered by the micrometer. The effect of this is to insure that if corrections for run are applied, the algebraic sum of such corrections for each micrometer corresponding to pointings on each station will be nearly zero. In other words, the mean value of any angle from observations in four positions uncorrected for run is almost independent of the run. No corrections for run a,re necessary for observations made under these instructions and considerable time is thereby saved in the computation. 3. No microscope ever returns for pointings on a given station to any position on the circle which it has formerly occupied. When the observations in sixteen positions have been completed the circle has been read at ninety-six points scattered over the

822

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

whole circle at intervals which are each either 4° or about 3°. This insures that the mean value of each angle from sixteen positions is still more completely freed from the effect of periodic errors of graduation than are the means from the separate groups of four positions each. The requirement as to the observations on missing signals is such that no local adjustment of the observations is necessary, and the computation is much simpler than would be the case if this requirement were not adhered·to. During the season of 1902 four observations were made on secondary stations, and from secondary stations, with the circle in the first four positions specified, and two complete observations were made on tertiary stations with the circle in positions 1 and 3. The second paragraph of the general instructions reads:
In selecting the conditions under which to observe primary directions you should proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of a single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds and that the average closing e'\"ror shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a.greater accuracy than that indicated.

It should be noted that the observer is directed in this paragraph not to select the conditions under which to observe with reference to the appearance of the object. According to the spirit of this direction, the observer is not to decline to observe because the image of a heliotrope on which he is attempting to point is, large, say 20 seconds in diameter, or vibrating irregularly through a range of, say, ro seconds, nor to decline to observe upon a light at night because it is very faint or very diffuse or apparently dancing about irregularly. On the contrary, he is to take observations upon such images, and if he finds that the triangles close ·within the required limit he is to continue to so -0bserve. I:Ie is to gauge the difficulties of the poi11tings which are allowable solely by the resulting closing errors and not by the appearance of the image in the telescope, nor even by the range of the observations secured. This paragraph in the instructions· is based upon the idea that in general difficult poiutings are accompanied by an increase -0f accidental errors, which is unimportant, but that in general systematic or constant errors, which are the really serious errors in triangulation, are no more likely to be encountered in such pointings than in those made under apparently favorable conditions. The effect of a conscientious adherence to the spirit of this paragraph is to lead an observer to observe under a greater variety of conditions than he otherwise would, and to lengthen his available daily observing period by commencing observations comparatively early in the afternoon. A portion of the ninth paragraph of the instructions reads:
Vertical measures are to be made at each primary station on each primary station upon which horizontal measures are made. These vertical measures should be made on as many days and nights as possible during the occupation of the station, but in 110 case should the occupation of the station be prolonged in order to secure such measures. A single measure, with the telescope in both the direct and reversed positions, on each day or night is all that is requirea. These measures tnay be made in daylight between l i.30 a. m. and 4.30 p. m. or in t.he darkness not less than two hours after sunset. * * *

It was known that during the season of 1902 the stay at each station would be brief. The limited evidence available seemed to the writer to indicate that night observations of vertical angles during the hours indicated in the instructions would be of a grade of accuracy not very different from the day observations. It was, therefore,

823

believed to be wise, since . daylight observations would probably be secured on but few days at a station, to take night observations to supplement them. This proved to be a mistake, for it was found that the night observations of vertical angles were of so low a degree of accuracy, apparently on account of irregular refraction, as to be of very little value. A single measure of a vertical angle during any one observing period on a day was considered to be substantially as good as more, since it was well known that the principal errors in trigonometric leveling are those due to irregular refraction. These refraction errors would not be reduced appreciably by additional obsenrations soon after the first one and before the conditions as to refraction had been given much time to change. According to Mr. Bowie's report for the season:
The daily programme was to begin observing vertical angles at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, on the heliotropes if showing, otherwise on some part of the signals when they were visible. Vertical angles were usually taken between 3 and 4 o'clock, but sometimes it was necessary to take them on the tertiaries after the air became steady enough to make paintings. As soon as the vertical angles were finished the vertical circle was replaced by the theodolite and the measurement of primary horizontal directions begun, if the heliotropes were sufficiently steady. If not, it was usual to observe upon the tertiaries, and start on the primaries after the air became steady. A systematic search was made at each station for objects suitable for tertiary points, and directions were measured to every one which might possibly be observed.from another station. Observations were discontinued for the afternoon a short time before sundown, when the observers and light keepers went to their evening meal. Primary horizontal directions were begun for the night about an hour after sundown and continued until 10.30 or II p. m., when the theodolite was replaced by the vertical circle. Vertical angles were then measured on all lights showing. This completed the work for the day, although sometimes after the vei:tical angles were taken the theodolite was again put up and horizontal observations continued. The light keepers left the lights burning upon going from the towers at I 1.30, and it was possible to observe to a much later time if so desired.

No attempt was made to secure morning observations. Th,e parties found that during the early hours of the day and until 3 p. ~n. they were kept sufficiently busy with correspondence, computations, and other miscellaneous business. Among the somewhat novel features of this season's work which are worthy of special mention are the following: 1. Practically all primary observations were made either on heliotropes or lights. Some observations were made by pointing on the signals in daylight, but these were so few in number. as to be hardly worthy of consideration. In former primary triangulation in the United States the observations have usually been made upon poles, upon poles and heliotropes, upon heliotropes alone, or upon lights alone. The use of both lights and heliotropes, with the omission of all poles, has been comparatively rare and had not until 1902 been tried on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation. 2 .. The observers took more risks in 1902 in observing under conditions apparently unfavorable to accuracy than had been customary. These risks were taken in accordance with the spirit of the second paragraph of the instructions already quoted. 3. The use of both heliotropes and lights, together with the practice of observing under apparently unfavorable conditions, made the possible hours of observing so long that curing much of the time in the field the rate of progress of the party was limited by the endurance of its members rather than by the weather conditions. The party spent its time trying to keep the necessary office work, the computations, and correspondence up with the observations rather than in wait\n.g for favorable weather.

82.a.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

4. There are 5 stations out of the 75 occupied at which all the primary observations were made on a single day. The writer knows of no similar cases in former primary triangulation in the United States. At 27 other stations of the 75, the primary observations were all made on two days. Even this has rarely occurred previous to 1902. 5. When the observations have iu the past been made in daylight, with the instrument mounted on a tower, it has been at times and hy some observers considered necessary to shelter the inner tower or tripod supporting the instrument from the sun and wind, in part at least, by screens of canvas or cloth supported by the outer tower. Mr. Bowie states in his report for the season thatNo signal screens were used during the season. The signal towers were very rigid, even in quite strong winds, and few days were lost on account of heavy vibrations. The records did not show any sii,'Jls of twist. The levels did not change materially during the observations, but i.t was noticed that they were slightly more unsteady during the day than at night.

As this is directly contradictory to past experience, about two days were spent by computers at the office in examining the records after the close of the season for evidence of twist. No convincing evidence that any systematic twist occurs could be found. Whatever twisting of the tripod head in azimuth occurs, if regular and continuous in one direction for considerable periods, is so slow as to be concealed by accidental errors in pointing and reading. There is possibly a, very irregular twisting, with frequent reversals or stops, the effect of which is to introduce errors of the accidental class into the i;esults which can not be separated from the other accidental errors. 6. The observers kept in communication with the light-keepers by the heliograph method, using the Morse alphabet and flashes of light from the heliotropes or lights. · This saved many days. for the party during the course of the season, as each observer virtually had a telegraph station always within sound of his voice and could give the light-keepers such orders within a few minutes of the completion of observations at a station as would enable them to move during the next day, when the observer was also moving, and to be ready to show to him at his next station as soon as he reached it. To depend upon the mail or ordinary telegraph messages, or upon sending a team to the light-keepers.. is an exceedingly slow process in comparison with the method used. 7. Observations of vertical angles were made at night as well as in the daytime. This, as shown later in this report, proved to be unsatisfactory.
THE NEW ACETYT,EN.B SIGNAL LAMPS.

The acetylene lamps used during this season on the ninety-eighth meridian were of a new design made in the Instrument Division of the Survey, and used for the first time on regular work 011 triangulation in South Carolina and Georgia, by Assistant W. B. Fairfield, early in 1902. The lamp itself is an ordinary acetylene bicycle lamp, modified for the particular use proposed by taking off the front door and substituting for the ordinary lens an optically good pair of condensing lenses. The particular lamp used is known in the trade as the "solar gas lamp, model i902." The condensing lenses were 5 inches in diameter. The accompanying illustration, No. r, shows more clearly than a description alone how the lamp and lenses are mounted. The lamp is held ill place behind the lens by a

APPENDIX NO. 4.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

bayonet joint, connecting it with the lens mounting. The center screw shown in the illustration is a wood screw, which is in the vertical plane with the center of the lens, and serves to hold the light down to the supporting table. A screw at the rear furnishes an adjustment in altitude, and the adjustment in azimuth is made by swinging the light on the table, it being supported by the rear screw and the rounded supporting points at the front of the mounting. The small tube shown above the lenses is used in pointing the lamp. It can be removed after the pointing is completed. One of the good features of the lamp is its portability. The lamp, with its mounting and accessories and a 5-pouµd can of carbide, can be packed in a box ~bout r6~ by 10~ by 7 inches, and so packed weighs but 21~ pounds. Assistant William Bowie says in his field report thatthe acetylene signal la]Ilp proved very satisfactory and had many advantages over the old oil signal lamp. It was more easily centered and pointed; it was constructed in such a manner that it could not be injured from overheating; there was no possibility of the tower be~ng burned; it was cleaner and more easily cared for; the flame was steadier and not affected materially by wind; and the lamp could not get out of order ea:!ily. Its only disadvantages were that it required recharging several times each night, and it was more complicated than an oil si~nal lamp.

The correspondence with the field parties shows that the additional complication did not cause any difficulty in securing reliable results when trained light-keepers were used throughout the season, as on the ninety-eighth meridian, but was troublesome when the lights were placed in the hands of untrained· men as in South Carolina a1td Georgia. It should be noted perhaps th~t these lamps must not be boxed up. They must · be used entirely in the open, in order that there may be a free circulation of air to keep the lamps sufficiently cool. Under these conditio~s there is little doubt that they are much safer than oil lamps, which are affected by wind and will usually burn higher after they become thoroughly warmed up than when first lighted. The observers reported that as compared with the oil lamps it was noticeable that while the image in the telesc<_:>pe from the oil _lamp gradually disappears under difficult conditions on very long lines by becoming a faint diffused blur, under the same conditions the light from this lamp sometimes became an exceedingly small intense point of light, and finally disappeared by becoming too small and faint to be observed. In this respect the light seems to be a decided improvement over the oil lamps formerly used. The light was found to be sufficiently powerful for the lines on which it was used in 1902, varying in length on the ninety-eighth meridian from 5 to 51 kilometers. A small, well-made reflector was placed behind the flame, but experience indicates that this reflector is of little importance, as sensibly the same amount of light proceeds to the distant station with a tarnished and smoked reflector as with a bright reflector.
THE LIGHT-KEEPERS.

The following quotations from Mr. ;Bowie's report for the season show what was required of the light-keepers:
The corps of light-keepers consisted of 5 men. Each man was provided with a tent, bedding, a small cooking outfit, and two heliotropes and two lamps. They were paid $55 per month each, and moving expenses, but furnished their own board. At most of the stations the light-keepers wer.: able

827

to get their meals with a farmer or ranchman. They made their moves between stations in farm wagons. Horizontal directions and vertical angles were measured both day and night, and between the hours of 3 and Ir 30 p. m. Heliotropes were used until sundown, and signal lamps at night. The light-keepers were required to start showing heliotropes promptly at 3 o'clock, and a few minutes before sundown the heliotropes were replaced by the lamps, which were lighted at once if the man in charge expected any delay in preparing or going for his evening meal; otherwise the lamps were started about one hour after sundown, which was the usual time for beginning the night observations. A light-keeper was required to watch his lamps and keep them burning brightly. In order to do this he went on the tower each half hour until IO o'clock. He stayed on the tower continuously from this time until n.30 p. m., which was the usual period for the observers to signal the light-keepers. The corps of light-keepers was organized and trained at Bowie, Tex., while the outfits were being prepared, but for various reasons only two of them remained with the party through the season. \Vhenever a light-keeper left the party or was discharged the man acting as driver in the first observing party would take his place, and his training in camp proved most valuable to him as a light-keeper. Having been with an observer, he realized the necessity of promptness, accuracy, and close attention to his duties. There was no change in the force of light-keepers after the 1st of July. The light stand, 3 feet square, was of ample proportions for posting heliotropes and lights to the two observers, except in rare cases where the angle between the lines was very acute. This difficulty was overcome by placing the heliotrope and light to one observer on a board extended from the stand to the railing. The light-keepers posted their own lights and heliotropes during the entire season. At all stations occupied by an observer lines were accurately drawn on the light stand to each signal observed upon, and a light-keeper following had simply to use these lines. The stations ahead of the observers had no lines laid out, consequently the light-keepers had to use their ingenuity in finding the directions to the obsen·ers. This, however, did not prove very difficult, as each man was given a sketc}l of the reconnaissance, and by placing the sketch on the light stand and orienting it approximately by the meridian line, he was enabled to locate at least one of the signals. He would then orient the sketch accurately over this direction and lightly mark on the stand the directions to all of the stations as given by the sketch. He would then begin showing to the observers. If he did not get lights from them in reply he would swing his heliotrope or lamp through a small angle to each side of the approximate direction. (The term "light" will be used hereafter to indicate either the heliotrope or lamp.) As soon as an observer saw a light from one of the stations ahead he showed a steady light, to enable the light-keeper to get a correct line. Most of the forward lines were found at night, as the lamps would show over a wider angle than the heliotropes. The work of finding the lines was greatly facilitated by the observers, who could usually locate the signals just before sundown the first day at a station; the lines would then be marked on the stand, and at night a lamp was posted to each forward light-keeper, who could then get his direction at once. The light-keepers were usually able to pick up some range, such as a lone or high tree, fence corner, or some other more or less prominent object, by which they could post their heliotropes, and also the lamps, if put up before dark. This method was preferable to simply using the lines drawn on light stand. Each observer would see more or less of the other's light at night when the angle was less than 25 degrees. This was prevented by placing a board on edge between the lamps to cut off the lateral rays.
THE SIGNAL CODE.

In order to facilitate the work, instructions _and messages were sent to the light-keepers and between the observers by flashing with the lights. The Morse alphabet was used and a simple code was made out which covered most of the communications. The numerals were spelled out, as they were so seldom employed. Copies of the Morse alphabet and code were given each light-keeper and each member of the observing parties, and they were requfred to commit them to memory. After a very short time this was satisfactorily accomplished by all. No' general rule could be adopted in regard to the length of the dots and dashes used, as they varied with the iellgth of line and the strength of the light. But their lengths were such that.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, I903. they were easily distinguishable, and the space between words was J11ade much longer than the spaces between the elements of a word. The following are the rules and code messages used on the field: SIGXAI~'> A~D :METHODS TO Ill<; L'SED BY AI,L. Call by your initial, repeated until answered. Answer a call by a series of slow dots.

Occasionally one observer communicated with the other observer through a light-keeper. The observers often called up a light-keeper at night, before IO o'clock, by simply showing him a light. Then he would answer when he came on the tower to investigate his lamp, as mentioned previously. The chief of party kept the second observer and the light-keepers fully advised by mail as to their movements and those of the other members of the party, and this, while making the office work heavy, added considerably to the progress of the work. ' Five men as light-keepers were just the number necessary in the party. All of them were kept busy continually, and an extra man was only necessary in the base nets, when usually the driver of the first observing party would act as light-keeper at one end of the base. The usual scheme of placing the light-keepers was to have two ahead of the observers and two behind them, with the fifth man at the central station of a figure, or at any other place where he was needed. Each of the observers took a side of the scheme of triangulation, and never crossed over between bases. The same was nearly always true with regard to the light-keepers. The forward light-keepers moved to the next stations ahead, and the ones in the rear came up to the points left by

829

the observers. The observers were usually directly across the scheme from each other, and if they moved forward the same day each station to be observed upOI1\1(1?Uld have a light-keeper, but when they did not move at the same time, and in the base nets, an observer often finished on one station the first or second day of observations and signalled the man to a station without a keeper. Many delays were prevented in this way. ·· Carbide was distributed by the observers, who left it with the owner of the property at a station for the light-keeper following. The forward men would wait for the observers to come up to them to get their supply, unless they could be supplied by express or freight. A man to be a good light keeper must have education enough to keep his accounts, but what is most essential is a practical turn of mind which will enable him to overcome difficulties and get his lights posted in spite of floods, breakdowns, etc.; of course it goes without saying that he must be conscientious and faithful. lJnless a man shows the above qualities it is not advisable to keep him in the party longer than is required to get another man.
SIGNALS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.

The signals built during the season of 1902 and the method of their construction are especially interesting because the signals served their purpose well and were erected at an extremely low cost, and with great rapidity. On these signals observations of the required degree of accuracy were obtained without the use of any canva.> or doth screens on the outer tower to protect the inner one from sun· and wind. The service required of the signals in 1902 1 or when used by similarly organized double observing parties, is, briefly, that the outer tower must support the observer and the tent which p;otects him and his instrument from the sun and wind, and must at the same time and without interference with the observer or his work support a lightkeeper and the lights or heliotropes; and that the inner tower must support the instrument with such stability that its motion iii azimuth shall never be so rapid or irregular as to seriously affect the accuracy of the measurements of angles, its disturbance in level never so rapid as to inconvenience the observer by makiqg frequent adjustments necessary, and its vibration due to wind must seldom be so great as to interfere seriously with accurate pointing. These signals must, moreover, be ~trong enough to stand without injury in all ordinary winds and in most stonns. It would be poor practice to build them so strong as· to withstand the most violent stonns. The success attained in 1902 in building rapidly and at small cost signals which sathfy these conditions is due largely to the genius and energy of Mr_. Jasper S. Bilby, Signalman, in charge of the signal-building party, from whose written report on the work of the season the following description of the signals and .method of their construction is adapted: For convenience, the inner tower, which supports. the instrument and has three legs, is called the tripod; the outer tower, having four legs and supporting the observer and light-keeper, is called the scaffold; and the whole structure, comprising both towers, is called a signal. A completed signal 60 feet high to the instrument is shown in illustration 2. In the following general directions the various steps in the process in framing and erection of such a signal are given in approximate order of time, it being understood that at times two or more processes are going on at the same time. The first step is the framing of the tripod legs and of one side of the tripod, with all the material lying on the ground. In illustration 3, A is a pattem used in making the scarfs; B shows the positions in which the timbers are laid before the work of framing begins; C shows the scarfs cut; D shows one leg nailed together. All

scarfs are nailed togetqer except on unusually tall signals, as indicated later. E shows the leg chamfered ready for framing . Illustration 4 shows tripod legs Nos. 1 and 2 with two of the horizontal ties in position, the legs being in such a position that the chamfers which form a bearing surface for the ties and diagonals are horizontal. The chamfers as seen in this position are cut 1 3{ inches back from the corner on the top and 2 Yz inches on a side and are 2 feet long, and are marked with chamfer patterns. In framing the first side of the tripod cut the bottom first horizontal tie to the length given in illustration 4, or the table on p. 839, place the two legs to be framed in the position shown in illustration 4, and nail on the first and second ties G and H . The length of the horizontal tie G is such that for a 60-foot tripod the legs, when

straight, will be about 8 feet apart at the top, as shown by illustration 4. For tripods of other heights the distance apart at the top when the legs are straight will vary with the height, and is to be fixed by the judgment ·of the builder as to the amount of the curvature to be put into the legs. Then draw the upper ends of the two legs toward each other, thus putting a bend into each one of them, and nail on the successive ties from the bottom upward with the legs in this bent position : The lengths of all ties above· G are to be such as to give the legs the desired bend. When the tie 5 feet from the top is nailed on, the tops of the two legs should meet, as shown in illustration 5. The distance along the legs to each horizontal tie is reckoned from zero at the top. Each panel must then be squared, by using a steel tape, to make the two diagonals of the pane! equal in

its proper position face the top of side No. 1, and face the triangulation station when laying it down. This will bring each piece right end to when it is picked up and sent aloft. The holes for the foundation are laid off, and stakes for holes driven as shown by the ground plan in illustration 6. For locating the holes it is convenient to use a small theodolite and a steel tape. The angles shown on illustration 6 are counted from zero at the foot of the tripod leg No. 3. The holes for the tripod legs and the scaffold legs are to be made 3 feet wide, 3Yz feet long, and 3Yz to 4 feet deep. Spend no time in bringing the bottoms of the holes accurately to the same level, but after they are dug and the tripod foot plates set, take a round of levels, either with a carpenter's level or leveling instrument, using foot-plate No. 3 as a bench mark; then cut legs Nos. 1 and 2 to correspond with the differences of elevation found, No. 3 having been already cut to the exact length shown by illustration 5. Do not delay raising tripod No. 7. by waiting for the holes for scaffold. They can be dug after the tripod is raised. Use the lower horizontal tie at the No. 3 tripod leg for a bench mark, it being exI actly 4Yz feet above its foot-plate, and take a round of levels on the scaffold foot-plates. Cut off each scaffold leg as much above or below the 4 Yz -foot mark already on it as the corresponding foot-plate is above or below No. 3 tripod foot-plate as shown by the levels. The foot-plates are 2 by 12 inches, and 3 feet long. They should be carefully ,set so that the legs w111 rest near the center, and so as to have a firm Firs t s ide of tripod being raised. bearing on the ground. One or more sections of a leg of the scaffold may be used as a derrick for raising a side of the tripod. The derrick should be about two-thirds the height of the side of the tripod to be raised. Posts for guys should be set as shown in illustration 6, A and B being the positions of the posts for the back guys, C and E for the side guys, and D for the forward guy. Fon the ground plan represents the position of the top of the derrick when la.id out ready for raising, and G the foot of the derrick. Before raising the derrick put on the side guys and make them fast to the posts at C and E, leaving about 2 feet of slack. A double fall or winch tackle should be used for the back guy to B. Before beginning to raise the derrick put on the hoisting tackle so that it will be ready for use when the derrick is up. One set of guys will do for a derrick 40 feet high, but two sets of guys should be used for one that is higher. The posts for guys should be either 4 by 4 inches or an equivalent size of round timber. For high signals where there is doubt about the back guy holding, or in any

case in which there is uncertainty as to any guy holding on account of soft ground, a double guy post should be used. The second post is to be placed behind the first, and is to hold a short guy attached to the top of the forward or main guy post 2 feet or more above the ground to prevent iLfrom being drawn fonvard. The strain is then put on the forward guy post as near to the surface of the ground as possible. Start the derrick up by using props, and then raise with the back guy fall. Let the derrick rake back about 4 feet, so that when the heavy strain comes the derrick will stand about vertical, as shown in illustration 7. Before raising the tripod, cleat the legs, using strips 1 by 4 by 16 inches. Drag side No. 1 of the tripod back with the hoisting fall of the derrick until the feet come to the edge of the tripod holes Nos. 1 and 2, as shown on the ground plan, illustration 6. Put the bridle rope on about one-third the distance down from the top of the derrick. Fasten two guys to the side of the tripod to lead backward and two forward, fastening these guys near the bridle rope. Place the hoisting lines one on each tripod leg near the top before commencing to hoist it up. Hook the hoisting tackle in the bridle rope and take the loose end of the fall to the winch or to the rear end of the wagon, as the case may be. If horses can be used for the hoisting the work is much easier than raising with the winch. A good pair of horses will raise one side of any signal up to 90 feet in height, using a double fall. Illustration 7 shows the derrick and side No. 1 of a 60-foot tripod being raised to position. When side No. 1 of the tripod is in a standing position and the backward and forward guys made fast to the posts B and D, the hoisting tackle should be taken off of No. 1 side, overhauled, and used in raising the third leg of the tripod. For the third leg three guys are required, one each to posts C, D, and E, shown on the ground plan, illustration 6; a hauling line is made fast near the top and the leg raised to its final position. Next .put on the horizontal ties on sides 'Nos. 2 and 3 of the tripod, two men working aloft, while two men below send the timbers up in their proper order, using the hauling lines. At the top the tripod head is to be made very rigid by planking up the top 3 feet of the tripod with 2 by 12 plank. When the tripod is completed nail the feet to the foot plates and put on the anchors. 'fo construct the anchors, take tv.:o pieces 2 by 4 inches by 3 feet long, spike them to the foot of the leg, one on each side, and parallel to each other; fill in with earth to a level with the top of the anchor, then nail two more pieces of the same size at right angles to the first two. Lay boards or ai1y other pieces 2 or 3 feet long across the top of the lower pieees, and after filling earth level with the second set of anchors shorter blocks may be laid on them. This construction makes an anchor platform about 3 feet square. Fill the holes to the top, keeping the earth well tamped. All the legs of both the tripod and scaffold are to be anchored in this manner.
'l'HE FRAMING OF THE SCAFFOLD.

Begin by scarfing and splicing the legs in the same manner as descriiJed above for the tripod. Mark the lines for the horizontal ties as shown by illustration 8. Lay out legs Nos. 3 and 4 on the forward side of the tripod and legs Nos. 1 and 2 on the rear side. The bottom horizontal tie and the top floor tie are to be cut to the length given on the working plan, illustration 8, and nailed on in their places as there

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

indicated. As the intermediate horizontal ties are nailed on, force each leg out so as to give it the desired bend. Tht! amount of bowing or bending is to be put in by estimation and may be directed by the foreman, No. 8 · standing at one end of the side being framed and directing the men as they '1iail on the ties. After the ties 0' Stand f'or l:i9hU1 are nailed in position they should be sawed off even with the outer side of the legs. Next, square each panel, commencing at the bottom by making its two diagonals measure the same, using a steel tape, and nail the dhif,onals in position. It should be . n~ticed that none of the horizontal ·ties except the one at the top and bottom are cut to measure, and no measures are necessary to fix the lengths of the diagonals. When the framing of the first side of the scaffold has been completed, cut the horizontal ties. and diagonals for the other three sides, by using this first side as a pattern. Side No. 3 may be framed fully before raising, as well as side No. 1.
.-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~----,

RAISING THE SCAFFOLD.

Send the hoisting tackle to the top of the tripod, as shown in illustration 9, ready for raising the scaffold. Make the bridle rope fast on one leg of the side to be raised, hook the hoisting tackle in it, and tum the side of the scaffold over so that 'tht! ties and diagonals will be on the under side; illustration 9 shows this operation of turning over. Next make the bridle rope fast for raising the side. When the two sides are raised to their final position let two cu.t Z 'Z <f't:. men go aloft and nail on the ties and 70.'60 diagonals, while t\vo men below send them up in their order, first taking one Side of 6o-foot scaffold. . panel on one side, and then shifting to another side, and so on to the top. The legs may now be. anchored down and the necessary floors and ladders constructed to complete the scaffold, as shown in illustration 2.

The lower floor of the scaffold is at the height indicated in illustration 8, and the tripod cut off to the exact height required by the observer. The upper floor is placed 3 feet below the top of the scaffold in position to support the light tender. The table 3 by 3 feet is constructed at the top of the scaffold and at its center for support. ing the lamps and heliotropes. Two trap doors should be made in the lower floor, one where the ladder comes up and the other in another corner of the floor, to be used in hoisting the instrument; the latter trap door should be placed at leg No.9. No. 3 or No. 4 of the scaffold. The wall of the observing tent is a strip of canvas 4.6 feet wide reaching around the outside of the scaffold with the two ends overlapping at one corner; the bottom of the wall is made fast to the lower floor with loops over nails driven in the floor. The top of the wall is made fast to the horizontal tie on the scaffold 5.3 feet below its top in the same manner: The roof of the tent is a tarpaulin which fits over the top floor and carries four canvas curtains which overlap at the four corners of the scaffold and also overlap the wall of the tent, Turning side of scaffold over. and may be tied to it. The space of 7 feet between the top and lower floor of the scaffold is thus inclosed, furnishing to the observer a room 9 by 9 feet on the floor. The tent requires no poles or extra timbers for its support.
DESIGNS OF SIGNALS OF VARIOUS HEIGHTS.

In the case of an obstructed liue, on whi~h the obstruction is not discovered until the towers have been built, the difficulty may be overcome by building up a superstructure,* such as was constructed on the top of a 66-foot signal at station Burson, shown in illustration 10. The lamps and heliotropes were posted on the top of the superstructure, while the instrument was used at a point about 66 feet above the ground on top of the tripod. The superstructure in this case was of the same type as the scaffold for 24 feet above its top. At that point the corner posts had approached so near to each other that the ·superstru.cture was 2 feet square. It was continued with that cross section to a point 48 feet higher. '1,'he horizontal ties were placed 4 feet apart. Two sides of the superstructure were framed on the ground in sections 12" feet long and hoisted to position with the hauling lines. The horizontal ties and diagonals for the other two sides were cut .from the first side as a pattern and hoisted
*This type of superstructure was designed by Mr. Jasper S. Bilby.

aloft with the hauling lines. Two sets of wire guys (No. 1 2 smooth wire) were put on the superstructure, one set at the top and the other set 24 feet lower. The guys were made fast to special posts set for the purpose. The light-keeper went up the inside of the superstructure and passed out to a seat constructed 2 feet below the table made for lights and heliotropes at the top of the signal. The superstructure proved to be sufficiently stable. This type of superstructure could safely be built to a height of 150 feet above a scaffold. For scaffolds of various heights the top porfion of the signal down to a point ro feet below the top is the same for all. The following table gives the lengths of the lower horizontal tie for tripods and scaffolds of various heights. The first column is the distance from the lower horizontal tie of the tripod to the top of the tripod as measured along the tripod leg.

These are the only dimensions fixed directly by measurement. The lengths of the intermediate horizontal ties and of all the diagonals are fixed as indicated in the preceding description of the process of framing and construction. The legs for the scaffolds are in each case 6 feet longer than the tripod legs. When a 10-foot tripod is used, let the diagonals of the scaffold reach from the bottom tie to the tie which is 5.3 feet below the top of the scaffold and is between the two floors. In all other respects the scaffolds and tripods of different heights correspond in design to those shown in illustrations 2 to 9. The list of material required for any height of signal can be determined quickly by making working drawings similar to those shown on illustrations 5 and 8 to scale and measuring off the lengths required on each side. For signals higher that\ 7 5 feet the design shown may be extended by putting on other sections at the bottom somewhat heavier than the lowest section of the 75-foot signal. Signals not ·greater than 90 feet in height may be framed and raised as described, and no bolts ueed be used. If the signal is more than 90 feet, a section 75 to 90 feet high may be raised as one piece and the higher sections must be framed with bolts and then raised to position and erected on top of the first section. It is sometimes found to be difficult to secure lumber of the dimensions called for by the foregoing plans, especially 6 by 6, s by 5, and 3 by 4 pieces. In such cases pieces of approximately the required dimensions have been built up by nailing together 2 by 6 pieces or 2 by 4 pieces. It is believed that the strength and stiffness of such a signal is about the same as that of the ordinary type. The cost is about the same, ahd delays may be frequently avoided by this plan.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

ADVANTAGES OF THE SLENDER TYPE OF SIGNALS.

Some of the points of advantage claimed for these slender signals over many of those formerly used on the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and especially over the broad ones described in Appendix 10, Report for 1882, "On the construction of observing tripods and scaffolds,'' are given below. The slender type was devised by F. W. Perkins, Assistant, in r 881. There is only about one-half as much lumber per vertical foot in the slender signals as in the broad. This not only reduces greatly the cost of the material required for a signal of given height and the cost of hauling the material, but also considerably reduces the cost of construction. Much less area is exposed to wind pressure for a signal of given height in the slender signals than in the broad ones, and therefore much less strength is needed. Much more important than this, however, is the fact that on account of the horizontal ties and diagonals, the relatively light pieces in the structure, being very much shorter in the slender than in the broad signals, the vibrations of these individual pieces due to the effects of the wind are much reduced. Such vibrations impart a tremor of short period and small amplitude to the instrument and also to the floor supporting the observer, which is likely to prevent observations in a strong wind long before there is any danger of collapse of the signal or any other troublesome motions on the part of the sign:=tl. The experience of 1902 indicates that observations may be continued in a stronger wind without screens on the slender signals than on the broad ones. The bowing of the legs of the slender towers during construction puts the posts and horizontal ties under a moderate initial strain which adds greatly to the stiffness of the structure and somewhat to its strength. As the observing tent used in 1902 is supported by the timbers of the tower and is really on the outside of the tower it leaves every part of the floor space available and makes it possible to work as comfortably on a 9 by 9 floor on the slender scaffolds as on a 12 by 12 floor on the broad ones with other styles of observing tent. ':I'his reduction in the size of the floor is important, as it allows a corresponding reduction in the size of the signal throughout its whole height. The second or upper floor and light table make it possible for the heliotroper or light-keeper to do his work without the slightest interference with the observer, and to show his lights or heliotropes mounted directly over the statio11 while the observer is at work instead of eccentrically by several feet. The slender signals, although they contain much less lumber than the broad ones, and have a much smaller spread of base for a given height, are no more apt to collapse in a strong wind than the broad ones. Experience indicates that either type is sufficiently strong to make the lo5ses by collapse very small ..

THE BUILDING PARTY OF 1902.

The building party of 1902 was in immediate charge of the signalman and consisted of three carpenters and three hands. This party was sometimes divided into two subparties and work was done on two signals at once. The signalman was with one or the other of the subparties except when arranging for the purchase and delivery of lumber, or when revising the reconnaissance or testing doubtful lines. Besides the regular force extra laborers were sometimes employed for short periods, amounting in all to about twenty days' labor for one mau each month. Each of the subparties was provided with two horses aud a. freight wagon for moving the men and outfit. The signalman was provided with a horse .and light spring wagon, which he found a great convenience, as his work of purchasing and arranging for the delivery of lumber and revising reconnaissance required frequent and rapid movements. The signal party depended upon the country for their meals. . The lumber for the signals was bought either by the carload from large dealers or in smaller quantities from the local dealers. In either case the signalman arranged with local teamsters to haul the lumber to the sites for the towers before the arrival of the building party. The signalman and his party of six between March IO and October 3, less than seven months, built 70 signals of an average height to the light table of 42 feet (13 meters), distributed over the whole belt of triangulation, 444 miles (715 kilometers) long, placed permanent station marks and reference marks in position at all stations, except a few which had already been marked, and made such revisions of reconnaissance as were found necessary.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

There were two· intervals during the season when the progress of the building was seriously interrupted. In April there were twenty days when little was accomplished, as a delay was caused by the failure of a carload of lumber to arrive. The car had broken down, and the local railroad officials could not for some time either locate the car or cause it to be forwarded. From June 28 to July I9 the building party was engaged in placing the station marks at three stations near Anthony, Kans., where signals had been erected in 1901, in opening the difficult line between stations Burson and Wingard, in erecting the high superstructures needed at these stations, and in making the long trip from the vicinity of Anthony, Kans., to the stations to the southward of the Bowie base net. If these two seasons of interruption to the building be omitted, and also the interval at the beginning of the season before the first serious interruption, when the party .was somewhat new to its work and the weather unfavorable, two periods remain during which the building party proceeded with comparatively little interruption and showed its skill. Commencing with the signal at station Duncan, 30 signals of the average height to the light table of 55 feet (I7 meters) were erected in 69 consecutive days, or at the rate of one in each 2.3 days. Similarly, commencing with the first signal erected south of Bowie base net and extending to the close of the building season, 29 signals of an average height of 40 feet ( I2 meters) were erected in seventy-two consecutive days, or at the rate of a new signal every 2.5 days., The distance which the building party had to travel between signals may be appreciated by consulting illustrations I I to I5 at the end of this appendix. As illustrating the rapidity with which the party did its work after arriving at a station, the material being already there, it may be stated that each of the 66-foot signals at Monument, Duncan, and Wingard (without superstructure) was erected in two days, and the 81-foot signal at McCoy was erected in three days. These high signals were erected by J. S. Bilby, Signalman, and three men. The cost of the signals ready for occupation by the observer was $3. 20 per vertical foot measured to the light table,* including the expenses of the building party even of transportation to and from the field, the cost of all material and all charges for hauling. It also includes the material for station and reference marks and the cost of putting them in place. The signalman estimates that the cost per vertical foot is nearly the same under the conditions encountered in 1902 for low signals as for high ones. The material costs more per vertical foot for high signals than for low ones, but in the former case the building party speilds a smaller percentage of its time in moving, and the hauling can be done at considerably less cost per ton.
PROGRAMME OP OCCUPATION' OP STATIONS.

In the following tables the stations occupied during 1902 by each of the two observers are arranged in the order in which they were occupied. The second column indicates the days on which observatiqns on primary stations were taken; the third column the number of such days; and the fourth column gives approximate height of the instrument above the ground. In using the heliotrope the light observed upon was placed about r .6 meters above the instrument. The exceptional cases occurred at stations Blue, Burson, and Wingard, at which the light was placed for certain· observations 8, 23, and r4 meters above the instrument, respectively.
*The average cost of the lumber used during this season, on the cars, or at the lumber yard, was about f,25 per 1000 feet.

TRIANGULATION ALONG NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

The weather conditions and conditions with respect to the topography, ease of access to stations, and ease of securing supplies, are not widely different in the various parts of the area to which this summary refers, and therefore the comparisons between various seasons of triangulation are especially interesting, as indicating the effects of the gradual changes in the plan of operations. It is obvious that there has been a gradual increase in the rapidity of the work from year to year, on both the northern and southern extension of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation, and that the observing was done much more rapidly in 1902 than during any previous season. As showing the extent to which the observations were delayed by unfavorable weather it is important to note the ratio of the number of observing days at a station to the total number of days at the station exclusive of the time before the first observation and after the last observation. This ratio was during 1902 for Mr. Bowie, 0.77, and for Mr. Ferguson, o. 80. For comparison it may be noted that this ratio was o. 78 for the first three groups in the above summary, and o.86 for the seasons of 1900 and 1901 on the triangulation to the southward. This furnishes strong evidence that the average weather conditions differed but slight}y over this whole region. It has already been shown* that the reduction of the number of observations from 34 to 16 saved about six days for .the party at each station, and the reduction from 24 to 16 about three days at each station. At the beginning of 1902 no change was made in the number of observations; it remained 16, as in 1900 and 19or. The column headed "Average number of days of observatio11s at a station" in the above summary shows, however, a considerable gain in rapidity in 1902 as compared with previous years. This was undoubtedly due largely to the fact that the use of lights at night, in addition to the ·heliot'"opes by day, greatly increased the length of the daily observing period. About 70 per cent of the primary observations in 1902 were made on lights at night. The.great increase in rapidity of the-triangulation in 1902 is not fully appreciated, however, until the promptness with which the party of 1902 appeared at the next station after closing observations at a given station is investigated. In 1900, Assistant F. D. Granger, on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation in Nebraska, occupied 11 stations with an average interval from the first to the last day of primary observations at each station of 6.3 days, an average interval from the last observation at one station to tl)e first at the next of 7. 2 days, including Sundays, delays on account of bad weather, taking down and putting up camp, and the moving between stations, and in some cases the building of signals; a total average period of 13. s days per station. This was the best season's record known to. the writer up to that time. In 1901 Assistant A. T. Mosman, on the ninety.eighth meridian triangulation southward in Kansas, occupied 14 stations. t The average length of stay at a station from the first to the last observation was 4 days; the average interval from the last observation at each station to the first at the next was 3. 7 days, or a total of 7. 7 days per station. The shortening of the period between stations by Mr. Mosman was probably due, in part at least, to the fact. that his signals were erected by a signalman

and party worki11g almost independently of the observing party, whereas Mr. Granger's signals were erected by the observing party or men detailed from it. In 1902 Assistant William Bowie occupied 40 primary stations, at which the average interval between the first and last observation at a station was 3.5 days; the average interval from the last observation at one station to the first observation at the next, 1.8 days, and the total period for each station was 5.3 days.* The corresponding figures for Assistant 0. W. Ferguson are, from first to last observation at station, 4. 7 days; from the last observation at one station to the first at the next, r.4 days, and the average total period per station, 6. 1 days. The great reduction made in 1902 in the time spent between stations is probably due in part to the use of comparatively light camps, but is mostly due to the promptness with which the light-keepers were informed of the proposed movements of the observers by the heliographic method, and the resulting promptness with which the light-keepers moved and established their lights in the new positions. If the last two months only of the season be considered, this being the period during which the party extended the triangulation southward from the Bowie base net, the showing is still more remarkable, and this is especially interesting as indicating the great advantage of keeping a party continuously in the field for a long period, for although the great gain in rapidity during the latter part of the season over the first part of the season was probably due in a small part to the more favorable weather conditions, a close examination of the work of the party shows plainly that it was due mostly to the skill which had been acquired by the observing parties and the lightkeepers. From the Bowie base net southward Mr. Bowie occupied 16 stations, at which the average interval from the first observation to the last at a station was 2 .4 days. The average interval between the last observation at a station and the first at the next was r .5 days, and the average total interval for a station 3.9 days. During ·this period Mr. Ferguson occupied 15 stations, at which the corresponding average inteni-als were 3. I, r.o, and 4. r days. The average length of move between stations by road was, during this time, for Mr. Bowie 23 miles and for Mr. Ferguson 32 miles. · The average rate of progress of each observer in 1902 was therefore during the last two months of the season about double that of the most rapid observing party of 1901, and much more than three times that of the most raJ?id observing party up to rgoo.
STATEMENT OF ADJUSTMENTS.

No local adjustments of directions were made hecause they have become unnecessary since the method of supplying missing observations in broken series specified in the first paragraph of the general instructions has been followed. (See p. 82 1.) The lengths and directions of the lines Rutherford-Miller and Miller-Fowler before the adjustments here set forth were commenced had been fixed by the adjustment published in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1902, "Triangulation in Kansas," and in which the observations of 1902 at stations Miller, Anthony Southeast Base, and Fowler had been utilized. --·-·-----------c--------------------·
*In these figures for 1902 the long move by rail and wagon in the midst of the season from.the vicinity of the Anthony Base to the southern edge of Bowie base net has, of course, been omitted.

The lengths of the Elreno, Bowie, Stephenville, and Lampasas bases, with which the triangulation of 1902 connected had been measured in .1900, and a full account of these base measures may be found in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1901, ''On the Measurement of Nine Base lines along the Ninety-eighth Meridian." The lengths of these bases, as they are published, depend in each case upon an estimated approximate elevation for one end of each base, as the precise levels connecting these bases were not completed when the report mentioned was prepared for the printer. During l 902 and the first three months of 1903 a precise level line southward from the Anthony Base connected with each of these four bases. Th.e resulting elevations for one end of each base and the length of the bases reduced to sea level are as follows:

The adjustments were made in four sections. The first section extends from the line Spradling-Indian to the line Burson-Wingard, and includes both the Bowie and the Elreno base nets. (See illustrations 12 and l 3.) It is important to note that the length equation in this adjustment extends from base to bas~ instead of from the border of one base net to the border of the adjacent base net, as has been the practice of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in general up to 1901.* The second section extends from the line Burson-\Vingard, fixed in length by the adjustment of the first section, to the lines Rutherford-Miller and Miller-Fowler, fixed in length and direction as a part of the Anthony base net, as indicated above. (See illustration 11.) The third section extends from the line Indian-Spradling, at the south edge of the Bowie base net, of which the length had already beeJ?. fixed by the adjustment of the first section, to the line Gibson-Gleason, at the south edge of the Stephenville base net. 'fhe length equation extends to the Stephenvnle Base. (See illustration 14.) The fourth section extends from the line Gibson-Gleason to the line May-Gabriel, at the south edge of the Lampasas base net. This adjustment includes the Lampasas base net and the length equation extends to the base. (See illustration 15.) In the following condition equations t4e numbers assigned to the directions correspond to those shown in illustrations 11 to 15. The number of a direction inclosed in parenthesis, thus ( 1), means the required correction to that direction. In each set of condition equations those which refer to closures of triangles are given first, those which refer to ratios of sides next, and the length equations last. In the side and length equations the absolute term is expressed in units of the sixth decimal place of logarithms.
*The advantages of the new method of adjustment are set forth on pages 372-373, Appendix 6, Report for 1901, "Triangulation northward alonir the ninety-eighth meridian."

The maximum correction to a direction in the first section adjusted was 1".40 to the direction from Myers to Blue. The maximum in the second section was o" .84 to the direction from Burson to Parnell; in the third section, o". 70 to the direction from Young to Gatlin; in the fourth section, o".60 to the direction from Gilmore to Gabriel. In the four sections in which the triangulation along the ninety-eighth meridian previous to 1902 was adjusted, the largest maximum correction in any section was 1".39, and the smallest.maximum correction for any section was o".62. Of the 46 sections of triangulation of which the statistics are given in this appendix, under the heading ''Accuracy and Economy," there were 14 for which the maximum correction was greater than 1 ".40, and only one for which it was less than o". 60, the extremes for 1902. The probable error of observed direction is

d=o.674J?:-~zr
in which -:Ev' is the sum of the squares of the corrections to directions and c is the number of conditions. The probable error for observed direction for each of the four sections is given below, preceded, for the purpose of comparison, by the corresponding values for other sections of triangulation in Kansas and Nebraska under the same general conditions .as to climate, topography, and length of line.

TRIANGULATION ALONG NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

As measured by this standard, the triangulation of 1902 was more accurate than the former triangulation in adjacent regions under similar conditions. The last section of 1902 has a smaller d (±0.23) than any other section involved in this comparison. So far as the writer knows there is but one other section anywhere in the Ui1ited States having so small a valued as this, namely, the Nevada-California section of the transcontinental triangulation (d=±c."23).

ACCURACY AS INDICATED BY CORRECTIONS TO ANGLES AND CLOSURES 01'' TRIANGLES.

The correction to each angle is the algebraic sum of the corrections to two directions. In order to make it possible to study the corrections to the separate angles, they are shown in the following table for every triangle in the primary scheme from the Anthony base net to the Lampasas Base, together with the error of closure of the triangles, the corrected spherical angles, and the spherical excess. The plus sign prefixed to the error of closure of a triangle indicates that the sum of the angles is less than 180° plus the spherical excess. The spherical excess is a convenient indication of the size of the triangle, since it is proportional to the area.

The maximum correction of any angle is 2".35 to the angle at Myers between Cube and Blue, in the section Bowie Base to Elreno Base. This angle involved the line of sight from Myers to Blue, which passed very near to the ground and over which the observations were difficult to secure.

The decrease in the average closure of a .triangle, and in the mean error of an angle, for each successive section is interesting evidence of the increasing skill of the observers. For comparison with triangulation under the same general conditions as to climate, topography, and length of line, it may be stated that for the seven sections, all wholly or in part in Kansas and Nebraska, the average closing error for the three sections in the transcontinental triangulation is o."9b, and for the four in the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation previous to 1902 is o. "67. Similarly for these three sections of the transcontinental triangulation the mean value of a is ±0.69, and for these four sections of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation it is ±0.46. As shown by the .first of these two standards the triangulation of 1902 is intermediat= in accuracy between the triangulation along the thirty-ninth parallel and that along the ninety-eighth meridian, made under similar conditions, and by the second standard slightly below even the first of these. It is interesting and important to note that the party of 1902 was not attempting to secure the highest degree of accuracy, but on the contrary had been directed to "proceed upon the assumption that the maximum speed consistent with the requirement that the closing error of the single triangle in the primary scheme shall seldom exceed three seconds, and the average closing error shall be but little greater than one second, is what is desired rather than a greater accuracy than that indicated.'" The average closing error ~f o."94 corresponds very closely with the second part of these specifications, and the fact that 3 triangles out of 143 had closing errors greater than 311 , corresponds with the first part. Each of these three triangles involved a line of sight which passed very near to the ground or to trees. ------------·------·----------· *One triangle closes exactly. t Weighted mean. 94--03--55

Of the 38 sections in this comparison of triangulation along the eastern oblique arc and the transcontinental triangulation, there is not one for which the average closing error is as small as for the section Stephenville-Lampasas of 1902, and only one, the Nevada-California section of the transcontinental triangulation, for which the mean error of an angle is less (a= ±0.11 42) than for the Stephenville-Lampasas section of the 1902 work. No attempt has been made to set forth the agreement of the separate measures of each direction as a criterion of accuracy, since it is well known that it is of little value for that purpose. A close agreement of the separate measures of a given direction is of little consequence, since such measures are usually subject to constant errors of considerable size which become evident as soon as the closures of the triangles are studied or an attempt is made to adjust the figure.
THE ACCORD OF BASES.

There are five bases which serve to fix the length in the triangulation of 1902, viz, the Anthony, Elreno, Bowie, Stephenville, and Lampasas bases .. The accord in length between each of these bases as measured and its value as computed from the triangulation through the adjacent triangles furnishes a valuable test of the accuracy of the triangulation. In solving the normal equations in each section of the figure adjustment the length equation was, as usual, assigned to the last place, so that the discrepancy in length, after all the conditions relating to closures of triangles and ratios of lengths had been satisfied, became known. In the following table the discrepancies developed between bases in 1902 are given in terms of the seventh decimal place of logarithms and are also expressed as ratios. A plus sign before the discrepancy expressed in the terms of logarithms means that the first base mentioned is longer as measured than as computed through the intervening triangulation from the se.cond base mentioned. There is also given for comparison in the table the discrepancies between bases of the three sections of the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation completed before 1902.

Five out of the nine discrepancies in the transcontinental triangulation are greater than the maximum for 1902, the greatest being 169 in the seventh place of logarithms. There is but one section of the transcontinental triangulation for which the discrepancy is less than that between the Anthony and Elreno bases in 1902.
A STUDY
01~

ERRORS.

The work of 1902 furnishes an unusually good opportunity of testing the results of two widely different ways of making pointings and readings. Mr. .Ferguson's habit was to make very careful and deliberate pointings. He always studied each pointing for a moment after he believed it to be perfect and corrected it, or watched it still longer if he found it apparently changing. Mr. Bowie made his pointings equally carefully, but with much greater rapidity, and as soon as a pointing seemed perfect he proceeded at once, without the slightest hesitation, to take up the next operation on the supposition that it is more important to reduce the time interval between observations, during which interval the instrument has an opportunity to change its shape and position, than to make a slight improvement in the pointings. This contrast in the habits of the two observers existed for pointings on the graduation of the circle with the micrometer microscopes, as well as for paintings on distant stations with the telescope. At the beginning of the season Mr. Ferguson's observing was done at the rate of 3.4 minutes for each pointing on a distant signal, and at the end of the season under more favorable conditions 2.5 for each pointing. Mr. Bowie, under similar conditions, took 2.0 minutes for each pointing at the beginning of the season and 1.3 at the end. The probable error of the mean of 16 measures of an angle is shown in the following table for each of these observers and for each of the four sections of the triangulation in order of time.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY .REPORT, 1903.

These probable errors were computed from the discrepancies between the means of sets of four observations each and the mean of all sixteen observations, and are therefore practically free from any effect of errors due to periodic errors of graduation of the circle or to run of micrometer. The probable errors do not, however, furnish any information as to the existence or nonexistence of constant errors. The above comparison indicates that the more deliberate observer has made observations of which the accidental errors are considerably smaller than those of' the more rapid observer. The most severe test _of accuracy which can be made is furnished by the corrections to directions resulting from figure adjustment. These corrections exhibit the constant errors as well as the accidental errors. A comparison between the two observers on this basis is as follows: Correctio11s to dircdio11s. ---------------··---- --·----------------

It will be noted that this comparison shows the accuracy to be substantially the same for the two observers. The average correction to a direction for the deliberate observer, Mr. Ferguson, is very slightly less than for the rapid observer, Mr. Bowie, but, on the other hand, the maximum correction in three sections out of the four is greater for the deliberate observer than for the rapid observer. The conclusion from this investigation must, therefore, be that the deliberate observer reduced his accidental errors very slightly by taking more time to each pointing, and that the real accuracy of his observing was but slightly if any greater than for the other observer, as shown by the more severe test of accuracy given by the corrections to directions found to be necessary in the figure adjustments. The deliberate observer apparently increased his systematic or constant errors by giving his instrument more time to change in form and position sufficiently to offset what he gained by reducing the accidental errors. If, therefore, he had n1ade his pointings much more rapidly there would have been a considerable saving in the cost of the work, and probably no decrease in accuracy. Observers usually suppose that observations on signals which are visible only when the refraction is abnormally large, and for which even then the line of sight passes very near to the ground or intervening trees, are of an unusually low degree of accuracy. There were eight such lines especially mentioned in the field report of the work of this season, namely, Queen-Spradling, Blue-Myers, Lanier-Smith, Smith-Carson, Carson-Caddo, Caddo-Edmonds, Enid-McCoy, and Burson-Wingard.

rections to the directions observed over these lines were examined, and it was found that they were, upon an average, 44 per cent. larger than the average corrections in corresponding sections of the triangulation, thus confirming the prevalent belief. The maximum correction to a direction for the whole season, namely, to the direction from Myers to Blue, occurred on one of these lines. In view of the fact that during this season for the first time the extreme has been reached of taking all the primary observations at a station on a single day, it is important as well as interesting to note carefully whether such observations were subject to any unusual e'"ror. The following tabular statement shows the facts in regard to the five such stations which were occupied in 1902: .

The average correction to a direction for these stations is of about the same magnitude as for the sections in which they are located. The means indicate that the observations at these stations were really slightly more accurate than at the average station, but the slight difference between o. 20 and o. 24 may be only a chance difference due to the small number of corrections included in the first mean. The maximum correction at no one of these five stations approaches in magnitude the maximum correction in the corresponding section. The indication is very strong that even the extraordinary procedure of taking all the observations at a given station on a single date is not accompanied by any decrease in accuracy, and that contrary to the usual traditions of geodesists it is not necessary to extend the observations over several days in order to secure great accuracy. This conclusion is sustained by much evidence in addition to that shown here, which is simply that from extreme cases, cited as illustrations rather than positive proof. In view of the fact that a considerable increase in the rapidity of the triangulation was secured during the years 1900---1902 over that of previous years by cutting down the number of observations of primary directions from 22, 24, 26, 34, or even more, to 16, and that this reduction in the number of observations has not been accompanied by a decrease in the accuracy of the results, it is important to consider the probable effect on the accuracy of a still further reduction of the number of observations. A careful examination of this question was made by the method of least squares,
*All the directions used in the adjustment of the section Bowie to Stephenville were observed on one day, August 26. The statistics here given are from these directions only.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

using the data available from the 1902 observations. The conclusion reached was that a reduction of the number of observations to 12 or 8 would be accompanied by a considerable decrease in accuracy, and that there would probably be difficulty in securing the degree of accuracy indicated by the triangle closures specified in the instructions and corresponding to the best primary triangulation of the past. It was decided, therefore, to continue to take 16 observations.
ACCURACY AND ECONOMY.

The evidence in brief that the triangulation of 1902 along the ninety-eighth meridian ranges near the top of the list for accuracy as compared with other triangulation in the United State·s and at the same time is the most economical primary triangulation yet executed is here brought together for convenient reference. In the following table fifty sections of triangulation in the United States, for which the required tabular values can be conveniently obtained, have been arranged in order of accuracy, the most accurate being placed first. The most severe and therefore the best test of accuracy is believed. by the writer to be the quantity d expressing the probable error of the observed direction as derived from the corrections to directions resulting from the figure adjustment; accordingly the various sections of triangulation have been placed in the order of the values of d; in the few cases in which d is the same to the nearest hundredth of the second for two sections, the next column, a, has been used to decide their relative rank. The method of computing d and a has already been explained fully on pages 86:t and 865.

Of the fifty sections of triangulations tabulated, the four sections of 1902 along the ninety-eighth meridian rank as numbers 2, 9, 14, and 24. Themeand for all four sections is 0.31, which falls between numbers 10 and I z in the above list, and would fall bet\veen numbers 8 and 9 if these four sections of which 0.31 is the mean were omitted.
-------*This was the discrepancy existing before the angle and the side equations were satisfied. In every other case given in the table it is that remaining after the angle and side equations ·had been satisfied.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

It is especially worthy of note that the section Stephenville-Lampasas, 1902, on which the angles were measured more rapidly than any previous section of triangulation in the United States, at the rate of more than seven stations per month for each observer, is exceeded in accuracy by only one section out of the fifty. The unit costs of this triangulation are as follows:
Cost per station occupied ............................... . $300. oo (75 stations). Cost per point detennined .............................. . 98.00 (231 points). Cost per square mile in main scheme .................... . 2. 30 (9 800 square miles). Cost per square mile covered ............................ . 2. 20 ( 1 o 400 square miles). Cost per linear 1i1ile of progress along the ninety-eighth meridian ............................................ . sr. oo (444 miles). The total cost of the work of the season was j.22 613.

The cost, as given above, includes all salaries and wages chargeable to this field work, either in preparation or execution, and at the end of the field season the preparation of field reports and the putting of reports and computations in the final form in which they were submitted to the Computing Division in the Office. It includes even an addition of one-eleventh to the salaries actually paid to members of the permanent force during this service, to take account of the fact that in general in such cases twelve months' salary is paid for each eleven nhmths' work. It also includes all transportation of officers and men to and from the field, of outfit, and of material bought. Figures for comparisons with these are difficult to secure, as little in regard to the cost of triangulation has been published. The writer does not believe, from the examinations he has made of the available evidence, both published and unpublished, that there has ever been a whole season of primary triangulation previous to 1902 on which the unit costs (excluding those which are expressed in terms of square miles) have not been more than 50 per cent in excess of those for 1902, and in a great many cases they have been more than double those of 1902. The cost per square mile for 1902 does not differ much from that for the portion of the thirty-ninth parallel triangulation in the mountains where the belt of triangulation was from two to ten times as wide as on the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation.* The cost of the signals ready for occupation, including all salaries, \\'ages, and transportation, as well as the cost of the material, and including also the cost of the materials for and placing in position of the station and reference marks, was about $3.20 per vertical foot, measured.to the light table. The total cost of the signals in 1902 was about 42 per cent of the total cost of the triangulation during the season.
EXPLANATION OF POSITIONS, LENGTHS, AN'D AZlll1UTHS, AND OF THE UNITED STATES STANDARD DATUM.

The lengths, as already fully explained in connection with the adjustments, all depend upon the Anthony, Elreno, Bowie, Stephenville, and Lampases bases. The lengths as given are all reduced to sea level. If the actual length of a line simply reduced to the horizontal is desired it may be obtained with all the accuracy ordinarily needed by adding to the sea level length as given a correction= (length of line as given) (!_llea~~e~atiot~~h':_o e~d-~~-line in meters). . 6370000 . -------------------· ---· - - - ----·-·· --The maximum value of this

correction does not exceed nhll" of the length for any portion of the triangulation here published. The maximum error made in the use of the above approximate formula for the correction does not exceed nll"i-Hll" of the length for any portion of this triangulation. The positions-that is, the latitudes, longitudes, and the azimuths-need a special explanation. All of the positions and azimuths have been computed upon the Clarke spheroid of 1866, which has been in use in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for many years. After a spheroid has been adopted and all the angles and lengths in a triangulation have been fully fixed, it is still necessary, b~fore the computation of latitudes, longitus:les, and azimuths can be made, to adopt a standard latitude and longitude for a specified station and a standard azimuth of a line from that station. For convenience the adopted standard position (latitude and longitude) of a given station, together with the adopted standard azimuth of a line from that station, is called the geodetic datum. The primary triangulation in the United States was commenced at various points, and existed at first as a number of detached portions in each of which the geodetic datum was necessarily dependent only upon the astronomic stations connected with that particular portion. As examples of such detached portions of triangulation there may be mentioned the early triangulation in New England and along the Atlantic coast, a detached portion of the transcontinental triangulation centering on St. Louis and another portion of the same triangulation in the Rocky Mountain region, and three separate portions of triangulation in California in the latitude of San Francisco, in the vicinity of Santa Barbara Channel, and in the vicinity of San Diego. With the lapse of time these separate pieces have expanded until they have touched or overlapped. The transcontinental triangulation, of which the office computation was completed in l 899, joins all of the detached portions mentioned and makes them one continuous triangulation. As soon as this took place the logical necessity existed of discarding the old geodetic data used in these various pieces and substituting one datum for the whole country, or at least for as much of the country as is covered by continuous triangulation. To do this is a very heavy piece of work, and involve_d much preliminary study to determine the best datum to be adopted. On March lJ, 1901, the Superintendent adopted what is now known as the United States Standard Datum, and it was decided to reduce the positions to that datum as rapidly as possible. The datum adopted was that formerly in use in New England, and therefore its adoption did not affect the positions which had been used for geographic purposes in New England* and alo~g the Atlantic coast to North Carolina, nor those in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The adopted datum does not agree, however, with that used in ''The Transcontinental Triangulation '' and in '' The Eastern Oblique Arc of the UJ.lited States,'' publications which deal primarily with the purely scientific P,roblem of the determination of the figure of the earth, and which were prepared for publication before the adoption of the new datum. As the adoption of such a standard datum is a matter of considerable importance, it i.s in order here to explain the desirability of this step more fully.
*Many such positions had been published in Appendix No. 8, Report for 1885, Appendix No. 8, for 1888, and Appendix No. 10 for 1894. Since the adoption of the United States Standard Datum many positions in Kansas and Nebraska reduced to that datum have been published in Appendix 6, Report for 1901, and Appendix 3 for 1902.

GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

The main objects to be attained by the geodetic operations of the Coast and Geodetic Survey are, first, the control of the charts published by the Survey; second, the furnishing of geographic positions (latitudes and longitudes), of accurately determined elevations, and of distances and azimuths, to officers connected with the Coast and Geodetic Survey and'to other organizations; third, the determination of the figure of the earth. The first two of these objects are purely practical; the third is purely scientific. For the first and second objects it is not necessary that the reference spheroid should be accurately that which most closely fits the geoid within the area covered, nor that the adopted geodetic datum should be absolutely the best that can be ~erived from the astronomic observations at hand. It is simply desirable that the reference spheroid and the geodetic datum adopted shall be, if possible, such a close approximation to the truth that any correction which may hereafter be derived from the observations which are now or may become available shall not greatly exceed the probable errors of such corrections. It is, however, very desirable that one spheroid and one geodetic datum be used for the whole country. In fact, this is absolutely necessary if a geodetic survey is to perform fully the function of accurately coordinating all surveys within the area which it covers. '.fhis is the most important function of a geodetic survey. To perform this function it is also highly desirable that when a certain spheroid and geodetic datum have been adopted for a country they should be rigidly adhered to without change for all time, unless shown to be largely in error. In striving to attain the third object, the determination of the figure of the earth, the conditions are decidedly different. This problem concerns itself primarily with astronomic observations of latitude, longitude and azimuth, and with the geodetic positions of the points at which the astronomic observations were made, but is not concerned with the geodetic positions of other points fixed by the triangulations. The geodetic positions (latitudes and longitudes) of comparatively few points are therefore concerned in this problem. However, in marked contrast to the statements made in preceding paragraphs, it is desirable in dealing with this problem that, with each new important accession of data, a new spheroid fitting the geoid with the greatest possible accuracy, and new yalues of the geodetic latitudes, longitudes, and azimuths of the highest degree of accuracy, should be derived. The United States Standard Datum was adopted with reference to positions furnished for geographic purposes, but has no reference to the problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. It is adopted with reference to the engineer's problem of furnishing standard positions, and does not affect the scientist's problem of the determination of the figure of the earth. The principles which guided in the selection of the datum to be adopted were: First, that the adopted datum should not differ widely from the ideal datum for which the sum of the station errors in latitude, longitude, and azimuth should each be zero; second, it was desirable that the adopted datum should produce minimum changes in the publications of the Survey, including its charts; and, third, it was desirable, other things· being equal, to adopt that datum which allowed the maximum number of positions already in the office registers to remain unchanged, and therefore necessitated a minimum amount of new computation. These considerations led to the adoption as the United States Standard of the datum which had been in use for many years in the northeastern group of States and along the Atlantic coast as far as North Carolina.

An examination of the station errors available in 1903, on the United States Standard Datum, at 246 latitude stations, 76 longitude stations, and 152 azimuth stations, scattered widely over the United States from Maine to Louisiana and to California, indicated that this datum approaches closely the ideal with which the algebraic sum of the station errors of each class would be zero. The adopted United States Standard Datum, upon which the positions and azimuths given in this publication depend, may be defined in terms of the position of the station Meades Ranch as follows:

The positions here published on the United States Standard Datum therefore differ' considerably from those given in" The Transcontinental Triangulation" (pp. 854-865), which depend upon a special geodetic datum which was adopted for the special purpose of that publication, and which was based upon the astronomic observations connected with that triangulation alone. The position given for the station .Meades Ranch, iu ''The Transcontinental Triangulation " (p~ 862), is0 "

=39 13 25.006 A. =98 32 30.469 a to Waldo=75 28 16.52
<p

The corrections to reduce this position to the United States Standard Datum are-

"
A<p= + 1.680

L1A.= +0.037
Aa=-2.00

Such corrections to reduce a position from one datum to another are not constant, but vary slightly from station to station.

'I'AllLE OF POSITIONS, AZIMUTHS, AND l,ENGTHS.

The following tableB give the positions of all points, and the azimuths and lengths of all lines, fixed by the ninety-eighth meridian triangulation from the KansasOklahoma boundary to the Lampasas Base in Texas. These tables may be conveniently consulted by using as finders the five sketches at the end of this appendix and the preceding index. In the third column of the index will be found for each point a reference to the page on which its description is given, and in the fourth colmim the page on which its elevation above sea level may be found. The azimuth and length of every line over which observations have been made in one or both directions are given in the list in connection with the position of one end only of the line. The positions of all points for which the latitudes and longitudes are given to thousandths of seconds have been fixed by a complete adjustment of the triangulation concerned, so as to make all the triangles close and remove all discrepancies between lengths, azimuths, and positions. Such adjustments are of a very high degree of accuracy, as indicated in the preceding pages, for points on the primary scheme, of a less degree of accuracy for secondary points, and of a still more approximate character for tertiary points determined by intersections only. In each class all discrepancies are - ------------·---------·-···--···---- ··-----·· · - · - - · -·-·--- - - · - - - - *See U. S. Geological Survey Bulletin No. 122, p. 251.

removed to the limit given by the decimal place shown. The above statements in regard to the various degrees of accuracy refer to the manner in which the discrepancies were removed. If less than three decimal places are given in the latitudes and longitudes the point in question has not been fixed by fully adjusted triangulation, or is fixed in such a way as to furnish no check on its position, and the accuracy with which its position is known is indicated in part by the number of decimal places given. The seconds of latitude and longitude are also given in meters for the convenience of draftsmen. ' In the column giving azimuths, distances, and logarithms of distances various numbers of decimal places are given, the intention being to indicate the accuracy to a certain extent, it being understood that in each quantity two doubtful figures are given. In some cases there is very little doubt of the correctness of the second figure from the right, and in a few cases some doubt may be cast upon the third figure. The following tables give the positions of 72 primary stations and 159 subordinate stations, or 231 in all, which have not before been published. The positions of a few stations near the Kansas-Oklahoma boundary which were published in Appendix 3 of the Report for 1902, "Triangulation in Kansas," are here repeated for the sake of completeness. For the convenience of thosf' who may wish to compare the lengths here given with others which are expressed in feet, or vice versa, the following conversion table is here inserted:

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.

This list may be conveniently consulted by reference to the illustrations at the end of this appendix and the index on pages 876-880. In each description the tense used is appropriate to the date at which the description was written. All directions in the descriptions are given in the form of azimuths reckoned continuously from south around by west to 360°, west being 90°, north 180°, and east 270°. The azimuths are true, not magnetic. In gen<;ral, the surface and underground marks described are ,not in contact, so that a disturbance of the surface mark will not, in general, affect the undergound mark. The underground mark should be resorted to only when there is evidence that the surface mark has been disturbed. Any person who finds that one of the stations here described is disturbed, or that the description no longer fits the facts, is requested to send such information to
SUPERI~TENDENT,

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY,

1¥aslzington, D. C.
GE:"HRAI, NOTES IN REGARD TO STATION MARKS.

Note I.-The method of marking each station referred to this note is as follows: A hole is dug to a depth of 4,Yz feet, its diameter being r8 inches for the first 2 feet and r 2 inches for the remaining distance. A terra-cotta pipe 2 feet long and 4 inches in diameter is placed in the lower part of this hole. The pipe and surrounding hole is then filled with a concrete made of Portland cement, sand, and broken rock. Set Yertically in the upper part of the pipe is a 60-penny wire nail, the point of which projects one-quarter of an inch above the cement and is the underground mark. A layer of 6 inches of sand is then put into the hole. Directly over the underground mark, and extending from the sand to the surface of the ground, is a terra-cotta pipe similar to the one just described. The surface mark is the point of a 60-penny wire nail set in the cement, which fills the pipe and the surrounding hole and also covers the pipe to a depth of half an inch. The reference mark is a 4-inch terra-cotta pipe 2 feet Jong set in a hole 1 foot in diameter, both pipe and hole filled with concrete. The top of pipe is level with the surface of the ground. A 60-penny wire nail is placed in upper end of pipe and projects one-fourth inch above it. Note 2.-The permanent marks at the ends of the bases which are referred to this note were put in position when the base was located. Below the surface a limestone block 6 by 6 inches in cross section and 1 foot long was set in concrete with its top 4 feet below the surface. Into the top surface of this post a copper bolt was secured, and the center of the station (underground) is a millimeter hole in this bolt.

APPENDIX NO. 4.

TRIANGULATION ALONG :NINETY-EIGHTH MERIDIAN.

895

At the surface a hard limestone block 23 by 23 inches and 16 inches high, weighing 700 pounds, set in a mass of concrete 4 feet square and 4 feet deep, carries at the center of its top surface a bronze station mark, the millimeter hole in the center of which marks the end of the base. These station marks are made of a composition of copper and brass, and have a shank 7. 6 millimeters long, with a slit in its lower end into which a brass wedge is inserted, so that when the bolt is driven home it bulges out at the bottom of the hole, which is made larger there than at the top, and in this manner is securely faste1ied in place. The top of the station mark is 80 millimeters in diameter, with an inner circle (countersunk) 37 millimeters in diameter. The letters "U.S. C. & G. S." are cast on the space between the inner and outer circles. Between the bottom of the surface monument and the bolt marking the point below the surface there is an earthenware drainpipe 7 inches in diameter and 25 inches long. This drainpipe is eiubedded in the upp~r mass of concrete and covered with a piece of galvanized iron to prevent anything from falling on the underground mark.

COMPUTATION, ADJUSTMENT, AND ACCURACY OF THE ELEVATIONS AJ,ONG THE :\INETY-EIGHTH .lllERIDIAN SOUTHWARD.

The zenith distances directly observed at each station were first computed and were corrected for height of object obsen·ed and of instrument so as to refer them all to the station marks. The difference of elevation of each pair of stations in the main scheme was then computed from the obsen·ations o\·er the line joining them by the formula

in which lz, and lz, are the elevations of the stations, I;, and 1; 1 are the measured zenith distances, s is the horizontal distance between the stations, and p is the radius of curvature. As there are always two or more lines to each new station, many rigid conditions existed between the observed differences of elevation, even if the connections with the precise leveling were ignored, and the least square adjustment furnishes the readiest accurate means of deriving the required elevations. The elevations from the stations Rutherford, Fowler, and Miller of the Anthony base net, southward to and including the Lampasas Base, were adjusted in six sets of equations. The first adjustment involved all stations in the primary scheme from these three stations of the Anthony base net to and including the stations Enid and Waukomis. The second adjustment involved all of the stations of the primary scheme from Waukomis and Garber, except Burson, to and including those in the Elreno base net. The third adjustment involved all of the stations of the primary scheme from Yukon, Edmonds, and Carson to stations Duncan and Arbuckle. The fourth adjustment involved all of the :;tations of the primary from Table Hill, Arbuckle, and Duncan to and including those of the Bowie base net, except Indian and Spradling. The fifth adjustment involved tho"se stations of the primary scheme from Bowie Northwest Base and Jone:; to and including those of the Stephem·ille base net. The sixth and last adjustment involved the stations of the primary scheme from the Stephenville base net to and including the Lampasas base net. In the following tabulation the obsen·ed differences of elevation treated in the first adjustment are shown, together with their adjusted values. The weight p assigned to each observed difference of elevation is inversely proportional to the square of the length s of the line between stations in meters and was conveniently computed by the formula, log p=9-2 logs. The obsen·ecl difference of elevation is given the sign of the elevation of the second station named minus the elevation of the first. The quantity contained in the last column but one is the correction to be applied to an obsen·ed difference of elevation to obtain the adjusted difference of elevation.

In the first adjustment, of which the direct results are indicated above, the elevations of the stations Rutherford, Fowler, and Miller were fixed by previous adjustment at the values 429. 31, 390.or, and 414.06 meters, respectively, which are the elevations set forth on pages 284 and 288 of Appendix 3, Report for 1902, corrected by -15" 111 to take account of the effect of new leveling recently introduced into the precise level net. Two other elevations were fixed by precise leveling, viz, Enid, 385.26 meters, and Waukomis, 388.90 meters. The ele\·ations of the six remaining stations connected by the obserYations are the unknowns to be determined by least squares from the sixteen observed differences of elevation indicated above. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ± 1.09 meters. In other words, the reciprocal day ob~ep;ations over a line 31. 7 1 kilometers ( 197) miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 1.09 meters. The probable errors for lines of other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the two stations fixed by precise le\'eling are about ±0.03 meter. The probable error approaches this Yalue for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest' for the most remote stations. Station Vicar was assumed to be the one least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting ·value and was found to be ±0.59 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, or, when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the precise leveling, it was still ±0.59. In other words, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme between the Anthony base net and the station Waukomis, there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within o.6 meter, or 2.0 feet, and for most stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this.

In this second adjustment the elevations of four stations were taken as fixed, namely: Garber fixed by the previous adjustment, its elevation being 359.90 meters, and the stations \Vaukomis, Elreno East Base, and Elreno West Base fixed by precise leveling, their elevations being 388.90, 440.19, and 466.93 meters, respectively. The elevations of the eight remaining stations indicated by the observations are the eight unknowns determined by least squares from the eighteen observed differences of elevation given in the above table. In connection with this adjustment the elevation of station Burson was determined by using simultaneous observations, made between this station and station Bichoff, as the observers failed to secure reciprocal observations over other lines from Burson. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this adjustment is o. 59 meter. In other words, the reciprocal observations over a line 3 r. 7 kilometers ( 19,73 miles) long, this being the length of the line corresponding to unit weight, determined the difference of elevation of two points with such a degree of accuracy that it is an even chance whether the error is greater or less than 0.59 meter. The probable errors of lines for other lengths were assumed to be proportional to their lengths. The probable errors of the elevations of the t.hree stations fixed by precise leveling are about ±0.03 meter. The probable error approaches this value for stations adjacent to those fixed by precise leveling and is greatest for the most remote stations. Station Edmonds was assumed to be the one least accurately determined, and its probable error was therefore computed as a limiting value and was found to be ±0.42 meter from the vertical angle measures alone, or, when combined with the probable error of the elevations fixed by the precise leveling, it was still ±0.42.

In other words, for the least accurately determined station in the main scheme between the line Waukomis-Garber and the Elreno Base there is an even chance that the elevation is correct within 0.4 meter, or r.3 feet, and for most stations in the main scheme the accuracy is greater than this. The results of the third adjustment, in which the stations concerned are those between the Elreno base net and station Arbuckle, are shown below in the form used for the first adjustment.

In this third adjustment the elevations of four stations were taken as fixed, namely: Yukon, Edmonds, and Carson, fixed by the previous adjust1~1ent, their ele\'ations being 426.12, 373.06, and 435.51 meters, respectively, and the station Duncan, fixed by precise leveling, its elevation being 373.30 meters. The elevations of the seven remaining stations indicated by the observations are t11e seven unknowns determined by least squares from the fourteen observed differences of elevation given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from the adjustment is ±0.24 meter. Unit weight corresponds to reciprocal observations over a line 31. 7 kilometers ( 1 9 ;1 miles) long. The probable error of the elevation of the station fixed by precise leveling is about ±0.03 meter. The probable errors of elevation vary from this to ±0.25 meter at station Kechi, as explained in connection with the first and second adjustments. The results of the fourth adjustment, in which the stations concerned are those between the station Duncan and the Bowie Base, are shown below in the form used for the first adjustment.

In this fourth adjnstment the elevations of five stations were taken as fixed, as follows: Table Hill and Arbuckle, fixed by the previous adjustment, their elevations being 394.47 and 397.26 meters, respectively, and the stations Duncan, Bowie Northwest Base, and Bowie Southeast Base fixed by precise leveling, their elevations being 373.30, 327.46, and 333.40 meters, respectively. The elevations of the ten remaining stations indicated by the observations are the ten unknowns determined by least squares from the twenty-two observed differences of elevation given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity deri\·ed from this adjustment is ±0.52 meter. Unit weight as ?efore corresponds to reciprocal observations over a line 31.7 kilometers (197/J miles) long. The probable errors of the elevations of the three stations fixed by precise leveling are about ±0.03 meter. The probable errors of elevation vary from this to ±o. 32 meter, or 1 .o foot, at station Blue, as explained in connection with the first and second adjustments. The resnlts of the fifth adjustment, in which the stations concerned are those between the Bowie Base and the Stephenville Base, are shown below in the same form used for the first adjustment.

In this fifth adjustment the elevations of three stations were taken as fixed, as follows: Jones fixed by the pre··ious adjustment, its elevation being 362.45 meters and Bowie Northwest Base and Comanche fixed by precise leveling, their elevations being 327-47 and 374.71 meters, respectively. In addition to these three fixed elevations, one difference of elevation was taken as fixed, that between Stephenville North Base and Stephenville South Base having been fixed by precise leveling as 26. 53 meters, which decreases by one the number of unknown stations remaining to be fixed. The elevations of the fifteen remaining stations 111dicated by the observations are the

920

fifteen unknowns determined by the least squares from the forty-one ooserved differences of elevation given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this adjustment is ±0.42 meter. Unit weight as before corresponds to reciprocal observations over a line 3i.7 kilometers (r97J miles) long. The probable errors of the elevations of the two stations fixed l;>y precise leveling are about ±0.03 meter. The probable errors of elevation vary from this to ±0.31 p1eter or r.o foot at station Gilbert, as explained in connection with the first and second adjustments. The probable error of the Stephenville North Base and Stephenville South Base was computed to be ±0.24 meter, including the errors of the precise Jeyeling. The results of sixth adjustment, in which the stations concerned are those between the Stephenville Base and the Lampasas Base, are shown below in the same form for the first adjustinent.

In this sixth adjustment the elevations of seven stations were taken as fixed, as follows: Lone, Young, Stephenville North Base and Stephenville South Base fixed by the previous adjustment, their elevations being 428.97, 460.06, 426.87, and 400.34 meters,

respectively, and Gilmore, Lay1pasas Northeast Base and Lampasas Southwest Base fixed by precise leveling, their elevations being 392. 15, 315-45, and 38I.59 meters, respectively. The elevations of the eleven remaining stations indicated by the obsen·ations are the eleven unknowns determined by the least squares from the thirty-five observed differences of elevation given in the above table. The probable error of an observation of weight unity derived from this adjustment is ±0.55 meter. Unit weight has the same meaning as in the p:eceding adjustments. The probable errors of the elevations of the three stations fixed by precise leveling are about ±0.03 meter. The probable errors of elevation vary from this to ±0.38 meter, or 1. 3 feet, at station Scoggins, as explained in connection with the first and second adjustments. In the preceding adjustments day observations only were used. The elevations published in this appendix depend on day observations alone. During this season the unusual plan was followed of taking night obseT\'ations of th~ vertical angles as well as day observations. The writer believed from the little information on the subject available to him that the night observati01.1s would be of about the same degree of accuracy as the day obsen·ations. Accordingly, adjustments simibr to those shown on the preceding pages were made, using the night observations only. The computation showed that for each of the localities covered by these adjustments the errors in the night observations were from two to ten times as large upon an average as the errors of the day observations, or the weights from one-fourth to one one-hundreth as large as for day observation. This was true of the mean results, even though the night observations over each line were in general more numerous than the day observations. Accordingly, the night observations were all rejected as being of too low a grade of accuracy to be of value.
TABLE OF ELEVATIONS.

The datum for all the elevations is mean sea level. The stations are in three classes: First, those fixed directly by the precise leveling, and of which the elevation is subject to a probable error of ±0.03 meter; second, the primary stations fixed by reciprocal measures of vertical angles and which are subject to probable errors varying from ±o. 1 to ±o.6 meter; third, the tertiary stations of which the elevations are fixed by measurements of vertical angles which are not reciprocal, the tertiary stations not being occupied. These elevations are subject to probable errors which may be a great as ±2 meters in some cases. For more exact elevations of the stations fixed by the precise leveling, and for an exact description of the point on each station mark to which such elevations are referred see Appendix 3 of this Report. The accuracy with which each elevation in the main scheme is determined depends mainly upon the remoteness of that station from the nearest one of which the elevation is fixed by precise leveling, as indicated in class 1 of the following table. Station Yicar is probably least accurately determined of all the stations to the southward of the Anthony base net or Kansas-Oklahoma Line, its probable error being ±o.6 meter. For a table to be used in converting feet to meters, or vice versa, see page 881

INTRODUCTION.

The "Magnetic Declination Tables,"* published in I902, contained the results of declination observations made by the Coast and Geodetic Survey prior to June 30, I902, and descriptions of the stations occupied between 188 I and that date. The publication of the dip and intensity results was brought up to the same date in Appendix No. 6, of the Report of the Superintendent for I 902, t and the intention was there expressed to publish the results of future observations made in the prosecution of the magnetic survey of the United States in the Annual Report of the Superintendent for the fiscal year in which the observations were made, thns making them available.for use by persons outside the Survey at the earliest possible moment. In pursuance of that policy the present appendix contains the results of the magnetic observations made by officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey between July I, I902, and June 30, 1903, together with a few results obtained during the previous year, but not heretofore published, and brief descriptions of the stations occupied. The detailed results of the observations at the magnetic observatories, of which five are now in operation, t will be published separately as soon as their discussion has advanced far enough to warrant it.
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF STATIONS.

The plan for the magnetic survey of the United States contemplates an original density of distribution of stations corresponding roughly to one in every county' hence, on the average, about 25 to 30 miles distant from one another, with subsequent additions in locally disturbed areas. The season's work of a magnetic observer is usually

confined to a single northern State in summer and a single southern State in winter, so that the bulk of the results here presented are confined to a few States. The work in Texas, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Florida, and Virginia, begun in previous years, was carried nearly to completion, and good progress was made in Arizona, Kansas, New Mexico, and Ohio. A beginning was also made in Louisiana in cooperation with the State Geological Survey, the Coast and Geodetic Survey furnishing the observer and instruments and the State paying the incidental field expenses.

In several cases more than one station was occ.upied in the same locality in order to' develop a suspected local disturbance, and at Phrenix and Flagstaff, Arizona, observations were made to detennine the suitability of these places as sites for a magnetic observatory. A column has therefore been added to the table, giving the number of localities where observations were made.
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS.

Some of the results enumerated in the above table were obtained incidentally by parties engaged in other branches of the work of the Survey, or were due to special investigations. Under the latter head may be mentioned a trip of inspection made by

APPENDIX XO. 5.

RESCLTS OF l\IAGNETIC OBSERVATIO::-<S.

937

L. A. Bauer, Inspector of Magnetic Work, in the autumn of 1902, which furnished a favorable opportunity for testing a new Lloyd-Creak dip circle, No. 28, intended primarily for use on ship-board and adapted for determining the relative total intensity by Lloyd's method. His outfit also included a small magnetometer and dip circle of the French magnetic survey type. This trip embraced a series of stations extending from northern Michigan to southen1 Texas and included at least one of the stations of each magnetic observer at that time in the field. Observations were made at the Cheltenham obsen-atory before and after the trip, and at the Baldwin observatory at about the middle of the trip. In this way direct comparisons were obtained bet\veen his two dip circles over as great a range of dip as is obtainable in the compact part of the United States, and also comparisons of his instruments with those in use by the various observers. He also occupied several stations on Mackinac Island, Michigan, in preparation for the work to be done later on the ice and investigated a marked local disturbance at Duluth, Minn. In the following February, when the Straits of Mackinac were frozen over, Assistant 0. B. French occupied four stations on the ice. These, in connection with L. A. Bauer's work on Mackinac. Island, already referred to, and future observations on the opposite side of the Straits, in the vicinity of Mackinaw City, will aid in determining whether the values of the magnetic elements on the water in this region may be safely inferred from those observed on the adjacent land. In January, 1903, the Lloyd-Creak dip circle was mounted on its gimbal' stand on the Coast and Geodetic- Survey steamer Blake, and the trip of that vessel to Porto Rico and back marked the beginning of magnetic observations at sea by the Coast and Geodetic Survey vessels. Some compass work has also been done by other vessels. The work thus far has been largely of an experimental nature. It has been determined, however, that valuable results may be expected whenever the necessary precautions are taken. In February, 1903, a temporary magnetic observatory was established, by permission of the Governor of Porto Rico, in Fort Isabel, on Vieques Island, Porto Rico, under the direction of L. A. Bauer, partly with a view to the closer study of the relation between magnetic, seismic, and volcanic disturbances. Mr. Bauer's return from Porto Rico to Washington was made by way of Santo Domingo, Cuba, and Key West in order to pay a visit of inspection to the magnetic observer at work in Florida.. During short stops of the steamer he secured magnetic observations at two stations in Santo Domingo and five stations in Cuba.
INSTRUMENTS AND METHODS OF OBSERVING.

The regular outfit of a magnetic observer consists of a combined magnetometer and theodolite, a dip circle, a chronometer beating half seconds, and a small observing tent. A complete series of observations at any one station includes observations of the Sun for azimuth and local mean time, two sets in the morning and two in the afternoon, and circum-meridian altitudes for latitude; two sets of declination; dip with two needles; and two sets each of oscillations and deflections at two distances for horizontal intensity, the two sets of deflections being made between the two sets of oscillations. As often as possible the chronometer is compared with the standard telegraphic time signals, thus furnishing a means for an approximate determination of longitude.

COAST AND GEODEnc SURVEY REPORT, I<)03·

For determining the declitJation in connection with triangulation, a compass declinometer has usually been employed in recent years. \Vith a view to obtaining dip and intensity results as well as declination from a very small instrumental outfit, several dip circles have been supplied with a compass needle mounted Oil top of the dip circle and provided with compass sights. By means of the alidade of the dip circle the angle may be measured between the magnetic meridian, as indicated by the compass needle and some object of which the true azimuth is known from the triangulation. 1'he dip wiHbe obtained in the usual manner with the regular dip needles and the relative total intensity by Lloyd's method, by determining the dip with a loaded needle and then using that needle to deflect a second needle. From these relative total intensity observations results another determination of dip with the unloaded or deflected needle. 'I'hus, with only a dip circle and its compass attachment, the three magnetic elements may be determined with sufficient accuracy to yield results of value, provided the instrument is properly standardized at some base station before and after the season's work and at some i;1termediate period when practicable. For some further information regarding methods followed in the field work, see paragraphs on '' Reduction of observations."
AcctJRACY oF RESULTS.

With the methods of observing outlined at the beginning of the foregoing paragraph it is usually found that under favorable conditions the latitude, ~zimuth, and declination are determined within r minute of the truth, the longitude and dip within 2 minutes, and the horizontal intensity within 1 part in rooo, thus fulfilling all requirements of a magnetic survey. With a compass declinometer the uncertainty in the declination is probably 5 minutes; with the compass attachment of the dip circle alluded to above, a declination can be obtained within 2 to 3 minutes.
Co.:11PARISON OP INSTRUMENTS.

A large Wild-Edelmann combination instrument, comprising declinometer, magnetometer, earth inductor, and theodolite, has been installed at the Cheltenham observatory, near \Vashington, and has been adopted as the standard to which all other instruments are to be referred. During the year special observations were made at Cheltenham to standardize two new dip circles, Nos. 27 and 28, the former made by 'I'esdorpf, of Stuttgart, and provided with an auxiliary magnet and deflection arm designed for the determination of relative total or vertical intensity, and the latter, the Lloyd-Creak clip circle already mentioned, made by Casella, but provided with Dover needles. Other instruments were standardized as circumstances required, and numerous comparisons were obtained as the result of the occupation of the same station by different observers with different instruments. 'I'hese observations show that few changes are required in the instrumental constants adopted last year.* '!'he various dip circles used and the corrections which have been applied to the results by each are giv~n in the following table. 'I'he figures after the decimal point indicate the particular needles to which the correction applies; thus 15. 24 means dip circle r5, needles 2 and 4.

No. 4655 was damaged by a fall last year, which may account for the change in its relation to the standard instrument. :!'\o. 56 has been supplied with new needles made by Do\·er. The comparisons between dip circles Nos. 24 and 28, made at stations between northern Michigan and southern Texas, show a fairly ·constant difference between the two instruments. Comparisons at Vieques Island (Porto Rico), Key \Vest and Ocala, Fla., and Savannah, Ga., between Nos. 24 and 27 indicate, however, that the correction to No. 24 may vary with the dip, and the publication of the results with that instrument <luring the trip from Porto Rico has been deferred until this subject has been more fully investigated. l\Iagnetometers Nos. IO, 20, and 2I *continue to give results for horizontal intensity less than the standard, though not quite so much less as indicated by observations of the preceding year. The results with these three instruments have been corrected as follows: No. IO +.0025 H. No. 20 +.0025 H. No. 2I +.007 H

'

Index corrections have been applied to declination results obtained with compass declinometer or compass needle. The magnetometers required no corrections for declinations obtained with them.
REDl7CTION OF THE 0BSERVATJO:-;s.

Every observer is obliged to make a first, or preliminary, reduction of his observations before transmitting them ~o the Office, and, in general, the reduction is carried far enough before he leaves a station, to enable him to see whether the observations are satisfactory. The general experience has been that this is in the line of economy, for errors can be detected much more quickly by the observer while he is in the field than by an office computer unfamiliar with the precise conditions under which the observations were made. If the observer has evidence of magnetic perturbations having occurred during the interval of his observations, he is expected to repeat his work. Usually one
*Dip circle 24 and magne~ometer No. 21 are of the French magnetic survey type and were made by Chasselon of Paris. The brass of which they are constructe<l contains impurities. See App. 6, Report for 1902, p. 350.

COAST AND GEODETIC SUR VEY REPORT, 1903.

day's complete observations suffice for a station, except for repeat stations at which observations are made on two or three days, according to circumstances. Before transmitting his records by registered mail, the observer makes an abstract of the essential quantities, both for the purpose of preventing loss of results in case the original records fail to reach the Office and also to enable him to exercise proper control over his instrumental constants and the elements of observation obtained from station to station. At the Office, an independent and final reduction of the observations is made in the Division of Terrestrial :Magnetism under the general supervision of the Chief of that Division, the computations being performed by various persons assigned to the Division from time to time under the immediate direction of the computer in charge of magnetic computations, Mr. D. L. Hazard, who exercises the final control in the revisions, enters the results in the register kept for that purpose and prepares the final tabulation for publication. For the reason already set forth in the preface to Appendix 6, Report for 1902, containing the dip and intensity results from January, 1897, to June 30, 1902, the reduction for secular variation is at present deferred. The corrections applied are as follows: a. Referring the magnetic declination results to the mean of the particular month in which the observation occurs, with the aid of the continuous magnetic observations at the magnetic observatory nearest to the station. \Vhere there was much difference in magnetic latitude, allowance was made in accordance with the general law of the increase of the diurnal variation with increasing dip and decreasing horizontal intensity. b. Applying, for the present, to the dip and intensity results merely the corrections necessary for referring them to the adopted standard instruments. Further details reg.arding methods of observation, computation, and reduction will be given in the manual of directions for magnetic work, which is in preparation.
ARRANGEMENT OF THE TABLES.

The values of declination, dip, and horizontal intensity here presented are arranged by States alphabetically, the results for each State being given in the ord~r of increasing latitudes. The latitudes and longitudes are in most cases the result of solar observations made with the small theodolite which forms a part of the magnetometer. In default of observations the geographic position was scaled froin the best a~ailable map, either the U. S. Geological Survey topographic sheets, Post Route map, or Rand & McNally State map. In such cases only the even minute of latitude aud longitude is given. The horizontal intensity is expressed in gammas (y), 100 ooo gammas being equal to one unit of intensity in the C. G. S. system. In order to include the desired amount of information in the available space, resort has been made to various abbreviations. Only the mot;th and day of the date are given, since the observations were all made between July 1, 1902, and June 30, 1903, unless otherwise noted. The names of the months have been abbreviated as follows:
January February March April May June Ja. Fe. Mh. Ap. My. Je. July August September October November December Jy. Au. Se. Oc. No. De.

DESCRIPTIONS OF STATIONS.

Magnetic observers are instructed to mark every station in as permanent a manner as possible, either with a stone or a post of some durable wooc;l, so that it may be available for future occupation. They are also required to furnish a detailed description so that the station may be located even if the marking should be destroyed, and to determine the true bearing of two or three prominent objects in addition to the one used as a reference mark in the azimuth and declination observations. The information is gh·en in abridged form on the following pages for each of the stations occupied during the year. Further details can usually be obtained on application to the Superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. The usual method of marking a station is by a stone post about 3 feet long and 6 or 8 inches square set so as to project an inch or two above ground and lettered on top U.S. C. & G. S., with a drill hole in the center to mark the exact point. Whenever the local authorities desired and were willing to bear tht: expense, a second stone was set to denote the true meridian. The descriptions of stations are arranged alphabetically by Stat_es and by name of station.
ALABAMA.

E11.faula, Barbour Cozmty.-The old statioil being no longer available a new station was located on the grounds of the Eufaula High School for Girls.

CHANNEL AND HARBOR SWEEP.
Description by D. B.
WAINWRIGHT,

Assistant, Coast and Geodetic Suroey.

This apparatus was designed in the Coast and Geodetic Survey to discover with certainty all those dangerous obstructions to navigation in channels and anchorages which are liable on account of their peculiar fo.rm and limited area to escape detection even in the most elaborate hydrographic survey. The apparatus was first used on the Coast and Geodetic Surve·y steamer Blake in the fall of 1902 in searching for the Brooklyn Rock in New Bedford Harbor, Massaclmsetts, a pinnade rock on which the U. S. cruiser Brooklyn had struck. The 'result of this work and the experience with the apparatus on other vessels of the Survey and in various localities shows that it satisfies all the conditions required of it. The following description of the apparatus will enable anyone familiar with qydrographic work to install and use it without difficulty. The brass fittings are shown in the illustration in their true relation by being attached for this purpose to short lengths of piping of the regulation diameter. All the piping is of the kind known as ''extra heavy galvanized,'' 2 ~ inches in diameter. A, A, are the swivel arms, 4 feet long and threaded at one end. They tum in the journal blocks B, B. These blocks are set so that the swivel arms will be horizontal when the vessel is on an even keel and at right angles to a fore and aft midship line. To the outboard end of each swivel is screwed an eye cap, C. Two set collars, D, D, on each swivel arm serve to hold the swivel arm so that the eye cap will project the required distance beyond the rail of the vessel. The vertical standards, E, E, which control the depth at which the sweeping bar Fis carried, are held at the desired height by the clamp collars G, G. If the sweep is used at ordinary sounding speed, the measurement for placing the set rings should start from the lower eye of the double link caps, H, H, the latter being screwed on to the lower ends of the standards, since the sweeping bar will rise nearly to their level when dragged through the water at a speed of several knots. The upper eyes of these caps are used for securing the ends of the guys leading forward. The lower eyes are used for attaching the sweeping bar, F, to the vertical standards by means of breaking links, I, I, and the single link collars, J, J. On the Blake there was fitted on the taffrail of the vessel a strongback, 8 inches by 8 inches, of spruce timber, 28 feet long, shored up to relieve the rail from some of the weight. · To raise and lower the apparatus a whip was seized to the lower end of each vertical standard.and passed through a single block seized or bolted to the strongback. The distance between the blocks should be the same as that between the eye caps or. the ends of the swivel arms.

COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY REPORT, 1903.

Two guys are led forward from each standard-one of five-eighths inch wire rope is attached to the upper eye of the double-link cap, and the other, of 2-inch manila, used to prevent flexure, is seized on at a point midway between the deck and the lower encl of the standard.

The link collars on the sweeping bar are clamped equally distant from its ends and separated by a distance equal to that separating the starboard and port eye caps. To prevent the possibility of the parts of the breaking links separating, the pins are headed over. To commence the work of sweepin g, the frame is lowered by means of the whips. As this progresses the standards gradually slide down through the eyes of the swivel

arms until brought up by the clamp collars, which then support the sweeping bar at the required depth. The forward guys are then hauled in until the standards are vertical and made fast; the wire guys to the forward bitts and the rope guys to cleats amidship. The whips are also made fast to the after bitts. To provide for excessive strains on the standards in the case of striking an obstruction, a I Yz-inch manila rope is bent onto each wire guy outbo~rd near the bow and carried to the bitts and made fast. The forward ends of the wire guys are then slacked off a fathom or more. To prevent excessive vibrations of the standards, and also to prevent any tendency of their lower ends swinging toward the sides of the vessel and deforming the shape of the frame, a diagonal guy was attached to the top of each standard, carried across the deck, and made fast to a cleat near the rail. PIPING FOR APPARATUS. Two pieces 2 Yz-inch extra heavy galvanized iron pipe, cut to 4-foot lengths, one end of each threaded. Twelve pieces of sa!ue kind of pipe cut to 16-foot lengths, both ends threaded (3 or more spare pieces included). Twelve 276-inch couplings (4 or more spare couplings included). 94-03--64

GEOGRAPHIC NAMES IN ALASKA.
NATIVE NA:llES FOR LOCALITIES ON ST. GEORGE ISLAND, BERING SEA.

Compiled by G. R.

Pt:TN.V-1,

Ass£stant, Coast and Geodet£c Survey.

The accompanying names for localities on this island were obtained from Peter Rosansof, a native and long-time resident of the Pribilof Islands, who is fairly familiar with the English as well as the Russian and Aleut languages. In most cases the names were verified by other natives on St. George Island, though in·a number of instances this developed slight differences of pronunciation. Some Russian names are also included, for the most part those that are given on the maps. In some of the native names Russian and Aleut words are combined, which is accounted for by the fact that these islands were under Russian control for nearly a century. The words are spelled phonetically to represent the pronunciation heard as nearly as possible. \Vebster's Dictionary is followed in the marking of the vowels, as in the following examples: fate, ~m. father, eve, ~nd, ice, m, old, ~dd, use. The accent indicates the emphasized syllable. In some of the Aleutian words there are two syllables with about equal emphasis. After each word is indicated, whether it is of Russian or Aleut origin, its general meaning, the locality to which the word applies, and the reason for its application, if any. Au interesting feature of these place names is that in almost every case they have some direct signification, having reference to the natural location, its connection with the pursuits of the natives, with their traditions, or with the animals frequenting the islands. St. George, in common with the other islands of the Pribilof group, was found uninhabited at the time of its discovery by the Russians, in 1786. K atives of the Aleutian Islands were brought here from time to time to work in the sealing business, and there are at present about 200 living on St. Paul and 100 on St. George. During the Russian occupation they became largely Russianized in customs and civilization. At present they are taught English in the schools, and the Russian language. is seldom used except in their church services. Among themselves they speak Aleut almost exclusively.
Ackan'-(mg'ili (Aleut, end point), west point of island. Agis'am-k6v~rushka' (Aleut-Russian, watch place bill; the Aleuts use the Russian word koverushka, meaning loaf, for hill), large round topped hill back of Staraya Artil rookery. Agis'-chi:icka' (Aleut, holkrw near the watch place), depression on bluff line just east of High Bluff. Agis'6gh (Aleut, the watch place), bluff overlooking Zapadni rookery. Alga-1i.niit6r6116g (Aleut, signifying a place where the seals do not go up) North rookery; the Aleut name being due to the ridge near the center of this rookery where there arc 110 seals.

An'agchi1ckniin'i1m-algarii'logriiy (Aleut, the rookery at Anagchucknunum ), East rookery, Anagchucknunum being Aleut name of bluff along eastern part of this rookery. An~n 1 1Sng-iitc 1 ha (Aleut, Ananong's shelf), prominent isolated bluff northeast of Fox Castle, rising sharply from the depression surrounding it on the land side; so called because some native of this name here gathered eggs; in former times custom among the natives set apart certain localities for the use of certain individuals in hunti*g birds, birds' eggs, foxes, etc., and. the rights to these places were always respected by the other natives. An1 1m-al'gerii (Aleut, seal lake), lake on ridge south of Little East rookery; the seals formerly extended as far back as this lake (more than one-third of a mile from the shore) according to native tradition.

This is the only point on the western part of the island where it appears possible to reach the shore with safety from the plateau above. G~variish'ka (Russian, red-legged gull), largest lake near the Zapadni trail, so called from the large number of gulls frequenting it. HlSl'~sti~k-ral'og (Russian-Aleut, holostiak or bachelor rookery), low valley at west end of North rooke~y. now occupied by breeding seals, but formerly only frequented by the holostiaka according to native tradition.
