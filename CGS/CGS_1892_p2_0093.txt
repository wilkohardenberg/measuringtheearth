PREFATORY NOTE.

The text of this Report for the fiscal year 1892 has been arranged for publication in two parts, like that for the .ft.sea.I year preceding. Part I., in quarto form, contains the historical portion, presenting reports of progress in the field and office operation& of the Survey; eetim.atee for :future progress, and statem.ents of expenditures during the fiscal year. Maps of genera.I progress,. a.nd sketches showing localities of field work, exhibit graphically the advance of the Sarvey to June 30, 1892. Part II, it will be observed,. is in octavo, a:nd includes the professional papers relating to the methods, discussions, and results of the Survey which have been approved for publication during the year. Such illustrations as a.r-e needed acoo:mpany them. The octavo form is Jnore convenient and auitable for the scientific and professional papers, while the quarto form appears to be demanded f'or the statistical matter and "the progress sketches. Since the la"t"ter are of less general interest than the form.er,· :in the :future distribution of the Report, Part I I only -will be sent,. as ict i& believed 1;hat this will include all "that is generally desired, and in a; much more compact and convenient form 1'ha.n that of the old quarto. In special cases, where both parts a.re desirable,. they will be eent. T. C. .MENDENHALL,

PREFATORY NOTE.

The Coast and Geodetie Survey having undertaken to cooperate with the International Geodetic A.~sociatiou in the observations for variation of latitude at \Vaikiki, near Honolulu, it seemed important to have deterrqinations of latitude at points intermediate between that point and Berlin. "\VaHhington, hei11 g nearly six 110ur~ WP~t of Berlin in lougitudt>.. and in latitude nearly mid\vay between Berlin and Waikiki, was geographically well placed for observatious which would check those regularly made at these two stations. Still further light would he thrown upon the su;;i.pected prog-rel'Aive change in the position of the axis of rotation of the earth by a Reries of olJservations at Sau Ji"'raudseo, nearly midway between \Vashiugton and 'Va.ikiki. 'rhe veritica.tiou of the moveme11t by these observation~ would remove all doubt as to its realit~v, and it was accordingly deterinined to do the best that could be doue nuder the circum~tances in the way of maki11g olmervations for latitude as frequently as 1')ossible throughout a year at both of these points. Other denun1ds of the service torbade the detailing of one or 1nore assistants to this duty alone. It wa.R ueceHsary to do it, if it was to he done at all, in atldition to other regular work, and it t11erefore became, in a large degree, a voluntary serviee. Assistant George Davidsou, i11 charge of the Sub-office at San Francisco, in carryb1g on th.e work there was 1nuch interrupted by necessary attention to office and field duties. In Washington the task was voluntarily assumed by Assista11t E(lwin Smith in addition to his regular duties as chief of the Instrunient Division. The latter required his presence in the ofl:lce duriug the day and necessitatied a. journey of 16 miles in the morning autl again in th.e evening, to his home in Pw0ckv·ille, where the temporary observatory was located. In consi<l~wiug the results herewith submitted, the above facts must not be lost i;;ight of, and it must be remembered that the work at the

stations in the United States was undertaken primariJy as a check upon the more careful and systematic investigation in progress at Berlin, and by Assit:>tant Preston and Dr. l\Iarcuse at Waikiki. This paper contains the obseiTations made at Rockville, and the re<lnction and computation of the results. An abstract of it was published in Noyembcr, 1892, as Bulletin No. 25. The instrumental 1nethods and scheme of observing have been described by Mr. Smith, aud the description of the 1nethod of recluctiou and the discussion of the results was prepared by l\ir. Charles A. Schott, Assistant in charge of the Computing Division of the office, under whose direction the computations were made. l\Ir. Preston's report of his observations and results at Waikiki is published as Appendix No. 2, 1892.

REPORT FOR 1892-PART ll.

On the variation of latitude at Rockt'ille, Md.
The large number of groups is considered the we~1kest point in this f.ieries of observations. The conditions under which the work was done will readily explain why it would have been impossible to have limited the number of groups. It is to be regretted that the hours of observation were so limitecl, but to lrnve exteuded them to two or three o'doek in the moruing would have been fatal to the performance of the observer's duties at the oftice. The groups could have been limited to a small number only by so extending the lwur::-> of observation. The observer has had littll~ assistance in thix work. "\Vith the aid of J\Ir. Prank ~.\.. Cook, the clerk of the Instru1neut Divisiou, tlie stars were seleete<l and the grou1ls arranged only a few days before the observations were actually begun. l\'Ir. Cook kindly volunteered to assist even after oftiee hours, and with his help an effort was made to keP.p np the computations as the oh:-;ervatious progressed; but tltis was soon f<.nu1d impracticable and the effort was abandoned. This part of the work wa,s then refert·ed hy the Snperintendent to the Com.pnting; Division of the Coast aud Geodetic Survey Office, where the computations have been personally uutde hy the C'hief of that Division~ as~ist.ed by J\:lessrs. Alexa.nder Bounot and Legh W. Heid, who were specially employed for the purpose.
DESCRIPTION OF STATION.

The town of Rockville is located on the 1\fet.ropolitan Branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, about 16~ miles fr01u Washington, D. C., in .l\loutgomery County, ~Iaryland. _ The latitude station is located in the- garden of the observer's residence on Forest avenue about 1 mile by the direct road from the railroad depot, but 8omewhat less than balf a milt· from tlie nearest point of the railroad. The f:.tation is about 500 feet above tide water, on one of the highest points within a ra.dins of about ~ miles. The immetliate vicinity is free fro1n trees and other disturbing atmo:-;pheric influences, and altogether can be considered a very favorable locat,ion for such ·observations. The sketch shows the locatiou of tlie observatory in the garden. 'I'he pier Ul">On which the zenith telescope is n10uuted is built of rough sandstone and cement, and its foundation is solid quartz rock. A ledge of this rock runs through the garden in a direction SW. to NE., and co1nes above the surface of the ground at several places. At the poit1t where the pier is built the rock is about 2 feet below the surface. The pier has proved a very steady one. Throughout the thirteen lllonths of observation the instrument required no adjustment in azimuth except when inteµtionally disturbed. The changes of level were slight and due 1nore t.o tmnperature than to any .other cause. The pier is 0·61. uietre square, and tbe t-0p 0·99 metre abov~ the ground. At

a distance <>f 1·98 metres n<>rth Qf tbi:i pie1' is another !lier of the same

material, only one-half of which rests upon the solid rock. Upon this · pier is mounted the transit instru1neut. As might be expected this pier is not as stable as the other, but serves its purpose very well. Over the piers is built a wooden observatory 3·66 metres by 4·26 metres, divided into two rooms 4·26 metres by 2·44 metres and 4·26 metres by 1 ·22 metres, respectively, the smalJer room being used as a recording and waiting room and the larger the observing room. By a system of ventilation under the eaves and at the peaks of the gables of the roof, an excessiYe rise of temperature is avoided. TlH~ width of the slit in the roof is ~~8 centimetres. The exterior of the buildiHg is paiutcd a very light color, almost white. The zenith telescope pier is covered

and 4, all made at about tlte same time. In their original form they had many defects and gave uusatisfaetory results, a11d for some years past had been unused. When it wa~ proposed that the Coast and Geodetic SnrYey should take part in these researd1es 011 the variations of lati· tude, in cooperation with the International <~eodetic ~.\.ssoeiation, 110 other instru1nents were available. and it was decided to ltaye two or these remodeled at the SnrYey Offke. OIH~ f(w the party going to tlw Hawaiian Islands aud the otht>r for the party to lw located near vVa.shington, D. 0. No.:! was selected for the former and No. 4 for the latter. The remodeliug of theHe instruments was done in the shop~ of the lustrnrnent Divhdou of the ( 'oast and Geodetic Survey Office, a11d every Jffeeautjou wa.s taken to make tlwm a,s perfect n.s pos~ihle under the cil'cun1stances. The new featurt.'s are as followH for each instru1ne11t: New baRe and leveling· Sl'l'ewt-:.: ne'Y ,·ertical axi.s; 11e:' wyes for horizontal axis of tele.scopP, with adjustment flH' leYcl; new and larger 11orizoutal axis for telescope; uew nticro1neter .sen·w and reconstruction of rnicrmneter hox and slide; ucw and improved clamp to h·Je~copt~; two new fine ]evels attaelw(l to telescope~ 11ew .stride level for telescope axis; the whole int-:.trnrnent rt~polished, bronzed, etc.; electric lamps, batteries, etc., for illumination of telescope field, the reading· of lt·yels~ etc. Owing to want of time, Xo. ~ did not have th<.> 11ew base and vertical axis. This is very mn(·h to be regretted, a~ tlw old for1n is too weak. In every other re~pect the instrunie11ts are equal. Though the:-;e instruments are by 110 means sncb as would haYe l>een selected had therP lwen time to purchase or ··tmstruct new ones, it was believed tlH:'Y would answer the purpose. The optical partH are those originally furnished with the instrument. The objective has a clear aperture of 7·0 ce11timetrf·s and a focal leng·th of 11U·6 centimetres. Tl1e glass has a slig;ht green color, but the irnageH of the stars observed wert~ bright and welJ defined. Tht> diag011a.l eye-piece gives a power of 100. It give:-; good definition only very ll('ar the n1iddle of the fielcl, aud haviug lJO para11actic motion in right as(·eusion, only three goo·l pointings cou1d he made on a ~outhern star while crosRiug the field.

N. B.--A series of observations made on the "ame day as above (~fay 19) was rejected for like reason.

In thP latitude reduction the ave1·age value or 1"·482 ± 0"·010 was u:-;ed irrespective of the tempera.tun~. cha.11ge:-: of which appareutly do liot 8ensibly affect the value. As each hwel was read twice before and after reversal of telescope, any error of reading· could readily be detected.

The

in:1H~8tivatfon

of the va1uc of the micrometer scrr?w.-A large num-

ber of observations were made to determine the value and irregularities of tlie Herew. This was the more demanded since the sums of the mieromt·ter ':orrections to the lat itnd(· do not exactly balauce in the

:-;(·vera1 groups. Observations were made ahont the time of elongation of tlte star, and for that part of the screw contained between 20 and 40 turns, also for !, 2, and i turns. Corrections were applied for devia tious from the mean state of level during a series of observations, also for curvature*, but uot for rate of chrouometer, which was too s111all to have any eftect. The correction for differential refraction was applied.

It becan1e evident that the micrometer obser\Tation:s made at the temperature -7°·0 C. had to be rejected, though not suspected at the time. The 12 conditional and 2 norinal equations were then formed anew, whence the final value R = 44"·6606 - 0·001150 t. It represents the observation~ as follows:

Tlrn adopted corrections are simply the smoothed out values of tlie p1·.-1·e(ling colmnn converted to seconds of arc. 'l'hus between 40 and :~o t m·ns the screw is quite perfect, but less so towards the other e.nd. The micrometer reduction to the latitude includes this correction. l'eriodfo inequality of the scretv.-A. discussion of the measureR of qnartcr, 11alf, and three-quarter turns, indicated that any periodic inequality of the serew was "too small to be dPtected with certainty from tlii· material on hand; the mean correction from 13 determinations at :rny of the above fractional turns would uot amount to 0"·02. h1tenJals of the microrneter threa.ds 1, 2, and 3.-Tlu~ part of the screw utilized in the latitude work ge11eral1y falls hPtween turuR 20 a.1ul 40, Init fhr larger micrometric difference~ the fixed threads 1 or :{ wert· employed instead of 2, the middle thread.

COMBINATION OF RESULTS FOR VARIATION OF LATITUDE, AS OBSERVED AT ROCKVILLE, MD., IN 1891-'92.

.

In order to deduce any result for systematic variation from the in. dividual resu1t8 for latitude, as obtained directly from observations, it is essential that in the cmnbination, the dt>cli11atious of the stars, takell from variou::-; catalogues, should he referred to a uniform system, aud at the sauw tilne that any- change in latitude, whether Jleriodic, progre:-isive, irregular, or auy absence of change, should not be interfered with. This was seenred hy the n1ethod of combination ado1 ·ted iu the reduction of the Berlin and other series of observations as earried ont by Ur. Th. Albrecht* and is the same as followed for the Hockvillt~ series. The first step of the reduction conf'ists in" dividing the whole sc:i;ies of results into group8, each of a suflkient number of pairs of stars to give a closely approximate value of the mean latitude and with the sums of the positive and negative n1icrometer corrections, as near as may bf', balancing each other. The observer's arrangement respecting groups was altered with a view of strengthening the conuections of tl1e gToups. At the close of a year's work the re-observation of the same pairs of a group would afford the means of improving t11e wliole f.l.eries by the introduction of the condition that the closing error of the sum of the corrections to the mean results of the groups at the end of

the year be zero.
The second step is the reduction of the declinations of each pair of starH to the inean declination system of the group. Comparing t lie mean result for latitude of each pair i11 the group with the mean result by all the pairs-i. e., with the mean latitude of the group-a correction was obtained to the result by each pair. Iu general, the smallnes:-; of tllese corrections (as given below) iudicate that the tabular declina· tions were fairly accurate. The pairs coustitutiug each group, the number of days of obsen·a· tion for each. and the 1ncan latitude fbr tlie same are tabdlated below, together witi1 the reduction of the result by each pair t~ the meau of . its group.t

The sum of the corrections for each group should be zero.

The pre.ceding corrections were applied to the results of the respectiYe pairs 1 forming a new table of results (marked A 1 B 1 C 1 D 1 E 1 F 1, iu 1\18. and not reproduced here) prepara.tory to the next step, viz: C01nparison of the mean decliuation of the gronpl':I by means of the l'('8nlts obtained on the same night from i1airs ranging over two or more gTonps. Such comparisons between results of the same date leave, of l'oHr;-;e, any changes in latitude absolutely untouched. Thil-3 third step, thP11, consists in ascertaining the differences in the niea.u declination sy;-;tem of any two adjacent groups or overlapping groups. For this llllrpose all resuUs of pairs helouging to the same group were made use ot, and not only those results which form the full or complete set of all pafr.s for every night. Jf'or any date c01111non to two or more gron ps, the mean latitude was taken for all pairs observed in each, and their number noted as the weight to the mean, and the same was doue for the other groups. T.hese compariso~ts being .made for every day of observation, the.final difference between any two groups will pe that of their

The main feature of the representation is a decided minimum latitrnle towards the close of the year 1891 and apparently two epochs ot' high values of latitude, one of ·which, however-that about ~..\.pril, 1892is probably due to some unknown disturbances affecting the observations. Besides this there are t\YO large and sy.stematie declines in tlH· resulting latitudes which in magnitude greatly surpass the minor irregularities of the ordinary zigzag lines of variability. It caunot lw supposed that these features are due to real cha11ges in latitude; about this, however, corroborative evidence can be had as soon as the r<· sults for changes in the latitude of San Francisco shall have becom ... known. The probable error of observation for latitude for the period covering the best part of the series-i. from July to November-is as follows:

Comparatively this 1nay be regarded as rather a large value; it may be attributed mainly to the circumstance of the use of three in the place of 011e n1icrorneter thread, since there was evidence to show t,hat the distances between the threads did not remain invariable. There is also liability to error in recording the particular thread used. The hature of suspected systematic errors, notably those affecting the results of l)ecember and January, bas so far eluded scrutiny, but is probably related to a feature of obscure origin which may produce a systematic difference in the results of all pairs observed on two consecutive nights, as on September 23-24, when each of 14 pairs gave a lat.Hu<lc in defect on the second night, with an average difference of 0 11 ·51. The unexpected rise of the latitude in April and the subseqneut sharp decline was accentuated by the introduction of the adjusted

'l'he observations were treated according to the method adopted by l'rof.

DESCRIPTION OF STATION.

The station of observation was located at V\.-.,..aikiki, 2 n1i1cs SE. of Honolulu, on the property of Mr. J. F. Brown, who generously ~:a \'e the use of the ground for the whole tin1e of occupation. The ~msition of the observatory is shown in illustration No. 10, which also Ht<·.lndes the three triangulation pointR to which the "\-Vaikiki triangulation statiou was referred. The 'li:-:;tance from the sea~hore to the zenith telescope pier is 400 feet. The gt·odetic difterenec as given by

COAST AND

l\fr. Lyons between the positions of the Government Survey observatory in llonululu and the U. S. Coast and Geodetic 8urvey observatory at \V a.ikiki is as follows:
d<p = 9658 feet= l' 35"·5 d;t = 9785 ,, . 1' 43"·6 = 6"·9

The astronomfoal latitude of the former (Coast a.nd Geodetic Survey Report, 1888, . A.ppeudix 14, p. 49;'")) is 210 18' 2"·48. This detern1i11a· tion was made about . A.pril 1. T'he latitude of "Taikiki at this seaso11 of the year is not far fro1n 210 16' ~4"·70, so that we liave a difference of astronomical la.titndes of 1 1 37 11 ·8, which would il1dicate a defleetio11 of the plumb line bet\.Yee11 Honolulu and "\\.,..aikiki of 2''·3 in latiturk. The astronomical au1plitude beiug gr(~ater than the geodetic one, would indicate that the plumb line at the northern station (Honolulu) wa~ deflected farther south than the one at V\-.,..aikiki. This result is not in accordance 'vith 'vhat we 111ight e,xpect, since the gTea.t 1nass of the island lies to the northward, and the greater proxin1ity of \Yaikiki to the seashore would tend to draw its vertical to the southward. Tlw astronomical difference Of longitude between the Saine two stations Wtl:-' determined hy l\fr. C. J. I_jyons, assistant in charge of the Governuicnt Survey Office, and inyself. The method employed was by exchangi11g ~ignals over the telephoue wire. The chronometers were rated at the two observatories, and the signals were sent in both directions by tapping 011 tlae transmitter box. A number of taps were n1ade at different parts of the second-hand dial to elim.inate any effect of ececll· tricity. The \Vaikiki chronometer had a rate of about 20" daily, wukh enabled us to get a coincidence of beats nearly every day of tlie exchanges, so that there were no fractional parts of a second to lie estimated. No high degree of precision was expected in the results, yet they agreed within one-fifth of a Recond for the six days. Stars Wfl'e employed at Waikiki in getting the diurnal correction, whereas at Honolulu the sun "\Vas used. Ou one day the exchanges were made to depend entirely on t1ie i;;un at both places as a test. This day's work agreed well with tl1e others. The azimuth of the Honolulu instrunv~ut ·was not very ~wcnra.tely known; but as the sun only was observed at this place, and as moreover its declination at the tiine was abont :no 30', and the latitude of the station was 210 18', it is evident that the azim.uth was without any effect on the time observations. The mean result from several days' work was 7 8 ·4, which gives a differellee between the astronomical and geodetic amplitude of 0 8 ·5, the astronomical being the greater. The connection of the two stations would seem to indicate a deflection of the plumb line at Honolulu towa.cJ·ds the ESE., or in the opposite direction at Waikiki. The connection of the Waikiki triangulation point with the Govern· ment Survev stc.<ttions is shown in illustration No. 10. This connection was inade i;~dependently by J\Ir. J. S. Emerson and myself. The two 1ncasures checked each other and the agreement was satisfactory.

Although very easy of Inanipulatiou it has serious defects, a few of which will be brietl:v indicated. The instrument was 1utwh too liglJt. A inotlerate ·wiiul affected the levels, and frequently it was necessary to reject ohset·vations on aecount of the uncertaiuty of the level reading. Ou one or t'vo occasions of stroug 'viud it wa<.; neces;..;ary to give up work altogether. The fact that the time was very limited before leaving vVa:-;hiugtou will suflicieutly explain the hastt~- necessary in the preparation. The zenith telescope ·was an adaptation of an old forn1 of iustruruent. The tube is placed centl'ally, and the rmnodeling involved the eonstructiori of a new prqjeeting platform at the top of the vertical axi~. rrh(~ horizontal axis was inade longer th~tn in the old for1n. The supporting tripod at the base was coufes:-iedly much too light, and the double foot-screw~, although they gave a fine means of at~justment, posse.ssed very little stability. This defect, co1nbined with the somewhat difficult motion of the rnicronteter serew, procluce1i considerable di:-,;crepa11cy betweeu the level readings before and after the bisections. This effect was nea1·ly always in the same direction. It varied from 1/.10 of a divi~ion to 8 10 of a division, and indicated that the whole instrument waR pushed brnlily by the manipulation of the micrometer and revolved abont a line pa:".sing throngh the lower part of its base. It is evident that the clam.ps holding- the perforated arm and the fitting of the pivots in the horizontal axis resisted the pre::-;sure at the ocula.r much better than the total weight of the instrument. No provision was inade'for reading the micrometer while sitting, l1ecause it had been reconunended to make only one bisection. \-Vhen for various reasons it was deemeLl advisable to point three tiilnes ou the star, a m.i1Tor wa.8 attached at an angle of 450 to the line of sight, which enabled the obs«i:~rver to n1ake the readings of the micrometer oy reflection without changing- position. By reference to illui:;trations Nos. 7 and 12~ it will be seen tlrnt the ineridian telrn~cope was mounted north of the zenith telescope. Thi1' made it possible to use the former as a collimator for the latter, awl as the meridian telescope 'vas kept accurately in the meridian from daily star observations for use iu the gravity work, a fine meridian n1ark was always available inside the observatory. In addition to this a mark was placed on .Makiki Ridge 13,000 feet away exactly :north of the 1 wo piers. This was done by l\Ir. F. S. Dodge, and its position is sl10vm in illustration No. 9. The deviation in azimuth of the meridian telescope was seldom more thau a few tenths of a second of time. The zenith telescope was examined frequently~ and was never found out of adjust· n1eut beyond the limits prescribed for this kind of work. The stops on the horizonta,l circle used in defining the plane of the meridian were only moved when it was necessary to observe circumpt1l:1_r stars for n1icrometer value, and only on one or two occasions were Iat_itude and micrometer both observed on the_ same uig-ht. \Vll.en th 15

The corrections to the ob8erved lat.itudes on ae<~ount of errors of ll'vel and collilnation were seusihly constaut t11ruughout the yt_~ar arnl 1·ractically insignificant. Tlie effect of au inclination in the horizontal axis is to make the tele:wope describe a great circle whm;;e inclina6on to the plaue of the meridian 1s given hy the level readi11gs on the horizontal axis. Tl1e :::.tar will be observ~d when it has an hour angle equal to the iuclinatiou of the axis in seconds of time multiplied by the level factor B, dcptmding on the star's declina.tion and zenith distance. The effeet of a11 Prror in collimation is to make the line of light describe a small circle who~e. ': istance from the plane of the meridian is measured by the augle hctweeu the line of sight and the axis of collimation. The hour angle of an observed star is the distance on the equator in seconds of time IHn1tiplied by the secant of the declination. Now the effect on a men~ ureu zeuith distance will be given in either of these cases by the formula

The greatest value for the level factor for the latitude stars is 1 ·35, while that ot the collimation factor is l ·56. _, In order to }H'Odnce a correction to the latitude exceeding or 1 .0l for the highest stars, it would ue net'essary to suppose a value for the iuclinatiou of the horizontal axil-~ of about 1 n1iuu ie of arc and of seYeral seconds for the error of collimation, neither, of ·which suppositionR i8 admissible. The factors for relative weigltts, azimuth, level, and coilimation in the ti1ne reductions were taken from the plotted sheet, and cousideraLly facilitated the reductions.

The equatorial interval of the vertical threads is 9"·5.

The error introduced by the above supposition is -..er~ much inside that of observation and vastly inferior to the probalik error of the declination, and was therefore not considered im1Jortant in the field reduction.

regard to these determinations it should be remarked that the of vVaikiki is very unfav01·ab1e for such an investigation. The altitude of the stars used was only 21°. This genernlly would give m1 unsteady atmosphere, but in addition we had high mountains immediatel.'r north of the station, around which the clouds continnaB,v l1ung_ Tile prohable error of the determination is therefore large. But when Wf' r·onsider that the zenith distances of the latitude stars are almost pi>rt'Pctly balanced for each group, thus eliminating in the :tinal result aiiy error in the value of the micrometer screw, this slight uncertainty !·P<·omes of no importance. The screw was examined for irregularities in the whole turns in the follov;·ing manner: The I'educed times from 33 turns to 3 turns were 1:;1hulate<l and fron1 them the mean tiine for one turn was determined. Ti1i~ value being applied to the mean of all the tabulated times, we l1an' the theoretical values correspon<ling to the dift"erent turns, and rlip rlifference between these theoretical values and those actually obLdned by observation gives the irregularities of the screw at the dif~it.nation

INCLINATION OF THE

MICR0~1ETER

For a short time after the beginning of the work the micrometer tluead was slightly inclined to the tangent to the star's path at culmiItation. An a<ljn::-.t1nent wais n1ade on .June 20, and its position was not subse<JnentJy lli~tnrbed. Before this date, all zenith distances whieh have 11ot correspoll<ling observations before and after the meridian require a very appreciable correction from the above-mentioned cause. After .June 20 the a<ljustrnent was such that no incliuatioH could be detected by a cursory iuspection of the observations. Ncvertheles~, by combining n1any of the bisections it '\va.s fou11d that the mean inclination gave a value which would still be appreci:.ltble when the observation was so1ne dista1H~e from the .meridian. Two values for the inclination "\Yere therefore deduced-one app1icab1e before an<l tl1e other after ,June 20. It is assn1ned that the inclination did not change between tl1is date a1Hl the close of the work more tlian a year later. This was tested by a careful scrutiny of the recor<l at several epoehs during t11e interval, t·he greatest difference betweeu the mean value adopted for the inclination and t11at dednel'.'tl from i11dividua1 groups oH]y causing a difference of one 01· two liu11dredths of a second in the correction to the latitude.

In December, 1891, a very exhaustive determination was macle l,y myse]f at Waikiki, using the micrometer attacl1ed to th~ zenith t.elescope. All parts of the screw were used from 5 turns to 31 tnrns, an<l in all about 70 individual values were obtained. When the mean wa 8 taken the result wal"l, for A, 1"·194; for B, 1"·230. This was so near the mean of all the otbers that it was adopted in the latitude compu-

On the variation of la,titude at 1raikiki, Hau:aiian Islanils.
Tlie level vial as mounted on the telescope is incased in a hollow g-l:1ss tube, to protect it against sudden chauge:-; of temperntnre. This glass tube is itself covered, except directJy ahove the level scal0, by a l1la11ket of thick baize. Attentiou has sometimes been called to an error of reading from parallax on account of this outer glass tu be. _A._n insp('ction of the formula for the level correction shows the effect of error8 from imperfect readings is iudeed very sn1all. If N and Sare the readings of the north and sonth end of the level before reversal, and n and 8 tlie readings after n·versaJ, the correction to the latitude, disregarding for the momeHt, the sigu, is
2 tlie first faf'tor being the mean motion of the bnbhle. Now :if we ~mp po,... t'. one of t.l1ese reading8 Hable to an error of one-qnartt·r of a divisio11-i. t~., supposing the reading was only made to the nearest half diYic-;im1 and 1 dIYision=1''·21-the error in the latitude <'Orreetion is 0"·07. arnl wl1e11 con1hined with the reRult from another le,·el the error '' ould only be 0"·03. Each latitude correction depends on S rendiug-s 1yad1 end of hotl1 levels before and after reversal) so that in the n1ean ren1li11g there would necessarily be so1ne coinpensatiou of errors, a1ul tlw pffoct on the final latHude would certainly not be more thau 0"·01, ew·n if the readings were only made to the nearest half divisiou. '.\Toreo\Ter, the above formula shows that if tbe north end was read too larp:e hotl1 before and after i·eversal the latitude correction is unchanged, and similarly for the son th end. This exp1ains to a certain ~·xtent the fact that the deduced latitudes are about as concorclant where only one reading was n1ade for each star as where the le,·el was read both before and after making tlrn bisections with the micrometer. 1 t i:-: evident tl1at if the influence on the level, consequent upon making 1l1P hiRections, is in the same direction and of the same amonnt for ho1 h RtllrR the resulting value of the latitude is uncl1anged. Th<> large range in the individual valueR is due principally to the inar·r'uraeies of the level indications. In several cases the original notes re111ark that, the level was moving at the time of reading. These values, i 14 ·\u.·ver, . were retained because the <liscordant value of the latitude r.ri:-;e~ in t11is case from~ condition inherent to the instrument, and· th·n~ is no valid reason for rejecting them.

From .Tune 6, 1891, to November 15, 1891, the level was only rC'nd after the bisections of the star. Frmn November 15, 1891, to ..Tune :!5. 1892, readings were made before, as well. This course was necessary because no electric lights were provided until November 15, and the great sensitiveness of the levels made it inadvisable to hold the higl1ly heated bull's-eye lantern nea.r enough to read them before the bisection was made.

ATJ\IOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND TEXPERATURE.

The barometer and thermometers were tH;;ed several times every night in connection with tl1e determination8 of the force of gravity. The range duri11g the whole year iK so smnll that these fiwtors can lrn;ve no i111iuence on the latitude olmervatiou~ as far as cl1auge:"; in th~ refractitn1 are concerned. The in::->ide temp~~ratnre of the ob:-;ervatory was about a degree l1igher than the out~id<' temperature and the range for the whole year during the hours of obser,·ation was from lfl 0 0. in January to 260 in .A.ugust. 'J'lu· barometer ran fron1 753mrn to 76Smm.

the observatory work.

I. 5 cells bichromat{' of potash battery for zenith telescopn electric lights. Three cells ·were used for the hand ]amps an<l one cell for the axis lamp. This battery required n·ne,,·ing every two n1onths. II. 2 eells gravity hattery (sulphate of copper) for chronograpltic reg-istration of sta-r transits. The hattery required attentiou twice during tlw year. III. 1 cell Bnrnfoy dry battery for gravity flash ilJ"lparatns. Three of these cells sufiiced for the entire occupa-tion of \Yaikiki involving observations on nearly 200 nights.
REI,ATlVE l'ROBAJJLE ERRORS.

Since different opinions are hel·l among observers as to the relative merits of increasing the number of bisections on a star or increasing the number of levels to be read, or of reading the levels before and after the bisection, it is worth while t-0 examine tllis :t>oint in the light of the observations themselves. The case will a1so be considered where the levels are read only to the nearest half division. It would evidently be a waste of labor to work out a.JI the different cases or combinations that could arh:.e under the supposition of ont~, two, or three bisections. one or two levels, readings made before bi8ection or after, or readings made with two different degrees of aecurac.,v. This would require 24 cases, being the number of combinations of 4 things, taking lout of each of 4 collections, the different collections containing 3, 2, 2, and 2 things, respectively, or, which is the same thing if we consider the bisection and the inclination as the necessary r~quisites for the result, we have two collections with 3 and 8 things, respectively, which, as before, gives 24 cases. Of these ca.seR the folJowi11g are worth investigating and a.re here given wit,h the respective probable errors of observations and that of the mean result. TJ1e ob-

METHOD OF FINDING APPARENT PO;-;ITIONS OF THE

~'l'AHS.

Tile reductions from niea.n to apparent <l.eeliuatiou wp1·e HHHh_· by means of the iudepende11 t stnr nun1bers. ln Appendix No. 13, Report for-1888, a differential rnet11od is dcseribcd. Its applieati011 reduced the time a.nd lahor ahout olH'-half as l'ornpa.red with the usual way. But thi.s n1ethocl was devist~d to meet tl10 . ..,c cases wllere a large number of pa.in~ liad been obsP1Ted 011 a few eo1111,e(·utive nights. The time of occupation of a statio11 was supposed to he so Hohort that aft.er 011e date had been computed all other~ 1or that }lartienlar station could be derived with suffici~nt acenracy by considering the finite differences of the variables as differeutials. Jn the present case, howen.,,r, the prohJem i~ entirely different. Here Wt· have one station occupied tor more than a year, and eadi gl'oup of star;;; was continuously observed for three 1nonths. The difference in the two cases iR that in the for1ner many stars Wi·1·E· observed a few 11igl1ts, iu the latter a few stars were observed on
1na11y

nights.

1t is evident at the outset that whether we use Bessel's star numbers or the independent oues some sort of check compntatio11 must be made. ~loi-eover, when observations are nm.de on every clear night and iu a hwality where more than 200 nights can be obtained iu a year, it is probably immaterial whether we compute reductions for ueeessary datPs or whether we simply compute for every other day. It is desirahle to have the apparent declination of the stars with no greater error than oue or two hundredths of a second for latitude work of the highe;.;t precision. A comparison of the changes in the star's position between successive dates, as deduced by the independent numbers aud ~he urntbod here presented of applying .Bessel's numbers, shows that in the latter case the errors are absolutely without significance, whereas

74

AND

SURVEY.

the time of reduction is only about one-fourth that l'(~qnired by the usual independent nun1bers. The present method was suggested by the following facts: First, iuasmuch as the same star must be reduced for about, fifty different dates, a method should be employed in 'lvhich the quantitie~ depending on the star's posit.ion anrl those depending only on the date of observation are hand Jed separately. This avoids t11e introduction as a distinct quantity, into each day's computation, of those ternn; which do not change from da.y to da,y. For exainple, in the use of the independent numbers the logarithms of sine and cosine of the declination are added to tl1e others for every new date computed. Since the star constants do not vary, these are first computed and then applied to the differences of the varying day numbers. Besides, since a num· ber of stars were observed on the same date, we only have to apply the different star constants to the same differences of the day numbe1'S throughout the three months' period. Of the day numbers it is to be remarked that the principal term of A depends on the sine of the moon's a8cending node, and the corres1>0nd · ing one of B depends on the cosine of the same function. The values of A and B can therefore never exceed very much the numerical factor::; of their principal terms, so that three significant figures need only lie considered and they iuay be dealt with by rneans of Orelle's tables. C and D vary as the cosine and sine of the sun's lougitude, and onl.v change rapidly when they are small in amount, so that their change:-; a.lso are such that Crelle's tables give all the accuracy uec·essary. Since the obliquity is practically constant as far as these reductions are concerned, and as the sun's longitude does not ch au ge more than a few degrees between the dates chosen, the changes in C aud D are eitlwr small or quite uniform. It is therefore never necessary to use logaritlnn,; to get all the accuracy desirable for the reductions to apparent plaee. The star constants having been calculated for the star to be reduce(l, the values of dA and dB are taken from the Ephemeris, and dC all{} dB are calculated by using the formulre dO = 18·7 d cos 0 dB= 20·4 d sin 0 the values for dA, d-B, dC, ancl D being tabulated, the star con8tants a, b, c, and d are applied and the sum of the products gives the reduction from one date to another. · The following table gives the reductions from June 6 to June 28 for star I 1 a, · a = 1311 27m 46"', o = - 70 4', and a comparison of differences for the two methods. To compute the places by the independent star numbers for one group for three months, required generally about eiglit days, and a check computation using the same method would take ns long. By the method of applying differences for a check we get at the same reMult in about two days.

The sum of the residuals shows that the appanmt places for this w11ole month couhl have been obtained by simply adding the differences. The accumulation of error for the entire period is much less than W'·Ol, so that this short method is quite accurate enough to check the results. In the comnntations I had the help of the following persons attached to the Computing Divi&ion of the Survey: Mr. H. F~trquhar furnished the mean north polar distances for a.Uthe stars. .Mr. A. L. Baldwin computed the apparent places. Mr. H. L. Stidham checked these, and as~isted in the final reductions; arnl Mr. II. F. Flynn applied the micrometer and level corrections and deduced the latitudes. The final adjt1stment by least squares, the reductions to the mean declination systems and the derivation of the daily means was participated in by both Mr. Flynn and Mr. Stidham. _,::\_t the beginning of the work Subassistant John Nelson assisted for a Rhort time. I desire to express my obligations to all these gentlemen, as well as to Assistaut C. A. Schott, in charge of the Computing Division, who did everything in his power to facilitate the work. Illustration No. 14 shows the time of b~ginning and ending the observations of each group and the period during which any two or t~ree successive groups were obtmrved at the same evening. i:rhis ~hagram is inserted in order to avoitl the necessity of publishing tho Hi?ividual results in this particular form on a large sheet for the sake of showing the group cpnnections.

From the preceding individual values, all those nights were chosen on which complete series were obtained. These complete nights were collated for each group, and the daily means taken as furnished by ea.ch group. This made it posaible to redl6Ce each pair to a mean declination system by subtracting each separate, value of the latitude on any one night from the mean of all the pairs in the group for that night. Every night being treated in this way, and the mean bein~ taken, we have a. syst.em of corrections which, being applied to the1r appropriate pairs, reduce the individual values of the group to ~:me homogeneous syst.em.

In order now to connect the groups and reduce each one to the first taken as a basis of coillparison, the weighted means a.re taken for those parts of the preceding table wbich overlap, and we thus get the following group connections with their respective weights. The numbers of pairs indicate the weight, and are placed to the right of the quantities to which they apply.

The error of closing may result from errors of observation or :from a slight error in the constant of aberration. If the accepted constant (20"·445) is too small, as seems to be indicated by other observations, then there m.nst have been some compensation in the observing~ because the outstanding error, +-01, is practically insignificant. As several determinations of the constant of aberration give a valne not far from 20"·50. it is worth while "to RAA whn.t Aff'Mt. this value would

Results from observations for the 1-'arfaUon of latitude at Wa,ikiki, Hau:ai·ian Islands. ·
have if introduced in the computation of the apparent places of the stars. To this end all those values of the terms involving the constant of aberration for the dates of observation common to two successive groups were tabulated. Taking a inea.n for the two stars of each. pair and the difference between the corresponding pairs of successive groups, the final mean values gave the following e:ffec.t of those terms on the group connections :
I 4"''5 II 3"·6 III 4°·3 IV V VI VII VIII I II 4"·0 4"·9 4"·5 4""·3 31'1'·5 5//·2

The sum of these is +"·10, so that if we accept the supposed value of the aberration constant there would remain an outsta.nding error of +"·11 from observation arising from the uncertainty of the group connections. If we admit a certain compensation in the errors of observatfon then the above investigation would rather confirm the value 20"·445, or at least indicate that it should not be changed more than one or two hundredths. The values ofk 1 , k 2 , k 31 k 4 , and k5, being substituted in the correlatives, give the following values for V:

These being collected for short intervals in such a way as to give about equal weights for each period as regards nights and pairs, we have the following table for the variation of the lat.itude of Waikiki from June 8, 1891, to June 21, 1892. From the preceding method of reduction it will be seen that these Yalues, as far as concerns the changes of latitude, are entirely free from errors of declination.

The. preceding values a.re shown graphically in il~ustration No. 15. It is evident that a sine curve follows in a geueral way the law of the variation of the latitude. Coefficients for this equation were first determined assuming a period of 415 days for the complete revolution of t,he axis of rotation about that of the earth's figure. This brought out the fact that the period chosen was entirely too long, and, mo1·eover, that· a second periodic term, depending on the cosine, would materially improve the agreement between the empirical formula and the actual observations. This change being made, revealed the necessity of another slight change in the period, and one of 378 days was used. The equation of the curve is:
<p=<p0 -0"·3llsin. nt+0''·037 cos. nt.

This was deduced by a method of approximation devised t,o suit thi:;; particular case, and very similar in its application to Cauchy's method. It was hardly thought worth while to make a rigorous adjustment of the 49 conditional equations involved, because this curve fits the observations passably well. There are 22 above, 25 below, and 2 on the line. In order to apply the method of least squareE;, and to test whether there are periodic terms depending on the sineK and cosines of multiplf· angles of sufficient magnitude to influence the curve within the limit of errors of observation, a still further contraction of the above. values was made. Taking the means of successive groups of four a.nd allowing them equal weight we have the following mean dates and values of the latitude:

This equation is shown graphically in illustration No. 16 as well as the observational values from which it was derived. The first differential coefficient becomes zero at 71.40 and at 261.::Fo Hence there is a minimum ,at Sept.:,mber 14, 1891, and a maximum at April 2, 1892. The amplitude is 0. "62i. Of course a still closer agreement could be made by using the quadruple angle and so on until we should arrive at the number of cmulitional equations. Just how far this approximation :must be carried in order to bring out the real facts of the case can only be determined by appealing to the observations themselves. Some light is thrown on th(· subject by noting the concordance between theory and observation for successive ·'applications of multiple angles. To this end are shown in illustrations No. 17 and No. 18 the curves for equations de1}ending 011 the single and ·double angles, and also a superposition of one over tlle other for the sake of direct comparison. In the adjustment by least squares, when we have arrived at sucb. ~ 1 point that the probable error of one of the conditional equations is practically equaJ to that calculated in.dependently from the errors of observation and declination, we may safely conclude that a sufficient number of constants have been employed, and that all facts have been brought out which the accuracy of th~ observ.ation warrants. In the present case we have the following criterion. From the 63 pairs of stars used, the average probable error of a. declination is 0. 11257 and that of the mean of two declinations would be 0."181. The probable error of observation as already given is 0."155, so that the result of one determination of latitude would be subject to an error of v0.1812 +0. 2155 or 0."238. Ea.eh one of the latitudes used in forming the conditional equations is the result of combining about 200 individual

determinations, so that we should

As a matter of fact the least square work gives 0."021 for this quantity, so that we may con8ider that the corn~tants employed are sufficient and neces~mry to express the observations. The use of the triple angle is therefore justified, and the introduction of constants terminates here. Before closing, it should be added that the difference of about 0."5 between the determinations of Dr. :1\-'Iarcuse and my own is due to two eauses: the position of the observatories and the adopted star places. The Coast and Geodetic Survey observatory was 0."i> south of that of the International Associatio11 (see illustration No. 11), and the decli11ations deduced by Mr. Farquhar fo1· the ll1·adley-Auwers stars account for the remainder.

I have the honor to ...-ul>mit herewith a revort on the results of spirit of precision between Okolona. :\lis1'., and Odin, 111. This is in c·ontinuation of the exact leveling between tlu· Gulf of l\Iexico (at Biloxi and M·obile) and St. r_..oui:.;, l\lo. The latter plaee is reached from Odin by the Jeyels along the the thirty-ninth parallel. Re~pecting the starting point, Okolona, ~ee my report of September 28, 1888, aud for Odin a 11d St. Louis, see .A.ppendix :No. 8, ( '. and G. S. Rep. for 1882, p. 555.

*See Appendix No.14, C. and G., Survey Report for 1887. t Previous to 1889 the graduated brass rod supporting the sliding target was fastened to the wooden rod Oftly at its middle part1 a.llowing expansion and contraction of the sc&le up as well as down; at the bottom of the rod there was sufficient space left to permit of the greatest expected upansion unaer hi_gh temperature. The Index correction became thus large and variable. In July, 1889, this construction was changed, the brass scale and wooden rod were Screwed fast at theu bottom ends and the former was bent under the latter and in close connection with the contact knob which stands for the zero of the graduation; hence, there is no index correction to begin with, but wear will produce a small negative one.

Instruments Nos. 5 and() are of the same pattern as :No. 1; see plate No. 46 in C. and G. Survey Report for 1880. Coefficient of expansion of brass scale of rods 0·000018 for centigrade scale. A description of the permanent beuch marks is a1)pended to this report. Computation and results.-Field computations were made by the respective observers; the seeo11d or independent office computation were made by the following computers under the general supervision of Mr. L. A. Bauer, viz: Section I by Subassistant J. Nelson, aided by A. Bonnot, .J. B. 13oute11e, and H.F. Fly11n (< )ctober, 1892); Sectiou II by F. A. Young, while temporarily attached to the computing Division, aided by J. Page; Section III by F. l\L Little (September, 1888). Special tables of cotTections for curvature, refraction, collar i&equality, and temperature were coui-;trueted for each instrument to facilitate their applicatiou. The two computations were collated and the final results are as follows:

The probable errors of the resulting heights will have to depend on the discordauces of the forward and backward measures for Section~ I and II, and on the differences between results by rods E and F for t.lw simultaneous lines of Section III. Results thus obtained do 110t take into account systematic or constant errorR to which the observatious are known to be liable; this latter chts8 or uncertainty can only be recognized by the closing of loops of line~ of levels. The phenomenon of accurnulation of errors in the sa1ne direction is quite pron1inent in Section II, where, in a distance ofl.28km., and during about three months (October to .January), the discrepancy rises f'ro1n 11,.tn11" · to 3l_Orom. in a surprisingly steady manner; the rate of divergence is J·[)3·urn. per kilometre (or in angular value 0·3 11 ) , and is apparently uninfluenced by the varying circumstances during the measure of the line.· The serious part of thi8 behavior is the fact that we have no assurance that the mean result of the two measures converges to or diverges fi·om the true value of the le,·el. Throughout the line the temporary marks are about equa.Ily distributed and not far from a kilomet.re apart; hence we use the formula for the probable error per km-for double leveling r

ON THE RESGLTS OF SPIRIT LEVELING OF PRECISTO~ BET"'EEX CORINTH, MISS., AND M.EMPHIS, TENK .. PROM OBSERYATIONI"' MAUE IN 1890 AND 1891 BY ISAAC WINSTON, seBASSISTAXT, AND F. A. YOUNG, AID.

A re1mrt by CnAr:LES A. Sc110TT, Assistant and Chi<'f of the Computing Division. Submitted for publication March 10-J 1893.

The fo11owing report on the resultt-i. of 8pirit leveling between Corinth, Miss., and 1\-Iempbis, Tenu., is herewith re:spect,fully suhmitted. Coriuth is a station in the Jiue of levels from l\f obile to Odin, and l\fernphis is connected with the levels of the :Mississippi Biver from New Orleans to St. Louis; the present line therefore forms a tie be t'veen these liues. Route line.-The levels follow the track of the Memphis and Charlestou Railroad. Distance between bench mark V at Corinth and bench mark of U. e. E. at Memphis is lf>l <J km., or ~4·0 statute miles. See illustration (inset) to the pH~ceding appe11tlix (No. 3 for 1892). Obsert'ers and da,frs.-The ohserve1:~ were SubasHi~tant I. Winston and Mr. F. A. Young. The work was accomplished het,veeu November 7, 1890, and .January 23, 1891. In!<ltrnments and methods of olHwn:iing.-Two independent, lines were run, one forward (westerly), the other backward (easterly). Mr. Winston ran the 4(n"ward line from Corinth to La Grange, Tenn., ancl tl1e backward line from. Memphis to La. Grange, nsiug level No. 5. Mr. Young ran the backward line from I~a Grange to Co1·iutb, and tlae forwanl Ii nc from J..;a (irangH to l\Iempbis, m~ing level No. 6. Metric rods 1'" and 0 were employed. Instrnnumtal constants.-These are alS toJlows:

APPENDIX No. 5-1892.

ON THE TIDES AXD CURRJ·:NTS IN THE HARBOR OF EDGARTOWN AND
IN KATAMA BAY, MARTHAS VINEYARD.

A report by HENRY L. MARINIHN, AsF.di'!tant. Submitted for publication April 25, 1892.

The foHowing report on the tideH and currents in the harbor of Edgartown and Ka.tarna Bay, ~fassachusetts, based on observations made during the sumn1er of 1891, is offered in advance of one to be made on the" cornparisorrn of changes in the shores an<l botton1 of the harbor since previous surveys." In a report dated September, l88G, published as Appendix No. 9, I :eport for 1886, Assistant Henry I.1. 'Vhiting says:
The tidal c·urrents through the iulet, throngh the :narrows of Cotamy Bay, and through Edgartown Harbor, are now very strong. I alll unahle to state the exact velocity, but it has had the power to iucrease the depth of water along the front of the town and about the whar,·cs. The currents a.re also effecting a. change in the 1wsition and depth of the })oi.nt of Chappaquiddick, opposi.te t1ie town. They also affect the mant>nvering of vessels, which now do not like to anchor auove Cha.ppaqui.clclick Point. The fishermen state that the ocour of those currents is injuring th~ clam and quaha.ug grounds, which are of much local value. I haYo endeaYored to ~certain whether the tidal currents through the harbor were stronger now than when the inlet of 1856 was OJlen. 1'"'rom. such 'facts as I could gat,her, however, they seem to have about the same force. * * * That these strong currents must produce changes in the physical condition of the harbor seems self-evident. 'I'he very peculiar tidal phenomena conuectmi with it makes the study of the subject oue of special interest. Coll.lJlaTing the time the "Present inlet ha.s been open, ahont eight mouths, with the eighteen or twenty years of less effect,ive action since the former inlet olo8ed, the probabilities are that the harbor channels and shoals are still in a transition state.

At the time of l\Ir. VV.hiting's examination the barrie.r between Kat.am.a Bay and tbe ocean ba.(l just been broken tb.roug11, crea,ting the first opening in about twenty years. The statement about the strength of the currents in the report must have referred to the theu condition

as compared to that with no outlet through Katam.a Beach, and it is to be regretted that no observations of the velocity of the currents were made either under the condition of no opening, as in 1871, or of one opening, as in 1886. If the circulation through the harbor and bay induced strong currents with one openiug, the ca8e mu.st be aggravated with three inlets. It is believed that the conditions which now obtain throughout this locality have materially changed the regime of the tides and currents, and that, consequently, the present knowledge of these phenomena does not represent actual facts. This change is attributed to the existence of three inlets through the south beach of Katama Bay, which admit such a volume of tide water fron1 the ocean as to influence the tide throughout the bay aud harbor as far as Vineyard Sound. 'Vith no inlet from the oeean side, the tide in Katarna Bay is of the type of the Sound tide; with three inlets, the ocean tide, of greater range and difteriug in tilne, being freely admitted is the cause of the interferences shown in the accompanying diagrams. In order that one may follow the treatment of the tide and currents adopt.ed in t,his report, there have been introduced inuch of the observed data in tabular form. Illustration No. 20 shows the locality, with the locatiou of the tide and current stations. In Tables 1 to 4 will be found the observations of the titles at four stations situated along the path of the tide from the entrance into tlH· harbor to the ocean at the south shore. These observations,* coveriug somewhat Illore than one lunar month, are here grouped according to lunar hours; from these we obtain a. mea.n tide for ea,ch of the four stations. Illustration No. 21 reprei;;;ents these rnean tides, from which we can derive the synchronous differences in height of water surface at any time of the tide. The times of inaximum slopes and of restoration of level are graphicaJly reprei;;ented on Illustration No. 22. For greater practical use the intervals are referred to the time of high water at Edgartown lighthouse. It will be ob8erved that m.aximu1n ebb slope occurs 13 n1inute~ after high water; at this n1oment the current is setting from the Sound tlirough Katama Bay to the ocean at nearly Inaximun1 strength. The mean difference in height between the ocean and the Sound is then 1·75 feet; of thiH ditl'erence 55 per cent is found between the ocean and Ka.ta1na Bay, within a distance of one-eigl1th of a inile. It is safe to assume that under favorable conditions a slope 100 per cent greater thau the above may be found within the same limits.
.. Ob~rvatione -were ma.de during the· da~'tinie only, as bnt one self-registering tide gauge -waa available.

On the tides a,nd currents in the harbor of Edgartown and ·in Katarna Bay.
Maximum flood slope occurs 6h 25m after high water; the current is now settiug in the oppo~ite direction, but nearly one hour past maximum :-;trc11gth. The difference in heiµ:l1t betweeu ocean and Sound is 1 ·7:! feet, 57 per cent of \Vhich is located in the eighth of a mile betwet·n ocean a11rl hay. The rest01·atiou of level on a rising tide* takers place :!h 38lll before high water. This restoration of leYel is not quite synchronous, hnt the differences are so slight as to practically amount t() a level vJane. At this 1n01uent the current slack:-; and then turus froru north to south throughout the bay. The restoration of level on the fa.Hing tide occurs 3h 50m after high water, and at this moment the current slacks aud the ·turning from south to north follows. In Table 5 will be found the establishment of high and low water with that of tlw turning of the currents. It will be observed that the tide of the southern part of Kata ma Bay follows clo:::ely the tide of the south shore. At low declination of the moon this phase exteuds to the Swhnming Place; \Ve find then two distinct high waters, the first high water hi1ving the greater amplitude and occuring ,7-lflh XXXIVm after the moon's transit, while the second high water remains at the establislH"ent (XII 11 XXIXm) given in the table as the mean for a lunar

TIDAL CURREN'I'S.

OhservationR of tbe drift and set. of tho current::-:, were made with two Ritchie-:Haskell t:·lectric-enrrent 1neters (Nos. 3 and 4) at the :following stations: At the entrance to Edgarto,vu inner 11arbor, at the Swinuning Place, and in the i11lets into l~atarna Bay. The observations in the i11 letR were not wholly satisfactory, owing- to the great difficulty in stationing and holding- a boat for any leng·th of time in such exposed placP. The obi-;ervation:5 are, hcnvever, snfncit·nt to indicate the type of· curve of velocity, bnt tlo not represent f'airly tho 1naximn1n Rtrength. These curveH of velocity are exhibited 011 Illustration No. 23, in con1wction with the tidal enrves at the stations ·where ohst·rved. Nowhere within this field l1ave we recorded velocities exceeding fi fp£·t per second. \Ve are convinced that velocities twice as great may he fimnd and observed within these openingR. At the entrance to the iuner harbor, off Edg-artown light-house, the maximu1n strength observed fi.H' westerly current was 1·85 feet 1>er second a.bout 49 1ni11utes before lligh water,* and for easterly set 1·a5 feet per second, 5 11 23m after lilgh ·water. _.c:'\_t the S·winuning J>lacP, wlijeh is the narrowest part of the arm con11ecti11g Edgartown hn1Pr 11arhoe ·with Ka.tama, B~.Y, tJ1e cnrrei1tR a.re decidedly .st1·011ger~ tl1e greatest stn·11gth was 4-·2 fc-et pei· ~econd fi:n the sout.Iierly HCt! ]8 milmte:-; lwti.ffc high water. ])nring the 11ortherly Het. the 1naximnm ~trength waR tc)nlltl to be :!·75 f{·et p(~r i:-;ceoud [)h 2:)"' after high water . .A. t the west opeuiug, t11e gr<~atcst i-:>trm1gth was not fully ascertaiuecl Jor reasons stated before.. For f'Ont11er1y current~ the 1naximum strength will occur near the tra1u;it of the moon, or about 13 minut<·s after high water at Edgartown lig.ht-hornse. For northerly flow, the maxiinum Rt.rength will OCCUl' about (-)h OOm after high wat-0r at, Edgartown light-house. In the iniddfo opening, the period of HtrP:ugth of cnrreut f<>1Jowi-: closely that approximated f()r the western inlet. At the eastern opening, which iH on tlH,~ threshold of closing up, the current:;; present anom.alies which might develop in Rpecial featur<"S with a n1ore extended series of observations than those now at hand. The observed intervals of l1igh and low water, and the turuing of the currents after the transit of the moon, for four stations, will befound in Tables 6 to 9. These tables are appended more with t11e purpose of securing their preservation for future use, if needed, than for

further

discu~sion.

The data contained in them can be reenforced by supplementary observations at any future time.
*Whenever high water is mentioned -without specifying the place it refers to the high wat-er at Edgartown light-house.

Submitted for publication April 7,

In comparing the surveys of the ocean shore, lines of Nanhwket Island, we have been obliged to limit tbe inqniry to an examination of the shore Iiue as defined by the crest of t!Je ]Jigh-water line, without C'onsideriug any shift of the submerg:ecl portiou of the eoa.st beearn;;;e of the irn..,nfliciency of the data. afforded by the.earlier hydrographic sur- · veys. Altb0ngh the recent surveys of 1800-'!ll <·ont.ain numerous cross 8f·.ctions with souudings, they did not fall on a sufficient nu1nl1cr of depths on the older surveys to permit of reliable results by comp11rison. This comparison is based on measures taken from a point of origin, determined on each cross section hy actual measurement in the field. The geographical position of this point of origin was afterward obtni11ed hy platting on the chart and measuring hy scale to the nearest meridian and parallel of latitude. The island of Nantucket is fast becoming of great importance as a summer resort, a statement fully warranted by tl1e increasing number of hotels and cottages built there each year. The examination of the stability of its shores thus becomes of prime importance to this su111mer population as well as to fl1e inhabitants engaged in its shore tisheries. , The absence of the knowledge whiclt is brought out by just such a comparison as this, periuittcd the Joeation, son1e years since, of a line of railroad aud many valuable build.in gs U\)011 a part of tlie sl1ore wl1ere the changes are so great tltat in a few years more the ground on wl1ic11 tlley stand will have been washed into the Sf~a and tlie capita] involved

lost beyond recovery.

U.

S.

COAST

AND

GEODETIC

SURVEY.

The data upon which thit; comparison is based will be found in tabular form in Table No. 1; part of this da"ta can again be utilized in future comparisons. An inspection of the accompanying illustration (No. 24) reveals the fact that the ocean shore of the island of Nantucket is divided into two great exposures to wind and sea. The part from Great Point to Siasconsett having an eastern exposure, tempered by off-lying shoalH, and the part from Siasconsett to Smiths Point, at the western end of the island, having a southerly expoRure without mitigatiug conditions from off-shore shallows. The abrading force of the waves should therefbre difler sensibly on these two portions of the shore, and we find this to be the case, as will be shown further on. Befbre presenting the general results of the comparison as to these two diYisions of exposure it will be interesting to note a few local changes since 1846.
THE STABILITY OF GREAT POINT.

(See illustration No. 24.)

The comparison discloses a re1narkable stability oftbis exposed sandy point. The end of Great Point is sharp and well defined- The oscillation of· the point as indicated by its position in 1846, and again iu 1887-'90, is contained within the circumference of a circle with a radius of 15 metres. The position in 1846 and 1887 falls within a circle with a ra;dius of only 5 metres. It may be noted that during the period since 1846 these shores have been visited by very severe gales, notably that of 1851, known as the Minots Ledge gale. We have no survey showing the position of this point imn1ediately preceding and following that gale, but whatever may have been tbe damage in 1851 it had regained its position in 1887 and maintains it to this day.
CHANGES AT THE HAULOVER.

(See illustration No. 25.)

The name of Haulover is given to that part of the beach which separates the head of Nautncket inner harbor fro1n tbe ocean. Some importance a.ttaches to this locality from the fact that attempts have been made to induce the General Government to appropriate the meaus for cutting a passage through tbe beach. An attempt of this kind was made in 1871 through a petition signed by the citizens of Nantucket. According to the petitioners, the object to be gained was twofold; first, that of creating an harbor of refuge in the bay called the head of the harbor, and, secondly, to increase the tidal scour over the bar at the entrance to Nantucket inner harbor. The Coast Survey was asked at that time to make a resurvey of tbe locality, and the work was intrusted to Assistant Henry :Mitchell.

On the changes in the Qcean shore Hncs of Na,ntucket

Mr. Mitchell reported favorably on the project, but nothing came of it. A fow years later, in 1874, the Uuited States Engineers again made surveys of the harbor and the Haulover, but their report, published in the report.to the Chief of Engineers for 1875, Part II, p. 375, was not favorable to the project. In 187 4 the width of the Haulover beach was about 450 feet between low-water .mark inside and the same datum outside. In 1890 the narrowest width, on cross section No. 53, was found to be 2HO feet between low-water marks. This shows a loss of width of 160 feet in sixteen years, or at the rate of 10 feet per year. This is, however, 011ly a close approximation, because based on the assumption that the measurement taken in 1890 was 111ade at the same place, or nearly so, as that of 1874. If we compare the width in 1846 we fintl 459 feet as against 170 feet· in 1890, or a yearly erosion of 6~ feet. This is the more reliable state1nen t, and if taken in connection with the preceding testimony \Ve can only infer that the retreat of the shore 1nay have been much greater bet\veen 1874 and 1890 than duri~ig the preceding period to 1846. The erosion has obtained almost entirely on the oeean side, so that where the shore line was iu 184G we have in 1890 a depth of water of 18 feet. The shore line inside the beach has remained almost stationary. Usually where a beach is found with a low cross section and a body of water back of it, the storm waves, in making a ,breach over the beach, carry over a large volume of sa11d, which is deposited on the itmer slope and rnaint'ains the width of the beach while beatinc: it back. This does not seem to have been the case at the Haulover, although t11ere are evidences of the wash of the waves through sloughst into the lrnrbor. As far as known there has never been an opening througli the Haulover, and from a study of the conditions which exist here it is very doubtful if any opening could be maintained for any length of time·. 'l'he situation of the Haulover has been compared to that of Katan1a ueach, Marthas Vineyard, but the conditions differ in t11ese two cases. On the south shore of the Vineyard the seas are much more boisterous than at the ]Iaulover, and these have repeatedly forced a passage through Katama beach, a wider and stronger barrier tha.n the I-Iaul over. There is also a greater difference of level of the water surfaceB at Katama, giving a greater scouring force to the current than can he obtained at the Hanlover. A close approximation to the time when the natural forces shall have worn away the Haulover beach or forced a passage through into the
"These widths a.re men.sured between high-water lllarks, inaide and outside, as measurements between low-water marks could not be obtained from the survey of

upper harbor may be made from the data quoted above. With the conditions remaining the same, it will take less than twenty-two years for the Haulover beach to be a thing of the past.
ADVANCE OF THE BEACH AT SIASCONSETT·

(See illustration No. 26.)

·

There has been a marked advance of the beach since 1846. This advance of the shore line begins at a point 428 metres north of Saukaty Head light-house, and extends for a distance of 3 miles to a point about one-half mile south and west of the village of Siasconsett. The greatest advance (255 metres) occurred just west of the southern end of the village. Directly opposite the center of the village, where the beach is used for bathing, the advance bas been slightly less than 100 metres. This favorable condition has protected the foot of the bluffs in the vicinity from the wash of the seas so that they have suffered but slight erosio11 in years past. The summer visitors to this quaint village continue to increase yearly, and the number of cottages built yearly is also on the increase. The -fishing interest is represented by dory fishing for bluefish and mackerel in season.
POINT OF GREATEST 'WEAR OF THE SOUTH SHORE.

(See illustration No. 26.)

The greatest erosion of shore and bluff line since 1846 is .found at Surfside, 11ear Weeweeder. The cut iuto the bluff." extends from Forked Ponds to Weeweeder, a distance of 3~ iniles. The height of the bluffs, within this distance, averages 22.4 feet above mea.n sea level, while the width of belt eroded varies from zero at J;....,orked Ponds to Hto metres OJlposite SurfSide Ilotel. The mean width of the eroded belt is 389 feet, ·which gives an area of land of 165 acres worn away in f(Jrtyfour years. The survey of 184() shows the blnft' line in the san1e relatiou to the high-water line as in 1890. We may therefore conclude tliat the volume lost at Surf'side is about 6,000,000 cubic yards. Part of this 1naterial has goue westward and lodged on shore at J\.ffrtcoruet Rip.
CHANGE IN THE SHORE LINE AT MIACOMET RIP.

(See illustration No.

2~.)

A sharp advance of the shore line is here noted. "The configuration is changed from a concave shore in 1846 to a convex curve in 1890. Ju consequence of this change the landing place for the fishing fleet ba8 been shifted eastward to Surfside. The currents over the rip have not undergone any cl1ange as far as known. This is a noted fishing ground for bluefish and mackerel.

On the changes in the ocean shore Uncs of lt~autucket Isutnd.
CHANGES AT SMITHS POINT.
(See illustration No. 27.)

The most western end of the island of ~ autucket has been called Smiths Point. This point is most erratic in position. In 1846 it was situated at the end of a long and na1Tow sandy beach, almost directly west of the island of Tuckernuck. Ten years later, in 185G, the point was about 1 mile to the eastward, and in 1887 the point to which the name of Smiths was applied was found to the southwest of Tuckernuck Island 31 miles east. of its position in 1846. These remarkable changes are exhibited in illustration No. 27, whfoh -shows the position in 1846-1856-1887 and 1891. In 1846 the south shore extended westward past the island of Tuckernnck, leaving a waterway 250 metres wide between it and that island. In 1856 this waterway remained about the same, but between 1856 and 1887 the storms wrought a great change in this locality. The beach wltich was a part of Nantucket Island and which protected the south shore of Tucker11uck Island had been beaten back on the island, filling lll> the water space existing in 1856. A new inlet had also broken through this beach at a point southeast from Tuckeruuek, which l'emained open at the last survey in 1891. The survey of 1887 shows an extension of old Smiths Point beach to the westward asfarasMuskegetJsland since 1846, but under what condition this growth took place has not been ascertained and m.ay not be. It is probable that much of the material with which this point is maintained came from the south shore of Nantucket; the wear and tear of Tuckernuck Island shore and Mnskeget Island shores may have furnislied a sma11 quota, but the bulk came from the south shore. We inay now consider the results of the comparison for the entire length of the exposed shore of Nantucket from its eastern end at Great Point to Smiths Point. The comparison gives an average yearly erosion and consequent retreat of the shore line of 0·81 metres for the period 1846 to 1891. If, however, the seaward face of the island is divided into two great exposures, as previously alluded to, one from Grea.t Point to the elbow a.t. Siasconsett and the other from Siasconsett to Smiths Point, the firtst one, being an easterly exposure tempered by outlying slwals, should offer the minimum yearly wear aud tear, and this is the case. Between Great Point and Siasconsett the average yearly retreat was 0·19 metres, and between Siasconsett and Smitl1s Point the average retreat was 1 ·42 metres, or 747 per cent of the rate for the easterly exposure. Between 1846 and 1887 the yearly retreat was 1 ·29 metres for the southerly exposure and 0·18 metres for the easterly exposure.

U.

S. COAST AND

GEODETIC

SURVEY.

The area of land lost to the sea on the south shore iu the forty-five years since 18-Ju is :3.50 acres, or a yearly average of nearly 9 acres. The conclusion from the foregoing evidence is that the sea is inevitably encroaching upon the southern and eastern shores of the island at a comparatively rapid rate. 'Vhat is the result al~rng tlJe northern shore, bathed by the waters of the Sound, is not in evidence, but it is reasonable to say that the results are in the same direction, but on a smaller scale. The comparison involved the examination of eleven original surveys, differing in scales, of which tracings had to be made. This will indicate to a certain exteut the amount of work to be performed beiore arriving at results which may be expressed in a few figures. The four diagrams accompanying the report were prepared by Mr. Homer P .. Ritter.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

With the present or fourth report of the results of the magnetic observations made at Los Angeles, Cal., between 1882-1889, the series of reductions is concluded. Part I· contains the results of the absolute measures, parts nt, III:f:, and IV, those of the differential measures of the declination, and of the horizontal and the vertical components of the magnetic force respectively; to the last part has also been added the resulting variation of the dip and of the total magnetic force. The vertical-force ma,gnetometer.-In consequence of the great sensitiveness of the adjustment of this instrument with respect to te1npeJ:'.ature, the scale of value of the balance magnetometer had to be frequently redetermined, nor could a uniform value be applied for the whole series. The scale is exactly similar to the unifilar and the bifilar ivory scales, it being graduated to half millimetres. As mounted, the zero division is at the bottom end, the 500 or last division at the top. It is secured to a vertical brass arm attached to the slate slab, and its numbers appear erect and to increase downwards. Length of one division of scale,
o-507mm.

The horizontal magnet, mounted on a knife edge, is about 16-!o out of the magnetic meridian, its north (seeking) end bearing magnetically N. 16!0 E.; thus the angle between the incident and reflected rays of light is 32io· Increasing scale numbers correspond to a downward motion of the N. (seeking) end of the n1agnet or to increasing vertical force. Angitlar 1.'al-ue C>f one division of the scale.-We have the fo1lowing dimensions: Front edge of npper end of scale to mirror, 40·89 inch (103·86cm); curvature, 0·065 inch (0·165°m); thickness of rim, 0-065 inch (0·165cm); two-thirds thickness of mirror, 0·067 inch (0·170°m); hence · r = 104·36em, angle of plane of scale with plane normal to center of mirror . 1·524 ( lt, = 0·6 inch), tan a= 104 ~ 36 , and a = oo 50' 12"; hence r cos a= 104·35 l and c:i 3437·75 2 r = 0'·8351.

=

To determine the corresponding space on the vertical-force trace, we have distance from vertical-force cylinder to face of mirror, plus two-thirds thickness of mirror, 57·135 + 0·067 .;inch (or 145-293cm), and 0·0507 x 145·293 =0·070 593°m. Now let k'=the distance from the plane 104·35 (or rather from the conical surface) of the ray which makes the Iunrinous dot to the plane of the normal of the mirror, then by measure

Secondly, for results from the oscillations it is apparent, particularly when the magnet o"cillates .in the vertical plane, that the time of one oscillation varies directly with the amplitude of the swing and not in accordance with the law for reduction to an infinitesimal arc; hence the greater the amplitude the smaller the value of k. J f, therefore, we should make our amplitude of oscillation .-.ufficiently large and our distance of deflection sufficiently small, \YC might get accordant res alts by the two inethods, hut we would ·not yet be sure that these ;iccordant results accura)ely represent the degree of sensitiveness of <HU" m.agneton1eter.

The remaining (1eterininatious have been omitted, since subsequently no use was made of the series 1885 to 1889. Throughout the seven years' record, and fbr each observer, there appears a systematic difl"erence iu the values of k as derived from the oscillations and from the deftectioJJs, the latter giving a smaller value. Frmn a general scrutiny it would seen1 that the tletlection results are rno1·e trustworthy than tlie oscillation results, at leaRt the tlevia.tions of the valueR for different distances keep within tolerably narrow limits and with little dependence on the deflecting distance, whereas the oscillation results i::;bow great.er discord due to the difficulty of getting a true value for U1e tiine of one oscilla.tioh whPn the magnet is 1uade to swing on iti-:. knife-edge.

The vatrres of k ndnalJy ndopted in the rednction of the differential ob:-;ervationR are specially noted on the monthly records. The average
value is 0.000 117. It is obvious from t.he above reRults that the instrn1nent was not performing satisfactorily; tllis is supposed due to~lie want of 8ymmetry in

the dh~tributiou of rnasse;.:;; wjth respect to tl1e plane of tlte knife-edge a11d to the fact that the instrnrneut was badly balanced, turning almost about one point in the kuifc·e(lge nearest the 1na.gnet, instead of resting ev(·n ly along its entire edge. '.l'llus the magnet had a teudeuey to place it ::-;plf in the ma.guetic meridian. It is also supposed that the small dimensions of the magnet in comparison v>ith tile 1nassive appendages were unfavorable to ih; efficiency, but the principal cause of the unsatisfactory working of the instrument was the unequal eftect of changes of temperature on different materials uns.lfnt·m.. etrica.lly distributed with reference to the knife'-edge.*

The instrumental means by which the temperature of the verticalforce magnet has been ascertained are explained in detail in the pr·eceding Part III of the discussioll. The thermograph record between February, 1883, and J\:fay, 1885, answers for both the bifilar and the Lloyd balance magnets, and the only differ~1ce in the treatment for the two magnets consists in subf-1.tituting the thermometer readings under the bell glass of tlie Yerti~l-force magnet for the readings of the thermometer of th~_bitila~

Correction for shift of zero of scale.-A more serious diffieulty tlrnn that of freeing the differential measures from the effects of change of temperature was encountered in the ever-changing adjustment for the zero of scale. .After plotting the daily mean readings on suitab]c crosi;.;. ruled paper, it became apparent that these changes were of the moRt irregular character; tlie readings for short or long periods would sometimes decrease, sometimes increase.· All that couhl he do1u,, was to trace a curve with a free hand and apply as a correction to each dail.v mean the corresponding ordinate between thi:-;; trace and au adol'h"d normal reading, viz, 100 divisions.

GENERAL REJ\1ARKH ON ~'HE Dll:<"'FERENTIAL SEJtlES OF OBSERVATIONS

OF THE VERTICAL FORCE COMPONBN'.L'.

Tl1e remaining uncertainty in the hourly readings of' the balance ma.guetorneter due to onr imperfect knowledge of the reduction for changes of teinperature, no less than the apparently fitful changes in the position of the zero of the scale due to the instrurnent not keeping in adjnst1neut, has necessarily lin1ited the useful record to the two years frorn November, 1882, to October, 1884. Even within this limit it was not f'ound practicable to separate {lil"lturbed from normal values, since it ·was not known to what extent the above iinperff>._,etions were mixetl n p with actual magnetic distnrhance~; inore refined inyestigations, sneh aR the lunar inequalities or the influence of sqlar rotation, were entirely out of the question. The two-year series of hourly scale readings (corrected for changes of temperature ancl of scale) are appended to this paper; for eaelt inonth there a.re given the daily 1neans as well aR t.he inonU1ly mea.11s 1or eacl1 of the twenty-four hours, a18o the differenees of each of the latter fro1n the monthly 1nean vaJue of all hours or days.

AND

GEODETIC

SURVEY.

In general the diurnal variation of tlie magnetic force is characterized by two extreme values, one occurring at some - 1norning hour, the other at some afternoon hour; these iuclnde tl1c principal 1ninirnum, which takes place an hour or two from noon, either before or after. The re8nlt from two years of observations (Sovember, 1882, to October, 1884, inch1Rive) shows that the 1naxitunn1 force is n·ached about 7 o'elock a. m., the 1nininnun a.bout noon, and a second extren1e high value is reached about. au hour aft.er 1ni«lnig-h t, though the rapi·] rise of the intensity appears '~hecketl about 7 o'clock p. iu. At otl1er Jlhtccs the afternoon CXtTPil1C i~ 1nore intense than the lllOl'lling extn~me, OUt the two values differ little in iuteusit,v. Jn the followiug taule I have brought together for comparison tlie hourly va1ues of

oV -\r·

for the annual average at four ~orth AnH:>rican

stations. The values for Toronto, Canada, are tlw:~w given b.v Sabine and refer to the five years from 1K4)>Q to 18.J.8~. rl'he Philaclelphia series is ta ken frou1 the Coast Snrve.v Heport ffw 18G:l, appe11dicei-; 19 and 20. eha1lging·, ho"\Vt'ver, tlle sigu of the variation which appear<:·d to me demanded;* tlae value~ refer to the ye.ari:-; 1841 to 18.J.:l~, and extend over four and one-half years; they are partly l10urly, partly bi-hourly; only the latter are. given here. The Washington serieH compril-'es the two years 1889-'90, and is ta ken fron1 the results published hy the lT. S. Naval Observatory (\Vashi11gt-0n, 1891 ).
* \Vht>n inaking; so1n·~ prelintinary cotnpariHons relating to tlu' diurnal variat io11 last July l noticed that at Philadf'lphia, when contra.steel wit.11 other phieeH, the occurrences of Tnaxinta antl uiiuin1a a11peared to he interclia11gf'cl or <dse that the ;..ii.:.n" -were uot correctly iuterpl"etecl; tbis Jed me to a closer t·xau11nat.ion ot· the record and of tl.te results. The ohscrvation8 ·were JH1blisLed in 184-7 Jn four octavo volumes, as a puhlic <lom.1111Pnt, l1y order of· the Unitecl 1 '5tates Senate; the reduction a111l diB~ cussion of these ohsernltions hy Dr. A. D. Bache (and in which he w-as assii-;w1l hy the "\Yriter) are given in the Smithsonian contrihut.ions to knowledge ancl reprinted in the Coast Survey Repm·ts for the years 1859-'60-'6:3-'63-'f.)4. In volume u, p. 1818, we tiud "inc1·ea8in[t seal~ readings correspond to dt~creaBing iorce/ 7 and the .sarue inforn:1ation is engrave<l at t.he bottom of the p]atN·· of dia,granis which exhibit the changes of the vertical force fro1n .January, 1841, to the close of the series, for which sef' volurrie IV {printecl in 18:-15); fnrther, the diagrams themseh-es show the force to be near its nia,,cimum about noon. In volu1ue uf, p. 3128, we again. meet the statement that increasing scale readings f'or ve1:tical-foree inagneton1eter corres1JOnd to decrease of force; and the dil'lctu;sion is in a.ccorcl with the record. Now i t would appear that these ~tat-emcnts in the orig-iu~l record are t.hc reverse of what they should lH~, siuce ahont noon we ought t.d have the s1nl"l1Jl'r yalues, i. e., the n1iniun.un and not the maxinunn force should be indicated. Thi~ reversal by inadvertenct'·· did not £ur'ther obtrnde itself on the attention of the computer at this early datP, when hu.rdly more than a single station existed with ,,·hich to compare results, the non-accord of the variations dednce1l t·or Philadelphia and Toronto being ascribed to their different geogra1"lhical positions. 'Vitb the signs reversed we obtain a. good correspondeuce respecting the prevalence o:f a weaker vertical jorce a.bout the time of midday than the average force throughout the twenty-fonr hours; this holds for Philadelphia, Toronto, Dublin, "\Vashiu~on, Los Angeles, and other places. The required change of sign also atl"ectf.I mort~ or Jess tlie re<lnctious and conclusions presente<.l in the. Cb.a.st Survey Report f01.· 1863, appendices 19 and 20, and Re1mrt for 1864~ appendices 16, 17, and 18.

Los Angeles, 0·000 560 iu parts of V. Toronto, 191 Washington, 200 Philadelphia, 667 As partly ex11laining the relatively large arnplitud1~ at Los Angeles, it shonld be remembered that the epoch of observation at that place <·oincides with a sun-spot maximum (in 1883), whereas at Toronto it coincides with a 1mn-spot minimum {in 1843), and the same holds for 'Va.shiugton with minimum in 1889; yet we find Phihtdelphia, to be an exception, viz, a large alllJ)litude though the sun-spot minimum Qccurred in 1843. * The diurnal variation is shown graphically on the accompanying illnstra~on, No. 28. ·
"Pos!Jibly the very hea\·y magnet employed at Girard College, Phila.-lel11hia, may furnish a clew to the large amplit\1de dne tQ it.a inertia.

SURVEY.

It is ev-ident from a perusal of the above table that a mncb greater number of stations and longer series will be needed before we can be justified in attempting any generalization for North America respecting the diurnal variations of the dip and of the total force. Insturbances of the vertical component of the forcc.-The great magnetic storm* of November 17 to 20, 1882, falls within the li1nits of tlle better part of the vertical-force record and demands attention in order to complete our infbrrnatiou of it as well as of the magnitude of t11e disturbances in tbe dip aIJd in total magnetic force.. The storn1 commenced suddenly a short time before 2~ o'clock a. m., No-vember 17, and continued until about 7 o'clock p. rn., November !!O, thus lasting three days and sixteen and one-balf hours. 'I'he. agitation of the 1nagnets 'vas continuous during this time, but on each day it apparently abated somewhat in violence between tl1e hours of 10 a. m. aud 4 p. m. The stor1n set in according to the declinatiou trace at 2h 25"', north end of magnet deflected to the 1cest; amount, 40'; according to the horizontalforce trace at 2 11 2nm, force increasing, 2() divisions (or 0·00280 H_) + an uu k11ow11 distance, through the failing of the trace; according to the vertical-force trace at 2 1' 26"1, force increasing, 12 <liYisions, or (H>0205 parts of V. The extreme position of each magnet was reached before 3h, after wbich the direction of the disturbance was reversed. Durhig this time the dip was certainly affected as much as 1' SF' (less tlian the normal); how 1nuch more is not known for want of the horizontal-force trace. ~rhe total fC:Jrce had increased by 0·00224 F. and beyond. The distnrbance was probably at its heigl1t November 17, between 18h and 20", wbeu the horizontal force was below and the vertical force above their normal values, wbile the north end of the declination magnet was deflected to the east. This remarkable storm_ was accornpauied by powerful and sympathetic (in tiine and euergy) earth currents, which interferecl with or interrupted telegraphic communication; besides, there was on the evening and night of November 17 an auroral display of unusual maguifieence. Ou the same day there was visible to the (protected) naked eye an enormous sunspot,t which at the time of the first outbreak of the magnetic disturbance was yet to the effst of the solar central meridian. As at Lo:;; Angeles, the outbreak of the storm wai;; Rudden at G-reeuwichi and happeued at November 16, 22 11 J 5m G. J\.f.

A_ magnetic storm of but slightly less intensity occurred OH .June 24 and 25, 1885. lt was characterized by two sudden outbreaks about 5!- honrs apart on .Tune 24. Photog1·aphic traces of this remarkable storm were obtained at seveuteen different observatories situated in North A.merica, Burope, Asia, and Australia.* According to the Los Angeles traces, the outbreaks occurred as follows:
First impulse (about

The character of the tlistnrlm11ces at these epochs was the same, bnt the second one was the HHffP hitense of the two.

LINT~,

MARKINGS, ETC.

The primary base liue in Ripley County, Ind., laid out by my party in October aud :N°oYember, 1890, was located on the hig·h and nearly level table land between the towns of Holton and New 1\la.riou. 1 t:-; length is 5,500 metres, ftnd its direction is nearly north and south. ru order to avoid the creek near it~ north eu<l., it was swung to the -west- ward from a true uorth and south line. North base is in Otter Creek Towu:.;bip, about 1 mile east of l-Iolto11. on the Ohio and J\Iissi~sippi Hailroad. South base is in Centre Towuship, and a.bout half a mile north of the village of New l\farion. rrhe uuderground and surface marks placed to secure the ends of tl11 bai-;e after the completion of the measurements were as !'l.bown iu t.he acc01upauying sketch (illustration No. 30). The sub-surface mark W:ll"i a copper bolt, set in a lhnestone post 6 inches Hquare and 2 feet loll,.?.·, wllich was sunk in the earth till its top was 3 feet below the surfoct'. At the interi:;ection of cross lines cut on the top of the bolt, a fine ltole one-quarter of an inch deep was drilled to mark the station P' :11t. Above and a,ronnd the post, except for a space of 1 fbot. square iI nwdiately over it, is a layer of Portland cement concrete 1 foot thicl a tHl 4 feet squ3,re1. Upon this foundation rests a block of limestone 3 fet·t square and 30 inches higl1, having a copper bolt with cross m.d fitw .drill lwle sunk into its top at the centre, this hole being the 1.urfi:.te{· mark of the end of the base. To protect the~e surface i.narks fron1 injury and to indicate conspicuously the ends of the base, limestone shafts were placed in posit.ion oye1· them. The one at North Base had inscriptions on three of its faces, al'i shown in the illustration, and the one at South Base was similarly inarked. All of the prepar~l>tions for the actual measurement were ,.mpletr·d ~arly in June, 1.8!-ll. ~l"hese included the clearing of the line. the fencing of the camp ground, the Jlitching of tl·e tents twenty-two iu n.atnber, 'fil1e construction of a co1nparing bouse with railroad and track 110 ntetres long, the setting of posts for microscopes, and the determilw· tion of the hei~ht of North Base above sea. level by le v-elings to the <nearest beu~h mark of' tbu tra~continental line of geo~e~o IeveJing.

Before the ba.se apparatus arrived from \Vashiugton, section st-0ues were set at 1.,200, 2,100, 3,000, 4,000, aud 5~000 metres from South Base and carefully aligned. Stones were also set at 3,900 and 4,900 metres to mark the ends of the kilometre intended to be measured with tLe standard bar encased in ice. These section stones were cubical block:-:. of limestone, 1 ioot iu each dimension, aud set in beds of eoncrete ];) inches square and 15 inches deep. In the top of each stone was secured a copper bolt, 1 inch iu diam_eter and 3 inc11es loug, with a fine cros:s cut on jts bead. The levels run along the line from North Base to South Base made ea.ch of these section stones a, beuch mark wen determined in height above sea level. 'The comparing house, with railroad a11d track 100 n'letres long, and posts for lllicroscopes, was finished.
BEGINNING AND PROGRESS OF THE MEASl!REMENTS.

On July 27, 18Ul, the instruments were unpacked and prPpared for work, by Assistants Tittmann and \V ood ward, and on the 28th a meas1remeut of the base was begnn by Assistant 'J ittmann at ~ South dase. His party consisted of 4 officers, beside himself, aud 4 uien, and they were employed for thirteen and one-half days in making two complete measures of the base, besides two additional measures of the kilometre, between stones at 3,900 and 4,900 metres from South Base, laid out to be measured by the standard bar in ice, the second measure having been finished on August 13. During this time Assistant Woodward, assisted by Mr. Siebert and one or two hands, was engaged in experiments with icel\ bar aud tape:o; i 11 the comparing house. On ~"\.ugust 14 he began setting posts on the kilometre for supporting tltP portable track, and the microscopes, using all of the available force of lal,ore1·s. Owing to continual rains, the ground was saturated with n10i~tnre and the work was much delayed. Stakes for supporting the tape during measurement were also set, at 10 n1etres apart, t11e whole length of the base line by Assistant Wood ward, and some parts of the line were"1llade ready for tape measurement, and 011 August 28, 29, and ::n, a,ud September 1 and~, u1easureruents were made by officers alone, aud ou September 8, lH, 17, 18, 23, and 28, and October 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8, measurements were made, usually at night, with a full force of officers and men. '.rhe first measure of the kilometre, with standard bar in ice, wa.& hegnu by Assistant Woodward on September 10 and continued on the 11th, 14-t11, 15th, 26th, 28th and 2!lth. Experimental measurements were made by Assist.a.nt Tittmann with the secondary apparatus~ on AQgust 17, 18, 22, 25 and 26, and September 3 , 7, and 8. He n1easured 100 metres of the kilometre with this apparatus on the 21st and 22d, and made measures of the_ whole kilometre with ~ndary apparatus on September 24 an~ 25, and October 5.

COST OF 'l'HE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS.

A record, a:-; 11early as possible, was kept of the number of dayR spent iu each operation, with the number of officers a.nd n1en employed eaeh <lay, and an attempt is inade in tl1e table which foHows to give the comparative cost, calling each officer or n1a11 einployed one day one day':-: work, and the results are expressed in day':-:; '''Ork of oue otlicer or ina.11. In regard to the time spent in preparing the standard kilometre for nieasurement, and the time spent in setting stakes, tliere was nece~ sarily so1ne eonfnsion, as frPqneutly son1e of the party would be at work on each of these operations on the same da-v, but the result givell is belieyetl_ to be substantially correct. 'l'be tilne s1H·nt in measures with the tape could not be absolutely fixed, as the uwasures 'vere n1ade sometimes for a few hours in tl1c night with a detail of officers alone, souietimes with officers aud ineu in the day or night, and no complete u1easuremeut of the whole ba~e with the tape was ever 1nade but only by parts, seYeral ti1nes repeated. J\feasureuieHts were u1ade on fourteen different days or nig11ts, and assuining that each mea.sureineut took one-half day's time of each officer and n1an employed we would have sixty-nine and one-half days fr1r one mau spent in tave n1easure. J)istances of frorn 300 metres to 4,800 n1etres were ineasured at ouP tilne, inostly at night, and when 1ncu were employed we paid thew for oue-ha]f a day':-:; work.

bcrt, who verified all of the preliminary calculatiou.s rclatiYe to the stability and effi.cfoncy of the apparatus, and who daborated mauy of tlte designs and made mo.st, of the working drawi11g:,.; for its construction. I am particularly indebted also to ::\Ir. E. G. Fischer, chief me· c:lianician of the Survey, whose knowled.1;1;e of and :-.kill in mechanical appliances were frequently appealed. to. Fi11ally. it affords ine pleas111·c to state that my t·riend, l\Ir. FJ. S. '\Yheeler, who hal'\ Jiacl exteusin~ ··:qwrience with basf' apparatus. happeHed to vi.sit \\~asl1ingtou abont the time the plauR for thi:-1 apparatus were complde·l. and gave Hie tht· h<·ne1it of his advice and criticism. (:2) Gencrnlfcatures of apparatus.-The jeed-bar apparatus belong~ to that type in whielt a single rigid bar is used as the element of length, aloug with n1icron1et(·r 1nicroscopes to niark its sueet·8sive positio11s. A 11 idea of the nature of the apparatus i.nay be gained frmn illustranons :) I and 32. The first of these shows the apparatus as u~ed on tLe loom <·omparator of Holton base, described at length in sc_'ctiou ~.Chapter Ill. The other plate shows the apparatus as usPd 011 tbP> staudar'l ldloTnl'tre of tbe same base. It will be :-;een that the measuri11g bar is carried in a trougl1, where it can be kept surrounded by n1elti11tr h·t·. This trough is 1nounted on two can;, which move on tracks, stationary or portable, as t:be case inay be. The inicroscopef'., as slwwn iu the illustrations, are mounted ou ·wooden posts, ·whieh art·. ra.ug·ed out aud l':>et tirrnly in the ground beforehand. This Rort, of support for the micro;-;eopes, though not ossential to the apparatm'{, is convenient and ecouonlical wlrnn a serie~ of nl.easurei-1 of the :-:arne liue is to be 1nade. 'l'l1e mieroscopes are easily clamped to and deta«h{'>(l from the posts, and are moved forward as the ineasure of a line progreR$e:':'. The trough carryiog- the bar and ice load i8 like.,vise easily rolled forward on the ears

the tracks. T~lle apparatus is 5m long, so that the miero~(·ope posts are set ;°)"' apart. J'he support8 for the ear tracks are ahm set 5rn a.part, but an· phwed half way between the 1nicroscope poRts, so as to avoid transntitting di.;;;turbance to the latter through the ground. , As slwwn in illustration No. 31, the apparatm;; on the loom e01npanttor

To secure alignment of the bar. elnven Gerrnau silver p1ng:r::. of ;)mn· diameter are inserted at interval:-: of 4!)5 m alollg the bar~ so that they prqject about 1""" al>ove its top ~1Tface. The upper snrDtees of tht:>"f' plugs are all the same distatH't'. within a fow hundre<lth8 of a milli· metre, from the neutral surface of the bar. 011 the top of each Jllug i~ rnled a fine line in the direction of the bar. as sLo\VJI at Pin thci1Jw;;tration.

Thi~ trough is called the Y-trough by reason of the rest·mblauce of its ('l'oSH seetion to tile Jetter Y. The drawin,l.!· shows a ('.ross section of this tl'(mgb. It is made of two steel plntes .:1·14'" Jo11g. ~;)·ti"'" wide~ aud :{"'m thick. They are bent to the augle 13 C D of tlrn tignrE:·~ and are rivi-'ted tllgether as shown at E, tbm;; making tit(· a11gh· of the trough B C F= ~io::--. The bar, sho"vn in cross sedio11 at A, ii" snpported at every lialf metre of its length by saddles, otw of wlticll 1s sl1own ill tlte Hg:un·. Tbe:-;e saddles are rigidly attacbe<l to t1w :-;ides of the trongli l,y screws at S. S. Each saddle carrfos one vertical arnl two lateral adju~ting ~r'l't'Ws as shown at V, I .. , L'. 'rhese screws :-;(·rve to fix tl1e alignment of the bar. The Ja.teral adjusting- S<'.rew:-i of the saddles at the ends of tl11\ har are of the same lleight, which is equal to that of thf· lower .screw L' of tl1e diagrmn. The lateral ad,iusting- t-l.CrewSc of tb\' interm"·(lia.te ~;1IJ<lle:-; on either side of the bar are alter11ately high and low. The 1 d~j1·£'t,of thi.s disposition is two-fold, to wit: 1.st, to JH'C\·eutpinehiugthe hHr. wl1ich 1night 1nore readily occur if the lateral screws wt·re all oppo,1.;itc· to oue another; ~d, to afford means of rotating: the l>ar slightly ahont it~ longitudinal axis, so tllat for a fixed and nearly vertical positi1111 of the. trough the gra.duated surfaces of the bar nHfY be made horizontal.

It weigh:-;(":):? kilognuumes, exclusive of the bar and ice load. rrhe whole trough is covered by a closely-fitting jaeket of heavy white cotton felt, which protects the trough and ieP ]oad alike from direct radiation. :For measuring gra<le angles a sector reading by two oppm;ite ve1·. 11h·rs to 10" iR attached to one side of the trough near its middle poi11t. Thus arranged this sector has great stability. (::>) rz'hc ice load nnd ice cru.yher.-\Vheu the apparatus is in use tl1t> Y-tl'(mgh il5 completely tilled with pulverized ice, the upper surf<lce of wl1ich is rounded to about the height shown by tlJC curye B Il I~ in tlw diagram. The amount of ice required for this pnrpose is a.bout -!O kilogrammes, or 8 kilog-rammes per metre of the bar's length. The ice~ h,\ reason of its weight aud the sloping sides of the trough, is kept in clo;-;t· contact with the bar. This is especially the case when tlie apparatn,... is in use, for it is then trundled along on its cars with sufficient. jarrilq.:; to overcome any tendency of the ice to pack. Bor covering the end..; of the bar a sn1all quantity of ice is cut with a jack pla11e. Ice tlrn:-o cut, like wet snow, packs well and permits 111aking a s1nall conical hoh· through it to the graduation plugs. A. very essential auxiliary to the use of the apparatus is an it·P ci·nsher to pulverize the ice. '.l~he machine used is a 1nodification 1>1· the Creasey ice breaker n1a.nufitctured at Philadelphia, Pa. It iH ;1 small light lmnd machine which, as modified, does its work very sati.'-' faetorily. 'Vith it40 kilogra.mmesofice1naybe pulverized in tenminnt··~ or less. The particles of crushed ice vary in size frou1 the s1nalle-.;1 vi~ib1e up to the bulk of a cubic centimetre; and this gradation rn 1';i7;e appears to he advanta.geous as compared 'vith uniformly fint·l' intrticfos like thrn;;e of snow, ~;ince there is leRR liahilit.Y of regelation arnl packing. (fi) The ca.r~ and po-rta.ble track.-'J'he Y-trough i~ inounted on two cars, the saddles or bolsters of which are attached to the trough 40' '" from either end. J:<-:ach saddle is attached rigidly to the trough ahm··· and to a jackscrew below. The jackscrew is attaehed to a slide rest which is connected rigidly with the base of the car. '1'be slide rest~ are proyided with screws to give slow motions in the direction of the trough's length and transverse to its length. The jackserew cylinders have right and left handed threads at theii· respective ends and are turned by a short capstan bar. They gin' thus the rapid vertical motion to the trough essential in bringing t !if' bar quickly to focus under the microscopes whieh define its positio11. The cars have each three wheels and run on a portable track who~t'. wid tlt is :)0"111 · Three sections of this tra.ck, each 5m long, are provided; and ea.dt section is carried forward as the cars are rolled along duriuµ; the n1easurement of a. line.

The geuenll iilan which ha.s been iollowed in the execution of this operation iH that of direct comparison of the bar a1Hl Prototype 1\Ietre, each being packed in meltiHg ice. _..t\._ccording to this 11lan the use of tberm01neters is di~peused with entirely. It suffices :-;imply to n1easure a distance of five times the length of the metre when packed in melting ice, and then transfer this distance to the 5m bar packed in melting ice. The means available 'tor such work at the time the apparatus was cn11structed were the oftiee co1nparator and comparing 1·oom. The latter is an undergronud room situated between the front of the Survey 1milding and the adjacent street. The comparator consists of au iron I-heam about 6·5m long, Rnpported at its ends ou brick piers. Between i 1ie:·m piers 1nicron1eter 1nicroseopes can he attached to the beaui at any cl(·sired interval up t-0 6 metres. For :ompporting the bars nnder compa.rison, a car moving at right angles to the J:-beam is provided. The ear rails rest on piers well removed from those :-.upporting the beam. The comparing room. is lighted by electric lights which can be placed in m1y convenient position for il1uminating or reading the. microscopes. For the special com.parisons in question six micrometer microscopes were attached t,o the J:-beam at intervals of 1 metre. The means of attacltrnent were cast-iron brackets whieh could be rigidly clmnped to the heam, while tl1e microscopes themselves were fastened t.o the shelves nf tl1e, brackets. The brackets ar(~ adjustable on the beam; so that the t"ocal planes of the 1nicroscopes can he brought into the sarne horizontal 1·lmH·, very nearly, and the axes of the microscopes. ma-<1e vertical witl1in narrow limits. The microscopes in turn are provi1led with lat<·ra1 adjustments on tl1e shelves of the brackets. Hence tlu· optical :np,, of the microscopes can be brought into one Yertical plane, vei·y 111 '·i l'ly, and the distances between consecutive axes can be nut<le <'los.eJy <·qnal to 1 n1etre. The microscopes used in all deter1ninations of the length of tl1e ieed h:u· X o. 17 are Nos. n and 6 of the Survey and Nm;;;. 1, 2, B, and 4 of the J~epsold base apparatus loaned to the Survey by the Corps of Engineers, '' · S.

mierol:'>cope:-; were placed iu the intermediate positiong. The1::.;e latter microscopes have each about 2cm lateral n1oiion by nwans of a fine screw, so that their axes could be easily pn t. i 11 line with the axes of the end microscope at any time. This adjustment was accomplished by bringing a fine thread well stretched to focus under the?terminal microscopes and then 1noving the intermediate microscope~till their axes were coincident with the thread. The error of this adjustme11t. has never exceeded 0·2mm. The field illumination of the microscopPs was secured by glass prisms· attached in front of the microscope o bjec:.ti ves. Light was thrown into the prism and tlience to the objed observed by means of lenses in fii.ont of the illuminating lamps. In making comparisons the 5m bar B 17 was mounted in its Y-troug:li. iced, anc.l aligned in the manner already described. The trough was suppol'ted on its lifting jacks, which rested on the co1nparator ear. Tlw 1netre used was Protot,ype No. 21. It was mounted in a 'vooden box whose interior depth, breadth, and length are 11·0cm,12·5cm, and 115·0c respectively. It was supported by light brass suspension hooks attach(·1l to wooden crosspieces which rested on the sides of the box. The hook" were placed at distances of 2ocm from the ends of the metre. In pat: king the metre for comparisons it was completely surrounded to a depth of 5cm to 8" 01 by a mixture of ice pulverized in the ice crusher a11 d l 1y the snow-like particles cut with a jack plane. These finer particll'k could be crowded into the grooves of the bar (which lias an X cro~:-; section) so that the ice would be in actual contact with the surfact' of the bar throughout its length. After thus covering the inetre coll! pletely small holes were made thi·ongh the sno'! packing at the ern l:--; of the box down to the graduated surfaces, which were the only pa1·t:--; of the metre exposed to the external air. To remove condensed rnoi:-.tnre, which is sometimes troublesome, from these polished surfaees. a <lry camel's hair brush was found very effective. The upper snrfat·t., of the ice pack and the sides of the box were protected by a heavy felt "Wrapping, through which 'small holes were cut over the graduation marks. The box was provided with 3-foot screws which stood on plat(·$ of glass resting on the platform of the comparator car. These fool screws served to bring the ends of th~ metre to focus under the mkrnscopes, the requisite lateral and longitudinal adjustments being secure1l by sliding the box on itfi foot screws on the smooth glass. To pack the 5m bar 40 to 45 kilogrammes of ice were used, and 10 t<> 12 kilogrammes to pack the metre. The ice was renewed at intervals of twenty to forty minutes, but the melting was generally very slight during such intervals. Assuming constancy of temperature of the bars under compariso11. the precision of the method just outlined evidently depends on tlw stability of the microscopes used. The first series of comparisons, made in July, 1891, indicated marked instability of the microscopes; and sev· eral series made du.ring Ji""'ebruary to May, 18921 ~endered lt certain

Its use for the f'arlier determinations of the length of the iced oar was snggestecl by consideratiorn;; of economy, and it \Vas hoped that with careful manipulation it would auswer the purpose. The mo::;t important result, how1·,-er, of this earlier work was a demonstration of the necessity of a differellt sort of comparator. 'rI1e defoets of the office comparator fin· our purpose may be ascribed 1·liiefly to the mode of mounting the microscopes. Beiug attached as explained above by means of brackets clamped to the I-beam, their tiwal planes fall at a distance of about 0·5m below the beam. Any c·liange of curvature or temperature of that beam will therefore cause n·lative displacements of the microscopes. Hestiug as the beam docs with the friction due to its weight on the pier::;, it. is in general iu a ~late of longitudinal stress, which is frequently relieved by vibrations i'o1nmunicated to the piers by vehicles passing in the adjacent street. TliP temperature of the comparing room changes very slowly from day to day when not occupied long by the observer, or when lighted. for 1'hort intervals. But the comparisons in question required occupyingtl.H· room for some hours per day, and the heat from the observers and ekctric lights caused notable changes in the temperature of the beam, <l It hough it was wrapped with cotton batting and encased by a wooden box. These two sources of disturbance caused large irregular displace~ inents of the microscopes and hence large ranges in the resulting values for the length of B 17 · (2.) Programme of obser-vations.-The observations were made in such a n1anner as to eliminate the effects of regular displacements of the mi(TOscopes. Thus, calling the 5m bar Br;, the prototype metre Xo. :.!l ~lI;1, and D the distance between the termiuaJ microscopes of the comPilrator, the following scheme was adopted iu the earliest determiuatio1ti'> of Ju1y, 1891: (1) A measure of D with .1lf21· (a) (2) A measure of D with Bi,. (3) A measure of D with 1JI2 1 in reverse direction. In the 1-1ubsequent determinations of February and .1\Iarch, 1892, the ah 11 ve scl1eme was supplemented by additional measures '\Yi th B 17 · Thus tlte programme was: (1) A measure of I> with B17. (2) .A measure of D with _Jf21. (3) A measure of D with B17· (1J) (4) A measure of D with B17· (5) A measure of D with _]Jf2 1 in reverse direction. (6) A measure of .JJ with Bu.

In some instances, also, in these later determinations but one measure of D was ma<le in the place of (3) and (4). Iu all determinations of length the observations of the two ends of B 17 an<l M 21 were made simultaucon~ly by two different observers. The ob:-:.ervers also in every case exchanged positions imme<liatel,\and read on the opposite ends of the bars, in order to eliniinate personal equation, in so frtr as elin1ination can be accomplished by such iuterchange. In measuring the distance between the tern1inal microscop(~S of the comparator with .Mz1 care was taken to make the dependence 011 the low-power iutern1ediate inicroscopes small by coufiuing the n1casures with them to a few microns in each case. The small inequalities in heights of the focal planes of the microscopes were measured by observing the inclination of a suitably delicate level tube attached to _]Jf 21 when the latter ·was brought to ffJCUS under the miuroseopel'.'. Repeated observations by thi8 method gaYe accurate corrections for such inequalities. (3.) Cmnputation of length of Bl'7--'l~he method of deriving the lengtl1 of B 17 from the observations will depend in general on the hypothe~is \W adopt with respect to the motions of the microscope.s. rrhe number of hypotheses available is restricted, also, by the numuer of observatious. Ignoring for the rnomeut the displaceme11t of the intermediate n1icroHcopes, and considering the secoud programrne of the preceding secti011~ we m.ay suppose, for example, first, that the distance IJ between the zeros of the terminal microscopes remains invariable from the time of (1) to the time of (6); second, tbat J) varies· uniformly with tbe tirnn from (1) to (6); third, that D varies uniformly at a rate z 1, say, from (I J to (3), and uniformly at a rate z 2 from \4) to (6); fourth,. that D varit·~ at a rate z + 2wt from (1) to (6), z aHd w beiug constants and t the time beginning with (1). All these hypotheses ·were tried in computing the results of the observations of :E'ebruary and J\1arch, 1892, made according to the more elaborate progran1me given above. The residnals brought out by these processes were, iwwever, far great-er than ·Collhl be attributed to errors of the observational class, and they show 1·il clearly that the suppo:;.;itions were rarely in accord with the facts. rrltt· rea8on for this lack of accord is that the processes do not take adequate account of the irregular motions of the microscopes, and especial I;.- o1 the intermediate microscopes. It does not seem worth wl1ile, therefore, to set down all the forrnn!:is which result from the above suppositions and wbich were tried :1.8 stated. It may suffice to give those dependent on the fourth suppo~ tion. We observe, first, that the measures (1) and (6) and (2) aml (.l) were made at equal intervals, respectively, from the observations (;1) and (4). The latter two were made so near together that they nws be considered simultaneous. Secondly, the intervals (1) to (3) and (4) ttJ (6) were about twice the intervals (2) to (3) and (4) to (5).

The value of E does not exeeed 0·5,.._, so that the probable e1Tor of a singlf' value ·of x due to errors of observation is less than ± 0·8". Since the total probable error of a Hing]e value of x in Table II is, as given above, ± 3·{;,.._, the reason for directing attention to other sources of f'rror than those of observation is evident. This view of the inquiry was reached long before the series of determinations conclensed in Table II was coillpleted. Durin~; the progres.s of this work, in fact, many experiments were made with the hope of locating the larg-er sources of error and de-vising means for their elimination or c"Orrection. Thus, (a), delicate levels were attached to tlw brackets of the terminal microscopes of the comparator. They irnlicated that the microscopes were subject to both sudden and progressive displacemeuti:;;, which were frequently large in amount. (b). Tht· quest:ion whether these displacements could be due to the varying pol'itious of the observers and the micrm~cope car was exarnined, with tbe result that no effects due to the weight of either were produced. (c). The hypothesis was entertained that B 17 might be subject to longitudinal stress, and hence to changes of length, from friction on the sup-

The important question then arose whether the results in Tables I arnl II were affected by detrimental constant errors.

(7) Description of m.ethod.-The time required to measure the distance between the terminal microscopes of the comparator with the metre, according to the direct method, was 1:3 to 20 1ninutes. It appeared pr()bable, therefore, that the errors due to motions of tl1e rnieroscopeH could be much reduced if not eliminated by diminishing t.bl:~ interval during which dependence must bang on their stability. To accomplish this end, a steel bar of the same dimensions as B 17 was prepared hy the Instrument Division of the Survey and subdivided into metre spaees. H was cut down to its mid depth at interval8 of one metre and platinu1n .iridium plugs were inserted to receive tlie fiducial lines. The plugs were carefully polished and the llnes were successfully ruled by l\'Ir. I~. G. Fischer. This bar is designated B 18 · It js marke'l by a letter .A at one end and by a letter B at the other. The method followed in determining the lengt11 of R 17 by aid of B,q consisted essentially in comparing each of the sub-spaces of Brn with the metre M 21 , deriving thus the total length of Brn. an<l then comparing B17 with B 18· Brn was mounted in the steel Y-trongh where it could be aecurately aligned and 'vhere its flexure could be me.'tsnre<l. Each graduation plug having in addition to a single transverse line two longitudinal lines separated by an interval of 0·2mm, B 18 could be aligned in the ~ertical plane by means of the five microscopes and the lateral adjnstmg Rcrews of the trough. For alignment in the horizontal plane, the

It ·was thus possible to measure the inequalities in height o1 the plug surfaces to the neare!'l.t tenth of a millimetre when the bar wa.-; surrounded by ice. The vertical adjusting screws directly below tlw plugs were first brought to the proper positions. .After these wert' secured, the intermediate vertical screws were brought up to contac-t with the bar without disturbing its shape as Rhown by the stridiuglevel; aU these adjustments bning· made after the trough had assumed its shape due to a f'ull load of iee. l t is to be remarked, also, that Ri~ remajned in the Y-trough in the same position throughout the comparisons. I ts alignment as sl1ow·n by the microscopes did not change at its graduation 1narks by so much as o-2mm. For cornparif~ons with B 18 , B 17 was 1nounted in a wooden box provid<'d with adjusting screws in aJI respects similar to those of the Y-trough. The following progran1me was adopted in tlljs deterrnination of tlH· length of B11: (l) Six measures of the sub-spaces and hence length of Brn in term~ of .Jlf21· (2) Nine measures of B 17 in terms of Rm. (3) Six measures of Brn as in (l). (4) Nine measures of B 17 as in (2). (!J) Six measures of Brn as in (1).

Si1nflarly, for the comparison of Rr: and .B18 the pJa.n foJiowed was: (.1) Microscope readings on B 17· (2) Microscope readings on B 18 · (3) Microscope readings on B 1;. IJ 11 and B 18 being interchanged alternately. The observations at tbe two ends of the bars or sub-spaces were made simultaneously by two observers who always excl1anged places and repeated the readings. The observers were John S.

(10) Sources of error.-Tbe principal sources of error to which the in Tables III and IV are subject are: (a) those of observation, (b) those due to instability of the microscopes, and (c) those due to flexnre of Brn. The results involve the aggregate effect of these three F:.onrce:-;, but 1t is practicable to estimate their separat effects. This we now proceed to do. 'l'he quantit1es q in equations (1) and (2) of section 8 are of the form q=-2-(Ru+R'n -Re - R 1 .. ) , where En, R'n, and R., R'. denote the microscope readings at the north a1Hl south ends respectively of 1lf:n or of a sub-space of B 18 , as t11e case may be. Hence if c is the probable error of a single microscope reading-, the probable error of q due to this source alone is also c; and it follows from the first of equations (2), section 8, that the probable error
of a single determination of .ri is± c

J~.

The value of£,

h~v

direct observation, is less than 0·51'-.

Hence the probable error of a

i-;i11gle value of xi due to errors of observation alone is less than 0·5"".

The assumption adopted in computing the values of the sub-spaces on RJ:j i:-; that the interval between the zeros of the pair of micro8cope~ 11st><l in 'letermining any space changed uniformly witl1 the time reqnired to make the observations. If this is not a true as.sumption, m if the microscopes were subject to large irregular displacements, we ~hould expect to find the probable errors of the quantities q and .r.i derived fro1n the residuals '1J of equations (1), section 8~ larger than thoi"e given under (a) above. Such is, in fact, the case. It is essential to observe here that errors due to flexure of B 18 ~ or eh:n1g-cs in length of the sub-spaces, if they were at all -formidable, did not appear in the residuals v of the equations used. Such ehanges can only occur slowly, from day t-0 da.y, or during longer periods~ since tbe.v a1·tJ primarily due to the change in sha.pe of the Y-trougb, which is affected only by marked changes of the surrounding air temperature. The time required to make a set of observations in a comparison of .1ll2 1 with a sub-space was only 6 to 8 minutes. It appears practically cer~ain, therefore, that the residua.Is brought out in the computation 111voh-e only the two sources (a) and (b). In the 90 determinations of the 5 sub-spaces there were 450 rei·ddnal8 antl 270 unknowns, as shown by the formulas (1) and (2) used in the computation. The sum of the squares of these residua1s is 351·4, the llllit heing a micron. Hence if e 1 denote the probable error of a singlf' obi'erved value of q,

Comparing these errors with those due to observation aloue, it appem·i' that the probable error of a valne of q due to.instability of micro.scope8 is

and t11at the corresponding value for x 1 is only slightly less. Au examination of the individual residuals of the different sets of ob8ervations indicates that the asstunption of a constai1t rate of change of a microscope interval was frequently not realized. In the entirt' number of residuals there were t.wenty whose valn~s rose to or exceedNl 2,.., while six exceeded 3,..., the maxiruum being 3·7,,.. These large residuals, it is be1ieved, are due to sudden displacements of the microscopes. Xo other hypothesis appears competent to e:q)la.in them, unless it lw that of sudden changes in temperature of the bars under compariso11. The above probable error of ~x 1 , or the probable error of one detern1ination of the length of Bui is ± 2·7µ.. The corresponding value for a single determination of B 17 by the direct process, as given in sectiou ti. is ± 3·6 µ.. Hence it would appear that the process of getting the entire length of B 18 was subject to considerably less error than the direet determination of B 17 · The group means in the Jast column of Table III indicate a progrf·Sl' ive change in the length of Brn during the series of comparisons, whidi extended from April 25 to May 10, 1892. The cause of this cbanA'<'. if real, is important, and much study was given to it. It 1nay be observed, before considering any other cause, that the two sources of error already examined are not altogether incompetent to account for the range which these group means show. That raugc i'> about 8µ.. The probable error of one group mean is, if we adopt t1H' probable error of ::Ea;. given above as a basis, ~ 1:1

range of 8µ. would be accounted for by errors of opposite sign:". 11° b"I'eater than four times this probable error, but the probability of snt'h
an explanation is 'too small to be e1atisfactory. Hence we Jlroceefl to examine the question of the effect of flexure of B 18 on its obserY<'d length. Since the surfaces of the intermediate graduation plugs of Brn are not in the. neutral surface of the bar, any change in its curvature will t~nd to displace the :fiducial lines on those intermediate plugs. 'fhis source of difficulty was anticipated, and the measures of the flexure with the long striding level, as already explained~ were made for the purpose of supplying any needed correction. It is obvious that no corn;;iderable variation in the whole measured l~ugtb. of B 18 could occur except through large changes in its curvature-such, for example. as a change from marked concavity upwards to marked convesi~Y upwards. No such change occurred, however, the bar remaining, as will

prPsently appear, coneave upwards throughout the work. Again, since there could be no displacement of the terminal lines of B 18 from thb cause, the snm of the sub-spaces, as measured at any time, should be :-;ensibly free from the effects of displacements of the intermediate lines, unless the bar was subject to marked changes of curvature during the 30 or 40 minutes required to compare the sub-spaces with Jl:n· Tlwre is no indication that B 1a uuderweut any changes of curvature other than those due to the slowly tluctuatiug temperatures of the air in the conipariug room, which were i:o:.ufficient, it would appear, to affect tl1e web of the Y-trough and hence B 18 by small amounts. 1\Ioreover. the observed variations inleugth of the sub-spaces, if due to displacement~ of the intermediate graduation lines arising from slow chauges in curvature of B 18 , ought to appear as a linear function of the ob:-o;erved 1·.ha11ges of curvature. Such, in brief, were the coni-:iderations which led to the use of B 18 for thP imrpose in question, notwithstanding the obvious objection to- it8 form, if invariability in length of the sub-spaces is required. Let us uow examine the facts brought out by the ob!'lervations.

:Frmn these it would not seem safe to infer that the terminal sub-spaees were suuject to less error iu their determination than the other spaee:-;, although the mean values of those terminal sub-spa.ccs are by far the most accordant.

warrant a negative answer. There appeared to be no way out of this dilemma except to build a comparator designed especially for the purpose of getting t11e length of Br:· Accordiugly plans for a new comparator were drawn up and approved by the Superintendent of the Survey, and the work of construction was completed during June and early July, 1892. It was designed with a view to direct determination:-; by 1neasuring a distance of 5m with a Prototype in ice and then tram·ferring this distance to B 17 in the manner already deserihed. This comparator was constructed in a vacant lot adjacent to the Survey Office. B-tiefty described, it consists of six brick piers resti11g ou a continuous foundation of 6 cubic 1netres of well-ra.nuned concrete. The foundation is 1 m by 1 m in cross t-5ection and rises to the level of the ground surface. The foundation aud piers ar(~ both set in Portland cement and their combined weight is ahout 12 tons (11 000 kilof.Tarnmes). The exposed partR of the foundation and the ground near about are covei·ed to a depth of a decimetre with sawdust. The terndnal piers were arranged to receiye the Survey microscopes 5 and n, already described in i:-;ection 1. Connection between these microscope~ and the piers was secured by means of heavy cast-iron plates, held fa:-;t by long bolts built into the piers, insuring thus ample rigidity. The intermediate piers had built into then1 heavy stone posts, on which the post caps of the Hepsold microscopes could be mounted as when ns('d in fieldwork. These connections were also very rigid; and the gri:>at weight of the piers and foundation, which were virtually one nws;.:.;. gave a very satisfactory degree of stability. The piers were ranµ:ed in an east and west line, nearly. ~ro protect the1n from the sun all(l stor1ns a shed 8·6m long by 3"' wide was built over them. The IH)l'tl1 side of the shed was left open until after the c01npa.risons of July a11d August, 1892, were completed, a temporary cover of canvass bein;r applied at night-time, or when the co1nparator was not in use. It ,ya:-:; thus possible to use daylight for illuminating the microscope&, and a free circulation of air was permitted within the shed. To proteet the · microscopes from currents of air and from the iee packs of tbe bar,.:;, their tubes and their metallic connections with tlie piers were heavily wrapped with cotton batting. The axes of the microscopes were made vertical by means of ltffel,..; attached to their tubes. Their axes were put into one vertical plane and their focal planes made nearly coincident ]Jy bringing them all to focus and bisection ou a fine thread stretched under them. The remaining small differences in elevation of the focal planes were 1neasured from tin1e to time by observing the readings of a level (haviug 12·f;" per division) attached to Prototype No. 21 when it was brought to fo('ns under the microscopes. The metre and 5m bars were moved under tbe 1nieroscopes on portable tracks supported on posts isolated fl"om the piers~ The track for the metre was a stiff truss of cypress wood. One rail of this truss bad a

car carrying the inetre box was tnade to slide on these rails. ny 1neans of suitable lateral and lougitu(liual stops this truss could be held in :stwh a position that only small lateral motiou14 of the metre box on its eat· ·were required. Tliese smaIJ lateral rnotious and s1nall longitudinal ni.,tions as well, of the box on the car, ·were accomplished by 1.nea11s of a syste1n of slow-n1otion scrcnvs. 'l'he 111etre box was al~o provided with three leveling screws. These provisions made :it 1iossihle to briug the metre to focus, and to position withiu a few n.iicrorrn, with ease and rapidity. The 5m bar was 1nonnted iu its Y-trough a1Hl moved on the same cars mid track used with it in the fieldwork. 1 t was handled, in fact, in tlie determinations abont to be given, in precisely the saiue manuer as in measuring a line in the field. Both bars were moved under the microscopes along the south side of the piers. When the metre was not under observation it was 1·t·ruoved, together with it:-; car and track, to suitable brad,;:ets on the :-;outh side of the co1nparator shed. \\'hen B 17 was not under observation it was run out of the east ·loor of the shed on the })ortable track and left urnler au awning alongside the supply of ice and the iceeru:-;her. 'l'he plat.forms on 'vbid1 the ob.-;crvers stood \Vere isolated from the piers and from the track supports, so that the moveme11ts of the ohserve1·~ produced no disturbance of tlw piers or of the bars. TJw, piers were about 25m frotn tl1e uen.rest l'ltreet. Only heavily loaded vehicles, ·which pas:-;ed quite infreqneutl.v on this street, produced auy pereeptible vihratiou in the piers. On no occasion was it considered essent.ial to :->top observing on account of such 1ninute vibrations. The piers aud the adjacent parts of the shed 011 the north F;ide were \\'t1itewashed, and this aided in producing an abundauee of white light for- illuminating the'- microi-;copes. In this regard the conditions for t";1:-:e and <'omfort in observing were n1uch superiot· to those afthrded by tlie electric lights of the ofnce compuring room. (l.J-) ]Jfethods t~f' ob.<?en_;a.tion.-The study of the earlier direct det.erminations of July, 1891, and I·'ebruary and 1\[arch, 1892, indicated the d(·,.irability of i~tereasiug the number of measures witl1 the prototype llJ(\tre relatively to those with B 17 in any set of observations.

Tlie measures with the inetre started alternately from the west and east ends of the comparator. The n1icrometric readings on ejtber bar were ma.de simultaneously by the two observers, who exchanged position:-; in every case to eliminate personal equation. S1nall distances, amounting to a few microns only, were measured with the ilit'ermediate Repsohl microsco1)es, whose nutgni(yiug powers are but twenty-seven diameters, while the terminal 1nicroscopes 5 and 6 have a power of
fifty d:iamete1's.

The measures with B 17 were made Jn the manner described at length in section 10 of Cllapt.er I. That is, the i·ear (west) end of the bar was first brought to bisection hy means of the car lever, while the oisection at the front end was made by turning the micrometer screw at that (east) end. The observers then exchanged positions, and the same operation was repeated in tho reverse order, the bar being; brought to bisection by the ca,r lever at the east end and the micrometer threads moved to bisection a.t the west end. Two sets of such observations 'Yere generally made. Both bars were fully iced from half an hour to au hour before obsen~ ing on them. A slightly greater quantity of ice was used on both barR than in the previous determinations made during the winter in the comparing room, where the air te1nperature averaged about 50 C. Thl' average air temperature during July and August, 1892, when the present deterrninat.ions were n1ade, wa.s about 350 C. However, when protected by the felt covers of tile n1etre box and Y-trough, the ice ditl not appear to m.elt 1nnch faster than it did under the far lower winter temperature. Throughout this series of comparisons the ice about Bn was shaken up and replenished just before bringing it under the microseopes tor observations, and tho prototype was similarly treated at intervals of twenty to thirty minutes. lfrom very careful personal attention to the J)acking of these bars, I am confident that they were subject to no sensible variations in length due to variations in temperature. The observations were made by Messrs. John S. Siebert and R. S. Woodward, and the record was kept by Mr. Orville G. Brown. 'Thr computations were made and checked in all parts by the same parties as the work of observation progressed. (15) Metlwd of computation.-The considerations on whiCh the method followed in deriving the length of B 17 depends are similar· to those s(·t forth in section 3 above. But since t,be data were in some respeAs difterent, it seems proper to state the present cas.~ briefly by itself. If the positions of the microscopes of the comparator remained in Ya· riable, or if the measured quantities were affected by errors of observation only, the distance D between the zeros of the tex·minal microscope 8 would be given by each of the following equations, corresponding to the several measures of the programme in section 14.

In these, Q1 Q 2 ·· · are the 1nicrometric qnantitie8 resulting from the several measures, and i·1 r2 . ·· are the eorreRponding corrections. But the hypothesis of constancy of position of the microscopes, or of invariability of D, is inadequate. It appears, howeyer, from t.l1e obseryations, that the assumption of a constant rate of variation of Dis quite satisfactory, aud this is the one adopted. The time intervals between the several measures (1) (2) ... (ti) are nearly equal, being about 7·5 n1inutes each on the aYerage. Hence, if we call z the rate of change of J) and put as hitherto

Since the quantities Qi, Q:i, Q5 depend on the half alg-ebraic sum of twenty independent u1icroscope readings, ·while Qz and Q 1 depend on the half sum of four to eight such readiugs, the probable errors of the former would stand to those of the latter as .,/ 5 to 1, or as ,/5 to 1/2, as the case may be, provided the errors involYed are of the a<·cidental ~ort.

The results indicated that the latter :-;uppositiou is the 1uore appropriate one, and it was therefore adopted for all the work. _,c\_ 1nere inspection of the data, in fact, shows that the "\veights of Q 1, Qa, Q5 , should be imich less !'han the weights of (h and Q4.

Table VII following gives tlle results of tlie computation, according to equations (1) and (3) of section 15, based on the data of Table VI. The first column gives the date of observation. The seco1ui column ~ives the quantity x = 5.il:f21 - B 17, resulting from a set of observations; tlie third gives y = D-5,U~ 1 ; the D here being the most probable value of the interv~l between the terminal microscopes at the middle time of the observations in any set; the fourth gives z, the rate of change of D, or the most probable change in Din 7·5 minutes, a.bout. The next three eolmnns give the residuals ·n1 , v 3 , t'5 , or most probable corrections to (h, Q3, Qs, respectively; while the two following eolumns give the residuals v2, v 4 , for Q2 , Q4 , respectively. The la.st column gives the sum of ~he weighted squares of the residuals, this sum. being designated by iPl'i']. The value adopted fnr p is 1/5. It may be remarked t.bat the ~urns Vs._+ v 3 + v 5 , and v 2 + i1 4 should each be equal to zero within a tenth of a unit. The groups of values for the several dates are spaced off by extra leads as in Table -vI. The times of day when the several sets of observations were made are given in Table 'TI.

these depends ou the inequalities in heights of the focal i)lanes of the microscopes. The 1nicroscopes were adj nsted to near equality in heights of their focal planes by the method explaiHcd in section 13, but owing to some unexplained cause, u1icroscope 6, which was attached to the east pier of the comparator, was given a position about 2mm too higb. This, maladju:-:;tment was discovered on July 19, but since it eoul<l be measured accurately it was not corrected until . A~up:nst 3. 1\Ieasurements of the inequalities in l1ejghts of the fcwal plaiies were made on July 19, 20, 26, and August a, by means of a level attacLecl to the prototype inetre, as already explained. 'l'Le micro:-:;cope:-:; were arranged in the order 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, H; 5 being 011 the west pier, 6 on the east pier, and the otl1ers on the intermediate piers. The follow1ng are the mean values of the differences in height of the focal planes resulting from the uieasnre~, seven in all, for the detenniHatious extending from July 18 to July 28.

The second correction depends on tl1e curvature of Br; in a vertica1 plane. 'l:'his curvature is measured by means of the long 1:-\triding· level as explained in Chapter I, section ti. The correction is so small that it has been neglected in all preyious ·work, though its an1onnt was less in that work than in the work now considered. '"-rhe theory of the c01nputation of this correction from the level reading:-; is given in Supplement A. It may suffice here to give the values of the computed corrections. They are as followR:
µ.

·09, ·35, Aug. 4, ·05, 6, ·07' ·09, s, ·31, H. ·13. 10~ These are so small that they inight be ignored witl1out materia1 error, but since it is believed that they represent determinable quantities, we shall here apply them. It may be remarlfed that their variability is undoubtedly due to the effect of the external air temperature on the web of the Y-trough so long as the. vertical adjusting screws under the bar are left undisturbed. The observations show, in fae1, that if the bar is made straight for any given external temperature, i1 becomes convex upwards for an incrt·ase of tha,t te1nperature. ThP adjusting screws were left undisturbed during the series of determinntions extending from July 18 to July 28, and it will be seen by referenee to Table VIII following that the maximu1u correction of July 27 corresponds to the maximum air temperature of the series. A like remark applies to the series-extending frmn August 4 to 9, the nia-ximum correction corresponding t.o the maximum air temperature of August 9. (See Table IX). Considering the small number of determinations of corrections in the series of July, we n1ay adopt a single mean value for application to .i'~ viz, 0·2,.... For the series extending from August 4 to 9 we shall adopt 0·1"" for all dates except August 9, and the observed value 0·3"' for tl1e latter date. The value adopted for August 10 is also the observetl value, the bar having been turned end for end and re-adjusted on that

The individual values of x in Table VIII or IX are, so far as known, of equal weight. The values of x in the two tables differ systematica11y, however, for reasons given at length in section 20 below. Hence we shall, for the sake of distinction, call the n1ean of the adopted values of x in 'rable VIII, xw, and the mean of those in Table IX, xe, the suffixes defining the orientation ot· B 1 7. These means are

these equations give .B1"' = 5m - 14·4"' ± 0·4µ for A-end west, B17 = 5 -18·8 ± 0·4 for A-end east. The probable errors assigned to these mean va,lues are derived from the residuals in the last columns of the tables. Thus, the su1n of the squares of the residuals in Table VIII is 135·5, and the corresponding sum from TablP. IX is 118·1. The number of residuals is forty and the number of unknowns two. Hence tbe probable error of an individual value of :x: in either table is ± 1·7"'; and sinee the weights of a;., and Xe are each 20, tlteir probable e1Tors are ea.ch equal to ± 0·4:"'.

(19) Sou/rces of accidental error.-The principal accidental errors affecting the quantities x, y, z of Table VII, and likewise the adopted va1ues of x in r_rables VIII and IX, are, it is b<>lieved, errors of observation and errorH arising fron1 irregular uwvements of the six inicro:scopes of the comparator. An idea of the relative magnitudes of these two species of error can be derived in the fo1lowing manner: Referring to equations (1), (2), and (3) of section 15, it is seen that the resultant of the errors involved in the quantities Q, ou which the values in Table YII depend, appears in the sums of the weighted squares of the residuals given in the last columu of that table. These sums vary very greatly for different sets of observations, but a trustworthy value for the resultant error may be derived from the. aggregate of the sums µ;iven in the last column of the table. Omitting the Yalues of .Tnly 18 and ~G for the reasons assigned in section 18, the aggregate of the sums is [pli·V j = 168·8. Tbe total number of residuals in the 40 sets of determinations is 200, and tl!e total number of derived values of .:r, y, z is 120. Thus the probable error of an observed Q of weight un.ity (or of any Qz or Q4) is 168·8 \~ ± 0·6745 ( ~ 200 -=I:!oj = ± l·Oµ. This applies to a single measure of the distance between the terminaJ microscopes with the 5m bar B 17 · Since the \Veight of auy () 1 , Q3 , Q5 , or of a single measure of that same dh;tance with the inetre ~1I21 is 1/5, the probable error of one such measure is ±-:: 2·:Y" . Since the Q's which enter the formulas of section V> are independent, it follows that the probable error of a single value of x derived by this process is

± 1·0µ.
f'l-l~ in the preceding section.

This value is only 0·2µ less than the valuederived by a difterent procTbe latter process, it will be observed, takes account of any changes in the quantities x which may occur front set to set of observations or from day to day. The close agreement of the two probable erro1·s is, therefore, au indication that such changes were small, and also that the assumption on which the method of coinpntation depends is esRentially correct. An examination of the resiuuaJs in '-1'able VII shows a satisfactory distribution. Thus, of the whole number of residuals used, namely, 200, 99 are plus, 93 are minus, and 8 are zero each. The maxi1num residual in the class whose weigl1t i8 unity is 2·3/L. The maximum residual in the class whose weight is 1 / fi is H·9,. , which is about three times the corre;;ponding probable error, or ± 2·2µ , as given above. . Jt will be noticed that the [pvv] for the earlier sets determinations ~ 11 .July are considerably larger on the averag('I than for the later ~e~ in August. The only reasons I can assign for this are, first, that the

piert4, which were completed only a R]1ort time before beginning to use them in .J n1y, grew inore and n1ore stable with the drying and hardening of the ce1nent; and, secoud, that. the smaller time interval required to make a set of ob~ervations after the observers had become well accustomed to the work diminished the chance of error from moY<'nients of the 1nicro1-;copes. It does not appear, however, as shown in the preceding se<·tion, that the resnlting values of x were appreciaLly less precit::.e in the earlier t11an in the later co1nparisons: Now, as to the relation of the e1Tors of observation to the aggTegate errors, we n-iay assunte as hitherto tbat the probable error of a single nticroscope reading does no~ exceecl O·!Jµ. The pro bah le error fro1n tl1is source, then, in au obse1·ved (/2 or (J.4 is ± 0·;1'\ if we Rnppose but four readings to be ma<le on B 1,.

This shows a ver;\'" satisfactory degree of stability of the microsieopes. since it is but little more tha11 1 /4 000 OOOth part of the length of Br: or of the distance bebveen tlH~ terminal microscopes. Finally, frotu whatever point of view we regard tlie adopted vahw~ of x in Tables VIII and IX, their accorclance leaves little to be desired. It appears plain that for eitlwr orientation of B 17 the same quantity. essentially, 'vas observed on every date. This is well shown b;y tlu· constancy of the 1nean valn~8 of .r fhr the several dates. Iu Tabk VIII the nu1ximnm diverge11ce of auy date mean from tile adoptl·d mean of all values of :r: ii'I hut 1·21-L, and the corres11ondiug n1axirnuJ11 divergence in Table IX is but 1·91'. ThP- averag·e of these is no greater than the probable error of a sing;le value of x as derived in this se 1 ·tion, namely, ::!:: 1 ·5"; and it is less than the probable error of a si11gk va.lue of x derived in the preceding section, namely, ± 1·7µ. Taking this last probable error as a basis it appea,rs that the menn of four determinations of IJ 17 in tnrms of 1V/~ 1 on the new comparat-or would have a probable error Jess than 1µ or less than l/<.1 000 OO(lt It of B 17 · "'1~e must conclude, therefore, that the te1nperatures of .ilfz1 all(l B 17 were fixed within Yery narrow limits by the melting ice with 'W11icl 1 they were surronuded. (20) S.l/xtema,tic error.-The precision of the reE<ults attained on tlH' new co1npara.tor brought to light an unexpected source of systenrntie error. This source of error a,pf·ears to be due to the fa.ct that the transverse grad nation n1arkH at the ends of B 17 differ much in wiclth, and ' to the fact that the personal equati011R of the observers differ widely in amount. As already stated the width o.f the graduation mark at the A end of I~ 17 is lfH3,..., while the width of the mark at B end is 36·2,.... · .It 11ad been known frmn the experience of the observers, Siebert and

it 'vas not known that their equations varied with difl:(·ring widths of graduation 1narks and micro1neter wire intervali'i until the fact was deYeloped in the cour:.;;e of the determinations detaileu above. It was then easily seen by direct observation that such. difference might intro-

duce an appreciable consta11t error. Fortunately in nearly all the work d011e >vith tbe apparatus tl1e observers l1ave been the Sl'une, ua.mely, Siebert and '\\~oodward; tl1e only exception being the few deter1ninations of length of B 17 made by Tittmann and ,,~oodward in ~Tu1y, lS!H. Before proceeding to examine this question ini11ntely it m:iy be remarked that all defa,1·miuations of Br, indicate a sy.stematic differeuC'e i11 jt~ length depending on its orieutation in the Y-trough. To show this clearly we will collect the results given in the preeeding section:-;. For this purpose it i8 desirable to introduce a more general designatfon for the orientation of R 1, than that used hitherto. ~~e shall adopt the convention that the A eud of B 17 is left or right according as it i8 to tl1e left or right of the observer as he stands alongside of the bar vdiile reading a microscope. Thus _A etHl left corresponds to A end west for the work on the new comparator and to ~.\... end north for the work on the office con1parator.

It. appears from the equations (1) to (4) that the obserT"ations are insufficient to determjne the corrections Sa, 1r,,,, ... without additional relations between them. It is clear~ howeyer, that if the widths and a1'\pects of tbe graduatfons were the same at both ends of the bar, and if the wire intervals of the micrometers were equal, no error from this ~ource would appear in the resulting lengths of tbe bar, and it is a matter of regret that tltese theoretical eonshlerations were not duly appreciated when the bar was constructed. It is clear also that the orientation of B 17 oug·ht to have been changed from day to day, for the en·ors in question would thus have beeu more certain of elimination in the final mean. 'Ve may nevertheless g·ain some idea of the nu1gnitude of the cor1·ections desired from equations (2) and (4), which giye the quantities r arnl v' defined by tlie last two of (f-i).

Giving the values in this table weights proportional to the number of measures for each, there result the followiug weighted means: 1 't' = + 2·91'- ± 0·2..,, ' 1-1 = + 2·3µ, ± 0·2"' . These values, it is seen, not only agree well with each other but are determined with a preeisiou quite equal to that of the correspondiug mean values from Table X. It may be rmnarked that the precisions should not differ m.uclt in the t\vo cases siuee the readings from which r and 1.1 1 are obtaiued are. inade in less than oue minute, and hence stn.bilit,y of the microseopes is depended oil for this short period only. There are, however, nearly twice as rnauy detern1iuations represented i11 Table XI as in Table X, and this fa.ct accounts mainly for the :-;;maller probable errors of v and v' deri\Ted from Table XI. The range amongst the daily means is nearly tlle I'm.me i1i the two tables and :Hnounts at 1nost to 4·1µ.. The observations on B 17 at the times it >n1:-; compared >vith IJrn giye tht.~ fo1lowing values: Apr. ~9, 1892, v = + 2·8"' (mean of 10 measures,) 30, 1892, v = + 2·2 (mean of l 7 measures), 1 J\:lay r1, 189~, 11 = + 1;9 (mean of 27 measures). These values are likewise fai·rly accordant with each other and with the values just given above. Finally, the values of 1'' * derived from the observations on the 100 cnmparator of Holton Base in 1891 are (see Chapter III, section 6): 1 Aug. .4 to Ang. 7, 18lll~ 'l' = + 3·8"-', Sept. 24 to Aug. 6, 1891, ,,_,,i = + 3·3. \.\"""ith respect to the latter results, it is to be remarked that they were obtained with the lower power (27 diameters) Hepsold microscopes, and n1ay not be strictly comparable with the results obt.aiued with micro:-;c1,pes 5 and. 6, which have a power of 50 diameters. They do not 1liffer materially, howe"~er, in the mean from the average values of 'l' or i·' obtained on the office comparator. Collecting all these mean values for v and v' and taking their half "Hms and half differences, we have the following- condensed statement of all the direct information bearing on tiie constancy of the person.al equations of the observers:

!(v - v') in July and August, 1892, whatever it may have been, waR such as to increase v and decrease v' by about the same amount. A
change of t,his kind might have occurred in several ways through changes in the eight quantities Sa, Wa, ... as may be seen by refereuce to the last two of equations (5); but the data do not indicate that the change is more likely to have occurred in one of these ways rather than in another. In view of a.U the evidence presented in this section, it appears certain that the observers as8igned different lengths to B 17, depending on its orientation in the Y -trough. It appears equally certain that this difference is due to personal equation of the observers or to change iu aspect of the graduation 1narkR, or to both these causes. The two causes are entangled with one another and can not be separated without additional data. "\'Ve conclude, however, that the effects arisiug fron1 these causes are well eliminated in the mean of lengths of the bar in its two orientations, or that the error of this mean length, expressed by equation (7), is s1nall. The conclusion j}.1st stated does not require the assumption of constancy and equality of the quantities u and u/ of equations (5), but it see1ns b~st to adopt this assumption in deriving the final lengths of Brr for A-end left and A-end right. The justification of this view is to he found, I think, in an exau1ination of the observed values of v + v 1 ), i (v - v'), and u + u', given above. Thus the first of these quantities varies by 0·4µ. only for three different sets of determinations extending over half a year's time, the second varies by 2·1µ , and tile third by 4·0..... With respect to this last, however, or to the quantity u + u', we must re1nark that it might be expected to vary in observed value much inore than the others, since it conies fro1n data dependent 011 the stability of all parts of the apparatus, while the other two depentl only on the stability of B 17 and the terminal microscopes. But the coll· stancy of u + ·u/ in the determinations of July to August, 1892, renders it highlyprobable that the value then derived is a real quantity, wbich was nu\.sked by errors of the less precise determinations on the office comparator.

The probable errors in this table differ widely, but so far as is knowu they are the best available indexes of the precision of tbe several results. In accordance with the conclusions and assnruption stated iu the preceding section we shall derive three valuetS fol' leugth of B11, namely: First, a length for A-end of I]i., left; second, a length for A-end of B 17 right; and, third, a mean length, which it is assumed will be free frmn coustant error. It will be recalled that the results of July, 1891, ·were obtained by Tittmann and Woodward, while all the rest were obtained by Siebert and Woodward, who used the bar also in the position A-cud right in all the work of Holton base. vVe might, therefore, use the results of 1891 in getting the mean length of B 1 ,, but they should be excluded in getting the other lengths. In any case, however, it cau make but little difference whether we include or exclude the results of 1891, since the weights we are constrained to adopt amount practically to the exclusion of those results. The same remark :::tpp1ie8 also to the results of the indirect determinatio11s of April and 1\Iay, 1892, since their ·weights must be small in comparison with the weights of the ret'!ults of the direct determinations. (22) Derii~ation of lengths of B 17 in terms of llf2 1 .-It is assumed, as already stated, that the length of B 11 ouserved by Siebert and "\Voodward is greater or lesi.; than its mean length aecordiug as the ~q__-eud is left or right by a constant which we 1nay denote by u. In confor1nity with this assumptiou, if B 17 denote the 1nean length of the bar, or the length free from systematic error, B 17 + u will be the observed length for .A-end left and B 17 - t t the observed length for A-end right. The observed lengths given in Table XII afford a series of observation equations from which B 17 and 'll may be determined. In writing these equations the question whether the theoretical weights of the o1Jserved quantities should be modified in any way presents itself: l"Tsiug the probable errors of the observed lengths of 1892 as a basis, the weights of these lengths are proportional to the numbers 1, 0·2, mal 4. These seem to present great disparity, but in view of all the (·ousiderations set forth in the preceding- sections, I am not disposed to cl1ange them. Other numbers presenting less disparity might be used, but the resulting values for B 17 and u would not be much changed thereby. Adopting these theoretical weightH, then, and '.vriting for bre,'ity, /3=B17 -5m, the observation equations given by the results in

r:I'al>le XII become

It is to be remarked that the first two valueis here given apply espe cially to the work done with tile bar by the observer:-; Siebert and "'\Yood ward. Other obserYers having different personal equations miglit assign different lengths for the left and right orientations of the \Jal'. The last value, on the other hand, is supposed to be free fro1n r-y:-;tematic error dependent on personal equation and on the orienta,tirm of the bar. It is the length. \Yhich should be app1ied iu deriving tltf' mean length of a line 1neaRured tlle same uurn ber of times for eael1 orientatiou of the bar. "\Vith respect to the adopted m~ean length of B 17, it may be furtht>r remarked that it differs but O·!V from the mean of the direct determina tions of February and J\Iarch, 1892, and but 0·4,.. from the mean of tlic direct determinations of .July and August, 1892. 'rhese two series 01' deterininatious were die most extensive and accordant of all the determinationK made, though differing much in precision. It is seen, however, that if this difference in precision were ignored, the simple me:rn of the two values for either orientation or for the 1nean of both woul!l not differ widely from the adopted values. Thus, the mean with eqnal weights for A-end. Jeft is 5rn_14.5µ; that for .A-end right is 5m-17·;V' ; and for the mean of these two 5 111 -16·0,.... Finally, it may be reruarkl'd that tlie rrn;;ult8 of .Tuly, 1891, and those of April and May,. 1892, wl1kl 1 are practically rejected by reason of their small weig11ts, do not ditfor at most from the adopted values by amounts much in exeess of the millionth part, of the bar's length; the discrepauces being, in fact, ~{·:V' for A-end left, 6·1,.. for A-end right, and 4·8"" in. the tnean. Moreover, these discrepances ·are quite within the range indicated by the prolmble errors of the inferior results. It appears 1noper to conclude, there· fure, that the va1 ues tor B 17 adopted above, are irustwo~ t-0 the extent shown by their i>robable errors.

B 17 = fJ - 18·0 ± 1·3 for 1\..-e11d right. B 17 = 5 - 16·2 ± 1 ·l for mean. (21) Concluding remarks.-In designing and using the iced-bar appar;1 tus many questions not referred to in the preceding pages were raised and considered. Son1e of the8e have important lJearings ou the practi<'a l :succesA of the apparatus, and most of them will naturalJy arise in the mind of the critical reader. It is proper, therefore, to <levote some att(·ntion to them here. The most obvious aud importa11t of these questions is wl.tetber the bar a:'->sumes the temperature of melting ice when fully pa.eked in it. ).; 4 1 absolutely crucial mode of answering this question is kuown to me, hnr there appears to be no reason to suppose that it takes a materiaUy different temperature. R.e}H~ated observations on mereurial thermomeh'l':-< p1a.ced in the ice alongside of the bar show that they re.ad zero C. withiu the unavoidable errors of a few hundredths of a degree. That th(· bar assumes a fixed length within very narrow Ihnits is, it would i:it·t·n1, demonstrated by the small rauge amongst the determinations of ih length on t11e new co1nparator, and tlte Pqnally small range amongst th<' meas.nres made with the apparatus 011 the lOOrn com1)arator aud the i;;tandard kilmnetre of the Jlolton Base. Considcrin~· these ran:res, and tlie fiwt that the liar's expansion is about ;-,;,µ per d(~gree 0., there is but Very small margin for variation in the bar's length. An independent mHl perhaps more couelusive a.nsw('r to this question is afforded by the re;,.;uits of the two most important groups of determinations of the length of the bar, namely, the group of J1'ebruary to .l\farc.h, 1892, and that of July and August, 1:892. During the period covered by the first group

or

the air temperature about the Y-trongh varied fro1n 50 to 10° C., while for the latter group the air temperature varied from 25° to 400 C. If the bar is affected to any appreciable extent uy the externai air tem1>erature it ought to haye beeu longer at tl1e time of the second group of" comparisons than at the time of the first, since the average air temperature for the :-;econd group was higher b;\- abont 30° C. than for th{' first group. The mean lengths for those groups differ, ho\Yever, l>y ouly 1 ·:!,.,., the indicated fongtb of thP har being so mucll shorter at thP higher tha11 at the Jo,ver temperature. 2\f~v co11clusion, t11en, is that tlte bar assunies a sensibly eonstaut temperature 'vheu properly iced in tht' Y-trougl1. The time required by the bar to reach a stable length is less than ten minutes. The rate of teinperature change is so great in the early stage:; of freezing that 90 per C'ent or more of the contraction of the bar occur:-:. within a niiunte after it is well surron11ded by ice. The correspon1linµ; time required by the prototype metre to reach a, 15table le11gtl1 ~1'ppear~ to he less than :five n1inntes, which is less than the time required to properly pack it in ice. In the use of the apparatus, 110weYer, the bar and metre have been, in general, fully packed iu ice from half au hour to an hour before observiug 011 them. A question which received attention in deHigning the apparatw-; i:-:. whether the friction of the bar on its supports iu the Y-trongh may uot affect its lei1gtl1 apJH"Cciab1y. Since the cross section of the bar i!'." 2·56 square centimetres, and the modulus of elasticity of steel about 2x106 kilogra1nmes per square cm1timctre, it would require a lollgitudinal :stress of 1 ki1ogramm.e to cllange the bar':->. length 11nicro11 it' the bar were free to respond to such stress. Fro1n this calculation and fron1 a consideration of the actual circu1nsta11ces under which the bar is rn.;;ed, it ·was concluded that this friction ·would produce no appre<·ia ble effect. Some direct experiments to test this point were rna1le, however, during the course of the comparisons with the Prototype l\Ietn' of February and l\Iarch, 1892. lu these experirnents the Y-trough ,yas subjected alternately in quick succession to tension and cornpres:-;iou while readings were made on the ear. Several such trials were 1rnttle without disclosing any change in the bar's length. It is, indeed, difiicult to see bow any frictional stress could mauif"l~st itself, especi~dlr when the apparatus is trundled along on its cars as in measuring a line or as used on the new comparator, since the jarring incident to such motion ought to relieve the bar from all but the sn1allest stress. A query may also arise as to the effect on the bar's temperaturl' of the exposed gradua,ted surfaces. It might be inferred tl1at the bar is perceJltibly hotte1· by reasou of these exposed parts, small though they are, than it would be if entirely coveretl with ice. But a study of the physical relations here presented does uot justify sucl1 an inforence. The reason is that the conductivity of the steel is so inuch higher tltMl its emissivity in air that the exposecl 1larts of tlte bar cannot differ in tem1·erature by more than a few thousandths 0:f" a degree from the

unexposed parts.· Whatever this excess may be, it can affect only sliort portions of the bar, and hence produce only vanishing changes of leugth. The sanie conclusion, it would appe~lrr, applies with greater certainty to the Prototype J\-Ietre. A simple aud direct experiment hearing on this question has also been frequently tried. It consisted iu microscope readings on the e11ds of the bar jnst before and just after pressing the bare finger for a period of ten to thirt;v- seconds against one of the graduation plugs. If the heat thus conducted from the hand to the bar is not speedily dissipated, the bar should liave been ineasurably lengthened thereby. No such change, however, was observed. An obstacle which sometirnes prove~ troublesome in the use of the apparatus, is the condeusation of moisture on the gntduated surfaces of the bar. The most effective means fouud for remoYing this is a dry 1·arnel's-hair brusi1. Such brushes were nl".ed in the loug sel'ies of con1parisons of the bar and Prototype :Metre in July and August, 18H2, and no material delay from n1oisture occurred. Finally, experience with the apparatus leads 1ne to recommend a bar having a Y-shaped rather than a rectaugul~u cross 8ection. Such a bar would possess the requisite rigidit,y with small 1nass per unit length. It could be subdivided into inetre spaces by n1arks on its neutral surface, and its entire length determined by 111easuriug those ~paces ·"eparately as well as by the 1nethod depciulent on Ute use of six microxt·opes. Its fiducial lines should be of equal width within a micron or two, so that personal equation would be certain of elimination by exclrn11~e of po:-:;itions of the observers for either orientation of the bar. J·rovision might also be made for protecting the graduated surfaces fnnn direct contact with the ice. For this purpose Jrnrd rubber tubes might be fitted a.round those surfaces, a ud if desirable they could be ma.de long enough to extend up through the ice pack. Such tubes would prevent abrasion of the polished surfaces by grit in the ice, and would also protect them to some extent fr01n currents of air, which, 'if huien with moisture, produce troublesome condensation. r.rhe 1ength 1u melting ice of a bar possessing this degree of refiuenient could be rt>adily determined by the method follmved on the new comparator. It would appear, in fact, from our experience in the use of that comparator that the length of such a bar in terms of a prototype inetre would be k11own with a probable error not exceeding 1 micron from the mean of ~'~:':u measures, wltich might be made in one day, or in tw<) days at most.

(1) Plan of opcraMon.s idth appa.1·atus -in 1891.-Tbe plan subn1itted by me to the Superintendent of the 8nrvey for the use of this apparatus ob the Holton Base of the trani;;continental triangulation in Indiana. contained the following reconnnendations whicb were approved aud carried out during the sunnner of 1891: (a) To construct a 100-inetre coin parator near the Holton Rase; to standardize this c01nparator by repeated n1easurements with the iced bar, and to use thh; comparator in turn to standardize and study the behavior of 1oom tapes or those of less length, or ·any other forn1 of base apparatus; (b) to use the iced bar in addition to make Reveral measures of a kilometre at least of tl1<'base line, so that the efticieucy of the different form~ of apparatus usetl in nieasuring the whole base could be tested on the actual ground over which they were applied. Before giving the results of tbe 1neasnres made with the iced bar it is proper to give a brief desc1·iption of the loug comparator and of tlH· kilometre '\Vhereon the apparatus was used. (2) The 100-metre cmnparqtor.-The l<>O-metre comparator of tlw H-01:ton Ease was a line lOOm long fitted for measurement with the iced bar apparatus. Twent.y:one beech-wood 111icroscope posts, 1·8"' 1011µ: and 15cm x 15cm in c1·oss section, were set firmly in the ground, 5m apart. on a leve1 1)lat near the north end of tbe base. A lougsi<le of the post" a stationa,ry railway tr~ttck was laid, the support post.8 of which wt'r(' half way between the microscope posts. The ends of the line were marked by brass, spherical-headed bolts cemented into the up1Jer crnl~ of stone posts, which latter "\Vere well set i11 bedH of concrete. TJH· comparator was covered by a shed ll()m long by 3 111 widl·. Its~ 1enµ;tb ext.ended nearly east ai1d 'vest. It was covered .at the ends and on tlw south side as well as overhead, but t.l1e Horth ~ide was left open iu order to Jlermit free access of daylight and air. (See illustration No. Bl·) This comparator vas built by Assistant A. T. J\fosmnn after pJa11:-; drawn up by l\'[r. Siebert. It answered it:-; 11urpose very sath;factoriiy. An efficient auxiliary applied by Assistaut Mosman was a sawdust covering to tlie ground along the con1parator. This covering absorbed. the dust and moisture, and prevented the transmission of disturbances through the ground to the microscope l)Osts. The stability of these

(3) The standard ldlmnetre.-A -uear]y level portion, one kilometre in Jm1gth, of the Holton Base was selected b;y Assistant J\losmau for measurement with the iced bar apa.ratus. The base line, whose entire leugth is 5·5 kilometres, runs in a nearly north and soutb direction across tbe Crawfish Flats of Southern Indiaua. The portion selected for the iced bar inea.sure.s pas::-; es for 600rn of its length through a dense forest growth, leaving about 200 1 ·1 at either eud i11 opell fields. The whole kihm1etre h.; on lo''' ground and the part within the forest is, in a wet season, suoject to partial inundatiou. Tlie soil along tbe kilornetre is a stiff clay, 'vhich i:-; Yery firm wl1eu dry, but "-bich assumes a idly-like mobility and elasticity whe11 ~aturated 'Yith water. The way through the fbrest was cleared, and the eud stones of the kilon1etre were set under the direction of Assistant l\Ios1na11 duri11g ~lay and .Tune~ 1891. During the latter half of the following August and early September the microscope and track posts were set along the li1te. Owing to frequent and heavy rai11s this was a tedious operation. l\lany of the posts were set in the water which filled the post holes as fast al'\ they were dug. lt is ilnpossib1e, therefore, to present auy stati:->tics as to the speed with which thh~ work can he done under usually fovorahle circumstances. Jt may be remarked, however, that it is a work w-hich requires but little skil1ed labor. In addition, it should oe l':1i1l that the microscope posts were set with coui-;iderable precision. A4'(_:nra.te spacing of the posts to ;3'" apart was secured by means of Journ and shorter steel tapes, while the posts were aligned by means of a theodolite. The probable error in position of a post face ·with respe<,'t to the kilmnetre line does not, I think, exceed ± ;{mm, while the probahlp error of the reference line fixed on the posts, as explained in section ti, Cl1apter I, does not exceed ± 1mm. The bolts ma1·king the termini of the kilometre were cemented in the e11fl stones by Assistant l\fosman early in August, after their proper relative l)OSitions had been determined by .Assistant 0. II. Tittmann with the Survey secondary apparatus. Inter1nediate stones dividing t ht' kilometre into four nearly eq nal sections were set op. September 7, 1::-.~ll. Each of them consisted of a half cubic metre of concrete set in tl1t· ground so that its upper surface was about even with the ground ~llrface. On the top of each stone was cemented one of the Repsold (T 1 off plates, which are provided with spherical headed bolts for nse Wi111 the cut-off cylinder previously described. · \Yhen these intermediate stones were set, tl1e ground along the line Was 80 wet that it was a matter of difficulty to keep the wa.ter out of the excavations whi1e the concrete was beiug rammed into place. 'l'Jiese stones did not become dry and hard until deep trenches were dug about them on September 18, 1891. For this reason it is probable thrit these stones were much less st~ble lluring 'the first two measures

of the kilometre (September 10, 15) than during the last two m.easures, (September 26, 30) . ( 4) Results of meas,ures of comparator interval.-The distance between the terminal splleres of· the lOOm comparator was measured nineteen times. The first nine measures were made between July 30 and August 7, 1891, and the re1nainder between September 24 and October 6. A measure as here designated means a deterrnination of the comparator interval without interchange of the observers in reading on the ends of the bar. Such interchange of observers took place in all cases except for tlle first five measures, during which direct· observa.tions for personal equation were rnade on the bar. These observati\:rns proceeded on the assu1nption that the relative equation of the observers was the same at both ends of the bar. But, as shown in section 20 of Chapter II, this assumption is not correct. It becomes essential, therefore, to recur to the inveRtigation given in the section just referred to in order to understand how the personal equation affect:' the measures in question. In all measures of the comparator interval the A encl of B 17 ·was right, and the observers were S (Siebert) and W (Woodward). \:Vhen a measure proceeded from left to right (or west to east) S always observed at the right or A end of the bar and Wat the other end, if they did not exchange positions. vYhen tliey did exchange positions. S always observed first on the A end and Wat the Bend of the bar. "°'~en a measure proceeded from right to left, S always observed first at the B end of the bar and -v\T at the A end. &In conformity, then, with the notation of section 20, Chapter II~ let L 1 , L 2 , R 1, R 2 , denote the left and right hand rPadings respectively of a pair of microscopes for any bar length; and let Su Sb, Wa, TVb denote the correctious to these readings for personal equations of the observers at the A end a.nd 13 end of the ba.r, respectively. The11, sup· posing the measure to proceed from left to right, the distance betweeu the pair of microscopes considered is

Now the derivetl length of B 17 for A end right corresponds to the mean of these two expressions (a) and (b); but when, as in the case of the first five measures of the comparator interval, the expression (a) only was observed, the use of" the derived value of B 17 gives a dis· tance . too large by (Ss. - Wb) for each bar length. Similarly, tlle distance in the case of the use of expression (b) only is too small by (Sb - W.) per bar length. It is necessary, therefore to treat the first group of measures of the comparator interval in such a way as to take

dne account of the inequality of the numbers of measures in the two cases denoted by the expressions (a) and ~b). Let D 1 denote the most probable value of the apparent distance between the terminal spheres when the expression (a) is used, and D 2 Hie corresponding value when the expression (b) is used. Then the resulting observation equations will be of tlie forms D1 - 20B17 - Q' = v', Dz - 20 R1, - Q"= v", (1) wl1erein Q' and Q" are the quantities measured with the microscopes a11d cut-off cylinders, and 'l'' and ,,_,u are their n1ost probable co1·rectionR. If, on the other hand, I> denotes the most probable value of the actual interval between the terminal spheres, we shall have D = ~ ~D1 + Dz). (2) In the case of the second group of measures, the observers exchanged positions in every case, so that we might use the values resulting from the means of the expressions (a) and (b); but inasmuch a:-::. it is desirable to get an idea of the constancy of the personal equation effect, we shall treat the second group in the same manner as the tirst; that is, by means of equations (1) and (2). The greater part of the 1neasurcs were mtlide by moving the bar frnm west to east (or left to right) along the comparator. Some of the later measures were ma,de in the opposite directiou, aud they disclose, apparently, a source of systematic though minute error, depending on the direction of ineasure. The same sort of error is iudicated also by the measures of the standard kilometre given in detail below. We shall exl1ibit the data, then, in a way to disclose these effects as well a!' those arising from personal equation. Table I following gives all of the data observed for the length of tl1e comparator except the special observations for personal eq uatiou alluded to above and referred to again below. The first column gives the date of the observations. The second column gives the direction in which the measure proceeded; V\T to B, for example, signifying that the measure started from the west end of the comparator and proceeded towards the east end, or proceeded from left to right. The third column gives the observation equations in the forms (1) above.

(5) Deriva,tion of lengths of Gmnparator.-An iuspection of the results in the above table indicates that the length of the com.parator interval changed during the period of about two months which elapsed betwet'll the determinations of the two groups. That such a change might ocenr seems not improbable, since the stones carrying the terminal spheres rose to a level with the ground surface, and siuce a marked change in the amount of moisture in the ground took place during the period. The results of the second group of determinations indicate tl1at sucll a change was.taking place at the time they were made. Additional evidence that such changes are likely to occur is afforded by the measures of the sections of the standard kilometre, as explained below. It "\Yill be assumed, therefore, that tlie values of D for the two groups shoulcl differ, and t.he observed quantities will be treated accordingly. Attributing equal weights to the observation equations, we haY(' from the first group

It seems pi·ohable, therefore, that. whatever may be the cause of this difference, it is a. real quantity, although it is but 1 GSH OOOth part of tl1e com11arato::.· interval. [ am unable to explain tlle greater magnitudes of the residuals in the second group of comparisons over those in tl1e first group. It may h(· observed, l10wever, tlrn.t the hypothesis of a uniform increase of the i11terval D 1 or Dz, from September 24 to October 6~ satisfies the observed \~:uuel':i very closely and renders them quite as accordant as the first gl'oup of values. So far as skill in handling the apparatus could aftect the measures, those of the latter group should he the more precise, since in the interval between the two groups the obsen-ers had the benefit of a large amount of experience witl! the aJ)pa.ra.tus on the standard kilometre. Judging from our experience on that kilometre during the second set of measures of it, when the conditions were about (·qually favorable to those presented on the comparator, it would seem. irnpo:-;sible for the normal errors of 1neasure1ne11t to produce a range as gn:at as that shown in the second group of comparator measures. The length of the comparator interval was used in turn to standanliz.e the lOOm steel tapes, as explainetl in Chapter IV, and also to ~tandardize the bars of the secondary apparatus. To get working ](·ngths of the comparator for these purposes, it wiU be assumed that tlip, length changed uniformly with the time which elapsed between the two groups of measures. Fortunately the greater part of the<l.cterminatii nrn of the tape lengths was made at about the times of the groups of me;1sures of the comparator il1terval. · l f we take the difference between D 1 and D 2 for the two groups of comparison, we find

These quantities represent twenty times the function (Sa - Wb) (Sh·- lYu.) of the personal equations of the obst:rvers, as shown by the expressions (a) and (b) of section. 4 above. This function is also the sam.e as v' of section 20, Chapter II. Hence we have

6·8,.,. for the :first group, 3·3 for the second group.

The first of these values is less trustworthy than the second, since the latter is independent of all sources of error save that of the character of person.al equation, wltile the former involves other sources of error. If we use the observations of . A.ugust 4 and 7 only in the first group, the resulting value of v' is +3·8"", which does uot differ materially from the value coming from the second group. Had we assumed the values of (S,.. - Tlrh) and (Sb - W,,.,) equal, as wa8 done in a preliminary account of this work published in the American Journal of Science for January, 1893, the 1·esulting value of D for tlrn second group would have been identical with that derived above, while that for the first group would have differed from the value adopted by only 4,... The direct observations for personal equation referred to in sectioa 4, and published iu the number of the American Journal of Science jnst cited, were made on July 30, 31, August 3, 4, 1891. They give 2·4,,. for the value of (Sa - llTb) or (Sb - Wa), supposing these to be equal, arnl 4·8µ for the quantity corresponding to v'. It appears, then, that the relative personal equation of the observer~ would have been an appreciable source of error in this work bad not care been taken to elimi11ate its effect. Finally, attention may be called t-0 the indication of systematic error~ due to the direction of measurement, fnrnisl1ed by the m.easures of October 2 and 6, 1891. Referring to Table I, it is seen that on
Oct. 2,

It thus appears that the measure tr01n E. to W. exceeded that from W. to E. on Oetober 2 by O·o43mrn and on October 6 by O·OS4mm, a.nd in the Inean by 0·064mm. This amounts to 1·6"'" per bar length relatively to
the mean of a forward and backward measure. Taken by itself this evidence would not appear to justify the assumption of the existence of such systematic error; but since a similnr discrepancy is shown by the ineasnres of the kilometre (as expla.ined jn sections 9 and 10 below), it is important to note that the circumstances attending the comparator measureR of October 2 and 6 were closely comparable with those attending the last set of measures of the kilo·

In all measures of the kilometre sections the observer:s exchangt·d JlORitions to elin1inate pm·R01n1l equation, so t11at we have here to consider results of the form J) = ·~ ( 1>1 + ~Dz) only, irn;;tead of the separate quantities D 1 and JJ:.i. as in the case of the first group of the comparatm measures. Throughout these kilometre 1neasures the~~ end of B 17 was right al' in the COlllparator Int:>asnres. The kilometre lies in a north and south direction, nearly, and tl1e direction of measuren1cnt ·will be desiguated as N. to S. (north to southi or S. to N., as the case may be. The rlirection ~- to S. corresponds to the direction left to right of our adopted convention and to W. to E. ("Test to east) in the designation of tlie direction of the meat-;ures of the ] oom cou1parator . . A . s explained in section ~~,the kilometre was divided into four nearJ_,. equal sections by intermediate 1narking :-:.tones set a few days before the first measure was bep:un. Subsequently it was thought desirabh· to have a 8ection loom loug at the north end of the ki19metre n1easured with the iced har, for the purpose of studyiug the behavior of the barf' of the secondary apparatus. Accordingly, a section stone was set 011 September 10, 1891, lOOm sou.th of the north end of the kilometre. 'I'he first set of measures of the kilometre began on September 9, 1891. Starting a.t the north end of the kilometre on the afternoon of this date, it waH thought best to n1easure the first section for practice only, since the 1nen were nearly all unaccuston1ed to the 'vork, and since the portable tracks and some n1inor parts of the apparatus were then used for the first time. Owiug to isome delays but 150m were measured before uigbtfall, when the four microscope:-; were 1eft in place on their pot-;tl' t,o inark the terminus of the day's measure. The work was continued to the end of the section on the following date. The result of thiR trial 1neasnre is not included in the adopted results given below, thon,e:h it is given in a footnote to Table II fol1owing. Although obtained under the nnthvorable con<litio11s stated, it does not dift(~r materially from the re~ults for the sa1ne section obtained a few days 1ater. ln all the kilometre rnt~ctsnres the observers on the bar were J. S. Sic· bert and H. S. '-Yoodwar<l. Siebert in all cases adjusted the micro:;;cope at the fro11t end of the bar, while Woodward held the trough aud oar by 111eans of the lover, as explained ful1y in section 10 of Chapter I. The gea<le-sector reading1:> and the alignment nicasures were observed by ~John F. H~1yford. The record was kept by Robert Penington, except. fiw the last day's work, September 30, when Mr. Hayford performed this task iu additiou to his work of observation. The cornpntations entailed by the work were 1nadc by Siebert, Hayf(-.rd, and ~' ood ward in the ti"eld, and carefully revised at the oftice by 8iebert and Woodwru.·d.

As already stated in section 3, the grou11d along the kilometre at the time of the first two measures was very 'vet and in some 1ilaces inundated, and in view of the differences in magnitude of the discrepancies (1 - 2) shown in Table III, for the sen·ral sectio11s, it is important to consider a number of circumstances wl1i<"h were present during the time of the first pair of measures but ab:"-l'llt during the time of the second pair. Those portions of the kilometre whereon the stahility of the micro1 scopes was leaRt, fell in the sections 250m to oOom and 750 111 to l,000" · Along about lt>0 111 of the first of these the gi·ou1ul was more or h·:-;s u11der water and very elastic, so tbat wben a length of the portahle track was carried forward considerable vibrations were transrnirtetI throngh the soil to the microscope posts. Along the other sectioll t be ground was in general much d1·ier, and hence the posts were in g'l~n eral much stabler. But near the middle of the section was a low stretch of about 50m whel'e the ground was wet, and where the posts wert· set to a less depth tl1an elsewhere in order to avoid steep gradients; so that tlie microscopes had here much less than the average stabi1it~·· On recurring to Table III it is r;eeu that the differences (1 - 2) f~r these sections are much larger than those for the other sections, aull it

if'> difficult to avoid the inference that the lack of average stability of the 1nicroscope posts on these sections gave rise iu so1ne way to the error i11 qnel".tion. A way w-hieh 11aturally sug·g(·sts itself is the f()llowing-: Corn"ider a measure of the kilmnetre proeeecling- frmn north to south. It wa.H the habit of the n1icroscope porter to stand on tlie south side of the tnicroscope postR wlH~n clamping the miero:-:copes to then1. Ile thns turned the clamp screw >d1id1 ti:~ll on tlw east side of aHy post wjth his right hand. If in this operation la· hahitnally pmshed the posts towards the north, they would not !".Jl('('dil;v re(:ovei· their normal positions when set in 'vet or viscou:o; 80il. ..:\ 11y .iarriug about them, however, would tend to hasten the recoyery of tlwi1· normal positions. Such jarring was always eaused by the moYern<·uts of the OJH'ratiYei.i. with the heavy car tracks and by the rolling of the c~ns along tl1e tracks. Under these conditions each rnicroseope would undergo more or less displacement t.owards the soutl1 r~ftcr it ·was used at th(~ fro11t eud of the bar aud before it was m;;.ed at the rear end. This would m.ake tllt:· measured value of the distaHce too snwll. On tbe other hand, when the 1nea.sure proceeded in the 01)posite direetion, the porter stood OH the same side of tlie posts as before stated jn fastening the rnicro1'-l'Opes, and hence their dis1l1aeements would still be towards the south. The measured value of the distance would thus be, in this case, too
g_'l'Pat.

l'his hypothesis explains all the discrepancies between the forward and backward ineasures of the kilornetre as ·well as those of the comparator measures of October 2 and 6, to which attention is called in ~ect.ion 6 above; for in the measures of the comparator on the two latter dates the porter who inoved and clam1)ed the microscopes ·was tlw one who handled them in all the kilometre measures, and it is practically certain that whatever habit lie followed in the Jatter work '\Yas adhered to in the iorn1er.* ln the light of this bypotheRis the larger valnes of the discn:~pan f.'iPs developed in the measures ot· the kilometre sections on wet and ])la:';tic ground, and t11e practical disappearance of Hu<·h diRcrepanci~s iu the second set of measures lnade when the ground was tlry a.n<l the n1ij'.roscopes very stable, are easily understood. ln view of all the evidence, the explanation just given is regarded as the most plausible one assignable for the systematic error in question. But there are some other circumstances affecting the first two rw·mmres of the south half of the kilometre which are worthy of meutinn. In the :fi.rst ineasure of the section 50om to 750m oue stop was Ina<le and the measure transferred for a half hour to a cut-off plate, 'Yl1il(· some posts which had been slightly misplaced were put in proper po:-:.ition.

llHHh· h.\~ rea8ou of a shower of rain. r_rhi:-; delay hrought us to tlu· e11d of the St~<'tiou after uig-htntll, aud a still (urther delay was caused at that end by a 1naladjnstment of the terrninal mieroscope post vdth reference to the (·ut off sphere. Lamps fc)r illuminatiug the n1icro:-;copes -were at hand, so that no difficulty on this score resulted, but during the delay i 11 tl1e 1 a.st. instance dependence had to be plaeecl 011 the stability of the microscopes. Although great care was takeu i11 aH these eases to a void the iutroduction of error, the opportnuitie:-1 fo1· iti-; occurrence -..vere, of <·ourse, greater thau when no delay took plac(~. J)nring the reverst_· or second measure of this section the rear iuieru:-;cope wal'> 8et torwarcl or backward five tilne.s by nteans of its sli<k rest in order to bring the fc)l'ward microscope within reach of t.l1e ewl of the bar. This metho<l of shifting the microscopes was also resortPd to three thnes 'lu1-iug the second n1easure of the section 5001"' to 7;30 111 .* These (lisplacem(~nts were 1nca:-;ured with a inillimetre scale, aud it i,...:. possib1e, though I deen1 it very improbable, that son1e formidable error -was introduced thereby. Finally, a fear was entertained that s011w di~placement of the cnt-off sphere at the 75om stone took·place duriug the interval of two days which elapsed between the first two measun·;-; of the south half of the kilometre. The bas.is of thili fear lay in tlw fit et that by acdden t or design on the part of' s01ne one unconneetcd with the work a heavy block of wood used as a cover to the stone wa,...:. allowed to fall on tl1e cap of the ent-off sphere. The cap -..vas tlrns driven on the sphere so tightly that considerable force was requisite to remove it; and it is possible, though not very probable~ tbat tl1i:-: douhJe disturbance produced some displacement. Witlt regard to the circun1stances attendiug the second pair pf measures of the kilometre, it should be said that they were in nearly every way more favorah1e than those attending the first pair.

These tii;.rures indicate considerable m.o,-ementi-; of tlle ma1·kil1g' stones; :rnd it seems not in1probable that moveuwuts of sneli 111ag11itude di<l. adually occur, since the stones rose to t,he surface of the ground and tl1e moisture in the ground varied frotn the extreme of saturation to tli1· extreme of dryness during the iuterval of fifteen days which elapi;;ed ht·t wt-eu tLe two sets of measures. It will l>e seeu also, from these .figlll'PI'\, that a 1nove1nent towards the south of 0·5""" of the first sectiou ~1cn1e would account for the discrepancies presented by the nieasures of tht~ tir:'lt two sections.

From the evidence just submitted, together with that furnished by the measures of the ioom comparator, aud fro1:11 an intimate knowledge of tlte conditions attending the work, it is impossible to doubt that we were dealing to a quite appreciable extent with actual movements of the marking stones. For thi.s reason it would seem essential to the highest precision in measures with the iced-bar apparatus to place the markiug· stones well under ground and to give them plenty of time for settlement before using them. (11) Proba.ble errors of the kilomctr~ measures.-From the data awl discussion given in the preceding sections, it appears' that the errors affecting the kilometre measures as expressed in terms of B 1 , are of three kinds, namely: First, error of operation of the accidental clas~; secoud, error of operation of the systematic class; and third, error ari~ i11 g from motions of the marking stones, ·which latter may be assumed to be of the accidental sort. In the case of tl1e tir:-;t t'vo rneasures of the kilon1etre it would seem that the systematic error surpassed by far the resultant of the other two. In the case of the last two rneasures the systeinatic error, tlwugh probably still the controlling one, was very small and to so1ne extt·ut concealed by the resultant of the otLer t\vo. It would seem quite safe tl1en to deduce the probable error due to the accideutal errors of 01>eration from the second set of measures on the supposition that the twn other sources of error were inoperative, since the value thus reached will be too large. No such limiting value, however, can be assigned :for either of the probable errors dne to the other sources, since t1w uneliminated portion of the sy-stematic error is entangled with the error due to ~tone 111ove1nen ts. Recurring to the sacond system of equations and values given in section 9, it is seen that the probable error of a single measure of a section (of 250m length) is ± 0·04[imm; and this is the upper limiting value for the probable error of operation when the apparatus is used on stable ground. From this it follows that the eorresponding probable error for one measure of a kilometre is ± O·o9mm. It is of interest to compare this with the value deducible from tla~ measures of the 1oorn comparator, where the conditions were essential];\' the same as those which obtained during the second set of measures of the kilometre. Referring to section 5, we have ±: 0·036mm and ± O·Oul"'m as the probable errors of a single measure of lOOm without exchange of observers to eliminate personal equation. Taking the average of the~e two values, dividing it by v 2 to allow for exchange of observers, and · multiplying the quotient by ../10, we have for the probable error of 011e measure of a kilometre, as inferred from the comparator work, ::I:: O·ll"''", which agrees well with the value just giv-en above. It is clear from these figures that, with stable microscopes and with stable section marks, the error of measurement may be rendered quite insignificant in cmnparrison with that of the length of the measuring bar.

(12) A doptcrl lengths anr7 probable errors of f.lte kilonudre sections and kifomctre.-In deriviug final values for the lengths of the sections and

for the whole ki101netre, we should deal only with the means of the forward and backward lnea.sures, siIH:e in these m.eans the systematic error is partly, if not largely, eliminated. 'rhn lengths in question slionld appertain to an epoch falling: nearer to the epoch of the second Ret than to that of the first set of m.easures of the kilometre, since it waR used from September 8 to October 8, 18H l, as a standard in testing the behavior of the 1oom steel tapes and the secondary apparatus. Whatever lengths we derive will be affected by the changes which took place in the relative positions of the marking stones. It is believed that these ehanges were considerable in comparison with the actual errors of measurement affecting the mean results in either set of tneasures. In view of tbe::m considerations, it. if;; deemed best to a~sign double weigl1t to the mean results of the second set of measures, and compute probable errors for the weighted mean values of the sections accordingly. In conformity with this plan, then, the mean values given in Table III, or in section 9, furnish the following system of observation equlltions and values, 81, 82, s:i, 84, being, as in section 9, the most probable values of the excesses of the sectious over 50B1 ;-:

(13) Adopted lengths a/nd. probable error of 1oom sectfon.-The 100"' section at the north end of the kilornetre was used in so1ne experiment:-:. with the secondary bars, and it is important to adopt some lengths for it.

( 1) Hi."ltoricnl note.-The investigatio11 of the practieahility of using 1011g metallic tapes for measuring lines of precision was taken up by tltt· Coast and Geodetic Snn~ey in the autumn of 18HO. This work was :t8 . ..;igned to t,he.writer, who devised the.· apparatus and mPthodR described 11erein. During the winter of 18fl0 and 18D1 a great nu1nber of experiments "\q·rp made with a view to deterinine the best method of stretchiug and a1ig11i11g- a tape, and e:':\pe.cially with a view to discovering the most effective way of getting the tape's temperature. For this purpose a 100'" comparator was set up in the Botanical Garden at '-Yashington, n. C. This comparator consisted simply of a ~eries of equidista1it iitakes, lOm apart, bearing support nails for tbe tape, and a post at eit lier end, on which were attached scales for defining the tape's posifon1 at any time. Iu addition, a large number of laboratory experiH1P11t~ were made with varionR thermometers to determine their sen:;;iriYities under differing emHlitio11s. This preliminary work serYed to hx attention on most of the points essential to the use of tapes in precis .. work. 1 >urjng the spring of 18Hl the apparatus a8 herein described was «1n1structed by D. Ballanf of"~Vashington, D. C., and by the Instrument J li,-i;..;ion of the Survey, and in July following, the apparatuA was taken to I Ioltou Base, where the long tapes were standardized on the lOOm t·omparator described iu section 2 of Chapter III. The tnpes were in tnn1 used to 1n.easure llolton Base during the san1e su1nmer. The five l"-t·J"tions of this base (of 5 500"') were measured from six to thirty times t'itdt under various circumstances as to temperature, thne of day, etc., a11 1l the behavior of the tapes was well shown by the measurei:; of the kilo111ptre section whieh was staudardized hy n1eans of the iced bar apparatus as explained in Chapter III.

feasibility of :-;tretching two tapes shnultaneously was demonstrated, however, and if a suitable metal for use with'steel can be found it may prove advantageous to discard the 1nercurial therrnoinete-rs.

:-;unace of the tape, wliere it is uot poli~hed to re(:eiYe the graduations, is of a dull black color. YYhen not in use the ta1,es are rolled up on reels, aud they n1ay be thus transported with ease and safety. (3) The tape-stretchcrs.-'rhe uature of the tape-stretchers used to give tension and alig·nment to the tape may be best understood by a glance at the cut on page 414. They consist of a lever hinged by a universal joint to a platform on which the operator stands. This leYer is made of a piece of steel tubing terminatiug iu a hickory handle. Aloi1g the upper two-thirds of the tube. ii-; cut a scrmv thread on 'vhich a wheel nut plays freely. This nut giyes a verti<'al motion to n gimbal-jointed 1".upport to which a spring ba]a,nee is attached. The balance is connected with the tape by means of a short piece of i-;ash chain. It is evident from the figure that the stretel1er has all the n1utions necessary tu enable the operator to align the tape aud to give it the proper ternsio11. The balanee, which is simply a comrnercial artieh· a<lapted to the purpose, reads to ounces, and may be easily held to the nearest ounce hy the operator. Au important item for the safety of the tape used is a breaking link, or a link which will part under a tension of about 14 kilogrammes or :JO pounds. A link of this sort is provided at each end of the tape, so that it can not be overstrained by accitleut. It will be noticed that the balance carries two hooks. The extra hook, which is attached t-0 the balance frame, was intended to carry t.lte additional tape in case it proYed advantageous to use tapes of different metals simultaneously. This plan of stretching two tapes '''orked very satisfactorily, the tension of the steel tape being given hy one balance and that of the bronze by the otber; hut, for the reason stated above, this plan was followed only in making a few of the tave comparisons n1entioned below. ·'.l1he extra hook, it may be stated, ii-' provided with a longitudinal screw motion, so that by means of this and the links of the connecting chains the tapes may be always broug·ht to the proper tension, whatever their temperature. \Vhen a single tape is used, the rear end is attached to the extra liook of the rear end balance, while the desired tension is given by the balance at the front end of the tape. · An objection to this form of stretcher lies in its weight, which is about 45 pounds. Contemplated improvements will lighten it by t:it·vera1 pou1uls and bring the balance to a position concentric witl1 the 1e\·er shaft. Experience has shown> however, that an able-bodied 0 1·erator can handle the stretcher successfully when ineasuring at the rate of 2 kilometres per hour. During the measurement of St. Albans hi~e, in 1892, 8 kilometres were measured on one occasion between I :'.30 p. m. and tniduight withont excessive fatigue to the operators. ~·4) The thermometers.-The thermometers used are of t.he Centigrade

In any case. it seemi.; desirable to blacken the bulbs of thermo1neters used with st1·t·I tapei.; presenting a blackPned surface. A great nnmher of experin1ents, made in the Botanical Ga.rd<>n ll1ll'.ing the winter of 18H0-'91~ Rhowed that with the thermo111C'te1·s arranged as just described (i. e., with aluminum sheatlu;:.) they folJowed the tape temperature without serious lagging when observation8 wen· 1ncule nuder a clPar sky at night. Snhse11uent experienee in determining the tape 1engthH on the JOO'" co1nparator of Holton Base showed a very satisfactory accordaHCt' uf the tape and tl1ern101neter te1nperatures, whether observations wt're 1na(le during the day or nig·ht. This co1npara.tor was covered, howe\'t'r, except on itH north side, by a shed which screened the tape from tl1t> direct rays of the sun. Sometinws three of the therinometers were used with the tape, awl at other ti1nes two. '\Vhen three were used, they were placecl one nt the midtlle of the tape's length and one at one-sixth that length from either end. ~rlten two were used they were generally J>laced at onefourth t.he tape's length from. its ends, re8pectively. For the most precise work, as in comparisons for deter1nining the tape lengths, t.be i.11ree thermmneteri-. were each r<~ad twice, once just before and once just after the obHervations on the tape. ':rhe meau of the six t,hermometer re.:1,lings thus 111ade gave the tape's te1uperature with a probable error nf about :±: 0·2r' C., equivalent to 500 -1rrno part of the tu1le length, wlicll observations were made at night or under the comparator shed.

This is especialJy essential tor 'vork of the highest precision carried on at night. Assuming this to have been done, and that nigl1t work is contemplated, the operation of measurement, if carriC'tl on rapidly, will require twelve u1en, to 'vit, tw·o observf:'rs of the taw', one at the front and one at the rear end; two observers of thermometers, who also help to carry the tape forward; oue reeorcler; two operators of the stretchers; five inen to handle lamps aud to t'arry the tape forward. The.co-operation of the observt:>rs and other operatives is secured by means of a code of signals 1ilade with whi1.:.tles held by the observers. Thrn..;, when the observer at the rear end of the tape is ready to have tlu· tensiou applied, he gives one blast of his whistle. The stretcher at the front end immediately brings hi.s balance to the proper reading-, when the observer at that end announces tbe fact with one blast of his ""histle. 'Vith the tape under tension the rear-end observer adjusts thi· 1·ear-en<l graduation of the tape to coincidence with the definin12: 1uark on the zinc plate at that end. When thi:-; is accomplished he c:.:·i\·e1-1. two blasts from his whistle. Ou hearing these, the recorder, whu 1-\tancls at the middle of the tape length, immediately lifts the tape a li·w centimetres from the support nail near him and lets it fall back. T11·· effect of this is to tnake the tape straight and relieve it from friction on the support nails.

The speed attained in this process has been about 2 kilometres per hour, though a single kilon1etre has been measured in twenty minutet-1. Hy reason of the expansion and contraction of the tape, it is frt>quentlJ- desirable to set the tape back or forward by a round numuer of centimetres. This may be done on the zinc pJates by means of a suitable pocket scale. Sneh displacements are recorde<l as "set-back:"~· and ''set-ups."

B.-DETERMINATION OF EQUATIONS OF TAPES.

(7) Apparatus for obscrdng lengths of tapes.-It i:-; obviously necessary to the successful use of long tape:s in measuring lines of precision to provide suitable nteaus for observing the tape lengths at different temperatures. Such data for any tape give its length at some assuruecl tei~perature and its rate of expansion, and thus enable us to write an equation from which the length at any observed temperature cau be computed. In order to meet this requirement in a way which wonld leave least room for doubt concerning the actual behavior of the tapes: the JOOm comparator described in section 2, Chapter nr, was devi:"ed. The features essential to a study of the tapes e1nbodied by tlie comfntrator were, 1st, that its length could be determined by mean~ of the iced bar apparatus with a precision superior to that attainable with the tapes; 2d, that the tape could be stret.che<l and aligned ou the comparator in precisely the same way as when used in the field; aud :>d, that the tape length at any tiine could be quickly and accurately referred to that of tbe comparator. · As explained in section 2, Chapter III, the ends of the comparator were .marked by spherical-headed bolts, or cut-off spheres. The ··u<l 1narks or graduations of a tape when under comparison were obsern~d by uieans of micrmueter microscopes mounted over the cut-off split>re>' as when used in measuring the length of the comparator with the ict~d bar apparatus. The positions of the tape ends could thus be accura rely referred to the cut-off spheres through the n1edium of the cut-off cyliuders described in section 8, Chapter I. Th~ tape stretchers were mounted on the stationary car track of the comparator, and by means of their vertical adjusting screws the graduate<l surfaces of the tape could be easily brought to focus under the microscopes. The ta1,es were supported at intervals c.f 1om on wire rods attaelted t-0 the alternate 1nicro:.;;cope posts of the comparator; and the method of handling the tape was in every wa.y similar to that followed iu field

measure1nents with the tape, except that its graduation marks were ob;-;erved with rnicronwter microscope~. The thermometers were hung from light wooden supports attached to tlie 1nicro1-1cope posts of tlie middle of the comparator a.ud at 15m from either end. The sterns of tlie thermometers were upright and the bulbs ·were kept at about tile same height as the tape. (.~) Jlfethoil of obsc1Tation.-The programme adhered to iu all determinations of the tape leug;tl1s made ou the 100"' <'.omparator is the following: The tape being monHtf·d Oil its support nail>' and attad1ecl to the tape stretchers, was fir~t put nuder teu1-<ion, aligued, and hrong-ht 1.o f()cns under the 1nicroscopes at the m1<ls of tlw comparator. ''-'lieu thi~ operation was eornpleted at the east end of tlie co1nparator, the observer of that end gave one hla:-;t. from 11h; whii-;tle. TltP oh:servt~1· at tlie "\YPf'-t eu<l au.s\Yered this signal by one blast from his >diistJe as soou as the a.d.i11:-;tments at his end were completed. r.t.,he olH5t'"l'\'er"' then read the tht·rn1ometers nearest to the1n, "\-vhile the reconler who :-;t;u1ds near tlte middle of the comparator read the thermometer at that point. On aimouucing their thermometer reading""' to the recorder and hea1~11g hi.~ n'petition of them, the obsHrvers returned to their respective euds of the ('ornparator and re-e:xa1nined their ndju8tmeut:s of the tape and 1nicro:o:;copes with respect to one another; a11d the tension, which >vas always. i1 ppJied at the west end of the comparator, was hronght to its normal value. On completing bis adjnRtment th~ observer at the en<St end J.!':!YP one blast from hi.s wllii"ltle. Tbis was responded to by one l>last from the whistle of the observer at the west eud as soon as hi:-; adjnstm1·nts were satisfactory. Tbe observer at tlw ea::--;t then g-avt' two blasts fro111 his whistle, whereupon the recorder lifted the tape a fow eeutillldres fron1 and let it fall back on the middle support nail. This :-;ei·,·ed to relieve the tape from friction on its support nails; arn.l as l'.11nn as the tape ceased vibrating the observf'r at tlle east eud gave one Lla,.;t from bis whistle. This was responded to by one blast from the WhiKtle of the oi:her observer, and the microscopes wtc>.re immediately lir11nght to bisection on the graduation marks of the tapes. This comp1ded, the observers excl1anged :;;iguals, and proceeded at ouceto re-read tl1P thermometers. Fiually, after completing the n·cord of the ther11111rneter readings, the observers re,fl·rred their respective n1icroscopes to ! he cut-oft" spheres of the comJlarator. The time required to 1nake such a set. of obseryat.ions, ex.elusive of thi· nit-off 1neasures, was two to thret.'l minutes, while the cut-off measure.~ reqnired about two mi11ntes a<lclitioual. 1 u observing on the tape it was generally found moi-:t eonvtmient to m'.iv, . the whole microscope by mea.us of the longitudinal screw of its

observing on tlie tape, so that a correction could be applied for any departure fro111 the normal tem.:,ion. Tables I aud II follo'iviug give the records of a complete set of obst·rvatious for temperature and length of 10om steel tape No. 88 on the comparator. As will be seen by a glance at Table I, the thermometers were n~a(l to tenths of a degree. ln order to make such rea.diugs with ease, handn1agnifyi11g glasses were used. 'I~he standard tension adopted for the lOOm steel tapes was 25 pomHb, 9 ounces (11·596 kilog-rammes). This is the tension given by the halaiwes rn.:,ed when they are horizontal, whe11 they are free fron1 ind(·x error, and when tlle;\' reacl 25 pound8 eveu. The departure from thi~ even readiug was obsen-ed to the near('st ounce; or what amounts to the same, the actual rcadiug of tl1e balance at the tin1e of observin,!!' with the 1nicroscope on the tapes was noted. Since it was generally easiest to moye the whole microscope by means of the longitn<linaJ sm·ew of its slide rest in reading on the ta pt>. the micrometer scre,vs \vere usually set to the same readiug at the two ends of tlie <'Ornparator in order to simplify the computation whkh requires the difl'e1·ei1ce of the n1icrm;;eope readings. The records of the cut-off measures are in all respects similar to tl1o~e obtained in 1neasureme11ts with the iced bar, and f"ully set fort.11 in ~ec tion 11, Chapter r, to which reference may be made for a.n explanation of the meaning attached to the symbols in '.Uab1e II.

Their freezing point readiugs were not again determined until ~January ~I, 1892, wl1en they read + 0-150, + 0·17o, and 0·00° respectively. To take account of tl1ese cl1anges in the freezing point readings it is assumed that they varied directly as the time during the interval whid1 elapsed between the two deterininations of August~ 1890, and Januar.-.-. 1892. This assu1nption gives for the zero point readings at the epoch of the tape comparisons, September, 1891, say, +0·17:::J, +0·15°, aud O·ooo, respectively; and tbese are the values adopted. The changes which these readings entail in the corrections in Ta.ble

III are found by adding +o·oso t-0 the corrections for No. 5598, l'Y
adding -0·07° to the corrections for No. 5599, while the corrections for No. 5601 remain unchanged. Since the thern1ometers always had the same readings within a· degree, it has been considered sufficient to apply the mean of their corrections to the mean of their readings in computing results from com· parions on the lOOm comparator. .Accordingly, the mean corrections in Table IV following have been a.pplied in deducing the temperatures of the tapes from the observations on the comparator.

The means of the six tLern1ometer readings 1vere carded to 11undre<lths in the cmnputatiou, and the abovt> corrt><'tions were then applied iu getting the adopted tape tempera ture8, which an· likewise carried to huudredtl!s of a degree. This is to some extent a needless refine-

ment, but its application cost little labor. (11) Adopted lengths of the comparator.-As explained in section 5, Chapter III, it is assumed tlmt tl1e comparator interval or length IJ changed during the period of t'-YO mouths wl1ieh elapsed between the two groups of determinations of that interval. l~'ortunately, the large8t groups of tape comparisons were nearly coincident in time with those of the comparator measures. J~or the s1nall number of tape eomparisous made between August 30 and Septe1nber 5, a length of the e0111parator interval i.s derived ou the assumption that it char:.ged directly as the time between tbe two epochs for which lengths are given in :<.ection 7, Chapter III.

(12) Oorrectionfor index error of balance.'(.-The S})l'i11g balances used to give tension to the tapes were tested frou1 time to time by the metliod explained in section 4, Chapter V. They ·were also testell frequently with known weights to see that they gave the tensions indicated.· The standard tension adopted was 25 pounds 9 ouuces, which is the tension given by the balances when horizontal, wheu the-y are free from indl~X error, and when they read 25. poun<h; even. By reason of some a(·dde.nts to the balances their index errors chang·ed to some extent during the season. They were always accurately observed, however, aiid the corrections applied are without sensible error. The correction for index error is of the same forin as tllat for excess of tension explained in section 9 above. The adopted elongation of

the tape per ounce was o-047mm; and tlrn corrections actually applied to the lengths of the tapes as computed by equation (1), section 9, are the following: Aug. 1 to Aug. 8, 1891, O·OO, Aug. 30 to Sept. 5, 18Hl, -0·16,

The 111ethod usuall,y followed in trei\tiug this prohlen1 is lnt~(·il ou the assun1ptiou that q = :x;, or tl1at the temperature ollscrvations art not subject to error. In the pre:-;ent application, it seems more fitti11g to n1ake the other extreme as;-;umption, viz, that p = ~, since the tern· perature errors surpass hy far the resultant effect of all other errort". Both these extrmne assumption8 were 1na.de in the con1putatio11s a~ actually carried out, and it may be said that the resnlting values of ,r and y do not differ appreciably, so that for practical purposes mw method is as good a8 another.

Thus, the whole number of the residua.ls in t1ie two table1'4. is 16:!, and of these, as just slJown above, 81 are positive a.1ul 81 negative, while the prolmblc error of a single determination of Ieugth is ± 0·17mm for tape 8£> aud :±. 0·22"'°' for tape 88.

The agreement thus shown between the actual and tbeorctk>al distribution of the residuals is, in general, quite cloRc. ~-'\.s is ui'oual in such eomparisons, the depnrtnre from. theory is greatPst. in the case of the large errors. On the whole, therefore, it appea,rs that the errors to ·which these determinations of tape lengths were subject are of the compensating elass. A confirmation of this view is afforded hy the residuals of the group mean values shown in Tables VII and \:-III. If the errors to which the individual determinatio11s are snq,ject were not of the eompensating class we should expect large residuals to result· front those group means. The residuals are largest in the ease of the results for tape 85; but they reach only 0·2 11n" at the maximn1n, and this for group means having relatively small weight. 'rlw degree of compensation was manifestly best for the eompnrisons of tape 88, since the maximum group residual shown in Table VIII is ouly o-03rnm, while the individual residual!:> for the comparisons of tape 88 were-, on the average, ~omewhat greater than those of tape 85. The average of the residuals in Tables VII and VIII, regardless of weights, is O·Of)nun. This is Pqnivalent to an error of 0·0()0 C. in temperature of the tape and to ;) ,-; 000 OOOths of a tape length. Xotwithstanding the compensating eharact.er of the errors in question when taken as a whole, a careful examiimtion of the residuals in TaUies V and VI indicates that the determinations were subjeet more or less t-0 some systematic errors. These seem to be chiefly of two kiuds, namely: First, errors due to lag of the tape ten1perature relatively to that of the thermometers; and second, that due prouably to })eeuliarities of radiation which produced at times somewhat persistent differences in temperature between the tape and thermometers. The lag effect is best shown, perhaps, in the observa:tions of October 8 and 9, 1891, which were continuous for twenty-four 11ours except for an interval of four hours on October 8, when the apparatus was nsf cl in measuring a section of Holton Base. The an1ount of this lagging mny have been as much as 0·2° C., though it is entangled with other

errors to sucli an extent that oi1e cannot draw a definite coucln:sion from the residuals of the tables. J<Jxamples of what I have provisionaIJy calle1l the "radiation effect" are afforded by the observations of Se-ptember .>, October 3, and October 4, in the comparisons of tape 88. For these dates the residuals are all relatively large and of one sign. On the same dates, however, no such persistence in sign is shown by the residuall'> of tape 85 which was alongside and ·within two centimetres of tape 88 on the con1parator. It S(·ems impossible that there could have been R1H·l1 a difference in temperatnre of the tapes thus situated as would appear from the residuals just cited; but similar persistent differences between the tape and thermon1eter temperatures appeared at tilnes iu tlw n1easures of Holton Base. on cloudy days, especially, aud there seem~ to be little doubt of their reality. (See section s, Chapter v.) Tlw only reason I am able to assign for the difference in behavior of the two tapt;s when lyiug a]ougside of' one another on the comparator on the dates referred to, is that the lower surface of tape No. 88 l1ad becmne son1ewhat polished, presenting a bright, rather than a dull black surface, front much use in preparing the standard kilometre and other sections of IIolton Base. Otherwise the tapes were in all respects alike, having been cut fron1 the sani.e coil. This radiation effect, or whatever it 1na.y he, was observed to he present in a somewhat greater degree in some experin1euts on the behavior of the tapes n1ade in the open air and in sunshine on a portion of St. Albans BaRe in 1892. Since t11ese experiments will be referr~~d to in section 2(), Chapter v, I may dismis~ the question here with the reinark that it is the only anomaly presented by the tapes in my experience, and that it is probably tlrn ouly serious obstaele in the "\Vay of making the long tape a standard whose equation can be rletermiued with a precision little short of that attained with laboratory standards. (16) Probable errorH of tape lengths.-The probable errors of the mean lengths of the tapf~s given in equations (7) and (8), Rection 14, are dtH" to the errors of comparison only. 'rhe total probable errors of thm~e inean lengths, when expressed in metres, depend, first, ou the errorR of comparison just 1nentioned; second, on the error in length of the e01nparator as measured with the iced bar B 1 : ; tbird, on the error in leugth of B 17 when expressed iu ter1us of the International l\Ietre, and fourth, on the thermometer errori-. with respect to the hydrogen scale. For the probable error due to tl1e firist source of error we may adopt the mean of those given in equations (7) and (8) above, namely, ± 0·022'""'. This amounts to 1/4 550 OOOth part of a tape length. . The resultant probable error due to the 15econd and thir<l 15ouree,-.; of error is given 1u section 7, Cha.1>ter u:1. It is± o-033mm, or 1/3 000 OOOtlt

above. It is estimated that the probable error due to this source cau not exceed :± 0:02" C. This is equiva.Ieut to :± O·O:wmm or 1/f; 000 OOOth part of a tape length. 'raking the square root of the sum of the squares of these independent probable errors, there results ::I:: o-044mm for the total probable error of the length of eitlJer tape when expressed in term~s of the International Metre, and when its temperature is the mean of those observed during the comparisons. This probable errm· is equivalent to 1/ 2 270 OOOth part of the tape length. The probable errors of the rates of expansion of the tapes given in e11untions (7) and (8) ~ue :± o-0021rnrn aud :± o-00;~:! 11 ·m, and for the sake of unifor1nity we may adopt the mean of these, or :± 0·0026 111 m, as a working value for either tape. With t.hese values of the probable error of a tape length at its mean temperature and the probable error of the rate of exparn;;ion, it follows that the probable errol' of a tape length at auy temperature tis given by the expression

The :-;q nare root of the average of the sqnares of the errors given hy (9) betweeu 0° and 30°, supposing al1 temperatures within these limits of equal frequency, is :+: 0·050mm. Jleuce it is coneluded that for such temperatures as are likely to be had in the use of these tapes, the proba,ble errors of their absolute lengths will not on the average exceed ± 0·05mm, or 1/2 000 OOOth part oft.heir length. (17) Practical form of equations of tapes.-For the purpose..s of computation it is n1ost convenient to cotnhiue the products of the mean tf·.mperatures by the rates of exparn.;ion in equations (7) and (8), of f'Section 14, with the mean excesses over 20B17 · Thus, making this combination, omitting the probable errors, and adding the numerical value of B 1., as given in Chapter n, section 23, we have

j:-;

a line in the Transcontinental Chain of Triangulation along or near the thirty-ninth parallel of latitude. It is situated nf'ar the village of Holton, Ripfoy County, I11d·. It is about 5 uoom Jong, and extends in a nearly north and south direction across what is known as the Crawfish Fla.ts. As will be inferred from this desig·nation, the ground along tlu· line is generally level, although a few rat.her abrupt changes in altitude are met in crossing the drainage courses. This base was located in 1890 by Assistant ~Iosman, who made a pr<·limiuary measure of its length with a 50rn tape the same year. Early hi the following summer Assistant :Mosman set the terminal and section stones of the base and provided all materials requisite to the measures made with the 1()()"' tapes. During August, 18Vl, the marking· and support stakes for the measureK with the long tapes, were set under the supervision of the writer_ The support stakes were set at equidistant intervals of lOm throughout the length of the line, exeept on the standard kilonietre 8eetion, where t.ltP microf:cope posts for the iced-bar appnratus rendered such stakes um1Pcessary. The tapes were supported on steel wire nails driven to th~ depth of· 2·5cin into the stakes. Since t~ese nails projected horizontally from the stak~s for a distance of about 12cm, no great precision .. was essential in placing the support stakes along the line. The rnarkin.g- ~takes, which fell loom apart, were aligned with considerable precision, and the support nails were placed at closely equal intervals of 10"' by the method explained in section 5, Chapter IV. (2) Measurements of the secUons of the base. -Since the tape apparatus Ui"ed was new and untried, except in the experiments of the Botanical Garden and in the comparisons on the 100 comparator, it was essential to a considerable extent to develop the methods of operation suitable to field measurement as the work progressed. At the same time tl1at. this work was under way, the work of tape comparisons, and the preparation for and measurement of the standard kilometre with the iced-bar apparatus, were also in progress; while the einployes of the pa.rty were often needed for otlier work conducted by Assistants Mosman and Tittmann. Hen<~e no attempt was inade to n1easure the wh~le base on a.ny one date; but the various sections were measured from tune to time as opportunities occurred. The earliest measures were

made -0n the section 5 OOOrn to 5 500m during the last days of Angm;t, 1891, and the work continued at intervalR until October S, 1891. The several sections were measured from six to thirty ti1nes each, the largest number of measures beiug made on the kilometre section, whose precise length was designed to give a thorough test of the effectiveness of tape apparatus. 1\fosj; of the measures of the sections were made at night, but a considerable number also were made during cloudy or partly cloudy days. Some of the latter were made under circnrnstances of wind, rain, and sunshine, ~Yhich would now be considered quite unfavorable; but since it was desired to learn as mueh as practicable in the allotted time concerning the behavior of tlrn tapes, a wide variety of circumstances was purposely en conn tered. In general, the measures were made by laying each tape l~ngth once as the work proceeded along a section. In a few cases, however, the experiment was tried of laying each tape leugth from two to five times and reading the thermometers as many times; and in order to make these measures independent, the rear end of the tape at starting was placed successively in coincidenl'e with marks a centin1etre apart. 'Ibis experiment served to give an idea of t!Je error in laying or placi11g a tape length. In all these measures but two thermometers were used, and these were read but once for each tape length. When a sufficient number of operatives were available tl1e thermometers were carried aud reml by observers who did naught else but assist in carryiug the tape. At other times the tbernwmeters were carried and read by the obsen-ers who fixed the ends of the tape. In the former case, the therrnomf'ters were held at arm's ]eugtb by ligl1t strings so that the bulbs were near to and at about the same height from the ground as the tape; while in the latter case the thermonrnters were suspended fr om a 11 ail or bradawl attached to a support. stake so as to fall in about the same relative position with re8pect to the tape as before. In both cases, the thermometers were placed at 2om fron1 the tape ends. The same thermometers used in the determinations of length of the tapes on the 1oom comparator were used also in the field measures, and the thermonwter corrections given in section 10, Chapter IV, were applied in computing the tape tlemperatures for tl1ese measures. In all measures of the sections of Holton Base, Mr. J. S. Siebert was the observer at the rear e1Hl of the tape and R. S. Woodward at the f'ront end. During the ea,rlier measures the temperatures were observed for the most part by Messrs. 0. H. Tittmann and J. F. Hayford. The records were kept by Messrs. HayforJ and Robert Penington.

The standard tension adopted iu all the base-line measures, as well as in all the determinations of the tape lengths on the lOOm comparator, is 25 pounds 9 ounces, this being the value of 7' when the balances are horizontal~ when they are free from index error, and when they read 25 pounds even. We are concerned here, then, only with the excess of the actual ovffr the observed or nominal tension in any case; but in order to show the data for these excesses, which apply to the tape comparisons as well as to the 1neasures of the sections of the base, we giYe the observed values of W, R, and r and the resulting values of ~ ( W - R + r) for both balances in full in Tables II and III following. The last column of these tables gives, also, the corresponding corn·etions to the standard length of the tape. These corrections are fouud by multiplying the excess of g.

It ·was used but little after this accident, although the computed correction due to it in this case could have given rise to no appreciable error.

The computation of the length of the standard kilometre from the da.ta given in the above table may be made as follows: The actual or working length of the tape T, say, may be most conveniently expressed in the form
' wherein A is the nominal length of the tape, a round number ot metres or lengths of some standard; a is a small excess over that nmud nun1ber; a is the rate of expansion of the ta,pe, and t is the tape's temperature in degrees centigrade. Then t~te sum of N such lengths, t being supposed t-0 vary from one length to another, will be

for the standard tension of 25 pounds 9 ounces. The tension in this case was 3·2 ounces in excess of the standard value, ancl hence the tape was, as explained in section 4 above, 0·16n>m longer than tl1e standard length just given. We have, therefore,

A=20B171 a = + 6·31mm + O·_l6mm = + 6·47mm, a = 1 ·0914mm, N=10. Likewise, from Table IV, the sum of the observed temperatures is 128·00°, aud the sum of the corrections to this for errors of the tliermorneters used is - 2·12°, as found from the table of thermometer corrections given in section 10, Chap'ter IV; so that there results

In this particular case a correction of - o-4rnn1 is to be added to the resulting length in order to refer it to tlie kilometre as measured with the iced-bar apparatus, the reference marks for the tape measures having been to that extent eccentric with respect to the terminal cut-off '" spheres.

Tape nteasures of Holton Base.
(7) Interpretation of results.-It is essential to a proper interpretation of the results in the above table to state certain additional information relative to the conditions under which the nrnasures were made. The day ineasures of September 3, 18~)1, were made during the afternoon of a day whose earlier part liad been hot and sultry. The field notes of the mea.sures of this day state that, although the sky was generally cloudy, tlle tape and thermometers '\Vere occa:sioually exposed to tlte direct rays of the sun. The measures of September 4 were Inade while a strong breeze, rising to a gale at intervals, was blowing This breeze, accompanied by more or less raiu, sufficed at time!S to blow the tape when under tension off its supports. l"or these reason~ the results of September 4 can not be regarded as at all trustworthy in comparison with results obtained under ordinarily favorable conditions. The day measureK of the standard kilometre of October 7 were made at a time of general cloudiness, but the tape and thermometers were exposed at intervals to direct sunshine. \Vhen the sun appeared on this date the measures were suspended until the clouds again cut off hiR rays, but in a numoor of cases the later measures of the set of five made on this occasion were not completed before the sun's heat was manifest in the thermometer readings. The night measures were made, in general, at times when dew was deposited to a greater or less extent in open fields. The only marked exception to this rule applies to the measures of the standard kilometre of September 23, 1891. The night of this day 'vas an unusually warm and dry one, and the wooded portion of the kilometre, which is about 600 1" long, had a notable store of radiant heat. The measures of the short section between the 4900m and 5000m stone of August 27 and 28, l 891, present a wide divergence from the later measures of the same section. These earlier measures wei·e the first made with the apparatus iu the field, and it was in laying this particular tape length that the operatives, with the exeeptiou of Siebert aud vVoodward, acquired their first experience. On these dates, aJso, a temporary and rather unstable marking table was used at the 4900 111 stone, pending the" preparation of a rigid post which served subsequently as a microscope post at the terminus of the standard kilometre, rrnd as a stable support for the marking table used in the tape measures of September and October. For these reasons the measures of Augnst :n and 28 must be regarded as untrustworthy iu comparison with the later measures of this short section. · All of the measures save those of August 27 and 28 and September 4~ a1luded to above, were made under favoraule conditions, it is believed, so far as the manipulation of the apparatus was concerned. \Vith these explanations in mind attention may now be called to a marked peculiarity exhibited by all the results of the day ineasures

except tha.t of August 27 of the short section 4900m to 5000m. .A glance at Table ·v showl'; that tho~e results are all small relatjvely to the results of the night measures save in the single instance noted. Di~ regarding those measures of August 27 and September 4, concerniug which tJ1ere are grave doubts as already explained, the discrepancy iu question is most marked in the results of A.ugust 27 and 31 (Section 5000rn to North Base), September 3 (Section 2100m to 3900 01 ) , and October 7 (Section 390()m to 4.900m). It appears, al:;;o, from tbe measures of August 31 (Section 5000m to North Uase), Septemoer 3 (Section l'..W0'" to 2100m), and October 3 (Section 3900m to 4H00'"), that this discrepa11l'Y disappears, or tends to do, so with the going down of the sun. The unexpected fact thus brought to light is that under the conditions presented by the dates cited, the thermometers gave a temperature too low for the tape by amounts ranging up to about a degree Centigrade at the maximum- How this fact is to be explained I am unable to say at present, but of its existence there can be no doubt. It is probabl.v due to the differing capacities of the tape and thermometers for absorp· tion and radiation under different conditions. In view of this peculiarity of the day measures it becomes essential to inquire carefully into the behavior of the tapes in the night measures during which the couditions as to radiation differed inuch less from those of the 100m comparator whereon the tape equations were detN· mined. The data for this inquiry are furnished by the measures with the tapes of the standard kilometre, whose length was determined with the iced bar, as explaiued in Chapter III, and we proceed to examiue these measures in detail in the following section. (8) Conclusion~ from tape measures of sta·ndard kilometre.-In order to give a clear idea of the performance of the tapes in the numerons ineasures of the standard kilometre, a summary of those measures is drawn up in Table VI following. The first column.of this table gives tbe date of a set or group of IUeasures; the second gives the liruiti1q.~, tJnies of the date within which the set of measures was made; the third gives the number of measures in the set; the fourth gives the mean of the results for length of the kilometre, and the last column gives the error of the 1nean length for any date, the true length of the }r:ilometre being assumed to be 200B17 + 0·2mm as found from the iced-bar measm·es and given in Chapter III, section 12. The results from the day measures are inclosed in square brackets:

It is clear from the result:;:,; iu this table that the errors of the night measures are small in con1pariso11 with tllose of the day measures. 'l'he mean of the night measures, giving weights to the taLular means proportional to the number of rci·mlts on which they depend. is 200B17 + O·()mm, which differs but o-2mm ti·om the value derived from the iced lmr measures. The n1axi1num error of any group inean from the night rnea:;:;ures is 3·2mm, or 1/300 OOOth part of the kilometre; aud the average error of such gronp means (disregarding weights) is only 1·6mm, or 1. 000 OOOth part of the kilometre. On the other hand, the day measures are largely in error and in one direction only, the maximum error of one group mean beh1g 1/100 OOOth part of the kilometre. It seems safe to conclude, therefore, fro1n these 1neasures of the ~tandard kilometre, that tlJC temperatures of the tapes when used at Hight in the open air were substantia1ly as well defined by the mercurial thermometers as when used under the shed of the 1 oom cmnparator· .'.\loreover, this conclusion is substantiated so far as it can be by the evidence afforded by the measures of the other sections of the base, which do not present a siugle wel1-defined exception to tbe rule that the day measures are relatively· sl1ort. lu accord.a.nee with this eonclusion, we Rhall use the uight measures only in deriving tlte adopted mean lengths of the several sectiotJS of the base. It may be observed, liowever, that auother method, which does not require the rejection of the da.y rnea.-.;ures, is available fi)r the determination of the mean lengths of those :o;ections. This method consists in deriving the working lengths of the tapes for the day measures from the day measures of the standard kilometre whose length WaR measured precisely with the iced-bar apparatus. A glance at the data shown in Table V makes it apparent that this method would bring the day measures into close agreement with the night measures of any section. The computation accordh1g to this method bas been made, and the resulting mean lengths of the sections will be given below.

446

It will be remarked, also, that the numer01,,1s night measures of the standard kilometre afford ~mfficient data for a good determinatiou of the equations of the tapes, especiallyf'or tape No. 88, since the temperature range for it in tl1e kilometre n1easnres is about 1.JO C. But, as sho,vn above, tlie equations of the tapes derived fro1n observations 011 the 100°' comparator are in so close accord with those data that therf:' is no need of appealing to them for snppleinentary informatioll coneeruing the equations of the tapes for the night work. Finally. attention may he called to tbe substantial agreement with each other and with the trne value ot· tlle nieans of the night measures of the standard kilometre from the two tapes. These means are 200B 17 + 0·9mm for tape No. 85 and 200B 1, - 0·2mrn for tape No. 88. 'l'lw actual errors of these measures are thus, with respect to the iced bar value (200B1 , + 0·2rnm), only + o.7mm and - o-4mm, which are in each case lesR than the mi11ionth part of the length of the line. (9) Melln va1ues of lengths of .<?ection.~ of bar:;e.-_.A_s stated in the preceding section, the lengths 'ye shall adopt for the sections of the ba:-:.e wi11 be made to depe11d on the night measures only, for the reason tlJat thest· were made under circumstances closely compa.rab1e with thos<> whicli obtained on the lOOm comparator in <leterinining the e.f1nations of the tapes. It will be of interest,, however. to see to what extent the mean lengths of the sections and the length of the whole base wonl<l be affected if the day nieasnres were incJnded and given equal weight along ·with the night measures. I...1ikewise, it will be instructive to lenrn tbe effect of tbe inclusion of the results of the day measures wheu computed by means of working lengths of the tapes de.rived from the day measures of the standard kilometre. Accordingly, tl1e values wliieli result. from each of these three suppositions are given in Table VJI following. The data for this table are derived from Table V. The fir...-t column designates the section of the ba:-;e. The second column giY(·s the nlean length of the seetion derived from the night measures alone. th~se being considered of equal weight. The third column gives tlie mean length of the section derived by considering all day and night measures of the same weight. The fourth column gives the mean by equal weights of all measures of a section after the day measures haYe · been increased by o-74mm per tape length. The results of August 27 and 28 for the short section 4 900m to 5 OOOm and those of September 4 for the sections South Ba.se to 3 OOOm are, however, excluded in the first and third of the~e computations for the reasons given in section 8. The correction 0·7 4run· per tape length is a mean of the correction~ furnished by the kilometre measures of October 3 and 7. A mdre precise value might be derived, it is believed, by making such correction depend on the time of day, since the evidence indicatei:; that the error in question was due to solar radiation; but the data are insufficient to justify such a degree of refinement.

It will be observed that the meaus in t.he third column of this table an· in e\~ery ca.:se smaller thau the corresponding vahu~s in the second column, so that there ca11 be no doubt of the wide divergence of the

day measures from the night n1easures obtained with the apparatus as used on the Holton Base. The total length of the base found by including the day n1easures is 17·0mm !Shorter than that found by excluding them. This atnounts to 1./325 OOOth part of the length of the ba~e. This total length, however, is affected to a marked extent by tht\ 1neasures of September 4, made during rain and \Vind as already es11lajned. These adverse circnmstarn_'.eH afford sufficient reason for the re.i1cction of those rueasures; but it is proper to explain that the general effect of the winll on this {late was to increase the distance between tlie tenninal marks of the tape, and hence to ma.ke the resulting compntefl lP>I1gths of the sections mea:-::nred too small. Thh; arose from the fad that the wind blew briskly from a northerly direction, or nearly in tltt' (1irection of tl~e base, and lumee it tended to straighten and thus in('n·ase the working length of the tape, just as a strong breeze tends to t':.tra ig;ht.en a string attached to a fixed poiut at one end or to render it Parnlle.J to the direction of the current, w1licl1 is in g-eut·ral horizontal. The maxi1uum increase which such a cause conld prodnce in the distance between the terminal marks of the tap~ as used is·1·55m·.u. This increase is much greater, of course, than a11y which is likely, but it set·tus probable that a quite appreciable fraction of that amount per tape length entered as an actual error into the 1neasures of the date in q lH_>Htion. A:-- to the results in the last column. in Table VII. it may be said that their agreement with those of the second column is fairly satisfactory. appears, however, that the day measures are not sufficiently

classes: (l) Errors of manipulation, or errors incident to the mere operation of placing or laying a tape length. They include errors due to lack of coincidence of the terminal marks of the tape with the defi11ing marks on the zinc or other marking plates, errors due to incorre<"t tension of the tape, errors due to friction of the tape on its supports, and errors due to defective alignment of the tape. (2) Temperature errors. 'l'hese include all errors tending to give incorrect te1nperatures to the tape, except such constant errors of the thermometers as may affect all 1neasnres alike. Uelatively, the second class of errors is by far the most formidable, since they tend at times toward the constant type of errors, but it. i;,; important also to give such information as is available with respect to the minor source. Accordingly we shall endeavor to separate the two classes of error. It 1nay be remarked that the errors of manipulation enumerakd above are all of the con1peusating sort, except that due to clefectiYe alignment of tlie tape. This error must, however, be "·ery small, sim·e flipping the tape when under tensio11 tends to make it perfoctly straight on lts supports. Even if the udddle of a 1oom tape lay one decimetre to one side of the straight line joining its ends (an error of alignnH'nt which may be regarded as hnposF.il>fo) the resulting length would be in error only 0·2 111 m; so tl1at, errorR of this kind, it is believed, are absolutely negligible. It appears from an inspection of the 1-esults in Table V, especially those for the length of the standard kilometre, that any set of 1nea:o;.ul'es of a section made within a short interval of iime was affected by more or less persif.;;tent temperature errors. This is, as already exp1ai1wd, very 1narked in the case of the da.y nieasures as cmnpared with the night measures; hnt the latte1' exhibit al~o some traces of the ~arne sort of error, whieh arises, it is thought, fro1n the rela,tively constant conditions of ra<liatio11 pertaining to any short line during a limited period of time. The full range of the resultant error of measurement, therefore, can be expected to appear only in numerous measures of a section made under widely varying conditions. Measures satisfying this requirement were made on the standard kilometre. The various measures of t11e other sections of the base, when taken as a whole, satisfy the requirement also, and we thus have two independent :--cts of data for determining the aggregate probable error of measurement of a section. In computing this error we shall consider the night measures only, since they alone, as shown by the measures of the standard kilometre, conform to the adopted equations of the tapes, and they alone are used in deriving the adopted length of the base. The standard kilometre was so accurately known from the iced bar measures of it that the discrepancies shown by the tape measures maY be treated a.s actual errors, and, other things equal, as affording tbO

On the. other hand. if we cousid.er all the night 1neasnres of the several sections, iucludiug the standard kilonwtre (but excluding the ~hort sectiou of lOOm for the reason that one tape length does not afford an opportunity for the development of the errors iu question), there are in all 4G measures of 6 sectio11s. '.I'hese sections vary in length from 5ooiu to 1,2oom, and hence it is essential to have recourse to weights in order to derive the probable error of one 1neasure of a kilouH.~tre. ~1.ssumiug that the resultant error desirell is of the eompensating class, tlw weights of the different sections will va1·y inversely as their lengths; aud if we call the weight of one measure of a kilometre 1, the weight of one measure of a section n tape lengths long (nlOOm) will be 10/n. Iii order to exhibit the data furnisbed by the several sections for the probable error desired, the details are brought together in Table VIII f)(·low.

This, it will be seen, is slightly larger than the value derived from the kilometre measu'1·es alone. Now, by means o:f this valne and the data afforded uy the determi11a.tious of the tape lengths on the lOOm comparator, it is possible to derive an estimate of the maguitude of the error due to manipulation. By reference to Chapter IV, section 14, it is seen that the error of ont' determination of a tape length on the comparator was ± 0·20mm, and this is due almost wholly to error in the assigned temperature from rhe mean of six therrnorneter readings. Assu1ning that the ten1perature errors were no greater in field work than on the comparator, the probable error of one tape length from the mean of two in place of six thermometer readings should be :±:- 0·20mrn v3; and heuce the probable error in the length of a kilometre, or the sum of 10 tape lengths, shoul<l be ± 0·20mm v30 = ± 1-Imrn. Since the probable error of measurement due to all 8ources of error was tonnd abov-e to be ± 1 ·7"" at mrn;;;t, we in:fer that the probable error due to errors of n1auipulation in one measure of a kilometre is

It appears, then, that the prolmble errors due to the two classes of error (error of manipulation and error of temperature) were about eqnal in the case ot· the night 1neasures of Holton Base. Son1e doubt nrny he entertained as to the correctness of the above estimate of ± 1 ·lmm for the probable error due to ten1perature errors. Subsequent experiern·c, on St. Albans Base, in 18H2, unde.r somewhat different conditions, as explained in sections 20-27 below, does not confirm this estimate, bnt seems to show conchudvely that the error of operation is quite negligihJe in comparison with that of the ten1perature.

It will be observed that the probable error8 i11 the last two columns of the above table agree fairly well, and thus .iu:-;tit\ tlte assumption that the errors of mea.sure1nent with the tape apparatut> are of the con1pcusatiug sort, or tllat the aggregate error of measnrernent increases as the square root of the distance measured. \Ve conclude, also~ that tlw probable errors (2) are, on the 'vhole, the more tn1:-i,hvorthy, since they are not unduly affected by the exce~sively large or the excessively 8Bia11 errors which appear in the measures of some of the sections. The probable error of laying a single tape length, as shown by the proeess (2), is ::I:: O·;:J24mm. Hence the probable error of one 1neasure of a kilometre is, by this process,

It remains to consider the possible effects of errors of grades and alignment. These errors, though quite negligil,le iu the length of a ~ingle section, may yet rise to an appreciable quantity in the. length of the \Vhole base. As to errors in grade corrections, it will be observed that they are of the comperrnating class, since errors iu determiuing the differences iu altitude of consecutive marking tables are as likely to be of one sign as another. The grade correction c for any tape lengtb, as explained iu section 3, is given by h2

For a constant value of .Jh, therefore, the value Jc will vary as h. The value of h for the tape lengths on Holton Base was 1 ·72m, giving rise to a value of 14-79mm for c. Since the values of h were measured by two different observers at different times, and since all (liscrepant values were redetermined, it seems impossible that an error a:-; great as 2cm could have entered any adopted h. In the case of the al.Joye maximum value of h, the error in c due to an error .dh = 2cm would be .de= (14·79mm) x 4/172 = o-34mm.
The average vaJue of h for the base was less than 0·4m, so t.J1at the average correction for grade was thus less than O·smm per tape length. U ence, since the errors under consideration are of the compensating ~ort~ it is believed that their aggregate effect on the whole line was inappreciable. Errors of alignment in tape measures may manifest themselves in two ways. In the first place, the tape as stretched from length to length may not be parallel to the base. A lack of parallelism with the base to the extent of a decimetre iu the length of a tape 1oom long W-onld give rise to an error of 0·05mm. Similarly, any departure of the tape from a vertical plane through its ends won.Id give rise to an error of the same sort and sign. In the second place, any imperfections in the alignment of the support nails to a uniform slope for any tape

length would also produce a cumulative error. Both of theRe align ment errors make the measured length of' the base too great. Both errors are, ho-wever, very small. .A.n error as great as 0·2nnn from crookeduess of the tape with respect to a vertical plane through its ends i::;, it is thought, of very rare occurrence. Errors (lue to defects in setting the support nails to a uniforin grade must be smaller per tape leng·fo tlian the former and of sti11 rarer occurrence. The 1uetlwd of setting the support nails is so easy and accurate that au error in position as great as 1 cm can arise only through accidents or blunders. Not.withstanding the indications that the errors in grades and alignment are negligible, we shall attribute ± 1 mm as a probable error to each of these sources, since it is possible that so1ne blunders occuned in this first aJ)plication of the method and apparatus. ith respect to the two errors of1neasnreinent, :±: 1 ·99mm and± l·G;i" given above, we shall adopt the larger, in order that the precision nwy be underestimated rather than overestimated.

B.-ST. ALBANS BASE MEASUREMENT.

(l5) Location of base and preparation for uwwmrenwnt.-St. Albans

base is a line in the transcontinental chain of triangulation along or uear the tl1irty-ninth parallel of latitude. It is situated in the valley of the Great Kanawha river, near the village of St. Albans, Kanawha County, 'Yest Virginia. lt is about 3 900"' long, and extends in a liearly east and west direction along a closely level po1·tion of the vall1 ~y. It is on the north side of and is parallel to the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, the west end being 17·Sm and the east end 18·4m from the nearest rail of the main track in 1892. This base was located in the summer of 1891 by Sub-Assistant \Yalter B. Fairfield. The terminal marking stones were provided and Het under the direction of Assistant .1\Iosman during the autumn of the sa.me year. A profile of the line and a determination of its height with respect to an adjacent triangulation station of known height were also made under Assistant l\1osman's direction by Mr. J. S. ::)iebert. ~rhis base was measured with the tape apparatus in the early part of October, 1892, by a party in charge of the writer, aided by Assistant E. E. Haskel1, Recorders 1\I. V. Saflord and Orville G. Brown. The line was cleared of brush, brambles, grass, and other obstacles, and the marking and support stakes for the tapes were set during the days October 1-9, 1892. These stakes were set iom apart, and the iuarking stakes were all carefully aligned with a theodolite. Special pains were also takeu in this work to make the spacing of the support nails uniform and to bring them accurately into coincidence with the 1ine of slope for any tape length. Some special provision had to be made for supporting the tapes at an elevation of 3m to 5m for two tape lengths where the line crossed a ravine. But the supports for these t,wo tape lengths were no less stable than at other parts of the line, n11<l no difficulty was met in handling the tapes successfully at such altitudes. (16) ~£easurements of the base.-A measure of the base was made during the afternoon of October 10 with the 1oorn steel tape No. 85 in

order to afford practice iu manipulating the apparatus to the operatiyes, all of whom, except the writer, had had no experience with the apparatus. In this practice measure no record was kept of the set-up8. and some tape lengths were omitted, so that no results can be derived from it. The work of actual measurement was begun on October 11 a11d continued until October 14. Two measures of the base, one in each direction, were made at night witl1 eacl1 of tl1e steel tapes Nos. 8;3 and 88; and a daytime measure, in bright sunshiue 7 was made with tape No. 88. In all the 1ncasures, l\Ir. E. E. 1:-Iaskell was the observer at the rear enu of the tape a1Hl l\fr. H.. S. vVoodward t11e observer at tbe front end. Tile thermo1neters from which the tape temperature was in:ferred were also read by these observers. An additional ther1nometer with a bright bulb, as explained more fully below, was read at the middle of the tape by J\fr. J\L "V. Safford, who also attended to the operati011 of flipping tbe tape and assisted in carrying it forward. The records were kept by 1\ilr. Orville G. Brown. The whole number of operatives employed in the work was ten. The base 'vas divided into four sections. These were all nearly one kilometre in length, except the easternmost one, which was about 86flm. The fractional part of a tape lengtb, uameJy, 69m, in tbis latter case, was measured on the tape when under the usual tension; 60m of this fraction (or, rather, three-fifths of a tape leugth) was obtained directly from the 2om sub-spaces on the tapes, while the remaining portion of um, a bout, was measured by rneans of an auxiliary 15m Chesterman steel tape divided to millimetres. The particular portion of the latter tape used was tested on the Mural Standard of the Survey on returning from the field, and found to accord sufficiently well with its nominal value. The whole fraction of a tape length (69m about) was on each occasion fixed on the tape by means of a light transverse line ruled with a brad awl. Tbe distance between the 60rn mark on the tape and the temporary line was measured in each case with the auxiliary tape immediately aft.er ruling this line, but as an additional check the same distance was remeasured in the daytime, so that it is practically certain that no appreciable error enters this fractional part of a tape length. The i-;everal positions of the tapes were marked on zinc }Jlates which were left in position until the work was completed, when they were numbered, oriented, and filed as part of the recor~. The "set-ups'' and "set-backs" made were measured and recorded at the time, but they were all carefully remeasured by daylight, so that no appreciable errors from this source can enter the measures. The measureR were referred directly: to the terminal marks in the monuments at the ends of the base and to the marking plates at the intermediate ends of the sections. These plates were nailed to very stable stakes, and there was no indication of any appreciable move1uents of them during the short period of four days oovered by the

measures. Any such movmnents, however, which might take place from day to day would not afiect tlic intervaJ between the terminal stones, since the base was 1neasured continuously from end to end whenever any measurement was ina(~e. (17) Determina,tion of grade corrections.-The differences in altitude of the consecutive marking tables were measured independently by .:\fessrs. Haskell and Safford. \Vlienever auy dil'>crepancies appeared, the work was re-examined by them, and it is believed that the adopted differences are trustworthy within half a centimetre in evt·.ry case, ,,~bile the two largest of those differences were determined with a much gTeater precision. The maximum difference in height of the tables for any tape length "~as 3·571m, which gives a grade correction of G3·7Gmrn. The average difference in heigl1t per tape length for the several sections countiug from the west end were 0·37rn, 0·89m, 0·29m 1 and 0·18rn. The grade corrections were computed in duplicate by :l\iessrs. Safford and Woodward, and the following are the resulting values for the several sections:

(18) Determinations of tape temperatures.-Mercurial thermometers
of the same sort as those used on Holton Base 'vere used to give the tape temperatures in the measureuwut of St. Albans Base. But in the l1ope that the thermometers cou1d be made to follow the tape tempera-

tures with greater certainty the aluminum sheaths used in the IIolton work were replaced by steel sheaths. These were made of very thin Rteel tape which was coiled into cy1inders just long and large enough tn slip over the thermometer bulbs and clasp t11eir stems. By annealing, the surface of these coils was given a dull black color closely resembling that of the measuring tapes. A. disadvantage, however, of these steel sheaths over the aluminum oues lies iu their greater mass, whieh is about 0·50 grammes, and is about three times the mass of tlte aluminum sheaths. This increase in mass caused a notable lagging of the thermometers with respect to the tapes, whereas such lagging was very small when the lighter sheaths were used. The effects of this lagging, however, appear to have been well eliminated by the process of measurement adopted. ·with the hope, also, that some light might be shed on the obscure question of the persistent diff~rence between the tape and the therniometrie temperatures during the day measures of Holton Base, a. thermometer with no sheath attached to it (or one with bright inRtead

of black bulb) was read in all the measures of St. Albans Base. The salient result revealed by this experiment is that during the daytime the thermometers with black bulbs (or sheaths) read uniformly higher and at night uniformly lower than the therrnometer with the bright bulb. This fact confirms what might be, of course, expected, namely~ that the tape and thermoineters· n1ay have persistently differing temperatures unless they have the same capacity for absorption and radiation. Another result of this experiment which may prove of value in further studies with the tapes is that the period when thermonieter.-; with bright and black bulbs give the sa1ne readings occurs shortly before sundown, and appears to coincide with the period of steady atmosphere.· But aside from. these results, interesting though they l·e in a general way, nothing came from the use of the therinmneter ·with the bright bulb. The temperature of the tape was inferred altogetlier :from the readings of the two thern1ometers supplied with the ~tee] sheaths. That the latter gave temperatures closely coincident with those of the tapes, except for the lag effect, wbicb waR in general \H·1l eliminated, appears to be demonstrated by the results of the seYeral measures of the four 8ections of the base. The therm01neters used in an work on St. Albans Uase were Nos. 5598, 5620. and 5621 by Green. Table X following gives the conl'ctions to be applied to the readings of these ther1nometers to bring t11em into accordance with the standard l1ydrogcn scale. The correction~ to 5598 are those given in section 10, Chapter IV, the freezing point reading adopted being that of .January 21, 1892. The freezing point readings of 5620 and 5621 were deterinined by 1\-Ir. Louis A. Fischer, of the office of Standard Weights and Measures, in September, 1892.

(21) Interpretation of results.-An inspection of the results i11 t11e above table shows the ranges amongst the individual measures of the several sections to be 13·7 111 m, 3-omm, 10·0111 m, and 11 ·6mm, respectively; and the question which im.mediately suggests it.self is, why should the range for the section stake 10 to stake 20 be so much less than for the other sections T The l1ypothesis we offer in answer to this 9uestion aft(n·ds a satisfactory explanation of the ranges just mentioned, espe· cially those of the night measures, and clears up some of the peculiarities noted in the measures of Holton Base. It is based on the following

considerations :

1..7ape measures of St. Albans Base.
In case there is any relative lagging of the tape and thermometric teinperatures, its effect will be more or less eliminated in the mean of two measures of a section made the one nuder a rising and the other under a falling temperature. A similar elimination of the lag effect ·will occur in a single measure of a section if the temperature is rising· for one-half and falling for the other half of the measure; aud, iu general, the lag effect will tend to eliminate itself if the temperature tluctuates to any considerable extent about its mean trend. The cou<litions which obtained during the measures of St. Albans llase, so far a;.; they pertain to this lag effect are, in genera.I, well indicated by the data in the fifth and sixth columns of the above table; but it should be stated that the section stake 10 to stake 20 vras specially favorable by reason of its topographic couforrnation for eliminating the lag effect. The middle portion of this section was on low marshy ground compared with the ground at either of its ends, so that there was always a marked fol] of temperature on a.pproachi11g the low gTound and a marked rise OH leaving it, regardless of the direction of mea~urement. This answer, it 111ay be couceued, explains the small range among the results for the section stake 10 ·to stake 20; but if it is the correct auHwer, we should expect the means of the forward and backward measures of the other sections to show a similar degree of accordance~ since, as shown in the sixth column of the table, the temperature gradient was in general reversed with a reversal of the direction of measurement. The two night measures with each tape a1·e in this reHpect strictly comparable, since they were nu"tde u11der emHlitions in all respects similar; i. e. the sky was cloudless or uearly so, there was little or no wind, tbe preceding days had been very u1uch alike, and the ineasures were rnade at tiines when dew was condensing along inost parts of the line. That these means do so accord is shown by the H'.~ults in Table XII following, which gives the means of· the night na~asures of the sections made with the two tapes. For brevity the seetions are numbered 1, 2, 3 1 4, respectively:

The accordance of these results leaves little to be desired; but for the
reasons already adduced and for others given below, it is difficult to see how it can be otherwise than real. Although the fact that means of forward and backward measures of

a section indicated a marked elimination of son1e source of error wa~ noticed in certaiu of the 1neasures of H o1ton Base, the explanation of that fact, presented above, did not occur to me until after the night measures of St. Albans Base had been made. The full import of the exp1anation, indeed, was not appreciated until after the day measure of October 14 had been made; otherwise a reverse inea~mre of the line would l1ave been rnade on the latter day. , The particular measures of Holton Base just referred to are those of sections 2 100"' to 3 OOOm and 3 ooom to 3 900"'. On referriug to Table V of section 7 it will be seen that each of these sections was n1easnrcd in both directions on September 18 and again on September 19, 1891, under conditions favorable for the eliminatiou of the lag effect. The excesses over 180B 17 of the means of the forward aud backward measures of the section 2 1oorn to 3 OOOm for these two days are + 71·2 1nrn and + 70-7nrn·; and for the seci.lion 3 OOOm to 3 900m the eorresponding excesses are + 20·4mm and + ~O·omm. Tbest>: exhibit a degree of accordance equal to that shown - in Table XII. A similar degree of accordance is shown in the forwanl and backward measures of the standard kilometre of Holton Base of September 30, October L and October 8, 1891, ou which dates the temperature gradients were favorable to the elimination of the lag effect. Attention has also been called in section 11 to the fact that the measures of the standard kilometre show a less probable error than tlw measures o:f the other sections of Holton Rase. The reason for this i~ found, I believe, in the topographic conformation of that kilometre. It passed for 600m of its length througl1 a dense forest, leaving 2oom at eiflier end in open fields. In nearly all the night mea:;mres the thermometer readings show a rise of temperature on passiug from the open fields to the forest, and vice versa; which conditions, as explai1wd above, were favorable for the elimination of the lag effect in a siugle measure of the line. To recur to the nieasures of St. Albans Base, it is seen from the results in Tables XI and XII that the largest discrepancies are found iu every case whe,re, according to the hypothesis considered, they woulil be expected to appear. Thus, in Table XI the range is greatest in tlti> measures of the section West Base to stake 10, which presented tlie steepest temperature gradients; and in Table XII the range is greate:-;t in the case of the third section, which_, as appears from the data in tlie sixth column of Table XI, presented the least favorable temperature gradients. It sboulfl be noted, howe~r, t11at the difference between the night measures of the section West Base to stake 10 with tape· No. 88 is much gi·eater than that between the night measures with tape No. 85. The temperature gradients, in fact, indicate that the former differenct· ought to exceed the latter, but it is not clear that the excess should b(~ as great as it is. This apparent anomaly has le.d to a. compari~on ot the separate tape lengths of the night measures of this first section

v>ith the two tapes. It shows that the measures with tape No. 88 were for every tape length apparently longer in the one case and shorter iu the other by about o-7mm; in other words, if we are dealing with a lag effect, the tbernwmeters gave a temperature too high to the tape under a falliug gradient and too low under a rising gradient by about 00.7 C., and this error was persistent throng-ltout both 1neasures of the section. Attention has been called in Chapter rv, section 15, to a similar diserepancy in the behavior of ther-;e two tapes when placed alongside of oue another on the lOOm comparator of Holton Base. It is most probably due, as suggested in the section just referred to, to some difference in the emissidties of the two tapes, but a study of all the data lias not up to the present time led me to auy clearer vie''T of the question. Jt remaius to consider the results of the day measure of the base of October 14, 189~. This was made on a cloudless day between 2 :53 and ~ :2G p. m., and the mean temperatures for the several sections varied from 320·11 C. to 290.go C. Including this measure, the mean temperatures of the tape ranged for the different day an<l night measures of Pach section through nearly 250 C.; so that the aecordance of the day measures with the mean of the night 1neasures affords a pretty severe test of the equations of the tapes and of the ther1nometeric temperahues attributed to them. A glance at the data in the sixth aud sevPuth columns of Table XI shows that the accordance of the day measure is best, as it ought to be in conformity with the considerations adduced above, in the case of the :first and second sections, and worst, a~ would be expected, in the case of the last two sections.* 'rhe differences between the <lay measures of the several sections and the means of the night measures of the same are

The average of these regardless of sign is tH)rnrn, or 1/200 OOOth of a section; while the average of the first two of them, which must be largely free from the lag effect, is only 2·4 111 rn, or 1/400 OOOt.h part of a section. From any point of view these discrepaucieH, when we bear in mind the wide range of teuqlerature involved, do not seem large; but When we consider them iu connection with the temperature gradients '"liich obtained during the day measure, it appears clear that, except

for the lag effect, the thermometers as fitited with the steel shields gave temperatures in very close agreeinent with those of the tapes duriI1g both the day and the night measures of the base. Briefly summarized, then, our interpretation of the results of the measures of St. Albans Base is that the rr1ost formidable errors to which they were subjeet arose from lag of the thennometers as fitted with the steel shields; that these errors were well eliminated in tlie means of the forward and backward night 1neasures with either tape for all sections, and well eliminated in all the individual n1easnres of the second section by reason of its topographic conformation; arnl finally, that the result of the day measure is too great by reasou of uncompensated lag effect which lies chiefly in the lengths of the two easternmost sections of· the base.

Accordingly, the value we adopt is

fn eomputjng the probable error of measureme11t from tlte data :itlbrded by r.rables XI and XII, we-· may proceed ac<'ording: to several h;q)otheses. TJising 1 kilometre as the unit of distance to which :-;uch probable error refers, we may assume (a) that all of the night and day measures of the seYeral sections of the base are of equal weigbL and that no elimination of systematic error results in the mea11 of a forward <llld backward measure; (b) that the night measures should be cousidf'1·ed by themselves and treated as if they involved no errors due to lagg·ing of t,be thermometers: (c) that the means of the forward a11d backward measures given in Table XII are more or less free from error"' dne to lagging, and that such means are alone competent to give an i(lea of the attainable precisiou. The errors which result from each of these hypotheKt'K will now he g·iven.

It may be observed that if the meau values in Table No. V, from which E" is derived, are not to a marked extent free fro1n systematic error, as is assumed, w<~ should l1ave by the theory of errors

But the actual relation is Ee= 0·32Eb, or the ratio of the two errors ii; less than half as great as it should be if the hypothesis (c) were f'a1~e. It 1nay be observed, a.lso, that the work of determining the ta1w lengths on the 100 comparator of Holton Base affords an indirt>et n1eans of estimating the extent of the temperature error involved i11 the n1ean of a forward and backward measure of a kilometre_; and henee some additional light may be gained concerning the magnitude of the error of n1anipulation, which latter, a.s revealed in the tape measure:-. of 1-Ioltou Base, was briefly discussed in section 10 above. As sho1Y11 iu Chapter IV, section 15, the probable error of" a single determination of a tape length on the lOOm coIJ1parator was ± 0·20 111 m. This, as explai11ed in the chapter referred to, is due almost wholly to temperature error::; in the mean of six. thermometer readings. It involves the lag effect to a slight extent, and hence ought to indicate a larger temperature corn· ponent in the probable error of a mean measure of· a section of St. Albans Base than that shown from the actual observations, if in the~e latter the lag effect was well e1in1inated. Assuming the above error of ± 0·2()mm per tape length to apply to the field work jf six thermonwte.r readiugs were 1nade, the value for the actual ca,se, wherein but two such readings were observed, is ± 0·20mm v 3. vVith this as the iwohable error per tape length, the probable error of the su1n of ten t-:neh lengths is ± 0·20mm -/30, and hence that for the m.ean of two such measures is
111

This is slightly greater than the value of Ee given above. It shows, f'n far as it goes, a satisfactory elimination of' the lag effect in the mean:-: of the forward and backward measures of the sections of St. AJhan:-: Ba8e, and indicates that the error of manipulation is really mueh kss than was inferred in section 10 frorn the measures of Holton Base aloue. Lastly, it should be remarked that the value E,, =::I::: 2·33 11l 111 , deriYed by URing the night measures of St. Albans Base, is considerably Ian.!·"'r than the corresponding value deduced from the night measure~ of Holton Base, namely, ± 1-74nrn·, g·iven in section 10 above. The nwiu reason for this lies, undoubtedly, in the fact that the steel sheaths u;-;ed on the bulbs of.the thermometers in 1892 caused much greater lag·_g1ng' than the aluminum sheaths used in 1891. The exceptionally fa.voni l>le conditions of the standard kilometre of Holton Base for eliminntiug the lag effect have been alluded to in the preceding section, and this circumstance also tended to make the probable error of a single measµre of a kilo1uetre in the Holton work sniall~

Now as to probable error due to errors of n1easurement in the whole length of St. Albans base, three values dependent on the suppositious (a), (b), (c), may be derived; and a fourth value may be computed from the difference between the mean lengths for the whole base from the night measures with the two tapes. The latter process, it will be noted, should give the smallest probable error, since it does not involve tlJe posiodble errors due to 111ovemeuts of the inr,ermediate section stake.<::., though such movements, it is belie·ved, were very small.

In eomparison with these, the errors in grade corrections~ i11 alignmt_-mt, 111 transfers to permanent marks, and in the measurement. of fractious of tape lengths, are trifling-. As already explained, special pains were taken in the alignment of the support and marking stake~ and in the determination of grade corrections. \Ve may allow, however, for possible coui ributions of error from the latter sourees hy adopting ± 2·0mm as the p1·obable error of 1i1easurernt--':11t. 'l'hii.;, it will be observed, is but little less than that given by supposition (b), which takes uo accouut of the dimination of the Jag· effect, and would appear to materially underf'l.:;timate the precision actuall;\· attained. (23) Probable error of ba,se due to errors of tape lengthx.-Frou1 the t'\'idence adduced in Chapter IV, seetion 1(), it appears that tlw probable errors of the tape length:-; as determined on the 1oom comparator of Holton Base can not exceed :± O·O[)mm within such ranges of temperature as are likeJy to be met in ordinary ·work. For such temperatures as obtained during the night measures of St. Albans Base, the probable error per tape Jength, if computed from the formula given in the ~Pction of Chapter IV just reforred to, would b~ somewl1at less than ::l:: 0·05mm. One circumstance, however, leads me to adopt a larger Yalue. It is this: If we use the mean lengths of the sections of St. A I bans ,Base given in Table XII to com put~ a correction to the differf'ttce in lengths of the tapes at oo C., the 111ean value of such correct.ion is found to be ::I:: O·OH11" " ± o.095mm, indicating that the differe11ce in length of the tapes at oo C. should be 2-~uuu iustead of 2-45mm, as

given by the equations of the tapes derived in Chapter IV. Subsequently to the measurement of St. Albans Base the tapes were compared directly on a 1oom section of the base. ~.o\.n account of thi~ work is given in section 26 below. It indicates a correction to tbt· difference of the tapes at 0° C. of about the same amount as that j"ast. mentioned and with somewhat greater certainty. The amount of this discrepancy, it will be observed, is of about the same magnitude as its probable error derived from the .expression (9), section 16, Chapter rv·, namely: -V(0·055mm)2 + (O:o5·gmn1)2 = ± O·o8m'", so that no great weight can be attached to it when considered hy itself. But inasmuch as the lengths of the tapes ·'""'ere detern1ined by observing on them with micrometer microscopes having a power of 27 diameters, while in applying them to measure a base a hand magnifier or the unaided eye is used, it is possible thatj some constant error n1ay have thus entered the llleasures of St. Albans Base. :F'or t.hi~ reason the extreme value of ± 0·06mm wiH be taken for the probabll· error of the tape lengths in those measures. rrhis, as shown in seetiou 16, Cl1apter TV, js the probable error of the tape lengths given h.v their equations for such temperatures as 0° and 30° C. Since there were 38·7 t.ape lengths in the base, the probable error of ± 0·06mm per tape length gives ± 2·32m.m as the probable error of t11e whole base due to this source. (24) Corrections to measured length of basc.-To the adopted mean length of the base given in section 22 above, three corrections ar(\ t~) be applied, namely: (1 ), correction for grades; (2), correction for error in thermometer corrections used in the computation of the 1engths of the sections of the base; (3), reduction to sea level. (1) Since the entire length only of the base is needed, tlie sum of the grade corrections may be applied to the adopted measured Jeugtb given in section 22. This sum, the tenns of wbicb are given in section 16, is - 112·7rn 111 · (2) The thermometer correction15 which should have been applied i 11 eomputn1g the length of the base are those given in rrable X, section 17. The means of the corrections to Nos. 5·398 and 5620, whfoh alotw were used to give the tape temperature!'\, vary from - 0°·135 to -OO·l 75, giving thus a practically constant value of - 0°·155, whfrh we adopt as the correction to be applietl to the n.1eanl':I> of those ther, mometer readings fbr the entire work. The corrections actually applied in computing the lengths of the sections of the base were, h.v reason of an error in making up a table of corrections, all numerica11.v. larger than those by the foUowing amounts for tbe several sections of the base counting from the west end: First section, ou-028, Second section, O ·02:!, 'l'hird section, O ·021, :Fourth section, 0 ·O!H.

(26) .Results of special experiments with tape.'l on 8t. Albans Ba,.'le.After the measure1nents· of St. Albans Base were completed, certain experiments with the tapes were 1uade· with a view, first, to redetermine their relative lei1gths; and second, to learn 1nore of their behavior under varying temperature conditions. Incidentally, also, the questions of friction of the tape on itR supports and its elongation for sma11 increments to the normal tension, were reexamined. For these purposes, a tape length of the base presenting average conditions was selected and used as a comparator. In place of tlw IDarking stakes for this tape length, well seasoned wooden posts wel't' set firmly in the ground. On one of these posts a, zinc plate having a fine reference line ruled ou it was fastened. On the other post a beav;v brass plate carrying an ivory scale 5cm long divided to half millimetre~ was secured. These two terminal marks and the intermediate support; nails were put in the same horizontal plane. The tapes were stretched and aligned on this comparator in precisely th~ same way as in field
----------~

,. The approximate elevation of' the base above sea level is 18()m.

Thie gives a

correction of - 1Q9mm to reduee the meuured length to sea level.

work, except that the stretcher at the rear end was fa:;;tened once for all in a rigid framework, and the position of the tape eontrolled by the s1ow-motiou screw of the balance l1ook to which the tape was attached. Variations in length of the tapes were thus ol,served at the front end by means of the ivory scale, wlticb conltl be easily read to tenths of millimetres. The thennometers pro,~ided with steel shields 'vere placed 1om from either end of the tape and l'Ntd by the obseryers at the ends of the tape, while a thermometer with bright bulb was read at the middle of the tape length by the obsern·r at that point, wlw also flipped the t~tpe a8 in field work. Observations on the tapes were made on this comparator on October 18, 19, 20, 21, and 24, 18~)2. On the fir~t frmr dates the obse1Tations were made accordiug to the following programn1e: One of the ta1·es being put under tension and bronght to I1ea.r coineidence with the reference mark at the rear end, the thermometers were first read; the observer at the rear end then brought the rear end graduation of the tape accurately to coincillence with the reference ma.rk at that end aud ~ignaled this fact by one blast frou1 his whistle. Thereupon the observer at the middle of the tape flipped it. As soon as the vibration of the tape ceased the observer at the rear end signaled the observer at the front end to read the scale. This being done the thermometers were aga,in read. Then the other tape was put under tension and a similar ~et of obserYations made on it and the thermometers. The time required to make such a series of observations with the two tapes was on the average about five miuutes. On October 24 tbe tapes wei·e obRerved on separately, one during the forenoon and one during the a:fternoon, and the thermometers were n·ad but once, and that immediately after the observations on the tape. The experiments were carried on regardless of the weatlwr except that they were discontinued when it was rainy. They began, as a rule, about 9 a. rn., and continued until about 9 p. m. Very Yariable conditions were thus· encountered. The early mornings of the dates of 11bservation were generally cool and foggy. As the fog was disRipated the temperature rose rapidly and then fell less rapidly toward sundown. The total temperature range was from 5° to ,35o C., and the daily ranges varied from so to 23° for the different dates. · 'J'he results of the experiments were comput~d in tlte field l>y Messrs. Haskell and Woodward, and subsequently revised at tl1e office by Mr. Safford, who also plotted all the temperature, tape-length, and cloudillPss curves supplied by the da.ta. A study of the numerical data aud of their graphical representation reveals the following special eba.raderistics of the experimeuts: (1) That the temperatures of the tapes were influeneed to a considerable extent by the local conditicns, which torced them to undergo certaill

of Ieng-th dependent on the type of day. The Uw1·~heaths, while tC:lllowiug· the chauges of tape temperature fairly well, indicate s01ne ~ystematic differences dependent 011 the local conditions and on fagging. The discrepancy between the tape and thermometric temperatures rose in extreme instances of rapidly varying temperature, as with alternating· cloud anfl sunshine, and "vitli alternating- currents of hot and cool air, to 3° C. (2) That tbe systematic character of the discrepancies betweeu tape and therinon1etric temperatures disappeared largoly after sundown. In order to derive the difference in length of the two tapes the quantity IJ-T0 · where D is the distance between the terminal mark~ of the cmnparator and T 0 is the length of either tape at oo C., was computed :for each set of observations by means of the known rates of expausio11 of the tapes. It was assumed for any date wh"-n the bvo tapes were simultaneously under comparison that D remained constan1, though the difterence iu lengths of the two tapes is practically fre1:· f"ron1 any change which may have occurred from day to day in that interval. Table XIV following gives a summary of the results of the tape comparison computed in the way just described. The first colnnrn gives the date, the second the number of comparisons on that date. the third an<l :fourth columns give the mean values of the resulti11gdifferenees IJ - T for the re~pective t.a.pes, and the last column give~ the difference in length of the two tapes at oo C., found by subtracting the result in the third column from the corref'loponding one in the fourth:

In deri_ving a final mean value of T 88 - T85 from the results in tbe last column of the above table it is thought best to assign weights proportional to the number of comparisons, except in the case of the result nf October 20.

The discrepancy 0·12rum is thus only

any considerable probability that an:v ('.bang(~ ilt the relative lengths of the tapes haR occurred since their absolute lengths were detennined ou the Holton comparator. It is possih1e, however. as remarked in section 23, that this discrepa11cy may arist· from a lack of defining power of the band-magnifying glasses rn~ed i11 tbe tape l'Omparisons at St . .Albans. Such power would not, it is believed, preclude tlw occurrence of an actual error equal to this di8en~pancy. It u1ay he ren1arked, however, that tlle maxhnum possible f'rror of St. Albaus. Ba.Re due to tliis discrt:.~pa1wy, even if real, is ouly 8ligbtly greatpr than one twomillionth part of its length. Fina.Hy~ it seems worth while to give tlJe results of certain observations made on October 24, 18H2, for the purpose of gett.ing an idea of the error involved in the operation of laying and stretching tbe tave. Jt happened on this date that very favorable conditions for det<';rminiug this error presented themselves. That is, the temperature was very l'iteady, the sun being obscured by elouds; there was equilibrium of nuliation as shown by the near equality in readings of the thermometen; with black a.nd brigbt bulbs, and there was little if any wind. Uuder these circumstances three set.s. of observations were made with the tape and thermou1eters iu the same way that observations are made in measuring a Jine, except that the t.ape was not removed from tue i-;npport nails of the comparator, and that the position of its front end wa~ 1·ead on the millimetre scale instead of being marked. on a. zinc plate. The tensiou of the tape. was in each case brought up fron1 zero to t.he standard a1nount, and all other operations performed in precisely the same manner as in the wo1·k of measurement. Table XV below ;:i:ives the results of these obser\~ations. The first column gives the limiting times of day of the groups of observatio11:.;; the second gives ilie temperature observed by tl1e tl1ermometers; the tbird gives the reading of the tape on the scale at its front end, the tape being set in t,ach case to coincidence with rue ma.rk at its rear end; the fourth gives the values of I>-T0 , or the difference between the comparator interval and the length of tlie tape at 0° C.; and the last column gives the dis<'n..,pancies 1' between the individual results fo1· any group and their

The residualR given in the 1ast column of tbis table arise from error:-. in defining the positions of· the tape at itH ends, from friction of tl1e tape on its supports, and from variations in temperature of the tape not registered by the thermometers. Presu1nably, the latter sour<'(' contributed litt1e to the resultant error during the short periodK of time covered by the groups of obervations; but whether allowance lw made for the temperature error or not, it a1)pears that the operatioll of placing and stretching the tape was subject to very small errors. Thus, the average value of the residuals in the table iR d::: O·o4mm, the inaximu1n 0·09mm, and the corresponding probable error of a single value of _D - T 0 is± O·o3rum. The probable error of laying a single tape length is undoubtedly somewhat greater than this amount under sueh conditions as are met on the average in field work; but it seems essen· tial to conclude fro1n the above observations that the more formidable errors which affect such tape measurements as have been described in the preceding pages arise fron1 defective means of getting the tape's temperature rather than from imperfections of manipulation.+
*The results of the experiments on the elongat!on of the tapes for increments to the normal tension are given in Supplement B, section 5.

MATHKMATJCAL THEOH):' OF

TAPES.

(1) Object of 'int7e.<.ttigatfon.-The use of long metallic tapes or wil·t·s iu measures of precision giyes rise to a number of questions which cau only be answered by a competent mathematical theory or by a seri(:s of elaborate experiments. Thus, in the use of such tapes it is essential to know how to co1npute the cbauge in length due to a change in te11~ion, the change in length due to a change in the number of supports oi1 which the tape rests, the change in length due to a change in weight per unit length of the tape, etc. It is the object of this brief investigation to give so much of the theory of such tapes or wires ·as is u~de<l to an!nver these practical <1 uestions. (2) J<Jquatkms of equilibrium, of elastfo tapes.-rrhe theory of the equiliprium of elastic strings, tapes, etc., is given in one form or anotht·1· in various treatises on mecha,nics. It generally proceeds, however, on the assumption of "perfect flexibility" of the material of the tape, or 011 some other doubtful assu1nption as to the internal stresses of tlwt material. Properly speaking, the inquiry belongs to the theory of elast1city, and its correct basis has been clearly set forth by Lame in se1·· tions 39-41 of his Les-ons sur la Theorie Mathematique de L'Elastieiti· des Corps Solides. · A tape as here considered is au elastic body of sma11 cross section su"Qject to tension applied at its ends and to any bodily force~, but tn··· from !'mrface tractions. The cross section 1nust be so small that tlw tension per unit area inay be considered constant over the entire an·;; of any section. l..1et m be the cross section and p the density of tlP' tape at any point of its length defined by rectangular coordinates .r. .'/, z. I..1et T be the totaJ normal teusiou on the section m, and denote tlw rectangular components of the bodily forees by ~¥, Y, Z, reii'pectivPly. Then the inve~tigation of l..1ame just referred to shows that the rnp1<1 tions of equilibdu1n of the element of 1nass pwds are

It iH the value of ?fin equation (7) or (9) when ;r; is the abscissa,' of" tbe point of support to which the sag is referred. 'Vhen the- supports of a section of a tape are in the sanie horizontol liue, the sag is found fr01n (9) by snbstituting for x half the spau of the section. It will be of interest to consider a numerical example with refereucC' to the tapes used with the tape base apparatus described in Chapter IV. Thus we have for steel tape No. 85:
Weight per n1etre of leng'th = w = :!~·:~2 gTa11111H~8, applied tension (25·;} pounds) = r = 1l567 gl'anuues.

It h;plaiu that if thit' line is inclined, the distance between the terininal marks of the tape will be greater than when the line iR horizontal. It js plain also that the dougation of a tape due to ordinary slo1w;-< can not be very great, but their use in refined 'vork requires that we Rhon1d know tl1e natu1·e and extent of such elongation. rrbe question tuay be itn:'"estigated in the f()lJOwing manner: Equations (12) give the rectangular coordinates of auy sectio11 of the tape. 'l'hB origin for tbesB coordinates is auy point on the curve, and is defined hy the constant fi. For the present purpose let us place tlie origin at the left-hand support of the section considered~ and let x 1 y, be the 1·oonlina.tes of the other end or support of tl1e sed.ion.

Tlrn base, including two extra ineasuremeuts of the standard kilo lJletre, was measured twice between July 28 and August V~. As soon as the mea~uremeut had beeu finished, the lengths of tlt(' rods were df~termined on the Standard 100-inetre Comparator, tl1P leugth of which had been found by Prof. R. S. Woodward, Assistant Coast and Geodetic Survey, and the relation of tl1e thermometer indications to the actual temperatures of the bars was investig-ated. This report will therefore first treat, of the results of this inveRtig-:ition and its bearing 011 the length of the base, after which t.he detail'-' of" the measurements of the base line and of tbe apparatus, will lw deseribed.

and 18, the know11 coefficie.nt of expan~ion aud the lengths as determined August 26. It will be seen that during· August :36 the thermometers indicated too low a temperature throughout the da.y while the temperature wa.K rising, amounting on the average to 0"·:.?H, say 0°·30 centigrade, anrl that a.s soon as the temperature fell the conditions were reversed, the rods tollowing the temperature of the air faster than the thermometers which again lagged 0°·3 behind. The result graphically delineated on the accompanying diagram (illustration No. a4) shows that the maximum lag corresponded to (it probably· followed) the hour of maximum heat of the day and to the greatest difference between the air and bar tern.peratures. The curve~ also exhibit the range of temperature to which tbe bar~ were subjected during the twenty-four hours following the first obserYatiou. Inas1nucl1 aR the 1neasure1nents on which these results depend were, made in the shade, that is, in the comparing shed, the question naturally presented it8elf what the relation between the indicated and true tem· perattires of the rodt'-1 n1ight be with the apparatus expm;ed to the suu. It was tbt·.refore decided to mea:-mre a section of the standard kilo· metre in the bright l"unshine under dreumstances wliieh should be very similar to thost=· under which t.he whole ba8e was nieasured. An additional st..01H' '\VHS therefor(· pJanted 100 inetres south of the 11orth end of tl1e standard kilometre a.ud the distance was meas1ued b,v Prof. '\Voodwa.rd during- his measures of the kilometre. On September 21 this dh~tance was a.f'cordingly measured with the ~econdary apparatus 5 times, and on the following day 8 times, usingthe trestles and measuring· exactly as in the base measu1·e1nent, with the exception that the beginn iug and end of each 100 metre measure was referred to the section stones by n1eans of microscopes and the cutoff' apparatns. The resnlts of these ineasuremenb; 1nay be discussed 011 two :suppo~itions: · ..

1. By givi11g equal weight to t11e four measnres of the 100 111 distance, made. by J>rof. Woodward, on t,llis snpposition, the distance = 1001n - .
fi·()4mni.

2. By giving double weight to the :)d a1ul 4th measures and this, hecause the 1st and 2d measures were made on the same day and not long after the 100 metre stoue had been set, while the 3d and 4th 1neasnres were made on different days and after the ground ha.cl dried. According to this supposition the distance is 100°1 - 5.99mrn. Computing on supposition 1 the results of these meaR11remeuts are as below given in detail and show an a.stonishing·ly high degree of pre· <·1s1on. They disclose the fact that. the lag was renderetl practically insensible by the bright sunshine, amounting to. 0°·07.

The first table shows the length of the barr:; deduced from th<> observed temperatures and the distance as_mea.~nired with the ieed bar by Prof. 'Voodward, nau1ely, 100m-6·04mm. The second table &how'"s the distance as computed front the obserYetl temperatures aud the adopted length of the bars derived Ang-nst li" and 18. As the object of this n1easurement was to show the thermal hehavior of the apparatus when suqjected to condit.iow;; similar to those whil·h prevailed during the n1easuremeut of the base, and since the whoh' base was ine~sured during rising temperatures, and nearly all of it during bright sunshine, the single nieasure made with fa1Iing temperatures, September 21~ 5 p. in.~ 111ay he thrown out of the second table. The eifect of throwing it ont is to increase slightly the indicated Jag· of the thermometers, but to decrease the probable error of nteasun· menl, which then becomes only 1-14 70000 for a single measure of tlw l.OO .. metre distance.

MEASUREMENT OF THE B:'..r ANl>ARD KlLO::\lETRE.

The standard kilometre, which is a part of the base line, was tuea.suretl four times during the progress of the base measurement proper. During these four measures the ground in tl1e wood:o-:., that is over about 600 metres of the distance, was very wet and springy and unfayora ble for the stabi1ity of the trestles, which were set directly into the soft ground. After tlie ground. had dried it was iueasured twice on September 24 :md 25. These six measures were made under about the same temperature conditions as those prevailing duri11g the base measures except that the line over oue-haJf of the kilometre paRses through woods. This becomes important in view of the results of the measures made in rhe sunshine; since the shade would tend to create la,g· iu the thermomders, fur it has been shown tlmt the average correction to the thermometers for lag, if the bars are shaded, amounts to about 0°·3 when the temperature of the air is rapit.Uy rising. It is therefore to be expected that the measures o1 the kilometre will not show as high a degree of accuracy as t110~e made. iu the sun~ :-shiue, owing chiefly to the uncorrected tb~rmal ettect of the Hhade~

Measiirement of Holton Base with the ..Zveu:: Secondary Base Apparatu,s.
The whole base was measured during rising temperatures and much the greater part during bright sunshine. All the experilnents show that under such conditions the bars are never shorter than the indicated temperatures imply, and that th~re fore the result~ if it is in error on account of thermometer lag, is too

small.
The experin1ents on the IOOm 1nea.sured in the bright sunshine, Septmber 21and22, show that the lag on supposition 1, explained in pages 7 and 8, amounts to about 1 part in one million, and on. suppositiou 2 to 74 i1~ 8 .,, and it is therefr>re a fair inference that its effect on the whole base is of that order of magnitude, and that it should be applied to the uncorrected Jeng-th of the base. U Hing the value 0·14"''" per lOOm the measure(l length should be increa:sed by 55 x 0·14 = 7.7rnm. In order uot to claim too high a precision for the Jength above given it seem:o; safo to assert that its abt-mlute error does uot exceed its 1-500000 pa.rt.

CONCLUSIONS IN REGARD TO 'l'HE USE OF THI:.; APPARATUS.

1. The average speed of measurements, including the time requisite for training tbP operatorK, may be taken at 1 kilometre per day of e!ght hours, on level ground, or on a uniform grade. With trained nwu tlie speed can be iucreased to 1·5 kilometres per day without detriment to accuracy. 2. If the temperature of the bars were known, the accuracy of measurement would leave nothing to be desired. The probable error of a single Illeasurement would then be about one part in a milJion. 3. As usual the principal source of error is in the uncertainty between the indicated and true temperature of the bars. This relation depends on the range of the diurnal temperature to which the bars have been exposed, and ibo; value must be subject to some uncertainty. It appears, however, that it is possible t-0 assign the limits of error due to lag of the thermometers. The absolute lag of the thermometers can safely be taken t-0 lie between 0 and :±:: 0°·5 U. on the average in a day's measurement. Hence, i f an error o-f one part in 340 000 spall not be exceeded, a single measurement with this apparatus will secure that degree of accuracy if the following rules be observed: 1. If the temperature is rising, apply a correction for lag of+ 0°·2.'> to the mean t.en1perature of the thermometers for the day, and a correction of - 0°·25 if it is falling. 2. If one-half of the day's measures are made during rising and the otbe1· half during falling temperatures, the mean may be taken without. correction. ' 3. I f the measurement is made. during hot weather and in the bright sunshine with rising temperatures, no correction need be made. It ma.y also be pointed out that where it is possible the bars, if day measurement only is intended, should be protected ae much as passible against change of temperature at night.

MEA.SUREl\-IENT OF HOLTON BASE, RIPLEY COUNTY, IND.

For description of base monuments aud locality see Assistant A. T. report, pp. 330, 331. The 5-metre contact slide rods Nos. 13 and 14 were used in this measUFemen t. This apparatus is of the usual pattern. It was made at the Coast and Geodetic Survey Office and was completed in July, 1891. The Ineasuring rods are of cylindrical steel, 5 metreR long and 9mrn in dia1neter, with the usual contact slides. The slide end of each rod carries a white agate knife edge 3rnm wide, the other a circular plane surface about 3unn in diameter. The index and slide piece of each rod have each three lines ruled on them. When the middle lines on the slide and index are in coincidence, the distance between the agate plane at one end and the knife edge at the other is the length o:f the rod. Each steel rod is encased in a built up wooden bar and rests directly in a longitudinal groove in its middle. The bars are 7 .5om wide, 14crn high, and 4·9 metres long, so that a length of about 10°m of each rod is. exposed to the air. Each rod carries two therinometers. They are inserted in opposite sides of the bar and are in contact with the rod and not with the wood. Each one is 1 metre from the end of the bar. The wooden bar in turn is surrounded with a white canvas cover lined with half an inch of cotton.

THE TRESTLES.

They are of the usual wedge and tripod pattern and are the same as those used in the Yolo base. Throughout all the measurements, except those on the comparator, the trestles were used without foot plates, the ll'gs being merely firmly stuck into the ground.
THE SECTORS.

The sectors are segments of arcs of circles. Each carries two (2) VPrniers 180° apart and is so graduated that the position in which the bar is horizontal reads nearly 20° on the front vernier. The verniers read to 10". Before beginning work the contact ends of each bar were put in a horizontal plane by means of a leveling instrument, theodolite, or engineer's transit. In general the sector errors were determined three times a day. Each sect.or was protected against the sun by a hood made of canvas stretched on a wire frame attached to the bar. During all the measures t.he two verniers each sector were read by different persons.

Measurenient of Holton B(lse with the New Secondary Base .A.pparatu11.
ALIGN::.VIENT.

The bars were aligned during the nieasuremeut by bringing the rear end of the rod over the starting point or into contact with the forward agate of the rear bar and keeping it there while the forward end of the bar was aligned by pointing a small telescope on a signal usually mounted on the next section stone ahead. A small aligning- telescope is mounted on each bar 25 centimetres from the front end. The base of the uprights carrying the telescope has a sliding motion on an arc of a circle concentric with the measuring rod. It carries a level, by means of which it cau be clan1ped in a horizontal position in a vertical plane passing longitudinally through the rod. In order that the telescope may transit in this plane the adjusting screws of the base must be properly set. The adjustment was not made with satisfactory accura.cy during the first measurement of the distance between south base and the fourth kilometre stone. On reaching this stone a second and more perfect adjustment was made. Subsequently the deviations from a straight line during this fra.ctiona.l part of the first measure were traced on the ground, and it was found that the error due to the deviation of the measured line from the base line amounted to not more than 1 part in 15 000 000, which can therefore be neglected. Experiments were made to determine the probable error of alignment of a single bar with the teleseope adjusted as in the remainder of the measures and it was found to be 38".
GROUND TRAVERSED.

The. greater part of the measurement was over grassy soil. Several · plowed fields were erossed. · The surface of the ground near south base is broken, and between the 3 000 and 3 900 metre stone it is also very irregular. The first four measures of the Standard Kilometre were n1ade when the soil was wet and springy, but during the measures ntade on September 24 and September 25 it was dry and hard. A distance of 200 111etres at each end of the Standard Kilometre is in the open fields; the remainder is in the woods.
DUTIES PERFORMED BY MEMilERS OF THE PAR.TY.

Prior to September 21, during the measurements, the ha.rs were aligned by Prof. Gore, who also read the forward thermometer; the rear thermometer was read by :Mr. Pennington; one vernier of each sector was read by Mr. Gjertsen, the other by Mr. Hayford, who also

kept the record and called attention to any apparent or real errors in the readings. After September 20 the alignments were made by ML Hayford. Throughout the work the contacts were made by myself, using a small lens magnifying 3 diameters.
SECTION MARKS.

The base and its sections, excepting the Standard Kilometre, were marked by lines traced at right angles to the direction of the base nIL copper bolts set into stones. The ends and intermediate sections of the Standard Kilometre were marked by spherical-headed bolts, intended to be used in connection witl1 a so-called cut-off apparatus. This apparatus consists of an upright cylinder having a conical recess at its foot, which fits over the spherical bolthead. The cylinder can be revolved about its upright axis, and any deviation from verticality is measured by n1eans of an attached spirit level. On top, and at right angles t.o its vertical axis, the cylinder carries a scale diyided into millimetres, to which an oqject over it can be referred, and which gives itx relation to the geometrical center of the bolthead. In starting, the slide was usually clamped in coincidence with tlw index, and the knife edge wa.s brought over the starting point by meaBs of a theodolite or transit sector mounted at right angles to the base line. When stopping for lunch, a line traced on a copper tack in a stub iu the ground served as a reference mark. The record of the measurements of the Holton base line with 5-metre contact slide rods Nos. 13 and 14 is contained in 3 volumes. Volume 1, pages 1 to 230, and Volume II, pages 1 to 68, contain the record of the base measureinent proper, including two extra measurements of the Standard Kilometre. Volume II, pages 71-158, contains determinations of the length of the rods in terms of the 100-metre comparator. For description and details of this comparator, see Assistant R. S. Woodward's report.
LENGTH OF THE RODS.

The length of the rods was determined immediately after the base measuren1ent by measuring the distance between the ends of the standard 100-metre comparator. The legs were taken off the trestles and the tripod heads carrying the. wedges were screwed on substantial boards, which fitted across the track prepared for the iced bar carriage. In starting, the slide of the bar was clamped to coincidence. The knife edge was brought under a microscope mounted over one end of the 100-metre comparator, and a pointing was made with the microscope on the knife edge. The axis of the microscope was referred to the end mark by m.eans of the cut-oft" ~pparatus.

Measurement of Holton Base with the New Secondary Base Apparatus.
The measurement of the distance was then carried on as usual,,except that the tripod heads rested in the track, as above described. On reaching the other end of the comparator, where auother microscope and cut-off apparatus were 1nonnted, a spider thread wa8 stretched over the i·lane surface of the agate of the rod, and the microscope pointing was made on the space, which was lH'\'"er more than about ~o microns in width, between the direct an<l reflected image of the thread. For the deductions drawn from th.c·se and other determh1atious of the length, see my report to the Superintendent. Pages 159 to 162 of Volume II contain the determination of the correct.ion to the zero poiuts of the thermometers attached to the base rods. Pages 188 and 189 furnish a deterrnina.tion of the error of contact which results fron1 the fact that the agate planes are not at right angles to the axis of the rods. This error of contact affects the length of the rods when separately determined under microRcopes, but does not afl'ect theh· combined length deduced on the 100-metre comparator.

Volume Ill, pages 4 to 31, coutain a number of measures of the :first hundred metreR of the Sta11dard li:ilometre made in the bright sunshine in order to determine the effeet of the sunlight on the lag of the thermometers attached to the rods. In these measurements the rods were used on the trestles in the usual manner, but at the beginning and eud of the 100-metre distance a microscope was mounted and the cut-off a.pparatus was used in the same manner as on the standard 100-metre comparator, as previously described.

MEASURE OF THE IRREGULARITY IN ONE TURN OF THE MICRO.METER SCREW, AND THE RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH TURN.

A report by GEORGE DA v1nsox, AssiRtant. Submitted for publication A11ri1 3, 1893.

In 1876 I gave an explanation of the cause, or the principal cause, of the well-known irrf'gularity observed iu one turn of the inicrometer screws of the zenitl1 telescopes. l\fany years befi:>re I had reported the existence of e~cessive itTegularity in the micrometer screw of an English instrument, but it was explained to arise from the manner in which the screw was eut by the instrument maker. Nevertheless, the method of deterinining the arc value of the micrometer screw by observations upon a close circumpolar star, although imperfect on account of the unsteadiness of the image of the star, the fewness of the ob~ervations possible in one turn, etc., developed a periodicity in the irregularity that suggested a cause independent of the mere 1nethod of cutting the screw. In my paper on this meeliauica.l defect of the micrometer (1876), two methods of proc,~dure were suggested to determine tl1e character and amount.of the irregularity at frequent intervals in one turn. It has liappened that neither could be put in practice until lately. Within the last year two close circumpolar stars have been observed as often as ten tunes in each turn of the micrometer screw for ten consecutive turns and five times in each turn for twenty other turns. I have not reduced the observations, but am satisfied from the unsteadiness of the object and the comparatively low power used ( 100 diameters) that the results will be much interior to those of the second method. This second method was partly developed, during the observations for variation of latitude at San Francisco in 1891 and 1892, in discus8io11s with T. D. Davidson. It result.eel in projecting the image of the n1icrometer thread by means of the objective of a microscope, upon a

graduated scale, and measuring with the micrometer each division of the scale. The micrometer box was secured to the stage of a microscope that was turned horizontally with the eye end towards the scale, which was about 2 feet distant. The illumination was by a strong light behind the thread, but was not satisfactory. From the microscope tnbP to the scale a dark cloth was used to exclude diffused light. One obseryer was at the scale and the second observer was at the Inicrometer. After the proper focusing for the best image of the thread, and adjustment for paraUelism of the thread with the scale graduations, the observations proceeded. The results were so encouraging that, after the latitude work was done, further experiments were made, with limited means, however. The last observations were as follows: We had no solid piers upon which to place the scale aud the microscope, but the micrometer, so1newhat imperfectly secured to the stage of the Inicroscope, was placed upon a library table and the scale upon a crossbar in a door. The eyepiece of the microscope was removed, and the tube carrying a 1i-inch Gundlach oQjective was turned hori..:ontally towards a wall, upon which, at 15 feet distant, the images of the micrometer rack and thread were fairly well seen by using sunlight illumination through the objective. T. D. I)avidson improvised a n1eans of holding the scale and giYi11g it all required lllovements except for distance, whi~h was reduced at the mic:i;oscope to about 12 feet, when the image of the micrmneter thread passed over 25 millimetres of the scale for one turn of the micrometer screw. A pasteboard tube 11 feet long and 5 inches iu diameter was support.ed between the microscope tube and the scale, and the intervening spaces at each end were covered with black muslin. The illumination was by lamplight. The image of the thread was weak and a.t the best did not present a solid line, but naturally appeared as two lines m.arking the outer edges of the 'thread with a lighter middle Hpace. The millimetre scale had been purposely cut deeply by the instrument maker, and the surface was afterwards ground by T. D. 1 ). The lines of the scale were, therefore, very strongly marked, but a better scale should be used. A small magnifier, which increased the scale spaces about one and a half times, was conveniently fixed by the sea.le observer t.o aid in adjusting the thr~ad image to the millimetre scale, and a hand magnifier was used by the n1icromet,er observer. 'fhe micrometer head is 5f inches in circumference, made of black zylonite' and finely graduated to one hundred divisions in white. The milled head is the same diameter; both ought to have larger diameters. After the best focus of the image of the micrometer thread had been 6btained and the parallelis1u of thread and scale lines effected, and the instrtllllent parts all .lightly tapped to remove strains of parts, the observations commenced.

Measure of the Irregularity in one turn of the Jl'hcrmneter Serew, etc.
W1th the micrometer thread at the middle of the rack and reading 2 000, the millimetre scale was nioved horizontally until the image of the micrometer thread was between two given graduations. In this position the image was just broad enough to leave a very narrow line of light between the outer edges of the image and the inner edges of the two graduation lines. The relative breadths of tllese two lines of light enabled the scale observer to judge of the central position of the thread image. The micrometer observer then moved off the image and brought it back to a position tinally announced correct by the scale observer. The micrometer reading was recorded. The micrometer was then turned forward to the next scale space and adjusted as before and the reading recorded. So the work proceeded until 25 spaces we1·e observed and recorded, and then the micrometer was run back to the starting space and the reading made to note if any change of position had occurred. With our unstable means the change of J.)Osition ranged as high as 0·7 of a division in the first series; tbe average difference in the twenty-four sets was 0·1 of a division. When two sets ba.d been made the observers changed places and two more sets were observed. The scale was then reversed and inverted and four nwre io;ets were observed in a similar manner. Each series of four sets occupied one hour at the outset; afterwards less tbau fifty minutes. The observations were made in the daytime or at night, to suit our eonvenience. It was evident from the first set of measures that tbe character of the screw was above the average that I J'r:id hitherto used, and after a few sets had been made there was no (Y,__>nbt to either observer about obtaining the nearest tenth of a micrometer division at the scale. The independent check of the observer at the micrometer upon the coincidences of contact of scale and image was an interesting check, and each amused himself at times in trying the skill of the scale observer. The greater difficulty was really in reading the micron·eter. It is hardly necessary to give the observations in extenso, although they have been useful in demonstrating that the stability of our outfit was imperfect, and that the !.,rraduation of the scale and the ground surface should be better. The means of each series of four sets, and the means of the direct and the reverse scales, and the final means are given to show the possibilities of the metl1od. The results are certainly better than could be gotten by any amount of observations 011 close circumpolar stars, and they are too plain to require exhibition in graphic form. The actual observing time of twenty-four sets of twentysix. observations each was 5 hours and 22 minutes.

Another application of this method was tried last year to determine the relative value of each turn of the micrometer screw. The reading of the micrometer was noted when the image of the thread was upon any division of the millimetre scale; the micrometer was turned once and the scale reading noted; then the micrometer was bodily moved back by the microscope stage motion to the first scale coincidence, turned once, and the scale reading noted. This method of repetition was carried far enough t-0 tiest its practicability. It demands a finer motion to the microscope stage than I possessed, but there can be no doubt of the method giving satisfactory results. I may add that the discussion of the means of getting a better image of the micrometer thread led T. D. Davidson to experiment with the spider thread. He scoured a spider cocoon in boiling water a.nd soap, and then boiled it in a test tube for twenty minutes with black ''diamond dye" for silk, according to directions, and produced a jetblaek cocoon without injury to the thread. The object was, of course, fo obtain a stronger image of the thread at the scale, whereby a stronger inagnifter would materially aid the observer. I have compared the

black thread with a natural thread and in color the former is decidedly preferable. In experimenting with this prepared thread for latitude observations we have found that it acquired very marked hygrometric qualities that unfit it for latitude or transit observations. February 1.2, 18.94.-As this appendix is passing through the press, the Superintendent has authorized the insertion of the followingn1emorandum by A.ssistaut Schott and the graphic illustration of the average inequality of 1 turn of· the micrometer screw from 3 series of observations upon 4 close circumpolar stars near elongation at different seasons of the year. In the figure the broken line exhibits the curve of the inequality of 1 turn as traced through t.he points determined by the observations through a11 average of 30 turns. The dotted line exhibits the curve computed from these observations. The heavy broken curve exhibits tlte results by the microscope-pr~jection TI}ethod of 24 sets of measures at every 4th division of the 20th turn of the microIUeter.·
The expression for the periodic inequality for one turn of the motion of the screw of zenith telescope No. 3, and which may be termed "Eccentricity of the serew hea<l," was derived from 15 series of observations made for the greater part at intervals cf 1,- of a turn, t with a. few at t and t turns. The transits range over the whole screw (4 to 36 tnrnR) and thuR give a fair average value. The particulars of' the observations are shown in the following table:

ON THE LEAST SQUARE AD.JUSTMENT OF \YEIU HIN GS.

0FJ.'ICE OF STANDAR.D WEIGHTS A.ND :MEASURES,

Wa.-;hington, D. O., August 24, 1892. SrR: I _beg leave to submit for publication the following paper, which, by my direction, was prepared and compiled by Mr. John F. Hayford, of this office. It consists of formulre "for the least square adjustment of weighings of such series or sets of weights as occur commonly. If a set of weights of specified nominal dimensions be given, it is required to intercompare them. in such a way that a sufficient number of observation equations can be formed to bring out a precise result. The paper shows by symbols the manner in which the weights should he combined in the weighings. The result is then worked out symbolically with numerical coefficients for the quantities sought and for their probable errors.
NOTATION.

Let each weight be indicated by its nominal value inclosed in a }larenthesis, which has as a subscript the designation of the set to which it belongs, and also, if necessary, as subscript or superscript, a ligure to indicate which (Jf two or znore similar weights of a set is meant. rl'hus: (lOgm)·, (100()wn) 0 , (5rn·) pi, (20Qgm)* 2 , (lgm) 3 pi. r a is uniformly used in the following pa.per to indicate the probable l'rror of a single weighing. For convenience in computation the nominal value of each weight 1 11ay be omitted from each absolute term and tl1e weight placed equal to its correction, the nominal value being always understood, though not. expressed.

RESULTS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATCONS AT STATIONS IN ALASKA AND IN THE NORTH\VEST TERRITORY Ol!~ THE DOMINION OF CANADA.

Observations H.t five stations in Alaska by .J. E. l\lcGRATH and J. HENRY TURNER, Assistants, U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, in the years 1889, 1890, and 1891. Discussion of" results and comparison with other stations by CHARLES A. SCHOTT,. Assistant.

Submitted for publication June 22, 1892.

The report which I have the honor to submit herewith relates only to the magnetic results reached by Assistant J. E. McGrath and Assistant .J. H. Turner in connection with their survey of the eastern boundary of Alaska, between l\Iouut St. Elias and the Arctic Ocean, during 1889-'90-'91. The magnetic records and observers' computations are the only returns ma.de to date; hence they were taken up first. The office computation is by Mr. L.A. Bauer. The instrumental outfit of Mr. McGrath consisted of Magnetometer No. 7 and Barrow Dip Circle No. 12; Mr. 'l'urner had Theodolite Magnetometer No. III and Barrow Dip Circle No. 8; also a prismatic compass.

This is not a secular-change station, but n1ay become one hei·eaflt~r. In the summer of 1827 Admiral Liitke found 30" 30' .E. in Norton Sound near this. place, and in June, 1874, L. M. Turner found 23° 0' E., thh.i, last probably a roug·h and unreliable v~lue. We infer from other stations that the declination has been diminishing since Liitke's time; hence an annual rate of 7'~ which seems to fatll in well with results at . stations in the vicinity.

The only other observations known to m.e at this place are those of Capt. C. W. Raymond, U. S. B. He found: 1869, August 14, 16 and 2G, IJ = - 36° 32'·7, 8 = 79° 49'·5, but his intensity results h = 2·73:!1 an<lf = 15·472, or when converted into C. G. S. terms H = 0·1260 and F' = 0·71:34, appear to be too large. The average an11ual diminution of declination becomes 4'·6, a smaller value than had been suppose(l heretofore. Probably the trn.th lies between 4'·6 and 10'·0, particnlarl;< since no extreme value was known to have been reached in the interval of twenty years. The isogonic chart for 1890, Appendix No.11, Report. for 1889, p. :·m6, gives the declination - 33°, or about 2° too small, dLte to the cause just mentioned. 1 (4) Camp Davidson, eastern boundary, on Yukon River.-<p = 64° 41 , A. = 140° 57 '.

Results of .Magnetic Observati-Ons at stations in A.la.ska and in the Jforthu:e,st 7-'erritory.
No reliable value for annual change of declination can be deduced, the series being too short, but here also the indications point to a smaller value than had been inferred previously. A diminution of about 5' or 6' is probable. (5) Camp Colonna, Porcupine R·ivci'.-cp = 67° 2,}'·1, A. = 140° ti8'·8. At thfa station we have absolute measures as well aH differential ones hy .T. H. 'J1nrner aud party. The results of the former are as follows: 11"'rom daily observations between June 13 and 25, inclusive, 18!m. I> = - 38° 06 1 ·8 0 = 80° 36'·9 H = 0·0972 and F = 0·~}961 , H. W. Edmonds, observer. The differential measures form quite an extensive series and admitted of some of the usual deductions respecting the variations of declination. These measures are confined to yariations in declination and were made every ft ve minutes through twenty-four hours on one day (Tuesday) of every week between November, 1889, and June, 1890; in all, covering thirty days of observation. In this work ~Ir. Turner was assisted by H. W. Edmonds, J. Meade, \V. E. Lingard, and C. P. Ilarkort. The five-rn.inute jutervals were considered as unnecessarily close, i. e., the same results were deducible from the hourly values, hence the latter only were reduced to a unifor1n zero by applying the correction for the various circle readings; that is, they were converted into abtmlute measure. The position of the mag11eth~ axis of the long or intensity magnet was determined in June, 1890, also at Iliuliuk ancl at St. l\Uchael in .Tune and .Tuly, 18m}; a weighted mean value has been used.. In the hourly tabulation of results the letter" a'> indicates the appearance of an aurora. 13-etwcen December Hand 16 the sun disa.ppeared and re-appeared above the horizon. between .January 20 and 27. The adopted scale reading of the axis was 3:!:d·l, and the value of oue division of the scale is 1'·60; there are many readings connecting the zero of the horizontal circle of the decliuometer with the azimuth mark. The tabnlation is herewith appended. A result differing more tha.u 13' from its hourly mean has been marked as a disturbance :ind is indicated by a star attached to it. The character of the diurnal Yariation remains the same for the total and the normal diurnal varintions, the latter showing less amplitude. The accompanying table has heen prepared to show the accord of the diurnal variation of the declination at this camp with the variations observed at several surrounding l'ifations, though widely separated geographically.

APPENDIX No. 12-1892.

ON THE DIRECT SYNTHETICAL METHOD OF AD,TURTI.XG
A TRIA.XGELATION.

By CnAS. H.

KuMMELL,

Computing Division, U. S. Coast and Geodetie Sun·ey. Submitted for publication July 7, 1893.

The method in general use for adjusting a triangulation is the indirect one. At each station a station adjustme.nt is made, and then, in order not to disturb t11e station relations, the further correctionA to the angles are expressed in the form of a difference of corrections to its two directions; and the rigorous conditions of the triangulation being thus expressed and multiplied by indeterminate factors, usually called correlates, are then added to the minimum. function, i.e., the weighted snn1 of squares of corrections to the observed directions, before the conditions for the minimum are found by differentiation. This gives, tben, the corrections to each direction in terms of the corr~lates, and by substituting these int-0 the rigorous conditions we obtain the normal equations, which, being solved, give the numerical values of tl1e con·elates, and thence also the corrections to the directions, and finally those of the angles. There are two principal difficulties in the applica.tion of this method. One of these is the correct establishment of the rigorous conditions; the inexperienced computer may easily omit an essential condition and use one instead which is derivable from the others. Another difficulty is experienced sometimes by the presence of small angles, which require an extremely precise solution of the normal equations, and it may happen, nevertheless, that the conditions are not a:o; exactly fulfilled as desired. The latter difficulty would be avoided if, instead of using correlates, we eliminate as 1nany corrections as there are rigorous conditions, and then make the weighted sum of the squares of independent and dependent corrections a minimum in the usual manner. The normal equations thus obtained require neither such precision in their formation nor in their solution, because they fulfill only the minimum. condition. But it has the difficulty in the establishment of conditions in common with the indirect method and a new, even greater, difficulty besides, viz, the elimination of dependent corrections of directions,

especially from a very large number of conditions. This method, which I call the direct analytical method, to distinguish it from a method free of these three difficulties, the direct synthetical, is given in sonie books (see, for instance, Jordan's Handbuch der Vermessungskunde, Vol. 1, p. 115) as a possible method, not to be used on account of its great complexity for a great number of conditions. The direct synthetical method, which is the subject of this paper, ha8 au object similar to that of the direct analytical n1ethod, viz, to express the corrections to the dependent augles in terms of those to the independent ones; but it does that without establishing the conditions in toto. Whether only one station or a whole triangulation is considered, or a number of new points joined to already fixed ones, a set of fundamental angles is selected, and in the work of expressing the correction.s to the dependent or supernumerary angles the proper conditions for this purpose present themselves. A. condi'tion thus used needs no further consideration~ and by thus removing condition after condition tlle work takes a strictly prescribed course, differing, however, more or less for a. different set of fundamental angles. Thus we avoid completely the danger of duplication or omission of conditions. As to the number of normal equations to be solved, either mode of tbe direct 1Ilethod has the advantage generally. It happens ouly in undeveloped figures that the indirect method leads to fewer normal equations; for, in order to establish n points, 2 (n - 2) angles are sufficient, which number is therefore the number of normal equations required by either mode of the direct methods o(adjustment.· If the number of supernumerary angles is < 2 (n - 2) there will be fewer normal equations by the indirect method; but then the triangulation will also be weak. If, however, every possible angle is measured between n })Oints, we have (':n - 2) 2 normal equations to solve by the indirect method, so tl1at the direct method becomes the more advantageous in this respect, tbe more perfect the triangulation is. It was already stated that in such a triangulation, particularly if n is large, the work of expressing tl1e corrections to the dependent angles in terms of those to independent ones is considered impracticable by the direct analytical method. This may be so; but I shall now show that by the syn· thetical direct method it is the more systematic the more complete the _ triangnI..ation is, and take the case of a complete 3 pentagon, in which I suppose at first that the at each station are already adjusted. 2 ~~---++---::~· angles Number the stations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; denote the Ineasured ang1es 1 2 -:J, 1 2 _., 1 2 -r,, 1 3 .,, 1 3 .5, 1~·:., 2a-1' etc., the corresponding adjusted angles by 112-a], [12 ... ], etc. Each of these angles receives a correction, which may be very conveniently expressed as the difference of the corrections to its two directions, so that we have for examp1e [3t-r,J = 3_..r. ~ 34

These two triangle-:. are contained in the (p1adrilateral 1. 2. 3. 4. and have each two fundamental angles, so that the corrections to the third a.ug·Jes, 3 1 ·2 , 4 1.2 , are easily expresse<l in te1·ms of fundamental angles by closing the:-:;e triangles, and the numerical quantities L1 1 'll.3 , L-1 111 .., are the deficiencies of the measured angles 3i ·z, 4 1.,,.

There is now one more triangle, 3. 4. 5, which is putside the base 1. 2.

After 4aving performed the eliminations as indicated, aud wl1ich are far more simple in a numerical instance, we have the corrections to each angle in the figure in terms of the symbols 12, l:i, 1 4 , 15, 2 1 , 2 3, 2-l, 2 5"' apparently eight independent quantities, but in reality six, since only their dift'erences have an absolute va.lue; and to reduce the problem to its essential form we may put, for instance, 12 = 2 1 = O, but it is advantageous for checking t4e formation and solution of the normal equations to retain them. Since we have supposed for the present that at each of the stations a local adjustment has been made, we must derive the weights of each angle from that previous work. The attentive reader will observe, however, that the process, just showu for the complete pentagon, to exp~ss the angle corrections in terms of those of fundamental angles, may be applied just as well to the unadjusted stati9n angles, so that it is not at all necessary to make a separate station adjustment. The

detailB of the work, if 110 stati011 adjustment ,is m~ui.~, I reserve for a future paper. There iH no <lifticulty "''~hatever of applying the process to a, greater number of points; for we have seen that the work on the quadrilaterals 1. 2. 3. 4; 1. 2. 3. 5; 1. 2. 4. ;,, far fro1n interfering with each otl1er had, on the contrary, parts in common. For a sixth point W('. should go through the additional quadrilaterals J. 2. 3. G; 1. 2. 4. 6; l. 2. n. 6. in the same nutuner. Then there ·will he three new exti·a base triangles 3. 4. (); 3. 5. 6; 4. 5. 6, which are filled out by regarding station relations only. If some directions have been observed but one way, this n1akes no difference in the process, except that angles not observed are uot expressed, provided there are at least two stations which see all the other stations; for we can the11 use the angles at these stat,ions as fnndaniental angles. If, however, this condition is not fulfilled, we can not find the required niunber of funda1nental angles at any two stations, and it may thus be necessary to se1eet them at three or more points. It.seems preferable (though for lack of experi(..nce this may be subject to future modifications) to select tllese angles so that all n1easured angles at the stations n1ake up the re(1uired number. If directions are entirely wanting, the process requires so1ne Illodification, particularly as to the form of sidei equations, which then often involve more than four points. 1 select a somewhat typical case in applying the procesi-; to tlw following polygon:

Here we take the angles at 1, 2, :~, 4 for fundamental angles (a good selection would also be U1e angles at 1, 6, 4), and the work proceed:-:; as follows:

sin r51 ·61 sin-t 1~;,1

in which we .have to use the f(Jrm~ just given. The expression for the required correction of 5 6 '4 is then easily ol>tai11ed in the... nau11er shown. The forms for the corrections of G4 ."' G,,. 1, 5 1 .6 then follow, and all angles that form. triangles have then their corrections expressed in terms of those to the fundamental angles at 1, :.!, 3, 4. The expressions for corrections of angles that do not fbrm triangles, such as l:u·,, 6::..3 , etc., are easily forn1ed. In the 1ninimu1n stun of squares of corrections we n1ay either exclude or include these latter, and there will al ways be something arbitrary uuless we use angles not locally adjusted. In that case we know not on1y which augles are rneasured, but also their precise weight, and everything arbitrary disappears. However, for secondary triangulations such questions have very little importance, and it would hardly be objected to by anyone to include in the n1inimum stun of' squares onlJ.' the corrections of angles whielt fonu triangles. It is easily seen that by rn~ing this principle we shall have for a single chain of triangles '\Yithout auy dia.gonals the old connnoH-sense method, viz, to distribute the closing error equally. These questions, however, forn1 no part of my metbod, whose objeet is simply to obtain expressions for the corrections of angles in terms of those of the fundamental angles. A problem of great importance and frequent occurrence is to join one or more new stations to a syste1n of points already fixed. Siuce n new points are established by 2 n angles, we can express the <~orrection of every measured angle in terms of the eo~rections to 2 17, fundamental anglea, and thus "'ve have to form and solve 2 n nor1nal equations, whatever may be the number of fixed poi11t~. lu this case tl1e direct synthetical method leads to a certain number of uormal ec1uations for any number of fixed points, while for the iudireet method the number of normal equations increases with that number.

I conclude by giving a summary of the c1aims in favor of the direct synthetical n1ethod of adjustment: 1. It is impossible to omit or duplicate conditions. 2. It becomes the more systematic the more complete the triangulation. 3. It leads to fewer normal equations in strong triangulations. 4: These require f'a.r less precision in their formation and solution than those for the indirect method. 5 .·Toining new point~ to a number of ftxed points, the number of normal equations is independent of the number of :fixed points.
