REPORT.

SunvEY 0FFTCF:, lra87li11gto1r, Scptembca· 15, 1874. SIR: I have the honor to submit, with this report on the progress marle during the year ending June 30, some remarks 011 the eoll(1ition of the Coas~ San·e~-, and suggestious for maintaining a Rteady rate of progrc:;s in the 1vork. When appointed as Superintendent, on the 17th of February fast, after haviug been, l1uriug the preceding thirteen .>ears, H;rdrogra phic Inspt>ctor of the Coast Sm·\·ey, I found tlia t, with the assn red co-operation of the late Snperintende11t, Proft·ssor Ben.iamin Peirce>, for needful cowrnltatio11 in RCi· entific matters, my only duties, additional to h~·drograpLic details, would lie thosp of can·f'ul direction and administration. The method!", processes, and fornrnhe established and perfected liy the three eminent men Hassler, Bache, and Peirce, \-d10 ha>e precetkcl in the charge of the work, the laRt being the aclrnowlerlged mathematical chief of our country, lean· nothi11g to be added to tl1eir theoretical construction and >alues, and but little in the way of coustauts and refinements as likely to be developed by further a.d,·ances in science. Tue directin· aud :i<lrninistrath~e duties as now extended, call for the almost exclusin:· attention and time of the Superintendent, in order to insure JH'oper results and due economy. The work requires such assii,;tancc as the most a<h-anced science of thP country can afford, anc1 this requisite is met by a number of alile assistants, and by the hearty co-operation of all the leading scie11tific men of the nation. The se,·eral didsions and classes of the work, which ha>e grow11 from the small beginning on the sonth beach of Long Island in 1832, until they now spread their utilities aud benefits in twents· eight States and Territories, will be adhered to. In the early years of the Snrver, field-operations lwing theu restricted to the ,·icini(Y of New York Bay, and the working-season consequently from April to December, the custom armw to report the operations for the ye-ar ending with Novembt·r. At present, howeyer, as for some years past, field.work is prm·ecuted continuonsly at the North during tLe summer ancl on the Southern coast during winter. It has been found impossible to receive field-reports from distant parties, some being on the coast of 'Vashington Territory, :wd one of them on the coast of Alaska, in time to include mention of their results in a report annually closed au<l prescntP<l in December. I liave, therefore, substituted the end of tLe fiscal year for the closing date; and this rPport will conform to what has been general URage in regaHl to annual statemm1ts from other branches of the public service. The report now submitted will notice in detail tLe work done la::;t winter and spring, an<l will mention also the allotment of parties for the work of the early part of the present fi,;;c:tl year. In explanation of the estimates suhmitted for the Coast Survey, both in relation to tht· a1m1rnl expenditures and the vessels required, I ha>e the honor to state, that when placed in charge of the Coast Survey, in Februar,r last, l found tllat my predecessor had suumittetl estimates for the present fiscal year, based upon the strict.est principles of the relations between economy of expenditures and largeness of results, and predicated upon a policy indorsed by Congress through a serie.;:; of years. These estimates, in the aggregate $825,ooo, were reduced by Congr<:ss (in the gm1rral policy at that time so nee.dfnl) in its appropriations to but $70u,OOO for the regular work of the Uoast Survey, a decrease of $119,000, or 14i per cent. below the amount of the estimates. This reduction

has necessarily restrained me from the execution of much work greatly wanted, but now postponed to the next fiscal year. All the omitted work of this year, as well as the work due to the next, must be executed in the coming year to place the Coast Survey in the position it would have occupied had the appropriation of this year equaled the estimates so carefully prepared and submitted by my predecessor. One of my first duties after being appointed was to make a careful investigation and m1timate of tlrn amount of work :yet to be done to complete the survey of our now actual coasts; to compare thii'I amount with that already executed, as well as the time consumed in the latter with that estimated to be necessary in the former. A comparison of the actual spaces covered by the various classes of work now finished and those to be lloue would not yield a true ratio of their respective times; for at first the Coast Survey bad, from the necessity of tbe case, to be commenced on a very limited scale, and many years had to elapse before a full organization could obtain, and the work be carried forward from many centers, in the several sections of both coasts, by trained officers. In fact, the organization, the methods, and the officers Lad to be created by the eminent men who have preceded me. The splendid results justit~· their work. lu 183:!, when the Coast Survey really made a beginning, Texas and California, with fifteen hundred miles of sea-coast, and more than four times that number in harbor-lines and island-shores, as also Alaska, with its enormous length of ocean-shore, were foreign territories. For ten years, the work necessarily advanced tentatively and slowly, and subsequently, having recei\'eu the indorsement of the highest scientific and practical anthorities in both this country and Europe, was fully approved by Congress, which, during the years 1856, '5i, '58, '59, and '60, made such increased appropriations as utility and economy demanded. In 18'12, the work of the Coast Sun-ey was being executed in four States. In 1874, the Coast Survey, thoroughly organized, is working iu twenty-four States and two Territories, and capable of producing, with its present coustauts of expense, the largest amonnt of and most ecouomical results. In face of the difference in the value of money, the average salaries of assistants and subassist· ants iu 1874 is no greater than in 1842. The experience of the Ooast Survey now admits of a very close estimate of the time and means required to complete the snrvey of our now actual coast. I have carefully gone over the finished and unfinished work of the Coast Survey, compared cost and time, and find the Coast Survey has bl·en at work for forty-two years, and that two thirds of the coast have been surveyed, exclusive of Alaska. I conclude, after making due allowance for unforeseen delays, that the survey of the now actual sea-coast of the L'"uited States remaining nnsurveyed can be completed in twelve years if the moderate means a,;ked for are supplied. These means are but the restoration of the value of the annual a1)propriation to that of the average of the years 1856 and '57, '57 and '58, '58 and '59, '59 and '60, with two more Yessels than were at that time in the Coast Sur\·ey. A comparison of the actual cost in number of dollars of any class of work in 1858 and 1874 is no measure of relative economy. The following statistics give tile cost for a number of articles and rates of wages and compensation between the periods 1854-'58 and 18G9-'H, as taken from official printed documents :

Average increase of seven otlJ.er classes of wages in five States equals a per cent. Average cost per ton in Baltimore of a merchant-Yessel's hull and spars in 1858 equals $24.50; in 1874, $53 ; an increase of 116 per cent. l<'rom these data, it is quite eddent that money-gold as well as notes-has depreciated greatly in value, and that the present currency has not more than three-fifths the power of getting work accomplished or the purchasing value of the currency of 18:>8. The average appropriation for the Coast Survey for the ,vears 1856 aml '57, '57 and '58, '58 and '59, '59 and '60, was $.337,000, equal in value to $895,000 in 1874. The appropriation for 1874-'75 is, for the regular work, but $706,000 equal in value to about $423,600 in 1858, or about 27 per cent. less in value than the average appropriations for the years above named. To the work of tlJ.e Coast Survey in its earlier years, others-its natural outgrowth-have been added, for which appropriations have been made and are now estimated for, in additiou to the classes of work for which ap1lropriatious were made in 18.'iS. De(lucting- tllese portions of tile appropriation from the total., the aggregate amount estimated for the year 1875 and '76 would lie less in value than the average appropriations for the years 1856 and '57, '57 and '58, '58 and '59, '59 and '60, by $140,000, or more tban 16 per cent. less than the estimates submitted. With an increase of 25 per cent., the results can be increased 65 per cent.; for, as the constants of expense for the whole work remain nearl;y the same, almost tbe entire additional amount can be applied directly to field-work and to the production of charts and maps.
VESSELS.

In the years 1856 and '57, '57 and '58, '58 and '59, '59 and '60, the Coast Survey, by the genius of 1Ias11ler and Bache, had developed into a fixed organization, for the support of which <Jongress made almost constant equal appropriations, averaging for these former years $537,000 per annum. The war, by withdrawing the naval officers, who had by law, when they could be supplied by the Navy Department, the execution of the hydrography, added to which many of the civil assistants of the work were employed as topographical officers to several corps of the Army operatiug in different parts of the country, disarranged this organization. Although the system of the organization was thus materially interfered with, the work continued upon ite old basis, notwithstanding various efforts made by my predecessor since the close of the war to restore the conditions of tbc organization as it existed in the years referred to before the war; but from the want of sr·fficient appropriations to supply the deficiencies in the number of vessels, the inability of the Navy Department to furnish the required number of officers, and other causes, the restoration of the conditions referred to has not been possible. The law requires that the hydrography of the Coast Survey shall be executed by officers and men of the Navy when they can be furnished.

4

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

It is my duty, and I am most anxious, to carry this law fully into effect, and the Na>y Department now stands ready to supply the required complements; but there is a great deficiency of vessels forthe purpose, aud estimates are snhmittt>d for bnt two \essels more than Congress deemed necessary in 1858. It has l.Jeen officially stated in letters, from the honoral.J1e Secretary of the Navy and from tlle Treasury, tllat no vessels of the classes required for Coast-Survey work can be supplied, either from tlie :S- avy or from the Re>eu ue l\Iarine. The absolute necessity for more ye;,sels for the ntpid execution of the work is evident from the following compari,,;on; only two more than wer·e used in 18.58 beiug· estimated for:In 1858, tlw Coast Sun·ey had five sea-going steamers on tlle Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Iu 187 ±, there are but two, witll one building. Estimates for two more are submitted to raise the number to that of 1808. In 18J8, the Coast Survey had twenty-fiYe schooners and small steamers on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Iu 1874, there are twenty-four. In 1858, before the work was full,V organized there, the Uoast Survey had on the Pacific coast one sea· going steamer and three schooners, quite sufficient then for the scale of work upon that coast. 111 1874, thPre are one sea-going steamer and three schooners, two of them too old and decayed to Lie trusted at sea. In t,he last fow years, under the dirnetiou of wy immediate predecessor, this portiou of the work bas rapidly progressec1; but, from waut of vessels, tile shore-work has advanced greatly beyond the ilydrogrnphy, and now over three hundred miles of the landwork of the coast is finished, awaiting tlle c.omplet.ion of the hydrography in order that maps aud charts may be issued. This ily<lrography can, of course, onl;y be accomplished by vessels, which the Coast Survey lms uot, nor the means to obtain them. In 1858, all the >e8sels were comparath'ely new, none being over eight or nine years old. In 1874, thern are twelve from eighteen to twenty-five years olll, rotten, worn out, and worthless, utterly valueless for any use, reducing the available number to nineteen, compared to thirtyfour in 1858. Witll the number of Yessels estimated for, and the sale of the twel\e useless ones, the total number of vessels in the Coast Survey would be thirty-six; the total in 1858 having been thirtyfour. The number of vessels on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts will he decreased; the number on the Pacific coast will be increased; but the total uurnber for all coasts will be but two more than in 1858. "'-itl10u t some uuexpectetl casual ties, no more special appropriations for the construction of Ycssels will be required to complete the survey of the present limits of the coasts of the United States; and appropriations for those for wllich estimates are submitted are urged from the positive necessities of the work; and, besides, it must be considered that a full year must elapse after the appropriation beeomes available before the vessels can be ready for use. The averag·e receipts from the customs for the years 1857, '38, '59, and '60 were $52,106,740.56. In 1873, these receipts were $188,089,522.70, or 261 per cent. increase in gold. The increase of Coast Survey appropriation, reduced to gold, is but 11 per cent. Although. these relatiYe amounts are not entirely logical as bearing on the appropriation for the Coast Survey, yet they tend to show with what rapidity our external commerce has increased and is increasing, amassing, with the coastwise trade, figures which but a few years ago would have been deemeu incredible; and they also ternl to show the imperative necessity of completing the survey of our coasts in the shortest possible time consistent with proper economy and due accuracy of work. The same ratio of appropriation for the Coast Snn·ey to the custom-receipts in 1874 and '75 as obtained in 1858 would give $1,938,570, or more than LOO per cent. over the amount for which estimates are submitted. The enormous extent of the coasting-trade along the coasts of the United States, now estimated to exceed forty millions of tons transported per annum, demands for its greater security the speediest completion of the work, as is evidenced from the constant calls upon the office for detailed charts and sailing-directions of those ports of the coast not yet surveyed. The es.timates submitted are based upon the actual necessities of the w"ork, the constantly increasiug demands for charts of the uufinished parts of the coast, and the value of the average appropriations made by Congress in the years 1856 and '57, '57 and '58, '58 and '59, '59 and '60, after years of trial, deliberate investigation, full

discussion, and matnrejudgment. The work is essentially temporary in character, the number of miles of coast known, the cost and time for completio11 a mere question of arithmetic. 'l'he present purchasing value of currency is not more than tllree-fifths of that in the yt-an; above named. The a\erage appropriations for these years was $337 ,oon, au cl that amou11 t is tliree-tifths of $895,0flO for work of the classfls executed in 185S. To this <t1LI $l+OJIOil for work s'.nce added and required, and we have a total of $1~035,000; tile total amonnt t·stimated for is SS!.l:j,00(); less by $142,000, or 14 per cent. The work cannot vroceed with proper economy and speed without a proper supply of yes:-1els, and estimates for but two more are submitted thau are required to 1·estore the etiieient 1111mber actually in the Coast Snn·ey in 18.38. 'Vith all the vessel;.; eompleted for which estimatf'S an~ sulJ. mittecl, there will be reqnired, in addition to the regular estiurnte:,; suhmittt>ll fur tlH· y1·ar 1.-;7,j and '76, about $7 5,000, or a total of $\WS,000, with which auunal appropriati011 the wlwlc :,;mTcy of tlte coast can be completed iu twelve years; le;:wing no farther work to lie ex:ecnte\l ex:C)ept the puhlishiug of charts, results of the work, and the resurveying of the ehange:tlJle h:irbor,; and portio11s of the coasts, which would involve no great expense. Good charts, ligh t-honses, and hnoys, uy remlering navigation safe, reduce the expenses ofiusur· ance, detention, pilotage, etc., and thus chea,pen transportatinu. Iu the eoa8tiug-trade alone, of 40,000,000 tons, valued at only $30 per ton, equal to $1'lOO,OOO,OOO, if tl1e expense8 of it:-; tra11.~por tatiou are reduced by one per cent. uvon its value, we hrwe ~·sum of $~,Of)(),()()() per aun tun saved, or double the annual cost of the Coast SunTe.Y and light-house system comliined, or on·r eight times tlrn cost of the Coast Survey, if its anuu:d cost was w he ceaseless, i11stf~:ul of elJ(liug i11 t1velve ,H·ars. Feeling confident tliat Congress wishes the speedy termination of thiH work as a nwasnre of necessity to our enormous and constant!,\' increasing commerce, as weil as a matter of general utilit,r and economy, and trusting for its ap1no\-al, I ha>e deemed it my dnty to submit, th<·s<· estimates for the most rapid and economical completion of tlle surves of the coa:-;t,; of tho Uuited State,,;. In the detailed estimates, the work for the fiscal year e11tling ,Tune 30, 187G, will be statetl in geographical order, beginu ing ou the Atlantic coast of the Uuited State8 at the nortlieastern l1om1d · ary, and terminating on the coast of 'J'exas. On the Pac1iJlc coast, th!:' sitt·s will be named iu the reverse order, beginning at San Diego and terminating with the coast of Alaska. As a practical illustration of the estimat.es, au abstract is here presented, showing the sites in which the fieJJ.work and hydrography are now in progress, and iuclmling mention a]s() of the localities iu wllich the same parties worked during last winter and spring in the southern sections of tlle Atlautic and Pacific coasts, and on the Gulf coast of the United States.

No meutiou bas been made e'l·en of errors much larger tbau mig!Jt ltave been expected, as iu g·eueral the errors 011 the :StatP maps ha\·e been found within certam limit:,;. Iu fact, tltey were at the outset the ouly guide in ni:trki11g out the limits of sheett> for tile plaue table parties, arnl genemll.1 tlwy ha.-e availed for that purpm;e. It has happened otherwise, bowe\·er. \Vithi 11 the present seasun, a topographieal Rh1,et, intended to clefiue the shores of an inlet of moderate sizL~, tlrnngh lll'l~jecte11 wit.!1 duf\ allowa11e1' for errors on the general map, was found insufficient iu limits for the intended purpose. As n·gard;,; fixed dangt>rs iu 11a\'igatio11, it nemls n<'t to be specially [)Ointed out that the lhweloprncnt, by accurate SUJTP.Y of a bank near them may be a safeguard; the direction of the danger and it-: distance in some cases being known from the depth found b,v snunding on the bank, e\'l'll iu a dense fog. Casual dangers in naYigatio11, such as 1m11ke11 wreeks, or spars projecting from them, are properly, and have not been less than permanent ob:,;tacles, :,;nbjects of attention in the operati<111s of the hydrographic partie:,;. If near a frequented channel, the la1·ger parts of wreck, wht'n brokl'11 and moved b_y the sea, are traced by sonndiugs until the wreck is known to be in 'leep water; or, if not broken, the site of the danger is developed lJy soundings, tile position is ca.reflllly determined, allll notice of the danger is given in the usual printed form, as in the case of a newly-discovered rock or dangerous shoal. In the operations of the present year, tbe following items lrnve bee11 speeially mentio11ed in reports from the chiefs of hydrographic parties: 1. Rock found, with oul;\' seyen feet of water on it, in the cbaunel between Half 'Yay Rocks and Star Island, Isles of Sbnals, N. II. 2. A shoal spot Oil tbe south side of the Swash Channel, New York Ba,,-, determined iu posi tiou. 3. !tocks oft' Point Loma, coast of California, having two fathoms less water on them than had been previously reported. 4.

COAST PILOT.

'.rhough an known dangers to naYigation are marked upon the charts, mariners ha\·e by loug usage relied much on printed lists of obstacles uear tlwir sailing-conrt>es; somewhat also on pictorial -oriews; and as much 011 descriptions of proper sailing-lines and of the appearaucc1 of the coast and harbor-entrances. These last-named faeilities, and especiall~' compressed li:,:ts of dangers, are eagerly sought, beca11se the.r g-h·e inRtant knowledge of the character of tlw waters to be trasersed, and because they lessen the risk that an.r one danger, though marked ou tl1e chart, ma~' be overlooked by the navigator. The issue of a Coast Pilot, comprising printed notes based u110n the actual systematic den~lop me1it of the coast l>.r surve,ys, bas Ul'en properly flpferred nntil the connection of work done separatel.)in many localities admits of continuous descriptiou. Several years ago, one of tbe parties in serdce afloat was assigned to inspect t!Je coast of New England, with local and general charts of the Coast Sur-my in hand; to test the charts, examine the dangers, prove the sailing-courses by trial, and to compile notes aiul descriptions. These were ananged by the party for publication, and have been issued in a volume which contains sailiugdirections, etc., for the coast and harbors hetween Nova Scotia and Cape Uod, and generally for the body of water known as the Gulf of Maine. This party i1:1 now engaged in the same service on the coast between Boston and New York.

These tables show the time of high water aml the heiglit of tiue for each day of the ~year. ~.\..similar epbenwris for the year 187 5 has already been priutPcl, au<l copies are now iu the hands of ag·euts, who are authorized to dispose of tliem at a cost to tL<" purchaser so moderate as to bring the information within the reach of all inquirnn;;. 'rlw Hame ag»'nts are authorized to sell the published charts of the Survey at the principal ports of the UuitP<l States. As an appeudix to this I'eport, a compreheusi\'c paper by 1\lr. William Ferrel, of the Tidal Division, has beeu printed separately. In addition to modifications and impro\emeut iu the gPneral theory of thP titles, 1\fr. l<'euel's rest'arcbes present various developmeuts of the tidal forces, determiriatiou:-; of <:o-eflicie11ts and arguments in the different terms of the developments, and also equatious of cutfllition for a,;certaining from obsen'ation for eacli tidal station the uukuown constants in the corresporn1ing tidal PXlJrt'Sl'iious. .As the resnlt of much practical work, improved methods are give11 for discussing tidal obsen-atious. These will be specially applicable to the :several lung series coutaiuell in the tidal records of tbe Coai;t SurYey, anll will in time avail further, as other ser]es fill up, in the formatiou of tallies and formnlIB for predicting the tides at various stations aloug the coast of the United States with increaserl precision.
M.A.GNETISM.

111 regard to the secular change of the magnetic declination, a discussion of much value has been added by Assistant Clrnrlt·s A. Schott, and is given in the Appendix (No. 8). The collection of obHernttious of the deviation of tlie magnetic needle, which he has coutiu ucd for some years, is given iu the same paper iu snd1 form as to render the results convenient for furnishing comp:tsses for our charts. It will he ,;een by the paper here refer:L·ed to that the empirical law of the secular change is marked with a considl'ntble degree of reliability; its uuiforrn operation being referable to any date in the list ol' reconle<l ohsern1tio11s. Tlte secular change is so expressed as to give tlte means for bringing up the obsen-eu <l!'cli1rntiou at any time anll place to what it would he at preseut, or at any other dat,e within the range of recorded observations. The older observations, rwoved by the application of the law, thus iu some cctses avail, as well as recent determinations, for coni;tructing charts to show lines of eqnal m~tgr1etic declination for any de.sired epoch. B1~sides the obvious use of the tli,.:cussiou for assigning the variation of the magnetic needle in the use of charts, the paper is otllcrwise of }H'rmaueut value. The compilatfon of all the recorded observations at important places, from the earliest down to the present time, must al wa,ys remain as the foundation for testing theories concerning the secular change [Jf the magnetic <lecliuation, a subject which is yet imperfectly nll<lerstood. The usual annual determination of the maguetic elements was made by .Assistant Schott in .Tune, at the istatiou on Capitol Hill, iu V\' asl1ington City. The ol.Jject of this series of ohservations has bee11 explaim'd in previous annual reports, aull it suffices here to say that the law of change heretofore recognized continues to hold,.good. Auother paper by Assistant Schott, in the Appendix. (No. 9), results from elaborate discussion of the ahsnlnte measures of rnagnP-tic declination, dip, and intensity, and of the differential observations for declination reconh·d at Key \Vest, between the years 1860 and 1866, with Brooke's self. registering in1:1tmments. Tlie late Professor Bache, when Superintendent of the Coast Survey, bad the apparatus set up tltere, remote from Toronto and Philadelp!Jia, in order to secure a series Of results tltat would sliuw variations, dLte to geograpllical positio11, in the laws by which the motion of the magnetic needle h,; governed. Uncler uncertainty in regard to pllblic affairs, Key West, ou the Florida Reef, was selected in 1860 in preference to a station on the \Vestern coast. The maintenance, moreover, of a l'!tation on tbe Pacific for the contemplated period of six years would have entailed at tbat time a disproportionate expenditure; but, as the \Vestern series is desirable, arrangements for it will be kept in view.

Under this provision of law, Prof. Rm1jami11 Peirce had taken an acti\·e part. in the delitwrati1J11s of the commission. \Yuen preparations had so fa1· advanced as t.o arlmit, of the organiza.tio11 of tilt· obsen·ing-parties, it was decided that, of tl1e eight parties to be sent out, two shoLlid be directed by officers of the Naval Ol:lsernttory ; two otlit>rs under the charge of officers nf the Coast Snr,·ey; two l>y astronomers from Civil life; one by a11 officer of the Army; and one b.'! an officer of the Navy.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

When the duty of acting as a mern ber of the Transit Commission de,·olvcd upon me, the general arraugements were alrea,dy far advance(l. Except in regard to some protipective details for the guidance of partif's at their stations, it rrm1ained only to perfect the organization of the parties and expedite their departure. In order to secure uniformity in practice, and to test the instruments which had been selected for use by the several parties, all the iutendetl observers and their as'lil;tants were assembled at ""\V;tsbington in May. Messrs. Davidson and "rittmann came east from Sau Francisco and attended the personal conference of observers at the Naval Obsernttory. Sul.Jassistant Smith sailell with his party from New York on the 10th of clune, in the United States steamer Swatara, with several of the parties destined for stations other than Chatham Island. Professor Davidson with lliil party left San Francisco on the ~()th of August, and, according to recent addces, is now settl1~d at his i11tencled Htation in Japan. The obsen·ations rnalle iu 1769 by Cl1appe d'Auteroche in Lower California on the transit of Venus could not be made to yield their full valiw while a large uncertainty remained in regard to the position occupied by that observer at San Jose del Uabo. The ,-eracity of his observat;o_ns is prO"\Nl by the satisfactory results Uerived from the use Of his record of the observed "duration" Of the transit; but the introduction of the absolute time of either tile ingress or egresR was not practicable in a1hauce of a good determination of the longitude of the place occupied l.Jy the ol.Jser·er in 1769. Assistant George Da,idson, after searching all Hie printed narratives concerning the observations made in r~ower California, visited San Jos6 de! Oabo in the spring of 1873, and, by careful and thorough cxamiuation, ideutified the station at which Chappe bad ohser,f>d the transit of 1769. The results, including also tletermirnttious of the latitude and longitude of the place, are given in Appendix No. 10. It is hoped that the addition thus malle to the record will enable astronomers to realize the full value of the observations made l.Jy Chappe. "\'\'hatever other exact methods for determining the solar parallax may now ue aYailaule, tbe results yielded by each of the obseiTed transits of Venus must hold a prominent place, so lung as tlie existence of so-called constant errors in any method remains uncertain, or so long as such errors reveal themselves only in the comparison of results b_y independent methods. Hence the question involved in the observations ma.de at San Jose del Uabo is not one of merely historical interest.
LIGHT-HOUSE BO.ARD.

As far as possil.Jle, the purposes of the Light-House Board have been aided, as in former years, either by the Yolnntary action of memherR of the Survey in cases of emergency, or by their services under the direction of the Superintendent, in order to meet special calls for information. The frequent displacement of buoys; the means needful for identifying their places; determinations of the position of light-houses and of marks set as aids in navigation ; tracings of the sites in ques. tion or selected for the construction of new light-houses, and other requirements bearing on the interests of commerce, keep up the intimacy of relation that necessarily exists between these two branclrns of the public service. This interchange, fostered for years by the as8ociation of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey as a member of tile Light-House Board, became more direct when my predecessor, Prof. Benjamin Peirce, accepted the chairmanship of the committee on lighting. The duties thus devolved were discharged continuously until February of the present year, when, upon bis resignation, Professor Peirce was replaceu, in tue board aud as l'hairman of the committee on lighting, by m:yself. During the past year, my personal attention has been given to the uetails which of necessity come before that committee in ad Yance of the expenditure of any means for alterations or for construction.
INSTRUMENTS.

Among various devices for detaching the heavy weight needful in deep-sea soundings, the metbod proposed by Lieutenant-Commander Sigsbee, and described in .Appendix No. 14, invites attention by its simplicity.

in the Coast Survey, in the sten,mer Blake. Lieutenant-Commauder Sigsbeo will be a:-;sochited in the same party, and per;;o11ally snpen·ise the operations in deep-Hea hydrograph,Y, which include also the application of Lis irnproYement ill apparatus for controlliug the descent of the liue or wire used in soundings. In Appendix ~o. 13 will be found an exhibit f~fforable to wishes that haYe beell loug entertained in regard to economy in the use of coal for steaming at sea. Of the various instruments for measuriug i1llgles, the sextaut finds the most extensi\·e nHe in the Coast SurVl\Yi each llydrogra.phic party requil'ing at le~tst two obsen·en; with the s1·xta11t uow in use in order to secure simuitanmm1< determinations of the two a11gles which are iIJrli,.;L1en,,alile for determining the position of the sounding· vessel. This neeessity ha" induced 1<card1 for an l'Xpedient by which the two augles can \Je taken by one obserYer. The first i;tep in this direction wa8 made by Lieuteuaut (now Commander) P. C .·Tohusou, l:7nite1l States NaYy, wheu in Coast SurYey serYice in the steaUJer .ActiYe. Ile acl<letl a slidiug Rtop, wl1ich could he clamped to the grad uate<l arc in coutael with the iude:x-arm. B_Y merely secnl'ing tlrns the position of the vernier for the firnt aIJgle obsen·ed, the loss of time between the two ohsen-ations occasioned by the readiug of the first angle cau be avoided, as the vel'nier cau be sPt back, and the reading taken after the second observation has been completed. Two such stops, one ou eaeh side of the vernier, rnnder it indifforeut whether the greater or less angle is measured urnt, aud relien~ the observer from tlie uece8sity of deciding that (]Ue8tion. The time, howe,er, that still uece8· sarily elapses between the two observations, during which the boat changes its place, rcndcrii the method insufficient for very accurate work. Within the year, :\fr. T. J. Lowry, aid in the Coast Survey, has Sttggestctl several impro>e meuts, by means of which sextaut-angles between 1400 and 1800 can be obsen-ed, and two augli'S can be taken by one obsen-er at, the same instant or in quick succession. The first objt'ct is ae<~om plished by making the hack as well as the front face of the index-glass reflecting, by :tdtliug 1~0° to the reading of the arc whene\'er the back face of the index-gla~s is the refiectiug ;;;tuface, aud by Jllacing a secon<l horizon-glass 011 the line of sight at ;mch an angle as to reflect tile ra_ys from the hack of the index-glass parallel to the linf> of sight_ To make the sex taut capable of measuring two angles, one to the right and the other to the left of the central object, iu quick succession, M:r. Lowry proposes to make the arc of the instrument 1200 instead of 600, as in the ordinar~- sextant; the graduation to be num bere<l in opposite direc. tions from oo to 1200, it being actually 600 from each zero. Each arc carries its own imlt,x-arm antl iudex-glass, having the horizon-glass in common. The index-arms may lrn ,-e the i;ame or different centers of motion. In tlle first ease, the glasses may he mouutrnl, either one a hon~ the other or at the same level, bs making each ouly half the ordinary width, tlwir inner edges joining. Another form of sextant has been suggested hy 1\lr. Lowry, b,\- which two auglrs, one to the right and the other to the left of an ohjPct, can be quick!J· measured. By placiug an additional index-glass over the ordinary one Ht an angle of 60°, angles to the right of the line of si~ht C<lll be measured, zero reading 1200 on the graduation of the colllmon sextant. The first angle obsen·ed may be secured by a detachable stop, similar to that, first. proposed by Lieutenant Johnson. The design for a reflecting-instrument, submitted by Charles Junkeu, assistant iu t!Je Coast Survey, provides for measuring two angles at the same time. This instrument is equiYalent to two sextants, mounted upon the same plane, with the telescope in commou. The horizon-glassel' are placed one above the other; the index-glasses, index-arms, and graduated arcs are attached sym. metrically to each side of the line of sight. ln either of the devicet> for the simultaneous measurement of two angles, one index-arm is put at such an angle that the image of one of the reflt>ctm1 objects will fall near the central object, and be carried toward it by the motion of the ship. Bs means of the tangent-screw attached to the other index-arm, the image of tbr, t,hird object is kept iu contact with tho central o~ject until the first image becomes coincident with the eeutral object_ Improvements of the kiud here mentioned can have practical value ouly aftPr the_y ha\"c been fully tested by experience. The expense being small, the construction of a model has been autLorized, to combine the main .features of the in·oposed improvements.

Tidal observations.-The series of tidal and meteorological observations begun in January, 1870, at North Haven, in the entrance to Penobscot Bay, Me., bas bee11 cai·efully continued throughout the present year by Mr. J. G. Spaulding. His success in preserving unbroken the register of high and low waters, and the regularit.r and good form of the curves traced by the self.registering gauge, indicate that the position is fa\·oraule for the observations. This station is furuisued with duphcate interchangeable cylinders, reading-box, and con>eniences for regularly tabulating the readings of high and low waters, and hourly ordinates from curves as they are traced by the self-registering apparatus. At tLe Boston navy-j'ard, the observer, Mr. H. Howland, has continued as heretofore the series of tidal and meteorological obserYatious. The gauge in nse at this important station is one of the best of the old form, aud, as far as possible, is guarded against stoppage by attacbed heating. apparatus for use during winter. In general, the series has been well preserved. A tide-gauge of the new form remains at Providence, R. I., where it was placed at the request of tbe city authorities. Last summer, the instrument was refurnished for continuing observations needed in the adjustment of leYels in the local surveys; the running expenses, as heretofore, being met by the city. The apparatus and records will be returned to the Ooast Sur>ey Office, aud will be of special use for comparison with the several short series of tidal observations recorded by sounding-parties while the hydrography of Narragansett Bay was in progress.

While sounding in the vicinity ol the Swash Channel, New York Ba,y, Assistant Nes found a shoal spot with less water than bad been previously known. In order to determine tbe quei;tion whether or not similar lumps existed in the channel, a careful developuwnt was made by close soundiugs within an area of about four square miles, including the course through the Swash. These confirm in general the results of previous surv.,ys, and, in addition, re\·eal the existence of a small spot, with only 16~ feet of water, on tbe west side of the Swash Channel. In the field-operations of last year were included ouservations which served for determining the exact geographical position and length-of the boundary-line between the States of New Jersey and New York. Due acknowledgment for that service has been made by the authorities of the first.named State, at whose instance the work was performed.

For all the harbors \1·hieh hail not bt>m1 prnYionsly visited, sailing-lines were tested, am! desc1·iptions of the eutrauces were added to the material already on hand, for an a(Jditional >olume of the Coast Pilot. This i,;erdce iu tlic Ulle::iapcake was completed in January, after which the party passed southward of Caple Henry for tlut.r, which will be the subject of notice under the head of Section IV. During the summer, ~~s,;istant Bradford was engaged in Section II. Topogmphy near Washington, D. 0.-Iu April last, at the reqnest of Captai11 Jeffers, Chief of the Bureau of Ordna11ee, Cnitetl States NaYy, a minute san·ey was made of the site of the naval magazine at Marbury Point on the Potomac River. Subassistant Joseph llergesheimer, who was detailed for tliii,; senic«, carefully developed the ground surface by lines of level, and mapped the topogm1>hical features on a scale ample for any purpose desired in drainage or construction. By curves of equal ele>ation for ernr,r foot difference of level above high-water line, the sheet shows minutels the irregularities of surface. 011 two plaue-t.alilP sheets of previous Reasons, Mr. Hergesheimer traced the recently-constructed liue of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad within the District of Columbia, and mapped the topography between th0 road and the Potomac shore-line. Among the details shown uy this survey are the ""as!Jiugton approach of the Baltimore :;tnd Potomac lfailroad east of the tunnel, and surface-features in the vicinity, which will appPar in the next issue of the engraved chart of the Potomac Ri \·er. Subassistaut Hergesheirncr, during the summer, conducted a plane-table party in Section I. Trfongul,ation of the Potomac Riiier, Ya.-The local triangulation made of the Upper Potomac, b.r .Assistant J. A. Sullivan in 186! has been connected with the primary work at Sugar Loaf· :Mountain, on ,,·bich the station first occupied was found to be nearly coincident with the point subsequently (letermim;d in the progre,;s of the general geodetic opera'.ious. Early in July, Mr. Sullivan went to his station of 1864, and carefully determined its position relative to two primHy poiuts, which were occupied a fow years ago by Assistant Boutelle, one on that mountain and the other on Maryland Heights. After measuring the horizontal angle, Assistant Sullivan ascertained the exact distance (a little over twent.r-five feet) between his station of 1864 and the primary· triangulation point on Sugar Loaf Mountain. His st1bsequent service in the field has been mentioned under Section II. Tr·ia1igulatian in progress.-T!Je party of .Assistant .A. T .. Mosman, aided by Mr. D. S.

Sup11lcmentary hydrography.-In order to complete the chart of Elizaht>th Hiver, Va., a party will be sent in charge of Mr. J. B. Baylor to sound the passage back of Craney Island. As in other cast~s in which work is begun after the close of the fiscal year, which ended with June, further mention of the work executed will be reserved for my next annual report. Tidal observations.-A self-registering tide.gauge of the nflw form, with interchangeable cylinders, reading-box, and also facilities for tabulating tile record, has been substituted for the appa. ratus formerly in use at Old Point Comfort, Va. Mr. \V. J. Bodell remains in charge as observer, and has well maintained the continuity of the record, notwith&tanding the instability of the place at which the apparatus was of necessity fixed. For the penrlulum, a balance-wheel Las been substituted in the clock of the gauge. As a result, the clock has not been easily stopped, as it was in former years, and the tidal record is correspondingly improved. SECTION IV.
ATLANTIC COAST AND SOUNDS OF NORTH CAROLINA, INCLUDING SE.A.PORTS AND RIVERS.-(SKETc:e:
No. 7.)

Coast Pilot.-Assistant J. S. Bradford, with bis party in the schooner Palinnrus, sailed from Oape Ilenry on the 18th of February, bound for Charleston, with a view of noting such particulars in navigation as might be recommended to coasters. During the run, l.Jeavy weatl.Jer prevailed, with mist and rain. Tl.Je expedients thereby necessitated for the management of his vessel proved worthy of record as to the proper course to be run by coasters in ti.tick weather to clear the Lookout and Frying Pan Shoals. Soundiugs were taken as the vessd approached these dangerous banks, and observations were recorded as to the set and drift of the current in crossing Long Bay and Onslow Bay. In the next section, mention will be made of the furtl.Jer operations of the party in the Palinurus. Tr,iangulation and hydrography of Chowan River, N. 0.-The worn-out steamer Hetzel, which had been used as a hulk for several seasons by parties working in this scctiun, as mentioned in previous reports, sunk at her anchorage in Edenton Bay last ant11mn ; but no other vessel being available, at the opening of winter, for service in this quarter, direction was given for raisiug the vessel. By the middle of Decemher, 1873, Assistant R E. Halter, having put the uulk in condition to serve as quarters for his party, proceeded np Chowan River, and made a triangulation from its mouth inland to a point twenty-eight miles from the head of Albemarle Sound, deterrnitling positions for use in the hydrograph,y. The waters of the Chowan, within the same limits, were suuseqnently sounded by the party. Messrs. C. L. Gardner and C. H. Fitch served as aids. The following are statistics of this survey :

Palfrey served as aid. Operations with the plane-table adnwced as points were furnished by the triang11latim1. On the weRt side of the river, the parallel road passing south from Coleraine was taken in as the limn of the marginal topography, and surface-features el::1ewhere were map11ed to the same average distancP from the shore-line. The vicinity of Eden1011 is included on the planet.able sheet, aud all improvements 011 both s]des of the river to points as high up as Harrcl's \\rharf, or about thirty miles from the entrance of the Chowan. The topographical sheet represents five steamboat-landings, at which the large amount of cotton brought from the back counties i8 shipped for Norfolk a.nd Baltimore. Much local interest was manifested while this survey was in progress. Field-work was closed by Assistant Adams in thii; section at the end of 1\-Iay.

[n Ju~e, this party was transferred to the coast of Maine, for service which has been mentioned under the head of Section I. Triangulation of Pamplico Sound, N. 0.-The party of Assistant G. A. Fairfield has been continuously employed in this work without transfer, as in other cases ou account of chauge in the season. When the last annual report was closed, the party occupied Egg Shoal, a station in the vicinity of Hatteras Inlet. Horizontal angles were measured during the winter; and, early in January, Assistant Fairfield moved to Long 81.loal .Point. A.tall tile stations, high platforms ba'e bet·n erected of necessity, to bring into view the signals on the opposite shore of the sounrt.

It is confidently expected that the triangulation of Pamplico Sound will be finally connected with the primary base.line iu the course of the ensuing spring. Topography of Pamplico Sound, N. C.-Tbe work of Assistant C. T. Iardella in this section defines the north shore of Pamplico Sound eastward of the entrance to Pamplico Rh·er; and, extending in that direction, it includes Swan Quarter Island and indentations known ai; Bell's Bay, Rose Bay, Swan Quarter Bay, Juniper Bay, and others. The plane-table sheet represcnr.s the roads and other surface.features adjacent to the shore-line. The bays embraced in this survey afford safe anchorage for vessels drawing seven or eight feet water. In reference to the character of the shores, the field-report states that "the section of country from Pungo River to Swan Quarter is very thickly settled, and each of the fine farms along the main road is traversed by ditches, through which the farmers transport their g1'ain and prornnder in small boats, to load vessels that remain at anchor in the several bays".

ATLANTIC COAST AND SEA-WATER CHANNELS OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, INCLUDING SOUNDS, HARBORS, AND RrVERS.-(SKETCU No. 10.)

Coast Pilot.-In this se1~tion, Assistant J. S. Bradford, in the schooner Palinurus, examined, with reference to safe line!:! for navigation, all the harbors betweeu Georgetown, S. C., and Savannah. His notes made in the course of the season will appear in a subsequent Yolurue of the Coast Pilot, of which the first volume has been some time in hand for publication. After visiting and iuspt>cting the entrances of Winyah Bay, Bull's Bay, Charleston Harbor, Stono lnlet, North Edisto, Saint Helena Sound, Port Royal Sound and its rivers, and Savannah H.iver, and verifying the sailing directions, Mr. Bradford returned to Norfolk at the end of April, and subsequently was engaged in Section II.

TIJe planf'-btble sheet, which adjoins the sun·ey here under notice, and on which Assistant Dennis had traced the outli:1es of rfoe.ficlds as they appear in the vicinity of North Santee and South Santee IUvers, was reproduced by photolithography in the course of last winter. Tue fidelity, accuracy, aml finish of the map are specially mentioned by the resideuts to whom the few copies printed wt>re sent. lu one of tlJe acknowledgments is the followi11g remark: "This accuracy is the mort> snrpri,.;ing when it is considered that ou two-thirds of the rice.fidd the banks are overgrown with we<'< Is m1rl briers. The results shown on the map coulcl not have been attained without the most unremitting iudm;tr,Y, patience, and skill on the part of J\fr. Deunis and bis aid.'' Astronomical u7J8l'Yl'<1UonH at Sa Nrnnalt, Gn.-'l'he astronomical statio11 at Sa\"auuah was occupied in the spring of tlte present yeat' by Assistant 11'. Blake, for t,lie exchange of clock-signals, to cktermine the longitude of points on the western coai:;t of the Florida Peninsula, of which special mention will he 111ade i11 the nf'xt chapter. At the same time., the occasion was taken to <letermine finally the longitude of SaYamiall by the exchauge of clock-signals with the United States Xaval Observatory a~ V\"ashi11gto11, D. U., at which the obi;;ervations were con1lucted by Professor Harkness and I'rofe;,;sor Eastnuu1. The ai1l in tl1e party at Sa\'annab, Mr. Clwrles Tappan, recorded obsern1tions from January 26th until the :3d of April. In that interval, l\fr. Blake exchanged clock-signals on i:;ix uighti:; with the Naval Olrnernitor.r; on four nights, with an observer who sent signals by telegraph from a statio11 at Prmta Hasa, near the entrance to Charlotte Harbor; on five nights, with the same observer when at Cedar Keys; aml 011 six nights, wheu the observer, Subassistant Edwin Smith, occupied a station at. Atlanta, Ga. For clock and instrumental corrections, 340 star-transits were obsen·ed at San1mrnh hy upward of 5,000 observations. Assistant Blake determined relative personal equation w~th the \Vashington observers on three nights in April at the ~aval Observatory. The personal equation relative to Mr. Smith had been previously determined. Telegraphic facilities, free of charge, for the determinations made in this section and Sections VI and VII, were afforded b,y John Van Horne, esq,, superintendent of the \Vestern Union Telegraph li11es, whose name in precediug reports has been associated with similar instances of enlightened liberality. The field-report mentions also the courteous generosity of T. A. Brenner, esq., division superintendent of the telegraph company; and of the Hon. D. L. Yulee, superintendent of the Florida Railroad, by which the se\·eral telegraph circuits reqnisite for tlrn astronomical work were placed at the disposal of Assistant Blake. Since the return of the party in April, Mr. Blake has been engaged in computing results from the records of observations made for determining longitudfl in tlte previous seaimn. Mr. Tappan was, at the same time, assigned to field-service, of which mention will be made under the bead of Section VIL Speeh1l suri,ey of Ba.i,annah River, Ga.-The call made last year by the city authorities of Savau nah for a special survey of the ri \"er, with reference to the application of means for improving or preserviug the chanuel, was met by the assignment of Assistant Charles Hosmer, \Yith a party ill the schooner G. 1\1. BachP. Field-work was commenced on the 10th of December, 1873, and was continued until the 1st of 1\fay. The intended scale of the surves being large, triangulation was extended from T_ybee light-Louse upward to include about twent.r miles of the course of tlie rh·er, aud to furnii;IJ points sufficieut for detailed plane-table work. Between" Cross Tides'' and Elba faland, the survey was made on a scale of :rfoo; and that stretcl1 of the river is represented by four sheets. 13elow Elba Island, three sheets, on a scale of 50\ 0 , extend the work: to include Tyhee Light-House. · A8sistant Hosmer was aided in field,work and hydrography during the season by :Mr. J.

As bearing direct]~· upon the prncticability of preserving or impro\ing tlie rin'T-channels, the })bysical featnres of the lower part of tbe Sa\·anuah were examined by Assistant H. L. l\Iarindiu, under the gf'11eral direction of ARsistant Henry l\litchell, who could uot persouall:v attend for tliis dut.r, being in thf' spring engaged in public service on the Isthmus of Darien. In acconlauce with a plan of work previously arranged, :\It·. :'.'tiariudin, in l\Iay, made simultaneous obseryations in tbe Yicinity of Tybee Knoll along six tramn·erse Hues, uotillg till' currt'nts at fh·e or six stations in crm;sing tlie channels. The currents were also obserYed at stations between trans\-er;;e lines. Catch-hoxps werP placed in order to cletermine the source arnl d1anwter of tlrn material which is deposited by the action of tide,.; and currents on the bar. One of these, two weeks after being· sunk, was found to he nrarly full of material that had fouml way in at different times, the solid matter being in well-defined layers. In this particulttr case, which iH noted merely for its gf'neral con11Pcti011 with simih1r re8earch1'"1 that may be needm1 el8ewhere, Roft mml or sediment from still water was found i11 the bottom of the box, a1Jd, aboye that material, line aurl cnan·e layerR of sand, then layer;;; of dead vegetahlP matter, and again s:iud arnl mud; the tleposit in the box ha\'iug eYidently result!~d from varying agitations of tl1e water at the bottom of the rh·er. Thie ohsen·ations rccordPd h~- :\Ir. l\lariudiu will suffice for derh-iug transYerse cnn'es of ,-elocities, and hy snch nwans to Hhow tlie effect of t.hu shoa,1.s nn the cnrrents near the light-hons,~, as well as any prt>sent tendency in tlit' cnrrent8 to change the pby:>ical features tliat now mark tlie bar.

Amongst the questions pe11tli11g for the imprm·ement of the channel of the ri,·er is the practicability of din'rting iuto Fore Riw~r, abm·e tile city, part of the Yolume of water that now passes through Back Hfrer. Such ohserrntions as may be requisite for determiniug the question will be made, if possible, in tlie coming winter.

Pernandina Bar, Pla.-Iu the latter part of January and earl.\- in Ji'ebrnary, tl1e C!1tra11ce to Fernaudina was examined by Subassistan t F. D. Granger with a party in the steamer Eudean1r. At that period, as at all times generally, the best water that could be carried over the bar at mean low tide, was eleven feet. In refe.reuce to the resnl ts of this and previon8 examiuatiollt<, J\lr. Uranger reports: ''The soundings taken this season show two channels 01·er the lmr, which are separatetl by a central knoll of 7~ friet, the northern or buoyed chamiel being the wider. Iu tl1e southern channel, the width of the bar !Jetween the 12-feet cnrrns is eighty-fiye yards, while, in the buoyed channel, the width is about. four hnndrnd .rards." In the survey of 1869, the eltannel over the har was found to have thirteen feet of water, out tliat depth is not permanent. Tile channel tlien in use soon shoaled at the turning·point, and was abandoned; its buoss and !Jeacous being transforred to tbe channel as it is at present. In February, the guides to navigation were found t-0 be correctly located with reference to this channel. In the middle of April, JI.Ir. Granger, ha\'iug adv:wced the coast-hydrograpliy southward of Saint John's River Entrauee, returned to Fernandina, and commeuce<l a close survey of the bar. A tide-staff was set up at Old Town, ancl a mark on it was referred by le,·eling to the bcuch-marks use(l for the survey of 1870. The currents were obserYed at six stations. No changes of importance were developed by the suumlings. As compared with those of .Februa-r,Y, the depth on the bar was the same, giving eleven feet as the best water. At each of the current-statious, specimens of bottom were procured, showing that the bar is composed of fine and coarse sand mixed with

Longit11de-07J,9ervations at Ke.I/ lVest ana Punta Ra,Ya, Fla.-Subassistant Edwin Smith left New York early in December, 1873, for duty in thhl section, and made needful arrangements at Key ·west for exchanging clock-signals with the Naval Ob-<ervatory in 'Vashiugtou City. Exchange;;; of signals were begun on the 24tll of December, and were repeated on seven night,; preceuing- the 11th of January. In that interval, :Mr. Smith, and his aid, 1'Tr. ,J. R. Bciylor, recorded t\rn huJJ1lred and eleven observations on thirt~·-eight stars, to determine instrumental constant>; and errors of chronometers. The obserYations ma(fo ~Lt Key '>VPst were referred to Tift's Obsernitory. Mr. Baylor left Key \Vest on the 21st of .Tanuar,r to make arrangements for 'lt>termining the longitude of a point in tho triangulation of the wctit side of Florida Pcllinsnla at Punta Rasa, and was followed by Snbassistaut Smith at the end of the month. Clock-signals were exchanged on four nights '."\"ith Assistant Blake, who occnpied a station at, Sa,·annah, as alrea.d,v mentioned under the head of Section Y. Observations for determining iustrumental coustaut.s an<l errors of chronometers were recorded as usual at Puuta Hasa. This work was completed at the eud of February. After carefully markiug· nt Puuta Rasa the point which was determined in longitude, Suhassistant Smith and l\'Ir.

B. \Vain wright, the aid, in the ab,,;ence of the chief of the part.,v, who was detained b.Y fie1d-work in another section. l\Ir. Ogllen reached tlrn site of work on the 1st of Februar_y, aud, uutler disadvant>iges due to the weather which aftennird prevailed, pushed the triangnlat,iou, a:;;: far as practicable, up the Lmy. The topography nwauwhile wns advanced along the east shore from Anna M;iria Key northward to a st;1tion ahont six miles below :Mangrove Point. J>aJmasola Bay, .Manatee Rh-er, and Terraceia Bny 'IH\re included iu the plane-table snrYe;y. In rderriug to the operations in this quarter, :Mr. Ogden remarks: "The shores arc much broken, and many of tbe small bays and coves cannot be entered with a boat at low water. In April, a contrary difficulty was experienced; the water being so high that much of the conutry was snbmerged. Hence it was impossible to define the sand-bars or low-water line, and in many places the high-water line could be only approximatel_y traced." In April, Assistaut Ogden measured a check-base on Anna l\Iari1t Key, and found a satisfactory result by comparing it with the length deri\'ed by computing through the triangulation from the base at Clearwater Harbor. Eight signals were erected by the party in the course of the season for extending triangulation over Tampa Bay.

Two tide-ganges were erectt>d, oue at Egmont Key, the other at Hendrick's wharf in .Manatee Hh·er, and at both stations observa.tio11s were recorded while, soundings were in progress. The work of this year, on three sheets, extends the hydrography of Tampa Bay to a point somewhat beyond the present limit of the triangulation, or from tbe entrance npwar(l as for as .Man· grove Point. l\Ianatee River was sounrled by the party, and also the branches known as Terraceia Bay, Palmasola Bay, and Sarasota Bay. The work was discontinned at the end of April. Mes:srs. C. A. Ives and U. H.

Longitiu7e-ob.~en~ation.~ at Cedar Keys, Fla., mul at .Atlanta, Gn.-As stated in the preceding section, SubHssi8ta11t Edwin Smitl1, aud his aid, l\lr. J. B. Baylor, observed for longitude. by exchanging elnck-siguals from stations at Key West and at Punta Hasa; the last-namel1 statiou ueing at the entrance to Charlotte Harbor, on the western coast of the Florida Peninsula. After completi1;g these operations, the party proeeeded to Cedar Keys, and thPre set up a temporary observatory, arnl mounted the requisite· instruments. BPtween February 27 and the 8th of March, clock-signals were exchanged on five uights with Assistant Blake, who remained at Savannah; and 11iuety-five ohsen·ations were recorded on eight nights by Messrs. Smith and Baylor, to determine cLronometerrates and instrumental constants. The observations made at Cedar Keys were referred to the station which marks the north end of the hase-liue mellsnred in a former ;year for the surve.Y of that part of the Unlf coast. Facilities for the accommodation of the party were fnrnisl1e1l from the outfit of A.«sistant Mosman, who was then in camp near Cedar Keys. Leaving Cedar Keys on the 11th of l\farch, Snbassi!stant Smith reached Atlanta in the course of three da,ys, but was Jffe\·ented by a long-continued storm from observing for longitude until the 19th of that montJ.1. Betwee11 the Ulth and the laRt of March, clock-signals were successfnlly excha11ged with Assistant Blake on six nights. In the same interval, eighty-five ohsen·ations were recorded on se,·enteen stars for instrumental constants and chronometer-rates. At AUauta, tlie olJRervations were macle, by permission of the mayor, Hon. S. B. Spencer, at a station in the cityball square. The granite block which had supported the transit-instrument was left in place, marked with the latitude, aud will be marked also with the final value for longitude after the computed results are known. -<\hnnt one hunured yards south of the astronomical statiou, a granite post was firmly fixed to mark the true meridian at Atlanta. The observations there were referred by careful measurement and computation to the spire of the city-hall, which is one of the geodetic stations alrea<l;y connected with the base-line near Atlanta. Subassistaut Smith reported at the office early in April. After observing for perAonal equation at the Naval Observatory, 1ueparation was made for his departure in the United States steamer Swatara, in which vessel he sailed on the 10th of June with others to obsen"e the transit of Venus at Chatham Island i11 tl1e South Pacific Ocean. In order to make available for geographical purposes the determination of longitude at Cedar KP.ys, it was fouud needful to renew tbe triangulation in that quarter. Of the station-points, all of which were carefnll_v marked in the usual way previous to the outset of the late war, Assistant A. T. J\'losJIJall, who was dPtidled for the service, reports that none remain, excevt the two screwpiles which mark tbe ends of the base-line. At the 11orthern end of the base, the screw-pile was fonn<l to be inclined at right angles to the direction of the line measured and marked in 1857. Mr. Mosman was on the ground on the 24th of December, 1873, and began :field-operations early in JanuarJ. In succession, be occupied stations east and west of the base, and completed the triangulation from Pelican Shoal and Black Point to \Vaccasassa Reef. Azimuth was determined at the station on Depot Key. Having extended the work as tar as practicable from his camp, Mr. Mosman closed operations in this section on the 20th of March. The statistics are:

For the azimuth, thirty sets of observations on Polaris were recorded 011 eight uights; and, for time, tvfenty-four sets of double altitudes of the sun, observed witL the sextant aml artificial horizon, were n'conled 011 thirteen days. Assistant :Mosman was aided in this section, and also in service which has been mentioned under Sectiou III, b.Y ~Ir. D. S. \Yolcott. On the 1st of April, :JI.fr. Mosman left Cedar Keys, and passed along the liue of railroad to Fernandi1rn, to make report upon the expedieucy of co11tiuui11g tria11gnlatio11 across the Lead of lhe Florida Peuinsula.

Atlanta /Jase-line.-It was intimated iu the last annual report tbat operatio11s in tlirect connection witb ti.le, base-line near Atlanta, Ga., would l>c concluded by tht· (]etermiuation of the Leight of the base-site, al>o>e the level of the sea. In December, 1873, after closing obseiTations at Stone Mountain, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle organized a party to run two lines of lm-els from the station-point on the moLmtain to a bench-mark iu tbe Yillage, of the same na111e, on tlie line of the Georgia I{ailroad. In January, the levels were ca1:rietl one hnudred and fift,v-six miles along- the r;.iilroad-line to Augusta, Ga. The aids entrusted with this work, l\Iessrs. H. \Y, Blair and J. B. Boutelle, determined the levels by moving from village to village; no facilities in transportation being available. At Augusta, the le·els were counected with those of the recently-constructed Port Hoyal Hailroad from Augusta to Beaufort, S. C. The officers of this road placed their note-books at the disposal of Assistant Boutelle, itu<l careful examination proved that such as related to differences of level could be relied on. Tidal observations were made by the party at Beaufort, to determine the " mean level of sea," and that plane was earefully counected with the levels of tlw Port Royal Railroad; thm; gi>~iug a connected series from tide-water to the top of Stone Mountain, a distance of two hundrnd and sixt,y-sl'ven miles. Tbe height of Stone l'\Iountain was referred to the Atlanta base-line by hypsometric triangles, with reciprocal zenith-distances from the base termini. The results of the several operations show that the height of the base-hue abm'e the mean level of tbe sea is 104!}.2 feet. At the opening of the present fiscal year, Assiiotant Boutdle occupied Grassy Mountain Rtation, and is there engaged with his party. Trian[Julal'ion ,in aeorgia.-At the date of the last annual report, Assistant F. P. 'Vebber was at CRrnes Mountain, a station to the westward of the Atlanta base-line. The measurement of horizontal angles there was completed by the end of the year, wlrnu the camp-equipage was oitored at Cartersville. Mr. \'1 .7ebber completed his computatiolls aud other otlfoe-work in the course of the winter, and in March accompanied Assistant McOorkle for the selection of additional stations to the uorthward and westward of Atlanta. Before leaving Carnes station, the part,,Y had erected a signal on Indian Mountain. Earl~· in June the triangulation \Yas rPsnr11ed. A sigual was set on the higheist point of the Uoltutta Mountains, a work of rnucL hthor. No hou>:e being within reach, the ·party, during au entire week, while engaged iu this duty, had no shelter at uight exceptiug the trees on the mountain. Next iu order, Joim's Monntaiu wai; visited, aud marked by a signal in tbe latter part of June. :Further progress made by this party will be me11tio1wd in tlie report of next year. .Messrs. J. H.

Some of the inten'eniug trees being more than one hundred and fifty feet high along one of the lines of sight, in order that tlit> labor in their rcmm'al might be the least possible, Mr. Boyd determined the directfon of the line, which is seYen aucl a half miles long, by sendi11g up rnckets, to be obi,wn,ed with the theodolite from the station at.

The h,Ytlrograpb,r was then resumed at English Turn, twenty-t.wo miles below the city, au'l was contiuuP(l uniuterrllptedly to Carrollton, ten miles above New Orleans. By this judicious action, sonr111111g,;; were completed before the time of freshets and maximum currents lrnd set in. AssisU1nt Do.Yd found at New Orleans a depth of thirty-six: fathoms, and that the riYer-current was, at some of the stations, as much as four miles per hour.

Triangulation and topograph!J of Sabine Pass, Tex.-For this survey, Subassistant J. N. McClintock was assigned to duty, and early in January his party arrived at Galveston. Aftt>r measuring a base-line, eight stations were occnpied with the theodolite, at which seveuteen points were determined ir: position for use in the plane-table survey. Mr. J. F.

One peculiarity of the Pass is, that from the entrance and to the westward for about ten miles, the water aud mnd of the river form a kind of thin mortar. Vessels seek a harbor in this sea of mud, which is commonly known as the Oil Spot, and are safe iu heavy gales, the mixture being too stiff to break at the surface with the force of the wind." Bydrography of Pa.ss Cavallo and of San Antonio Bay, Tex.-For this service the party of Subassistant L.B. Wright was organized in the latter part of December, 1873, and commenced suundings early in the following month in San Antonio Bay. A small craft was chartered for that work; the schooner Stevens not being available on account of her draught of water.

COAST OF CALIFORKIA, INCLUDING THE BAYS, HARBORS, AKD RIVERS.-(SKETCHES Kos. 17, 18, 19.)

The long acqnaintance of Assistant George Davirhwn with local interests and requirements on the Pacific coast bas enured as in former years for the prompt development of auy part of ti.te seaboard likely to be reached by the advance of settlers. "\Vhile providing for tlrn earlier pmspective requirements, due foretbougllt has been giyeu to the many local survcss, so as to form continuous charts of the coast of Ualifornia and Oregon, and of Washington Territory. l'he \'Vestern Coast Pilot or Directory, first compiled by Assistant Davidson, has in successive editions embodied the nLluallle particulars which he gathers for permanent record. In addition to his duties as chief of a fieldparty, the results of his large experience and observation have beeu cheerfully giYen in the selection of localities of work for the other parties, so as to make most eftective the means available for the development of the wcHtern coast. 4s cllief of one of the parties to be sent out under the direction of the honorable Secretary of the Navy, to observe the transit of Venus in December next, Assistant Da·ddsou, accompanied by Snbassistaut 0. H. Tittmann, came east from San Francisco, and in May last conferred personally, at Wasbingtorr City, with other observers who had been assigned for the same sen'ice. .'.\frssrs. Da>idson, Tittmann, and Edwards sailed from San Francisco on the 29tll of August, and are now engaged at Nagasltki, Japan, iu making obserYations prnlimiuary to such 11s will be noted during the transit. Mr. Thomas P. "\Yoodward, aid in the Coast Survey, and heretofore in service on the Pacific coast, was asRigned to accompany the party of Prof. J.C. Watson, for observing the transit of Venus at a station near Pekin in China. Much of the work of which mention will be made in the following abstracts is in progress in the field while this report is closing. Hence, as the field-reports cannot reach tlrn ofiice in time to admit of being tom bodied in my report for this year, mention only in sucll cases will be made of the localities in which work is now in band, and for which the statistics will be given in the next annual report. Rock off Point Loma.-In a close examination, made at the instance of Assistaut. DiwiilF;on, by the aid of the h~'drographic party of the schooner 1\farcy, :Mr. Frederick Westdabl, the sunken rock off Point Loma was found to have in depth two fatboms less water than had been preYiously reported. The least depth, six fathoms, is in the edge of the kelp, and, being out of tbe course followed by.steamers, cannot be regarded as a danger. Ne\'ertheless, Mr. \Yestdahl ascfl·taiued that the water had been seen to break in that locality. Ile accordingly determined the position of two stations, which he counected with the neighboring triangulation, and instructed the ligbtkeeper in regard to erecting ranges for determining the exact place of least water when the break is next visible. Triangulation and topography of Santa Ana River, Cal.-This survey by Assistant A. W · Chase defines about eight miles of the main coast of the Banta Barbara Clmnnel below Bolsas Creek, which is also included on the plane-table sheet. Farther on, to the south ward and eastward, the survey of the present year embraces several miles of the course of Santa .~ua Hiver and all details of the coast-topography within an average distance of a mile and a half from the waterline. When Mr. Chase, in the latter part of February, took the field, the great marshes of the Bolsas and Santa Ana were overflowed by freshets. Crossing was dangerous on account of tlrn quicksands, and the muddy roads near the coast were almost impassable. This £ondition was due to the nnusual rain-fall (28 inches) during the winter. Under such impedimenli, l\Ir. Ultase passe<l tbe time in reconnaissance, and completed at Anaheim the large amount of office-work which resnlted from his field-operations of the previous year, and in which he had been steadily emploJed tluring the winter at San Francisco. As late as the 9th of March, when the triangulatiou was in progress, skiffs were required for passing the sloughs of the Santa Ana. and Bolsas. In selectiug stations, points near the coast, and requisite for the plane-taLie survey, were chosen, so as to admit of ready connection with stations on the nearest mountain-range. One of the points thus selected is a peak over 1,100 feet high, on the Ban Joaquin Mountains, and from which the o!Jsen'er bas in view the

cliffs at San Juan Capistrano. In the course of the triangulation, fifteen signals were set up, twelve stations were occupied, and forty-four augles were measnreu hy six hundred a11d S(ffenty-two repetitions. At two of the station;;, obi.;ervations were record('d for detennining the positions and beigbts of the principal pt-aks of the Sil'rra :J.\lallre .Mountains. The compntc<l results gi\·e for the m·erage height of the mountain-chain from 8,000 to !J,000 feet, nnd for the highest peak, San Antonio l\Iountain, an eleYation of 10,000 feet al>cn-e the level of the sea. In the topographical survey, which mcludei.; eleYPll and a half square miles, and within which eighteen miles of riYershore lines were traced, tbe contour-line;; were all run out with a level. In reference to tLe wharYeS built by residents of Anaheim, at whose request tracings of the shore-line snn-ey and soundings near the mouth of Bolsas On·ek had been furnhd1ed, Assi-.':rn~ Chase remarks: "There seems to be no question, so far as the influence of the wind or sea :nay aff,,,~t them, of the stability of these wban·es; but they are rapidly giYing way under the attacks of the Tereilo nai'alis. In less than two years, the piles hiH'e beeu riddled by this destructi rn insect, despite all wood-preserdng processes so far used on the coast-line wharyes." Assistant Chase was aided in this survey by Mr. C. Uhlig. In a communication addressed to me in June last, !\Ir. Chase suggests "a continuous application of a light quality of coal-oil or kermiene from above tbrouglJ the wood fibres of piles in wharves and piers, to prev-ent the Ti;rerlo from boring." The same expedient lJad been inrlependently suggested b,r Assistant Da ddsou. As these intelligent officen; well know that large expense would be so entailed, their sugges. tion prominently bring8 into view the great drawback in maintailliug or<linary marine structures as facilities for commerce on tlie \Veiitem coast. There are at this time on the opeu coast.- Hue of the Pacific, within the Ii mils of the C uiteu States, nine wharves, ranging from 800 feet to 2,200 feet in length, and severally costing from $18,000 to $:m,ooo. }lost of these structures have been of neces. sity erected so as to project into the open sea, and iu such situations they are immediately attacked and are quickly destroy<0d b;y the Tcredo navalis. At Hueneme, on the Santa Barbara Cbanuel, all tbe piles of a wharf nearly 900 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 18:! feet deep at the outer end, were treated, when put in place only two years ago, by the most approved means then in use for preserYrng wood, and at great cost. This wh~trf is already giving way. Within the present season, tbe piles taken up for examination were found to be completely riddled by the worm. Assistant Chase states that as yet tirn Limnoria is known only in "san Diego liay. The Teredo is destructive at Santa Barbara, San Lui,; Obispo, and at Crescent City; the wharves at these places being specially noticed b.Y Mr. Ubase. .At the last-named port, he observed tLat some of the piles had left in them only about half an inch of solid wood. Triangulation and topography of Santa Cruz Island, Oal.-Subassistant Stebman Forney remained with his party in tlJe field during the winter of 1873-'74, and prosecuted the detailed survey of the western eud of Santa Cruz Island until the 1st of June of the present year. The progress of work was much impeded by the unusual amount of rain during tLe season and by pxevailing fogs and winds.

C. Johnson, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, with his party, in the steamer Hassler, returned to San Francisco ou the 19th of December, 1873, after extending the bydrographic survey of the 8auta Barham Channel, as was meutiontid in the preceding annual report. T1Je work in that <1uarter was resumed in May last, when opportunity was taken to run lines of soundings off shore to the depth of 500 fathoms from severnl points along the coast of California. Except at Point Piuos, where deep water approaches within eight miles of the larnl, the curve of 500 fathoms was found at about thirty miles from the shoreline.

Coast-topography nortlt of I'icifras Blancas, Cal.-The detailed plane-table imrvey in this quarter includes tlle shore of Sa11 Simeon Bay, and at the end of last season bad reached Piedras Blancas. For extending the work north ward, Assista11t Cleveland Uockwell took the field near the close of FelJrnary ~it tlle upper limit of his previous sun·ey. Signals were set up at interval:> along the coast, six stations were occupied, and thirty angles were measured with the theodolite IJy five hundred and uinet,Y-seven observations. From the points 80 deterrniued, tlrn plaue-table survey was advanced northward to a station near which the great uubroken mountain-chitin that passes Monterey Bity abuts directly upon the ocean. The character of topography on the sheet returned by l\Ir. Rockwell is the usual ragged and bluff coast-line, and beyond it gentle contours IJack as far as the steep slopes aud cations at the foot of the coast-wountain. At the 11orthern limit, the mo1rntain rises almost immediately from the coast-line, and there tlte bluff is three hundred feet iu perpendicular height. In pushing topographical work farther in the same direction, the party encounters at the outset and must cross the mountain-range, wbern the ele\·ation is about three thousand feet above the sea-level. l\'.lr. Rockwell closed work on tlie !!5th of April, after completing a plane-table sheet which represents about fi\·e miles of coast-line and the roads and surface-features within an aggregate of three and a half s11uarc miles. Mr. G. H. Wilson served as aid, and sulJseqllently attended Assist.ant Rockwell for tield-service, to be 11oticed witll work done in Section XI. 1opo_qrapliical dcta,ils.-On the coast of Califoruia, south of Sau Franci.sco Bay, the party of Assistant A. F. Rodgers was engaged during the early part of the present year at several localities. The coast-line, as shown on nine plaue-talJle 8heets, was revised hy adding the wharves aud other strnctnres now existiug between San Francisco and Monterey. The coast-lig!tts at Pigeon Point and Santa Cruz were determined in position. Two others, the Two Brothers Iigllt-house and the light-honse at Mare Island, were connected with the triangulation of 8an Pablo Btty. After forwarding the rPsults of this work to the ofliet>, Mr. Rodgers transferred his party to a station northward of No;yo Ri>er, where he is now engaged in advancing the coast-triangulation. Hy11rography of San Francisco Bar und Entrance, Cal.-'.rhe party of Assistant Gershom Bradford closed the seasou on the 2d of DecemlJer, 1873, having at that date completed soundings to the li11e Point Boneta and Point Lobos, and also as far as the line joining Lime Poiut and Fort Point. Soumliugs were also made inside of the harbor, in the space included between Fort Point, Black Poi11t, .Alcatraz Island, south shore of Angel Isl:md, western mouth of Itaccoou Straits, and Lime Point. This work was in continuation of a survey of the harbor which had been prosecuted at the outset with the IJoats of the schooner Marcy. A small tug, however, was chartered for the purpose, and served mucli better where the strength of the current made it diffieult to record soundings in the boats. At the bar, the sonndings were made to define the 10-fathom curve, and from Frank's Lagoon on the north the work was extended Routhward to a point two miles below the Ocean Side House. Specimens of the bottom were taken at short intervals on the bar. By reference to the self.registering tide-gauge at Fort Point, the soundings were ultimately reduced, after applying a correction for the march of the tide between the bar and that station. In order to find the needful correc-

Iu March, Mr. Bradford made careful search for sunken rocks off Fort Point, aud found and located iu position two, which have been marked as dangers in navigatiou.

For latitude, three hnndreu and forty-one observations were ma<lt· 011 1tbout sixty .,;tars at San :\liguel anu Santa Ornz. Azimuth was determined b;v three hundred aud tltty-five obsernttions on Polari,;. The records of the work have been duplicated, as usual. In l\Tarch, ~-\ssista11t Da\'idson occupied stations at San Luis Ollispo and San Simeon, and observed for latitmlc aud a"imntlt at botll points. After cornpletiug that duty, he reported at vVashingtou, and made preparation for the sen·ice in which he is now engaged in .Japan. In the conrse of the winter, Subassistant Eimbeck and Mr. T. J.

At tile request of the cits authorities, and in associatimi with General Alcxarnler and Admiral John RotlgerR, 1\Ir. Davidson acted, before his d epartnre for Asia, as a member of the commission for determining harbor-lines at Ran Franci8co. As fur also as his other emplosmcnts wonld allow, be has gathered additional material for the Coast Pilots of California, Oregon, \Vashington Tcrritor,,, and Alaska. Rock o:ff tlw Jliddlc Farallon.-Amollg the hydrographic notes recorded by Assistant Davidson \Vas menti011cd tllat sPveral .Years ago the water had been seen to break at a sfiot off the l\fidtlle Farallou, bnt because seldom Reen the existence of the break has frequently been doubted. In oruer to 1fotn111iue tlie matter finally, examination w.ts made near the end of June by Assistant Bradford, with a steam-tug chartered for the purpose. The south approacl1 within an area of al.lout one square mile, on being llm·eloped by close soundings, re>ealed the existence of a rock having onl;\' Jl\·e and a half fathoms at, nw:m low water, in a position about half a mile south ward and westward of the Middle I~arallon. The water deepens rapidly from the shoal point of the rock, eight fathoms being found immediately to the northward and ten fathoms to southward Of it. For idcntifyiug it iu position, hearings were published in .July in the usnal form of notice to mariners. In returning to port from tlie Farallones, Assistant Bradford made some casts with the dredge on San I<'raucisco Bar) anrl brought np specimens of living Echini in the shoal water to the southward of the maiu chaunel. Li\'ing specimens were brought up at several positions last year when soundings were iu pmgn·ss on that bar.

Reconnaissance.-A_ssisbint W. H. Dal1 1 witll his party, in the schooner Yukon, sailed from Sau Francisco on the 18th of April, and reached Sitka after a rough and stormy passage of thirteen days. Portnnatoly, two days of continued clear weather after the arrival gave opportunity for rating tile chronometers, and the same opportunity was taken for determining azimuth at tile astronomical station which was occupied by Assistant Davidson in 18G7 aml 18G9. On the vo_yage to Sitka, the currents were noted, and the temperatures of the water at and below the surface were recorded daily on board of the Yukon. At the last date received from Mr. Dall, the prospects were favoralJle for good progress in the development of the coast by the survey of harbors, the determirmtion of geographical positions, magnetic observations, and snch other information as may add to the facilities for navigation in that section of the Pacific. Mr. Dall is provided with a cheap form of apparatus, of his own device, for deep-sea soundings, and, under favorable circumstances, expects results of interest from the deep waters and fishing-banks in the vicinity of the Peninsula of Alaska. Ile is assisted, as heretofore, by JUr. Marcus Baker. 'J'he party in tlie Yukon will reach San Francisco probably in October; but this report is of necessity closed in allvance of any detailed statement that could l>c received in time to appear with the results of the present year.

COAST SURYEY OFFICE. Executive details 11ertaining to the office branches into which pass the records of triangulation, of observations for latitude, longitude, azimuth, magnetic elements, and of the tides, the topographical and hydrographic sheets, and, in general, the results of all the operations afield and afloat, remain, as heretofore, in charge of Assistant J.E. Ililgard. Under his able direction, the manu· script records and maps, and the original charts plotted from records of soundings, as brought in year by year, take form for publication, after llne treatment or discussion in the several officedivisions to whicll they are referred, and from which the results, when complete, are accepted by the assistant in charge of the office. To the watchful care and solicitude of Professor Hilgard for the interests of the public service, and his intimate relations with leading scientific men at home and abroad, is mainly due the present standing of the office as a repository of data and as a source yielding information of peculiar value. Jn recent ;years, the calls for information -met at the office have included a wide range in questions involving either pliysical research and geographical development or ultimate refinements in scientific processes. As a member of the International Commission on Weights and Measures, to which body he has been accredited by the President of the United States, Mr. Ililgard, being vice-president of the commission, will take passage for Europe before the close of the present month to attend a. meeting of the body at Paris in October. The object sought is the establishment, for at least such pur-

poses as require the utmost precision, of a standard of length acceptable an1l to lJe recognizeu by all enlightened nations, and the construction of identical copies for the use of the se\-eral nations represented in the commission. It is e\ident that such copies, possessing all attainable precision, besides their importance in general scientific uses, are especially so in geode,,y, as rneasmements for geographical purposes in different countries become strictly comparaulc only by their reference to a common unit of length. In routine details pertaining to the office, l\Ir. Hilgard has had tlie effcctiYc co-oper:ition of Assistant F. W. Dorr. The accountability of all persons in employ under the immediate direction of the Assistant in Charge is maintained by monthly reports from each of the office-di\-isions, in which are noted the daily occupation and kind of work performed by each persou. The following are abstracts from the monthly reports of the year: Computin_q Dfoision.-The work of this division has been continued in charge or Assistant Charles A. Schott, with the same general organization as in preceding years, aud its condition clearly proves his ability and efficiency in its management. Besides directing, examiuit1g, aml reporting the work accomplished, and responding to various calls for information, referred to him, Assistant Schott has given personal attention to a computation, for the State of California, of the geodetic records of a line between the Colorado River and Lake Tahoe, forming part of the l>oundar,v between Nevada and California; brought to a close the extensive computation connected with the discussion of the secular change of the magnetic declination in North and Central America; presented the hypsometric results of Assistant Cutts's levels in New Jersey in 18'i'O, 18'1, and 18j;_;; prepared the auuual astronomical, geodetic, and magnetic statistics; made the usual annual determination of the magnetic declination, dip, and intensity at ·washington, D. C.; and presented a paper on weights to be given to transit-observations regist{lred chrouographically. The regular computers employed in this division, and the nature of their '\\Ork in general terms, are as follows: Assistant T. W. Werner was engaged in compntiug the plain triangulations; Dr. G. l~umpf, in the comparison of field and office computations, of geouetic work, and the bringing-up of old triangulation, also the supply of field-parties with the requisite data for their wmk; l\Ir. E. Courtenay attendeu to the least-square adjustment of recent triangulatious and of magnetic computations; l\Ir. J. Main re,ised astronomical and magnetic computations; and l\fr. l\I. H. Doolittle was occupieu with miscellaneous computations. l\Ir. H. II. Gerdes performed the clerical duties of the diYision. Professor R. Keith anu l\lr. F. Hudson have been employed temporarily as computl.'rs; the former on astronomical longitudes and the latter on astronomical latitudes. Tidal Division.-The consideration and revision of all tidal and meteorological obserrntions turned into the office, the correspondence with the observers, supervision of the computations and other worlt relating to tides and tide-gauges, have been kept up by l\Ir. R. S. A \cry, who lms been assisted in the calculations. and copying by Messrs. J. Downes, A. Gottheil, L. P. Shidy, ,T. \Yiirdemann, and l\L Thomas. The primary reductions of obserYations, and the reductions therefrom of the general results used for charts and other purposes, have been made as soon as i)racticable after their receipt from the observers in the field; and these results, as well as such other information as was required liy observers, or by field-parties, or for office use, have been promptly furnished. Some improYements applied within the year to the working-apparatus of the tide-gauges h::rrn tended to make the data furnished by the observers more complete, and have tlrns considerably facilitated the office-work. The tide-tables or predictions for 1875, the ninth year. of the series, have been computed in this diYision, and are published. They contain the approximate predicted times and heights of the tides for al>out twenty of our most important ports, with tables of constants for finding from them the tides at a large numuer of intermediate places. These tables sl1ow an impro,ement in accurac,Y from year to year as the new material accumulates, and admits of thorough discussion. Hydrographio Division.-The office-work of this didsion has been performed l>y l\lr. B_: '~rilh:1_1· l.iiicher, the JHincipal hydrographic draughtsman, assistell by Messrs . .T. Sprauucl auu \\ · C.

Engraring Dicision.-This di\·ision, whieb bas been for some ;years past under the effecth·e management of Assistant E. Hergesheimer, continues to gi;-e abundant evidence of his skill and taste, and the progress of the work has been most satisfactory. In the course of the year, eleven copper-plate charts have been completed, forty-six. have received additions, and ten new ones ha\·e been begun; three have been engraved on stone, and fourteen new charts have been published lJy photo-lithography, besides the usual amount of miscellaneous additions to tlrn progress-sketches and other plates not specified in the tabulated report (Appendix. No. 5). During the past year, Messrs. J. Enthoffer, S. Siebert, H. C. Evans, A. Sengteller, W. A. Thompson, A. M. Maedel, ancl R. F. Bartle have been employed as topographical engravers. Messrs. J, Knight, E. A. Maedel, F. Courtenay, and A. Petersen have continue<l as letter. engravers. Sanding bas been engraved by Messrs. H.1\L Knight ancl F. \V. Benner.

Zumbrock, assisted by F. Ober. Thirty-eigut electrotype copper-plates, ranging in size from 12 to 1,575 square inches of surface, have been made in the course of the year; the greater number being of the largest class. TIJese are auout et1ualls diYi<led into altos, or relief-plates, taken directly from the engraved plates, and bassos, or printing-plates, taken from tlie altos. Photographic reductions for the use of the Drawing and Engraving Divisions were also prepared a:,; usual, and two hundred and fifty glass tubes were si!Yered for heliotropes. Diz·ision of Charts and lnstruments.-The operations of this division, which includes, besiues the safe-keeping of archi\·cs and instruments, the printing of maps and the distribution of charts and reports, the work done also in the instrument-shop and tile carpenter-shop, ha,·e been conducted l>y l\lr. J oltn T. lloovcr, with his usual care and promptness. Since J nly, the additiona I duty of keeping the accounts of tlle office, and making disbursements for the Assistant-in-Charge, has also been assigned to llim. The duty of registering and filing for convenient reference the original maps and charts, and records of observations made by the field-parties, and of keeping an account of the same as they are userl temporarily in the office, was performed until .April by l\Ir. Arthur Schott, and after that time by Mr. G. A. Stewart. During the year, the copper-plate printer in the office, l\fr. Frank Moore, has rendered 17,!143 copies of charts ready for issue. l\Ir. H. Nissen has preparetl the backed drawing-paper for field and office use, and also satis· factorily performed the miscellaneous duties pertaining to the folding-room. Tlte map-room has remained under the care of Ur. Thomas McDonnell. An aggregate of 20,460 copies of charts has been issued during the year, and 1,463 copies of .Annual .Reports of >arious _years ham been distributed. The work in the instrument-shop was done, under the superdsion of Mr. John Clark, by J. Foller, W. Jacobi, G. N. Saegmueller, 0. P. Wiirdemann, and E. Eshleman. The clerical duties of tlte office of the Assistant-in-Charge have been performed by lllr. V. E. King, who also kept the office accounts until July, aided by Mr. F. Clancy until May, when the latter resigned, and was temporarily replaced by Mr. Hugh Caperton, jr. Mr. R. L.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 8.
ON THE SECULAR CHANGE OF MAGNETIC DECLINATIOX IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER PARTS OF NORTH AMERICA: NEW DISCUSSION BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT COAST SURVEY.

AUGUST, 1874.

The present investigation· incorporates the additional observations made or collected since 1859, and contains the improved results for the old stations m; well as those for a number of new stations. The circular function t adopted in the previous dit-icussion to represent the secular change continued to lead to satisfactory results, at'\ might be expected from its great adaptation to represent curves of a periodic character. Independently of the study of terrestrial magnetism, the necessity of the occasional reconstruction of the numerical expressions is sufficiently apparent from the demands of t11e Survey and the use which iR made of them for furnishing the magnetic data given on our charts, viz, the magnetic declination (variation of compass) for a certain epoch, or date of publicatiou, and its rate of change. To briefly recapitulate the formulm employed, let D = o + r sin (am + c) + r 1 sin (a1m + c1) + ..... . express the magnetic declination at any time t, positive when west, negative when east of north; also let m =number of years (and fraction of a year) from the adopted epoch t, or m = t-1850 or a = - - , a 1 = --, · · · P Pi The quantities, o, a constant representing a mean declinatio11, r r 1 ···· parameters, aud c c1 ··· epochal constants of the periodic terms, are to be determined from the observations at any one place by the application of the method of least squares in order to satisfy the condition that the snm of the squares of the residuals of tbe observed and computed declinations shall be a minimum (.!' J 2 = a minimum). Fo1· this purpose, put. o=o1 + x, where o 1 =an assumed approximatfl value of o and x a. correction to it; also, r cos c = y and r sin c = z then the conditional equations will take the form 0= o 1 -D + x + sin am. y + cos am. z + .... which are to be treatp,d in the usual manner. To determine the values of a a 1 · , · three (or more, if necessary) assumptions are made, and those values which render l: L.1 2 a minimum are deduced and finally adopted. In some cases, where certain observations were evidently less trustworthy than others, and which nevertheless could not be dispensed with on account of the small number of observations, or on account of their reference to desirable epochs, special weights were assigned ; generally observations received the weight unity, a few imperfect observations the weight one-half. Of observations evidently grossly in error, no notice was taken. When applying Cauchy's method of interpolation the form D= i'J r cos c . sin ma+ r sin c . cos ma+ .... was found convenient for use. The second periodic term depending on r 1 a 1 c1 could only be established for a few places, owing to insufficiency in the number of observations, and their want of the greater accuracy demanded for it.

The annual chauge v in the magnetic declination, positive when increasing- west (or decreasiug east); also the epoch of minimum west declination (or of maximum east dediuation); also its amount, and the appamnt probable error of an obscrYation, are found as follom'l: Differentiating the expression for D, we haYe dD=ra cos (am+c) dm+r 1a1 cos (a 1in+c1) elm+ ...· hence for any time t, and for minutes of arc, v =GO sin 10 [ra cos (am+ c) +r1 a1 cos (a1m + c1 ) + ... J Maxima and minima are deduced from the equation O=ra cos (am+c)+r 1a1 cos (a 1m +c1) + ... from whid1 expression we can find m. The apparent probable error e0 of an observation is dedn~e<l from the differences J of the n observed auu computed values by the formula

eo=

n-n1

where n1 equals the numl>er of unknown quantities in the expression of D wliich had to be fonnd from the observations; when weights w are used, substitute u J 2 for J 2 · The greater part of this apparent probable error is due to the fact that the observations collected at any oue station w·ere not generally made at the same spot; it includes consequently local irregularities in the distrilmtion of magnetism as well as pure observing errors. The principal uncertainty in the investigation arises partly from the large observing errors in the older observations made with ordinary compasses or rude instruments generally, and partly, since the introduction of the refined instruments, the theodolite and magnetometer, from the circumstance that the Yarious observations for the same nominal locality were taken at different spots, involving changes of local deflections of the magnet. "From the extended use of iron and the growth of cities, it is difficult to select and preserve at Rnch places a suitable locality for nse at future times. Accurate investigations of the secular clrnnge e<tn ou ly be made at permauent observatories or in localities not liable to disturbing influences. Some remarks respecting a supposed cause of the i:ieculnr clrnnge in tlie magnetic declination, dip, and intensity will be found in Coast Survey Heport for 1870, Appendix No. 1-1, pp, 107-110; and, in applying at present a periodic function to the investigation of the secular change, it is not implied that the phenomenon is necessarily of a periodic character, or must exhibit more than a si11gle complete period; the aim is to represent by means of such a fnnction the changes in the direction of the magnetic resultant as far as observed. In the present state of onr information, the process must necessarily be a tentative one. The collection of the material is given first, the stations being arranged in geographical order, beginning in the northeast, passing to tlie south and west, and ending in the northwest.· l<'or ench locality, the ol>served declinations are given in chronological order, together with such nott>s and references respecting observer, place, and publication, etc., as could be fouuq. The stations here given are the only ones, as far as known, at present suitable for a discussion of the secnJ.ir change, but their number is continually increasing by the accnmulation of new facts.
"This approximates to an arrangement proceeding from the groatest western to the greatest eastern declination~.

Tllc proba!Jle errors girnn a!Jo>e will serve to convey some rude idea of the relative -ralue of each series ot' o!Jservations. The imperfections in the instrumental means of the older observations in many cases react unfavorably on the modern observations made with more precise instruments; the observations, for instance, taken by Hudson in 1609, in the vicinity of New York Bay, are

fairly cb:wgcahle with a probable errol' of :!:: 3° (a single 1·esnlt); tliose taken us Yancouver on our western coast, between 1792 and 1794, are subject to a probable uncertainty of :!:: P (eacb) Increased precision was obtained with the improvement of the azimuth compass anu the allow. auce for disturbing efl:ect of the ship's iron, and, for shore stations, with the iutl'odnction of the theodolite for determining the astronomical meridian. \Yith a portallle magnetometer (collimatormaguet), the instrumental means need not le:we a greate!' uncertainty than about one min t1te; but the actual probable error of any determination is limited by the accidental yariations in the mean direction of the magnetic force from uay to.Jay, making it desirable t.o continue the observations for three or more days, and correcting them for daily variation. The amount of the probable error is also uependent Oil the magnitude of the horizontal force. A cursory examination of the column containing the epochs of greatest ea,~terly excursion, the dqtlecting force proclucing the Recular change attaining then an easterly maximum, shows that the needle became stationary in direction, and then reversed its secL1lar motion, in the New Euglaml States toward t!JC end of the past century, in the Atlantic coast States to the west and sontu early in the present, and in Me-xico about the close of the first third of the present century. In California, Oregon, and Washington Territory, it has not ;ret reachetl tllis condition. 'Ye tlms ha\·e the following epoells for comparison: Halifax, about 1711; Portland, Portsmouth, Kewlmryport, Salem, Boston, Cambridge, Nantucket, aml rrovidence, about 1779; ilartfonl, New IlaYen, Xew York, Ilatborough, Plliladelphia, \Vashington, and ()ape Henry, about 1800; Charleston, Sa\·annah, Key West, and Havana, about 1800; New Orleans, about 1831; Yera Cruz, Mexico, Acapulco, and San Blas, about 1837; San Diego, Monterey, and San Francisco, expected about 1907 (yet ·ery uucertain ). We are thus directed to the extreme northeastern States for probable indications of what may be expected to follow on the seaboard in more southern and western States. l~cspccting the secular movement of the needle, apparently a little more than a century passed before the influence which produced the turning of the north end of the needle westward in l\Iaiue (increasing there the western declination) was folt in Lower California (diminishing there the eastern declination). In Oaliforuia, Oregon, and Washington Territory, the eastern declination is at present still incrcasin6, but with a losing rate. By the time the western elongation of the secular change is rcachetl in 1\Iaine, we may expect to sec the needle in the opposite phase, or at its eastern elongation in California. We cannot as ,yet follow this influence directly over the intel'ior of the Gnitecl States for want of early observations; the westernmost interior stations for whiel1 an epod1 could he made out were Buffalo, Erie, Cleveland, and Detroit; these gile the average turning epoch 17!JJ. It may be quite practicable hereafter to trace out curves uniting all stations where the needle was stationary at a given. epoch, and again at other epochs for regular intervals of time. say of ten or twenty-five years. Returning to the first table, the constant in each formula woultl represent the normal direction of the needle about which the motion constituting the seculal' change would be performed in an average cycle of about two hundred and seventy years, and with extreme deflections on citht'\l' side of it equal to the coefficient of the periodic term, all under the suppositfon that the law of the secular movement was truly expressed. It is no doubt much more complex, an<l besides may fail at any time; yet, as far as our pl'esent experience reaches, and within the inter·al when the first reliable observations were made to the present time, it is found trustworthy.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
Table of decenn-ial values of the 1Jlagnctic Declination comp1tted from p1·ecedi11g equation8.

These tables ha>e been constructed to facilitate the reduction of observed declinations from one epoch to another; they \Yill be found specially useful when olt.l liues, ruu by compass, have to be retraced, and for the construction of isogonic charts for a given epoch. Blanks occurring in the table indicate no or doubtful >alues for the corresponding times. values given to the nearest tenth of a degree are less reliable than those giYen to buudredths. A + sign indicates west, a - sign east declination.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Neither the Recular change of the magnetic dip,* nor that of the horizontal intensity,t can as yet be treated by the use of a harmonic function. Heliable observations for dip hardly date back to the year 17!:10 on our westem coast, while on the eastern coast there are but very few ol>scrya. tions earlier than 1833. Respectiu g the records of horizontal intensit,y, there are but a few in the United States prior to 1830, and all the earlier observations are expressed in relative measure.f

APPENDIX No. 9.
REPORT ON RESULTS OF MAGNETIC Ol3SERYATIONS, BOTH ABSOLl~TE AXD DIFFEREXTL\L, AT KEY \YEST, 18GU TO lt'fiG.

Result8 of obscrrations of ten·cstrial magnetism at Key 1rcst, Fla., made liei/l'cen 1SGO and JSGG, undei· the direction of Prof W. P. Tro1clJridge and 11Ir. /3. lFalkcr; discuslicd and reported liy Charles A. Schott, .Assistant ~Cnite<l States Coast Surrey. DECE:.\IBER 20, 18i±. The series of magnetic obsen·ations, both with portable instruments for absolnte determillations and with fixeu or self-registering instruments for differential determinations, was commcncet1 in February, 1860, anu continued to April, 1866, inclusiT"e. The obseryations at K(>y \Yest are therefore contewporaneous with the magnetic ousenations taken at Eastport, l\Ie., up to tile close of the latter series in July, 18uJ.* The Key \'lest series embraces half of an eleven-year cycle. Tile Key West l\Iagnetic Obsen·atory is in latitude 24 8 33.'1, a1Hl in longitude 81° 48.':I ,y, or Greenwich. The island is about eighty-nine nautical miles K. 20° E. (true) from Ila\ana, Unl>a. Tile Coast Survey l\Iagnetic Observatory was established by Prof. vY. r. Trowbridge, assil'tant Coast Survey, in January, 1860, and left in charge of 1\Ir. Samuel 'Yalker aud l\Ir. G.D. Allen. In 1861, it was successively in charge of l\fessrs. Allen, '\alker, aud J. G. Oltmanns. In 1862, it was in charge of l\Icssrs. Oltmanns, F. F. Nes, and 'Talker, and rnmained urn1er the latter's direc· tion to tlie close of the work. A full description of the obsen-atory and of the self-reg'il'tering instruments (inclnding their adjustment) is gi\'en u_y Professor 'l'rowbril1ge in Coast Surn~.r ltPport of 18GO, Appendix No. 26, pp. 326-349, to which the reader may be referred for matters of detail. The Brooke's magnetograpltst were first mounted in the Smithsonian grounus at \Vasltington. (For a description of this obsenatory and instruments by Assistant J. E. Ililgard, sec Smithsonian He. port for 1859, p. 385.) :From here the instruments were transferred to Key \\est, and returned to Washington in 1865. After undergoing considerable repairs in September, J8i3, they were loaned to the Union UuiYersity at Scheuectad.r, N. Y. Tbey consist ~f a unifilar deelinometer, a bifilar magnetometer, and a balance magnetometer, witli the necessary revolving barrels, clocks, and photographic ontfi t. The photographic traces for changes iu declination ancl horizontal and \·ertical forces were read off and the hourly .-alues talmlakd The i11struments for absolute measures were magnetometer C. S. Xo. G, used between Dec('mucr, 1860, and J\fay, 1861, and magnetometer 0. S. No. 2, used before and after that time, for dPclination and horizontal force; dip-circle 0. S. No. 9, used between February and June, 18GO, and clip-ci11'1e. 0. S. No. 8, used between July, 1860, and May, 1861. After this date, No. 9 was again euJplo,wd for dip. "With some exceptions, in the first tllree years tlle declination, dip, and horizontal iutcusity, in absolute measure, were determined on four days about the middle of each month. Tbe results will be given in the comlenserl form of tables, accompanied by such explanatious, illustrations, and comparisons as the sul~ject demamls. For comparison with tbe Key\\'est results, similar ones ohtaired at 'Washington, Philadelphia, Toronto, Eastport, or other stations, will l)e gfren. The results from the absolute measures will be given first, followed uy those from the differc11tial measures. The computation of the former was made by :M:r. J. :l'tlain aml l\Ir. E. ll. Courtenay; for those of the latter, I bad some assistance from l\lr. F. Hudson.

In the following tal.Jle, I ha,~e collected for comparison tlrn resuiis for auuuu,l ·ariation of the declination for some statiotts near our Atlantic coast. The results for Washington, D. C., are combined from obserYations h;y Lieut-. J.M. Gilliss, G. S. N., made on Capitol Hill* during 18-10, 18±1, and 18±2, and my own observations during 18()7 aml 1868, not far from Lieutenant Gilliss' location (Ooast Survey Heport for lSG!l, p. 203). Their relatiye weiglits are 10 to 1; his observations beiug daily, mine only for tliree days each month. The results for Plliladelphia are from Coast Survey Report for 18li0, p. 311, and for the stations Toronto,t Canada, aIHl Eastport, :\Ic., from Coast Survey Report for lSG."), p. 170.

There being at present no indication of a periodic change in the annual Yariation, nor a depeudt'nce ou the amount of seenlar change, the column of mean values may be taken to represent fairl;y tlie Jaw· for our stations: it is the same as for Kew, St. Helena, Cape of Guml Hope, and IIobarton.:j: The average annual range is about l'.2; and, roughly speaking, the north end of the magnet is deflected to the east wheu the sun is n.orth of the e(1uator, and defleetell to the west when south of the equator.

of the sccnl<tr chanffC in tlie hori.wntal intensity.

Compariug ench annnal mean with the above value of 11, and forming conditional equations, we find the annual changt'. of H, Yiz, J JI = - 0.004G, equal to - n'ow of H neal'ly. The horizontal force at J\'('y West, between lSGO and 186G, may be expresRed hy

H = G.739 - 0.00:16 (t - 1863.5)
The diminution of tlie horizontal force is small, yet sufficiently well indicated.
It is, however,

contrary to thl' obsen·ecl e1foctat vV.ashington, where J 1118635 =+ - ~ , theinereaseh:wing commenced about 18fi3. For Toronto, we have J Jl18635 =

with tlie minimum epoch 1860.

.At E:ist-

While the apparent average annual diminution of the declination, +3'.07, agrees well with the (uniform} value +3'.06, given by the absolute measures, it is evidently sul~ject to change, being in a state of diminution, quite rapid in the first fin.1 monthR. Tue torsion in the suspe11sion-skein was tberefore undergoing considerable change iu the first five months, and had not come to a stationary condition even after the lapse of six years. That the permanency of the line of detorsion cannot be depe11ded on during a year for measures inYolving so small an amount as a fraction of a minute appears from the consideration of the annual variation as made out from the ahove scale-readings

In this case, we must substitute, for" doubtful observations", the wonls "observations following a different law from tlJat supposed l>y the theory of probability". It is m·ident that no strict limit can be given, since we have no means of identifying disturbances as such except by tbeir apparent discord witb tlJe observation11 belonging to the same hour, month, and year. The disturbances, however, follow a imfficiently distinct law to render this a matter of small moment. To take account of the variability of the disturbances in the daily, annual, aml seculiar periods, the limit of the criterion ex was determined from diffon~uces from the normals at 01· a. m. in January, at 2h a. m. in February, at 41J a. m. in Marcl1, etc., aud at 101· p. m. in December, for each year separately.

We notice the preponderance of easterly over westerly disturuauccs in overy month except in March, which is no doubt occasioned by detective observations in the first year. The disturbances, both westerly and east{~rl_y, reach a principal maxim nm in Augul'lt and a secondary maximum in April; minima occur in June and December. At Philadelphia, the corresponding months were October aml April for maxima and Jnne and February for minima. H. Ex. 100--16

'l'he 1cc8tcrl.11 1fo:;tnrhanccs show a single progression, the same as at Philatlelphia and Toronto, with the maximum number between 8 and 10 a. m., an<l the minimum 1mmber at 9 p. m. The easterly disturbancp,s, on the contrary, exhibit a double i)fogrcssion, nearly the same as at Philadelphia and Toronto, with the principal maximum at 9 p. m., tliC' Rccondary maximum at 9 a. m., and with the principal minimum at 4 p. m. and the secondary minimum at 6 a. m. "\Ve thus have the prin· cipal maximum of easterly disturbances in direct opposition to the law of tlie west(\fly distnrl.ia11ces, whereas the 11econdary maximum of eastprl.v diRtnrlmnces is in accord with the law of tlie westerly disturbances, aR Rhown iu the accompanying diagram. In gP11cral, the most disturbed time of the day is between 8 and 10 a. nJ., anrl the least disturbed time between 4 anu 5 p. m. \Yith re8pcct to magniturle of disturbances, the results are as fol.
lows:

Th<) average magnitude of a disturbance from the six-year series
bctwccH .April, lSGO, and April, 186G, is 3'.64. Th<' aYcrage magnitude of westerly disturbances equals 3'.49.

The average magnitude of' easterly disturbances equals 3'.75. The easterls disturbances are thus more numerous and of greater magnitude than the westerly disturbances. The largest disturbance recorcled occnrre<l August 3, 186.5, at 4 a. m., when the magnet was deflecte<l 21' .4 to the east of its normal position at that hour. The next largest de1lection of 13'.8 was also to the east, and occurred on October 4, 1862, at 2 a. m. The largest westerly deflection was 11'.9, and OC· curred on March 1, 1862, at 1 a. m.; the next largest to the west was 11'.1.

But for the rather small numbei· of years of' obsernitions at Ke_., ".est, the apparent law of change ot magnitude of disturbances from hour to l.10ur woultl come out 11nitc di;;tinctly, both for the western and eastern deflections; the smallest llisturlmnces evidently occur about noon, and between 6 a. m. and 3 p. m. they are below their Rverage value; tlnring the night they are al.Jove the average. Irrespective of direction, the disturbances increase regularl;r iu size from noon, when they are a minimum (3'.1), to midnight, when they reach a maximum (4'.4j; after this time, they decrease regularly till noon. We also notice the fact of disturbances of small magnitude (3'.3 to 3'.4) to

For comparison we ilave: minimum size of uisturliauees at Toronto, from a five-year houl'ly series commencing- with 1:344, at 1 p. m., at Philadelphia at 2 p. m., at Key 'Vest at 0 p. ru.; also maximum size at Toronto about 9 p. m., at Philauelpilia about 10 p. m., at Key ·west at 12 p. m. Wilile we posses;,; a toleralJly complete knowledge of the empirical laws of the various tluctuatious in tile magnetic dedinatiou for our Atlautic coast, we have as yet no material of investigatiou for our Pacifie coast, anll it is greatly to be <lesireu that self-recording magnetic instruments may. be establislie<.1 tlte1·c at oue or two stations, aud maintaiued for at least six ;years. 1.'lte solar d iumal w riation in the magnetic declination at Key lVcst jiJr t!te cpocli 1803.3.
If we subtract each 11onr1y meau of the preccdiug table of monthly normals from its respective monthly rueau, we olJtain the following table of the solar diurnal variation, expressed in minutes of arc, a + sign indicating a deflection of the north end of the needle to the westwaru, a - sign a deflection to t11e eastward. Tlrn talmlar values corresponuing to six years of observation, and situated nearly betweeu a maximum and minimum of the so-called sun-spot period of eleveu years, may I.Jc supposed free of any effect of that period. For comparison, I ha>e added tlie PLila<lelphht talJle of tlie solar diurnal variation,* derived from th·e years of olJscn·ations, and computed for the (exact) local liours; this table refers to the mean epoch 1813-±3, whicli approaches to tlie minimum of the sun-spot period.

The tabular results of the daily fluctuation in each month are exhibited grnpl1ically on the accompanying diagram, and it would appear from the great regularity of the snccessi \e 11our]y yalues that the labor of throwing them into an analytical expression cau be llispcm;ed with. Tue diagram is so arranged with respect to the north end of the magnet that the easterly motion is to'IYanl the right, westerly toward the left, the time-scale running, from up, clown, commencing and ending at midnight. The following tabular results, which exliil.Jit tile characteristic features of the daily variation, are derived from a graphical process. It will be noticed that, during the time when the sun is north of the eqnator, the cnrn·s present a certain similarity, different from that presenteu Llul'iug the time wheu the sun is south of the equator. The first half year, including Rmnmcr, comprises t11e months April to September in· elusive; the second half, including winter, the months Octo her to March inclnsi \C\,

The preceding table, in connection -with the diagram, completely llefines tile law of the daily variation. Tile cross-lines of dashes connect the times of eastern elongation, of western elongation, and of the intermediate normal position respectively, for successive months. The close conformity of the daily variation at Key West and at Philadelphia will be noticed; tile secondary motion dmfog the night, with a range of about half a minute of arc, is only perccptilJle during tile winter months. When the table is to be used for reducing any observed value of the declination to the mean of the day, the sign of the quantity must be reyerscd in order to serYc as a correction." The same remark applies to the Philadelphia table.
*At Key West, ea well as at Philadelphia, the mean of tho morning cn.stnn r.Jonga.tiou arnl of the afternoon western elongation will always represent the daily mcau witbiIJ fos~ t!iau O'.C..

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Tlte greatest cleveloprnent of the daily variation occurs in August and the least iu November, a feature common to Key "\Vest and l'hiladelphia. The annual variation in the diurnal motion of the magnet is best exhibited, for every hour, by the mean values for summer and winter.

The evidence of a eonnection of some kind between the amplitude of the daily \."ariation and the spotted area. of the sun is quite strong. If we commence with t.he ,'I' ear of m:txlmum (nParl,\-), spots marked I in the table, and end with the year of minimum (nearly), spots marked V L we Hhall find a regular diminution in the hourly va.lues. Thus, for 7h a. m., the eastern deflection ~'.7U changes systematically into l'.80; for Sh a. m., 3'.31 chauges to 2'.0!}; also the western dPflection a,t lh p. m. changes from 2'.69 to 11, 72; and at 2 p. m., from 2'.88 to l'.76. Thb; diminuti011 of the

If the Key West declinations had been observed quite up to the two extremes, the daily amplitude would probably be found included between 6'.9 and 3'.8, the average amplitude being 5'.4. It will be necessary, in using the table of hourly positions for the purpose of reducing obsen·ed declination at any one hour to the 1nean position of the day, to pay attention to the relation the year bears to the ele.-en-year cycle: thus, for a year of maxim nm sun-spots, tbe talmlar numbers require to be multiplied by 1.3; for a year of minimum t'l\lll·Spots, they require to be multiplied by 0.77 nearly; proportioue.d multipliers being needell for intermediate yea.ro;, ThP discussion of tb11 d~fferential observations of the horizontal and vertical forces may be given 011 a future occasion; also the investigation of the lunar effect on the declination, and a suppo~ed e:tfect on the same depending on the solar rotation.

RESULTS OF OBSERVATIOKS FOTI DETER:llINING POSITIONS OCCUPrnD IN J,O\VER CALTF01n\'IA AXD AT PHILADELPHL\, REPORTED BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSISTANT, IK CHAlWE O:F THE CO:IIPUTING DIVISION, COAST SURVEY 01,FICE.
OCTOBER 7, 187 4. A trustworthy determination of tlu~ position occupied at San Jose uel Calm, Lower California, by Ohappe d'.A.utcroche, when ohsening th{' transit of Venus in June 1769, has long- remained a desideratum. It is believed that Uhappe's observations are valuable; but they could not Le fully utilized for want of a reliable longitude.* Tl1i,.: information llas at last been supplied by th!:\ Coast SurYey, on tbe occasion of a reconnaissance of the coast of Lower California, in Ja11uary, February, and Mare11, 187~~, by Commander P. C. ,Johnson, U.S. N., Assistant Coast Surve:y, in tbe steamer Hassler. The duty of making the astronomical ollservations was assigned b:y the Superintemlent, Prof. Beujmniu Peirce, to G. Davitlson, A:ssistant Coast Suryey, ai11ed by "\Vm. Eimbeck, subassistaut. For determining the longitudes, fom sidereal and twenty mean-time chronometers were trauspOl'ted from San Diego, Cal., to Oenos Island, thence to San Jose~ and returned to the same stations, which euabled the computer to introduce traYeliug rates for the diflerence:s of lougituue.

Resulting differnnees .if longitudes.

The latitude of the same station was determined by means of a meridian telescope (a combined transit and zenith telescope); but, owing to au accident, the delicate level was broken during a storm at a preceding station, and, of necessity, the common level attached to the finder was substituted in the micrometric measures of north and south stars. The result obtained for latitude was 230 03' 35" .40 ::!:: 0" .4 7. A local triangulation was executed by Assistant Davidt·mn, connecting this station with that identified by him ais Chappe's obserYing position. A base was measured in tlie river-bottom, also an astronomical azimuth on the bill south of San Jose. These operations gave the following reductions: · Chappc's station north of astronomical station of 1873, d 'f' = + 1 11 .88 Ohappe's station west of astronomical station of 1873, d J. = + 1' 32 11 .0l Hence, supposed position of Ohappe's station of 176!J, ip = + 2;~0 03' 37".28 ::!:: 0".47 j .( = 109° 42' 14".91 W. of Greenwich.

The following remarks respecting the recovery of Ohappe's station lJy Assistant Davidson are copied from his record-hook : "Jn 1871, I obtai]l(·d a copy of Cassini's report of d' Auteroche's work, and from it gleaned the following particulars : "EX'l'RACT.-' 1\fa:1· 20, 1769.-I made baste to establish myself at San Jose, and to prepare for my preliminary observations. Myself and all my party took up their abode in a large granary. I had half the roof taken off toward the south, and put up an awning that could be spread out or furled at pleasure. .A.ll my instruments were fixed just as they were to stand to observe the transit of Venus. The weather fa:vored me to my utmost wish. I had full time to make accurate and repeated observations for the 8etting of my clock. At last came the 3d of June, and I had an opportunity of making a uiost complete observation. It was necessary to commence at once to construct three pedestals of masonry for the firm support of the quadrant of three feet, the transit instrument, and the equatorial movement.' . . . . "Heobservedforlatitudewith the quadrant, and obtained, from several stars, latitude 23°03 1 36".5; from sen~ra1 obsen·ations on the sun he obtained 230 03' 05", and the final latitude· adopted, 'estab· lished very exactly,' was 23° 03' 2011 · .For longitude, he observed emersion and immersion of Jupiter's satellites, and obtained San Jose west of' Paris 7ll 2sm 53· ;t by an eclipse of the moon, 7ll 29m 40°. The mission of San Jose is situated about one league from the coast, upon a little river which empties into the Vermilion Sea." Assistant Davidson further remarks: "I arrived at San Jose del Cabo March 11, 1873; endeavored to gather information of the position of' old church and granary; found the present church a recent structure; went about four miles up the river to the mission Viejo, established in 1728 or 1 WO; learued from Don Itamon Lesenya Talamanta where he had discovered the wall of the church and granary at that place and established the mission Viejo , . · . ; but this was not l\lr. Ohappe's locality. That mission had been abandoned before that time, and was located at San Jose del Cabo. At San Jose, I could get no clue to the date of the changes, and found that there had even been a third move toward the beach near the cemeter~'· But, from the sifting of the evidence I could collect, and the latitude of' the present church, I felt satisfied this was the locality. The present priest is an Indian. He knows nothing of dates, but showed me the foundations of the old church and the position where tho gmnary was traditionally reported to have stood. Its relation to the church was close, and the position well adapted for Mr. Chappe's work. I could not see the foundations, but he showed me where they were before the present filling to the top of the wall was made. The relation of the granary is given to that of the present church in the plan following the record of observations in this volume; and I think that the station of Mr. Chappe may be safely assumed to be within a space of 20 feet square."
* It will be noticed that his latitude result from the stars agrees, within less than a second, with the value determined in 1873, thus proving the value adopted in Dr. Powalky's dissertation, and again in Nos. 1811 and 1812 of the Astronomische Nachricbten (August, 1870), viz, 23° 05' 15", to be in error. t In Dr. Powalky's dissertation, the assumed longitude is 7 b 27m 57· west of Paris (supposed on Lalande's authority); subtracting 9m 21·.06 (Coast Survey determination of 1872), we 1iud his assumed longitude to be 7h lBm 35·.9 west of Greenwich. Chappe's own longitude from Jupiter's satellites corresponds to 7h 19m 318.9 weat of Greenwich, the oorrec~ longitude being 7h ism 49·.o.

The accompanying sketch of San Jose and vicinity is taken from Assistant Daddson's record, the results of his triangulation ba·ing been introduced. Chappe's observing station would appear to have been aoout 1!1 meters above the sea-le-vel.
In connection with the above subject of geographical position of a station occupied in 17<m, there are some other American stations for which positions had been given, and which, by tl.Je introduction of telegraphic longitudes, can now lie im1uo·ed. The exact position of Hittenhouse's ;;tation in Philadelphia has also been recovered, for a reference to which I am indellteu to \Y. W. Uooper, Assistant Coast Surv·ey. We find in "\Yatson's Annals of Philadelphia, vol. 1, p. 40:2 (editiou of 1857): "The Declaration of Independence was read p11blickly from the platform of the o!Jsenator.v before erected tilere b,y Rittenhouse to observe the transit of Venus. It was abont :!O fe<it high and I~ to Hi feet square, at 50 to 60 feet south of t,he honse (State-House) aud Hi to ~O feet west of the main walk." nrr. Cooper farther remarks tLat the above position of Uw platforw is iu accord witll the recollection of' his childhood, when he saw a similar stand in the place referrell to. We have accoruingly Ritteuhouse's position 0 11 .70 soutl1 aud 0".38 west of' the trigonometrical station steeple State·llouse, or in latitude 39° 56' 5'.J".4, anu longitude 750 OG' 03 11 .0, equal to 511 00"' 36°.20 west of Greenwich. The longitudes communicated to Dr. Powalky by the late Superintendent Bache, as gi\'en in his dissertation and iu No. 1511, Astrouomische Nachrichten (1870), require to be iucre:u;e<l l'.3, by which quantit:y the telegraphic result llad increased our western longitudes as previously adopted in the Survey.

REPORT ON AN £NSPECTION OF THE TERMINAL POINTS OF THE PROPOSED CANALS THROUGH NlCAHAGUA AND THE ISTHMUS OF DARIEN, BY PROFESSOR H. MITCHELL, UNITED ST.\TES COAST SlJRVEY. GREYTOWN (SAN JUAN DEL NORTE).

The examination of the coast in the immediate neighborhood of Greytown and tile outlets of the Lower i::lan Juan River has satisfied me that a reconstruction of the harbor i:; practicable. This conclusion is based upon a particular conception of the causes which led to the destruction of the old port, and a conviction that these causes, still active, may be successfully resisted by artificial works. I quote the following from the Report of the Committee of the National Academy, made in 1866.History of Greytown Barbor.-" The earliest source of information that we feel warranted in using is the sketch to be found in J\1r · .Molina':; work upou Uosta L{ica, which is based upon a survey by George Peacock in 1832, and has additions showing the progress of the sands of Isla Castilla down t-0 1848. ''In 1832, five fathoms of water could be carried from sea to a poiut within the preRent basin ofGreytovrn Harbor, through an opening which measures one and three.fourths miles from Isla Castilla to tbe west shore. At that time, the avenue to the sea was with01tt a bar, and the regular decline of the bottom along the seaward channel-way gave no indications of the actio~ of sconring forces- There was no rlepression at the harbor's mouth aud no acc1ww.la.ti01i~ beyond, that seeme?l in any way to be a dependency upon the existence of thei basin or its outlets. The shallow ground lying along the coast outside of Isla Castilla, and projecting beyond to the westward, would seem, upon Mr. Molina's sketch, to be a concomitant or parallel to this island as well as an outwork of the advance. Subsequent surveys, however, dissolve this apparent connection aud relation. "The eml>oucbure of the Lower San Juan River is found in this first sun·ey at the head of the anchorage basin, and the deposits of that stream appear to be nearly two miles within the harbor's mouth. "Between 1832 and 1834 a movement of the sands to the westward occurred, which extended the point of Isla Castilla about 456 feet per annum. This extension took: the form of a hook. From 1834 to 1835 the point advanced 608 feet. Four years later, in 1839, it was found tc> Im >e advanced 1,065 feet, or at the rate of 266 feet per annum. Between 1839 and 18-10 it ad·rnnced about 400 feet. Between 1840 and 1848, a 8pace of nearly eight years, it adv-auced 221 feet per year, and in the next succeeding ten months 913 feet were added, or the beach grew at the rate of nearly 1,100 feet per annum. The harbor as a protection to shipping had been improving up to the last date upon Mr. Molina's sketch, but its opening from the sea had become reduced Lo about 0.8 of a mile, a loss of over 50 per cent. "In 1853, we find the mouth of the harbor, measured upon the same line as before, reduced to ().52 of a mile, a reduction of 35 per cent. since 1848. In this period of four and a half .Years, the sand-spit made an average annual advance of 401 feet. The physical character of the harbor had thus far undergone no cba0 ge; the same good depth of water could be carried in ; the same grauui1l decline of the bott-Om to seaward was preserved, and no bar or shmil lay in front. Tlle point of Isla Castilla called on this more recent map Punta Arenas, had been made across the floor of tlle sea by Rands thrown in from above, not scoured from the bottom; it was built out like a mole, the material ta.king nearly its natural slope, and not suflering waste under tile action of any curre~ts from within. In this chart of 18513, an opening through the beach is found about at the extremity of the Castilla of L832. .As a physical feature it does not yet seem important,.

HEPOHT OF THE 8UPERINTENDEN1' OF

"Tbe survey of 185f:i found the, dr,v portion of Point Arenas advanced nearly due south from its position in 1853, and a gradual shoaling-off to the westward, reducing the harbor's mouth to O.o of a mile. At this time, the point was broad and hooked. Tlle same depth of water could be carried in as formel'ls, and no haT was found outside. "Between October, 185f:i, aud January, 1859, two and a quarter years, Point Arenas advanced to tbe south west 1,156 feet, or at the rate of about 514 per annum. Even as late as 185U, when the harbor's mouth was rerluced to 0.13 of a mile, the only trace of any action from within was the retreat of the 18-feet line on tbe west shore. "According to a note upon the British chart, the entrance was reduced to 300 feet in 1861; while, in Jauuary, 18G5, Captain .Tones, of Ber Majesty's ship Shannon, reports that the entrance has a bar across it after a norther, thouglt after a continuance of fine weather the scour of the river increases tlie depth to 8 or 10 feet. The passage on the opposite side has also reduced to 50 or 60 yards." "Our final authority Is the surYey made under the direction of Captain P. C. F. West, who brought to the field the skill and accuracy of long experience m the Coast Survey, to which corps he now belongs. "In this survey, made in l~ehruary, 1865, the change in the physical character of the harbor, shadowed forth in the note that we quoted from the British chart, is confirmed. The anchorage has uecome a lag·oon, with an uncertain inlet. Between Point Arenas and the opposite shore a depression of 20 feet is found, to reach which 17:.\ feet must be passed in the approach from the harbor and 8 feet in the approach from the sea. Here we have the depre.~.~ion at the opening and the bar out.~ide, which are the characteristics of a true inlet, for which we have looked in vain upon tbe earlier charts. "After the completion of the general survey, Captain West's part.v found, in J\'Iay, that the opening at Greytown Harbor had closed, and that a breach had been made fartller to the westward." Cau.~e.~ of the 11eeline and final destruction of the harbor.-The quotations wliich I have made from the report of the academy indicate somewhat the view entertained by the committee reS'arding the causes which formed and ultimately destroyed the harbor; but I may be permitted to restate the matter brietl:f from a review of other portions of the same report. The harbor of Greytown was originally a re-entrant angle or cove, lying between the delta of the San Juan Hiver and the adjacent coast to the north westward. Near the head of this cove there euterecl an offset of the San Juan River (bearing the name of the parent stream originally, but recei1tly, for distinction, called the Lower San Juan), which formed a subsidiary delta of its own within the cove. This co,-e, opening to the northward, was in the coarse of time converted into a lagoon by a mole or sand driven across the mouth by the waves from the northeastward, which swept past the outer shore of the main rlelta. It became a harbor easy of entrance and perfect in shelter at the iuteunediate stage, when the mole had reached within a couple of miles of the main shore to the westward, at whicb time the channel-way from the baAin to the sea was in no wise dependent upon the outflow of the Lower Sau Juan, nor upon the tides, but was simply an avenue, not yet encroached upon, whose bed was the original floor of the ocean. It was not until the mole bad nearly crossed to the opposite shore that the river outflow and the tides began to act upon the bed and banks of tbe outlet, resisting the absolute closure of the basin. Opposed to the view of the case stated above is another, quite different in character, which bas been urged b:r nearly all the engineers who have viRited Nicaragua, and is not to be ignored, because, if it is the correct view, it materially alters the question of the practicability of a restoration, or, at all events, modifies the plan of improvement. In stating thie opposite theory of the case, I shall, as nearly as I can remember, repeat the words of' Don Maximillian Sonnenstern, the accomplished engineer of' Nicaragua. "The sand-bar (Punta Arenas) which now separates the Greytown basin from the sea is a part of the delta of the Lower San Juan River, and is formed from material swept down this river in floods. In formt>-r times, the Lower San Juan received a much larger proportion of the waters of the parent stream, and was able to maintain a grand opening to the sea; but recently the main

I think I ha,·e stated thl' two th'3ories fairly, aud it oul,y remains to add a few cOlll:liderations which haYl' confirmed me in the view hehl by the cornmittee of the academy: 1st. Standing upon the onte.1· heac\J of Punta Arc1)as, I \nwe lJeen witness to the moYl'lllC n oft.he Hand to the weRtward.

The on!~- tliftereuee is that ut Proviueetow1i or New 1mk we haYe tlie mole in that ear1ier stage of its formation at which it fl.Cts as a lm~akwater aml uot a liaITier. In the inter>al hetweeu Ua,ptaiu \\'est's sune,v of 18G5 aud that of Commander Lull'<> of 1872-73, there accumulated upon the western shor<>, to leeu·ard of the inlets through whith the rfrerwaters had been di.~charged, oYer twe11ty-fin~. aeres of dry sands, in addition to that fouml h,,- Captain Weist. A single line of JeyelR over these sands, made by l\ir. Menocal and myself, gave Gil feet summit ele\·ation O\'er the site or the ship-ehannel of fifteen year,; ago. 2d. The sands, etc., composing Punta. AremLs are like many other heaches, as far a;; reg<\rlls tlrn size of the grain8, etc., both on the ocea.n and basin sides.* In other words, the mole is built of scleeted material, sifted out by the long-continued action of the sea-the work not of a few years, but of centuries perhaps. 'l'ht:'se selections ha,·e lleen made from a vast deposit of mud, of which they form an exceedingly small proportiou.t Bd. The once graud entrance of Greytowu could not have been maiutained by the San J nan, even if it had \Jeon the only aveuue of discharge from the main artery. One ha8 only to divide the discharge (measnred lly any of tlle engineen;) into the cross-sections of the ship-channel giveu upon the old cbarts, to discover how powerlesR the o;eaward flow must have been. From the best computation that I can make with the data at hand, I find that in 183~ tile section of the entrance· to Grestown was scnent11 times the area that we ha>e now in the Lower Sau Juan at the head of the passes; eighteen times the section of the main river abo,·e the Colorado in clry seasons; and Beveii times the sect.ions of the main river in "top-gallant flootls "·l Rven as late as 1853, the sec· tiou at the entrance to Greytowu Harbor was fiye timeR as great as that of the main riq~r. The work of restoration.-Since the i>rincipal element in the scheme of reeoustruction is the amount of reRistance to l>e offered to these causes of obstruction which we have discussed above, it may he important, by the comparison of the two last 1mrvess, to measure, as well as we can, llow much work injurious to our purpose the natural forces are doing.

West's survey of 1865 and Captain Lull's of 1872, the narrow strip of beach westward of the meridian of the Greytown Oatllolic church has oeen continually modified in the contest between the waves of the sea and the outflows from the basin. The waves driying from tbe northeast before tile trade·winds have sought to crowd the sands directly along the shore to the :;;onth westward, while the 11ent-up waters of the basin have repeatedly burst through the beach and forced the sand!'! seawarll at the successive points of attack. 'rhe result of this contest has been that this strip of beach has mo·ed to the northwestward in the course which we may presume to be that of the resultant of the forces at work. Tllis movement has enhtrged the basin superficially, but at the expense of its uept.h. § Aside from the se<liments of the river, there seem to have been accumulations due to the forcing

Assuming that the water frout of the town has remained uncbangc>d for the di;;;tance of a 11autical mile westward of the Uatholic church, I ba'l"c been able to bring the maps of J 8G5 and 1872 together pretty well; and I have drawn a north and south line (magnetic) tl1rough a 1ioint 1,250 feet west of the chnrcl1 to define (for con\·enience) the eastern limit of the hai<iu. In the interYal between these two surveys, there has been a decided ad Yance of the bank of mud at th11 month of the Lo1..,er San ,Tuan. The comparison of the maps gives this about 40 acres; bnt it would be difficult for any two snrveyors to <~gree in the areas of these b<tnk8, because their limits are not defined. These are "drowned lall(ls'', with almost imperceptible s1opes toward the b>tsin at ma11y points, so that one cannot say just where tbe nominal shore-line 8hould be placed. There is, bowever, no donut of there ha\·iug been a considerable ad \'ance, and yet the cubical 1cater contents of the bas'in ha-ve decz.ined only 2 per cent. Tlie change in the area of dry sand is likewise uo criterion for judging of the increase of the mole which has cut off the basin from the sea. One might suppose, from the correspon1le11ce of areas between the Punta Arenas of Uaptain \Vest and that of English charts twenty years earlier. that the advance of the point lmd been made with material robbed from older parts of the beach; the strip of land seeming to have nndergone an attenuation as it crept forward. A comparison of sonndiugs outside, however, quickly dis,.,ipates this impression, and shmn; that a grt>at movement and accumulation of sand has been goiug· on along the bottom as far seaward as the four-fathom curve at least, and that the flucttiations of the dry summit are unimportant phenomena php;ically. If we compare the s1mce wlticb, upon Captain West's map, lies betweeu the inside shore-line of Punta Arenas (continued on its general trend) and tbe five-fathom curve outside, with the same actual space upon Uommander Lull's map. we find the increase of dry beacb about fifty-two acres, which, at its average height, about )) feet, wonld represent only abont a quarter of a million of cubic yards; but, taking the submerged volumes, we discover that Punbt Arenas l.Jas received deposits (on its seaward side) to the amount of five and a third millions of cubic yards, being an average of 730,000 cubic yards per annum.* As we might have expected, from the nature of the movement down the outside sbore before the sea, the most rapid accumulations have taken place at the end of the beach, where, on reaching the mainland, the further progress of the material is arrested. ITere, in a triangular space of one huudred and sixty-five acres, tlrn dry land has increased from eleven acres in 18G5, to thirty-seven and a half acres in 1872, an<l the water-volume diminished from three and a half millions, 1865, to one and a half millions, 1872. t Our purpose in stating the accumulations in this triangular space separately is to give some measure of the rapidity with which the material is likely to advance toward the end of any jetty or groin which may be extended from the beach, with a view of arresting the progres8 of the sands which might tend to encumber an artificial opening through the beach. We shall rnfer to this matter again presently from another point of view, but mnst pause here to consider the relatious of the river to tbe beach. The material of Punta ArenaR, like other beaches, is sand sifted by the sea. It is probably derived indirectly from the San ,Juan U.iver, precisely as the sands which are encroaching upon the western pier of Port Said are derived from the Nile; but we have uo data for computing how long ago the river delivered to the ocean tbe~'.enormous mass of mud from which these graius of sand have been so carefully selected. River-muds are usually over 90 per cent. sand, but mostly very fine sand as .compared with that on outside beacher;. ln illustration, I will recall an incident connected with our physical survey of Mobile River and Bay made a dozen or more years ago. Along the shore of this hay, in Garrow's Bend, there is a little belt of white saml which I could not believe was the product of the dash of the waves against the bluff, because the latter was composed of a very fine yellow clay. General Totten, however, to whom I gave specimens of both materials, sue"The wbole area of the space is seven hundred a.ud forty-two acres. Want of numerous and coincident soundings makes this a rough computation. I make the total 5,379,110 cubic yards, a.n(l the interval of time seven and a third yea.1'6. t From 3,678,400 to 1,557,802, as computed from data insufficient for nice sta.tement.

The r,owm· Sau Jnan has so extt-JHled its llelta a::; to merge its mud, of late sears, with the ,;ands of Puuta Arenas {or Isla Costilla, as the eai,;tern portion of the beach is called;, hut the gl'ound o-.;er which it iuhances is much ()fit t:ihallow, ;,;o tllat a small volume of t:it·diment;; mak ... ,, considt'rnule area. vVe han~ not succeede1l in making an,\· satisfal'tory computation of the anw1111t of (Mbrii; brought down hy this rinff, but it does not, I think, Pxceetl a hnndn·d tho11:;a111l l'uhic yards per annum as measured i11 the Greytown hasiu.

The object of tlw last-uametl work is to in·en~ut sediments from encumbering the Greytu1vn basiu, etc. This plan, a:s far as regards the main point:-; 11t<itt>d abon;, is not inconsistent with the view I ban· adopted relative to the !'auses of injnr,\· heretofore and the obrions means of resisting thc·m in the futnre, and I purpose to discuss this plan, uot to present any fnudarneutal objections, bnt to see bow it answers critil!ism from this dift'e1·eut :standpoint: 1st. .A jetty designed to arrf'st the tra n·liug sands of t IH· coa:;t most effectually should ex.tend in a dircctio11 nearly normal to the shore, and yet llave a tendeuc,Y to turn the sea slightly shoreward, so as to prevent the sands from escaping by tlw race round the e111l of the pier. The jetty plotted upon the map sent to me answers these test:,; pretty well. A position bas been chmien where a line at right angles to the general shore-line (wliich trends south west in tbis ucighhorlwod) is slightly inclined toward the direction of tlit· ::;ea, which, although create1l by the northeast tratlewind, is modified in the direction of it.s onset as it approaches the coast, so as to strike a,t a ]\'SS angle than it. would if driven directly before the wind. :!d. The jetty intended to shelter the approach to the interior basin ishonld serve as a breakwater to \'essels obliged to come to anchor outside when unable tu come iu by reason of dark 11ess, or when waiting for a tow. The jetty, as plotted, 3,000 feet long, will shelter nin<' ships under its lee, as the bottom 11ow lies, and double this number if dredging is done within a 1easonahle dista11ce of the beach awl tile entrance. These l'Stimates are bai,;ed npou tlw consideration that the will(l is neal'ly cousrant, so that vessels may be expected to swing together over an octant of 500 f'et>t radiu,,, and that the least <lepth of water required will he 18 foet. \Ve were told at Greytown that vesisels anchor at all seasons of the ,Year on this coast, aud escape injury, although they lie uncomfortably, e\'eu in ordinary weather, while tl!e trade-winds prevail. The sea of the Caribbean is often high, but it is very short from rear to frout, :,;o that a w<n-e has no great volume, aud under the 8belter of a breakwater 110 consideml>le swell may be expected. Captain Selfridge informed me that be had found the water perfoctly quiet in Pol'to Bello when the sea outside was running Yery high with the northeast trade-wind. This harbor is ii good illu:;tratiou, becan8e it is scarct-ly two miles long, and opens diYergently toward the sea. The exposure is, however, to the southward of west, so that, the sea runs away from it,. \Ve shall ba\'e occasion to refer to this again when we come to speak of ports on the Paeitic 8ide of the iiithm ns. It ma~' be found necessary to extend the jetty at Grestowu; to add a kant rtrnning westward from its extremity; but this could only be decide<l upon after ascertaining how fast tbe sands ai·e disposed to creep out on the windward sidr, and how tbe.r ma,v be iucliued to depo11it themselves beyond or within the end of the structure. We may Yenture, not without misgivings, because of the inadequacy of our inforrnation, to make an' estimate of the time that may elap8e before the sands would accumulate as dry beach out to the end of the proposed jetty. We have already seen how rapidly the accumulations have taken place

against, the west shore, and we know that we have to resist the movernent of nearly threP-qnarters of a million of cubic yards ppr annum. It is an important question, ho1c fin· the reaction of the jetty may e.:cteud to the ea.stl!:ard, because upo11 this reaction depemls the form which the bank will take at Port Said, which is situated on the flank of the delta of the Nile much in the same way that Greytown is place1l relati\TP to the main delta of the San .Juan. The acC11mulatious have taken place in long triangular h:uik:-; with bold fore shores. Instead of piling up directly again~t the jetty, the shore, for perhaps a mile, bas moved outward, each deposit against the mole ha\'i11g reacted and forrn!-'d another deposit farther bttck. In this way, the advance toward the end of the structure has been very slow. ln a >cry general Wa;\·, perli>1ps, we can detect a similar reaction along the !I bore since Pm1ta Arenas completed its :td \'ance westward; at all events, the outward movementis, although irregular from point to point, are not in any respect confined to the immediate vicinity of the obstruction (the main shore). On the contrary, they happen to be less there than farther eastwanl, althong-h the ..-olnme of accnmnlation is greater. Rejecting the shore-line, however, as being thP lpast importam contour, because the most liable to accidental movement, we shall descend to Ore. fonr- and fi n1-fathom cnr>cs and obser>e how they have advanced . . 111 the interval lwtween the snrve.r of Captain \Vest and that of Uommamler Lull, seven and a q 1rnrter sears, we find that the fore slope of' the beach, between the four- and five-fathom lines, rnoved out, in the :tverage, 100 feet per annum. At these depths, it is hardly likel;\' that the washingaway of the beach in storms bas had much effect; and, of course, one of the first steps taken (should irnpron·ment be decided upon) will be to secure this beach, so that we need not take these accidents into account. It is a curious fact that in the first 3,000 feet from the west shore (measured along the present heacb) the increase of dry land was just as great as it was for the next 7,000 feet eastward (26~ acres), whlle the accumulation above and below the water's surface was two and a quarter millions of eubic yards in the first distance, against three millions in the second.*' So that while the dry land increased its area in the vicinity of the obstruction (the west shore) more than double as fast as at poi11ts beyond its influence, the accumulation in the neighborhood of the obstruction was only at about 67 per cent. higher rat,e. Now, supposing that the reaction of the obstruction continues along shore, we may finally conclude, from the foregoing argument, that a jetty built as proposed will cause an advance of the submerged cmntours at a rate not greater in the average than 167 feet per annum; and if the bank that is formed takes the successive shapes which repeated surveys gave at Port SiLid, this rate will be reduced from year to year, because the base of the triangle of deposit will extend farther and farther eastward. There may be expected a rapid filling-up of the inner port.ion of the angle behind the jetty, especially where the water is now shallow. As the filling proceedl:l, the contours will trend more nearly parallel with the. crest-line of the wave, the reaction will extend farther along shore, and deeper water will be reached. Here are three substantial reasons for expecting a reduction in the rate of advance of the back side of the jetty. From comparisons of our recent, maps with the old British charts, it appears that tbe waves are not directly active along the space between the five- and six-fathom curves. Opposite the original opening, we still find a five-fathom channel leading up a little way toward the beach, where no deposit~ have taken })lace. This channel cas been narrowed down by encroaching banks; but there is still a com1iderable space left at the old depth. The accumulation behind the jetty will probably take a steep fore shore, and in the time we have given abov-e for this jetty to fulfill its office enough will be learned concerning the manner in which the sands are disposed to accumulate beyond the pier-head to enable the enginee.r 1wrhaps to turn this very accumulation to account in securing greater shelter to the roadstead. The Dutch have found on the coast of Holland, in using fascinage, that the traveling sand can be made to do service iu giving permanence and strength to structures designed to resist the

I have no information concerning the jetty at Port Said since 1868, the date of my visit, when I procured tracings of surveys of the successive shore-lines. I llIBcussed the Port Said Harbor in a.u article on the Suez Ca.nal, which appeared in the North American Review for October, 1869.

action of the waves. In building the proposed jett~', which I understand to be an initiatory step, it woulrl be well to use fascinage near the short>, because of its tendency to gather the sands and holding them, and because heaYier materia!R would be likely to sink. Crihs would be likely to ht> eaten by tlrn worms; but blocks of artificial stone nmde from the lime of the country and the sand of the beach would be durablt\ if we may jn<lge from the firmness of similar material used for wells and indigo vats near Rivas.* Obstruct-ions of the Lower San Juan.-A comparison of the gaugings made b_y Cliillls, West, and Lull shows that tlie Lower San .Tuan is losing its capacity of discharge, and that we may expect, at no distant day, to find this stream relinqui8hing its office as an outlet from the main river, at least in the dr_y Heason. Commander Lull's prnject proddes for hastening the decline of this stream, by placing obstnrntions in the Rhallow sectionH of the river- 11e:tr the Forks, so as to induce the main river to send all its debris to the sea through the Colora(lo. An inspection of the Jocality discouraged in m~- mind this bold pro>ision. It seemed to me hardly likely that the operation would meet with success proportionate to the cost iu tune and labor, aud might possibly be the cauRe of O\'erllows across the penimrnla betweP11 tlil' two streams, which wonltl lJear suddenly into the Lower San Juan more silt than it receives, under present conditions, during sen~ral .\-ears. 'Ve ran three short lines of le>els on~r the river-banks, two of tliem on tile peninsula, about half a mile below the forkR, and one of them at a point on the left bank, where we had ascertai1rnd that high floodR hall been seen to reach 011 rare occasions. \Ve found the peninsula banks 12 feet and the high flood-Jen"! 14. 'Ve ol>Rerved, in crossing the peninsula from the Oolorado to the Lower San ,Juan, that the land was low and swampy midwa~-, and Mr. Barnes (to whom I have before referred) stated that farther down toward the sea there were exte11HiYe interior Jagoon8. Of course, there if; nothing peculiar in this case. It is the general rule iu allu\'ial countries that tlle highest ground lies close along the river-side. Mr. Barnes informed us that the "top-ga.llant flood8 ''only came over into the interior, and they occur only ouce in ahont. four ,vears. He said be bad 011 one occasion gone from ri'\er to river in his boat about on the line that we had traversed. It would be so \·cry desirable to ha>e the LowN San Juan turned off at this point, that a careful experiment rniglit be well worth tr~-ing. But failing in this, a.nother plan of excluding the de/Jris from the Gre_ytown basin will naturally suggest itself, viz, the lJuildiug of a dam from Punta Arenas to the Gre;ytown shore, across the pasRes of the delt,a, Referring to the map, it will be observed that there is a communication between the rh·er and the sea at Ilarbor Ilead, besides the Tauro outlet, which lies farther westward. The reduced discharge of the river ought to 1iud these sufficient, or easily made so, without mnch backing-up of the stream. In connection with the Greytown harbor improvement, the shore to the westward of the Jetty and the beach behind it would require arming, as before stated, and com111unicatio11s between the hasiil and Harbor Ilead would probably have to be stopped altogether to prevent circulation. A dam then, indirectly connecting tbe proposed jetty with the main shore, near the village of Greytown, would seem to commend itself as serving man,y uses.

URA.BA MOU1'll OF THE ATRATO.

The Atrato is a delta river, and may be classed with the Danube, the Nile, the Mississippi, and other streams of great volume, which, coming abruptly upon the sea, tumble over their own debris and make their final exits by narrow passes and over shallow bauk:.3. Tile bar of ead1 particular outlet through a delta repeats, in essential res11ects, the history of the delta itself. The sudden expansion of the outflow and the resistance offered by the inert mass of water outside weaken the stream, so that it uot only ceases to scour its clmunel, but loses the power to carry out the burdens of mud which it has urought from the interior of the country. Tile case is most aggravated when a tideless river issues upon the sea, presenting a contrast of deu,,;ities; for iu this case, in addition to loss of velocity by expansion and the abrupt meeting with inei·t water, the fresh water of the river inclines to rise upon the surface of the sea, releasiug still more effectuall,y the material that it has previously pushed or rollecl along upon its !Jed. This contrast of density is sometimes the most potent cause of the bar. It is so at the mouth of the Mississippi,* and I believe it is so at the mouth of the Atrato, for, from our own observation, it was foun(l that just within the Uraba pass there was nearly a mile and a half velocity per Llour, and that beyond tht bar there was still a strong surface current; but the bar itself lay fa the dearl angle left belou: the stream as the latter rose upon the salt-zwter of the Gulf of Darien. The Uraba branch maintains a good depth of water till within 3,000 feet of the sea, and the crest of the bar, upon which there are ouly 7 feet, is scarcely 200 yards from the line of seveu fathoms upon the outside. Our obser·vations upon density were made by lowering down a dernijohu from which the cork was drawn when the required depth was n~ached. ft was not the best way to observe, but with considerable care we provided against mixing the waters, I think. I give below our results :

A half mile outside of the bar, we found the water at the surface pretty salt (1.014), and at the depth of 60 feet the full density of the sea, 1.027. The cessation of the scouring action of the outflow, conseqneut upon its rising to the surface of the sea, appears to me to be a sufficient cause for thi8 bar, without assuming unwarrantably ihat there is a large and constant supply of bar-building material in excess of the carrying power of the current. The Atrato is a turbid river, but there is no evidence, as far as I know, that it carries large amounts of material to the sea. It is true that the map indicates an enormous amount of territory reclaimed, by this river's deposit, from the Gulf of Darien, but" 1iature d()esn't lack time fur- angtMng ", says the proverb, and the question for us is whether nature is working faster than we can. Let us consider tl1is question upon such poor data as we have. While in the Gulf of Darien, I had just a glance at a Spanish chart of 1817 which we found on board of a bungo.t It 11eemed like a good chart, and I was struck with the close resemblance it bore to tile most recent maps. It <lid not appear that the delta of the Atrato had advanced sensibly during the past seventy years, in which time the Mississippi has advanced its mouth three miles into water vastly deeper than the Gulf of Darien.

In the" English Pilot, the Fourth Book, 1872", I have found a brief description of the inner basin of the Gulf of Darien \which Commander Selfridge bas named Columbia Harbor). It is called a .~alt-u:ater la7ce, nearly rounrl, ten miles across, u·ith entrance three miles acro.~s, twelt-e fathoms deep, Mid four fathoms 'inside. Opposite t.he eutrance is the" Trato HiYer". Columbia Bay of the Darien report described in similar terms would be thus: A salt water lake, oval, ten miles acros.Y (ea.yt and west) in broadest place; entrance four mile.~ across (opposite the months of the Atrato), t1vel·i:ef11.tlwm.~ Jeep, with same depth inside. These two statlc'ments agree except in the width between the delta and the opposite shore, and in the depth of the basin, both of which are greater uow than the Bnglish Pilot ventured to Rtatc. If we take the distance across the channel, between the 18-feet contonrs, we make the entrance three and an eighth nautical miles, which is nearer the old Pilot'R estimate. Oue hundred and thirty years have not reduced the area aud depth of Columbia Harbor, uor ad rnnced the mouths of Hie Atrato, we infer. The Yelocit~· at the outflow at the Urah{i moutl1 we found to be nearly one and a half nautical miles per hour upon the surface. '.rhis, of course, would be an ample scouring power if it extended to the bottom; but, as we have seen, its influence. reaches to but a small depth. Nor htn·e we any reason to suppose that an increase of the discharge would permanently improve the depth of water over tbe uar. A comparison of the depths at the mouths of the Nile, R.houe, and Mississippi, which differ amoug themselves very greatly in volume of discltarge, does not discove1· to us any iuccease of deptll dependent upon velocity of outtlow. In the case of the Danube, Sir Charles Hartley asserts that "at timeR of high floodR these bars are farther from the shore, their magnitude is com;illerably increased, and the llepths O\'ei· them are diminished." 'Vhcrc the supply of material is 'er_y large, tllere would seem to be no use in extending an<l contracting artificially the banks of the stream, unless, by making one of the mouths a salient to the geueral sweep of the margin of the delta, a littoral current is eucountered which is capable of sweeping away the muds as they are cast down. The hope of improvement in the case of the Uraba seems to me to depend upon the :;;low supply of bar-building material, and the transverse direction of the current of the- gulf that migltt be reached by ex.tending tlte rh·er-banks farther out. The second day of our stay at anchor off the Uraba lll(IUth, Oaptain McRitchie called my attention to the steady flow of the tidal current, setting nortll about one kuot per hour. We were a trifle over half a mile from the bar and in ten fathoms water. 'Ve prepared ourselves the next das to make a set of obser,Tations, but unfortunately we found this current did not recur and the outflow of the ri\Ter extended to the ship," so that I am una~le to state, from systematic observations, that the tidal currents sweep this shore with sufficient velocity to be turned to account. The tides of the Gulf of Darien belong to the same system as those of the Gulf of :\Iexico, aud nothing less than quite a long series of observations would positively enlighten us on the point. we have raised. The rise and fall is small, lmt, the relati\'e variation from day to day very large as compared with our Atlantic tides. There is one quite unfavorable feature exhibited by tbe map, viz, the most salieut portions of the delta are the least bold (compare depths in the parallel of 8° 04' with those on the parallel of so 02' and so 07'), as if the littoral current bad done not.bing toward maintainiug the depths, and the waves considerable toward washing down the bank. By computation of the tidal currents, I get no velocities through any of tlle sections over onetenth of a mile per hour, a11d our observations of densities preclmle the idea that the stream observed by Captain :McIUtchie was tl1e escape of pent-up river-water.t There may be a flux and reflux dependent upon variations in the force of the trade-winds that blow up the gulf. Oonclusimi11 relative to the improvement of the Ura,M.-There being a limited supply of material brought down by the currents of the Atrato, the mouth of the Urab{t branch may probably be kept free by dredging. The artificial extension of the banks as proposed would be useful as a means of protecting au artificial channel, and might perhaps be useful by bringing the deposits of the river within the influence of a littoral current strong enough t-0 sweep them away. - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - - --··-·----·There was no doubt a ilood in the river; the surface density at the ship declined from 1.014 to 1.007. t On returning to the ship in the afternoon (of the day I have referre<l to as that of the littoral currents), 1 found the steamer broadside to a fresh NNW. wind,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
BRITO.

This is not a harbor, nor even a roadstead in the strict sense of the word, since· there is no shelter from 8eaward, and the belt of holding-ground along the coast is so narrow that, in heavy weather from the northward, uo vessel would rnnture to seek this anchorage. At Brito, a broad valley between two ranges of hill;.; stretches down to the coast, where it seems to haYe once forwed a considerable bay, now nearly filled np with alluda from the wash of the hills and the wear of the adjacent coast. Along the margin of the lowlands, the waves have thrown up a dike of sand (remarkable for the straightness of its alignment), upon the fore shore of which, ou the occasion of my visit, tllere rolled a lleavy sea. The largest rollers were estimated at 10 feet lleight," and it was obserrnd that these broke almost simultaneously from point. to point; so that in one case the breaker presented to our view a cascade more than half a mile in length. Jn our studit>s along the Atlantic coast, we ha\·e fon11d the wave a11gle, in settled weatht1r, quite pernrnneut,-f. e., the direction from which the ground-swell comes to the shore, at tmy particular point, is the same from time to time, and that the trend of the bflach or the movements of the sand, in the long course of tilne, are iu conformity. \Vhere the beach has reached a condition of repose aud permanency, we have found its alignment about parallel with the crest-line of the ground-swell. I have, therefore, given a significance to the observations at Brito, am] hase inferred that a liue nearly at right angles to tl1e beach is that of ordinar.r sea exposure. This exposure rna,v be set down as S. i \V. (true). At San Juan del Sur, which is only nine miles from Brito, the ureaker upon the beach at the bead of the bay is noticeably reduced where the promontory forming the southern point bears to the westward of the direction of wave expoi:mre given abow·. So, also, in going down the coast, we noticed, on passing witltiu two islan<ls which lay in our course, the liearing upon which we lost the swell, and again the bearing at which we re·encouutered it. All the observations gave much the same result, the range being from SS\V. to SSE. I was unable to obtain any information of violent storms upon this coast, aud presume the~T are vers rare.t I was told that squalls from seaward occur occasionally in summer, and that there is sometimes a bard blow from tbe southwest in au tu mu. Hosser's North Pacific Pilot says that ''in July, August, September, and October gales from tbe northwest occur on the coasts of Guatemala and Nicaragua"; and Iwray's "Sitiliug Directions~' mention \V. and SW. winds as of "considerable violence in winter", causing vessels to drag their anchors iu the road stead of Sau J nan del Sur; but I llave not met with ans ship-miptain who remembers eucouuteriug strong gales ou this coast. In the plan before me, which is a tracing· from the engiueer's sheet, I find a harbor projected which consists of a jetty 1,000 .foet long, extending from tbe rocky promontory off the western extremity of the beach, and auother jetty opposite the end of the one before mentioned, extendiug nearl.Y normal to the beach, which is the continuation of the west Wftll of the portion of the harbor which it is proposed to excavate iu the lowland within the present shore-line. 1.'be area of the entire harbor is about eighty acres, and the entrance between jetties measures about 1,100 feet. The criticisms to be made upon this initiatory plan are as follows: 1st. The protection from the sea is insufficient. The longest line that can be drawn across the harhor which shall pass out mid way of the entrance ilas a course ,-ery nearly S. by E.; and, from the center of the largest circle that can be drawn within the harbor, tbe exposure is from S. 2 E. to SE. 2 S. A vessel lj'ing near this central point would be exposed, not only to those rare storms which blow from the south ward, lmt essentially to the continual swell of the sea. Moreover, the site of t,be proposed entrance to the tide-lock is open to the sea in the direction from which the waves rolled upon the shore on the occasion ot' my visit. The area of the harbor is so small, in comparison with the length of the waves and the width of the opening, that every part of it would be in a state of agitation under ordinary circumstance's. It will be remembered that the wa,·es of t,he Pacific, unlike those of the Caribbean, are very long from front to rear, so tllat C\'en were they cut off from direct acoess, they would send in and with·Others of the party who visited the scene 1.he next day reported mucil less sea, so that this may be unusual. t The hurricane of October, 1833, destroyed shipping at Pana.ma.

<lraw large masses of water by so broau an entrance, causing a rapi<l rise and fall. Suppose, for instance, that the mean level length of the wave is 500 feet, its total height 10 feet, and its profile a cun'e of sines, the volumes of water that would be driven through an opening of 1,100 feet would be over 3,ooo,ooo culJic feet, which would cause one foot minimum fluctuation in the best· sheltered part of the basin. I need not say that this would inconvenience the operations of the tide-gates and the handling of vessels bouml in and out of the canal. Again, the form of the I.Jasin is not well ca.lcnlated to secure tranquillity, m·en if the area were sufficient. By applying Stevenson's formula for "rcducti ve power" (Encyclopmdia Britannica), it will lJe foun<l that a vessel anchored near the center of the proposed harbor will find the waYes only 50 per cent. less than outside of the jetty; i. e., a 10.feet sea will only be reduced to five feet within the harbor. I suumit that tlrn history of artificial harbors, abounding as it does in failures from the causes we have just discussed, teaches us that a harbor ·to be easy of access and yet tranquil, must con· sist of an inner and oute;- port, the former having a narrow entrance within the shelter of the mole that offers partial protection to the latter. 2d. The proposed harbor is not large enough to accommodate the anticipated fleet of Yessels, even if deepened throughout. Making due allowance for a central" gangway" for vessels going to and from the canal, we find room for not more than a dozen ships riding at anchor, allowing eacl1 ship four points of swing-room over a radius of 500 feet. It i.~ much ensier to criticise a pla.n tlum to propose a better one. The truth is, I presume, that, the engineer has been cramped by the conditions of his prolJlem. He has undertaken to project au economical harbor with most of the circumstances of location and exposure against him. Ile cannot carry his breakwater farther seaward, because the depth of water beyond is too great; and he makes it the continuation of the rocky hea<lland, beeanse here he expects to obtain his supply of mate1·ia1. The one f:worable foatLue at Brito is the lowland lying behind the l.Jeach, which is evidently an alluvial deposit which can be easily excavated. This feature the engineer 11as been qnick to recognize, but he has not, I think, availed himself of it to the full extent. I Rnggest that the whole scheme l.Je enlarged; that the breakwater be isolated, so as to admit the pai;;sage of vessels arouml either end; and that an inner basin be excavated in the lowlan1l, with a narrow opening placed under the shelter of tile aforesaid breakwater. The breakwater may be depended upon to reduce the sea, at the entrance of the inner basin, quite 50 irnr cent., if it cornrs the approaches from SE. to S,V., and this entrance can be reduced to ~mo feet, so as to secure iu a hasin, say of one hundretl acre;;;, t.he nece:;;sary tranquillity. The laminated clay rock of this coast does uot appe:tr to he hard enough for use in exposed port.ions of a riprap breakwater. The material of the particular headland from which the propos1 d jetty extends, I dicl not examine, with the exception of a specimen procurt.'<l from Commander f,ull, whicll resembled other rocks that I saw on the shore, and is, I think, the same as that, fonnd in the neighborhood of San Juan del Sur, where it was observed to contain fos;;il;;; (rcnderiug 1t liable)o fracture) and to be perforated by borers uear the water-line. ConclUJ1i,ons relatfoe to Brito.-\Vith little to recommend the locality its a site for the couc<tnrn tion of a harbor, Brito presents no difficulties unfamiliar to engineers. The harbor proposed does not promise sufficient protection from the sea, is not of the most approved form, and is too small. It is suggested that a double harbor will be found necessary in order to secure tranquillity i11 the receiving-basin near the entrance or the canal; and the office of the breakwater should simpl.Y be to shelter the approach to the necessarily narrow entrance of this inner port. If, in the foregoing remarks upon Greytown and Brito, I have confined m~·self too exclusivels to the difficulties presented, it is because I not only felt requirc{l by my instrnctions to ob8erve. them, but my attention was particularly called to tbem by the ingenious commander and tlm ahle engineer of the Nicaragua Ship-canal Survey, who acted as our guides.

connection with the length of a proposed tunnel, have given to Chiri-Chiri Jlay the preference, although Limon Bay is much better adapted naturall,y to conversion into a suitable harbor. General exposure.-The voyager along the Pacific coast of the isthmus, below Panama, may be struck with the entire absence of any traces of the action of "iolent storms and flying seas. The laud-slides upon the bold cliff8 of Punta Orucis seem rather to have resulted from tbe original steepness of the hills than from tlrn dash of the sea, although the continual wear of the regular breaker has no doubt undermined them and let down the superincumbent earth. I have particularly referred to Punta Orncis, because it is a 11romontory extending into the sea and exposed to whatever degree of violence the ocean may attain. Yet, va.ssing around this spur of land, we observed that the forest extended in some places within 30 feet (estimated) of the plane of high water. Under similar circum8tanccs of exposure on our New England coast, the destructive traces of the waves are fol· lowed by the most careless eye to the height of 70 feet, and the lantern of Minot's Ledge lighthouse is sometimes enveloped by a flying sea, although it has been placed 92 feet above the ordinary level of Boston Bay.* On the other hand, while we look in vain for the traces of storms along the Pacific shore of the isthmus, we could but observe everywhere the great length and height of the ground-swell that rolls in from the ocean. The day that we reached the shore of Chiri-Chiri, we estimated the occasional height of the breaker at seven feet, and Captain Pattison, of the Saranac, informell us that a day or two previous the roll had been so great that he did not consider it safe to lower away boats. 'Ve may conclmle that, in considering the pr~ject of a harbor upon this coast, we have only to provide for au adequate stilling-basin and proper shelter in its approach against the roll of the sea. In the few days that we remained upon the coast, this roll was observecl to come from the SSW. At our first landing-place, in Uapica nay, we found that, with the outer rocks of Punta. Crucis bearing about S., the breaker on the shore was reduced by this shelter to about 2 feet, and here the vegetation upon the shore extended to within 4 feet (estimated) of the plane of highest tides. At. Limon Bay, under the shelter of the reef, which extends from the southern side of the basin, the breaker was rellnced to about 3 feet, and at Chiri-Chiri Bay there seemed to be a slight reduction of the breaker as we walked along the strand to the southward, bringing the reef below the month of Chorito Hiver to bear westwarcl of SSW. Limon Ba.y.-This cove is about half a sqmue mile in area within the chord that passes through eight, fathoms of water (see sheet No. 1 of the Darien Report). In the southern part, we have five fathoms of water at a point from which one cannot see the open oce:m. A reef near at hand offers Rheltcr from the westward, and shuts by the extremity of Punta Orncis, which is seen in tbe distance. 'Without further iuotection, however, this could not be made the terminus of a canal and the receiYiug-ba.sin for ships, because of the swell to which I have already referred. It would not be difficult to convert a portion of the cove into a tranquil basin uy iuclosing a sufficient space by sea-walls, and providing a narrow entrance under the foe of the reef before mentioned, or the same extended. If an ordinary trading-port were cont-Omplated, the simplest plan wonl1l be to extend ID()les from either shore along the chord of the cove; but. the broad opening that would be necessary to insure safe and easy access would admit too much sea for a canal-harbor. Cltiri-Oftiri Ray.-Ilere we have a bend in the coast, exposed to the swell of the ocean, with no features which could recommend it as the site for the construction of a harbor, except a narrow belt of anchorage-ground, which has ''good holding-ground of clay, in twenty fathoms, three· quarters of a mile from the beach", and an immunity from storms. These exceptions to tbe unfa._ vorable conditions of the site would be all-im·portant if we contemplated only au ordinary tradingport; but we have, as I have stated before, to provide for reducing the sea at the quays and gates of a canal-entrance, and this, I submit, can only be done by the construction of au outer and inner port. The case is similar to that of Brito, already discussed at length, except that here at Cbiri· Uhiri we find no low country behind tbe beach from which an inner basin can be excavated; both the inner and outer basins must be constructed in the narrow belt of ground lying between highwater line and perhaps the eight-fathom curve.

If we assume that material will be abundantly supplied from the canal cutting, we may suppose that the breakwater can be built in ejght fathoms at low water, which would be ten fathoms at ordinary high water. This structure would have to he placecl within about 1,300 feet of Uie sliore; and, in order to get the necessary areas for tile two basins, thiR mole would liaYc to be nearly a mile long, with a return-wall to the beach at its southern end. The pier-head of the mole I have conceived as situated in eight fatllonrn of water oft' a point 011 the shore three-fifths of a mile northwestward of the mouth of Chiri-Chiri l{iver. Here the llistauce across from the pier-head to the present eighteen-feet curve would be a thousand feet, wllich might suffice for the entrance of a ship under tow of a steamer. That the approach should be from the northward seems obvious, when we consider the direction of the swell and the shelter from wi1ul offered u~- the land. 1 have conceived of the stilling-basin as having an entrance througlt a bulkhead wall close under the lee of the mole, and not less than 2,000 feet from the pier-head. lf we concei\·e of the return-wall, at the southern end of the mole, as extending from the larger of the two rocky islands on the strand below the outlet of Chiri-Chiri Hiver, we can have a surface-area of still basin amounting, perhaps, to a hundred acres, which is no larger than it slwnhl ue. We may reckon upon a wave relluction of over 50 1-ier cent. in the outer hasin; and if' the entrance to the inner basin is reduced to 300 feet, the necessary quiet will be secured near thl', proposed entrance to the canal. The height to whicll the mole need be carried is not great. \Ye found vegetable mould still clinging to the rocks sloping to the sea witliin 15 feet (estimated) of the plane of highest tides. Conclusions relative to Limon an<l Chiri-Cltiri Bays.-There would he little difficulty iu cou 1~ert iug Limon Bay into a proper harlior for the terminus of a ship-canal; bnt Chiri-Chiri Ha;\· presents scarcely any natural qualifications to become the site of a port. In order to secure the necessary quiet at Chiri-Chiri, a mole nearly a mile long seems 1-e<1uisite, and this lying, of necessity, nearly parallel to tlie shore, arnl within a quarter of a mile of it, wonhl I.le a difficult shelter to reach in safety, sometimes, eYen under steam towage.

ECONOMY IN COAL, AS EXEMPLIFIED DY THE ACTION OF COMPOUND ENGINES DI THE UNITED STATES

COAST SURVEY STEAMER HASSLER, REPORTED BY CHARLES E. EMERY, CONSULTIKG ENGINEER.

I transmit herewith an abstract of the engiueer'i:; journal of the United States Coast Survey steamer Hassler, with tabulated results founded thereon, showing the performance of tlw steam· machiucry at sea, under conditions substantially uuiform, but, on the whole, more unfavorable th.an in ordinary practice. The abstract is made from the record of the run from Panama to San "Francisco in July and August of the year 1872, that being the first time, after the engineers were furnished with complete blank journals and careful instructions suggested by former experiences, that the vessel was under steam for a sufficient period to furnish reliable informatiou. The steamer had just come from the Atlantic coast; consequently some matters were out of repair,-for instance, a defective stuffing-box caused a poor vacuum, aml a leaky t.ube in the condenser required the use of some salt-water, both faults reducing the economy; so also the iron bottom of the >essel was very foul, which reduced the speed. The steaming for the time included in the abstract was made at half boiler-power, wbicll should have given, with clean bottom, an average speed of 7k to 8 knots under the couditio11i; encountered. Stops were made in various ports for sounding and dredging purposes Lluring the trip, so the abstract bas been divided into five runs, designated b,y letters, during each of which the conditions were substantially uniform and the steaming continnous, except one stop for dredging in each of the two first; in these, the whole watch of four hours, in which tlJC stop W&'l made, has been rejected, to secure the condition of uniform operation. The other columns will he understood from the headings. Following the abstract, I give a brief discussion of portions of the same with refer. ences to other performances of the vessel. I also append for reference a short description of the vessel and machinery. The following extracts from the instructions printed in the engineer's jourual will show tlw precautions taken to obtain accurately tbe power developed and its cost in fuel : "The steam-pressures, vacuum, and positions of throttle and cut-off, as recorded, sl10uld be the means for the hours, and not simply correct records at the time of the observation. In case that, by order or accident, the average conditions are abruptly changed during t.he hour, interlined entries should be made showing the average for each period, and the exact time of the change be noted in the remarks. "A complete set of indicator-diagrams should be taken at least once every day: for instance, shortly before the meridian, at which time t11e position of the cut-off, throttle, and the steam-press. ure, and other conditions should be regulated so as to represent, as nearly as possible, the average for the steaming done during the previous twenty-four hours. The diagrams necessary for a com. plete set should all be taken as nearly as possible at the sam.e time, aud the data provided for in the specimen diagram herein be collectc(l aud noted without ·delay. The diagrams and data should sbow the facts as they exist at the time, the object not being to obtain a maximum result or fairlooking diagrams. The original diagram shoulll be slightly secured with mucilage at its upper left. hand corner, between the pages of corresponding date in the original journal. When experimenting, diagrams should be taken half-hourly, in which case the name of the vessel and the date and time need only be noted thereon, and the other quantities can be obtained from the journal. "The reading of the engine-counter should be taken exactly at the end of the honr by observing the second-hand of the clock in connection with the other hands. "The net amonnt of coal used shonld al ways be entered in the log. To check errors, the bunk· ers should be carefully measured when empty a.nd drawn to scale, and after every fifteen days'

The 1>lan of adding a percentage to each day':,; expenditure, or of clrnrgiug for ship',,; use cxtraonlinarily large amounts, is disapprO\·cd. The log should in all respects show facts as accurately as they can he ascertained; hence eYery dt'ficieucy or surplus should be recorded as soon aR it is 1lisc0Yered, and the account adj mite1l at once." Duriug a previous \'oyage, the com mandcr of tlrn vessel, to satisfy himself as to the aecurae~· of the coal account, had issued an order tliat tl1c lrnuker-doors be locked aml opened only 011cc iu the watch in the prC"sence of the e11gi·rner, when the coal for :L wateh was to be mcasurell out. This system was productive of such go01l results that it was continued, iu cou11ectio11 with periollieal measurements of the bunkert1. Snell measurement wa>i m:vle August G, and again August 21, a 1111 a deiicieucy in the coal accon11t fon11d amomiting to G.008 per cent., wuich could he easil_y aeeonntcd for by the few lumps that fell on the floor in measuring the buckets. This percentaµ:e was iu later trials much reduced; but, not to o\·erstate results, the amounts in column marked "Coal per hour 1',y journal" have beeu increased (j per cent,,, and the augmented or actual amounts, recorded in tl10 uext column, ha\'e been used in the tiual determination of the cost of tile power. The aboYe shows that, 1:wen with a comparatively small compouml engiue of good construction, each indicated horse-power can be obtained, on regular 1lnty at sea, for 1~ pouutls of coal per honr, or less tlrnn half that required with ordinary marine macllinery of the old type, and hardly two tl1inl~ that used, according to best testimony available, in the better class of large, direct-cxhanstiug marine engines using bigh-presi:mre steam. This cannot be called an experir1wntal rmmlt. In fact, the nnfaYorahle co1Hlitions me11tio11l'1l prevented it from lleing the maximum for regular sea dnty. 'l'here is e\·ery reason to llelieye that, with careful attention, and lloth l)(}ilers in use, a result co1tld ha\·e been obtained of one aml a half pounds of coal per horse-power per hour. In fact, some pre\'ious runs show this perfor111auce; l1u t a:s they were made before the coal account was checked regularly hy the lrnnkcr 11wmmreme11t, the results are not gh·en in det.ai1. Them is, howe\'er, no reason to don ht their accuracy. The yessel on her trial-trip, irning Schuylkill coal and hotll boilers, deYeloprnl l:.l.) l10r,,;e-power with 250 pounds of coal per hour, a performance of 2 pountls of coal per horse-power pe1· honr when the lioiler and engines were not felted and the weather quite cold. The ti l'llllW11, too, were uot accustomed to tlle slow combustion obtained hy using two boilers, and nmel1 watchfulness was required to instll'e regulation by the dampers instead of by opening fun1ace-tlnnr8. 'l'his diflicnlt,\· caused a very great waste of fuel afterward, when it was attempte<l to run llll)[leratt·ly with lJoth boilers on regular duty at sea, and, finally, it was actually funnd, in practice, that unles.-> au engineer was kept eonstantl;y in t.be tire-l'oom, it was far more eeouomical to fm·cl' the _rircg under om.· boiler at slo~ speeds than to use slow combustion in two boilers.* Only one boiler was in use during the runs set forth in the foregoing abstrnet. The following extracts, from the official report of Commander C. ,Johnson, U.S. N., co111ma111l· ing the Hassler, may, I think, be eonsicfored in place in this report: "It gives me Jlleasure to request notice of the consumption of coal while eng;tge4l i11 snd1 \\'ork as the Hassler was designed for.

Besides weighing, the bunkers are frequently examined and their contents measured." In a subsequent letter, Commander .Johnson writes: "We have been fifty-eight days under steam, running from daylight till dark gtmernlly; banked fires at night and Sundiiys; am] have consumed iu the furnaces only 18!.ll.4 ponnds of coal per twenty-four hours, or 0.844 of a ton per day_ "There is no mistake about it.

For eon\'cuicuce of reference, a general dcscrii>tion of the Hassler is hereto annexed.

General deseription of the United States Coost Sm·vey steamer Hassler.
The Hassler is hll iron screw-propeller of 330 to11s lmrthen old mcasnremeut. She was uuilt at Philadelphia in the year 18il, and is 151 feet long ou load·li1w, and has 24~ feet breadth of beam and 10 feet depth of bold. Her rig is that of a tbrce-mastell schooner, with lower masts of moderate length and tall topmasts. The officers' quarters arc on deck, and are very commodious. The vessel is propelled uy a compound engine of 200 horse-power. The cyli11deri:; are 18.l and 28 inches in diameter by 26 inches stroke, and are arra11ged one auo\·e tlie other in the same line, with botl1 pistons on tlie same rod, and OJ)erating the crank through a singlL1 connecting-rod. The steam-chests extend besond the ends of the cylinders, to reduce the length of the C,Yliullerports; but, for simplicity of constrnction, the vah·e-face of the upper cylinder i" brought out in line with the other, and the valn·is of liotli cylinders are operated by the :,;ame rnd:,;. The nppt'I' c;dinder is supported from the framing by four wrought-iron columns, and the two cyliIHlers are sufficiently separated to allow the coYer of the lower cylinder to lie raised to o!Jtaiu access to the ph;ton. The bed.plate is made of sufticieut length to receive three llearings, in atldition to which an independent thrust-bearing is connectecl to the same. The surface-coutlenser is arranged under one side of the frames, and 8lauts inward at the same augle as the latter. The circulation ls performed by a centrifugal pump, driven directly by a small eugine. The air- and feed-pumps are vertical, and receive motion from the main cross l.Jead through beams itt the usnaJ way. The necessary valves are provided so that lh'e steam can be excluded from the upper c,ylinller and supplied direct to the larger one if desired. Ordinarily the steam passes to tlle upper cylin<ler, in which it is cut oft' at such point as to give the power desired, or usually at less than half-stroke. The steam then passes to a large reservoir, placed under the main deck, through whicli it traverses slowly, thus permitting the water due to condensation for tlrn work done to become separated. From this reservoir, the steam passes to the lower cylinder, but tlie supply is suppresse(l therein at such point as to keep th<' pressure in the reservoir substantially uniform. The lower cylinder communicates with the condenser in the usual way. The large cylinder and its bottom and head are sfoamjackete<l. Drip-vessels with glass gauges are iuovided to assist in blowing the condensetl water from the jacket and reservoir. The propeller is a true screw, 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, with 13 feet pitch. At the hub, the blades are rounded on l.Joth sides to reduce the resistance where the metal is thickest. The flat propelling surface gradually widens from tlie hub outward to 4 feet diameter, and the outer portions of the blades are of the ordinary construction. Steam is supplied by two flue and return tubular boilers, each 6 feet in diameter and 12 feet lo11g, and provided with a steam-chimney. The total grate-surface is 42 square feet and the total heating-surface 1,400 square feet. The shells are it inch thick, with double-riveted longitudinal seams. All flat surfaces are stayell 6 inches between centers. The boilers are considered of sufficient, strength to ca.rry regularly 80 pounds pressure for a series of years. The maximum speed of the vessel, under steam alone, is 91 knots. Under steam and sail, she has ma.de easily 1() am.111 knots. The ordinary speed at sea, under flteam alone, is restricted, by order, to 8 knots, which can be obtained with one boiler under favorable circumstances.

It will be of interest to add, in tbis connection, tliat tbe first reports as to the performance of the Hassler were unsatisfactory, owing to very bad management in the engineer department. Tbe vessel left the Atlantic coast in the fall of 1871 ; and as her commander found it necessary to take coal much sooner than was expected from results obtaiued on the trial-trip, he instituted au investigation, which had the effect eventually to make tlrn performance all that could be desired, and to interest all on board in the matter, so that in fact a number of naval officers, then attached to the Yessel, but who lmYe recently returnec.l to the East, ban~ expmsse11 a desire that the actual facts as to the vessel's later performances sboulcl be mmle public.

The a})paratus, as shown in the annexed iignre, differs from anything that I lrnve seen, and, from its simplicity, coul<l be manufactured ou hoal'd any ,-esscl carrying sl1ot, the cost being so trifling as scarcely to be cousideretl. The accompl111ying lithograpl1, after a drawing, shows the apparatus attached to a shot. It consists of two wires, one cud of eacli being bent to form a" cant-hook", and the other and longer end being bent around allll '1arrie<l under the shot, and at a distance below it equal to about one-third of its di:imeter. The irnrts wbich cuter t11c holes in the shot should he as short as will sufilcc to support the weight. If either hook trip, the other must follow. I baye experirnenteu with the apparatus "hen attached to a grape-;;bot-snch as is nsc'l in an 11-inch gun-and it WOI'ked satisfactorily on ally kind of bottom. Jts firnt failure to detach was in soft mud, or ooze, which entirely coYere<l the shot. On hauling np, the bare e11ds of tl10 hooks were just hisille the holes. I cut off half the length of tho hooks, after which tlle apparatus, on all occasions, tletachml perfectly when bottom was reached, an<l 8npported the shot with certainty wl1e11 lowered qnick1.r agai11st the snrfacc of the.water a 1mmher of tinw.s in succP"Rio11.

IMPROVED CLAMP FOR THE TELESCOPE OF THE THEODOLITE.

Co.A.S'r SURVEY OFJ<'ICE, lVashington, May 4, 1874.

DEAR Sm: Having experienceu mnch inconvenience with the ordinary clamp and movement for vertical motion of the telescope of the theodolite, especially when reversing for azimuth, I, last season, devised a method of clampiug, which possesses all the good qualities of the ordinary clamping and does away with B its bad qualities. I. The telescope is clamped with sufficient firmness t-0 admit of its being moved in the vertical plane by means of tbe tangent. screw. I \ ,,,..,..~·~r ~·~II. The top of the clamp is open so that it permits the tel\I I " ' , " " --escope to be lifted out for reversal, and placed again in the Y's 1 \ without carrying the clamp with it. E III. By adjusting the spring, the clamp may be made to hold ! \ the pivot so gently that a very delicate tap on the telescope will bring the latter to the desired elevation. The accompanying wood-cnt will exhibit its peculiarities. H I one of the transit-axis support& or pillars, with end of pivot in / \ ' \ Y. A is a rigid bar, about ! or t inch wide, held in position by the small bar C, secured to the pillar, and passing loosely through \ ! a slot in A, and b,r the end of the spring F passing through the 1\ projection K from the pillar I. B is a spring secured to the l>ar A \ , at H. D is the screw for drawing the spring B toward the l>ar A, \\ 1 and thereby clamping the pivot. G is the screw giving mo\Te· ,\ ment in the vertical. J is a projection from tbe pillar. ,1 This clamp may l>e placed outside the pillar on the free end G 1: "· of the pivot of the transit-axis, or inside the pillar on a collar of \ FJ 1 the transit-axis. ---· ~ ~- ~-Yours, respectfully, GEORGE DAVIDSOS, Assistant, United Sta.tes Coast Surl'ey. Mr. C. P. PATTERSON, Superintendent Ooast 8ur11ey, Wa.s1tington, D. 0. This clamp applies equally well to the transits ir1 u~e on the Survey.-l>.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

DESCRIPTION OF AN OCEAN SALINmIETEU, BY J. E. HILGARD, ASSISTA.KT UKlTED STATES COAST SURVEY.

The ucusity of sea-water in uifforent latituues aud at l1ifl'erent depths is an elcmcut of so great importance in the stud~T of ocean physics as to ha\-e canscu a great deal of attention to be paid lately to its determination. The instruments employe<l for the purpose have been, almost without exception, areometers of various forms. Tue differences of ueusity as arising from saltiness are so small, that it is necessary to lmvc a very sensitive instrument. As the density of ocean-water at the temperature of 60° Fithr. only varies between the limits of 1.02± aud 1.029, it is necessary, in order to determine differences to the hundredth part, that we should be able to observe accurately the half of a unit in the fourth decimal place. This gi\·es a great extension to the scale an<l involves the use of a series of floats if the scale starts from fresh water, or else the instrument assumes dimensions which make it unfit for use 011 boaru ship. 'Vith a view to the convenient auaptation to practical use, the ap1laratus figured uelow hns been deYised for tl1e Coast Survey by Assistant Hilgard.

1.02s

The instrument consist~ of a single float Hbout 9 inches in length. The scale extends from 1.020 to 1.031, in order to give sufficient range for the effect of temperature. Each unit in the third place,:or thousandths of the density of fresh.water, is represented by a length of 0.3 of an inch, whicl(is:snbdi\·i<lecl into fiTe imrts, admitting of an accurate reading of a unit iu the fourth place of 1lecimals by estimation. 'l'lle 11oat is accompanied by a copper can, with a thermometer inserted within the cavity, which is glazed iu front. In use, tbe can is nearly .filled with water, ao as to

overflow when the float is inserted, the reading being then taken with ease at the top of the liquid. For convenience and security, two such fl.oats and the can are packed together in a suitahle case, and a supply of floats and thermometers, securely packed in sawdust, is kept on hand to replace the broken ones. The following table has been derived from the observations of the ex:pansibility of sea-water made by Prof. J. S. Hubbard, U. S. N. Column II contains a taule of reductions fur temperature of salinometer readings to the standard of 60° Fahr. To facilitate the use of this table, the following directions are given.Record the actual observation of hydrometer and thermometer. From Column Il (which is applicable for any degree of saltiness within the given limits) take the number corresponding to the observed temperature, and multiply this number by the number of degrees and fractions of a degree that the observed temperature differs from Goo. Apply this product as a corrt>ction, with proper sign, to the reading of the salinometer, and the result will be the reading of the salinometer at the standard temperature of 600 Fabr. Example.-Actual reading of thermometer= 80°.5; actual reading of salinomet~r = 1.02425. Opposite 80°.5 in Column II is +0.0001585, which multipliell by 20.5 gh·es as a product +0.003249. Add this to the observed reading of salinometer, and 1.027 50 ""ill result as tLe reading of the salinometer at the standard temperature. --------1- - - - - ---- - TPmp.

A method~quite different in practice for determining the density of sea-water has been suggested by Prof. Wolcott Gibbs, of Harvard University. It depends upon the determination of the index of refraction by means of an angular instrument similar to the sextant. As all navigators are familiar with the use of the sextant, and as the observation can be made without hinderance from the motion of the ship, this form of the instrument may be found tQ posser;s certain advantages. NOTE IN 1876.-When the table of reductions for temperature above given was constructed, the investigations relative to the same subject made by Thorpe and Riicker (Royal Society's Proceedings, January, 1876) were not known. The following comparison of the results of the experiments on the thermal dilation of sea-water, as taken from Professor Hubbard's tables and as derived from the results of Thorpe and Rucker, show the differences within the range of temperature co>ered by our table of corrections :

APPENDIX No. 17.
DESCRIPTION 01<' TWO FORMS OF PORTABLE APPARATUS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF PERSONAL EQUATION, ROTH RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE, IN OBSERVATIONS OF STAR TRANSITS, BY J.E. HILGARD, ASSISTANT UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

It has long been apparent that the precision ot instruments used in the determination of at'ltronomical time exceeds, both in accuracy and constancy of performance, the physiological powers of the observer, to whose variability is due a large proportion of the probable error of results. This has been especially felt in the determinations of longitude made by the telegraphic method, in which we find, on different nights, variations in the results which far exceed the apparent uncertainty of the determination of time, and of the transmission of signals. We also find that, when observers compare their method of observing directly, while their personal equation appears in a great degree constant ori any one occaston, it will differ on another occasion by an amount far exceeding the uncertainties of determination. It has, therefore, long been felt as a great desideratum to have some convenient means of determining the personal equation of an observer at the time of the observations for longitude. If eaclt observer possessed a similar instrument to which he could refer himself, and which was so exact in its adjustment that the same conditions could al ways be produced within the ·limits of accuracy demanded, the result of each night's work could be referred to a standard equation. This would preferably be the absolute equation, or that by which the observations of each observer are referred to that instant of time at which they would be recorded if no time elapsed between the passage of a star and the record of the passage. Various instruments have been devised by different observers for the determination of absolute personal equation. It has been found that the phenomena to be observed should be very closely imitated, in order to make the equation so obtained applicable to the actual case, inasmuch as its amount will differ in the same person, according to the character of the phenomena observed, and the means by which the time is noted or recorded. In order to make the method applicable to star-transits, it is, therefore, desirable that an artificial star should be made to traverse the optical field in which it passes over a system of lines similar to that used in actual observations. It cannot even be deemed quite admissible that this should be done with only a. single line, bnt at least five should he used. The most desirable arrangement appears to be that of making an artificial star-image traverse alternately in opposite directions the field of a collimating t('llescope, a system of electrical contacts being so adjusted in connection with the mechanism that a record is made of the instant when the image of the star passes the several lines in the field of the collimator. A few transits ot' this sort, automatically recorded, and likewise observed and recorded in the usual manner at the beginning and end of each night's work, will make the observer's results at different times more nearly comparable than they are now, and likewise comparable with the results of other obson·ers ; and we may a.n ticipate that hereafter such an apparatus will be deemed a necessary part of the outfit of a permanent observatory. Some yea.rs ago a rudimentary arrangement of the kind was used by Professor Winlock, at Harvard College Observatory, but the movement of the star-image was not effected by mechanism but by the hand of_ the observer with the aid of a long lever. · Such a movement, of course, lacked uniformity, and as no results have ever been published we may assume that they proved unsa~:~factory. In ·1873, the writer caused to be constructed at the Coast Survey Office a personal-equation apparatus on the same plan, intended for field use. In this it was designed that any residual error in the adjustment of the electrical contact relative to the coincidence of the star-image with the line should be eliminated by the alternate movement from right to left and left to right. The

TlIE UNITED STATES COAST SUltYEL

apparatus, ho,,ever, failed to give results of sufficient accuracy, partly from llll·clrnuieal defects iu the construction, but chiefly owing to the small linear dimensions of the line-interntls, which rendered it impractical>le to obtain snflicieu t precision for the antoruatic record of tile passagl'S. It was then decided to adopt a fieltl in which the space represented lly a second of time should he snfliciently great to admit of its snbdiYision to one hundredths of a second with a perfect faeility. Tbe instrument figured in tile plate, Form I, and described below, was, in consequence, <1e\·i~ed :And constructed by Mr. Werner Suess, under tbe immediate direction of the writer. lu this exceedingly compact apparatus the passage of au artificial star across tlw tnidtlle transit-line can be registered to furnish, in connection with its obsen·ed d'ansit, a measure of the aliso. lute personal equation of au obsen·er. For tl1e automatic registration, the clock (or chronometer) break8, and the automatic breaks, as the st:tr passes, each of the fin~ lines, are in 011e electric circuit, while the breaks for the apparent transit, by the obsen·er, a.re effected through a srcoml circuit, the two showing their marks 011 t'1e same cLronographic 8heet, a11d sille by side. Tlw rays of light of au ordinary coal-oil lamp a.n>, couvc·.ve<l to a focus and shown through a film piu-lto1e (t) iu a diapbragm insertrd in a tnhe (B) \Yhich is moYed to a11 fro h.r elock-work.

The other trausit-lines serYe to determine, <l~ffercn tially, the personal equation of two observets. The important peculiarities of this new appparatns are as follow~: (1). It is easily portable, weighing only eight pounds. (2). The circuit-break (shown lly b, c, d, c,f) can be so a1lju8Led that the >ita1· appears either before or after the breaking of the current, thus I'<'qniring onl_y Oll{' pen for the observations, a very important point whtm used in the fiel11. (3). As the star appea1·s on the the transit lines witl!out parallax, two or more ol>serTers cu11 ob~rve tbe transit of the star over the lines at the same moment, each one nsing bis own chrono graph and chronometer, thus giving the mea11s for a differential comparison of tlieir person:tl equations. Following is au allstract of results obtained with this iustrument.

Assistant U. A. Schott kindly undertook the immediate supervision and criticism of the details of constructio11, which were, as before, eu~cuted by ]\fr. Suess.

UEPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

In reading off the chronograph sheet and fillet, the chronometer break preceding the first break of the apparatus or ouserver is taken to read zero. '.rhe absolute time is of no consequence, and this method secures small numbers. The columns heade(l "App." give the readings of the autom1itic breaks of the apparatus, aud tlte columns headed ·'Obs'r" give the corresponding fillet-readings of the observer's breaks. The personal e<1uatiouA- 0= -11 indicates the ollsen·er to lJe late of tLe ap11aratus by n secouus. Or since time of A is perfect for absolute measures, a negative indicates observer to be late or slow by that amount. Observations similar to the above were made on the 3d and 5th of January. Below is a tabular statement of the results: ,

A careful scrutiny of the above observations shows that the precision of tl1e instrument is quite satisfactory, aud t!Jat the variations in the single results are to be ascribed to actual errors of observation. It would have been desirable to make the construction such that tlle transits in either direction could be obsen·ed consecutively, but the necessary breadth of the non-conducting lines requires that the adjustment of the star-breaks he made of either their right or left haucl edges. The apparent direction of the transit is, however, readily changed by the use of an inverting eye-piece.

APPENDIX No. 18.
TRANSATLANTIC LONGITUDES.
FINAL REPORT ON THE DETERMINATION OF 187~, WITH A HE\'IEW OF PREVIOUS DETERMINATIOXS. BY J. E. HILGARD, ASSISTA:N"T. PART I.

The determination of the exact longitude of some point in the triangulation of the Coast Survey, with reference to the principal observatories of Europe, is one of the most important problems of the work; and the various means known to science have been successively brougt1t to bear on its solution. The Coast Survey Reports from 18-!4 to 1866 show that the metl10ds of moon-culminations, of chronometer-transportation, and of lunar occultations have each in turn recei\'Cd a largp, share of attention. The latter method, howe,·er, has not yet yielded the fnll results that may be expected of it in consequence of the infrequency with which corresponding obser>ations hwrn been obta.ined in Europe and America; but it cannot be doubted that, with a suitably organized system of observation, the method will eventually give results of great Yalu". Upon the successful completion of the Atlantic telegraph-cable from Irelaud to Xewfoumll:wd, measures were at once taken to make use of it for the determination of the lougit11de differeucc between the two countries by the "American method" of telegraphic time-signals. This method was conceived by Mr. Sears C. \Valkcr, of the Coast Surrny, and first practiced by hiin on the night of October 10, 1846, when time-signals were successfully excirnuged oYer a telcgrapb-line which united the Observatory at 'Vashington and the Central High School Obsen·atory at Philadelphia. JUr. Walker's account of tbis work is published iu the Coast SurYey Heport for 1846, Appendix :Xo. 11. The results of the operations between Ireland and Newfoundland, conducted lly Dr. H. A. Gould, have beeu given at length in the H.eport for 18G7. Although the longitude value thus obtained was far more nearly certain than that of au,\- previous determination, there was still left a larger margin of doubt as to its precision than is desiraule in a fundameutal determination. Tliis uncertainty, which probably does not exceed a quarter second of time, is due to tlrn fact tliai tlwre "as no determination of the personal equation difference between Mr. Dunkin, the Greenwich "stand· ard observer," and l\lr. Boutelle, the Coast Survt\Y observer at Calais; aml that while we can measure the total time of transmission of signals through the cable aml back agaiu, we are uuahle to separate the duration in opposite directions, aud are obliged to assume it to be equal-an assumption which may not be exact within a sensible fraction of a second. When the laying of the French cable frorn Brest, France, to Duxbury, Mass., afforded an independent means of verifying the former result b:'j' obserYations under entirely different couditions, the opportunity was promptly seized, and the Jon~itude between Brest and Duxburs determined by Mr. G. W. Dean, assistant in the Uoast Sarvey, as set forth in the Report for 1870. At that time, however, no cable was in operation between Brest and England ; so l\Ir. Dea11 was unable to carry bis determination direct to the obsen·atory at Greenwich. Such a cable haYing been subsequently laid, tbe wanting link in the chain of longitude was supplied during the summer of 1872 by the writer, who had temporarily given up the charge of tbe Coast Snn-ey Office at Washington in order to bring this much-desired operation to a satisfactor_y conclusion. \Vhile re-occupying Brest for that purpose, it was thought !Jest that the expel'iments through the Freuch cable should be repeated, with the addition of an intermediate station at St. Pierre, where the long cable makes a landing; and Assistant George \V. Dean was placed in charge of the operatious on the American side. Tbe general plan of the work was to unite at Brest time·signals from St. Pierre, from Greenwich, and from Paris, sent at nearly the same time and compared by means of the Brest chrono-

graph; and to determine the personal equations of the several observers through oue of them, who should observ-c successively with all the rest. This was done by ~lr. Francis Blake, jr., subassistant in the Coast Survey, by whom the writer was ably assisted throughout the work. Through the kindness and assistauce of Sir George B. Airy, the astronomer royal of England, and of Mr. Delaunay, the distinguislrnd director of the Paris observatory, whose lamented death occurred while the operations were in progress, and through the generous courtesy of the French Atlantic Telegraph Company, and of the Submarine Telegraph Company, the work was brought to a successful conclusion during the month of September, 1872. In the course of these operations the longitude between Paris and Greenwich was determined inciuentally in two different ways; first, in July, via Brest, and afterward in September, between Greenwich and Paris direct, through the submarine cable via Calais. The two determinations were not entirely independent of each other, since the personal-equation difference between l\fr. Blake and the Paris observer enters into both; but the near satisfaction of the equationBrest- Paris+ Paris-Greenwich+ Greenwich- Brest = o, or the closing of that "longitude triangle," must entitle the results obtained to great confidence. Before reciting the principal results a brief description will be given of the stations occupied and the instruments used during the work. SECTION I. CAMBRIDGE. The Coast Sun·ey station at Cambridge was within the grounds of the Harvard College Observatory, 108 feet-or o~.09G of time-west of the center of the great equatorial dome of the main building, to which point our longitudes are usually referred. From the center of the meridian circle in the west wing it was 73 feet 5 inches west and 39 feet north. The station is marked by the two transit-piers which stand in an east aud west line. They are of granite, dressed to 9 inches square at the tops, and so placed as to be 3 feet above ground, aJ?.d their outside edges 2 feet 9 inches apart. They weigh about a ton each. The longitude observations at this station were made by 1\Ir. Edwin Smith, of the Coast Survey, who used the following instruments: C. S. Transit No. 5, wade by Messrs. Troughtou and Simms, of London, and provided with a reversing apparatus by JHr. William Wurdemann, chief mecbanician of the Coast Survey at "'ashington. 'rhis instrument., which was mounted upon the granite piers before mentioned, has an object-glass 2.75 inches in diameter and 46 inches in focal length ; and a diagonal eye-piece of which the maguifyirig power i1:1 about ninety. A new glass diaphragm made by Prof. William A. Rogers, assistant Harvard College Observatory, was substituted for the usual system of spiderlines. This <liaphragm is of very thin plate· glass, upon which are ruled twenty-five double lines in groups of five lines each. Stars are observed when midway between these double lines, which are about two tenths of a second of time apart. For convenience in recording, each group is designated by a letter and each line by a number. This notation will be readily understood by a reference to the accompanying diagram, (Fig. 1), which shows the order in which a star crosses the lines at upper culmination when the perforated end of the transit axis is to the westward. This position of the transit-instrument is denoted in the record by "Lamp west." For the reversed position, on '' Lamp east," the star crosses the lines in the inverse order.

There is also a micrometer-thread, which was used in determining the ftexure of the transitinstrument. The observations for this purpose are described in Section Xlll of tliis report. The striding-level used bas been attached to the instrument for many years. It is marked "Al;" and the value of one division of its scale, as determined with the meridian circle of the observatory during the season's work, is 1.02 seconds of arc, or 0.068 seconds of time. The transit-observations and longitude-signals were generally recorded upon a" Bond spriuggo>ernor register," which belongs to the observatory, aud is there known as the "north cluonograph ;" but occasional use was made of the '"west clironograph," a similar instrument, mounted in the west wing near the meridian circle, with which it i8 ordinarily userl. These chronogrnphs were made by Messrs. \Villiam Bond & Sons, of Boston, and are similar to tbe one fully describerl in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College. (Vol. I, Part I, page xlix.) The standard sidernal or "south clock" of the observatory was used throughout the work. This clock was made by Frodsham, of London, and is provided with a break-circuit attachment by which each second of time is recorded upon the chronograph excepting the zero-second at heginning of every minute, which is omitted.
SECTION

II.

ST. PIERRE. The observations a.t St. Pierre were made by Mr. Edward Goodfellow, assistant United States Coast Snrvey, aided by Mr . .A. II. Scott. · St. Pierre Island is the most southeru and eastern of the three islands composing the Miquelon group, off the south coast of Newfoundland, aml just to the westward of the entranct> to Placentia Bay. It is about five miles long and from a mile to two miles wide, and consists maiuly of a series of rocky ridges, rising abruptly from the sea, with a narrow plat~au at their soutberu base upon which the town of St. Pierre is built. By permission of the governor of St. Pierre, a site for the temporary observatory was selected just outside the town limits, and within a convenient distance from the .French cable office. By measurements upon the French .Admiralty Chart No. 303, the station is 2,121.95 meters (l' 8 11 .7) north and 1,331.42 meter::; (l' 2".8) west of Galantry Head Light, the approximate position of which isLatitude, 460 46' 3 11 north ; Longitude, 560 9' 2" west of Greenwich . .After the departure of the Coast Survey party from St. Pierre, Commander W. F. Maxwell, H. N., observed for latitude at the pier whicli marks tlw longitude-station. Under llate of St. ,John's, N. F., December 9, 1872, he communicated the results of hi!; obsen·ations to l\Ir. Goodfellow as follows: ''The latitude of your observatory I found to be 460 46' 51".!! N., the mean of a number of observations of Polaris on the north and ,, Pegasi and P .A.quarii ou the south.'' The figures 46° 46' 51" N. have accordingls been adopted for tlle latitude of the Coast Suney longitude station at St. Pierre. To mark the station-point after the longitude-observations were ftnishcd, a granite slab, 36 by 30 inches in cross.section and 7 inches thick, w<is set in the ground as a foundation-stone for a granite pier. The top of the slab is 14 inches below the surface, and in its center is a copper bolt rnarkiug, below the surface, the position of transit center. This slab having been well secured iu its position, a granit.e pier was placed upon it in an cxca. vation made for the purpose on its upper surface. This pier is 21 by 15 incheo; in cross-section and 49 inches long, dressed smooth for a distance of 38 inches from the top. In a drill-hole at ceuter of rop is inserted a copper bolt! of an inch in diameter and 3 inches long. The intersection of two cross-lines cut upon this bolt marks the center of transit-instrument, the point of reference for latitude and longitude.

The pier projects 35 inches above the surface of the ground, and has on its top the inscription :

u. s.c.s.
1872. A strong wooden fence, 7 feet squarP, was built around it, and assurances were obtained from the government of the island that the inclosure shoul<l be carefully guarded from molestation. The Uoa>1t SurYey Transit No. 6 was used at this station. In size and construction it is precisely similar toITransit No. 5, already described in Section I. It was mounted upon two blocks of !'leasoned oak, 6 feet long and 10 by 12 inches in cross-section. These blocks were secured firmly to each other, at the proper distance, by stroug planking, for a length of 2 feet from the base, so as to make a very solid foundation for the inRtrumeut when the whole structure was set up}"ight, with its base 33 inches below the surface of the ground: and the space between and around the blocks filled with sand and {.!.Tfn·el, well rammed down. The value of one division of striding-level marked "B" is 0".86 of arc. The reticule consists of twenty-Jhe spider-lines, arranged in groups, or " tallies," of five lines each at equatorial intervals of about two and a half seconds of time. Fig. 2 shows the s:rstem of notation and the order in which a star cmsses the 1ines at upper culmination, lampcwest.

There is also a micrometer-thread which \Vas used in making the observations for flexure of transit·instrument. These obsernltions were made at Cambridge in connection with the observations for personal equations, and are described in Section XIII. The transit-observations and longitmle-siguals were recorded upon a Bond "spring-governor" chronograph similar to the one used at Cambridge. This cbronograph was graduated by Frodsham break-circuit chronometer No. 3462 up to .Tnly 6, when, owing to a defect in the working of its break-circuit apparatus, No. 3451, by the same maker, was l'Ubstituted for it. For the loau of this chronometer, as well as for the loan of the chronograph, the Uoast Surve~· was indebted to Prof. ,loseph "\Vinlock, director of tlw. IIan·ard Collt'ge Observatory. In obserdng for time, the stanuard-clock stars of the American Ephemeris werP, preferred; but any long intervals in tllat list were filled with ;,tars from the Pulkowa List of 1869. Mr. Goodfellow is sw~cially indebted to the Hon. l\f. M. Jackson, CJnited States consul at Hal· ifax, for his kinduess in o\)taining permiRsion for the transportation of the Coast Survey party to St. Pierre by one of the steamers of the (-luebec and Gulf Ports Steamship Company. M. l'Heareax, commandant. of the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, extended every facility for the establishment of the observatory and mauy personal courtesit>s to the officers of the Jlarty. To .!\fr. Gott, manager of the St. Pierre office of the .French Transatlantic Cable Company, aud to .Mr. 'Vard, his successor, tlrnnks are dne for the promptnf'ss and friendly co-operation with which the arrangements for cable-excbauges were made. The same acknowledgments are due to Mr. A. 1\1. Mackay, superiuteudent of the New York, Newfonndlarnl, and London Telegraph Com-. pany, at St. John's, N. F., and ro Mr. Ster·henson, chief operat-0r, and Mr. Earle, his assistant, at St. Pierre. After the longitude-work was finished, through the kindness of Admiral Surville, commandant-in-chief of the fieet of the Antilles, the Coast Survey instruments wer~ taken to New York on board his flag-slnp, the " Minerve."

BREST.
The Coast Survey station at Brest was on the Place du Champs de Bataillc, in frout of the buildings on the Rue St. Yves, occupied by the Transatlantic Telegraph Cornpa11:r and the GoYernment Telegraph of France. A loop ofimmlated copper wire connected it with the cable te8ti11groom and the goyernme11t office. H waE fomid to he 8.4() 8CCOJH18 of arc sonth aml 0.±-18ecouds of time east of the tower of St. r,ouis Clnncb, a point in tile trigonometrical surn·y of France. The temporary lmilding erected for an observatory was 13 feet long, 8 feet \Vide, and 9 feet high. It was divided into two compartments b,\· a trans,·crse pal'tition set 4 feet from the western end. In the larger compartment C. S. Transit :No. J was mounted upon the granite piers used by Mr. Dean in 1869-'70, they having been hronght from the site of his obsenatory within the grounds of the Establishment <1es PupilleH de la i\Iari1w. 'l'hiH instrnmeut, which has been used iu the senice for more than twenty years, was made i11 London, l>y .:\'fesHrs. Tronghton & Simms, and is similar in size and construction to the ones already ment1oued aH badng been used at CamhridgP and St. Pierre. It bas a clear aperture of !.l.75 inches, a focal length of 45 inches, anrl a transit axis of :!5 inches. It is pro\·ided with a reversing apparatus, by which the position of the perforated piYot can be changed in less than half a minute; a striding-leYel witL scalP, one division of which is equal to 0.945 seconds of arc; a diagonal eye- piece of a power of about ninety-fl ve; aud two illuminating lamps placed on small shelves unconnected with the instrument. The ol<l system of twenty-ifre spider-lines, in groups of fh·e each, was remm·ed, and in its place was substituted a Rogers glass diaphragm. This diaphragm is of nry thin plate-glass, upon which, in the space of thirty-four hundredths of an inch, are ruled se\~en groups, or "tallies/' of three double lines each, the distance between the double !foes heiug about twelve hundredths of a second of time at the equator. The tallies are denoted lly the letters A to G, inclusive, and tbe in<liridual lines by figures 1, 2, and 3. This notation begins at the perforated, or "lamp," end of the transit axis, so that when the field is illuminated by the western lamp, the position of the instrument designated in the record by "lamp west," a star at upper culmination crosses the lines as shown in Fig. 3.

A star is recorded when midway between the double lines, and generally onl.r the tallies B, C, D, E, F are used. The field is illuminated by light which enters the axis at lamp-end, anrl is reflect.ed down the tube by an open metallic ring. Stars of less than the sixth magnitmln cannot be satisfactorily observed. The Coast Sarvey chronograph, "spring-governor No. 2," made hy Messrs. \Villi am Ilond & Sons, of Boston, was placed in the smaller compartment of the observatory, in order that its nois(~ while running might not influence the transit-observer. It is similar to tlrn cbronoirraphs trne.d at Cambridge and St. Pierre, being provided with a single pen, which describes a continuous spiral upon a. sheet of pa.per attached to a revolving drum, and re.cords by offsets the chronometer breaks aud observer's signals.

The circuit-breaking apparatus of this chronometer consists of an extra wheel, attached to the seconds' arbor, the circumference of which is divided into thirty equidistant teeth, with a thirty first tooth inserted between the teeth which mark the fifty-eighth and the zero second. The electric circuit is cJosed by a delicate gold spring secured at one end and resting against an adjustable screw at the other. This spring is so placed that in passing it each tooth of the extra wheel just described strikes a jewel set in its face, lifting it from the screw and recording a break upon the chronograph. Thus the chronographic record of the chronometer before and after the beginning of a minute will read4' ------"

The circuit-breaking apparatus just described is graphically represented in the accompanying sketch (Fig. 4) :
Loc&l circuit.

Resistance coil.

To avoid the inconvenience arising from the deflagration of contact surfaces by the spark developed at the break, a branch circuit including a resistance coil is introduced, according to the writer's device, bridging the break and permitting the ready passage of the secondary current, while the resistance is too great to allow the recording-magnet of the chronograph to be sensibly affected. It will be obser't'ed that the rate of this chronometer was not only determined by the observations made at Brest, but was also checked by daily comparisons with the clocks at Paris and Greenwich. Its performance was very satisfactory. The local battery used in the observatory consisted at first of three elements of Callot's modification of Daniell's sulphate of copper battery; but on July 9 a battery of six Menotti elements was substituted for it. A small and very delicate recording-key-made for the observer-was used at the transit instrument. Only stars from the American Ephemeris were observed at Brest, and it was the aim of the observer to obtain each night a full setoonsisting of five time-stars and two circumpolars--one above and one below the pole-in ea.ch position of the instrument. By this system it is practicable to deduce the azimuthal deviation of the instrument independently for either position, and even to arrh·e at a fair value of the collimation when observations have been obtained in but one position. Whenever the weather permitted, a second set was observed immediately after the exehange of longitude-signals. The mayor of Brest, Mr. A. Penqner, afforded facilities for establishing and protecting the station on the public square; Mr. G. Amyot, chief inspector of telegraphs in the department of Fin~rre, superintended tho construction of the necessary telegraph-lines; Mr. Bureau, manager of the gov-

It was intended that the observations at, aud the exchanges of time-signals between, tl1e ".\ merica.n stations should be as nearly simultaneous with those in Europe as the weather might allow, in order that the int;ermediate statit1ns at Brest and St. Pierre should sensibly disappear from the det;ermina.tion of the longitude of Cambridge from Greenwich and Paris.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

Such simultaneous opemtious proved to be impracticable, in consequence of the condition of the cables. The long cable between Brest and St. Pierre was working badly and had to be repaired before it, was fit for onr use. When this was accomplished, it proved to have a better insulation than ever before, and siguals were transmitted with great sharpness; but, mean time, the cable between St. Pierre and Duxbury had been broken, and could not be repaired during the summer, so our arrangements were necessarily changed. Mr. Dean, who had charge of the American part of the operations, at once proceeded to make arrangements for excha11ging time-signals between St. Pierre and Cambridge, via the short cable, from St. Pierre to Sydney, 209 miles; thence by the land-lines, Sydney to Picton, :ll4 miles; and Pietou to Cam bridge, 666 miles; in all, a through circuit of 1,089 miles, with repeaters at Syduey, St. John, :N". B., aud Boston. This part of the work offers no uuusual features, as clock signals were exchanged arul automatically registered ou the chrouographt> by the methods ordinarily made use of in the long-itude dctermination15 of the Ooast Sun·ey. Time-signals were exchanged on seren nights; bnt the determiuatious of the eloek and instrumental corrections at Cambridge on July 21 and 23 were so eKtremely weak that the longitude results on tho8c dates, although accordant, cannot be allowe~l to intluence the final result. The lotigitmle differences, deduced from live nights when gOlid ol>serva.ions were obtained at each station, were as follows:

ST. PIERRE-BREST. The signals sent through the Brest-St. Pierre cable were observed by means of the "Thomson Galvanometer," the constmction of which is based upon the ingenious device of Sir William Thomson, in applying to a delicate galvanometer tbe principle of reflection used by Gauss for heavy magnets. A similar instrument, used in the 1866 longitude determinations by Dr. B. A. Gould, is described by him as follows in his report on that work, published in the Coast Survey Report of

1867:

.

"A small mirror, to the back of which is attached a permanent magnet, the joint weight of the two being from fiYe to six centigrams, is held by a single fiber above and below, in the center of a coil of fine wire which forms part of the galvanic circuit, and its position and sensitiveness are regulated by movable bar-magnets placed in the immediate vicinity. Upon the mirror is thrown a beam of light through a slit in front of a bright kerosene-lamp, and the deflections of the needle are noted by tbe movements of th~ reflected beam, which is reooived upon a strip of white paper. The exquisite delicacy of this galvanometer, as well as the electrical excellence of the telegrapbcables, may readily be appreciated after tile beautiful experiment in which the electricians at Valencia and Newfoumlland conversed with each other on a circuit not far from 700 myriameters (4,320 statute miles) iu length, formed of the two ca.hies joined at the ends, using a battery composed of a percussion gun-cap, a morsel of zinc, and a drop of e.eidnlated water." Before leaving Washington, the writer had devised a.ud attended t;o the construction of a key, by \Vhich a chronographfo record of signal1:1 sent into the cable oou]d be obtained. This key is similar to the ordinary cable-key devised by Sir William Thomson, with an a.t.tachment by which the

local circuit may be passed through it in such a manner as to be broken at the instant the cablecircui t is closed hy the depres8ion of either spring. It is also susct'ptible of an adj ustmeut hy wltich an exact record can be obtained of the time during which tlte c;Lul1·-circuit is clo-;c>rl. It is evident, therefore, that all time-signals sent into the cable were accurately recoriled upou the chronograph. In receiving time--signals from St. Pierre, the observer at Brest, watching- the "spot," or hearn of light reflected from the galvauometer, pressed his local break-cireuit key at tile in.~taut lte saw it dart to tlte right or left of sca.Ie-center. It is ouvious that the cbrouogrnpllic record in Lliis case must be too late uy a certain intet,-al of time depending upon the obsen-er':s personal error in noting; the signals; but it will be seen that this personal error was accurate!~· measured and entirely eliminated from the longitude Tesult. In an_y case, the result would be affected b,y only half the differenc<~ between the pcn;oual errors at Brest and St. Pierre; and experience has shown that between most observer;; this tli[(~re11cP is very small. On Tuesday, .July 9, a preliminary exchange of time-signals was effected between Brest and St. Pierre. St. Pierre first sent five-second charges-positive aud neg<lti\'e-for two minutes. Brest found that at end of miclt five seconds the llable had so nearly discharged itselt' tlrnt tLe moment of raising key at St. Pierre was not marked by any apparent impnlse to tlrn spot. 8t. l'ipn·e then sent a number of two-second charges, hut the discharge attending tlw raising of his key was not sharpl~· enough defiued to a1lmit of accurate noting, and Brest lm<l uo confidence iu tlw times recorded ou his chronograph. Brest then sent similar signals to St. Pierru, who complained of difficulty in distinguishing begiuuing of discharge. Brest next requested St. Pierre to send a set of signals cousistiug of alternate positi YP and negativ-e taps (ffCI'S fifth second for two minutes. He did so, and a \'er:y sat1sfactor,Y record of tllt· times at wllich spot darted to right or left of scale-center was obtained. Brest then sent a similar set to St. Pierre, who remarked that the signals were sharp and easy to note. Two more similar sets sent either way finished the night's work. At Bi·est, tl1t·s1· preliminary exchanges were carried on in the operating-room of the ca,ble-office, witli the instrnmeuts in daily use by the compan,\· (excepting the cable-ke,\- already described) no special attention lwing given to resistance of galvanometer, throw of spot, or strength of battery. On July 12 the exchanges were made under the same conditions. The success of our cable-work on subsequent nights of exchange was due in 110 ,.;mall degreu to the kind exertions of :M:r. Thomas Awlrews, sup1~ri11temlent at Brest, who lll't'sonally attended to the management of the cable-instrurneuts in our observatory, and by directions to t.ht, superi11tet11:l· ent a.t St. Pierre secnred a similar arr,rngoment for the Coast Sun-ey ob-icn·er at that ,.;tatio11. Both st:itions worked direetly into cable with batteries of ten )Ienotti Ct'lls, aud recein'd through condensers of the same capacity (47 microfarads) and gah·ano1uete1·.-; of tl1e same resistance (3,000 ol11ms) and the same magnetic moment. The galvanometer mirrors \H·re sn,,;pemled by silk fiber iu clock-oil. 011 July 13 commnnication was established between the Brest obserratory aud the observatory at St. Pierre. During the exchange of a few preliminary signals each ollserYer ad,i11st<·d liis g-alnt· nometer-so as to have the spot thrown exact.Iy 150 divisions (about four inches) to right or left of zero of scale, which was about thirty-two inches from galvanometer. Immediately thereafter although it was raining at both stations, signals were exchanged in accordance witli the following programme, which the experimeuts of July 9 and 12 bad proved to be best suited to our wants:
PROGRAMME FOR CABLE-EXCHANGES.

At one a. m., Greenwich time, Brest gives threB warning rattles, followed by positiw. tap a1 beginning of minute; negative at five second;;; positive at ten seconds; antl i;o on uutil twenty-fiYe signals have boon sent. Then, after ten seconds' interval, gives three terminal rattles. St. Pierre records warning and terminal rattles upon his chronograph, and the instants at which spot darts to right or left during intermediate signals. This forms a " set." St. Pierre then sends Brest a set; Brest one to St. Pierre; and so on until tbTee sets hin-e l>een seut and received at each station. Oa.ble-work for the night is then finished.

·Plu-tSONAL ERRORS IN NOTING CABLE TJME-SIGNALS.
Umler this heaJling are hlCluded not only tbe actnal personal errors of the observers in noting the signals, as indicated by the deflections of the cable-galvanometBrs, but also the armature-times of the g;th·auometers themsel Vl·S. The reasons for thus combining these penmnal errors and armature-times are that tbe_y both ba\'e similar effects on tbe results for longitude and wave-time, and that, com hined, they were readily snbject.ed to direct measurement of great nicety; while, to arrh'e at a tletermination of each Be[)arat.-ly, would have involved experiments for making which no suitable inl!truments were at hand. Furthermore, a separate determination would not have added tot.lie accuracy of the work iu any particular. In this connection it should be noted that the term ''armature-time," as applied to a cablegah·anometer, is used for convenience to dt>"lignate the interval of time it takes for the magnet of the galvanometer, with its attached mirror, to be moved through an arc sufficiently la.r~ to cause

a sensible deflection of the reflected spot of liglit. Also, that the term "penmnal error in uotiug cable-signals'' is always to be understood as iuclndi11g this arrnatnn·-time. The arrangements at Drt>st for cll·termining tlw personal error of )Jr. lllake in uotiug tlie tirnesignals received from St. l'ierre were as follows: The governing apparatus of the chronograph was removed so a8 to alio w the drum to revolve at its maximum speed. The galvanometer was taken from the obst·ryatory to testing-room of cable-otl:icc aud connected in a" local-main" circuit with oue ~Ienotti cell ttud the ob.-;cn·atory ca hie-key, and to make the Hignals sent with thi8 key 8imi l;ir to th<He r.>eei \"e. l from .,t, Pi0rre tlnring: cable-work, a sh1rnt of 604.6 units power, and 5,162 units of resistance crib8 were introduced mto the circuit. Sigual8 were then sent from the observatory by a;u as;-;istant, at interntl8 of ti Ye 8eeonds, and recorded upon the chronograph by l\fr.

WAVE-Tll\IE OF CABLE-SIGXALS .
No special observations were made for the ptll'pose of determining- the velocity of transmis;o;ion, or" wave-time," of signals through the cable; but the resnlts therefor incidentally derluce<l from the time signals exchanged for longitade are entitled to great weight, since the arrangem(·ntl" at. each station (page 171) were !';Ucb as to immre, as near!.'· as possihle, the same velocity for signals sent from east to west and 11ice 11ersa. In cable-work, as is well known, the difference bet.ween the longitudes n~sulting from timesignals sent in each direction is equal to the snm of the aetnal \Ya VP-times of the 8ignals t.hfln1seh·es, plus the sum of the armature-times of the galvanometers, plus the snrn of any w~rsonal errors in noting the signals a~ indicated by the deflections of the gaJrnnometers. A consideration of the arrangements for exchanging cable time-signalt>, as described in Section VI, shows that the armature-times of the recording chronographs, wbether equal or unequal, could ha.ve no effoot on their apparent or actual wave-times.

BREST-PARIS AND BREST-GREENWICH. The Brest cllronometcr was compared with the clocks at Paris and Greenwich by means ot' arbitrary signals sent over the line and recorded on the cl1ronograpb at each station. These signals were sent for five minutes at approximate intervals of five seconds, the inter>als being purpoi;ely varied so as to give different fractional readings. At 11 o'clock p. m., Greenwich l.Jegan sending to Brest; then Brest sent to Greenwich ; next Brest to Paris ; and finally Paris to Brest. Between Greenwich and Brest but one series of signals was exchanged on each night, as the free use of the cable could not be granted for more than ten minutes. Between Brest and P~tris, however, a wire was placed at the disposal or the party from 8 o'clock p. m. for the night; and generally two series of exchanges were obtained. Both Greenwich aml Paris worked with the local circuit open, recording" makes"; while Brest worked with a closed local circuit, recording "breaks." To ob\"iate this difficulty, while exchanging time.signals, the local circuit at Brest was passed through the local connections of a l\for8e recorder at1d the insulated end of a ~Iorse key, in such a manner as to be broken at the instant the main circuit between Greenwich and Paris was closed.

Tbree piers were coustrnctrnl in l\lr. 8mith's observatory, permitting the three transit-instrument8 used iu the longitude-work to be mounted in the same meridian at oue time. Th,e personal equations \\'ere then compared by each observer determining the time with his own instrument, in his accustomed manner, using the same stars. Each obsen·er recorded llis observations upon his own chronograpl1, lmt the .tbree ehronograpliis were gra(luated by the 1-1ame clock through a suitably-arranged rela;y. The different systems of lines with which the trarniit-instruments were proYided, as well as the fact that no two of the obser\·ers could work with a common focus, prevented a satisfactory determination of the personal l:'q nations by the ··alternate-tally" method. The resnlts obtained from six nights' work IJy the method just described are as follows:

The figures for Cambridge - Duxbury and Duxbury - Brest are taken from No. XYI, Memoirs of the American Academy, Cambridge, 1873, by Prof.·Toseph I . ()vering, who bad charge of the eomputat,ious. By reference to that publication, it will be seen that rluring the 1870 longitude. work the ends of the two cables were joined at St. Pierre, hy bringing their sen·ral co11cle11sers into contact, and that the cable time-signals were then exchanged directly between Brest and Duxbury. The method of transmission was thus quite different from that employed in 1872, and the close agreement of results can only be held as dissipating all doubt as to the sensible equality of the transmission or wave-time of signals sent in opposite directions. \Ve will finally consider the longitude of Cambridge from Greenwich, as d11termined through the Ireland-Newfoundland cables in 1866, by Dr. B. A. Gould. A full account of his operations is published in the united States Coast Survey He.port for 1867, and also iu Vol. XVI of the Smithsonian Contributions. The results there given lack one link of being complete, and that is the difterence of personal equation between Mosman, the observer at Foilhommerum, and the standard observer at Greenwich. This defect we have ende:cwored to supply, as far as is practicable after the lapse of some .Years, through the pen-onal-eqnation differences between Messrs. Mosman, Blake, aud the Greenwich observers, in the following manner: The well-ascertained equation between Blake and Mosman is that Blake places himself o·.09 west of Mosman. Blake, moreover, places himself o·.06 east of the present Greenwich standard obser\'er (Cris wick), who, in turn, places himself o·.11 west of the standard observer of 1867 (Dunkin). Hence we deduce that l'\fosman placed himself o·.04 east of Dunkin, and the former difference of longitude between Greenwicll and Foilhommerum must be increased by that amount. The figures given in the publications above referred to require some other corrections in consequence of the personal-equation corrections having been applied with the wrong sign. \Ve therefore recite the s~veral links of the combination, as follows:

It is proper to state here that during the progress of the work which has been detailed in the preceding pages, exchanges of signals were also made between the United States NaYal Observatory at Washington, and the observatories at Cambridge and St. Pierre. The results of these observations are gh·en elsewhere and are combined with the elaborate determination of longitude between \Vashiugton and Cambridge, made by a joint operati::m of the Coast Survey, the Harvard College Observatory, and the United States Naval Obsen·atory iu 1867. The result of the latter was:

PART II. REDUCTION OF THE OBSERVATIONS MA.DE FOR THE TRA.NSA.TLANTIU, LONGITUDE DETERMINATIONS OF 1872. The computations of all observations at Cambridge and St. Pierre were made,· under the direction of Prof. Joseph Lovering, by Mr .. Lucius Brown. The instrumental constants were all determined on the supposition of a possible change in the azimuth at every reversal. For a full elucidation of the formnlre used, reference may be made to a paper on the "Determination;of Time by Meane of the Tr~nsit-Instrument," prepared for the Coast Survey Manual, by Assistant C. A. Schott, and published as Appendix No. 9 to the Coast Survey Report of 1866. Also, to addendum to this paper, by the same author, published as Appendix No. 10 to the Ooast Survey Report of 1868. The observations of Mr. Blake at Brest, Paris, and Greenwich were computed in the following manner: The chronograph-sheets having been independently read by two persons, and the readings collated, each evening's work was reduced by Mr. Blake on the plan of deriving the collimation and t:pe azimuthal deviation of the transit-instrument from all the observed stars by means of the usual normal equations, giving equal weight to all the stars. The clock-correction was then finally determined from stars of less than 60° declination by applying the instrumental corrections previously obtained. ' In a more elaborate second computation, made by Prof. R. Keith, each conditional equation was affected by a weight depending upon the star's declinat.ion, according to a law derived from , the observations themselves, which is expressed by the empirical formula.E2 = vl.::ll sec~ sec {J- ~)

The mean observed difference of longitude 0·.221 ± o·.016 diminished by O·.lGO-the actual distance in longitude between the two transit-instruments-gives the finally-adopted personal-equation difference: Blake east of Greenwich standard observer, 0".061 ± o·.orn. It is obvious that an observed difference of longitude between these two obserrers must be diminished or inm·eased according as Blake OOCU})ies the eastern or western station.

THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY. PEUSONAL EQUATION.
GOODFELLOW, DLAKE AND SMITH.

237

After the return of the European party, Messrs. Goodfellow, Blake, and Smith assembled at Cambridge to obser,·e for personal equation. The three instruments used in the longitude-work were set up in the same meridian. Each obserrnr used the instrument he had bad in the field, and determined indepeudently, from the same stars, tlrn error of the south cloek of tile llarvard Otisen·atory, a relay, breaking three circuits, enabling them to note the time entirely independent of each other. The following are the observations from which the personal equation is derived. Transit Xo. U was used by l\fr. Goodfollow, No. 5 by .Mr. Smith, and No. 4 by ~Ir. Blake. The clock correction is deduced from stars whose declinations are lm;s than 65°.
