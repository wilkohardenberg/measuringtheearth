Inspection of topography.-The plane-table parties working in th is section west of the Penobscot were reviewed in their places in the course of the present season by Assistant, H. L. Whiting. Jn each locality Mr. \Vhiting observed the natural features, critici&ed their representation on the planetable slwet::;, diRcnsse<l the expedients for attaining· rapidity in execution and preciRion in contour, and in W'TH'rH] advised with referPllCe to the mean;:; for .securing uniformity in the chariwter of the plarw-tahle th·tails. The result expected from this Rpeeial co-operation of Assistant Whiting is the return of slieets with details determined by the moRt jmliciouR seh~ction, when, by reason of rNlnudancy, some of the details must be of necessit,y gene,ralized. That this OQject has been to a p;reat extent already attaitwd is due to the paAt exertions of this accomplished topogTapher.

Astrorw111fral obserrations at I'rincipfo station, Maryland.-The reciprocity treaty between the United States aud Great Britain having expired on the 17th of .March; 1800, in accordance with notice to that effect given by our government, the comwission authorized under the first and second articles of that treaty closed its labors on the 1st of . _ l , and Assistant Richard D. Cutts, who bad been tletailed as United States 1<urveyor under the treaty, and who had served in that capacity since 1855, and also as colonel and aide-de-camp in the army from November, 1861, until the close of the rebellion, returned to active duty in the Coast Survey. In July, August and E;ei~ the geodetic station P1·inci1lio, near the head of Chesapeake hay, in :Maryland, was o~ by Assistant Cutts. 1fi., observations there are in continuation of the series of astronomical determinations Jaade betweeu the Fire island base and the base on Kent island, with reference to their probable application in the measurement of an arc of the meridian. The local time at Principio was determineu with transit No. 11from127 series of observatious on 36 high and low stars. Sidereal chronometer No. 1276, used in the observations, was kindly lent for the purpose by Rear--.Adlli.iral Davis, superintendent of the Naval Ollservator~-. Latitude.-For,tbe determination of the latitude of tl1e st.atfon 243 obRervations were made on 40 pairs of dus1c1 zei1ith Rtarn with zenith telescope No. 5. The arc valtte of the micrometer was tested by ohserva.tfons on Polaris at itH eastern elongation. Azimutll.-Tq,e astwnomical meridian and bearing of the primary triangulation line from Principio to Turkt>y-,Point wM'e determined by 201 obse1Tations on Polaris at and near its eastern elonga· tion, in com hination with 228 measurements between the star and azimuth mark, and 20 series of 6 obsen-ations each between the mark and the station at Turkey Point. The instrument employed was the 24-inch Troughton theodolite. At Ca1>e Henry light-house, Virginia, observations of a sin1ilar character were commenced by Assistant George Davidson in August. :For the astronomical obsen·ations an eccentric station was occupied anu another determined for the azimuth and magnetic uliservations, ou the line Cape Henr~' light-house-Cape Charles light-house. Mr. Da,·idson made the latitude ob1<ervations with zenith telesc'41JeNo.1, obtaining187 determina· tions of the latitude by 40 pairs of stars upon an ~rage of five nights. ,Some of the stars were observed three times each nig'11t: at 30 seconds before meridian passage; at culmination; and at 30 seconds after. In connection with these, observatious for time were made with the 26-inch transit No. 11. All the records were duplicated and part of the star places were reduced with the annual precession in north polar distance recalculated \\ith Peters's Elements. For value of the micrometer,observatiom; were made upon ..l. Urs.re l\linoris at elongation. To these Assistant Davidson had added the preliminary calculations for azimuth, of a and ..l. Ursre :Minoris at elongation, when it became necessary for him to proceed t-0 Section I to take charge of the Calais end the telegr-.iph line intended to be used for determining longitude. Thi)t~. in service with l\lr. DavidRon at Cape Henry were :Messrs. W. I. Vinal and M. F.

The detail of the rlut;r deRired waR arranged by Lieutenant Commander R. L. Phythian, who had charge of the department of astronomy and navigation at the Na val Academy. After a division of the class int-0 sections of sixteen to eighteen students: :!\lr. "\\'lliting took the sections into the field on successive days, and demom;trated the prin('iples arnl methods of work by making an actual survey of part of the harbor of Annapolis aud of the grounds of the Academy. Thel'<e exerciRt>s were closPd b;\T t11e annual examination of the cadets, whid1 took place at the dosP of 1\fay. l\Iuch interest having been maniteRted, Admiral Porter renewed hi8 requcRt in October. A class, rnm1bering in the aggregate ninety, was htken into practice by 1\Ir. Whiting; each d:1y, for a period of several weeks, being devoted to a party of about twelye cadets. Of his experit>uce as an instructor in the fiel1l dnring the month of November, Assistant 'Vhiting·; remarks; "The interest and attention of the clas8, and the alacrity with which each ca<let took part in and executed all tlw co-operating details which I assigned to them, were proofs of the merit aud a1lYantag-e of this llOpular method of instruction.'' ln (·.onnectioo ·with the plane-table exercise, a scheme elaborated at the outset in <~ons1utation witl1 Ca1>tain J>h;\-thian, fol' making hydrographic surveys, was executed hy the cadets umler bis direl'ti on. Ju additiou to tbe field-work with the dar;s, and as an example for their future practice, Mr. V\'hiting made an extended surYey of interior details, employing as aids a crew of sailors. This survey was desired by Admiral I'orter to eover certain gronnds north of th(\ city of Annapolis, withiu limits considered fayoralJie for extending the gronndfl of the Na.val Academy. The sheet was 11rn·fo ela hornte ju cldails, and when 1mmpleted was left for the use of the admiral.

Thirty casts were made in positions well determine(} along the proposed track of the telegraph cable; and a variety of iuciclental observations upon temperature, density, velocity of current, &c., was recorded. Some of the develo}lments of this survey are interesting. It appears that the north bank of this part of the stmitR of Florida falls away in terraces to the depth of 85;~ fathoms; and that between this maximum depression and another of 7 48 fathoms near the Cuban coast, there rises a 111011ntui11 within 400 fathoms of the surface, over which flows the Gulf stream with a velocity of ~t mile!' per hour. Full dt·tails of the work wil1 be found in Mr. Mitchell's report, (Appendix No. 5.) A11tr01wmical and mag11etie ol11wn·ation8 at Punta RaHa, Florida.-The geographical position of a station at Punta nasa, the southern entrance to Charlotte bai·bor, l·'lorida, (Sketch No. 18,) was determined in ,June and .July h~, Suh..

During the autumn he examiuc<l the stations near l'ensacola tllat hatl been relied on for continuing the work, but fonud that most of the ma1'ks had been destroyed. Fortunately, however, the cit~~ authorities, at his instance, retai11ed in place a screw-pile which had been sunk in the public square in Pensacola, and tlnrn preserved a station mark of considerable importance. It is to be much regretted that at Barkley's Point no trace whatever remained of the scre,v-pile and granite post set as marks of the astronomical station in 1856. Two of the Rullsidiary marks that had been merely displaced were reset by .Mr. Oltmanns so as to identify the locality. Under the circmnstances just noted, the stations at Fort Pickens and Fort l\lcCree, not having undergone any change, were deemed the most eligible as startiug points iu the triangulation intended to be pushed over Pel'(lido bay. Assistant Oltmam1s ac(:onliugly sekcit'd and occupied niue stations, from which he observed "ith the theodolite on thirteen signals, aud by means of the points-thus determined traced in the shore-line of the lagoon extended W·'.stwm:d from the entrance to Pensacola bay, and part of the adjacent Gulf coasts, making in the aggregate thirtynine :niiles.

REPORT 01:' SUPERINTENDENT 01'' UNITED STATES COAST RURVEY.

CONCLUSION.

Tlit- duty of issuing directions for the prosecution of the survey in all its branches, and the

responsibility of acting in behalf of the Superintendent was devolved upon me in the autumn of 1864, when he found his health too much impaired to permit him to continue the active direction of the field-wmk. It is a pleasure to record that in this arduous service, superadded as it was to the charge of office details, I have had the hearty co-operation of the officers who during previous years acted under the immediate orders of the Superintendent. My a~knowledgments are especially due to the hydrographic inspector, Captain C. P. Patterson, who iu addition to his dnties in the office has had charge of the direction of the hyd.rography, and has constantly aided me with his advice in matters of ad]ninistration. In the disbursing agent, Samuel Hein, esq., I have ever found the ready and intelligent exponent of the fiscal arrnugements best adapted to the interests of the survey, with reference both to economy and efficiency in the operations of -the field parties. I am likewise indebted to W. W. Cooper, esq., for valuable aid in the conduct of the work, in connection with his duties as chief clerk to the Superintentlent, which have made him familiar with the details of administration. Respectfully submitted by J. E. HILGARD, As:<1istant in Oltar,qe for the Superintendent. Hon. HUGH McCuJ,LOCH,

Secretary of tlie Treasury.

In the conclucling portion of the report I shall eomnwnt upon tlw material,, eom, posing the outfit, and dil'lcnss hriefly the 11writF; of m~· linel'I, whi<'h were manufa<'tnred Yery carp, fully and laid up in a different manner from those to lw found ready in thP nrnrkt·t. When tJiis work was fil'st "uggestt.'d to mf'. it wa:o; propo8f'tl that 01w of the nanil Yes;o;els from the Gulf squadron should he temporarily detailed for my use witl1 the offic<·rs and crl'w. To tltiH arrangement the Secretary of the Navy was consenting, but after mature inquiry and eonsi<leration it appeared that no vessel of suitable cliaractPr was a\'ailahlf' from this Hquadron. The plan was accordingly changed, and Acting .Master Robert Platt, commam1i11g Hie Coast Sun,ey steamer Corwin, was instrnct~ll to take me from SaYannah to the scene of operations and lend every effort which his Yessel and party could afford. I take pains to say in adyance of my report upon the result that the officers and tlie Coast Surn'\y a8sistantR of his party C\arriNl ont tlw Jett.er and R})irit of their instructions, and not only brought to the aid of tlw work much praetical knowledge which I did not myself possess, but also that earnest personal intere8t which i8 not al-ways serured in official relations. On the 7th of April I left Boston with my freigl1t by packet, and on arriYing at Savannah on the evening of the 12th, found the Corwin waiting at her anchor and in readiness for 8ea. Two days sufficed for transferring the freight and completing necess!-lry purchases, and we drop1)ed down the river to Pulaski roads on the night of the 14th with the intention of going out at daybreak on the following morning. Stormy weat.11er followed, so Wt' did not actually cross the bar till the morning of the 17th, and it is scarcely an exaggeration to say that from this time till our return, nearly a month, we had scarcely a "cap.full of wind." The Corwin makes but little st('am, and with the current often against us, our journey down the coast was slow. I did not regret this, however, because it afforded me orrportuuilic8 for study. ing carefully the surface densities and tRmperatures of U1e sea. I made very frequent trials with the hydromete1· in the vain ex}X',ctation of finding some of those "fresh-water spots" wlJieh have been frequent1y reported by vessels cruising along the coast of Florida. inside tlw Rtream. A8 we crossed and recrossed the edge of the stream, before reaching the latitude of Cape Florida, l was able to acquire a knowledge of those c-0ntrasts of temperature which have heen made Ho iutt"resting and useful to navigators by your elaborate investigations in former years. As these ob8erYations were not mentioned among the objects of the expedition, I shall not re1)ort. upon tlwm at this time. I presume they would develop nothing new, hut they will prove useti.tl to me in the better compre, hension of the former Gulf Stream explorations which you have placed in my hands for com1)ilation. On the 21st we came to anchor in the harbor of Key West, and after cleaning boilers and coaling we commenced to make soundings on the morning of the 25th, a.nd work eel to the soutlrward. Since it would involve many usel~ss repetitions to de.scribe our operations in the or<ler of' dates, I shall refer you at once to the table (annexed) of thirty stations at which succesRfnl casts were made, and to two recapitulation tables in which the results are summed up-first, according to number of station, an<l again by distance along a section line. The positions of the stations were determined hy dead reckoning, checketl by ohsenations for latitude and longitude, and bjr horizontal angles when the coast was visible. Being satisfied that these poBitionR a.~ very close, I have required Mr. Charles Junken, who

discusst·d the slti1)'s reckoning, and l\lr. G-. Bradford, who observed an<l computed the altitmles, to compile their notes, over their own signatures, that I might hand them in, as I do, with this report. Tn the process of sounding the line witl1 "detaching leau" and "indicator" was 1mfferlc'd to run freely out over a sheave secured to one of the awning stanchions at the stern of the ship. In most cases the lead was securt>d and the various signals given personally by Captain Platt, while I, with a chronometer by my side, l'ecorded the out-run of every fifty-fathom tag and madf:l notes upon the trnnd of the line, its direction, and the lay of the ship. vVhen bottom was felt, or when the lead was su11posed to have reached it, the line, in tbe a,bsence of a proper steam reel, was hauled in by a single purchase winch and by hand. In some cases the time Qf hauling in each fifty fathoms was recorded, with a statement of the number of men employed, the trend of the line, &c. On Diagram I tbe curves of the out-run and in-come of the line, in feet, per second are plotted. These have proved nl'efu1 in the discussion of tlie results. The track of our soundings was designed to be, as near as practicable a straight line from Sand Key light to El l\foro light; and altl1011gl1 our work was not continaous, am] spaces wenci filled fo our different dates, an inspection of our diagTam of positionR II, shows that we did not wander often from the l"igbt path;yay. A very good section line is made possible by the positions of our stations, and upon Diagram III the profile is given. Our deepest sounding was 853 fathoms, at a station about three miles to the westward of our section line and about 24 miles from the l\foro. The interpolations among the stations on either side of our lirw gives the greatest depression for the profile; 845 fathoms, 37 miles from the Moro. It should be l'emarked here that the casts in this portion of the straits show that the line of gTeatest depression has a northeastel'ly course, perhaps very well marked by stations 28, 14, and lU, Diagram II, at which we have &i3, 845, and 794 fathoms. This course is parallel to neither coast and makes an acute angle (about 200) with our section line, so that our profile is not, strictly speaking, that of a crQss-section uf the clmnuel way. This course of the main charm el does not correspond with that of the surface current, but it would seem to be a natural one fol' the under-running polar current, so called. The approaches to the Great Valley from tlie two coasts are dissimilar in their general features. From the northward the bottom falls away in terraces whQse intervening slopes are nowhere abrupt; while from the southward an irregular and l1i11y appl'Oach is developed by our survey, with indications of abn1pt, if not precipitous changes of elevation. Above the terraces of the north shore the sea lies almost motionleRs, while among the banks and canons of the southern half of the straits fl.ow the Gulf Stream and its counter-currents. I think I am authorized by these natural distinctions to take up separately the descriptions of these approaches to the deep-channel way. Northern approaeh.-Leaving Sand island the water deepens to eight fathoms, then shoals again to seven fatboms U})On a naITQ\V coaRt; bar, which lies parallel to the reef, and distant from it threefourths of a mile. Seen from the, dook of a ship, upon a pleasant day, this bar is marked by a strip of pale-blue green water, in beautiful contrast to the rich blue-black of the ocean outsi(le. The bottom can be seen on crossing it and appears to be of a pure white rock, in situ, strewn over with loose fragments of the weathered and brown reef rocks. Two and three-fourths miles from the "light" caqies u!'l to sixty fathoms, (A, Diagram III,) in which neighhorhood tlle bottom is gene:rally hard, hut covered here and there with loose debris of shells and corals. From the 7-fathom reef to the 60-fathom curve, the fall is 1 foot in 37. Beyond this the fall is about 1 foot in 103 to the point B, (7 t miles from Saud Key light,) which is a little beyond the 100-fathom curve. Here we reach a plain or terrace which I have deemed worthy of particular notioo. In this neighborhood). over a district of eight miles in longitude by one mile in latitude, we made five casts, feeling the hard rock bottom with the lumd Hach time. The reRpectiye depths were 117, lOu, 117, 110, and 111 futhoms. In one of' these casts a fow chips of the white coral rock came up in the Berryman specimen cup. In all of them the lead detached. Further on at C (11 miles from Sand Key light) we still find but 129 fathoms, showing a decline of but 1 foot in 195 for 2! miles ; and here one of the specimen cups was broken, as the lt>ad suddenly detached upon the hard rook. We seemed to have reached the brow of the terrace for the next st miles to D, (14 miles from Sand Key light) the decline is 1 foot in 22, and the depth reached 289 fathoms, where the hard rook was still felt

by the hand, as the lead detached. We have two soundings from which il!e df'ptl1 at D is computed, which lie on either side of section line, a bout in the Rame parailc·l, hut differing OYer fonr miles in longitude. These two cast.-: gave-, respectively, 287~ and 290 fathoms, and from this agr<'Cmcnt I argue tha,t the coral ternwe ahove referred to lies east and wm;t, or near!;-.· 1iarallel t0 the adjacent reef, to which formation it certainly belongs. I think we can safe1~· conclude from t1w mau;-,· easts we have made and from the ;yielding natu1·e of the rock, that the coral terra~e cloes not terminate in a precipice. · From D to the next point E, 3i miles, the decline is more gradual, 1 foot in 48. At E tlle rock is no longer felt, but a i'lpecimen of bottom is proenred from 36!} fathoms-a gray muc1 differing in consistency and color from siwcimens obtained from tlte coi·al ternwe, and also from those hereafter to he described as diaracteristic of the bottom he,roml; another 11en11iarity of the specimen is this, instead of setting like the white coral muds, it has a somewhat granulatt>d character on becoming dry. l conceive thi1t the coral terrace ma;r once han· been a dry reef, coYered over like Sand Ke;y with dark fragments of ~1gglomerated reef rock, and that a subi-mquent suhmergem~e has caused aU this loose, sand-weathered material to be swept down to the foot of the fore slope. Between D and E, in ahout 300 fathom!"', lies the foot of the swf"pt portion of the fiorida reet; if not ah;o the base of the formation. l·'rom E to F, six miles, the slove is still gradual, only 1 foot in 97, while the specimen obtained at F, in 422 fathoms, is a white coral, which sets in drying. From .F to C, 11earl:i· fixe miles, tlie decline increases, becomiug 1 foot in 69, with the same kind of bottom, except that at U a f(·w dashes of reel appear in thfl mud brougl1t up from 504 fathoms. This point C (about 29 miles from Sand Key light) brings us to the 500-fathom curve. \Ve ha YA two casts from which this part of onr profile is drinvn; station 6, about a mile from the westward of our line, gave 500, and station 12, a mile fa.rther off to the west-northwest., gave 508 fathoms. Between the 400 aud 500 contours there seem to be indications of another gTaiHl terraep, which might lead us t-0 suspect that the solid coral rock still uuderli.,i8 t,he mud found by our lead. Do these features belong to tlm history of the Gulf Stream or to the geology of the ~~oral reef Y As these slopes and tcnaces are now scarcely within the limits of the stream, I am inclined t > regard them as exhibiting the order through which in successive ages the reef alternately subsiclc<l and stood still. As far as the swept portfou of the reef apron extends I se.e no evide11ce of any undermining and carrying down of the reef; but, on the contrar,Y, I recoguiw a connected thrmation without trace of Yiolence. I hope the examination of specimens of bottom by Mr. Ponrtales may throw some light upon these speculations. Beyond the 500-fatlwm curYe another rapid decline appears ; in a <listance of 4i miles from c to H, it is 1 foot in 47, the material of the bottom remaining the same, iu 687 fathoms. The next space H to I (four miles) carries us nearly to the 800-fathom curve, along a slope oi: 1 foot in 38. The depth given in tlte profile at I is 794 fatl10ms, from a cast at, Station 10, which iH at smm; distance from our section line at the eastward. The specimen ohtained at this station is similar to that found at E, and is a1so from near the foot of a grand slope. From I to the lowest point on our profile, 7~ miles, the decline is but 1 foot in 150-a slope which the eye would scarcely perceive were the bottom laid bare. The ample specimens obtain&l in this maximum depression from 845 to 853 fathomx are white, with a delicate red or rose-colored tint--not unlike the freshly cut stone from the quanies near Havana. The soundings which I have described along the northern approach to the main channel way were made with great care, and since in all of t11em the best evidences of bottmn were obtained, no doubt rests upon the results. The bottom was felt by the hand as far out, as 500 fathoms, beyond tbis the out-run of line is no criterion of the depth, since our simple purpose was to make sure of reaching the bottom by the most ample supply of line, 1miil out freely. In the i;mutheru approach wbicl1 I am about to describe, the result was not so completely satisfactory. In the axis of the sti·eam we were obliged t<> use a heavy. lead of faulty construction which di{\ not al ways detooh, even when a spN~imen found in the cup bore evidence to its reaehing the bott-Om; and in one or two cases, where the lead came home without a specimen, a serious doubt hangs on the results; .althougll \Ye wne unspariug

I shall refer to the!'e matterl'l, however, in detail presently. 8ouiheni approadi.-The moutl1 of Havana harbor l1as rather a low ragged shore upon its Flouthern point, while upou its nmthern, the rocky cliff of the Moro riReR abruptly from tlrn water to heights of GO to 80 foet. Tht> northwestern extremity of the :Moro rock, as seen from the opposite point, is perpendicular at the water-line, but retreats at points higher up, so as to present t(J the obsen·e1· a convex profile wlwse mean dip from the castle wall to the s<"a is nearly 450. Ou 11ear approadt the rock is founcl to he Tagged, hut, I obl'mrved 110 talus at its foot. As might he expected, the wan·s, acquiring very little motion of translation in the deep approach to this rock, rise and fall upon it with little noise and violence in ordinary weather. I cannot conceive that the unrlcrtow or reflex of the sea ever disturbs the bottom at a diRtance of 100 yards, so that no apprehensions ma;\- be entertaine<l by the telegraph compauy in regard to the safety of their cable once laid along the entrance to the harbor, if it follows the deep water. Leaving- the J\Ioro anrl ad vanci11g to the northward (see profile. Diagram III) the bott-0m declines 1 foot in 7, in our first space of l!j mile to the point marked a. The hottom is rock in 24.3 fatl1oms; it was felt by the hand, and the specimen eup brought up only a dead shel1. No eddies were observed, but, a bodily movement of tlw water to the northeastward was apparent. In the next space from a to b (2 miles) the depth increases at the rate of 1 foot in 6, and the foot of the Moro is passed. .At b the Benyman specimen cup came up full, althougl1 the lead, failing to tlet:wh, di1l not close the cover. The material iR reddish brown mud, which becomes in part granulated in drying; in many respects it resembles the specimen found at the foot of the slope from the coral terrace on the north si1le of the stream; it has, however, the red hue which is not characteristic of the Florida side. It is, no doubt, weathered debril'l of the :Moro rock. There can be no question that the dip of the rocky part of this space, between a and b, is muC'h gt·eater tlian the average we have given; because, 1 foot in 6 is unnntural for the material which was found at b. I had hoped to make many casts on this rock, and rlevelop its profile. minutely. We could not do this, however, without determining the positions of objects, and putting theodolite olHwrvcTR on Rhore, and our consul did not see~ able to assist us in getting the necessary permitl'l without correspondence with Washington, for which we could not wait. It is hardly likely that a soft and yielding rock like the Moro can terminate in a precipice, alt hough at thf'Sf' grPa t dPpths there is no agitation, and the st,ream is perhaps constant in direction and velocity. Beyond 7J the slope is gradual, 1 foot in 32, and terminates at c in the nearly horizontal bed of a deprpssion, ·which I sl1all call the Moro channel. Here at c, 9 miles from the "Light," we fonml 784 fathom!\. Our lead did not detach, but one of the hooks was knocked o:ff, showing that bottom liarl been readied; there was mud also in the specimen cup. Six milt's further on at d the depth obtained was 710 fatlwms, with 'the same belmvior of the lead, and eYidetwe of dragging on bottom. In this case the specimen cup was empty, but as we ha(l a heavy lead, and over a thousand fa.thorns of line out, which seemed to nm down perpendicularly, no douht of bottom is admissible, e~ecially as the hook was again knocked off. We have pa ss(·d across the Moro channel and the water is shoaling. Further on at e and f we :find ourselves near the summit of a hill or bank, which presents a markNl f(·ature in our profile, aml~ lying so near the axis of the fl-ulf Stream, may be claimed as a point in the survey of peculiar interest. This elevation is Rearcely 21 miles from the shore of Cuba, whose hills are in view if the weather is fair. We made six ('asts upon it near onr line, three of which were complete failures: first, the line was found snarled about the indicator, which read but 20 fathoms; St>.cond, the line was cut, (p1ubahly by a shark,) when all hut 10 fathoms had been hauled in; third, we tried a drop-line with a, linen cord, and its rate of descent proved too slow to yield a sign. Of the three easts which did give results, only one yielded a svecimen, and detached lead. TheRt> th1-e(~ caRts gave tltf\ following depths by indicator: ate 380 fathoms; at .f 461and448. The last named yielded a specimen of fine mud, having a light reddish brown hue, stiff when first proc-nrerl anrl hanlening or 8etting on hecoming dry.

'YP ll't tlw shi11 lie at re Rt for first 700 fatlmm,.;, and paid out the line freely to 1 1677 fatlwrns. Of course, iu the current we had 110 hope of perceiving bottom by the line, ''Vhen 600 fathoms were out,, the line seemed to run away rapid!~-, but not hy rpason of the descent of the lead, for I find in my statement the record that "the line trails out al'ltern 1.JO f{,et," the outrun was evfrlently from the drift of t11e vessel away from th1· gronntled lead. I am particn!Hr to meutfon theRe details, hecause the existence of a hill, ··ompo8('d of the material we ol1tained, in close proximity to the axis of the stream, might well be doubted, if auy evidence of irnmfticieney or carelessness of observation appeared. :My own reeord showR how RURpieious 1 waR of the results, and how I endeavored to explain away the hill, even when no groull(l for doubtiug a e:1Rt app<>ared. Ou looking over the works of former years, I fin<l that Captain B. F. Sands, iu 185~, made some deep-sea soundings between Havana and Tortugas~ and that he struck a. sourn1iug of on1:--· 3'..!0 fathoms in the same latitude with our ridge, Lut some 12 miles further to the westward hp had found 802 fat horns in the l\loro channel. His shallow soundings I can hut regard as the first dis<~overy of this bank, upon which we expended so much lahOI'. Captain S:muH, likP m:"l·self, obtained a specimen of bottom, and in addition made oh,.;erYations upon the tPmperature of the bottom. It had occurred t-0 me, while suspicions of my results, that tlw fault might L<" with the indicator; that a counter drift, tlte polar curreut, perha11s, rnigl1t haYe eaugl1t the lt·ad below a cm·tain point, and causPd the 1>remature closing of the lid, whi<-h stO})R the fans. But Ca11tain Sands's observations of temperature removes the least doubt; he founcl 60° the tcmperatm·e lwlongiug· to tha,t depth in many parts of the str<'mn before. explored, and the R:tnie as that found by myself in station No. 3-in 287 fathoms, the "polar current" i8 knowu to he below 400. It might perhaps have be,en supposed that an obsta.cle of ihi,.; kind 'fOUlll lurn~ eaul'lPd tlw sub-cuuent to :iscend and flow oyer, hut wl1fln wfl consider that this hill has uot the nattff(' of <1' bar, and that the deepest chamiel-way is ample, there appears to be 110 re11so11 for tlH' aset·nt1iou of the cold sub-current. The lowest temperature found by myst>lf wat1 ±Jo in 8±5 fathoms, north ·of the bank. It appears to be trian~l\llar in its general figure, pre,:entil1g at its west angte a bol<l prow to the stream. This form of bank has been familiar to me, in m~- stndie,.; of diauuel8, traw:>nied hy strm1g currents; but it is not that of a deposit in a current alrPmly rapi<l and Rti11 acf1niring velocity. The slope on the northwest side is 1 foot in 1±1 and on the io;outhwest 1 foot in 17. These are too great for a deposit,, too great also for the material fomul in om· s1wcimcn cup. Thi8 hank must have, like the adjacent coast, a firm constitution. It is an interesting que,.;tion wlietlwr this hank belongs to the mountain s;p1tem of Cuba, as its line of least water running east and soutlie11st nrny indicate, or whetl1er it is an aucient reef now wearing and crumbling away in the stream. Its depth on the summit is about that of the swept portion of the reef apnm to the noTth sidt· of the straits. The depth may also be that of the Gulf Streait, and if so, this bank, being only abraded near its base by the counter stream, should have precipitous slopes. In order to haul in our line from casts near the axis of the stream, we found it necessary to steam up against the current to overtake our lead, from which the ship had driftetl away with the surplus line. I took partieular pains to note the stage at which the steaming b~ame unnecessary ; that is to say, tl1e time when the line came up perpendicularly. At station 9, (74S fathoms,) whid1 lies on the Moro channel, I made the following notes while the line was being hauled in: "On checking the out-run the vessel rode t-0 eastward of f,he line, showing that the lead was on bottomu·o. In pulling in the line, it trailed very much fo the westward, wind E. NE. '1. n would seem that the current down below is quite diflerent from the surface·H·. \~rith 600 fatl1omR out, the line still tends strong to we.stward~i. e., we drift to eastward against the wiud"H. "Tith 300 fathoms out, the line ceases to tend westward-hangs out astern. This is the depth of the stream; its velocity is that of the surface, minus the westwardly drift of the ship." There is a want of logic iu

this last note, hut I give it as made, since the facts show that the depth of the stream is not much over 30 fatl1orm; at any rate. At station 20, (728fathoms,) I find similar notes; the line hauled perpendicularly when only 300 fathoms remained, but the :'ltation lies due east of our bank, under its lea, if we may so speak, so that the local depth of the stream might properly be that of the water or dam a hove. It would seem that the Gulf Stream is an oi:erjl<ndng of wakr-not a profound scawar<.l "Brnvement under a contrast of pressures. I am reminded here of some obserYations made upon similar phenomena iu New York harbor, where, although the causes were different, the mode of operation was the same. In making a physical 1mrvey for the advisory council of the harbor commissioners, I discovered that at tlte mouth of tl1e Hudson a constant inflowing stream prevailed along the he<l of the c:hannel-way, while upon the surface the seaward flow1lredominated. Onfurther study I found that tlie sub-murent was salt, while the surface drift was nearly fi~esh. On running a line of levels np the riYe1·, I m;certained that tl1e head of fresl1 water had so declined during the season that the heaYier sea-water was pouring in to restore the balancf', and yet the elevation of the river was still sufficjent to give to the surface if'atcr a sea ward flow. It was a change of regbncn in progress-the 1·iver was being conYe1ted into an arm of the sea. I oiler tliis simply as an illustration. We matle no ouservations with the express design of measuring the surface velocities of the Gulf Stream, out some incidental information relative to them was gained in the checking of our reckoniug as well as in the process of sounding. Mr. J uuken's estimates made in plotting our position are probably very close, especially near the Cubau coast, where he bad horizontal angles; and my own estimate from the outrun of the line, ·with the lead at the bottom, confirms them pretty well. The strongest current was found in the Moro channel. Mr. Junken makes it 25 miles, aml I make it 27 miles, witl1 a surface temperature of 77~0. On theJuroco bank itself Mr..Tunkeu makes it 2~, au<l I make it 2!, witb a surface temperature of 78if0 · Beyond the bank, in the main channel, 1\Ir. Junken and myself agree upon 2!, with a surface temperature of 79. As we advance to the northward a very rapid decline of velocities takes place. At station No. 10, (794 fathoms on the north of the main channel-way,) I made the follo"ing note: ""'hen the lead reached bottom, the vessel did not indine t,~) ride over to the eastward, iudiuatiug no sttearn." I fiud, however, tliere was a light breeze from the eastward, which, I presume, balanced the feeble t'hift. I find in another note of the same cast, that the trend of the line as it came up indicated the di:fterence of velocity for difterent deptlts. In 500 fathoms the drift was quite feeble, so that bottom was felt by us, and I find in 111,Y record the following note: "No evidence of strong current; where the lead strikes bottom the lines stop i11 great measure." "\Ve kept a careful lookout of the westwardly drift, which ha.s been said to prevail near the north shore of the straits. On every occasion except one, we detected only a feeble eastwardly <frift, which prevailed in spite of the opposing wind. One very calm day we watched our wake as we steamed south from Sand Ke:1' ligl1t, and believed we discovered a westwa:rdly drift, but on sto1)ping tt) sound, 14:} miles from the reef, the ship fell to the eastwai·d, after the lead reached the bottom. If, as we snpposed, we met some westwardly drift, I have no doubt it was under the influence of a tidal current. The very quiet period of our survey certainly afforded an opportunity for seeing the Gulf Stream pursuing its natural course. Our rei>eated soundings near the axis of the stream made us practically ae,qnainted with the notorious fact that the current has nowhere a constant velocity. On the first day of our CUBts upon the .Juroco bank, when we were so pe.rplexed by the 1:1tream, a fleet of vessels (as we learned afterwa1·d) was prevented from making Havana in the usual time, under similar circumstances of wind and weather. A Cuban pilot informed us that "the stream had been much complained of" for several days by in-bound ship-masters. I questioned the pilot closely as to the periods of these changes in the stream, and endeavored to connect them with the ebb and fiow of tides, and with the half-monthly changes of sea-level, but got no clue. I cannot believe that these variations are subjeet to 110 law of recurrence. They llresent points of great interest. It may be that alterations in the width and depth of the, moving water stratum are concunent with the variations of surface Yelocities, as I once observed in current observation of Fire island. The })roximity of the Gulf Stream to the elevated shores of Cuba offers peculiar advantages for a

The surface temperatures along the 100-fathom line, near either 8hore of thf' straits, waf< found to be 77°, while in the harbm of Havana it was 7uo, and in tlw harhor of KPy V\-est it \·ariP1l from 82n° to 87n°. This variation at Key 'Vest. depended upou tl1e tidal currents; the elib from the weshn1nl heiug the warnwr. I haYe attempted to construct the curves of temperature from tweln· hours' obsern1tions. The ehli-currnnt, fiowing off from shallow coral banks, is heaku, while the flood from the oceau is cool. The night-ebb, which has not like that of the day heen expo8e<1 to the 1'UJJ, i,.; the <'oolt'r, hut still it is wa1·mer than the n·iglit:fiood. lt ·would seem that the ideutieal watl·r wl1 il'l1 1·.rnssPs i hf" reef with the flood doe8 not return with the ebb. A cin·ulatiou i~ prol>aule. The flood cro:s:ses the barhor with 82~0 Ht 1 H. m., but the ebb at it.s earliest stage, 4 to 5 a. m., crosses with 84°, whii<' the temperature of the air is 77°. I \\ill iligress a little from m.r proper subject in this plact· to sa,y that as we returuptl home we fouud the surfacP temperature in the northern part of the Straits of FlOI'itla qnitP :to warmer thau in the neighborhood of Cuba. The waves crossing portions of the heated Bahama baukH may afford by tl1Pir a<~quil'ed motion au iucrea8e of warm water to thi,.; portiou of the ,.;trl:'am, wl1ich woulll raise its tem1)twature and augment its tl1nY, but this would be Ycry small. Again, this part of the straits is leiss exposed to the sea, especially in the mouth of }fay, than other portions, so that there is le1:1s forced eil:culation among· the particles in thP uppPI' ;;tratnm. Its surfact· is perhaps heated, ai-; stagnant water mig'l1t. be, iwtwithstaudiug its bodily motion to thP 110rt11wanl. The failure of our Saxton deep-sea thermometers, after the first two da:ns' work, was unfortunattJ. I unwittingly expmwd them to injury by fastening them to Olli' lead-lines, and :mbjecting them to shocks upon the rocky bottom ; we had no meu to spart· for separate lines except oecasionall;\- for 100-fathom trials; and our time at any station was limited by the necessity of making .up our drift on a diagonal to the nt>xt, without losing our reckoning. Along the track of our :,;omulings betw{'en KP;\' '\Yf'st and HaTaiw wP :saw frw of' those phl.".nomena which to sailors :ue tlie familiai· fokenr; of the Gulf stream. 'Ye had usnall:v a smooth and well-1lflfhrnd horizon, a placid sea, and a serene isky. In the latitude of Florida cape, however, I was able to witue:ss some of the palpable signs of the stream: the "8errated horizou,'' tlw "breakers ahead," which vanished on near a.pproach, and tht· quick succession of <liBtant squalls at night, each of which originated in a single black speck in tlte clear sky, but rapid!.')· swells till it bursts in wind and rain, then Yanishes. I was surprised to fhul fop gulf-weed a ra,rP. object in our journeys across to Cuba. A single spray was sometimes all that we saw fm an cntil:e day. No other drift material was seen. The wa,ter 1*yoml the reef is very cJear. l fill(! in rny record frequent statements that our indicator was seen glistening in the sea, 10 fathoms helow the surface. In the approa-0h to the shores the telegraph eng·ineers will he ahle to see the la,y of tl!P 1·ahle long before it comes within the agitation of the waves. 111 the event of 1·upturn the e111l:,; of the cable can easily be caught and spliced.
DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF LAYING A TELEGRAPH CABLE.

The proposed crossing of the Florida straits witl1 a telegraph offers to tlw. experience of engineers hut one class of difficulties, viz., thmm to be met with in laying a cable in a cunent, or system of currents, extending to great depths. The spa-ce, however, in which these new difficu1ties appear is essentially but twenty-four miles, and over the la.rger part of this distance the hillf< of Cuba are in full view, so that eyery step of progress may be aeeuratel.'· measured as the work advances. Since the course of the surface drift is about east-northeast, ancl that of' the true cmirse from Havana to Sand key 11orth by east Jl east, them ma;y be a great ad·vantage in stai·ting from the

REMARKS

UPON LINES AND LEADS.

Tlw diflicnltie1< that I had in obtaiuiug knowledge from the experience of others, for the preparation of a pro11t-n· outfit for deep-sea soundings, has induced me to adu to this report some brief 1·emark1< npou Ill.'-- owu experience. Line.~.-ThP lines to he found ready made in the market are defective in mauy particulars, asidt:' from tlte lmd quality of the raw material. 'l'he hemp is not, sufficiently eleared of tow and th<· yarns art~ not suttkiently twisted, so that in the final laying up, sm-eral "after turns" are forced upon tlw liue whid1 weaken it by straining the half-twisted yarns. ThPsP forePd " after turns" come out gradually in the use of the line, and in so doing cam;e a rotation of the lead and erroneous registr;y upou the indicator. J arnes Slmll(lon, 'vhom I temporaril,1-· t'mploy(·d as a quartermastPr, is 11uitP an expert iu the use and iuspection of leatl lines, anti it was from him tl1at l learued the points I han' stated. Um· liuci:; wcTc made by Sewell, Day & Co., of Boston, who use the standing steam machinery, whid1 not only la,\-!'! up tht~ line in very loug pieces, (250 fathoms each,) but gives eycrywlinc au equal t11rn. Jn the old style "ropewalk," the ;nuns are stretched out the entire leugtll, (60 fathoms u,.;ua11,'1-,) and then twisted from oncc. ernl; of course. the twist is Yery unequal, gi·eatest near tlw wlwel, nud least at the further end. In the standing machinery of SPwell, Day & Co., the whole line is laid up and coile'l in the R}lace of less than 10 foet. I had sup}IOsed that there was an advantagt> in ·· Iww.~er-la,Ying" for lPad lineR, hut aHc·r full discussion of the matter with the manufacturers, whrnw si11e(·rc persoual interest I was so fortunate m; to seeure, it aprwaretl p1nin to me tlrnt iu "hawser-layi11µ;" there is no gain of strength, and a decided loss of pliability. Our lines were made of thornughly com Led Italiau and Hussian hemps. The yarns are well twisted, so that. iu layiug ll}l, tlw natural back turn suftieed for making a close but. pliiwt rope. On wetting they l1t>!'a11w i;m1wwlrnt hard, but on again drying, cxcl'ediugly soft and limp, without the least disposition to !\ink or snarl. If I were to umlertake dtwp-sea wmk again, I ;-;llouhl want to be provided with sevt·ral !'lt·ts uf liIJe, so that I eonld alwa,..-,._ nsp tllem ury. Otir o;mallt·st liut' used with tht> <letadiiug lead was of Italian lwmp, tltree-(1uartrs of an inch in circuu1ft·rem·P-t11at is, lrnlf the size of the dt~ep-sea lines used by the larg·er elass of sea-going 1>Jteanwrs. Tl1is liue was used in 20 casts, beyond the 100-fathom curve. Its entire length of 1,050 fathomi;, was run out seven times and on one occasion it brought up from the Lottom in 828 fathourn, by rt·~istry, the Berryman lead, weighing !Ju pountls, besides the indicator, spinltle and cup full of mull. A wineh turned by four men, and 13 men abaft, were employed at this time in l1m1li11g in. It 1wver parted. Of the next larger line, which was one inch in circumference, we had 1,400 fathoms of Italian hemp, and the same length of Russian. In a few casts where great outrun of line wai:; nece8sary, these two were spliced together. At thP lai;t sonuding of the cruise, with the entire length of the -Italian line out, 22 men failed for 10 minutes to i-;tart it, and the Corwin swung· to it as if at anchor by her 8tcrn. Lclllls.-Tlw Brooke sounding apparatui;;, as improved by Berryman, was the instrument most ui;1·cl b,y us, although in the matter of detaching the lead it is not so certain as that innmteu by Capt<1in i::la)l(].s, -which we ulso caITiecl. (For descrjption aud sketches of these inst111111ents, see Coast i'.lm·n·y Ut·port of 18<i7.) The chief value of the Berr;yman-Brooke is its excellent specimen cup, which makes no selection of the material. I find fault with the Sands cup on the grouml that it does not open

APPENDIX No. 6.
PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE INTERFERENCE TIDES OF TIELL GATE, WITH DIRECTIONS FOR REDUCING THE SOUNDINGS.
NEEDHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, Noi·ember 7' 18()6. DEAR Sm: In view of t11e pro11o:se1l work in Rell Gate, I :submit a prelimiuary report upon the more prominent features of the tidal interferences in that localit~-. Tlw tide wave iiropagated from the sea by way of Long Island sound, meets that which is propagated from the southward through New York harbor, in the space hetween Fo:rt_v-second street and Pot Rock; and in this space the observed tide is a coIDJ)Ound of the two waves. No single point can he designated as the meeting place of these two tidal systems, because, since the two waves di:ffer in range and in their laws of change, they comhine at different points from day to day. .Again, at 110 single point can the observed tide be said to be a true compound of tl1e two wayes, because tlle different phases of each wave travel at different rates as the depth increases or dim.inishes1 aud since their ranges are unequal, the Hom1d wave predominates further westward at and near high wat<'r tlrnn at lower stages. Th£, southern tide-tllat which ent-ers by way of Sandy Hook-scarcely modifies the form of the observed ti(le of the sotmd to eastward of Pot Cove: but the soum1 tide. is distinctly traced to GovernOl''s islaml, when~, although much reduced in range, it is frequently found to affeet fhe ob1o;erved tide mostly in the way oflesseniug the rise and fall. In other wonls, the southern tide after coming up through the Narrows meets a small propagation of the sound tide whose lunar interval differR ne,..'trl,v six hour8; tl1e rel'iult is a reduction of range. This is the principal reason why the Goyernor's islanrl tide is less than that of Sand~· Hook. It is only in the space bPtween Forty-second street and :Pot Rock that the two waves strug~le fo1· the mast:ry; and here, althongh thP -intcri·al..~ differ Revera! hours, there haYe never been observed fom distinct high waters in a day as at the interference in the Vineyard sound. The currents of Hen Gate restore the differences of e.le.vation in some measure.

In the interference of tl\o tide wayes of different ra11ge, tlie mo.~t llll<'ffflfill 11hcu;es are tlw.~e '?f ml(] /me 'JCater.

In the Vineyard souncl iuterfprem·<· this plane is common to hoth tidal :-;~·stt·m>;; lint iu Hdl Gate the result of the gTeater westwardly journey of the higher phases of the som1d tid<· is au appnrent elevation of the mean sea len_·l in tile East riYer at Blackwdl':< island. The Han~1ts\\·(1od tidal observations (made in the :<tmthern ehannd nParly opposite thP pcnitt>Htiar;y) ha Ye a meau sea leYel 0.4 higher than that of the souml, according· to our levelli11gs.

For the snrYey of XantnckPt and Vineyard sound, I furuislH·d Captain Ha:- 111oml Hmlgcrs with a map cut np into tidal clistricts, so that l1is soundings in each district, reduepd by a lm·al gauge, should hf' essentially correct. In the same way, I purpose to indicate for Hell Gate suitable tidal districts. A. From Polhemus dock to V\~ay's reef, (inelusi·e,) use a gauge at Bount~·'s wharf, in Pot Co.-e. B. Shell Drake Roek and Pot Hock should be referred to the mean of tidal ohsernition!'l at Hallet'1; Point and Bounty's dock, or elRe to a stricU,y local gauge on tlw A8toria shom. C. Holnws' Rock, Hog's Back, Frying Pan, and east sirle of Hallet';;; Point, urn.'· he rf'ferred to gauge at last-named place. D. The whole llistrid betwepn Ballet's Point and Horn'R Rook, indmliug· tlw gToup of rocks from the Ileel Tap, inch1siYe, to Flood Roek, ma~· lw rPfern·tl to a gaug(· on tlw Astoria shon', opposite Flood Hock. E. :From Horn's Hook to the House of Correl'tion, ou Blackwe1l':< islarnt a gangP at Ilell Gate ferry (city side) may lw mwd. The current8 of Hell Gate are intercllanges of water between two int,,rforing tides; their periods are referable to the epoch of re8torcd sia:f'a('c lei-cl. Tlw eastwardly cnrrPnt, usually t·alkd tlw flood, commences to run through the Gate a[)out 50 minutes aftPr the restoration of lPYel ht·twe<>n adjacent bodies of water on the sound and harbor sides. The westwal'(l!~- emTent (cub, ns it is called) follows the restoration oflevel at a smaller internll. The greatest contrasts of elevations between tlw waters of the two sidPs of the Gate occur usually soon after the times of high aud low waterR in the sound; hut the maximum cm·rents occur later. From the ri·1ations of these heads to the hei1.d1t of the ti<lP (i. <'., to the depth of water off Hallct's l'oint) a curious effrct appears. 'l'Jie flood current :tfow,; at n lower stage than the ebb, and is consequently YerJ- 111nch stronger than the ebb. Otl1Pr causes conPnT in this, hut I am inclined to regard the one given as the most important aml din,et. .At the time 1rhcii tlte fiuod current rea-el1es its maxhnu/m flow to the castu:ard, the (]epths through Hell G11tc are ti.co feet lt~'!s titan tliey are at the time wlien ma.rimum ebb prei1ails. Two quest,ions offer themselves for 8olntion, upon which my own mind is not yet made up. 1st. Would the remoYal of rocks from Hell Gate inC'rease or diminish the rusli of water through the dangerous pass at HaUet's Point 'f 2d. \Vould the enclosure of Ballet's Point, Hog's Ba<~k, &c., hy feuder piles, iucreasl~ or diminlti[Jli

APPENDIX No. 8.
REPORT ON THE GEODETIC CONNECTION OF THE TWO PRIMARY BASE-LINES IN NEW YORK AND :MARYLAND, THEIR DEGREE OF ACCORDANCE All'D ACCVRACY 01'' THE PRIMARY TRJANGULATION INTERVENING, WITH THE RESULTING ANGLES ANJ> DISTANCES AS FINALLY ADJUSTED. PREPARED BY CHARLES A. SCHOTT, ASSIST.ANT.

The re11ort on the operations aud results of the Coast Surn·~- of last year contaius an a hRtract of the discussion of the lengths of the Fire lsland, 1\rassadmsetts and Epping base-lines, togC'tlier with the resulting angl<'R aud diRtanceR of the primary triangulation, anil an estimate of ifa accurac;\·, throughout its extent in the New England States. In the present paper it iR proposed to giYe a similar a(~Colmt of the primar:y triangulation in its contimrntiou tH tlw soutlrwm·d and '1f'Stward, together with a branch (including snhordiuab:~ primary triangulation,) reaching Washington city. (Sketch No. 10.) The distance measured along the triangulation, between the Fire Island aud Kent lslan<l. baselines, is 263 miles; the number of triangles connecting them i;; 4-0 to the jm1ction-line Pool-Finlay, from which line Kent island is reached directly by fiye additional triangles. The Washington city branch triangulation, from Kent island to Washington city, is 40 miles in length, and contains 18 primm-y triangles, (also 11 suhordina.te. ones.) The reduction by the method of least squares was made in two secticms: the firi-it one between the lines \Vest Hills-Ruland and Pool-Finlay; the second between the last-named lirn· unit Causten-Seminary. The probable error and weight for each direction were determined and introduced in the adjustment. At stations occupied with the 30-inch and the 24-inch theodolites t11e vrollable observing error of a direction was arrived at by the method explaiJwd and illustratt'd by an example in Coast Survey Report of' 18u4, page 120, paragraph 3. The method giw.n there in paragraph 4, applicable to repeating instruments, was, however, not followed, but the short-Or metbod of writing ·out the results by repetitions, as if they were single measures, was substituted; the. reRults were then obtained precisely as explained in paragraph 3, involYing the formation of the diagonal coefficients. We have the following statistics:

Thi:-; disn<'plm<'y ammmts to a littlt· lN;s than four iuch<·s. In connection with t11e logarithmic dif!'t·n11<·1·, [ill 1.miis in t.llp Sl'Y<'nth placl' of cleeimal8, it ma.r be stated that the probable error of the measurP of the .Fil·e h;laud base amounts to ::!:: 18 and that of the Kent Island base to :::!:: HI such units. 1 n the report of lSuJ, Appendix :So. 21, the length of the Fire I.c;land base is gin·11 ns measurr<l and as eomputed from the two eastern base-lines; to these tlue<· ya]nes we may now add tl1at de1·iYe'l from t11e Kent Island base, yiz: 1JO;i8.80!} metres. 'fo mak<· this tlift'e1·eitee disappear, au additional rn1nation (length-equation) was introduced betwc<·n \\'t·i,;t Hills-Itulaud and J>ool-Finlay, making- the munher of normal equations :15. In eonseq1wm·1· of thi8 l~m11lition tlw f(H'nH:r augles (and sides) were fmmd to clrnnge but slig·htly (leHR than 0 11 .05 011 tlw :rrnragt-), arnl computing· with the newly adjusted angles, the length of the Kl·nt lshmd base, aR (}l·l'ived from the Fire Island base, through the tritwgulation, was found to agree with the nH»lsm·e<l length. 'l'he computation of tlw probable error of the sides of the triangulation was conducted in the same urnnner as P:splained at length in last year's re1lort. The probable error of the ILH»asun·, of th<> F'in· lslaud liasc is its 24 ,?000 part, that of Uw Kent faland base its :r:nfuuo part, of the line Pool-I~inla,\· its T:rl:nfO part, and that of the line mid·way between its 87 /;ou part; the approximate averag<' prollablt~ error of the wliole intern·ning· triang·ulatiou iH its 11 ,,10 0 u part, or nearly 0.5;3 ilwh iu a statute mill', which Yaluc, when compared with the correspondiug one of the northeastern branch of tlw primary triangulation, indicates a smaller degree of accuracy of the southern work, lhw prinC'i11<1 lly to tl1e mud1 smaller nnm her of measures of the primary angles, aud partially to the use of inferior instruments and a much less number of geometrical conditions in the figure of the tria11g"lllatiu11. }'rnm the Pire Island base to the side l~ethel-Lippencott, the work was executt'd hy the late snpcrintendeut, .F. H. H:rnslcr, who used the 30-iueh aud the 2i-inch Troughton theodolites; bt·tW<)C'll the line meutioued and the Kent Island hase the measures were taken hy Assistm1t;,; .James Ferguson and Edmund Blunt, the former u.sing tlw 24-inch theodolite, tl1e hitter a 12-i11ch Sinnus rcpeutiug theodolite. :Xotwithstanding the use of these Yarious instruments the character of tlw triangulation is througfomt its extent tolerably uniform. The execution of the work falls between the :years 1833 and 18-!8. ·with respect to the \Vashington branch triaugulatio11, there being au uncertainty of 2 2"1i'o 00 part iu tlw Keut Island base, and of ro 2\ 50 part in the terminal line :::;)cminary-Causten, the app1·oximate aYerage uncertainty of the distances is n-f..-oo part. Tl1is fraction amounts to 0.45 inch i 11 a statnte mile. \Ve lmve also for the '~xtensiun of the triaugulation south of Kent islaml the prnhable uncertainty in the line J\farriott-Routlt hai'ie = ::!:: 0"'.l<lu = nnfooo part of its length. 'l'l1c triang·ulatio11 (l'art VI) was execut{~d by .A. D. Bache, Superintendent, and by Assisfants .James Fcrp,<1H011 aud Edmund Ulunt, between the years 1844 an<l 1851. The instruments used 'Yere the 30-inch, 2J-iuch, and l!!-inch theodolites mentioned above. ln conformity with last ~·ear'l'I report a few statistical n'sults arn atltled, by wl1ich the tfogree of the aec1irm·,,· of t11e rneasm'('S may furtlwr be judgNl of; d('signating that portfon of tlie primary triangulation lying between Fire island and Pool-Finlay as l'art V, and that between Kent island an<l. the Dist1fot of Columllia as l'art VI, we have:

The above combination error was combined with the special ofo;ierdng t>rror of Pad1 <lirPction for the com1)ntation of weights to each direction, and employed in the ac\jul'tnwnt of' t lw g(·omt>trical figure. The extreme weights to a direction are in tlw proporticm of 1 to 5.3 in Part V, and in the proportion of 1 to 2.3 in Part VI. 'l'hc corrections to the observed directions, as demanded by the least square adjustment of the geometrical figure of the triangulation, are as follows:

The average length of a triangle side (between stations Ruland and St~minar~r) is 18.0 miles, the longest side 42.6 miles, and the sum total of lengths 1456 miles. The table of observed and resulting anglPs and of clistaucPs is arrange<l as for the preceding primary tria11gulation; all distances are expressed in units of our committee metre, and the numeration of the trim1gles is continued from last year's report.

The im;tru111e11t is 11ot now usPd on the SlllTey for determi11ing the latitude wlieu monnted iu tlw plane uf tlw prime n·1tieal. The reduction of trarn;it olit:iervat.ions is essentially the samt' whetlu·r we note tlu" time by eye aud t·ar OT hy chrouogTaphic registration.

The smaller sizPd instruments han· t('le,,;copes of twenty-six inches focal l(·ugth, with two inches aperture, or1li11arily used with a maguif\iug powt>r of fi:nty. This exceetlinglj- portal1le instrument, with its fohling frame, is shown 011 tlw accompanying· plate, No. 29. Either fiye or se,yen threatl8 are stn·tehed vertically acros,.; the diavhragm with two dose 11ori· zontal threadi; at right angles to the former. For telt·graphie operatim1s with tlie chrouogTaplt there are five tallies of five threads each. The star is made to trawro:e the field lwtwet>n the 110rizontal threadi;;, and the e;y1.· is kept tlirectl,y in f'L"ont of each thread, iu succession, h,\· uwans of a sli1.fo moved h.)r hand.

reyersed in its Y's during the operation; this method suffices for the portable instrument and gives a first approximation to be afterwards tested and JlCrfocted by means of transits of stars. The local time may readil;v be obtained b,y the use of a sextant, with an accuracy within a fraction of a minute, and the latitm1e may be found either b,y a map or by the same instrument, the nearest minute of are being sufficient. A small altitude aml azimutli instrument may also very mlYantagPous]~~ be used for a;;certaining with sufficient approximation the local time, latiti+de, aud direction of the meri<1ian, for the purpose of placing the transit in position. To point the telescope to a star when culminating, and supposing the finder to read ze11ith distances, we haye for a star { ~ of the zenith :- = ± ~ =i= S-r where the upper sign refers to southern and the lowel' sign to northern stars with respect to the zenith; the refraction r may generally be neglected. The index enor of the :finder may readily be remoyed by pointing to a known star 1lnd keeping it between the horizontal threads wl1eu trarndting, for which position the finder is to he made to show the correct setting. The chronometer time of the transit of a slow moying (polar) star is next computed, the tt'lesco11e pointed to it and the star bisected with the middle thread at the computed time of culminatio11, maki11g use of the slow azimuth motion of the Y, or, if need be, by shifting the frame of tlle instnm1ent. The axis haYing been leYelled we next set fol' and observe two close zenith stars, oue north, the otlter sontb of it, and with clamp east and clamp west, from which we obtain a ye11· close approximation of the chronometer correction on sidereal time. The process of bisecting a circumpolar star may then be Tepcated, using the azimuth screw only for this adjustment, after which the telescope will generally be found sufficiently near in the plane of the meridian to admit of commencing the Tegular series of obseryations. (4.) Method of obscrMtion.-Generall;v a series of obserYations commences with transits of stars selected to furnish instrumental correetious, then follow transits of so-c:tlled time stars; and the night's work is concluded by again obserYiug stars of the character firRt-named. The deYiation from horizoutality of tl1e transit axis is determine{! by level readings, for each star, if possible, and the inequality of pivots is allowerl for. The value of a division of the striding level is ascertained b;t- any of the methods explained in connection witb the zenith telescope, and the t>ftt>ct of temperature is t-0 be allowed for, if sensible. Thi' collimation is aRcertaiued by observing one-half of the number of stars with clamp E, or W; then reve1·sing the telescope and obserYing the remaining half~ clamp "\V, or E; or we ma.y 8pecially observe for it, noting the transits of a close circumpolar star over one-half of the threads, then reversing· the telescope and noting the remaining transits oYer the same threads, (now presented in tbe reverse order,) it is well to note t,he state of the level during each transit. The deviation in azimuth iR obtained from obsr~rvations of stars difi~ring conf'lirlerahly in declination, (RomPtimeR callecl high and low stars,) out little in right ascension, or from observations of two close circumpolar stars, one culminating above the other below the pole, and having a differnnce of right aseension not differing much from 1~ hours. It is not safe to 1·e1y on the stability of the instrument and the constancy of the rat of the chronometer by observing the same star at upper and lower culminations imm~diately succeeding. Knowing the reading of the azimuth screw for the t\yo statt>s of the instrument in which the azimuthal deviation has bt>~n determined, the value of one rliYision of its micrometer head becomes also known. It is well if the sum of the azimuthal conections for the circumzenith stars nearly balance, and for any two zenith stars if the mean of the tangents of their declinations equals the tangent of the latitude, the deduced chronometer correction will theu be free of any error in azimuth. In makingu}l his obsm:ving programme the observer, in the first place, selects his stars from tbe list of standard mean 1~laees of circumpolar and time stars, prepared for the use of the United States Coast Survey h.r Dr. B. A. Gould, (second edition, Washington, 1866,) and in the second place, from the pmiitions given in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, and in the English Nautical Almanac; should more stars be desirable, tl1ey may be selected from the three Greenwich catalogns in prnference to others. If more than one observer engages in the same series of observations, their personal equation must be ai,;eertained b;y metl10ds explained in the telegraphic determination of longitudes.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

APPENDIX No. 10.
DET~ATION
OF THE ASTRONOMICAL LATITUDE OF A STATION BY MEANS OF THE ZENITH TELESCOPE.
[Prepared for tbe Const Survey Manual by C. A. Schott, Assistant.)

(1.) General remarks on Talcott's method.-The method of determining the latitude or t'he declination of the zenith by means of the zenith telescope has been repeatedly described; · it was orig· inally de\ised by Captain Andrew Talcott, late of the United States corps of engineers, and was designed about the year 1834. It substitutes micrometric measures of small differences of zenith distances in the plllt',e of mea.-.;ures of large arcs, and it is to this improvement that the accuracy and facility of the method is chiefly due. In its application to latitudes we measure the !lmall difference of zenith distances of two stars culminating on opposite sides of the zenith, at nearly the same altitude, and not far apart in time. (2.) Since its introduction in the Coast Survey in 1846, the instrument ha8 received some modi:fications to adapt it morn fully to its use for latitude determinations, and it has now superseded all other instruments designed for the same purpose. T~ telescope turning freely through the zenith, and its horizontal axis being capable of accurate levelling, it was proposed by the late R.H. Fauntleroy, assistant United States Coast Survey, to determine also the local time by means of this instrument, and it has been so used, giving results of sufficient precision for the determination of the latitude. On the other hand, Professor C. S. Lyman, of New Haven, suggested and practically illustrated t the temporary converi>ion of the ordinary transit instrument into a zenith telescope by attaching to the former the delicate level and micrometer; the great advantage of this combination, both in regard to economy and facility of transportation, need not here be pointed out. Profossor Cbauvenet also remarks that the instrument may be applied for finding the longitude from equal zenith distances of the moon's lftnb and a neighboring star. As the time does not require to be known with great precision, the nearest second or two being ample, it may be obtained either by a i,;extant, using the method of e<1ual altitudes, by a small portable transit or by the zenith telescope itself; in the latter case a meridian mark with two lamps, differing from the middle line exactly by the distance of the vertical axis of the telescope from its line of collimation, will be found convenient. (3.) Description of the instrument.-Referring to the accompanying plate (No. 28) exhibiting the instrument as now constructed, a brief and general description of it will suffice. The telescope has an aperture of about 3! inches, aml a focal length of about 4J'i inches, and admits of observing with convenience, stars of the 6! or 7th magnitude. The magnifying power used varies between 60 and 12(). The tube turns fully round a horizontal axis of about 7 inches in length, and is balanced by a weight in such manner as to prevent unequal pressure and flexure of the axis. This axis is supplied with a striding level, and when horizontal the line of collimation of the telescope will move in a vertical plane ; it is perforated and polished, and the light of a lamp 1)asses through it for the illumination of the micrometer and other threads~ The yertical axis is supported by a column about24 inc11es in height, and at its lower end carries a clamp and vernier in connection with the azimuth circle. Tl1e horizontal circle is about 12 inches in diameter, and is graduated to read to half min· See The Journal of the Fra.nklin Institute, (Philadelphia,) of October, 1836.

The whole rests upon Uiree foo1-serews, by meaus of .,~d1ich the iustrument can hP levelled. A delicate level (value of oue division about !:f of a isecoud) at.1·ight auglt·K to tlll' bmizontal axis is connected with the telescope, and revolves on a centre so as to iudicat<-' the illdination of the telescope; concentric with tbe level pivot and firmly connected with the tube is a graduated twelveincb semicircle, or a six-inch full circle, on which zenith distances are read off to witlliu 30" uy means of the arm and vernier att~wlled to the movable le>el. The telescope can be set to au;y inclination and clam11ed; for accurat~ poi11ti11g t11e buhb]e is brought into the middle b;y a flue-motion scrt?w. The micrometer screw canies a movable thread for the mt?asure of the diflerence of zeuith diRtanccs; itR head is divided in 100 parts, of which tenths may be estimated ; the wltole number of turus are read off by IIH~ans of a rack sllown ou the side of the tidd of ,-icw. The value of one revolution of tlw micrometer is a hout Mi". There are also two fixed tllreads llllrallel to the mil'ronwter threarl, about. Joi' m· 20' apart, ill(licating the ranw· ht·tween wllielt the lHttt'I' is ordinarily employed. To provide for the l'ase of transit obseryatious t1wre are also five equidistant vertiea] threads inserted symmetrically over the optical centre. For convenience of observing, the tcleseope is supplied with a prismatic e;ye-piece. The instrument may be n10n11ted on blocks of stone or wood. (4.) Ailju.stment of tJw in."ltrwuent.-'\Vhen setting up it will be found conn~nieut to plUC(' two of the foot screws in an east and west line; the adjustments of the iustnuuent ma,\- then be made as follows: The vertical axis is to be made truly vertical by means of a striding level which should not change when the instrument is made to describe a complete revolution in azimuth. 'l'he verticality should also be tested by the more sensitiYe level of tlle setting cirel1.-1 in oruer to a.-oid large level corrections or a change. in the 1iosition of the tele1:;cope. The l10rizo11tality of tlle trausit axis ii,; tested by the reYmsal of the striding level. The eye-piece iR next adjuRted 1<J siden·al focus by means of the deftnition of a circumpolar star and the threads of the dfaphragm are properly focused. lt is important that this adjustment should not he disturbed durhig the observations, awl to make sure of it a leaden collar is sometimes employed to keep the sliding tube in position. 'l'lw lwrizontality of the micro1reter thread is proved by an equatorial star running along the thread, or by the same appearance, of a polar star, when the instrument is turned in azimuth, and tl1e Yerticality of the system of trans:t threads may e1ther be infern·d from this last adjustment or ma,y he 1<'Sfrd h,\the bisection of a distant well-defined teTrestrial oltject, wl1en the telescope is slightly elcYated or depressed. The same terrestrial object may be used for the adjustment of the line of eolliruation, which may be e:tl'ected by two positions of the instrument exaetl;r 1soo apart in the readings of the azimuth circle and making allowance for ecceutricit;f; thus let (l = distm1ce of Yertical axis from the line of collimation of the telescope, D =distance of object, aud p = parnllax, then

(5.) Selection af stars for oluwrvatimi.-The observer will next prepare an obsen-ing list. of i)airf' of stars, containing the catalogue number of the star, its magnitude, tbe right ascension and declination, the zenith distance, north or south, and the middle zenith distance of the pair, or the setting. The weak point of the method is want of !'lufficient accuraey in the catalogue star vhw('S; they may deviate as often one way as the other without doing more than increasing the probal)le error of a resulting latitude, but when the errors a1·e of a eonstant natun· they Rerious1y affect any deduced latitude whieh may depend upon them; hence too much car1.-1 cannot bf' be8towed upon a proper selection of pairs from the .,;atalogues, and ouly those should be taken wl1ich liave a satisfa,etory or, at least, more than QDe authority.

British Association and of the Gr~nwich Observatory ;· they will furnish, generally, from one to three dozen of pairs in our latitudes for almost any night in the year. The programme should commence with stars of the earliest right ascensions permitting observation on account of daylight and be continue<l to as earl~' a morning hour as the observer may find expedient. If there is au ahundance of suitaule pairs for the period, two lists may be made out covering the same time, but observable on alternate nights. In select.mg stars, suitable ones, culminating sub pol-0, sl,iould be included, and catalogues should be particularly examined for stars passing so near the zenith as to be within range of the micrometer with the instrument pointing north or south. The latitude of the station requires to be known only within one or two minutes, which degree of app1·oximation may be lmd either from a clrn11., sextant observations, or by means of the finding circle of the transit instrument, or of the zenith telescope itself. Tlie two stars forming a pair should culminate at nearly equal zenith distances, one north, the other south of the zenith, and their differcnc<> of zenith distance should, if possible, not much exceed one-half the b1'eadth of the field of the telescope to avoid observing near its edge; about 15' (or at moRt 20') is the greatest range for our instruments. The interval of' time between the culmination of stars forming a i1air sl1ould not be less than one minute, so as to give time, deliheratPI~-, to read the micrometer and to turn the instrument in azimuth for observing the second star, and shoulcl uot exceed about 20 minutes, to guard against possible changes in the state of the instrument. The interval between any two pairs should afford time for reading the micrometer and level and for setting the instrument preparatory to the next pair, for this three minut~s suffice for most observers. If the intervals between the pairs are unavoidably long, they may be filled up by observing transits for time. Stars as low as the 7th magnitude may be selected, their places are, however, generally not so well determined; on the other hand brighter stars are too fow in number. It is desirahle to select the pairs with regard to their difference of zenith distances, making the sum of all the positive micrometer corrections equal to the sum of all the negative corrections, whieh condition leaves the final latitude free of any effect from error in the value of Uie micrometer screw. No precise limit can be given of the greatest zenith distance compatible with the requirements of the method, but it may be readily extended to 25° and beyond. The following specimen of a list of selected pairs of stars will serve to show its arrangement.

The columns headed a ;; : contain the approximate right ascension, d<'clination, and zenith distance of each star. (U.) Direction.~ for observing.-The instrument being adjusted and tlw line of collimation of tile telescope placed in the meridian, in which position tl1e azimuthal motion is arrested by the stops, the index of the vertical circle is set to the mean zenith distance of the first pair taken from the list llre\rionsly prepared, and on which the chronometer time of culmination of each star for the night is noted. The telescope is then directed to that side of the zenith where the first star will culminate, and the bulible of t11e leYel is made tu play Yery nearly in the middle. As soon as the star enters the field, and when transiting on one of the vertical wires, or at any ('.,Onvenient rrnmber of seconds before the culmination, the observer will 11ick up the beat of the chronometer and bisect the star with the micrometer thread at the instant of culmination; the level and micro· meter is then read, the instrument is revolved 180°, aml the second star is observed in the same manner. During these obserYations the tangent screw of the vertical circle must ul}t ~ touched, though the tangent screw, which gives a slow motion to the telescope, (and consequentl3T also to the level,) can be used after the reversal of the instrument in the excc1ltional case where the vertical axis of the instrument is not well adjusted. (7.) If for some reasons the meridian observation fails, the. star may be bisected off the meridian and the time noted, either by moving the telescope in azimuth and bisecting in the line of collimation, or by observing flie star off the middle of the field, leaYing the telescope undisturbed in the plane of the meridian. The lat,ter method iR generally tlie preforahle one, particularl,r when the star culminates near the zenith. If, however, the meridional distance of the star be considerable the first method had better be followed. Though the star may be bisected several times while passing through the field, in our experience little is gained in multiplying observations upon the same star under the same circumstauces. The relative accllr',tcy. of a single observation, and of the position of a star assigned b;r the catalogues, points to the multiplication of stars rather than to that of repeated pointingR of the same star. It is not advisable to combine more than one north star with more than one south star, for the reason that greater accuraey is gained by observing pairs at different nights, and in case of any defect in the position assigned .to any of the stars thus combined it would be difficult to detect the

If the micrometer reads tmca.rd.~ tlw zenith, (the direction appean;, of coun1e, invl'rfod in the astronomical telescope,) change M-M' into M'-M; and it may be remarked 11ere, th:it during half of the observations at the station the iustrnment may be used in the re,ersed position of the tele8cope with regard to the Yertical axiR, thus varying the circumstances under which measures are takeu. (!J.) l>etermi11ati011 of the ralue of a <lidsion of the micrometer.-Difl'ereut methods have been used fi:>r tl1is purpose; the one formerly most employed was b,\' turning tlie rn icrorneter at right auglP8 to the 11osition in which it is used for making latitude observations and noting the times of the pas!'lage of a, close circumpolar star near culmination over the micrometer thread placed successively before the star for each turn or half-turn of the screw; now, let-:- = interYal (converted into seconds of arc) from culmination, and IJ =the star's declination, then the sine of the angular distance from the me1·idian = sin T cos,,, and the differences of ·1uantities thus t·omputell, divided hy the corresponding differences in the. screw reading8, give the value of 011(1 division. Tlrn treatmt>.nt of a set of observations by application of the method of least squares is given by J. E. Ililgard, Assistant Unitt~d States Coa8t Survey, in Gould's .Astronomical Journal, No. :rn, (Cambridge, .March i;1, 1852.) .Another method formerly employed was to measure the angular space CO'\Tered by a well-defined distant terrestrial object by means of a good theodolite, and also by means of the micrometer screw, from which the value of the latter will readiJy re8nlt. The method, however, introduced fo 1847 by C. 0. BouteJle, .Assistant United States Coast Survey, and now almost exclusively used, consists of observing a close circumpolar star near its elongation, when rapidly rising or falling, accompanied with but a slight motion in azimuth; this method avoids the risk of a disturbance in the focal adjnstmeuts--it requires the reading of the level in order to allow for possible changes, and necessitates a correction for diflerential refraction. By cos te=cot utan~" and cos :-c=cosec ii sin 'I' we find the star's hour angle t 0 and zenith distance Ce at elongation, and if a= star's right ascension, aud LIT= chronometer correction, theuChrnnometer time of clongation=a-LIT±te where { +}for

About 40 or more minutes before the elongation the telescope is directed to the star, and transits are noted, the micrometer thread being set in advance, consccntiYely, by whole or half-turns of the screw, throughout its length.

It is hardly necessary to remark that a number of sets of observations, for value of one turn of Rcrew, are mmall;y taken, aud their rmmlts are comuined to a mean. (10.) JJctermination of the 1·alue of one ilfrision (!f the lcrel.-The value of one division of the level may be fouud in different ways, according to the means available. The temperature should be noted, since the result may change with a change of temperature. Tile value may be found directly with a len'l trier or by attaching the level to a well-divided vertical circle and measuring directly the angular value passed over b;v a change of inclination of a giYen number of divisions in the position of the bubble; a distant object may he sighted as a mark, or, better, a second instrument may be used ao; a collimator and in connection with it; the angular space is measured with t11e micronwter ;,crew, the value of which i8 already known. To employ a star for a mark renders the determination unnecessaril,v complex. In the example appended, the value of a division of level ii-; found iu terms of the micrometer screw, the 1mbhle is made to traverse the whole leugth of graduation, and the micrometer differences corrt>Rponding to the displacements of the lmbhle hy a diang(' of indination are measured by pointing on a collimator; Ruch observations, in particular, sl1onhl indude those divisions of the level which come most commonly into use during the observations for latitude. (11.) Correction for d~fferential refraction.-The difference of refraction for any pair of Rtars is Ro !'mrnll that we ean neglect the Yariation in the state of the atmospher(e at the time of the ohservation from that niean Rtat1· "upposed in the refraction tables. Tlie refraction heing nearly 1)roporticmal to the tangent of the zenith distance, the difference of refraction for the two stars will be given by r-r'=57".7 sin (z-z') sec2 z; ancl Rince the difference of zenith distances is measured by the micrometer, the following table of conection to the latitude for differential refraction has been prepared for the argument! difference of zenith distance, or J! di1forcnce of micrometer reading on the side, and the argument "zenith distance" on the top. The sign of the correction is the same as tliat of the micrometer difference.

and the correction to the latitude is i of this quantity, whether the star he north or south; and if the two stars forming a pair are observed off the line of collimation, two such corrections, separately computed, must be added to the latitude. If the stars should be south of the equator the essential sign of t.he correction is negative. The value of m for every 5° of declination is given in the following table :

(15.) .Discwision of the 1·esults.-The weights of the results by each pair differ with the number of observations n1>on each pair, with the number of times a star enters into any such combinations, and with the accuracy of the star's position as assigned by the catalogue. To find the weight due to the number of obRervations or the probable error of observation, let n =number of observations upon a pair, p =number of pairs, Ll =difference of latitude between each observed result and the mean result deduced for the respective pair, (see example to Art. 14,) [ .:1 2 ] = surnof all the .:1 2 for any one pair, and.!'[ .:1 2 ] the sum total from all the pairs; then, if e = probable error of observation, . 0.455 .!'( .1 2 ] il'= n-p

On the average, the value of e from many determinations is ratl1er less than:!:: 0".1jO, the corresponding probable error of au observed zenith distance equals e ./2 or :!:: 0".71. To find the probable error e~ of a resulting latitude by any oue 1>air and the probable error ed of the mean of two declinations, or of ~(1'+J'), we must consider separately the errors of observatiou e and the errors of declination; then

The sign of the level correction in any case can readily be foand from a special consicleratiion.

NOTES OF A DISCUSSION OF TIDAL OBSERVATIONS, l\IADE H\ CONNECTION WITH THE COAST SURVEY, AT CAT ISLAND, IN THE Gl:Ll' OF MEXICO, BY PJWFES80H A. D. DACHE, SL;l'EHINTENJJENT OF TllE COAST SURVEY. (SEE SKETCHES H, KOS. 2 TO fi, INCLUSIVE.)

In cxeenting the hydro graph~· of the entrance of ::\Iobile bay and of ~Iisi-;if'RiJ 1pi Rnnrnl, com wet Pd tidal ohservations were made under the immediatA· dirf'ctiou of Lieutenant Cmmnamliug C. P. J>atterson, United States navy, Assistant in the Coast Snrve~-. The olw.ervatim18 at Cat islaull, at. the entrancP to J,akP Borg11P, J,oui;.;ia11a, aml at f'<wt ~Jorg-:i.11, at the entrance to Mohile bil.", haYe undergone more than om· di,;cu:ssion, tJw peculim-iti<·s of the tides giYing great iutcrest to the observations. The results, as obtained from a ;rear's hourly observatio11s, day aml night, at Cat island, "·ill be given as far as obtained, the steps taken for further progress stated, aml the iufonnation which has been obtained from other sourceR, hearing upon thiR most int<'rei-;tiug 1wolilem of the titles in the Gulf of Mexico, will be brief!:.· touched upon. I hope, in th- progress of the Slll'Vt".Y along this part of our com,t, to dcYclop tlic Rnl~jpd of these tides, full of importance to the navigator, and of interest to the man of science. 'l.'lwse ti<le,.;, with special exceptions, ebb and flow but once in t\\·enty-four ltonrs. The tide-gauge was of the kind known as the Lox gauge, with il float :1ml Rtaff, graduatl'd intn feet and decimals of a foot. It was placf~d in the harbor of Cat islam1, IlPar the liglit-hom.;e, at the extremity of a temporary wharf. The harbor, as t,lte Coast Suryey chart which I now present to the meeting show8, tnm8 ib:i widest and deepest opening to the east. Apparent time was giYen by a mark; and the obserYations were made at mean solar tinw 1);.· app1ying the eq11a.t.io11s. 'l'IIP time was of les,; conseqnence than onlirniry iu thPl'l(' ol·servations, from the small rise aud fall of the tide, which prm·euted small diftt'reuces of time from being noticeable by difforcnces of rise and fall. Slight inequalities, caused chiefty hy wrnd, were also found to afl:ect. the observations so materially that it was iwt deemed mh·iimlJIP to olJ:o;m·n· oftener than once the hour; and after attemptiug to determine the epoch of 11iglt and low water h;.· more frequent observations, it was decided that e.rrors would probably he i11troduced hy aiming at a degree of iirecision which the phenomena t11e.mRehoeR did not present. The obRervations were made da;\' and night, hmnly, for a year, with excet"ding-ly ran' omissio11R, aiid, as tbe discussion lias shown, with a degree of fait.hfulness whicl1 merits Yer,v g1·,.at 111·aise. The obsen·ers were Messrs. Gustavus \Yiirdeman and U. T. Bassett, attnche<l to tlw Coa"'t SmTP,Y. The general opinion of nautical men on the sul~jeet of these tides is that tl1P;v main I.'- 'll'pend upon the action of the wind; and the .-ery regular effect. which nrny he shown to result from a discm'lsion of the tides, in Teforence to the local action by the wind, leads plausibility to this g·e11era.lization~ which, 11eYertheless, is unfounded. The cau1:1es are of a much more general character, and such as usually infhrnnce tlrn tilles, Ro rno(lified as to he difficult to bring out; phenomena which are only accessor:.- in the ordimuy discussions assuming here the chief and overruling part. The reg11lar tabulation of the olJ;;erYatfons was made by LieutPnant Commanding C. P. Patterson, wlw did not fail to pereei.-e that the ordinary methods of diseus8iou of the tides were inapp1i· cable. His removal from the survey ou other professional sen·icc haR devolved upon me the labor

of discussing the results.
Their importance, intrest, and novelt,y, so far as our coast and their i;triking peculiarities an· concerned, have justified me in giving much time to the di.scuR8ion, wlliell llas lwen carried m1, under my immediate direction, by Mr. G. ,V. Dean, ;.;11h-assi8tant in t11e CmtRt SurH\Y, am1 hy Messrs. R. M. Bache, A. S. "Wadsworth, jr., and "\V. M. Johnson. I am indebted, for the diagrams necessary to illustrate the couclnsious already aITivcd at, to Messrs. Bache, Johnson, and Keyser.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

I 1nesent a part only of the labors of tlwse gentlemen. The wholf' of the hourly observations for the year haye been thrown hito the form of cnrvei-;, arnl numerous tables for examini11g and veri(ying the different hypotheses have been made by them. Though the subject wa"' reached inductively, I do not propose to present it strictly in that form. The wmk, even now, is far from being complete; indeed, we have rather reached the true method of discussion than have completed the discussion, and we ma,Y yet ha'rn to Il)odif~~ our hypothesis, though I thi11k not rnatl>Tially. I present it to the association as a work in prog;-ei;.~. vVhen the investigation for this station is made complete, the application of the rnethurls to the other stations on the Gulf of :Mexico will he in a degree mechanical. It is cnrionR that one among the eal'licst complete series of tidal observations on record, is of tides ehbiug aml ftowiug but once iu twenty-four hours. The obsern1tions were maue by Mr. li'1·:mcis D~n-en11ort, at Batsha, of the tides on the bai· of Tonquiu, and commnuicated to Dr. Halley, wl10 g·ave them, with a diagram connecting the phenomena with the moon's motion in the ecliptic, in the thirteenth volume of the Philosophical Transactions for the year 168S. Newton l·xplained these tides by his lunar theory, but in a way, as appears to me, to leave it doubtful whetheT he supposed the interference of two ordinary or six-hour tides to produce the phenomena. These tides luwe been n~ferred to since by almost every writer of note, who has given a general theory of the tide8. The subject of the diurnal inequalit,y of the tide8 has been so completely and ingeniously discussed by Mr. Whewell, ]\faster of Trinity, that it ma,y lJe i-;aid empltatically to be his own. He first pointed out the empirical law of variation of this inequality. The first distinct attempt to tmcc the cause of apparent ebl1 and flow once in twenty-four hours to the influence of the (linrnal irreµ;nlm'-ity, is also, so far as I know, his. In discussing (Pltil. Trans. for 1837, Part I) the titles at Singapore, where the diurnal inequality is Yery large, he was led to the conclusion, if carried a little fnrtl1er, "at a eertaiu stage of it the alternate tides would vanish." To this effect he attrilmtcd the "single-tlay tides of King George's sound, on thP- coast of New Hollaml, as ohseryed hy Oitptain Fitz Hoy," and gives the curves for a week's observations on the diagram accompauying his papers. The progress of the diurnal inequality waye along the coast of Europe forms an interesting part of Mr. ''-'bewell's labors, the conclilsions of which arc -given in the same volume of the Philosophical Transactions. In all these cases, lwwever, there are two tides in the course of the day, so as to bring ont the diurnal inequality by the comparison of the consecutive high or low water. The subject -is followed np in the eleventh series of tidal researches by Mr. W11ewell, and in the appendix, in which the diagram of tlle tides of Pctropanlovski, in the bay of A.vatcha, Kamstehatka, approaching very nearl._r, at cei'tain parts of the lunar month, to the order of single-day tides, is given, to prove tl:iat the diurnal iuequality may be so large" as to.lead to the appearance of only one tide in twentyfonr (lunaT) hours.'' The equations of the diurnal and i-;emi-diurnal tide-waves are given in this paper, and the wave produced by certain cases of their interference is discussed. (Phil. Trans. for 1840.) I do not pretend to give such notice of these important papers as would be necessa,ry in a formal communication. Unquestionably the observations now under examination would have furnished to Mr. Whewell only the means of trying ideas and consequences flowing from those which have been already discussed by him ; yet the forms of discussion are original, and perhaps new, and the couclusions llresent so much of novelty that they remain to be fully put to the test by more elaborate discuRsion, and by bringing the results at other places to bear upon the same question. I am forced, by the necessity for brevity, to omit a reference to the learned, ing~nious, and elaborate pa1·er of Mr. Air:5', in the Philosophical Transactions for 1848. Tlie smaJl rise and fall of the tides, amounting on the average to but one foot, would seem to make it difficult to ohtaiu the law of the phenomena, even with the aid of the most careful and truthful obser>atfons-the class to which those under discussion Jiave proved to belong. In regard botl1 fo time and height, we ma.y expect to be baffled by small irregularities, requiring long continu· ance of observations and comparisons of means to get rid of. Thus far few cases have occurred which do not exhibit more striking coincidences than differences. 1. To show the time of high or low water in such a way that the discussion might be readily

generalized~ the diagrmrrn, of which a specimen is before the aRRociation, wen· made, (Pl. 3, or 11. No. 2.) The Lours of the da;r are the ordinates, and the days of the rno11th tl11~ nlrneissa. The Bigw.; H and L show in their proper place the hour of occurrence of high aud low water for each day. The time of tl1e. 1110011'8 superior tntmdt is marked, and tlw periods of great.est <1Pclinatiou, and of crossing the equator. The result is easily ge11eralized, that there is unliuarily but one high a11donc low water at Cat island in twenty-four (lunar) hours, and that when there are two tid<'s tlw,Y occur about the time of the moon's crossing the equator, and are usually most regular and strnng·ly marked when in syzigies, with declination nearl;\- zero. Following one set of high and low watern, it will be found U1at tl1ey occur later and later as the lunar day gains on the solar, with \-er,y rem:trkah](\ differences, of which the explanation will be gin:>n towards tlit· period of small decli11atio11s. Tlw jnten-al from high to low water is generally less hy Ronw hours than that from low to liig'li. That as the moon a})proa,eheti the equator, there are a few days of singular (louble tides, or of sin).('le tidt·:-i, in which the times from low to high water are very lllltch iucn'asetl. 'l'hat whcu the dedi11atio11 chauges its name, a high tide takes nearly the place of a low in time, and ria rer8a, witl1 an interval of irregularity; or, iu other words, tlie tilll:'s are disphtel:'d b~- nearly twelve hours. 2. There iR, as Mr. 'Vhewell has remarked, no proper eRtahliRhment to he deriYed from sud1 tides; yet, we may obtain a desirable datum by tltrowiug the results into the form of ta hle;;;: in which the luni~tidal interntls arc arra11g·ed according to the Jays fl'olll tlic zero of declination aud the corresponding ~mperior and inferior transits, aud for 11orth and south dediuatimrn. This will lJe made more, clear by subsequent explanation. These> afford a test of the theor.r of tlt<'1'P ti<le;; by showing the Ji,;;plrieemeu t of tlw ordimitP of liigh and low water, aud might he n;;;ed for the inverse purpose of forming prediction tables. Sneh tables of hmi-tidal iutcn-als for three month" I uow submit. They show cousiderahle steadiuess and Rirnilarity of inten-al::i towards the maximum of declinations and great variations near the zero, aud greater diBrn·e1Hu1des tlwu ici usual in ordinary tides. Tllese are from a seri(·s of tables computed by 1\h. H. l\l. Badie for the year, nm1 ('ontaiui11g the times of higl1 and low wat('r, deduced from the daily cm·ve1;~ thl· remli11g1; of tltt· gauge, the rise and fall of the titles, the times of the moon's superior and illforior transii, aml th<> moon's declination. The interYals serve to show that the high watt>:r belongK alternately to the f\npei·i01· and iuforior transits"of tbe moon, aceor(li11g· as the moon's declination ii,; north or south, with a few ease" ouly which admit of doubt. Two sets of luni-tidal interYals were computed (see tablcs) for three mo11tl1s, to ascertain the proper epoch of reduction, or age of tlu· tide. Iu one case, tlie iuterntls were reforred to the l'luperior transit of one da,Y before; arnl iu the ntlwr, to the tmperior tnmsit of two (lays before. The square of the discre1iancy of the m<·an in the latter case was greater than iu the former. An establishment deduced from these numbers for hig·h water, without conectiou, would have a prohable error, as tried by discre1mney il·o~u tlie m<~m1, of nearly eighty-four minnt<'S. I have little doubt of being able to reduce this elTor, b~- computation, mnclt within t11e limits of ohserYation, so as to give useful prediction '.;ables. The foregoing resultR poiut <listiuetly tu a ruling cause depemliug upon the mom1's chmlinatiou. 3. The hourly obseryatlons for the year \Yerc thrown _into the form of c1iryes-the ahscissas representing the horrrs, and the ordinates the heights. Of these I vresent, as characteristic, the months of January and March, (Pl. 4, 5, or H. Nos. 3, 4.) In January the tideR arnsingk throughout the month, the rise and fall diminishing towards the zero of declimitiou; and iu March, two periods of marked double tides occur. The times of new and full moon coincide 11e:1rly with the zero of dedinat.ion of March; in January the 8;yzigies occur at times of greatest 1leclinatiou. A series of diagrams, prepared for periods of declination zero, show irregularities, or double tides, near these times. Before disappearing, the tide which is lost appears rather as an irregularity than as a real ti<le, puzzling to the observer, aud a severe t-est of his faithfulness. A similar set of diagrams for the periods of greatest declination show uniformly single h<1t·s lllHl tlte greatest comparative rise and fall at the 1mme periods, whether coinehling with syzigies or with tir8t and last quarters. Tn comimtiug tlw height of spring and neap tides hy the common mt>tJ10ds, four months gave zero or negative differences. To lliscuss the epochs of the pht"nomena, aR compa.rm1 with greatest and least <kdi11ations, I prepared two setR of tables, which requil'f' reviRion. 'fh<·y show 80metime:- an actual coiucideuct·

in tlw Ppod1 of least tide8 and zero of declination-sometimes a precedence and sometimes a subsef11w11ce-which, when uot cause<l by irregnlarit;v of winds, I lwlieYe will find a satisfactory Pxplanatio11; at a, mean, there was little adyantage in the discussion found from displacing the epoch. 'l'hc average rise and fall for the second day before the greatest declination wr1:,; 1.68 feet; for the !lay next preceding the {.,'Teatest decliria.tion 1.78; for the day of greatest declination 1.81; for the next day 1.8U; and for the next 1. 77. Tracing a curve from these would give thw,epoch of gTeatest i·isf~ aml fall about 0.75 days after the greatest declination. Tl1e average rise and fall on the coITespomling dayR, in reference to declination zero, were O.H6 feet, 0.75, 0.60, (dee. zero,) 0.63, 0.73, the curve giving the epoch about one-sixth of a day aner the zero of declination. The rnunberR, as stated, require revision; and there are causes for apparent displacement, which require further examination. 4. Thi1o; general examination tends to point to the iliurnal irregi1larit,r, a8 Mr. Whewell hm; stated, a;; Hit~ eause of the cwc11rre11ce of these Ringle-day tides; a Yiew which is confirmed by such examinations as I have been able to make of the hourly tidal observations at Fort Morgan, at the entrance of l\fobile Bay. The interference in thi8 case would be between the diurnal tide-wave, which represents the diurnal inequality, and the ordinary semi-diurnal wave; whether this wave has a regular progress along the coast, independently of the semi-diurnal wave, as was at firRt supposed by Mr. v'11ewell, or whether its phenomena are local, as he has siuce been led, from his investigations, to believe. If the ohserveu w~we is produced hy its interference with a semi-diurnal waYe, we can only study the phenomena to adyantage after the observed wave has hecn separated iuto it8 components. 5. As a first approximation, I assumed the two waves to be governed by the law of sines, aml tlwn uetermined the curve which would result from the superposition of two such waves, having the same or di1foreut origins. The mean of the regular double tides, ahunt tl1e y,ero of declination, would present a finst approximate value of the rise aml fall of the semi-diuraal tides, and the mean of double and single tides, at the maximum of declination, would, especially when near the quadratures, give a first approximation to the height of the diurnal tide. The comparisons with the forms of enrves already traced, addressing the eye, are ea8ily made. I present, herewith, diagrams (Pl. 6, or H. :N"o. 5) for the case, in which the maximum of the diurnal tide coincides with that of the semi-diurnal, is three hours in advanee, (or coincines.with mean water falling,) six hours (or coincides with low water,) and nine hours, (or coincides with the second mean, or· mean water rising,) using the approximate quantities refel'red to above for the greatest height of two component curves. It requires little examination t-0 see that neither of the first three forms represents the case, and that the fourth does so remarkably, even in what appear to be snmll irregularities in the daily curves. This will be seen in the results for October, of wl1ich a. diagram on a larg·e scale is presented, giYing the tidal curves near the zero, aud themm up to the maximum of declination, for the first half of the month. In the Ringle-day tides there was the same slow rise compared with fall; Rharp rise and fall near high and low water, with the tendency to a stand during the rise; the same excess in the interval of time from low to high water, over that from high to low water. This hypothesis as to the position of tlie two waves may J>erhaps be slightly improved by further discussion. It is obvious, from the equation of the curve, (which I have already referred to, as given by Mr. Whewel1,) that the form and position of remarkable points will vary with the constants in the component curves, as well as with the position of the origin of each in reference to that of the other. To carry out the representation graphically, I have drawn the curves for four values of the constauts of the diurnal and semi-diurnal, formed from the observations with the same displacement of nine hours in the time of high water of the diurnal curve, and corresponding to the epochs of the maximum declination, two, four, and six days before or after the maximum. These show the general ft>.a.tures of' the curve sufficieutl;y, a.nd the variations in the times and heights, the passage from single to doul>le tides, and the reverse; and the coincidence with observations is such as to warrant a close numerkal discussion. 6. The e·piatiou of the curve shows how much the time of high and low water depends on the constants in the diurnal and semi-diurnal curYe.

The means present the lit>st criterion, uecause uot tlisplact·d i11 this cornhinat.ion, as the equation shows. This mode of proceeding, howeyer, throws the test t-Oo much on the weak part of the results--tlle times of occurrence of high mid low water, or of mean water-mul does 11ot take in all the points of the curYe; and I haYe, therefore, preferred a different form of discussion. 7. Placing the maximum of the semi-diurnal curYe at O hours, in the h,ypothesis that the high wat~r of thH diurnal curye is nine hours in advance of the semi-dium al CUI'Ye, the two curves cross the line of mean water at three houns, the diurnal mirve riHing arnl the semi-tliurnal falling·; at six hours, the semi-diurnal curve has reached its maximum, and rises again at nine hours to its intersection with the mean water line, at which time t11e diurnal curve has reached its maximum; the semi-diurnal curve attains its greatest rise at twelve hours, aud the mean level at fifteen; the diurnal curve also descending to the same point at that time. Within these two intervals from mean level to mean level, the combination of the ordinat-es forming the actual tidal curve are exhaust.ell, tlie part of the curve below the mean level being symmetrical with the above; from three to nine hours the ordinates of the semi-diurnal cmTe as subtractive; from nine to fifteen hours, additive. The mean is the arcrage between high and low water. The tides of each day will give the forms of the component curves, beginning with the mean, and ending with it, considering as symmetrical the parts above and below the axis of X.

From three to ni.ne hours, the difforence of the ordinates giving the actual curve, and from fifteen to nine in the reyerse order, the sum of the same ordmates, half the sum of the two series of ordii,ates gives the value of the ordinates of the semi,diurnal curve.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

The case given in the table on the board, for March 5, will serve to illustrate the simple nature of thiR method of proceeding. The mean ordinate for the first and second branches of the curve having been obtained, and the hourly observation which coincides most nearly with it having been fonml before and after high water, the hourly observations are arranged from it forward for se.-en hours (m,) and back·wards for sewm (n.) The same is done for low water (m' and n'.) The half sums and half differences arc taken in each case, and then the means. The computation of the diurnal curv~ is made in the upper part of the table, and that of the semi-diurnal curve in the lower part. The number representing the mean level is eliminated by the mode of taking the means in eael1 table, and the ordinatt~s below the axiR are treated aR if having the Rame sign as those above. The semi-diurnal curve is turned over on its maximum ordinate, and the mean value of a single branch of it found. Then each curve is reduced to zero, in the mean level of the period. The last two columns of the upper and lower part of the table contain, respectively, the curYes of sines corresponding to the diurrml and semi-diurnal curves. In the case shown in the first diagram, the ordimttes of the semi-diurnal curve from mean water to high water, and corresponding nearly to a minimum of declination, and new moon, are 0.00 foot, + 0.02, + 0.03, + 0.05, + 0.04, -0.02, + 0.02. The moon's declination during the period being· about from 2° 54' S., to 1° 45' S., this curve obviously contains a residual of the semi-diurnal curve not taken out; but supposing it to be deduced from a just mean, the corresponding ordinates of a semi-diurnal curve, calculated with 0.04 foot as the maximum, would be 0.00 foot, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.04, 0.04, differing, at the most, 0.06 of a foot, or about thme-quarters of an inch, and, in a single instance, the sum of all the six difforences being 0.03 foot, and the average 0.004. The ordinates of the semi-diurnal curve are 0.00 foot, 0.14, 0.28, 0.32. The curve of sines computed with the greaU\st ordinate has, in this case, for its corresponding ordinates, 0.00 foot, 0.16, 0.28, 0.32, differing but .02 foot at the greatest. At the next period of declination, near zero and full moon in the montl1 of "M"arch, the ordinates of the diurnal curve deduced a.re 0.00 foot, 0.05, 0.06, 0.06, 0.08, 0.06, 0.09, and the corresponding computed ordinates 0.00 foot, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.07, 0.09, 0.09, differing at the greatest 0.03 foot, and on the average 0.004 foot, the observed ordinate being this time in excess, as it was before in defect. 'fhe ordinates of the semi-diurnal curve are 0.00 foot, 0.12, 0.22, 0.26, and the computed ones 0.00 foot, 0.13, 0.24, 0.26, the greatest difference being 0.02 foot, and the average 0.007 foot in excess, as was the fo1111er. For March 12, corresponding to tbe maximum of the diurnal curves, and to neap tides, (one llay after last quarter,) the ordinates of the hourly diurnal curve from mean to high water are 0.00 foot, 0.21, 0.36, 0.51, 0.63, 0.69, 0. 71, the corresponding ordinates of the curve of sines being O.OU foot, 0.18, 0.35, 0.63, 0.69, 0.71, in which the greatest difference is 0.03 foot, and the mean + 0.007 in the curve compqted from observation. The ordinates of the semi-diurnal curve are e:wh zero. Two days afterwards, viz : March 13, gives for the diurnal curve, 0.00 foot, 0.18, 0.34, 0.47, 0.61, 0.68, 0.74, corres11onding to which is the curve of sines, 0.00 foot, 0.18, 0.37, 0.51, 0.6:1, 0.72, 0.74, in which the greatest difference is 0.04 foot, and the mean - 0.02 foot, the curve of observation having the least ordinates. The semi-diurnal curve is 0.00 foot, O.OO, 0.03, 0.02.

These results are shown by a curve in the diagram herewith presented (Pl. 7, or H. No. 6,) 011 tlie full scale, the greatest differenc between the curve from the observation and tJit· cm·ve of tlw sines being less than a quarter of au inch in the mean, deduced from three monthf'I' ollservations. Whether this will disappear in the mean of more observations, or whether a modification of tlw l1~ypothesis of displacement of nine hours must be made to meet it, fm't·her computations now in progi·ess will show. 8. \Vlien this analysis has been made as complete as possible, and applied to the year's o1>8Prvatiom;, it will remain to take up the two 8erie8 into which we lmve divilfocl the observatimu;, and to discuss them numerically in detail, as we have heretofore done, generally, in regard to the knowu laws of the diurnal irregularity, and of the ordimtry tides. Each determination gives a corresponding value of the maximum, or of the ordinatt' of high water, and in the case of the mean of the curves for January, l<'ehruary, and March, these max ima are 0.66 foot, 0.65, 0.60, 0.60, 0.58, 0.58. Mean 0.61 foot, differing 0.03 of a foot from tl1e maximum found directly from the observations, and if the discrepancies are accillental, give a mean probable error by the variation!.'. from the average of 0.02 foot (one-quarter of an incl1) of any 011e of the determinations, and for the mean, 0.01 foot nearly. 9. By the kindness of Colonel Abert, of the topographical engineers, of :Major Bache, of tlie same corps, and of Lieutenant Maury, superintendent of the .National Observatory, I have be<·u put in possession of tidal registers which haTe. been kept during the p1·ogrel'ls of the local snn·ers made of harbors on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The tidal observations of Major Bache, United States to11ographical engineers, at Key \Ve"t and the Tortugas, are the most compfote of this series, and show, as a general phenomenon, the prevalence of the semi-diurnal wa:n~ at tlmt point. I have not yet had the opportunity to examine fully these results, which are, h4'.lwever, under discussion.

EXTRACTS FRO!ll THE REPORT OF PROFESSOR AGASSIZ TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE COAST SURVEY, ON THE EXAMINATION OF THE FLORIDA IWEI<"S, KEYS, AND COAST.
G.1DrnRIDGE, A1tgust; 1851. 'l'hc· following repmt of tht· examination made by me of the Florida Teef8, keys, and coast, i.s Jff('pared iu compliance with your request:
Sn~:

'l'OPOGRAl'HY 01'' FLORIDA.

To form a correct i1lea of the Florida reef:.;;, it is of paramount importance to keep in mind the topograpltica1 features of the whole country. Tlte penirnmla of Floritlil projects between the Gulf of l\Iexico and the Atlantic, from the 30th degree of northern latitude nearly to the 24th, as a broad, flat, low promor1tor,v, which l1as generall,rheen consideretl a couJ.innatfon of the low lands of the Routhern States. Ilut, as we shall see hereafter, this is not the case, or, at least, not with respect to the southern extremity of the peninsula, which consists of the same formations as the reef itself. .Again, in a physieal point of view, :Florida is not limited to those tracts of land, forming the peninsula, which "rise above the level of the sea, for the extensive shoals along its southern extremity, between the main land and the keys and reefs, as well as those extending to the west as far as the Tortugas, whence they stretch along the western coast, in fact belong to it, and are intimately connected with it by their physical character. There is a similar tract of ilats along tl1e eastern shore, but .it is not so extensive as on the southern and western shores, nor does it partake as largely of the peculiar character of the peninsula, being chiefi;y formed of the alluvial sand drifted ashore by the waters of the Atlantic. We sliaH have occasion, however, to show J1ereafter that tl1e narrow longitndillal islands, which extend close to the main land almost for the whole length of the eastern shore, are probably a direct continuation of the keys, covered with drifted sand.* This is certainly the case with the range of keys extending from the main land to Cape Florida, which limits to the east the bay of Miami, their formation being of coral rock, but covered by silicious drift-sand. As to the southernmost extremity of the main Jand pmper, it is vel'y difficult to <let.ermine its outlines, aR it consists of innumerable islands, sometimes separated by narrow channels, and some· times assuming the character of real islands only at high water, being mostly connected with the main land by very shallow flats. This is especially tile case along the southwestern extremity of the lleuiusula. The outline of the southern shore, however, between Cape :Florida and Cape Sable, is bt>tter defined-presenting, in almost unbroken continuity, steep bluffs of the same coral limestone which forms tlte bottom of the everglades, and may be traced, without interruption, along the Miami from the seashore to the everglades. South of the main Jand, between it and the range of keys, there are ext.ensive flats, which, esen at high water, are but slightly covered, and which the ret1·ea.t of the tide lays bare, leaving only narrow and shallow channels between the dry fiats, with occasional depressions of greater depth. These mud flats extend not only between the main land and the keys as far as Cape Sable, lint may be traced to the north along the western shores of the continent, and to the west along the northern shores of the keys, not only as far as Key West and the Marqumms, but even to the Tortugas. There is, however, this remark to be made--that to the west the mud fiats llecome covered, by degrees, '\\ith deeper and deeper water i or7 in other WOrdR, tl.J.at these low grounds, extending between tlie main land and the main range of keys, dip slightly to the west, being gradually lo!'lt in the shoals extemling north of the Marquesas and the Tortugas, along the western shore of the penimmla. These :flats are interspersed with innumerable low islands, known in the country by the generic a1lpe1lation of the Mangrove islands, respecting which we shall give further details hereafter.
·A direct investigation of this point, which did not come within the limits of my survey, would be of considerable practical importance, inaRnmch as it may lead to tho discovery of a basis of coral rock, affording a. far more solid foundation for the construction of the ligbt-l1ouse:1 wanted along that coo.st thau tho loose shore detritus.

The shoals l>etween Cape Sable, Cape l<'lorida, and the main range of ke.'"S, are litera11.'· stmld('d with these Mangrove islands. Sometimes they arc distributed without avparcnt regularity; sometimes, as to the north of Key Largo, the.'' form a continuous range betweeu tbe main laud and the keys. They are also very uumei'ous along tbe main keys, or at least along tbat Sid(> of t11em wl1i<'11 is turned towards the most extensive mud flats. Sometimes these 1\IaugroY(', islands form little archipelagos of inrmmerable small islets, so intimatPly interwovP11, and separated by snc11 11arrow and sl1allow channels, as to be almost impenetrable. Sud1 archivelag·os oecur chiefl,v to tl1e uortl1 of Bahia Honda and the Pine islands, as well i18 to the northweRt of Key v; est. The luxuriant vegetation which rises from these low islands, consisting chiefly of mangroves, gives them a ve.r:> peculiar appearauce. "\Ve shall ha,'e oecasion to return to this sul~jeet, when we attempt to explain the formation of the different islands connected with the Florida reef and the main Jaml. Tlw whole tract between Cape Sable and the k<'ys, east of llahia Honda, as far as Cape Flori1la, or at least as far as Soldier key, is so shoal that it will foreYer remain inaccessible, except to very small vessels. 'l'l1e keys consist of an extensive range of low islands, rising !Jut a few feet, perhaps from Rix to eight or ten, or at tlrn utmost to twelve or thirteen feet, above the> level of the sea. Tlwy lwgin to the north of Cape Florida, where they converge towanls the main land, extt>nding i11 tlw form of a flat crescent in a southwesterly direction, gradually receding from the mai11 land 1111tiL oppositP Cape Sable, tlley have so far retreate1l as to be separated from it by a shallow sheet of water forty miles wide. 1..'arther to the west they pr<:~ject in a more westerly course, with occasional interruptions, as far as the Tortugas, which form the most western group. They consiKt either of a(·cumnlated df'ad corals, of coral rocks, or of coral sand, ceme11ted together with m,ore or Jess compactness. Their form varies, but is usually elongated and narrow, their greatest longitudinal ext~mt following the direction of the main I'ange, except h1 the group of the Pine islands, where their course is almost at right angles with the main ra,nge-a, circumstance which we shall aUtompt hereafter to explain. Most of these islands are small, the largest of them, such a;:; Key v\' est and Key Largo, not exceeding ten or fifteen miles in length; others only two or three, and mauy scarcely a mile. Their width varies from a. <1uarter to a thirtl or h:ilf a mile, the largest barely measuring a mile across; but whatever the difference in their size, tliey all agree in oue respect-tlrnt t11eir stt>Ppest shore is turned towards the Gulf Stream, while their more gradual slope inclines towards the nmd flats which they encircle. This is a point which it is important to notice, as it will assi14 ns in our compariFmn between tlie keys and the shore bluffs of the main land, a11 well aR with the outer reef and the reefs of other seas, in all of which we :find that the seaward shore is stet>per than tl1at turned towards the uutiu land, or, in the case of ci1·cular reefs inclosing basins (atolls,) tforn tlmt which hordPrs the lagoon. The reef pro1)er extends parallel to the main range of k(·.rs, for a fow miles 8nntl1 or soutlwast of it, following the same curve, and never receding many miles from it. The distance between tlie reef and the main range of keys Yarics usuall;>' from six to two or thri'e miles, tlie whlest separation beiug south of Key West and east of the Hagged keys, where the spar,e is ahout l'lm·en miles. Between this reef, upon whicb a, few small kPys rise at distant intervals, and the main range of' keys already describe(!, there is a hmail navigable channel, ext.ending the whole length of the reef from the Marquesas to Cape Florida, varsing in depth from three to six and seven fathmm1, and, except off Looe. key, where the passage is not more than fourteen feet deep at low w:tter, averaging from three to four fathoms. Farther east the aYerage depth is again the same a.s at I,ooe key; but it becomes ~radually more and more shoal towa,rds the east, measuring usually ahout two fathomfl., or evHn lel'l8, to the east of Long key and Key Largo, hut deepening again somewhat towards Cape Florida, where the reef converges towards the main keys and the main land. Proteded by the outer reef~ t!Jis d1annel affords a very safe navigation to vessels of medium size, aud would allow a secure anchorage almost everywhere throughout the whole length oft.he reef, were the num<wous {leep channels whie.h intersect the outer reef well known to navigators and marked by a regular system of Hignals. A 8 it is, however, the reef seems to present au unbroken r:tnge of most dangerous shoul grounds, upon which thousands of vessels, as well as millions of property, have already been wrecked. These 16

122

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

facts have a stronger claim upon the attention of the gm'ernment, since there are, as already :remarked, nmnerou8 passages across the reef which might enable even the largest vessels to find shelter and safo anchorage behinrl this threatening shallow barrier. · · "' · · The reef proper, as we ha.-e remarked above, rum;; almost parallel to the main range of keys from Cape Florida to the western extremity of the l\Iarquesas, where it is lost in the deep. It follows iu its whole extent the same cmTe as the keys, encircling to the seaward the shin channel already mentioned. This is properly the region of living corals. Throughout its whole Tange it does not reach the surface of the sea, except in a few points where it comes almost within the level of low-water mark, giving rise to heavy breakers, such as Carysfort, Alligator reef, Tennessee reef, and a few other shoals of less extent, lmt perhaps not less dangerous. In a fow localities fragments of dead coral and coral sand begin to accumulate upon tl1e edges of the reef, forming small keys, which vary in form and position according to the influence of gales blowing from different directions-sometimes in the direction of tl1e Gulf Stream from 8outhwest to northeast, hut more frequenLJy in the opposite direction, the prevailing winds blowing from the northeast. Such are Sombrero key, Looe key, the Sambos, and Sand key. Herc and there are isolated coral boulders, which present projecting masses above water, such as the Dry Hocks, west of Sand key, Pelican reef, east of it, \\ith many others, more isolated. Though continuous, the outer reef is, however, not so uniform as not to present many broad passages over its crest, diYiding it, as it were, into many submarine elongated hillocks, similar in form to the main ke~-s, but not rising above water, and in which the depressions alluded to correspond to the channels intersecting the keys. 'J'hese broad passages leading into the ship channel, which may be aYailable as entrances into the safe anchorage within the reef, are chiefly the inlet in front of Key Largo aml to the west of Carysfort reef, with nine feet of water ; a passage between French reef and Pickle reef, with ten feet; another between Conch reef and Crocus reef, also with ten feet; another between Crocus reef and Alligat-0r reet~ with two fathoms; another between Alligator reef and Tennessee reef, with two fathoms and a half; aud a sixth to the west of Tennessee reef, varying iu depth from two and a half to three fathoms. The remark which has been made respecting the mud flats and their gradual deepening from east to west, applies equally to the general foatures of the main reef, as well as to the intervening channel. To the eastward the channel is shallower, the ground around the keys and reef hcomes shoaler, and there is a gradual dip towards the west, which makes the connection less ma,rked between the keys west of Key West, in the large groups of tl1e so-called Mangrove islands and the Marquesas, be;yond which there is eyen an extensive interruption in the succession of the keys before we reach the Tortugas. These last, however, as well as the bank west of these keys, belong none the less to the main range of keys, from which they are only separated by a more extensive and deeper depression. West of Sand key the reef itself becomes gradually less elevated, until it is finally lost where the ship channel, south of the Marquesas, expands into the broad depression, separating that group of keys and shoals from the Tortngas. · In order to understand fully not only the topography but also the mode of formation of all these keys and reefs, it must be remembered that the rising reefs, which form more or less continuous walls, reaching at unequal heights nearly to the surface, or above the level of the waters, are only a particular modification of those formations growing upon coral grounds under special circumstances. It has been ascertained, whenever similar investigations have been made, that liYing corals do not occnr in depths exceeding twenty fathoms; that the reef-building species prosper from a depth of about twelve fathoms nearly to the surface, and that different species foJiow each other at successive heights. Now if we keep in mind these facts, we shall see that all the coral-bound islands of the West Indies, as well as of the main land of Central America, constitute an extensive coral :field, diYided by broad, deep channels, over which the coral reefs extend, witl1 different featurns, according to the depths in which they occur and the changes which their own growth has gradually introduced u1lon the localities where they are found, inftuenced and modified to some extent also by the direction of the prevailing cuITents and the action of the tides. The formation of themain range of keys in their primitive condition as a reef-for, as we shall see hereafter, they have been a sub-marine reef before they rose as islands above the level of the ocean-the formation of this range, we repeat, at gradually greater distances from the main land,

as we follow their course from east to west, has been simply owing to the depth of the bottom from which the reef has risfm. lt has follo>Ycd the line of ten or twelve fathomR depth; and if there is so wide an interruption between the Marquesas and the Tortugas, it is IJecauRc the p;rouml is det'!per over that s1lace. Again, if the Pine islands b:we a 11orthwesterl;y direction, whill' the main range runs morn from east to west, it is no lloubt because the bod~~ of water emptying from the northern part of the gulf, along the western shores of thP pt'>11insula, has, for a time, run cliiefl~· over tl1at fiCld, while the tract of mud fiats between the keys and tJ1e main land was filli11g· prior to the formation of the outer reef, the rising of which, as an extcrrJU.l barrier, must have mollified greatly the course of the currents north of the keys at a later period, leM'iug between them 0111;'1- a fl'W rmrrow but nm-igable chamrels, such as exist now between the .J\Iarquesas and the )laugr<ffe islands, between these and Key West, and between the Pine islamls and the group of Bahia Honda.

We wonld only add that the absence of corals along the westen1 shore of the peninsula, at present, is probably owing to the character which that shore haK assumed in the progr·ess of time, for the penimmla itself has once been a reef, at least as far as the 28th degree of north latitude, as is shown by the investigation of the everglades, and by the examination of t1w rocks at St. Aug11sti11e. This latitude is the natural northern limit of the formation of coral reefs, aR also of the extensive growth of stony corals; though on the southern shores of the Xorth Americau continent, these formations seem to have ex.tended far beyond their usual bounds, ]lroba bJ;y under the influe1we of the high temperature of the Gulf Stream, for not only clo the narro"-, longitucliual islands whid1 extend along the easteru shore, awl their direct connection with the small ke;'l~S uortlt of Cape, Florida, indicate their coralline origiu, but we ban~ even under tlte .3~tl degree of north latitude ex:tcnsivc coral formations at the Be.r1m1uas still flourishing in t,lw present day. If tht' growth of corals has been sto})ped along the eastern shore, it must he ascribed to the invasion of drift sa1ul, which extends over the e\erglades, as well as along the eastern shores as far south as tlte :\1iami, Key Biscayne, and the bay of the Miami.
J\'lODE CH<' FORMATION OF THE REEF.

The reefs of Florida as they have been described in the foregoing sketch of the topography of that State, and, indeed, the se1ia.rate parts of each of these reefs, in their exteusi ,~e nmge from northeast to southwest, prese.nt imch varieties as will affonl, when jmliciously combined, a complete history of tile whole process of their formation. Here we l1ave gl'oups uf liviug corals, beginning to expand at considerable depth, mtd forming isolated, disconnected patches, tlte first rudiments, as it were, of an extensiYe new reef. Tbere we have a continuous range of similar corals in unbroken continuity for miles, or even 1rnmlreJs of miles, rising at unequal heights nearly to the surface. Here and there a fow heads or large patches, or even extensiYe fiats of corals, reach the level of low-water mark, and may occasionall;y be seen above the surface- of the waters, when the sea is more agitated than by the simple action of the tides. In other places coral sands or loose fragments of corals, larger or smaller boulders, detached from lower parts of the li\'ing reef, are thrown upon its dying summits, and thus form the first accumulation uf solid nrn.terials, risi11g permanently above low-water mark; collected sometimes in such quantities and at such heights a:,; to remain dry, stretching their naked heads above high water. In otl1er places these accumulations of loose, dead materials have entirely covered the 011<.:e living corals, as far as the eye can reach into the depth of the ocean; no sign of life is left, except perhaps here and there an isolated I much of some of those species of corals which naturall~- grow scattered, or of those other organisms which congregate arunnrl or upon coral reef's; but the increase of the reef by the natural growth of the recflmilding corals is at an end. Again, in othe1· places, by the further accumulation of such loose materials, and the peculim· mode of aggregation which results from the action of the sea upon tbem, and which will be more. fully explained hereafter, extensive islands are formed, ranging in the direction of the main laud, which snp1JOrt them. Elsewhere we may find the whole extent. of the reef thus covered, whieh, aft(·.r a still more J>ro· tracted accumulation, perhaps becomes united with some continental shore.

Now it must be obvious, that from a comparison of so many separate stages of the growth of a coral reef, a correct insight may lw obtained into the process of its formation; and, indeed, in thus alluding to the different localities which came under our own observation, we liave already giYen a general history of its progress, which we now proceed to illustrate more in detail. "\Ve would, however, :first remark, that the extraordinary varieties which exist in the natura1 condition of tlifforent parts of the same reef, or of different reefs, when compared with ea.ch other, fall~· explain the discre.pancies between the reports which have been obtained, respecting the reefs of Florida, prior to onr invest.igatfous. It had been stated that the reefs consisted solely of living corals; and, indeed, this report is true of the outer reef, which is called by all the inhabitants of Florida" the reef" par excellence, and is unfounded only with regard to those few islands which rise above the surface of the sea at Sand key and the Sambas. Others, who had noticed only the larger accumulations of coral frngments which occur on the shores of some of the islands forming part of the Florida reef, had reported the islands to be formed of coral rock"; while some who had, pmhaps, observed the extensive excavations made around Key V{est, haYe told us only of the existence of oolitic and compact rocks, almost destitute of corals or other remains of animal life; and from still other localities comes the opinion, that the rocks consist of nothing but more or less disintegrated shells, cemented together. * * * * * * * *

.AJ.__,IMAL LIFE.

This fullness and variety of animal life is particularly oh\'ious within the boundaries of coral fields, the natural limits assigned to the growth of these animals being those in whid1 anfrnalR of other classes range in 1-.rreater profusion, and the coral reefs tliemselYes also affording very favorable cirrmmstances for the display of numerous liYing forms. Hence the extraordinary assemblage of all classes of animals upon the reef, where, besides those particular kinds of corals which contribute largely to its formation, we find upon it, or on the foundation from which it rises, a great variety of other corals, which, though too insignificant in size to take a conspicuous part in building up these extensive accumulations of organic lime-rock, add uone the less their small share in the work, contrilmting especially to :fill up the vacant spaces left by the more rapid and durable growth of the larger kinds. They are to the giants of the reef what the more slender parts are to the lords of the forest, adding the elegance and delicacy of slighter forms to the strength, power, and durability of their loftier companions. But besides the stony corals, we find in the reef a great variety of soft polyps, either attached to the surface of dead corals, dead shells, or of the naked rock, or boring into the coral sand and mud. Such are different species of Arca, the date-fish among the Mollusca, and many worms, especially Serpula. among articulates, the agency of wl1ich in the formation of the keys will be described hereafter. A 11 these animals and plants contribute, more or less~ to augment the mass of solid materials which is accumulating upon the reef, and increase its size. Not only are the hard parts of shells, echinoderms, worms, or their broken fragments, heaped among the detritus of the corals, but occasionally even the bones of fishes and turtles, which are very numerous along the reef, may be found in the coral formations. The decaying soft parts of all these animals undoubtedly have their iniluence upon the chemical process, by which the limestone particles of their solid frame are cemented together, in tbe formation of compact rocks. Upon this point we may expect further information from Professor Horsford, who is now submitting to chemical analysis all the variety of rocks and the solid stems of the different oora1s obtained in Florida. R,especting the relations of the solid and soft parts of the living coral, and their mode of growth, we would refer to a paper of ours now in press, to appear in tlie next volume of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge. · ·

wa1'he<l away from its crest, during 11c~lYY gales, never accumulating U])Oll it till large boulder:;: and more solid materials Lave collected to such an extent m; to form sufficient protection for the more movable, looser fragments. This fact is beautifully illmitrated by an accurate sttrvey of Sand key, where a wide field of large boulderfi is iiartially laid bare at low water, presenting tlie appearance of an extensiye key, with a low hill of minute materials, the product of some hea.-y gale, lte<tped upon the summit, against which the sea pla~-s without disturbing it materiall;v, even at high water, when it leaves in sight only a uucleus, as it were, for a greater aecnmulation of such loose materials which may in time cover the whole surface of the larger boulders. \Ye have here in reality the same phenomenon which is nbsernid upon all beaches, ~where larger materials have first accumn_ lated on a shoal shore, being followed, in the course of time, by more minute fragments which ha,-e found a resting-place upon Im-els where the sea was powerless to increase the collection of coarser matter. In attempting to understand these formations, it must he remt·rnbered that the accumulation of the larger materials, collected at a certain lm-el, may modify the action of the water at a subsequent period, thus producing a combination of substances, heaped unconformably upon each other. This is, in realit,y, the case throughout the whole main range of keys, which La\"e been raised to their present le\-el b~- the action of the tides and gales for ages past, the fragments of which they are composed lm..-ing been thrown up at different periods, alHl o\·erlying eacli other in such a manner as to 11resent the same irregularity which is fonuil in all drift sii:atiftcation. Layers upon layers are seen resting unconforma bly, dipping in different directio11s so as to present all the modifications whicb may be obseryed in torrential stratifieation, each layer following, with more or less regularity, the course of the flood under which it has been accumulated.

By a process, not yet fully understood, but to which we shall return hereafter, these loose collections are gradually cemented into solid rock, presenting' the most di\-ersified appearttnce, aceording to the substance& of ·which it is composed. Then we fiud a coarse breccia, consisting of larger fragments of corals aud shells, iuclosing sometimes coral boulders; and this is the sort of rock which generally overlies the immediate surface of that portion of the keys which has beeu formed by tbc prog1·ess of the reef, growing in situ. Snch rock was seen among the foundations of the new light-house at Sand ke;v, where the large boulders are very numerous, and seem almost as fresh as if they had been lying on the spot but for a few years. It may lw, indeed, that during the hurricane of 1846, the whole cap of the rnef was renewed at that spot.
A careful survey of the character of the rocks in the keys affords satisfactory e.-idence that they have been formed at whatever height thf'y may rise, uy tht> same action which is now going on upon the reef-that is, by the accumulation of loose materials above tlie watei·-leYel. That part of the keys whic11 rises above the level of tlie water is therefore a suh-aerial and not a, submarine accumulation of floating matt.or, thrown above high-water mark hy the tempestuous action of the water. We insist upon the fact, that the keys furnish in themselYes, by the internal structure of their rock, the fullest e\'idence that they have been formed above high-water mark by the action of gales and hurricanes, instead of having grown as a reef up to the water-level, and he.en subsequently raised to their present height. The evidence of this statement rests upon certain facts obtained from observation of the reef itself, at Sand key and the Sambos.

Let us now return from this digression to the consideration of the kf\\'S themselves, under t1ie different aspects which they present. We find, then, that some have more abrupt shores, being-, as it were, narrow shelves with ragged edges, rising without a beach from deep water ; these are undoubtedly such as were formed upon the narrowest part of the old reef. Others spread more uniformly, having an extensive beach, and dip gradually under the sea, presenting a gentle, submarine slope, covered with coral sand and mud ; these were, no doubt, formed upon tlrn broader parts of the reef, where it descends gently on both sides. Again, we find those which, though resembling the last in general appearance, may have more abrupt shores~ owing to the denudation of parts of their earliest deposits. OccasionaJiy we see that more recent layers luwe filled again such worn places, thus presenting, on a miniature scale, among the latest formations among layers which belong altogether to the present geological age, all the diversity of unconformable deposit!'. which occur in former geological periods.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
CORAL REEFS.

Aftei· examining a gTowing coral reef, so full of Jife, so fresh in appearance, so free from heterogenflons materials, in which the corals adhere so firmly to the brround, or if they rise neai· the 1mrface seem to defy the violence of the ocean, standing uninjured amid the heaviest breakers, an observer cannot but wonder why, in the next reef, the summit of which begins to rise above the level of the water, the scene is so completely changed. Huge fragments of corals, large stems, broken at their base, gigantic boulders, like hemispheres of Porites and Macaudrina, lie scattered about in tlrn greatest confusion-flung rrnll-mell among the fragments of more delicate forms, and heaped upon those vigorous madrepores which reach the surface of the sea. The question at once arises, how is it that even the stoutest corals, resting· with broad base upon the ground, and doubly secure from their spreading proportions, become so easily a prey to the action of the same sea which they met shortly before with such effectual resistance? The solution of this enigma is to be found in the mode of growtl: of the corals themselves. I,iying in cmnmunities, death begins firt<t at the base or center of the group, while the surface or tips still continue t.o grow, so that it resembles a dying centennial tree, rotten at the heart, but still apparently green and :flourishing without, till the first heavy gale of wind snaps the hollow tru11k, and betrays its decay. Again, innumera.ble boring animals establish themselves in the lifeless stem, piercing holes in all directions into its interior, like so many augers, dissolving its solid connection with the ground, and even penetrating far into the living portion of these compact communities. Tlw 1mmber of these boring animals is quite incredible, and they belong to different families of the animal kingdom: among the most active and powerful we would mention the date-fish, Lithodomus, several Saxicava, retricola, Arca, and many worms, of which the SerpultL is the largest and most destructive, inasmuch as it extends constantly through the lhing part of the coral stems, especially in Macandrina. On the loose basis of a J\facandrina, measuring less than two feet in diameter, we have counted not less than fifty holes of the tlate-fish-some large enough to admit a finger-besides hundreds of small holes made by worms. But however efficient these boring animals may be in preparing the coral stems for decay, there is yet another agent, perhaps still more destructive. We allude to the minute boring-sponges, which penetrate them in all directions, until they appear at last completely rotten throughout.

SHIP CHANNEL.

The broad channel extending the whole range of the reef, between the main keys and the outer 1·eef, is rather uniform, having the same width throughout, with the exceptions of those few places where the reef widens, or the mud flats from the keys encroach upon it. Its narrowest passages are behrnen Looe key and the Pine islands, between Pickle and French reefs, and between Key Rodriguez and Tavernier. It is also somewhat 11arrowed between Alligator reef and Judian key, and is widest off Key West. Its depth varies also slightly, being shoaler in its eastern range than to the west. The shallowest part is between Pickle reef and Key Uodriguez, and between Looe key and Pine islands. But if we do not take into account those spots where the depth is reduced from local circumstances, we may say that as a whole the ship channel begins to the east, with a depth of about two fathoms between Fowey H.ocks and Soldier key, increasing gradually thence, until it reaches three fathoms bet,ween Pacific reef and OM Uhodes, then becomes again slightly reduced between Carysfort reef and Key Largo; aft.er which, with the exception of the shoals between Pickle reef and Key Rodriguez, it deepens again to three, four, five, or even six fathoms, until, between Looe key and Pine islands, it shoals once more to fourteen feet. Farther on it increases again to five, six and seven fathoms, the ayerage depth between Key West and the reef being five or six fathoms; and still beyond, more toward the west, sinks to eight, nine, and ten fathoms between the western extremity of the }farqnesas and the western end of the reef, where it spreads into the great depression separating the Tortugas from the Marquesas. The character of the bottom varies in different parls, as do also the living beings which it supports. Where it is the most shoal, as between J<'owey Rocks, Triumph reef, and Long reef, on one side, and Soldier key and the Ragged keys

THE UNITED STATES COAST RURYEY.

on the other, the bottom consists of coral sand, overgrown with what is called the country gra.'18; that is to sa.y, a variety of the limestone algre, mingled with Gorgonia, among which rise a number of coral heads. To the west of Long reef, especially between Car.rsfort and Ke.r Largo, the coral sand rises here and there in the form of Rhoal &"lndlm11ks, intermixed with coral hea<lH--an arranp;li'ment which is probably owing to tlie more rapid currents flowing in that part of the channel, which is prncisely the turning point of the direction of the red'. Such heads occur again about a mile and a half off Vermont key, half way lletween Key Tavernier and Indian ke:r, outside of which Gorgonia and sponges are very abunuant, upon a hard white sand bottom. Similar heads are seen between Long key and Tennessee reef, anu nearer the reef there are shoals of white coral sand, CO\'ered with Gorgonia.; but farther west, off Duck key, the bottom becomes softer. Off Bahia Honda, again, it is rocky-that is, studded with large heads, surmounted with soft muddy sand. This change in the character of the bottom is more olwious westward., where the heads arc fe>ver and the bottom more generally muddy, or covered with finer-grained. sand. For instance, hard sand isobserYed between Loggerhead key and Saddle bluffi but nearer the reef, as far as the American shoals, we have soft mud, with shoals and coral heads. Off Boca Chica, the channel war has also a bottom of soft coral mud, while shoals, with coral heads, may be traced for three-fourth8 of a mile along tlw sl1or1~s, as again towards the Sambos, in a depth of from three to two fathoms. The softness of the llottom in the vicinity of Key "\Vest, consil!ered in connexion with the scarcity of coral heads in that region, shows that a soft mud formatiou is unfavorable for the growth of corals; and, indeed, tlns holds also good for the flats 11ortl1 of the keys.

THE MAINL.A.:ND ·

A careful survey of all the varieties of rock occurring at Key \Vest, as well as thPir peculiar superposition, had prepared us fol' a minute comparison between the Keys and the mainland; but, nevertheless, we were no less surprised than delighted to find that the solid fou11dation of tlle main1aml consisted of the same identical modifications of coral rock8 which form the keys. Along all that part of the shore which was exami11ml, as well as upon the shores of the Miami, we found everywhere the same coarse, oolitic rock, with cross stratification, consistiug of thin bmls, dipping at various angles in different directions, precisely as we finu it at the western extremity of Key West, excepting, perhaps, that the cross stratification is here more prominent, the strata dipping more frequently in several directions within the same extent.

CO.A.ST SURVEY.

But it may be asked, what is the practical use of such detailed descriptions of the coral reefs for the coast surrny'? We need only allude to the unin~rsal impression of the daugPr8 ariRing to navigation from the growth of such reefs, to satisfy the most ske.ptical that a minute knowledge of the extent .and mode of formation of those belonging to our own shores must be of paramount importance, were it only with reference to the position of light-houses. But there is another subject connected with this investigation, which is not less momentous. It is well known that in the Pacific coral reefs have been raised above the levels at which they were formed hy the agency of the living animals, and also that in other localities, sometimes in close connection with those just mentioned, the ground is subsiding. These changes have been so often observed, whenever coral reefs occur that the idea of subsidence and upheaval is naturally connected with the features of coral reefs, and the question at once arises, whether the reef's on our shores are thus undergoing· vmiations of level, independently of their natural gmwth. We have seen how extensive are the changes produced merely by the normal growth of the corals, and the facts accompanying their increase. It now remains for us to ascertain whether this growth has taken place, or does at present take place, upon ground which has changed or is now changing its relative level in reference t-0. the sea. The facts already described afford a sufficient answer to the question. We are satisfied that as far as coral formations have been observed upon the mainland of .Florida, and within the pres-

128

REPORT OF THE SUPERIXTENDENT OF

ent extent of the coral reefs, no cltang-c~ of the rr~latiYe leYel haR taken place either by subsidence or npheaYal of the coral ground, and that all the modifications which the rnef has presented at successive periods have been the natural consequence of the growth of reef-building corals, with tlle subsequent accumulation of tlleir products in the manner described abo,·e. There is in reality but one way of accounting for this equality of lcYcl in the successive reefs; which is to suppose that their loftiest ridges are the maximum height at which material's can be accumulated by the natural agency of gales, and we have sufficient evidence to justify the adoption of this view. The fact that at present the highest tides during the most severe gales do not reach the level of the bluff summits along the shores of the main-land, or even that of the maximum height of Key Largo, or Key West, does not inYalidate this su1>positiou, for when the shore bluffs of the main-laud were formed, the ocean had full sweep oYer the ground now occupied by t11e reef am1 mud flats, which (lid not then exist; a11d when Key Largo and Key West attained their maximum height, the outer reef did not yet form a barrier, checking the violence of the Gulf Stream in that direction. But, even with the present obstruction, we have evidence of the occasional rise of the water to heights which fully justi(y our assumption, that even the highest ridges on the shores of the main-land and on the reef have been formed by the action of severe gales. For, in the year 1846, the water rose eight and a half feet a hove high-water mark at Key Vacas. Key West was entirely immdated during tlie same gale; and though that island is somewhat protected by the reef, even at present the rushes, driven upon it by the :flood, may be seen among the trees and bushes, at a height almost equal to its loftiest summit. In 18±1 the water rose ten feet above highwater mark at Cape H.ornaiue, on the western shore of the l)Cninsula.. These facts suffice to show that the explanation we have given of the formation of the reef is in accordance with the powers of the agencies to which it is ascribed, and when taken in connection with the peculiar arrangement of the materials of which they consist, seems to us to prove the justness of this view.
PHYSICAL CHANGES !if THE GULF STREAM.

*

*

There are several questim1s of the dPepest scientific interest, which may be advanced by a due consideration of the facts observed upon the reefs of Florida. Tl1ere we lrnve a pcninl'ula-a nar_ row, flat strip of land, projecting for about five degrees from the main-land, betw(\en the .Atlantic oc11an and the Gulf of Mexico, and forming an effective barrier between the waters of the two seas 1 which otherwise, even by the change of a few feet in the relative level of the intervening peninsula, would communicate freely with one another; and this peninsula we now know to l1ave been added to the cm1timmt, stt>p by step, in a southerly direction. We know that the time cannot be far behind us when the present reef, with its few keys, did not exist, and when the channel, therefore, was broader, and the Gulf Stream flowed directly along the main range of keys. ~Te know, further, that at some earlier period the keys themselves were not yet formed, and that then the channel between Cuba and Florida was wider still, washing freel~' over the grounds now known as the mud flats, between the ke.YS and the main-land, and t.h:.t there was then nothing to impede a free communication between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic ocean. The channel of the Gulf Stream was not only wider-it wa,s also less shallow along its northern borders, for the whole extent of soundings south of the main-land of Florida was an uncovered coral ground, upon which the deep-water species were just beginning to spread. But we may trace the change further. There was a time when neitller the southern bluffs of the coutine!1t, nor Long key within the everglades, nor even the everglades themselves, existed; when, therefore, the Gulf Stream ltacl a broad communication with the Atlantic, and the southern shores of the United States extended in almost unbroken contiguity from west to east, from th'e shores of Texas and Louisiana to St. .Augustine. At that time the Gulf channel was in reality a broad bay, as broad as the gulf itself, destitute of all those obstructions which now cause the tro1lical current to follow such a circuitous course between the West India islands, through the Caribbean seas, and around the peninsula of Florida. The in:fluence which the Gulf Stream has upon tl1e climate of the

Atlantic is so well kuown that its cornwctiou with the changes which the current itself has under_ gone within a comparatively recent period cannot he oYcrlookrnl. It is true, a8 we ha\-c every reason to believe, tliat tl1e tempen1turt< of the Gulf 8trea.m, in connection with the tm11perat11re of the southwesterly winds blowing obliquely acrosR the Atlantic, modifies that of the \H'P.tt>m coap,t of Europe. If it is true that the Gulf Stream and the southwest winds have an influence in determining the course of the isothermal lines UllOU the two sides of the Atlantic, and of raisiug heyoud their normal altitude the mean annual temperatures of northwest Rnrope, theu we may look to the physical changes which have occurred on the southeastern extremity of the Nmth Ameril'.an continent for the cause, or at least a partial cause, of those changes of temperature which lmye taken place in the beginning of the present period, in those Ycr.r northweRtcrn portions of Europ(' which arc now so much warmer than the corresponding latitudes on the Anwrican continent, an<l whicll, soon after the ac(mmulatio11 of the glacial drift, had as low mean annual temperattues as the coasts of Lahrador, Nova Scotia, and New Englaud i11 our day.

CHANGER IN .A_(}ES TO

l'O::IU~.

Among· the questions contained in your instruct.ions you a8k whether the growth of coral reefs can be pre\'ented or the results remedied, which are so nnfanm1hle to the safd,r of 11<1Yigatio11. I ma;v 8ay that here, as in most caRes where the operations of nature interfen' with the uesig11>1 of man, it is not by a direct intervention on our part that we ma.r remed,\- the d1fliculties, but rather by a precise knowledge of their causes, which may enabJe us if not to check, at lea.st, to a\-oi<l the evil consequences. I do not see tlw pos;,;ibilit;r of limiting in any WU;'>' tlw extraordinary increase of corals ueyoud the bounds whkh nature itself lias assig1wd to tlwir gTowtli. 'Ve 11an· sel'n how successfully seYer;il reef.'\ ltaYe been for11u~d~ rnon' or }(·ss parallel, witl1in the limits of the peninsula of Florida, as "\Yell as beyond the mainland. 'Ve haYe se('n, also, lHrn-these parallel or concentric reefs 11ave been gradually transformed into mainland by tl1c ncctmmJation of c·oral, ::mnd and mud, with other loose materials, and ali:;o that the k('Y" are now f'>lowl;'t' am1e:x:ed to the mainland h;'t- the same p1·ocess. We may, therefore, safely infer, that, a8 far as the conditions exist for tlH' formation of similar accumulations of foose materials, tlw,Y will eo11tilmP to oc<·ur, lmt tltt'.Y will mwer extend bP_yond tlu'\ nattnal foundation from which a coral rpef ma~- l'ise; and as we now lmYe sufficient evidence that tbis foundation is a sea-bottom, under from 12 to ~O fatl1mm1, we may be satisfied that outt.;idc of the present outer reef, where the slope is steep, sinking rapidly to unfathomable depths, there is no opportunity for the growth of a new reef. Here and there the reef may widen sommvlrnt towards tlw Gulf Stream, within those limits at which the de,pth does not exct>e1l twent;y fathoms, and from tl1e knowlmlgP we a1reml,\- po.Sl'ilc'SS of the soundings outside the reef, we know positively that this is nowhere a broad stream; we may therefore rest as::mred that the chauges which are going on will chiefly consist in bringing up the reef, for its whole extent, to the surface of the water, with oecasional inter\'euing channels kept open b~- the currents, such as exist now between the ke~-s; that this reef oncP matured will be covered by coral debris, hecoming transformed into a range of keys, similar to that which exists now inside of it; that the llepth of the ship channel betwt>en the reef and the main rang-e of keys will gradual1y lessen, and the channel itself be changed into mud-fiats, similar to those stretc11iug now between the keys and the mainland. In still more remote ages the present mnd-flats may become swamps, elevated above the reach of the tide-waters, like the evcrglade,s; and this prncess may J)erhaps be extended to the present ship channel. But unless some great revolution in nature modifies the present relative level he.tween laud and sea, it may be safely maintained that the present outer reef is the final sontl1ern bonndar.r of the ~orth American continent, aud that the sooner a sy8tem of light-houses and signals is established along the whole reef the better; for tliis is, after all, the shore which is to be lighted, and not the range of keys which is witl1i11 the reef. 111 refation to the western range of keys, nnd the western extremity of tlw reef "\Ve may t>xpect, in course of time, to see tlie depre8sion between tlle Mar(1uesas and Tortugas gradnall.r ksseneu by the increase of the reef, so that the westemmost group of islands may finally staml i11 ai> close eo11nection with tl1e ke~-s mme to tlle wust as tlwy now hear to each otlwr1 th(· passage lwtwp11 them being reduced to as narrow a channel as Boca Grande, between the i\IarqnP&1R and the :Mangroves.

REPORT TO THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE OF THE COAST SURVEY 01<,FICE ON 'fHE ELECTROTYPING OPERATIONS OF THE COAST SURVEY, RY GEORGE MATHIOT. ELECTROTYPIST.

OFFICE, Washington, JYovembcr 29 1 l 851. DEAR SIR: In compliance with your request, I present the following report of the electrotype art as now practiced. in this office. )lost of the apparatus and processes lwre used are eutirel.)' new. To dearly exhibit the advantages derived from their introduction, it will be necessary to cousider the iscientific principles involrnd in their use, and also to take a cursory view of the history of the electrotyping art. The art of working metals by electric currents is of veIJ· 1·eeent introduction; and, although it has advanced with great rapidity, it is yet, perhaps, b11t in a state of infancy in its applications, and of crudeness in the rnodes of conducting it. The electro-deposition of metals was observed by most experimenters with the voltaic battery. As early as 1804 electro-gilding had been successfully practiced ; but the idea of making castings by electric currents does not seem to have occurred to any one previous to the introduction of Daniel's battery, to which electro-casting is incidental. After the introduction of Daniel's battery, it simultaneously occurred to several persons that electrie. currents might be usetl to make castings of a finer kind than were obtained by melting and pouring. Propositions to this effect are about all that can be attributed to the rival claimants for the invention of electro-metallurgy; for neither the English nor Russian philosopher revealed what had not been known before. Yet to Jacobi and Spencer is due the merit of having called public attention to the subject; for in doing tllat, they have conferred benefits on the world greater, perhaps, than by making an original discovery. After the publications of Jacobi and of Spencer had called the attention of the scientific world t,o the new art, the principles involved in it became the study of several eminent philosophers, who disclosed the methods to be followed for obtaining reguline metal. After this, several departments of electro-metallurgy rapidly advanced. Electroplating, and the multiplication of pages of letterpress work, as pages of type, and woodcuts; (electro-stereotyping,) were soon extensively practiced; but the copying of the delicate touches of the copperplate engraver (the electrotype proper) was beset with difficulties. On account of the great value of the engraved plate, together with the risk of its being destroyed in the attempt to copy it, and the uncertainty as to whether the duplicate would have good metallic properties, even if the operat-Or should have the good fortune to obtain one, this department of the art (the first and most beautiful of Spencer's suggestions) was allowed to re>1t aA an experiment or be confined to articleR of Rmall size and value.

ADHESION OF DEPOSIT '1'0 J\UTRIX .

.Electro-metallurgy requires tbat the deposited metal should have an its cohesive properties. If such a deposit of cop1)er is made on a clean plate of copper, it is obvious that the deposited metal will cohere with the plate on which it is made, and an elaborately engraved plate would thus be converted into a mere mass of metal. The~ electrotype art, therefore, cannot exist hefore means are provided for preventing thi8 destructh'e adhesion. Various plans for overcoming this difficulty have been proposed. All thPse, howen·r-, have a oommon feature, which is to prevent the deposit and matrix from touching l)y mea1Js of an intervening film of heterogeneous matter. Mr. Smee proposes to use that coating of air wl1ich adheres so firmly to polished metals, (Ro strikingly exhibited when the attempt is made to wet a JlOlished knife-blade.) To obtain the air coating, he directs that,, after eniry attachment has heen made to tl1e plate, it be placed in a cool and moist cellar for a few days before introducing it info the eJectrot~1le >at. Smoke, black lead, oils, and powders, and wax, have also been proposed for covering the face of the plate. The method used in the British ordnance sun'ey is perhapR tlte best of all these. This is conducterl as follows: The plate is first well oiled, and the oil well wiped away with S()ft l)rf'ad. The plate is then heated to above the temperature of melting wax, and a cake of white wax pressed against the edge. The oil having remo\'ed the air from the plate, the wax will flaRh over it in an extremely thin sheet or film. All excess of wax is then to he wiped away with a fine linen cloth, free from lint. The plate must be left fo cool before introducing it into the mt. To smear the face of the finely engraved plate is in opposition to the fundamental idea of the electrotype, which is that of atomic casting. In the process of Mr. Smee, air bubhles will be retained in the fine liues of t11e graving, thus mutilating the copy; moreover, the face of the new pla.te is waved from tlte agitation of the stratum of air when recehing the first portion of copper. In the waxing process it is almost impossible to free eYery line from excess of wax. EYen days of tedious application do not insure perfection. In addition to the coarseness of tliese yarious methods, they are extremely uncertain as to whether they effect the purpose for which they are applied. It was always observeu that if the deposited metal was not dejicient in meclianical properties, it stuck very hard to the original, and the plates bad to be subjected to violent jarring, heating, or beating, to separate them. But if the deposited metal was of very :fine quality, then most likely the deposit was insep:tmbly united to it. :From these circumstances attending the adhesion of the deposit, it occurred to me that when the cohesiYe foree was 1mt feebly developed in the deposited metal, then the force of cohesion or homogeneous attraction could not extend the distance presented by the thickness of the film of heterogeneous matter between the plates, lmt tl1at whPn these forces were well developed the spheres of homogeneous attraction of ea.ch plate would extend through the wax or air film. It may be proper here to remark that the above views of adhesion have been applied to another department of electro-metallurgy with the most gratif~·ing Rnccess. In electro-plating the difficu1t;r of obtaining a firm adlwsion of tlw film of prf'cions nwtal is m1tirely obviated by making such arrangements a!\ insure a rapid deposition of higl1l~· ductile metal at the moment the article to be plated is innuersed iu the p]et'trolyte. In considering the sticking of the plates, after homogeneous attraction or cohesion, laeterogeneous attraction or adhesion demands attention; for two similar bodies may be Reparatetl by a film of heterogeneous matter which binds them more firmly together than their particles are held together by cohesion, as we see in the use of cements. This force is very powerful between some bodies, while between others it is very sligl1t. Air adheres very strongly to metals, as before referred to; hence a film of air ma,y unite two copper plates, even though they are separated beyond the distance at which cohesive attraetion takes place. Wax is a common ingredient in cements; its adhesive properties have become proYerbial; its use is evidently improper. Therefore a substance having a strong adhesive attraction for the plates must not be on the face, and the cohesive force of the surface particles must be suspended by other methods than making the deposited ID(\tal deficient in mechanical properties.

It was hoped that a substance could be found that would act uniformly and gently on the surface of tbe engraved plate, aml, in destroying the homogeneous attraction of the surface particles, would, by chemical union v·ith them, form an insoluble and friable compound, having but a slight adhesion to the plate. I was led to Relect iodine for the experiment on account of its sparing solubility in water, its high equivalent number, and innoxious qualities. A copper plate .was well cleaned, exposed to the n1por of iodine, and electrot~·ped; the deposit separated from 't readily. This was repeitted some humlred times with invariable success. It was found, in cleaning large plates for the application of the iodine vapor, that while one part of the plate was being cleaned, another part would t:trnish, and hence a uniform action of the iodine could not be obtained. This led to silvering the plates before iodizing, which facilitated the cleaning and exhibited the action of the halogen. A silYered plate was washed witl1 au alcoholic solution of iodine and electrotyped; the electrotype separated from· the matrix yet more readily tltan Jmforn, the iodide of silver serving bett.er to prevent adhesion than the iodide of copper. But it was soon observed that a plate prepared on a dull <lay did not separate so readily as one prepared under a bright sky, and on experimenting it was found that a plate iodized and exposed to snnshine would separate with very great facility; while a plate iodized on a rainy day, aml placed in a dark room for a few hours before introducing it into the vat, might stick so hard as to require some of the old resorts of heatiug and jarring to separate it from the matrix. The process of iodizing and exposing to light has now been applied to a Yery great extent of finely engraved surface, and in no case has the least difficulty been found in lifting one plate off the other when the requisite thickness had l>een obtained. I am aware that it may be thought that the iodine acts only by intervening between the plates; but the quantity of iodine applied to a plate must be thought insufficient to effect it by mere mechanical separation when we consiiler the large quantity of silex and carbon found in ordinary copper. If but one ounce of copper be dissolved from a square foot of ordinary plate, a very l1eavy deposit of impurities is left, (sometimes five per cent.,) and the quantity of wax which may be applied to a plate, and fail to prevent sticking, is ten thousand times more than the quantity of iolline which prevents it. In preparing our largest plates, ha\ing ten square feet of face, I use a solution of one grain of iodine in 20,000 grains of strong alcohol. If one grain of the solution is required to wet a square foot, it will give but 20 ;, 00 of a grain of iodine on a square foot. But as the iodine evaporates rapidly with the alcohol, probably the actual quantity on a square foot does not exceed one-hundredthousandth part of a grain. Taking the weight of a cubic inch of iodine at 1,250 grains, and supposing that it remains on the silver surface in its elementary state, instead of forming iodide of silver, then we have 1,250 x 144 x 100,000=18,000,000,000, one-eighttien-thousand-millionth part of an inch for the thickness of the coating of iodine. Even if we suppose that the solar rays decompose the iodide of silver, and leave the iodine in vapor on the plate, it will still be only one-forty-four-millionth part of an inch-a thickness to be taken as nothing in a mechanical view. To test the effect of the chemical method of prewnting ailhesion on the sharpnessofthe engraved lines, an engraving was seven times successively transferred from plate to plate, when the closest inspection failed to show any inferiority of impression8 from the last plate as compared with those from the first.
TIME AND EXPENSE OF ELECTRO-CASTING.

Next in importance to securing a certain and easy separation of the matrix and casting is bringing the entire time and expense of electrotyping within the narrowest limits. :J\fr. Smee and others have shown that the quality of electro-metal is determined by certain rela. ticns lJetween the rapidity of forming the plate and the strength of the solution in which it is formed. Both t11e common operations of the electrie-metallurgist, and the improvements be proposes, must conform to these relations. As small quantities of electricity are easily set in motion, small-sized electro-castings are readily made in six or eight days. To make large castings in a short time requires a powerful cur·

rent. To accomplish the corresponding augmentation in the cfiectiYc electric action l1as proved a somewhat difficult matter. At the date of the ··Aide Memoire to the Military Sciences," it ii~ 81.atP!l that in the ordnance survey one pound of coppe1· was c1epm;ite1l in twenty-fonr hours on a plate of eight >1quare feet. the plates beiug made ductile enough to hear hammering only by continued agitation of the eledrolytic solutions. At this rate, to make a plate one-eigM.h of an inch thick will require forty-:fiye da.rn. So far as lam informed, the above performance has not been excelled, aH to quality and time, on large work an;rwhere prior to being attained as now to he described. The first and most obvious suggestion for increasing the rate of deposition iR to enlarge the battery; this, however, is incapable of producing tlie desired end. To 1)l'ese11t this suhje.ct in a clear and satisfactory manner, I will make use of the celehrat{'d formula of Professor Ohm, who deduced from mathematical reasoning, au<l established br experiment, that the effecth-e force of the cu1"1"e11t, from any battery was direl'tl.Y as tlm electromotive force, and inversely as the resistance offered to that current. To express this, he gaye the Pquation

R!r

=Q, iu which E represents the electromotive force, or affinity of acid for zine, and H+r the

resistance to the current generated hy that force; R representing the resh:tauee offerNl to it from the li<1uid containe1l betw('en the positive and negatiYe element:-; of the l1atter,y, aud r t.lte re1'i8tance ofte.red by tl1e object on which the battery is working, and Q the amount of work executed, OI' the quantity of the current obtaint'd. The resistance of conductors has been found to be directly as the length, and inversely as the section. So far as concerns form of arrangement, Eis constant, for the materials ns(;d, as it depends on their chemical relations; Q can therefore he fayorahly affl~ded only by varying Hor r. Now, as H re11resents the resistance of the liquid contained betweeu the battery plateR, to increat1ti the sizt> of the plates is only t<J increase the section of the liquid, or, in other words, to <liruiuish the resistance represented by R. The expression, R! r =Q, shows that if the resistance in the battery is small, com-

pared to the external resistance, the gain of effect from e11larg·ing the battery plates is but small. To determine the relative value of n, as compared with r, a battery was constructed so as to collect and measure the gas evolved by its action. The plates were pla0ed in contact with each other, and the gas evolved in thirty minutes taken as a unit of eftect. As in this case the current did not pass through anything but the battery, there is no resistance t-0 be represented by r, or r in the formula will be equal to O, and Q =

-~ = 1.

The batwry was then attached to a pair of electrodes, in a certain solution of sulphate of copper and sulphmic acid, es1)ecial1y I'ecommeuded by all the wriwrs on e1eetro-metallurgy, the arrangement being such as to pruducP good metal. The gas now evolved in tlnrty minutes was found only one-twentieth of the former amount; hence the introduction of the resistance, r, had diminished Q twenty times, and

To exhibit the e:ffect of battery

enlargement, we now have Q = r--- ._. ff m = 1, then Q = .0·1; if m = 2, Q = .rnn2; if m = 3, m+ 19 Q = .0518; if m = 4, Q = .Ou24, &c., &c. This shows a gain of only a fortieth from doubling the size of the battery, &c.: an advantage too small to repay for the cnlarg-ement. These calculations are in accordance with experime.ntal results from small batteries; but in large ones the necessity of further separating the plates, in increasing their size, makes the resistance increase instead of diminish, and there is consequently a losR from enlargement. It is not, therefore, hy merely increasing the batter~' surface that the time for electrot,yping can be shortened. Mr. Smee, tile distiuguished writer on electro-metallurgy, by covering the negative plate of tbe battery with pulverulent platinum, inoduced a very energetic form of the instrument. "\"\'hen the plate is freshly platinized, it acts ·iolently, and throws off the hydrogen in torrents. But this increased energy of the plate is gradually lost, from the electric current depositing upon it impu. rities from the zinc.

As this deposit has a strong attraction for the hydmgen, it is retained on the plate. The plate, being thus encased in air, is Yirtually excluded from the liquid of the battery. The ordinary solvents of the metals do not readily remove this coating of impurity. The plate can be renewed by replatiuization; but, as this is 1JoU1 tedious and expensiYe, I was urged to find a menstrumn which would restore the original platinm11-to its energy. This T attained, at 1engtl1, by immersing the plate in a solution of per-chloride of iron, which almost immediately restores the action of the

The plates are now daily immersed in the chloride of iron, by which the tone of tlle battery is constantly maintained. By this last discovery, together with obtaining better solutions for the decomposing cell, the time for making a casting was reduced; but still the time required for making a plate was too long when only one electrical equivalent was employed. The effective force of one battery may be added to another. This is increasing E in the formula, and this will sometimes increase Q. vYe unite the effective force of many lmtteries by joining their dissimilar ends in consecutive order. As the currnnt in such an arrangement has to traverse every lmttery in tl1e chain, R will

the values of r and H are nearly equal, and we have batteries of definite construction to work with, it becomes a matter of some importance to deterIDine whether we shall m;e the whole galvanic apparatuR, as a single electricaJ equivalent, by connecting all the similm· i·arts of all the battery cells, or whether we shall convert it into a battery of two pain;;, in consecutive order, by joining dissimilar ends. As doubliug the battery is doubling R, and to double the electrical equiv~ilents is also to double R, we shall increase R fourfold by tl1e double anangement. Instead of Q = l"{ ~r 2 E .

As dividing R by 2 is doubling the battery surface, we may now make Q = .18.'3. The gain per cent., now indicated by doubling the surface, makes it advantag~ons to make this increase when two consecutive batteries are used. The difficulty of obtaining large flat plates of silver proved a serious obstacle in effecting an increase of battery surface, for the irregularity of the surfa<\e requires the plate to he })laced at an increaRed distance from the zinc, tlrnrehy augmenting It, tl!e very thing SQnght t-0 be diminished. Plates could be made flat by the use of the pfanishing hammer; but the operation being expensi\·e, and the plates continually liable to accidents in use, economy prohibited this mode of forming :fiat plates. Though the plating of metallic bodies with silver had been well executed, it had not yet been determined that electro-casting of silver could be executed in a desirable manner, and at a, modemte expense and trouble. At first every attempt to make plates weighing 2,500 grains to the square foot failed, on account of the difficulty of observing Mr. Smee's laws relative to the E for the time required. But after rnodif'.ying tlie solutions of silver, and usiug a register battery, a plate could be made in :~o hours, 1ierfectly fiat, and possessing the mechanical qualities of hardness, elasticity, and malleability, in an eminent degree, and not costing over 16 cents per ounce for the making.

The perfectly flat plates admit of a very close approximation to the zincs. Tlieir size may therefore b(i iucreascd to more than twice their former surface. As in the double arrangement, r is relatively smaller to R. Important changes have also been made in the modes of operating, arnl in tlw arrangement of the apparatus. It bad early ueen notieed that changes of ternperatnre infiueneed th(· rat~~ of working; and every electro-metallurgist knows the importance of keepillg· t])e laboratory warm. To determine where and how the cftect of temperature took place, a battf'ry, at 00 degTecs of Fahrenheit, was connected with a wire 120 feet long, and enclosing a gah·anometer. The tleflpction was 40 degrees; the battery was tllen cooled until the temperature was 48 degrees; the needle was still deflected nearly 40 degrees. This experiment indicated that the batteries were not greatly affected by ordinary Yariations of temperature. Advantage was then taken of this de>elopment to secure a more perfect ventilation. Accordiug1y, a small room, to contain the battery, was partitioned off from the general apartment by a glass p:utition, and large outward openings maue at the top and at the bottom of the room, to give a circulation of air for carrying off the batteIJ- fumes. At the stage of improvement now described, one of our me1limn plates, haYing 8 square feet of surface, could he readily made in from 8 to 10 days. But wishing to still further quicken the process, or attain my first desire-to deposit one pound per day on the square foot, "ith a si11glc equivalent of battery-improyements were again sought after. As the E of the fOI"mula lmR been increased to the greatest extent the cost would permit, and r had been diminiRlled, or the plates increased in size to the greatest useful extent, it was sought to increase Q bJ- diminishing r, or the electrolytic resistance. It was sought to increase the conducting power of the electrolyte h.'adding easil~· decornposahle salts to it.; hut with no success. The accelerating effect of temperature being found, as aboye stated, to be confined chiefij' to the decomposition cell, it was evident that by using the electrolyte alone, at a high temperature, a considerable ad,-antag"C· might m11me. 'l'o determine the most ad \·autageons working temperature, aml the resultiug gain of effect, a voltameter batte1'y was connecte,{l to a pair of electrodes, in the solution formerly descrilwt1 as being generally recommended. Each electrode had five square inches of face, :ciml was coated on the back to prevent radiation. They were placed 6He i11ch apart, and had thin plates of wood bound against their ec1gfls, to prevent anj' lateral spread of the current in iiassing hetween them. The following was then obtained: Battery plate in contact gave 300 cubic inches gas per llour. Electrodes in eontact gave 216 cubic inches gas per hour. Current through electrolyte, at 530, gave 16 cubic inches gas Current through electrolyte, at 600, gave 20 cubic inches gas Current through electrolyte, at 1000, gave 27 cubic inches gas Current through electrolyte, at 175°, gaYe 37 cubic inches gas

But as Srnee's Jaws require that, in forming a plate, certain mutual conditions of ap}laratus be maintained, it follows that alterations in one element or condition must be attendc(l by c01Tcspmuling cl1anges in the others. Hence, if the tempemtnre of tiie. electrolyte lle rai~ed to a certain point, and the apparatus correspondingly aqjnsted, it is evident that, to ayoid incessant adjustment, the original temperature must be maintained.

an apparatus for steauil.r maintaining a high temperature in the electrnlyte through several successive days becomes iudispensa ble. As the electrotype operations are not suspended at night, it is important that the heating apparatus should perform its oftice for at least 12 hours without supervision or replenishing its fuel; and its action should be sensibly uniform, during all the time, between successive replenishings. Such an apparatus I have devised, and is now in use. A peck of charcoal furnish~s fuel for 12 hours, and rnaiutains 100 gallons of copper solutions steadily at any rnquirerl point between 1000 and 2000. 'Vith the above arrangement in use, I ha\'e made a large reverse or alto, and returned the original to the engraving department, in 55 hours from its being placed in my hands. This time included trimming the edges and the preparations to prevent adhesion. Again recurring to Ohm's formula, the relative value of H to r was once more experimentally 1 - =0.20, a great improvement as comparell with the first found. This gave R: r : : 1 : 4 or Q = 1+4 determination of R : r : : 1 : 19, or Q _l_ =0.05. Having now made r so small compared with R, 1+19 the size of the battery can be profitably increased until the result is about 0.24. Moreover, using a double arrangement of cells with double surfaces, for a double effect, we now have
2 (

1} 4

)= 2 ! 4 =0.40.

As the relative resistance of the electrolyte becomes now still sma!Ier,

we may yet more increase the battery surface until the result is nearly O·.'J. The electrotype has now ceased to he a mere experiment, uncertain, expensive, and slow. I have lately formed plates of mo8t excellent quality, at the rate of 3 lbs. to the square foot, in 24 hours. This rate will require but two days to form one of our largest plates, ha·dng ten square feet of face, and one-eighth of an inch thick.
ACTIONS IN THE ELECTROLYTIC SOLUTION.

The quality of the deposited metal is governed solely by the relations between the quantity of electricity pas8ing through any solution and the amount of metal the solution contains. The usual supposition is, that the acid of the salt goes to one electrode and the metal to tlie other. It is now ascertained that no such mutual transfer takes place; for, while the acid is carried to the positive electrode, the metal is not carried to the negative electrode. Hence, however strong the solution on commencing the process, the negative electrode, by abstracting the metal in its Yicinity, is soon surrounded with a weak solution. 'Vith a simple wire electrode, the exhausted solution surrounding the electrode is readily renewed by mere diflerence of specific gravity producing a flow· But, with large parallel plate electrodes, this rapid renewal of dense solution becomes impossible, and the electrode is soon surrounded with a weak solution. This state of things must be recognised in adjusting our battery arrangements. Electrotypists not aware of this fact find themselves much perplexed by failing to accomplish with large plates what is so easily done with medall'I or small plate8. It would, at first sight, appear that, by strengthening the solution of sulphate of cop11er, a more rapid suppl~· of metal to the electrode would be obtained. Unfortunately, the effect of this is to diminish the solvent capacity of the water in the solution for the sulphate formed on the positive electrode by the action of the transferred acid. The grand essential in electrolysis is liquidity ill the solution. Thus, if the quantity of free water surrounding the positive electrode be small, this electrode is soon enveloped in a saturated solution, and the newly-formed salt remaim1 undisRolved upon it. This salt, being a non-conductor, virtually excludes the electrode from the solution, and thus arrests the current, except when the efflux of saturated solution permits the salt tlJ diRsolve, and so reopens the passage for the current in irregular quantities. From this spasmodic action re~mu plates of copper-sand, or sometimes copper as soft as le.ad. By applying heat to the solution when this state of things exists, the solYent capacity of the water for the salt is increased, rapid difilision takes place, the salt is carried t,o the negative electrmle, aud the exhausted water to the positive electrode; the dormant batteries rush into uninter·

rnpted action, and in a short time a plate is deposited, having all tile hardness and elasticity of ilammercd or rolled copper. Smee's eouditions, theu, seem to maiutain themselY!·s. The electrotypists' axiom of" work slowly," requires to be re,·ersed into "the quicker tile work, the lJetter the quality."

MA...""\IPULATION.

When a plate is to be electrotyped, it is placed on trestles above the open scuttle holes, h, h, II, It, and thoroughly cleaned by washing with alkalies and acids. It is then silYere(l, iodized, and placed before a window. A plate of rolled copper an inch larger than tlie eugraver1 plate is then selected, placed on the fiat iron table, and beaten with mallets until a steel straight edge sllOws it to be plane. It is then weighed and fixed in the vertical plate frame by two copper hooks. The engraved plate is then similarly fixed in a similar frame, when both are placed in a vertical vat and connected with the batrery. The process does not go on well when the plates are zertical, but it is necessary to start the castings in this position to prevent dust, motes, or specks of impurities from settling on the face. As the rolled plate dissolves, its impurities rapidly render the solution muddy, and endanger the face of the forming plate. For common electrotypes dust or mote specks are not detrimental ; but the Coast Survey copper plates being not inferior in fineness of lines to fine steel plates, the effect of impurities settling on the face of their copies is to give the impressions a clouded appearance. On ftrst immersing the plate, the solution should, therefore, be perfectly clean. Formerly, after . 18

each use of the vertical vat, it was emptied and washed out. VV1:1en the solution hacl deposited its sedime11t it was r1n1iwn off aml strained through very fine cotton. This whole operation was extremely disagreeable, and consumed a whole day of one man. By a simple expedient I have saved the necessity of cleaning the vat oftener than once a month. To guard the new plate from specks and impurities, a bag of fine cotton is clrawn over a slight wooden frame, which keeps it distended. An hour or more before the solution is-,wanted, the bag, with its included frame, is placed on top of the solution and loaded with the copper bars used to support the plate frames. The weight causes the bag to sink gradually, filtering the contained solution as it goes dov.711. The impurities cannot wholly choke the meshes of' the cloth, as a fresh portion is constantly brought into action during the sinking. I thus filter the solution without taking it from the vat or disturbing the sediment, saving much labor, time, and annoyance. The plate remains in the vertical vat owff night, and preparations ·are made in the morning to transfer it to the horizontal vat. The furnace is first brought into action. A new plate of' blank copper, an inch larger than the matrix, is flattened on the iron table, and bolted to the edges of wooden bars by platinum bolts, for the purpose of' preventing the plate from sagging downwards when supported horizontally. The plate so arranged is called the strapped plate. The coated matrix is then taken from the vertical vat, disengaged from its frame, and arranged in the horizontal frame. A wooden wall, an inch high, then surrounds the plate, and in this wall the strapped plate is laid, when t,he whole combination is placed in the horizontal vat ancl the connection with the battery established. The positive plate is then taken from the vertical vat and its loss of weight noted and recorded. From the known superficial area of' the matrix, the quantity of copper required for the casting one-eighth of an inch thick is computed and recorded. The blank copiler consumed in both vats must equal this amount before the required thickness is reached, allowance being made for impurities of rolled copper and roughness on the back of the electrotype. After a few hours of action the strapped plate becomes so loaded with impurities that they will begin to drop on the electrotype ; this plate must, therefore, be removed from the vat and a new one immediately supplied. The dirty plate is then washed in the large water tub, and when cleaned its loss of weight is found and recorded. By the amount of' loss the action of' the batteries is tested, and it is found, if Smee's laws are being observed. Vigilance must now be exercised in watching the batteries and rate of work, and the power must be varied to suit circmnstances. The entire working batte~, generaily requires renewal once a day, the process being conducted as follows: One zinc and one silver plate are taken from the battery; the silver placed in a solution of chloride of iron, and the zinc taken to the water tub outside the door of the battery room, where it is scrubbed clean with a liard brush. It is then re-amalgatecl at the quicksilver tub, and taken back to the battery. The silver plate is transferred from the chloride of iron solution to the adjacent fresh-water tub. Another silver plate is then transferred from the battery to the chloride solution, and another zinc cleaned, washed, and put back in the battery with the first silver. In this manner the whole battery can be renewed without sensibly interrupting its action. When the loss of weight from the rolled copper in both vats indicates that the required thickness of the electrotype is gained, the plate is withdrawn from the battery, <letached from its frame, its back smoothed and its edges-filed until a separation can be made. By separation the original becomes liberated, and the alto or reversed relief is silverecl and electrot;yped exactly as an original. The copy from it, or the electrot.YJmd hm;so, will, if the process bas been properly conducted, be a }lerfect fac-simile of the original, and in hardness, ductility, and elasticity, will equal the best rolled aml hammered or planished copper plate. Yours, respectfo11y, GEORGE MATHIOT. Major I. I. STEVENS, Assi-stant in charge of office.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY.

SUPPLEME:KT TO APPENDIX No. 8.
LENGTH OF THE KENT ISLAND BASE LINE.

Kent island, on which this base line was measured, is situated on the eastern side of Chesapeake bay, nearly op11osite, Annapolis, (see Sketch No. 10.) The line is about :five and a h:tlf miles in length, and was measured in J\Iay and .June, 18±4, hy Asiiistant .Tames Ferguson, with the same apparatus which had been previously used in the measurement of the Fire Island base line, (see Coast Surn\y Report for 1865, Appendix No. 21.) The comparisons of tht> four double-meter bars with the committee meter, by means of Bessel's contact-level comparator, in 1844 and 1845, gave their combined length, or A+ B + C + D, at 32° Fahrenheit, = 7.99!J87Hi5 meten-1, as stated in the account above referred to. The mean temperature of the bars during the measurement was 770.79, and when corrected for graduation error, 'i70.33 Fahrenheit; hence the excess of tempeniture above that of melting ice, 45°.33. The co-efficient of expansion for iron is adopted, as before, at 0.000006963535, and the temperature correction computed accordingly. T1rn cormctim1 to the length of the base for inclination of bars was calculated by means of the tabulated >ersed sines of the observed inclinations. The average elevation of the line above the hal±~tide level of the bay, which cannot sensibly differ from that of the ocean, is found by leveling to be 5.U meters, inclnsini of the height of apparatus. The resulting length of the base is then found as follows:
108u boxes, at 8 meters ..... __ .................................... . Defect of each on 8 meters, or 1086 x 0.00012835 ..... _............... . Correction for expansion of bars, or for excess of temperature ovEJr 320 ..

8688 0.1394 2.7424 1.0007 2.0508 0.0069 8687.5446

To estimate the accuracy of this value we first consider the probable error of the assigned length of the combined bars, derived from their comparison with the standard meter. This is found to be :±:0.00000550. The probable error in 1086 boxes is consequently ::l::0.00597 meter. If we arrange t11e boxes according to rising, stationary, and falling temperatures, we shall :find 457 boxes laid during rising, 150 during falling, and the remainder during stationary temperatures. We have, therefore, 307 uncompensa.ted cases; and supposing again an average of 20 difference between the temperature of the bars and that indicated by the thermometers, (as in the account of the Fire Island base,) the effect would amount t-0 0.0342 meter, which has been adopted as the probable error in the length arising from irn})erfect temperature indications; combining with this the uncertainty from t.Jrn graduation error, or ::l::0.0151, we have the probable error :±:0.0374 meter, arising from the temperature corrections. The probable error arising from the instability of the microscopes, estimated as in the case of the }'ire Island base, cannot exceed ±0.000127 v1086, or ±0.0042 meter. Putting together these three principal probable errors, that of the assigned length of the base becomes v' (0.0374) 2 + (0.0060)2 + (1).0042)2 =±0.0381 meter, equal to ::±: 1.50 inches, or to 22 g1000 of the length ; the corresponding value in the logarithm is ::!:: 19 04,6 in units of the seventh place of decimals. We have, therefore, the following value for the resulting length of the Kent Island base line: 8687.5446 ::±: 0.0381 meters, and itR logarithm, ~.9388970 4 72 + 19 046
