REPORT.

RAGGED MT. ST.ATIOX, NEAR CA.MDEX, MAIXE,

Novernber 22, 1854.

Sm: In conformity with law and the regulations of the Treasury Department, I have the honor to tmbmit a report of the progress of the Coast Survey unuer my
superintendence during the past year. In all the States where the work is not essentially completed, on the coast of the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific, it has, as during the two years last past, и been in progress. I propose to give an account of this progress under the following heads; the same which were used in my report of last year: 1. General statement and remarks. 2. A condensed notice of the progress during the past year, arranged geographically by sections and localities. 3. The estimated progress for the next fiscal year, with the estimates for securing that progress. 4. A detailed account of the work done in the field and afloat between November 1, 1853, and the same date in 1854, classed according to sections, corresponding with the programme of divisions of the coast, and arranged according to the different operations. The work of each officer is there noticed, and the statistics as reported by him. A brief summary of the work in the several sections precedes the details. 5. The office-work is next stated in the order of its different parts. 6. The appendix contains lists, reports, and other data referred to in the body of the report, classified under general heads. 7. Sketches showing the progress of the survey in the several sections, and subsketches where more detail is necessary, lettered from A onward, accompany the reports; those of the same section bearing the same letter, and the successive sketches in each section being numbered. Sketches of important parts of the coast, harbors, channels, shoals, roc1.. ""S, and ledges, of sites for light.houses, and diagrams of tides and currents, are given under the sections to which they belong, and designated by the letter of the section. Diagrams of the Gulf Stream, general tidal results, and miscellaneous matters, have a special letter. 8. In addition to the tables of contents of the report and appendix and list of sketches, is an alphabetical index. '.fhe first condensed statement of the progress of the survey seems necessary to brmg the whole of it under examination in a body. It aims at giving a general idea of what the year's operations have accomplished, as introductory to the prop~sed progress f~r ~he next fiscal year, which accompanies the estimates, determmes them, and 1s, m turn, determined by the appropriations.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Such a statement as t11is, though sufficient for purposes of general examination, necessarily excludes details in regard to places and persons >vhich are nevertheless essential to the full history of the work. The details follow in >vhich each operation is treated under the head of the section of the coast to which it belongs, under the subdiYisions relating to the particular operation, and with the name of the officer executing it attached. It is due to the arduous character of the service that the labors of each should find a place in the report; and it serves to define and limit responsibility, so that no one may bear the burden of another. The sections form so many chapters, as it were, of greater or less size, determined by the extent of the operations conducted in them. severally, or rather by the notice of them. The prefatory remarks to each section give, in a general way, what has been accomplished during the year. They are more detailed than the very brief statement in the first part of the report; serve to show what arc the prominent points in the succeeding account, as well as to give a connected view of it. The office-work relating to the section is also presented in a brief way in the introductory remarks. A detailed account of the office-work presents the advantages referred to as belonging to that of each section, a11d shows how, from year to year, the results of the smTey are carried through their different forms until they appear in its publications. The sketches are of two classes-one showing the progress of each operation by convm-.tional signs, explained on the face of the sketch ; the other giving some special result of practical or scientific interest, as the chart of a harbor, sketch of a shoal or channel, or a tidal or current diagram. In the second class are brought out immediately, usually without attempt at finish, some of the more important results of the surveying year. '.L'he appendix to the report at first contained only a few lists and reports referred to in the body of the document; but it has been found desirable to place in it some of the results of the survey in a preliminary form-reports which are made from time to time on field operations, or in the office ; discussions of 8cientific matters 1elonging to the 8nrvey, of matters relating to navigation, and accessories to navigation and commerce ; table;; of theoretical and practical results~ and offici~l lists and communications. These are so classified that the reader can choose or omit the division in which he does or does not find the subject he wishes to examine. The large distribution made of the report by Congress thus conveys to those interested in commerce and navigation, and the applied sciences, some of the immediate results of the survey. The chain of triangulation of the Coast Survey now extends, with a single broken link of fifteen miles, from Penobscot bay, in Maine, to Bogue sound, in North Carolina. South of this it crosses Cape Fear entrance, and passes up the river to Wilmington; includes Winyah bay and Georgetown harbor, and the coast from the Ashley river to St. Helena sound, Calibogue sound and the Savannah river to the head of Argyle island and St. и Tohn's river entrance; connects the Florida reefs and keys from Cape Florida t? Key Rodriguez, and from the Pine islands to Key West; extends from Crystal river offing to Cedar Keys, inclusive, on the Western coast of the Florida peninsula, over Ocilla river entrance; connects .Mobile with New Orleans, and passes from 11obile to the Gulf and across Mississippi sound, and through Lake Borgne and Lake Pontchartrain, to New Orleans; includes Galveston lower and upper bays, and cast and west bays, and the coast to the head of Matagorda. bay, and covers the entrance of the Rio Bravo del Norte. In some cases the main triangulation leads, and in others follows, affording first or last the check which the minor work requires. It rests upon carefully-measured bases, which, when united, serve as bases of verification. A preliminary triangulation is made whenever a specially important locality requires survey out of the regular course, and is

01" THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 18G4.

brought subsequently into the general scheme. "Cpon this series of points, determined by the triangulation, the plane-table surveys rest, furnishing the shore-line and details of topography, aml with th~se the hydrography is readily an<l accuratdy executed. It gives the soundings, pointing out shoals and rocks to be avoided, and channels to be followed, the set and drift of currents, and the rise and fall of tides. It would be difficult to find a country which presents a greater variety in the coast to which different plans of survey should be adapted, or more varied features in the oceans which wash it, in all their relations of depth, of current, and of tide. The land-work finds its most interesting applications among the hills and mountains of the eastern coast, and on the islands and adjacent main of the Gulf of Mexico, and the hydrography in that remarkable stream which connects the Gulf of Mexico with the northern seas, in exploring the shoals and depths of the great gulf in which it has its source, and the depths and shoals of the north and east whence return is made for its flow. It might at first be supposed that in the beaten tracks of commerce and navigation, such a survey had merely to map down accurately and laboriously what was before imperfectly known and carelessly traced. But even the approaches to our great marts of commerce have not failed to yield actual discoveries, or developments so near akin to them that it is difficult to draw the line between them. Gedney's channel, off New York, has associated the name of that veteran hydrographer with discovery in the most frequented port of the Gnion. Blake's channel, in the Delaware; Davis' shoal and Davis' Bank, near Nantucket; Ste11wagen's Bank, at the entrance of .Massachusetts bay; Almy's shoal, off Cape Cha,rles; Jenkins' channel, across Cape Fear shoals; Maffit's channel, at Charleston, and Rodgers' channel, at Key West, have connected their skill and patient research with the most thronged routes and customary approaches. The pilot or navigator follows the middle way without seeking to the right or to the left, sounding only when necessity requires, his object being to carry his siugle vessel into port ; the surveyor explores the entire approach, carrying his vessel into places deemed both safe and unsafe, that he may develop their facilities or discover their dangers. During the past year, though we have felt, in common with all who have had limited means to expend and considerable results to produce, the effect of the increase of prices of every sort, the survey has, in most of the sections, presented a fair degree of progress-not what under other circumstances it would have done, but as much as could justly be expected under those which it has had to encounter. The estimates which, under a former statement of things, would have carried us forward at the rate of nearly one-tenth of the remaining work during the year, could not ~ccomplish as much when labor and supplie8 of every sort had so much increased m money value. The consequence of this I have presented to the Treasury Department, and, with the approval of its head, will also point out in a subsequent p~rt of this report. If it were desirable to dwell upon the dark side of the year's picture, I could draw abundantly from the reports of the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coast, ~nd in part from personal experience, narratives of disappointments from fogs, wmds, and fires, disasters from hurricanes, from fever and from cholera-all encountered from the necessity of the case, the parties having used all the means of success which human care and foresight suggested; but it is more pleasant, as well as profitable, leaving these behind, to show the real, substantial progress which has be~n made, and, besides that, to connect with it the names of the persons ?Y whom it ~as been achieved. A rapid glance at the list of distribution of parties (ApI_>end1x _No. 1) will give a generttl view of the field-work; and a similar one at the hsts which follow it, (Appendix: No. 31) of the office-work.

6

REPORT OF THE SUFERINTENDENT

The names of ofl1cers of the army attached to the survey on the 1st of September, 1854, is given in Appendix No. 2 ln's. The number was one greater than that 01i the same date of the previous year, and includes three officers from the Corps of Engineers, two from the Topographical Engineers, and nine from the line of the army. Notice has been given of the intention to relieve four of the officers whose names appear in the list, which will take four of the most experienced from the work. This rotation, though rapid, is not such as to cripple the efficiency of the details. Three officers whose names do not appear on the list, have been detailed and relieved within the year. During the past year, the efficiency of the hydrography has been considerably increased. by the favorable action of the enlightened head of the Navy Department. '.l'he want of officers in the naval service has, however, pressed heavily upon us, and until the act of Congress took cffcct relating to the pay of seamen, there was very great difficulty in filling up the number allowed with even very indifferent men, and desertions were so frequent as to be a serious drawback upon the parties. The item of transportation has borne heavily upon our funds, being no longer paid by the Navy Department, and officers being sometimes ordered for Rhort periods only, to our parties, from considerable distances. It must be borne in mind that, asи we arc inflexibly limited to special amounts, every item of expense of this sort has to be paid for in loss of work. I doubt not that the present system, which still bears the impress of the past, can ultimately be more favorably arranged between the two departments, both having the same object-the good of the public service. It will be seen that the number of sea-officers attached to the Coast Survey September 1, 1853, has been reduced from sixty-one to fifty-iive; that twenty-four or forty per cent. of the number in 1853, and forty-four per cent. of the present number, have thus been changed during the year, making nearly the half of each party to conHist of ofllcers new to the work and to be instructed before they can become efficient. Besides the fifty-five sea-officers on the first of September, there were ten naval engineers attached to the Coast Survey steamers. The number on September I, 1853, was thirteen. In this introductory part of my report, in presenting some of the principal developments and discoveries of the year, it is proper to observe that the line which separates these, though in some cases well marked, in others would be with great difficulty drawn. The determination of the exact depth upon a shoal, and its precise length and breadth, might be as important as the discovery of its existence. The development of the law of the tides at a port where they were unknown before, especially if some seeming irregularity, perplexing to the navigator, were explained by them, is hardly less important. So the determination, in a corrected form, of the set and drift of the tidal current, from a series of observations, borders on discovery. Again: it is difficult always to establish a discovery as such on a frequented coast, beyond all cavil. Nothing may exist in relation to a иshoal or channel in print, but the tradition of pilots and :fishermen may assert that one exists in a locality without knowing its precise position. A vessel touched upon the shoal ; a fisherman plied his line upon the bank; a vessel under stress of weather passed through the channel; but the position of the vessel or fisherman's boat is not known. There may even be dim indications upon an old chart, by the rude conventional signs that cover sometimes so much space, that a shoal is supposed to exist, and yet for all purposes of navigation, in these several cases, the placing of that shoal may be as valuable as a discovery-indeed, may be considered as such; and in sifting the evidence it will be difficult to say that it is or is not such, so many minute circumstances must be weighed. By classing developments and discoveries together, the attempt to discriminate the nicer shades is avoided, and things of like importance

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SI;RVEY FOR 18!14.

7

are presented with like prominence. When after examination the claim to discovery is deemed to be established, a name is given to the shoal, rock, or channel, and usually that of the discoverer. In the case of Stellwagen's Bank, after finding it in the regular progress of surveying, and traversing it by lines of soundings, Lieutenant Commanding Stcllwagcn proceeded to inquire if it was known, and submitted to me the evidence, detailed under the head of hydrography of Section I, and in Appendix No. 9. The bank was not on the most approved charts, though on a chart of less authority, one or two soundings, by shifting their places somewhat, might belong to it. A "middle ground" was supposed by the tradition of fishermen to be somewhere at the entrance, but parties desirous of fishing upon it have failed to find it. A shoal was inserted in a chart of one year and discarded in that of the next, or its position and name changed, showing a want of definite knowledge even of its existence. The best authorities rejected it altogether. As a mark for vessels entering Massachusetts bay, its value is so great that, had its existence been knmvn with certainty, it would have been duly pointed out in the accredited publications. Finally, it hall no definite name, and l have therefore given it that of its discoverer, Lieutenant Commanding Stellwagen. The following is a list of the developments and discoveries of the past year. A similar list, in continuation of one in my lust year's report, including the period from the beginning of the work to the end of the present year, is placed in Appendix No. 8. 1. Determination of the dimensions of Alden's Rock, near Cape Elizabeth, Maine. 2. A bank (Stellwagen's Bank,) with ten and a half to fourteen and a half fathoms of water on it, at the entrance of l\fassachusetts bay, and serving as an important mark for approaching Boston and other harbors. 3. A dangerous sunken ledge, (Davis' ledge,) to the eastward and in the neighborhood of Minot's ledge. 4. Several rocks in the fair channel way, in Boston harbor entrance. 5. The tidal currents of Nantucket shoals and the approaches. 6. The tidal currents of Long Island Sound. 7. The changes in New York harbor, near the city, between 1845 and 1854. 8. The general permanence of the Bodkin channel, and shoals in its vicinity, at the entrance of the Patapsco river, between 1844 and 1854. 9. A shoal (New Point shoal) in Chesapeake bay, with sixteen feet water on it, SE. from New Point Comfort light-house, off .Mobjack bay. 10. A reconnaissance of the Wimble shoals, near Nag's Head, coast of North Carolina. 11. The general permanence in depth on the bar of Beaufort, North Carolina, with the change of position of the channel. 12. The changes in Maffitt's channel, Charleston harbor, South Carolina, from 1852 to 1854. 13. A harbor of refuge, (Turtle harbor,) to the northward and westward of Garysfort light-house, Florida reef, with a depth of water of twenty-six feet at the entrance. 14. A safe rule for crossing the Florida reef near Indian key. 15. Co-tidal lines for the Atlantic coast of the United States. 16. An increase of depth of water on the bar at Pass Fourchon, Louisiana. 17. A s~oal at the entrance to the straits of Rosario, Washington Territory, giving . good ho~dmg-ground ~n thirty-three feet. 18. Tides of San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

No special discussion of the value of the different particulars of the foregoing list is necessary, but a few remarks may be desirable. \Yhile the first, Stellwagen's Bank, shows the naYigator what to look for, the second shows what he should avoid. In entering Massachusetts bay, a broad bank, three to five miles wide, with ten and a half to fourteen and a half fathoms water on it, and deep water on each side, is an excellent mark, especially as it stretches for fifteen miles in length, so that a moderately accumte knowledge of position would enable the navigator to sound on it. The precept for entering Doston harbor from the south is to clear Davis' and .Minot's ledges, and for this a special range is given. Almy's shoal is of interest to those navigating the lower part of Chesapeake bay in vessels of considerable draught. The development in regard to the Patapsco entrance may have an important bearing upon the improvements undertaken there by the city of Baltimore. The small decrease of depth at Beaufort, North Carolina, under the very different positions of the channel, is not only locally important, but is instructive in its contrast with other harl.iors on the same coast, and the cause is deserving of careful study for its general bearing. It is attributed, by some, to the protection of Cape Lookout; by otherrs, to the fact that no considerable rivers empty into Beaufort harbor, and that it is almost simply an estuary, into and out of which the waters of the ocean flow. These causes lead to widely ditlerent inferences. The changes in :Maffitt's channel have been actually made the basis of a change of plan in its improvement, and too much stress cannot, therefore, be laid upon the value of their minute and careful determination. This is the channel which has been decided by the common consent of all professional men who have examined it, to give the best hope of ready improvement of the entrance to Charleston harbor. The harbor of refuge inside of the Florida reef, and the rule of entering at Indian Key, will do much to assist navigators at that part of the reef; and when the harbor is marked as proposed, and the signals along the reef established, great facilities will exist for using the inside passage, and the present route of navigation may, and probably will, be much changed. The general discussion of the currents of Long Island sound will explain, for the first time, some points which have much perplexed casual observers, and give definite ideas of the general set and drift of the tidal currents. The rule which gives a safe distance from the Nantucket shoals in a calm, is a curious instance of a practical precept, coming from what, at first sight, seems to be a pure speculation. The generalizing of the facts there, as to the direction of the current compared with that of the shoal, its velocity, with the distance from the land, and the drawing of lines, along which the current changes at the same time, must prove very useful to the navigator who will study it. The subject is not yet finally developed, and perhaps has not assumed its most simple form ; but enough has been done to warrant its presentation as a contribution of marked interest. The connection of the tidal current directly with the moon's motion, instead of with the tide, is an innovation which may not be approved, and yet, after consulting hydrographers, the balance for and against that mode of presenting the subject was nearly at an equipoise. It is easy, if the plan does not prove generally acceptable, to recur to the former. In justice to the merit of the paper on this subject, I have presented it without change. The tidal discussions will, as they find their way among nautical men, give precise ideas, instead of the crude ones which casual observation has furnished, and will ultimately form the basis of prediction tables for the principal ports, which will replace the very ruugh approximations now in use, and finally bring the predictions as near to the occurrence as the nature of the disturbing cause of wind and weather will allow; that is, will make them accord with precision, on the average. In a scientific point of view, these generalizations are also of considerable value ; a high authority has already

OF TIIE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY

pronounced this to be the case. The great Atlantic tide-wave, in rcac.:hing- our comparatively shoal ALlautic shores, appears to be modifiecl liy them su that the co-tidal lines take their shape. Of the developments on the \Y cstern coast, the most important yet rcrorted seem to be, the existence of the shoal at the entrance of the strait of San Hosario, two rocks in San Rosario strait and one in the Canal de Haro, and a five-fathom bank in the straits of Juan <le Fu ca. In regard to the W estcrn coast, we claim to have clone much work there in a short time, and to have adapted it to the special wants and rapid growth of the country; beginning with a general reconnaissance from San Diego to the Col umи bia river, following this up with preliminary charts of the bays and harbors, and anchorages, as commerce directed itself towards them, meanwhile revising the reconnaissance and making it more complete; substituting prdiminary surveys of the more important harbors for general reconnaissances; filling in ihe surveys of minor ports and anchorages, and extending the work northward, while carrying on the regular operations at and near the central harbor of the coast ; and furnishing topographical surveys of the sites of light-houses, and examinations needed for their location. A list of the surveys of various grades made in California, Oregon and vVashington Territories, fifty-four in number, is in the Appendix Ko. 6. 'l'hc difficulties with which the survey, especially in its introduction upon the V\. estern coast, had to contend, will probably excuse the few omissions with which it may Le charged . .My report of 1851 contained a list of geographical positions determined from preliminary computations, an<l that of last year an additional list for two years. As supplementary to this, will be found in the present report the no less important list of magnetic declinations or variations. The results obtained in the course of the survey are collected in Appendix No. 7. The local irregularities are such as careful examination has shown to result generally from the nature of the phenomena. Considerable pains have been taken in several localities, where there was a marked deviation from the variation which belonged to the geographical position, to verify the observations, and in others by examining various adjacent spots to find some one which would give normal results. The usual errors of observation with the instrument employed, especially where the azimuths have been determined by those of the sides of the triangles, arc much less than the local magnetic deviations. The full discussion of these results, as well as of the interesting elements 01 ~h~ dip and horizontal intensity, obtained, usually, at the same time as th0 variation, is m progress. At some of the principal magnetic stations, where it has been requested, meridian marks have been placed for the use of surveyors. The tide tables presented with the report of last year have been improved by the addition of new observations, and by the progress of the reduction of the old ones. I give them in their new form in Appendb:: No. 51. The mean establishments of some of our principal ports on the Atlantic, Gulf of .Mexico, and Pacific, are stated, by which the navigator can determine the time of high water from the tables of the moon's transit, the Nautical Almanac. The mean rise and fall of the tide, and the rise and fall for spring and neap tides, are also given; and the duration of ebb and flood tide, and of slack water. The establishment or interval between the time of moon's transit and the time of high water, varying during the lunar month, as well as the rise and fall, the values corresponding to different ages of the moon, ar~ given for some of the principal ports in the list, in a second series of tables, which the time of high and low water, and the height, can be more. closely determmed than by the first approximation. For convenience, the establishment

REPORT OF TIIE SUPERINTENDENT

at each age is placed in the table, instead of the change of the quantity, and a table of heights is furnished, in which the number to be applied to the soundings upon a chart is denoted, to give the depth at high water, where the soundings upon the chart are reduced to mean low water, and when reduced to low-water ripring tides; corresponding numbers are given for low water. When the diurnal irregularity or difference of height and time between the a. m. and p. m. tides is large, as at Key West ancl San Francisco, and other ports on the Western coast, tables of correction for the previous establishment are given. The tidal data for the places on the Gulf of Mexico where simgle-day tides prevail, are given as far as the discussion bas advanced. The tides at Aransas Pass and the Brazos St. Iago have been added to this class by the observations of the past year. The manner in which the results of observations in the triangulation were to be reduced, was a subject which early occupied my attention; and to which some of the best efforts of .M.r. Hilgard, chief of the computing division of the Coast Survey, were directed. It is well known that there are two principal methods of deducing the value of the angles observed in a triangulation: one by the adjustment of the remaining small and incidental discrepancies in the angular quantities directly measured; the other by the adjustment of similar discrepancies in the several directions diverging from a station-the former equating angular spaces, the latter directions; and both are treated by the method well known to mathematicians as that of "least squares." The results or conditions are afterwards subject to a second set of conditions, namely: those resulting from the geometrical relations in the figure of the triangulation with the application of the same method of least squares. The primary triangulation in Section I has been treated by both these methods, and the parallel between them carried as far as the stations near Portland; including a sufficient number of cases to determine the method to be adopted in the entire work. The details of this investigation are of course quite technical, and will be given in full in the volume of records and results of the Coast Survey. An abstract of the labors of Mr. Hilgard and of Mr. Schott, in the computing division, is given in the Appendix No. 33, in sufficient detail to enable the result to be followed by those familiar with the methods, who will be gratified to see the scale preponderating in favor of the adoption of the method of equating directions, to which the nature of the observations conforms most closely. Probably the most elaborate series of observations and experiments yet made on the measurement of heights by different methods, was that by Captain T. J. Cram, U. S. Topographical Engineers, and assistant in the Coast Survey, in 1852 and 1853; including not only the differences of level of the usual Coast Survey stations, but extending to the height of Mount W 8.ihington. The object was to compare, once for all, the different modes of measuring heights, especially those most conveniently applicable to our work. These were by the spirit-level, by zenith distances or reciprocal vertical angles, and by the barometer, to which the boiling apparatus was added as involving only a moderate addition of labor a.nd giving useful results. The stations were selected so as to afford different varieties in the use of the methods, and especially in the one by reciprocal zenith distances, in which I availed myself, in giving instructions, of the experience of our measurements to indicate the different circumstances which vary the refraction. One important result expected, was the determination of the co-efficient of vertical refraction under the different circumstances occurring in our usual observations. Since closing his operations in the autumn of 1853, Captain Cram has been engaged in reducing his observations1 and has presented reports upon the method

OF TIIE UNITED ST A.TES CO.AST SURVEY FOR 1854.

11

by levelling, by the barometer, and by the boiling-point, and is now cngap_-ed in the much more laborious reduction and comparison of his results by zenith clistauces. The data for difference of longitude between the stations of the Coast Survey and their connection with European observatories, and especially with Greenwich, to which our navigating longitudes are referred, ha,-e been added from year to year. Astronomical observations have been multiplied, and the theories upon which their use depends have been discussed; the telegraphic method which was used first in the Gnited States for obtaining the difference of longitude between stations has been steadily followed up, and chronometers have been transported between the observatories of Cambridge and Liverpool. In the chronometer plan we Legan by using the chronometers of the Cunard steamers which were on this side of the Atlantic, under the charge of \Y m. Cranch Bond, esq., the director of the Cambridge observatory; and having gone as far in the approximation as this mode permitted, we next organized special chronometer expeditions, in which the experience acquired in one was used in arranging the details of the others. These were under Mr. Bond's immediate direction, with the full co-operation of Mr. Hartnup, the director of the Liverpool observatory. The observations during the ten expeditions of 1849, 1850, and 1851, have been reduced by George P. Bond, esq. ; the investigation of the probable errors of the different determinatiorn; forming the basis of his work, and rising from this through the different details to the general resulting longitude. There is found a difference in the results shown by the voyages from Cambridge to Liverpool, and by the return voyages, which in the necessary absence of sea-rates leaves an uncertainty, traceable with some probability, as Mr. Bond has shown, to the different temperatures to which the chronometers are exposed at sea and on shore, in connection with the known fact that even those compensated for such changes do, notwithstanding, alter their rates at temperatures either above or below the point at which this compensation is made perfect. This remains for investigation, but it is a great point gained to have arrived at the difference Qf longitude as nearly as given in these results, say within the nearest second of time. A brief abstract of his work is given by .Mr. Bond, (Appendix No. 42,) and the entire work will be published in the volume of records and results of the Coast Survey. The intermediate place which this determination takes between the discrepant longitudes given by the two principal astronomical methods, adds to its importance. The observations for telegraphic difference of longitude have been pushed forward with increasing difficulties in passing southward. The progress made and the difficulties met with are ably stated in Dr. Gould's report, in the Appendix"No. 41. The discussion of these difficulties may call the attention of scientific men to their removal. Interesting incidental observations on the effect of distant electrical discharges in producing a current in the telegraphic wire are reported. A brief notice is also given of the observations which had reached us up to the beginning of November, for telegraphic differences of longitude abroad. Appended to Dr. Gould's report is a very lucid notice of the remarkable paper of Professor Peirce on a criterion for the rejection of doubtful observations, with a most valuable set of tables for the application of the method, placing it within the ready reach of the observer and computer. The solar eclipse of .May 26, 1854, was-observed as bearing upon the longitude p~ob~e"?1, at the Coast Survey stations at Washington, D. C., and near Petersburg, Virgm1a. ~e were also prepared to observe near the central line of .the annular eclipse at .M:ount Washino-ton b , New Hampshire , and Agиamenticus, Marne, . but t he weath er was unfavorable; this reason also rendered the preparat10n at the Wilmington (North Carolina) station of no avail. On the иwestern coast

several series of observations were mack near San Fr~mcisco by our parties, awl one at Hmnbolat. At Monterey the weather was cloudy. Notice of these observations will be found under the head of the several seetious, nnJ the reported results in Appendix Ko. 40. Moon culnminations were also obsen-ed at the usual stations for the snney, and will be found notieed under the head of astronomical work in the several Rections. Professor Peirce has continued his investigation in reference to longitudes, and has thoroughly discussed the subject of moon culminations, and with results for whieh mathematieians and astronomers were probably quite unprepared. I give his lcnrned report of progress in full in Appendix No. 3G, ns well for the immediate results as for the light which it sheds upon the important subject of probable errors in methods and observations. The observations and discussion necessary to develop the local or general phenomena o▒ the tides of our coast have maintained steady progress. The additional obsel'nttions made during the year are stated in the Appendix Xo. 31, and the results of the labor of Mr. PourttLles, chief of the tida1 division, and of those associated with him, are, many of them, recorded in the tables of Appendix No. 51, and in my discussions, Kos. 45 a,nd 46. Tables for predicting the time of high and low water at the prineipal ports, are in preparation from the lists of Appendix No. 51, and other tahles of a less simple character, derived from the observations and from theories checked by them. The navigator ca,n use those now given, with confidence in the general accuracy of his deductions from them. The sketch of co-tidal lines (Appendix Ko. 45, and Sketch No. 26) will enable him to know how the tide table is to be applied to places not named in the list, and with what changes of time. Since my last report, the tidal observations on the vY cstern coast, under the direction of Lieutenant иw. P. Trowbridge, of the Corps of Engineers, have come in, and the results from the three permanent self-registering gauges at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, have been compared. The same large difference of height between the morning and afternoon high waters or low waters of the same day, shows itself at eaeh of these places; and the con-esponding inequality in time is also very large. The laws and amount of the inequality known as "diurnal inequality," are traced in the paper Appendix No. 46. The curves representing the rise and fall at the three places just named, (Sketch J, No. 49,) show, by the long and short branches, the phenomena of height iu a very striking point of view, :md it is only nece~ary to suppose a rock just covered by the higher branch of high water, to sec what would occur when the lower branch should succeed the first. A rock hare by' several feet at the lowest low water, might be a snare to the unwary at the highest one. I have already noticed, in some detail 1 the interesting papers of Charles A. Schott, csq., of the computing division of the Coast Survey Office, on the tidal currents of Kantucket shoals and Long Island sound. (Appendix, Nos. 48 and -50.) That of Muskeget channel (Appendix No. 49) is of the same character, but with a less field for original or striking deduction. It does not yield much to the others in utility, showing, in a connected form, the direction and velocity of the current in that somewhat intricate channel, which the navigator may expect to meet at different times of the tide. My paper on the distribution of temperature in the Gulf Stream (Appendix No. 47) contains the results of careful comparison of the observations following the path pointed out by my first deductions, with the intelligent assistance of Professor A. G. Pendleton. The divisions of the stream are laid down according to the latest discussions of the observations; and the curve of temperature with depth, the curve of equal temperature across the stream at different depths, the curve of temperaи

ture at the same depth, and the configuration of the bottom of the sea, on certain scl'tions, are presented from the mature reduction of the obserYations. Among the instruments of every-day use in our иwork, to which much ingenuity has been applied, is that for bringing up specimens of the bottom of the sea. The use of Stellwagen's lead is common in all our parties, antl the apparatus meets иwith general approval. Lieut. Uomg. Craven has invented a box for bringing up deep-sea specimens while running lines, which is convenient and efficacious. The description, in Appendix Ko. 54, is brief, and the principle is there clearly explained. To the same officer we owe an adaptation of Massey's lead to very deep soundings, which is in the highest degree important, and the use of which has served to bring out in bold relief the imperfection of the ordinary sounding-line when thus applied. Lieut Comg. Craven has also made an instrument for measи uring the set and drift of submarine currents, which he is engaged in perfecting by experiment. In this connection I should mention, also, the ingenious syphon tide-gauge of Lieut. Comg. Stcllwagen, a model of which he has successfully tried, arnl which he is now authorized to put up on the full scale for a regular working trial. The simple and very efficient tide-gauge of Mr. Henry Mitchell for outside stations in a rough sea-way, has been tested by the experience of the summer and autumn, outside of the island of Kantucket. Assistant J. E. Hilgard has perfected an instrument for signals by reflection of a beam from the sun, turned by the wind, simf>le and apparently effective; it will, in the course of the next season, be more fully tried than has yet b('en practicable. A description of it will be found under the head of the primary triangulation in Section VllL A small transit instrument which, with adequate magnifying power, should yet be portable, has been quite a desideratum. иw. "\Yunleman, formerly mechanician in the Coast Survey, has supplied us with such an instrument, which has been used in the geographical determinations on the Western coast, by Assistant G. Davidson, with entire success. The discussion of Mr. Davidson's observations has shmvn (Appendix No. 39) that the probable error in the correction of the clock time, determined by one star, is less than one-tenth of a second of time. In many easel> discussed, the instrument was set up and used on the same night. Among the subjects to which I gave consideraLle attention soon after taking charge of the Coast Survey, was the construction of apparatus for measuring bases, which should b& invariable in length at different temperatures and during changes of temperature, in which the level of contact should be applied in measuring, and which should be portable and capable of being used with rapidity. In this I was assisted by Wm. Wurdeman, esq., the able meehanician of the Coast Survey, to whom many of the details of construction of the apparatus finally made are due. !his has been used in the measurement of bases at Dauphine island, 184G, at Dodies ISland, 1848, and at Edisto island, 1850. Notice of it has been given in my reports; ~ut_ the publications in regard to other instruments of the same sort seeming to 1~d1cate that this was not sufficiently known, a description l1as been prepared by I.lent. E. B. Hunt, Corps of Engineers, and read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This description has been placed in Appendix No. 35, ai~d ~rawings illustrating it are shown in Sketch A, No. M. The applicatio11 of the prmmples of specific heat and conducting power to determine the relative ma~scs of the. measuring bars, so that they should heat and cool together, wa:,;, 1 believe, new m this application when made, and I know that it originated in researches undertaken by me, and in part executed in Philadelphia, rnauy years since.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

It is sufficiently understood that the :field-work of every party in the Coast Survey requires a corresponding kind and amount of office-work, and a general brief statement of that executed by the several field parties is given in connection with these operations. The results pass, also, to the office of the Coast Survey for recomputation, discussion, and combination, in a systematic form. The development of the office has been gradual as the survey has advanced, and a constant effort has been made to adjust the field and office work to each other, and the duties of the several divisions of the office among themselves. The office, under Captain H. l:V. Benham, of the Corps of Engineers, has maintained its efficiency, as will be shown by examining the results produced in a subsequent part of this report, and by the reports of the several divisions contained in the Appendix No. 31. I have already referred to the labors of the computing and tidal divisions. The progress of the drawing division will be seen by refering to the Appendix No. 31 1 where a list of the maps, charts, and sketches, seventy-eight in number, executed during the year, will be found. It will be seen that the drawing keeps close to the field-work, producing the results first in sketches and preliminary charts, and then in the finished maps and charts. A description of the Congress map, which will be presented with this report, will be found in Appendix No. 32. A useful branch of labor consists in comparative maps, showing the changes of those portions of our coast which are liable to special alteration, from which the improvement of its harbors is best to be studied. The engra~ng report (Appcndi..'>: No. 31) will be found to contain the following lists of all the maps, charts, and sketches heretofore published, or in progress of engraving, arranged under three heads : 1st. List of maps and charts engraved, thirty-eight in number; 2d. List of preliminary charts and sketches, one hundred and twenty-five in number, the two subdivisions forming together the matter which has been engraved up to the 1st of November, 1854, consisting of one hundred and sixty-three maps, charts, and sketches; 3d. List of maps and charts in progress of engraving, thirty-one in number. To show the progress during the year, we have, 4th, a list of the plates which were in progress at the date of the last report, numbering twenty-eight; 5th. A list of plates commenced during the year, thirty-six in number, making, with the former, sixty-four; and, 6th. A list of plates finished during the year, including the progress sketches, fifty-seven, and omitting them in the enumeration, forty-three in number. Without counting the progress sketches, there are nineteen plates in hand. One hundred and eighty maps and charts, preliminary or finished, and sketches, are now in progress, or have been published.. A complete list of them is given in Appendix No. 31, showing that one hundred and forty-nine are engraved, and thirty-one are engraving. The maps and sketches which have been drawn, and in part engraved, and which will be completed for publication with this report, are fifty-eight in number. The smaller sketches have, as far as practicable, been grouped together to economize in their printing; hence several subject~ are included under one head, in giving the number of them. The maps and sketches of localities in the several sections arc marked from A to K, inclusive; those in Section I being designated as A, those in Section II as B, and so on. The sketch showing the progress of the operations of the survey in the section, is designated as No. 1; and where there are several maps or sketches in a section, they are numbered consecutively, as A No. 1, A No. 2, and so on. The miscellaneous diagrams are lettered.

HEPORT OF THE SUPEHINTENDENT

The organization and development of the engraving division of the Coast Survey Office has been studied carefully at different times, an cl the experience of many different minds has been brought to bear upon the general arrangements and upon the details.. It has grown up gradually; and though, from want of time to record the successive stages of growth, some of the experience has been lost, yet enough remains to make a general view of the division, of interest to those who regard the progress of map engraving in the country, and especially to those interested in the results of the Coast Survey. I have therefore requested Lieut. E. B. Hunt, of the Corps of Engineers, who was recently for a time in charge of the division, to give an account of it, which is inserted in the Appendix No. 57. It shows how the division is organized; briefly, how it has attained its present form; the administration of it; its reference to engraving as a branch of high art, and as a technical art; and the training school for engravers which the office furnishes. The steady progress of the electrotyping division, and the many interesting experiments in which }fr. :Mathiot is engaged to substitute heliography and electrometallurgy for engraving, will be found under the office head in the body of my report, and in Appendix Ko. 31. Some years since, Mr. Mathiot made a valuable contribution to electrical applications by the invention of a self-sustaining voltaic battery, at once simple in construe . tion and effective in sustaining a constant action for long periods of time without requiring the renewal of the materials employed. He has kindly furnished a detailed description of the principles and working of this battery for the Appendix to the present report, (Appendix No. 56 1 ) thus placing it within reach of the electrician and telegrapher for scientific or practical uses. Sixty-eight calls for information from the archives have been answered, a.s shown by the list in the Appendix No. 5. Of these, twenty-eight were from departments of the government; thirty-seven from individuals or associations; and three from local authorities. By the regulations of the Treasury Department a special application is necessary to procure this information, and the survey is not to be put to expense iu communicating it. Upon these liberal terms, the archives are rendered useful to individuals and the public in a great variety of ways, and by very different channels. The assistance rendered to compilers of State, county, and local maps-to hydrographers, geographers, and statisticians, has been very considerable in amount, and is one of the advantages of the work to the public generally, not directly connected with commerce or navigation. When information is obtained which is deemed of sufficient interest to navigators to require immediate publication, a report is made at once to the Secretary of the Treasury, and authority askecl to give publicity to it. In this way 1 during the past year, the following announcements have been made: 1. Stellwagcn's Dank, in the entrance of Massachusetts bay. 2. Davis's leclge, off the Minot's, Massachusetts bay. 3. Determination of rocks near the entrance of Boston harbor. 4. New Point Comfort shoal and York Spit, Chesapeake bay. 5. Reconnaissance of Wimble shoals, North Carolina. G. The langitude of Cape Florida. 7. Turtle harbor, near Carysfort reef, Florida. 8. A safe rule for crossing the Florida reef at Indian key. 9. Three-fathom shoal in Garden Key channel, Tortugas, Florida. 10. Non-existence of a shoal south of the Belize, in latitude 27░ N. The announcements themselves are given in the Appendix Nos. 9 to 18, inclusive. The Coast Survey is indebted to Commander Davis, u. S. N., now Superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, who so much distinguished himself as a chief of one of

the hydrographic parties, for the determination of the dangerous rocks of Minot's ledge, to which his name has been given, and of several important rocks in the entrance of Boston harbor; and to Gen . .Josttph G. Totten, Chief Engineer, for the communication of the position of the shoal in Garden Key channel, determined by Lieut. H. G. Wright, of the Corps of Engineers. To the kindness of George \V. nlunt, esq., of New York, who has done so much to .advance hydrography in this country, I am indebted for early information of value, derived from the observations of ship-masters. Several different parts of the volumes of records and results of the Coast Survey, for which an appropriation was made at the last session of Congress, are in preparation, and will appear in succession. A general plan of arrangement will be adopted, which, while it admits the publication of finished work without delay, will finally form a series of volumes, classed, as far as practicable, according to the relation of the subjects. The want of an index to the earlier volumes of the Annual Report of the Survey has been seriously felt, and I am indebted to Lieut. E. B. Hunt, of the Corps of Engineers, for supplying that want in the reports of the last ten years-from 1844 to 1853, inclusive-by a general index, which is appended to the present report. The labor involved in such an index is formidable, and is amply entitled to this public acknowledgment. Surveys of sites for light-houses, or examinations in regard to the expediency of erecting new light-houses, and their location under the laws of 1851, 1852, and 1854, have been made at the requisition of the Light-house Board, under instructions from the Treasury Department, in the following named places: Egge!lfoggin Reach, Maine. Isle au Haut Thoroughfare, Maine. Southern island, Maine. Noddle's island, Maine. Dry Point, Maine. York harbor, Maine. Westport, Massachusetts. Pine island, Connecticut. Niantic, Connecticut. Black Point, Connecticut. Southport Connecticut. Race Point, New York. Horton's Point, New York. Coffin's Patches, Florida reef. Instructions for other examinations have been issued, and will be executed during ~h~ surveying season .in the sections to which the localities belong. Most of them, it IS believed, can be completed in time to present during the session of Congress. The following examinations are now in progress : Absecom bar, New Jersey. Bowers' beach, Delaware. Mouth of Old Duck creek, Delaware. Entrance to Vermilion bay, Louisiana. Mouth of Calcasieu river Louisiana. Gallinipper Point, Texas.' Harbor of Santa Barbara, California. Anacapa, or Santa Cruz island, California. Harbor of Santa Cruz, California. Harbor of San Pedro, California.

Point Lobos, California. Punta de los Reyes, California. Umquah, Oregon. Cape Shoal water, vY ashington Territory. New Dungeness, Washington Territory. Blunt's, or Smith's island, W.ashington Territory. The particulars in regard to these examinations will be given under the head of light-houses, in each of the sections following the hydrography. A table stating the examinations made, the object of examination, the officer by whom made, and the result, is given in Appendix No. 68. The official correspondence on the subject will also generally be found in the appendix. . I proceed next to give a condensed view of the operations of the past surveying year-November, 1853, to November, 1854-and to follow this up by the proposed progress and estimates for the next fiscal year-July, 1855, to July, 1856. SECTION I. Coast of 11faine, }{ew Hampshire, 1lfassachusctts, and Rhode Island. (Sketches A Nos. 1 and 2.)-Ragged mouutain, near Camden, }Iaine, has been occ?pied as a primary station, astronomical and magnetic observations being also made there. The lines of sight reach forward to Mount Desert and Humpback mountain, in Brewster. The reconnaissance has been continued to the eastern boundary. The triangulation of Casco bay has been extended to Cape Small Point, entrance of the Kennebec. The topography of Baker's island, part of Cape Small Point, of the approaches to Portland harbor, of Cape Necldick, and to include Ogunquit harbor, in Maine, of the vicinity of Newburyport, Massachusetts, from the connection with the former work south of it, of part of the vicinity of Boston, to determine certain changes for the State commissioners, and of the approaches to Plymouth harbor, has been executed. A hydrographic reconnaissance of the eastern p~rt of Eggemoggin Reach, Maine, has been made; some additional hydrography in and near Portland harbor, for the city commission, has been executed; the hydrography of Massachusetts bay has been commenced, including the sounding out of a fourteenfathom bank at the entrance; the in-shore work from Nahant to Marblehead has been completed; a dangerous ledge off Minot's, and several rocks at the entrance of Boston harbor, have been determined; the off-shore work from the northward of Cape Cod to Monomoy has been commenced; deep-sea soundings have been made from the Nantucket shoals outwards, from southeast round to George's Bank. The hydrography of the north side of the Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, and eastward fro~ the former work, including the sounding out of Hc;>rseshoe, Suc?onesset, and L Homme Dieu shoals, has been completed. A portion of a section from Nantucket southeastwardly across the Gulf Stream has been run. The t~des of t~ese sounds, and their approaches, have been investigated. The regular tidal station at Boston has been kept up. иThe current observations of the Nantucket shoals and in Muskeget channel have been worked up. Views have been taken for the sheets of Salem and Gloucester harbors. The discussion of the results of the chronometer expeditions between Cambridae and Liverpool has been completed. Examinations in regard to the necessity for light-houses, and the selection of sites, have been made, under the law, at Baker's island, Eggemoggin "Reach, Isle au Haut Thoroughfare, Castine, Tenant's harbor, South island, Damariscotta River entrance, Wood island, near Cape Small Point, and Kennebunk pier, Maine, and at Westport, Massachusetts. The computations and reductions of the season's work have been kept up. The following maps, charts, and sketches, belonging to this section, have been drawn or are in progress : Portland harbor, York harbor and Cape Neddick, Annisquam and Ipswich harbors, Gloucester harbor, Plymouth harbor,

Monomoy shoals, Nantucket shoals, Bass River harbor, Muskeget channel, Eastern series Nos. 2 and 3, and current chart of Kantucket shoals. The engraYing of the following plates has been completed during the year; Alden's Rock, Minof8 ledge, Wellfleet harbor, Nantucket 8hoals, and Sow and Pigs reef, off Cuttyhunk; and the following are in progress: Portsmouth harbor, Kewburyport harbor, Salem harbor, Boston harbor, Monomoy harbor, Muskeget channel, and Eastern series, from Point Judith to Kantucket shoals, three plates. SECTION II. Coast of Connecticut, ~Yew York, Kew Jersey, Pennsylvwda, and Delaware. ( Sketch B. )-Observations for latitude, azimuth, and magnetic elements, have been made at Mount Rose station, New Jersey, and at Yard station, Pennsylvania. The triangulation of the Hudson has been carried from the limits of last year to Blue Point Hill, Ulster county, New York, and the topography and hydrography to near Fort Montgomery, and including the wide part of the river known as the Haverstraw bay. The East and North rivers have Leen resurveyed to determine the changes there, and systematic, observations of currents made. The city shore has been re-determined, to connect with the sur'Yey just mentioned. Tidal observations have been continued at Governor's islantl with the self-registering gauge. Special current observations have been made at sea off the south shore of Long Island. Examinations of light-house sites have been made at Pine island, Niantic, Black Point, and Southport, Connecticut, and Race Point and Horton's Point, New York; and others are in progress at Absecom bar, Bowers' beach, and mouth of Old Duck creek. Drawings have been made of Long Island sound No. 1, redrawn in part; comparative chart of Romer shoals and Flynn's knoll, 1835 to 1854; shore-line of part of Manhattan island; chart of currents of Long Island sound. The engraving is in progress, or completed, of Long falaud sound No. 1; south side of Long Island, Nos. 2 and 3; current chart of Long Island sound, and of Romer shoal and Flynn's knoll. SECTION III. Coast of Delaware, Ji[aryland, and Virgini"a. (Sketch C. )-Observations of the solar eclipse of May 26 were made at the Seaton station, Washington, and Roslyn station, Petersburg. Telegraphic differences of longitude have been determined between Petersburg, Virginia, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The stations of the main triangulation of the Chesapeake, completed last year, have been generally secured. The secondary triangulation of James river, from Richm,ond to Harrison's bar, has been completed, and its extension is in progress. The topography of the ocean shore, near Drummondtown. has been continued from Metomkin to Wachapreague inlet ; that of the Chesapeake has furnished the s?ore-line of York, Pocosin, and Back River entrances; has been carried up James river from its mouth to Warwick river, on one side, and to Day's Point on the o.ther; has included the mouth of Kansemond river, and extended up Elizabeth river beyond Portsmouth and Norfolk, and along the shore to Turner's creek. The topography of the immediate shores of the Rappahannock has bi;en carried from Port Royal to Tappahannock. Verification work has been done on Back river, Maryland, and Meekin's neck. The hydrography of Chesapeake bay proper has ~een completed, including the sounding of Hampton roads, and of the Elizabeth r~ver and harbor of Norfolk. The hydrography of the Rappahannock has been earned to Port Royal, and that of James River entrance has been commenced and extended to the limits already stated for the topography. A resurvey has been made of the Bodkin channel and approaches, at the entrance of the Patapsco river, to test changes there. The tidal station at Old .Point Comfort has been continued, and temporary stations on the James river have been occupied. Drawings have been made, or are in progress, of Chesapeake bay, sheets Nos. I, 2, and 3, first

Sketches have been engraved of the seacoast of Virginia No. 2, Wachapreague, Machipongo, andMetomkin inlets, Virginia; ofShip and Sand Shoal inlets; of Cape Charles and the vicinity, and Cherrystone inlet and Pungoteague creek, Virginia; and maps of tho Chesapeake bay No. 1 and No. 2, and of Patapsco river, re-engraving, ar~ in progress. SECTION IV. CoflSt of Yfrginia and North Carolina. (Sketch D.)-The difference of longitude of Raleigh, North Carolina, and Columbia, South Carolina, has been determined, as part of the connection between Washington and New Orleans, and the latitude and magnetic elements measured at Raleigh. Wilmington, North Carolina, has been connected with Petersburg, Virginia, for difference of longitude from Washington, and its latitude and magnetic elements determined. The secondary triangulation has been carried north of Currituck sound to within fifteen miles of Cape Henry, and southward over Bogue sound towards New river. The topography of Cape Fear river has been finished; that of Currituck sound has made some progress, in connection with the triangulation; and that of Beaufort harbor has been completed. The hydrography of Beaufort harbor, and its dependencies and approaches, has been completed. A reconnaissance of the Wimble shoals has been executed. Tidal observations have been made at Cape Hatteras, at Cape Lookout, and Beaufort entrance, and at Bald Head, Cape Fear. A line of levels for connecting the tidal stations has been run from Wilmington to Smithville, North Carolina. .Maps and charts have been finished, or are in progress, of Beaufort harbor, Cape Fear river, reconnaissance of Wimble shoals, of the Gulf Stream, with diagrams of temperatures on different sections; charts of Albemarle sound, one sheet of a preliminary chart of the same sound, Nos. I and 2 of Beaufort harbor, of Wimble shoals reconnaissance, of Cape Fear entrance and New inlet, (new edition) of the Gulf Stream explorations mud the diagrams, and of co- tidal lines of the Atlantic coast, have been engraved during the year or are in progress. SECTION V. Coast of South Carolina and Georgia. (Sketches E Nos. 1 and 2. )-A general reconnaissance has been made from the Santee river to the Ashley. The latitude of Allston station, near Georgetown, South Carolina, approximate longitude, aud the magnetic elements, have been determined. The telegraphic difference of longitude between Columbia, South Carolina, and Raleigh, North Carolina, part of the line from Washington to New Orleans, and the latitude and magnetic elements at Co1umbia, have been determined. Astronomical observations at Charleston were continued during part of the year. The primary triangulation between the Edisto base and Charleston has made some progress, and the secondary triangulation connected with it has been executed up the W ando river to Daniell's island.

Coast of California, and of Oregon and Washington Territories. (Sketches J and K, J.Yos. 1 and 2. )-Observations for latitude and azimuth, and magnetic elements, have been made at Humboldt bay. Magnetic observations ha e also been made at San Diego, San Pedro, San Luis Obispo, and at Monterey. The primary triangulation, and secondary connecttЦ1 with it, resting on the Pulgas preliminary base, have been carried north to Ballenas bay, and south to Monterey; and the tertiary triangulation along the immediate shore has been commenced. A tertiary triangulation has been carried over Ballenas bay, and to Duxbury reef. The triangulation for connecting the Santa Barbara islands and main, resting on the Los Angeles base, has been carried from Las Balsas to Point Duma, and Santa Catalina islanu has been connected with the main. The triangulation of the Gulf of Georgia, and approaches, has made good progress. The topography of San Francisco bay has been continued and extended to Point San Mateo; and that of the coast north, to Duxbury reef, has been completed. The topography of Monterey bay has been completed from the Salinas river, on the south, to north of Ano Nuevo, and a party is at work towards Point Lobos, San Francisco entrance. The hydrography of Tomales bay has been executed. That of Ilumboldt bay, from Eureka, to include the entrance, and north to Eel river, has been finished; that of Lummi and other islands, in the Gulf of Ckorgia, executed.

The oiservations of the field parties, as they have been turned into the office, have been computed, and, when approved, passed into the archiVes. The topographical maps and hydrographical charts, with the computed results, have furnished the data from which the new maps and sketches referred to have been drawn and engraved. Some plates have been prepared for the annual report, not coming under the head of any of the sections. The engraved maps have been electrotyped, and from these plates impressions taken for publication. The numerous sketches of progress, and others accompanying the report, are in part from this dat&.

\Yhile eyery effort has been made to return the greatest possible 11umlier of results for the means employed, and the parties in tbe field, afloat, and in the office, have each, in turn, felt the pressure of the extraordinary increase of cost of every article which it was necessary to be supplied with, it has become obvious, especially during the past year, that the number of parties necessary to secure the desired prcgress could not be sent into all the sections, and be kept there sufficiently long, unless the means were adapted to the enhancement of prices of labor and supplies. Thus, along the coast of the Gulf of .Mexico, from three to four parties should be employed in Sections VII, VIII, and IX, but the means have only served to keep between two and three at work in Sections VIII and IX. While this state of things might possibly not be lasting, I refrained from remark, determined to make the best of matters, and to bear the temporary pressure. But it does not seem temporary, and I have therefore felt bound to present the 1mbject fairly to the department, to ask your examination of it, and your decision whether our average progress should be diminished, or whether you would recommend additional supplies. In my own judgment, the rate of progress of the survey ought not to he checked, but it should be brought to a termination within a moderate period. The progress is steady, and it is obvious that the connection of the parts and the completion of the whole work within such limited or reasonable time requires merely that the present plans be steadily pursued. "VY e cannot expect to be the only exception in the country to the effect of the rise of prices. The enhanced wages oflabor1 prices of supplies of every sort, and of equipments used in the survey, necessarily require an increase of appropriation. Two years ago I adopted, from necessity, the plan of limiting each surveying party to a particular amount of expenditure, and stopping their work when that amount was expended. This was necessary in order not to overrun our means, and yet it frequently happened that circumstances would make it very desirable to prolong the working time. It has been further necessary within the past year to keep the number of parties carefully down t prevent an excess of expenditure, since contingencies must be provided for to make the administration of the work a safe one. This has been most remarkable in reference to the repairs of our steamers and other vessels, instances occurring of a great excess in cost of repairs over the estimates made by officers of good judgment, thus crippling other parties of the work by absorbing the means intended for their purposes. Congress has so often approved of the present scale of progress, and I am so sure that it is more economical than a smaller rate, that I could not recommend that alternative to the department. The department is aware that the rates of pay fixed by it for the employes of the survey have fallen behind those paid for similar services generally, and that whe~ le_gislation has acted on these rates it has increased them, and thus changed the r~lative positions of emolument unfavorably, and that there has even been a disposition ma~ifested in Congress to increase these rates in certain other cases. It is not from this source, however, of compensation to officers of the survey, that our means have felt the change in money relations, but from the rise of the prices of supplies of every sort, and of the wages of ordinary labor. From the prices of the past year, I have estimated that an advance of about twenty per cent. is necessary in the present appropriation for the Atlantic coast, and somew~at more than that for the Florida reefs and keys. The appropriation for the Western coast need not be increased, and that for the publication of records and results may be less than the one for last year.

Having suLmitted this subject to your decision, and found that, in your judgment, it was proper to make the estimates what was required to meet the usual rate of progress, I have arranged the plan of work and the estimates to be submitted to Congress accordingly, with the hope that they may receive favorable consideration. The desire rather to urge on the work to completion, than to keep it lingering over a long period of years, has heretofore been fully responded to; and having и, now nearly, or quite, reached half way in its progress, it requires only a reasonable time at its present rate to push the work entirely through. The estimates suppose the same aid which is now furnished under the law from the Navy and War Departments, by the detail of officers for the hydrography and land work respectively. The items will run thus: For continuing the survey of the coast of the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, (including compensation of the Superintendent and assistants, and excluding pay and emoluments of officers of the army and navy, and petty officers and men of the navy employed in the work,) per act of :March 3, 1843 $250,000 For continuing the survey of the Florida reefs, keys, and coast, ( excluding pay and emoluments of officers of the army and navy, and petty officers and men of the navy employed in the work,) per act of March 31 1849 For continuing the survey of the Western coast of the United States, per act of September 30, 1850 130,000 For publishing the observations made in the progress of the survey of the coast of the United States, per act of March 3, 1843 For transportation, fuel, and quarters, and for mileage of officers and enlisted men of the army servin~ on the Coast Survey, no longer provided for by the quartermaster department 10,000 The appropriations for the present fiscal year areFor the survey of the Atlantic and Gulf coast of the United States, including the compensation of the Superintendent and assistants 206,000 For continuing the survey of the Florida reefs and keys 30,000 For continuing the survey of the Western coast of the United States 130,000 For publishing the observations made in the progress of the survey of the coast 20,000 For fuel, quarters, &c., for officers and men of the army serving on the 10,000 Coast Survey ESTIMATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1855-.'56.

SECTION I.-FRO.llf PASSAMAQUODDY DAY TO POINT JUDITH, INCLUDING THE COAST OF MAINE, NEW
HAMPSHIRE, .MASSACHUSETTS, AND RHODE ISLAXD. (SKETCH A.)

The progress of this section has been satisfactory. To make up for the late period at which means were available for the work, as many parties as could be supplied with means were put at work in August. One primary station (Ragged mo~ntain, near Camden) has been occupied, and astronomical and geodetic observat10ns made there. The primary triangulation is still in advance of the secondary. The secondary triangulation of Casco bay has been very nearly completed to Cape Small Point, keeping in its turn in advance of the topography. The topography of Portland harbor, Maine, and its approaches, has been continued eastward. That of Cape N eddick and the vicinity has been completed. That of the vicinity of Newburyport, Massachusetts, to the junction with the former work there, has been finished. The topography of the vicinity of Plymouth, Massachusetts, bas been continued. Hydrography, from the Nantucket shoals eastward, on the south side of Nantucket island, along the coast of Cape Cod, and in-shore and ofi~shore

in Massachusetts bay, has been executed. The hydrography of the Vineyard and Nantucket sounds has been nearly completed, including the soundings out of three important shoals. Tidal observations at Boston have been continued, and the tides of .Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, and of the ocean in the vicinity, have been investigated. Views have been taken for the charts of Salem and Gloucester harbors. The hydrographcr in Massachusetts bay has been rewarded for his labors by the discovery in the entrance of an extensive bank, of which he has given the position and defined the limits, with from ten and a half to fourteen and a half fathoms on it, lying across the entrance, and serving thus as an excellent mark for navigators entering this important bay. I propose to call this, from the name of its discoverer, Stellwagen's Bank. , Maps of Portland, York and Cape N eddick, Annisquam and Ipswich, Gloucester, Plymouth, Monomoy, and Bass River harbors, and of Muskeget channel, and Eastern series Kos. 2 and 3, have been drawn or are in progress. Finished maps of Portsmouth, Newburyport, Salem, Boston, and .Monomoy harbors, of .Muskeget channel, and Eastern series Nos. 1, 2, and 3, are engra...-ing; and sketches of Alden's rock and of Minot's ledge have been engraved during the year. The observations of currents on the Nantucket shoals and in Muskeget channel have been collected, and systematic results deduced. The computations of the chronometer expeditions between Cambridge and Liverpool have been completed. Considerable progress has been made in comparing the results of different methods of measuring heights, the examinations of which have been reported for two years. By invitation of the city authorities of Portland, I joined a commission, consisting of General Totten, Commander Davis, and myself~ to investigate the changes in the harbor, and to fix definite shore-lines. Numerous examinations of light-house sites have been made, under the law, in this section. . Reconnawsance.-Brevet Major Henry Prince, U. S. A., assistant Coast Survey, has continued the reconnaissance for the primary triangulation to the boundary, including the examination of two sites for a base of verification, and the collection of information in regard to other localities, which must be examined before the selection of a site is finally made. As he is at this time in the field, the report of his operations will not be made in time to be more specially noticed. Prirnary triangulation and astronomical observations.-In the last week of June, the operations of my party at Wilmington, Xorth Carolina, were closed, and preparations made to proceed to Section I, as soon as means could be procured. While the station at Ragged mountain, near Camden, l\Iaine, (see Sketch A, No. 1,) was preparing by Assistant George W. Dean and Mr. Thomas McDonnell, I took charge, personally, of the arrangements for tidal observations at Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and the south shore of Massachusetts, commencing geodetic observations at Ragged mountain early in August. This is an astronomical as well as a geodetic station, and the latitude and azimuth have been observed, as well as horizontal and vertical angles. The usual magnetic observations have also been made. Betwe.en the 1st of August and 21st of November, fifteen hundred and fifty-five observat10ns were made on eleven stations, with the thirty-inch theodolite ( C. S. No. 1) by my~elf, assisted by Mr. G. W. Dean, and during part of the time by .Mr. Stephen Hams. The longest side of the triangles formed at this point, is the o?e to ~fount Pleasant-eighty-four miles; the shortest to Isle au Haut-tw~i:ty e1g~t miles. The large number of points visible from this one, and all, reqmrrng heliotropes, made the progress here necessarily slow; and the summers drought

The area of the triangufation estimated in the usual way, covered this year, is 2,200 s(1uare miles. Y ertical angles were measured on four stations, by forty-three sets of five repetitions, by Assistant George vY. Dean, with an eightиinch Gambey theodolite, (C. S. No. 57 ;) and on six stations with the micrometer of the thirtyinch theodolite. The azimuth of a mark about three miles distant, and which was connected carefully with the points of triangulation, was determined by eight sets of observations on Polaris, at eastern elongation, the average number of observations in each set Leing twelve; and by two sets on Lamda, Ursre ~iinoris, at upper culmination, twelve in each set. The occasion was taken to examine again the details of the different parts of the observations, by obtaining their probable errors. 'Ihe observations were made generally by myself, assisted by Mr. Stephen Harris, and occasionally by Mr. Dean. The latitude was determined by Assistant George W. Dean, by two hundred and twenty-eight obseTVations on forty-eight pairs of stars, with a zenith telescope by William vVurdemann, (C. S. No. 5,) and by Mr. Stephen Harris by one hundred and thirty-eight observations on the same pairs. The object was to throw new light upon the personal equation found last year in using the zenith telescope, and care was taken that the stars employed should be the same, and that they should be observed in precisely the same way. The number of observations on each pair was, when practicable, not less than five, which had been found to give a probable error of observation of but about 0. 25 11 in the determination of the latitude. Of the pairs, twenty-two were from the Greenwich Twelve Year, and twenty-six from the British Association Catalogue. A very careful series of determinations for the value of the micrometer screw and level were made. The time was determined by one hundred and forty observations on high and low starR, by ~fr. Dean and Mr. Harris, with transit No. 81 C. S., by Troughton and Simms. J.lfagnet-ic observations.-As it was expected, from the geological structure of Ragged mountain, that considerable local magnetic attraction might exist, Mr. Dean made observations at various points to test this. The magnetic declination was determined by observations on four days. For horizontal intensity, and moment of inertia, two sets of experiments were made upon two days. The dip was observed at two points; one N. N. E. about one hundred yards, and the other W. N. W. two hundred yards from the geodetic station. Two sets were observed at each locality on two days, and the results show the small difference of three minutes of arc, the inclination at the northern point being the least. The magnetic declinations at Light Honse island, and Northea..<;t Point near the eastern entrance to Camden harbor, was determined at each station from twenty repetitions with a five-inch magnetic theodolite, (Jones, 0. S. No. 1.) At these two points the declination differed 37'. Observations for declination: intensity, and dip, were also made near the southern entrance to the harbor. These consisted of two hundred and seventy-three observations, at intervals of fifteen minutes each, between 7 a. m. and 4k p~ m. on seven days. For horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, three sets were observed on three days, and two sets for dip of needle on two days. .Mr. Dean was assisted in the magnetic observations by :Messrs. S. Harris and R. J. Breckenridge, jr.

Jfeteorological olJservations.-A meteorological journal was kept by ~1r. James Searles, in which two hundred and eighty-six readings of mountain barometer ~o. 619 (Green, New York,) and two hundred and eighty-six readings of ancrnicl ~o. 8580 (Dent,) in counection with one hundre<l and sixty obsern1tions of the wet, and two hundred and eighty-six of the dry bulb thermometers, were recorded. All the geodetic, astronomical, and magnetic original records have been made in duplicate, and the reduction of latitude and azimuth obserrntions completed in the field. The latitude and magnetic records of observations made by Assistant G. '\Y. Dean at Columbia, South Carolina, and vVilmington, North Carolina, between February and July, have been duplicated, aud good progress made in the reductions of the obserrntions. Secondary triangulation.-The secondary triangulation of Casco bay, (see Sketch A, No. 2,) was continued from the approaches to Portland, eastward to Cape Small Point, by Assistant C. 0. Boutelle, aided by Lieutenant A. W. Evans, r. S. A. All the stations, except Cape Small Point, intended to be occupied, were finished between the 1st of August and 3d of NoYember, when it was necessary to make arrangements for resuming work in Section Y. The weather was very unfavorable for work, the sea being so rough as frequently to render landing on the islands impossible, and the atmosphere being hazy and filled with smoke. The secondary triangulation will, not\Yithstanding, keep much in advance of the topography. The statistics of the work executed are thus referred to by Mr. Boutelle: "Up to the present time (November :-:l,) there haYe been twenty-four stations occupied, at which seven hundred and fifty-three (753) angles upon six hundred and sixty-eight ( 668) objects have been measured by 6,424 observations. Vertical angles have been observed at ten stations, where eighty-four (84) angles upon eighty-four (84) objects by six hundred and one (601) observations have been made. "Points are determined in Yarmouth, Freeport, and Brunswick, for the survey of those towns and their neighboring harbors. "The positions of twenty points have been determined, computed, and furnished to Assistant Gilbert, for the topographical survey of Cape Small Point. "Seventy-six signals of 1st, 2d, and 3d orders have been put up and observed upon, and many houses and other prominent objects, natural and artificial, have been determined for the use of the topographical and hydrographic parties." Mr. F. P. Webber rendered acceptable service as aid to this party, and in computing part of the work of the previous season in Section IV ; and Mr. C. A. Paudpaschaud as computer, temporarily employed on the astronomical wo;:k of the same section. The party had the use of the Coast Survey schooner Guthrie in their operations. Topography.-The topography at Portland harbor, (see Sketch A, No. 2,) and the approaches to the northward and eastward, has been continued by Assistant A. W. Longfellow, who reports the following work done between July 1 and November 1: Nu~ber of miles of shore-line surveyed, sixty-one; of roads, thirty-one; and area, ~1x~een square miles. "The topography has the intricacy and great amount ?f artificial detail which characterizes the neighborhood of all considerable towns m New England." Tracings of this work have been furnished to the office and sounding party. The topography of the vicinity of York harbor and Cape N eddick was continued e~stwar~ by Sub-Assistant A. S. Wadsworth, during the period of the summer 1d1e11 his serv1~es could be applied to this, after closing work in Section IV, and has been ?3'rned as far as to include Ogunquit harbor, in the town of Wells. The she~t oont:uns an area of five square miles and twelve miles of shore-line. The ground 1s

extremely rough and broken, and a large portion of it is covered with thick: woods. Mr. W ausworth is now under instructions to return to Section IV. Assistant II. L. Whiting commenced, in August, the topography of the vicinity of N ewlmryport from the points at which he had left it last year, and continued in this vicinity until his services were requested by the commissioners of the 'State of Massachusetts to determine the changes, natural and artificial, since his previous survey of the vicinity of Boston harbor, when he was relieved by Sub-Assistant I. H. Adams. Mr. \Yhiting's office-work consisted in the preparation for office use of the following topographical sheets, viz: и Cuttvhunk scale orluu

The details on these maps are minute. He is now under instructions to proceed to Section III. Sub-Assistant I. Hull Adams continued the work above referred to, near Newburyport, to the close of the season. The topography there executed includes an area of about eight square miles and a shore-line of about eleven. The country is in part undulating and cultivated in farms, and in part salt marsh intersected by creeks and with oak hammocks. This work connects with that of a former season by Assistant A. vY. Longfellow . .Mr. Adams is preparing for duty in Section VI, Florida reefs and keys. Sub-Assistant R. l\f. Bache, on returning from Section V, was instructed to coutiirne the topographical work near Plymouth harbor, commenced last season by Assistant S. A. Gilbert. The party began the survey on the 28th of August, and discontinued operations on the 15th of October. The work of the season includes Kingston and a portion of Duxbury, comprising an area of about six square miles. Fifteen miles of shore-line and twenty-four miles of roads were surveyed. The survey between these points is now complete, with the exception of the low-water line, which in some places lies far beyond the line of high water. Hydrography.-The in-shore work of the party of Lieut. Comg. H. S. Stellwagen, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Bibb, has consisted of soundings on the south side of Nantucket (see Sketch A, No. 2) to connect the hydrography of the Nantucket shoals with that of .Muskeget channel and Martha'1> Vineyard; and in .Massachusetts bay, from Nahant to Marblehead, supplementary to the in-shore soundings there in former years. The ojf-shore work has been carried from the Nantucket shoals southward and eastward, eastward and northward, and eastward, extending in that direction to George's Bank, along the shore of Cape Cod, and in Massachusetts bay. The lines of deep-sea soundings off Nantucket shoals were first run, as shown on the sketch. The Nantucket Shoal light-boat was of the greatest service in the operation. Next, the stations were put upon the south side of Nantucket island, and the in-shore work completetf. During this time frequent gales and dense fogs interrupted the soundings. Next, the line along Cape Cod was run, and then the in and off shore work in .Massachusetts bay. The offshore lines were the following: From Cape Cod to Minot's Ledge light-boat; from near Nahant, east twenty-one miles, sounding to the depth of sixty-one fathoms, and returning on a line nearly parallel with the former to Boston light ; from Cape Ann (Eastern Point light) to Cape Cod (Race Point light;) from Cape Cod to Mamomet Point, thence to Gurnett lights, Plymouth ; from Scituate, twenty-seven miles off shore, returning on nearly a parallel to Point Alderton.

During the progress of this work, Lieut. Comg. Stell wagen discovered the extensive bank before referred to, and subsequently ran six lines across its breadth and two in the direction of its length, so as to define its limits and the character of the bottom with considerable accuracy. This bank lies chiefly outside of a line drawn from Race Point light, Cape Cod, to Thatcher's Island light, Cape Ann. Its greatest length is seventeen ancl a half nautical miles, in the direction nearly N. by \Y. and S. by E. by compass. Its greatest breadth is five miles, its least two and a half, and the mean breadth about three miles. Six lines of soundings have been run across it in different parts, and two in the direction of its length. The latitude of the north end of the bank, in twenty fathoms water, is nearly that of Nahant and of the south end, five minutes south of Scituate light. The least water on the bank is ten fathoms and a half at six and a half nautical miles N. 30! W. (true) from Race Point light. Near this spot, and separated by deeper water from it, are two spots of thirteen fathoms, N. 17░ vV. (true) from !face Point, distant nine miles, and N. 12░ W., distant eleven miles, from Uace Point light; next fourteen fathoms N. 17 W., (true,) distant thirteen miles and a half, and 9░ W., distant fourteen miles and a half, from Race Point light; finally, fourteen fathoms and a half N. 23░ \Y., distant twenty miles from llace Point. Considered as a twenty-fathom bank, it is continuous, one encl lieing five miles from Race Point light, and the other fifteen miles from Cape Ann (Thatcher's Island) light. In general, it shoals less rapidly outside than in, being quite steep on the insi<le, except at the southwest extremity. At the south end, towards Race Point, it falls off very rapidly. The northern end of the bank has rocky bottom, with, however, a slight covering of fine black sand. The middle and southern parts are coarse white and yellow sand, with some pebbles. The bottom inside of the bank, in deep waterand this is quite an important observation-is generally a green unctuous mud, or ooze. In reporting his examination of this bank, Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen observes: "I have to announce to you the completion of the examination of a bank lying just outside of Massachusetts bay, and in the direct line of the approaches to Boston from east and southeast directions. "I consider the promulgation of this discovery a very essential thing to navigators, and that the knowledge of it will highly benefit commanders of vessels and the great commercial interest of the city of Boston, as an invaluable aid to vessels bound in during thick weather by day or night. By it they can not only ascertain their distance to the eastward of the coast, but, by attention to the lead after passing inside, a good idea of the latitude may also be obtained. Thus thrf'e or four miles to westward of the northern half of the shoal the water deepens generally to fifty fathoms, while at the same dist.'tnce inside of the southern ha.If the greatest depth of soundings diminishes gradually from forty-five fathoms in latitude 42░ 15' N. to thirty-five fathoms, all the way across to the main land. "The soundings on the northern end of the bank indicate rocky bottom, though the 'Stellwagen cup' brought up small pieces of stone and fine black sand ( disintegrated rock) in small quantities. The middle and southern parts seemed to be coarse white and yellow sand, and occasionally pebbles, of which the sounding apparatus brought up full specimens. The bottom in the deep water inside is geuerallJ: a green unctuous mud, or ooze. The bank forms gradually from the east, but nses very abruptly and steep on its western edge." . The results th~s obtained were immediately plotted and sent to me for enminnt10n, together with the information which could be collected in Boston on the subject of the existence of such a bank. Two views may be taken of this shoal formation , in one of which it may be con. {>

siJered as a ser'ies of shoals separated by deeper water than that on the crest of the shoal or as a continuous Lank иwith several crests. In the first view, the tenand-a-half fathom spot nearest to Race Point, the two thirteen-fathom spots, the two fourteen-fathom spots, and the fourteen-and-a-half.fathom spot nearest to Cape Ann, are shoals with deeper water, viz: fifteen to eighteen fathoms between them. In the second, this is a continuous bank with twenty fathoms, with four principal sumи mits as far as the present season's examination has shown. On the carefully-studied chart of :Massachusetts bay, by Messrs_ K & G. "\\~. Blunt, with soundings expressly made for it, this bank is not indicated; and this is the most recent and best authority. The chart of Messrs. lmray & Son, of London, published in 1849, shows, uron the line from Race Point light to Cape Ann, no sounding less than twenty-mne fathoms until near Cape Ann. There is twelve fathoms marked due uorth from Race Point three and a half nautical miles, where Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen has deep water. Due north from Race Point thirteen nautical miles, there is marked a small shoal spot, extending seven miles east :i,ml west and two miles north and south, with eleven. thirteen, and fifteen fathoms marked on it and named "Barron Dank." In a subseq~ent edition of the same chart (1853) this name does not appear, but the soundings, eleven, twelve, arnl fifteen fathoms, are placed between a line north from !face Point and a line from the same point to Cape Ann, and eleven miles from Race Point. The hydrographer obviously had authority for eleven fathoms in this vicinity, but not such as would authorize him to fix it permanently on the chart or to call it Barron Bank; otherwise he would have retained the mark and name. Imray's chart of 1853 shows several other important a.1terations from that of 1849, giving the former the indeterminate nature of the hydrography of this great bay. On the line from Race Point light, Cape Cod, to Thatcher's Island light, Cape Ann, a sounding of fifteen fathoms is marked two miles from Race Point, twelve fathoms at seven miles, and fourteen fathoms at twenty-three miles and a half. Lambert's chart, published in Salem, 1822, from which the new edition published in 1853 was taken, has a shoal rudely marked out, on a line from Hace Point, Cape Cod, to Thatcher's Island light, Cape Ann, with fourteen fathoms as the least water on it, twenty-one nautical miles from Race Point. The shoal is made to extend within the forty-fathom mark, seven miles and a half northwest and southeast, by five miles and a half. On each side of the fourteen fathoms are twenty fathoms, i1istant four miles. This is marked "Middle Bank." There is no other sounding of less than thirty-five fathoms on this line. A twelve-fathom spot is marked on a survey of part of Massachusetts bay, made by J. F. W. De Barres in 1781, eight miles from Race Point, in the direction of Cape Ann; and this is probably the authority for the sounding marked on Imray's chart of 1853. The erroneous character of these determinations generally will appear from Sketch A No. 7, of Stellwagen's Bank. The fourteen-fathom sounding is a near approach to fourteen m1d a half at the north end of the bank. Beforehand, we should doubtless have rejected these results, as Mr. Blunt has done, as vague and untrustworthy. Now that we have Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen's ~хrvey, we may say that the fourteen fathoms on Lambert's chart is actually near the spot assigned, though the rest of the determinations on the important line which has served as our line of reference are generally erroneous, and this appears to have been the authority for lrnray's fourteen fathoms, nearly in the same place. That there was any connexion between the twelve-fathom souuding, the expunged ~'Barron Bank," and Lambert's "Middle Bank," does not appear to have occurred to any hydrographer.

That the sounding-line was not dropped on Stcllwagen's Bank before he discovered it in 1854, cannot, I think, be affirmed. If we knew who had made the observations, I should incline to preserve their names in connection with the southwest and northwest spots respectively, though this might require consideration. But "Barron Bank," as such, has no existence, and was rightly expunged, and "Middle Bank," as such, has none; and all were, for vagueness, properly excluded from the chart. A great bank, stretching across the entrance to Massachusetts bay, five miles from Race Point, to fifteen miles from Cape Ann, was unknown to the charts. But if we admit, which we cannot, that the ten-and-a-half-fathom spot and the fourteen and a half are two shoals previously known, then Lieut. Stellwagcm has discovered two new oues between them; or if we substitute hiB accurate determinations for vague surmise, and assume that the ten and a half and fourteen and a lialf fathom spots were known, which we ought not to do, then Stellwagen's Bank stretches from nine miles to fourteen and a half miles from TI.ace Point, and we sunder tho continuity which he has found to exist. The information of some of the most experienced pilots of Boston has Leen called out, and diligent inquiry has been made among underwriters. There was certainly an idea of a middle ground, but quite vague, and uncertainty as to depth and position. As a great mark in a fog, no such middle ground was known. The position, general dimensions, and depths, arc now laid down, the character of the bottom is shown, and the degree of shoaling of the bank determined. It was an original discovery, well worked out under many disadvantages. Yague rumor of its existence should not, and will not, deprive its zealous, persevering explorer of the title to place his name upon this capital sea-mark. The statistics of the season's work are given in the annexed table.

While at work on the south side of Nantucket, the party had the opportunity of rendering important service to a vessel wrecked on Cape Poge, assisting in getting her off and towing her into port. The acknowledgment of Captain Hipson and of the agents of the underwriters were made in a letter given in the Appendix No. 58. This party has executed the drawing and reduction of ~urveys made in the preceding season. The Coast Survey is indebted to Commander Charles H. Davis, U. S. N., who, as chief of a hydrographic party, executed the survey of Boston harbor, for a continued interest in the perfection of the work there. It is not expected that, how-

36

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

ever much pains may be bestowed on the bydrography, where the bottom is rocky and rough, all t11e projecting points of rock can be determined by the survey. The sounding-lead must miss some of them, and even dragging with the deep-sea line fails to detect them all. The determinations made by Commander Davis during the past seaoon are three in number, and will be found Rtated in Appendix No. 10, and marked 011 the chart of Boston harbor, now in the course of engraving. The determination of Davis' ledge, near the Minot's, has already been referred to; (see also Appcn di.x No. 11.) After completing the hydrography near New York, assigned to bis party, Lieut. Comg. "\Voodhull commenced that in Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, in the schooners Gallatin and Madison. This hydrogruphy (shown in Sketch A bis) touches that of Commander Blake on the west, and of Commander Davis and Lieut. Comg. McBlair on the south, Lieut. Oomg. \Yoodhull's work of last season on the east, and surrounds that of Commander Davis and Lieut. Comg. McBlair near Hyannis and Bass river. It includes tl10se very important shoals known as the "Horse Shoe," "Snccunesset," and "L'Homme Dicu" shoals, and includes an ttrea of two hundred and twenty square miles. In sounding, 1,320 miles were run, 15,300 casts of the lead made, and 1, 360 angles measured. This excellent season's work was performed notwithstanding the alternate gales and fogs which prevailed and interfered materially with the progre~s. The distance of much of the sounding from the land should also be considered in estimating the progress of this party. Lieut. Rutledge, in the schooner Madison, aided me in the early part of the season in the tidal observations at Great Point, Nantucket. The investigation of currents off Long Island is referred to in Section II; it was made as Lieut. Comg. Woodhull proceeded to execute the light-house duty required in that section, at the close of October. About the time of their beginning work in August, I visited this party, and was satisfied that the arrangements were calculated to insure a successful season. There remains now but about one-fifth of the space included in these sounds to complete the hydrography. The importance of the thoroughfare, in the hydrography of which Lieut. Comg. Woodhull has been engaged, will be understood by the statistics furnished by William Mitchell, esq., of Nantucket-collected by Captain Coleman, of the light-boat on the Horse Shoe shoal, Nantucket sound-of the number of vessels passing through the sound during the year ending November 15. These vessels were 23,487 in number, and consisted of five hundred and fifty (550) ships, three thousand and seventyиseven (3,077) brigs, sixteen thousand five hundred and forty-three (16,543) schooners, six hundred and sixty-three (663) sloops, and two thousand six hundred and fifty-four (2,654) steamers. Returning from the light-house examination in the eastern part of the coast of Maine, Lieut. Comg. Craven executed the following hydrography, desired by the commission on Portland harbor, for the city authorities, viz: the sounding of Portland riv~r, Back cove, and Presurnpscot river, the observations of currents at nine, and of tides at four stations, and the collection of specimens of the bottom in particular localities in the harbor and vicinity. Ti'des.-Thc complicated system of tides in Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard sound~ and in the sea outside of the islands giving names to the sounds, will be seen by a glance at the side sketch accompanying the chart of co-tidal lines, ~Sketch No. 26.) This region forms the dividing space between the tidal establishments of eight hours and of twelve hours, or more properly of the co-tidal hours of XII and XV, and both these hours occur within the Vineyard sound. The

observations already made pointed to the interference of the several title-waves having access to this space, as the source of the seeming irregularities, and it was necessary to trace these by careful anu multiplied observatio11s, directed, first, by the knowledge we have already acquired, and followed up as the phenomena иwere developed by the observations themselves. In no other way coul<l we expect to give to the numerous navigators of these sounds, through which so much of the coasting trade of the United States passes, any intelligent or consistent account of the tides and currents, which have been so long considered as curious and perplexing. After arranging a general system of observations, and maturing some of the details, I intrusted the execution to Sub-Assistant Henry .Mitchell and to Assistant George H. Fairfield, both of whom were attached to the tidal party, and knew, from the discussion of observations and practice in regulating the tidal stations, the necessary precautions to be taken, and how a definite result was to be attained. It had been my intention to place the whole work in the hands of Ur. Henry Mitchell, but the season was so far advanced that it was absolutely necessary to divide the labor. The very difficult part of the investigation outside of Kantucket, and the general discussion of the results, have been under his charge. The first difficulty to be overcome in executing the observations, was to obtain a gauge which could be observed by night and by clay, and which would stand when exposed to the open sea, as on the outside of Nantucket. vYe had found that the pipe-gauge placed there soon silted up, and was not to be relied on, though at first it seemed to work well. Our next recourse was to a hollow tube, a gas-pipe, into which a post-auger was welded, which could be readily made to penetrate the sand vertically, and which would carry a float-rod with marks, visible from the shore through a telescope, and illuminated at night by a lamp drawn to it upon a wire. The details of this were carefully studied by Mr. Mitchell, and the difficulties which rose cme after another were overcome. He thus sums up his experience: "A common copper box-gauge, fixed by a joint, upon which it can move in a vertical plane, to the ring of an anchor, and braced to three other anchors by rods antl chains, is the whole. The auger is of no use, and may do harm. The joint need allow the box to turn but one way, as the ring lies horizontally on the bottom when the flukes are well buried, so that the stock rests in the sand. A surf.boat and three men are employed three or four hours in putting down these gauges." The plan of observations was to establish gauges of reference at Wood's Hole, (Nobska,) Holmes' Hole, (West Chop,) and Brandt Point, (Nantucket,) to be kept up during the whole series, for the purpose of connecting them ; to make separate examinations in groups of the north side of Nantucket; the east and south side of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard; M:uskeget channel; the north shore of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard; the north shore of Nantucket and the Vineyard sounds from Monomoy to Wood's Hole. The local observations for comparison were continued for different periods from three days to a lunation, as the case appeared to require. . ~ne of the most interesting results first developed was, that the whole difference m tim~ of four hours occurred between the West Chop of Holmes1 Hole and .Menemи sha Bight, (see Sketch A bi,,;,) a distance of but twelve miles; then, that on the west side of the point or West Chop, the time of high water was the same nearly as inside, and that nearly the whole difference occurred between Cedar Tree Neck (see Sketch ~ bis,) a~d the West Chop, only six miles apart; and finally, that a differ~nce in time of high water of three and a half hours actually occurred along the strait-shore of Martha's Vineyard island in a distance of four miles. In the same way, on the

38

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

north shore, Point Gammon (see Sketch .A_ bis) and Davis' Keck gave but a small part of the difference of 3h. 53ni. between Nobska and Point Gammon, nearly the whole of the difference occurring in a distance of but two miles and a half: Lines of levels are yet to be run by .Mr. .Mitchell connecting the bench-marks of the gauges. Mr. .Mitchell acknowledges, in terms of great praise, the services of Mr. G. Wiirdemann, of .Mr. F. F. :!\es, and Captain G. W. Coffin, of Nantucket. These observations, when fully discussed, will, no doubt, show some defects to be remedied; but we shall learn from them the means of tracing these complicated titles in both their times and heights, and of showing exactly the tidal condition of these sounds at every part of the ebb and flood. The observations made between 1846 and 1853, on the tidal currents of Nantucket shoals, have been discussed with great ability by Charles A. Schott, esq., of the computing division; and, as his method is quite original, I give his report or memoir in full in the Appendix No. 48. In it he discusses succinctly the folи lowing poi1its: The nature of the currents, their direction at flood and ebb, the direction or set at the several stations of observation, the velocity or drift at each station, the "current establishment," or relation of the time of greatest flood and ebb current to the time of the moon's transit, and the curve described by a particle of water during the entire flood and ebb. In regard to the first question 1 l\fr. Schott shows that the currents are tidal, simply, and not mixed with any general current. "The general features of the current across the shoals are as follows: The ebb commences a short time before the high-water stand on the shore of Nantucket takes place, and runs a little to the eastward of south, with no indications of slack water; it then attains gradually its greatest velocity in a direction to the westward and southward; after this the current slackens-the minimum velocity being about one-fourth the maximum-and runs a little to the westward of north, and then in an opposite direction to that of the ebb, thus completing an entire circuit. The current may be observed to set in all directions of the compass during twelve lunar hours without ever being at rest, and turning in a direction in which we count our azimuths, or like the hands of a watch." This is the main current outside, not the short current. In reference to the second head, the general direction of the current is that of the shore; except, near the old South shoal, where there is a tendency of the current in the direction of the longest line of the shoals. For nearly three hours, about the time of greatest velocity of ebb or flood, the current deviates but little in direction; this point is, therefore, well established. The average direction at greatest velocity of flood and ebb are so nearly opposite, that they may be taken as exactly so, and give for the direction or set of flood of the northern group of stations, (see Sketch A, No. 12,) N. 32░ E., (or northeast by north,) and in the southern group E. 13░ N., (east by north.) The curves drawn indicate the directions over the whole space; those for the flood and ebb currents are distinguished as stated on the chart. The remark which was made in reference to the change of direction near the period of greatest velocity, applies also to the velocity, so that this also was determined to a near approximation. The velocities, as a rule, increase as the general depth increases-that is, as the place is more distant from the island of Nantucket. Dividing the stations into two groups-one just off the islatid, and the other at a distance, separated by a line shown on the chart-the greatest drift of the near stations is 1. 7 knots for both flood and ebb current, and for the more distant 2.8 knots for flood, and 2.2 knots for ebb. The greatest velocity observed was four knots on the southern part of

Fishing Rip, on the 2d of August, 1852. From the approximate tidal data, :Mr. Schott next investigates the foterval between the times of greatest flood aml ebh current, and the moon's transit next preceding; obtaining an interval which, from the analogy with the " establishment'' for tides, he calls the "current establishment." These, of course, are at ihe present only approximate. They cannot fail, however, to be useful, practical data, and the lines of equal-current interval, or "co-current lines," drawn upon the charts for flood and ebL, show the progressive changes of the currents from place to place. To obtain these establishments, the observations at the different stations are grouped as explained in the report, and as marked on the chart. The mean interval between the time of moon's transit and high water (or mean tidal establishment) at Siaseonsett, is about 11 hours 53 minutes. The "currcut establishment" of group VII is 10 hours 22 minutes, or the current at the locality of group YII changes I hour 31 minutes~ on the average, before the water begins to fall, or rise, at Siasconsett. Tracing the motion of a particle of water, 'vhich is equivaleut to tracing the motion of a floating ohject influenced only by the current, leads to the conclusion that an ornl is described, of "иhich the greatest axis is from four to six times the less, an cl to the important practical conclusions that "a vessel cannot be i;et on any of tlie /jlwali; by tlte current alone, 'if 'i░ts distance from i't e.ccceeds the len[!th of tli.c mr{jor ax1's of ?notion," or about nine nautical miles for the outer groups, and six miles for the inner. Ghronorncte1и expecUtions.-During the year, George P. Bond, esq., has completed the computations of the observations made during the years 1849-'50 and 1851, for the difference of longitude between Cambridge and Liverpool, to furnish a difference of longitude from a well-ascertained European observatory and the points upon our coast. The expedition had been under the immediate direction of William Cranch Bond, esq., astronomer of Harvard 1.:-niversity; and a very elaborate plan of computation had been agreed upon on consultation between Mr. George P. Bond and myself, of which he had undertaken the execution. A preliminary report was presented in the appendix of my report of last year; and this year (Appendix Ko. 42) I gi~иe the final result, and Mr. Bond~s general report of the mode of arriving at it. The details of the expeditions, of the observations made during them, and of the modes of reduction, will be presented in one of the volumes of Coast Survey Records and Results, for the publication of which an appropriation was made at the last session of Congress. 'l'he resulting longitude, from these expeditions, for Harvard Observatory, Cambridge, is W. of Greenwich 47i. 44m. 30.66s. 2. n.20s. The difference of the results given by the expeditions of 1849-'50 and 1851 was 0.29s. The longitude derived from the eastern voyages is greater than that from the western by 3.02s. The cause of this Mr. Bond traces to the difierence in the temperature at sea and on shore, the complete examination of which, with the elimination, if possible, of personal equations, must be left to further observations. These are more than ever importaut from the conclusions to which we seem rorce~ in ~иegarcl to the present state of astronomical methods for longitude by the mvestigat10n of Professor Peirce. Report o.n measurement8 of heiglds.-The report of Captain T . .T. Cram, U. S. Topographical Engineers, Assistant in the Coast Survey, on the elaborate series of observat10ns made by him for measuring heights, has been in considerable part completed. ~he parts (numbered I, III, and IV) relating to the methods of levelling and their results, on the determinations by the barometer, and by the boiling-point apparatus, have been communicated to me. These observations and reductions 1nll he hereafter presented in detail in the Records and Hesults of the Coast Survey.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

They form a most valuable body of experiments and observations for reference by engineers and surveyors, and are directly available in the practice of our work. Their discussion alone is a work of very considerable labor. An abstract of the first part of his report, prepared by Captain Cram, is given in the Appendix No. 34. In part I, Captain Uram examines the theoretical considerations entering into levelling, and criticises some of the rules given for returning apparent level to true. He discusses the effect of unequal refraction on the apparent level, and shows how to get rid of it altogether, or to reduce it to a very small quantity, by cqui-distant fore and back sites-a method the advantages of which in the reductions of apparent to true level he points out. The precepts of this paper will be found valuable to observers. The determinations of heights were made by the level on forty-six lines, to serve as standards of comparison for other methods. They were selected to suit the conditions of investigation required by the other instruments, and comprised differences of height, up to 5,500 feet. Part II of the report is known to me only from the abstract given in Appendix No. 34; the work being not yet quite completed. It will contain obviously a very useful and interesting discussion of the formulm for determining heights by reciprocal vertical angles, and a searching investigation in reference to the co-efficient of refraction, and its variations, deduced from very numerous and varied observations. Part III of Captain Crarn's report begins with a description of the barometers which he used, (by Green, of New York,) their comparison with the Observatory standard at Cambridge, Massachusetts, (Newman's,) and the corrections to be applied to the observations with them. The importance of a careful study of the errors to which such measurements are liable is pointed out, especially at a time when so much reliance is placed on the barometer by parties making explorations requiring a considerable degree of exactness. The liability to change in the correction of a field barometer is pointed out, and the change measured of the one in use in the party. A division of the cases which occur in well-arranged determinations of heights by the barometer is laid down, and the best mode of reducing them shown. In reducing his results, Captain Cram uses the formulro given by Captain Lee, U. S. Topographical Engineers, in his collection of Tables and Formulre, (Barley's,) which is one of those containing no correction for moisture of the air. In the abstract, Appendix No. 34, will be found the comparative table of heights, determined in this way by the barometer and by the spirit-level; showing remarkable discrepancies, not only by amount, but in sign. Next the cases are treated in which one barometer only is used in determining the heights, and the various systematic methods are discussed, in which it is attempted to give the observations the effect of simultaneous ones. 'rhese are also compared with the heights by levelling in numerous instances. (See table, Appendix No. 34.) Another mode is discussed of using a simple barometer, in w.bich, making a single observation at a station, the observer passed to the next, thus making a single observation, and returning, and so back to the first station, and an extended comparison is made; and lastly the case is treated where the observer proceeds from station to station along the line, making one or several observations, but not retracing the line. (Appendix No. 34.) Among these comparisons is a series in which bench-marks at every five hundred feet of difference of elevation from the base of M.t. Washington to the summit were used, and another in which the differences were one hundred feet. The height assigned to this summit above the level of mean tide at Portland, by Captain Cram, from levelling, is 6,280 feet.

After a trial of the aneroid barometer, Captain Cram concludes that its workmanship, as now constructed, improves its usefulness to a great extent, and, from its convenienee and other good qualities, recommends that an effort be m.cde to give it all the perfection which nice instruments have attained, for a fair trial of its uses. Part IV of Captain Cram's report contains a full discussion of the use of the boiling-point apparatus, in the form given to it by Mr. \\' urdemann, using thermometers of the ordinary form, and also those specially made for it. His conclusions are very unfavorable to this method, the heights being as before con pared with those determined by the levelling instrument. (See table in Appendix .No. 34.) In regard to this instrument, Captain Cram remarks: "From some cause an opinion has obtained in the minds of persons that this is a more convenient instrument, on account of transportation, than the barometer. There can hardly be an idea more erroneous than this. Having used one extensively, in the most compact form that has been given to it, I find the following objections: "1. The apparatus, including all the necessary appendages, weighs quite aE much as the mountain barometer, if not more. "2. There are necessarily three different packages to carry-the boiling apparatus proper, a bottle of water, the box containi.ng the thermometers; and to these may be added a bottle of alcohol extra, and a blanket or screen to guard the instrument against the effects of wind while the water is being brought to the boilingpoint. To an observer accustomed to climbing a steep and rugged mountain, every additional package is a source of much annoyance. " 3. The time it takes for the water to boil is much greater than generally supposed by those who only try the experiment under the shelter of the roof and walls of a building. It varies, in the field, from half an hour to an hour and a quarter, depending upon the temperature and the wind. On a hill, where the wind is strong, I have been, with the best of matches, from a quarter to half an hour lighting the lamp, even with a blanket to screen it from the wind. This is vexatious. "4. After the boiling-point is attained, the apparatus is too hot, for at least twenty minutes, for handling, and time is lost waiting for it to cool, before it can be repacked for moving it to another station. In this cooling process, great precaution must be observed to allow it to go on gradually, and not remove the heated thermometer from the boiler until the mercury in the stem has all descended into the lower bulb. The want of the strictest attention to this circumstance is productive of serious vexation; for, without this precaution, ten to one the mercury will be found separated in the stem, ancl a small part will there stick and be troublesome. и "5. The instrument is far more frail than the barometer, requiring greater care in handling it to prevent breaking. And in the process of boiling there is much danger of the bulb bursting. This was a cause of serious loss in my experiments. "6. There is an inconvenience of no small magnitude in reference to the water to be boiled. If we boil one kind at the bottom and another at the top of the mountain, we incur the risk of an error. In my practice I carried along an extra bottle of water, so as to be sure of using the same kind at both stations, S and S1и I found a perceptible difference by actual experiment in the boiling-point of different waters under the same atmospheric influence. I suppose from this has arisen the idea of using distilled water. "Supposing, therefore, the instrument to give as good results-which it does notas the barometer, the foregoing objections are sufficient to place it far below the latter in point of practical convenience."

REPORT OF THE SIIPERINTENDENT

The defects inherent in the different parts of the instrument, as now made, are superadded to these considerations of comparative convenience, in causing its iиcjection from wse. The curves traced to show the heights given by these different methods in comparison with each other arc very instructive. Light-house examinations.-Examinations were made by Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, of the sites proposed for lighthouses at Eggemoggin Reach, between Penobscot and Jericho bays; of Isle au Haut thoroughfare, at Castine, on the Penobscot; Tenant's harbor, and the entrance of Damariscotta river, both between the Penobscot and Kennebeck; of Koddle's island, near Small Point harbor, Casco bay; and of Kennebunk, near Portland. A hydrographic reconnaissance of Eggemoggin Heach, which is the channel through which the greater part of the coasting trade east of the Penobscot passes, was made by Lieut. Comg. Craven-it is given in Sketch A, No. 2. His report on these examinations will be given in the Appendix Ko. G9. Besides these examinations, Assistant \Y. E. Greenwell made, for the Light-house Board, a survey of Baker's island, near Mount Desert; and Assistant S. A. Gilbert a survey of \V ood island and the adjacent shore, including Small Point harbor. This topographical survey was based on the triangulation of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle. The examination of a light-house site at Westport, Massachusetts, has been made by Lieut. Comg. H. S. Stellwagen and reported upon. (See Appendix No. 71.)

B.)

The triangulation of the Hudson has been continued to stations above Poughkeepsie, and points for the revised topography near the city have been furnished. The topography of the river has been carried up to Fort Montgomery, above Peekskill. The hydrography has kept pace with it; and a resurvey of the Hudson and East rivers at and near the city of Kew York has been made, to determine the changes in the harbor caused by those of the shore-line. Observations for latitude and azimuth, :rnd magnetic variation, dip, and intensity, have been made at Yard's station, Pennsylvania. Tidal observations have been continued at Governor's island, near New York. Current observations off the south side of Long Island have been made, and examinations for light-house sites in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware. .Astronomi"cal and magnetic observations.-Assistant J. E. Hilgard has occupied Yard's station, Chester county, Pennsylvania, and reports the following observations: "For latitude, thirty-one pairs of stars were observed, with from four to five nights' observations on each. The instrument used was a new zenith telescope by Wurdemann, (C. S. No. G,) of smaller ditnensions than those heretofore employed, th~ performance of which was found quite satisfactory. Determinations of value of micrometer and level were made as usual. "Observations of azimuth were made on Polaris with the two-feet theodolite, (C. S. No. 2,) two sets of observations being made in each of five positions of the instrument. "The requisite observations for time, in connection with the above, were made with the zenith telescope, which is constructed to serve for that purpose. "The magnetic observations, made at the same time, consist of three days' observations of declination and two determinations of absolute horizontal intensity, with declinometer No. 2, and two complete observations of dip, with a six-inch dip-circle belonginE to the Smithsonian Institution."

Observations were made as usual for moon culminations by Prof E. 0. Kendall, at the High School observatory, during the early part of the year. These were discontinued on the removal of the instruments, but will be resumed after they shall be finally adjusted at the new observatory. Prof. Kentlall's report on the number of observations will be fountl in Appendix No. 38 The solar eclipse of May 26th was observed by Assistant Edmund Blunt, at Brooklyn, L. I. (See Appendix Ko. 40.) Triangulation.-The triangulation of the Hudson river has been continued, by Assistant Edmund Blunt, from the limits of last season's work, line Crow's NestTompkins, to stations above Poughkeepsie. (See Sketch B.) The larger triangulation occupies the hills, and numerous points on the river banks are determined for the topography antl hydrography by the smaUer triangulation, which has its checks in the larger. From Tompkins station, on the south, to Yersalins, along the sides of the triangles, the distance is rather more than twenty-two miles. и Besides this work, Mr. Blunt has determined sixty-nine points, in the vicinity of New York, for the re-determination of the..shore-line, and the examination of changes in the hydrography there. The statistics of the season's work are as follows: Number of stations occupied near New York 10 Number of observations made near New York 854 Number of stations occupied on and near Hudson river 44 Number of observations made on and near Hudson river 2,787 Topography.-The topography of Hudson river was resumed at the southern limit of his last season's work by Assistant F. H. Gerdes, after his return from the Gulf of Mexico. From Sing Sing, which is included in the first sheet of the survey, it has been carried up to Anthony's Nose, several miles above Peekskill, and comprises both sides of the river. (See Sketch B.) In order to avoid delay in the hydrography, the topography of the district back of Haverstraw has been deferred, as also the filling up between the railroad and inner shore from Cruger's to Peekskill. The sheets of this season will comprise forty-one miles of shore-line, and an area of about forty-five square miles. Assistant Gerdes was occupied on this work between August 1 and September 20; and throughout furnished shore-line to the hydrographic party, which kept pace with his. He is at present engaged in the topography of the upper part of Manhattan island, and in determinations of the shore-line of the city for the new hydrography. His party is under instructions to resume work in Sections VII and VIII. Hydrography.-As soon in the spring as the necessary arrangements for the purpose could be made, I..ieut. Comg. Woodhull's party began a re-survey of the East and North rivers, near New York city, with a view to determine the changes which have occurred there since the previous survey. The work on the East river extended from Governor's island to Blackwell's island, and on the Hudson up to Fiftieth street, covering an area of about ten square miles closely sounded out. Eight thousand five hundred casts of the lead were ma.de, four hundred and fifty miles of soundings run, and six hundred and twenty-five angles measured. Wherever the slips were sufficiently unobstructed to render it practicable, the soundings were run within the space they enclose. Tides were observed, in connection with the soundings, at three positions; and six sets of current-observations were made on the Hudson, and seven in the East river. The hydtography will be plotted as soon as Mr. Gerdes can fur-

nish the shore-line, in the survey of which he is now engaged. When the Work above referred to was completed, the party was transferred to Section I. The hydrography of the Hudson has been conti1rned, as far as the means were available, during the present season, by Lieut. Comg. Richard Wainwright, U. S. N , assistant in the Coast Survey, in the schooner Nautilus. Leaving the Rappahannock river in July, tho party commenced work near Croton Point, and have accomplished about thirteen and a half miles in length of the river, to a line above Fort Montgomery, about five miles beyond Peekskill. The great width of the river at Haverstraw bay made the progress there comparatively slow, and the rapid current in the narrows above Peekskill, known as "the Race," made the sounding there difficult. Lieut. Comg. Wainwright reports a de_vth of twenty-eight fathoms in this part of the river. The following are the statistics of the hydrography: и Area covered Soundings run Angles taken Sound-ings taken 19 square miles.

On completing this work in October, the party returned to the Rappahannock river, to continue there until the close of the season. Tides.-The tidal observations at Governor's island, with the self-registering gauge, have been conti11ued. The arrangements made by Professor W. Gibbs, at th~ beginning of winter, to prevent the gauge from becoming obstructed by ice, were effective last winter. The series is reduced as the observations come in, and bids fair to give satisfactory results. Light-Jwuse surveys, cf:c.-Lieut: Comg. Stellwagen has made examinations for light house sites, &c., at Pine island in Fisher's lsland sound, at Niantic; Black Point; the end of the breakwater at Southport, Connecticut; and at Race Point and Horton's Point, in Long Island sound. Lieut. Comg. W00dhull has just completed the examinations required at Absecum bar, K J.; at Bowers' beach, between Murderkill and Jones' creeks, Delaware; and at the mouth of Old Duck creek, in Delaware bay. (See Appendix No. 68.)
SECTION III.-FROM CAPE HENLOPEN TO CAPE HENRY, INCLUDING THE COAST OF DELAWARE, MARYLAND, AND PART OF VIRGINIA. (SKETCH C.)

The survey has made very good progress in this section. The primary triangulation was reported as completed last year, and also the secondary of the outer coast of Maryland and Virginia. This year the secondary work on the James and Rappahannock rivers has been pushed forward from Richmond to Harrison's bar on the former, and from below l'ort Royal to Tappahannock on the latter. The topography of the outer coast of Virginia has been continued, the sheet between Metomkin and Wachapreague inlets being finished. The shores of the Rappahannock within the limits of the triangulation have been finished. Those of the Chesapeake from York river to Back river, and of the James river from Newport News to Warwick river, and from Day's Point to Craney island, have been surveyed. The shore-line of the entire Chesapeake bay proper has thus been completed. Work of verification on Patapsco Neek and Back river has been executed. The hydrography ha.s included the western part of the bay from the parallel of the head of Mobjack bay to near Cape Henry, finishing the bay itself and roads, and including the entrance of James river and the Elizabeth river, and harbors of Norfolk and Portsmouth. The hydrography of James River entrance, fron! the line Newport News-Craney island, to Warwick river-Day's Point, has been executed.

The hydrography of the Rappahannock from below Fredericksburg to I'ort Royal has been done, and will, before the c1ose of the season, be carried to the A re-survey of part of the Patapsco limits of t1iangnlation of last summer. entrance has been made by request of the Engineer department, without, however, any considerable changes being developed. The regular tidal observations have been kept up at Old Point Comfort, and special ones have been made at the Patapsco and James River entrances. The necessary computations have kept up with the field-work. In the drawing division of the office the chart of Chesapeake bay No. 1 is completed, No. 2 nearly so, and Nos. 3, 4, 5, and G, are in progress. A general chart of the bay on a smaller scale is also in progress. The map of the Appomattox has been completed; those of the James river from Richmond to Harrison's bar, and of the Rappahannock from Fredericksburg to Port Royal, are in progress. The sketch of the seacoast of Virginia No. 2 is completed. The following plates have been engraved during the year: Seacoast of Virginia No. 2, (upper part,) Sand Shoal inlet, Cape Charles, and the vicinity. Seacoast of Yirginia No. ~ (lower part) хas been commenced, and Chesapeake bay Kos. 1 and 2 are m progress. Astronondcal observations.-Obsenиations for difference of longitude between Roslyn station, at Petersburg, and De Rosset station, at \\'"ilmington, were commenced under the direction of Dr. B. A. Gould, jr., by himself and Assistant George vV. Dean, in April last. It was soon necessary to relieve Dr. Gould, who had been requested to observe the solar eclipse of May at Agamenticns, iu Mai11e, and :Mr. Pourtales took his place. The observations which then passed under my immediate direction are described under the head of Section IV. The station arran~e ments were made, and the instruments at Roslyn adjusted, by Assistant George \Y. Dean. . It is proper here to acknowledge the essentin.1 services received from Messrs. Dowell and Marks, of the telegraph office at Petersburg, to whose knowledge and willing aid we were indebted for so many facilities in executing the work. Observations of the solar eclipse of 1fay 26th were made by Assistant C. 0. Bou.tclle at the Seaton station, \.Vashington, assisted by Capt. J. L. Reno and Thomas McDonnell, esq , and by Assistant L. F. Pourtales, at Hoslyn station, near Peters-" burg. Their results are given in detail in Appendix No. 40. 11r. Boutelle observed with the telescope of the large vertical circle of Troughton and Simms, of the Coast Survey, the time being obtained by the astronomical clock intended for the Chilian observatory, kindly loaned by Lieut. J. }I. Gillis, U. S. N., ~nd noted by chronometers, for the use of which we are indebted to Lieut. M. F . ..Maury, director of the National Observatory. .Mr. Pourtales observed with telescope No. 10, C. S., time being noted on a chronometer compared with the Hardy clock iu use at the station. I was indebted to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to the superintendent of the Nautical Almanac, and to Professor Alexander, for copies of the map, computations, and notes on the phenomena to be observed, which were distributed to the assistants of the survey. The prompt publication and distribution of Professor Alexander's memoir, read before the American Association, by the editor of the Astronomical Journal, requires acknowledgment. A description of the meridian line marked by Assistant George W. Dean at Petersburg will be found in the Appendix No. 44. Primary triangulation, station point.s.-The primary triangulation of Chesapea~e bay having been completed by Assistant Edmund Blunt, the former assistant of his party, Lieut. A. H. Seward, U. S. A., иassistant in the Coast Survey, after his. return from Section VI, made an inspection of the triangulation points, with a view to

46

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

secure them. This important service has been properly performed, and nearly all the points may be considered as permanently marked, requiring examination, however, from time to time, for their preservation. Secondary triangulation.-The secondary triangulation between Richmond and City Point, at the junction of the James and Appomatox rivers, Virginia, (see Sketch 0,) was continued between the Gth of October and the 6th of January following, by Assistant John Farley, aided by Sub-Assistant J. R. Offiey. Mr. Offiey having been in the interval assigned to duty in Section VII, the triangulation was resumed by Assistant Farley in May, and completed by the 25th of July. The character of the banks of the James river was found to be unfavorable to the rapid execution of this work. During the indisposition of the assistant, who was, however, able to direct the operations of the party, Mr. Offiey measured fourteen angles in a chain of six triangles, by eight hundred and sixty measurements, with the ten-inch Gambey theodolite (C. S. No. 15) and Brunner theodolite, (C. S. No. 59.) The whole number of stations occupied during the year was twenty-two, the number of angles measured seventy-two, and observations made two thousand five hundred and four. Mr. Farley accompanied the chief engineer of the Richmond and York River railroad on a reconnaissance of York river, prior to commencing his work in the spring. A line of levels to connect the bench-marks of the tide-gauges at Racketts, below Richmond, Carl's Neck, and City Point, was run by Mr. Offiey. The party has suffered much from sickness during the season. The office-work, including the records and computations, has been executed by Mr. Farley, who is now engaged in continuing the triangulation of the James river, below City Point. Early in the season the triangulation on the Rappahannock, from a point just above Port Royal, was continued down the river to stations Baylor-Brick Quarter, below Tobago bay, by Captain W. R. Palmer, Topographical Engineers, assisted by Lieut. D. T. Van Buren, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey. (See Sketch C.) Between October 24 and December 10, ten stations were occupied, and sixty-five angles were measured upon sixteen objects by six hundred and seventeen observations. The triangulation coverg an area of sixteen and a, half square miles. This work has been very favorably reported upon by the computing division of the office, with reference to the closing of the triangles; and also by the topographical party, as furnishing suitable and numerous points for the plane-table survey. . The services of Lieut. Van Buren being required for the survey at the entrance of Savannah river, Lieut. G. H. Gordon, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, supplied his place in the party of Captain Palmer. The survey was resumed on the 27th of April, and prosecuted with energy and success until its close for the season on the 3d of July, below Tappahannock, at the line .Tones-Carter, about midway between Fredericksburg and the mouth of the river. The course of the river, throughout an extent of twenty-four miles, was included in a series of twenty-seven small triangles, in which the same number of stations were occupied, and ninety-one angles were measured, upon thirty-one objects, by one thousand eight hundred and eight observations, with the six-inch Brunner theodolite, C. S. No. 59. The total area comprised in the triangulation of the river since last season, is about forty-four square miles. The note-books and duplicates, and the computations, were duly deposited in the office. It is gratifying

to recognise the zeal, industry, fertility of resources, and accuracy which has characterized this triangulation. Captain Palmer is at present engaged in the further extension of the survev towards Chesapeake bay, having Lieut. J. P. Roy, U. S. A., as his assistant. иThe schooner Bancroft has Leen assigned for the transmission of the party and equipments. и Topography.-The pa,rty of Assistant H. L. Whiting was engaged at the date of my last annual report in the verification of topographical woiиk in Patapsco Neck, and continued operations until the 28th of November. Resuming the re-survey in April of the present year, it was extended to the northern shore of Back river, including the neck below a line from Stansbury's Point, on the southern shore, to Holly Point, on Middle river. (See Sketch C.) The topographical sheet embraces also ~filler's and Hart's islands, adjacent to Back River Neck and Pool's island. The statistics of the work are as follows: Shore-line, re-surveyed Roads, re-surveyed Included area, re-surveyed - 84 miles. - 5H miles. - 2G square miles.

Mr...Whiting next re~umed the topograpy of the coast of Massachusetts, i1ear Newburyport, Section I; and, after the close of the season in October, was instructed to return to the Chesapeake. In office-work a topographical sheet has been finis~ed of the survey of Patapsco river made. in the preceding season. Assistant George D. Wise has continued the topography of the seacoast of Yirginia, completing the sheet (see Sketch C,) between .Metomkin and Wachapreague inlets. The topography covers an area of thirty-five square miles, and includes thirty-three miles of shore-line. :Mr. Wisc reports that this sheet will be put in ink and turned into the office by the 1st of November; soon after which he will proceed to St. Andrew's bay, Section VII. Plane-table sheet No. 54, Back river, Chesapeake bay, (see Sketch C,) was continued by Sub-Assistant John Seib, and eleven miles of shore-line necessary to its completion determined"since the date of last season's report. In conformity with instructions, he next proceeded with the work of determining shore-line on the Rappahannock river, Virginia, and points for the hydrographic party which was to follow, and in the execution of general topography within the limits of the triangulation. (See Sketch C.) Between Falmouth, above Fredericksburg, and Corbin's Neck, an extent of fifteen miles by the river-course is included in this survey, the details of whi.ch are as follows: Shore-line Roads Area ..

The topography occupied the party two months succeeding the 25th of October. During the winter their topographical sheet was put in ink, and deposited in the office. In April Mr. Seib resumed his work on the Rappahannock, and completed the topog:aphy from above Port Royal to Tobago bay. (See Sketch C) I~e thus describes the topography of this part of the Rappahannock: "The nver. is narrow in many places, and the determination of its shores difficult. On one side the banks are high, steep, and wooded ; on the other low and swampy,и alternately.

48

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

But the topography is very pretty and varying. There are fine hills and bankssome us high asи one hundred and sixty feet, und then again large plains of small height." The limits of the sheets containing this survey are shown on the sketch. They contain fifty-four miles of shore-line, and an area of sixteen square miles. After indispensable repairs were made to the schoouer \Yave, useu for ihe transportation of his party, l\Ir. Seib resumed his work on the Chesapeake, at York Hiver entrance, (see Sketch C,) carrying it from Roek Point, in Mobjack bay, to Back river, (Sheets Nos. 52 and 53,) and furnishing the shore-line to the party of Lieut. Comg. Almy, working in the vicinity. This work covers an urea of eleven miles, and furnished one hundred and one miles of shore-line. Mr. Scib's next work иwas at James River entrance, (see Sketch C, sheets 57 and 58,) the shore-line of both sides of which, from Newport News to Warwick river on the uorth, and from abreast of Craney island to Day's Point on the south bank, was furnished Lo the party of J,ieut. Comg . .Maffitt, who had commenced the hydrography of the river. The hydrographic signals, houses, and other objects, which might be useful in the hydrography, were determined by Mr. Seib. The shore-line thus mapped was forty-four miles in extent. l\lr. Seib also determined the shore-line of Elizabeth river for the hydrographic party of Lieut. Corng. Almy, furnishing ulso numerous points for working, and adding thirty-one and a half miles to the shore-line already determined by him. The total shore-line determined by Mr. Seib this season, and for immediate use by the hydrographic parties, has been two hundred and thirty miles-a most excellent season's work. Hydrography.-By request of the Chief Engineer, General Totten, a re-survey was made of a portion of the entrance of the Patapso river, inclu<lrng the Bodkin channel, with a view to the decir;ion of a qu~stion in regard to the best line for dredging. Capt. Henry Brewerton, of the Corps of Engineers, at whose suggestion the survey was made by a hydrographic party of the Coast Survey, furnished a steam-tug for executing the work; and the party of Lieut. Corng. Richard Wainwright, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, was employed in making it, and in plotting the work as finished. Tidal observations were made at the Bodkin lighthouse for thirty days, day and night; and the soundings were referred, through one of the observed low-waters, to a bench-mark on the light-house. The channels and shoaJs appear to have changed but little since the survey in 1845, by the late Lieut. George .M. Bache, U. S. N. ; the two surveys not differing more than "must necessarily occur in making two separate surveys of a place showing such peculiar irregularities of bottom." The finished hydrography of the Rappahannock river, for the Engineer department, has been carried to a point about six miles below Port Royal by the party of I,ieut. Comg \Vainwright. This officer, in command of the schooner Nautilus, commenced operations on the 2d of June, and extended the work as far as the limits of the plane-table survey. In its prosecution, he reports having run one hundred and thirty-eight miles of soundings, measured five hundred and ninety-five angles, and made nineteen hundred. and sixty-one casts of the lead. Lieut. Co mg. Wainwright has since been engaged in the survey of the Hudson, a notice of which is given in Section II. He has now returned to the Rappahannock to continue the hydrography. The hydro;;raphy of the Chesapeake bay has been completed during the present season, by Lieutenant Comg. J. J. Almy, in the steamer Hetzel and schooner Graham. The work begins at the head of M:objack bay, and thence passes to the limits of last season's bydrographic sheets, at the middle of the bay, and, connecting with

the work of 1852 and 1853, continues to Cape Henry, embracing Lynn Haver and Hampton roads, Elizabeth river and harbor of Norfolk and Portsmouth, to th( line of Craney Point, New Point Comfort, where it joins the work of Lieut. C иmg. Maffitt. The area closely sounded over is two hundred and forty-five square I::ileo>. The following statistics are reported: "One thousand six hundred and eightyиfeYen nautical miles have been run in sounding; seventy thousand two hundred and sixtynine soundings have been taken, in from one foot to seventeen fathoms Wllter; one thousand angles have been measured with theodolites for hydrographical position, and four thousand two hundred and ninety-four angles with sextants for the same purpose; one hundred and twenty-six high and the same number of low tides have been observed; and the number of tidal observations is four thousand seven hundred and forty-seven. Twenty specimens of bottom have been taken, ten current stations have been occupied, twenty currents observed, and three hundred and twenty-seven current observations have been taken." An interesting notice of the increasing commerce of the lower part of Chesapeake bay, by Lieut. Comg. Almy, is given in Appendix No. 24. This party had the occasion to render assistance to two vessels in distress, for which they received hearty thanks. The announcement in regard to York Spit and New Point shoal is given from Lieut. Comg. Almy's special report on the subject, in Appendix No. 12. Seven sheets of the work executed by this party in 1853 have been finished and turned into the office, viz:
~eacoast of Virginia, from Hog island to Cape Henry Chesapeake bay north, from Cape Henry, east side Chesapeake bay, from Wolf Trap to New Point Comfort light Sand Shoal inlet, coast of Virgima Ship Shoal inlet, coast of Virginia Occohann1Jck creek, Chesapeake bay Hunger's and adjacent creeks, Chesapeake bay -

The tide-books and records of soundings and angles have been copied and deposited in the archives. The hydrography of James river, near its entrance, was commenced, at the close of his work in Section V, by Lieut. Comg. J. N. Maffitt, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, and has been carried from the limits of Lieut. Comg. Almy's work up the James to Warwick river. Special tidal observations have heen made in connection with the work. Tides.-The regular series of tidal observations has been kept up at Old Point Comfort, with the Saxton self-registering gauge. Special observations at the Bodkin and James river have been made under the direction of Lieuts. Comg. Wainwright and Maffitt. An attempt was made to put up a pipe-gauge, with register attached, similar to the one used at Nantucket, at Cape Henry, for comparison with that at Old Point; but it proved unsuccessful. The reduction of the Old Point observations by Mr. Lubbock's method, and the comparison with theory, is nearly completed. One of the James River stations has been reduced by Prof. Airy's method for comparison with the theory of river t;des.
SECTION IV.-FROM CAPE HENRY TO CAPE FEAR, INCLUDING PART OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROи LIN.A. (SKETCH D.)

both places-the first-named as a link in the cha-in for difference of longitude by telegraph between Washington and New Orleans. The secondary triangulation has been carried northward towards Cape Henry, Virginia, and southward towards Cape Fear, North Carolina, and that of the Cape Fear river has been finished. The topography has kept up with the triangulation in the upper part of Currituck sound, and has been carried from Cape Lookout to include Beaufort harbor, Shep-. herd's Point and the opposite banks, and part of the shores of Bogue sound. The ' hydrography of Beaufort harbor has been executed in the most thorough manner, and the results (including a report from the accomplished hydrographic officer making the survey) furnished to the honorable Secretary of the Navy, at whose request the immediate execution of the hydrography was undertaken. A reconnaissance of the dangerous shoals north of Hatteras, known as the Wimble shoals, has been made. Tidal observations have been made at Fort Macon, Beaufort harbor, in connection with those at Cape Lookout, and a self-registering tide-gauge has been established at Baldhead, Cape Fear entrance. Projects have been made for a complete chart of Cape Fear entrance and approaches, and of Cape Fear river to the head of Eagle's island, and the drawing has been commenced. The drawing of Beaufort harbor has made progress. The drawing of Albemarle sound, sheet No. 1, is nearly completed. Sketches of Beaufort bar and Wimble shoals have been drawn. The engraving of Albemarle sound, No. 1, has made considerable progress, and the sketches just referred to will be completed for the present report. The engraving of the Beaufort chart is in progress. .Astronomical observations.-The longitude station at Raleigh, North Carolina, was again occupied to make a connection for telegraphic difference of longitude between Washington and New Orleans, by uniting Raleigh with Columbia, South Carolina. It was intended that Assistant George W. Dean should occupy the Raleigh station, and Dr. B. A. Gould, jr., the station at Columbia, and that after sending and receiving telegraph signals for transits of stars, according to the programme previously arranged by Dr. Gould, they should exchange stations and again observe. The telegraph line was so rarely in condition to afford the desired facilities for working, that it became necessary to depart, in a degree, from the contemplated arwngement. A certain number of transits were, however, exchanged, and personal equations were compared at Columbia before and after the exchange of transits by telegraph, by the observers both repairing to that station. These observations are now in the hands of Dr. Gould for reduction, and a detailed notice of them will be found in his report, Appendix No. 41. The latitude of Raleigh was determined by Dr. Gould, with zenith telescope No. 2, in 1853. While at Raleigh, Assistant George W. Dean observed for the magnetic variation, intensity, and dip; the two former with the portable apparatus of the British Association, C. S. No. 1, ( declinometer D 22, Jones,) and the latter with a ten-inch dip-circle (C. S. No. 4) by Barrow. One hundred and :five observations, on five different days, were made for variation, and ten sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia on the other days. The dip was determined by four sets of observations on four different days. Mr. Dean established at Raleigh a meridian-mark, which may be very useful for future reference, especially in surveys made by the compass. It is described in Appendix No. 44, which contains extracts from his report. Observations for difference of longitude between Wilmington and Petersburg, and at Wilmington, for latitude and azimuth, were made chiefly under my immediate direction between the 8th of May and the 28th of June. The stations at Roslyn, near Petersburg, and De Rasset, in Wilmington, were prepared under the

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST S'C'RVEY FOR 1854.

51

direction of Dr. B. A. Gould, jr., and Assistant G. W. Dean; and when Dr. Gould was relieved to observe in Section I, the eclipse of May 26th, Assistant L. F. Pourtales took his place at Roslyn, and the operations passed under my direction. An extended programme for examining the various circumstances influencing the observations had been arranged by Dr. Gould, to which I added one for examining the possible influence of inductive currents. The matter of personal equation had entered largely into our views in maturing the entire programme, and but for the condition of the telegraph line, quite a complete experimental series would have been executed. As it was, the perseverance of Mr. Pourtales and Mr. Dean executed a considerable part of what had been laid out, notwithstanding the advanced state of the season. I was indebted to .Mr. Dean for very complete mechanical arrangements, requisite for the observations proposed to be made on the eclipse and recorded upon the telegraphic register; but the day proved entirely unfavorable, the sun being obscured by clouds at the beginning and end of the eclipse, and showing itself at but rare intervals during its progress. Star signals were exchanged between Mr. Pourtales, at Roslyn, and Mr. Dean, at De Rosset, on the 27th of May, and 6th of June, when they exchanged stations, and again worked successfully on the 20th and 23d of June. In the intermediate time various experimental trials were made with the line, which must in all probability give interesting results from their discussion, though there were unexpected difficulties in the execution of the programme, from causes beyond the control of the parties and of the telegraph operators. Mr. Dean, before closing work, returned to Wilmington, and compared personal equations with Mr. Pourtales. We were indebted to Messrs. Carleton, Bingham, and Lumsden, the operators in the telegraph office at Wilmington, for much assistance in connecting the station with Roslyn, and in offering every facility for our experiments, in the success of which they took great interest. The observations for latitude at Wilmington, by Assistant George W. Dean, consisted of two hundred and three observations on forty-one pairs of stars, with the zenith telescope No. 5, C. S., from the Greenwich Twelve-year Catalogue, and that of the British Association; two hundred and fifty observations upon 51 Cephei at elongation, for the value of the micrometer screw; and fifty-two upon a collimator, for the value of the divisions of the level. One hundred and two observations for magnetic variation were made on four different days with declinometer No. 1, C. S., (D. 22, Jones;) two sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia; and two sets with the ten-inch Barrow dip-circle (C. S. No. 4) on two different days. Mr. Dean placed a meridian-mark at Wilmington, by which a ready comparison of the variation of the compass may at any time be made. It is described in Appendix No. 44. The azimuth observations were made by Assistant C. P. Bolles, on Polaris at elongation, with the two-foot theodolite, (C. S. No. 2.) The arrangements of the buildings at the stations were made by Thomas McDonnell, artificer. We were specially indebted to the liberal and kind attentions of public-spirited citizens of Wilmington for great facilities in the execution of this work. As they are public officers, we may be permitted to mention the names of General McRae, president of the Wilmington and Raleigh railroad, and J. L. Fleming, esq., chief engineer of the Wilmington and Manchester road. Secondary triangиulation.-The triangulation has been carried southward from Beaufort harbor, twenty-five miles along the coast, by Sub-Assistant A. S. ~ads worth. The chain of triangles, as shown in Sketch D, crossing from one side of

52

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Bogue sound to the other, will afford hydrographic points by openings through the ridge of woods bordering on the ocean. This work, which followed the topography of the southern part of Beaufort harbor, was begun on the 14th of February, and completed on the 2d of May. Additional points were, in the mean time, furnished to the hydrographic party working in Beaufort harbor. The area covered by the triangulation is fifty square miles, in which twenty- и three stations were occupied; and, in connecting twenty-eight objects, seventy-nine angles were measured by two thousand seven hundred and eighty (2,780) observations, with a six-inch Gambey repeating theodolite. The weather was unfavoruble for work during the season. The stations have been marked in a manner which, in the opiniou of Mr. Wadsworth, must insure their permanence. The facilities afforded and difficulties presented by the country over which he passed, for the extension of the main chain of triangles, were examined by :Mr. Wadsworth; also the possibility of procuring frequent bases suited to a small main triangulation, in case that system should be finally resorted to. On closing his operations and having completed his computations, Mr. Wadsworth reported at the office, and was assigned to the topographical work in Section I, near York harbor, Maine. , The triangulation of Currituck sound, and reconnaissance for its extension up Back bay, connected with the former, (see Sketch D) have been continued by the party of Assistant J. J. S. Hassler. Extending northward along the coast of North Carolina from the opening of Albemarle sound, seventeen stations were occupied, (some of them, however, for the second time,) exclusive of several subsidiary points used in their connection. The result of the reconnaissance, which during the season was carried across the Virginia line, will be the connection between this triangulation and that terminating at Cape Henry. The extension of the triangulation has been in a degree delayed by the necessity for remeasuring certain angles, by the difficult character of the country, and the unusually stormy weather of the season. Mr. Hassler reports twelve stations determined by two thousand one hundred and eighty-four (2)84) observations, and enclosing au area of seventy-five square miles. In addition to this regular work, six hydrographic points south of Cape Henry were determined by Mr. Hassler for the party of Lieut. Comg. Almy. Topography.-The topography of Beaufort harbor was ext.,nded southward, and that of Bogue sound in connection with it, commenced by Sub-Assistant A. S. Wadsworth. The sheet embracing his work is marked on Sketch D, No. 4. This party was organized in December, but owing to an accident to the vessel carrying the instruments and equipments, actual operations were not begun until the 14th of January. The sheet was completed on the 9th of Februa.ry, put in ink and sent to the office, in order that the chart of Beaufort harbor might be early taken in hand. It includes thirty-five miles of shore-line and an area of five and a half square miles. Mr. D. E. Montgomery served as aid in this party. Hydrography.-Supplementary work on the Cape Fear bars and entrance was executed by the party of Lieut. Comg. :Maffitt, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Surи vey, in the autumn of 1853, when the sailing-vessel which had been used by his party was transferred to another, and the steam.er Legare was fitted out for his use. The repairs required by the steamer proving much greater than had been expected, the party was detained in making them until the middle of February, when they

proceeded to Beaufort for a complete survey of that harbor and its ap11roaches. The party next proceeded to Cha<cston harbor, where they re-surveyed ~[nffitf s or the Sullivan's Island channel, obtaining results of much importance, which will be noticed under the head of hydrography in Section V. An interesting report on Beaufort harbor by Lieut. Comg. :Maffitt wi11 be found in Appendix No. 14. It shows the great value and importance of that harbor; proves that the depth has been nearly permanent in all changes of position of the main channel from the earliest records; points out the perfoctly protected character of its roads, and its facilities for the purposes of a naval depot, accessible at high water by "sloops-of-war and second-class steamers, while brigs, schooners, and third-class steamers could come in at any stage of the tide." There is at present nearly sixteen feet of water upon the bar, (a sketch of which accompanies Lieut. Comg. Maffitt's report,) and the distance across it is but three hundred and seven (307) yards; the depth rapidly passes to three and a quarter and three and a half fathoms. The average rise and fall of the tide is four and a half feet, so that ;tt high water there is twenty feet on the bar. The wearing away of Shackelford's Point, at the entrance to Beaufort harbor, is pointed out by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, and its probable consequences clearly shown. "The geographical position of Beaufort is favorable, not only for the purposes of commerce, but as offering protection during northeast and eastwardly storms. Cape Lookout affords a natural breakwater in gales from those points, with excellent and well-protected anchorage under the land, the light-house bearing east. 11 In the hydrography of Beaufort approaches, entrance, and harbor, seven hundred and eighty-five miles of soundings were run, two thousand seven hundred and fifty-five angles observed for positions of soundings, 37,2{)0 casts of the lead made, thirty-four specimens of the bottom procured, and sixteen current stations occupied. As office-work, the party has completed two sheets of Beaufort entrance and approaches, and two others of Beaufort harbor, scale nhll, besides current diaи grams and tables. I visited this party while engaged in the survey of Beaufort harbor, taking the opportunity, when inspecting the progress of the operations, to become personally familiar with the localities under survey. It was intended to make a complete survey of that part of the coast of North Carolina between Nag's Head and Hatteras, including, especially, the dangerous Wimble shoals; and Lieut. Comg. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, in the steamer Corwin, had actually commenced the work, when the cholera broke out on board his vessel, and he was obliged to leave the section, after completing a reconnaissance of the Wimble shoals, on which he gives three fathoms as probably the least depth. J,ieut. Comg. Craven's report, with a description of the shoals, is given in Appendix No. 13, and a sketch of the reconnaissance, marked D, No. 3. T,ides.-Observations were made by Mr. F. Muhr at Hatteras inlet, and, in conи sequence of the many irregularities which they seemed to show in the tides, were continued for four months. Cape Lookout not affording proper facilities for tidal observations, it was deterи mined to have a regular series made in Beaufort harbor, and a comparative set at Cape Lookout, observing day-tides when the sea was smooth. The series at Beauи fort was kept up for three months and a half, and that at Cape Lookout for about three months. At Baldhead, Cape Fear entrance, advantage was taken of the wharf constructed by Captain D. P. W oodbnry, of the Corps of Engineers, in charge of the improvement of Cape Fear entrance, to erect a Saxton self-registering_ tidegauge so that a complete comparison might be made with the elaborate sen~s ?f tidal ~bservations by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt at Smithville. This gauge is still m

operation. It was put up by Assistant George A. Fairfield, in charge of the tidal series along the coast, and has, with some int rmissions, worked well. A line of levels was run by Lieut. D. T. Van Buren, U. S. A., connecting the bench-marks of the tidal stations at Wilmington and Smithville.
SECTION Y.-FRO.ll CAPE FEAR TO THE ST. MARY'S RIVER, INCLUDING THE COAST OF THE STA.TES

OF SOUTH CAROLINA AKD GEORGIA.

(SKETCH E.)

Six parties have been employed in this section, and generally during the whole of the season. The reconnaissance from the Ashley river to the Santee has been made. The latitude, approximate longitude, and magnetic elements of Georgetown, were determined. The difference of longitude between Columbia, South Carolina, and Raleigh, North Carolina, has been ascertained by telegraph, and latitude and magnetic observations have been made at Columbia. The primary triangulation, and secondary connected with it, has advanced eastward. The triangulation of Sa,vannah River entrance and of Calibogue sound to May river has been completed. The topography between the Stono and North Edisto has made good progress. Some hydrography in Charleston harbor and at the entrance of the Savannah river has been executed. Tidal observations have been made near Charleston light-house and in the harbor, and a gauge established at St. Simons. A communication to the Engineer department from. Captain A. H. Bowman, of the Corps of Engineers, called my attention to the probability that changes had occurred in the channel near Sullivan's island, known as Maffitt's channel, and I accordingly directed Lieut. Comg. Maffitt to make the re-examination of this channel and its approaches. Very remarkable changes were developed by the resurvey, tending to render the channel much more available even than when recommended for improvement in 1852. A chart exhibiting these changes accompanies this report, Sketch E, No. 4. By request of the Engineer department, I served with Lieut. Davis, U. S. N., and Captain J. F. Gilmer, U. S. Corps of Engineers, on a commission to re-examine the plans of improvement which had previously been suggested, and visited Charleston for that purpose in the latter part of the month of June, returning to Wilmington, North Carolina, on the completion of the examination and report of the commission. The services rendered by Lieut. Comg. Maffitt and the officers of his party, then in Charleston harbor, in facilitating the work of the commission, and in making current and other observations, were very valuable. To the efficiency of his arrangements and knowledge of localities and changes they owed, in a considerable degree, the promptness with which they were able to arrive at their conclusions. Maffitt's channel itself (see Sketch D) was found to have moved northward while retaining its general direction, to have diminished in width, and slightly increased in depth. The bulkhead closing the west end of it near Bowman's jettee had much diminished in width, and the average depth on the bulkhead had increased nearly two feet. A drawing has been made during the year of the re-survey of Maffitt's channel, and a comparative map of this and former surveys prepared; these have been engraved. The drawing of the chart of Georgetown harbor and of Tybee entrance and Savannah river has been commenced. The engraving of the preliminary chart of Charleston harbor has been nearly completed, and the drawing of the final chart will soon be commenced. The sketches of progress in this section have been remodelled and engraved. Reconnaissance.-A reconnaissance of the coast of South Carolina, from the Ashley river to the Santee, meeting there his former work, has been made by Brevet .Major Henry Prince, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey. Within these limits

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 18!i4.

the relative positions of many intermediate points were examined with reference to their connection by triangulation. These include Cape Roman, Bull's island, Eagle island, Racoon keys, and numerous localities within a range several miles in breadth, extending along the coast. Much minute and valuable information is, as usual, contained in .Major Prince's report, which serves to give definite ideas as to the character of the operations northward from Charleston. Astronomical and ma,qnetic observations.-The party of Assistant C. 0. Boutelle encamped in the last week of Noven91iat Allston station, near Georgetown, South Carolina, and were there engaged in the usual routine of an astronomical station until the 25th of January. Observations for latitude, azimuth, local time, and for magnetic declination and intensity, were made. For difference of longitude five chronometers were transported between Allston station and Professor Lewis R. Gibbes' observatory in Charleston. The party consjsted of Lieut. A. W. Evans, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, who joined it on the 22d of December; Sub-Assistant B. Huger, jr., and Mr. F. P. Webber, the latter transferred from the party of Captain Cram in November The observatory at Allston was completed on the 13th of December, between which time and January 21-on twenty-six nights-six hundred and ninety-eight observations for latitude were made upon one hundred and fourteen stars, with the zenith telescope C. S. No. 5, ('Yiirdemann.) Of these, thirty-nine stars were from the Greenwich Twelve-year Catalogue. On thirty-two nights, between December 10th and January 24th, three hundred and twenty-five transits of fifty-two stars were observed with C. S. transit No. 4. Observations for azimuth were made between the 1st and 17th January, with the two-feet theodolite C. S. No. 2, in the usual manner, upon Polaris at elongationfive eastern and six western elongations being observed; three hundred and two observations were made on the star and mark, and on thirteen objects; twelve angles were measured by two hundred and eleven observations, to connect the observed azimuths with the secondary triangulation of Winyah bay. For magnetic declination one hundred and eighty-eight half-hourly readings were taken on eight days with declinometer, D- 22; sixty-four observations of deflection and eighty-four of vibration were made on three days, and sixty-four observations for dip on two days. The approximate magnetic variation at Allston station is 2░ 07' east. Five journeys, each with five chronometers, from Allston statioJ'. to Charleston, and four journeys, with five chronometers, from Charleston to Allston, were made between January 4th and 25th, giving in all forty-five results for difference of longitude. Observations for local time at Charleston were made by Professor Lewis R. Gibbes, but under very unfavorable circumstances of weather. On completing th.e astronomical field-work, the party returned to Charleston, preparatory to resummg the triangulation of the section. Duplicates of all the observations at Allston were made at the geodetic station, ~nd have been deposited in the Coast Survey Office. The computations are now m progress. Observations for difference of longitude between Columbia and Raleigh were commenced by Dr. B. A. Gould at the former, and Assistant George W. Dean at the latter place, in January; the observers exchanging stations on the 13th of February, to eliminate the effect of personal equations, and the work being cl?sed on the 14th of ~larch. Full details of the observations at these places arc gnren by Dr. Gould in his report, (Appendix No. 41,) in which will also be found interesting remarks on the conditions requisite to insure the transmission of signals by the

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

telegraph line, and their reception at its extremities; on the disturbance by currents, induced by discharges of atmospheric electricity, even when distant from the line; and on the progress of the application in Europe of the electro-magnetic telegraph to determinations of longitude. The self-sustaining galvanic battery, invented by .Mr. .Mathiot, of the Coast Survey, is highly praised for its efficiency by Dr. Gould. A description has been prepared, and is appended to this report, (Appendix Ko. 56.) The use made of the valuable "criterion for the rejection of doubtful observations" by Professor Peirce will prove of very considerable interest, and the tables for its ready use, furnished by Dr. Gould, Appendix No. 41, will be found of great value to observers generally. At the Columbia station a double series of observations for latitude was made for the purpose of clearing up the difficulty found at Sebattis last year, by Assistant J. E. Hilgard, (see Coast Survey Report for 1853, page 28,) where the different observers, using different instruments, and observing the same pairs of stars, found latitudes differing by a small but noticeable amount. The zenith telescopes (Nos. 2 and 5, C. S.) were employed, and the same stars (twenty-five pairs) were observed with each by Dr. Gould and by .Mr. Dean. Each series on the several pairs consisted of five observations by each observer-a number which had been found to give a probable error of observation of but 0.2". The value of the micrometer of zenith telescope No. 2 was determined by each observer, by two hundred and twenty observations of Polaris at eastern and western elongation, and of No. 5 by two hundred and forty-four observations of Polaris, and 51 Cephei, at elongations. The values of the level diyisions were determined by fifty observations with the micrometer or collimator adjusted to a sidereal focus, and placed a few feet from the zenith telescope. The magnetic determinations were made in the southwestern part of the Capitol square. They consisted of one hundred and fifteen observations for variation, on five different days, with declinometer No. 22 Jones, (No. 1 C. S.;) two sets for horizontal intensity and moment of inertia, on two days; and three sets for dip, with the ten-inch Barrow dip-circle, (C. S. No. 4,) on three different days. It was expected to extend the telegraph operations to Macon, Georgia, this season; but the various impediments from storms which interrupted the working of the line, from business on the line, and from bad weather, had so far protracted the work as to render this impossible. Mr. McDonnell lra.s prcpar~d the station at Macon for occupation next season. и On the 28th of March I visited the station, and found a very neat and effective set of arrangements for the work. Primary and secondary triangulati'on.-On completing the astronomical fieldwork at Allston, as before noticed, Assistant C. 0. Boutelle transferred his camp to Elliott's Cut, a central point in the triangulation, laid out for the season. (See Sketch E.) The secondary triangulation has been extended up Wando river to Daniell's island, and northeasterly along the coast to include Long island, north of the entrance to Charleston harbor. New points on the seacoast were determined where the old ones had been washed away by the severe storms of December and January. The primary line from Elliott's Cut to Daniell's island was traced across Charleston Neck-a very difficult work, on account of the great number of intervening residences and ornamental trees; and that from Elliott's Cut to Breach inlet was opened. Three primary stations were occupied, and thirty-two angles were determined upon forty objects by 3,451 observations. Eighteen secondary stations were occupied, at which eighty-four angles were measured upon ninety-two objects by 1,060 .observations. This work was executed between the 24th of February and the

13th of May; but during the greater part of :March, observations were much hindered by haze. A small part only of secondary triangulation necessary to connect the triangulation of Wadmelaw sound with that of ~tono river is yet required; some cutting, however, will be necessary in its execution. The connection of the work in Charleston harbor with the triangulation from the Edisto base is now complete through both the primary and secondary series. The camp at Elliott's Cut was broken up on the 5th of May; but Sub-Assistant Huger continued the secondary triangulation of Long island until the 13th, in the schooner Bancroft, which had been in charge of the party since the 15th of December. Assistant Boutelle reported at the office in Washington, where, as already stated, (Section III,) he observed the solar eclipse of May 26th. Since then he has been engaged in the computation and' reduction of his work in this section, and, as noticed in its place, in the secondary triangulation in Section I. I visited Mr. Boutelle's station at Elliott's Cut during the season, and went over some of the ground of the secondary work with him. Lieut. D. T. Van Buren, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, has completed the secondary triangulation on Tybee bay, including Savannah River entrance from the junction with the work of the previous season by Captain B. 0. C. Ord, U.S. A., and that on Calibogue sound as far as May river. (See Sketch E, Ko. 2.) This survey extends over level tracts intersected by numerous navigable creeks. Lieut. Van Buren remarks: "Many of these creeks are navigated at all times, and most of them when the tide serves. Thus, Cooper river is used by the steamers taking the inland route between Savannah and Charleston; these same steamers touching at Bluffton, a town of considerable trade in cotton, &c., the town being situated on May river, about five miles from its entrance into Calibogue sound." The party have had the use during the season of the schooner "Meredith," for transportation. This party was visited by me during the season, and, by request of the Savannah Chamber of Commerce, I gave directions for the survey of the inland passes near Romney marshes; but the advanced period of the season when the other work was completed rendered this impracticable. It will be taken up at the opening of the next season. The statistics of the work between February 1st and May 4th are as follows: Number of stations established Number of stations occupied Number of angles measured Number of observations .A.rea of triangulation (square miles)

In connection with the establishment of intermediate tida1 stations, a line of levels, found to be requisite, was run by this party between Wilmington and Smithville, North Carolina, previous to the commencement of the triangulation. The officer in charge during the season mentions, in high terms, the aid afforded by Sub-Assistant John Rockwell, and his hearty co-operation in the execution of the survey. The computations and duplicate records have been returned to the office. Topograpliy.-The minute topographical survey in this section, north and south of Charleston harbor, has been executed by the party of Sub-Assistant R. M. Bache. On the south side along the seaboard, the work embraces Seabrook's island, near the entrance of North Edisto river, Kiawah island, stretching towards the mouth of Stono river, which is also included in the survey, together with Kia8

58

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

wah river, parts of John's island in Colleton parish; and north of the Stono, Cole's island, and part of the outside shore of Folly island. The area covered by topography in these several localities is about thirty-two square miles, and about two hundred and four miles of shore-lines were surveyed between January 2 and May 1. The topographical work north of Charleston harbor was confined to the survey of Long island between the 18th and 27th of May. This work includes seventeen and a half miles of shore-line within an area of four square miles. Sub-A88istant Bache has since been eugaged in putting in ink the foregoing work, and in field-work near Plymouth, Massachusetts, in Section I. I inspected the progress of this work during the season, and found it entirely . satisfactory. Hydrography.-After completing Beaufort harbor, Sorth Carolina, the hydrographic party of Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, made the re-survey of the channel known by his name near Sullivan's island, to which reference has been made in the introductory remarks of this section. It was intended that a reconnaissance of Port Royal inlet and Beaufort harbor, South Carolina, should next have been made, but the communications addressed to Lieut. Comg. Maffitt failed to reach him in time for the purpose; and that work yet remains for the next season, in the instructions for which it will be included. The party next took up the completion of Savannah River (Tybee) entrance, which was interrupted by an accident to the steamer requiring repair8, which, in consequence of the occupation of the railway and marine dock at Savannah, could not be made there, and made necessary the return of the vessel to Charleston. Here the party rendered valuable service to the commission on the improvement of that harbor which had been re-assembled by the Engineer department, in current and other observations. The vessel being repaired, they undertook the Gulf Stream work which had been directed-namely, an extension of the previous examination of the bottom on the Charleston section and north of it, in which the previous summer's work had developed such curious and important inequalities-but had hardly made a beginning, when the vessel sprang a leak, requiring all the efforts of officers and men to bring her safely into port at Norfolk. Here the steamer was exchanged for a sailing-vessel, and the suhooner John Y. Mason, Lieut. Comg. Maffitt, executed the hydrography of James River entrance in Section III. The statistics of the work thus executed are as follows:

the ocean tide with those in the harbor. It did not work successfully, however; and the pipe leading to it soon became choked by sediment. The observations for comparison still remain to be made. The tide-gauge at Castle Pinckney is one of those which are kept up for central reference. It has been carefully observed and continuously. except for a short time after the rlisastruus gale of September G, which damaged the wharf, and carried away the Lox. A tide-station was established also by .Mr. Fairfield at St. Simon's; but the observations were not long continued, and the work there remains to be done.
GULF STREAM.

In my last annual report I gave the conclusions which a preliminary discussion of the observations of the Gulf Stream, especially those for temperatures, up to that time, had developed. Following the methods adopted in that discus~ion, Professor Pendleton, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, under my immediate direction, went carefully over all this work; re-plotting the diagrams, re-computing the tables, enlarging upon many of the incomplete deductions, and in general working over the whole matter anew. Closer numerical results were of course obtained in many cases, but the conclusions were undisturbed. This discussion will be given in full detail in the volumes of Records and Results of the Coast Survey, with the observations themselves; for the present I have placed in the Appendix Ko. 47 the outline of it, which was communicated, under authority from the Treasury Department, to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting in Washington. Plate No. 24 gives the determination of the stream from this discussion, the temperntures being marked by the darker and lighter shades; the darker corresponding to the higher temperatures, and the alternate bands of high and low temperature being shown by the alternations of the shades. The diagrams giving the law of change of temperature with depth, the changes of temperature at any given depth across the section of the stream, the variation of depth for a given temperature, and the character of the bottom, a:re shown in Plate No. 25. It will not be necessary to notice these further here, as they are referred to in the paper very fully. The subjects treated are: 1. The distribution of temperature at different depths, which is shown in the cold counter-current to take, after a certain depth, the form of equiliLrium, due to the conduction of heat by water, a bad conductor, and, under the Gulf Stream proper, curves varying from the form of equilibrium. The existence of the polar current underlying this body of warm water from the tropical regions is discussed. 2. The distribution of temperature at the same depth on the several sections perpendicular to the stream from prominent points of the coast. The curious facts in regard to the " cold wall" limiting the inner side of the hot water of the Gulf Stream are here brought out; and the division into alternate warm and cold bands of the waters of the ocean in and near this mighty stream. The permanency of the divisions of the stream in different years is tested; the summer stream, by the results of running the same section in different years, and by the agreement or variance of the results obtained at a particular depth with those at other depths. The uncertainty of position of one of the points of highest or lowest temperature is there found to be, on the average, seven miles; and of the best determined bands the hottest, and those near to it, five and a half nautical miles. The differences in the temperature of the whole mass of water at the sa~ie season in different years are often more considerable than the differences of distribution. The other form of discussion, which takes in, generally, only accidental

60

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

variations of temperature, gives for the probable uncertainty of the position of the axis or hottest part of the stream, two miles and a. half, in those parts of the stream where it is well defined. The correspondence between the :figure of the bottom and the general divisions of the stream, as brought out from the observations of Lieuts. Comg. Craven and :Maffitt, is here shown. 3. The " cold wall" is traced in the southern sections as well as the northern, varying only in the amount of change. The changes in position of the remarkable points in the stream with the seasons, and other circumstances, are not disposed of. The observations have been made, as far as practicable, in the summer, when the exposure to the observers is least, and when the temperatures of the surface-water and of the air would be most nearly the same, and therefore the least disturbing action would be produced by the air. Since my last report Lieut. Comg. Craven has run two sections of the streamin February, 1854-to give the winter temperatures; and has attempted a northern section, imperfectly run before, but with incomplete results, from the giving out of parts of the engine of his vessel in the rolling sea of the Gulf. In running the first two sections across from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and St. Simon's, Georgia, Lieut. Comg. Craven also re-investigated the depths at which bottom was found, with his improved Massey's sounding-machine, instead of the sounding-line, which, as has been before stated, could, probably, not be relied upon to give such great depths accurately. The ratio is of course a very variable quantity; but in the comparisons on the St. Simon's section, indicates but seventy per cent. of the depths obtained by the line in a depth of about five hundred fathoms. Thus bottom was found at about one hundred and twenty-nine miles from the land on the St. Simon's section, in 1853, with the line at five hundred fathoms; and in 1854 with the Massey at three hundred and :fifty fathoms; and again at about one hundred and forty-one miles, in 1853, with the line, at five hundred and twenty fathoms; and in 1854, with the Massey, at three hundred and ninety-five fathoms. The proportion is shown by other comparisons to be a variable one. The form of the bottom, which was deduced from the observations of last year, is confirmed by these. In regard to the temperatures observed in February, if we had no others to guide us, such is the irregularity which reigns, we should be led to despair of a result. The beautiful curve of equilibrium, and others which we obtain in the summer observations for the change of temperature with depth, is replaced in winter, as the known changes would lead us to expect, by irregular forms. The temperature from some twenty to one hundred, and sometimes one hundred and fifty fathoms, remains nearly the same, and then suddenly falls very rapidly. The temperatures at fifty fathoms are sometimes greater than those at and near the surface. On the Canaveral section, a vertical line would represent the law of temperatures from the surface to one hundred and :fifty fathoms, for four of the positions. Then the fall is extremely sudden, amounting in the next hundred and fifty fathoms, in many cases, to twenty degrees Fahrenheit. While the hottest part of the Canaveral section at five fathoms depth, in June, 1853, was 81!░ Fahrenheit, in February, 1854, it was but 77░ Fahrenheit. In the summer, the two curves of temperature for five fathoms, and for one hundred and twenty-five fathoms, differed, on the average, about 16░ Fahrenheit, while in the wi"nter of 1854, the difference was about 5░ Fahrenheit. At five fathoms below the 0 surface on the St. Simon's section, in June, 1853, the highest temperature was SOt Fahrenheit, and in February, 1854, 77!░ Fahrenheit. In tne summer of 1853, the

OF THE UNITED STA.TES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

61

curves representing the temperatures at five fathoms, and at one hundred and twenty-five fathoms, differed some 17░, while in the winter of 1854 they were but 5░ to 6░ asunder. The double division of the stream is shown at Canaveral, the section of which is carried further than in 1853, by some thirty miles. The :first maximum was about seven miles nearer to the cape than in 1853, and the second one was the higher. What would be generally taken by navigators as the Gulf water, was sixty-five nautical miles from the cape. The nearer maximum, forty-five miles from the cape, was but little lower in temperature than the furthest, until the depth of more than one hundred fathoms was reached. The St. Simon's section showed the highest temperature about one hundred and seven miles from the land in the curves near the surface; but there had obviously been some great disturbance of temperature just before these results were obtained, in three cases: after a very sudden fall of temperature from the surface to ten and fifteen fathoms, there is as sudden a rise to twenty fathoms. The lowest temperature recorded on the Canaveral section was 50░ at three hundred and fifty fathoms, ninety-five miles from the cape; and on the St. Simon's section, 47░ at three hundred and forty-five fathoms; but no casts were made deeper than four hundred fathoms. In the region of the Gulf Stream, on a section from Nan tu ck et or Cape Cod, difficulty might be expected in obtaining well-characterized results; and it has so happened that in the cruises of 1845 and of 1854, directed to this same section, an accident in each case prevented the prosecution of the work sufficiently far, requiring the return of the vessel. The indications are, that the hottest water of the stream was some forty to fifty nautical miles further south and east in October, 1854, than in August, 1845. The highest temperature registered at twenty-five fathoms by Lieut. Comg. Davis in 1845, was 75!░ Fahrenheit; by Lieut. Comg. Craven, at thirty fathoms, in October, 1854, was 70░ Fahrenheit. Both observers passed through the first warm branch of the stream; the first for about ninety to one hundred and sixty miles from Nantucket, and the second for about one hundred and twenty-five to two hundred miles. The Gulf water forms quite a superficial stratum for about one hundred and sixty miles from Nantucket. At a depth of nine hundred fathoms, Lieut. Comg. Craven found a temperature of 35░, which, he remarks, is the lowest he has noted in any of his explorations. This is but eleven degrees lower than was found on the section off Cape Canaveral, Florida, in June, 1853. Twenty fathoms below the surface, here the temperature was 67░, and at Canaveral 74░. In examining the Gulf Stream sections from Cape Canaveral and St. Simon's, Lieut. Comg. Craven reports the following work done:

Two current-bottles were found on the eastern coast of Florida, which had been thrown over from Coast Survey vessels, and the cards within them were kindly transmitted to the office in Washington. One of these had been thrown from the steamer Walker in the longitude of Mobile, in the latitude of Pass a l'Outre, at the mouth of the Mississippi, two months before it was found by Mr. Douglass Dummett just south of Mosquito inlet. The other, from the steamer Corwin, fourteen

miles ENE. from Cape Florida light, was found by Mr. John Adams near Jupiter inlet. The first will be further noticed under the hydrography of Section VIII. We do not know the date at which the second probably came ashore. They concur, as far as the latter part of their course is concerned, showing the same diredion of the current onward and shoreward.
SECTION VI.-FROM THE ST. MARY'S RIVER TO ST. JOSEPH'S BAY, CO.AST OF FLORIDA, AND INCLUDtNG THE FLORIDA REEFS AND KEYS. (SKETCH F.)

The largest number of parties which the appropriation permitted has been at work in this section during the whole time that funds were available. They consisted of a reconnaissance party, two triangulation parties, two topographical parties, and a hydrographic party; with a steam-vessel for outside work,.and a sailingvessel for inside. Tidal observations were made continuously for five months at Cape Florida; at St. Augustine for three months; and at Tampa bay for three months; and were attempted at Indian Hiver inlet. The outer triangulation of the keys and reefs now reaches from Virginia key, westward, to Key Uodrigucz, (sec Sketch F, No. 2,) and from the western extremity of the :Marquesas to Point Dora, which is five-eighths of the whole. The inner triangulation extends over Key Biscayne bay, Card's sound, and part of Barnes' sound, about one-third of the whole. The proper time has come for the minute measurement of the Key Biscayne and Cape Sable bases; which I propose to undertake myself next spring. The plane-table work has followed the triangulation on the outside from Old Rhodes key to Wednesday Point, and from the Marquesas to the Pine islands; including the marking of the keys east of Key vV est, and inside over Key Biscayne bay. The hydrography outside reaches from the same point of beginning to Carysfort light; and from the Tortugas, including Rebecca and Isaac shoals, eastward to include Key West and its approaches, and Bahia Honda; and inside, Key Biscayne bay and the greater part of Card's sound. The parties generally in this section during the past year have accomplished a fair proportion of this work, considering, of course, their increased number. The reconnaissance of the eastern coast of the peninsula has determined the practicability of a main triangulation there. The division of, and marking nineteen small keys, has been made. The triangulation outside has furnished points for the topography of the next y{)ar, east of Saddle Hill. That inside has completed Barnes' sound behind Key Largo. The hydrography has discovered an important harbor, Turtle harbor, near Oaysfort light-house; and a system of buoys and a seamark have been recommended for it. The sea-marks have been prepared for erection on the points of the reef, approved by the Light-house Board. A reconnaissance of Coffin's Patches has been made in reference to the erection of a light-house there. I am indebted to the Chief Engineer, Gen. J. G. Totten, for information of a shoal, not on the charts, in Garden Key channel, Tortugas; the light-house on G!rden key being due south. There is scant three fathoms of water on the shoal, and six and a half and seven fathoms on each side of it. The notice is derived from Lieut. H. G. Wright, of the Corps of Engineers, (see Appendix No. 17,) and Sketch F. The office-work of the field parties has been brought up, including the inking of the plane-table sheets, the computations, and plotting the hydrographic sheets. In the office of the Coast Survey the chart of Key West, on the largest scale, and Florida reef and keys1 No. I, have been commenced; the sketch of Turtle harbor has been drawn and engraved; and the sketches for the report are prepared and in the course of engraving. The tidal observations at Egmont keiy, Tamp~ have

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

63

been discussed under my immediate direction, and those at St. Augustine and Cape Florida are in the course of reduction. Reconnaissance.-A reconnaissance of the eastern coast of Florida, from the St. John's to Jupiter inlet, was made by Brevet Major Henry Prince, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, in January, February, and part of March. He passed usually by the sounds and rivers near the coast, and occasionally by land, in conveyances furnished by the way; noticing minutely the difficulties and facilities for a triangulation, and collecting all the information which might be useful to the parties which were to follow him. He met everywhere with a kind disposition to forward the objects of his reconnaissance, and to furnish him every desirable information. After passing over the route twice, going and returning to St. Augustine, he collected in the office of the Surveyor General there the plats of the public-land surveys, and compiled a series of highly useful reconnaissance-sheets. From the information obtained by him, the outline on Sketch F is drawn. The original maps include a belt of from about three to ten miles from the ocean shore, and about two hundred and sixty miles in length, upon which the general features of the country are sketched. As an introductory work to the survey of the peninsula, this reconnaissance is of great value; showing the resources upon which the parties may rely, the difficulties they may expect to meet, and the leading facilities which may be expected in their operations. The sounds and lagoons, with occasional reaches in the rivers near the coast, and the ridge of sand-hills near the ocean shore, present, as usual, the main facilities for the triangulation. There aTe a few mounds, one of which, near old Fort Jupiter, Major Prince estimates at twenty-five to thirty feet in height; the ridge from Fort Pierce to Mount Elizabeth, fourteen miles, at sixty feet; and Turtle mound, about twelve miles from Mosquito inlet, at forty to fifty feet high. These, however, are exceptions to the general character of the coast. Major Prince's conclusions are of decided interest, especially when it is considered that his experience in the different parts of the survey has given him ample means of forming an accurate judgment. He states that a main triangulation of the smallest size along the coast seems quite feasible, and that the route of the secondary or small triangulation is decidedly indicated by suitable openings along the whole extent of coast, and that the main ttiangulation would find open country to cross the peninsula on the line from Lake Washington to Chai-lotte harbor. The lines through the swamps would be the most difficult; but these would cross them, not lie in them. Jupiter inlet was opened artificially in 1844, at a time when the water in the everglades was high, by merely cutting a small trench. It remained open until 1847; then closed, and again re-opened in 1853. From oral and other information collected, Major Prince infers that south of Jupiter inlet "the opening for the smaller triangulation appears to be hardly inferior to that along the rest of the Atlantic coast of Florida." The distance from Jupiter inlet to Cape Florida is about seventy-five miles. Major Prince also furnished a compilation from the Surveyor General's office of the western coast of the peninsula of Florida. .Astronomical observati"ons.-Under the direction of Assistant F. H. Gerdes, observations were made for connecting Mobile and Key West, by chronometers, for difference of longitude. Sub-Assistant J. G. Oltmanns observed for time at the astronomical station at Pascagoula, and then at that at Key West. Next passing to the Tortugas, he observed, with the transit instrument, (C. S. No. 9,) for time, near the light-house there, and also with the zenith telescope (C. S. No. 1) for latitude, returning to Key West, and again mounting the transit and making time

observations with it. Sixty-seven transits were observed and seven pairs of stars with the zenith telescope. Mr. Oltmanns was indebted for facilities in his work to Lieut. H. G. Wright, of the Corps of Engineers, and to Lieut. Randolph, of the revenue marine servke. Secondary and tertiary triangulation.-Lieut. James Totten, U. S. A., assistant Coast Survey, continued the triangulation eastward of Key West from the limits of his work of last year, about ten miles, to Johnson's key-Point Dora, twenty-five miles from Key West. (See Sketch F, No. 2.) The occupation of two more stations outside will carry it to Loggerhead key. During the season Lieut. Totten measured a short base on Grassy key, and made a small triangulation to enable Lieut. Comg. Craven to execute the hydrography of Coffin's Patches. The statistics given by Lieut. Totten in his report are as follows: Number of stations occupied, including four reoccupied Number of angles measured, including twenty-seven remeasured Number of observations in measuring angles Number of observations in remeasuring angles .Area in square miles 29 193 7,904 1,501 104

The services of Mr. C. T. Iardella, as aid to the party, are acknowledged with praise. The office-work of the party has been brought up, and Lieut. Totten has been engaged in superintending the repairs of his vessel and the construction of the signals for the Florida reeБ Lieut. A. H. Seward, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, continued the interior triangulation from the points in Card's sound where it was left by the late lamented J,ieut. Joseph S. Totten, to Grassy Point, in Barnes' sound-(see Sketch F, No. 2)-a distance of about eighteen miles. At this point the main land and inner keys are separated from Key Largo by merely a small creek, and no water communication with the outside exists between Angelfish and Tavernier creeks, a distance of nearly thirty miles; and Key Largo, which is from three quarters to a mile in width, and heavily timbered, separates the interior from the exterior triangulation. "The bay inside is cut up into several small divisions by low marshy keys jutting out from the main shore. These smaller bays are connected with each other by narrow creeks, with bars at their entrances, over which not more than two and a half feet can be carried." This survey was commenced on the 28th of December, 1853, and between that date and the 14th of May, 1854, the following work was done: Number of signals erected, viz: 13 first order, 28 second Number of stations occupied, viz: 13 first order, 12 second Number of sets of repetitions for measurement of angles Number of observations made for measurement of angles .Area covered by the triangulation (square miles) 41 25 796 4,402 52

The instrument used was the twelve-inch Gambey theodolite, (C. S. No. 32.) Mr. C. B. Baker assisted Lieut. Seward in his observations. The party had the Coast Survey schooner Hassler for transportation. Topography.-The topographical survey of the Florida keys, next to and within the reef, has been carried on by two parties; one of which was, besides, specially employed in marking and dividing the keys for the General Land Office. This

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY ]<'OR 1sr,L

65

work, which was commenced in the spring of last year at Boca Chica, east of Key West, was continued during the past season by Sub-Assistant I. H. Adams. (See Sketch P, No. 2.) The following-named keys were surveyed, marked, and measured: West Harbor key, the most northwesterly of the group referred to; East Harbor keys, Cayo Agua, Desolation, Hawk, Middle, Eagle Nest, Snake, Rockland, East Rockland, Big Coppett or Coppice, Half Moon, Shark, O'Hara, Geiger's key, South Saddle Hill, Round, Wall, Bird, and Pelican keys. These are all small keys, the aggregate area beiug forty-six square miles, and the total length of shoreline seventy miles and three quarters. The intersections of meridional with section and quarter-section lines were marked by numbered stakes planted at each intersection. A tracing of the drawing of .M:r. Adams has been communicated to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, and the determinations of Mr. Wainwright have also been placed at his disposal. (See Appendix No. 19.) South Saddle Hill, so called, is the first object seen by navigators approaching this part of the coast, and has been mistaken for elevated ground. It owes its form, however, to a growth of tall mangroves, the inner trees of the group rising highest, and giving a rounded shape to the whole. Mr. G. W. Parrish served as aid in this party, and his zeal and efficiency in the discharge of duty are specially referred to. The report of Mr. Adams contains some interesting remarks and general information in regard to the character of the keys upon which the party was employed. (See Appendix No. 19.) The party of Sub-Assistant S. A. Wainwright began operations in February, where the party of Mr. Adams had left them the previous season, at Old Rhodes key, (Sketch F, No. 2,) and proceeded in a southwesterly direction to W ednesday Point and Point Perry, on Key Largo North. This work includes several small keys, separated by narrow and intricate passages. The aggregate area is seven square miles, and the whole length of shore-line forty miles. This party also traced the shore-line of a portion of Bahia Honda for the hydrographic party. Mr. Wainwright left Washington in December to commence this work, but owing to the delay and injury to the vessel intended to furniБh him transportation, (the schooner Joseph Henry,) was not able to commence operations until late in February. The general features and character of the keys here referred to are described in the report of Sub-Assistant Wainwright. (See Appendix No. 19.) Hydrography.-Lieut. Comg. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, having in charge the steamer Corwin, resumed operations in this section on the 15th of April, and has carried the hydrographic survey between the keys and reef from Pacific reef southward, and westward to Basin Bank, a distance of fourteen miles, and inside of the keys, over Card's sound. (See Sketch F, No. 2.) A reconnaissance of Coffin's Patches, on the Florida reef, based upon the triangulation of Lieut. James Totten, U. S. A., assistant, has also been made during the season. (See Sketch F, No. 2.) When on his way to the reef, Lieut. Comg. Craven repeated the observations for temperature and depth, made during the previous season on the St Simon's and Cape Canaveral sections of the Gulf Stream, noticed in my report of last year. The results, which confirmed those of the previous season, are given under the head of the " Gulf Stream." Touching at Havana, on his way to Key иWest, Lieut. Comg. Craven was c.alled upon, in behalf of the Department of State, by the consul at Havana, to convey to Charleston, South Carolina, the despatches in relation to the seizure of the steamship Black Warrior by the ~t!.thotities of Cuba., On his return thence, the survey

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

of the reef was commenced and continued until the 1st of June, when sickness broke out among his crew, one case of which terminated fatally, and obliged him to return to New York. While engaged on the Florida reef a convenient harbor of refnge was discovered by the hydrographic party, near Turtle reef, and which, from its position, Lieut. Comg. Craven has named Turtle harbor. This harbor is four and a half miles to the northward and westward of Carysfort light-house, and when marked by a beacon and buoys, will become an important harbor of refuge. 'l'wenty-six feet of water can he carried into the anchorage, where the bottom is soft clay. The particulars of this discovery were communicated to the department and published, (see Appendix No. 15,) and the recommendations of Lieut. Comg. Craven in regard to a beacon and buoys at the entrance of the harbor have been communicated to the Light-house Board. A sketch of Turtle harbor is prepared for this report. (Sketch F, No. 3.) Lieut. Comg. Craven has reported the following statistics of the season's work: Number of miles run in sounding Square miles of area surveyed Whole number of soundings Number of angles used Greatest depth of water (fathoms)

Lieut. Comg. Craven subsequently made a hydrographic reconnaissance of Wimble shoals, on the coast of North Carolina, referred to under the head of Section IV, ran a portion of a section of the Gulf Stream off Cape Cod, made numerous light-house examinations on the coast of Maine, and current, tidal, and other observations in Portland harbor. The details of these valuable and long-continued labors are stated in the notice of the hydrography and light-house examinations of Section I. It is known to navigators that there are passages at particular points through the Florida reef by which safe and comparatively protected navigation may be had; but where these positions are, is not generally known. One important object of the sea-maiks in course of erection on these reefs, will be to enable navigators to ascertain precisely their position along the reef, and to be able to avail themselves of such passages through it as the Coast Survey points out. The important observation has been made by Lieut. Comg. Craven, (see Appendix No. 16,) that bringing Indian key to bear in any direction from N. to N. vV. by N. and standing for it, will carry vessels safely over the reef in not less than eighteen feet water. Tidal observations were made in St. Augustine harbor on a staff-gauge, and others for comparison, during the day-time, near the light-house. The former were continued as long as was deemed necessary for the comparison with other stations; they were under the direction of Assistant George A. Fairfield. The same officer made the arrangements for establishing a self-registering gauge at Cape Florida, where Mr. L. E. Tansill, who had been in charge of the gauge at Bolivar Point, was stationed. These observations were closed in October, and the observer was directed to repair to Indian key to establish a ga-.ige there. Lieut. Comg. Craven stationed a tidal observer at Indian inlet, but the washing away of the gauge in a storm, and the sanding up of the channel, soon interrupted the observations. On his way to Cedar keys, Lieut. Comg. Berryman, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, established a self-registering gauge at Egmont key, Tampa bay, and left

Corporal Thompson, of the engineer company A, in charge. The observations were continued until August, when the observer was transferred to St Mark's. Light-house examinations, &c.-A sketeh of the recmrnaissauce of Coffin's Patches (see Sketch F, No. 4) was transmitted, with the suggestions of Lieut. Comg. Craven in regard to a light for the vicinity, in a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Light-house Board, a copy of which is given in the Appendix, Ko. 73. The report of Lieut. James Totten, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, on the mode of establishing sea marks and their places upon the Florida reef~ having been approved by the Light-house Board, he was requested to execute the plan under the appropriation for the purpose, and has prepared the necessary drawings and had the ~astings made in conformity иwith the specifications. These will, it is expected, be completed in time to erect the signals during the coming season.
SECTION VTI.-FRO>l ST. JOSEPH'S BAY TO MOBILE BAY, INCLJ;DING PART OF THE COAST OF FLORIDA. AND ALABAMA. (SKETCH G.)

There were no means particularly appropriated to this section, but at the close of the first half of the surveying year, such as could be spared from other sections were applied to beginning or continuing some of the most pressing work. As I have several times stated, this section can hardly by any exertion be brought up to the line of progress of the others. The estimates for the next fiscal year contain an item for the section which had been inserted in the approved estimates, and which will secure greater progress for the next year. As the case stands, however, more progress would have been made in the land-work, but for a series of mishaps which retarded the parties sent to execute it. Interesting information in regard to Uedar keys, in reply to inquiries by Hon. D. L. Yulee, will be found in the letters of Assistant F. H. Gerdes and Lieut. Comg. Berryman, (Appendix Nos. 26 and 27,) and in relation to Tampa bay, by Lieut. Comg. Berryman, (Appendix No. 25.) Besides the reconnaissance and progress-sketches of this section, a map of Cedar keys has been commenced, and the tidal results for Tampa computed. Like Cedar keys, the tide at Egmont key (Tampa) has a large diurnal inequality; but the rise and fall is less, being at Cedar keys 2. 5 feet, and at Egmont key 1. 7 foot. Corporal Thompson is now observing at St. Mark's. A.<Jtronomical and magnetic observati'ons.-Observations were made at Cedar keys, (Depot key,) St. Blas, and St. Andrew's bay, with a portable transit, for time, giving the approximate difference of longitude. The latitudes were only r, rough approximation, as a failure in transportation had deprived Mr. Gerdes of the usual appliances. Observations for magnetic variation were made at the astronomical stations, which were duly marked for reference. Two nights' observations for difference of longitude were made at St. Blas, and two at St. Andrew's. Triangulatwn and topography.-The preliminary triangulation and topography were continued at Cedar keys in December, (see Sketch G, No. 2,) four new signals erected, and five old ones re-established and determined. The topography covered about twenty-one square miles of area, the shore-line of islands being about forty miles, and of marsh and main land about one hundred miles. This extension of the topography was for immediate use by a hydrographic party. A preliminary base was laid out at St. Andrew's and marked, and its azimuth determined; and a general reconnaissance for a triangulation of the entrance was made. I expected that the secondary triangulation and topographical party sent to St. Andrew's would have had the advantage of Mr. Gerdes' presence, in commencing their work; but the extraordinary delay of the small vessel having the instrumeuts and men

68

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

of the party on board, and other circumstances, interfered entirely with my arrangeи ments, and the only operations at St. Andrew's bay were those above referred to. A preliminary triangulation was made at Ocilla river, Apalachicola bay, by Subи Assistant J. R. Offley ; and the topography, by Assistant George D. Wise, followed the triangulation closely. (See Sketch G.) A local base was measured with a chain; five station-points were established, four of which were occupied; and nineteen angles measured by one hundred and eighty-nine observations upon nine different objects. The plane-table survey of Mr. vVise embract:s two miles at the entrance of the river, and extends three miles up the stream. These two parties had the use of the Coast-Survey schooner Franklin, transferred by Mr. Wise from Section III. Hydrography.-The party of Lieut. Comg. 0. H. Berryman, U. S.N'., assistant in the Coast Survey, having in charge the schooner Crawford, reached Cedar keys on the 14th of March, and, after being employed a short time in erecting necessary signals, proceeded to execute the hydrography of that vicinity. This work includes Sea Horse reef, and a considerable portion of the space between it and the Oyster reefs, in the direction of Crystal River offing, together with the very numerous channels and shoals between the keys. (See Sketch G, No. 2.) The following is an extract from the report of Lieut. Comg. Berryman, in relation to the natural features of Cedar keys and their approaches: "The whole vicinity of these keys exhibits a series of flats, frequently exposed at low water, and covered occasionally with a thin mud which sustains a fine growth of grass. "The best entrance to the keys for sea-going vessels is~ through the main ship channel from the south; the approach is easy, and the anchorage good in all winds from west-southwest to east by the north. "The bar is distant two miles from Sea Horse key, and has, at ordinary low tides, ten feet of water on it; but the depth is considerably reduced by easterly, and increased by westerly gales. It cannot be safely crossed in a gale, or when the swell is high. " All the channels leading to Depot key are narrow and crooked." Further information in regard to these keys and their approaches will be found in the Appendix No. 26. Lieut. Berryman closed the operations of his party in this section in the middle of June, and reports the following statistics: Number oflines of soundings run 1,531 Number of soundings 57,400 Number of angles 3,009 Number of miles of soundings 985 The office work of the party has been completed, including the hydrographic sheet of the present season. On his way to Cedar keys, Lieut. Comg. Berryman put up a tide-gauge at Egmont key, landing Corporal Thompson to take charge of it. A hydrographic reconnaissance of Tampa. bay, included in my instructions to Lieut. Berryman, was rendered impracticable by desertions from his crew and other causes. Some important information, however, in regard to the channel and anchora.ges, based upon general observations, or collected from local sources, will be found in extracts from a letter written by that officer. See Appendix No. 25. At the end of December, a request was made by the Light-House Board for information upon which t.o base estimates of appropriation for the beaconage and

buoyage of Apalachicola bay, Florida. This was accordingly included in my instructions to Assistant Gerdes; but as action thereon had been anticipated by the Chamber of Commerce of Apalachicola, his report, in which is expressed a general concurrence with the views of the petitioners to Congress, is not further referred to.
SECTION VIII.-FROM MOBILE POIKT TO VERMILION BAY, INOLUDI:l\'G THE COAST OF MISSISSIPPI AKD
PART OF LOUISIAXA. (SKETCH IL) -

In this section the officers of the Survey have had, during the past season, more trials of endurance, and less of the reward of success, than usually falls to their lot. Not only was the weather generally unfavorable to work, but the hurricane of March 30-31 swept over the coast where two of our small vessels were employed, stranding one and capsizing and sinking the other. Happily, no lives were lost in either case; but the stranded vessel was put afloat, and the sunken one raised, at a loss of time and means that told heavily upon the operations of the parties using them. In neither case could human care or foresight have availed to prevent the result. The progress of the primary triangulation party was thus cut short, and that of the reconnaissauce party much abridged. It will be seen, however, that the coast has been examined from Fort Jackson, on the Mississippi, to Chandeleur bay, with promising results as to the triangulation, and with hardly less promise from Pass Fourchon, across Barataria bay, to New Orleans; that a special reconnaissance has been made of Pass Fourchon, developing an increased depth on the bar ; and that a triangulation has been laid out for Atchafalaya, Cote Blanche, and Vermilion bays, part of which will be executed this season. The secondary triangulation has enи countered many minor difficulties also, but has been carried to a line from the marine hospital, opposite New Orleans, to Greenville. The hydrography, both in_ and off shore, has made good progress, covering Mississippi and Chandeleur sounds, and extending off-shore from its former limit to the meridian of the western end of Horn island. Valuable results have been developed in regard to temperatures and depths, which will be found stated under the head of hydrography in this section. A shoal supposed to exist in latitude 27░ N., south of the Belize, has been looked for, but no bottom found at one hundred fathoms on its alleged site. The information collected by Assistant F. H. Gerdes in regard to the coast of Louisiana is quite interesting, and is embodied in an article in the Appendix No. 20. Another tidal station at Calcasieu has been added to those heretofore occupied in this section, leaving but a few more stations to be made on the Gulf coast for the full development of tidal results. A map of the coast of the section from his reconnaissances and other information has been prepared by Assistant Gerdes, and will accompany this report. The general chart of Mobile bay has been published. The larger chart is nearly engraved. Mississippi sound No. 1 is nearly engraved, and a second sheet is in the hands of the draughtsman. The progress sketch, accompanying this report has ' been made to show some of the prominent results of the hydrography. ReconnaiBBance.-The schooner used by the party of Assistant F. H. Gerdes left Cedar keys on the 8th of March, and passing around the Delta of the Mississippi, arrived soon after in Atchafalaya bay. ~~ing down the Mississ~ppi from New Orleans to Fort Jackson and Fort St. Ph1hps, Mr. Gerdes reconnoitred, in boats, near the Bat~ledore i~lands, Isle au Breton, Beach island, and through Swan bay and the adjacent rivers, (see Sketch H,) to determine the practicability of connecting these various points by triangulation with Lake Borgne. A series of triangles was projected, which will, in his opinion, serve the desired purpose. The location of the upper points on the lake wa.s, however, prevented by the severe

70

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

gale of March 30th and 31st, which made further progress in that vicinity, at the time, impossible. Having returned to Kew Orleans, Mr. Gerdes reconnoitred, by way of Bayou Plaquemine, westward to the Atchafalaya, through a country offering no facilities for triangulation. In the hurricane of March 31st, the schooner "Gerdes," then in charge of a capable sailing-:master, was driven on the shore east of Bayou Lafourche. Mr. Gerdes took the necessary steps for her relief and subsequent repairs; but the time consumed in these prevented, of course, his work from making the expected progress. Though deprived of the use of his vessel, Mr. Gerdes made a special reconnaissance of Pass Fourchon, the principal outlet of Bayou Lafourche. (See Sketch G, No. 2.) He reports that within two years the depth of water has nearly doubled on the bar of this pass, and that now eight feet can be carried across it. A description of the pass will be found in Appendix No. 20. Mr. Gerdes recommends a light here, and also a day-beacon on the east side of the pass. Mr. Gerdes continued a reconnaissance (see Sketch G, No. 2) through Lake Rondo and Barataria bay, Bayou St. Denis, and so onward into Lake Salvadore and to Lafayette, finding no obstacle to a triangulation along the whole route, except the fringe of woods on the edges of the bayous and lakes, and on the bank of the Mississippi. A general description of the coast of Louisiana west of Atchafalaya bay, chiefly from information collected from intelligent residents, is given from Mr. Gerdes' report, in the Appendix No. 20. The general closing remarks on the development of the Gulf coast of Louisiana within the last ten years, and the increasing facilities for communication, will be found of particular interest. Mr. J. G. Oltmanns has rendered efficient aid as sub-assistant in this party during the season. The records of the work, (16 volumes,) in duplicate, were turned into the office in September last. Mr. Gerdes, in August, resumed the survey of Hudson river, reference to which is made under Section II. Primary triangulation.-The progress of the primary triangulation in this section had been suspended for several years past on account of other important duties of Assistant Gerdes, who had it in charge. These duties continuing during the present year, Assistant J. E. Hilgard was charged with its prosecution. On examining the stations, it was found that from changes in the coast, caused chiefly by the hurricane of August, 1852, it was necessary to fall back upon the line East Pascagoula to Horn Island East as the base for the continuation of the primary triangulation. Mr. Hilgard took the field early in Jannary, assisted by Mr. Stephen Harris. The season proving very unfavo~able, little progress was made until the latter part of March, when the observations at stations East Pascagoula, Horn Island East, Horn Island West, and Bellefontaine were nearly completed. On the 31st of March the schooner Phoonix, which was used by Mr. Hilgard in the work, was capsized and sunk at her anchorage by a tornado. Mr. Hilgard and his party, who were on board at the time, providentially escaped in a boat, after incurring great peril . Measures were immediately taken for the recovery of the vessel; but, owing to boisterous weather and other difficulties, three weeks elapsed before she was raised and the property on board recovered. The records of the work already done, together with other valuable papers, had disappeared; having, probably, been washed to pieces or drifted out to sea. The instruments were damaged to a considerable extent, but great pains were taken to

01'' THE UN IT ED ST ATE S C 0 AST SURVEY F 0 R l 8 5 4 .

71

prevent further destruction by rust after their recovery. An interesting notice of the action of sea-water on metals will be found in Appendix No. 55. Owing to this disastrous occurrence, the work of primary triangulation has again remained stationary. It was deemed inadvisable to continue it then, as the vessel required extensive repairs and the season had already far advanced; in addition to which, the funds available for the purpose had been exhausted by the expenditures incurred for rncovering the vell!sel. This work will be resumed as early as practicable by Mr. Hilgard. Assistant Hilgard made use of a new kind of signal intended to replace heliotropes in localities where heliotropers cannot well be posted. The plan was suggested some years ago by Assistant Wm. M. Boyce, and the signal was put in the present form by Mr. Hilgard. It consists of three curved reflectors: each a segment of a cylindrical surface, the axis of which is horizontal, three inches wide, and eighteen to twenty-four inches high, with a curvature of from 23░ to 30░. These are arranged on a frame, revolving about a vertical axis, and provided with wings, so as to be turned by the breeze, which scarcely ever fails on the coast or on heights. The reflectors send a rapid succession of bright flashes all around the horizon, which frequently appear continuous. They have been made of common sheet-tin, with good effect. German silver is preferred, as less liable to tarnish, which makes it even preferable to silver, though the latter, in the form of the common daguerreotype plate, could be readily employed. The site of the base-line on Dauphine island, which was encroached on by the gale of August, 1852, as stated in my last annual report, was examineu by Assistants Gerdes and Hilgard, who, having assisted in the measurement, were able to bring their personal recollection to bear on the recovery of marks. They report that the monument at the west end of the base has been dislodgeu by the sea, as well as the stones which had been placed for the verification of the monument. They found undisturbed, however, two accurate marks, which were made at the time of measurement, at distances of 714 and 1,470 metres from the monument. From them the position of the monument may be recovered by a remeasurement, or n new terminus may be established, a short distance to the eastward of the former ones, in a position, possibly, less liable to the encroachment of the sea. Mr. Hilgard has been in charge of the computing division since his return to the office, and has also executed field-work in Section II, of which a notice will be found in its place. Secondary triangulation.-The secondary triangulation of Lake Pontchartrain has been carried to New Orleans during the past season by Assistant S. A. Gilbert. As was the case with the other parties, this one was much delayed by bad weather and by the consequences of severe storms. A house had been built at Greenville, near New Orleans, across one of the lines opened last year, causing a new delay, by the necessity for finding and opening another line. A signal, erected with much labor near the middle of the lake, was wantonly destroyed, causing further delay. These obstacles were finally overcome, and the triangulation was carried on according to the scheme shown in Sketch H. The work was commenced at the end of December, and closed early in June, six stations having been occupied, and twenty-four angles measured with a repeating theodolite (C. S. No. 23) by Gambey. After the close of the season, Mr. Gilbert was occupied in putting in ink the topography of a sheet of Plymouth harbor, surveyed in 1853, and in making duplicates and reductions of his observations of the past season. He has since made a plane-table survey in Set!tion I, near Cape Small Point, for the site of a light-house. Hydrography.-The hydrographic work of the party of Lieut. Comg. B. F. Sands, U. S. N. 1 assistant in the Coast Survey, was unavoidably delayed by the difficulty

72

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

of procuring men for the steamer Walker, under his command, at Pensacola, where the vessel had been laid up, so that it was not commenced until the middle of March. The weather, too, throughout the season was more than usually unfavorable in this section. The first work executed was the search for a shoal in latitude 27░ N. and longitude 89░ W., south of the Belize, which resulted in disproving its existence. Two hundred and eighty miles were run over the supposed location without finding any shoal water. (See Appen<l.ix No. 18.) In going to and returning from the search just mentioned, lines of deep-sea soundings for depths and temperatures were run; and in prosecuting the general hydrographic work of the section, lines of the same character were run-one fifteen miles distant from and parallel to the coast, outside of off-shore work of the previous season, another from the east end of Horn island to Pensacola,, and a third from the east end of Ship island southeasterly until off soundings in the direction of Key West. Between latitude 28░ to 26░ 40', and within thirty minutes of longitude of Pass a Loutre, (the latitude of the entrance of the pass being 29░ 10',) the temperature of the water at the surface was found to be from 77░ to 78░ Fahrenheit, the air being from 72░ to 77░. At thirty fathoms, within the same limits, the temperature was about 77░ 1 but the sub-surface temperatures were very irregular. These observations were made on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of April, 1854. North of latitude 28~ 40', 1░ east of Pass a Loutre, the temperatures at the surface were 70░, 69░, and 68░ 1 on the 8th and 9th of April; the air being 71░ and 70░, and the temperature at fifteen fathoms 70.5░ and 68░, showing, within forty nautical miles, a fall in the temperature of the surface, and below, of some eight degrees Fahrenheit. T.his remarkable change requires further investigation, as it must produce currents of considerable strength, and other results important in the navigation of the GulБ What is not a little curious is, that the bottle thrown overboard in latitude 28░ 58 11 in the longitude of Mobile, where the surface temperature was 69░, was found near Jupiter inlet, on the eastern coast of Florida, having found its way, probably by wind and counter-currents, into the comparatively warm current of the Gulf Stream. (See Appendix No. 52.) Notwithstanding the adverse circumstances of weather, before alluded to, Lieut. Comg. Sands succeeded in carrying the outside soundings from the meridian of Round island, off Horn island, twelve miles to sea, and westward to the entrance between Cat and Ship islands, in Chandeleur sound, joining his previous work in Nassau roads, and that of Lieut. Oomg. Patterson off Ship island. Some boat-work, attempted at the entrance between Horn and Ship islands, proved to be impracticable on account of the weather.

73 и Lieut. Sands closed the season's operations on the 1st of June, taking the steamer
OF THE UNITED STATES COAsr SURVEY FOR 1854 .

to Philadelphia for repairs, and returned to execute his office-work in Washington. A very instructive fact as to the course of the Gulf Stream was obtained from fii 1ding a bottle on the eastern coast of the Florida peninsula, near Mosquito inlet, which bad been thrown over by Lieut. Comg. Sands seventy-eight nautical miles south of the west end of Dauphine island. The bottle was thrown over on the 8th of April, and found on the 6th of June. Mr. Douglas Dummett, to whom we are indebted for this information, (see Appendix No. 52,) remarks, that he had passed over the beach four days before without seeing the bottle. We are sure of the direction of the current, the place upon the shore agreeing with the motion onward and outward from the axis of the Gulf Stream. The distance gone over, if the bottle took a direct course, was about seven hundred and fifty nautical miles, and the time fifty-nine days; this, if the motion were uniform, would be at the rate of nearly thirteen miles per day-an inference which, however, cannot be drawn with any certainty. 'Tidal observatiuns.-At Calcasieu, Louisiana, Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann was enи gaged from February 24th until May 25th in recording, half-hourly, the height of the tide, and in hourly meteorological observations in connection with the tidal. The tides here present an exception to the general rule of single-day tides west of St. George's, agreeing in this respect with Galveston, nearly. Though the double tides are small and irregular, and much influenced by the wind, yet there are distinctly two ebbs and two floods, as a rule, in one lunar day. The faithfulness of Mr. Wurdemann's observations is in no manner more strikingly shown than in developing opposite peculiarities with the greatest certainty, passing from Aransas Pass, where the tides are single, to Calcasieu, where they are double, and yet being entirely unprejudiced as to what the phenomena should .be, and seizing the double character of the Calcasieu tides as readily as the single ones of Ara.nsas.
SECTION IX-FROM VERMILION BAY TO THE BOUNDARY, INCLUDING PART OF THE COAST OF LOUISIANA AND THAT OF TEXAS. (SKETCH I.)

The resources of this section have, in a great degree, been taken up by a reи newal of the outfit for the hydrographic party. The schooners Morris and Belle, when transferred to the Coast Survey, were old vessels, and have been repaired from time to time, until, at the close of the last season, they were condemned as unseaworthy-the first after being left in Pensacola harbor by her officers, in a sinking condition, and the second having sunk in a gale in Galvee!on bay. The frequent changes of officers, which were unavoidable in this section, and the heavy comparative expenses for supplies of every kind, have rendered the progress of the work there less than it would otherwise have been. The assistant in charge of the land-work having resigned, and the hydrographic officer having been necesи sarily transferred to replace one of the chiefS of parties detached from the survey, the oflicers in the section this season were new to the localities, and the chief of the hydrographic party to the duties of the Coast Survey. We have now an effective vessel, the schooner Arago, expressly arranged for this section, where light dra~ght and good qualities as a sea-boat must be combined. The party is preparmg at once to commence work afloat. Tri~ngulati"on and wpography.-The work on the southwestern boundary, exeи cuted m the p~sent season by Assistant W. E. Greenwell, included the measurement of a base-hne, for which, after reconnaissance, he selected a sight on the Texan side of the Rio Grande. He remarks, in reference to it: "The site is a good one, running over level prairie, and its approximation to the river gave s~v eral collateral advantag-es for ready measurement. The line was first surveyed with 10

74

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

the plane-table and chain-stakes being placed at intervals of <2ight hundred metres. It was finally measured иwith two four-metre l)ars of iron, placed on beds of pine, the cross-sections of which were angnlar. "The Lase measured four thousand three hundred and forty metres, or two miles and four-fifths, nearly. "Six persons were required in the measurement, which occupied twenty working hours, and the last hundred bars were remeasured, with a result nearly identical with the first measurement." Between the 7th of November, on which day the party landed at Brazos St. Iago, and the 12th of April following, the triangulation was extended from the line joining that station with Point Isabel, about nine miles north of the Rio Grande, to a point five miles south of that river. (See Sketch I, No. 2.) The accuracy of this work is unquestionable, most of the triangles closing within one second in angular measurement. In the series eight stations were occupied, ten signals erected, and forty-four angles measured by two hundred and seventeen sets of observations. The whole number of single observations was two thousand six hLmdred and ten, within an area of forty-three square miles. The instrument used was the eight-inch Garn bey theodolite, (C. S. No. 36.) The topography carried on in connection with the triangulation was extended by Assistant Greenwell beyond its limits, covering sixty-three square miles. Within this area fourteen miles of roads, seventy-six miles of outline of lagoons, and one hundred and nine miles of shore-line, were surveyed. The schooner Guthrie was, during the season, in charge of the party of Assistant Greenwell, who makes the following remarks on her passage, in reference to the purposes incidentally subservetl by Coast Survey signals on the Florida coast and the published sketches: "We ran down inside the reef, from Cape Florida to Key West, without a pilot; and, though no one on board had been previously inside, we found our way without difficulty. The sketch of this part of the coast, published in the Coast Survey Report of 1851, was of great service. I was enabled by it to identify the islands; and the screw-pile signals on the reef served as beacons, pointing out dangers otherwise concealed. "These must be advantageous to vessels trading in and out of the Gulf, and, with a good look-out, cannot fail to prove in the day-time aids to the safe navigation of the coast." Mr. P. C. F. West served as aid in the party of Mr. Greenwell, and his services are mentioned in terms of praise. Interesting information, collected incidentally by Assistant Greenwell while engaged on duty in this section, will be found in extracts from his report. (Appendix No. 21.) 'This survey has been communicated to the Commio;~ioner and Astronomer of the Mexican boundary, Lieut. Col. Emory, at whose instance, under the authority and by request of the former Commissioner, General Robert B. Campbell, it was undertaken, and the connected triangulation and topography pressed forward to completion. The station-points used by Mr. Greenwell have been carefully secured. Hydrography.-The hydrography has been under the charge of Lieut. Comg. E. J. De Have~, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, by whom the schooner Arago was eqmpped early in March last. On the way out, the condition of the light-vessel on Ship shoal (Isle Derniere) was ascertained by Lieut. Comg. De Haven, at the request of the Light-house Board. On arriving at Galveston, it was found that the schooner Belle, which had sunk in Galveston bay, could not be repaired, so as to be available for work without considerable expense and delay; hence the sound-

ings required near Red Fish uar, and in East bay, were made at a great disadvantage with the Arago. The operations were also delayed by bad weather, arnl by desertions. The additional hydrography at the Rio Grande was attempted, but, from bad weather and other causes, was not executed. The work in \Vest bay was commenced; and the schooner Belle, having been raised, was placed under repair. The number of soundings made was 13,292; number of miles of soundings run, 264; number of angles observed, 498. The charts resulting from the work have been plotted and returned to the office. Tides.-The great irregularities of the tides at Galveston required a long series of observations there, which was closed in 1853, and the discussion of which has been steadily in progress under my immediate direction. Comparative observations were also made at Bolivar Point, and the self-registering gauge there gave good results for the law of rise and fall. The tides at East Bayou, at the entrance of the Mississippi, and also at Isle Dernicre, west of it, being of the class which ebbs and flows but once in twenty-four hours, except at special times of the month, we were not prepared for the frequent occurrence of the double tides at Galveston. The observations show, however, in ninety-seven tides, twenty of the single ebb and flood in the twenty-four hours, and seventy-seven of the double. This, it appears, however, is not an isolated case, as the observations of ~Ir. '\Y iirdemann at Calcasieu show a similar exception there. The tides have so small a rise and fall at Galveston, and are so much influenced by the wind and by its action on the expanse of water of Galveston bay, as to have much increased the difficulty in discussing these results. The observations were made by Mr. F. Muhr and Mr. L. E. Tansill. When the tidal observations at the Brazos were completed in October last, by Mr. Gustavus Wurdemann, he occupied a station at Aransas Pass for three months, and next repaired to Calcasieu. Since closing his work there be has been engaged in observing the tides of Nantucket sound and the adjacent coast, Section I. The tides .at the Brazos St. Iago, and at Aransas, are single-day tides, as completely as those of Pensacola or Fort Morgan, not breaking, as the moon crosses the equator, into two small tides, but retaining their special character through the whole lunar month. The curves for all these stations haYe been drawu, and they have been discussed, according to my method of decomposition, under my direction, by A8sistant L F. Pourtales and Mr. H. Heaton. The careful and consciencious observations of Mr. W urdemann show their full value in these discussions. The results will be published as completed. It may be of interest to present a condensed table showing the character of the tides from East Bayou, Mississippi entrance, passing by Isle Derniere, Calcasieu, Galveston, and Aransas, to the Brazos St. Iago.

REPORT OF THE

SUPI~RINTENDENT

SECTIONS X AND XL-COAST OF CALIFORNIA, AND OF OREGON AND W ASEINGTON TERRITORIES.

The survey has made good progress in both these sections. The year, which has been so unfavorable to the work on the ea8tern coast, has been generally the reverse on the Pacific. The great mass of preliminary surveys and reconnaissances required there have been nearly executed, and the regular operations have, in part, taken their place. Astronomical and magnetic stations have been added to those previously determined; and observations for longitude, by the solar eclipse of May 26, were made at Humboldt, near San Francisco, and at Benicia. The regular system of primary triangulation has been commenced by measuring the Pulgas base, and carrying the triangulation both northward and southward, so that now it extends from Sonoma Mount, in latitude 38░ 16', to Salinas Mount, in latitude 36░ 24', one hundred and twelve minutes of latitude, or from Ballenas bay to Point Pinos, Monterey bay. The preiiminary base, measured near San Jose, for beginning the triangulation of San Francisco bay and its dependencies, has been connected with, and verified satisfactorily by, the Pulgas base. A preliminary triangulation of the Straits of Rosario and Canal de Haro has been made, and the shore-line sketched in. Vertical angles for heights have been measured. Humboldt harbor has been triangulated, and a topographical survey of it made, from Eureka to a point one and a half mile south of the entrance. Upon the base, measured on the plain near Los Angeles, a triangulation has been carried northward and southward, determining the position of Santa Catalina island, and intended to connect the Santa Barbara islands and the main. The topography of the shores of San Francisco bay has been executed, and that of the outer coast bas been carried from Point Ano Nuevo to Monterey, and then north of Point Ano Nuevo, nearly to the connection with San Francisco bay. That of the shores of Tamales bay has been executed; that of the main coast, from north of Duxbury reef, along Ballenas bay, has been completed, to connect with San Francisco bay. The hydrography of the Straits of Rosario and Canal de Haro and approaches has been completed, and a reconnaissance made of Duwamish bay and Seattle harbor, and of Port Townsend anchorage. The reconnaissance from Puget's sound to the Columbia has been revised, and additional work has been done for the general reconnaissance of the coast. In the course of this northern work, a four-and-a-half.fathom bank bas been discovered at the entrance to the Straits of San Rosario. The survey of San Francisco entrance has been completed, and that of Duxbury reef and Ballenas bay connected with it. Some work has been done in the interior of the bay. Special surveys for light-houses have been made at Point Bonita, Point .Ano N uevo, Santa Cruz, and Anacapa. . The systematic observations of tides have been continued with excellent results. Perma!1ent self.registering gauges have been kept at Astoria, San Francisco, and San Diego.; the number of temporary stations required between San Diego and San Francisco has been completed; and in the next division north, nearly so. The deve1opments from these observations have been of a useful and interesting kindmost useful to navigators, as showing the laws of the diurnal inequality, which in the Pacific is large, causing a marked difference in the morning and afternoon tides of the same day. Within the year, drawings have been completed of the progress sketches for the

two sections, of Santa Cruz harbor, Point Ano Nuevo, Pulgas base, San Francisco entrance, Alden's reconnaissance north of San Francisco; tides of San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria; of anchorage at Shelter cove, Mendocino city, Crel'icent city, Point St. George, Ewing harbor, Umquah river. The engraving of Alden's reconnaissance San Diego to San Francisco, Cortez Bank, San DiPgo entrance, Rincon Point tidal diagrams, Pu1gas base, tidal diagrams of San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, has been completed during the year, and the others are in progress . .Astronomical and magneti"c observations.-Finding it impossible to reach Cape Mendocino to occupy an astronomical station there, Assistant George Davidson established one at Humboldt bay, in connection with the triangulation which he had laid out, and made the usual observations for time and latitude, until he received instructions to proceed to Washington Territory for the continuation of the triangulation of last year in the Gulf of Georgia. Mr. Davidson observed the beginning and end of the solar eclipse of May 26 at Humboldt, and the transit of the moon's second limb, and of the sun's second limb during the eclipse. The details of his observations will be found in Appendix No. 40, where his report is given at length. The statistics of his astronomical and magnetic work for 1853, which were not received in time for my annual report of last year, are as follows;

The statistics of astronomical work in Humboldt bay are as follows: For longitude, three hundred und twenty-six observations of the moon and moon culminating stars with transit C. S. No. 2, and an occultation of i Leonis. For latitude, eleven hundred and eighteen (1,118) observations on eighty-three pairs of stars with the zenith telescope C. S. No. 3, besides one hundred and fifty-om~ observations for the value of the micrometer screw. For magnetic declination, two hundred and thirty-seven observations were made upon nine different days with a Jones declinometer No. 3. Meteorological observations, eight hundred and eightytwo in number, were also taken. Assistant R. D. Cutts observed the eclipse at Black Mountain station, one of the primary points of triangulation near San Francisco, (Sketch J,) that station being selected as lik ly to overlook the fog p1иevailing at this season of the year. The details of the observations, extracted from Mr. Cutts' report, are given in Appendix No. 40, omitting those for the time observations. Mr. Cutts exerted himself successfully to induce other observers to co-operate with him. The obserи vations of Prof. Nooney, made at Benicia, are given in the Appendix No. 40. Others made near San Francisco are defective in reference to local time, and cannot be presented w~thout further information in regard to them.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge, Corps of Engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey, made preparations at Monterey to observe the solar edipse of May, but the weather there was cloudy. I was indebted to R. T. Paine, esq., of Boston, (whose persevering labors in the prediction of occultations and eclipses have earned so much approval,) for timely computations for points on the Western coast, which were forwarded to the assistants there. It will be seen that generally they were received in time to make the necessary arrangements for observing, and that the zeal of some of the officers had anticipated the instructions to observe. In addition to the charge of the tidal observations in these sections, Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge was instructed to make the usual magnetic observations whenever opportunity offered. During the year he has observed for declination, {variation.) dip, and intensity at four stations, namely: San Diego, San Pedro, San Luis Obispo, and Monterey. The observations for declination and horizontal intensity were with the portable declinometer of Weber and Lloyd, (C. S. No. 2 ;) for dip, with a Barro\v dip-circle, (C. S. No. 2.) At San Diego one set of results was obtained for declination, one for absolute horizontal intensity, and three, on three different days, for dip. At San Pedro, San Luis Obispo, and Monterey, seven sets for declination in counection with the azimuth of a mark, one for intensity, and three for dip. (See иAppendix No. 30.) )feasurement of Pulgas base.-The preliminary measurement of Pulgas base was executed during June, 1853, by Assistant ;R. D. Cutts. This base-line is situated about thirty miles southward of San Francisco, on the low lands bordering the bay, and presents every essential requisite for its purpose. Nearly twelve workingdays, between June 11th and June 27th, were expended in the actual measurement of 2,627 four-metre boxes, and the final corrected length was found to be 10,512.06 metres, or about six miles and a half. The extremities were marked by permanent monuments, the eastern end being 127.281 feet, and the western one 5.568 feet above high-water mark. Each of these monuments consists of an underground brick structure, enclosing a free-stone block, in which a copper bolt is sunk, and the extremity of the base is marked by cross-lines on the bolt-head, over which .a stone cap is laid. The measurement was executed with two iron rods of a half-inch diameter, each of which wa~ four metres long. The ends were squared, and one side of each was plated and marked with the limiting line. Ten comparisons of each with the Hassler two-metre bars E and H were made before and after the measurement; the value of the micrometer divisions having been deduced from twenty-five measureи ments of the graduations on a Hhn metre scale. Two inflexible oak-plank boxes and four trestles were employed for carrying and supporting the rods. Previous to each contact, the rod was levelled by a spirit-level with blocks and wedges. The alignment was made by a ten-inch Gambey theodolite, from one hundred and fifty to three hundred metres in advance. The contact was observed by means of the silk thread of a plumb-bob suspended in a bucket of water; and when this was correctly adjusted, the advanced rod was clamped and the rear box carried forward. The reading of an attached thermometer was recorded for each contact, and Hassler's proportional rate of expansion, 0.000006963535, was used in making the temperature reduction. Primary and secondary triangulation.-The primary triangulation of the coaBt, and the secondary and tertiary connected with it, have, under the charge of Assistant R. D. Cutts, taken their regular form and made excellent progress. Proceeding from the Pulga.."l base, (Sketch J,) and bringing the San Jose base into the series, the triangulation covers San Francisco bay and its depend-

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

79

encies, extending north to Ballenas bay, and south to :Monterey, a distance of about eighty-five miles. The triangulation connects the astronomical stations of San Francisco, Santa Cruz, and Point Pinos, and determines theи position of all the principal towns from Benicia to .Monterey, and of the different light-houses on this part of the coast. As primary points immediately along, or commanding a view of the coast, could not be had, a series of tertiary triangles were laid from Point Piedras to Santa Cruz. This series was commenced by Mr. C. 111. Bache, under Mr. Cutts' direction. From the line Red Hill-Contra Costa, (see Sketch J,) the triangulation extends northward and southward, with sides varying from fifteen and a half to forty-three and a half miles. Great elevations were selected for station points, in order to be above the fog; and experience has fully confirmed this course, for while the valleys are covered with fog, Mr. Cutts states that his primary observations have gone on without interruption, from January, when it was commenced, to late in September, the date of his report. The vapor-plane, or fog-plane, generally does not rise higher than about 1,800 feet above the level of the sea. Signal-poles were generally used, a heliotrope being required at but one station. The stations have been carefully marked with stones, intended to furnish permanent marks of reference. The following are the statistics of the work for the year ending September 30,

The measured length of the San Jose base, (merely a preliminary base,) of nine hundred aud forty one metres, (0.58 mile,) is stated to have differed from the computed length brought from the Pulgas base, through seventeen (17) triangles, but 0.03 metre, or one inch and two.tenths. Mr. Cutts observes: "Each angle belonging to the primary triangulation has been determined by one hundred to one hundred and twenty measurements, divided into eight or ten series of twelve repetitions each, six in the direct and six in the reversed positions of the telescope. These series were taken on different days, and under the usually varied condition of the atmosphere, and their arithmetical mean was adopted as the value of the angle. After deducting the spherical excesf', the six primary triangles close with the following errors : (-2. 05 ") ( +0.44") (-1.99") (-1.17'') (-1.69") (-1.77")." In relation to the names of the hills occupied as stations, Mr. Cutts, in his report, states that "every endeavor has been made to find out the original or popular names of the different hills and mountains selected for primary stations. So far as ascertained, with one or two exceptions, they are recognised by no regular desigи nation. I have, therefore, given them names characterisM'@ either of their appearance, form, or material, or from their vicinity to some well known ranch or village. The general sketch w~ll be sufficiently accurate to show their position, with respect to other and surroundmg features of the country."

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

A triangulation of the Straits of Rosario, Washington Territory, was commenced lasbllseason, by Assistant George Davidson; the signals were put up by Mr. James S. Lawson, and preliminary observations made upon them for the use of the sounding party. In February last the party went to Humboldt bay, and after a long detention off the bar, in gales, fogs, and hail-storms, succeeded in entering, and established the astronomical stations shown in Sketch J, connecting it with a tertiary triangulation from Eureka to about a mile and a half below the entrance of the bay. Mr. Davidson has suffered very much during the past year with chronic rheumatism; persisting, however, in keeping the field, that his work might be closed up at the end of the season, when he had received instructions to report on the Atlantic coast. The observations at Humboldt were completed in June, and Mr. Davidson re m ned to San Francisco to procure a vessel for the northern work; and after fitting her out, proceeded to Washington Territory. In compliment to the memory of one of the most meritorious officers of the Coast Survey, who died from exposure in its service, the vessel has, at Mr. Davidson's request, been called the "R. H. Fauntleroy." Finding that he would be detained through the best portion of the working season if he waited until the appropriation for the fiscal year became available, Mr. Davidson advanced his private means for carrying on his work, and left San Francisco in July for Puget's sound. This season was not favorable, from the prevalence of fogs and variable weather; but a rapid triangulation was made, and the shore-line sketched in within the limits shown by Sketches J and K, No. 4. This work was computed and plotted, and a copy furnished to the hydrographic party. A preliminary survey of Strawи berry bay formed part of the work of the season. Measurements for the heights of some of the principal hills were made with the sextant. Mr. Davidson's report is up to October 2. He was assisted, especially in the details of triangulation and topography, by Sub-Assistant James S. Lawson. The statistics of the tertiary triangulation, by Sub-Assistant J. S. Lawson, at Humboldt bay, are thus reported by Mr. Davidson: Twenty-one signals erected, eight stations occupied, fifty-eight angles measured by seven hundred and seventysix observations. At one station, vertical angles were measured for heights of several stations with a six-inch Gambey theodolite, vertical circle, No. 20. In the triangulation of the Straits of Rosario and the Canal de Haro, thirty-two stations were occupied, one hundred and thirty-five angles measured by nineteen hundred and sixty-eight (1,968) single measurements, and seventy-nine signals were erected. The heights of forty objects were determined by vertical angles measured at eleven stations. The report of Assistant George Davidson for 1853 not having been received before the date of closing my report for that year, I was unable to present the statistics which are essential to give an idea of the labor which he had performed. Those of the astronomical and magnetic work having been already given under their appropriate head, I now subjoin in the following table those relating to the triangulation.

In September, 1853, Captain E. 0. C. Ord, U. S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, took the place of Assistant George Davidson, who had been temporarily in charge of the triangulation of the islands off the coast of California, and occupied in the course of the first season the six stations marked on the Sketch J, Northwest beach, West beach, Dominguez Hill, San Pedro, Las Balsas, and Los Ceritos; the triangulation resting upon the Los Angelos base measured by Mr. Davidson, and. determining the position of Santa Catalina island from the base San Pedro-Los Ceritos. The dotted lines of the sketch show how Santa Barbara island is reached in the scheme of triangulation. The examination of the main, near the Santa Barbara islands, showed that no base of suitable length could be had nearer than the pljiins, where the measurement was made in the winter of 1852-'53. Captain Ord was prepared, at the date of his report in July, to take the field as soon as the appropriation for the year was available. His triangulation covers an area of about four hundred and twenty-one square miles, and in the course of it twelve hundred observations were made. The computations have been sent to the office. Topograpliy.-Sub-Assistant James S. Lawson, under the direction of Assistant George Davidson, executed the topography of Tomales bay, coast of California, entrance and approaches. (See Sketch J.) In attempting to enter the bay, the vessel in which he had taken passage was wrecked, and the persons composing the party were only saved by the presence of mind and exertions of Mr. Lawson. (Appendix No. 60.) They succeeded in getting the instruments and the greater part of the stores and equipments safely on shore before the vessel went to pieces. Mr. Lawson sent intelligence of their disaster to San Francisco, and proceeded at once to execute his work, :finishing it in the latter part of January. Subsequently the shore-line of Humboldt bay was run by Mr. Lawson in connection with his own triangulation. The topography of Tamales bay furnished eight miles of shore-line', and about one and a half square miles of area. That of Humboldt bay determined twenty-six miles and a half of shore-line, and ten square miles of area. Mr. Lawson assisted Mr. Davidson in sketching the shores of the Straits of Rosario, W ~hington Territory, in the preliminary survey already noticed. A tertiary triangulation, connecting with the work near San Francisco bay, was made by Sub-Assistant A. F. Rodgers, on which he based a plane-table survey of Ballen~ bay .and J?uxburr reef. (Sketch Ji Sheets Nos. 9, 13, and 14.) The shore-h!le, from Po11!-t Av1sadera, San Francisco bay, towards P.oint Mateo, was determmed and furmshed to Lieut. Comg. Alden, for the use of the hydrographic party; and subsequently Plane-table Sheet No. 16 was finished between the two points just named. The topography of Point San Pedr,o was executed, thus completing the southern approaches.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

.Mr. Rodgers reports that the most difficult portion of the topography of San Francisco bay is completed; whether J1egard is had to the difficulties of the ground, or to those arising from fogs, winds, and variable weather. In the execution of the above triangulation, Mr. Rodgers occupied seven stations, observed on twelve objects, and measured forty-three angles by seven hundred and ninety-six observations. Sub-Assistant Rodgers has continued the topography of the coast north of San Francisco, shore of Ballenas bay, completing two sheets, Nos. 13 and 14, (Sketch J,) one extending nearly to Duxbury reef~ and the other passing about three miles north of it. This work rests on a tertiary triangulation made by him and extends towards the local survey made by Assistant Davidson near Point Reyes, Sir Francis Drake's bay. The ground is of a very difficult character to represent, consisting of abrupt hills and deep gorges. Mr. ltodgers has also completed Sheet No. I G, (Sketch J,) from Point Avisadera, San Francisco bay, south of the city, to Point San .Mateo, near the Pulgas base. .Mr. Rodgers present8 the following statistics of his topographical work: sixtythree miles of shore-line surveyed, twenty miles of roads run; area embraced, thirty-one and three-quarters square miles. He also reports forty miles of shoreline in revision of former work. Three plane-table sheets have been inked and returned to the office, together with duplicates of his observations and computations of the tertiary triangufation. During the season Mr. Cutts reports that the topographical sheet embracing Guano island and San Mateo was completed by Mr. C. M. Bache, sub-assistant in his party, and who had also made some progress in the next sheet at the date of his resignation in August. . The topography of Monterey bay, from Point Aiio Nuevo (see Sketch J, No. 4) to the Pajaro river, was completed by Assistant A. M. Harrison, before leaving the Western coast, in March last. The survey included one of Santa Cruz and its vicinity, and of Point Auo Nuevo for light-house purposes. There are four sheets of this work; which are very creditable specimens of topography, and show this bold coast to great advantage. The winter was remarkably mild and favorable for work, and advantage was taken of every opportunity for its execution. Mr. Harrison was one of the pioneers of the survey on this coast; being one of four young officers of the survey, who, at a time when our resources were crippled by the ,sudden changes in California, undertook to work their way forward under any difficulties that might occur. Theyи faithfully redeemed their pledge, and Mr. Harrison's services there have well earned the praise now bestowed. In returning to the Atlantic coast, Mr. Harrison's party was placed in charge of Sub-Assistant W. M. Johnson, detailed to relieve him, and who had for some months been at work with him. Mr. Johnson proceeded with this work from the mouth of the Pajaro river to the junction with the sheet of Monterey, surveyed by Assistant R. D. Cutts, completing three sheets by the 10th of July. Referring to the country which he had surveyed, Mr. Johnson says: "The contrast between this (near Monterey) and the country north of the Salinas is most striking. There, all is beauty and fertility, and settlers are rapidly converting, by their labor, the rich meadow and table-lands into gardenspots unequalled for productiveness, even in the prolificи State of Ca!Mornia; here, on the other hand, nothing is to be seen but one wild desert of SMld, producing sparingly but the coarsest grasses and shrubs, and entirely destitute of fresh water. This waste extends from the Salinas to Monterey, and back for some miles from the coast. The water used in this camp we are compelled to haul from the Salinas

river."

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

83

Landing at Pigeon Point, north of Ano Nuevo, in September, Mr. Johnson has commenced the topography between the last named point and Point San 11edro, which will give a continuous belt of shore topography from Point Lobos, San Francisco bay, to Point Pinos, Monterey bay. Mr. Johnson reports the following statistics of his season's work: Number of miles of shore-line, 84!-; area surveyed, 18 square miles. Some interesting remarks, also contained in his report, will be found in Appendix No. 22. IIydro,qmpliy.-Previous to the date of my last report, Lieut. Comg. James Alden, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, had returned from his reconnaissance in Washington Territory, chiefly of the Gulf of Georgia. During the cruise, the steamer Active obtained at the Hudson's Bay Company's mines, on Vancouver's island, through the kindness of Governor Douglass, a supply of coal of excellent quality, which was put on board the steamer by the natives in canoes, at a very reasonable rate. Coal иwas also obtained at Bellingham bay, where mines had just been opened. After completing the work of reconnaissance on returning, Lieut. Comg. Alden was called upon to end a disturbance between the whites and natives at New Dungeness, arresting an alleged murderer, an Indian, who had taken refuge among the tribe, encamped on the sand-spit opposite the settlement. A refusal to give up the offender had resulted in a battle between the parties, in which blood was shed. The man was secured and delivered to the commanding officer at Fort Steilacoom, to await the requisition of the civil authorities. The hydrography of San Francisco entrance has been completed by Lieut. Comg. Alden; and on the northern side, Ballenas bay and Duxbury reef have been sounded out and connected with the entrance. Some work has also been done near Point A visadera, and between that and Point Bruno. The steamer Active requiring repairs, was taken to Benicia for that purpose; and the amount expended absorbing that allotted to the party for the season, the vessel was temporarily placed at the disposal of the War Department, under an arrangement with Major General John E. Wool, commanding the department of the Pacific, and with the approval of the Hon. Secretary of War. The means thus obtained enabled Lieut. Comg. Alden to continue his work in San Francisco bay, while he rendered effective service to the War Department, and enabled the General to avoid the large outlay which must otherwise have been incurred. Lieut. Comg. Alden acknowledges the facilities offered in repairs by the dry dock at Benicia, and returns acknowledgments to Mr. Dean, the superintendent, in a letter to Commodore Smith, chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks. (Appendix No. 62.) In referring to his work in Washington Territory, Lieut. Comg. Alden says: "The only discovery of importance which we made, was of a shoal place between the island of Lucia and the main, near the entrance to Rosario strait; the least w~t.er found on it was four and a half fathoms. The knowledge of this will enable sailmg-vessels in calm weather to anchor when the tide is adverse. At his anchorage in San Francisco bay, May 8th, application was made to Lieut. Comg. Alden, by the owners of the steamer "Sea Bird," to relieve that vessel, which had been rendered entirely unmanageable by an accident to her machinery. The vessel was found under Point Conception, near El Coxo, after having drifted t:vo hund;ed miles; and being taken in tow by the Active was secured at San Francisco. .LI?eral acknowledgments of this service have been made. The mc1dents of the sea.rch will be found in detail in a letter from Lieut. Comg. Alden. (Appendix No. 61.)

REPORT OP THE SUPERINTENDENT

While engaged in the survey of Duxbury reef and Ballenas bay, on the 14th of June, Lieut. Comg. Alden relieved the steam-packet Peytona, which had become disabled on her passage from San Francisco to Oregon. The vessel was safely brought to port in tow of the Active. At the close of July, Lieut. Corng. Alden proceeded to Columbia river, and thence along the coast, for the correction of his previous reconnaissance. He supplied the steamer with coal at Bellingham bay, and then passed up Admiralty inlet and made a hydrographic reconnaissance of Duwamish bay, about forty miles from the entrance of the inlet on its east side, and of the harbor of Seattle, which forms part of the bay. A similar reconnaissance was also made of Point 'Townsend anchorage. The survey of the Straits of Rosario and the Canal de Haro, and their approaches, was completed by the 19th of September, and the steamer returned southward, making deep-sea soundings, and re-determining the position of Point Grenville. The distance run betw~n the time of leaving San .Francisco and returning is reported as two thousand three hundred and sixty (2,360) miles; in the course of which, four hundred and four (404) miles of soundings were run. 1i"des.-The tidal observations under Lieut. W. P. Trowbridge, Corps of Engineers, assistant in the Coast Survey, have made excellent progress. At the three more permanent stations we have now more than twelve months of observations, while the pl.an for the intermediate ones has been filled up between San Diego and San Francisco, and partly so between San Francisco and Astoria. This has been accomplished with much effort, and great credit is due to Lieut. Trowbridge and those who aided him in the work. I give entire, in the Appendix No. 30, his report of the year's work, to September, 1854, which, with the reference to Sketch J, where the positions of the tide-gauges are shown, will make the details of the work more clear. Lieut. Trowbridge commends especially, among his observers, T. A. Szabo, Corporal Wayne, Mr. A. Cassidy, and Mr. James A. Black. The self-registering tide-gauge of Mr. Saxton has proved invaluable in these observations, on the score both of accuracy and economy. The observations have been kept up for two or more lunations, according to circumstances, at all of the intermediate stations. Of these, San Diego, San Pedro, San Luis Obispo, Monterey, and San Francisco, form a set from a degree to a degree and a half of latitude apart. . Higher up the coast there is more difficulty in occupying stations, from the scarcity of settlements and the difficulty of access from the sea or by land. Humboldt and Port Orford had been selected, and results returned from both, and I doubt not that whatever can be done to carry out the full plan will be accomplished by Lieut. Trow bridge. The sheets of observations have been transmitted with regularity to the office, where the results are tabulated, and put into the appropriate forms for reduction. Owing to the care taken to instruct the observers in the use of the meteorological instruments, the observations made in connection with the tides will have considerable interest. My attention was called by Assistant Pourtales to the fact that during the last summer, at Port Orford, latitude 42░ 44' N., (that of Newburyport, nearly,) longitude 124░ 28 1 W., between the 21st of July and 21st of August the thermometer had not at any time risen above 71░; and that at Humboldt bay, latitude 40░ 44', ( ne~rly that of New York,) longitude 124░ 09' W., during the same period, it had not risen above 61░, presenting a most desirable summer climate. I have directed that the observations be reduced that we may at once obtain the eoncluи sions to be derived from them. ' The magnetic observations made by Lieut. Trowbridge will be found noticed under their appropriate head.

In the Appendix No. 46 will be found a paper read by me before the American Association for the Advancement of Science, containing, as the first fruits of the observations of Lieut. Trowbridge, a comparison of the diurnal inequality of the tides at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria. This inequality so affects the tides on the Western coast, that the difference in height of a morning and afternoon high-water at Diego may amount to two feet and seven-tenths, at San Francisco to two feet, and at Astoria to two feet and two-tenths; and the interval between the time of moon's transit over the meridian and the time of high water may vary between the morning high water and afternoon high water, two hours at Astoria, two hours and a quarter at San Francisco, and three hours at San Diego. Its importance to the navigator is therefore very great. The discussion for low water as well as for high is made, and simple relations connecting the inequality with the moon's declination are given. I do not repeat these results in this place, because they are so readily found in the article itself in the Appendix, and the diagrams serve to render them more clear than a mere verbal statement alone would do. I have shown above, that, in certain cases, this inequality is of importance, and the average result given below will establish this still more strongly, especially as the inequality of low water is even greater than that of high.

That it follows a simple law, as the moon recedes from the equator, is shown by the series of numbers for increasing declinations, as at Astoria 0.0, 0.3, 0. 7, 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 1. 7, 1.8, corresponding to the greatest declination, north or south. Li'gkt-lwuses, &c.-The question of the expediency of placing a light-house at Santa Cruz, California, (see Sketch J, No. 4,) was referred to the Light-house Board, under the law, and an examination was made by Lieut. Comg. T. H. Stevens, in the schooner Ewing, and by Assistant A. M. Harrison. There being no seacoast light at Ano Nuevo, and the superior importance of that object being obvious, their examination included both points. The report of Lieut. Comg. Stevens was transmitted, with his approval, by Lieut. Comg. Alden, the chief of the hydrographic party, and will be found in the Appendix No. 67. The subsequent report of Mr. Harrison, which was forwarded with the topographical sheets of Point Ano Nuevo and Santa Cruz, will be found also in Appendix No. 67, with my letter containg a review of the action in the matter. Anacapa island was also examined, in reference to placing a light-house upon it, by Lieut. Comg. T, H. Stevens, in the schooner Ewing. His report, giving the reasons why he considers the erection of a light there undesirable, is contained in Appendix No. 66; and the sketch of the island, in Sketch J, No. 3. Instructions have been given for the re-examination of the site at San Pedro, and for examinations at Punta de los Reyes, Point Lobos, harbor of Santa Cruz, harb~r of Santa Barbara, Ana.capa, or Santa Cruz island, California; Umquah, Oregon Tern-

OFFICE-WORK.

The office has continued during the past year under the charge of Captain H. W. Benham, of the Corps of Engineers, who has devoted successfully all the energies of a strong mind, directed by ample preparation, to its administration. Keeping up the efficiency of those divisions which were already the most effective, he has labored assiduously to bring the others to the same point, and will, I doubt not, ultimately succeed in so doing. The computing and tidal divisions have again carried off the pa,lm of greatest usefulness. The drawing division has gained; and probably the engraving, though there is, in my judgment, still great room for improvement in zeal and effectiveness. If the hopes entertained of applying photography to engraving are realized, the electrotype division will again take the lead of all competitors, for usefulnes~. Captain Benham reports in general favorably of those engaged in office duty, and of the amount of work as compared with that of former years. He remarks: "The services of Passed :Midshipman W. D. Whiting, U. S. N., assigned to the office some time since as hydrographic officer, have proved of great value in the revision of the sailing-lines and directions for our new charts, and in the general verification of hydrography, as also in the duties with which he has been charged in relation to the repairs and refitting of the vessels of the survey, at the ship-yards in Baltimore, &c. "I feel assured that the services of a faithful and intelligent officer of the navy are indispensable for these duties, and I have great pleasure in acknowledging the efficient manner in which they have been performed by Mr. Whiting, and his cordial aid and co-operation on all occasions when called on." Captain Benham acknowledges the assistance derived from Mr. Hein, general disbursing agent of the survey, and from Mr. Saxton, assistant in weights and measures, in their relations to the office; and from Captain Gibson, U. S. A., when in charge of the office during the temporary absences of the assistant in charge. The divisions of the office are the same as last year, with one exception, viz: 1st, the COMPUTING; 2d, the TIDAL; 3d, the DRAWING; 4th, the ENGRAVING; 5th, the ELECTROTYPING; 6th, the PRINTING; 7th, the PUBLISHING, DISTRIBUTING, and SALE; 8th, the INSTRUMENT MAKING, and CARPENTRY; and, 9th, the ARCHIVES AND LIBRARY. The plan of work adopted at the beginning of the year has necessarily been varied from to an unusual degree, but the endeavor to conform to its arrangements jg useful, as preventing wide deviations from system. The changes, especially in the army officers engaged in the office, have rendered the administration of details less steady than was desirable. On these subjects Captain Benham in his annual report to me remarks: "The arrangement for the administration of the duties has continued essentially the same as ~eretofore, attempts having been made to secure as far as possible that great desideratum for the continued successful progress of the office duties-a permanence of t~e personnel, in reference to the employes of the several divis~o~~, .as well ~s m the more im~?rtant cases of those charged with .the resp?ns1b1li~1es ~f their management. "\'\ ithout this permanence, the valuable mformat1on acquired m any one month or year may be lost in the next, as is too often the case

now, in reality leading so frequently to the conviction that more important facts have been known and lost than all that are at the present time retained in the memory of the persons employed; thus producing great irregularity and confusion, loss of labor and the means of the survey, in the proper carrying out of the different duties This conviction has, I fear,~een too often brought to your own mind, from the frequent calls upon yourself (so much increasing your labors) for decisions and for information that you have appeared to feel had been many times given by yourself previously." It is well known that no written forms or detailed directions will supply the place of personal experience; and I have cordially seconded the endeavors of Captain Benham to place in the office, as his general assistant, a permanent officer capable of relieving him from numerous details which press him, as well in the immediate control of the office as in acting for the Superintendent, in very many cases with the departments, other government officers, and with Congress, and of taking his place in cases of temporary absences for inspection of parties or on the business of the work. In following the progress of the divisions of the office, I shall quote largely from Captain Benham's report. While I take personal cognizance by monthly reports of the progress of each division of the office, and study carefully the laying out of the work and the execution, the assistant in charge gives his personal supervision and attention to the details as well as the general progress of the whole establishment. "The computing and tidal divisions, from the continuance of the same persons in charge, as well as from the fact that the principal members remain the same, have proved to be the most regular, efficient, and economical, in relation to their duties, of any of the branches of the office. "Of the computing division, on the excellent organization of which I have previously remarked, I have again to express, as in confirmation of my report of last year, my satisfaction with reference to the industry, faithfulness, and efficiency of the officers in charge--Assistant J. E. Hilgard, chief of the division, (present but a few months of the year,) and Mr. Charles A. Schott, upon whom the duties have devolved during Mr. Hilgard's absence in the field. "From the increased experience of its members this division has been enabled to report a greater amount of work executed in the present, compared with the previous year. The occupations have been, from time to time, varied, thus giving to each person a general facility in the duties of the division. The current fieldwork of the year has been brought up as it came in, and all calls from the office for information have been promptly responded to. "In addition to the usual duties, the officers in charge have been occupied in adjusting and computing various geodetic and astronomical observations, and in conducting experiments with magnetic instruments at the Smithsonian Observatory, where some interesting results were obtained in connection with observations made during the solar eclipse of May, for the reports of which, as well as the details of the distribution of the different classes of work among the members of the computing division, I would respectfully refer to the report of Mr. Scllott, herewith submitted." (See Appendix No. 31.) The general distribution of duties among the members of the division has been as follows: Mr. E. Nulty has made the computations for azimuth and latitude; .Mr. J. .Main has made the reductions of transits and of differences of longitude by chronometers, and has revised astronomical and magnetic computations; Mr. T. W Werner has computed the triangulations generally; and Mr. G. Rumpf has mad.e the revisions and adjustments, a.nd has attended to the register of geopraphical pos1-

tions ; Mr. J. Wiessner bas reduced moon culminations, and other miscellaneous, astronomical, and geodetic observations; Mr. J. T. Hoover bas acted as clerk to the division, and bas made miscellaneous computations. Mr. Hilgard and Mr. Schott have both rendered valuable services in the discussion of various physical observations connected with magnetism, tidal cuhents, &c. 2. Tt'dal div'ision.-It has been found convenient to recognise this division, in a portion of its relations, as one of those of the office, as constant reference must be made to its results for the maps and charts, and its archives form a part of those of the office. The observations are under my more immediate direction, with Assistant Pourtales as the chief of the party, and the investigations are necessarily carried on in the same way. The results obtained by the observers and computers have been noticed in their appropriate places in the body of the report. as well as those of Lieut. Trowbridge, Mr. Fairfield, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Wurdeman. Captain Benham observes: "In the ti'dal division, under the charge of Assistant L. F. Pourtales, whose faithful devotion to his duties, and kindly action in the work under all circumstances, it gives me pleasure to acknowledge-the directions being still given by, and the reports made to, yourself-the accompanying statement of the chief is submitted, as requiring, perhaps, less of remark on my part than other cases. Mr. Pourtales, in remarking upon the zeal and interest manifested by the members of the division generally, makes special mention of Messrs. Mitchell, A very, and Heaton, and the tabular statement accompanying his report gives in brief the sum of the information, as far as received, in relation to the character of the observations at the thirty-three tidal stations occupied on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts, including dates, names of observers, &c., &c.; (see Appendix No. 31.) The more permanent officers of this party have been engaged as follows: Mr. H. Mitchell was employed chiefly in the discussion of the Boston tides, and has been assisted by Mr. R. S . .Avery and Mr. Kincheloe j Jfr. Heaton in the discussion of tides in the Gulf of Mexico, under my more immediate direction; Mr. D . .A. Burr, temporarily attached, has discussed a station of river-tides, by Mr .и .Airy's method, and Mr. Hawley has read off the self.registering tide-sheets, and made reductions in the ordinary forms; Mr. 0. Fendall, Mr. Nes, and Mr. Blanchard have also been engaged in the ordinary reductions ; Mr. L. W. Meech has been engaged, under my immediate direction, in investigations connected with the mathematical theory of the tides and their practical application. 3. Drawi'.n_q di'vi'sion.-" In the drawing division, by far the most important and responsible of the whole, as far as the publication of the results of the survey is concerned, its chief, Captain .A . .A. Gibson, has, from his long experience in the division, shown a knowledge of its necessities and of its duties in the regulation of the work, adapting it generally to the capacities and fitness of the draughtsmen, with much extended information and aptitude in the important subject of the_ preparation of projects of the maps of the survey, that with his untiring industry and activity would, with this re,sponsibility and care alone resting upon him, have left but little to be desired for the entirely successful and efficient direction of the force of this main-spring division of the office. "This division, ~JI have the satisfaction of reporting, has remained essentially the same as to the principal members, and, as a consequence, the labors upon our :finer charts have progressed with the usual rapidity and excellence." "In the continued improvement in the already superior execution of our fi.rstclass draughtsmen, though the reductions from the larger field-drawings of every minute detail with such unsurpassed accuracy, as well as their subsequent transfer to the copper, by the skill of the most accomplished engravers, may protract the

publication of our finer maps, an<l make the first cost of the preparati011 of these specimens of topographical art appear somewhat large. It is, bm1cYcr, p:ratifying to feel that this expense woultl seem to be comparatively triflirg in consideration of the fact that, these plates once oLtained, from the asrnrec1 d:ill cf our electrotype division we can reproduce, by chemical means, an indefinite nmn ber of others--fac similes of the original plates-:.i.t a trifiiug expell"c n}yrn: foe rncTc cost of tlie crude copper, and which may yield any number of proof irn11re:;:sions of the map:; required for the supply of the commerce of the world; an\1 a1l from these single fine original phtes." The duties of the division haYe been distributed nearly as follows, (see Appendix ~ o. 31 :) Assistants ff. JI. C. Pai"1:fa:r and .Jf. ,J. Jfc Cle;иy, and JDи. Joseph 1relsh. have been occupied in the finer reductions of topography; .Jfr. .J J. Ricketts anc1 ]}fr . .J R. P. J1Iechlin in the higher grades of hyclrographic reduction. J1Ir. L. D.

Campbell, have been employed on tracings and rnisec1lancons work. Engravtliff dirision.-Tbc increasing general de1mrncl for Iirstиclass topographical engravers (perhaps somewhat eHhanced by the large orders of Congreoos for tbcir work) has pre:ocntcd c1ifliculties in the maintenance of a force in this diYision suftlcient to keep CYCn pace with the supply of material by the field parties, and its preparation in t11e other branches of the oftice; Captain Denham has. with measurable success, given his personal attention to the subject, иwith a Yiew to proYide remedies against further inconvenience in this respect. He has succeeded in attaching several reliable and skilfnl artists to supply the places of those who have left the division, and confidently expresses the expectation of being enabled to maintain the usual force. He alludes with satisfaction to the increased skill of the apprentices; and intimates the probability of having ready for publication, perhaps by the close of the year, a larger num her of charts than usual at that period, and of having other :first-class charts of harbors on the Atlantic, Gulf~ and иwestern coasts well adиrnnced for publication in the ensuing year. Captain Benham remarks: '~The division has, since the month of April, been under the charge of Lieut. .T. C. Clark, of the army, whose industry and faithful attention to the duties, even in their minor details, will, with his constantly-increasing information, ellable him, I feel assured, to be very useful in that branch of the ?ffice." "The labors of this division have progressed steadily, and, as anticipa.ted 11;1 my last report, a large number of charts are expected to be ready for puhhcat10n by the close of the year, among which are the three first-class charts of Long Island sound, a similar chart of Salem harbor, Massachusetts, and the harbors of Newburyport, .Massachusetts, and Charleston, South Carolina, and a second sheet of Alden's reconnaiss;mce of the Western coast. Others, including charts of Boston harbor, Muskeget channel, south side Long Island (No. 2,) Albemarle sound, and Mobile bay, have been so much advanced as to give the expectation of their publication in the ensuing year. "The sketches for the annual report of last year occupied. the greater part of the tim~ of the second-class engravers and apprentices from the date of that report until the month of June, the sketches being all prepared before they were needed by the transfer printer. ''The engravers have since been occupied on the Rmall harbor charts and t~e sketches in preparation to accompany this report, which afford ample variety, m the character of the work, and give useful employment to all the apprentices now

engaged in the office.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

"The change of arraugements in the cugnging of apprentices, by which they arc now paid only for work of Ya1ue, as st1ggc,.tE.иu in my report of last year, has been very satisfactory, and such as to encourage the continuance of the system, with a limited numLer of young men of good character and indm:trious habits, who may eventually supply all the necessities of the oillee. "Ae<.:ornpauying thi,,; is sul1mittcd the report of the engraving cfrdi:iion, in which the different charts in hand during the year, and the persons occupied on each rcspcctiYely, arc specified, and the titles of the charts completed, in progress, &c." (See Appendix Ko. 31.) The fine иwork of topography arnl hy<lrography has been executed by Messrs. F Dankwortli, A. Rnlli, and .T. Toung, and the fine lettering by J Knight, in the oftice, and 011 contract by Messrs. 1'.:. F 1foodward and B. l'cager, of Philadelphia, anrl by Jfr. G.J.fcCoJJ, ofXew York. ~Iessrs. S. Siebert, W Smith, 11 Knight, and J T~ ...:\~ Throop, have also been employed during part of the year. Four apprentices-J J l\.rn'glit, R. F Barile, 8. W Bradley, and F. le Benner-have been employed on the preliminary charts and sketches during the year; and three-H. G. Evans, J. 8. Pettit, and C'. P Smith-during a great part of the year. Parts of several maps lian' been execute<l. out of the otlice, on contract, by other engravers. Electrotyping.-In this division most important experiments have been in progress for obtaining by chemical means, directly from the drawings, engraved plates for printing. This is a double application of photography and electro-metallurgy, in both of which Mr. J.lfatltiot, the chief of the electrotype division, is an adept. The results thus far obtained are very encouraging. Captain Benham, in his report, remarks: "To provide, hmvever, if possible, the means of getting out our charts more expeditiously, and, as it may be hoped, to dispense to a great degree, if not entirely, with the slow and tedious process of engraving by the hand on copper, Mr. Mathiot has been furnished with the necessary means and directed to make experiments in onler to ascertain the possibility of accomplishing this object. His special report upon the experiments already made is hereto appended, (Appendix No. 31 ;) and, although he has not yet accomplished all that is desirable, the specimens from his Plwtengraph, or plwto-electro engraved plates, are most interesting, and such as to warrant strong hopes of ultimate success. In the copy of a part of one of the finer plates, the hachures of the hills, lettering, outlines, &c., are remarkably distinct; and, with some slight retouching by the graver, the plate might insure a saving of at least half the labor spent upon a duplicate engrnved by the usual method. "It is hoped that one or more of the sketches for the annual report may be successfully engraved by the meaus now referred to, as samples of what may be accomplished with the present advancement in the experiments. Such of the drawings as it is thought may be most successfully copied by the new process are now in preparation for this purpose. "In the regular w.ork of the division, seventy-seven plates have been made; of the whole number of castings, forty-two were bassos or printing plates, and thirtyfive altos; in addition to which, several plates have been prepared for the use of the engravers at a cost of little over one-third of that of planished plates obtained by purchase." The following work is reported by Captain Benham from the Printing Dlvision, under Mr. S. D. O'Brien, with Mr. John Rutherdale, as assistant printer; the work being under the special supervision of Lieut. Clark, of the engraving division: " Forty-eight thousand three hundred impressions from plates of C. S. maps and sketches, including twenty-four hundred proofs for distribution, quarterly records, &c.,

and t;venty-one thousand five hundred on thin paper for the sets of maps, now Leing prepared in atlas form, as ordered for special distribution; the alion number of sheets being over double that of those reported last year, иwith the same force, and expenditure for servиices, iu this division. "The number of impre:,;si011s taken has been sufikient to meet the demand from our agents, and for the' distribution to libraries and other institutions authorized liy the Treasury Department. The report in detail of the several plates printed from is hereto appended. (Appendix .No. 31.) "Nine thousand impressions of eleven different charts have been distributed from the office to the principal departments, and to institutions designated by the members of the House of Representatives in their respectiYe districts throughout the country. "Tl~e distri1mtion of the Superintendent's annual report of 1852 has not been entirely completed, owiug to the failure of the Senate biuder to deliver, until towards the close of October, some fourteen hundred copies. The report of distribution of maps, and of the Superintendent's annual report, is given in detail in Appendix No. 31. "There have been added to the archives and library, during the past year, two hundred and thirty volumes, of which one hundred and twenty-two of the most necessary scientific works were purchased. The remainder have been presented by foreign governments, aml hy institutions in this country. "ln the instrument-slap repairs have been made upon some eighty of the most important instruments, including in the nnmber twenty-nine theodolites, six reeonnoitrin,g: telescopes, fifteen plane-tables, twenty-three sextants, six self-registering tide-gauges, one aneroid barometer, and seventeen clocks and watches. "Among the instruments constructed in the shop arc four self.registering tidegauges, four plane-tables, six deep-sea thermometers, and parts of five others, six heliotropes, two stands for theodolites, three reconnoitring telescopes, four threearmed and two circular protractors, and many other instruments required in the work of the survey, as scales, triangles, shade-glasses, and tools of various kinds. "The force in the shop now consists of three first-class instrument makers, including the chief; two of the second class, and three apprentices; and a blacksmith, who is also, when required, an assistant to the electrotypist. "In the carpenter shop there have been made, during the year, eight plane-table boards, ten drawing-boards, twenty-four cases for instruments, s:ich as heliotropes, deep-sea thermometers, protractors, &c., a large case for the archives, and all necessary repairs to the office buildings, and additions to the office furniture. All the instruments required by field and hydrographic parties having been packed in the shop, and in addition to the ordinary work, a portable observatory has been constructed." Captain Benham speaks in terms of approval of the services of Mr. T~ .h: Ki'n,q, in charge of the map room, and distribution of maps and reports, and of 1lfr. G. 1J. Snow, in charge of the archives. He also makes special mention of the faithful and efficient services of .Afr. .A. W Bussell, the chief clerk of the office, in charge of the clerical force, and of the office files and accounts. The services of Mr. J. Vierbuchen, in charge of the instrument-making; of Jfr. TI'. T. lVood, in charge of the carpentry; and the carefulness and fidelity of tl~e office messengers and watchmen, and especially of the chief messenger, ]Jamel Flynn, are strongly commended. Th.e serv~ces o~и Lieut. E. B. Hunt, of the Corps of Engineers, have already b~en mentioned m various parts of the report. Besides the duties referred to, and con-

tributions rnade by the investigation of different special subjects, he has had charge of the transfer printing of the plates accompanying my report of 1853, printed by order of the Senate and Honse of Representatives. Pro.f Peudleton, C S. N., has, in addition to the Gulf Stream discussions, been employed in continuing computations for longitudes. I cannot close this report without expressing my sense of the faithful and zealous services of Samuel Hein, Esq., the general disbursing agent of the Coast Survey. The numerous accounts with the separate parties, and with individuals, arc kept with the greatest order and method, so that he is at all times able to furnish promptly the minute information necessary in regard to these, in directing the various operations of the Survey. Charged with the care of the property of the Survey when not in the hands of the officers for use, his economy and system make themselves also felt in this department. His scrupulous execution of every part of his duty cannot be too highly praised. The faithful discharge of duty, and the system and order of the clerk to the Superintendent, TI~ lY Cooper, Esq., deserve also my acknowledgment. Respectfully submitted, by A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey. Hon. JAMES GUTHRIE, Secretary of the Treasury.

APPENDIX No. 8.

General list of Coast Survey dii;coveries and developments to 1853 inclitsive, compiled by Lieutenant E. B. Hunt.
As the operations of the Survey advance along the coast, important facts before unknown are constantly brought to light. Many facilities for, and dangers to, navigation are thus discovered, which had been before wholly unknown, and those before but imperfectly known are developed b~и accurate surveys. Many such developments and discoveries occur in the geodetic and topn~raphical operations, some of which are of no slight value; but thm;e which are embraced in the hyclrographic work are often of vital importance to commerce and navigation. The following flst presents some of the most important items of this nature, and may coll(иetively be regarded as exhi1Jiting one of the most valuahle results of the Survey. In fact, each sheet which gives shore-line and hydrography with increased accuracy has somewhat of discovery or development. to claim; but in this ligt only those cases are included in which a specific benefit has been conferrrd on navigation, either by unfolding some new facility, disclosing some serious danger, or indicating some important change of configuration. The arrangement is i;eographical, and in the order of sections.

Let.ter from the Superint1!,ndenJ to the Secretary of the Tre.<uury r,ommunicating the discorerzr, by Lieut. Oomg. H. S. Htellwagen, U.S. N., assistant in the CoMt Survey, of an important banlc at the entrance to MWJsachusetts bay. COAST SURYEY STATION, NEAR CAMDEN, MAINE, Nov. 20, 1854.
Sm: I have the great gratification to announce to you the discovery, by J,ieut. Comg. H. S. Stellwagen, in the entrance to Massachusetts bay, of a bank, which must 3и

18*

REPORT OF TITE SUPERINTENDENT

be of great importance to navigators as a guiding-mark. The least water on the bank is ten and a half fathoms at six and a half nautical miles N. 30i 0 \V. (true) from Race Point light, Cape Cod. It lies generally outside of a line from Race Point Ii ght to Thatcher's Island light, Cape Ann; is seventeen nautical miles in length, :five miles at its greatest breadth, two and a half at its least, and three miles in average breadth. Its direction, by eompas~, is nearly N. by W. and S. by E. The north end of the bank is in the latitude of Nahant nearly, and the south end in that of a point :five miles south of Scituate light : so that it lies in the direct approach from the southward to 13oston, and being at a convenient depth for sounding while crossing it, is perfectly safe. It will serve as an excellent mark, in foggy or stormy weather, to determine a vessel's position. From ten and a half fathoms at six and a half nautical miles from Cape Race light, the bank deepens, on the average, but very slowly, reaching thirteen fathoms at nine and eleven miles, fourteen fathoms at thirteen and a half and fourteen miles, and fourteen and a half fathoms at twenty miles. It then deepens more rapidly to twenty fathoms, and then quite rapidly from this to thirty and thirty-five fathoms. The outer side of the bank slopes off gradually, and the inner quite abruptly, as a general rule. . Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen remarks, in his report: "I consider the promulgation of this discovery a very essential thing to navigators, and that the knowledge of it will highly benefit commanders of vesselR and the great commercial interest of the city of Boston, aR an invaluable aid to vessels bound in during thick weather, by day or night. By it they can not only ascertain their distance to the cWJfW(trd of the coast, but, by attention to tho lead after passing insicle, a good iclea of the latitude may also be obtained. Thus, three or four miles t!=' westward of the northern half of the shoal, the water deepens generally to fifty fathoms, while at the same distance inside of the southern half, the soundings diminish gradually from forty-five fathoms, in latitude 42░ 15' north, to thirty-five fathoms, all the way across to the main land.'' A sketch will immediately he prepared at the Coast Survey office, so as to show these and other peculiarities of the bank, and it will at once be published. I have carefully examined the claims to discovery of this lmnk by Lieut. Comg. Stellwagen, and sifted the eYidence by charts, and by the information of pilots, fishermen, and others. These I shall submit with my annual report, observing, in the mean time, that I consider it fully substantiated. The development of this bank, and the pointing out of its usefulness would, of themselves, give a credit little short of a discovery; but I shall show that a full discovery has been made. Stellwagen's Bank will rank in importance with Gedney's channel, at the entrance of New York, and Davis' shoal, on the highway to that mart from Europe and the eastern States, and will add another proof that important <liscoveries and developments are to be made by the Coast Survey, even in what may be called the beaten tracks of commerce and navigation. I would respectfully request authority to publish a notice and sketch of this discovery. Very respectfully, yourR, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent Coast Survey.

These rocks were recently diRcovered by vessels striking on them while in tlw charge of able pilots, and numbered 1, 2, 3, from the light-house up. They may be approxi1natcly laid down on the chart as follows: 1. Distant seven hundred yards from Boston light, on the bearing W. 54! 0 S. 2. Distant seventeen hundred and seventy yards from Boston light, on the bearing ''N. 24-!- 0 S., which will be about two hundred and forty yards from the new beacon on the spit, in a south and east direction. 3. Distant two thousand three hundred and forty-three yards from Boston light, on the bearing W. 14-! 0 S., which will be about one hundred and seventeen yards beyond and above the old beacon on the spit, in a south and west direction.

Co.AST SuRVEY STATION, NEAR CAMDEN, MAINE,

.Auguet 28, 1854. Sm: By the kindness of Commander Charles H. Davis, U. S. N., the officer who executed the hydrography of Boston harbor and its approaches, the Coast Survey has been enabled recently to determine the position of a very dangerous sunken ledge in the neighborhood of Minot's ledges, approaches to Boston bay. This sunken ledge is Yery little known, and no notice of it has yet been published. It has only ten feet of water on it at low water, spring tides. The ~osition may be determined by the following magnetic bearings from it: The light-boat bears NW. by W. ! W. Sc~tua~e light ~ars S. by E. Mmot s Rock, (vuter Minot's,) W. by N. ! N. The rule for avoiding this and all similar dangers in this vicinity is, not to pass to tlie soutliward ef the light-boat, where strangers have no excuse for going at any time. I would respectfully request authority to give the usual public notice of the foregoing. Very respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superin!t:ndeid. Hon. JAMES GUTHRIE,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTEND

APPEKDIX No. 12.
Letter f1и01n the Superintendent of the Coa8t Survey to the Secretary of the Treasury, comnwnicating the discm,ery of "New Point Shoal," and description of Yori( Spit, Clzesapeake bay, by Liettt. Comg. J. J. Almy, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey.

July 15, 1854. Sm: In a recent communication Lieut. Comg. J. J. Almy, U.S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, reporbi, in the prosecution. of the hydrography of the Chesapeake off the entrance of l\fobjack bay, the di~covery of a shoal with sixteen feet of water on it, southeast from New Point Comfort light-house, which he proposes to call" New Point Shoal." The fqllowing extracts from his letter give the particulars of his discovery, and also a description of York lfpit, which will be useful to navigators: "'While prosecuting sountlings to the Routhward ancl eastward of New Point Comfort light-house, I discmиered a shoal with eighteen, seventeen, and eixtecn foot of water upon it. This is the only detached shoal, if I may except the 'Inner l\:Iiddle,' with which I have met unywhere below иwindmill Point, or below the widest part of Chesapeake bay. The shoal is three-quarters of a mile long and a third of a mile wide, extending in an eastnortheast and west-southwest direction ; and the sixteen-feet shoal part lies due southeast from New Point Comfort light-house, a distance of four nautical miles from it. There are :five and three-quarters and six fathoms between this shoal and the light-house. The best charts have six fathoms whNe the shoal lies. I propose to call it 'New Point Shoal,' as an appropriate name by which navigators could easily call to mind its locality. "Since I lrnve discovered and mentioned it to people in this vicinity, one of the old residents remembers that some fifteen or twenty years ago a deeply laden ship struck and thumped hard in that locality. "York Spit is, as you know, one of the greatest dangers to navigators in this part of Chesapeake bay. It is a narrow spit, or bar, lying between the entrance into Mobjack bay and the entrance into York river, varying in width from a quarter to half a mile, and extending out from the laud six and a half nautical miles, equal to seven and a half statute miles, where it c.:ommenccs to deepen beyond three fathoms. At a diRtance of Bix nautical miles from the land tlwrc are, as I found, only fourteen foet of water." I would res1iectfully rccpwst autliority to puhlish the foregoing. T cry respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon. JA~rns Gcnrnrn, Secretary of tlte Treasury.

Report of Lieut. Comg. J. N. 1!Iajfitt, ll. 8. N .. a.~sistanf in tlw. Coast Snrvcy, on Bem~fort harbor, North Carolina, communicated, by request, to the honorable Secretary of the }.,Tcivy June 12, 1854.
The entrance to the harbor of Beaufort, North Carolina) is seven miles \VNW. from Cape Lookout light-house, and ea~y of access in all winds excepting those from the west and northwest. The bar has, at present, fifteen and a half feet at mean low water. The anchorage, from abreast of Fort Macon wharf to a point a mile and three-quarters westward,. is safe, and completely protected from all winds. The 1.lirection of the channel has changed materially from time to time. APБording to an old chart, (no authority,) it was SSW., with sixteen feet. In 1820 ......... according to Kearney ........ .it was N. and S ...... with 13 feet. 1830 ................ do ..........

" " The bar of Beaufort is composed of coarse and fine marine sand, mixed with dead shells; and, like all.southern sand-bars, it is subject to the extraneous influences of sea and current. During the last thirty years, this bar has varied slightly in depth, lmt materially in direction. From the best evidence which could be obtained-both positi\иe and traditionary-I have concluded that the normal depth upon the bar at mean low water is sixteen feet .и This deduction is based upon the following evidence : Wimble' s chart, published in 1737,. (one hundred and seventeen years ago,) gives eighteen foet as the depth on the bar at low tide. It is also stated, on good authority, that Lawson's chart, published in 1718, coincides with Wimble's in the depth at low water. In evidence of the continued excellent depth of water on this bar, it may not be out of place to state that, in the year 1760, the colonial legislature granted to a company a charter authorizing the connexion of Beaufort with Neuse river by means of a ship-canal; and as Ocracoke bar (the natural outlet to the Neuse river) had then twelve feet at low water, the inference iB, that the channel had not deviated in depth since the survey of иwimble. It is a well-attested fact that, during the war of the Revolution, an English cruiser, drawing twenty-two feet, entered the "harbor of Beaufort, and was conducted out again by a resident pilot, who stated that "she crossed the bar with an ordinary hicrh tide, but 0 11truck lightly several times." In the years 1811, 1813, and 1815, serious changes, as to depth and direction, occurred upon this bar, which were attributed to the heavy Bouthwest gales of those years-that of 1815 being one of the molit violent and disastrous ever known upon the coast. Shackel-

22*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

ford's Point was much affected by the sea, and the site of old Fort Hampton entirely destroyed. The bar was injured so that but twelve feet could be brought over it at low water. After the year 1815 the channel-way gradually changed its direction more to the southward; the depth of water also steadily increased until 1830, when a depth of eighteen feet at low water was reported by officers of the army. In the year 1838 the ship Napoleon, bound for Liverpool with naval stores, crossed the bar with a draught of seventeen imd a half feet. In 1839 the bar was surveyed by order of the Hon. J. K. Paulding, Secretary of the Navy, and "fifteen feet water at the lowest observed tides," reported by Lieut. Glynn, the officer in charge of the survey. In 1850 the bar was sounded ont under my direction, and seventeen feet found upon it at mean low water. My present survey gives fifteen and a half feet at mean low water. The differences noticed in the depth are attributable to local causes of a transient character, not permanently affecting the general capacity of the bar. Point Macon has been succeoofully protected from the encroachment of the sea by a system of jettees, and Shackelford's Point requires a like expedient, as in every gale from the southward, portions of it arc washed away. The Coast Survey shore-lines of 1851 and 1854 differ materially, showing a large decrease of the point, the effect of which is undoubtedly injurious, not only upon the direction of the channel, but also as affecting the depth of water on the bar. If this salient point, which governs so materially the ebb and flood, was protected from abrasion by the sea, the channel would probably be more fixed in its character. A marked evidence of the value of this harbor is derived from information furnished by the Treasury Department, to the effect, that though in 1810 the gross revenue accruing to government through the oustom-house at Beaufort was but $522, in 1813 it suddenly increased to $105,214, and throughout the war it continued the like large returns to the treasury. The geographical position of Beaufort is favorable, not only for purposes of commerce, but as affording protection during northeast and eastwardly storms. Cape Lookout affords a natural breakwater in gales from those pQints, with excellent and well-protected anchorage under the land, the light-house bearing east. The harbor.-The harbor of Beaufort may be regarded as extending from Macon Point westward to the entrance of Bogue sound abreast of Shepherd's Point. It is bounded on the south by marsh-lands belonging to the Fort Macon property and the Literary Society of the State ; on the north by sand-banks, bare at low water, and marsh-land, also the property of the Literary Society. The average width of the harbor is three hundred yards, exclusive of the mouth of Newport river, which also affords excellent anchorage as far as the flats. The channel here ie two hundred and eighty yards wide. The marsh-land traversed by Fishing creek bordering upon the government property has deep water along its margin, on which wharves could be built at small expense. 'l'here are several good localities adjaoent fo Shepherd's Point for wharves, which would not involve extraordinary outlay. In the event of the contemplated railroad terminating at this port, all the marsh-lands mentioned must become important for the necessities of commerce. My opinion strongly inclineH to their selection for government purposes, as the water isoo1d from Fishing creek westward, and the sand-hills by the seashore offer the most healthy sites for dwellinghouses. This selection is based upon the presumption that government designs to establish at this port only a depot for the collection of naval stores and fuel for the use of the seeondclass steamers, which would always find this a convenient harbor for a re-supply of coal when cruising off the coast. The a.ctual bar is but three hundred and seven yards wide, passing rapidly from three and a quart.er to three and a half fathoms (over fifteen and a half foet at mean low water.) The normal depth of water on the bar I have assumed as sixteen feet at mean low water, which at high water will allow sloops-of-war alld second-class steamers to enter without difficulty, while brigs, schooners, and third-class steamers could come in at any stage of the tide. Harbors with such facilities, on this part of the coast, are too valuable to be neglected by the government. Many of our coasting-schooners use this port constantly as a harbor of refuge, and the establishment of lights and buoys by the general government, to afford

additional facilities for ingress and egress, would be fully warranted by the importance of this coasting trade. On several occasions during the month of March, 1854, I liave seen from seventeen to twenty vessels with valuable cargoes anchored in this port for safoty from the gales. The establishment of a railroad depot at this place, as an outlet for the mineral wealth and a<Yricultural resources of the interior and western parts of the State, would no doubt cause the port to grow rapidly in commercial impo1 tance. The facilities are great for inland navigation-with Pamplico by means of Core sound, and also with the rich county of Onslow by the way of Bogue sound, the navigation of which could be improved without very great expenditure of means. Naval stores in abundance could be shi1)ped here; coal and copper obtained by railroad from Chatham county, live oak from Onslow, and white oak and other timber from the adjacent country. It is certain that encouragement and increased facilities would very soon make this an important southern port. The salubrity of the place is such as to render it a rendezvous during the summer months. I incline strongly to the opinion that jettees would save Point Shackelford, and if extended, (as the land formed) would have a tendency to improve the depth of water on the bar. This point, well secured or prolonged, would change the current, and no doubt the liar-channel, more to the southward or at right-angles to the coast. The result would be to force the bar promptly seaward into deep water, instead of following the coast-in shoal. Where artificial means are to be resorted to, with reference to sand-bar improvements, I am impressed with the conviction that if the current can be governed, means should he applied to force the bar seaward into deep water at right-angles to the co(r,st. Charleston main ship-channel loses all benefit of the ebb current by its general diffusion before it reaches the desired point. If all the ebb could be forced out east, that bar would have twice its present capacity. This opinion is, of course, based upon the theory that the more contracted the outlet for a body of water, the greater will be the velocity of the current or scouring influence by which the bar is deepened, or at least kept at its uniform depth. The channels connecting Beaufort and Lenoxville with the main harbor are intricate; that leading into the former has but six feet at mean low water. The channel around Shackelford's Point, 1eading up to the latter, has eleven feet at mean low water. It is narrow, and subject to constant changes. Passing Shepherd's Point the channel has four fathoms. Eleven feet, at mean low water, can be ca.rried up to Gallant Point; ten feet, at mean low water, abreast of Carolina City. The channel by Bird island, though more permanent, is tortuous, and affords but nine feet at low water. Respectfully yours, J. N. MAFFITT, U.S. N., .As.~-i8tant in the U. S. Coast Survey. Prof. A. D.

Lette:r from the Superintendent of the Coast Survr,y to tlie Commissioner of t!te General Land Offece, communicating tlie resulta of the survey of Florida keys, in the vicinity of Key West and Spanish harbor.
CoAST SURVEY OFFICE, July 13, 1854. Sm: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of July 6, requesting to know the progress made in the survey of the Florida keys. 1. On the passage of the appropriation in March, 1853, I made immediate arrangements, anticipating the beginning of the fiscal year, and sent a party to the keys east of Key West for triangulation and topography. The result was a survey of Boca Chica key and its connection with Key West and the adjacent keys. The map of this survey s11owing the character of the key, the amount of woods, ponds, &c., &c., was transmitted to you on the 15th of December, 1853, with extracts from the reports of the assistants making the survey. An extract frolll the report of Sub-Assistant R. .M:. Bache is appended to this letter, marked [M.] 2. I then proposed a method of numbering the sections of the keys, so that they might be sold as the survey advanced, if you deemed it proper. This, on conference with you, was deemed satisfactory, and I have acted upon it in the subsequent surveys. The system of marlfing- and numbering enables you, by differences of latitude and longitude, obtained geodetically, to connect all the keys together, and with the main, when the work is so far advanced. It is very simple and explicit, and, with the modifications suggested by your office, seems to me to meet all the wants of the government and of the buyer of the land. The marks are easily replaced, if by accident obliterated, and the divisions are easily understood. I append a note of this system, [N.J 3. During the past year the triangulation has extended beyond the topography, which includes the f~llowing named keys. The map of these is in preparation, and will be sent to your office m a few weeks. They arc-East Harbor Keys, West Harbor Keys, Cayo ~gua, Desolation, Hawk, Middle, Eagle Nest, Snake, Rockland, East Rockland, Big Copp1tt, Half-Moon, Shark, Attava, Gieger's Key, South Saddle Hill, Round, Wall, Bird, and Pelican Keys. The particulars in regard to these kevs will be found explicitly stated in the report of J. Hull Adams, esq., hereto annexed and.marked [O.J 4. We have, besides these surveys, topographical maps of the keys from Cape Flori~a to near Carysfort reef, at the disposal of your office, and of surveys in the vicinitv of Bahia Ronda. A desc!_ip~ion of the keys surveyed during the past year will be fou~d in the report of S. A. Wamwright, e8q.; a copy of which is herewith enclosed, [P.]

5. All the necessary arrangements are made for prosecuting this work vigorously during the next season, the triangulation being in advance of the topography. 6. As far as depends upon marking and maps, the Boca Chica key affords the means of securing the necessary general legislation for the sale of the keys. Yours, respectfully,

[M.J

In making the survey of Boca Chica, and laying it out in quartor-sP-ctions, I a<lopted the following plan: A number of posts, painted black and marked U.S.C.S., were used for the marking of the points along the shore. -These posts were of the following dimensions, which were found to be sufficient, except in two cases, where the water of Pelot's creek was so deep that ordinary flag-poles were used. Length of post, two and three-quarters feet; thickness of post, three inches. In addition to the painting of U.S.O.S. on the posts, they were numbered, and also marked with the letters P. or M., to signify imra1lel or meridian. Of course, these let~rs P. and 1\1. were marked on the spot, as it was impossible to know whether a parallel or meridian post would be necessary, unless the shore was very regular. The advantage of numbering and lettering the posts P. and M. is very great; for if the person who runs out the lines :finds a post on one side of an island numbere<l, he will see, by reference to the map, where the line comes out on the other side, by the number there; whereas he could not do this without the numbering, unless by finding some of the posts, and comparing their positions with the topography. The lettering gives him the direction to run, even without the map. I understand that the surveys of land in Florida are made using the magnetic north. This was not done on Boca Chica, as I had not the variation. On commencing the survey of Boca Chica, I saw that there would be great inaccuracy in the work if the quarter-miles were laid off with the dividers one from the other as the work proceeded, so that the work was commenced by making a projection of squares of a quarter of a mile in area on the map; and, in making the survey, all that was necessary was to sight from the position of the table to the spot where the post was to be placed, and to chain the line. The only change to be made in the surveys of the other keys would be to make the projection of squares by the magnetic north. Of course, the posts and poles used for marking points must diffei on other keys, as the bottom is sometimes very soft, and would require long poles in those places where it would be necessary to place the mark in the water. и

JCNE 29, 1854. Srn: In pursuance of your instructions, I repaired to Key ░"rest; and, having hired a suitable vessel, I anchored her inside of the Harbor keys, about ten miles northward and westward of Key \Yest. This is considered a good refoge for vessels drawing not more than six feet. I commenced the topographical work at \Цest Harbor key, which is about half a mile in length. Being elevated, its soil is the best in this vicinity, sustaining a growth of buttonwood and sea-grape, with but little mangrove. The gro~p smith and east of this comprises Kayo Agua, Dellolation keys, Middle key, and Hawk key. These arc much broken up by channels in every direction. Kayo Aguaa half-mile long and a quarter in breadth-is the largest; but at ordinary high water, most of the group are overflowed. They are all covered with mangrove, surrounded by mud-fiats, making the approach very inconvenient, and together comprise an area of about four square miles. A mile eastward of these lies a group called East Harbor keys, which may be regarded as one, intersected by numerous deep passages throughout its length of two and a half miles. In breadth it varies from a quarter to half a mile, and bears a dense growth of mangrove. Eagle's Nest, to the southward, ii'! about half a mile in length, and has some firm ground. The next in order is called Snake key, a mile in length, of coral formation, and overgrown with brush and mangrove. Westward of this lie three very small and unimportant keys. A group to the southward comprises Rockland key, a mile in length, of hard coral, covered with rough grass and low bushes, and at its southern extremity thick mangrove; East Rockland and Big Coppitt, or Coppice, of the same size, but very much cut up with channels, and generally covered with water at spring tides. The northern half of the last named, however, has a good soil sustaining a growth of iron-wood, buttonwood, and sea-grape, and is similar in character, but of better quality than the southern part of East Rockland. There is a house and small plantation on Big Coppitt. On the north side of these lie Half-Moon keys, Shark key, and O'Hara key; and, further distant, Wall key; all narrow, unimportant strips, generally less than a mile in length, and covered with grass or mangrove. Geiger's key, east of Boca Chica, is separated from it by Pelot's creek. This key is two miles long, and has some good land, bearing a growth of iron-wood and button-wood throughout. Just south of its eastern extremity is South Saddle Hill, which is important as being the first land seen by vessels approaching this part of the coast. The southwest half abounds with very tall mangroves, which give it the appearance of a ltill, but the~e are bordered by button-wood and sea-grape; the other half bears a lower growth, and is

28*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

not important. This key is three-fourtns of a mile in length, and two smaller keys to the north of it bear the same name. Two strips adjoining those just noticed are called Bird key and Pelican key, both unimportant except fur their fuel, of which a scarcity already begins to be folt at Key \Vest. rrhe keys are all imrroundcd by extensive :flats of deep mud. The difficulty of determining the land-marks at the intersection of the meridional and parallel lines with the shore was sometimes very great, and consumed much time; but I was enabled to get them all, as well as the intersections of the quarter-section lines, and ha\иc planted numbered stakes at each. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, HULL ADAMS. Prof. A. D. BACHE,

[P.J
Bahia Honda, or Spanish harbor, to the south of it, is surrounded by keys more stable in character than those near Old Rhodes harbor. Spanish key, on which my base was measured, is a large dry marsh bordered by cocoanut, palmetto, and small oak woods. An arm of the sea makes into it, and, by an unusual swell from the ocean, parts of it may possibly be overfloweu, but J.uring the time occupieu in the OJJeration referred to above it was quite dry. Pine key is very similar to that just described, with large pines, however, on the waterside, and more abundant undergrowth. All the keys in Spanish harbor are of coral formation, covered by two feet or more of soil. No depth of water occurs within from :fifty to one hundred yards from the shore, which is in all cases fringed with bushes; beyond this distance the bottom is composed of sharp coral rocks. It is difficult to determine whether these keys are increasing or diminishing in size ; but from my own observation, made during a short stay, I incline to the latter view, from finding at the water-edge large trees, which certainly must have grown in a more fertile position. From Bahia Honda the distance to Old Rhodes harbor is about a hundred and twentv miles. Most of ,the small keys in this last named vicinity are covered with a thick growth of mangrove, and have generally very abrupt banks, with either deep water over soft, muddy bottom in the passages between them, or scarcely any at all. They appear to be low and swampy in the interior, evidently corresponding in contour with the well known peculiarity of the coral formation beneath. Ol<l Rhodes key is more stable in character and more considerable in size than either of those just alluded to. Key Largo North appears to be a dry marsh, bordered with pines. This is, perha11s, the largest of the whole range. A little to the eastward of its northern extremity is Angle-fish key, three-fourths of a mile long, with a margin of s~ll trees; and directly north of that Palo Alto key, about a mile in length, and covered with almost impenetrable bushes. Neither of these will average more than a fourth of a mile in breadth, and, like all the small keys, both in this vicinity and at Spanish harbor, are of little value.

The last mentioned has an outlet to the Gult~ between the wcRtern end of the island (on which there is a light-house) and the low marsh of Cheniere au Tigre. This is called the Southwest Pass. The navigation of these bays, but chiefly of the Atchafalaya, is 1ery important, and is daily increasing, as nearly all the produce of Bayou Teshe and Atchafalaya river passes through it. Vessels of the larger class use an outside anchorage near the light-boat, at the entrance, where they find ten and eleven feet water, and discharge and take in cargo by lighters. The channel inside and above the barrel-stake has fully eight foet, but is very crooked and intersected by numerous oyster-reefs or bars, for the most part parallel to each other. A very able report, made by Captain Field, who surveyed the bay and river for the New Orleans and Optilousas Railroad Company, states that these bars might be cut through at comparatively small expense, thus increasing the depth to ten feet, and shortening tho passage from the entrance to the mouth of the river fully one-half. '\Vest of Vcrmilion bay the low, marshy coast of Louisiana stretches with but little variety of natural feature throughout a distance of about a hundred miles to the Sabine, the boundary of Texas. About six miles westward of the Southwest Pass occurs the thickly-wooded hammock of Cheniere au Tigre, of from three to five miles in extent, and on which there iH some 1mlid soil, and perhaps ten miles northwest of it another called Pecan island. This is quite narrow, lmt extends parallel with the coast-line in a direction nearly east and west about fifteen miles, and pr(\jects several branches into the marsh from its northern side. It is said to be entirely covered with a growth of superior live-oak, but is so extremely difficult of accesA that .very little is certainly known concerning it. The facts stated in connexion with the supposed value of this hammock, seem to be worth investigation. It lies about ten miles north of the mouths of Freshwater and Big and Little Constance creeks. The next feature iuesented by the shore of the Gulf, is the very shallow mouth of Bayou Mermenton. The bayou extending in a northeasterly direction is soon lost in the impenetrable swamp, but reappears some forty miles higher up in the country. Twenty miles west of this, and perhaps forty east of the Sa1Jine, Lake Octlcasieu, twelve miles long and about five wide, finds its outlet to the Gulf between wooded hammocks and through some tillable land; and a few miles further on, Mud lake, smaller than the one before mentioned, and lying much nearer to the margin of the coast. The Sabine river and lake are inserted in the sketch of reconnaissance from the astronomical determinations and surveys of Major Graham, United States topogrnphical engineers, and some of the details of the interior east of Lake Calcasieu were determined from the State surV(\YS of Louisiana. The marshes between it and Vermilion bay are reported to be impenetrable. While temporary repairs of the schooner Genles were in progress, I made a special reconnaissance of Fourchon Pass, the principal outlet of Bayou Lafourche. The bulk of the staple produce of that vicinity has lieen heretofore taken through the bayou to Donaldsonville, on the Mississippi river, and thence down to New Orleans; but, besides other advantages, the distance to the same point will be lessened by using the pass as an outlet to the Gulf navigation. The water on the bar has doubled in depth uиithin two years, and is believed to be still increasing. .According to my soundings, eight feet can be brought in a straight line to the .Gulf without any difficulty. A light-house, or some other distinguishing mark, on the sand-hill which bounds the east side of the pass, would increase the facilities for navigation. Within the last ten years the resources of the lower parts of Louisiana have been rapidly developing, trade has increased accordingly, and the coast-line in consequence has been better known. Clearings which a few years since stopped within sixty miles of the Gulf~ can now be traced to the very edge of the marshes in the vicinity of the Atchafalaya, . Teshe, anii uther streams. The New Orleans and Texas railroad passes through the most fertile land, and will proha1ily in a short time double the commerce and enterprise of this part of the State. As an additional link to the great chain from the north, this road presents another feature of special importance in the contemplated connection between :Kew Orleans and Galveston, by the finished road as far as Berwyck on the Atchafalaya, and thence by a line of steamers. The project now reforrcd to, besides avoiding the only u.angerous part of the passage by the Gulf, would lessen the distance between the two pomts

about a hundred and thirty miles. Its practicability, however, must depend in part upon the result of a hydrograpbic survey of Atchafalaya hay and river, but there is reason for believing that the issue will be found favorable to the interests and convenience of the travelling community.

APPENDIX No. 21.

Extracts from report of .Assistant W. E. Greenwell on the general features and peculiarities of the coast of lower Texas, with suggestions in regard to facilities for navigation.
The country between Brazos St. Iago and the Rio Grande is mostly a level prairie of alluvial soil-a vast grazing plain, upon which thousands of cattle find subsistence the whole year round. Rising abruptly on this plain are islands, or "montes," as they are called, varying from fifteen to forty feet in height-curious features in themselves, since they all differ, both in soil and vegetation, from the level below. Upon these grows, in all its perfection, the mezquite, intermixed with a species of ebony and lignumvitmJ perhaps the best fuel in the world. The Rio Grande iR a narrow, tortuous Htream, with an average width of not over four hundred feet. It is navigable for steamboats of light draught as far up as Roma, three hundred and thirty miles from its mouth, but impracticable for any other kind of vessels. The bar is a shifting quicksand, with an average depth of from four to six feet, and is impracticable for sailing-ves~els unless in tow of a steamer. Artificial constructiom, similar in character to the railroad now in progress of construction between Brownsville and Point Isabel, will be required to develop the vast agricultural resources of the valley of the Rio Grande. The harbor of the Brazos St. Iago is the only one on the coast of Texas south of Aransas Pass. Through it the products of the Rio Grande find egress, and merchandise of all classes, machinery, agricultural implements, &c., &c., find way to lower Texas and Mexico. The exports froin this region of our country, passing over the bar, consist of hides, wool, and specie. The total number of arrivals and departures within the last five years are stated as follows: 406 143 77,033 $125,000 25,000 1,904,951 Like that at the mouth of the Rio Grande, the Brazos bar is shifting; and, as a general thing, more water can be carried over it in winter than during the summer months. I crossed in November with nine feet, but found only seven on coming out in May. This variation in depth appears to be due to the prevalence of northers in winter. These bank up, as it were, the water in Laguna del Madre, which, rushing out with increased velocity over the bar, carries seaward the loose quicksand of which it is composed. The highest tides in the harbor are coincident with northers; and while at maximum inside, filling the lagoons and overflowing the lowlands adjacent, the shores of the Gulf outside are often bare. During the summer the wind is almost exclusively from the southeast, and the rise and fall of the tide more regular. My impression is, that from ten to twelve foet of water might be kept on the Brazos bar (which is merely a ridge of loose sand) by a system of dredging, similar to that going on at the mouth of the :Mississippi. и From Paso Caballo to the Brazos St. Iago-a distance of one hundred and fifty milesthere is no distinguishing feature whatever along the coast. Vessels bound down, during the winter months, try to make the land of Padre island from ten to twelve miles north of the Brazos; to which the light at Point Isabel is the only leading mark.

dayl!!, and blow with a violence rarely known in higher latitudes, navigators must relv entirely upon the sextant to know their whereabouts. The land offers no facilities of recognition, and the character of the bottom is yet so little known as to be no guide whatever. In the absence of a light-house, large wooden structures, at regular intervals along the coast of Padre ifiland, would give essential aid to vessels. A case within my own knowledge-showing the peculiarity of northers in reference to this part of the coast-occurred during the past winter, in which a vessel was off the bar twenty-nine days before she was able to get in. Upon examining charts of this part of the Gulf coast, and comparing them in respect to outline with reliable local information, it appears that, about twelve miles south of the Rio Grande, the shore takes a southwesterly direction for almost twenty-five miles, or as far down as the San Fernando. This is an important fact, which is not furnished lJy any published chart which I have yet examined. The curve in the shore gives a lee, sul)ject, of course, to the heavy rollers from the Gulf, but safo from the break of the swell. A few to whom this fact is known have, in great stress of weather, found shelter here; and in one instance a small schooner, though in a crippled condition, after riding out a violent norther, actually landed her passengers during its height. My duties did not admit of my visiting this part of the coast in person, 1mt doubtless an examination of the facts communicated might prove not only of benefit to the coasting trade of lower Texas, but of great consequence to commerce at large.

Extradsfrom the report of Sub-Assi.stant W. M. Johnson in r~ferenee to the feature.s of the country between P~faro and Salina.s rivers, California. Sept&mber 30, 1854. Sm: * * * * The country between the Pagaro and Balinas rivers is in all respects similar in its formation to that from Point Ano Nuevo to the Pagaro, which was surveyed and reported upon by Mr. Harrison. Extending from the mouth of the Pataro to the Salinas river is a range of low sandhills, between which and the older forfuation lie several ponds, which mark the former bed of the Pdaro. It evidently at one time found its way to the ocean through this channel; but, 'by an accumulation of its water through the winter months, it burst the narrow strip of beach which separated it from the sea, an?. thus formed for itself a new and more direct outlet. This new mouth, if we may so call it, is frequently closed by the sand thrown up during the prevalence of southeast gales. This part of the country is peculiarly adapted to grazing, since fr~sh water is plenty; and the fogs that prevail during the summer months afford sufficient moisture to nourish and keep alive the grasses during the dry season. The valley of the Salinas is watered through its whole extent by the river of the snme name; and near the coast several sloughs take their rise and empty into the river near itR mouth. Neither the river nor the sloughs are navigable but for a short distanee, and only for ves5els of light draught. In summer the Salinas is an insignificant stream, fordable, but for the quicksands, at any point three miles from its mouth. In winter it is a rushing torrent, that destroys large tracts of fertile country by overflowing its banks, and depositing on the low lands sand and gravel frequently to the depth of two and a half feet. On the Salinas there are evidences of frequent changel!! in the beds of streams. These were carefully surveyed and represented as they now appear. In some of the old beds we still find marsh, while others can be traced only by slight depressions in the plain. . The river frequently, during wint.er, forms for itself a new outlet.

South of the Salinas the character of the country undergoes a striking change; the soil is a loose, dry sand, that produces sparingly but the coarsest grasses; and, in the distance of twelve miles, water fit for use can be found in only one locality, by digging on the margin of one of the salt-water ponds.

Old Point Comfort, Virginia, October 5, 1854. Srn: In conversations with you relative to the survey of the Chesapeake and its tributaries, I recollect to have spoken more than once of the extensive and still increasing commerce of Chesapeake bay. While at anchor lately in the vicinity of the capes, taking current observations, I found opportunity to count the number of vessels which passed the capes, outward-bound, in the course of several days. September 18.-Seventy-five sail of different classes passed the capes and went to sea, about one-third of them being square-rigged vessels. This is about the average. September 19.-Five ships, four barks, fifteen brigs, and twenty-eight schooners, making a total of fifty-two sail, went to sea. September 24.-Eighty-six sail passed the capes outward-bound, about one-third of them being sqare-rigged vessels. Commerce having an important bearing upon the Coast Survey and its usefulness, it occurred to me that you would regard statistics of this nature with the degree of interest which warrants this communication.

and information derived from pilots and others, I am enabled to give the following information, which I ho1ie may be of present service. The entrance to the bay of Espiritu Santo is over a hard sand-bar, two and a half miles from the light-house, having on it about twenty feet at ordinary low tides. The course in is E. by S. by compass, with the light-house on that bearing until over the bar, when from four to sixteen fathoms can be had, the last-named off the north end of Egmont key within a hundrecl and :fifty yards of the shore; continuing up the channel, :five, four, three, and two and a half fathoms, will be found within about three miles of Gadsden Point. Beyond this the channel becomes tortuous, but ten feet water may be found within a mile of Ballast Point. "\Vest of the anchorage off Gadsden Point is good anchorage for several miles, in from four to :five fathoms water, and four may be found at two miles from the land, but fifteen и feet must be crossed in order to reach this anchorage. Ten feet water may be carried to old Tampa, close to the shore. At Piner Point, the south end of a peninsula forming the western boundary of old Tampa bay, fifteen feet water is found within two miles of the shore, and within four miles an excellent anchorage for a fleet of large ships. This is nearer the entrance of Espiritu Santo bay than either of the points previously mentioned. The mouth of the Little Manitee, on the opposite side of the bay, can be approached within two miles with three anu a half fathoms, but the coast is low and marshy and intersected hy numerous lagoons. My own observations were made casually, and nothing is here stated as the result of a formal reconnaissance. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 0. H. BERRYMAN, Lieut. U. S.

Srn: I have the honor to communicate the following information concerning the commercial facilities of Cedar keys, as developed byи the recent survey made by the party under my charge. The depth which can be carried in from sea by the several channels at low water is about ten feet, but at high water nearly twelve may be found with ordinary tides, and the approaches are easy both for ingress and egress. The extent of anchorage in the harbor on the Depot key side is a little less than a mile long by about two hundred yards broad; and though No. 4 channel has a greater extent of anchorage, with a little deeper water, its seaward approach to the bar is such as to render t~1e other in that respect preferable. Opposite Depot, and near May key, still more extensive anchorage may be reached with ten foet by passing around a narrow sand-bank, which separates it from Depot anchorage. About fifteen feet may be had in these last described anchorages, and all of them are secure. The best, in my opinion, is the anchorage southeast of Sea-Horse key, vessels having there more room to run ooble than in either of the others. The general depth of water in the harbors is about fourteen feet, but it is proper to remark that heavy gales from northeast or east reduce all the depths mentioned several feet. The chara~tcr of the bottom for holding cannot be called good, yet it is sufficiently so f?r vessels :with prop.er anc~<_>rs and cables in all winds or gales, excepting the violent. hurricanes which sometimes vunt these keys. These are the occasion also of extraordmary tides, which, I am informed, overflow nearly all the low islands. 5и

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

All ports in this angle of the Gulf suffer from a rise of water in heavy southwest gales. The height of the land on May key, as estimated by the eye, is perhaps about twenty-five feet. Piers of wood may be carried to the deepest water conveniently. So far as my experience has extenr1e<l, the localities of Cedar keys are not liable to fogs. The best approach to them for vessels of light draught is from the west, on the parallel of 28░ 56' north latitude. Passing the end of the reef in four or five fathoms water, the lightи house and Sea-Horse key may be seen bearing N. 33░ E., true. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Letter from Assistant F. H. Gerdes, in relation to the commercial faci7ities and resources of Cedar Keys, west coast of Florida.
OCTOBER 7, 1854. Srn : In answer to your letter regarding the commercial facilities of Cedar keys, Florida, I am able to communicate the following information : The depth carried from sea into the Sea Horse, or main channel, is fully ten feet at low, and twelve at high water, ordinary tides, and the keys are easy of ingress or egre8s. The ancl10rage at Atcena Otee (Depot key) is about a mile long, and from two hundred to thn'e hundred yards wide, and is separated from a larger one at May key by a narrow sand-bar, which, however, may be passed around with ten feet of water. In 1oth anchorages the depth is fifteen or sixteen feet at low tide, and the holding-ground is good, though not comparable with soft bottom; it is equal to any in the vicinity. The anchorage at channel No. 4, is more extensive than either of the others; but its entrance may not be so good as that of the main channel. All the anchorages are perfectly secure and landlocked. Vessels provided with good anchors and chains may here ride out any gale, from whatever quarter it may blow; but violent hurricanes occur here as at other points on the Gulf. vVooden piers can he conveniently carried out to the deepest parts of the channels. The highest land on l\fay key is, I think, thirty-three feet above high-water mark. During several successive seasons that I have been employed in the neighborhood of Cedar keys, fogs have occurred but rarely, and then were only of short duration. Heavy gales, as a matter of course, influence the rise and fall of the tide; but, owing to the location, probably not to such an extent here as at other places in the vicinity, which are more locked up from the north. The highest tide within the last fifteen years rose, I belieYe, eleven feet at Depot key, and overflowed only the lower part of that island. 'rhe harbor of Cedar keys compares to advantage with others in the immediate vicinity, and its position in respect to the Suwanee, Crystal, and adjacent rivers, is highly favorl'lble to the development of their important local resources. The valleys of these rivers are covcr~d with extensive forests of pine and cedar ; and owing to the ample facilities for reachmg the Gulf, lumber has already become an article of export from Depot key, as well и as cotton, sugar, and tobiwco. Fish, oysters, green turtle, and many kinds of game abound here, and the climate is as healthy and pleasant as any in the United States. A weekly mail across the peninsula keeps the Cedar keys in communication with the .Atlantic coast. Respectfully, your most obedient servant, DEAR

Extracts from tlie reports of Assistant G . .A. Fairfield and Sub-Assistant Henry Mitchell on the tidal observations made on the south shore of Afassachusetts, and in Nantucket and Vineyard sounds. WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, Novemher 4, 1854. DEAR Srn: I submit the following report of my work in Vineyard sound during the past season : On receiving your instructions, I proceeded to Nantucket and consulted with Mr. Mitchell, who had been for some time engaged in observing in that vicinity.

A self-registering gauge, forwarded from the office, was put up on the wharf at Wood's
Hole; but, in consequence of a derangement which could not be perceived at the outset, the record could not be regarded as reliable. Gauges were kept in operation siII).ultaneously for six weeks at Nobska, Point Gammon, and Monomoy. I have found, by the resulting observations, that the tide which flows in by Monomoy from the ocean, meets with very little interruption until after it passes Point Gammon. A remarkable difference, however, was found between Nobska and Point GamIDOn; and, in order to mark its precise locality, a gauge was erected at Davis's Neck, about five miles from Nobska; but a week's observations showed very little difforcnee between that point and Point Gammon. The conclusion seems to be warranted, that the whole difference is distributed between Davis' Neck and Nob.ska.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

'l'he tides in the vicinity are very much affected by the wind. At one period, a rise and fall of not more than an inch or two occurred successively for several days. On the 21st of October my observations were closed, the records being placed, by your direction, in the care of Mr . .Mitchell. Yours, very respectfully, G. A. FAIRFIELD, Ass'istant U. S. Coast Survey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey.

Report of Sub-Assistant Henry .Mitchell.
The following is an abstract of various reports made from time to time relative to the progress of the tidal party under my charge and your immediate direction, from the early part of July until the mid(lle of October of the present year: In the instructions received, a system of obser"Vations was laid down, with a view to determine the iirogress of the tide-wave from the open sea, and through the Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, and various openings into them. In order to effect this, simultaneous observations were necessary at different localities along the outer and inner coast, in connection with the careful examination of tides passing through the avenues leading to the sounds. The portions of this field of operation intrusted to my direction were the south sides of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard islands, the southern shores of Nantucket and Vineyard sounds from Great Point to Gay Head. and the east and west sides of Muskegat channel. Permanent tidal stations were first established at Nantucket harbor, West Chop, and Woc,d's Hole, and to these were to be refened the results obtained at various local stations, as directed in your instructions. At the outset many difficulties were encountered. in attempts to construct tide-gauges capable of withstanding the force of the currents and breakers at the outside stations ; but after repeated failures of the most discouraging kind, I am pleased to say our experiments terminated in complete success. By the method which I shall presently mention in detail, we have since been enabled to carry on the outside series with comparative ease. The failure8 just referred to are perhaps not without interest in the present connection, as exhibiting the effect of strong currents and heavy seas. Our first attempt was made at Siasconsett, with an iron tube armed at the lower end with an augur, which was screwed firmly inlo the sand just without the breakers and in two fathoms water; but this, though opposing a very small surface, was immediately deflected from its upright position by the strong ebb r.urrent. After readjusting the pipe perpendicular to the surface, it was carefully wound with one thousand pounds weight of cham-cable arranged in the form of a pyramid; bnt this expedient failed to secure the permanence of the gauge, as the current, by undermining, very soon overturned the structure. The next trial was the substitution for the last-mentioned structure, of a tripod of iron bars attached to three heavy anchors, and this also failed in resisting the force of the sea. By great exertion the apparatus was then taken up ancl a fourth anchor procured, through t1rn ring of which the pipe was passed, and while the anchor was suspended between two surf-boats, the pipe was again screwed into the sand in its first position. The anchor was then lowered carefully to the bottom, with its flukes in the direction of the strongest current, and the tripod was finally fastened to the gauge. A 1mcession of violent gales, since experienced, has left this structure entirely unharmed. The outside series thus commenced has been carried on at four stations, viz : Siasconsett, \Veweeder, Smith's Point, and Wasque. A tripod of oak piles, shod with iron, was successfully used to support the gauge at the last-named station, which is not subjected to strong currents, and somewhat protected from the force ofиthe sea by a bar. Much difficulty was experienced in preventing the registry of loner swells, which would cause the float to rise and fall. A very small stream of water only was allowed to enter the gauge-tube, and that at a distance below tl1e surface. It was however, sometimes impossible to determine the exact flow of w:iter necessary for a reliable observation, as in the

open sea, species of primary waves occur not unlike the great tide-wave; and these tra'\ersing the ocean slowly, may easily be confounded with it. The tidal station at Smith's Point is some distance from the inhabited part of the island of Nantucket, and very much expoRed to the sea. This was occupied hy Mr. Gustan1s Wiirdemann; and 11erhaps none but a thoroughly experienced observer, inured to the consequent privations, could have maintained, as he has, the perseverance and courage requisite for its proper management. The stations Wasque and Smith's Point were used in the investigation of the tides of Muskegat channel, simultaneous observations being made at Tuckernuck on the east and Cape Poge and Choppaquiddick on the west shore. The tides on the western shore of Muskegat channel arc so inconsiderable and irregular, that little hope was entertained at the outset of obtaining relialJle rmmlts; hut through the indefatigal)le efforts of Mr. Nes, the observer, a correct view will be furnished of at least a few of the phenomena of the tides of that localitv. Mr. Femlall'R long and excellent series at Tnckernuck, with that of Brant Point, and a few weeks' work at Great Point, completed the system proposed for the south side of Nantucket sound. In the Vineyard sound, commencing at Gay Head, the tides were studied at l\fonamsha, Cedar Tree, Chappaquonsett, outside V'{ est Chop, and \Vest Chop light-house. At the last two stations remarkable tidal phenomena were })fesented, which seemed to require the attention of the most intelligent and experienced observers. Mr. \Vurdemann and Mr. Ji'endall were therefore called upon, and the results of their observations will attest the faithful discharge of the duties thus assigned. The results obtained throughout, it is hoped may throw some light upon the problems proposed for solution; but it is quite certain that they suggest a number of important and interesting questions yet to be answered. Very respectfully, yours, HENRY MITCHELL, Sub-Assistant in Coast Smиvey. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent.

SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, Septrmber 6, 1854. Sm: I have the honor to report to you, according to your instructions, the progress

DEAR

of the tidal and other observations under my charge on this coast up to the present time. Your original instructions, received at Washington in March, 1853, were so full and comprehensive, that I have but little to report, except the progress I have made in executing them. They required, mainly, complete sets of observations at certain points for the determination of the progress of the tide-wave, and special observations for the phenomena of harbor-tides; and also, as far as practicable, investigations and comparisons of results of observation with theory. I have found that the administration of the affairs of an extended system of observations, together with almost constant field-work, has prevented my making, heretofore, any com11lete or systematic computations; and the expense of hiring computers is so great, that I am obliged to forego the pleasure of regularly working up my results. They are tr:1Ilsmitt~d to you regularly, however, and will, I trust, enable you to determine those quest10ns which you are so anxious to solve. It has been a source of much regret that I could not have devoted more time to preparations for my new duties before leavincr Washington; for, as I anticipated, experience here is costly, both in time and money. It░seems a very simple task to make correct tidal observations; but, in all my experience, I have found no observations which require such contant carf.i anJ attention.

38*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The self-registering tide-gauge is, I think, the only proper means of determining the rise and fall of the water, and even this machine requires more care and attention than has usually been bestowed upon it. To make equally good observations with the ordinary staff-gauge, require; at least three observers, and, of course, the expense must be much greater. As tidal observations must be intrusted to the care of observers who cannot be supposed to appreciate fully their importance, I Lave been quite anxious to secure the services of such as would recorcl faithfully their observations; and it is with pleasure that I can report that, with one exception, they have discharged their duties to my entire satisfaction. I may mention particularly Mr. T. A. Szabo, Corporal James Wayne, Andrew Cassidy, and James A. Black. Mr. Szabo, in addition to his duties as an observer, has assisted me in my own operations. Corporal Wayne has had sole charge of the self-registering tide-gauge at Astoria, and communicatcH with me fully every month. I would respectfully recommend him to your notice, also, as an accurate computer. He has investigated, to a certain extent, the observations at Astoria, and his results are worthy of much credit. Andrew Cassidy has had charge of the observations at San Diego since September 22, 18;53, and deserves much credit for his zeal and attention in the discharge of his duties. J. A. Black has assisted me in setting up most of the gauges, besides taking part in the observations. Nine prominent sfations have been occupied as tidal stations on the coast, and four magnetic stations. (See Sketch J-K, stations marked 'l'.) The accompanying table will show the names of the tidal stations, and the interval during which the observations were continued. The observations have been kept up for at leas~ two months at each station, and in some instances for three or four lunations. The gauges at San Diego, San Francisco, and the Columbia river are permanent, and have been in operation since July 1, 1853. From January 13th to March 20, 1854, observations were made simultaneously at five stations, viz: at the three permanent stations, and those of San Pedro and San Luis Obispo. From April 13th to June 15th they were simultaneous at four, and from July 21st to the present time at 1ive1 the intermediate stations lJeing changed every two months. The observations have been conducted with much care, and will, I trust, afford all the necessary data for determining the progress of the tide-wave. . My report of January gave an account of my operations up to that period. I was then stationed with my party at the port of San J,uis Obispo. The observations at this station were :finished about the 20th of March, and the gauge transferred to the Bay of Monterey about the 1st of April. Of the tidal observations at San Luis Obispo I have only to say, that they fully came up to my expectations. They were made by three observers, under my immediate direction. The station was well situated for getting the full force of the sea-tide, uninfluenced by local causes. The ?bservations in the Bay of Monterey were commenced on the 13th of April, and finished on the 15th of June. The gauge, a self-registering one, was !laced upon a firm Rtrncture, built at the end of the custom-house wharf. The curve o rise and fall was unbroken, except at the end of the sheets. The time was determined by astronomical observation. The usual magnetic ol,servations for declination, intensity, and dip were made at Monterey, and also observations for time with the transit, with a view to observe the solar eclipse of May 26th, but cloudy weather unfortunately prevented any observations on that important phenomenon. After finishing the observations at Monterey, I transported my party to San Francisco, and made immediate preparations for establishing observations on the northern coast. On consulting with Assistant George Davidson, I learned that it would be impossible to get nearer to Cape Mendocino than Humboldt bay, and accordingly sent J. A. Black to that point, with two assistants, with full and detailed instructions to make a series of staff ohservations at the entrance of the harbor. I have the pleasure to transmit to you the results of his first month's observations-from July 21st to August 21st. The curve of rise and fall constructed from these observations is quite equal to those of the self-registering gauges in point of accuracy. The observations are made with a floating staff1

divided into feet and tenths, and read by a fixed index, the higher numbers corresponding to high tides. The time is kept by a chronometer, regulated and set in San Francisco to Humboldt time. I have every reason to be gratified with these observations, and l10pe they may 11rove useful. By the same steamer that carried Mr. Black to Humboldt, Mr. Szabo took pa~sage for Port Orford, for the purpose of establishing at that point a self~registering gauge. He succeeded in erecting a structure for the gauge among the rock!< at the point clf~signafod on the accompanying chart of that place. His observations were commenced on July 25th, and continue at the present time. The first sheet I transmit herewith; it shows an uninterrupted curve of rise and fall for the month. I am indebted to Dr. Milhaw and Lieut. Kautz, of the U. S. army, stationed at Port Orford, for their kindness in facilitating Mr. Szabo's operations. The usual daily meteorological obsenations are made at each tidal station in connection with the tidal observationR. Much care was taken in instructing the obRervers in the uHe of the meteorological instruments, and the necessity of accuracy and faithfulness fully impressed upon them. The observations at Port Orford and4!Humboldt will be continued through three lunations, after which it is my intention to occupy Bodega as a tidal and magnetic station. The observations at Astoria are progressing favorably under the excellent care of Corporal \Vayne. The observations at San Ditgo continue uninterrupted. 'Nith the exception of one or two months, during which I could not communicate with the obsen-er, the o1Jservations have been as good as I could wish. The interruption of the ohsenations was caused by a piece of kelp getting into the aperture in the bottom of thr float-box. This waR not noticed hy the observer until his attention was called to the irregularities of the curve. It was then promptly remedied, and no interruption has occurred since. I have already informed you of the change in the 1iosition of the gauge in San Francisco bay, from North Beach to Fort Point, and of the substitution of a new machine with a scale of one-twelfth for the old one. This change has relieved me from the anxiety with which I was formerly obliged to watch the observations here. The gauge at Fort Point has been running two months without a single interruption. This gauge is now in charge of Sergeant H. E. Lhrlanclt, who joined me, according to your instructions, aliout the 1st ofиJuly. Sergeant Uhrlandt renders me valuable assistance in my office duties, besides conducting these observations. Magnetic observations.-1\fagnetic observations have been made at four stations, for determining the declination, intensity, and dip, at each station. The observations were made with Barrow's dip-circle, and the portable declinometer. The stations at which these observations were made were San Diego, San Pedro, San Luis Obis110, and Monterey. The observations at San Diego for dip consist of three sets on different clays, each set of observations consisting of twenty-four partial results. The observations for absolute declination rest upon one set of observations on the north star, after having determined several times the zero of the magnet scale. The time was determined by a transit, and I put confidence in the result: the intensity, by one set of experiments of vibration and one of deflection. Want of time prevented my repeating the observations. At San Pedro three similar sets of observations were made for dip ; and for absolute declination several sets of observations on the north star in connection with a mark: for intensity, two sets of vibration experiments and one of deflection. An equal number of observations were made at San Luis Obispo and Monterey, for the determination of the same elements of the magnetic force. It is my intention to make magnetic observations at Presidio and Bodega before the rainy season commences, if possible. On the accompanying coast-charts I have marked the general localities of the stations which have been occupied, and also the local position of the gauges. In the records of each station which have been transmitted, will be found particular descriptions of the different gauges. (See Sketch J-K, Western coast, where the stations are marked 'l'.) \Vhcrevcr staff observations have been made, the same method has been used of a floating staff.enclosed in a box, the staff being divided into feet and tenths and read by a)ixed index, high numbers corresponding to high tides. I have superintended personally the erection of all the gauges except those of Humboldt

and Port Orford, and have given each observer detailed written instructions with regard to his duties. The observers communicate with me monthly, or oftener, giving an account of the condition of their work. At the end of each month the observations for that month are transmitted to me, and the results of the observations determined and put in a tabular form. The original ob1;ervations, with copies of the tables, are then transmitted to the office. I sincerely hope tht:y have proved satisfactory, though I hardly dare hope that the results will meet your expectations ; if they do, I shall feel abundantly rewarded for my anxiety in conducting them. Very re~pectfully, your obedient servant,

APPENDIX No. 31.
Reports of the Chiefs of Divisions to Capt. H. W. Benham, Corps of Engineers, assistant in charge of tlte ojfice, slwwin[! the details of work executed in each Division.
REPORT OF MR. CHARLF.S A. SCHOTT, ACTING IN CHARGE OF THE COMPUTING DIVISION.

October 25, 1854. The annual report of this division for the year ending November 1, 1854, is herewith respectfully submitted. The c1mrge of the computing division has been continued with Assistant J. E. Hilgard, an~, in his absence, with myself. Mr. Hilgard having been engaged on field or special duties for the greater part of the year, I have been acting as chief of the division for nearly ten months. The organization and distribution of work has remained nearly as last year, it having proved very efficient. In addition to the duties of the computing division, as already stated in the Superintende_ut' s annual re~o~t _for 1853, th~t of adj1;1~ting the various geodetic and astronom1cal operat10ns, and of sat1sfymg the reqmred conditions by the application of the method of least squares is becoming of greater importance. This results from the generalJllan of conducting the operations simultaneously in the several sections thus affording, besides the checks in each when compared, independent checks and a. ~ea.sure of the accuracy.

The amount of work performed-the detail of which is appende<l to this report-appearR to exceed that of last year, owing to the greater familiarity of the computers with the kind of work asRigned to them. It was not neglected, however, to change occasionally the nature of the work, to insure to each computer a more general acquaintance with all the operations. The project of work, as approved, has been adheTed to as closely as circumstance>: would permit, and the reYision and adjustment of former operations has been brought np ns far as desirable. The current field-work of the year was attended to without delay, and calls for results or information were promptly answered. The duty at the magnetic ohscrYatory was assigned to the chief of the <liYision; and after Mr. Hilgard had resumed his field-operations in December last, the perfoction of the chemical and mechanical process of the self-Tegistering declinometer, the only instrument that has as yet been received, was left as a }lart of my duty, in which I was assisted by l\Ir. Hoover, and occasionally l1y Mr. l\Iain. A continuous photographic trace was brought out for a week before and a week after the solar eclipse in l\Iay last, during which, also, a set of meteorological observations were rnatle hy Messrs. Main, Hoover, \Viessner, and mvself. иThe distribution of the different classes of computations among the computers has been as follows: The computations for latitude and azimuth were made by 1\Ir. E. :Kulty; tlw reduction of transits and of chronometric differences of longitude, of astronomical revisions in general, and revisions of magnetic results, by Mr. J. Main. The reduction of triangulations were made by Assistant Werner; their revision and adjustment, generally, by Mr. G. Rumpf, who had also in charge the register of geographical positions. Reductiom of longitudes by moon-culminations and miscellaneous astronomical and geodetic 011erations were performed by Mr. J. Wiessner. Mr. J. T. Hoover acted as clerk to the diYision, and assisted in miscellaneous computations. The other members of the division have generally been working under the direction of some one of the above computers. 'When not in charge of the division, I have been engaged on special duty, and for a month and a half on hydrographic investigations or discussions by special direction of the Superintendent, or by calls from the assistant in charge. Revisions, reports, and discussions on astronomical, geodetic, or magnetic work in general, haYe formed a part of my duty. The gentlemen at present connected with the division have shown the same interest and prompt attendance on their respective duties as noticed in last year's report. The detail of the occupation of the several computers during the year ending November 1, 1854, is appended. Mr. Charles A. Schott was in charge of the computing division for nearly ten months. Among a number of reports submitted by him to the Superintendent and assi~tant in charge of the office, the following may be specially noticed : On the mean temperature of the air for each of the four seasons at five places on the Atlantic coast; on the temperature of the surface of the earth and at different depths; on the azimuth Cape Henlopen and 'fownbank, Section II; on the adjustment, by the method of least squares, of the seaboard triangulation from the base DaYis-Quilling, Section III, north to Cape Henlopen and south to Cape Charles; on catalogue enors in north polar distances of stars, deduced from observations with the zenith telescope; on the longitude of Telegraph Hill, Section X, from moon culminations; on the latitude of Agamenticus, Section I, from observations with zenith telescope; and on side equations. He has also reduced magnetic intensities observed at Cape Florida and Sand key, Section VI, and prepared astronomical and geodetic forms of record and reduction for the Congress map. The observations for changes of magnetic declination by the photographic self-registering instrument were continued at intervals from December till June, and the chemical and mecha~ical. process improved. A continuous trace was brought out, showing the changes of declmat10n during a fortnight in May last, at the time of the solar eclipse. Mr. 8chott has also devoied a large portion of his time to investigations of currents, and submitted, among other ~eports, the following: 1st, on our knowledge of the Gulf Stream prior to Coast Survey mvestigations; 2d, on currents in St. John's river and Port St. George inlet, Section VI; 3d, on currents near Ship shoal, Louisiana, Section VIII; 4th, on tidal currents of the Nantucket shoals, including several papers; 5th, on tidal currents in Muskeget channel and approaches, and also upon the currents in Salem harbor. 6и

G. Rumpf has kept the registers of geographical positions, and prepared them for publication in the Superintendent's report of 1853; has indexed and labelled the astronomical and geodetic records previous to 1844, and revised the triangulations on the Florida reef, the horizontal angles of primary triangulation of Section IV, and solved the conditional equations of Mount Blue, Section I. He has completed the revision of the secondary triangulation of the Upper Chesapeake, and adj1rnted, by the method of least squares, the seaboard triangulation north and south of Davis-Quilling, Section III; computed geographical positions near Key Vv est and near Brooklyn, Section II; made a reduction of observations south of Cape Henry, Section III, 1854; Cape Fear River triangulation, Section IV, 1852-53; and of Savannah river, 1851. He has also made miscellaneous computations for the use of the office ; revised the azimuth computations of Town bank and Cape Henlopen, Section II; and directed the computations made by Messrs. J.E. Nulty, H. Pyne, D. A. Burr, and J. H. Toomer. ifllr. Jame1J Main has revised the computations for azimuth at Mount Rose, Section II; has put the magnetic term day-observations into curves ; reduced the longitudes from chronometer transportations of Bodega bay, Haven's anchorage, Mendocino city, Shelter cove, Bucksport, Trinidad bay, Crescent Citv, Port Orford, UJnquah river, Astor Point, and Lummi island, Sections X and XI; and revised finally the reductions of magnetic declination, dip, and intensity, in all the sections. Some miscellaneous computations were also made for the use of the office. llfr. John E. Nulty reduced mean to apparent places of stars for latitude reductions; assisted Mr. Rumpf in making out abstracts of horizontal angles of stations north of Davis, Section III, and on the Chesapeake, upper part. He computed, under Mr. Rumpf's direcи tion, the triangulation of the Canal de Haro and Rosario straits, and performed other miscellaneous work. His services were discontinued on July 1st. JJfr. J. Wiessner bas extended the projection tables to answer for the extent of the United States; revised horizontal angles at Sebattis, and computed triangles north of it; computed the latitude of Washington city, Hilgard's observatory, and approximately those observed by Assistant Davidson in Sections X and XI; and revised the latitude of Aagamenticus, Z.

REPORT OF OFFICE-WORK EXECCTED IN THE TIDAL DIVISION IN CHARGE OF ASSISTANT L. 1'. POL'RTALES.

Since the date of my last annual report, the organization of this division of the office'has undergone no material change. The duties performed have been of two kinds: 1st. The reducing of observations as they are received from the observers. This is done as far as possible immediately after their receipt, so that defects may be soon detected and remedied, and also in order that tide-tables may be IJie1iared at short notice whenever wanted. 2d. The discussion of observations extended over long periods, or made at stations presenting remarkable peculiarities 1 their comparison with theory and the formation of tables to be used in the prediction of tides. The most important piece of work coming under this head, is the discussion of_the tides observed at Boston dry-dock since 184'1. The results will not only enable us to predict the tides at Boston with considerable accuracy, but will also reduce greatly the labor of obtaining complete tidal data for any other place in the northern part of the Atlantic coast. The observations on which this discussion is based, proYe to have been taken very faithfully, and reflect great credit on Mr. Isaac 'Williams, the observer. Another very important discussion in progress coming under this head, is the one relating to the tides of the Gulf of Mexico. The series of observations being now complete, or nearly so, the work will probably be pushed to a successful termination in the course of the coming year. Approximate results were worked out from the observations of tides on the Western coast as soon as the number of observations seemed to warrant it. They were communicated by the Superintendent to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at its meeting in this city in May last. T_he co?1putations relating to a first approximation towards the determination of the co-tidal Imes on the Atlantic coast were also performed in this division, from forms furnished by the Superintendent, who communicated a paper on that subject to the same body on the above occasion. The work named under the first bead was performed by Messrs. Hawley, Nes, Fend~II, Montgomery, Bagwell, Parrish, Bassett, Duval, Baker, and Blanchard; the discussion classed under the seco11d head by Messrs. Mitchell, Heaton, Aиery, Kincheloe, and Burr .

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

llir. H. JJfifchell began in December to discuss the observations taken at Boston dr)и-dock during a period of six and a half years, Sir \V. Lubbock's discussions of the tides of Londor:. and Liverpool иbeing taken as a model. He was enage<l on that work almost continually until he left for the field, on the 6th of July. He was in charge of the division during my absence in the field in nlay and June. 1lfr. B. Heaton has chiefly been engaged in the computations for the discussions of the tides of the Gulf of l\Iexico, and varticularly of the observations made during two years at Galveston, TexaR. These computations wern made under the immediate direction of the Superintendent. He has also made a part of the computations relating to the determination of the co-ti<lal lines, and other miscellaneous work at <lifferent times. ~~Ir. R. S. Avery joined the office on the 17th of October, 1853; and, after having benome familiar with the subject by making some of the simple reductions of tides, he took up, jointly with l\fr. Mitchell, the discussion of the Boston tides, on which he iR Rtill engaged. 'l'hc reRultR already obtained have proved him to be a careful and accurate computer. 3Ir. J. Kincheloe joined the office July 22, and was assigned to aid Mr. Avery in the discussion of the Boston tides, in which duty he has shown assiduity and usefulness. J.1h. D. A. Burr was temporarily ordered to join this division from the computing 1foиision, to which he belongs, in order to treat a set of observations made at Curl's Keck, in the James river, after Airy's method of discussing river tides. He began .August 19, and finished October 23, and has sl10wn assiduity aml considerable skill for so young a computer . .2Jfr. P. R. Hawley has lJeen engaged, during the whole year, in reading off the observations of tiilei; rernnled by Hw self-registering tide-gauges, and in making first and second reductions of the same. 1f.fr. C. Fcndall was attached to this diYision until July 15, when he joined Mr. Mitchell's imrty in the fieltl. He was chiefly engaged in reducing the observations made on the ordinary tide-gauges, in preparing tide-tables, and in other miscellaneous duties. He has also made a number of diagrams illustrating the tides of the Vv es tern coast, and the distribution of temperature1; in the Gulf Stream. ии Nr. F. F. Nes was lиugaged, until February 8, in making reductions of observations made with ordinary tide-gauges, in completing former computations which had not been made according to the plan now adopted, and in other miscellaneous duties. He was then attached to a field party. J.l:Ir. G. C. Blanchard reported July 15, and has been engaged in ordinary first and second reductions, and in copying. Mes8rs. 11Iontgomery, Bagwell, Parrish, Bassett, Dm:al, and Baker, were only attachetl temporarily to this diYision for short perio<ls of time, intervening between their return from, and departures for, field duty. They were occupied on various computations connected with the tides. In concluding, I would remark that, with very few exceptions, the computers in this Cl.ivision have taken great interest in the results of their work-a cause always productive of zeal and an ambition to be correct. Special mention is due, in this res1)ect, to Messrs. Mitchell, Avery, and Heaton. Respectfully submitted:

llEPORT OF CAPTAIN .A. A. GIBSON, U. S. A., IN CHARGE OF THE DRAWING DIVISION.
COAST SURVEY OFFICE,

November 30, 1854. In presenting the following report of the drawing division for the year which has just clmied, I respectfully refer to a statement of work accomplished, showing the specific duties performed by each draughtsman, and a list of maps and sketches completed or in progress. The force, numerically, has not been greater than heretofore, and may be considered the minimum, under the pre11ent requirements of the divisiou. With another first class

и

draughtsman, and with the rapid improvement of the less experienced, I confidently lidicve that the force will soon be adequate to meet all demands existing or to come. The work executed on contract has been limited; but not so much from want of material to give out, as from tlrn difHcu1ty of engaging proper drangldRmen. No material changes in the organization of the division have been made; nor have I discovered the necessity of proposing any amendments to the rules and regulations by which it is governed. It is worthy of note how interesting the work of this diYision is becoming, from the magnitude of the results of the survey, and how, from the a1)parently chaotic mass in which they are first presented, art moulds them into expressive form. The reductions of the first order are no less distinguished for their exquisite finish, than for their extreme accuracy; they are models for the engraver, which, to reprotluce, would be the highest attainment of his skill. Nor is this approach to perfection more necessary for the accurate representation of minute details of topography on the scale of coast charts, than to enable the engraver to copy them truthfully, and without confusion. I can hardly speak in exaggerated terms of the fidelity with which the more experienced draug-htsrnen execute their work. By long practice they have acquired wonderful facility in detecting the faults of original work, and ingenious methods of rectifying them when the case admits. A reduction to Hirhn, containing errors exceeding sixty feet, is rejected. Considering the extreme tests to which the surveys are here sulijectecl, the hindrances to reduction arising from their imperfections have been comparatively slight. 'rhe most general source of error is the shrinkage of the paper. To meet this difficulty, eyery sheet furnished to the plane-table and hydrographic parties is prepared. in this division, the trigonometrical points being plotted, and parallels pr(\jected, only when the atmosphere is favorable. The verification immediately follows, to make certain that at some one moment the measurements are true; then, whatever distortion by use or иexposure the sheet may subsequently undergo, : ;ie draughtsmen possess the means of restoring upon their reductions the true relation of t~ie t.0pography t.o the trigonometrical determinations. The expcrimenu or using backed paper appears to have given to the field-parties uniYersal satisfaction, but it has not been found the best method for reductions stretched on boards. The most popular method of reducing is by "squares," constructed upon some line connecting trigonometrical points. The camera is seldom used for any lmt hydrographic reductions. The pantograph has not been introduced. A successful trial was made of it, but under such disadyantages as to render its economy doubtful without some device for more readily applying this instrument to separate sheets. Of its economy and relief to the eye there is no question. The expansion of the survey haR made the subject of projects almost an exclusive branch. The Atlantic coast is now so nearly defined as to require the immediate study of proRpective charts-and you are acquainted with the fact that it has alread~и rereivecl considerable attention. In this I have received Yaluable assistance from l\lr. \V. P. Schulz. who was recently relieved from clerical duties for a better application of his services to the miscellanies of the division, which have largely multi1)lied in the past year. During the summer I made views of the approaches to Salem and Gloucester harbors, and of the city of Petersburg, Va. The improvement of the less experienced draughtsmen has been flattering; it is evidently the result of an earnest desire to excel, and of the example of those more proficient. \Vith gratification I recur to the evidences of a uniform disposition in each and all to discharge their duties promptly and well.

Statement of work acc<Y1nplished in the Drawing Division d'Uring the year ending November,
1854, in the order of draughtsmen. 1. W. M. C.

REPORT OF !ill. GEORGE MATHIOT,

rn

CHARGE OF THE ELECTROTYPE DIVISIO,N,

CoAsT SURVEY OFFICE, Washington, November 1, 1854. During the past year I have made eighty plates by the electrotype.process. Thirty-five of the plates were alto or mould plates; forty-two were basso or printmg plates ; and three were blank plates for engraving. Appended is a table of the plates. One plate was extended by the electrotnJe process, ("Sketeh E, in Section V,") being enlarged in one direction. I have also, hy the electrotype process, gold-plated seven deep-sea thermometers, and parts of several others. Assistance has been rendered the computing division in the application of photography to the registration of magnetic variations. During the past summer, as opportunity would permit, without interfering with the electrotype work, I have made a number of experiments on the natural-engraving processes proposed by DONNE, GROVE, GAUDIN, TALBOT, and NIEPCE, with a view of obtaining by chemical means, and directly from the original drawings of the survey, copper-plates ready for printing maps, without the long and tedious process of the mechanical artist. So far, I have not deterrn,ined that I shall obtain a chemiglyphic process; yet I have been much encouraged by my experiments, and have strong hopes of being able to substitute this process for a considerable portion of the engraving, if not to make a complete map. My examination has not yet extended to the processes of Niepce and Talbot, except that I have determined that their processes can be worked on copper, which is much more economical than steel, as the platt"S of copper can be prepared by the clectrotvpe process of perfect surface, while expensive manual labor only can furnish those of steel: M. Donne proposed to etch a daguerreotype with nitric acid. The chemical difference between the ''lights'' and ''shades'' of the daguerreotype appears to be sufficient to determine the action of the acid to the dark parts, which are supposed to be silver, while the lights are mercury. I found this process extremely uncertain. In twenty carefully-conducted experiments I succeeded but once in getting definite markings, and this on a portion only

of the plate experimented on ; hence, I conclude the process is not likely ever to be turned to account. и Professor Grove proposed to engrave the daguerreot.nie by electro-etching it, making it the positive electrode in a strong bath of cblorohydric acid. This process gives engraving of great beauty, but, unfortunately, of very great delicacy. I made over a hundred trials of this process, and, although I generally obtained a beautiful engraving, yet in only two instances did I obtain lines of sufficient depth to print from, ancl then the quantity of ink which could be held in the line was only sufficient to give a mere stain on the }Japer, instead of a well-defined black line. M. Gaudin proposed to conduct the process of M. Donne on a plate of steel, covered with a film of silver to enable it to receive the daguerrian image. This was designed for producing the graving on a more durable material than silver. But :M. Gaudin does not state whether he designed merely to communicate a silver character to the surface of the steel, to enable it to be used as a daguerrian plate, or whether he designed such a cQating, that while it might be eaten through in the shades, to expose the easily-oxidable steel, the lights would be protected by the silver film. If the former were his design, I mmit conclude, from my experiments, that it is impossible, because an indefinitely thin coating of noble metal over an oxidable one determines the formation of multitudes of small galvanic circles on the surface. I have long had the idea of silvering a copperplate just sufficiently thick to defend the copper from such chemical action as would corrode it, and of then eating through this film by the process of Professor Grove, and afterwards well biting the copper in the bared parts. This I have great expectation of determining to be a practicable method of producing a chemiglyphic line-engraving; but the essential idea of this is probably due to Thl. Gaudin instead of mvself. The thickness иof the film of silver required for the protection of the base metal I have found to be quite considerable; and this, combined with the very slight depth to which the silver can be etched, make the problem of obtaining an engraved plate by the method I propose one of great delicacy. Unfortunately, the requisite thickness of the film is nearly equal to the greatest depth of bite that can he obtain1"d ; and hence we may have a good Grove's etching on the film, yet the base metal only partially denuded; and then, if we attempt to enter the lines into the base metal, the reimlt will be extremely irregular aud partial. Again, if the :film of silver is not quite sufficient in thickness, the lights of the daguerreotype will l>e attacked, and the shades blurred by the spread of the lines. The problem depends, therefore, on getting a good protecting film, and then a good biting through this film. If the thickness of the film was not, unfortunately, so nearly equal to the depth to which the silver can be etched, I think the making of an engraved plate by chemical means would be comparatively easy. A copper-plate should have the surface pиrepared very perfectly. It is then to be electroplated to the weight of one-eighth of a grain to the S<JUar<' inch; hut thi,; thickness is not yet well determined. The plate, after being washed in distilled water and dried, is to be slightly buffed, and the daguerreotype taken in the usual manner. Professor Grove recommended chlorohydric acid as the electrolyte for etching ; but, in acting on a plate of base metal merely infilmed with the silver, we evidently should select au electrolyte which will not be liable to act on the base metal. Of the various electrolytes I tried, I found chloride of sodium the best; this seems to free the generatecl chloride of silver more readily than chlorohydric acid, is without much action on the copper base, and has the very great advantage of being free from poisonous qualities or disagreeable exhalations. The object of the biting process so far has been only to remove the silver from the parts where we want the copper to be bitten in deep lines ; but this process evidently cannot be continued till the copper has been bitten sufficiently deep, for it acts on the silver as well as the copper. Hence, the first biting should be continued only long enough to work through the silver film; here there is a liability of spoiling the work in the beginning by overdoing the first biting, which will infallibly remove the silver from the lights in some places, and give the whole plate a blurred or mezzotinted ap11earance. I can give no directions for the time of the biting through the film ; practice and dexterous manipulation, as in the daguerreotype process, are the only helps here. After the plate has been bitten through the film, it should be washed by immersing in

water, and dried over a current of heated air. If, on examination, there appear no marked defects, the process of entering the lines into the copper may be gone on with. For this purpose I have used perchloride of iron, persulphate of iron, and also nitrate of silver. I have not determined which of these is the 1)est, but so far I have a preference for the perchloride of iron. The perchloride may he added to water until it has a lemon-yellow color. The plate is to be immersed in a horizontal position with the face up in the sol vent, and a soft camel's hair pencil swept gently over it from time to time. In the course of thirty minutes, or less, the action of the perchloride will have thrown up the chloride of silver, so that the brush can sweep it away, and the bright copper will then appear in the bottoms of the lines. The plate may then be washed and dried, and if, on inspection, it should not be thought deep enough to hold the ink for printing, it may be returned to the hath of perchloride for a short time. I have not yet obtained a plate which bas not been much corroded in the lights; and this corrodoing in the light has caused me to discontinue the second biting, before the depth of the lines has been sufficient to hold the full quantity of ink required to give a clear black print. "When nitrate of silver is used for the Recond biting, the tendency to open the pores of the film is not so great as when the iron salts are used; but this solvent has a very great tendency to deposite the reduced silver in the fine lines, and this even closes the pores of the film; but, for coarse lines, I have thought that it made a cleaner plate than the iron salts. I have sought to obtain a third biting, by filling the lines obtained by the second biting with some non-conducting suhstance, and then heavily silvering or gilding the lights, dissolving out the non-conducting substance from the lines, and again biting; but every experiment I have made in this direction has failed, for the following reasons: the only salts of silver and gold which can be successfully used for electro-deposition are alkaline; the alkali, acting on the oil, gum, resin, wax, or otber hydro-uarbon which fills the line, dissolves it before the lights arc sufficiently coated. Again, when the non-conducting film in the lines is very thin, it is ruptured by the affinity which the negative element of the electrolyte has for the copper. I find that asphaltum is not very readily acted on by the alkaline salts of the noble metals, but I have not yet succeeded in working this substance into the lines. I took an alto by the electrotype process from a plate, after the first biting, and gave the alto a good coat of gold, and ground down the raised lines with a soft piece of charcoal, so as to cut through the gilding and expose the copper. The plate was then bitten with the perchloride of iron. All the fine lines, as the hair-strokes of the letters and figures, were destroyed, but a good solid cutting of the coarser parts was obtained. In putting on the silver, I judged of the thickness and weight by making the current which reduced the silver pass through a voltameter in the same circuit, and carefully noting the volume of hydrogen evolved, and referring to the respective equivalents and specific gravities. This is a rather laborious process, but it is probably the only one by which small quantities of electro-deposited metal can be measured. In conclusion, I would remark that not much should be expected from experiments conducted only at odd hours during a couple of months; and though a useful result has not yet been obtained, still the products are very encouraging, and, thus far, more satisfactory than might reasonably be expected from the short time devoted to the examination.

PUBLISHI~\G,

DISTRIBl'TING, AXD SALE

At the date of my last report, November 15, 1853, forty-seven sheets of Coast Survey ma1is had been published. Since then, important additions having been made to the plates of "Wellfleet harbor" and "Galveston entrance," they have been added to the number previously published, which, in addition to Newburyport harbor, Salem harbor, Long Island sound, (in three sheets,) and Charleston harbor, (the last three mentioned expected to be completed by December 31, 1854,) will raise the number published, including Alden's reconnaissance No. 2, to fifty-six maps. Important additions and corrections having been made to the following preliminary charts, new editions have been published, viz: D1o1.vis' South shoals. Cape Fear river and New inlet. North Edisto river. Horn Island Pass. Aransas Pass. San Diego bay. Reconnaissance Western coast No, 1. There are at present ready for distribution 380 bound volumes, containing all of the principal and most important maps now published, printed on thin paper. These books are intended to be distributed to members of Congress, prominent officers of the general government, and foreign ministers. An annual distribution of maps is now being made, by which about nine thousaml impressions from new plates will be distributed. The plates are eleven in number, as fol!owl': 1. General chart of the coast from Gay Head to Cape Henlopen, vicinity of New 1 ork. 2. иw~llflcet harbor, Massachusetts.

There were issued during the year included in the above distribution, twenty-two complete sets of all the maps and sketches published, to universities, institutions, committees of both houses of Congress, and individuals connected with commerce, navigation, &c., throughout the different sections of the Union.

APPENDIX No. 32.

Description of the Congress map, by Lieut. J. 0. Tidball, U. S. A., Assistant in Coast Survey. The Congress map is upon a single sheet about nine feet square, on which is projected, to a scale of Tnhirni the entire coast of the United States, exhibiting, by colors and other conventional signs, the progress made in the several operations of the Coast Survey. The projection used is the polyconic, a method fully explained in Appendix No. 39, Report of Superintendent Coast Survey for 1853. The central meridian fol' the Eastern coast is 84░ W. from Greenwich. The Western coast being projected separately, has its central meridian 120░ W. from Greenwich. Meridian lines and parallels of latitude are laid down for each degree.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The Eastern coast of the United States is represented in an unhroken line from Passamaquoddy bay, the northeaste11 limit of Maine, following the various indentations of the shore arou'Ilrl the 1wnirnmla of Florida to the mouth of the Rio Grande, upon the Gulf of Mexico; and the "\Vestern, or Pacific coast, from Frazer's river, near the northwesterly limit ofvVashington Territory, to San Diego, the southern limit cf the United States upon the Pacific. The northern shore of Cuha and the coasts of Nova Scotia, island of Cape Breton, and a large part of Newfoundland, are likewise laid down, as also the lmundaries of the States and the northern lakes. The general direction and limits of the Gulf Stream are marked out in their proper positions, and the temperature is indicated by shaded bands, increasing in width to the north and east, which are darker in proportion to its greater warmth at different localities, as determined by a system of exrlorations extending from cape Florida to Cape Cod, and by a series of temperature soundings across the axis of the stream from the following points ; Cape Cod, Montauk Point, Sandy Hook, Cape Henlopen, Cape Henry, Cape Hatteras, Cape Fear, Charleston, St. Simons, St. Augustine, and Capo Canaveral. Diagrams for each of these sections arc shown llllOn the map, in which the curves of different temperatures at the same depths and of the same tcm1)erature at different de1iths are laid down, and also sections representing the form of the bottom of the ocean, which is therein shown to be diversified by mountains and valleys not unlike the earth's surface above water. J?u11 explanations of those CX}llorations and diagrams are giYen in the report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey for 1853 and 1854. The progress of the various descriptions of work of the survey is shown upon the map by different colors and other conventional signs, which 1neRent at a glance the operation8 in the two grand divisions of the labor-namely, the field and office work; the former of which comprises the topographical and hydrographic reconnaissances, the 'magnetic and astronomical observations, the primary and secondary triangulations, the topography and hydrography; and the latter, the drawing of topography in progress, drawing of hydrogrnphy in progress, engraving of topography in progress, engraving of hydrography in progress, published topography, and published hydrography. The meaning of these colors and signs is explained in the legend U})()n the map. 'l'hc lines and stations where the magnetic telegraph has been used for astronomical observations are marked out, showing the extent to which this great modern invention has becиn employed for scientific purposeR in the ascertaining of longitudes upon the Coast Survey. The map, therefore, as its title indicates, exhibits at one general view the configuration of the coast of the United States, and the limihi of the Gulf Stream, the probable limits of soundings, and, by colors, the charts published or in progress; and the extent to which the rcco11nai8sanccs, triangulation, topography, and hydrogra1Jhy, respectively, are completed or in progress, to November 1, 1854, as compiled from the archives of the Coast Survey and other authorities; and is susceptible of additions and alterations to show the advancement of all these different portions of the work in the successive years. A table is laid down upon the map, giving, in a condensed form, the statistics of the Coast Sun-ey at 11eriods from 1844 to 1854, showing the total of the work that has been accomplished during that time. A list of Coast Survey charts published, giving the locality, class, scale, aml date of publication, is also to be found upon the map. 'l'he conventional signs for topographical drawings, used, more or less, upon all the Coast Survey charts, arc delineated and explained upon the same sheet ; as also scales of shade used in to1wgraphical drawings, to represent the different declivities of ground, by which accurate graphic reprel'!entations of portions of the country bordering upon the coast have been ob~aincd i.n such manner that their respective elevations and declivities may be judged of by 111spect10n only. 'l'he current-charts, showing the manner of representing, by curves, the direction and velocity of tid~l cu:rents in .different harb~rs and sounds, ~nd tidal diagrams, showing the manner of reg1stermg the nse and fall of tides by means ot curves, are easily understood by inspection. A tide-table added, gives the rise, fall, and mean duration, &c., of tides at the principal harbors upon the coast.

APPENDIX No. 33.

CornparБ.son of the reduction of horizontal angles by the methods of dependent directions and of dependent angular quantities, by the method of least squares.
The inquiry as to the best mode of treating the primary triangulation to ol1tain its results, has been prosecuted in the computing di'l'ision, carefnlly and with much minuteness of detail. The comparison of the early results indicated that the measures of the angles as obtained directly from the average of the successive observations at any station on each of twoиother stations, including an angle of the triangulation, gaYe angles which filled the triangles better than those deduced from the process of least squarei,; a8 emvloyed by Best'cl and others. This, as was seen at the time, depended, probably, upon the fact that the i;tations at which the observations were made were too few in number to ginи results imlepemlent of law, and depending only on probability. The discussion of the obserratiom; l1y adjusting the incidental errors by the application of the method of anguliir quantities \ms next made and continued as new stations were occupied, ancl has now been carried sufficiently far to give a definitive result. A part of the equations of condition (38) were founcl by Assistant J.E. Hilgarcl, in charge of the computing division of the Coast Survey Office, and a part (27) by Charles A.. Schott, esq., when acting in charge of the division. The discussions extend from the Massachusetts base to the line :Mount Independencc-1\Iount Pleasant. (Sketch A bis.) I have thought that it might be of service to present the mode of discussion by least squares, as developed with great plainness, directness, and elegance, liy Mr. Schott, (herewith appended, marked S.) This includes the entire question of the determination of those resulting values best satisfying the obserYations at a given point and the geometrical conditions of a triangulation. In the ordinary mode of discussing the angles, each angle is supposed to be measured by an observation at its Yertex station on the two other stations including it. Each determination so made is considered independent of others, and the mean of several independent determinations is assumed to give the final value of the angle. As, in the actual measurements in the primary triangulation, the stations upon which observations are made are observed in series, the first of the two more refined methods-that of adjusting directions-would find application in preference to the secondthat of adjusting angular spaces. But as the series (especially wlicn numerous signals arc observed upon from the one where the measurements are made) are ordinarily 1'roken, any notable difference would be certain to show itself; and it was on this account that the second method received a trial. A preliminary inquiry, or investigation, was made to determine whether all the observations should be allowed equal weight, or whether they should be classed according to the appearance of the signals used-generally heliotropes. The appearance of the signals had been elaborately noted, and it was therefore easy to decide this question. The comparison of groups of cases when the signal was most satisfactorily seen for steadiness and sharpness, with the opposite, showed that the discreJJancy from the mean value of an angle could not be estimated by the condition of the signal, and that lateral refraction made observations which, from the attendant circumstances, seemed good, actually of inferior value to others made under apparently worse conditions. Equal weight was, therefore, given to the individual observations. I. By treating the observations at each station by the mctho<l of dependent directions, the results marked (A) in the following pages were deduced, and by the method of dependent angles, those marked (B.) The stations are referred to in the order required hy the equations of condition; their positions will readily be found. (Skefoh A bis.) Tho stations at which the observations were made are marked in SMALL CAPITALS, and are regularly numbered.

The spherical exceRses were checked by adding together the excesses of the triangles covering the same area, and were found correct to unity in the third place of decimals. The numerical quantities contained in the equations of condition given by the figure are the following, in which the number of the equation is expressed by the Roman numeral, the angles by the m1mbers at the angular points for subsequent reference, and the angles deduced by least squares and by the methods of dependent angular quantities and of dependent directions, as before, by the columns (B) and (A). The logarithms of the sines of the angles are carried only to seven places of decimals, in the equation of the sides (side equations,) as sufficient for the 11resent purpose.

So that both methods give the same result. In. di~<:Ussing the equations of sides, three directions were found, to which an equable d1stnbution of error should not be applied: two of these had already been indicated in the record of observations where a defective adjustment of the signal was noted; the other w:as pr?bably a case of lateral refraction. After making the correction indicated by a d1scuss1on of t~ese three cases, the results were again elaborately compared by Mr. Schott; but t~e ~onclus1ons were essentially the same, the numerical results only differing slightly, but w1thm the limits of the probable error of the determination in favor of method (B) in reference to ~eom~trical conditions of the figure of the triangulation, as will be seen b~ the ann~xed, which ~111 serve also as a connected recapitulation of the results of the companson.

The mean error of an angle is within O''.и 02 of the result derived from the filling of the spherical triangles. It appears, tlien, as a final conclusion: 1. That from the test of the agreement of the different results among themselves, the methods are equal. 2. That from the test of filling the spherical triangles, the method (A) has the advantage. 3. That the side equations are equally well satisfied by both methods. The balance is thus so nearly equal that from the nature of the ,observations, and the rigid impartialit.y of the first method denoted by A, the decision must be given in its favor in the discussion of the primary triangulation.

s.
ADJUSTMENT OF HORIZONTAL ANGLES OF A TRIANGULATION.

By Cltas. A. Schott, Computing Dillision Coast Surt!ey Office.

'When we attempt to deduce the best results from observed quantities, which are supposed to exist in greater number than are absolutely required, it becomes of paramount importance to make use of a method which, in leading to a result approximating nearest the truth, admits, at the same time, of no arbitrary choice among the materials collected. The method of least squares fulfils both conditions by making the sum of the squares of the errors a minimum, and by admitting of but one result-the most probable. Its application implies that the differences necessarily occurring in the measurements, or the incidental errors, are of such an order that we can treat them as differentials. In the special application of this method to the adjustment of horizontal angles of a triangulation, its general theory is supposed to be known. The discrepancies met with in the angular measurements and deduced parts of a series of triangles arise from two distinct causes, which are, for the sake of convenience, treated separately. 1. Disagreement of the observation.~ among the:mseh,es. The tirst of these causes is, that the reading of the directions at a given station, or the lines of vision 1 deviate from the true ones from the influence of lateral refraction, the im-

*Tl

perfections of the instrument, the changes produced by variation of temperature, etc., etc. By the application of this method in this case, we deduce the most probable value of each direction, or of each angle, observed at this station. This process of partially or fully closing the horizon is effected in two way~, depending on tlie nature of the oliiservations, which give either the directions from which to deduce the angles, or the angles and their combinations directly, independent of directions. The first method recommends it~elf for (non-repeating) imtruments of superior graduation; the second, for (l'epeating) instruments иwhose circle is of smaller size, ancl of less perfect graduation. 2. Discrepancies exhibited by tlie geometrical conditions of the triangulation not being . strictly.fulfilled by the observed quantities. Secondly, discrepancies arise from the fact that we are unable to centre tbe instrument exactly in the vertical of the ol~ject obser-.;ecl upon, or to observe the same vertical from the surrounding stations; also from irregularities in the spheroidal form of the earth. 'l'hc adjustment involves two kinds of equations-the equations of angles and the equations of sides, so called by Bessel. The 11ngJe eqn11tions subsi~t between the obseTYecl sums of the angles frirming a spheroidal triangle, and the side equations invoh'e the condition that the several directions to any one station intersect in the same vertical line or point. The object of this paper is to give a brief account of the adjustment of the discrepancies between the observations maclc at any one station hy either of the method~, (A ancl H,) ancl also of those arising from the geometrical con(litiom, (C.) From the above two considerations, the corrections to any o1)served angle o are J and D.; the one resulting from the adjustment of the directions or angles at a station, the other from the geometrical conditions existing in the figure of the triangulation. The method requires :E (J + D. )2 = a minimum, which is identical, according to its principles, with making :k J 2 and ~D. 2 , respectively, minima. The conditional equations arising from considerations (1) and those arising from (2) are coexistent, and increase enormously the number of equations as well as the number of terms in each, rendering the solution impracticable for any extended or complex triangulation; it becomes, therefore, of great importance to diminish this labor. It has been founrt in the primary triangulation of Section I, which presents all required facilities, that the probable error in any resulting angle is = ▒ O".:W5 (with an uncertainty of 0".008) from observations of either directions or angles at any one station; and the same probable error in any resulting angle= ▒ 011 и 26fi, (with an uncertainty of U" .038,) as deduced from the geometrical conditions of the figure, and the same from angle as well aR side equations. Hence, the proportion of the errors of the former and latter results is as 4: 7 nearly, or the discrepancies arising from the figure are nearly double those from the coincidence of the observations themselves. This ratio, however, is Yariablc, and is a function of the size of the triangles. This justifies the method of first equating the angles at any one station, and with these corrected angles o+J, to enter the angle and side equations which determine the further corrections D.: no subsequent notice of the conditions (1) is taken. For other triangulations, in which the above ratio is less favorable for this division of labor, it may become necessary to sacrifice a small portion of accuracy in order to diminish the amount of labor; cases may even occur 'vhen this is absolutely demanded. As it is, the effect of the first adjustment will necessarily remain in the second operation. (A.)-Adfustrnent of lwrizontal angles at a single station from observations of directions, or method A of reduction. The method to be followed generally is now to be explained, and consists in finding the most probable value of the angles, so far as th,.ey depend on observations of directions made at the station. If all the stations were oliserved upon in every series of observations, the mea~ .would represent the result. This is seldom the case, as some of the signals may not be VISible, or may not be sufficiently steady to be observed. Let A, B, C, etc., (Figure A, Plate 58,) denote the angles between the lines of direction from the point of observation to the several signals, m., m', rn", etc., the readings ot' any seri~s, whic? readings we suppose to have been corrected for run of micrometers and plwse of signal?, if. nee;issary,. and which, generally, are means of the several verniers. Cor!иections for mclmat10n of signals and for eccentricity can, in most cases, be applied to the final result, and need not further be noticed here.

x =the angle between the zero of the instrument and the first direction.

Then a single series of observations gives the equations

o =ml' - x- B, etc., there being as many such equations as there are observed directions.
To make these equations general, they may be multiplied by ../p ../p' vp", etc., in which the value of these factors, for all observed directions, will be unity; and for those not observed, zero. The equations then become: o= ../p (m-x), O= -Ip' (m'-x-A), O= ../p" (ml'-x-B),etc. A second series of observations will, in like manner, give the equations:

The solution of these normal equations gives the value of A, B, C, etc., as determined at the station. The further dependence of these values, when we consider the observations at other stations of the scheme of triangles, may be expressed by the equations:

r

= [aa] (1) +[ab] (2) + [ac] (3) + ..... . Q =[ab] (l) + [bb] (2) +[be] (3) + ..... . R = [ac] (J) +[be] (2) +[cc] (3) + ..... .

etc. where (1) (2) (3,) etc., denote corrections to our A, B, C, etc., as found above. Agreeably to what has been said in the preface, we will not furt}1er pursue this subject. It is obvious that the reduction will be accomplished most readily if all the combinations of a like sort are placed togetl1er, and tlrnt fewer figures will he necessary, if from each direction a preceding one is subtracted, taking as a zero the first obserYed direction in each series. Dy this process of diminishing the readingR of each direction h~- the first in the series, the remainders become comparable for the sCYeral series of the same initial direction. This also enables us to take means of the quantities in all similar series for the purpose of obtaining the assumed directions as near as possilile to the true ones, which will greatly add to the facility of the reduction. To illustrate the above, I propose to introduce so much of an example as will suffice to show the actual working of the method. The observations at station Agamcnticus of the primary triangulation of Section I, are selected for thi8 purpose.
Station Agamenticus.

Abstract of resulting readings of the directions in each series: The first line in each series of the following abstract contains the readings of each direction, expressed in seconds, with the instrument in direct position ; the second line the same, with instrument in reversed position. The readings are means to which the necessary corrections have already been applied. In the primary triangulation alluded to, each of the above quantities is the mean of six readings of the three verniers, and is corrected for run of micrometers. The third line contains the mean of the quantities in the first and second lines; and the fourth, the remainders obtained Ly rmbtracting the first direction in each series from the others. The last line will be expluined further on.

(B.) .Adfustment of horizontal ang[es depending on conditions between tlte angular quantii1'.cs obtained at any single station, or method B of reduction. и This method applies to the observations of angles, usually obtained by repetitions; and instead of equating directions, as in the first method, its object is to furnish the most probable values for the scYcral observed angles from a supernumerary number of angles. Between n objects, surrounding a station, we necessarily ha Ye n-1 angles, and any additional angle between the same objects, which is, of necessity, one of sums of the others, furnishes a conditional equation. When no such sum-angles have been observed, the method of least squareR in its application to this case, is simply reduced to the taking of means. For instance, if, in Sketch 58, figure B, we measure the angles as indicated, and also sum-anglesP and reduce them, we would equate the horizon hut partially;. but as soon as the angle between E and A (or any of the other Btations and A) is measured, the operation is known as tbat of closing the horizon, and the sum of the angles between A and B, Band 0, &c., and E and A, must equal 360░. Method A gi.-es, without further consideration, proper weight to its results, in reference to the number of observations of each direction. This is not the case, however, in method B, unless specially introduced. It is not the place here to explain the mode of obtaining the relative weight of repetitions, in reference to a single observation, and of deducing the best value from m repetitions, by making use of the readings of m-1, m- 2 m -3, &c., repetitions. (See BesRel on this subject.) The angles which enter the equations are supposed to have been rigidly deduced, similar to the supposition made for the values m, m', m," ...... of the first method, before they could enter the formulre. The shortest way of introducing weights (p) is by the ratio of unity to the square of the probable error (e0 .) The method of deducing the probable error of observation of horizontal angles will be found explained in another part of this report. Method B will be explained, first, without the introduction of weights, and, secondly, with the consideration of weights. It may be remarked that this method is almost exclusi':ely applied to secondary triangulations; both methods, A and B, being applied to prnnary surveys. To satisfy strirtly the demands of theory, the conditional equations subsisting between the rradings of the successive repetitions of any angle must be introduced simultaneously with the conditions imposed b~r the sum-angles at the station. This is analogous to the introduction of the conditions of method A or B, to those of the geometrical conditions of the figure of the triangulation, and can, with equal propriety, be disposed of in the same manner. The conuitions among the succeesive readings ... m--2, m-1, m, demand, therefore, no further attention. Let us now consider method B, without introducing weights, or supposing the angles as equally well measured. The application of the method of least squares to the case under consideration, is of such simplicity that the formulre can be given in connection with the example. According to the general theory, the steps to be followed successively arc, 1st, to obtain approximate values for the quantities sought, called. by Gerling the clements (E ;) 2d, to establish differ-

Having explained these two methods, we can proceed to the consicleration of the geometrical conditions of a triangulation. (C.) Adjustment of horizontal angles of a triangulation de:Pending on the geometrical conditi'.ons qf its figure. We will now proceed to the adjustment of the angles so far as they depend on the geometrical conditions of the scheme of triangles. This conKideration is the more important of the two. The Jmrt8 of a triangle being determined when the bm;e and two angles are known, any additional measur.e such as the third angle or a second side will furnish a condition, and when it is difficult to decide about the liest distribution of the error in the sum of the three angles in any single triangle, this difficulty greatly increases when we come to a combination of such. It is obvious that no two computors would arrive at the same result without the application of least Rquares, and that it would otherwise be impossible to correct the angleH in such a manner that any resulting side (the length of which we can obtain from different triangles) would have identical values. To the former imperfect and arbitrary mode of adjustment wc have no need to refer, sincr: the introduction of the method of least squares into geodesy. 'fhe problem reduces itself to the following: to deduce a system of corrections ( .6) to the observed quantities, (as already corrected by the method A or B,) the sum of the squares of which is a minimum, and which satisfy all conditions of the polygonic figure of the survey. Such conditions are, for instance, that the computed length of a base, when brought forward to the verification base, which we suppose measured with equal accuracy, should be of the same length with it ; that the sum of the angles in a triangle should equal two right-angles augmented by the F<pheroidal excess ; that the sum of the angles round a central station should close the horizon; and, finally, that any side computed from different series of angles should be found of equal length. The a hove conditions we can bring under the two cfas~es of angle and of side conditions, remarking merely that the first effects the closing of the triangles, and the second the intersection of all lines converging to a station. Before, however, proceeding with the explanation of the angle and side equations themselves, the notation used in the following exposition requires first to be stated. An angle may he considered as formed hy a difference of two directions ; hence the notation - ~ + ~ for the angle 1.2.3 (see Sketch No. 53, figure D) will easily be understood. Corrections to either direction will be inclucled in parenthesis: thus CD expresses a correction to ~ and - (k) the correction to the above angle; 1.2 and 3.2 signify the sides themselves. Another question arises in reference to the weight to be given to directions. If all signals appeared equally distinct, we should assign to the directions equal weight ; but considering that we have, by the treatment of the measures by either method (A or B ,) already assigned weights to directions, and, further, that by actual investigation of the appearance of the signals in this triangulation in connection with the conditions required to be satisfied, no result in favor of signals marked "well-defined, or distinct" was obtained, we need not introduce any different weights; which view is supported also by other c bservers. There is, however, one case when the observer uses different instruments ; the conditional equations will ~hen have to be ~ultipli~d into the square root of the weights. The weigh~s to be given to instruments of d1tferent size cannot further be punmed here, but may apprnx1-

mately be taken proportional to the diameter of the circle. Bessel gives an example for the relative weights of results by a repeating theodolite, and a non-repeating one taking single directions. 'l'he adjustment to he explained here belongs to that class which is called, by Gerling, adjustment of conditional observations of equal accuracy, and in its general application requires hut one additional operation to those stated when treating method B, which consists in the establishment of the equations of correlatives, (so called by Gauss.) We may therefore proceed at once to the ap1>lication. 1. Angle equations : The condition between the angles in any triangle is reatlily put in shape; and as the further treatment will be shown in connection with the side equations, it will be sufficient to establish the conditional equations in this place and to explain the formation of the equations of correlatives afterwards. Suppose we have given the measured spherical angles 2.1.3 = 41░ 58' 51".4 75 and the approximate latitude of the centre of gravity of the 1.3.2 53 53 55 11 .455 triangle, together with the approximate length of one of 3.2.1 84 07 18".089 its sides. Com1mtc the spherical excess (') by the well- a b sin (1 + e2 cos 2 L) - II known formula' 4 .140 for 8 5".0l9 2 R 2 sin 111 the above; and take the sum of the angles, the residual s - иwill be the numerical term in the equation. We haYe s - и = + 011 .879, and the condition2.1.3 - CD+ 0) + 1.3.2 - (D +CD+ 3.2.1 - 0) +CD = 180 + , subtract 2.1.3 + 1.3.2 3.2.1 = 180 s o= s - и + <D - 0) + CD + (1) which ifi the resulting angle equation. The closing of the horizon is effected similarly. 2. Sitle equations: The establishment of a side equation consists in finding the relation between the sides and angles of any polygon in the triangulation. In the following pentagon, (see Sketch No. 53, figure E,) for instance, we havek1 sin /3 1 = k 2 sin y 1 k 2 sin {12 = k3 sin y 2 k 3 sin {13 = k 4 sin y 3 k 4 sin fl,= k 5 sin y 4 k 5 sin f15 k 1 sin y 5 Hence, sin fJ1 sin /32 sin {33 sin {34 sin {15 = sin y 1 sin 'Y2 sin 'Y3 sin 'Y4 sin 'Y5 or, _ ~i~ 1 sin 'Y2 sin ')13 sin 'Y4 sin '>'s and s1~bst~tuting for the ratio of the sines that of the 1 - sin /31 sin p sin ;13 sin f34 sin fls' opposite sides, 2 1 2.1 3.1 4.1 5.1 6.1 b = 3.1 и 4.1 и 5.1 и 6.1 и 2.1' or as a ove.

and as soon as the corrections, (1.3.2) etc., become known, the log. sin [1.3.2 + (1.3.2)] can be formed. By substituting the approximate angles 1.3.2, etc., in the place of the true ones 1.3.2 + (1.3.2) etc., the numerical value of the first two lines equals the value of the third and fourth with the opposite sign. 'fhe coefficients of the unknown corrections are the logarithmic differences d 1 dwиииd' d".......... Another treatment by means of Taylor's theorem is far less convenient, and consequently requires no further illustration. (See Fischer's Geodesy, p. 73, vol. 3.) It may also. be remarked in this place, that when we ha-vc measured two base lines in a series of triangles, considering both as absolutely correct, we are led to a similar equation, but the absolute term 1 becomes~, b1 and b11 being the length of the base lines. For the above corrections, (1.3.2) etc., we write as usual - CD+ etc., antl then multiply each term by its respective d. It will be well to adhere to the above order of the notation of an angle, taking the left-hand number first, as it will facilitate the operation. Multiplying the first condition equation by Kn the second by K 2 , and so on, we form by summation the equations of correlatives. (See Gerling, p. 177.)

the coefficients for the normal equations result by summing up the numbers in each column. The numbr of angle equations next claims our attention, and snme caution is necessary in order not to repeat equatiorni ; for instance, in a quadrilateral, in which all angles are measured, we might easily be led to establish four angle equations, one for each closed triangle when there are but three, the fourth being a consequence of the others. The stations between which side equations consist may readily he recognised by their forming polygons or systems round a central point, includin~ it either with a triangle (the most simple case) or a polygon. Frequently the central pomt or pole, as, for instance, station Gunstock, of the primary triangulation, Section I, falls outside the figure, which, however, alters nothing in the above conclusions. Both kinds of figures have the following characteristic property. At every point three lines meet, save one, where p-1 meet, when the figure includes p stations. Complications arise from systems within systems, which case frequently occurs. In a given quadrilateral any one of the four stations may be taken for the pole, though it is more convenient to select that one where the three triangles meet, which furnish the angle equations. The figures (F) and (G) contain the smallest number of sides between which a side equatioиn is possible; their identity becomes apparent when we suppose the point m to fall inside the triangle n op. The side equations are equally true for plane and spherical angles. The following example is given for illustration of a case in which there is but one conditional equation. As usual, we express by a full line an observed direction, and by a broken line a concluded one. (See figure H.) Given the measured (and equated) angles0

It is remarked by Bessel, that difficulties are sometimes experienced in finding the exact number of angle and side equations; and in order to guard against either omissions or excesses-the former producing an imperfect adjustment, the latter an unnecessary laborit becomes of importance to establish formulre by which we can check this number. However, by following strictly the rule, to commence with the base and to add successively the several directions, establishing the angle as well as side equations, in the order in which they present themselves, the difficulty spoken of will almost disappear. By this process we re-produce the figure of the triangulation. A suitable selection may be made for the establishment of the side equations, and no other rule can be given except that of selecting for the pole such a station where few or no directions were observed, which will greatly diminish the labor. Great care must be taken to obtain, also, the correct number of terms in these equations. The least number of lines necessary to form a closed figure by connecting p points is p, and gives one angular condition: every additional line, which must nec~ssarily have been observed in two directions, furnishes a condition; hence, a ~ystem of l lines between p points, gives l -p 1 angle equations; where, it must be borne in mind that each of the l lines must have a forward and backward sight. When, in any system, the first two points are determined in reference to one another hy the measurement of the line joining, then the determination of the position of any additional station requires two sides, or necessarily two directions; hence, in any system of triangles between p points, we have to determine p - 2 points, which require 2 (p - 2) directions, and by adding the first 2 p - 3. Consequently, in a system of l sides, Z- 2 p 3 sides appear supernumerary, and give an equal number of side equations. One direction for each suffices for this purpose. If it should happen that each side was observed in. two directions, the total number of condi1 4. The limits of l are 2 p - 3, and P (p - ). tional equations would amount to 2 l - 3 p 2 The treatment of conditions between linear measures, and between linear measures in connection with angular measures, is excluded in accordance with the plan of this paper. There are two investigations, however, which we cannot pass without at least a slight notice; they are, the accuracy of the derived (equated) values for each of Gerling's three principal divisions of direct, of indirect, and of conditional observations, and the adjustment of the ahgle11, in a system in which certain quantities are conaidered as absolutely correct,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

(their 6. 's become zero;) this case is of frequent occurrence when we come to adjust secondary measures, or systems where the primary measures must remain unaltered, by the ad,iustment of the secondary system. This latter process may be called that of secondary adjustment. An exposition of the formulro for accuracy of results will be found in Gerling's admirable work, and the secondary adjustment can be accomplished with the knowledge of the preceding metbod. The number of normal equations, equal to the number of conditions in the figure of a triangulation, becomes formidable.in any extensive or complete scheme of triangles. In that part of the primary triangulation in Section I, bounded by the lines Cuttyhunk, Indian, in the south, and by Mount Pleasant, Mount Independence, in the north, the number of equations to be solved is 65, containing as many unknown quantities. Gauss has furnished us with the means of completing an adjustment of such magnitude, in his method of indirect elimination, and in this theorem of the compemmtio imperfecta seu manca, of which, however, this is not the place for further explanation. Without this assistance, such a work as the complete adjustment of the triangulation in Section I could not be accomplished. . For those who desire further information on the general theory of the method of least squares, and on the application of it to the operations of geodesy, the following works may be referred to: Gauss, Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium, 1809; Theoria Combinationis Observation um Erroribus Minimis Obnoxire, 1823; and Supplementum Theorire Combinationis, etc., by Gau!ls, 1826 ; Legendre, N ouvelles Methodes pour la Determination des Orbites des Cometes, Paris, 1806,; Bessel's Gradmessung in Ostpreussen, 1838; Rosenberger's paper in the Astronomische :Xachrichten, Nos. 121and122, (1827 ;) and Bessel's paper in No. 438, ibid. (1841.) Application of the method to a portion of the ordnance survey of England, by Th. Galloway, 1843, in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, volume XV, 1846; Ch. L. Gerling, die Au&gleichungs-Rechnungen der practischen Geometrie, Hamburg and Gotha, 1843; J. J. Baeyer's Kustenvermessung, 1849; Enke on the method of least squares, in the Berliner Jahrbuch, 1834, 1835,1836, and 1853.

1. Probable error of observation derived from observations of horizontal angles at any single station, and depending on directions. (Method A of reduction.)
The measures having been treated by the method of least squares, the mode adopted for finding the probable error of observation was as follows: The resulting corrections, A, B, C, D, etc., to the assumed directions, were applied with the opposite sign to the quantities in each respective column of the abstract of diminished measures. These corrections usually amount to but a few tenths of a second, and may in many cases be neglected; this, however, was not done in the following computation, the assumed angles not being considered close enough. In the abstract of remaining differences, thus formed, the readings of each direction were compared with the mean reading of their series, which process fornished the remaining errors ( !:::. ). The squares of these errors for each station, and forming a set containing an equal number of directions (n) were then summed up, and the several results formed.

For the method of deducing this probable error a short explanation will suffice. The resulting measures for each angle has been compared with its respective mean value.

APPENDIX No. 34.
Extracf8 from t!ze abstract of reports made in 1854 by Capt a Бn T.

J. Cram, Gorps of Topographical Engineers, assistant Unиited States Coast Survey, in charge of a ~econdary triangulation party.

In this abstract, of course, it wiU not be attempted to g-o any further into the details of the field-work, for obtaining the data for the results herein reported, than will be necessary to lead the mind to a proper understanding of the main t~atnres of the general report, consisting of four parts, from which this abstract has been compiled. In my secondary triangulations in the States of .Maine and New Hampshire, it became necessary to determine the heights above the mean level of the sea of the Yarious stations established for the survev. Indeed, without the vertical ordinates of the points of a survey, it cannot be regarded complete. It is well known that there are four methods, all irnl'epcndent of each other, for obtaining the heights of a points" above another points' upon the earth's surface: I. By levelling with the levelling instrument from s' to s''. II. By measuring with a theodolite, or any other suitable instrument, planted at r!, the angle of elevation of s", or its zenith di~tance; and knowing the distance from s' to s'' with that angle and this <listance, we com1mte the height of r!' above r! by means of forrnulru constructed for the purpose. Ill. By the barometer and thermometer used at both stations s' aml s'', and computing bY a formula the difference of elevation. иIV. By observing the boiling-point of water and the temperature of the air at the two stations, s1 an<l 8'', and from these observations com1rnting by a formula the difference of elevation of s' and s''. By authority and under the direction of the Superintendent of the U. S. Coast Survey, I liaYe, in connection with my secondary triangulations, put all four of these methods in requisition, to a very great extent, having conducted my observations in such a manner as to gi,,e what are denominated "simultaneous results;'' so that a result obtained by either of the four methods may be fairly compare<l with the results obtained by the other three methods. In this consists one of the several peculiar merits of the plan I have followed in my olJ~errn tions.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

In order to render what is here meant a little plainer than words alone can well do, I illustrate by the following simple diagram:

1. I have levelled direct and reversed, as explained in Part I of my report, so as to avoid errors due to terrestrial refraction between s' and r!', and obtained the difference of level of s' and t!', which I will here represent by ............... di. 2. ''Tith a first-rate repeating theodolite stationed at s1, and another stationed at 8 1 , the reciprocal zenith distances a', a", have been measured with these zenith distances and the known distance (horizontal or otherwise) between s' and s". I have computed, by the existing formulm, the height of s" aboves', which I will designate by ............... di'. 3. PreciRely at the same minute of measuring the zenith distances aforesaid, I have had taken (with a llouble set of standard barometers and thermometers, of the most approved form, especially constructed for the occasion) the usual barometric observations at s' and s", and with theRe observations, and by the barometric formula, I have computed the difference of elevation betweens' ands'', which I will designate by ............... drn. 5. Precisely at the snmc minute of measuring the zenith distances and taking the barometrical observations aforesaid at s' and 8 11 , with a double set of boiling-point apparatus, of the most approved form, I have had the boiling-point of water and the temperature of the atmosphere observed, and from these, with the formula and tables applicable to this method, I have computed the difference in elevation of s' ands'', which I will designate bv ............... diи. иBy these four methods, and in the manner now explained, I have applied the instruments to many cases in the field, during two seasons, and have taken especial }Jains, sparing no labor or personal fatigue, to select such examples as would give results of practical utility in furthering the objects of the survey on which I have been engaged, and likewise of service in the general problem of determining the vertical ordinate of any point on the earth's surface. The summit of Mount Washington having been observed upon in the primary triangulation, I have carried my observations to its very summit, in the manner I have explained for the levelling instrument, the barometer, and the boiling-point. I divided the whole elevation of that mountain into steps of five hundred feet difference in elevation, thus forming twelve benches or stations at which I have conducted my simultaneous observations. The examples afforded by these benches, and many others selected among the numerous Coast Survey stations I have established and occupied with instruments in the seasons I have l)een engaged on the Coast Survey, will all be given in Part I, Part III, and Part IV,_ of the general report which I have rendered to the Superintendent, and in Part II, wlnch I have not yet rendered, but which is in progress.

In my general report I have, among other things, especially aimed at attaining to a u1easuren1ent of these errors, and then to point out the sources of these errors, and to

suggest what may be done to avoid or to correct them, so that the results obtained by the methods of which di\ diii, div, arc the exponents, may be made to correspond more nearly with the results d; giYen by the levelling instrument, the method by this ill8trument being regarded as the standard. I. Sources of errors in the existing published formula>. for determining d;;_ Of these formula?, at present, two will be considered-the French and the Prussian. The first is adoptecl in Capt. Lee's Collection of Formulre and 'l'ables, puhfahcd by the Bureau of Topographical Engineers. The Prussian has been translated by Mr. Schott for the Coast Survey, and put into my hands for trial. I have shown, in Part II of my report, that there is an assumption made in the construction of the French formula that militates against a well-known and rer:ognisecl geodetic principle. This assumption is alone sufficient to entitle that formula to be regarded as of little merit for purposes where accuracy is required. Again, in the same collection of tables, published by the Bureau of Topographical Engineers, there is one purporting to be from Lieut. Frome, of the British scrYice, for correcting for the effect of terrestrial refraction. In this tahle, it is assumed that this effect has always the same sign for all distances, heights, &c.; and in Gummere's surveying, thf' idea is inculcated that the effect is generally to apparently elevate the signal ol,servcd on, or to diminish the zenith distance. Now, I have proved beyond cavil, in my experience, that neither of these assum1,tions is in accordance with the truth. In the Prussian formula it is assumed, that by obseniug simultaneou:-ly the reciprocal zenith distances a', a" (see Figure) and placing these in the formula, the effect of refraction, as it enters a', will cancel the effect as it enters a'' ; and this same idea is entcrtainecl in the French formula. Now 1 have shown, in Part II, that this is tantamount to supposing that, in observing at s1 upon s", the amount of tlic refraction is the same, and of the same sign as observing at s" upon s'. This is an assumption which I prove, by my experience, to be erroneou8. Again, in the French and Prussian formulm, a quantity enters by the name of "coefficient of refraction," and its value is given for different seaRons a8 applicable to the atmosphere of .France and Prussia. But if applicable to those climates, it will not serve, as determined by those formulre, as a coefficient applicable to our Atlantic coast east of Massachusetts. I have shown, that if we use the Prussian formula for that iiortion of our coast, we must adopt a very different value for this element in the computation of di'. Having pointed out all I intend at present in reference to the sources of error in dii, I will exhibit the amounts of the errors in d'\ computed by the Prussian formula, for a few of my cases, in the following tabular form: Heights d\ given by the levelling instrument. Same heights dii, by theodolite zenith distances, using the Prussian formufa with Ca11t. Cram' s coefficient of refraction, and this formula with the Prussian coefficient of refraction.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

tained in Part II, wherein I have recorded a very great number of these measurements, made with "Teat labor. not onlv in the field but likewise in the office. I have constructed a general for~ula, appli-calile in 'any case that occurs on the coast survey, for determining the amount and the sil!:n of the an~le of refraction, so that, having it, we can correct the observed zenith distance, and make it such as would have been observed were ther~ no such cause existing_ Of course, in making an abstract, it would be out of pla?e to msert all these nnmero-ns mea~urements, with the simultaneous measures of the density and tem~e rature of the atmosphere. To give an insight, however, into the plan ~ hrn:e adoi:ted tor the angle of refraction, I a1mtract the accompanying table. The negative ~1gn before the "angle of refraction" expresses that refraction apparently depressed. the signal observed u1ion, and the positive sign indicates that it apparently elevated the signal. . The true zenith distance o-iven in the table is that which would have been observed if unaffected by refraction. The ~ngle E, seen in the table, has a signification not necessary to be explaine<l here. but it is fullv explained in Part IL The case I take 'is one of reciprocal simultaneous observations of zenith distances.

From this table, giving the angle of refraction, we see how erroneous is the assumption, that the refraction in one zenith distance will cancel that in the other, when we come to compute the height by the Prussian, or indeed by any formula known. It is evident, however, that by obtaining the amount and sign of the angle of refraction, we can free the observed zenith distance from its effect, and then, by a formula properly constructed, we could compute the height free from errors incident to refraction. Such a formn!a I have constructed, and presented in very convenient shape in Part II. The formula 11' enti.rcly original with me, and I have the satisfaction, after a vast deal of labor spent upon it, of he1 ieving it is, in connexion with the plan of using the angle of refraction, fa! bett?r calcul~ted to i-i:ive in agreement with di than any formula known. In connexion with .this! ha~l mtended to arrange my numerous tables of the angle of refraction in proper classificat10n, m reference .to distance, difference of elevation, Reasonи of the year, hour of the day, topograi;hy, density of the atmosphere, temperature, &c., &c., and thus to present to the Supenntenclent of the Coast Survey, for future use in the work under his charge, what ~ regard as an ~nequalled formula, with its appropriate tables in exteriso-;-purely American-for geodet1cally determining the heights of the Coast Survey stat10ns, or

indeed any point on the earth's surface, so that the result will be the same, or exceedingly near the same, as would have been obtained by the levelling instrument. I have the data all reduced to standard values for ten caseR of the angle of refraction, in the Bame vertical plane, so selected that the visual ray from instrument -to instrument occupies all directions under a fixed line in the atmosphere; alHo the data for a great variety of cases, where the instrument is placed at different elevations a bow the sea, to observe across the sea, and this at low tide, high tide, mean ebb, and mean flood; also numerous cases of observing over a sand and pebble beach, at various given stages of tide; likewise a very large number of cases of observing in different vertical planes upon the same signal, and upon different signals; also cases of observing along and near to the sea-side, and then in directions perpendicular thereto; likewise cases of observing over ground when dry, and the same ground when covered at highest stages of water, &c., &c. For each and all these, the original plan on which I commenced this work was, to obtain the angle of refraction and tabulate, as shown in the example herewith submitted; all this and more, of practical use for the Coast Survey, I had intended to present in Part II of my re11ort. II. Sources of error in the existing published formulro for determining dm. This, it will he remembered, involves the consideration of thP determination of heights by the barometer. The results of many of my measurements of the errors in di'' are given in Part III of my report rendered to the Superintendent. I abstract what is seen in the accompanying tables, to exhibit the amounts of these errors, in a few cases taken from each of the four methods explained in Part III, of combining the obserrntions. Heights di, by levelling instrument, used as explained in Part I of my report. Same heights di\ by barometer; first method by two barometers simultaneouslr at the two stations, as explained in Part III of my report.

It is clearly proven, by the numerous results I have oMained by taking my B. M. for s', at different elevations, from mean tide to over fi,000 feet above it, that the constants in the barome~ric formula now in use need to 1Je modified. In other words, the constant that will answer m the formula for measuringиdifferences of elevation, whens' ands" are both near the level of the sea, will not answer when s' and s'' are higher up in the atmosphere. For example, sup1rnse s'' the summit of Mount Washington, ands' the B. M. 500 feet below the summit; for this 500 feet difference in elevation so high up in the atmosphere, there needs to be a different constant than for an equal difference of elevation near the base of the mountain. _ One of the ends I had in view in being so particular in establishing my B. l\L 's on the s1c1e ~f Mount Washington, was for the very purpose (in connection with what will be explamed in Part II) of determining more befitting values of the constant in the barometric formula., 'l'hen, and not until then, can we expect to reduce tht errors that we now find so con~p1~uously vervading dm. In my opinion, it is in this ,constant that we must look for the prrnc1pal source of the errors in dm, and not in the construction of the instrument. I mtend.ed to construct a table of corrections to apply to the const~nt, according as we are oliscrnng at the top and bottom of a height more or l~s elevated m the atmosphere.

we use the usual form of the Fahrenheit thermometer for noting the degree of the boilingpoint ; the "thermometric method," as ex11lained in Part IV, using the formula of Dubuat and the tables published by~Regnault for this purpose; and that when div is determined by using Wurdemann's apparatus, giving the height of the boiling-point on a scale of barometric equivalents, and then using the formula for the lmrometer, as explained Part IV, I call it the "thermo-barometric method." Dubuat's formula is constructed upon the plan, that, obsening lJy an F. thermometer the tcm1Jcrature at which water boils, we can compute, from his formula, the equiYalent height of the mercury which a barometer would have indicated at the same time and station. Regnault, in his table, assumes that, by noting the temperature by a C. thermometer at which the water boils, his table will also give the simultaneous height that would have been shown by the barometer at the same place. This table has been ada1Jted to the F. thermometer, and introduced into tho publication, by the Bureau of Topographical Engineers, as Table XXIII. Atи s' ands" I have, in a great many cases, used the barometer simultaneously with noting the boiling-point, and the following tables show the results :

Three thermometers were made by Mr. VTiirdemann, of Washington, for observations of the boiling-point, from which the foregoing results have been derived. It is now apparent that either Table XXIII, derived from that of M. Regnanlt, is grossly in error, or that such thermometers as were made by Mr. Wiirdemann especially for the purpose are entirely inadequate to indicate the proper boiling-point, or both causes may exist to vitiate the results. I now pass to the consideration of the "Thermo-Barometer." This is a form given to the thermometer for the purpose of determining the boiling-point that shall at once give the equivalent weight of the atmosphere, as would be had by the barometer in inches instead of degrees of temperature, superseding the necessity of a reduction by a formula like that of Dubuat, or a table like that of Regnault. This instrument iR folly described, with a drawing, in Part IV of my report. The boiling apparatus made by Mr. \Vurdemann was provided with three of these, which, in their scales, partake of the barometer scale, and in their bulbs an,d stems containing the mercury, partake of the thermometer. It is for these reasons I denominate them "Thermo-Barometers." I have used these quite extensively at s' and s'', for a great many caseA simultaneously with the barometer. These are all recorded in Part IV, from which I abstract a few in order to show the comparison of results and the degree of reliance to be put in this instrument. In the table I shall introduce the height determined simultaneously with the barometer, in order to bring the results given by the "Thermo-Barometer" boiling-point, by the liarometer, and by tbe levelling instrument, into juxtaposition-that is, we shall have dii, dii', and div compared, and the errors in each case with their signs.

By inspecting the foregoing table, it will at once be seen that tl1e results given by the barometer, however erratic they may seem, wandn lesR from those by the levelling instrument than do the results giyen by the therrno-lJaromctric uoiling-point apparatus. VVhatever errors in am maY be attributed to the cumtant in the barometric formula. will likewi8e be found in the resultR d;V, as t.11 i~ form nla iR mPd for hotl1 instruments. и But there arc other causes-the defocts inherent in the essential parts of the "ThermoBarometer" -which must be remedied by the manufacturer Lefore it can be brought into successful competition ~witl1 the harom0ter. I refoT to tl1e mercury with which the thermobarometer is filled; the glass of which the hulhi; and stems arc made; the metallic scales. During the act of heating to boiling-point at one station, 1!1 , theFe three partH expand; and on cooling, do they return to the Rame condition as before; I am satisfied this question must be answered in the negative for the apparatus made by lUr. "\Yiirdemann which I used, not only in respect to thermometers A, B, C, but likewise in reference to thermo-Larometers No. 1, No. 2, No. :3. TheTe is a want of uniformity in the expansion and contraction of each of the substances, which the observer cannot remedy, but which I find to exist in the use of the instrument, and which is, and, unless a remedy be applied, must continue to be, the cause of great discrepancies. To one 1w1uainted w_ith the laws of expansion and contraction, it is only necessary to hint the fact to ena1Jle him at once to realize the force of this objection to the boiling-point apparatus, as one to greatly impair confidence in its capacity to give results at all to be relied on, whoever may be the instrument maker. I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient serYant,

APPENDIX No. 35.

De,<;cription of tlze UnБfed States Coa.~f Survey apparatus/or measun'.ng base lines. By Lieut. E. B. Hunt, U. S. A., and a..ssistant United States Coast Survey, (Sketch Ko. 54.) Communicated to the .American Associationfor the Advancement of Scicn-ce, by authority of the Treasury Department.
In conducting a trigonometrical survey, each connected scheme or system of triangulation involves the lineal measurement of a base line, besides the angular measurement of the vertical and horiz.~mtal angles special to each triangulation station, and the astronomical determinations orlatitudes, longitudes, and azimuths. As angular measures can be repeated with great facility, a high accuracy is always attainable with portable mstruments, arranged so as to permit the free use of the principle of repetitions. Hut linear measurements consume so much time, and are so costly, that it is only to a limited extent practicable to repeat extended base line measures, 1nwh as those executed in geodetic operations. Hen?e the apparatus for base measurements requires to be sufficiently perfoct to insure, if possible, from a single measurement, a degree of accuracy corresponding with that resulting from the numerous repetitions of observations by the angle instruments employed. As the ~p~aratns length enters a great number of times in a base line, any error of the apparatus is hkely to enter the total base length in a highly magnified form, as also an error of the base length will, in exact proportion, affect the general geodetic results. As the elements of the_ earth's figure and magnitude are entirely deduced from the several triangulations executed, and as a very minute accuracy of these elements is essential to the discussion of station errors and local actions it follows that anv serious imperfection of the base apparatus W:ill gr~atly diminish the' general geodetic yиalue of the results and the scope oj' the l~cal d1s~uss1ons. For ~hel!'e reasons the requisition for extreme accuracy is eminently rigorous 11_1 the construct10n of a geodetic hase apparatus. The Umted States Coast Survey extends alon"' the entire Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific seaboard of our country, and is limited to the na~rowest belt which will suffice for the due location of the primary triangles. For this reason, as also to promote the accuracy and

104*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

facility of itA results, our coast has been, Rince 1844-, progressively distributed into eleven sections, (nine on the Atlantic and Gulf, and two on the Pacific,) in each of which the triangulation proceeds separately, starting from its own 1msc, and, by its connections with the anjoining triangulations, giving and deriving a verification of all prior operations. In two or three of these sections it is almost certain that extra bases will be found necessarv or advantageous, as, in flat, heavily-wooded countries, the primary triangles must be small and numerous, so that accuracy will require some additional bases. Thus it will be seen that vertainly eleven, and probably fourteen or more, bases will ultimately have to he measured with the utmost accuracy, as part of the Coast Survey operations. As each of these will be from five to ten miles long, the total length of Coast Survey base line required will approach near to a hundred miles. Hence it is evident, that even for economical reasons, the apparatus employed should be as portable and every way as convenient for field use as possible, consistently with its accurate working. The main essentials for a base-measuring apparatus are embraced in the following general conditions: I. The extreme points of the apparatus used as measuring limits must, under all circmnstanccs of operation, remain at an invariable distance from each other, or the corrections for variations in this distance must be capable of easy a.id accurate determination. II. The distance between the measuring limits must be cQmpared with the standard unit of length to the last degree of attainable accuracy, and its precise length so determined. III. In the apparatus, the necessary imrts and constructions for its easy and safe transportation, firm support, accurate contacts or coincidences, for slope measurements, and also all req_uisite auxiliaries to the several adjustment manipulations, must be so provided and combined as to give the whole a union of portability, convenience, and delicacy. The Coast Survey apparatus, as it now stands, was devised with special regard to all the conditions for extreme accuracy and convenience in the field. Some slight modifications, indicated by experience in its use during the measurement of three base lines, have since been embodied; but, in the main, the apparatus remains unaltered from the plans devise<! by Professor Bache in 1845, and executed, under his direction, in 1845 and 1846, by Mr. иwm. vViirdemann, then mechanician of the Coast Survey, to whom many of the details of arrangement are due. It may here be stated, that the experience.of three base-line measurementR with this apparatuR, has fully shown it to be a highly satisfactory solution of the problem proposed, and it has been found to excel alike in accuracy, economy, and facility of use. A base-line being duly reconnoitred, opened, and graded, and monuments being :fixed for the permanent 11reservation of its extremities, or the base station points, the measurement proper proceeds. The apparatus sent to the field for this purpose, when a primary base is to be finally measured, consists of the following parts: 1. 'fwo measuring tubes exactly alike, each being packed for transportation in a wooden box. 2. Six trestles for supporting and adjusting the tubes, three being fore-trestles and till!rec rear-trestles, each of which is packed for transportation in a three-sided wooden box. 3. Eight or more iron foot-plates on which to support the trestles; and a wooden frame is afterwards made, to serve as a guide in laying down the foot-plates. 4. Manipulating handles for the adjustments; a theodolite for making the alignment, and for occasionally referring the tube end to stakes driven for the purpose; also some minor auxiliaries. 5. A standard six-metre bar of iron, in its wooden case, arranged for comparisons, and a Saxton's pyrometer, arranged for indicating minute variations in length. The measuring-tubes are carefully compared with the standard-bar before beginning the measurement, and again after its completion, to make sure of the exact cond1tion of the somewhat complex mechanism in the measuring-tubes. For these field-comparisons the pyron_ieter is simplified, by causing the bar or tube undergoing comparison, to abut against the !iphen~al head of an arm, springing horizontally from the vertical axle, to which is attached the .m1.rror for reflecting the remote arc-graduations into the telescope fixed on this arc. Van.atio;is or inequalities of the bars examined act on the arm, and thus tum the mirror, causmg it to reflect the corresponding arc-reading into the telescope. A spring is so arranged .as to make the arm-bead press with a constant pressure against the bar-end. When the c01~parison with the standard is completed, the foot-plates are successively placed, by the aid of the wooden spacing frame, which gives an approximate distance and alignment. Four trestles are so placed and levelled on these plates, that the three foot-

"crews of each rest in three radial p;rooves of the ]ilates. The two tubes are then mounted on their trestles, and the rear extremity having been adjusted vertically over t11e stationpoint, the fore-tube is then adjustetl to make a contact with the rcar-tnbe extremity liy means of a level of contact. Both tnlies have to be first alig-ned hy tl1e aid of a theodolite advanced some distance on the line, or following the measurement, in the field of which two standing sights, one on each tube, are made to cover. rrhc placing of plates proceeds aR fast as is necessary for keeping work al wayR provided for the tubes, and the extra tn>stles being duly placed and approximately adjusted, the rear-tube is carried forward in place, and the adjustments executed. Thus the components of the ap11aratus are carried from rear to front, in a determined order; arnl the measuring nperationH consist in the preparation for, and execution of, these progressive transfers, in effecting the morn delicate adjustments, and in making a full record of all the essential circumstances. Points marked on copper nails in the heads of well-driven stakes, usually indicate temporarily the end of each day's work, and great care is taken permanently to secure the precise extremity, or base-station point, from all disturbance. From this synopsis of the general character and mode of using the CoaHt Survey base apparatus, a ready and intelligent transition to the details of its composition and construction can now be made. \Vhile many minute arrangements and parts of this apparatus must here be unnoticed, I will endeavor to iwesent a satisfactory summary, such a:; will cnalJle the members of this association to inspect, with all neceRsary insight, the apparntus itself, which is now open to their examination at the Coast SurYey office. 'l'he tul1e is a spar-shaped double casing, .Fig. 1, designed especially to embrace ancl protect the trusses which support and stiffen the system of bars on which the 11etual mrnRlUCment depends. Its length is nearly six metres, or alwut twenty feet. The length of any Rimple bar of iron, or other metal, is so much aflected by variations of its temperature a,; to make it necessary, where such bars are used for base measurements, constantly to observe and COI'I'ect for the temperature, the formula for correction being derived from previous experiments. But changes of temperature cannot, in this case, be exactly determined so as to know, at a given moment, the precise condition of the bar undergoing change; hence the temperature correction is always uncertain in its value, besides causing much extra labor in observing and reducing. This makes apparent the importance of an arrangement, the limiting points of which will always be found at a constant distance apart under all field-circumstances of temperature. No single material can give this exemption from expansions and contractions. It is found, however, in a combination of two metals having different rates of expansion, and hence admitting a resort to the principle of compensation, illustrated in the gridiron or compensating clock pendulum. This principle was independently applied to the construction of base apparatus, composed of two bars, one of brass and one of' iron, connected by a lever of compensation at their ends, first by Colonel Colby, in the Ordnance Survey of Ireland in 1827; (see Captain Yolland's Lough Foyle Base, p. 10;) and again l1y Mr. Borden, of Fall River, in the Massachusetts Survey, during the winter of 1830. (See Palfrey's Tables, Survey of .Mass., p. 1; Am. Phil. Trans., vol. IX, p. 34; andN. Am. Rev., Oct., 1845, :pp. 4ii8-4-61.) Mr. Borden made no provision for causing the two bars in his apparatus to change their temperatures at the same rate, though his tin tubular arrangement admirably checks the frequency and rapidity of such changes as, in practice, they must undergo. Colonel Colby attempted, by the aid of varnishes and lampblack coatings, as :fixed by numerous ex1)eriments in 1827, to ruake both bars maintain the same temperature during the changes of surrounding heat. He made both bars of the same cross-section, and thought, by regulating the surface radiation and absorption, to effect the required equalization of rate for heating and cooling. His method, though giving a good approximation, is radically faulty, in not taking the specific heats and conducting powers of the bars into the account. The method :first introduced amd originated by Professor Bache, is capable of insuring a very perfect equalization of temperature in the two bars. By numerous experiments, in 1845 and '46, he so arranged the cross-sections of the bars, as that while the two have equal absorbing surface, their masses are inversely as their specific heats, allowance J.ieing made for their different conducting powers. Thus, while each receives the same accession of heat in a given time, the temperature of the two will continue equal, because, except for the conducting-rates, their masses are inversely as their specific heats. The same varnish on both surfaces gives them equal absorbent powers, The last minute adjustment of compensation was effocte<l by 14и

making one surface slightly more absorlwnt than the other, as required hy circumstances. Thus, as both bars vary essentially together, the point of compensation is never shifted by their diverse actions under thermal variations. A bar of brass and a bar of iron, each less than six metres long, are supported parallel to each other, and at one end are so firmly connected together by means of an end-block, in which each bar is mortised and strongly screwed, as there to preserve an unalterable relation. The brass bar, which has the largest cross-section, is sustained on rollers, mounted in 1rnspending stirrups, and the iron bar rests on small rollers, which are fastened to the iron bar, and run on the brass one. Supporting screws through the sides of the stirrups arc atljusted to sustain the bars in place, and also serve to rectify them. Thus, while the two bars arc relatively fixed at one end, they are elsewhere free to move, and hence the entire expansions and contractions are manifested at the free end. The medium of connection between the free ends of the two bars is the lever of compensation, which is joined to tlte lower or brnss bar by a hinge-11in, around which it turns during changes of tem7>erature. A steel plane on the encl of the iron bar abuts against an agate knife-edge on the inner side of the lever of compensation. This lever terminates in a knife-edge, turned outward at such a distance from the centre pin and the other knife-edge bearing, that the end edge will remain unmoved by e<pml changes of temperature in the two bars. The end edge presses against a steel face in a loop made in the sliding rod. This rod slides in a frame fastened to the top of the iron bar, and passes tluough a spiral spring which acts with a constant force to press the loop against the knife-edge. The outer end of the sliuing rod bears the limiting agate plane. Thus the end agate is not effected in position l>y the expansions of the brass and iron, actin~ as they do at proportional distances along the lever of corn1)ensation, measured from its sliding-end bearing. The rates of expansion for iron and brass may safely be taken as uniform, between the extreme expansions and contractions to which they are subject in practice, and the compensating adjustment once made is permanent. The stirrups s11staining the rollers on which the brass bar runs, are made fast to the main horizontal sheet of the iron supporting and stiffening work. This consists of a horizontal and a vertical plate of boiler-iron, joined along the middle line of the horizontal sheet by two angle irons, all being permanently riveted. Circular openings are cut out from both plates to lighten them as much as practicable. A continuous iron tie-plate, turned up in a trough-form, connects the bottoms of all the stirrups. At the ends, stiffening braces connect the two plates. We now pass from the comjrnnsating to the sector end of the tube, at which extremity are arranged the parts giving the readings, and for adjusting the contacts between successive tubeR in measuring, thus making it the station of the Jll'incipal observer. The sector end terminat.1:~s in a sliding rod, which slides through two upright bars, and at its outer encl hears a blunt agate knife-edge, horizontally arranged, which in measuring is brought to abut with a uniform pressure against the limiting agate plane of the compensating end of the previous tube. At its inner end this sliding rod rests against a cylindrical surface on the upright lever qf contact, so mounted as at its bottom to turn around a hinge pin. At top this lever rests against a tongue or drop lever descending from the middle of the level of contact, which is mounted on trunnions. The sliding rod, when forced against the side of the lever of contact, presses its top against the tongue of the level, and thus turns the level hr overcoming 11 preponderance of weight given to its farther end to insure the contact ?e1ng alw!1ys at a constant pressure between the agates, the same force being always requned to brrng the bubble to the centre . . 'l~he sector is a solid metal plate, mounted with its centre of motion in the line of the shdrng :od, and having its arc graduated from a central zero to the limits of ascending and desce~1drn~ slopes on which the apparatus is to be used. A :fixed vernier in contact with the arc gives the Rlope readings. A long level and bubble scale are so attached and adjusted to the face of the sector plate, that the zeros of the level an<l of the limb correspond to the h~rizontal po_s~tion of the whole tube. If, then, on slopes, the bubble be brought to the middle by ra1s1~g or lowering the arc end of the sector, (a movement made by a tangent i;crew, who~e milled head projects above the tin case of the tube,) the vernier will give the t1lopc at which the tube is inclined, and the sloping measure is readily reduced to the horizontal by means of a table prepared for the purpose. The level of contact and the lever of contact, with their appendages, are all mounted on the sector and partake of its motions.

A knife-edge end of the sliding rod presses on the cylindrical face of the con tact lever, this cylinder being concentric with the sector, and the sector can therefore be turned without deranging the contact. In fact, the contacts arc made with the sector level horizontal, tlrnR insuring the accuracy of tbe contact pressure. The contact lever is supported at bottom hy two braces dropping down from the sector plate, and a spring, acting on a pin in the lever, steadies it against an adjusting screw end. A bracket from the sector plate receives the trunnions of the contact level. A small screw projects from the end of the tube to damp or set the lever and level of contact against a pin in the sector for security in transportation. What is called the fine motion, required for adjusting the contacts between the successive tu hes, is produced by means of a compensating rod or tube, one end of which is attached to the truss frame by a bracket over the rear trestle, and the other receives a screw terminating in a projecting milled head. This screw turns freely in a collar, bearing, hy a projecting arm, against the cross-bar which joins the main brass and iron bars, and its nut is in the end of the compensation rod. By turning the screw in one direction the bars arc pushed forward, and the opposite turning l1ermits a spiral spring, arranged for the purpose, to push back the system of bars, which slides through its supports. Thus the contact is made, by turning the screw until the contact level is horizontal. The compensating rod is composed of several concentric tubes, alternately of brass and iron, arranged one within the other, and fastened at opposite ends alternately. Thus when a contact haR been made by the fine motion screw, changes of tern1lerature will not produce derangement, as would lie the case if this rod were not compensating. The arrangement permits the oliserver conveniently to work the fine-motion screw, and to observe its action on the contact level. The apparatus thus described is enclosed in a double tin tubular case, diaphragml'l being adapted for supporting and strengthening the whole. The air chamber between the two cases, 1~ inches apart, is a great check on heat variations. Three side openings, with tin and glass doors in each tube, permit observations of the 1mrts and of inserted thermometers. The ends are closed, only the sliding-rod ends projecting at each extremity, exposing the agates. Brass guard-tubes protect these, and for transportation tin conical caps arc screwed on the tube ends. The fine-motion screw, the sector-tangent screw, and the contact lever-clamp screw, project lleyond the case. The tulic is painted 'vhitc, which, with the air-chamber and thorough-compensation, effectually obviate all need of a screen from the sunshine, which has usually been deemed requisite. The tube rests on a fore-trestle and rear trestle, which are alike, except in the heads. Each trestle has three legs, composed of one iron cylinder, moving in another by meami of a rack, pinion and crank, so as to raise or sink the head plate. The levelling and finer adjustment is by means of a foot-screw in each leg, by working which a circular level on the connecting frame is adjusted. A large axis screw, resting on the connecting frame, and rising into a tubular nut, is turned by bevelled pinions worked by a crank, and thus raises or lowers this tubular nut, and the cap piece which it sup1JOrts at top. The axis-screw, the leg-racks, and the foot-screws, give three vertical movements in the trestle, by which its capacity for slope measurements is much amplified. In the cap of the rear trestle a lateral and a longitudinal motion are provided for, by means of two tablets arranged to slide, the upper one longitudinally on the lower one, and the lower laterally on the head plate of the axis-screw tube. Long adjusting screw handles extend to the observer's stand from these two plates, and from the axis-screw enabling him to raise or lower, to slide forward or back, to the right or the left, the rear end of the tube The fore-trestle is similar, except that its head is only arranged for a lateral movement, and a second observer makes its adjustments by a simple crank. Four men can carry a tube, by levers passed through staples in blocks, strapped under the tubes. The principal observer, and an assistant, make the contacts and rectifications, the :first assistant directs the forward tube, and another preserves the alignment with a theodolite. A careful recorder notes down the observations, and an intelligent aid places the trestles and foot-plates. The labor of grading, especially in level sand-lines, is quite trifling. The first bas~ line measured with the apparatus now described was the Dauphinc Isla1?"d base, near Mobile, and about seven miles long, which was measured by Professor Bache m 1847. (Coast Survey Report 1847, p. 39.) The party was on the ground six wecb, between April 30th and June 12th, though only 17 working days were consumed iu the final

measurement. The greatest day's work was 183 tnhes, or near senn-tenths of a mile. From some rcmeasuremcnts the greatest supposable error for the entire base was computed to be less than six-tcnthR of an inch. The second base measurement with this a11paratus was also by Professor Bache in 1848, (Coast Survey Reports, 1848, p. 43, and 1849, p. 38,) being the .Bodie'slsland base, N. C., of about six and three-quarter miles long. Ten working days were employed in the actual measurement. between the 4th and 23d of November. The greatest day's work was 1,692 metres, or 1.06 mile, in eight and a half hours. Several partial remeasurements give the total probable error for the entire base at less than one-tenth of an inch, and the greatest 1mpposable error at less than three-tenths of an inch. 'rhe only other base hitherto measured with theRe means is the Edisto Island base, S. C., which operation was conducted by Professor Bache between the 3d and 18th of January, 1850, (Coast Survey Report 1850, p. 34,) thirteen clays being occupied in the actual measurement. Its length is about six and two-thirds miles, and it was much more uneven than the previous base. The greatest tluy's work was 1,122 metres, or about three-fourths of a mile. A partial remeasurement gave one-tenth of an inch as the probable accidental error of rncasnremcnt for the whole base. It will be alnmdantly evident, on examining the results of other modes of measurement, that tho Coast Survey a11paratus is a superior combination of the requisite elements for rnch 011erations, giving a gain in accuracy, rapidity, and economy of use, over its predecessors. The multiplication of bases is no longer a souree of such formidable expenditures of time and money ; hence geodetic operations are much facilitated and benefited by this fundamental improvement in the instruments employed. The more perfect compensation from regulating the masHeH of the barn, the application of th~ principle of contact indication by the level, the stiffness of the support for the bar system, the sector for slope measurements, and the trestles, combining such a variety of movement with very great firmness; these features all attest the thorough study of the problem which was made by Professor Bache, rreparatory to calling forth the peculiar skill of Mr. \<\' iirdcmann. Bessel's contactlcvel, before employed in the comparison of standards, has the same readily available accuracy in this apparatus, and should supersede the comparing microscope entirely for final measurements. For field comparisons with standards, the peculiarly elegant principle of Saxton's pyrometer is even better than the contact-level. Whatever improvements may still need to be made in base measuring apparatus, this important point is now reached: that the bases are measured at once with an accuracy far exceeding that of the angular measures given by any practicable number of re1Jetitions on portable angle instruments, and of the same order with the c01:nparisons between the actual standards and their copies used in the measurements.

OF THE UNITED STA.TES COA.ST SURVEY FOR 1854. Report upon the .Determination of Longitude by .Moon Culmirw.tions.
GEXERAL COXSIDERATIONS.

1. \Vhen any nxed and constant quantity, such as the longitude nr latitude of a placl the <lirection of the meridian of a place, the angle of one distant ol~ject from another at a given station, &c., is observed directly or determined indirectly by one observation, that one observation must, in the deficiency of all other information, 11c a(lopted as the true value of this constant. But the single observation does not of itself throw any light upon the degree of accuracy of this determination, or indicate how far it is to be relied upon. 2. A second observation gives a second determination, which is always found to differ from the first. '.I'he difference of the observations is an indication of the accuracy of each, while the mean of the two determinations is a new determination which may be regarded as more accurate than either. 3. Each additional observation corresponds to a new determination, but the mean of all is better than either, for it is less affected bv the individual errors of observation tlian anv и other possiltle combinations of the observations. The comparison of the mean with tJ{e individual determinations has shown, in all cases in which such comparison has been instituted; that the errors of lunar observation are sul1ject to law, and are not distributed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. They are the symmetrical aml concentrated grouping of the shots of a skilful marksman aiming at a target, and not the random scatterings of a blind man, nor even the designed irregularity of the star!' in the firmament. ThiR law of human error is the more remarkable, and worthy of philosophic examination, that it is precisely that which is required to render the arithmetical mean of observations the most probable approach to the exact result. It lias been made the foundation of the method of least squares, and its introduction into astronomy by the illustrious GAl'SS is the last great era of this science. 4. If the law of error em bodied in the method of least squares were the sole law to which human error is subject, it would happen that by a sufficient accumulation of observations any imagined degree of accuracy would be attainable in the determination of a constant; and the evanescent influence of minute increments of error would have the effect of exalting man's power of exact obserYation to an unlimited extent. I believe that the careful examination of observations reveals another law of error, which is involved in the popular statement that "man cannot measure what he cannot see." The small errors which are beyond the limits of human perception, are not distributed according to the mode recognised by the method of least squares, hut either with the unif'ormit~' which is the ordinary characteristic of matters of chance, or more frequently in some arbitrary form dependent upon individual peculiarities-such, for instance, as an habitual inclination to the use of certain numbers. On this account it is in vain to attempt the comparison of the distribution of errors with the law of least squares to too great a degree of minuteness; and on this account there is in every Фpecies of observation an ultimate limit of acc1!racy beyond which no mass of accumulated observations can ever penetrate. A wise observer, when he perceives that he is approaching this limit, will apply his powers to improving the methods, rather than to increasing the number of observations. This principle will thus serve to stimulate, and not to paralyze effort; and its vivifying influence will prevent science from stagnating into mere mechanical drudgery. 5. In ap1lroaching the ultimate limit of accuracy, the probable error ceases to diminish proportionably to tlie increase of the number of observations, so that the accuracy of the mean of several determinations does not surpass that of the single determinations as much as it should do in conformity with the law of least squares; thus it appears, in the present investigation, that the probable error of the mean of the lleterminations of the longitude of the Harvard Observatory, deduced from the moon culminating observations of 1845, 1846, and 184'1, is 1".28 instead of being 1".00, to which it should have been reduced conformably to the accuracy of the separate determinations of those years. 6. When various determinations of the same constant are compared together, they arc frequently found to differ to an extent which demonstrates errors peculiar to the diflcrent methods of determination, and which are called constant errors. When the constant errors are incident to a person, they are known as personal equations. The investigatio? of.the constant errors is a difficult matter of research, but quite important to the present mqmry,

110*

because they tend to conceal the law of error involving the ultimate limit of accuracy, and to give erroneous impressions in regard to the 11osition of that limit. 7. "\Vhen many determinations of the same constant8 are given, the form of their mutual grouping must indicate whether or not they are sul1ject to constant error, and what amount of constant error is to be attributed to each determination. I am not, however, aware that there is any instance of a sufficient number of different determinations of the same constant to authoriie such an examination. 8. иwhen there are only a few determinations of kinds, in regard to which nothing is known as to their liability to constant error, the hypothesis of constant error is generally not required, and therefore not arlmissible, unless the combined result is less accurate than the best of the single determinations ; that is, unless the probable error of the combine(l result is greater than the least of the probable errors of the single determinations. The probal1le errors in all these cases must be ascertained by the customary method ot least squares. But the combined result cannot be obtained by the method of least squares, unless it be known what is the relative weights of observations in the different determinations. 9. If the observations are, in all respects, of the same kind, they may be assumed to be of equal value; or, in most cases, their relative value may be assumed to be reci11rocally proportional to the squares of their probable errors, as ordinarily determined. 'l'he formulas for combining the determinations in these forms are given in the accompanying paper, (A.*) 10. The demonstration that given series of observations are liable to appreciable constant errors is so important, that it ought not to be considered as complete and satisfactory, if it can be shown that there is any method of combining the different determinations in which the combined result is more exact than the best of the single determinations. A special investigation of this question is, therefore, given in the annexed paper, (B. *) 11. The conclusion that there is a constant error in given determinations, is greatly strengthened when the application of the criterion would lead to the rejection of one of the determinations, or to the rejection of as many observations from the combined result as are contained in either of the determinations. 12. The existence of a constant error may, however, be proved, even when it fails to be lletected by the preceding methods, if the determinations are of two classes which agree among themselves, while they differ from each other. 13. The application of these considerations to the determination of longitudes by moon culminations, will appear in subsequent portions of the report.
CORRECTION OF THE LUNAR EPHEMERIS.

14. The most serious difficulty in the reduction of moon culminations arises from the acknowledged errors of the lunar ephemerides, which often exceed twenty seconds of arc. These errors might be greatly diminished by the computation of a new ephemeris from the more exact" Tables of the Moon," published in the Office of the Nautical Almanac, under the direction of Commander Davis; but the labor of such a computation would be exceedingly great, and would not probably conduce to greater accuracy than can be more expeditiously obtained by empirical modes of deriving the corrections from direct observation, nor. would it be likely to prevent the necessity of ultimately resorting to empirical correctrnns. 15 ..The empirical method sometimes adopted of correcting the lunar ephemeris by ass~1mrng the mean of all the observed errors of any period as the constant error for that ~enod, cannot be safely employed for a longer period than two or three days, for the variat10ns of the .error are so great, that in a week they often change by twenty or thirty seconds of arc, passmg from their maximum to their minimum values, or the reverse. 16. Aftei; carefully scrutinizing the Greenwich observations of the moon, I arrived at the co:i;ic~us10~ t.hat the variation of the error of longitude is usually subject to two maxima and mm1ma m the couri;e of the month, so that its principal period iH about half a month. ~hi~ variable portion must be the resultant of several errors of nearly the same period; for it~ modul~s and arg~ment .are not constant, but differ considerably in different mo.nths. Notw1thstandmg the evident imperfection of the hypothesis, the convenience of a uniform

rule decided me to try if a sufficiently accurate empirical method of correcting t11e ephemeris could not he derived from supposing the variable portion of the error to l1aYe this period of a fortnight throughout each lunation, combined with the supposition that the constant portion of the error is different for each limb of the moon. The formulas for this method are given in the annexed imper, (C.) 17. The result of the trial seems to me to authorize the conclusion that this method mav safely l:1e used in all cases, and that it gives as accurate determinations of longitude as cai'i be obtained from observations of moon culminations. It has the great advantage of retaining all the observations made in any place for finding its longitude, even if there arc no simultaneous observations at the standard observatories; but the inquiry into the value of the methoJ depends upon many and complicated elements, of which the ascertaining of some fixed standard, which may be adopted as the probable error to which observations of tl1e moon are liable, is one of the most important.
STANDARD PROBABLE ERROR OF OBSERVATIONS OF A Ll:"NAR TRAKSIT.

18. The defects of the lunar ephemeris are an insurmountable olistacle to the determination of the 11robable error of observation of the moon by direct comparison with theory. There is even too great an uncertainty as to the nature of the theoretical errors to authorize the use of any of the elements of the ephemeris, exce11t for quite a short interval of time. 19. The comparison of simultaneous transits, observed by different oliservers, on n~ry nearly the same meridians, affords almost the only solution of this problem. The transit>i observed upon the same night at Greenwich and Edinlmrgh during the years 1836, 1838, 1839, 1840, 1843, 1845, 1846, and 1847, have accordingly been compared together; and also those made at Cambridge and Edinburgh in the year 1844, and those made at иwashington in the year 1846 with the meridian circle and west transit. In instituting the comparison, the observations of the two limbs lrnve been discussed separately. The average difference between the observations of either limb at two places has been regarded as constant error, and is not included in the probable error. The formulre and directions for making this comparison are contained in the accompanying paper, (D. *) 20. The computations for the determination of the standard error are contained in the annexed sheets, marked (1 - 16, D' ;) they have been prepared by Mr. Edward Goodfollow, the nicety of whose numerical arrangements is recommended to the favorable notice of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey. The sheets ( 1, 2, and 3, D') contain the computations of the moon's motion in R. A. during the interval of passage from the Greenwich to the Edinburgh meridian for all hourly motions within the extreme limits of the lunar vibrations; these hourly motions are arranged m the table of the sheet, (4 D'.) In the same way the sheets (5 and 6, D') contain the computations of the moon's motions in R. A., during the interval of passage from the Cambridge to the Edin burgh meridian, which are combined in the table of sheet (7 D',) and sheet (8 D') contains th" table and its computations for Greenwich and Cambridge. rrhe sheets (9, 10, and 11, D') contain the comparisons of the right ascensions of the first limb of the moon observed at Greenwich and Edinburgh during the above named years, and the determination of the corresponding probable error of observation. A similar comparison of observations of the first limb of the moon at Cambridge and Edinburgh is contained in sheet (12 D'.) 'l'he comparison of the observations of both limbs observed in the meridian circle and west transit at Washington i.s contained in sheet (13 D'.) The observations of the second limb at Greenwich and E~mburgh are compared in sheets ( 14 and 15 D' ,) and those of the second limb at Cambndge and Edinburgh arc compared in sheet (IG D'.) 'l'he sheet (16 D') also contains the. combination of all these probable errors into a final standard probable error of observation.

21. The following abstract gives a condensed view of these results of the computations contained in the sheets (D') :

22. If no regard had been given to con~tant error, the final standard would only have been increased to 0".104. 23. It is cvirlent that these proliable errors are influenced to some extent by the personal equatiom of the obsener~, alt~10:1gh they are vartially eliminated :with th~ con~tant error. 24. Another method of obtammrr the probable error of observation consists m the comparison of the longitudes ~иf the. m~on, dctermin.ed from the ol)servati?ns made w~th the meritlian circle at Greenwich, with those determmed from the obserratwns made with the alt-azimuth instrument. 'fhe details of thiR computation for the observations of the year ]8;j], arc contained in the annexed paper (E.)* The number of meridian observations employed in this comparison is lOG, and the resulting value of the probable error is 2".087, which is equivalent to 0" .139 in right ascension.
THE LIMIT OF ACCURACY ATTAINABLE IN TIIE DETERMINATIOXS OP LOXGITCDE BY MOON CULMINATIONS.

25. If the lunar ephemeris were perfect, the error of the difference between the moon's observed and computed riglit ascension would be exclusively attributable to defects of observationи and the probable error of each difference would be the same as that of observation. 'fhe probable error of a determination of longitude from a single culmination of the moon would, therefore, be equal to the quotient of the probable error of observation divided by the moon's mean motion, during a second of time, in right ascension expressed in time. The standard probable error, adopted from the comparison of the culminations, gives, then, 211 и 734 for the probable error of a si11gle determination of longitude from a lunar transit, reduced by the aid of a perfect ephemeris. 26. The imperfections, from which the lunar ephemeris cannot be delivered in the present state of astronomical science and art, augment the error of the comparison with observation. 'l'he square of the probable error, obtained upon the 11ypothesis of the 1ierfect ephemeris, must lJc increased by the square of the probable error of the ephemeris; and the probable error of the determination of longitude must be increased pro11ortionally to the increment of the probable error of the couqiarison. This obvious and simple rule for ascertaining the probable error of a comparison; affords a ready means for the comparison of the different methods of reducing moon culminations, and the determination of their relative accuracy. 27. The original methotl of reducing moon culminations, anu the only one, so far as I am aware, which has hitherto been adopted in the Coast Survey, is the simple comparison of the observations taken at the place whose longitude is sought, with oh1'ervations made Juring the same night at the standard observations. The mean of all the observations made at the observatories, takes the place of the ephemeris, and is suldect to a probable error dependent upon their number, combined with the error of the lunar motion, which is, in most cases, adopted from theory. The error of the lunar motion is unimportant, and may be rejected. 'l'he number of observations at the fixe1l observatories united in each mean, may lie assumed as three; so that the square of the probable error of each mean is one-third of the standard probable error of observation. Hence tlie square of the prohahle error of each comparison made by this method, is four-tl1irds of the square of the probable error of observation. But the method involves the loss of about one-third of the

moon culminations obserrnd for longitude, the effect of which upon the mean rcrnlt is equivalent to increasing, by its half, the square of the probable error. The value of the method is, therefore, the same as if the ephemeris were perfect, and the probable error of each observations were the square root of twice the square of the probable error of observation, or 0'.142. 'l'he probable error of each determination of longitude, by this process, is then 3'.18; but, in consequence of the loss of obseiTationR, it is equivalent to :-3'.8~, when it is compared with forms of reduction in which all the observations are retained. 28. The method of correcting the ephemeris for any interval of time by a constant quantity, which i,~ equal to its average discrepancy from the observations at the fixed ohsenиatorics for that interval, gives a probable error to the corrected ephemeris, which is distinct from the errors of observation. Its investigation must lie made a Rpecial subject of discussion, and the detailR of such a research, applied to the Greenwich ob8errntiom of the year 1846, are contained in the annexed paper (F.)* The fruit of this inquiry is a cornиcted ephemeris, of which the probable error is 0'.087. The J)ro1iable error of each comparison with observation is, consequently, 0'.13:1: and that of each d0termination of longitude is 3'.65. This method is, therefore, more valuable than the precediug. 29. The modified method of correcting the ephemeris for cacиh semi-lunatiou, which I propose for final atloption by the Om1st Suney, which ii> reforrcd to iu my formcиr report, and is described in paper (C,) has 1Jeeu subjected to ihe teRt of actual experiment 1,y an application to Greenwich observations of the first six months of the year 184fi. Tlie corrected e1Jhemeris, thus obtained, is liable to a probable error of 0'.0HO. Tlic iиrnlmlile error of each comparison with observation is 0'. 117, and that of each determination of longitude is 3'. 20. This method surpasses, then, either of the others in accuracy, and seems to accompfah all that can be expecterl in the reduction of moon culminations. The details of the preliminary trial arc contained in the annexed pnper (G.)* 30. The accuracv of each of these methods is diminished when the ohsenations made for longitude are in"forior to the assumed standard. In such cases, the ]Jro1mble error of a determination of longitude, hr either of the three methods, is greater than the rnlue given in the preceding paragraphs, but the relative value of the different determinations is not much changed. 31. By the law of error, recognised in the method of least square;:;, the ml'an of ten thousand observations of moon culminations corresponds to a determination of longitude, of which the 1irobable error is only one-hundredth imrt of that of a single determination, or about three-hundredths of a second; such a degree of accuracy would corres]101lll tu a prubable error of only one-thousandth of a second in the moonи t-: epoch, independentl~и of the errors of the lunar theory. Such a result is a deceitful trick of numuen;; it i~ an illusir.m emanating from the unw~rranfable extension of a partial law of human errcnи. to tlw neх;kct of other laws equally well authenticated. Even one-tenth part of this error is greater than can 1Je claimed, with any show of reason, for observations in which no observer pretends to be capable of observing the transit over each wire of the telescope nearer than to the tenth of a second. One of the fundamental principlefl of the doctrine of prnbahilities is, that the prouability of an hypothesis is proportionate to its agreement with oh~ervation. Ilnt an.'и snppu8e1l nr computed lunar epoch may be changed by seYernl hunrlrcdths of a second witlrnnt 1wrccptibly affecting the comparison with obsenиation, proYicled tlH~ comparison is re~trictPtl within its legitimate limits of tenths of a second. Observations, therefore, gives no information which is opposed to such a change. 32. In order to arrive at a more definite conclusion as to the ultimate limit of accurac,и, propose to consider a few cases which, although the.r are hypothetical, seem to me to illustrate the argument. First.-Suppose an observer, of perfect and unlimited i10werR of nice observation, to observe the transits of a star which constantly eroRse<l the win' of his tclcr-;copP (snppo~etl to have but one,) at the same precise instant hy his sidereal clock, and suppoAe the observer to record his observations only to seconds. In thiR case, the pro liable error, rиomputed h~' the theory of least squares, would lie nothing, for all the records would be identical: and yet the actual probable error of each record is, olwiously, a q1rnrter of a sccoml, aml the probable error of the mean is also one quarter of a 8econd. If the actual ins taut c>t' tlie star's tramit was slightly variable to an unknown extent, 1mt not enough tu rnry the recorded second, the probable error of the mean would he reduced, and mirtht even ht c nne

as small as an eighth of a Hcconcl. If the instant of transit varied sufficiently to vary the recorded RC'<'oncl, aJHl introduce another second into the record, the probable error of the mean wouM he still more tliminished, and might even be reduced to nothing. When the instant of transit nuic8, according to a known law, so far as to introduce more than two different secornls into the record, the probable error vanishes. But the vanishing of the probable error iR due, not only to the unprecedented accuracy of the observer, but to the vibration of the instant of transit, and exhibits quite strikingly that which I have before alluded to as the evanescent influence of minute changes of error. Sccondly.-Suppose an observer of perfect powers of observation exterior to a certain limit, but within those limits total1y incapable of distinguishing differences of error; supposP, for instance, tlwt, according to seconds, he cannot detect an error of one second; in this case, however the inRtant of the star's transit may vibrate, the probable error of each observation is a quarter of a second, and that of the mean cannot be reduce.d beyond this limit.* Tl1irdly.-Tl1e uchrn l f'a~e or ar1 ultimate limit of measuring perception with an ill-defined l>oundary cannot reasonably be supposed to have the advantage over the case just suppoeed of the exact boundary. It cannot, then, be that the ultimate limit of the accuracy of an averng-e determination can lle, more than in a four-fold degree, superior to the ultimate accuracy of mf'a,;nrinp: 1w1Tcptirm. Kow it mav he safch- a:-;sumcd that one-tenth of a second iR the ultimate limit of measnrin~ capacity 'in the c}{se of a lnnar transit: and, therefore, the ultimate limit of the accuTacy of a determination of the lunar epoch is 0'.025, and t.lrnt of the longitude of a place by moon enlminatiom i~ 0'.fiT!. 33. 'l'his ultimate limit of accuracy of the longitude of a vlace derived from moon culminations, can be so near1y attained by the observation8 of a fow year>:, that a longer eon ti nuance of them for this p11q10Re mmt be censured as a waste of time and labor. It leads to a JlCrplcxing Yariety of resnlts, without contrilmting to accuracy. By heaping error upon error it may cruRh the influence of each Heparate determination, but does not diminish the relati,-e height of the whnlf! ma.~s of discrepancy. 34. In the preceding inn-stigation of the ultimate limit of accuracy, the effect of those o1l8cnre Rourccs of conHtant error, which are manifest in the discrepancy between the determinatinns rleriv0t1 from tl1e two lirnhR of the moon, has not been regarded. This discrepancy, in the mean determination~ of a year, often amounts to ten seconds. In the ahseuce of all means fr,r dPci11ing bnw thi:1 discrepancy is to be divided between the two limbs, it cannot 1>l' 11ouhtcc1 that the ultinmte limits of accuracy must be extended, and the assumption tli11t it i8 u.<; yreat ns one S(WJ11cl rf ti'.mc seems to be a very rnode1иate widening of the limits.

38. After having corrected the lunar ephemeris, the application of it to the drtermination of a special longitude is quite simple and requires no elrn:idation. Tlw amiexed i1apers (I) contain such an investigation for determining the lon~i'l:uue of the ~ational OJn;ervatory from the \Vashington o1Jservations of 1845, 184(i, the HanTanl 011Renatory. anc1 the Philadelphia High School o11serntions of 1845, 184G, and 1847. The resulting longitude is 5li. Sm. 29s., with a probable error of Is.
ABSTRACT OF (C.)

The first portion of (C) consists of an investigation, from the Greenwich observations, of the nature of the defects of the lunar theory. The conclusion is, that these deftиcts are involved in seYeral terms, which for each lunation may be 1irincipall~, ccmbined into tиrn, of which one is constant and the other haR a period of ahout half a month. General fonnnlre are given for disc'ussing the corrections of the ephemeris upon this linsis, which arc applied to the years 1845, 1846, 1847, and 1851. Hut it is subscquentlr shown that, for all practical purposes, it is quite as accurate, and more convenient, to reduce the correction of the ephemeris for each semi-lunation to the form

A+Bt+Ct2 ,
in which A, Il, and C are constants which are to be determined from the observations at the fixed observatories, and t denotes the time. Three different modes of investigating the value of A, B, and Care proposed, each of whic~1 has its peculiar advantages, and for which the forms are su11joined, for the use of practical astronomers.
First form of correcting the lunar ephemeris, founded upon the rnethod of least squares.

Let t denote the interval of time between the date of the ohserrntion and some a~sumed epoch, 'Yhich had better be taken as near as }JOssible to the mean of the observations of the semi-lunation. The value of t is expressed in darn, all(l the fraction of the day may be neglected. и и Find for the semi-lunation the values of T, T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 , such that T -=the algebraic sum of the values of t, T 3 =the sum of the squares oft, T 3 =the algebraic sum of the cubes oft, T 4 =the sum of the f~urth powers oft. Let n denote the excess of each observed ricrht ascension of the moon's limb above that of the ephemeris. If the observation is not 1~ade at Grl'ermich, the oh~erved ri"'ht aRCt'nsion is to be increased by the averacre excess for the Year ueteri11ined hv simult:~rnиou;; nl10 11ervations of the observations of the right ascension of the' moon's lirn b n1ade at Green wid1 above those made at the actual place of observation.

To correspond to the value of the standard probable error of observation the sum of the squares should have been 0.1082, so that either of these results is of the requisite degree of accuracy to conform to this test. The form of computation is so short in either case that I should advise the use of all of them in each case to verify and confirm their respective results by mutual comparison.

Report of Professo1и W. C/. Bond on moon culminations, observed by li~m dur,ing the past yeaiи, by the ''American method.''
CAl\rnRIDllE, ~November 9, 1854. Srn: Since my last report, of October, 1853, there have been observed at this place fifty-six moon culminations with the requisite number of star transits, and sixteen occultatiorn; of stars bv the moon. The moon culminations and transits have all liccn recorded by the electric j)rocess-the occultations usually by two, and sometimes by three observers, furnished with chronometers and with telescopes of different powers. All the moon culminations which have been observed here since 1848 up to the present time have been completely reduced, and copies will be forwanle,l to the office as soon as durJ1icates can be prepared. The calculations incident to the chronometric expedition for determining the difference of longitude between this and the Greenwich obserrntory have been finished, under the conduct of Mr. G. P. Bond. The resulting longitude by ninety-two different chronometers in nineteen rnyages is 4h. 44m. 30.G6s., with a probable error :'.:. of two tenths of a second of time.

DEAR Srn: The observations for the Coast Survey were continued as usual up to the time of removing the instruments, in April last, the moon culminations observed amounting to about fifteen. Not having the record at hand, I cannot state the precise number. As you expressed a wish to have the observations continued at the new observatory, I had made arrangements by which I expected to resume them in October, but circumstances beyond my control have retarded the com1!letion of the observatory and the mounting of the instruments. I now hope to havt.) everything in readiness by the first of next month, when I shall commence observations with as little delay as possible. Respectfully and truly yours, E. OTIS KENDALL. Prof. A.

Discussion by J. E. Hilgard, Esq., of the probable error of observation with a twenty-si:c incli portable tranBit by Wurdemann, from observationB of .Assistant G. Davidson, in 1853.
The observations embraced in this discussion were made on twenty-six nights, ext~mding from June to October, 1853, at fourteen stations, in connection with the transportation of chronometers for the determination of longitudes on the northwestern coast. The construction of the instrument employed (C. S. No. 7) is novel in some respects, combining steadiness with portability in an unusual degree. The mean clock-error and instrumental corrections have been deduced from each night's observations, by the method of least squares. By applying these corrections to the observed times of transit, we obtain for each star a clock-error, ("') which, compared with the mean clock-error, (n) gives a residual as error of observation. From a large number of such residuals the probable error of an observation has been deduced. The following is a specimen of the work:

It will be seen that the errors of the tabular right ascensions are involved in this estimate, which is, therefore, not too favorable, but represents the actual working rate of the instrument. It may also be noted that on many occasions the instument was set up and used for observatid'ns on the same night. We may further conclude that a transit instrument of this class is well adapted for determinations of longitude from lunar transits, and may be safely recommended toиobservers generally.

BY .ASSIST.ANT EDMUND BLUNT.

BROOKLYN, Jun.e 27, 1854. DEAR Sm: We had a beautiful day for observing the eclipse of the sun on the 26th ultimo, and I selected the corner of Pierpont and Columbia streets, oTerlooking the bay, as a place where I would be free from the annoyance of noise or smoke from the city. The time was determined at Mr. Rutherford's observatory, and the comparison of the chronometers was made before and after the observations.

Mean time first contact.................................................................... 4 15 31. 65 Mean time last contact.................................................................... 6 37 40. 7 Atmosphere remarkably steady for an observation of tkis kind, at the commencement, but towards the end the motion was wavy. I send you drawings of t.hc appearance of the moon's edge near the lower cusp. The table mountains, with the wide valley between, (4h. 57m.) are shown also on the daguerreotypes taken by Professor Loomis; but the three peaks (5h. Olm.) and the single peak (5h. 10m.) are not, as the edge is not sufficiently well defined on the plate to show small objects. No spots were seen on the sun's disc, and I could not detect any roughness on the edge of the moon as shown on the sun, until (4h. 57m.) the table lands appeared. Two telescopes were used, the powers of which, as determined by Plossel's dynameter, were 25 and 46. Latitude 40░ 41' 45 11 , longitude 73░ 59 1 3211 (approximately) from the Chart and Coast Survey determinations of 1851. Yours, truly, EDMUND BLUNT. Prof. A. D. BACHE,

REPORT OF TllE SUPERINTENDENT

OBSEitVATIONS OF ASSISTANT L. F. POUltT.ALES AT ROSLYN STATION, NEAR PETEllSBURG, VIRGINIA.. PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA,

June 2, 1854.

Sm: I beg to submit the following report on the observation of the solar eclipse of May
26, made at Roslyn station, near Petersburg, Virginia. The telescope used was U.S. C. S. No. 10, (Fraunhofer,) with an eye-piece marked 86-its magnifying power. Seven colored glasses had been provided, but, on trial, I found that none but the one marked No. 3 could be used with comfort; the others were all either too dazzling, or gave a blurred image of the sun. No. 2 could have been used also, but its bright-red color was very fatiguing. No. 3 was a yellow-colored glass, giving a bluish white appearance to the sun's disc. It cracked very soon after the telescope was pointed to the sun, and I had, in consequence, to look through the edge of it. The telescope was mounted ten feet west and fourteen feet north of the eentre of the transit instrument. The beginning of the eclipse was noted at 4h. 4m. 31.9s., Roslyn mean solar time. This is probably two or three seconds too late, owing to the sun's limb not appearing sharp, but undulating. The end was noted at 6h. 32m. 55.5s., Roslyn mean solar time; but from that time up to 6h. 33m. 13s., I thought I could see stronger undulations on the sun's edge at the point of last contact than along the rest of the limb. The exact instant of disappearance was hard to seize, on account of similar undulations, before the last contact, producing great and rapidly-changing distortions. At no time-before, during, or after the eclipse-could I see any appearance of the moon off the sun's disc. The part of the sun's disc immediately adjoining the moon's edge appeared more brilliant than the rest. Tne cusps were always sharp, but undulations appeared to set out from their extremities and to run along both edges, this direction agreeing with the direction of the wind. A thermometer was hung up in the sun (free and uninfluenced by heated atmosphere) and another in the shade, and both read off, from time to time, with the following results:

OBSERVATIONS OF .ASSISTANT :R, D. CUTTS.
CAMP, BLACK MoCNTAIN,

Santa Clara County, California, May 28, 1854. DEAR Sm : I send you herewith my observations for the determination of the local time, and of the beginning and ending of the eclipse on the 26th instant. These observations were made at Black Mountain station, which, being from 1,500 to I, 700 foet above tide, was selected with the expectation that I would be able to overlook the fog, and in this I was not disappointed. The valleys below me, and as far as the eye could reach, were filled, on the 26th, with one dense mass of fog, while it was clear and bright at the station. With the view, however, to have the eclipse.observed in the best manner, and at more than one point, I engaged the following persons to make the necessary observations, and report their results to me to be forwarded to you. 'rhe arrangements with respect to telescopes were made when I was in town on the 18th: Prof. Nooney, at Benicia, near triangulation point; Lieut. Cuyler, U. S. N., at Oakland, near triangulation point; Messrs. Tennent and Anderson at San Francisco. The computations for San Francisco were published in the "Alta California;" and those for Oregon were forwarded to the editor of the "Oregonian," with a request that he would publish them, and interest himself in having the eclipse observed by any one having the requisite instruments. The triangulation will connect all the observations taken near San Francisco, with the Coast Survey observatory near the Presidio. With respect to my own observations, I would observe that I think they can be relied on. I took every care and precaution. David Kerr, of Maryland, recorded. The local time has not, I think, a greater probable error than a quarter of a second, and the exact time of the first symptom of the appearance of the moon on the disc of the sun, and of its final disappearance, was obtained as faithfully as the phenomena would admit of. The method of determining the time, and the character of the instruments used 1 are mentioned in the record. The color of the screen of the eye-glass was red. With the hope that the results will prove of service, I am, respectfully, yours, RICHARD D. CUTTS. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey.

BLACK MOUNTAIN TRIANGULATION STATION,

Santa Clara County, California. The latitude and longitude of the primary station called Black Mountain are approximately deduced froJl! the published latitude and longitude of the Coast Survey observatory near the Presidio, San Francisco county. The two positions being connected oy triangulation, so soon as the final computations have been made, the difference in latitude and longitude will be known exactly.

The observations for time were taken with a Gambey sextant, artificial horizon, and a. pocket chronometer by Jules Jurgensen, and consist of equal altitudes of the sun. The eclipae was observed with the two-foot telescope belonging to the twelve-inch Gambey theodolite, having an object-glass two and a quarter inches in diameter, and a magnifying power which admitted of a.bout one-quarter of the sun's circumference being within the field of vision. A diagonal eye-piece was used.

Solar eclipse ends llh. 6m. ~3s. by chronometer. Nothing very remarkable was noticed in the appearance of sun or moon. The western cusp of the moon showed at times quite a jagged appearance. The time of ending of the eclipse was entirely satisfactory ; the beginni,1g was unsatisfactory, owing to unsteadiness of the air and instrument. The instrument used was a pretty good three-inch repeater, and well mounted for such a portable instrument, but without a diagonal eye-piece. The eye-piece used was rather too high for this purpose, showing only about 45░ of the limb of the sun. The rate of the chronometer befor~ going to Benicia was nothing; after returning, it was . gaining one second daily, and performs well. The sextant observations were designed to be equal altitudes of one limb of the sun; but by an inversion in the first set, different limbs were taken. But the observations themselves give the means of reducing one limb to the other with all accuracy. The observations were made in the yard of the Collegia~ Institute, Benicia, Rev. Charles M.

DEAR

Sm: Your letter concerning the eclipse was received a few days before the event. I

had already calculated it for this place, where I determined to observe it; and had also calculated it for San Francisco, where I sent the times, &c., to be published. The night and morning }'receding the ecliP.se were very thick and cloudy, and threatening rain; but about half an hour before the commencement the clouds broke, and I got the time of beginning, (within eight seconds of my predicted time.) I then observed the transit of the moon's second limb as it was projected on the body of the sun, and of the sun's second limb. и The day continued clear, with a north wind blowing "fresh." I obtained the time of ending, and soon after observed two stars for time ; clouds set in densely, and no other transits were obtained until next day. The chronometer had been running irregularly for some da.ys previously, and the weathet had been such a.11 to preclude a.nything like transits, except once or twice the sun, and one or two large stars by day. Mr. Lawson also observed the times of commencement and ending, but the strong wind kept his telescope (Recon. No. 18) too unsteady to make the results reliable.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

APPENDIX No. 41.

Report of Dr. B. A. Gould, Jr., a.~sistant in the Coast Survey, upon telegraphic observations made for difference of longitude, between Raleigh, N. 0., and Columbia, S 0. October 1, 1854. DEAR SIR: I have the honor to submit a report of the Coast Survey operations carried on under my immediate direction during the past year. At the date of my last report the observations for the differences of longitude between the Seaton station and Raleigh, and between Raleigh and Charleston, were in course of discussion. The work of reduction and discussion has, since that time, gone very slowly forward, owing, in part, to the difficulties growing out of the character and mounting of the instruments used at Raleigh-in part, to the large amount of labor connected with the system of reduction adopted, and the small means at my disposal for its execution-and in part, also, to my protracted absence of more than half the year, rendered necessary by the continued injuries inflicted by storm and flood upon the single telegraph wire on which we were dependent for all the longitude resultR of the winter's expedition. The work is now rapidly approaching its completion, and I hope within a few weeks to be able to present a . full and final report upon each of these two longitudes. My earlie!lt observationR during the year were made for the determination of the latitude of Cloverden, in Cambridge, in the hope of determining with precision the amount of discordance between the geodetic and the astronomical results. This series of observations was carried on during the months of August and November. In the last week of November, 1853, I left Cambridge to continue the telegraphic operations at the South, and, after making the necessary arrangements at Charleston, erected and occupied a station at Columbia, S. 0.; Mr. Geo. W. Dean taking charge of the station at Raleigh. On account of the telegraph facilities, and for various other reasons, it appeared desirable that Columbia, rather than Charleston, should form a link in the great chain of telegraphic longitude-stations which are to connect the northeastern with the southwestern seaports of the United States-and hW'e, as at Raleigh, a site selected in the grounds belonging to the State-house. By the courtesy and kindness of his excellency Governor Manning, and of the gentlemen of the committee of each House intrusted with the erection of the new State capitol, permission was readily accorded, and I cannot but acknowledge my sincere official and personal indebtedness to these gentlemen for their kind aid, and their continual manifestations of friendly interest. It was my intention to push the longitude connections as far as Macon, Georgia; and an astronomical station was also erected at that city, in the ~aderny s1prnre, where permission to build was readily granted by the trustees of the academy, and every facility extended by the teachers to Mr. McDonnell. This station has not yet been occupied, but remains to be connected with Columbia, S. C., and Montgomery, Ala., during the coming winter. The difficulty of obtaining a sufficiently good insulation upon the southern lines has uniformly been a source of great embarrassment. The large extent of thinly settled country, and the extensiYe swamps and barrens traversed, render that close attention to the line impossible which is easy in more densely populated regions. At the same time, the large tracts of forest through which the line passes occasion additional danger to the wire from the fallin~, and to the insulation from the proximity of the trees. The large and rapidlyswelling rivers habitually carry away the posts and wireti during the great winter freshets, and render their replacement, for the time, impossible, and always difficult. Moreover, the climate prevents the attainment of the excellent insulation which any severe frost would afford. For these and other analogous reasons, the progress of the tele~raphic operations in the southern States must, for some time t.o come, be extremely slow. By the courtesy of Smith Mowry, esq., President of the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph company, the same facilities were accorded to the Coast Survey which had been granted for a series of years by his predecessors, Messrs. Kendall and Alexander, and the line placed at my disposal when the day's business was completed, which was, during the early part of the winter, about 10! p. m., and in the spring about midnight, although in exceptional cases the arrival of some steamer, or the preaa of political intelli,ence, occupied the Wire for the entire night. The observations weri commenced at Columbia on the 4th of January. The original

:rftan contemplated the exchange of signals on five nighfa, in this position of the olJservern, and on the same number after Mr. Dean and myself should have exchanged places, to eliminate the effoct of personal equation. But an utterly unprecedented continuance of unfavorable weather, followed by floods on the Cape Eear, Petlee, and other interpmdng rivers, prevented anr progress, and no opportunity for exchanging signal~ with Raleigh could be obtained until January 21st, on which occasion an exchange of some ten stars was effected. It was not until the 11th of February that three good series of star-signals had been exchanged; and, on account of the advanced season, I then judged it best to lie satisfied with three good nights' telegraphic work in each position of the observers. Accordingly, I then took charge of the station at Raleigh, while Mr. Dean came to Columbia, and on the 12th of March we succeeded in completing the second series of three nights' satisfactory exchange of signals. During the entire winter, a series of observations with the zenith telescope was carried on in Columbia for the determination of the latitude, as well as with the transit instrument at each station for the clock and irnitrumcntal corrections. The magnetic constants, both at Raleigh and at ColmnLia, were determinet1 by J\fr. Dean, allll the latitude observations were made independently with two instruments, by each observer, for the investigation of such sources of error as may be due tu peculiaritie8 of the imtrument used, or of the observer himself. The season being ton far advanced for the proposed connPction of Colnm1iia and Macon, the Columbia instruments were removed to vVilmington, :Korth Carolina, and those at Raleigh to Roslyn station, near Petersburg, Virginia, occu11ied by yourself in 1852: and the observations for the connection of these two places commenced with the month of :May. On the 18th of May I was relieved, by l\ir. Pourtales, of the charge of the station, in order to make observations upon the annular eclipse of May 26th, for which purpose I erected a transit instrument on Mount Agamenticus, in the township of York, :Maine, taking, also, the telescopes, chronometers, and other apparatus necessary for observations of both the time and the physical peculiarities, according to the plans recommended by the commit.tee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. But on this occasion, as on so many previous ones, the cloudy and rainy weather prevented any view of the sun during the entire day. In the present condition of the methods for telegraphic determination of longitude, the limit to the distance between the stations, as prescribed by the condition of the line and relative strength of the current at the extremities of the circuit, iR considerably less than that of practical communication. The reason of this difference is manifest, when it is borne in mind that an indispensable condition for the successful exchange of aRtronomical signals is, that the signals from both stations be recorded at each with the same adjustment of the recording magnet. In operating between remote stations, or during electrical di~turbances of the atmosphere, or in unfavorable conditions of the line, it is usually found that signals from a rerno~e station can only be aC',curately received when the armature is so adjusted as to make manifest the slightest variation in the electrical condition of the circmt, while the great and violent changes occasioned by interrupting the current at some neighboring }Jart of the circuit can only be properly recorded by an adjustment of the opposite character in the receiving magnet. In the one case the distance of the armature from the helix must be a maximum, and the tension of the back-spring a minimum, while in the other precisely the reverse is requisite. But the telegraphic observations can only be made available for longitude measurements when star-signals from one stcttion are interspersed and compared with clock-signals from the other on the 1mrne register. Hence the difliculty. It appears to me not impossible that a receiving magnet might be constructed on some different principle, in such manner as to obviate, or at least diminish, this impediment, at present the most serious of all. I have not yet succeeded in devising any plan, in spite of loog and careful consideration; but it may not be amiss to direct attention to the circumstance, that while both the distance of the armature from the helix and the tension of the spiral~spring are important elements of tlie adjustment under all circumstances, still their relative importance is very different in the two cases. 'l'he feasibility of a contrivance for attainiug an armature adjustment which should he available for widely different amounts of change in the galvanic current, seems to me to be dependent upon ,,~his circumstnnee. It is hardly necessary to allude to the fact that no self~adjusting magnet, ~r other a11paratus permitting a variation in the pass-time, could be made available. 17и

I am also under the impression that in those cases where the chief obstacle is offered by the insufficiency of insulation, not merely the lon~itude observations, hut the ordinary telegraphic communication, would be greatly facilitated by the use of battery elements, presenting a greater surface for chemical action; or, to use the common phraseology, that a greater "quantity" of current, even at a considerable sacrifice d'f "intensity," might frequently render telegrnphic communication practicable in spite of obstacles which are now sufficient to preclude it. This idea, originally suggested by yourself, has become more and more strongly impressed upon my mind by a two years' experience, and I believe that in many cases the use of the same amount of material in larger cups would probably be of considerable aid to the telegraph companies. A very serious impediment to our operations in the southern climate, ai:; spring advances, is occasioned by the extreme freqnency of thunder-storms, the electrical disturbance which they produce in the circuit rendering telegraphic communication impossible.. Materials are not at hand for forming a trustworthy estimate of the distance at which these storms begin to exert an appreciable influence upon the current; but an observation at Roslyn, bearing upon this point, and thoroughly confirmed by subsequent experience, is 1ierhaps sufficiently important to deserve mention here. It was in the second week of May, on a warm evening, after a very sultry day, a few clouJs were scudding and a bank of thunderclouds rising in the north, but the sky was clear enough to permit transit observations from the pole to the south point, and to justify the hope, realized a few hours later, of successful exchange of signals with Wilmington. The local circuit, consisting of six cups and about thirty feet of copper wire, thickly coated with gutta percha, was connected with the transit-key. But, although the whole of the circuit was contained within the building, except the battery, which was in a wooden box nailed to the outside, the electrical disturbance occasioned by the approaching storm was sufficient to derange the current utterly. \Vith each flash the normal battery-action was restored, so that the click of the armature was heard, and recorded, at each beat of the clock. But in the course of forty or fifty seconds the current ceased to :flow, until, after the lapse of a minute and a half or two minutes, the flash restored the regular condition of the circuit. The distance of the discharge, as estimated by the interval between flash and report, must have been two or three miles, and the thunder was by no means loud. No better evidence could be. wished of the fact that the disturbances of telegraphic communication exerted by thunder-storms are phenomena of induction. The interruption of telegraphic communication by auroras in the northern States is frequently quite as complete, but I am not aware that any influence of this kind U})On short "local circuit" has ever been observed. The local circuits of the Columbia and Roslyn stations were provided with one of Mathiot's self-sustaining batteries, similar to that in use for a year or two 11revious at the Seaton station, and the experience of the winter leads me to lay great stress on the efficacy and convenience of this form of battery for the local observations of a longitude station. The importance, for these observations, of a battery which is always ready for use, is to be highly estimated, for it is impossible that valuable observations should not frequently be lost in changeable weather in consequence of the time required for putting an ordinary battery into working condition. The peculiarities of Mr. Mathiot's arrangements seem to be especially adapted to the wants of a temporary station, and the modifications which he has recently introduced go far towards obviating the chief .objections which have been urged against this arrangement. ln discussing the results of the three longitude expeditions with which I have been occupied, an important foature has been introduced in the systematic application of the "crit.erion the rejection of doubtful observations," propose~, or rather elaborated, by Professor I cuce. In every case where a number of observations of apparently equal value wer~ m~~c for the determination of one or more quantities, this test has been applied, all the md1v1dual results permitted by the citerion being retained, and all rejected by it being excluded. To its consistent use I attach great importance, and attribute more reliable res~lts than wo~ld otherwise be attained; for while it forbids all unwarrantable tampering wit~ o?servati.ons or with individual results, the careful and legitimate discrimination which it exerc1se.s removes all apprehension that the result may be vitiated by the retention of absurdl; mcprrect valueii. The principle on which this criterion is based is simply this: " that ooservations should be rejected when the probability of the system of errors obtained by retaining them, is less than that of the system of errors obtained by their re-

jection, multiplied by the probability of making as many and no more abnormal observations." I propose soon to submit complete an<l accurnte tables for its use, extended within limitF< not likely to be exceeded in any case in which the investigations of the Coast SurYey mar require its application. During the year juRt elapsed, the telegraphic determination of longitude has been introduced into Germany and England and Belgium, and mea~urements made under the directions of Professors Airy, Encke, and Quetelet, of the differences of longitude between Berlin and Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Cambridge, England, and Greenwich and Bnrnsels. The Astronomer Hoyal also announces that preparations are already adrnncerl for a tekgraphic connexion of the obserYatories of Greenwich and Paris. In none of these operations, however, does it appear that accurate recording regi~ters han.' heen in use, or tlrnt tlie re:mlts in the German operations were freed from the vitiating influence8 of personal e(prntiou in giving and receiving signals, or of a relatively large probable error in the determination of local time; thi8 time, and not the star signals, having heen communicated Ly telegraph. In closing, I would expre8s my sense of the in valuable aid of my collal1orator, JHr.

Report to Professor .A. D. Bache, LL. D., Superintendent of the U. S. Coast Survey, containing directions and tables for the use cif Peirce's Criterion for the Rejection of Doubtful Observations: by Dr. B . .A. Gould, Jr.
DEAR Srn: In the Astronomical Journal, No. 45, Professor Peirce has given the results of the successful inYestigation of a singular problem, and one unquestionably among the most important of any which could be proposed, in its relation to all those exact sciences to which quantitative research or measurement may be applied. This problem was nothing less than the attainment of a formula which should be legitimately derived from the fundamental principles of the calculus of probabilities, and furnish an exact criterion for tho recognition of those observations which differ 110 much from the average of a Rerics as to indicate some abnormal source of error which would vitiate the result. The delicate task of discriminating between such observations and those whose discordance, although great, ought not to be deemed abnormal, has hitherto been left to the arbitrary judgment of individualR; and the present introduction of a rigorous mathematical ordeal for testing the extent of tolerable discrepancy, cannot fail to exercise a highly beneficial iuflurnce. But, important as is the use of this criterion, and sirn1>le as is its practical application, I am not aware of its adoption in the published discussion of any extended series of observations. In the criticism, however, of various series with which I have had to do in the study of the telegraphic results of the Coast 8uney, I have applied Peirce's Criterion with signal advantage, and haYe been led to the preparation of tables for facilitating its use. Such tables form a part of my report upon tho difference of longitude between the Seaton station and Raleigh. Suhsoq uently, having in mind its great importance for the discussion of other groups of observations, possibly extremely dissimilar in their character, it has seemed desirable to extend tho limits of these tables, and to submit thein in an independent form. The discussion of the formulas is unnecessary after the reference to the original memoir. But it may not be amiss to repeat them concisely ; and perhaps the slightly different form in which I have arranged them, with a view solely to facility in their practical employment, may not be deemed ill-judged. Let, then, ni =the number of unknown quantities contained in the observations. N = tho whole number of observations. E =the mean error of the series. x;r = the limit of error which demands the rejection of n observations.

In the practical employment of therm formulas, it will be found most convenient to determine first the value of Q from (B.) Next, assuming any approximate R, the corresponding >.is determined by means of (A'), and, by substitution in (0), furnishes a value of x, from which R may be obtained with greatly increased precision. The computation is then repeated, if necessary. Professor Peirce proposed three tables : The first, containing values of x; for the double m n argument m! = N and y N' would include the values corresponding to any given num-

=

ber of unknown quantities; the second, a table of single entry, would give log. (Br.) Q for different values of y; and third contain log. R, for argument x, being deduced from the solution of equation (D). This arrangement is unquestionably the neatest and most compendious; still I have concluded to give the tables a greater expansion, by employing both n and N as arguments. This demands a separate table for x;, corresponding to each value of m; but as the number of unknown quantities implicitly involved will be large only in very rare cases, I have felt less hesitation upon this account, and the extreme facility of its use will more than compensate for a sacrifice of theoretical elegance. The most frequent case of a number of unknown quantities greafor than two, is probably that presented by the elements of a celestial body-all of these elements being supposed unknown. Yet even here it will, in general, be found possible to consider two, if, indeed, not three of these, as sufficiently known for.the purpose of ordinary investigations. The following Tables I and II have, therefore, been computed by means of approximations through equations (A'), (B), and (0), for every number of observations up to 60 inclusive, and for the several hypotheses corresponding to the rejection of any number less than 10. The former table is calculated for the case of one unknown quantity; the latter for two. The function obtained by entering at the side with N, and at the top with n, is x,2, which, when multiplied by и2, gives the limit of 6 2, the square of the residual of any observation which ought to be tolerated. The value of 1 2 is, of course, deduced from the formula l:.6 2 = (N - m) и2;

It will be carefully borne in mind, that in the application-of these tables, each hypothesis must be tried in succession, beginning with n = 1. After it ir-; found that one obserrntion is excluded upon this tiupposition, the same criterion for two observations may be applied, using the column for n = 2, and so on in succession. No farther explanation seems to be required; but if examples be wished, they may he easily obtained by comparison with the two problems given by Peirce in his memoir, (A. J. II, 162.) For the first, where X = 30, n = 1, m = 2, our Table II shows x 2 = 5.54; the value obtained in the place cited was after two approximations x-2 = 5.51. For the second example, N = 15, rn = 2, n = 1; the corresponding limit which the criterion furnishes for the rejection of one observation is x2 = 4. 080; and inasmuch as one observation was thus excluded, the limit for the rejection of two is found to be x,~ = 2. 991. For those cases especially which fall beyond the limits of Tables I and II, the Tables III and IV are added, the former giving, by double entry with the arguments n and K, the values oflog. QN deduced from equation (R) for values of Nup to 90, and of n to 9, inclusive. The table of single entry proposed by ProfosRor Peirce, and giYing the values of log. Q for y, may, like the tables for x, be thus condensed into much smaller compasH; but as the values of N increase, the influence of the nvglected decimals become;; more and more important, and in the determination of N log. Q, we must always apprehend an error amounting to ~ N in the last decimal place. Embarrassment from analogous reasons attends the computation of Q itself; and since many interesting problemR in the theory of numbers lead to the use of analogous tal)les, it has appeared quite desirable to me, while engaged in its preparation, that it should be extended to a sufficient number of decimal places to permit of its convenient use in still other investigations. To attain the requisite 11recision, therefore, at least ten, and sometimes more, decimals have beeu employed, and the seventh place as given may, therefore, be considered reliable. For application in the criterion, more than five places will seldom be required, except when it is desired to push the ordeal to a refinement of criticism which will not ordinarily be exercised in a problem of probabilities, and especially when its solution depends upon an approximate assumption like that in equation (C.) The last, Table IV, is that for log. R to argument x, which has been computed by equation (D) to seven, and is here given to six decimal places. To aid in its calculation, the и2e-t:zdt table of given by Encke in the Berl. Astr. Jahbuch for 1834, has been em-

purposes, for x = 3, the highest value of the argument, corresponds to the case of N = 156, for one observation deserving exclusion. When the number of observations exceeds this, the series may conveniently be divided into groups of 150 observations each. I append one of the examples adduced by Peirce, and already cited, to illustrate the practical application of Tables III and IV, for those who have not the original memoir at hand. The computation is greatly facilitated by the use of the Gaussian logarithms, which are now habitually inserted in the five-figure logarithm tables. .For, as will readily ~ie perceived on inspecting the figures in the example, we have but to enter column f3 with the arithmetical complement of log. A2 1 to obtain in column C the ar. co. log. (1->.2), and, similarly, the argument log. (;}-1) in column A, gives log. x2 in column C. Example.-" 'fo determine the limit for rejection of observations in the case of fifteen observations of the vertical semi-diameter." Professor Peirce assumed two unknown quantities, one of them being constant and the other proportional to the horizontal parallax, and then found for the residual errorsII

It is needless to remark, that in the actual application of these approximative formulas, the most convenient assumptions for the successive values of log. R would not be precisely those yielded by the preceding hypotheses. Moreover; if, owing to the magnitude of any excluded observation, apprehensions be entertained as to the allowableness of equation (0,) the most that need be teared is the necessity of a new determination of и2, and the corresponding series of residuals. It is but proper to state that I have been aided in the necessary computations by Mr . иT. N. Stockwell, of Brecksville, Ohio. In the hope that these tables may not be without their value, in the discussion of the results of the Coast Survey, I remain, as ever, most respectfully and truly yours, B. A. GOULD, JR.

CAMBRIDGE, l\IAss., FebruUl'!f 28, 185.t. Sm: Enclosed is my concluding report on the results of the chronometric cxpcrlitions of 1849, 1850, and 1851, for the difference of longitudes of Cambridge aml Liverpool, commencing with the date of my communication of October 1, 1853. The difference between the longitudes by east and west rnyages i~ very evident in the voyages of 1851, as well as in those of 1849-'50. I am satisfied that the effect of temperature on the rates of the chronometers affords a sufficient explanation of this difficulty; but, unfortunately, we are not in possession of a complete thermometric record of the exposures of the chronometers. It is certain, however, that the average sea exposure has been lower than that on shore, and further from the point of best compensation of the chronometers, which is U8ually between 60░ and 70░. Below this point, their tendency is, with very few exceptions, to lose on their rates. They must, therefore, on the average have lost, while at sea, more than is indicated by the shore rates. The effect would be to give too small a longitude for the voyages from Liverpool to Cambridge, and too large from Cambridge to Liverpool; which answers to our case. The best security which we have for the accuracy of our final result ii;; in the assumption-fortunately, a very probable one-that the temperature at sea has differed from the shore temperature by nearly the same average amount for both cast and west voyages. * * DEAR

REPORT
On the computation of the results of the chronometric expeditions of 1849, 1830, and 1851, between Cain bridge anrl Liverpool.

At the date of my last report of progress, October 1, 1853,* the reduction of the chronometric comparisons had been commenced. This, when completed, furnished a series of errors on mean solar time, which was the basis of the remainder of the work. The following is the combination of these results, considered to be the best adapted to the circumstances of the different voyages:

We are not in possession of data sufficient to enable us to say with certainty how far the effect of temperature will serve to explain the existing difference of east and west voyages; but that it has an appreciable influence is certain. It is a well-established fact, that the average temperature compensation of chronometers is of such a nature as to cause the instrument to lose on its daily rate when exposed to a temperature either above or below a certain point, for which the compensation is most perfect. If we represent by s the temperature of exposure, and by 90 that of the best compensation, I have found from a large number of chronometers that the rate of gain may be expressed for a range of 20░ above and below 80 by the formula:

we shall have for the temperature correction of longitude
J;.,

e = 1.2 H.

K

The average sea exposures give a negative sign to H for the nyages from Liverpool to Cambridge, and a positive sign for those in the opposite direction. Combined with the negative sign of K, this gives for the sign of J~ ;.,, for the voyages L. to C. - for the voyages C. to L. From the most reliable values of e which could be obtained or estimated, H has been computed for all the voyages giving a correction of the conclmled longitude J6 ;., = - Os.15; which, however, rests upon precarious data. It is quite possible that the true correction may exceed this amount. Although this has not been applied, it should be noticed that the probable errors of >. + J ;.,, and of ;., - J ;.,, that is, of ;., by the west and east voyages, include the probable effect of temperature. But there is no reason to doubt that the temper::tture effect, which is of itself sufficient to account for the difference of east and west voyages, might be completely eliminated in future expeditions by means of an accurate thermometric record of the exposures of the chronometers;* the values of the co-efficient being determined experimentally for each of them. In the accompanying tabular viewt, in the column "voyage," L. indicates the first voyage from Liverpool, C. that from Cambridge. The voyages of 1849-'50 extended from August, 184\J, to January, 1850. Those of 1851, from July to October. The index of irregularity of each chronometer, deduced both from the sea and shore rates, is M': this constant includes the probable effect of the average temperature exposure; t' is the length of the voyage in days, or, more properly, the interval between the epochs of u2 and it 3 ; .' is the probable error of ;.,, attributable to errors in the determination of local time, independent of the personal equation of the observers; i'' is the probabl~ error of>. dependent on k'' and t'.

APPENDIX No. 43.
Table of
~Magnetic

Declination.

The magnetic declinations observed during the progress of the survey, from 1844 to 1854, are collected in the following table. The localities are arranged in a natural geographical order, beginning with the northeastern part of the Atlantic coast. The latitudes and longitudes are given to the nearest tenth of a minute. Most of these stations are trigonometrical points, and may be found in the list of geographical positions published in the annual reports for 1851 and 1853. The magnetic meridian has generally been determined with the portable declinometer of Gauss and Yv eber ; in some instances with a variation-transit or a magnetic theodolite. Observations were generally made about the time of the day maxima and minima-the mean of which is the declination given in the table. In some cases half-hourly observations from 6h. a. m. to 6li. Jl. m. were made; and in a few instances the observations were continued for half an hour only. All of which have been reduced to the same mean position by means of the curves of daily variation derived from observations at the magnetic observations at Girard College and Toronto. The astronomical meridian has generally been obtained from the azimuths of the triangulation, or occasionally by s1>ecial observations of the sun or Polaris. At some of the stations where local attraction was suspected, observations have been made at different times and at different localities, not far distant from each other.
и Such an expedition has been provided for .-Superi11tendeiit. t Omitted. _

Extracts/ram reports of Assistant George W. Decw ou the establishment (f meridian lines at Pctcrslml'g, Va., rnzd Ra7ciglt and W?'.lmington, 1v. C.
PETERSBURG, VA.

"\Yhile your party was engagell in astronomical observations at Roslyn Hill, (in 1852,) a committee of the city council of Pderslmrg expreR~ed a wish for the eRtablishment of a meridian line in or near the city, and by your direction a line was traced south from Roslyn Hill, and permanently marked in the following manner: The forty-three inch transit by Troughton & Simms, (C. S. ~o. 8,) waR adjusted to the meridian by observations 011 circumpolar and equatorial stars. 'fwo marble posts were then placed a hundred and twenty metres apart, in the range of the instrument directly south of the city g-as-works, a11d firmly imbt'dded in the earth; and a third, two feet in length, was plante!l at the sontl1ern terminus of the line, distant two and a half miles on the south side of the Appomattox river, and near the resi<lence of Mr. Russell. This was marked by the intersection of two lines cut on the top of the post. The north terminus was marked by a drill-hole in the top of the granite block upon which the transit instrument had been adjusted.
RALEIGH, N. c. (1854.) A meridian line, five hunclreu and twenty feet in length, extending across the Capitol sqnarc, was accurately traced by means of the forty-six inch transit, (0. S. No. 6,) which had been adjusted in the meridian for astronomical 1mrposes. The ends of this line were marked by copper bolts inserted in the top of the granite foundation which supports the iron fence of the square. The point directly below the transit ill8trument, coincident with its centre, was fixed by the intersection of lines cut at right-angles upon a granite post ten inches square at the end, and sunk two feet and three quarters in the ground, leaving the top of the post level with the surface. This was inscribed with the letters U. S. C. S.

t WrLMINGTo:q-, N. C. (1854.) By your direction a meridian line was established in this city during the progress of the astronomical observations made by your party. The line was traced with the forty-three inch transit (C. S. No. 8) previously adjusted for the meridian by observations upon equatorial and circumpolar stars. The north terminus is in the rear of the building known as the "Old Theatre," and was permanently marked by a marble post inscribed with the letters U. 8. C. S. The Aouthern terminus, marked in a similar manner, is located near the rear entrance gate of the St. James Episcopal church on Market street, the top of the post being sunk eighteen inches below the ground surface, with reference to a contemplated grading of the site. Its exact position will be found at the intersection of lines 23.5 foot from a copper nail in the trunk of the locust tree within the yard, and 9.5 feet from the northeast corner of the church. The meridian lines thus established, besides facilitating the operations of the engineer and surveyor, might also be made of general convenience to residents in the vicinity of their location. At small expense convenient sun-dials could be erected, and by means of the equation of time usually given in the common almanacs, the local time could be readily determined to. the nearest minute. Very respectfully, GEORGE W. DEAN, Assistant. A. D. BACHE, T,L. D., Superintendent Coast Survey.

APPENDIX No. 45.

Preliminary determinaf'ions of co-tidal lines on the Atlantic crm8t of tlie United StateB, from tlie Coast Surve71 tidal observations, by A. lJ. JJaehe, Snperintendcnt.
(Communicated to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, by authority of the Treasury Department.)

In the progress of the hydrography of the Atlantic coast of the United Rtates, numermrn tidal observations luwe necesRarily heen maue for correcting the s\lunding,; and determining the establishments of the port~. vVith them I h:we connecterl (Jh~errntiom of a more permanent character, intenued to furniHh the dat<t for ascertaining the laws of the tides in important localities, and others for tracing the rnиogre8s of tlie tide-wave along the coast generally, and in special cases in sounds, hays, a!lll rivern. These nbsenatinn~ are still in progress ; indeed, those for dc\'cloping the laws of the tide~, and determining the constantR of theory, de11eml for their Yalue HJJ<m thc>ir loug continuance. So many autlwntic results have now, hovrnver,-l1ecn obtained, that it appears desirable to put them together, and to ascertain the concluHions towards which thl"~и ternl as to the co-ti(l:tl linPs, and by the agreement of the separate results \Yith general laws, or their departure from them, to determine which of them require further obsenations to check their first results, and where new stations oi' observations are necessary for the purptlse. "My attention haH heen called, also, by the request of a valued friend, the .Master of 'friuity Colle;;e, Cam11ridge, to some attempt of this sort, and his labors in connection with this suhject on our own coast have entitled his request to the most respectful consideration. I am indebted to L. :F. Pourtales, esq., in charge of the tidal party of the U. S. Coast Survey, for the revision of the computations given in this paper. The labor of reducing tl1e observations themselves has fallen chietly upon Messrs. Heaton, Fendall, anrl Hawley. 'l'he diagrams have been prepared by Mr. 0. Fendall, under the direction of Mr. Pourtales. The stations at which observations of the tides have been made, of the more reliable class, are thirty-three in number, extending on the Atlantic coast from Cape Florida to Portland, Maine. I have been able, through the kindness of Captain Shortland, R. N., in charge of the Admiralty survey of Nova Scotia, to extend the results to the entrance of the Dav of Fundv. Table No. 1 gives the names of the 1ilaces of observation, with the time during which the observations of high and low water were made, and remark~ in relation to them. The stations marked (*)in Table No. ~, have been made use of in determining the co-tidal lines for this paper. A few stations have been embraced in the results where the number of observations is not comparable to those at the other points, chiefly to introduce localities important in position, and to sift the observations already made at them. Old Point Comfort, New York, and Boston harhor, have been 11ermauent. stations for ROlllC rear~: Charleston, Tybee entmnce, Portsmouth, and Portland, have been more recently added to them.

To the short series of observations, especially, there should be applied corrections for declination ancl parallax; but after computing several cases, I was satisfied that the errors from other sources, and especially from the positions almost indispensably necessary to the tide-gauges, more than made up for any irregularities from this source, and determined in the preliminary inquiry to omit these corrections, which amount only to a few minutes even in extreme ea8es. A much more important correction iR that for the 11osition of the gauge in a harbor or river entrance, in many eases within a bar. Where our charts are completed, we have the elements for computing this correction by the law of depth, supposing the wave to move in the channel with a wloeity proportional to the square root of the depth. This law, when applie(l to two wry different cases. Savannah river and Boston harbor, where we had the rncan:s of k~ting it by measured distances and known de11ths, was so completely verified, that I han: uot hesitated to apply it in the othlиr cases.

In order to obtain the best results from the observations. thev have been dfrided into groups, in the way and from considerations which will be he;eafte'r explained. Supposing the stations to be really connected in the physical group, and assuming that the space over which the observations extend is such that the co-tidal lines may be taken as straight lines, we obtain by l!'Jast squares the position of the co-tidal lines, which will best satisfy the equation. The mean latitude and longitude of each group is taken, and the group is referred to this point as the origin of co-onlinates; the mean co-tidal hour is also taken. In the equation of the co-tidal line:M: x +Ny= z x and y represent the known co-ordinates, the difference of longitude being reduced to the same unit of the geographical mile as the difference of latitude. The co-efficients l\f and N are determined by the equationsM l: x 2 N l:xy= l:xz

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

~is

the tangent of the angle which the co-tidal line makes with the meridian, and

-.I M2 N 2 gives the motion of the tide-wave, or difference of co-tidal hour for one geographical mile J1erpendicular to the co-tidal lines. Iu this I han~ merely followed the admirable example given hy Professor Lloyd, in the joint paper of himRdf and Colonel Sabine, on the magnetic survey of the British Islands. Having investiptted separate groups in this way, it is easy to clra w the co-tidal curves whicl1 represent tl1e ulrnenatinns; the invesiigai ion tesfa; tlw grouping in an interesting way, h~' the coincidence or discrepancy of the computed and observed co-tidal hours. The first approximate indication from the discussion is the correspondence of the tides on onr Atlantic coast to tl1e suprwsition of a tide-wave moving from S. 53░ E. to N. 53░ vV. ; but this iR only r. rude statement of the 1>henomena. In scanning the co-tidal hours along the coast, we obr-icrve that they divide themselves into two groups, one Routh of Martha's Vineyard, and the other north of Cape Cod, with a short anomalous group between them. The co-tidal hours from Cape Florida to Quicks' Hole, Martha's Vineyard sound, are not greater than 137i. 30m., nor less than ] 1h. 38m. Hatteras iR decidedly, as was pointed out by the l\:Iaster of Trinity, the Rev . .Mr. Whewell, a point of divergence, the establishments on the north and east of it, and the south and west of it, being, as a general rule, greater than the establishment of Hatteras. Our value for the co-tidal hour there difters from Mr. Whewell's, and further obRcrvations, now in progress, will decide between the two results. From Provincetown, Cape Cod, to Cape Sable island, the co-tidal hours vary between 12h. 55m. and Lili. 43m. Beginning at Tybee entrance, Fort Pulaski, Savannah river, we have a good series of tidal stations to Hatteras, five in number, forming group a, Table No. 3. 'l'he mean cotidal hour iR llh. 52111., and the angle which the co-tidal line makes with the meridian is 50░ 09', agreeing very nearly with the trend of the coast. The motion perpendicular to the direction of the co-tidal line is twenty-four miles in half an hour, agreeing nearly with the velocity due to the depths, as will he seen by inspecting the chart of co-tidal lines which accompanies this paper, upon which the fifty and one hundred fathom curves are drawn from the best'data we ,yet have. The mean diserepancy of the computed establishments and of those observed for this group, is 16m. ; tliat of Beaufort differing most, and for Cape Pear the least. If no correction had been applied for the 1iositions of the tide-gauges within harbors, the results иwould have been as stated in group a bis, Table Ne. 3, which, while the position of the co-tidal line is but little changed, gives a re~ult for the movement of the tide-wave which is entirely too small, as must of course be the case. The uext group north and east of this, b, consists of Old Point Comfort, Delaware Breakwater, (;old Spring inlet, and Sandy Hook, embracing a 1>art of the coast having the flame general direction. 'l'he mean co-tidal hour is 12h. 18m. ; the angle of the co-tidal line with the meridian is 22░ 21', agreeing again with the general trend of the coast, which i8 about 26░, the true value of the motion being masked by the irregularities of the establishments. '.l'he computed establishments agree well with the observed, differing but five minutes in the average, and six minutes at the greatest. In the next grou1J, c, four stations are placed from Sandy Hook to Quicks' Hole, viz: Sandy Hook, Point Judith, Newport, carried to the entrance of the bay by the depth, anJ Quicks' Hole; the mean co-tidal hour is 12h. 6m., the direction of the co-tidal line 63░ 271., eaRt of the meridian ; the distance gone over by the tide-wave in half an hour, forty miles; the mean difference in the computed and observed establishments is less than three minutes, and the greatest difference five minutes. Fire island anifd~fontauk are omitted from this series a.s a~01n:1~ous ; if, however, they are included, tl~e result shown in c bis, Table No. 3, JR given, m which the direction of the co-tidal line is 58░ 36' and from which a decidedly erroneous velocitv results. ' l\font~uk looks like a J>of~t of convergence, as tcrme(l by Mr. wиhewell; but its result is uncertam, and the c~bservat~ons there and at Fire island must obviously be repeated.

The average difference

between the computed and observed co-tidal hour is less than four minutes. and the greatest difference less than ten. ' и Group e containR Newburyport, Portsmouth, Portland, Fourchue, Ellenwoocl's island, and Cape Sable. 'l'hc mean co-tidal hour is Hh. 3im., the angle of the co-tidal line with the meridian 44░ 04 1, and the motion of the tide-wave thirty miles in 30m. The average difference of the computed and observed co-tidal hour is rather more than ten minutes, and the greatest difference in the case of Cape Sable island amounts to 23m. Newhury}Jort, which is brought to the sea estahli~hment by the depth, diifern but six minutes in the computed and observed numbers. The twelve stations of the last two groups combined in one group, give 14h. 56m. for the mean co-tiditl hour, 38░ 4li' for the indination of the co-tidal line, and thirty-three miles in half an hour for the motion. Between c and d is the anomalous gron1) which occupies Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket sounds, and includes the sea of the southern and eastern sho1w; of these islands, and the 1)assage between them. A side sketch shows the anomalous co-tidal houri') Yarying from 127i. 19rn. at Mcnamsha Bight,. and 127t. 38m. at vVood's Hole, to 16/i. 02m. at Holmes' Hole. The obsenиations yet collected are not sufficient to trace with precision the details of these changes, though abundantly so to establish the general phenomena. They show, conclusively, that this is a case of interference, and }JOint to the nature and amount of it. 1 prefer to obtain further observations neces;;ary to give the particulars of this interference, l1eforc entering upon a discussion of this cmious series. The heights concur with the times in giving the same tmlutiun to these cases, a mean rise and fall of one foot at Nantucket island being placed, as it were, between a rise and fall of 3.3 feet at llienamRha Bight, and of 11.5 feet at Provincetown. The shoal ground off Nantucket, and its influence in the direction of the co-tidal lines, are roughly tracPd upon the chart. Group f is at the extreme southern portion of the series where the tide-wave is turned by the Bahama Banks, aml makes its way through the Straits of Florida. The three stations in that group are Cape Florida, Cape Canaveral, and St. John's entrance; of this, Cape Canaveral affords but a vague result. The co-tidal line makes an angle of 117░ 121 with the meridian, and the motion in half an hour is twenty-nine miles. These results are collected in Table No. 3.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

From the general indications of these groups, and with the approximate form of the curves of depth, it is not difficult to trace the probable forms of the co-tidal lines. With the assistance of Mr. Pourtales the chart now presented has been prepared. It shows the co-tidal line of 12h, following the trend of the southern coast from Tybee towards Hatteras, running close to the shore aR it passes southward into the Straits of Florida, interrupted between Cape Lookout and Hatteras in passing northward and eastward, re-appearing again north and east of Hatteras, and following the coast inwards toward:,, Sandy Hook, and then towards Point Judith, and leaYing the coast off the shoals of Nantucket and Cape Cod. The lines of 11~/z. aml llh. arc approximately drawn outside of t11e line of 12/i., which, in general, is quite near to"the coast, and conforms to its sinuosities from 'l'ybee to Karragansett entrance. The co-tidal line of 15h. is the one which characterises the indentation between Cape Cod and Cape Sable, the probable connection of the depth of the sea there, and of the co-tidal lines, being traced on the chart. The lines connecting these two 1<ysterns are uncertain. The tide-wa ,иe appears to move backward from the northern extr.emity of Cape Corl to the southern, or }fonomoy Point; but this part of the subject requires further observations for its elucidation. I have tried, in discussing these observations, several other groups, but chiefly to learn whether stations must be multiplied or observations repeated; and it is not necessar.v to occupy the time of the Association with a detail of these trials, or with their results. 'rhey will be used in the progress of the further observations.

APPENDIX No. 46.

Comparison ef the diurnal inequrdity ef the tides at San Diego, San Francisco, and Astoria, on the Pac~fic coast of the United States, from obsen1ations in connection with the Coast Survey, by A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
(Communicated lo the American Association for the Advancoo,i.ent of Science, by authority of the Treasury Department.)

At a meeting of the American Association in August, 1853, I submitted some remarks on the diurnal inequality of the tides as observed at San Francisco. I propose now to com1iare this important inequality at the three ports of- San Diego in California, San Francisco in California, and Astoria in Oregon. 'rhe results are the first fruits of the tidal observations under the immediate charge of Lieut .. Trowbridge, of the Corps of Engineers, to which I referred at the same meeting, as in progress. The series is intended to develop the tidal phenomena of that coast, ancl the three stations referred to are those for permanent reference, at which self-registering tide-gauges have been vut up. The results now communicated arc derived from observations at Astoria, from July 11 to Odober 31, 1853; at San Francisco, from January 17 to February 15, 1852, and from January 5 to February 26, 1853; and at San Diego, from September 22 to November 31, 1853. All the observations were made with Saxton's self-registering gauge. I submit specimens of the actual curve traced hy the gauge. The results have been computed, under the direction of L. F. Pourtales, esq., assistant United States Coast Survey, liy Messrs .. H. Heaton and P. R. Hawley, and the diagrams were drawn by Mr. C. Fendall. Some of the curves of obRervation on a reduced scale are shown in diagram No. 1. TQ.e vlace of observation, and the dates for each series of curves, are stated on the diagram. The diagram repr_esent? the times from 0 hours to midni&J!. t, on a ~cale in which the distance between the vertical Imes corresponds to two hours, ._the heights on a scale of half a foot of risc or fall of the tide to each division between the horizontal lines. The phases and declinations of the moon are inserted at the top of the diagrams, and the times of the moon's transit at the foot. The curves have a striking similarity, and show a large diurnal inequality in both high and low water, in time ancl in height, at or near the greatest declination of the moon. The greatest inequality of the height is 2.76 feet at Astoria, 2.40 feet at San Francisco, and 2. 77 feet at 8an Diego. The mean rise and fall, estimating the highest high and lowest low waters of each day only, is for the three places respectively, 7.86 feet, 5.92 feet, and

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

The foregoing table shows the diurnal inequality in time and height of high and low water at the three places before named. The whole difference in height and interval between the A. M. and P. M. tides is taken as representing the diurnal inequality, and no correction is made for the half-monthly inequality in preparing the tables. I may observe that upon trying the corrections with the half-monthly inequality, as at present determined, no special advantage resulted; and until the half-monthly inequality is determined by more numerous observations, I adhere to this form of discussion. The results are shown in diagram No. 2, in which the ordinates denote the inequality in interval and height on the days from zero of declination of the moon, denoted by the abscissre. The dots show the actual observations, and the curves are drawn with a free hand among them. The results for the three places are distinguished as marked on the diagram. The following are the inferences from the discussion: 1. In every case, the inequalities increase and decrease with the moon's declination, reaching zero at or near the time of the moon's crossing the equator. The average epoch of the inequalities agrees almm;t exactly with the time of the zero of declination. 2. The inequality in height of high water, and in interval of low water, increase and decrease together, and so for the inequality in time of high water and in height of low water, as was remarked in the case of San Francisco. 3. The declination of the moon, and the inequality in interval of high water and in height of low water, have contrary* signs at all three of the places; the reverse being true of the other two inequalities. 4. The inequality in the height of low water is, in general, greater than that of high water, as was before stated for San Francisco. The proportion of the average and maximum inequalities is nearly as follows :

No. 47.

On the distribution of temperature in and near the Gulf Stream, off the coast of the United States, from obsen:ations made in the Coast Survey. By A. D. Bache, Superintendent.
[Communicated to the American Asso~iation for the Advancement of Science, by authority of the Treasury Department.]

I propose to present to the Association a 1Jrief summary of the result of obserf~tions made in the progress of the Coast Survey, in exploring the Gulf Stream, so far as the distribution of temperature is developed by them. The entire observations have been reduced anew, under my immediate direction, by Professor Pendleton, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, who has also gone over with me, systematically, the discussion of the work preparatory to its publication in detail, and whose care, assiduity, and intelligence in the matter I desire here to acknowledge. At the Cambridge meeting of the Association, in 1849, I explained the general plan of the exploration of the Gulf Rtream, and presented the results of the observations made up to that time by Lieutenants C. H. Davis, Geo. M. Bache, S. P. Lee, and Richard Bache, of the U. S. Navy, in command of hydrographic parties in the survey. Since then, t}ie work has been continued by Lieutenants T. A. l\I. Craven and J. N. Maffitt, U. S. :K., and has been extended south from Hatteras to Cape Canaveral. In addition to the sections across the stream, upon which the temperature had then been examined, lictween Cape Cud and Cape Hatteras, others ha Ye been since explored from Cape Fear, Charleston, St. Simon':;, St. Aug1rntine, and Cape Canaveral, and new and interesting results have been deYeloped in relation to the distribution of temperature across the sections, and to the connection, at least in some of them, between the peculiar dii;tribution and the form of the bottom of the sea. The examination now made extends from about 42░ north latitude to 28~ , and from about 65i 0 west longitude to SOi 0 и It authorizes the construction of a chart of the Gulf Stream, showing the distribution of temperature in and near it, not only at the sttrface but at various depths. 1. Distribution of temperature at d\(ferent depths. Having gone very fully into this subject, which was one of the first satisfactorily Bhown by the observations, I do not intend to repeat here what was then stated, exdpt in a general way. The distribution of temperatures below a certain depth, in the cold current which exists betwf~<'n the shore and the Gulf Stream, and over which the warm waters of the Gulf flow, thinning out as they approach the land, was shown to belong to a state of equilibrium of temperature which would be assumed by a mass of water having warm water above it and cold W\ter below it, to be represented by a logarithmic curve, and therefore to be due to conduction. That in the Gulf Stream varied according to a different law, indicating a disturbance of equilibrium. Diagram No. 1 shows the distribution of temperature with depth, in the water between the shore and Gulf Stream, as deduced from the observations of Lieutenant G. M. Bache. The ordinates of the curve represent the depths, and the abscissre the temperatures. The depths, in fathoms, are written at the side of the diagram, and the temperatures, by Fahrenheit's scale, at the top. The position at which the temperatures at various depths, recorded in this diagram, were obtained, was in latitude 36░ 151 north, longitude 73░ 521 west, on the section !ntended to be made from Cape Henry perpendicular to the axis of the stream. This curve, and others of the same kind, were compared with the logarithmic curves which would best represent the observations, and their close coinci~ence. wit~1 them shown. The curves were deduced by least squares, from an ingenious ~nvest1gat10n by J. H. Lane, esq., then of the Coast Survey, now one of the chief examiners m the U. S. Patent Office. Diagram No. 2, taken also from Lieut. G. M. Bache's observations, shows the character of the curve of distribution near the axis of the Gulf Stream. These particular results were obt~ineиl in one of the positions on the Cape Henry section, in latitude 35░ 53' N., and longitude 73░ 34' \Y. The prnjecting form of the curve towards 300 fathoms, and the moderate change of temperature, ten degrees, from 150 to 400 fathoms, shown in that diao-ram are characteristic features of the distriliution in similar positions. The chano-e t?om the surface to 150 fathoms was 17░ Fahrenheit. Diagram No. 3 represents a co~responding curve to No. 2,

from Lieut. Maffitt's observations on t11e Charleston section, in latitude 33░ 58' N., longitude 73░ 581 W. In this the change between 100 and 400 fathoms is still less than in the former case, being but five degrees. Diagram No. 3 bis shows the curve corresponding to that of diagram No. 1, but on the Charleston section nearer to the''Shore than the axis of the stream in latitude 31░ 48' N., longitude 78░ 47' W .и 2. Distribution oJ:iemperature at the same depth, on section,~ perpendicidar to the axis of the Gulf Stream. и Diagram No. 4 contains the results of obsenations on the section perpendicular to the stream from Sandy Hook, and showR the mode in which the observations were discussed. The positions whw:~ the temperatures were ohserveu are markeu at the head of the diagram, and above them the distance frnm Sandy Hook in nautical miles. The temperatures are marked on the side of the diagram. At each position a diagram was drawn similar to those of Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and from the curves traced with a free hand among the points, the results at the several depths, which are shown on diagram No. 4. were obtained. The curves traced among these points ao as to preserve as far as possible consistent- results for the various depths, are those given in the diagram. In the vreliminary discussion of the results, I used the observations then ~elves at the different depths, and am, therefore, enabled to say, that while the curves pre& '1t fewer irregularities by the last mode of discm;sion, as might be expected, the general results arc not in any essential particular changed by its adoption. 'fhe diagram shows the curve of distribution of temperature at thirteen different depths from the surface to five hundred fathoms. The depths at which observations were taken were the more numerous nearer the surface, where the changes of temperature were the most rapid. These curves were next separated into groups, following the arrangement which seemed best to apply to the sections generally. On the Sandy Hook section, for example, as shown in diagram No. 5, the results from the surface to 30 fathoms, from 40 to 100 fathoms, at 200 and 300 fathoms, are grouped respectively in the curves n, o, and p, and that for 400 fathoms is given in curve 1и. The point where the axis of the Gulf Stream, or line of highest temperature, is cut by the section, is distinctly shown on the diagram, and the minimum of temperature or "cold wall" within thirty miles of it, nearer the shore. These are the prominent features in every case. Further from shore than the axis of the stream, the Sarnly Hook curves show one point of maximum and two }JOints of minimum temperature. In the comparatively cold water of the in-shore counter-current, two maximum points and one minimum are also distinctly marked. This diagram is in fact a general type of the results according to which the ocean in and near the Gulf Stream is divided into successive warmer and colder bands. The number and the general arrangement of them can, of course, only be ~'lde out hy a comparison of the several sections. In the discussion, such a diagram was drawn for each section. The curves of diagram No. 5 do not at all indicate at what depths the temperature would approach to equality across the section. The corresponding results for the Cape Henry section are shown in diagram No. 6 bis. The first or '' cold wall'' minimum, the axis maximum, two minima and two maxima beyond the axis, are well made out in all the groups for the surface to four hundred fathoms. The mean of the results at O, 5, 10, 20, and 30 fathoms, is shown by the curve n; that of 50, 70, 100, and 150 fathoms, by o; and of 200, 300, and 400 fathoms, bys. Not to multiply diagrams too much, I have omitted those for Hatteras and Cape Fear, which, besides, have nothing very especially characteristic in them, unless it may be that the Hatteras section is one where the results arc most disturbed. The next diagram, No. 7, shows the results of the Charleston section. The groups m, n, and o, from 5 and. 10 fathoms, 20 and 30 fathoms, and 20, 30, and 50 fathoms, resemble each other very much; p, the mean of 70, 100, and 150 fathoms, is slightly irregular; and so is r, the 400 fathoms curve. The curves from 5 to 50 fathoms show extremely well the division of the stream, the first or "cold wall" minimum, the first, second, and third maxima, and the second and third minima. In-shore, from the first minimum, is a maximum. 'rhe irregularities in these observations, though obtained with registering instruments at such considerable depth'1, are less than those which stationary thermometers, sunk in the ground, show in the passage of heat to them. Diagram No. 8 represents the Canaveral sectionи, where the same results which haw been

158*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

stated are shown, but on a very much diminished scale. The observations were not carried far enough from the shore to reach the second maximum. The first and second minima and the axis maximum are well marked. I have omitted, for reasons already stated, the diagrams of the other sections. The same phenomena are in general repeated in all the sections. The permanency of the division of the stream in different years, ll,nd the accuracy and sufficiency of the observations, may be teRted in two ways: the first by comparitig the results of running the same section in different years by different observers; the second by the consistency or inconsistency of the results obtained at one depth when compared with those at other depths. In order to compare the results of different years, some one section w~ to be explored in the successive seasons. Thus the Cape Henry section connected the work of Lieuts. G. M. Bache, S. P. Lee, and R. Bache, having been explored by each. The Hatteras section was common to the work of Lieuts. R. Bache and J. N. Maffitt, and the same Charleston section was intended to be run by Lieuts. Maffitt and Craven. The Cape Henry section was three times run over; and it appears, by comparing the results of each season with the mean of the whole, that in each group of observations represented by one of the curves of diagram No. fi, there is an uncertainty of rather less than seven miles in the determination of the maxima and minima generally. The best determined points are the first and second minima and maxima-the" cold wall" minimum and axis maximum having an average probable error of 5! miles, and the other three points have an average probable error of eight miles. This accorclance is satisfactory whether viewed in relation to the probability of recognising the band in passing through it, or in reference to the determination of the positions of the observations themselves, or to the distances apart of the positions. Diagram No. 6 represents in different colors the results of three years' observations on the Cape Henry section, showing, with differences which might be expected, the same general division of the stream. The observations were made during the summer season, partly for nautical reasons, and also as giving a nearer approach to equilibrium than the winter. The differences in the temperature of the whole mass of water at the same season of different years are onen more considerable than the difference in distribution. The second test of the probable accuracy of determination of the several principal maxima and minima was by a comparison of the independent determination of the maximum and minimum points in the curves of distribution at the same depth, corresponding to various depths from the surface. It was first established, by a general induction, that aU the points of maximum and minimum, except the "cold wall" minimum and axis maximum, are pr~ably, as a rule, vertically over each other. Next the curve was found, by which the recession of the first minimum and maximum from the shore, as the depth increased, could be represented. The differences then, from the mean curve of reces11ion, for the first two points, and from the vertical line or average position for the other points, gave the probable discrepancy of determination. It would be out of place here to give all these la-bored details. This discussion gives, as might be expected, smaller probable errors than the other; for this takes in accidental errors only, and that includes real changes. The mean probable error of determination of the first four points from this investigation was for Cape Henry section, for the mean of the three years, one mile; and of the other three points rather more than two miles. This includes three determinations, of which each result is the average. The corresponding results for all the sections are given in Table No. 1, and show on the average less than one mile of uncertainty for the mean determination of the :first or "cold wall" minimum; two miles and a half for the :first or axis maximum, and the second minimum between them; and four miles for the next three points, and about eight and a half for the fourth minimum, which was shown on but three of the sections.

The Hatteras section presents, as before remarked, the most considerable discrepancies in its results, incident, most probably, to the nature of the phenomena themselves in that region. 3. Connection of the figure of the bottom of the sea with the distribution of temperature. The discovery that soundings could be carried nearly across the Charleston section of the Gulf Stream, and that after losing them on this section for a short distance they were reached beyond the axis of the stream, was communicated to the Association at the Cvveland meeting, as resulting from the observations ofLieuts. J. N. Maffitt and T. A. Oraten, U. S. N., assistants in the Coaиst Survey. The connection between the figure of the bottom and the division of the stream, which the observations of these officers established as applicable to the sections south of Charleston, is illustrated in diagram No. 9, iu which the curves of equal temperature, the depths corresponding to them, and the figure of the bottom, are given. In the diagram the distances from the shore are marked in nautical miles on the top, as also the positions at which the temperatures were explored; and the depths in fathoms are stated on the left-hand side. Each curve is marked with the temperature (by Fahrenheit's scale) which it indicates, and the curves are drawn for ev&y five degrees from 57░ to 77░ Fahrenheit. The bottom of the sea slopes gradually on this section for some fifty miles, reaching a depth of about twenty fathoms; then more rapidly to about sixty-five miles, ~nd the depth of one hundred fathoms; and suddenly falling off to a depth greater than six hundred fathoms-at about one hundred miles from the shore, where the depth is three hundred fathoms, a ridge, with a very steep slope on the inshore side, and a little less so to seaward, occurring fifteen hundred feet above the hollow to seaward of it, and distant about twelve miles from it. A second rise of five hundred feet, on a base of twelve miles, is followed by a depression of three hundred feet on a base of fifteen miles, and then by a gentle slope upward. It is altogether probable that all the depths found by observation are greater than the actual ones; but the bottom was brought up in several cases, showing that the lead had reached it, and it is most probable that the proportions are not far from correct. The close conformity of the curves of temperature to those of the bottom is obvious from an inspection of the diagram. The descent of the curve of 57░ in the deepest part of the section is a remarkable feature, not obliterated in the curves above it, but reaching nearly to the surface. In the midst of general coincidences there is one discrepancy which indicates that there may be other causes which produce the distribution of temperature in warm and cold bands besides the figure of the bottom. Further observations will show if this is so, or if it is an error of observation. We see in this diagram the cold water pressing towards the shore-side, following the

160*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

form of the bottom along which it lies, and forcing the layers above it to take the same general conformation. On the crest of the steep slope in the St. Simon's section there is a forcing up of the cold water to a considerable height, as is shown less distinctly at position No. 1 of the Charleston diagram. This corresponds to the "cold wall" in tlmse sections. \Vhether this remarkable discovery may be the clue to the gfneral distribution of temperature in the Gulf Stream, on the deeper sections north of these,,,,js well wortb;~xamining, and instructions have been given accordingly. '""!'' 4. The "Cold Tf'all." It is difficult to fix the de1)th of the Gulf Stream current, though easy to see, from the observations, that it is comparatively superficial, extending certainly,,;29n the Charleston section for example, to a less depth than three hundred to five hundred fathoms, and resting upon cold water belonging to a much higher latitude than that in which it is found. Off Cape Florida, about twelve nautical miles cast from the light-house, at the depth of 550 fathoms, the temperature was but 49░ ,Fahrenheit in June, 1853. 'fhc mean temperature of the col1lest month in the year, on the coast in the same latitude with the point of the axis of the Gulf Stream at the surface on the Charleton section, is about 53!░ Fahrenheit. At Key '\Vest the mean temperature of the coldest month of the year is, from the report of the Surgeon General U. S. Army, 69.3░. Deep-sea temperatures of the ocean generally, are required for determining this aml other questions of a similar kind. The lateral limits of the stream are more easily defined, especially in the northern sections, wliere the change is so sudden from the warm water of the Gulf to the cold stream inside of it towards the shore, that the cold stream was likened, by l.ieut. Geo. M. Bache, to a "cold wall" confining the warm water., The diagrams of the Sandy Hook sections, Nos. IV and V, show this sudden change very strikingly between positions 13 and 14, the probable minimum lying, however, inside of 13. So, also, the Cape Henry diagrams, Nos. VI and VI bis. The" cold waU" minimum and axis maximum are shown on diagram X, on the same scale of miles at the top of the diagram, and temperature at the side. That the "cold wall" exists south of Hatteras is proved by the same diagram, where the Cape Fear, Charleston, and St. Simon's sections are compared with those for Cape Henry, Cape May, and Sandy Hook. The difference of temperature is less for the southern sections, but it is still strikingly marked. In the cold water inshore from the Gulf Stream, Acting Master Jones, of Lieut. Maffitt's party, found a current setting southward, as also in the cold band outside of the axis. These results, if Hhown to he permanent, will be in the hir:rhest degree important. As it is, the existence of them at any time shows the cause of ~any anomalies noticed by navigators.in relation to the currents of the Gulf Stream. The investigations relating to currents remain to be m1tdc in detail, though some results have already been procured. It is important in work like this to confine the special attention of obscrYers to a faw problems at a time, that they may receive close examination. As the warm water of the Gulf Stream flows onward and outward from the axis at and near the surface, the i;tratum, as a general rule, becomes thinner. The current is then outward from the axis as well as onward. 5. The changes of the position of the remarkable points in the sections with the season, and other circumstances, are undergoing investigation, some results having been already collected. 6. Chart of the Gulf Stream. The alternate bands of warm and cold water into which the ocean in and near the Gulf Stream is divided, are shown in the chart now presented, as deduced from the discussion ali:ead~и referred to_. 'fhe higher temperatures are represented by the darker shades. The axis of the stream is marked by the darkest full line, and the axis of the colder and warmer bands on each sid~ of it by thinner lines, distinguished as stated on the chart. The axis marked A, :vhere it crosses the Sandy Hook section, is seen to take the general direction of the trend of the coa~t, which is even more closely followed by the "cold wall" axis, which cr~sscs the S~ndy Hook section at B. These lines are drawn with a free hand among the pornts hy wl~ich they wou~d be rigidly determined in the several sections, so as to give a general consistency to their form. The variations from the points rigidly determined are gen~rally of t~e same order with the probable errors of those points. On the Sandy Hook section the pomt D corresponds to the second minimum temperature, C to the second max-

Report of Charles A. Schott, Esq., of the Oomp11ting Dfrisirm U. S. Coast Survey, on the currents of J..Yantucket Sltoals. (Sketch A, No. 12.)
CoAST 8nffn OFFICE, July 18, 1834. Srn: I respectfully suun1it the result of my imиestig-ation of the currents on Nantucket shoals. In a preliminar!и report, elated April 18, 1t::5и1, reference was made to the stations and ohscrrntion availahle for thii; di~cussion, awl C'\'rtain localities were pointed out which it waH desiraLle to haYc occupied for farther obscrnitions. The olrnt'rflttions were malh' during the months uf .Tuly and Aug11st, between 1846 ancl ]853, inclusive; alHl the results consequently rcfor to this period of the ~иear. vVith but a few exceptiom, the surface-current was obscrYed; and when otherwise, the directions and velocity of the under-current was identical with that at the surface. The stations are m;merous enongh to iwint out the general features of the current, except in the northeast quarter of the shoals. The extension of the observations (if practicable) in all directions beyond tl1e limits of the sketch, is deRirable for the following reasons: to ascertain the extent of the tidal current further out at sea ; to trace its connection with the currents of the adjacent sounds and bays, and to furnish valuable additional information for tracing the co-tidal lines, yet very iru11erfectly umlerstood in this locality; and, lastly, to ascertain its own limits.* It seems proba1le to me that a region may he found, towards w11ich the flood conYerg-es, similar to that near the Rtraits of Dover. The flood in the case of the Nantucket rnrrents comes from the southwest, but is likely to meet with another flood current off Cape Cod, coming fro~ the north. As a general result of the discussion of these currents, I find that, except near Old South shoal, there appears to lie a tendency of the current, during the period of its greatest velocity, to run 1iarallel with the m:~jor axis of the shoals. On the Old South shoal, the tendency is across the shonl. In considering the sul\ject, the following subdivisions were found convenient: A. The general nature of the currents. B. The general direction of the tidal current of flood or ebb. 0. 'l'he direction or set at each station, and results. D. The velocity at each station, an<l results. E. 'rhe "establishment" of the current. F. Investigation of the path described by any 11article of water during the i1eriod of flood and ebb. A. A glance at the ol1servations shows the current to be a tidal c1trrent, reversing its direction every six lunar hours, without, however, exhibiting any slack water. There are no indieations of any current running permanently in the same direction, as appears from the comparison of the average velocities during ebb and floo<l; the <lifference of which would be twice its rate in that direction. The velocities perpendicular to it (durin"" the 0 1>eriod called slack-water) are also sensibly the same. The general features of the current across the Ahoals are as follows : The ebb commencrs a short time before the high-water stand on the shore of Nantucket takes place, and runR a little to the eastward of south, with no indications of slack-water. It then attains, graduDEAR

ally, its greate8t velocity in a direction to the westward and southward. After this the current slackens, the minimum velocity being about one-fourth the maximum velocity, and runs a little to the westward of north, and then in an opposite direction to that of the ebb; thrni completing an rntirc circuit. The current may be observed to set inJJ,11 directions of the compass during twelve lunar hours without ever 1Jeing at rest, and turning in a direction in wиhich we count our azimuths. or like the hands of a watch.* J~. 'l'hc direction of the current at the tiu'1e of its greatest velocity being nearly parallel with the shore-line, presents an exception to the general rule of the flood current running inland, and peqJendicular to the shore. 'rlie time midway between the ending of the floocl and beginning of ebb, corresponding to the time of slack-water at high water, is generally identical, or may be supposed to be the same as the time of the middle of stand at hi;?;h water; but on the shoals, a difference, amounting, at the greatest, to two houn;, is observed, by ~which the horizontal motion precedes the vertical. The current obserYed shortly after the above period must be the ebb; and by comparing the direction of the current at the time of high water for all the current stations near the Hhore, it was found from seven stations, within five miles of the shore, and occupied in 1847-'48-'49, that the ebb runs to the westward and southward. High water was computed from the known tidal establishments at Wasque 9h. 19m., n.t Siasconsett llh. 54m., and at Great Point Light 1271. 4m. Cases have been observed where the Ramc current is a flood current for one end of a channel, and an ehh current for the opposite one, along the same shore, of which Bristol channel is an example. C. The direction of the current at the time of maximum velocity remains nearly constant. for three hours, or does not deviate more than a1Jout 20░ from it; but little difficulty was therefore met in finding the ayerage direction of either flood or ebb. The direction is indicated by an angle counted like the geocletic azimuths, and has been corrected, when necessary, for 9░ of westerly magnetic declination. To ascertain the variation in the direction. it was first made out for successive tides; next, for the same locality at different times; ancl,lastly, for the same time at places a small distance apart. It appears that the two lm;t cases show a greater deviation from the mean direction than the first, and that no direction can be relied upon within 15░, or at the most 30░. The mean direction for flood and ebh was made out for each station and plotted on the accompanying sketch. A table was also formed of these values, separating them into two groups, a northern one and a southern one; in each group the directions differ so little, that means could be taken. (Ree line of separation of groups on the sketch running to the southwarcl and eastward from Siasconsett.) и 'fhc mean set of the flood in the northern group is 212░. The mean Ret of the ebb in the northern group is 27░ ; deviating from a straight line 5░. The mean set of the flood in the southern group is 257░. The mean set of the ebb in the southern group is 74░; deviation from a straight line 0░. Hence flood awl eblJ nm in exactly opposiro directions, and form an angle of 46░ in the two groups. The mean direction has heen illustrated graphically by curves drawn at convenient distances for the flood and for the ebb. (See the sketch and notes of explanation accompanying !t.) It iR only near Davis' Sonth shoal that the flood and ebb directions disagree sensibly. A table of directions iA appended to this, marked No. 1. The direction at the period called slack-water is 90░ to the above, and lasts about an hour. 'rhe influence of the wind on the mean direction and velocity is small, as the obBervations were made in moderate weather. I?и ~'~e velocity when near the maximum changes but little, and it was found that th~ vanab1hty _at tho same station at different periods is about▒ 0.5 knot. The mean maximum ve~ocit): lrnH lieen tabulated for each station, (see table append~d, No. 2,) and is expressed m .miles per hour, written opposite the head of the arrows m the sketch. It was found, by mspection, that the velocity increases with the distance from Nantucket, and that there is a marked difference in the drift when we divide the space by a circular line of allout

eighteen miles radius, with its centre at Siasconsett, the outer portion showing the greater velocity. The grouping of the stations has heeu made accordingly, (see curve on sketch.)* The mean drift of the inner group is !Lt ebb 1. 7, and at flood 1. 7 knots; for the outer group at ehh 2.2, and at flood 2.8 knots, respectively. The velocity at ehh and flood appears to be nearly the same) with the average maximum value of 1. 7 for the inner, and 2.5 for the outer group. The greatest velocity observed was four knots in 1852, (August 2,) on the southern part of Fishing Rip. The velocity during the turn of the current is, before the beginning of the ehb, 0.6 (mean value from 47 cases,) and licfore the flood 0.5 (mean value from 50 cases;) it is seldom less than 0. 3, nor more than 0.8, in the extreme 0.0, and 1.4 miles an hour. E. The current establishment was made ont in the same way a8 in my inveRtigation of the Long Island Sound currents, with the additional values resulting from the tlood current by adding six lunar hours; thus the number of results for luni current intervals has almost been doubled. The variation of this interval at any given station is greater than the monthly inequality of the tides; this correction, however, has been ap1,lied to the mean value for each station, assuming it to he the same for the curreuts and tidcl'l. This correction amounts, at the greatest, to▒ 22 m. for either Bmiton or New York. Intervals for stations not more than five or ten miles a1)art have all been united in one result, and in this way more reliable mean values have been obtained for this variable element. 'l'he observations have been grouped considering the number of intervals observed and of geographical positions, and are given in Appendix Ko. 3. The groupR were separated on the sketch, which contains all the individual luni-current intenrals, ancl from those giving the means of groups. The following table contaim these last results:

From the above table the co-current lines on the sketch haYe been constructed. Joining the pot!itions by straight lines and marking the intersection of the half and whole hours on each of them, positions for the co-current lines were obtained. The northern branch of the Xi hour curve* is very uncertain from want of observations. On Davis' South shoal the establishment appears to be XIIh. 25m., or twelve hours twenty-five minutes; after the moon's superior or inferior transit, the ebb current commences to set in. This was the information asked for in the Superintendent's letter of November 25, 1853. It is a singular fact, that the period of so-called slack-water at the beginning of ebb, occurs earlier on the middle of the shoals than near Davis' South shoal, although the ebh runs to the westward and southward. The uncertainty in any of these half-hour lines is about ten minutes. This I have indicated by the width of the curves corresponding to lOm. F. The idea of following any given particle of water, as suggested by Mr. Wiessncr, may be carried out, either by following actually its course during the period of twelve lunar hours, or by observing a number of such particles at every stage of this period, all particles following the same law of motion. The latter view suits the observations. I have assumed the time of middle of turn before ebb to start with, and referred the

motion to two axes of co-ordinates, one parallel with the direction of the maximum иvelocity, the other perpendicular to it. The length of either axis was obtained by treating it as a simple dynamical problem, the time or duration, and the direction and velocity, being given. The mean orbit, as may be supposed from the preceding investigation, varies only in it;; major axis, the velocity during the turns being unchangeable for both groups of velocity. I found it best to work the problem trigonometrically, using the table of natural sines and co-sines. It cannot, however, be extended to many stations without commming much time; nor is this necessary. As a general result, I find tlie length of the axis major for the outer group (of velocitieR) about nine nautical miles, and for the inner six miles; the minor axis of one and a half miles being the same for both. The following values for the length of the axis in consecutive tides were obtained from obscnations near Old South shoal:

Hence, for the mean length of the axes 8. 7 miles, and 1.3 miles at this station. The above small value (0.8) of the minor axis, when compared with 1.8, may indicate a northwesterly current ; but I do not feel justified in concluding so from the small number of observations. The path in this case would be as indicated in the figure No. 2, Sketch A No. 12, and the velocity of the current 0.5 mile an hour. .A similar curve is produced when the direction of flood is not exactly opposite to that of ebb, as appears from figure No. 3. Some of the stations present such a case. The path described by a particle of water in rivers generally will be represented by figure No. 4, Sketch .A No. 12. The ratio of the axes for the Nantucket Shoal current is 1 : 6, or for stations within eighteen miles from the shore, as 1 : 4. The velocity and direction remain nearly constant for one hour about the time of turn, and for three hours about the middle of flood and ebb. This subject, headed F, might Btill further be pursued, if I did not fear to transgress 1>ractical limits. There is one obvious practical result, however, to be mentioned. A ve,ssel cannot be set on any of the shoals by the current al,one, if its distance from it exceeds the length of the maJor axis of motion. For the details of the results in this report, see a volume deposited in the archives. Very respectfully, yours,

Di8cus&ion of Current8 in Muskeget channel and off the northeast coast of Martha's Vineyard,
by Charles .A. Schott.
COMPUTING DrvISroN, C. S. OFFICE, .August 11, 1854. DEAR Sm: The following report on the result of my investigation of the currents in Muskeget channel and off the northeast coast of Martha's Vineyard is respectfully submitted. The immediate purpose of this discussion was to furnish notes for theи charts now engraving. The observations show the current to be a tidal current, and were made when the influence Qf the wind was inconsiderable. The results refer to the surface, no observations being made uelow. Th~ number of stations in this locality is fifteen, (see accompanying sketch,) and were occupied as follows:

1 by 1 by 2 by 2 by 9 by

Lieut. Chas. H. Davis in 1846, L~eut. Chas. H. Davis in 1847, L~eut. :M. Woodhull in 1851, Lieut. Chas. H . .McBlair in 1852, Lieut. M. Woodhull in 1852,

}
In the months of July and August.

The positionA of the aboYc fifteen stations, e~l'.CC}lt six and seven are plotted on hydrographic charts Nos. 222 and 239. '

Oeneral direction of the ebb.-In Muskeget channel the ebb runs to tbe seaward, and in the sound off the nurthe11,st coast of the island the ebb sets toward the west. :From Edgartown harbor the ebb runs into the sound. Course and rate of flood and ebb currents.-In the following tahlc the \ set and drift of the tidal current is giYen at the middle between slackwater and maximum ebb or first quarter; the maximum ebb : the middle between the maximum ebb and next following slack or third quarter, and similarly for the flood. These periods arc designated by the first quarter, the maximum ebb, the second quarter; the first quarter of flood, the maximum flood, the third quarter; and arc represented as shown by the figure-the full arrow-heads indicating the flood, and the half the ebb and turn, the number of dots indicating the quarters. The velocity, as usual, stands at the head of the arrow. In the table of the courses the direction is expressed in degrees, counted like azimuths, from south round by the west. (See my report f on Nantucket Shoal currents.) The directions, when necessary, were corrected for 9░ westerly magnetic declination. On account of the connection with the lnni-current intervals, the table commences with the ebb stream. The first column contains the numbers designating the stations as used in the discussion and marked down on the sketch. 'I'he second column contains the numbers as found in the books of observation, and ginn by the observers; the other columns are explained by the above.

From Nos. 2, 3, 4, of the above table, we obtain the mean direction of ebb and flood in Muskeget channel proper 7░ S. (7░ W.) and 203░ (N. 23░ E.); and from Nos. 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, for the sound, 114░ (Vl. 24░ N.) and 267░ (E. 3░ N.) It will be observed that the course of ebb and flood is not exactly in opposite directions, but more than 180░ in the channel, and less in the sound, tending to produce the mean direction in the Nantucket sound. The ebb setting 24░ to the northward of west in the eastern ell trance to Martha's Vineyard sound, changes its direction to the southward after it }lasses Nobska. и Velocity of current. The mean maximum drift at ebb is 1.6 knots, at floml 1.6 knots. During the time of turn, the current comes to an absolute stand or slack at all the stations. T11c waxiu1um rate ob╗erved, 3.2 knots, waro off Weit Chop, where the sound narrows.

Corrections for the moon's parallax and declination should also be applied, but the tidal discussions near this locality are not yet sufficiently advanced to furnish data. No other corrections need be applied. The current establishments will finally be referred to the Greenwich meridian, and to a certain transit of the moon (yet to lw ascertained by the discussion of tides;) they will then compare with the tidal establishments. An attempt was made to construct co-current lines, but the area covered by the discussion was found too limited for the purpose. Co-current lines, and lines for direction, may be presented at some future time. The establishment at No. 2 disagrees very much with the rest, and further observations outside of Martha's Vineyard arc required.

Repoiиt on the Tidal Currents of Long Island Sound and appYoaclws: by Charles A. Schott.
CoAST StrRYEY OFFICE, April 28, 1853, (re-written in April, 1854.) Srn: The study of the current phenomena, as useful to the mariner as it is interestmg to the scientific inquirer, became of additional interest, in this particular locality, from the fact that the sound is accessible to the ocean currents both at its eastern and western. entrances, and. from advantages that rnay result to navigation in this much frequented region from a more complete understanding of the motion of its waters. In order to fully understand the current, it is essential to consider the horizontal as well as the ve:tical mo:ion of 1my pa~ticle, or the tidal. currents proper, or ebb and flood stream, and the tides, or rtlile and fall. rheiH~ are the hon:,i;ontal and vertical cemponentlil.

To distinguish currents running always nearly in the same direction from such as revcrne their motion, governed by the effects of the lunar and 1;;olar attraction, the latter have received the name of tidal currents, and such is the nature of those in Long Island imund ; though an almost imperceptible current setting towards the sea (the discharge of the riverwator) can barely be tracHl. The knmrn rise and fall of the tides wi11 furnish the na\'igator with the means of adapting his.soundings to the level of reference of his chart; generally, the mean low-water and known set and drift will guide him in his course. The great tidal wave from the Atlantic enters the sound between Point Judith and Montauk Point, divided into two branches by the intermediate position of Block island; and another portion of this wave enters New York bay, and, passing through Hell Gate, meets the wave propagated through the sound from the иastward. It was a matter of importance and interest to know the place of meeting and the limit of variation of these opposite waves. The material for this investigation was furnished from the observations of currents and tides by the officers of the survey under your instructions; the former commenced.in 1844 and continued to '48, the latter dating further back. The range of the tide, or the mean vertical motion, the epoch of the tide, as shown by the co-tidal lincs,and the direction of the flood or ebb stream, together with certain lines depending on the epoch of the horizontal motion, presently to be explained, furnish us with as many separate means for determining the locality of the meeting of the eastern and western wave. Under these different points of view, we can arrive with a very close approximation at the motion of the water throughout the sound. Considering first the mean or average range, we observe that in a regular, straight., or slightly curved channel, of nearly the same profile, and accessible from both sides, opposite waves will produce the greatest range where they meet, this being equal to the sum of the ranges at the entrances: and in cases where the channel towards the head is wedge-shaped, this range will be still further increased proportionally to the contraction of the profile. At 1\fontauk the mean range is 2.0 feet, and at Sandy Hook 4.8 feet; and from the narrowing of the sound the greatest range observed is one foot more than the sum, or 7.8 foet. From a tal1le of observations of ranges. (see Tahfo No. 1,) at nineteen stations, a chart has been constructed, exhibiting the lines of eriual mean range for each half foot of change. (See Sketch B, No. 2, diagram No. 1.) The line of the maximum range, hy this chart, is off Sand's Point, and the most rapid increase occurs in the passage through Hell Gate. Following next the co-tidal lines constructed from a table of mean luni-tidal intervals observed at twenty-three stations, (see Table No. 2,) and following up the channel-ways from both entrances, the crossing of the lines of the same hour will indicate the place of meeting of the opposite waves, or the point where the high water takes place latest in time. To the eastward or westward of it, high water occurs sooner. The co-tidal lines (see same Sketch, diagram No. 2) were constructed for local times, answering the purpose when tl1e difference in time for the extent of the chart is nearly twel Ye minutes. Owing to the want of a sufficient number of observations, the co-tidal lines for the western portion of the chart could not be traced, and the 7~ hour and 8 hour lines, near Block island, are uncertain ; there is, however, material enough to point out Hewlett's Point as the position of the latest tides with the hour XIh. 22m. At l\fontauk we had VIIIh. lOm., and at Sandy Hook Vllh. 31m. The observations cannot be considered as closed, and a further accumulation of data will enable us to construct more complete charts and predict the currents and tides with much more precision than is at present possible. 'l'hc actually observed direction of the flood and ebb stream, or the direction of the current immediately following or preceding the low or high water, however, will best point out the headwaters of the sound. To the eastward and westward of Throg's Neck the currents have thus been found to flow in opposite directions. From the above we conclude that the tides meet near Hewlett's Point as the mean position, and that the variable limits are Sancl's Point and 'fhrog's Neck, a few miles to the eastward and westward of it. The semi-mensual and diurnal inequality, together with the action of the wind, produce these changes. 'rhe currents proper may be considered under the following three heads : The direction and velocity, or set and drift, and the time at any given stage of the stream. 22и

REPORT Ol' THE SUPERINTENDENT

A chart was constructed exhibiting the lines of direction for the ebb or outgoing stream, (see Table No. B, and the curves in diagram No. 1,) when at its greatest velocity; this chart was also found to answer fur the flood or ingoing stream, the set differing nearly 180░. These curves of direction are perhaps the most meful to the mariner. They follow the channel, or are nearl~и parallel to the shores. Tlwy were drawn equidistant as far as the observations and locality would admit of, and the velocity in miles per hour is wri.tten in figures against the Jllaces of observation. If the observations had been more numerous, the better method of varying the distance of the lines inversely 1iroportional to the velocity, according to a definite scale, would have been preferable. The latter representation, proposed by yourself, was used for other charts of the survey. Following any of the cunes of direction, the change in velocity may be seen by inspection. It is, however, not to be supposed.that a floating body would be carried throughout the length of any of the lines, as the reverse motion, after about six hours' duration, would restore it to nearly its original position. It appears, from the accompanying table, (see Table No. 3,) that the velocity of the flood stream was a little less than that of the ebb, caused by the discharge of the river-water in the sound. The more remarkable velocities were found as follows: 4. 7 knots in the Race, (opposite the west end of Fisher's island,) 5. 9 knots in Hell Gate, 3. 7 knots on an average in New York harbor, and 3.0 in the bay. 2.2 knots is the average drift in Long Island sound. The drift is a function of the size of the section of the channel, and the quantity of water to be discharged through it. The total number of current stations used in the discussion, ancl extending over the sound and New York bay and harbor, was seventy-five, occupied, generally, for thirteen houri; each. The time of turn, or the epoch of the current, occurring shortly after high water, is the last datum required to be known in order to predict the currents as we now do the tides. This I have attempted to ascertain by taking the intervals of time of the moon's superior or inferior transit, and the time of the middle of slack-water, at, or immediately following the high-water stand. It must be observed that it is by no means uncommon to perceive horizontal motion during the time of stand, or vertical motion during the time of slackwater. '.I.'he interval just spoken of I call luni-current interval, analogous to luni-tidal interval, and the mean of these luni-current intervals gives the mean establishment of the tidal current, (see Table No. 4 :) thus, by uniting all the places of the same current establishment by lines, co-current lines will be obtained. These lines may be regarded as corresponding to the co-tidal lines. The epoch of the beginning of the ebb stream for these curves (see diagram No. 2) was chosen for the purpose of a more ready comparison with the co-tidal lines, the difference indicating how much sooner or later one or the other of the motions commences, or the difference in time between the middle of stand and the middle of slack-water, imI)1ediately preceding the ebb stream. The duration of the slackwater, both for the ebb and flood streams, and the duration of either, is given in Table No. 5, so that the condition of the current at any given time may easily be inferred, the process being precisely similar to that employed for predicting tides. No current stations have as yet been occupied during the whole of a lunation, but to arrive at any of the inequalities of the tidal currents in this way appears to me less preferable. The corrections may 1mfely be taken as found, from the inequalities of the tides. '.I.'hesc lines disclose some remarkable features. First, their general tendency to run parallel to the channel or shore, arising from the more rapid propagation of the waV'C in deep water; secondly, the motion of the water after the high-water ~tand commences-first near the shore, and last in the channel-way. The current establishments have been given in the table from which the co-current lines have been constructed. The instant of the beginning of the ebb stream (mean slack-water) was chosen for the epc:ch. It was not deemed necessary to refer the times to one meridian. Taking means of !hese luni-current intervals of stations near mid-channel, I found the hour between Block island a.nd the Race, from eight stations, XIh. 33m. ; in the middle of the sound, (widest part,) from seven stations, XIIh.; near the head of the sound, from ten stations, XIIh. 38m. The number of observations at each station range from one to three, taken in different years. In New York bay we have, from thirteen stations VIIIh. 20m. In New York harbor, from three stations IX 29 In Hell Gate, from ten stations IX 33 Between Hell Gate and Throg's Neck, from five stations 41

Showing a remarkably 8low propagation between Hell Gate and Hewlett'R Point, w11ich iR accounted for below. The mean nncertaint_\и in the ahoYc figures i8 shown in Table Ko. fi, aml iR fonnll not greater than the irregularities of the tides from a prior consideration would indicate. The ebb stream at the eastern entrance commences three hours later than at the western entrance, although the tideF differ but one hnur at J\Iontauk and Randy Hook. At halfebb tide, the water in the channel of J\fontauk Point lJegins to nm out; and before twothinls of the elib tide is completed, the water in the channel at the head of the snund begins its outward motion. The phenomenon is similar in N cw York ba:;, where the ebb stream be~6m its motiou at one-sixth of il1e e11l1 tide; but at tbe head cast of Hell Gate, the ebb Rtream is not perceptible till the tide at the entrance of the hay is almost reversed, or at five-sixths of the ebb ti,le. Lines showing theиlevcl of the surface of the Round at any Rtagc of the tides, may he conRtructecl with the aid of the co-tidal lines anJ. the curves of mean equal range. As already indicated, the water Legi1rn its motion first nearest the shore, and not until a considerable time has elapsed in the channel. 'l'hc X, XJ, and XII-hour CUJTes of the co-current lines near the Hacc, on both sides of the sound, are in this reRpect particularly interesting. The knowledge of this is made arnilable by vessels navigating this part of the sound, and the ear lier or later Retting in of the currents is known to the local pilots. In mid-channel, throughout the sound, the outward motion commences shortly after the high water at the head of the souncl, and evidently <lependR upon it, though it cannot be recognised west of Throg"s Keck, on account of the disturbing influence of the rocky and narrow passage through Hell Gate. The following practical note in reference to the eastern portion of the souncl is deduced from theRe observations : The cnrrentR commence running a1ong the northern and Routhern shores of the eastern part of the sound at various interrnlR from one to two hours before running in the channel. The cnrrentR along the shore, between New Haven and New London, are earlier by one hour than between Fisher's island and Point Judith, making, in all, a difference of two and a quarter hours between the fir1<t-named places, and of one and a quarter hour between the last named and the beginning of the motion in the channel. The currents through the entrances formed by Block island begin to run simultaneously, and about one hour earlier than in the Race. The ebb through Plum Gut lasts about two hours longer, and the flood so much shorter, than at otluиr }Jlaces in the vicinity. To find the time of slack-water at the beginning of the flood, add the duration of the ebb stream (which is given in Tahle No. 6) to the luni-current interval. The duration of the ebb stream at the entrance, middle, or head of the sotmdиappears to be the same, and this holds good for the duration of the slack-water. Taking means, I obtain for the eastern entrance, the middle aml head of the sound, the duration as follows: 6h. 34m., 6h. 38m., 6h. 03m. for the ebb, and 6h. 08m., 6h. 08m., 5h. 48m. for the flood, and 5, 3, and 16 minutes for the slack-water. All the remarks and deductions refer to the surface current. The motion in any given vertical section appears to begin first near the surface; but shortly after, the velocity is nearly the same throughout the whole depth. '!'here appears to be no difference in the direction of the stream at or below the surface. I had proceeded thus far in the investigation, when you suggested to me the attempt to ascertain how far the circumstances of propagation of the current could be explained by the mean depth of the sound. This I have attempted in the following investigation, which greatly facilitates the construction of the time curves, and thus aids in the prediction of the tides for places where no direct observations had been made. The tidal wave, Russel's great primary wave, and Airy's free-tide wave, a wave of the first order, or any wave of the second order that bas, by approaching the shore, become a wave of translation, travels with a velocity equal to that acquired by a heavy body falling freely by gravity through a height equal to half the depth of the fluid, reckoned from the top of the wave to the bottom of the channel. In any other than a rectangular channel, the effective height is from the top of the wave to the centre of gravity of the section. In a primary wave there is no oscillation proper; but the particles of the fluid in a vertical section, by the transit of the wave, are raised, moved laterally, and permanently brought to rest in the direction of the motion in a new place, with the isame extent of transference of each particle throughout the whole depth of the wave. The height of this wave increases

172*

in a channel of the form of a wedge, and of equal depth nearly in the inverse ratio of the square root of the clepth. "\Vaves of the second order, such as thrn;;e caused by the winrl, oscillate either circularly or elliptically, and their velocity if-I uot a function of' the depth of the waler. To apply the abon empirical laws, it >Ya:s necesHary to obtain the correct time of the transit of 11 wave in the channel over two places at a considerable distance apart. A position near the R<tce, and another off Sand's Point, were found admirably fitted for the purpose, and the time of transit, as observed on the shore, had only to be referred to the midchannel. Leth denote the effective dc1ith, and v the corresponding velocity, then we have the simple formuhe for feet and seconds of time : . h = 0.015536 vz v = иs.0227 vh; or, for li in feet, and v in statute miles per hour, v = [O. 73800] vh; the num1ier within brackets being a logarithm. Subtracting one minute for the time of trnnsmission of the wave from the channel to the place of observation at Sand's Point, (computed by the above formula,) and seven minutes for New Rochelle, from the observed time of the transit of the crest of the wave or high water at this place, we find for the transit in the channel XIh. 12m. and, similarly, IXh. 2lm. for the same at the Race. This difference increaRed uy lOm. for difference in longitude, leaves 2h. Olm. as the observed time of the transmi1:1sion of the wave from the Race to Sand's Point, a distance of ninety-five miles. To obtain the computed time, the s1iace was subdivided to allow mean depths to he used; and by adding the times together for the several sections, as computed by the above formula, an interval of '2li. l!:Jm. was found differing but 18m. from the observed time. An analytical investigation, by Andrew John Robertson, (see London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philos. Mag., February, 1853,) based upon Scott Russel's experiments, and with consideration of Mr. Earnshaw's paper, (Philos. Mag., December, 1850-'51,) gives for the velocity of the transmission of the wave of translation :v-;-- (h another supposition, simplifying the investigation, v
=

+ 2 k)

v h i k;

and on

(h

+ 2 k) v {-,where h =depth of

undisturbed waters, 2 k =height of a positive wave, g =accelerating force of gravity. Expressing h in feet and v in miles per hour, we have-

v = [0.58739] (h

+ 2 k) v{, the number enclosed in brackets being a logarithm.

Applying this formula, the time for traversing the ninety-five miles becomes 2/i. 14rn., being five minutes nearer the observed time, a1td differing uut a few minutes from it. The wave travelling at the rate of sixty miles an hour near the Race, arrive8 at the head of the bay with but little more than half that velocity, sending out branches towards the shores ; hence the parallelism of the co-tidal lines with the shore-line. The propagation of the wave from some point in the channel towards the shore station takes place in the shortest possible time, and tR.e line of propagation can he found by the method of trial and error with tolerable accuracy. The above has be@ verified by our tidal observations on the shores of the sound, but there is yet some obscurity in the time of the tides near the eaAtern entrance, which will be cleared hy future observations. Referring some observed tides below and above the Race to the channel, the resulting retard.ation of the tidal wave by the contraction of the shore-lines at this 1>lace, I computed to he eight min ntes. The explanation for the remarkably slow transmission of the wave east of Hell Gate will he found in the intricacies of the channel. These narrow passages, turning fr~q1.iently .round acute angles, aml destroying the acquired momentum of the water by fnct10n, will not permit us to calculate the time of transmission through them . ./11-t t~e ~outhwest ledge the sea is said to break in heavy weather; the depth, however, bemg six fathoms, would, for a 11Crfoct breaker, require a wave of seventy-two feet from top to bottom. The interference of waves appears to favor the formation of imperfect breakeni. The currents on the dangerous ground of the Nantucket shoals are now undergoing investigation, the results of which I expect to submit to you in a short time. I remain, air, very respectfully, youns, CHAS. A. SCHOTT. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Svperintendent U. S. Coast Survey.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

APPENDIX No. 51.

Tide Tables for the Coast

cgи

the United States.

The following tahles contain the reYisecl data for the principal tidal elements of a number of points on tlie coast of the United States, with additions to the tables 1rnblished last year, furnished by the discussions of the tidal observations. They are selected from a large number of resultsи obtained in the 1)rogress of the Coast Snrvey, only those stations 1JCing reported, as a general rule, where the observations extended through at least two lunations.
EXPLAXATIOX OF THE TAllLES.

Table I giYes a list of the 8tations, beginning at the north and east, ancl following the coast south and west. The first three columns of this table need no explanation. 'I'he fourth gives the mean interrnl between the time of the moon's transit and the time of high water. This is al1m called tlie "corrected establishment" of a })face. Navigators are in the lrnbit of using; the term " time of high water at full and change of moon,и' but thiR is not ef1uiYalent to the mean interval on our coast, where the tide follows two days after the transit of the moon by which it iR produced. On the vVe8tern coast, however, the mean interrnl appearH to coincide with the interval at foll and change. The fift11 column gives the difference between the greatest aml least intervals. Table II will show at what. age of the moon these occur. '.l'he sixth column gives the meau rise and fall, or range of the tide. The se,иentl1 gins the same for Rpring tides, and the eighth for neap tides. The ninth column gives the mean duration of the fioOll or rise of the tide, and the tenth the nwan duration of the ehh or fall of the tide. Both are reckoned from the middle of one stand to the middle of the next. 'l'he deYenth eolurnn gives the mean duration of the stand, also sometimes callecl slackwater, although the latter term i8 more usually applied to the cessation of the tidal current than to the cessation of the vertical rise or fall of the surface of the water. Table II giYes the interval between the time of the moon's transit and the time of the high water for different. ages of the nwon. The hour of the moon's transit is in the first column, anll each subsequent column gives the interval reforred to for the lJlace named at the hea1l of the column. ThiR table results from applying the correction for half-monthly inequality to the mean interval of Table I. Table III girns the changes of height of high and low water for the different ages of the moon. The timeH of transit arc, as in Table II, in the :first column, and the names of tho places to which the table applies at the head of the successiYe columns. Under the heading of each place four columns are given. The first shows the rise of high water above mean low water, at the Revera! ages of the moon. This column giYes the addition to he made to a chart upon which the sonndings are reduced to mean low water, to obtain the depths at high water, at any period of the lunar month. The Hecond column under the head of each place shows the height of high water above mean low watcl' of spring tides, and gives the means of finding the depths at high water upon charts of which the Rotmdings have been redneed to the mean low water of spring tideR. The third column shows how to reduce depths given at mean low water to the low water of the day, and the fourth column how to reduce de1)ths given at mean low water of Rpriug tides, to the low water of the day. Thi8 table i~ obtained from applying the half-monthly inequality of heights of high and low wahи1, rC'spei:tively, to the mean heights of mean high ancl low water, and to the mean heighti, of high aml low water of spring tides. Table I\' giws the rise or fall of the tide at several stations in the Gulf of Mexico. On this part of the coast the tides present the following peculiarities: \Vhen the moon's declination is zero, or nearly so, there are two small, irregular tides in twenty-four hours; when the moon'i:; declination is greatest, there is generally but one tide in twenty-four hours.

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

и1s1

Between these two pcrio<ls there arc sometimes two ve1'.r small tides of unequal heiх:ht. 'l'his inequality often amounts to one foot in the height of low "иater. In the height of high water, however, the ineqnality rarely exceeds four or five inches, and more generally manifests itself hy the tide standing at about the same height for seYeral hours. иwhen the time of greateRt declination of the moon occurs at full or change, the rise and fall are greatest. \Yhen the moon's declination is zero in the first or last quarter, the rise and fall are least. Tables V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X, refor to rиlaces at which the difference in intcnal and height of A. I\l. and P. l\:I. tide~, or the diurnal inequality in time and height, is large. Tables V and VII are for Key \Vest, and the others for San Francisco. Table V giYes the intenal between the moon's transit and the time of high water for each homи of transit, an<l for each day from the maximum drrlination of the muon to the zero of <leclination. At this latter period the diurnal inequality vanishes. The intervals corresponding to the superior transits, and north declinations and inferior transits, and south declinations, are given in the first half of the table, and those for superior transits and south declinations, and for inferior transits and north declinations. ill the second half. This table is made by applying the correction for the half-monthly inequality to the mean interval, and by applying to the numbers thus found the corrections for the daily inequality, with their proper signs. The times of both upper and lower culminations of the moon, are gi-ren in the United States Nautical Almanac. Table YI gives the height of high water at Key \Yest above mean low water of spring tides, for eYery hour of transit, aud for each da3и from the maximum of the moon's declination. As in Table V, the moon's age is in the first column, and the number of clays from the greatest declination is at the head of each successive column. One-half of the table applies to upper transits and north declinations, and to lower transits and south declinations; and the other half to upper transits and south declinations, and lower transits and north declinations. Tables VII and VIII are the corresponding ones for San Francisco, and are similarly arranged. The heights in Table VIII are given above the lowest low water of the day at spring tides. 'l'ables IX and X are similar ones for the time and height of low water at San Francisco. Table XI gives the proportionate rise or fall of the tide before or after high water, during successive half hours, for spril).g and neap tides at New York and Old Point Comfort. Table XII gives a description of the bench-marks to which the heights of the tides have been referred, at some of the more important ports.

Instead of screwing the pipe into the bottom by the auger, it would be equally secure to connect it to the ring of an anchor by a joint. The joint, in this case, must turn at right-angles to the shank of the anchor, in order that the gauge may be plumbed after being set up. Two holes, one-eighth of an inch each, are sufficient to let in the water ; but others should be made, and covered by bands of canva~s, to sen'e in case the first should he stopped. To Bet up gmtge.-The operation of setting up a gauge, of the form described, requires a surf-boat and four men, in modemte weather. The four anehors, with buoys attached to crowns, should first be carried off just beyond the breakers, and dropped in one to two fathoms water, in the vicinity of the spot fixed upon for the gauge. The gauge should then be taken off, one of the anchors raised astern of the boat, the pipe passed throng h the ring, and the anchor let down to the bottom of the sea. The pipe is then screwed into the sand by a hand-spike passed through a twist of rope; or, if fast to the _anchor-ring by a joint, the pipe should be ijUpported by a buoy. Each of the three other anchors is then raised in turn and the iron rods made fast to the rings, after which the anchors are lowered to their final positions. Each rod is then fastened hy a chain to the screw-band at high-water line, and the gauge plumbed. The fl.oat and rod are of the form generally used in box-gauges. During these operations, the surf-boat should be kept steady by an anchor, and a line to the shore; but in a heavy swell, or strong current, the whole should be done as quickly as possible, as it is very difficult to avoid drifting, and sometimes the apparatus becomes loaded with sea-weed, and difficult to manage. Observing.-Thc observer stands upon the beach and reads the graduation on the rod l)y the aid of a spy-glass. At night, the rod is illuminated by a lantern of the usual form, furnisl:ed with a tin reflector, drawn off by lines 1iassing through a pulley at the gauge. A tight wire, fastened at one end to the gauge, and at the other to an elevated point on shore, is necessary for the lantern to slide upon.

Letter from Lieutenant Commanding T . .A.. Craven, U. S. N., a<Jsistant in the Coast Survey, to the Superintendent, in relation to a specimen-box for bringing up the bottom in deep-sea 8oundings, with a description and drawings.
Penobscot Bay, October 16, 1854. Sm: As requested, I send you drawings of the sounding specimen-box, invented by me, for bringing up the bottom from great depths. I haYe used it with great success in sounding from the vessel, while not in motion, at depths varying from fifty fathoms to four hundred fathoms. As the lead descends, the upward pressure of the water against the projecting lip of the valve forces it up to the stops; when it strikes bottom, the valve, of its own weight, will fall to its seat, and in hauling; it up, the pressure is so great that nothing can escape. I do not think the instrument entirely suitable for sounding in shoal water from a vessel going at moderate speed; and, although it will bring up bottom while running lines, it cannot constantly be depended upon, and I do not recommend it for that purpose, but for sounding at depths of twenty-five fathoms, and below, it is the only instrument I have found to be of service. It will be observed that no current of water can ilow into or through this box; and the greater the speed of hauling up, the more effectually is the valve closed. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, T. AUGS. CRAVEN, Lieutenant U. S. N., Assistant Coast Survey.

APPENDIX No. 55.
Letter of Assistant J. E. Hilgard, on the action of sea-water upon metals used in the construction of instrument1, and on magnetic needles.
DEAR Srn: The recent disaster of the United States schooner Phoenix, gave occasion to some observations on the action of sea-water upon the metals used in the construction of instruments, which convey some useful indicatiom and deserve to be placed on record. A number of valuable instruments were on board when the vessel sunk, and remained submerged in about five fathoms of water for three weeks, when the vessel was raised. On examining the instruments I found them much less damaged than I had anticipated. The hold of the vessel was filled with black mud and sand, and a nry offensive smell prevailed, indicating the presence of riulphuretted hydrogen, which is confirmed by the fact, well known to mariners, that black mud cleans the chain cables; that is to say, it causes the rust to scale off-a marked effect of certain sulphurets. The silver parts of the instruments were blackened, but the black film could be polished off without sensible injury to the graduation. Brass parts that had been previously tarnished presented a bronzed appearance, while bright brass only became slightly reddish, some of the zinc being probably decomposed. Steel, wherever exposed, was very much rusted; many of the smaller parts were entirely rusted away. The axes, however, and the close fitting parts, were well preserved. German silver, an alloy of copper and nickel, was not tarnished in the least degree, nor did it become so when afterwards exposed to the air without being cleaned with fresh water. It is much to be recommended for clamp and tangent screws, springs, and other working parts of instruments which require hardness and elasticity, and are frequently exposed to the action of the salt spray when used on the beach. 'l'hc shellac varnish used as coating for the instruments proved to be a great protection. A marked contrast was exhibited by the condition of some magnetic needles, part of which were kept in small zinc cases, while others were in a wooden case. The latter were very nearly destroyed by rust, while the former, owing to the galvanic action produced between the zinc and steel by the pressure of the sea-water, were preserved perfectly bright, a thin, white coating of zinc being deposited on them, which was readily rubbed

off.
A singular circumstance was noticed in the case of the two magnetic dipping-needles packed in wood, which, however trivial it may appear, nevertheless indicates some action

which remains to be explained. These needles were of the ordinary form, and were packed side by side, the axles of both being nearly in a right line. The adjoining pivotR were distant about ! inch, and were, in a great measure, preserved from rust, while the exterior pivots were entirely gone.

APPENDIX No. 56.

Letter frcnn George MatMot, Esq., containing a detailed de.tcription of his aelf-sustaining voltaic battery.
WASIIINGTON, November 12, 1854. Srn: Captain Benham has communicated your request that I would prepare a description of my self-sustaining voltaic battery, with your favorable opinion of its usefulness, and reference to the judgment of Dr. Gould of a similar tenor. Many inquiries have been made in regard to the principles of construction of the batt.ery, with commendation of its working properties, and I have even received large commercial orders for its construction, which, of course, I could not execute, so that, up to this time, a few sets only have been made for use in government works. I now give a thorough description of the battery, and of tlrn principles on which its action depends, hoping that thereby the recent important applications of voltaic currents may be facilitated through mv labors. и 'The iirst forms of the voltaic battery were so expensive and cumbrous, and withal so uncertain and fleeting in action, toot the idea of applying galvanic currents to the great business affair11 of life would certainly have gained nothing more than a smile from even the most sanguine philosopher. But, from the continued researches of electro-chemists, the world has now the benefit of electro-metallurgy and the electric telegraph. The batteries now employed are uncertain to a considerable degree, and require constant attention. Any consideration, therefore, tending to the improvement of the instrument, so as to avoid the necessity for frequent attention, cannot but be appreciated at this time, when the world is asking science for a telegraph across the Atlantic, and we are looking for a line from the Pacific to the :Mississippi, on which there must needs be many stations or relays of batteries, that from the uninhabited state of the country cannot be constantly attended иor even frequently visited. The construction which I have devised will, I think, obviate many of the difficnltieR attending telegraphing, and the principles of electro-chemistry, and even experience, justify me in saying that batteries may be constructed to be buried in the earth or sunken in the sea, which will certainly and uniformly continue in action for very long periods, even for a hundred years. In this battery there is no new element, neither is the form such as to attract the attention in respect to anything in it materially different from the batteries now in use. It is only in all the parts being constructed with rigid adherence to the principles of electrochemistry that its peculiitrity consists, and therefore a consideration of the principles is necessary to its appreciation. A charged voltaic battery may be considered as a factor,y of electrical power, just as a charged and ignited furnace is a factory of heat, and similarly in both cases the rapidity with which the fuel is consumed, and the steadiness of action, will depend on the arrangement of the parts. A furnace in action consumes the fuel; whether the generated caloric be applied to use or suffered to run waste, the chemical affinity will sooner or later consume the fuel ; and though the action may be diminished to some extent by cutting off some of the conditions of combustion, the extent of that action will depend on the construction of the furnace. If a furnace could be made so that we might draw off the requisite amount of caloric to boil a pound of water just as it might be required, and retain the residue until we again had occasion to use fire, then such a furnace would be a storehouse of caloric, just as a granary isa storehouse of grain from which we draw a supply, and keep the residue in atore. The same remark will apply to the battery; once changed, the chemical affinity consumes the material sooner or later, usefully or not, and we can entirely arrelilt action only by

unloading. Much indeed can be done by modifying the conditions of action, but, as in t11e furnace, all will depend on the construction. 'fo make a battery 1Yhich can keep the action in rcRerve, is the problem of a depot of electricitv. The u~controllahle nature of the voltaic conditions, I conceive, was the cause why batteries haw not hitherto been constructed with reference to the whole amount of force, as well as to the sfrengtli or rate of working. l'revious to rny own efforts I know of no attempts at putting a quantity of galvanic material in ~tore rearly for action just '"hen required. A cell of the reservoir battery is in form a four-si<led prism of Rtone-ware, eight inches long, thrcf' inehes wide, and ten inches deep. On the side, at the depth of three inches, is forme<l a trough or tray, an inch wide and half an inch deep, running the length of thr Ride. This tray- is made with t.he jars. _It is indiRpen~able that the jars should be completely water-tight, but they are difficult to 0btain; and thus far I have had none which have given full satiRfaction. The best were of chemical stone-ware, 1mt only half of them were watrr-proof. A coat of glazing cannot he depended upon for sealing, as in vessels for culinary and table purposes, as sulphate of zinc penetrates eYen the beautiful stone-ware called ''granite." vVhen unable to obtain good rectangular jars, I have mied cylindrical glass jars, ancl formed the tray with cement on a plate of glass or gutta-percha, a little lesR in width than the inner diameter of the vessel. The Jllate can be kept from moving by pr~jecting jogR, which catc}h on the edge of the Yessel. The Jllate, tray, and jogs can easily be moulded in one piece in glass. The conducting plate of the battery iR of the platinized silver introduced by l\Ir. SMEE; lmt the mode of preparing it is different. I first puncture it closely with a square-pointed awl. The holes should not be cut with a punch, which removes the metal, but formed by pushing the metal up in hars, like those on the common tin grater. In thiR way none of the surfaceи is lost, and both sides of the silver are rendered efficient to a single surface of zinc. After the plate has been punctured, it should be well cleaned, aml then electroplated until the deposite begins to roughen ; this very much improves the stability of the plate, and greatly augments the extent of surface. The cyanides should then be well washed away with hot water, and the plate be platinizeJ. I find that the platinizing is very durable, if the arrangements for depositing the platinum are made so that the bright metallic platinum Rhall :first be deposited, and the amorphous form (black deposites) gradually succeed it. The Teguline deposite of platinum can readily be obtained by URing a mixture of chloride of platinum and chloride of sodium, (instead of the acid solution of chloride of platinum recommended for obtaining the black powder,) with a train of small batteries and a platinum electrode. The conducting 1ilatc is attached to a square bar of lead nine inches long, and five-eighths of an inch across the sides. The bar restH on the top of the jar, and is kept from moving horizontally hy studs near the ends. At the distance of an inch and a half from each end of the bar is a pendant an inch long, and of nearly the same section as the bar. The plate is attached to the bar by sawing a slit a third of an inch deep in each pendant, in the direction of the length of the bar, inserting the silver in the slit, and thoroughly closing down the lead on the plate. This is conveniently doue by biting the pendant in the jaws of a common bench-vice. In the Ride of the ba,r, near the middle, is screwed a thick copper wire, which projects out horizontally two inches and a quarter, and then drops three inches and an eighth. Into the end of this wire is tapped a piece of platinum wire, which iR left proje:-ting about an eighth of an inch. Every part of the copper-wire should be thoroughly coated "'1th cement or encased with a glass tube, or the vertical part may be encased with glass and the horizontal with cement; but when glass is used, it should be cemented on so as to exclude entirely the liquid of the battery, thus preventing its contact with the copper. If cement alone is used, the wire should first be wrapped, otherwise the cement is liable to become ~etached, as it does not hold so well to the copper as it does to the wrapping. The zmc plates of the battery should be -f th of an inch thick, and of the length of the inside of the jar or tray. The zinc should be well amal(J'amated, and then pl8Ced in the Jar with the.edge resting in the tray, and the tray filled with mercury. The plate is secured tn place by its length and by the enca11el'.l wire from the adja"Cent cell, which hinder it from

But the terminal zinc must be secured by a wire similarly encased and tipped with platinum to dip into its mercury tray, and then bent down against the outside of the jar to a glaRs or iron cup containing mercury, for continuing the circuit. The wire from the terminal silver should dip into a similar cup. If, then, the conductor which continues the circuit be encaserl and tipped with platinum, the current may be led off from any portion of the train by inserting the conductor into the mercury tray. The jars are charged with a mixture of one part of sulphuric acicl, and six parts of water These proportions are calculated for dissolving all the zinc and all the sulphate formed, and leaving a slight excess of acid and water. \Vhen the mixture of acill and water is made, it should be allowed to get cold before it iF.1 put into the jars, if the silvers are to be put in, as a hot solution of sulphuric acid woulcl act on the silver, and dissohe a portion, which, though very small, would ruin both the silver and the zinc plates, as will presently be made to appear. Lastly, the silver plates should never be put into the acid when the zincs are not in, as in that case the silver, not being enfilmed by hydrogen, wonld be in danger from the acid. To hinder evaporation from the jars, the battery is placed in a box made with a double rim on the lid so as to form a deep trough or recess, into which the walls of the box go when the lid is put on. \Vhen the battery is to remain a long time without attention, the box should be completely air-tight. I have devised no special plan for hindering the evaporation, for the particular circumstances in which the battery is place<l will cause the rate of evaporation to be great or small : thus, when the battery is exposed to frequent changes of temperature, the loss from the jars will be great, (even though a box is used) if the air can flow in and out. But when the battery can be placed in a vault or cellar having a uniform temperature, and not subjected to frequent changes of air, then no box will be required, if the battery can be filled up every few months. 'Vhen a vault cannot be had, a heap of earth over the box will greatly hinder changes of temperature and evaporation. Only let it be remembered that the jars should be kept full, either by refilling or by hindering evaporation. The form of battery described above has advantages over all others in simplicity and cheapness, as well as certainty and economy of action. Its riddance of the usual appliances for making contact, such as binding screws, clamps, ~nd soldered joints, so expensive in manufacture, and yet so very uncertain in use, will certainly commend it to every one who knows the endless trouble which invariably attends the use of these joinings. How often has a lecture been s1Joiled because there was a bad contact which could not be detected ; and how often do we hear of a whole day being lost in telegraphic operations, from the nitric acid having eaten off the solderwhichjoined a platinum toa zinc in the Grove's battery. Moreover, we have no residues of the zincs-no necessity for re-amalgamation. To show all the advantages of the arrangements described, for maintaining the conditions of voltaic action, would be to take a full view of the theory of the generation and diffusion of voltaic electricity, which would be impossible in this communication. Yet, to set these advantages in some light, I will take but a glance at the voltaic action. The universal feature of a voltaic combination is that of three substances in a series, in which the two extreme bodies have dissimilar properties with respect to the intermediate, which is a compound body, so constituted that one of its components can -be eliminated by one of the extreme bodies, and the other component by the other extreme body. In all useful batt.eries, one of the extreme bodies is zinc; the other, some less oxidablc metal; and the intermediate, water, or water with some acid, generally the sulphuric. The relations and actions of the11e three substances will embrace all that relates to the generation of the voltaic current. We will suppose that the function of the zinc is to disturb the electrical equilibrium, by combining with the oxygen of the water, (or, if we consider the electrolyte as sulphate of hydrogen, the action will be the same,) that the function of the water is to transmit the disturbance by a wave of decomposition and recomposition, and that the function of the less ox.ida.ble plate (the oonducting plate) is to produce equilibrium, by eliminating hydrogen from the electrolyte. The chemical affinity generates the electricity by the conibination of the zinc with the oxygen and the decomposition of the water. Therefore the amount of electricity, and the consequent tension which the affinity can generate in a given time, will depend on the favorable circumtJtancea for chemical action, such as the presence of acid to dissolиc the

oxide of zinc, which oihen'.'ise wonld soon exclude the electrolyte by encrusting the zinc; the presence of water to dissolve the sulphate of zinc ; temperature affecting the solvent capacity of the water, and the reaction of the tension against the affinity. \Vhen a battery is first charged, 1111 the conditions are prime; from this there is a decline by several ways to the point of no action. The decline may result from a changing of the electrolyte or of the conducting plate. The character of the change, and the rapidity of decline, will depend wholly on the construction of the battery. The construction may be such tl1at the action '~ill wholly ceaRe before even a small portion of the material is consumed. WhБn the zinc plate of a battery is placed in such a situation that the generated sulpliatc of zinc cannot :flow away, as when the plate.is placed at the bottom (horizontally) of the jar, and the arrangements are made such that the quantity of electricity, and the consequent formation of zinc salt, shall exceed the rate at which the diffusion of the salt can take place, the zinc plate will soon become coated with a crop of crystals. As the cessation of action here is visibly due to exclusion of the excitant, it follows that in whatever position the zinc plate is placed, just in proportion as the sulphate of zinc excludes the excitant, will the capacity of the chemical affinity to generate the electrical tension decrease. Many plans for removing the sulphate of zinc from the cell liave been devised. The most of these have been based upon the idea that the sulphate by its superior gravity would tmLside and saturate the lower parts of the solution. I have tested the value of this idea by the following method: Vessels 38 inches deep were filled with solutions of the sulphate of various dPgrees of saturation; then, after letting the solutions repose for several days at a uniform temperature, I drew off a portion of the liquid at the bottom, and a portion from the depth of three inches from the top, and in no case found a difference of density to produce more than one degree of Baume's hydrometer. But I have found that even a saturated solution will always be considerably dencient j1~st at the top, provided that it is not subjected to agitation. By this I learned that a calm sdution cannot be satura.ted on the top. On this basis I formerly, in conjunction with Mr. J. Green, the well known maker of philosophical apparatus, constructed batteries with the zinc arranged horizontally within half an inch of the top of the liquid. These horizontal batteries required perishable mechanical contrivances for keeping the plates in position which would quite unfit them for telegraphic operations, though I still consider them superior to all others for electrotyping. By the action of these horizontal batteries we found that the grains of salt were deposited in crystals, at the bottom, while the top of the solution remained unsaturated. From a single cell of these horizontal batteries, which held four gallons, and was only eight inches deep, I have frequently taken 2! gallons of crystals of sulphate of zinc. I have sought to make use of these advantages about the top of the solution, in the construction of the reservoir battery, as far as practicable, with simplicity of construction. From what is said above concerning the horizontal battery, will be seen the advantage of using in the reservoir a long, narrow plate of zinc, with the length horizontal. This also has an advantage in regard to the mercury keeping the plate always well amalgamated from not having a great height to climb. In all other batteries, the important principle of the subsidence of the salt has been wholly overlooked; for although it has been prop@sed to draw off the saturated solution from the bottom, while fresh excitant was supplied at the top, yet the plates have invariably been placed with their lengths vertical. The self'.-amalgamation of the zinc has been introduced not _merely with reference to the saving of labor and mercury, but with reference to the contmued action of the battery. This mode of re-amalgamating appears somewhat specious at fi;st; but soon the question arises, how far can this mercury creep up the plate and efficm~tly a~algamate it? This will depend on the quality of the zinc, as will appear from a consideration of the uses of amalgamation. All co~mercial zinc contains mechanical impurities, such as charcoal, stones, &c., and is allored with various metals, but chiefly with iron. As the action of the solvent reduces the surface ~nd leaves the imP.urities projecting, they are placed in situation to form voltaic cir.clea havm~ the least possible resistance-which is being most favorably di11posed for action. Every particle of foreign matter on the zinc surface acts as a conducting plate to it, evolving hydrogen frolll: the elec!rolyte, a~d.most rapidly consuming both the zinc and the solvent. If now the zmc plate is mercunahzed, the ernormous cohesive force of the mercury causes it to contract over the particles of carbon, iron, &c., and the surface of the plate is ma.de

*197

homogeneous, and commquently, as the particles which evolrnd the hydrogen are n0w excluded from the electrolyte, their action on it ceases. The mercury itself, if more stronglv charged with zinc in one place than in another, might evolve the hydrogen; liut fortunatei'y having a most perfect polish, it binds the hydrogen firmly to it. This action of the polishcLl metal we will consider }Jresently. ~ut as the consumption of the zinc goes on, the impurities accumulate on the surface, and P.roJect so far that the mercury cannot envelope them ; hence the efficacy of the amalgamat10n at any place will depend on the amount of limpid mercury at that place, and the amount of the impurities to be covered. So I find that with the ordinary English and New Jersey zinc, the solution of twenty-five grains from a square inch of the surface (a depth of 6\ th of an inch) will leave the impurities projecting so far that the quantity of mercury which can adhere to the zinc when in a vertical position, cannot prevent violent chemical action in the minute galvanic circles. But the zinc known in commerce as the " .Musselman' s" is so easily protected that I find the corrosion may go the depth of ith of an inch, and the mercury still be efficient when flooded over the surface. Here, then, is the answer to the question as to how far the zinc plate may be protected or efficiently amalgamated by standing it in a flood of mercury. If the plate is not to be dissolved to a very great depth, the good commercial zinc will be sufficiently protected; but for a longer time the zinc should be redistilled, and for a very long time nothing hnt chemically pure zinc should be emJJloyed. Practically I find that the " Musselman' s" answers well for one year. From what has been said concerning the action of the impurities of the zinc, it will be perceived that if any carbonaceous matter falls on the battery, it may attach itself to the zinc, and thus rapidly destroy the voltaic conditions by consuming the materials ; since the evolution of hydrogen would continue while there remained zinc to be oxidized, acid to dissolve the oxide, and water to dissolve the salt. This shows the necessity of a box to prevent currents of air from sweeping over the battery; for even the dust which subsides from the atmosphere, may !'let up the destructive action. From the same kind of reasoning, it is obvious that the presence of the least particle of any salt reducible by zinc or by hydrogen should be avoided; and such a salt coming in contact with the zinc, would instantly form a conducting plate. If we would avoid every risk of this destructive action, the :fixtures of the battery must not be made of a metal which can form a soluble salt with sulphuric acid. I will have occasion to refer again to the employment of the oxidable metals for the battery :fixtures; then I will merely state that I have found by experience that even silver is unsuitable, for when I employed a silver bar and silver pendants to hold the conducting plate, sulphate of silver was formed. We now come to the consideration of the most delicate part of the battery-the conducting plate. The function of this plate is solely the elimination of the hydrogen of the electrolyte. The plate, indeed, does conduct the positive electricity from the electrolyte. But by the chemical theory of the voltaic generation, the eUmination of the hydrogen from the electrolyte is the conductwn qf the positive electricity; and the conduction of thr: positive ekctricity ill the elimination of the hydrogen-the one is inseparable from the other, conduction and decomposition being identical in an electrolyte. By this it will appear that the liberated hydrogen should not be suffered to adhere to the conducting plate, for the gas being a very bad conductor, it will resist conduction, and consequently иchemical action. The office of this part of the battery has generally been considered a mystery, being subject to very great and sudden changes, which being unaccountable by mere inspection, were attributed to occult power called the "electro-motive force." But certainly rational investigation can refer all the battery changes to known forces. By late investigations we know that the gases adhere to, and condense on, all solid bodies. If the attraction between a sheet of metal and a molecule of gas is regulated by those same laws which govern the planetary masses, then we can easily conceive that the more definite the plane of attraction, the more strongly will the molecule be- drawn, and consequently the denser and higher will be the adhering layer of gas. And, by the same laws, we can see that an indefinite plane will act with opposing forces, as we see in the deviation of the plummet in the vicinity of mountains; as we see in the perturbation of the planets; and as we suppose when a. ~ody descends toward the centre of the earth from t и rface. The former of these cond1t10ns is fulfilled when the surface is polished; the l hen it is rough or unpolished.

198*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

\Ve can conceive the mounts of the roughness to rise so high above the plane of maximum force, that the adhesion to the prominences will be almost destroyed. And we can conceive the monnts to react so much against the pits that the plane of attraction shall be nearly or quite destroyed. \Ve can conceive of a surface thrown into such fine points and recesses that a molecule of gas might float in equilibrium in the cavities, or adhere with the least determination to the prominences. Hence the great advantage of the deposite of finely divided metal. A surface atomically rough will hold only an atmosphere of the least possible height and densitv. But this is not attainable. иwe get the nearest approximation to an atomic roughiiess when a surface has been covered with amorphous metal by electro deposition. Then itиmay be said to be rough or unpolished to the greatest degree for that meta.I. -Could we view such a surface, or rather I should say want of surface, we doubtless should find it many thousand fold more rugged, uneven, and porous, than the common sponge. The various metalR let go the hydrogen in the voltaic circuit with very different degrees of readiness. From the observations, I conclude that the attraction of the various metals for the gas is directly as their specific gravities. .All the less dense metals decompose water, (evolve hydrogen.) Sodium and potassium evolve the gas in torrents. The base metals proper have less action on water, and a stronger attraction for the gas. The n~le metals hold the gas very firmly, and are without ac1ion on water. The order in respect to evolution is the reverse in respect to gravity; and the order in respect to gravity is consequently the reverse of the order of fitness for a conducting plate in respect to the evolution of hydrogen. Platinum, gold, and lead, hold the gas very hard. When polished plates of these metals are used, the hydrogen adheres in large bubbles, which very slowly creep up the plate. :Mercury I do not compare, because its mechanical form is the best possible for adhesion; but could we but polish the solid noble metals as perfectly as the atomic polish of the mercury, I have no doubt but that the mercury, according to its density, would follow after gold. Silver answers better than the other noble metals. Experiment has not enabled me to decide that copper is better than silver, but I am much inclined to consider the copper as best. Iron is decidedly better than any metal above it in density, and requires no special preparation to make it evolve freely. Zinc is so prone to evolution that it is with difficulty that the hydrogen can be made to adher.e. The metals of the alkalies cannot be investigated with hydrogen like the denser. A mere particle of zinc will coat a surface of copper or iron with hydrogen, and protect it from oxidation forever; but as soon as potassium or sodium is deposited, it is instantly re-combined with oxygen, because it cannot be quoted with hydrogen. Here I may remark that the newly reported aluminum which is said to have the nobility of silvel', with the density of only 2.5, ought, by the above views, to make a most admirable conducting plate. By the above view, the adhesion of hydrogen is very nearly the reverAe of the affinity for oxygen. Here we find silver with a medium adhesion and a low affinity. This at once indicates that it is the metal which will be generally used for making batteries. Iron, which is the most oxidable metal that can be employed for conducting plates, has a very low adhesion, and fortunately a mechanical advantage from its ever-fibrous or granular form, which greatly increases its fitness for evolution. Could it remain as iron in the battery, it would probably be all we should ever desire, though it acts vigorously when newly cleaned-its affinity for oxygen soon makes it worthless. This o~jection holds not only for iron, hut for some kinds of batteries holds even against silver, and we are sent at last to tbe more noble metals. The difference between gold and platinum in respect to the adhesion, and also in re,epect to the liability to chemical change, is so small as to make the employment of one or the other merely a question of economy. But there is another property-one which quickly determines the preference ; this is the capability of being put in the best mechanical form for non-adhesion, or making the closest approximation to atomic roughness. Of all the metals, platinum has the greatest tendency to the amorphous state, (excepting its relatives, rhodium, indium, &c.) I do not remember having seen that its crystal has ever yet been determined. Not so with gold; its cryst.alline tendency is so strong, that it aggregat~s so much in precipitation, even from extremely dilute solutions, that the deposite has a decided yellowish tinge, and the slightest pressure makes the deposite conglomerate. I h~e need scarcely remind you of~. . -.laston's tedious process for metallizing spongy tilatinum. ~ ... и. -

If the a hove virws of the nature of the adhesion are correct, then it follows that the Rurface of the conducting-plate should be amorphous platinum, and nothing but amorphous platinum; and consequently, if we wish our battery to reta:in its capacity to remove the hydrogen from the electrolyte, which, let it he borne in mind, is the capacity to conduct electricity, then there should not be the remotest liability of the amorphous platinum to have a de11osite of any other metal, or any oxide formed on it. On this consideration I have carefully avoided using any reducible base metal about the battery, in such way that its salt might get into the cdl. I have before shown what woulU he the consequences of t.hii;; on the zinc plate, .and equally injurious would be its action on the conducting plate, whether it were deposited on it as metal or as oxide. In either case the hydrogen would adhere, the conduction resistance would be increased, the tension would rise proportionally and react against the affinity; the chemical action, the soul of the battery, would pro11ortionately decline. That the mntations of this battery from adhering coats of hydrogen, metals, or oxides, on the conducting plate, are attributed to conduction resistance. I shall expect to be regarded by the advocates of electro-polar forces as wholly untenable, and the resistance to be considered as incompetent to produce the effect. But that the gas resists is indisputable, and that it adheres to the conducting i>lat.e is equally indisputable, for we know that the very clods of the fields attract and condense the gases; and is it not, therefore, but as fair an inference that it adheres somewhat to denoe metallic plates? The thickness of the adhering film may be extremely small, but its resistance may be quite considerable, for the resistance of airs is almost incomparable to that of metals. vVe know that a battery l1as })enetrated over 3,000 miles of iron wire, and when a battery of 2,000 pairs had the poles parted only the least distance that could be manipulated, then the galvanic action could not be axhibited. It remains now only to notice the electrolytic changes with reference to continued action. The generated sulphate of zinc alters the conditions of action, not only by saturating the acid and water, but the dissolved sulphate itself is an electrolyte, and therefore may coat the conducting plate with zinc, and deteriorate it just as was shown would result from the salts of the other base metale. Fortunately, there is not so much danger of иthe plate becoming wholly coated with zinc as with the other base metals, for the deposited zinc is rapidly removed by its great tendency to become salt, in which it is assisted by the close proximity of 'the uncoated portions of conducting plate, forming good local circles with it. Should there be no portions of the plate bare to reduce the counter-tension generated by the resolution of the deposited zinc, then WP, should have the tension acting against the battery C1irrent. This probably can never happen, yet the plate is often made nearly inefficient by the reduced zinc, when the acid is mostly saturated. The acidulated water or sulphate of hydrogen is electrolyzed by a far less tension than decomposes sulphate of zinc; it is only, therefore, when the quantity of sulphate of hydrogen becomes proportionately small, and causes the tension to rise by its increased resistance, that the sulphate of zinc is decomposed. But it is unqw~stionable that that force which is the result of the combination of the elements of sulphate of zinc, cannot of itself undo that combination; yet while the battery is working, zinc is constantly being deposited and re-dissolved. In considering this action of the galvnnic current which is apparently so anomalous to the exhibition of every other known force, I have иconcluded that we shoulcl look for some additional force acting conjointly with the cnrrent, rather than for a moment admit the absurdity of an "electromotive force," with its supposed capacity of acting infinitely without expending itself. Such an additional force I conceive can be found in the attraction of the matter of the conducting plate for the heavy element of the electrolyte. If the conditions under which the deposition of the zinc takes place he considered, it must appear that it is the attraction which makes the determination. In the first place the deposition is nothing when the proportion of sulphate of zinc about the plate is small in comparison to the sulphate of hydrogen; but as the proportion of sulphate of zinc increases, the deposition of it begins to show itself, until it becomes very copious in a nearly saturated solution. The supposition I have made is, that the deposition is effected by the conjunction of the attraction with the current or electrical tension; consequently the depoigh that the addition of the attraction sition can only take place when the tension i 1 enables it to overcome the affinity. This ex orms to the conditions; the good conducting iulphate of hydrogen beini removed, ' J conducting solution of zinc will cause

200*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

the tension to rise. I cannot now go into the discussion of the specific weights of the elements of the two electrolytes, to show that that attraction will act in the same direction with the electric tension. It is at once evident that if we admit that the matter of the plate attracts the elements or atoms-and what physicist at this day would think of denying it? -then it follows that altering the aggregation of the surface of the plate will diminish that attraction, just as it diminishes the adhesion of the hydrogen; yet, as the molecule of zinc is so much heavier than the hydr,)gcn atom, the disturbed aggregation should extend much deeper into the plate for destroying the attraction for the zinc than is merely required for preventing the adhesion of the gas. On these principles I have made the conducting plate, with the disintegrated state of the surface extended to the greatest depth admitting of the requisite mechanical durability, for which the plate is electro-plated to the beginning of roughness before putting on the coating of platinum. I have sought to describe the peculiarities of this battery, by exhibiting the actions of the various parts, and the principles which guide me in their construction. These principles, I acknowledge, are new in their application to the galvanic phenomena. I have only to say for them, that they are the acknowledged principles of matter and motion, and consequently the principles of universal nature. But it may be that my solutions are wrong, and that further research will not sustain the views; yet, I ask for them a trial as to their conformity with the admitted solutions of the great multitude of natural phenomena. Thus we know that oxygen is condensed with a force of nearly a thousand atmospheres on spongy platinum; and does not geometry show us that if the disintegrated mass attract thus strongly, the solid surface will attract enormously? and if oxygen is so strongly attracted by the solid surface, then why may it not attract hydrogen, which is only sixteen times lighter, sufficiently to condense a layer which the battery liquid cannot displace because it is denser than the liquid? I must here ask that I may not be misunderstood by supposing that I refer to the bubbles of gas which adhere to smooth surfaces by the superincumbent pressure. Geometry, indeed, shows us that these bubbles are dispersed by a rough surface, but it also shows that these bubbles are hemispheres, and therefore that they cannot entirely prevent contact of the plate and liquid. That the deposition of the zinc, also, should be referred to the attraction of the plate, is that which the universal principle of attraction demands. Why not admit that that attractive force which we know exists in all things, concurs with the electrical tension to produce this, when we are constantly seeing the greatest anomalies produced by concurring forces? Thus we know that the affinity of copper for oxygen, at low. temperatures, is superior to that of hydrogen ; yet, when a piece of coal is saturated with hydrogen and immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, the hydrogen is oxidyzed and copper reduced, simply because the attraction of the coal for the copper, added to the affinity of the hydrogen for oxygen, make a united force superior to the affinity of copper for oxygen. Here we have a voltaic circle composed of coal, sulphate of copper, and hydrogen, which becomes active by the help of attraction, and is enabled to decompose an electrolyte whose affinities are even stronger than those of the produced electrolyte. I has been considered as the standing miracle of electricity, and the unanswerable argument against the chemical theory of electrical excitation, that a battery will work on a neutral solution of sulphate of zinc, and deposite zinc on the conducting plate; for, say the advocates of the electro-motive force, the force is greater than the affinity of zinc for the negative element, for, after overcoming the conduction resistance, it is still enabled to separate zinc from the negative element. But there is a little experiment which shows conclusively that it is the state of the surface of the conducting plate which determines the electrolysis, and not a supposed electrical condition involved in the nature of the substance of the plate. и Let a battery of several pairs be connected with a pair oflarge platinum electrodes, in a solution of su~pha.te of zinc, containing a little free acid-or a single battery may be used if an electrode of zmc is used to receive the oxygen,-then, if the platinum electrode be well polished, zinc ~ill b~ rapidly deposited on it, and there will be no hydrogen given off; then let the deposited zmc be dissolved off, and the platinum electrode roughened with emery and well platinized,_ and then restored to its former connection with the battery; now, the same battery, with the ~ame solutions ancl trodes, will chiefly electrolize the sulphate of hydrogen; there will be very little zи osited, but the hydrogen will fly off in copious streams.

As the reservoir battery is designed chiefly for telegraphs, I may, with propriety, l1cfore closing, Ray a frw worcls relative to the quantity of electricit;и re1p1ired to work a telegraph. I have measured the qnantity of the current on some lines by interposing voltametres in the circuit. The quantity near the battery i~ "Very great compared with the quantity on the part remote from the 1iattery, for the insulation is always imperfect; and of the whole qllantity that leaves the battery, only a tmrnll proportion reaches the remoter part. But to get all the waste included in my measurement, I measured near the batter~-, and found when the line was in good working order, the quantity of the electricity was tlmt represented by the solution of one grain of zinc per hour. Sometimes the line would work well with rnnch less than a grain; and often after the batteries had lJeen recently charged, the quantity was ten grains; lJUt mostly, when the line was in fine or<ler, the quantity was al1out the grain. Supposing the current to be on about seven hours per day, (which I think comes near the time,) then one pound of zinc will supply all the electricity used in 1,000 days, or, Sa]" three years of business days. From this it will appear that my idea of a battery to serve 100 years is, at least, not Ro extravagant a,~ to he without some show of probability. Such a battery would require zincs of only 33 pounds weight, or (allowing fur some local action, as there is some always carried on, even by the mercury) say 50 pounds, which is a cube of less than six inches sqmtrc. I have lately had a fair opportunity of knowing the value of this battery. In J\Iay last, I charged six cells, which were put in a box in the upper laboratory, tu 1ie used in the experiments on photographic engraving. The battery has since been in almost daily m;e for gilding deep-sea thermometers, or other instruments, or else in the experiments. During the six months which have elapsed, it has been used probably 2,000 times, in which there was nothing more required to get the current than to complete the circuit. During the intensely hot spell of the past summer, I three times added a little water to su1111ly the loss from evaporation, and these were the only times the box was opened. Very respectfully, and obediently, your servant, GEORGE l\fATHIOT. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. CoaRt Surv~y.

APPEKDIX No. 57.

Report on Engraving in relation to the Coast Siirvey. By Lieutenant E. B. Hunt, Corps of Engineers U. S . .Army, and assistant U. S. Coast Survey.
TARRYTOWN, N. Y., September 21, 1854. Srit: In lHOceeding to execute your instructions of September 2, directing me to prepare a report on "engraving as executed in the Coast Survey Office," I shall assume that your wishes will best be answered by such a treatment of the whole rnhject as will exhibit it in all its essential bearings. Recognising in engraving an art of the highest aml most influential character, not less than a practical handicraft of a strictly manual nature, I should esteem it an ill-judged narrowness here to pass unnoticed those fundamental generalities, ever most prone to escape from sight. At present it will doubtless be advisable to avoid unfolding in detail the mere routine and mechanical dexterities of this 1>rofession; dexterities practised only by those who have devoted patient years to its acquisitioti. The art' and practice bf engraving in the Coast Survey Office being my subject, I shall consider it in reference to its office organization, history, and administration, to its artistic and technical aspects, and to its prospects. That policy which has given origin and support to the system of operations embraced under the name of the Coast Survey has two definite aims of peculiar importance. First, it aims at a connected system of geodetic, topographical, and hydrographic observations, fitted for bringing to light all such general and local facts of configuration of the coast ~s are important to navigation, commerce, and local interests or improvements. Secondly.' it aims to present in the most correct, useful, and popular form, the dclinc4tions, discoveries,

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

and developments resulting from this system of field observations. The various operations of the survey fall into two great .classes in conformity with theRe specified objects, being either, 1st, .ffrld-work; or, 2d, office-work. In the first is em braced the series of reconnaissance, astronomical, magnetic, trigonometrical, iopographi ... al, hydrographic, tidal, and current observations, all of which, as they are macle, are duly entered in their appropriate records ; and thus the field-work has produced that aggregate of note-books and sheets, topographical and h~иclrographic, which constitutes the office archives. The class of officework embraces all the operations by which this mass of materials is wrought over and elaborated to the final forms of publication, whether as maps, charts, reports, or results. The crude observations require to he reduced and discussed in the computing division to deduce latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, distances, and tidal results, and each hydrographic party plots its own soundings in the office. The drawing division expends, on the materiuJs thus supplied, all the resoun:es of graphic art in producing, as connectellly as possillle, pictorial representations of the com hined geodetic, topographical, an<l hydrographic results for each locality in turn. The engraving division has for its specific office to form for the printer's use, of the drawings thus made, an enduring record in copperplates, as also of the tide-tables, sailing directions, and descriptive notes, furnished with, or aside from, the drawings; it has, indeed, to assemble, arrange, and engrave all the elements of perfect maps and charts. The elcctrotypist next takes a relief~east, or alto, and from this as many identical copper-plate copies, or bassos, as may he required. The printer goes on to print from the8e bassos whatever stock of impressions, on paper, may be needed to meet the demands of commerce, navigation, and local interests, as indicated by the requisitions of the local sale-agents, and the orders for distribution established by law. All these 01rnrations, while proceeding under their own special directions, are kept co-ordinated and in due relations by a general direction. It may thus be seen, that while the fieldoperations produce the raw materials of geography and hydrography, the office-operations are applied to the manufacture, from these materials, of faithful maps and charts, to meet the national demand. The principles and economy of a manufacturing art and establishment will, therefore, be found to apply to the direction and execution of the office-operations. In this manufacturing organization, the engraving division enters as a subordinate but essential component, requiring to be maintained not only in healthful operation within itself, hut also in adequate and just relation8 with the co-ordinate divisions, and with the amount ofиfield-work t.o be published. The organic form under which the engraving division is now established has resulted from experience of' what is needed, arnl from the progressive expansion of the engraving operations consequent on the extension of field-work into each of the eleven sections of oul' coast. On reverting to the date of your entrance on the su1ierintendency, but. slight traces of the present condition of office-engraving are met. In 1843 three engravers were employed, but only three sheets of maps had been published up to 1844. An accumulation of nearly ten years of back-work was then to be engraved, and great efforts were required to bring up these arrears, without permitting the new work to fall behind; efforts which cannot even yet be relaxed. It was necessary to augment the force of engravers, to arrange and systematize the work on hand, to provide for its distribution according to the capacities of individual engravers, to determine the fitness of engravers out of the office properly to execute plates by contract, to make from time to time such contract arrangements, to study and analyze prices for each species of work, and, in general, to exercise forethought, vigilance, and administrative capacity in giving organized efficiency to the work of engraving. While very much of this burden fell on yourself and the assistants in charge of the office, (successively Captain Eakin, Captain Humphreys, Major Stevens, and Captain Benham,) it was a source of special congratulation that, from 1844 to 1846, the fine tase and excellent capacities of Assistant Farley, and from 1847 to 1850 the graphic skill and faithful services of Assistant Fairfax, were aYailable for the more immediate charge and the detailed administration of engraving matters. The style and usages of the engraving division, as now established, bear strong traces of Captain Humphrey's close investigations and judicious electicism. The style of view and top~graphical engraving which has been so succesFfully adopted for the Western coast reconnarnisance-maps, is in great part a monument of Mr. McCoy's artistic felicity, and of the vigorous grappling with new problems which distinguished the office career of Major Stevens. The skill of Siebert, Rolle, Dankworth, Knight, McCoy, e.nd other en-

gravers, has risen to meet the emergencies and demands which frequently occur in the expanding work of the Survey, and it is due to them that practice has been so close a follower of the instructions and conditions under which the\' have worked. It would 11e an unjust omission here not to notice that many perfections or'detail, and especially the general harmonizing of styles, arc due to your own frequent room-inspections of engraving in progress during your first. years of superintendence, and, more recently, to your critical examinations of, and comments on, the quarterly file of proofs, and such special proofs aR have presented open questions. It is also hut just to remark that, at a time when arrears of engraving hung so heavily on the office, the availability for contract-engraving on several small harbor plates, of the skill combined in Sherman and Smith's establishment, was truly a kindness of fortune. A candid retrospection over the office map engraving certainly affords much reason for congratulation by reason of its aggregate onward progre8s. The entire range of map and chart publication furnished at first no satisfactory model for imitation, but it was then alike essential to push rapidly forward the work in hand, and, in so doing, to develop a more perfect and finished model of chart-work than had anywhere been produced. In both these respects, just grounds for satisfaction exist, and it is not too much to claim a higher finish and more perfect elaboration for the best Coast Survey charts than is exhibited in any others of which we have anr knowledge. In the early days of the office organization, the drawing and engraving needed no separation, and you placed them first, in 1844, under Mr. Farley's charge. This was the beginning of an organization which has grown with the growth of the work, and which has required yearly division and subdivision to adapt it to the present expansion of the work. T. C. The engraving division, as at present constituted, is under the charge of Lieut . и Clark, U.S. A., with a clerical assistant, and embraces seven regular engravers, (of whom four or five are first-class artists,) six apprentices in various stages of training, and indirectly two standing emplo,ves on contract work, with several others, who, from time to time, are employed on jobs or rates, as circumstances require. Ten of these are topographical engravers or apprentices, and five are letterers. It is very desirable somewhat to increase the first-class force, but so great is the demand in this country for skilful engravers in the bank-note and book-illustration departments, and so small relativel>и is that for superior topographical engravers, that the best talent is absorbed mainly in the former channels, leaving it a difficult matter to procure satisfactory artists in the number desired for the office-work. It is hence quite im11ortant to keep each engr:Fer steadily at work in his highest style, and with this view, to arrange the work as long beforehand as practicable. During Captain Humphrey's office administration, the burden of definitely arranging work lay chiefly on him, and his arrangements were carried out by Mr. Farley and Mr. Fairfax. Under Major Stevens the same practice prevailed, especially after the transfer of Mr. Fairfax to the drawing division, and continued in a diminishing degree during the few months in which I had charge of the engraving division, as also through the subsequent period of Mr. Tinkham's occupancy of that position. After Mr. Tinkham иs resignation, the brief terms of service by Captain Gibson, myself, and Captain Oakes, with Mr. Tennent to aid in details, were markell by no great change of administrative arrangement; and now, under Lieut. Clark, the direction involves the same free consultation with the assistant in charge of the office on all essential points. I cannot but remark here on the Preat disadvantae-e arising from the changes which have so frequently been found necessary m the charge of the engraving division. This results in a sad loss of experience and knowledge, and i-?- the. unsteady application of th.e engravers' powers ; both of which seriously retard and Impair the work executed. It IS not easy to sum up the amount of special knowledge which a chief of engraving should possess, for on him depend not only the proper distribution of current work and all the detailed arrangements for its execution but also it is chiefly from him that improved styles, methods, and regulations must be ex: pectcd to proceed, as certainly by him they must all be tested. On him, too, rests a great responsibility for giving to the apprentices a right training, both as young engravers and as young men, and it is by him that a general spirit of activity and intelligence must be communicated to those under his charge. The position should be one of great labor, and is one worthy to call forth the powers of a vigorous mind, filled with deep faith in progress everywhere, and most of all in this very art of engraving.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

In passin" to the consideration of engraving as a branch of the fine arts, and of map enO'raving a~ involving its own distinctive artistic principles, it is evident that only the m~t practical vie1n of the case can be ventured on. To omit this higher phase of the subject, would be a most unpardonable omission, because map engraving is peculiarly prone to sink to the leYel of merely mechanical routine work; a deplorable lapse, which can only encl in a dq, cold, insignificance of style, alike degrading to the artist and subYersive of the art. In rnnst brnncl1ei; of practical art, the cxtиn:isc of fancy, the culture of idealism, and the spiritual significance of the subjects treated, suffice to keep alive the artist's interior powers; but engraving, especially when the subjects arc inanimate and wanting in aerial perspective, has a eonsttmtly operative tendency to obliterate from the engraver's mind all uctive conceptions of such truths and principles as transcend the petty dexteritie8 of execution. At Dusseldorf, the gerne and ideal schools of painting co-exist in powerful competitive action. Each most happily reacts on the other, for the idealists infuse somewhat of their poetic mysticism into the too rigid imitative delineators, while tlie stern truth of the gerne artists ch astern; extravagance and unnatural fantasies from the canvass of tlie introspective iilmlists. But no D11sseltlorf is possible for the topographical engraver. If he be not иwholly arnl conscientiously gc1иne in his art, he must be a moral culprit, falsifying the natural sul~ject which he is called upon literally to render. Ideal to1JOgraphy or hyclrography is a criminal counterfeit. Neither bas he depth of aerial perspective to stimulate bis study of nature, or to habituate him to that subtle perception of effects desired and attainPd, which 1iecomes like an added sense to the landscape engraver. Hence he is too prone to assume that topography has no elements of a fine art, and to rest content иwith neat and dexterous execution; a conclusion equally false and unfortunate. No man can be a first-class topographical engraver who is destitute of the essential qualities of an artist, as, of course, none but a genuine artist can do even tolerable justice to the various headland and harbor иdews required on the series of charts. The engraver who ignores art can only accumulate topographical lines and dots in spiritless ranks l,y literal copyism from hiR drawing, or in unreaRoning conformity to conventional rules. But it is the engraver's duty to rise above his model in the elemenfa of expression, and to render nature with a fidelity and spirit such as no mere system can teach. Ruskin has expended a vast affiuenee of argument and eloquence in maintaining the need of minute fidelity to the very species of rockR and trees in landscape painting ; not by literal delineation, but liy the clear display of wh&tever constitutes the prime characteristics of each species. If such adherence to fact is justly demanded in landsca11e art, where fancy is permitted so much scope, and where the variations of composition demanded by taste are confessedly legitimate, bow much more is the topographer hound to 1nиesent the real specific character of the various species of hills, fieldR, trees, coasts, &c., which he is called upon to represent. How fine a sense of natural truth and characteristic attributes should be exacted from him who is to express endmingly in copper the rocky shores of New England, the clay banks of the Chesapeake, the sand btиaches of the Carolinas, and the bluff headlands of our Pacific sea-margin. All this lmr<lcn of high fidelity cannot justly be thrown on the drawing division, for no engraver is a thoroughly good tovographical artist who cannot lend a still superior grace and fidelity of manner, a purer and finer tone of execution, even to the exquisite drawings of Fairfax, l\foClery, and ~Welch, or to the softly bold hills of J,ambert and Herbst. The dry-point of Siebert, and the etching-needle of McCoy, have an art 11ower which no drawing-pen r1ossesses; nor would any written exemplar of lettering have guided Knight in the execution of such letter bodies as those on the lower Delaware Hbcet. 'Vhile no zeal in perfecting the drawings should on any account be abated, it is a truth which cannot be safely forgotten, that our map engravers must themselves, through arfo1t culture and persistent effort, vindicate their rightful claims to fellowship with the noble art brotherhood. Three distiuct elements of delineation require to be combined by the topographical engraver: 1st. The outlines, or horizontal configuration, embracing all boundary lines of fields, road,s, streamH, coast, houses, &c., which must be accurately traced and transferred to tlie plate by th~ aid of projecting or locating squares. 2d. The undulations of ground or surface :tluctuatwns mnRt he represented by horizontal curves called contours, or by the lines of steepest dcRcent eall1иd hachures. 3d. The indications of fields, grass, marsh, mnd, sanct, forest, &c., are to be added in such a manner as to exhibit the entire occu-

OF THE UNITED ST.A.TES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

*205

pancy of the ground. The lettering should, if possible, always intervene between the outlines and hachurcing; a step embracing the title, sailing directions, notes, soundings arnl bottoms, with all names of objects and localities. Placing lettering on hachurcd and surface indicated work risks the harmon:и of effect, and it is quite essential to introduce soundingR, &c., before sanding. Besides, the lettererиs gauge-lines must he hurnished or coaled out at an essential sacrifice of depth in any previous topographical work over which they ext.end. The system of hachures emplo>иed in the office is a modification of Lehman's, and the light is assumed as yertical. Though an oblique light would give stronger hill effects, and more aerial perspectiYc, its advantages are partial, and involve a sacrifice of that strict equity which di,;tinguishes an orthographic light, and >Yhich a true artist can combine with excellent slope and shade expression. 'l'he description and history of the modified Lehman style used in the Coast Survey belong rather to that of the drawing than of the engraving division. A question of great importance, and one not lightly to be anRwered, here occurs, concerning the llroper ])olicy for the office to adopt relatinи to Rpccializing the styles and ca1mcities of the individual c11graYers. It i8 characteristir~ of the ruder stages of all arts and manufactures that a single lrnnd Jias manifold firnctions. Each progressiw step narrowR the Rphere of indiYidual action, and concentrates a more undivided attention on the narrowed field. The individual tlms becomes merged in a train of processes to which he contributes but his humble mite; thus the lofty and generalizing, hut somewhat rude, spirit is bowed to the mechanical, pettr perfoction of one idea. The good result is mechanical perfection and faciliJr: tl1e had is mannerism and narrowed indiYidual capacitr. Thus, in engraving, Mr. vVilRon Lowry, of London, invented the engraver's ruling machine, which was appliell to ruling skies. As a consequence, I understand that nearly all the machine sky-ruling executed in London is done at a single eRtablishment. Thr result iF that London plates exhibit a mechanical perfection and softness in the skies which is an unceasing wonder. But, on the other hand, a mannerism, the most obvious, runs through them all, and wearies the eye with i1eration interminahle. Apparently, the sky rulers have reduced sky-ruling to a system, convenient in practice, giving great delicacy in execution, and only marred hy its reHulting monotony and non-conformit_,. with the endless variety in the sky itself. So in the topographical work of the Coast Surnиy Office, the channel lies between Scylla and Charybdis. To give one cngraYcr a great yariety of work lowers his mechanical mastery of each species, while too long concentration on one species tends to sink the artiHt in the: mechanic, anrl to form a manner no longer pliant with the varying characteristics of our kaleidoscopic coast. It is a well settled fact in general that the same artist should not be both a topographical and a letter engraver. But it is not so clear that one should do hills only, another sand only, another only fields, woods, and cities, and another only views. The exigencies of current work do much towards the practical regulation of this minter, but it is also, in part, an open, a free question. In view of the great value of improvements in style, and of the necessity of expanding individual capacities for this purpose, it seems desirable to have each topographical engr:1Yer practised in all branches of topography. Nor am I at all persuaded, that on the whole, and for a life-time, an engraver will the more excel in hachureing by being always restricted to that branch. The whole engraver is needed as a basis for the best hachureing artist. Besides, mannerism, even of the highest order, is a sad penalty, which waits with unrelenting punctuality on an excessive and sustained subdivision of work, and when its hold is once fastened- on the office, release will be indeed a forlorn hope. Timely caution is wisdom. It is a grate.fol reflection, that despite the routine and mechanical tendencies of the graver and needle m these elahorate days, genius has immortal rights, now as ever. Though the powerful handling of Albert Durer aud Raimondi, the strength, the freedom, the boldness of the renowned old Italian, German, and French masters of engraving, must be in part ascribed to the enthusiasm of the poetic or heroic a.ge of this art; yet much was due to their individual genius, and genius still retains its old prerogative, now as then impressing its own splendors on its products. The office history of a chart plate, from beginning to end, may he thus summed up. The project and complete drawing of a chart being received in the engraving rooms from the drawing division, the iirst step is to have a plate cut out of the desired size; this is done in the electrotype rooms, where the blank copper for this purpose is kept. 'fhis ?opper is usually planished and polished by Mr. Burdett, of Baltimore, of sizes ordered from the office, the size for large charts being given exactly, while other large plates are also

206*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

ordered for cutting up. The planished copper is carefully inspected by an engraver and the electrotypist, to insure its being of good quality, well planished, and (ree from flaws and ash-holes. Some plates of electrotype copper are used. It is quite certain that all may thus be made of the quality desired, and every way as good as the planished plates. When the plate is cut out, and its edges smoothed, it is sent to the drawing division to have the neat lines and the pr~jection of parallels and meridians, or the transfer squares, drawn on it, by which to lay down the tracing from the drawing. If convenient, the neat lines, border, and scales may then be engraved. With a point, the engraver traces the outlines of the drawing on a sheet of fish glue, or on tracing pa1)er, with a pencil, a square at a time. The fish-glue lines are filled with plumbago, and a coat of wax is flashed over the surface of the heated plate. The tracing being accurately reversed on the wax-coat by aid of the squares, the 1ilumbago is made to adhere to the wax by rubbing the back or going over the lines of the tracing. Detaching the tracing, the engraver, with a point, draws all the lines through the wax lightly in the copper. Remo"l'ing the wax, he next proceeds with a graver or dry-point to cut the outlines firmly in the plate, hill-contours or other auxiliary lines excepted. In the French Survey, the outlines and contours are transferred from the plane-table sheets to the copper-plates by means of the pantograph, but the variety of scales and the combination of sheets in reducing, make this plan far less available for the Coast Survey. The next step is to pass the plate to the letterer, who executes the title, sailing directions, notes, tide-tables, soundings and bottoms, latitudes and longitudes, magnetic variations, and the general lettering of places, objects, points, &c., as far as the material warrants, when the plate is returned to the topographical engraver, who, with the drawing and plane-table sheet before him, proceeds to cut in the hachnres, along and perpendicular to the traced contours, these contours alone sufficing for some engravers, who find the hachures of the drawing quite unnecessary. The indications of woods, marsh, mud, grass, tilled fields, dry sand, rocks, &c., are next added. The wet sanding, dotted in, relative to the selected curves of depth, must then be executed, if it has not been sooner done. Views of headlands and harbor entrances following next in order, are chiefly etched in, the graver being used for finishing, and the ruling-machine, with a diamond point, for water and sky. The supplementary lettering is completed, and the whole work verified to correct errors, discover deficiencies, and remedy petty faults of style or work. The seal and verification, price, presentation sentence, artists' names, &c., are added, and on final approval by the Superintendent the plate is considered done. During all this time frequent proofs are taken, on which the work is freely examined. Erasures are often ma(lc with the burnisher and scraper, and when it is necessary to rest.ore the plane face thus hollowed out, the plate is beaten up from the hack by laying its face on an anvil. The burr made by the g-raver and point is removed by the scraper and by coaling. The finished plate is then electrotyped or put in alto as soon ~s possible, no unnecessary impressionii being taken prior to that step. From the electrotype duplicates or bassos the printer proceeds to print the number required, leaving the original intact. In cases where extensive erasures are to be made, it is cheaper to make an alto, erase the relief lines from it, and then take a basso for the new work, than it is to erase on the original, beat up, and restore injured work. By aid of the electrotype process, also, plates are extended to receive additional work ; large plates are subdivided, executed in parts, and then rejoined, to facilitate or hasten the work on them; views are taken from one plate and inserted into another, and blank copper-plates are made of any desired quality.. . The lettering of maps and charts is a process of the utmost importance, both to their utility and their beauty. Indeed, no other class of engraved subjects is so dependent on the taste and skill of the letterer as these are, and more especially the charts. The expression of good topography will be almost ruined by the contiguity of lettering, either graceless in itself, or inharmonious with the other work. In charts, the title, the names, sailing directions, notes, tide tables, scales, soundings, and bottoms, make up so large a portion of the engraved matter, that a lack of success in this branch cannot fail to ruin the appearance of the whole chart. Nor is this success easily commanded. It requires from the letterer not only a graceful formation of the letter, but an artistic appreciation of the effects due to the distribution and spacing of letter sizes, words, and bodies of lettering. To preserve the balance of a sheet, to give to each part its due prominence and no more, to arrange titles tastefully, and to give names due relief and due subordination, are essentials demanding the endowments and eye of an artist. Though called the most mecha.nica.l branch en-

of

graving practice, truly good lettering is no mere journeywork. The formation of letters should be graceful, their lines geometrical, their size true to the prescribed gauge-lines, and each letter should in all places be consistent with itself, its neigh hors, and the style to which it belongs. The adoption of the 11lain English letter in the office, and the entire rejection of all fancy styles and flourishes, has been a great safoguard against errors, and haR produced a single and essentially homogeneous sty le in all the office charts. Yet it is astonishing to what an extent effects can be varied within these restrictions, even in plain bodies of stum11 of the same gauge, simply by varying the light and beaYy strokes, by opening or closing the letter extensions, and by changing the slight eltment8 of letter formation. The effect of different scales on lettering is an element too much overlooked. In engraving soundings, bottoms, and currents, clearness is absolutely essential, as also is their accurate trarn;for. The style of figures ought to lie such as not to prejudice the subsequent sanding, and the selection of soundings such as duly to fill and yet not to overcrowd the water-spaces. Letter work is peculiarly adapted to contract execution, as well-established rates for each species of letter can be readily applied, and as good letterers out of the office are less rare than good topographical engravers. The French Depot de la guerre has laid down detailed instructions for lettering maps. (Memorial Topographique ct l\1ilitaire, No. 5.) The lettering now in use was thoroughly studied hy the superintendent, by Capt. Humphreys, and Assistant John Farley. The skill of :McsRrs. Dankworth and Knight was taxed for the forms of the letters ; rules were laid down and specimens prepared for guidance in the various caseR which could occur. The large letters of the titles have always been deemed the least satisfactorv of these results. The proofs, during the progress of a plate, are of grnat importance in regulating its style of work, and in preparing corrections and additions. The files of these, kept in the engraving division, make a complete exhibit of the progress of each plate, and contain much of the original matter. On the quarterly files of proofa is recorded a full statement of the work during the quarter on each plate, by whom done, how applied, its cost and character. A ledger-book of plates, some fow gaps excepted, gives the detailed history of each plate. Much material has accumulated, showing the cost of each kind of work on different scales, which is used as a basis for estimates in making contracts. It is highly desirable to give greater accuracy and compass to these analyses of cost; but this can only be done satisfactorily hy giving special attention to the subject during a considerable period, in which a Rteady and laborious administration of the division shall prernil. The daily reports of occupation, the monthly reports and projects of the division, the quarterly :files, re110rt, and project, and the yearly report and project, form the chief administrative papers, and, with the vouchers for payments, are duly fi.led. Files of business letters, standing orders, map projects, and cases of the materials and instruments used by the engravers, are kept in the division chief's room. The charge of papers, the preparation and distribution of work, the inspection of it when done, its verification, the preparation of pay vouchers, the charge of apprentices, the study of and reports on subjects relating to engraving, and the division operations-these duties exact close and vigorous application from the head of this important division. To make each engraver's work tell to the utmost, to bring forward the apprentices well and judiciously, to judge character and capacities aright, to be alert for what is new and well-versed in what is old, are among the difficult requisites appertaining to this position. A detailed technical consideration of the several styles and processes of engraving would require too great an extension of this report, and is moreover quite unnecessary, as full information thereon can be found in various treatises on the arts in several encyclopedias, and especially in Perrot's excellCJlt Manual du Graveur, in the Roret 1<eries. The technical details will also be found to constitute the portion of knowledge which is most especially the common stock among intelligent engravers. In the Coast Survey Office no use has yet been made of wood engraving, mezzotint, chalk engraving, engraving in colors, zincography or steel engraving, and the use of lithography has been restricted chiefly to the annual report sketches. Wood engraving is not likely to be resorted to unless it be for some mechanical drawings in the report, for which it may prove usefo.l, as a means of economy, in printing large editions without transfers on stone. As woodcuts work with the letter-press directly, they should, when equally appropriate, be used for large editions in preference to any basso style of printing. Mezzotint is quite impossible in the office so long as the present topographical system prevails. Aquatint has only been used

208*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

in a single instance, partly because aquatint is wholly unfit for transfers on stone. It is not likely to be of service so long as copper-plates are used, as it gives too few impressions. Should hill shading ever be tried instead of lrnehures, this process would deserve cultivation, for analogous cases of its successful use are frequent in physical geography. It is my impression that it has been tried for hill shading in the ordnance survey office, at the time when the medal ruling- machine was made to engrave hill models, and other topographical experiments were undertaken. There is in the West Point library an extensive atlas, in which the hills are shaded, l presume, with lithographic crayons. Chalk engraving, engraving in colon;, the Baxter process, zylography, the cerographic process, the anastatic process, chromolithogra11hy, lithographic crayon, or two crayons, and many more processes, which иare useful in their own spheres, are in nowise likely to become of service in the Coast Survey Office. Zincography, as it now exists in this country, is entirely too coarse for office use; but in France it stands much higher, and I have been told ▒hat original drawings are transferred to zinc with great success in Prussia. Lithographic autography is not, however, in such a condition in this country as to make resort to it advisable. For engraving in relief, wood, zinc, lithographic stone, eopper, and steel, have been used with various degreeH of success ; boxwood being far the most employed. The material used at the Smithsonian Imtitution for stereotyping seems to possess some remarkable capacities for this purpose, if I may judge from some 8ketche~ of promising aspect thus proJnceu. Relief engraving is certainly of far greater prospective value than depressed or basso engraving, because of its indefinite capacity of being cheaply printed on the power-press, as is well illustrated by thu rn5,000 impres~iom regularly worked from the pages of Harper's Magazine. Each page of this publication is electrotyped, a copper film coating type and woodcuts alike, anu type metal is melted into the back of the copper shell to give it the required thickness: thus both woodcuts and type arc converted into a relief copper-plate, from which the prints are worked off. For office purposes, none of the relief printing processes seem yet to be applicable, though it is posRible they may be so in the future. Whether it will in any case be advisable to have engraving done on stone for the office can scarcely now be asserted; for while work can be done on stone in.a passable style, it is not now customary so to do it, and hence it would now be inexpedient to try engraving on stone, except it be for work on a larger scale than is customary in the office, or economical in the printing. I have elsewhere treated the subject of lithographic transfers. (Coast Survey Report, 1853.) A question of considerable importance is sometimes raised, relative to the substitution of steel for rop1)er plates in the office engraving. The advantages of such a change would be an increased durability of the r1lateR, and a saving of electrotype duplication ; the disadvantages, greater cost in the :first irn;tance, and less facility for erasures. Though the cost of engraving a subject in steel with the graver and dry-point certainly exceeds that of doing the same on copper hy a very essential fraction, this fraction seems to be a progressively diminishing one, and so far as etching is concerned, has no existence. But the great mass of the work now clone on the office plates is done with the tools, and etching has led only a precarious existence there. It has only been used for the views and reconnaissance topography, many of the views even not having been etched. '.l'he introduction of steel would naturally hring with it. a great inerease of etching; but still the graver would have much to do in finishing and harmonizing the etched work. The avoidance of electrotype duplication would, it seems to me, be a very questionable advantage ; for without it the original plates can never be sufficiently safe against accidents. Even with steel plates, duplication would appear essential for security. Again it would be in practice a serious drawback that steel is less fitted for erasure and beating up, since a very great 6-IDOunt of erasure is now required by errors and revisions of field and office work, and hy new data and surveyR. On the whole, the objections to a change from copper to steel seems quite to outweigh its _advantages, aside from all consideration of the temporary inconveniences incident to Huch a step. Stippling, as generally understood, can scarcely be said to form a part of the office-work, though this includes a remarkably great amount of sanding, which is in fact a peculiar stippling. Although generally done with the tool, it is in some cases etched, and this, too, with fine effect. 'Vhether the office sanding could not be done, at least in part, by other and more- advantageous means than those now employed, is a question well worthy to be entertained. So great is its amount that improvementи here would tell largely on the

general style and economy of engraving. The roulette style of work seems to me worthy a rigorous arnl irn1iartial trial, with a Yiew to test its adaptedness for chart sanrlin;J:; at kast that of the lower Rt~иle, such as is used in tbc sketches. The French have long uRcJ. t11e roulette for the delicate Rpecies uf work in imitation of crayon drn1viug, for ,,Jiich the full set of rouletteR u~ed amounts to a1>out forty. Stippling with tlie graYer and dry-point has, in the hands of Byland aud other Engli~h artists, achieved rmd1 ~uccess, tlmt it seem~ hut a re11Rouahle antici:imtion to expect from the' roulette a satisfaetory and (~conomical Rtyle of sanding, which can al~o lie printed by transfer. It is an instrument requtrinх; skill in its use to insure success; but, fortunately, :;}fr. Dougal, 9f \Y ashington, possesses this essential to a degree indicating him as Oil<' fit to try SUCh fill experiment. The graver, the clry-1wint, and the etching-needle arc so familiar to all who are conversant with engraving, and are used in the office in modes so little peculiar, as to demand no special notice. I might remark that the etching topography of Jl.IcCoy has sometimes made me call in question the preponderance of graver and dry-11oint work; but the exquisite hill work of Siehcrt is always a powerful vimlicator of the cutting-tool;;;. 'Yl't there is a freedom of movement in the etching-needle which nothing else can giYe, and which bears one back in thought to Albert Durer, Remhrant, Van Dyck, and 8alrntor Rosa, fluently expressing the noble conceptions of genius thiиuu~h thiH humhk but l1orlllred medium. Permanentl;- to maintain the engraring diYision in a state of healthy and progressive action, demands an earnest care and solicitude respecting the education of those composing it. Even the most proficient have neerl to be constantly a1ha11cing themselvps in their knowledge and practice of this art, so narrow as a mere handicraft, 1rnt so boundless in its capacities and relations. As the older engravers pasR from the stage, the younger ones must rise to their 11laces and achieve an equal proficiency. But mPrely to remain stationary is not enough in this case ; }irogress is needed from year to year, and progress can only come as a reward for well-directed efforts. It is only by superior education, cop curring with favoring opportunities, that a steady, forward impulse can be communicated to an art peculiarly prone to inertness. The apprentices nnrnt Le formed by appropriate educational appliances to that. mature and liYing mastery of their vocation which we Ree exemplified in those now grown veterans in its exercise. Natural capacities must exist to bl' trained, and deliberate means must second nature, as preliminaries t.o any good result. N~lt alone by slight-of-hand, or the 1mulless dexterities of Jong practice, can an apprentice become a true engraver; but a full comprehension of the means, scope, and spirit of his art must go before success. A ta;;te chastened and matured, an eye trained and sensitive, a zeal earnest and not purely mercenary, a mind active and observant, a culture liberal and appropriate, a i1atient and industrious schooling in lHactice, and, above all, high-toned character: these arc among the elements which need to concur in an apprentice who is to rise into the first rank of engravers, and give new development to the resources of his profession. To continue importing all the best office engravers from Europe is a very unsatisfactory policy; to procure men trained to the higher styles of office-work from the workshops of our country is now impossible, and it only remains to. form apprentices by such an educfltion as shall give their natural talents the desired direction and unfolding. Here is no place to discuss the special means of culture most proper to this end, or whether the present methods are the best. Suffice it now to indicate the absolute importance of giving to them the utmost attainable efficiencv. The introduction of apprentices into the office seems to have resulted from some such reflection on your part in 1845, when Messrs. Ruth and Petit were first thus employed. .. iБ.s neither imperative To forecast the future of engraving, and especially that of ma~s,,. nor possible. It is well, however, clearly to realize that such a fullll is coming4 and that it can scarcely be a reproduction of the present. :. Maso Finiguerra gave definite form to his discovery of printing \om plate .. e!l,gravings in the middle of the fifteenth century, Since then many minds of excellen.,~ity, anrl not a few of exalted genius, have expended their earnest efforts in the pra.A-~nd promotion of etching and tool engraving. Yet this four humlred yuars of labor and hope, left to the last few years manifold discoveries in this very field. Perkins, of Boston, who m:ide steel engraving a possible art, died hardly two years since, and wood engraving owe~ to an American of this century the introduction of boxwood, and its consequent astonishing expansion.

REPOR'l' OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

the rude scrawls of the >:avage in the sand, the strange caricatures of the olcl geographers, the charts of Mercator, the AtlaR Homanni, the maps of Tardieu, Oassini, Arrowsmith, &c., not to dwell on tlie woodcut maps of the Chinese, older and more self-conceited than all. From these there has, during the last half century, been a rapid progress to the contoured and hachurecl maps of the various national trigonometrical RnrveyR still a(lvancing. The rude, fantastic, grossly erroneous configuration, the silent blunlrness, the a1>surd papillffi mountain ranges, the set 'vrigglings of rivers, the giant forests stocked with visible lions and alligators, the huge terrcr incognitcr, and the high-wrought illuminations on corners and margins: these all belong to achistoric yesterday, and linger on maps of our own country, pulJfo;hed long su1Jsequent to the dawn of onr nationality. When we insхect a finished Coast Survey map, it is quite impossible that we should bear in mind through what a singular chain of progression, through what slow and laborious dawnings of truths now elementary and seemingly self-evident, through what difficulties of the engraving art, and what absurdities, incongruities, and incapacities of delineation, the laborious product of to-day has de~cended from the uncouth handicraft of Munster, Ortelius, Meyer, and Mercator. Ere another century shall have passed, some critic of antiquarian bias may possibly comment on the Coast Survey Eastern Series, on comparing it with a corresponding issue of his own day, as we now do on comparing the old and new maps of Switzerland, or the Cassiui and Depdt de la Guerre maps of France. New arts of engraving may so expand the present possibilities in map production, that genius, glorying in its new enlargement, shall outdo immeasurably its own antecedents. 'Why may not such anticipations find their rea1ization hrre, in the country, of all, grandeRt in itR geography and most inventive in its capacity? Why not, possibly, in the progress of this very survey, which has already clone its part towards this encl, directly by fostering topographical skill, and indirectly by its electrotype discoveries, which have diffused the cost of engraving over an indefinite number of unimpaired impressions? One needs but to olJserve the intense activity of investigation and invention now at work on engraving and printing processes, and to recall the vast contributions of resource which science has of late bestowed towards their ends, to be assured that many new arfai of 1iictorial reproduction will soon be busily promoting the public good. The name of Daguerre still lingers in our cars as almost that of a living man. Yet, well nigh in every town, in every city-street, are daguerreotype saloons, and scarcely a family is without its invaluable store of daguerreotypes. Photography has grown into a science, and has its treatises and journals, which arc constantly teeming with new processes. The younger Niepce, not content with reflected honors, in 1847 announced a process for making drawings engrave themselves. Probably heliogra11hic engraving owes its origin to him, and his process has given ample promise of success, as was placed in evidence before your eyes by a print which the distinguished inventor furnished, over a year since, to the Scientific American. The names of Donne, Talbot, and Claudet, are already associated with processes of this nature, and many other less prominent investigators have also borne part. It is announced in Moigno's Cosmos of May 26, 1854, that Baldus has completely succeeded in a new and easy process of hcliographic engraving. A photograph of any subject is taken and made to engrave itself hv the action of light; the details are not given. The time is teeming with such announcements. Fortunately, Mr. Mathiot, no remiss sentinel, is on the lookout for all such prizes, being himself in the full tide of like experiments, and destined, I trust, to complete success. What he has already done gives assurance that he will bear an honored Jlart in the great revolution of art which seems to be portending. Whether when heliography becomes '~n established art, the engravers will find their occupation gone, is an inquiry which can 8afoly be postponed until they are in less active demand thatat present. A fow years since, anastatic printing was much discussed, and fears of counterfeits only kept pace wjth the e~pectat.ions of very cheap Jae simile reprints from all old and new books. The hopes, ~ars, and excitement, almost the name, have died away. It remains a fact, however, that Appleton, of New York, is now extensively re-printing large line engravings from EngliHh and other foreign proofs without re-engraving ; aud though the re-prints are inferior in quality, they still have an essential fidelity. Scarcely a week since, a new process or art, called homceography, was heralded, claiming to be a revolution as sweeping as anastatic printing was to have been; and for this art the world is indebted to M. Boyer, a French chemist. It stereotypes by producing re-print6 from stone cheaply and quickly.

It duplicates engraved prints with entire facility, and promises vastly. Probably it will perform something, and in some way hecome really useful. It is quite certain that books cannot be re-printed from stone cheaply in considerable editions. Engraved prints can n0w he re-produced and multiplied in various mechanical ways and without re-engraving. v\'"hat is to come is beyond conjecture, but I do not believe the electrotnle art of renewing plateB will soon he superseded. I cannot here omit to mention the :>trikingly beautiful results afforded by a process, some two years old, called "nature printing." Such perfect and delicate rendering of leaves in their details of frame-work and veinings, as this process gives for thoRe of appropriate texture, I have never before seen. By a strong pressure the leaf is rolled into a soft metal plate, and thus im1Jrints or fossilizes itself. .From this plate impressions are obtained, which, when well colored, rfral even the exquisite photographs of natural history specimens lately pulllished in Paris by Blanquart Evrard. 'l'he photographs and nature prints are sold at rates not higher than corresponding prints of other kinds, if such there be. Subjects like Algre, (Smithsonian Contributions, HarYey,) if sufficiently firm, would, I presume, find nature printing their best interpreter, as, in the Paris photographs, the Crustacea of the Museum have lost nothing in fidelity and gained much in beauty. It is not alone from new engrnving processes, a few only of "'hi ch I have now mentioned, that the style of maps may be expected to undergo change. It is by no means certain that the prevailing Rystem of topography will be immortal. This subject would hardly belong in a report on engraving, were it not that the powers of the engraving arts enter as a most essential element in fixing the system of topography. The method of hachures has some radical faults, which make its perpetuity only desirable in case nothing better can he substituted. The extent to which it sacrifices the distinctness of the contour lines will, as contours become more universal in surveys, be felt as a growing objection. When the engineer needs to use the horizontal curves of a locu.lity, he will most emphatically prefer a system which gives them plainly, to this system of liachures, among which the tracing of contours is a task always troublesome and never quite certain in its results. Hachure engraving is so expensive that a cheaper substitute is quite desirable. It seems by no means impossible that ere long some cheap, clear, expressive and tasteful system of hill delineation may supersede hachures with great advantage. There are now at the Crystal Palace, New York, specimens of topography by l\fr. James Duncan, England, in a style which he calls triotinto, and in which the hill problem seems to be well apprehended. The contours are drawn in a clear delicate line, very similar to that of the medal ruling-machine. These, alone, would give a very satisfactory relief to the hills, as was well known from the experiments on that style, except in the liability to an entire inversion of elevations and depressions, and in a certain hardness of look. But in the specimens referred to, shading under an oblique light is used to add to the relief, and it also gives softness and pictorial expression. 'l'his shading is executed by some means undescribed, but which seems to be the roulette or stippling. The specimens arc evidently early attempts in a new style, but experience would undoubtedly so far improve the execution exhibited, as to bring the results at last fully to equal or excel the best hachured work. The indications of woods, houses, &c., rest on the stippled ground with no less distinctness than on hachures. It is possible that even aquatint shades on full contours might be advantageously resorted to. This subject is one of leading importance ; and sudden changes, for reasons not thoroughly considered, ought strongly to be resisted. But something better than Lehman's system, or any modification of it, seems abstractly very possible, and is being daily rendered more possible in practice by the progress of engraving arts. The combination of contours and dot hill-shading may or may not be a better system. It is not amiss to canvass closely all such ideas and processes; for if improvement is to come, with its sequences of superior results and economical practice, it must be by full, fair, hopeful, and thoroughly critical trial of well-considered candidate systems. и This report is but an imperfect and fragmentary exhibit of a subject not less interesting than extensive. The pictorial arts are among the most powerful ministers to human enjoyment and instruction, and have even now attained a wondrous multiplicity of power and form. What the printing-press does for the written idea, engraving art does for the formal and pictorial. In view of the fruitfulness in contributions, especially to photographic and

APRIL 7, 1854. Srn: Mr. Oltmanns, who had come up in a lugger, reported, immediately on my arrival, that the" GerdeiJ" struck during a sweeping hurricane from the south and southeast, in the night, between the 30th and 31st of March, on the coast east of Bayou Lafourche. * * * * * * * * * I started immediately in an open boat by way of Isle Derniere, and reached the schooner just in time to assist in the final arrangements for her present safety.

a stron~ gale which carried away her main gaff; that at 5 p. m. she made the Southwest Pass, bearing north, distant five miles. The weather being then moderate, her course was laid, steering west by south, for Ship Island channel, so as to give the land a berth of twenty miles. At 8 o'clock it commenced to blow strongly from SE. and E., and the night was so dark that the main-mast could not be seen from the wheel. At 11.30 p. m., by a flash of lightning, breakers were seen close under her lee, and before the helm was fairly down she had struck with tremendous force, and the sea commenced washing over her some ten feet high. 'l'he spoon-drift at the same time prevented all sight or hearing; within three hours a current quite contrary to the ordinary direction had swept the vessel from her course, the wlwlc distance of her offing. At daylight she was found to be nearly a mile west of Fourchon Pass, close to the beach, with only six inches of wat.er under her bows and four feet astern. I attach no blame whatever to the party in charge of the vessel at the time of this disaster, she being on her proper course and carrying such sail as could be brought to bear; moreover, the soundings taken were nearly all of the same character. The entire darkness and the impossibility of hearing the breaking of the sea against the wind, in connection with the sudden and powerful counteraction of current, satisfy me that no agencies not actually 1irought into requisition could have availed for avoiding the disaster. After discharging all the ballast, water-casks, provisions, and, in short, everything movable, the schooner was finally relieved from her perilous condition, but with the loss of boat, swept from its la1>hings on deck, the anchors, both quarter-deck stern-houses, part of starboard rail, and rudder. Sailingmaster :McNeil having shipped a temporary rudder, succeeded in passing the schooner without injury over the second bar, on which was found only three feet of water. She was safely anchored in the Bayou on the 15th of April. At the scene of the disaster the Captain of the Racoon Point light-ship was detained four days by the weather, and rendered us all the assistance in his power. He deserves much credit for his kindness and good will. Very respectfully, your most obedient servant, F. H. GERDES. Prof. A. D. BACHE, Superintendent U. S. Coast Survey.

St"RVEYING STEAMER ACTIVE,

San Francisco, 11.:Iay 16, 1854.

Sm: I have respectfully to report that we have just returned t.o this anchorage,

after an anxiom1, hut, I am happy to Ray, a succeRsfnl search for the steamer Sea Bird. Her machinery it appears broke down on the 7th instant near Point Ano Nuevo, rendering her entirely unmanageable; the same day a boat landed from her at Monterey, with a messenger who travelled overland to San Jose, and from thence telegraphed the information to this place, which "'as received on the morning of the 8th, the day after the accident, stating also that she required immediate assistance; whereupon her owner, Capt. "\Vright, called upon me, and stated that he had used every exertion to obtain a steamer to go aner her, hut that the delay in getting one ready he feared would be fatal to the Sea Bird; I of course consented to go, and at meridian, in less than two hours from the time the news reached me, we were outside of the heads. The same evening at 8 o'clock we arrived at Monterey, and the next day, Tuesday, continued the search as far south as San Simeon, where it was thought she would certainly be found. After remaining at that point all night, during which time we communicated with San Luis Obispo, (which is some thirtyfive miles further to leeward) by an overland messenger, I concluded we must have passed the object of our search on our way down, and determined to retrace our steps. The weather was clear and pleasant, but we returned to 1\lonterey with no tidings of the missing vessel. Here we were told that she had on board at least one hundred souls, including passengers and crew; and this information, although it could not stimulate us to any greater exertion for their rescue than had already been put forth, decided me not to give up the search while the least hope remained; so, with but little delay at Monterey, we again turned our course to the south, and on Friday, the 12th instant, we discovered the object of our search at anchor under Point Conception, in an indentation of the coast, near a small place called on the charts "Coxo," which she had managed to reach after great risk and exertion, by drifting and sailing for the most part stern foremost, as it was found almost impossible to get her before the wind. She had drifted two hundred miles during the time we were looking for her. The damage to her machinery was occasioned by the breaking of the strap which confines the piston-rod to the cross-head, the piston coming down with force enough to crush the lower part of the cylinder. We found the vessel tight and stanch; and no one being inclined to leave her, at 11 o'clock the same evening we took her in tow, and reached this place without accident this morning, stopping at San Luis Obispo six hours, in a blow, and as many hours at Monterey for fuel on our way up.

I have the honor, herewith, to reply. The posi~ion of the reef is as follows: It lies about N. E. and S. W., and by compass the i;iorth light on Cape Elizabeth bears from it N.

and through its centre from north to south the water is quite deep ; which circumstance doubtless gave rise to the belief that there were two distind rrwkl'> or ledges. which rnppo~i tion, I think, is entirely diRprovcd by my recent sun-ey. The rock, as it is called, 1mt which, more properly, should be considered a reef, iR of immense dimensions, extremely irregular in form, having shoal projections on it from four and a half fret to twent~и-four feet, low water. I discovered but one nubble with four and a half feet water on it, one with six feet, several with eight feet, and a very consideralJle number of shoal spots with eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, &e., feet, (all estimated at low water.) The reef lies immediately in the way of all niwigation, and particularly of Ycssels bound for the westward, or of those coming from the harbor of refuge at Itichmond's island. I consider this "the great danger," in approaching Portland harbor; and the key to the lesser ones of the "Hue and Cry," "Old Anthony," and "Taylor's" reefs. It is the cause of much anxiety and care to the navigator; and one that is avoided with the greatest difficulty in thick weather, and during the prevalence of the terrible easterly storms, by which the coast of Maine is so frequently visited. Portland is fast becoming, through the enterprise and intelligence of its "commercial men," a port of the first importance to the United States. There lias already been established a line of steamers between it and Liverpool, and other lines of steamers communicating with foreign ports are projected. The exports and import~ are large all(l d;iily increasing, and everything is tending to cause it to he, at no very distant day, the third, if not the second, commercial emporium of the country. The harhor is second to none I am acquainted with, for safety, capacity, depth of water, and facility for ingress and t:gres;<; and there is none, I believe, that has received so little aid from the government, towards its improvement, guides to navigation, &c. I have given my especial attention to the best method of providing some guard for Alden's reef, ancl the neighboring reefs. I have considered fully all the plans now in use, and have arrived at the opinion that the cheapest, and most efficient, would be a "light-ship," moored near the south side of the rock: the vessel to be provided with a good ''bell,'' to be used in thick weather ; a bell that could be heard at a distance of four miles would be a timely notice to the navigator of his locality. I would reccommend, in connection with this matter, that the bell now at Cape Elizabeth lw replaced hy a steam-whistle, to guard against confounding it and the bell at the light-ship. If this arrangement is approved and carried out, the navigator would, in all vhases of the weather, he instantly and truly informed of hiR position, and therehy he enabled to avoid, with certainty, all danger. As I have been asked the question whether a beacon would answer the purpose required, I would state, as my decided opinion, that a beacon would arnnver hut indifferently, as it would only be a guide during day-light and clear weather, for which the less expensiYe "spar-huny" would answer equally well and lie of as little use during thick weather. I may be mistaken in my judgment, but I luwe endeavored candidly tn state my convictiom, and therefore recommend that a light-ship be placed at or near Alden's reef, as the best, cheapest, and most efficient aid that could lie rendered under the peculiar circumstances of
the case.

All of which is respectfully submitted by yours, truly, &c.,

and what changes had occurred there, and in the vicinity, since the previous survey, and to exhibit precisely the present condition of the shoal, and the Swash channel. Lieutenant -Woodhull, L. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey, by whom the hyrlrographic survey was made, reports that there is special necessity for an additional heacon, to be placed at the extreme seaward limit of the shoal, and in the position marked a on the chart, in about twenty feet. water. Lieutenant vVoodhull calls attention to the fact, that the iron beacon, from its improper location, cannot serve as a guide to vessels either entering or leaving the harbor, and to the absolute necessity for placing the iron beacon exactly where the shoal terminates, notwith~tanding the cost which may be incurred by its erection in deep water, and the difficulty of protecting it from the ice. In these views I concur, and would recommend the construction of a new beacon in the place proposed by Lieutenant иwoodhull. Yery respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon.

November 1, 1854. Srn: I have the honor to transmit, with my approval, a report of Lieut. Comg. T. H. Stevens, assistant in the Coast Survey, on the examination of the site for a light-house on Anacapa island, coast of California, and on the necessity for a light at that point, and would respectfully request that the report and accompanying sketch may be sent to the Light-house Board. Very resr,ectfully, yours, &c., A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon. P. G. WASHINGTON, Acting Secretary of the Treasury.

SAN FRANCisco, CAL., September 21, 1854. Sm: I have to report that, in compliance with instructions, I have made an examination of the island of Anacapa, with a view to the selection of a site for a light-house, and find that the J>art of the island suitable for this purpose, being the eastern portion, is a mass of rock of volcanic formation, about ninety foet in height, perpendicular on every face, and with an_ ascent inaccessible by any natural means. The island of Anacapa, so called, is composed of three parts, connected by a broken reef of rocks, the eastern 1wrtion being the most northern; the wl10Je a11proaching the form of a crescent. The best anchorage is off the east end of the middle part, near the wreck of the -W:infield Scott, in eleven fathoms water, an eighth of a mile from the shore. The wat~r is bold on every side of the island, increasing rapidly in depth, so that a quarter of a mile from shore you run into twenty fathoms. The bottom is hard, and mixed with sand and corals. Considering the location of a light-house at this point as impracticable without very grea~ expense, which the interests of commerce do not now demand, for the reason that the coastmg trade always keeps the main land aboard, and that the ocean steamers use altogether the passage between Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, both in going and coming, I would respectfully report against the establishment of a light at this point, which could

not be erected without a great outlay of means, and could not be kept going unless at considerable expense, as the island is destitute of wood, water, or even sufficient arable land for the support of a single family. The loss of the "Scott," which first Reems to have attracted attention to this point as a necessary one for the establishment of a light, was one of tboRe unaccountable accident~ which sometimes befal the mo8t capable officers; but as the line of steamers to which she belonged now use a different route, and as they are the only ones that could be benefited, the necessity for its erection no longer exists. I enclose, herewith, a sketch of the island, drawn иby Mr. Mc~lurtrie. Res1)ectfully, yours, T. H. STEVENS, Lieut. Comg. U. S. 8. Schooner .Ewing. Prof. A. n. BACHE, Snperintendent U. S.

SAN FRANCISCO,

December IO, 1853. Sm: After examining the two points of Ano Nuevo and Santa Cruz, with a view to the selection of a site for a light-house, I have, for several reasons, given the preference to the former as the most important point for this purpoAe. In the :first place, I cons.ider it, from its character, an extremely dangerous point, and it should, therefore, have a. light upon it for the purpose of warning the mariner of approach-

ing danger. It posse1<~es all the requisites, from its proximity to Santa Cruz, for a guide to that harbor; it would prove of advantage to vessel<.; employed in the coasting trade; and as it is frequentl~и the first land made b~и vessels coming from distant ports, its importance is manifest in thiR connection. For these reasons, and from the fact that a light-house at Santa Cruz would only serve a local trade, I respectfully recommend the establishment of a light at Ailo Nuevo as of far greater importance. In regard to the location of the proposed site at Ano Nuevo, I would recommend the i~land, or sen, which consists of a sloping ledge of rocks, covered with a stratum of yellow clay about four feet thick, which is also covered with a mound of sand about thirty feet hi~h, the whole above high watH, and rising in the neighborhood of fifty-five feet. For a suitable foundation it woulcl be necessary to remove the sand as deep as to the clay. The island has an area of about a tifty-seventh of a mile, and can be reached from the main shore in rnOLlernte weather ancl at low tide. Tl1e sector of visibility to seaward from this point, exclusive of Monterey bay, is 180░, indusive 200░. A light-house forty feet high above the surface, erected at Island signal, could be seen at a di:stancc of eighteen nautical miles from a ship's deck, say 13 foet high. Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CoAST SURVEY OFFICE, February 16, 1854. Srn : I have the honor to transmit, for the Light-house Board, additional information in regard to a light-house near Sunta Cruz, California, in a report from AsRistant A. 1\L Harrison, of the Coast Survey, and in two tracings of topographical maps-one of the coast near Santa Cruz, and the other of Point Ailo Xuevo. Should the Light-house Board hereafter determine to erect a local light at Santa Cruz, the map will lie of service to them in fixing the site. Mr. Harrison concurs with Lieut, Stevens in recommending the placing of a seacoast light at Ano Nuevo-a question, however, which the BoarJ will probably decide from more general considerations in regard to the lighting of the Western. coast than have entered into the views of either of these officers. 1 have abstained, on this account, from expressing concurrence in their recommendation. иwhen the time may come for placing a light on Ano Nuevo, it may be well to consider the reasons assigned by Mr. Harrison for preferring the site marked a on his map, to that marked b recommended by J,ieut. Stevens. In my judgment, however, the advantage of placing the light on the extremity of the point is sufficient to counterbalance the objections stated by Mr. Harrison, and I therefore express a preference for the site recommended by Lieut. Stevens, and marked b on Mr. Harrison's map. Yours, respectfully, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon. JA.'IES GUTHRIE, Secretary of the Tt'easury.

SANTA CRuz, CALIFORNIA, December 30, 1853. DEAR Srn: Accompanying this report please find two topographical maps, one of Santa Cruz and one of Point Ano Nuevo-scale 111 -A-inrи Agreeably to instructions, I have examined and surveyed the coast between the two abovemcntioned places, and would recommend Point Ano Nuevo as the most suitable site for a light-house. Should it, however, still be deemed advisable to build the li{J'ht-house at Santa Cruz, the 0 point marked (a) upon the map is the one recommended. lt has as a foundation a substratum of hard rock, covered for several feet with firm earth. It is thirty feet in height, and the light from a lantern forty feet high, placed there, could be seen at a distance of fifteen and two-tenths statute miles from a ship's deck, say ten feet high. The sector of visibility to isea.ward from this position, exclusive of Monterey l)ay, would be about 130░;

OF THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY FOR 1854.

*221

inclusive, 200░. But it is my opinion that Point Auo Nuevo possesses all the requisites as a site for a guide to Santa Cruz harbor, and would ali;o prove of arlntntage to veRsPls in the coasting trade. This point once made, it become8 a matter of little difficulty to reach Santa Cruz; and vessels from the northward, bound to lVlontcrey, and even up and down the coast, would find a light here very serviceaLle, while one at Point Santa Cruz would avail them hut little, if any at all. It is also, sometimes, the point first made l)y vessels from distant ports bound to San Francisco; and when this occurn at night, a light would be very useful. Respecting the exact location Of the proposed site upon Point Alio Nuevo, the two po;;itions (a), (b), marked upon the map are submitted, aJthough the point ma,rked (u) is the one I deem preferaLle; (b) is located upon a small island, and the only advantage to be obtained here is the greater angle of visibility it commands to seaward. The island consists of a sloping ledge of roch, covered with a stratum of ydlow clay, alJont four feet thick, which is also covered with a mound of sand about thirty feet higl1, the whole above high-water mark being in the neighLorhood of fifty-five feet. For a suitable foundation, it would of course he necessary to remoYe the sand at least as far as the clay. The island has an area of aLout the 517 th part of a Rquare mile, and cannot be reached from the main shore except at low tide, and in calm weather. We were delayed nearly a week in the month of September, waiting for an opJlortunity to get upon it, in order to sun'ey it. In consideration of these factH, I think that the loss in the number of degrees of horizontal visibility which would be commanded by a light placed upon the island, is more than compensated hy the increased Elevation, firm foundation without reIDoYing the earth, u,nd accessibility, at all times, of the position markecl (a.) Between this position and the extremity of the point, the ground slopes gradually to the southward for a distance of nine hundred metres, and is then thrown into a succession of rolling hills of shifting sand, Yarying from twent;,i' to one hundred feet in height. Point (a) is one hundred and six teet high by leиel. The sector of Yisibility to seaward from this point, cxclusin' of l\lonterey hay, is 155░; inclusive, Hi8░ A light-house forty-feet high erected at point (a) could he seen at a distance of twenty and one-tenth statute miles from a ship' i:; deck, say ten feet high.

CoAsT SuRVEY STATION, N!j:AR CA~TDEN, l\1AIXE,

November 4, 1854. SIR: I have the honor to transmit to the department, to be forwarded to thP Light-house

Board, extracts from the re1mrt of Lieut. Cmng. T. A. CraYen, l'. S. K ..и assistant in the Coast Survey, on the examinations made by him, under my instructions, of the sites for light-houses at Castine, Eggemoggin reach, Isle au Haut, Tenant's harbor, and Damariscotta river, all between the Kennebec riYer and J\it. Desert bay, l\Iaine. These are a part of the examinations desired by the Light-house Board, and directed, by your letter of September 8, to be made under the law. A chart of a reconnaissance of Eggemoggin reach, by Lieut. Comg. CraYen, is preparing, and will be sent soon to the department. I concur with Lieut. Comg. Craven in the recommendations made in his report, and now communicated, and feel it my duty to express to the department the gratification which his promptness in the discharge of this duty has given me. Very respectfully, yours, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Hon. P. G. WASHINGTON, Acting Secretary of the Treasury.

Co AST Srxrn1 STEAll!F.R Comnx, Portland, October 28, 1854. Sm: In compliance with your instructions of 13th September, I have visited and examined the proposed sites of light-houses on this coast, viz: 1. Castine; 2. Eggemoggin reach ; 3. Isle au Haut; 4. Tenant's harbor; i'i. Damariscotta riYer. * * * I. Noddle's Island, Cadine.-1 am of opinion that the light-house on Dicc's Head is of no use to the harbor of Castine. Southeast from the light-house lies a ledge called "Otter Rock," nearly midway in the entrance of the harbor, the channel lying between Otter Rock and Noddle's island, the shores of which are very bold. From Noddle's i8land the course is east-northeast, which carries clear of Hosmer' s Rock. Vessels entering at night have great difficulty in making Noddle':; island, as it is low and coYere<l by the higher land back of it, and a light on Nod<llP's island would make the approach to the harbor easy and safe at all times, and guide vessels past both the ledges named; and, in my opinion, the light on Dice's Head might be discontinued, as the light on Noddle's island would serve all the purposes of bay navig-ation. II. Eggemoggin Reacli.-The light for the eastern entrance to the reach should be located on the south bluff of Hog island. In the accompanying sketch of the entrance to the reach, I have indicated the site selected by the letters L H, and a circle in red. The bluff is elevated, and the channel very bold. The channel from the eastward lies between "Mahony" and "Smutty N oRe," two Rmall islets lying south (nearly) of Harbor island. The light on Hog island would show over Harbor island, and guide vessels through this great thoroughfare, and to vessels coming in from the south the light should be brought to bear north, when they may run for it and avoid the dangerous ledge off Green island, and also a sunken rock lying S. by W. i '\V. from light-house, distant half a mile from Hog island. I recommend that this rock, bare only at very low tides, be marked by a buoy. Its position is not well known, and it. has brought up seYeral vessels. The water is deep around it. There is a second rock, "awash" at lowest tides, nearly south of it, about forty metres distant, and a buoy on this, also, would mark the "Halfиtide ledge," which bears from the rocks NW. t W., distant one-fourth of a mile. III. The Isle au Haut Thoroughfare is not a thoroughfare in the common acceptation of the term, but the passage between Kimball's island and Isle au Haut. The northern entrance is bare at low water, but the southern part deepens to a snug harbor, called the

224*

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT

" Isle au Haut Thoroughfare." This harbor iR much resorted to by the fishing fleets as a harbor of refuge. It iR open to the SvV., and the light on Saddle Back leclgc, about si.x miles distant, shows fair into the harbor; and I think no other is needed, but would recommend, instead of a light-honRe at the thoroughfare, that one be })laced on the dry ledge lying NE. by N. from the easternmost of the Spoon islands, distant about,~lf a mile, where it would l)e a guide to coasters bound up Jericho bay, (the sheet ~4'ater lying between Isle au Haut and _Marshall's island.) It would connect with the light on Mount Desert Rock, aml warn vessels of the proximity of several dangerous ledges-especially the fatal "Black Ledges," which lie nearly four mileA E. by S. from the northern part of Isle au Haut, and which have proved very sadly disastrous to vessels caught here in bad weather. A light on the ledge named wouhl also connect with that for Eggemoggin reach, and be an important aid to navigation. IV. Tenant's Harbor.-A light is much needed at this place. It is a harbor of refuge of much resort, and the town of St. George has some trade. The light-house should be on the northr?astern point of Southern island, the island forming the south side of the entrance. The harbor is small but well sheltered, and to the many vessels trading to the Penobscot, is an important place of refuge in bad weather, Some disasters have occurred to those trying to reach it in the dark. A light of the smallest class will answer the purpose. V. Dry Point, Damari8cotfa river.-A light is quite necessary at this place, both as an aill to vessels bound through Fisherman's Island sound, and to those entering the river. The entranc.;e to the Damariscotta is about three-fourths of a mile wide, and a blind one. There is a ba\l ledge making off from the south point of Horse island, but on the Dry Point side the shores are l1old, giving ten fathoms within eighty yards of the shore. Dry Point is very low and rocky, and cannot he got hold of at night, as vessels fear to enter. 'l'he approaches are easy and safe from the south, and with a light it would be accessible at all times. The commercial advantages of the river are such as to require this indispensable aid to navigation.

Sm: I have to report the result of the examinations of the following localities for sites for light-houses, as desired, under the law, by the Light-house Board, according to your instructions of the 2d instant. l. Westport, MassachusettR. The entrance to the river leading- to thi!i town is marked on the west side by a rocky point called "иwest Head," which rises moderately from the water until it attains an elevation of about seventy-five feet, at about four hundred feet from the point. This is the site which has been suggested for a light-house, and is marked on the accompanying tracing (No. 1) with a circle in red. 'fhc advantages of having a light-house on that point are, I think, inconsiderable, as the river is very narrow, shallow, and crooked, and can scarcely be navigated except with fair wind and tide, and by large vessels only at hight water. Its great intricacy, want of de1ith, and average width, (about. one-eighth of a mile,) will be perceived by glancing at the chart ; and though it io said some eighteen small whaling barques, &c., and about twenty fish,ing schooners and smacks, belong to the port, it bas been very rarely attempted to carry a square-rigged vessel in or out at night, and this could seldom be done under the most favorable circumstances with the assistance of a light. Its service would be confined to a few small schooners and fishing smacks, with very skilful local pilots on board. Vessels rarely make for the outer harbor, or bay, for refuge from northerly winds, as several dangerous rocks lie in it. Its eastern boundary is formed by Gooseberry neck, and the dangerous ledges extending south from that point ; and to clear these, a light on "\iV est Heacl" would render but little aid. In lieu, therefore, of a light-house at Westport, I would respectfully recommend that a light-boat be placed a little to the southward of the series of rocks known as the "Hen and Chickens," "Old and Young Cocks," &c., extending nearly due south from Goo;;;elиerry neck, and in the position marked in red on the accompanying tracing. This would serve as a mark to clear all the rocks, to shape a course for \Vestport, and to show the entrance into Buzzard's br.y, indicating the fair way to New Bedford, and towns to the eastward; and to Newport, New London, &c., to the westward, thus serving a tri1)le purpose aml и 29и

accomplishing a11 that mm 1w tlone for ,,~est port, while serving as a guide to vesRols running eaHt or west. The light-lJoat wonlll serve a most importnnt 11urpl1Re in pointing out the perilrnrn rock;; and ledges near which it sltould 1Je placed, 1md on which many vesselR lmn~ bet>n lost. I tl1ink that a light-boat, in the ])osition marked, wou1d confer a great .benefit upon a largo portion of the mercantile community, and that it is much demanded by:a consitleration of their wants. 2. I am of opinion that there is but little neceRsity for a light at or near Ni'.ant?:c, Oonneetirnt. ThP prnposed ]lORition lies some five or six mih s np Niantic creek, and the ligM would be Reen by only a fow Rm all Yessels trading up tho river for produce, and to JYiillRtone Point for stone. 'l'he trade is too limited to demand the expense and care which would he incurred in the erection of a light-house. 3. A E~ht-house on Blacl.: Point, Connecticut, is scarcely needed. This point forms the western cape of Niantic rin'r, aml very little local trncle is cnrried on; the commeTce of the rirer heing limited to a fo\\' traders in market produce, and to carrying stone from the opposite cape calk<l :Millstone Point. It i,.; not called for l>y the passers through I~ong Island sound, as the lights at Saybrook and New Lonclon, and the light-boat on Bartlett"~ red', arcи all in sight from it. A harhor-ligl1t might be of service to vessels wishing to anchor under the land from a northerly blow. or with a head tide to lie ont of the track of steamers. Should anything he erecte(i, I wo~ld reconuuend a "harbor light" as a guide to the anc11orage, to he placed at a l>oint in the position marked by a circle in red on the accompanying trucing, (No. :3,) at sonie sixty or eighty feet from the edge of the bank, which ri~es about fifteen foet abow the water. The top suil is good, lying in masses of rnck which crop through thtи ground to the Rurfaee, at the Rpot indicated on the tracing. 4. Tho trade of Southport, Connecticut, is carried on with eight Arnall vessels belonging there, aml a fow occasionally looking in from neighboring towm, and it is very small. The channel is so Bhallow that our boat groundeu at the outer pier, and coultl not get within two hundred yanlH of the breakwater, there being lesH than a foot of water with the tide not <]nite out. None hut vessel~ of light draught can enter, and snch only at or near high water. I think a light is not called for by interests sufficiently large to warrant the expense of its erection and maintenance. 5. The examination of FiRl1cr'~ iRlancl, N. Y., RhowH that a light-hou8e at Race Point would materially benefit the large commerce constantly passing through Long Island sound, and l1ctween Gull island and Fisl1er's island. In view of the limited amount of appropriation, a site was seleeteLl near the house erected for thl' government lifl'.'-boat, rit the southwestern extremity of Fisher's i~land, call(иd '' Hace Point," which is indicated on the accompanying chart (:N"o. 5) hy a Rmall circle in red. Were it not for the expense it would be highly preferable to erect a substantial strncture on Hace Bock it:-ielf, (which is very dangerous,) lying nearly a half mile southwest from Race Point, and having four feet water over it at low tide. The light at this point should be a second-class seacoast French light, as it will be at a narrow gate of the sound, and should revolve, showing alternate flashes of red and white to distinguish it clearly from Watch Hill revolving light, and from Gull island, Plumb island, and several other fixed lights near it. Too much cannot be done for the safety of the already immense and constantly increasing fleets of vessels passing through the sound in all seasons, and in all weathers. The ripot indicated i~ twelve or fifteen feet above the water, and on a rocky foundation. fi. On Horton's Point, Long Island sound, N. Y., a light would be highly beneficial in thick weather, particularly to steamers, which seldom anchor or lie by; and it would help t~1 fill the long gap on tho I~ong Island shore between Old Field light and Plumb island, a d1Rtancc :if over forty miles, at present without a light. The Hite Rl'lected is marked with a small circle in red on the accompanying cliart, (No. 6,) aml is Rome eighty feet from the edge of a bluff, elevated about seventy-five feet above t~e water, and near its rnoi-t prominent point composed of very large masses of rock filled in with gravel and ~and, and covered with a thin rich soil. A second-class seacoast light, illuminating about '.!il0░, is recommended; and if possible, with the amount appropriated, it Rhould be constructed to revolve, in order to distinguish it from those adjacent, which are nearly all :fixed lights.

1854. Sm: In obedience to your instructions, I have maue a careful examination of Pine island and several points of land at the entrance to JI\ ew London Conn., and have to report that in m.y opinion a fog-signal in that vicinity would be of great utility to the numeiиou8 Yessels tradmg there, among which are several steamboats daily carrying a vast number of passengers; and also to many coasters that seek at times, as a place of refuge, the harbor of Xew London, which is one of the best we possess on the Atlantic coast of the Uиj,ited States. It could ~e advantageously placed either at the light-house at Eastport, or at the southc_rn extremity of Pine island. The former might be least expensive, as thtи keeper of the light could attend it for a small extra compensation, but Pine island would he the hc>st to wa;n vessels of the proximity of" Black Ledge,'' a very dangerous reef of rocks ly~ng south of it, an~ would also serve very well to indicate the course into the harbor. By mmg a fogtru:np~t it could always be easily distinguished from the signal at the North Dumpling, whwh is a bell; so that their being near each other would be rather an advantage, as, should both be heard at once, the sounds would be distinct and tbe direct.ions would the better dete~mi~e the position of the vessel.

DEAR

THORNTON A. JENKINS,
Capt. H. \V. BE~HAM, U. S. Engineers, assistant in charge of Coast Survey Office.

Secretary.

PHILADELPHIA, February 21, 1854. Sm: It is extremely desirable that there should be a "hydrographic reconnaissance" made of that portion of the Florida reef known as the "Coffin's Patches." The examinations made by me last summer, though satisfactory, so far as concerns solving the question of the character of the foundation of the proposed light-house, yet, from want of time and means, these examinations were not sufficiently extended to authorize the definitive selection of a site for the structure. Knowing the promptitude of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey in responding to all calls upon his department for the advancement of the public interests, and in view of the efficiently organized hydrographic party now on the reef, it has occurred to me that a recon:. naisr<ance of these shoals might be ordered by him, which, while it would furnish us with desired information, would not be valueless in the future operations of the survey itself. For the purpose of selecting a site, this reconnaissance need be only of the most general character. What I wish to know is, the number and relative positions of the different shoals or spots constituting the Patches, and the general depth of water on each, together with the position of some known object on the shore. The great desideratum is to ascertain the position of that shoal which is the most protected from the gulf-wave, where the stability of the structure would be the least endangered. If the Board should concur with me in these views, I would ask that an application be made to the Superintendent of the Coast Survey to have such a reconnaissance made if convenient. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE, Lieut. Tcrpographical Engineers.

COAST SURVEY OFFICE, April 17, 1854. DEAR Srn: I have received your letter, dated 13th instant, enclosing a copy of a letter from Lieut. G. G. Meade, in relation to a hydrographic reconnaissance of "Coffin's Patches," on the Florida reefs. I will at once direct the reconnaissance, but fear that my instructions may not reach Lieut. Comg. Craven in time to obtain the information immediately. Yours respectfully, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Lieut. T. A. JENKINS, U.S. N., Secretary Light-house Board.

COAST SURVEY OFFICE, June 30, 1834. Srn: In compliance with your request, a hydrographic reconnaissance has been made of Coffin's Patches, founded on the triangulation of Lieut. James Totten, U.S. A., assistant in the Coast Survey, by Lieut. Corng. T. A. Craven, U. S. N., assistant in the Coast Survey. I send a tracing of his chart. In his report upon the work, Lieut. Comg. Craven says: "\Vi th regard to the erection of a light-house on these shoals, I do not think the l)osition eligible. Vessels hound through the Florida straits generally try to 'make,' or do 'make,' Sombrero key, which is about ten miles to the southward and westward of Coffin's Patches. A light on Sombrero key would guide vessels clear of the Patches, and could be made a more permanent work.'' Yours respectfully, A. D. BACHE, Superintendent. Lieut. T. A. JENKINS, U.S.~.,
Secrdary Light-house Board.
